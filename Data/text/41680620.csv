0,,9/29/2018,27,,"Fresh Meadows, NY",Ces L.,366,4.0,108,Watch the sunset on the High Line and come here for food and drinks. Start off with some Harissa Fries and Crostinis. Order yourself one of their sandwiches like their Ham & Cheese or one of their salads if you're stuck on a diet plan like I am. The staff here are amazing and attentive. It's seat yourself so time your arrival to come before the afternoon after work rush or the weekend rush if it's a bright sunny day out. Restrooms are not a far walk from here either but ladies be prepared because there's only two stalls so lines can get long.The open air and great company you bring goes well with the atmosphere. Bring a date or bring your friends. You can't go wrong with a night at Terroir.,
1,,8/2/2018,9,,"Richmond Hill, NY",Michael K.,69,3.0,77,"Eating on the High Line - you can't beat that! Terroir is a small eatery on the High Line which is a good pit stop when walking in the park.My group and I recently had lunch there and were content with the food and drinks. I had the roasted cauliflower salad which was fine. The sauce was delicious but one thing that was a bit weird for me was the fact that the lentils were hard and crunchy. I certainly never had crunchy lentils before! It was an interesting taste. I also had the black iced tea was lightly sweetened (perfect for me).For the table we had the harissa fries which are basically seasoned fries. They were REALLY good - I had no self control with them! We also shared the farro salad which is basically an avocado and tomato salad. One thing I wish Terroir had were more non beef and pork options. As someone that doesn't eat both of these, my options were limited. Despite this, I will be return to try their frozé (frozen rosé).",

The salads are perfectly prepared, offering a tantalizing tastebud experience. I may massage kale from now on and add browned hazelnuts from now on. The roasted cauliflower salad on arugula had all fresh veggies and something to savor. The Mission fig crostini is delicately toasted and a light sprinkle of salt to balance out the flavor. The local food, local drafts on tap and atmosphere is a must be stop.",

I always pass this place but since my family from Chicago came to visit I decided it would be nice to have a drink here. The frozen rose was so good half of us ordered it! The rest of my table ordered different beers. A bit pricey but we didnt order food here. Our server was really nice so she helped accomadate us. If you're not a fan of people this isn't something youd like, you will be very close to the groups next to you it's like having a giant picnic table of strangers. Luckily, it was half of my family haha.",1

Terrior is little popup outdoor bar located on the High Line that serves a limited menu of light bits and alcoholic beverages. It's really nothing more than a retrofitted storage container and a few picnic tables, but it's the perfect place to stop for a drink during your walk on the High Line. Wine starts at $10 and up, beers are around $7-8.Views of the Hudson, Hoboken and even the Statue of Liberty if you're lucky, are lovely, especially at sunset.",2

We lucked out with a spot right on the corner, with unobstructed views of the river - it couldn't have been more perfect. The frose was delicious, but each of the two I had tasted different, with the second one being better.  Our server was attentive and made sure we had all we needed.  I could spend all summer on this porch.",1

It's such a wonderful brand and the splendor of the Highline makes everything taste better.Terroir's menu is always super Riesling heavy and I don't care for Rieslings. So I'll order a Prosecco or something along those lines. I can't deduct stars for this, because it is Meatpacking, but the drinks here are CRAYZEE expensive, like $15 each. So just know before ya go.",2

This place has a special place in my heart -- it was one of the first places I went with my boyfriend where we ever got drinks and we go back every summer. The ambiance is awesome, and all of the staff people we have ever encountered have been nothing short of sweet and wonderful to interact with. It's a bit pricey but seeing as we don't come here often, it's a bit of a treat. Tried the frozen rosé today and it was delicious - I think there was strawberry in it? Slightly sugary and sweet! Will be coming back!",

You sit overtop the river, so it's nice and breezy, but it's nice to see and hear the musicians playing on the Hi-Line as well.

Well, there are plenty of nice bars near the High Line. Some of them even have outdoor areas. So enjoy the beauty of this park, then go elsewhere for a decent drink and actual human service.",
12,,8/28/2018,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Aude V.,0,2.0,5,Went to the bar to ask for a beer. Being told in a very rude manner that we needed to sit at the table and that it was table service. Server came to the table with a beer without asking us what kind of beer we wanted. When we ask why he brought us a beer without asking us he said that is what he does when tourist ask for beer. Good beer. Good location. Service not so good.,

It can get pretty busy on a nice day but once you're seated at one of the picnic tables, it's all good. On a super-hot day when the sun is beating down on you, you'd better hope for an optimal seat with overhead covering, otherwise you're likely to fry while sitting there.The place offers a cool vibe. It can smell of hipster pretentiousness but ""whatevs"". Some of the menu items sound interesting but the quantities are small and the flavors can use a little more punch. Prices aren't cheap either but you're paying for the location and because they don't really have any competition on the High Line.My 3-star rating is tempered because I was less than impressed with the food but the spot really is a nice place, all in all. It's worth another try, I suppose. I'd say it caters to adults but kids can also join in.",2

It was really good, and it wasnt too sweet like most hard ciders. We also got french fries to share, and even though the portion was small for three people, these were the best french fries I have ever had. So crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside, with the perfect amount of salt. The prices were high, but it's new york on the highline, so I definitely wasnt expecting it to be cheap. However, the drinks and fries were worth every cent and calorie consumed.",
18,1,9/25/2014,378,,"Seattle, WA",Arthur K.,647,2.0,791,"Holy hipster heaven, & I live in the NW where it's overrun by them. I really want to give this place a better review. It's on the High Line and the atmosphere is second to none. It's alright that the beer prices are kind of high. I'm sure the rent is not low here. What I thought was ridiculous is that they serve their cider like wine. I got a local cider and when he the server came out with a 22 oz bottle I thought I was getting a monster deal. Then he pours out a tiny bit in the glass and asks me to taste it. What a way to make a blue collar drink as pretentious as possible. After I agree to the taste, he pours me just a few ounces. Sometimes, things just don't need to be ""fancied"" up. Keep them accessible and not pretentious. The food I saw on the other tables looked very pretentious as well. Just give me a simple beer & good sides that aren't overpriced and trying too hard.",

20,2,8/8/2013,410,5,"New York, NY",Daniel B.,356,3.0,620,"An open-air wine bar on the High Line.  Friendly service, obviously a nice setting.  Hard to mess up.  And yet...  They serve their red wine chilled, like a white.  Which is... weird.  When we realized this, we gave the Terroir folks the benefit of the doubt.  We presumed that we were wrong to expect our red wine to be at room temperature, and that these oenophiles served their red wine chilled like a white for some specific, connoisseur-ish reason.  So we asked them.  With open hearts and minds, we said, ""Why is your red wine chilled like white wine?""  And they told us... That they keep it chilled because otherwise it'd go bad overnight, and it's a small place with no good storage but the fridge.  And I thought this is perhaps not the ideal answer for a self-styled wine bar that calls itself Terroir and charges $10-15 for a glass.As my friend said, if they're going to be doing this, they might as well just call themselves Booze on the Porch**--then there'd be no expectations set, and everyone'd be happy.  Why not just put a box of wine out on the counter and let everyone self-serve?  Or pour it all into a trough, all the wines sloshing together, and give everyone giant bendy straws--that too would be fine.  Five stars for the straws alone.We also had the ""terroir"" fries (parmesan & mayo, instead of ketchup).  They were delicious.** Note to the High Line committee--this idea is GOLD.  Do it.  It's all yours.",3

Not the greatest selection, but my favorite wine was a Cabernet Franc from the Finger Lakes (served chilled). The lamb sausage wrapped in sage leaves (and fried) was awesome and worth coming back for. The server was a nice, if awkward, guy. There are, of course, a lot of tourists nearby.The only downsides don't actually have to do with the vendor as much as the location. First, the distance to the bathroom-- which, frankly, had droplets of blood all over the place the night I was there-- and, second, the mice running around-- I get it, it's outside, and honestly, they are cute, but they came very close to running over my feet many times.

You're out of the way of the crowd, but can see everyone in the distance, including vendors and the traffic on the street below. It's not too quiet, but not too loud either. Fun atmosphere for a quick day drinking excursion. Our server was great! She was quick with suggestions for wine or beer and very pleasant. She chatted, but didn't hover over us either.

30,,6/8/2012,166,,Hong Kong,Diane L.,408,4.0,260,"How fantastic - the only place on the Highline to have a liquor license!! Terroir is part of the now semi-famous Terroir franchise with locations in Tribeca, Lower East Side, etc.  Service is always fantastic at all locations and you are served by folks who truly love and appreciate all kinds of wine - without being pretentious about it.This nice little space has a great view of water, with casual bench tables. The prices are not cheap for food nor necessarily for bottles (standard is $30+ for a bottle) - but what can you expect when you also get the great view?The meatballs are always my fav and newly added - Lamb Sausages.A great place for a sunny day during the weekend to hang out with friends.If you are really hungry after, you can also just pop across since you are on the highline and grab food from the local food stands (Bark Dogs, Tacos).",2

For the size of the repurposed shipping container that houses the place, the food is OK and the wine selection is OK as well. Not a great selection of reds but perhaps they are not open during the winter and this is a summer wine list? If you like Riesling you will love the list. The selection of salads (chick peas, chicken salad, lettuces) was great to share. French fries are OK. Salami pieces are small and thick instead of large and thin.

The service was kind of like a swarm of bees, various servers sharing duties to attend to your needs.  (I think 3 different people waited on us!?).  While they all seemed expertly trained, courteous and helpful, it was a wee bit distracting.  The communal bench-tables lend to more of a beer garden flavor, however, so don't come here expecting a peaceful gourmet oasis.  I will certainly recommend this gregarious, craft beer porch for gourmands to my friends.",1

I told Henry, our waiter, that I didn't think it was cool for him to do this, and should have told me beforehand. He said he ""didn't know it was a money thing"" but apologized.
