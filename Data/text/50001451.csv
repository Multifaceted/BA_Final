0,Rebekah B.,"Winter Park, FL",263,358,465,4.0,10/31/2018,2018 Review 99/100Great food. Great location. Bubby's is worth a try. A great stop for lunch or dinner when exploring the High Line.The biscuits are delicious. I ordered the Kale & Farro salad as my main course and it was great. Good portions. Great service too.A great spot I would definitely dine at again when in the area.,1,1,1
1,Cheng C.,"Little Neck, NY",55,32,0,3.0,11/12/2018,"I don't get they hype, the location of this place is in a tourist trap, where they can hike up the price for very mediocre food.I was there for Breakfast and right on par with the other reviews, the service is LACKING, nobody comes over to ask you how everything is, can't find the waiter to pay.The food is average at best, only in meatpacking can you probably get away with charging $10 dollars for diner pancakes for kids.  The seating arrangement here is just not thought out carefully, as you are sitting right on top of each other, which makes it uncomfortable to eat.I don't mind paying, but the food really needs to step it's game up!",,,
2,Sean B.,"West Hollywood, CA",2365,3057,1714,3.0,11/1/2018,"Line was very long. Menu a bit limited. Service a bit spotty. The food was decent; not great, not bad. I'd return, but on a slow night, at the behest of friends, perhaps. Nothing about it really grabbed me.",1,,1
3,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,476,780,5.0,9/22/2018,"Grab an outdoor table on a Saturday and this is paradise! You feel like you're on vacation as you feast on thick slices of bacon, eggs and fluffy pancakes with fresh blueberries. The huevos rancheros with cilantro rice and a thick tortilla soaked in egg is also delicious. Big mugs of coffee. A comforting delight.5 Stars!!!!!",3,1,1

5,Ann S.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,193,450,3.0,11/1/2018,"Great brunch place by the High Line, pretty spacious with outdoor seatings. Great location, right across the street from the staircase to go up on to the highland. My favorite item from Bubby's is their biscuit. The biscuit is usually serve warm with cream and jelly. Super flaky and utterly delicious. I've had their pancakes, portions are huge and feels pretty heavy. Other breakfast items like eggs, bacon, home fries are pretty basic and taste like they always do. If you go, try the biscuit instead.",2,,
6,Charles R.,"Manhattan, NY",16,154,249,5.0,8/19/2018,"I have been hearing about Bubby's for years. Well, I finally tried it for dinner.I was always daunted by their prices, but the portions are large and therefore justified. We ordered the burger with blue cheese, and the fried chicken and pancake.The burger was juicy and humongous. The cheese was delicious and the bun was perfectly toasted. The pancakes were moist and delicious. They didn't even need any butter. With a dollop of their delicious maple syrup, the pancakes butteriness increased ten-fold and worked really nicely with the thyme which was really unexpected. While the fried chicken was not my favorite and I felt it could have more flavor, the pancakes more than made up for it.We finished with a slice of Banoffee Pie which had a really delicious and buttery graham cracker crust, topped with slices banana and whipped cream.Now I see why people love this Brunch spot. I really wouldn't mind coming back!",,,
7,Miguelito F.,"Portland, OR",4,6,0,2.0,10/30/2018,"The hostess and the bartender were great, so at least part of their staff has their act together.  However, the waitress was a nightmare and screwed up our order completely.The menu at first glance looks interesting and I was interested in some Americana as an expat: however, the fried chicken was some of the worst I've ever had and made food in Germany tasty by comparison, which is a low bar to fall under.  The cole slaw tasted weird and it was altogether a very un-enjoyable experience.  Would never go back.",1,,
8,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,79,73,4.0,9/15/2018,"Bubby's provided me with the quintessential NYC brunch experience. The outdoor seating was great for people watching while still maintaining some separation from foot traffic to give a bit of privacy. The ambiance was upbeat, with attentive service and no sense of being rushed. The food was good - my friend was spot on with his recommendation of the pancakes, which were delicious. Eggs and sausage were okay, but the pancake definitely stole the show. Lots of cocktails and a few beers on tap if you want to make it a boozy brunch. And, as with almost any NYC brunch, the price isn't easy on your wallet, even before drinks. Overall a good time, I plan to come back and splurge once every couple of months!",1,,
9,Maxine W.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,3,0,2.0,10/20/2018,"This might be a hot take, but I didn't love Bubby's. I think it's more of a touristy spot than it is a good spot for locals. The pancakes were really overpriced and even though they were good, they were nothing special. We also got avocado toast, which didn't taste very fresh. All other main options were super egg-heavy.I think you can get comparable pancakes for much less at somewhere like the Original Pancake House. I looove OPH because I know what to expect every time, but I didn't particularly love Bubby's because it was way overhyped and expensive for what it was. The best pancakes I've found in NYC are at Clinton Street Bakery on the Lower East Side and even though the wait there might be longer, it's definitely worth it (and less expensive!)",1,,1
10,Tom T.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",141,293,0,2.0,10/25/2018,"First, the food was good. I had a Caesar salad with chicken & the greens were very fresh & the chicken was nicely grilled. Bad news is that the service & the menu were VERY disappointing.Seems like there's a trend toward having a limited menu between lunch & dinner at a lot of restaurants I've been to recently. Bubby's offered what they called an ""intermission"" menu & it only had about 10 items that were either burgers or salads. They did tell us in advance that the intermission menu would be offered for the time we reserved, about 4:15pm, but that call came when we were on the train from the Hudson Valley to Manhattan. Less busy times, less business but I don't like the lack of variety restaurants are doing with this time period at all. After waiting about 10 mins for one of the staff to take our order, we waited for another 30 mins before I chased down one of the staff to tell them we'd been waiting a long time. I saw our server race back to the kitchen & not 30 secs later another staffer appeared with our salads. Pretty obvious that they were already done but the staff had forgotten about us.",,,
11,Andrew S.,"Queens, NY",299,618,1198,4.0,8/18/2018,"Had two entrees, couple non-alcoholic drinks and desert from Bubby's. The first being their fried chicken, which is pretty good but not superb. I like that the shell had a little bit of crispness to it with a more emphasis on hardness than crispness. It was tasty but not very flavorful. The meat itself was meaty rather than tender/soft. But I liked it.The biscuit was also very good in that it was moist (it felt like a right amount of butter or such was used), soft and had a good texture in what something baked with crust should be.The burger was good. It tasted as beef should be, soft with a bit of a meaty bite. It was exactly as I asked for, cooked medium rare.I also liked their cherry pie and chocolate cookie. The filling was right on the spot. But what I liked most was exactly what I liked in the biscuit. This also goes for the chocolate cookie. It seems Bubby's makes a very good pastry like food. Those items were soft, moist, perfectly sweet with a very light chew and shell to them.Their pink lemonade and hibiscus tea are refreshing, also!",11,4,8
12,Van V.,"Montclair, NJ",55,544,945,4.0,4/28/2018,We stopped in here for drinks at the bar and look forward to returning for food. A classic and comfortable restaurant environment in the trendy Meatpacking area of Manhattan. Our only criticism: it was hard to get the bartender's attention and they were not all that busy. Alas. But we liked the blanc de blanc and IPAs  on tap anyway! Let her talk to her Co-workers! They have an ice cream shop right there too!,3,1,1
13,Kendra B.,"McLean, VA",190,81,255,5.0,4/27/2018,"Good southern hospitality in the heart of New York!!! This place was walking distance from my hotel so I decided to check them out for happy hour/dinner. I was so pleased with both the service and the food I came back for lunch today!I was seated quickly - they had available seating inside and out. The weather was nice but I opted to sit inside as the music is amazing!! Ellie was my waitress and she was super attentive and sweet! She took great care of me! She convinced me to try their homemade buttermilk biscuits and I'm so glad I did!! They were to die for!!! I started with a Bubby's Punch for happy hour. It was really good. Cool, crisp and refreshing. It was cucumber-y. Lol!! That's the best way to describe it. For my entree, I did the Peruvian chicken and the bacon mac n cheese!! So delish!! The chicken was flavorful with lime, garlic and oregano. Sooooo delish!!! The mac n cheese was piping hot, creamy and cheesy. If you're in NYC, this place is definitely a must try! Right outside the high line, it's situated among lots of shops and things to see and do. Also, the people watching here is the best!! LOL!! Please check them out. Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders were super friendly. When you stop in, ask for Ellie!! You'll be glad you did!!",2,,4

15,Chris K.,"Seattle, WA",5,58,97,5.0,5/16/2018,"Love Love Love this place!Great location at the end of the Highline across from the Whitney. A lot of cool clothing shops all around as well as cool galleries.The food at Bubby's was great. I got a typical breakfast and the shining star of breakfast was the mimosa flight ( orange, blood orange, pomegranate, grapefruit ) hell yes! The place was busy but service was on point, servers took pride in their job ( that means a lot and sets them apart ). Didn't get the pancakes but saw them at the table next to us and they looked ridiculousFor more go to @the_foodservations on instagram",1,,

They have sidewalk seating and it was nice to sit outside. We started with fresh juice, kale, lemon, celery and it was really delicious. My wife had cheesy grits and huevos rancheros and she loved it. I had the house smoked salmon on an everything bagel and salad.Super friendly staff from the host to the waiter.Highly recommend",,,
18,Rant E.,"New York, NY",17,52,96,4.0,7/16/2018,"Great location with plenty of nice retail stores, specialty shop, and right smack across the street from the Highline.  Nice scenery abound.The restaurant has cool décor and the service was okay.  The greeter was nice, but the server seemed annoyed to have to be providing service.  I sat outside on a beautiful summer Sunday afternoon and did not have to wait to be seated.  The restaurant was busy but not crowded.I was there for a late brunch and on a foodie adventure to locate the best pancakes in NYC.  This place is certainly in the conversation for the best pancake title.  I had seen a lot written about this place's pancakes and they did not disappoint.First, however, I started off with Cobb salad, which was awesome!  All of the ingredients were top notch, fresh and delicious, from the bacon to the avocado to the dressing.  It was one of the best Cobb salads I've ever had.I then moved on to the show: the pancakes!  They have thin sourdough pancakes and the traditional flapjack style.  Naturally, I went with the flapjack.  I decided to go with the strawberry and nutella pancakes.  The banana and walnut also looked good.  They were undeniably incredible pancakes--undeniable.  They didn't need syrup but I had a few bites with syrup anyway, just to see what that life was about.  The pancakes were fluffy, just the right amount of moist, lite and beautifully golden.  I would definitely recommend them.  That being said, as I mentioned, I'm on a foodie mission for the best, and I've had pancakes that I enjoyed more which cost less.  $21 for two normal size pancakes and condiments; I would, however, say that the pancakes are definitely worth the price tag plus here, you get the Highline, cool vibes from the location, and many cool shops and stores in the area.",3,,1
19,Darren F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,2,1.0,9/15/2018,"Complete Tourist TRAP!I highly recommend that you go elsewhere.One Burger (no fries), One Side, One Beer....$49.37 (w/$8 Gratuity) at the bar. The burger was horrible, service lacking and VERY overpriced.I wrote to the owner, Ron Silver. No response. Disputed the charge with my CC company, fully expecting that credit would not be issued but wanted Mr. Silver to go through the motions.But, that's OK, I'll use tell YELP and my other social media (6500 FB, 5200 LI, 3500 Tw) to let everyone know about this place.You've been warned!",3,1,
20,Scott B.,"New York, NY",8,171,204,3.0,3/8/2018,"I couldn't​ figure out why this place had such a low rating despite the location, food presentation, and obvious popularity while there. The cost vs. taste just isn't​ there. They have got food presentation down, it flat out looks amazing. The flavor though is flat. I had the ""Crispy Chicken"" ($19 mustard greens, spicy honey mustard and served with fries or home fries). The chicken was crispy at some point before they drowned it in the honey mustard, that was not spicy, I'm guessing this not homemade​ honey mustard. The biscuit​ it was served on was about 1/5 the size of the chicken breast. Home fries were killer but, not enough to save the meal for me. ""Bubby's Punch ($13 mix of spirits, citrus, spices, fresh juices) It tasted good, not​ too acidic with the citrus and not too strong (you decide if that a good thing).There were some standouts, the butter that was served was absolutely phenomenal​, the bacon was also super thick and the best thing I​ ate there. The portion to price wasn't​ bad, just didn't kill it in the taste department. Good selection of items for groups that don't​ all want the same thing.If you want to spend NYC money in a location right next to the Highline​ for food that's​ great for instagram and not the palate, stop in.",1,,
21,Jaana S.,"Glen Head, NY",298,166,165,4.0,7/5/2018,"""Good luck"" That's what the kid sitting next to me said as my blueberry ""james beard"" pancakes were placed in front of me. Three gorgeous, light, fluffy pancakes gently stuffed with but totally covered in blueberries. The ratio of blueberry inside the pancake itself was perfect. Not every bite had a blueberry, so it was not overwhelming with the topping. I really got to taste the pancake...and boy were those pancakes good. I've eaten more pancakes than the average mortal man, and I'd laud these dense, almost cakey pancakes at Bubby's as one of the best I've put in my belly. You'd be ridiculous to not try Bubby's pancakes. In terms of non-pancake aspects of your experience at Bubbys:1) you'll wait about 20 minutes to get a table for brunch2) you'll be awkwardly close to the other diners 3) you'll be confused why you're spending $21 dollars on pancakes but order them regardless 4) you'll think you're getting a good bang 4 your buck when you see the waiter bring you a mountain of pancakes5) you'll realize that you were only able to finish about $11 worth of your pancakes because they're so dense you'll be too full to scarf down the full $21So...what's the moral of the story? Share the pancakes between two people",,2,1
22,Courtney H.,"Waukesha, WI",15,12,13,5.0,10/6/2018,Incredible brunch spot directly below the High Line. Bonus that they have CBD infused beverages.

23,Susie C.,"Southwest Washington, Washington, DC",2,45,26,5.0,6/24/2018,"tl;dr WOW THOSE PANCAKES THOUGHCame on a Sunday at noon with a powerful pancake craving. We were promptly seated. Service was relatively efficient. I had the CBD iced coffee, a short stack of blueberry pancakes, and scrambled eggs. Friend got the kale salad. CBD coffee was pretty good, but maybe a bit too sweet for lovers of black coffee. Pancakes were perfectly thick and chewy. Tip: if you're not a big meat-eater and want the Griddle Special, just get a short stack of pancakes and eggs. Same price as the special, but you get one more pancake! Would definitely go again. Walk the High Line after to work off that hearty food!",1,1,

25,Kevin A.,"Palo Alto, CA",164,66,101,5.0,1/15/2018,"I don't know how this place only has 3.5 stars. The biscuits and jam alone earn this place 5 stars. Definitely get those to start. We also ordered:-matzo ball soup: ""why don't they do this more in California?"" My wife loved it. Lots of vegetables and chicken. Nice and healthy.-cheese grits and eggs. I ordered this. It came with toast and crunchy bacon. Mixing the grits with the bacon and eggs was a cheesy masterpiece. But the biscuits -- that's what I'll remember about this place. They were dense and chewy, the way a biscuit should be. They came with soft butter and fresh raspberry jam. So good!",1,1,1
26,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,4.0,12/8/2017,"The reviews on this place seem very mixed, but I have to say, I had a legit good experience at this place.Had drinks and dinner at the bar. I'm a fan of the comfort food menu. After a couple cocktails (they make a nice French 75), I ordered the Meat and Three. My choices were meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn on the cob (by the way, it's very challenging to eat corn on the cob and stay neat). The meatloaf was delicious! Firm and compact, yet soft and tender on the inside. Nicely seasoned with the classic tomato sauce ketchup topping. The bartender who was taking care of us was awesome. She was super friendly, cracking jokes, and even did a shot together with us. The space in general is really nice, very ambient lighting and cool bar. Also had a great soundtrack playing in the background that night. I was pleasantly full and warm with good food and good vibes. That is, until the person I was with suggested a chilly walk on the Highline. (This is a common occurrence, the 'pleasant' outdoor stroll, which inevitably ends up being positively frigid. Cripes. Why do they keep doing this to me? Frostbite is not a good look on anyone.)",3,2,3

As many places in NY, it's way way too loud. You can barely speak to the person next to you, and definitely can't talk to the person in front of you. The service was ok. We ordered drinks and food. I believe our waitress must have forgotten our drinks because the food already took a long time to arrive, and we only got our drinks after the food was served... no hard feelings, it happens. But what shocked us is when she came with her tablet for us to pay, and she, herself, clicked on the 20% tip option without consulting us whatsoever. Isn't there a reason why it's up to the client to choose? What if we wanted to leave 18%? Hell what if we wanted to leave 25%??! Tbh she would have gotten the 20% anyways, but the fact that she took the right to choose away from us was definitely not ok.",,,

Consider Bubby's, you could rock up in snowboots in otherwise fashion-forward Chelsea, raucously laugh away the chills, and with the food, be naughty and virtuous at the same time.

50,Zaza R.,"Manhattan, NY",125,38,82,3.0,8/19/2018,"I came here last night for dinner with three high school friends (and my friend's 15-month-old daughter). The waitress was ""nice enough"", but definitely not friendly by any stretch of the imagination. We asked if they would be able to sing Happy Birthday, and before the question could even come out she replied ""We don't do that..."" -- within earshot of the Birthday Girl, which was obviously highly annoying. I'm a firm believer in the fact that delivery is EVERYTHING - it's not what you say, its HOW you say it. In terms of the food, we all left with to-go bags, b/c the portions were massive (which they should be for the prices) however, the food was just okay. I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes with a side of baked macaroni and cheese. I like to think I'm a mac & Cheese aficionado -- I order it everywhere I go that has it on the menu -- and even before tasting it, I could tell it wasn't going to be my cup of brie. (See what I did there?) As a born and bred New Yorker, I've had better food and service, thus I wouldn't go out of my way to return to Bubby's nor would I necessarily recommend it to anyone else. Overall, the highlight of the evening was the Jay-Z painting along with obsessing over my friend's daughter.",,,

54,Catherine P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",40,5,0,4.0,3/12/2018,"The presentation of the food was great. The food? It didn't really make a mark on me. It was alright but not memorable, yknow? I got the fried chicken with your pick-3 meal sides (I got seasoned greens, which was just basically garlicky salty kale, bacon Mac and cheese, which was pretty good and coleslaw, which was just meh) and ice tea. I told them I wanted my ice tea sweetened, and when my order came they complete forgot. I asked again for my sweetened ice tea and what they brought me was this liquid sweetener. It did a difference but still, I was a bit annoyed about it. I went on to my food, which was overall-  good bordering on lackluster. The fried chicken was good but the sides didn't have me completely loving my whole meal.Edit: Forgot to add! The biscuits is what made me give it four stars! Absolutely delicious with the butter and jam. Please try it. I might come here next time just for that, and maybe to try their pancakes. I only heard good things, prolly should've just picked that in the first place.",1,,

However it doesn't get the 5 stars because of the pricing. I get it, it's the location but $25 for good pancakes and bacon is just a bit too much. It wasn't OUT OF THIS WORLD like I would expect a $25 pancake would be. I also got the mimosa flight which was tasty, the lemonade flavor was my favorite.

Yum.Bacon wrapped meatloaf and mashed excellent! Bacon was a nice thick cut cooked to perfection!Seared salmon also a delight! Corn salad with it was also perfect and very different.  I strongly recommend not leaving there until you have had the cherry pie!! Hands down the best pie I have ever had!! Banoffe was also great! Had the blueberry pie was disappointed with this one. Wish they would describe it cause it isn't anything like I have had before.

The food didn't take long for the amount of people in there. There's a lot on the menu, such as soups, burgers, sandwiches, and pancakes. Soft Shell Crab Benedict ($25)- 4/5  This was really delicious! The spring onion bernaise sauce was amazing mixed with poached eggs! I ate every piece of the soft shell crab. Huevos Rancheros ($19)- 3/5 This was okay, they serve this with tortilla which was sorta soggy already. But the portion was quite big. Orange juice ($6)- 5/5 Sweet, cold, and a little bit sour (in a good way).",4,3,3
67,Hallie M.,"Manhattan, NY",203,58,21,2.0,12/8/2017,"Man, what a disappointment. I recently came here for brunch on a Sunday and had to wait an hour to be seated, which honestly is pretty understandable given the location (the ever-touristy meat packing district) and the fact that it's now holiday season.What was disappointing IMO was the quantity of food you're given for the price you're paying. I ordered the banana pancakes which come with caramelized bananas and walnuts on top. First, let me just explain that they are plain pancakes with topping, no bananas in the batter. So if you're going to have a topping, it should be generous, and if it is not generous then you should at least layer the topping in between the pancakes. There were about four slices of bananas on top and lots of walnuts. How interesting, the cheaper ingredient was scarce and the more expensive ingredient was plentiful. Additionally, I had to pour syrup over the pancakes twice, and I NEVER do that with specialty pancakes (the ""topping"" should have been enough).",4,,1

My friends both had vegetarian options that I didn't pay enough attention too because my food was so scrumptious. Whatever they ate, they very much enjoyed it too.

Out of everything, I loved the biscuits and raspberry mimosa.First off, the chicken was crunchy and hot but not greasy. Yet I wouldn't crave it again because the star of the dish was definitely the buttery biscuits! Unfortunately, we had a little mishap with one of the pieces being bloody but the server brought out another piece. Second, the huevos rancheros was very blah, nothing too special about it.

Ordered the soup salad combo and my dining partner ordered soup sandwich There were no specifications as to which salad or sandwich applied to this combo deal and my partner requested crab sandwich. Server told him she didn't think it was included in the deal but was going to inquire. Meanwhile, we waited nearly 45 mins and when I saw that the table next to us received their meal despite being seated way after placing our order I knew what had happened! Our server probably forgot to inquire about the crab sandwich and never put the order in!!!When she finally arrived she informed us it would not be part of the combo deal and she would head to the kitchen to find our where our meals were... She disappeared. Finally found a manager and was told they ran out of the market soup and had to make a new batch... Come on... Just be honest!As for the bubby's matzah ball soup... It def makes my hall of fame... Coming from a long line of matzah ball soup makers (yes, from scratch!) this is the most authentic I have ever tasted outside of my kitchen! Hence the 3 stars ... 2 taken off for my poor service and my citrus arugula and fennel salad didn't have a speck of fennel in it!

Unfortunately, it was fried, so while it tasted good, you didn't feel nearly as healthy as you should eating a veggie burger.    The entire meal for the table was very pricey, so that is a bit of a downside.

As for the bar and the service provided there, it was poor by any standard. The bartender didn't seem to notice or really care that people on our end of the bar needed service. She seemed to be too busy chatting with her friends at the other end of the bar.  Examples: (1) one patron took 10 mins to get his check; (2) we couldn't get eye contact, let alone menus for over 5 minutes, even though it was not that busy; (3) we couldn't even pay easily when we realized this was a bust. It felt like we were being deliberately ignored. As for the drinks, she didn't even ask how we wanted them, and they showed up disappointingly small. I wanted mine neat but received a small tumbler with the drink on the rocks. Too bad, because we really wanted to like this place. Instead, we just felt unwelcome.",,,

Once our table was available we got a text and were seated immediately. The options on the menu are endless. And so many vegetarian options as well!

106,Megan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",192,200,27,4.0,2/13/2017,"So good, I'll easy pay the $25 cab fare and deal with high line tourist to eat here. The biscuits are SO fresh, flaky, warm and delicious. After ordering my meal I saw another table ordered just a basket of biscuits I almost ordered one for myself. Shame be damned I could and would sit there for an hour just eating that basket of biscuits. Unfortunately for me the tiniest bit of self restraint showed up that day (of all the days!) My eggs were poached perfectly and the grits were done to perfection. The only issue I will note with my meal is that our food managed to make it out before our drinks. My friend and I ordered at once, but normally at a packed restaurant the food is what takes the longest, so we received our drinks about mid way thought the meal, so no need to put that order in early. The food doesn't take very long.",,1,
107,Yesenia R.,"Elizabeth, NJ",1,7,0,4.0,8/18/2018,"BUBBYYYYY'S. The food here is simply amazing. The coffee is also great. My fav dish is the Bubby's breakfast. Their biscuits are delicious, but I wish they were more flexible with letting you order one instead of having to order two for $6 or four for $10 or something like that. They don't let you sub toast for one biscuit even if you offer to pay for it. The staff is ok, mostly millennials, some tend to be a little rude and have attitudes. Overall a great place to eat. Awesome for brunch obviously.",,,
108,Anthony F.,"Bronx, NY",23,5,1,1.0,2/13/2018,"Honestly, I'm not sure what the food is like. Based on the reviews, it's probably good BUT when the place is half empty and the hostess refuses to accommodate my wife and I with a bigger table, that's a problem. My wife immediately started to feel constricted at our small table and we decided to leave. We went across the street to SANTINA and they accommodated us with a much larger table. Needless to say, I'll never go to Bubby's again.",,1,
109,Dimitria P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,60,13,4.0,1/15/2017,In love with bubbys. The only reason I took off a star is because we just discovered the biscuits contain lard. What a disappointment for those who are kosher or veggie. The green juice with vodka is amazing and the deviled eggs are delish.

It was around $23 and the portions were huge. Unfortunately I don't think it was as tasty as I thought it was going to be. I'm not a picky eater but for some reason the chicken tasted really bland on the inside and I was disappointed. The coleslaw and fried onion strings were honestly just average. I was super excited about this meal but didn't even eat half of it. Also tried their Mac & cheese and it was very average as well. However, their cocktail the honey bizz is amazing and I would drink it everyday if I could",,,

Updated review","You have unique choices here with a nice selection for a breakfast/brunch meal. Would strongly recommend the curried chicken salad sandwich with arugula, chicken, curry, apples, pistachio, raisins and mayo on a grilled loaf.  Also the avocado toast is pretty tasty. Homemade sodas served in mason jars are flavorful and not overly sweet. Both good selections with a few others that look worth trying. Prices are a little high, but maybe not for manhattan. Busy place so you may have to wait during prime time dining hours. The service was efficient and the option for outside dining is available when weather permits. Bathroom isn't big enough and there appears to be a continual wait line for it. Would come back again.",,,

It was good. We also got some other cocktails and mix drinks - some good and some just so-so. Their 50/50 martini was solidI am taking off points for how freaking loud the music is in this place.

The biscuits are cooked perfectly: crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. My dad got the Chicken Fried Steak, which he said was good. Bubby's has a strict substitution rule FYI. He couldn't sub the collard greens for mac & cheese, so he ordered it as a side and I'm glad he did because it was so yummy. My Bubby's Burger was OK. It wasn't cooked quite the way I ordered but it was fine. It comes with fries and a pickle for $19. My bf ordered the Fried Chicken Dinner, which in my opinion was the real winner of the night.

125,Danielle C.,"New York, NY",79,62,6,1.0,11/28/2017,"Wow, I've dined at Bubby's for brunch for years and have always left feeling very content and happy but boy, Thanksgiving Dinner was an entirely different experience.  What a HUGE disappointment!  I should have known after I'd informed a friend that I'd be dining at Bubbys for Thanksgiving and he quickly told me that he'd done the same the year prior but that there simply wasn't enough food.  Why didn't I listen?! I decided to make a reservation at  Bubby's after seeing the variety of Thanksgiving Day food items being served. The price was a bit steep at $75pp BUT they had something for everyone on the menu and it's Thanksgiving, so I get it.Once we arrived, we waited approximately 15 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, the appetizers were quickly served.  So far so good and there was just enough food for both my mother and I.  Shortly afterwards, the main dinner arrived.  This was where the problem began.   The turkey, ham and stuffing was all served on ONE individual sized plate (NOT a platter) and this was supposed to be shared.  I asked the waitress if she could send over at least one slice of ham, rather than the few pieces of diced up ham that was on the plate. Fortunately the waitress agreed that there was very little ham and quickly came out with 3 slices.  I was appreciative however the problem didn't end here. The portion sizing was just completely off with the entire main meal.   There was only enough stuffing for one person.  The green beans and potatoes were each served in individual, ""side style"" small bowls, again NOT meant for sharing but we were expected to share.  There was also mashed potatoes + sweet potatoes that were placed on the same dish but fortunately the dish was a reasonable size and there was enough for both of us.  Cranberry sauce was also served but again, in a tiny side dish bowl and was 1/4 full. Basically my mother and I were only able to share the potatoes.  Everything else, there simply wasn't enough to share and if there was, there was a few bites for each of us.  Again, I was able to get a serving of ham but when I'd asked for an additional ""scoop"" of stuffing, the answer was no.  Dessert was plentiful.  Several slices of pie for each of us...too much but I wasn't complaining considering we'd been ripped off from our main entree.Let me just say that my mother and I are not enormous cows.  I am 5'7 and weigh 145 lbs.  My mother is 5""6 and weighs 165.  When I think of Thanksgiving dinner, I think of leaving FULL or at least content and happy.  Well not at Bubby's!   We left feeling SO disappointed and price raped.  I'd even spoken to the very kind manager, Jason.  I'd explained to him I'd dined at Bubby's for years for brunch and always loved it but not this time around.  He told us they've been serving brunch for 26 years and got that down to a science but that serving Thanksgiving dinner was still somewhat new.  He said he welcomed the feedback and would get the information back to the people who needed to hear it, yet he let us walk out of the restaurant feeling disappointed and did nothing.  I just don't get it!?!? By no means was I expecting a free or discounted dinner but SOMETHING would have been better than doing nothing at all.  How about a 10% coupon for the next visit??  How about a glass of wine on the house? Dinner was supposed to be my mothers treat but I felt so bad and so guilty after the experience that I told her I'd take care of it....",1,,

131,Monica F.,"Manhattan, NY",157,177,127,3.0,10/14/2016,"Not a good place to come on a weekend if you don't want to wait an hour or more. There is no waiting area, so if it's winter I also assume you'd be waiting outside. This made traffic at the door particularly bad and I think stressed out the hostesses a lot because people were constantly in and out checking on their tables and then obviously people walking in and out to leave or to be seated. They took our number to text us when our table was ready, but when we came to check because it had been a while, they were extremely rude asking why we hadn't shown up yet. It turns out they had taken our number down wrong, thus texting not my number, so I had no way of knowing the table was ready. Either way, no reason for attitude. Trust me, I did not want to wait outside smelling food for no reason....Was not a fan of the set up at all - with such a long wait, I couldn't understand why there was a giant spot in the middle with no tables or anything. Also, we were seated next to the bar and it felt like that was the path all of the wait staff took to bring customers their food, place orders at the kitchen and all of the customers walked that way to go to the bathroom. It felt like we were constantly being brushed by, which made it really unpleasant to eat and felt like we could get spilled on at any second. The food itself (and menu in general) had a lot of potential. However, my eggs Benedict were served cold (like so cold I thought maybe it was on purpose - did not feel like it was possible to get that cold just from sitting out). The flavor was good though, but just generally unpleasant to eat cold eggs. It was also just generally loud, but since I personally don't prefer that, but some people might not mind, I won't hold that against the restaurant itself. Overall, felt like a lot of hype for not that great of a spot! Maybe I'll try again during the week when I assume it's less crazy!",1,,1

The fried chicken was dry, with messily cut kale stems getting stuck in my teeth. The pancakes were saved by Nutella, but you can definitely make those at home in less than the 40 minutes we waited for our food.

Bubby's is known for their pretty standard American brunch fare - apparently they've been serving brunch every single day since 1990.  That's cool.  Brunch menu is mostly composed of eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries, grits, pancakes, burgers, and salads.  I usually go with one of the combination plates (bubby's breakfast, griddle special, grits breakfast) so you get a bite of several different things.  I've never been for dinner so can't speak to that! Unlimited coffee, just-interesting-enough cocktails, and of course, a few pies (apple, sour cherry, chocolate peanut butter, banoffee).  Everything is just standard - not bad, but also nothing to write home about.The most interesting thing about this location is the Ample Hills outpost if you're craving some delicious ice cream.  The special flavor here is called ""floating over the high line.""  It's like a root beer float - root beer flavored ice cream with chocolate and marshmallows.  Good if you like those flavors!",2,,

We had to ask for water, along with utensils. Yes, after we ordered and the appetizers came out I had to walk up and ask the nice busboy for forks and knives. Now the only reason why I'm giving it a two star was due to the food being pretty good. I know NYC can never make ribs like Texas but I enjoyed it along with the biscuits which were delicious. The server who was a young lady just was not at all interested in our company. Probably due to us being really dressed down not realizing that we make more than her. The icing on the cake was that a small group of three came in after the kitchen was ""closed"" and I saw them receive stellar service. I asked the nice busboy ""if that group was someone famous or well known?"" He responded no they were regular customers why? I then said ""oh I was told the kitchen is closed, and the server seems to be very attentive towards the table"".

The first red flag was that the place smelled literally like mothballs inside so we asked to be sat outside. The hostess had her pants unzipped so we told her that ""her barn door was open"". Kinda funny and nbd. However, what wasn't funny was the food: they were out of their best item: the biscuits. Really? I ordered a drink from their limited menu, and they were out of that too. The fresh squeezed orange juice was really good, the eggs were really good, but their pancake was just okay and not quite cold but not quite hot. Their restroom was filthy. And the bill was outrageously expensive. We won't be back, we are disappointed this place slid so far down hill. If you don't believe this and accordingly take heed, then you are sitting on your brains. The end.",,,
154,Brandon T.,"Greenlawn, NY",190,1,0,1.0,12/28/2017,The WORST service. The Waiter (Christian N) was extremely rude and tipped himself over 20% on my gf's credit card. Food mediocre and overpriced. I ordered the ribs which were bone try and not tasty at all. Creamy mashed potatoes were NOT creamy and dry as well. Sautéed Brusselsprouts were not cooked enough. The sauce i chose with my ribs was called a Texas BBQ sauce for my ribs and it was more like a sweet mustard taste in a tiny cup and they charge you extra $3 for another tiny cup. The Peruvian chicken my girlfriend ordered was tasty but still NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN,2,,

159,Elizabeth H.,"Herndon, VA",0,10,0,1.0,7/24/2018,"I went to Bubby's with high expectations to have a great breakfast and to have a nice time. The food was good, not great. My son had the fried chicken with pancakes and I had the Bubby's Breakfast. My food was ordinary, not justifying the price. My son's fried chicken was juicy and plentiful. The coffee lacked body and was acidic. I would not have minded that except. WHAT I DO MIND AND THE REASON I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR is that they selectively seat certain groups of minorities in the back near the bathroom. We walked in and even though the dining room was nearly empty, we were seated at the very back table near the bathroom and away from the windows. Service was nonexistent. The one person next to us turned out to be an employee who stood up and walked to the kitchens when we were seated. As groups walked in, they were seated in the front and by the windows. An Asian couple walked in and they too were seated near us even though tables were still available in the front. Another Asian man was seated at the bar. I have noticed this in a few other restaurants and I refuse to go back.",,,

I'll start off by saying that our waitress was super nice & helped us with our food selection. She didn't seem annoyed no matter how indecisive we were LOL.  To start off we had blood orange mimosas. We got biscuits for the table, OMG sooo good! Definitely a must have. We also had mac & cheese to share which had bacon in it! (Anything with bacon is automatically good) Then we each had the breakfast sampler plate, eggs, a pancake & home-fries. Everything was so good!! I love the style of the restaurant itself. There's art hung everywhere & it's a busy place but you don't feel rushed or forgotten about. The service was great. They share space with Ample Hills Creamery, perfect if you have room for some ice cream after your meal (we didn't haha) I also never walked the high line & it's right across the street!

Burger ordered according to the menue was 21 dollars but was invoiced with 26 dollars later on. The waitress told me there is a printing error and asked me if she should have told me. She than asked if she should take the price off which I agreed. However the only thing she did was taking 5% off the invoice what equaled roughly 3 Dollars.

168,Kim R.,"Coto de Caza, CA",0,2,0,4.0,4/7/2018,"Great breakfast/brunch place. The home fries are some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Pancakes are good, but it's nearly impossible to eat all three of your own. Either get the griddle plate or share an order of three. They're thick and fluffy and very delicious. However, my only con would be the atmosphere. It's cramped and very loud. The tables are pushed so closely together, it's very hard to navigate. We went on a Saturday morning and got quite a wait, 30 minutes for a party of 3. So be prepared for a bit of a wait when you arrive. Overall, very good breakfast. Great Arnold Palmer too.

Don't worry though, as Bubby's has an ingenious text message waiting system so you can wander the area and discover something awesome whilst they keep track of your place in line.The staff here are super friendly,  the atmosphere relaxed but distinctly touristy. Not necessary a bad thing but does push the prices up.We came here for breakfast and had the pancakes which were ok, but nothing to write home about. I also had an egg cream soda, which some people seemed to love although it was way too sweet and artificial tasting for me. Still, Bubby's is a great place to refuel after walking the New York High Line. Think of this as part of the experience and you'll probably be able to justify paying for the overpriced food.Have fun!",,,

183,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",135,109,261,5.0,9/29/2015,"Hands down best place to grab brunch in NYC. Conveniently located right under the high line it can get pretty touristy, and it can also explain their expensive prices. However, this place is absolutely worth it! You walk in and you automatically feel like you're not in New York City anymore, maybe a small little town in Vermont or somewhere up north. Every condiment on the table is homemade, and they claim to have the best coffee in New York. I can't answer if it was the best or not, but my iced coffee in a cute little mason jar was pretty solid. For the food - the pancakes are probably the best I've ever had. Like wow. Doused in a blueberry sauce and finding more blueberries as I cut through the pancakes, I was in blueberry heaven. Obviously the enormous portion preventing me from finishing them, but I did enough damage. I imagine this place gets pretty packed during normal brunch hours so I recommend going during the week if you don't feel like waiting. Go Bubby's!",1,,

185,Haley A.,"Hollywood, FL",31,60,59,5.0,8/8/2016,"As my title would suggest, Bubby's is not for the faint-hearted dining experience. You must enter HUNGRY if you are going to appreciate not only the quantity, but quality, of the plate you will be presented. After my 1st dining experience here, i left to walk the High Line in a cloud of satiated joy.Let me begin my experience from the beginning. This was my 1st ever trip to NY. I was basically letting my feet do the planning with some Pinterest points to guide me. While wandering around the Meatpacking district and checking out the local art Bubby's presented itself (through sight and smell!). We were informed there was a wait and got slightly disheartened to the point where we were going to just try a cheap diner down the street. But as luck would have it, we got the call for our table while debating on the sidewalk if we wanted every day cheap...or a real NY experience. I am SO SO glad we did not go the cheap route!!The restaurant was PACKED (it was a Saturday morning). I mean i had a huge camera bag as well as purse for my daily adventure and i felt like i was in everybodys way trying to get to our table. It's a very intimate space full of morning chatter - so if you're looking for a serene dining experience choose wisely!Our waiter was prompt and brought us water in the cutest jars - nice little kitschy touch. The menu had amazing brunch options but this breakfast lover here went directly for the Eggs Benedict. I'm not going to lie...the price almost hurt my feelings. But the plate that was presented to me (picture attached, it was THAT beautiful) made it SO worth it. I switched the house salad option for their home fries (thank you for letting me substitute without a grimace or face of doubt). I had no clue what i was getting myself into!! Had i known, i wouldn't have had our late dinner and made sure my stomach was ready for this heaven-sent meal LOL!! The biscuits are TO DIE FOR. Like...i want to go back just to have more of those fluffy little pillows of southern perfection *dreaming*. Paired with thick-cut bacon, perfect eggs, and the home fries i was in fat kid heaven. I tried sooo hard to finish the plate because i did not want to waste such perfect food! I honestly don't remeber what my husband got, but i know it was good because he cleaned the plate in silence. Will definitely be back the next time i'm in NY!",2,,1
186,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,4.0,7/26/2014,"This review is just based on my impressions of their dessert. After gorging ourselves at nearby Chelsea Market, we made our way to Bubby's through the rain. It was one of the few places serving dessert past 10pm in the area. We tried three different sweet treats: homemade mint ice cream, black cow (ice cream soda) and a hot cherry pie & chocolate sundae. Their homemade ice cream is reminiscent of the stuff you can get at the Meatball shop. It's pretty damn delicious. I really enjoyed the ice cream soda - the black cow has some of their homemade soda which tastes like a cross between root beer and coke. The sundae was the crown jewel of our dessert feast. First of all it's huge and can easily satisfy three to four people. Hiding underneath the chocolate ice cream, mounds of whipped cream is WARM cherry pie. Heavenly stuff.",1,,

We had the vegetarian chili, which was really great and hearty, the nachos, which were probably the best and fanciest nachos I've ever had (with radishes and I want to say feta or goat cheese,) and the ceasar salad, which was a bit disappointing and soggy.But overall I had a great meal, and the waitress was extremely friendly and the ambiance was nice.",2,1,
188,Jennifer P.,"New York, NY",2,20,4,2.0,3/10/2017,"We live just around the corner from this place which makes me want to like it a lot more (I'd love to have another nice local place to pop in to regularly), but I can't because of the following: - Service - inconsistent, slightly rude, and in one case, the server made a huge error (totally got my husband's order wrong) and acted like it wasn't her fault.  We should have just taken the food they brought out because the actual item we ordered was not good. -  Music volume.  Come on people.  It's a Wednesday night, like 745 and the place has like 5 tables.  There is NO NEED to blast the music at volume 10.  I asked if they could turn it down, and they did for about 5 minutes and then I saw a bartender walk over and turn it right back up higher than before.  I was sitting right next to my husband and could barely hear him and I'm guessing that is why the server got our order wrong too. There is also something really depressing about a totally empty place that has music blasting...it just seems a bit desperate (We are having fun, right?!?!  RIGHT!?!?!) - Food was decent quality, but the prices are really high for the caliber of ambiance and service that you get here. I give this restaurant about a year before it closes, especially because the Meatpacking district is just empty of storefronts and shops right now because of the endless construction in the area.",3,1,

Last night, we took some out of town friends to enjoy a plate of plain ole', down home, yummy southern food. In the past, it has always done just that-provided good comfort food right when we needed it. Well...last night was A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. We show up and our server, in the middle of taking our orders, just leaves and runs behind the bar. he comes back shortly and continues with taking our orders, no explanation given. OK..weird..but not the biggest deal. He took our orders and mentioned it was his 2nd day. That explains his action. again let me say, not a big deal. We ordered the Blistered Shishito Peppers and Biscuits to start with. The peppers were fine..eh, nothing special. The biscuits..OH THE BISCUITS..they came out VERY toasted (aka Burnt). We didnt send them back-they were fine in the middle so we ate them. Then...our main course comes. We all ordered the fried chicken platters. Ours with a side of fries and our guests ordered a side of waffles. The fried chicken platters comes with a Breast, a leg, and a thigh. ALL THE PIECES WERE ALMOST BURNT. This food was extremely under par of this restaurant. I was appalled. We brought our friends here to enjoy a perfect meal and we got poor food. Are we going to go back here? doubt it. It certainly wont be our go-to place to bring our out of town friends anymore. Something should be done about the poor quality of the food at the this Highline Location before it ruins the reputation of Bubbys...",6,2,1

Shorthanded staff on a lovely Friday June evening resulted in long delays (40 minutes to get drinks and appetizers; another hour before food arrived). Food was awful. Artichoke dish was stringy and presented in a very unappetizing manner; steak overcooked and tough, baked potato lukewarm and tasteless, etc. Despite apologies from hostess (who deducted the cost of drinks from our tab), the entire experience from start to finish was amateurish. The atmosphere was bustling and our waiter was literally running from table to table. We were told that only one cook had shown up and it was evident that whoever prepared our meal was not trained either with the cooking or presentation skills of an establishment that would charge $39 for a strip steak!Don't waste your time or money at this place!",1,3,1

Yes, $2 for a slice of American cheese on a plate. I also ordered the burger medium rare. What I received was a brown, overcooked, basically meatloaf patty with lettuce and tomato on a stale bun. Yep, I paid $21 for that.There are so many better options in the area for food, so definitely avoid this place unless you're just getting drinks. I can honestly say this was the worst burger I've ever had and I never write negative reviews.Also beware that the wait staff charges your card with a portable device right in front of you and then watches as you select the tip. I'm not complaining about that but you should be aware of that little trick that results in more tips.",,,

196,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,3/3/2014,"Pretty typical yuppie brunch in Chelsea. We arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday, and only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table of two. There were lots of couples and kids, so while it might be good for groups, you might want to hold your large scale booze brunches elsewhere. We ordered the burger and the eggs florentine. Our water refills and drinks weren't coming too fast, but it was pretty busy, so we were more forgiving. Our food also took about 40 minutes, but again, feeling forgiving. We then found a hair in the eggs florentine, but the waiter was very apologetic and got us a new dish. We were growing a little impatient, but the food more than made up for it. The burger was delicious, cooked just right, and the fries were crispy and salted just right. Eggs were cooked right (minus the hair), and came with a large side salad and 4 pieces of toast. Even though it's a bit pricier, the portion sizes are definitely a bit larger. After we were done, the waiter apologized for everything going slowly and the hair in the food, so he comped us a free slice of peanut butter chocolate pie. Boy, was that pie rich and delicious. The peanut butter is definitely a bit more amped up than the chocolate, but overall, the ratio felt just right. After that, the waiter then comped us another slice of apple pie for the road. What a way to work for that tip. Can't blame him though, he did what he could to remedy the situation, and in the end, we were satisfied. Dunno if I'd pay the $8 per slice normally, but it is very good.Overall, the food is delicious, well-portioned, albeit a bit on the pricier side. I will definitely add this to the list of better brunch places in the city. Also, the concept of midnight brunch intrigues me, and although I don't hang out on the West side that often, I'll keep that in the back of my mind.",1,,1

A large corner space on Washington and Gansvoort. The staff is very friendly and welcoming here. It is still kinda a secret as they opened recently. I have been here twice in the last two weeks, which for me means a lot. Last night I had dinner and I don't remember any of the Bubby's being this flippin' great.The purveyor list is on the menu and it is extensive and reflected in the food. They make bread, pies, ice-cream, bagels- WOW!I went with spicy cider- soooo spicy good. A special of cornmeal encrusted trout with potatoes and cherry peppers was just on point perfection. The spicyness of the vinegar cherry peppers offset the fish and potatoes. That was $26 and well worth it. House-made,Rocky road Ice-cream for dessert, one of the reasons I came back so soon. Also, love the cupcakes and the Krinish- get it KRINISH- all Delish!",2,1,2

199,Neha A.,"Rochester, MI",21,34,14,5.0,11/23/2015,I love Bubby's!!! Had a delicious lunch here. I ordered the burger which was juicy and came with yummy thin fries. My friend ordered the fried chicken and biscuits which was AMAZING! Writing this right now is making my mouth water. Some of the best fried chicken we had ever had! The biscuits were also spectacular with the homemade butter and jam. Portions are huge and the restaurant has a nice vibe to it. We also had a Bloody Mary and one of the house sodas which were also great. We ended up spending about $80 on lunch but it was worth it! Will definitely return! Get the fried chicken and be prepared for large portions!,,,
