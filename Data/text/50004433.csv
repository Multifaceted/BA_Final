0,Steve A.,"Hilliard, OH",852,1390,1959,4.0,5/7/2018,"Dali Market is so convenient. It has a salad bar, and basic food and gifts. This place will get you in and out. It's nice to get served for once. This is why I would choose this. It has a setup like many other Manhattan markets. It has a hot buffet and salad bar. There's also a counter to order sandwiches. It's not fantastic food but it's better than expected. The service is also much better than many similar markets. It's infinitely better than Cafe Hestia. Unlike that place, this place actually helps me. A good choice if you're in a hurry. Buffet food is fresh and hot. The sandwiches are made to order but not too long to make these.",1,,
1,Audrey V.,"Orlando, FL",277,22,34,5.0,9/23/2018,"Perfect place for some late night drunk munchies. Got the most magical dark chocolate bar thing, don't even know what it was tbh but it was the fudgiest best chocolate dessert I've ever experienced. We bought 4 of them. Then went back & bought a chicken fajita flatbread thing.... another 10/10. I would've grabbed another if my Uber wasn't arriving. They also have tons of drinks and grab & go snacks. If you're drunk and hungry.... go here. Cool foreign staff too. Great NYC experience.",,,
2,Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",205,509,2651,4.0,1/18/2017,"This place is not bad for a quick lunch. I got some salad, pulled pork, and mushrooms.  It costed me only $6 and I was pretty full for a few hours. Everything tasted pretty good and not salty, unlike some other similar delis.",2,1,2
3,Jaimie L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,61,7,2.0,1/9/2017,"Stopped by this deli for some flowers because they had such a beautiful selection, but was extremely disappointed to find out that their service is terrible. I picked out a few flowers to make a bouquet for a friend who was getting engaged and took it to the register as signs instructed. I paid $39 for 4 different types which was a decent price, but when I asked them to wrap the flowers up with tissue paper, the person who helped us had put the tissue paper really low so the flowers were completely sticking out. I asked them to redo it so the flowers didn't stick out so much so they took some of the clear wrapping paper and taped it over the flowers. Never seen anything like it and it made my $39 so not worth it. I had to pull it all apart myself and redo it all together.All in all- good selection, but no good service!",,,
4,Nick H.,"Denver, CO",0,6,2,5.0,9/2/2017,"I stopped by here on my way home from work to pick up some flowers for my fiancé. She mentioned she wanted some white flowers for our apartment. They had a few different bouquets of all white flowers outside and I grabbed one and went inside to pay. I saw they had some bouquets with a few white roses but nothing with all white. Right before I paid for the flowers, I asked the lady at the register if they put together arrangements by request. She said she'd call the flower guy and ask. He came over and said what would you like? I said all white roses. He asked if I wanted a dozen and when I asked the price he said $15! I said ok and he went up stairs to put together the arrangement. I paid before even seeing what he put together. About 5 minutes he walked down with a beautiful arrangement. Amazing service and great price!",2,,
5,Maggie L.,"New York, NY",169,274,454,4.0,9/17/2015,"I frequent Dali Market quite often because my office is right around the corner.  For that reason, as well as its uber quick service, Dali is perfect for a busy day that allows no time for a stroll nor time to hunt for the perfect bite.  However, there are also days like today when I want some alone time with some good food and flavored iced coffee, and hence opt to select a few items from the hot buffet area and take a few flights up to the small seating area upstairs to people watch and observe how busy the Penn area can get.  Their buffet usually includes fruits, apple & arugula salad which I love, Caesar salad, salmon, sole, beef, veggies, shrimp, chicken, seaweed salad, etc. (varying by day) and is fairly balanced and diverse for one who may possess a pickier palette.  They also make sandwiches to order and have boxed sushi, salads and sandwiches for those on a run.  Their soup selections are decent as well.  I've had the split pea, clam chowder, chicken noodle and pumpkin, all of which were delicious and comforting to the soul.They don't have as many selections as Cafe Hestia, which is where I go to when my day DOES allow more time, but this is a smaller business and it offers whatever it can with its resources, nothing fancy shmancy, which I appreciate.  All in all, it provides me with what I need and I will be here for as long as they are.",,,
6,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,3.0,9/5/2016,"Went here to grab a bite to eat on a Friday afternoon on my way to catch a train. Unlike the market across the street, this place was not too busy. I decided to go with the reuben on a hero.The sandwich itself was pretty large and had a lot of meat, especially considering it rang in at just under $10. The meat had good flavor, but was not the most tender I have had. In addition, some of the ingredients weren't distributed evenly so it made for a bit of a haphazard flavor experience.Overall, this place is a decent quick, cheap place to grab a bite just outside the craziness that is Penn Station.",,,
7,Lisa M.,"Rockland County, NY",236,103,363,4.0,7/30/2016,"If you're on 34th & just can't make a decision on a place to eat, you should definitely try this place out. It is pricey but completely worth it. Their hot foods are delicious and fulfilling. They also have a seating area upstairs which is totally convenient for shoppers who want to take a break and grab a bite.",4,1,1
8,Krystal Y.,"Long Island, NY",591,122,222,4.0,4/21/2015,"I come here quite often to get lunch since I work right across the street. It's usually pretty busy and packed but lines move quick and they make your food fast.Sometimes I feel like Im standing in the stampede from the Lion King (thats how crazy it gets sometimes!!)They have a nice selection of hot and cold foods, the sandwiches and salads are great!The staff are friendly and try their best to keep the lines flowing.Defining stop by here and grab lunch if you're in the area!",4,1,3
9,Michelle D.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,35,36,4.0,3/31/2015,"I always come in and check out the hot food if it's around lunch time. I know it's fresh and just recently put out. I will always get lunch here if they have the brisket. It's so good ! I love how the meat is cut and how its made in this sauce. It's a must try !They also offer made to order sandwiches and salads as well as anything grilled. I havent tried any of their sandwiches, although they do look tasty and there's always a line of regulars around lunch time. They have a pretty cool salad bar variety and I really like the spinach with apple shreds. If I ever crave some fruits, which is usually during the summer. I'll opt for a lighter lunch and make my own fruit salad. They cut these fruits fresh daily and it's nice that I choose the fruits that I want. During the warmer days they will have premade fruit salads ready to buy outside. I love the egg salad here as well as the $1 rolls with butter. So good and inexpensive. I'm not the only one who fancies the rolls. I always, catch someone on the line eating one as they are paying. I wish I didn't carry as many bags into the office so I could do the same lol.Great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love the staff here as well. Always pleasant to be greeted with a smile.",2,1,2
10,Lee M.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",3,186,38,5.0,2/26/2017,I order for group lunches and trust them to put together a nice platter. Happy with the selection and prices. They also have one of the better fast morning breakfast guys. Friendly and fast!,,,
11,Pedro M.,"Bayonne, NJ",85,39,8,4.0,2/23/2017,"I work at the Macys next door and frequently eat here for lunch. For the most part I enjoy their food and selection of snacks and drinks. I mean the hot bar is sub par but for a quick lunch it's not half bad. Had one weird experience though. I went to eat with a coworker and the person working in the deli section refused to make us a bacon egg and cheese sandwich because ""it wasn't breakfast"". We complied at first because that's typical when you eat at places. We get it, the food is probably stored away wrapped up nice and tight to be cracked open the next morning....cool. However, why was there a bacon egg and cheeseburger on the menu? So we asked if we can have that order with everything except the beef...still said no. Ridiculous. I still eat here almost every day I don't bring lunch. Or across the street at Al's.",,,
12,Devashis R.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,239,135,4.0,11/16/2014,"Dali Market was a great lunch find for me while I was working around the area. I gravitated towards the pay per pound lunch buffet option rather than counter items. They had a great selection of hot foods and salads/veggies. A few items were regulars, but they did change it up enough to keep it interesting. Decent selection for vegetarians and a couple/three seafood items.I always went around 2pm or so to avoid the lunch rush. There were still plenty of choices and the food still looked fresh. They have seating upstairs, which can be easy to miss when walking in and out. Also, the price per pound is about $0.50 cheaper than surrounding buffets. A nice added bonus.They have gelato, but I've never indulged.",,,
13,H. H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,1,1.0,1/4/2017,"It's just a deli / bodega that's not worth even half a star. I used to come here for breakfast. However, the service here is horrible. The bagel boy always refers to his customers as ""buddy."" He seems to make absolutely no eye contact and no smiles either.The price of the breakfast is about the only good thing. They're cheap. The cashiers robotically take your money and go about their business. If you want a nice pit stop for cheap and mediocre food then this is not the worst place.",,,
14,Corinthia J.,"South Ozone Park, NY",5,10,2,1.0,4/22/2015,First of all the hot food is delicious. The burgers are really good. So that's a star. This place is overpriced and disgusting though.  The breakfast sandwiches are gross. It never fails. Every time I eat at this place I get sick or i find something in my food. I would not recommend you to come here.Once I ordered a vanilla latte and they gave me hot chocolate and when I tried to switch it the cashier almost made a big scene about it. Also this place has over charged me for items many times. If you order from here ALWAYS ask for your receipt back even though they do not itemize which makes it easy for them to take advantage of you.  Don't bother coming here.  Try Al's across the street.,3,,
15,Tashanna J.,"JAMAICA, NY",21,80,25,1.0,11/6/2013,"My first and last time coming here. I work overnight at Macy's and since this place is right next door I decided to buy some strawberries. While exiting I saw that my change was short $5 and turned around while still in the store and politely informed the cashier he gave me the wrong change, he got nasty with me refused to give me my money back. Everyone here has an attitude trust me, your not missing anything by passing this place.",1,,
16,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",808,1305,3040,2.0,5/23/2013,"Rip off central.The hot foods are a steal. An egg and cheese on a roll for less than $3? Yes, please.I came in ravaging for a snack. I got to the counter with an odawalla smoothie and 3 candy bars (to save for later, of course). A whopping $16. Ridiculous.",2,,
17,Michael W.,"Manhattan, NY",1355,597,1222,3.0,2/17/2013,"I was taking a bartenders bootcamp class across the street from this market - you know the ones on Living Social where they advertise ""actual price"" as something ludicrous but know the real price is the 80$ they charge, still not a bad deal. Anyway I stopped by here on my lunch break for the 6-hour x 2 days course and got a vegetarian panini and a very small portion of pasta salad. The food was decent, although it is your standard made-in-the-AM and frozen throughout the day panini, which is then placed on a press and served in aluminum foil. It was everything I expected it to be: mediocre.What blindsighted me was the bill for 11$ for a half panini and small portion of salad. Crazy price for mediocre food. Needless to say I would not return here for lunch, maybe their breakfast specials are better - I did not bother to check.Also, I bought one lime and one small orange which rang up at 1.00$. Moral of the story is... Their markups are re-donk-ulous.Anyhue, it was convenient so what the hay.They also have gelato and other treats and the staff is friendly (at least the cashiers.)",1,1,
18,Jen M.,"Long Branch, NJ",5,19,3,4.0,4/17/2015,"Even though it can get crowded - the lines move super fast. I frequent often, usually getting the same things from the hot food bar. It's like eating a home cooked meal. It's weighed out by the pound, so you are paying for what you want. I have not had a single issue with this place. This place is super convenient being a short walk from my office. It's also very affordable even compared to other delis with food bars, so I'm not sure why people are saying otherwise. I spend between $4-7 on my lunch -- and I'm satisfied.",,,
19,Irene J.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,57,240,5.0,2/12/2016,"This is strictly for their hot/salad bar. Tasty food, much better and wider options than most midtown hot/salad bars. And I should know, as I have worked in midtown now almost 10 years and frequented a good percentage of the neighborhood delis. I haven't noticed it before but today, my weighted food ran about 9 dollars, rounded up, whereas in most midtown delis of same kind, my food comes out to 12, 13, 14 something dollars. I can't vouch for the lower price of this salad bar though, it could just be that today i opted for various fish selection with mostly veggie options, whereas usually I opt for lot of rice and or mashed potato or pasta, and or heavy meats.",,1,
20,Virginia Y.,"San Francisco, CA",1614,1444,4566,1.0,9/11/2014,Overpriced buffet lunch... If I had a choice I wouldn't come here. Also in the middle of eating it I saw something that looked like big legs. Least to say I tossed it out after that. Avoid at all costs.,1,1,
21,Alec A.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",13,8,3,5.0,5/18/2014,"I don't know what all this negative press here is about. ""Dali Market"" is one of the best, if not THE best deli, in Midtown West. Their breakfast sandwiches are the best I've had in New York. I've gotten the Turkey Bacon / Egg / Cheese sandwich so many mornings that they actually start making it for me when I walk in the door.Sure, the cold food and drinks are expensive but good luck finding anything cheaper in the area. People leaving negative comments about expensive prices are obviously tourists.",2,,
22,Nicolas A.,"Katy, TX",0,8,0,1.0,2/15/2016,An employee rudely told me to leave because I was looking around and hadn't bought anything yet. I used to buy things from here regularly but will not be coming back again.,,,
23,Alex S.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,1.0,5/13/2016,"The prices at this place are RIDICULOUS. Came in one night with my mother for a quick ""cheap"" meal and ended up paying $50 for a tiny portion or watermelon and pineapples, an orange juice and mashed potatoes with grilled chicken. I might as well went to apple bees and gotten the 2 for $26!!!!",,,
24,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,3.0,7/8/2012,"Didn't go in but they DO have gelato.  A modest selection but cheaper than what you'll pay at the ""fancy"" places & you won't have to stand in a long line for it.",1,,
25,Keisha F.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,21,0,2.0,1/2/2015,"This place should be better. Problem is they don't care. Every time I order something, some part of my order is wrong. They are also more expensive than they should be. The cooks rush even when they're not busy, causing you to get a luke warm or incorrect order. I wish it was better because it's right across the street from my job. But it's not so I'm going to stop going here.",,,

28,Danielle M.,"Bayside, NY",1,56,2,4.0,4/15/2014,"I can't say much about the food, I may have eaten hear once or twice. However, they have an amazing flower selection! Beautiful roses and flowers ranging from $3 to $20 (about $12 for a dozen roses). They are perfect for gifts and make a great presentation and last a long time! Also, they have a good selection of international candies, for instance they carry Crispie, which is a British candy! It can be expensive esp for fresh fruit, but over all I recommend this place!",,,
29,Angel L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,28,6,2.0,4/17/2014,"I've been the deli/market several times, conveniently close to my office.  I like that the prices are fair and there's a good selection of food.  However, I do not like how they treat paying customers and this really put me off.  I witnessed a paying customer ask for a cup for water and was flat out refused and they tried to sell him bottled water.  I  dont understand why they cant spare a cup for free water especially after the guy just paid for food! I dont want to frequent a place that doesnt value their customers.",,,
30,Vitaly T.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,68,54,2.0,8/26/2013,A somewhat decent deli on the borderline of mediocre. Low prices on many foods but so is the quality.

33,Norman B.,"Woodside, NY",2,33,9,4.0,8/8/2013,"Typically, the food establishments in and around the Herald Square area are mediocre at best - catering to the here and gone tourists; so they dont worry much about quality.This establishment I'll have to elevate up from mediocre, but no wow factor. It has a lot of stuff jammed into a small space..I went there 2 times, 2 weeks ago. First time I picked up some pork roast, mashed potatoes, corn and greens. Very good. I think about $15 with 20 oz coke. The second time, I picked up a turkey sandwich on a tomato and onion focaccia. Also very good. Could have used more mayo. Believe that was about $12 with a 20 oz soda.The salad bar is split into 2 separate tables, each about 4' x 8'. The place does get crowded fast AND has very tight aisle space, especially if you are in a wheel chair, or like me, on crutches. You may get jostled about, but customers were very apologetic. The owner, I think it was the owner, is extremely nice and helps us gimpy folk to the register with our selections.The second time I was there, they had 4 MASSIVE platters of differently prepared shrimp out; each had to be about 20"" x 12"" by at least 12"" high and piled on ice. Must have been a special on shrimp.WIll I go again? Yes.Street Parking? Good luck.Update, 10/11/13I have been there several more times now. Each time I swear the salad bar is half shrimp. Don't know where it comes from. Must be spending a fortune on it. Anyway, the sandwiches remain pretty good. Have a number of premades ready and waiting and a good selection of either 9 of 12 soups, none of which I have tried yet.Update 10/20/131. Its good place for breakfast, got 2 eggs with cheese on a bagel for $2.50. Good.2. The salad bar changes a bit on Sundays. Only 2 items have shrimp. A few more salad items. Always chicken cutlet with melted mozzarella cheese, sweet potatoes. They NEVER have salad dressing available at the bar; you have to request it from the salad maker. Either you get some in a condiment cup or he gives you the squirt bottle. If you ask for a foccicia, no, sorry, its reserved for sandwiches, but you can get HALF a roll.",,,
