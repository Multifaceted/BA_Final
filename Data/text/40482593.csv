0,Richard A.,"Branford, CT",20,353,657,4.0,9/17/2018,"What a great venue to see a show.  I have seen many here and there is not a bad seat in the house.  Parking is near by at the crown garage.  Just a short walk to the entrance. The staff is friendly and mostly volunteers. The seats are comfortable and not as tight as New York theaters.  The theater is well kept and looks beautiful. They are now booking many of the shows that are on Broadway, or just left . Great way to see them at a Lower price. Refreshments and bathrooms are conveniently located",,,
1,Joe K.,"Branford, CT",52,114,22,2.0,5/31/2018,"I went here to see nick dipaulo a few weeks ago with my dad and brother.  The seats are cramped, which I guess is normal for these theaters, but worth noting.  The sound was pretty crappy.  I was sitting about 25 feet from the stage and missed many of the things that were said because of the poor audio.  It wasn't until midway through the show, when nick requested that they raise the volume, that it got a little better.  Also, there were hecklers in the crowd that continuously disturbed the comedian.  Nothing was done about this.  After some back and forth with the theater they appeared to want to remedy the situation.  But they didn't follow through on their word. The theater is in a great location in downtown new haven, however, I don't think I will risk purchasing tickets to another show.",,,
2,Sandy W.,"Columbus, OH",48,441,636,5.0,12/13/2017,Beautiful theatre with great detail in architecture design. Seats are a bit tight but comfortable. Ushers were friendly and drinks were fairly priced. I don't think there's a bad seat in the house if your vision is good.,,,
3,Joe S.,"Marlborough, MA",0,194,0,3.0,10/7/2018,"the seats are small/tight HOWEVER its an old theater so it is what it is like others i thought that the sound quality could be lot better. the play, les miserables, was awesome but sound quality was so so.also, the view from Mezzanine Center Row D Seats 107 and 108 is great",,,
4,Joseph S.,"Wolcott, CT",9,110,202,3.0,2/15/2018,Shubert Theater is part of a New Haven history. It has been kept to look very much it may of looked many years ago. Ive gone here twice for events. Once for Demetri Martin and once for Daniel Tiger live. This is a great location for a comedian (close and personal) not so good for a live show. The stage is small and it limits what a live show can do. The chairs are outdated and not very comfortable. They remind me of 80s movie chairs. Also concessions are expensive. More than a movie theater. The ticket prices have to enough to not charge so much on concession pricing. I will go here again but with comedy shows only.,,,
5,Samantha M.,"New Haven, CT",299,288,26,5.0,11/3/2017,"Can't wait to go to another show here!! It's in a fabulous part of town, so it's easy to go out to dinner and then hop across the street to the theater. Good selection of shows, and the prices are reasonable. There are many bathrooms for such a small theater, so getting to the bathroom isn't normally too bad of a line even during intermission. They have multiple food stands as well to decrease the lines.",1,,
6,Nicholas G.,"East Haven, CT",197,101,100,4.0,10/1/2017,"A great experience and location. With all the restaurants nearby you can truly make a night of it. My wife had been asking to see a play for a while. We tried a few times when we were in NYC to get standby tickets, but it never worked out. I finally bought some tickets online for the Book of Mormon's Saturday evening performance and surprised my wife with dinner at her favorite restaurant (Zinc) and the play. We went out for dinner at 6:00 so we had plenty of time to have a great meal well before the curtain opened. We arrived at 7:20 or so and the doors to the house opened at 7:30. We picked up some candy (they have M&M's, Skittles, Recees, Goobers, Raisinettes, and Snow Caps). They also have beer, wine, and popcorn. On the second floor there is a little lounge area. We waited by some old movie seats. When the doors opened we were escorted to our seats. We were on the second of three levels. The seats were a little crammed. There was not much leg room. The view was good and we could easily see all the action from row D. The play was excellent -quick, funny, solid plot, strong character development. We then saw the cast walking to the train station as we headed home. For me, it reminded me that the actors have lives too.",1,,
7,Roberta S.,"Hamden, CT",0,11,0,5.0,9/25/2017,I went to the SHUBERT Saturday night in New Haven Connecticut  to see the performance DENO LIVES. I do have to say they did not look anything like Dean Martin Johnny Carson Marilyn Monroe or Peggy Lee but they did sound a lot like them the show was very good and the theater was packed. when I approached Dean Martin and I told him that I was associated with FRIENDS OF THE  SHUBERT  he asked me to write a review well I've been very honest and here is my review,,,
8,Diego A.,"Farmington, CT",8,106,28,3.0,7/14/2017,"It was alright. My friend said they would have food but I was disappointed. The drink my friend ordered was expensive and did not take like alcohol; watered down. 3$ for pop corn cups too. Seats were ok but little rigid. Not a lot of arm room either. It was hot and cold at times...temperature did not make up its mind. We went to see a drag show and it was fun, but nothing out of this world. A rowdy crowd. We left before the lines started to form during the end of the show... Wanted no delays in leaving. The staff were friendly at least. I would come back but I would probably not go to the concession stand again. I only got popcorn because I was hungry and missed my dinner time.",,,
9,Andrea Q.,"Clifton, NJ",159,89,258,5.0,4/9/2017,"After watching a show here in this theater, I feel like I would be more inclined to drive all the way to Connecticut versus watching another one in NYC! The people here are more friendly, it's clean, there are even activities to do while you wait for the show to start like playing shuffleboard and enjoying some cocktails out on their terrace! Heck, there's even a $2.00 raffle you can enter here. We watched Dirty Dancing and now I can't stop listening to the soundtrack and it was amazing I wish we could watch it again. We had orchestra seats and I know there are two levels above so I'm not sure how the view is up there. We were fortunate to have seats at the end of the row because the seats are very tight so you are snug here. We arrived an hour before the show but we got some snacks and we were able to charge our phone at the charging station. I was very happy that our bartender filled our wine cup to the brim! It's served in a to-go container with a lid so you can easily bring it into the theater with you. I bought a cup of popcorn for only $3 as well as the candy you could purchase was only $3, even cheaper than a movie theater and bigger than what you would buy from the grocery store! The popcorn didn't have any butter but it was salted so it still tasted good. We want to come back for the showing of Motown! We parked in the lot adjacent to the theater and it we were allowed to pre-pay for $8. We left our car there while we grabbed a bite to eat after the show and went to the Cushing Center (.5 mile walk away) so it was worth the price for the amount of time we left our car there for. One thing that I was sad that we didn't get to do was that the Shubert theater has a one hour free tour every First Wednesday and Saturday of the month. I would have loved to learn the history about this great venue. It was truly such a great experience!!!",1,1,1
10,Glenn G.,"Bethlehem, CT",21,120,0,2.0,11/26/2017,"The theater is nice with friendly staff. We went to the Santa Land Diaries, seating was tortuous. They really had nerve putting adults in the horrible wooden folding chairs that were zip tied together. I lost count of the number of people who left during the performance. There was no way to get comfortable. The performance was good, but who could really pay attention, everyone was crammed together and feeling so uncomfortable.",,,
11,Stephanie L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,2.0,8/15/2018,"Spent a million dollars to take my mom to see Bette Midler in Hello Dolly last night (which was an amazing and incredible show) at this theatre and it took so long to get in the door that they started the production before we were even seated (in the nosebleeds) and then had to shimmy by an obese person sitting on the end who wouldn't get up and called us ""stupid"" for having to pass her. At intermission, the bathroom line on the 3rd floor was so long that it went down the stairs to the 2nd floor and again, they started the performance before people were seated, there were at least 10 people still in line, which meant we didn't even sit down again (after again trying to shimmy past the obese woman) until the 3rd song and we missed the beginning of the 2nd act. Meanwhile, the usher was standing next to us watching the line the whole time with a walker talkie that she could have used to tell production to wait 5 mins. Not our fault it took your theatre way longer than it should have to do security check to get into the building or that there are only 2 bathrooms for the whole floor. To top it off, about a quarter of the performance is done at the front of the stage in front of the orchestra pit so from the rear mezzanine you can't even see Bette. I've been to hundreds of shows and never had these kinds of experiences, especially at the price they are charging.",,,
12,Kelly C.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",384,802,673,5.0,12/23/2016,"I love the Shubert! As a born-and-raised New Havener, I've seen more shows here than I can recall. Most recently, I went with my father to see Elf. The chairs at the Shubert are roomy and comfortable, although they could probably use some refurbishing. I always forget how small the Shubert is; there really isn't a bad seat in the house and you always have a good view of the stage. They do a good job of getting shows that fit everyone's tastes and ticket pricing is usually pretty competitive with other theaters. Parking can be difficult as e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e parks in the College St garage (meaning it can take a while to find a spot and even longer to exit), so I would suggest going for the garage down the street or even trying to find a spot near the Green. Lots of dining options within a block or two, so it's easy to grab a bite pre- or post-show.",,,1
13,Arthur M.,"Guilford, CT",479,694,2320,5.0,1/3/2015,"What a gem for New Haven! This historic theater (100 years and counting) retains much of its charming interior, from the private boxes and gigantic columns flanking the stage, to the beautiful lobby.We saw a Saturday matineé and experienced none of the traffic or parking issues reported by other reviewers. Other than the I-95 bridge that's been under construction for the past 50 years or so... (exaggeration, maybe!)There was event parking in the garage next door for a super reasonable $8. We found the ushers warm and inviting, and seats to be comfy with a good view of the stage and great sound. The show, Irving Berlin's White Christmas, started on time, the production (and casting!) exceeded my expectations.It was in all ways comparable to a Broadway show. A look back at the amazing performers (Julie Andrews, Sidney Poitier, etc) who have graced the Shubert stage confirms that it is truly a legendary theater!",,1,
14,Betsy R.,"Sacramento, CA",424,657,175,4.0,6/17/2016,Took my grandmother to see Kinky Boots at the Shubert. It's a small theater so it seems you can't really get a horrible seat. We had 2nd row mezzanine center so we had an excellent view of the stage. The location is pretty easy to get to but if you park next to the the theater - go for drinks after the show b/c it takes a long time to get out of there. We had dinner at a restaurant close by the validated in the Crown St Garage so we didn't have to pay but I think the fee was only $12.,1,1,1
15,Laura H.,"Stratford, CT",4,31,15,4.0,5/26/2017,"The only difference between this venue and any of the major venues on Broadway is the location in new haven. Everything else....the bad parking, the overpriced liquor, the slightly run down ""grand dame"" appearance of the theatre itself...the best surprise is the quality of the production s that run here. For example, I saw Jersey Boys both on Broadway and in new haven, and there was NO DIFFERENCE in the production caliber, both the sets and the actors. So spare yourself a trip to the bad apple and wait for the show to come closer to home.",,,
16,Kerry C.,"Middletown, CT",30,93,10,4.0,3/4/2017,"Lovely, intimate little theatre. I saw Riverdance perform here last night and they were incredible! There are three levels, and my favorite is the Orchestra. Seats are quite small though, so I'd suggest trying to get an end-seat if at all possible. Staff here is so helpful and friendly. You can tell they love working there. Bathrooms are immaculate too!",,1,
17,Eric G.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,13,1,3.0,1/4/2017,"I have seen other productions at the Schubert and enjoyed them. I went for a comedy show this time and selected first row center balcony seats thinking they would be ideal. No where did it say ""obstructed view"". We could not see the show AT ALL if we were to sit back on our chairs comfortably.  We had to lean over the front rail the entire show to see. In addition, we had to dodge the spotlight that was shining straight down from behind us, embarrassingly casting our seated shadow onto the stage.  I will definitely never buy balcony seats again.",,,
18,Lorrice G.,"Bridgeport, CT",141,64,203,5.0,3/6/2015,This year the Shubert is celebrating it's 100th anniversary.  It's incredible how a place that has been around this long is able to maintain old classic ambiance and incorporate some modern conveniences with style.  The Shubert has just had an upgrade.  It has added much needed bathroom facilities on every floor to reduce the number of complaints about long lines. The shows are Broadway worthy with an amazing line up this year . If you haven't been in a while or have never treated yourself to an event here. You should!,1,1,1
19,Cara M.,"Hamden, CT",0,8,0,5.0,4/30/2017,"I've been going to the Shubert for years, and after seeing a phenomenal performance of Rent there last night, I thought I should really write a review and sing its praises. I usually make it to a couple of shows a year--have seen Book of Morman, Jersey Boys, Spring Awakening, Mamma Mia, Blue Man Group, to name a few--and the performances are always incredible. There's always a part of me that worries about the quality of an ""off-Broadway"" performance, but after years of seeing one great performance after another at the Shubert, I know that I can trust each show to be top notch. The staff is also fantastic, handling check in quickly and ushering you to your seats. Because last night's performance was so heavily attended, we got to the Shubert early and had a great time enjoying a glass of wine in their lounge area before heading to the theater. If you live in Greater New Haven and have never seen a show at the Shubert, you don't know what you're missing!",,,
20,Cathy M.,"Madison, CT",11,167,957,1.0,3/2/2014,If you go to the Shubert arrive an hour early!!!  Not 30 minutes or 45. -shoot for a whole HOUR!We spent good money ($560) for 5 of us to see a 1:00 pm Sunday show.  The traffic was so bad on Chapel. Just horrible.  Two cars elected to disrupt the flow by performing 3 point turns to reverse their direction!  Not one car but two!   Wish some police had been there!! The pace through the adjacent garage was poor.  We got locked out of the show!  We dropped out kids off on the street and told them to sprint!!!We watched the first 20 minute in the lobby on a tv screen.  But you could not hear the music from that screen. Some technician stood and told us the story line.  They said they started the performance at 1:09.  Do not be late!I wish I could say it was worth the $560 that we paid.  I was shocked at how poor the sound was.  I was orchestra row M ($108) and thought I was going deaf!  The seats are tight.,,,
21,Eric C.,"Atlanta, GA",967,1390,1017,4.0,4/14/2013,"Beautiful historical theater that I believe usually holds musicals for the Yale campus is where the 2013 Unite for Sight Conference was held. I was fortunate enough to get to attend and present. Keynote speakers included Jeffrey Sachs and frankly, every speaker was phenomenal. What a great job they did to bring this conference together and get people to talk about the novel projects that they are working on. Hope that they can continue the good work that they are doing!",,,
22,Freesia S.,"New Haven, CT",485,455,366,4.0,6/12/2012,"The Shubert is a really nice place to see live music or theater. Right in downtown New Haven, it's pretty convenient to get to, and it brings in a lot of great shows and acts. I stopped in this month to see In The Heights with my mom, and we had a wonderful time. The show itself was fantastic, and I think it was such a great experience at least partially because of the Shubert. This was my second time over the last year seeing a show at the Shubert - I saw Jeff Mangum in January, and the Shubert was the perfect place to hold that concert. There are enough seats for more popular acts, but the classic feel of the theater helps the performance still feel intimate. The seats are that old theater crushed velvet type, a little cramped, but not too bad. Drinks are expensive, but that's to be expected for theater prices. The entire theater is pretty clean - while the line for the bathroom can get long during intermission, it at least stays clean inside. Parking can be a pain. If you can't find street parking, or if you're there while street parking is still at a one-hour limit, you'll end up in the parking garage. At least the last time we went, it was $8, but when my boyfriend and I went to see Jeff Mangum, the sign said $8, but they charged more once we got inside the garage. There's a terrible line to get into the garage, and if you leave right after the show, it's awful, so my mom and I grabbed something to eat before attempting to leave the garage. Tickets for some shows can get expensive, but sometimes you can catch deals. For example, I paid half price for my In The Heights tickets through a Black Friday/Christmas special.",1,,
23,CL B.,"Ansonia, CT",0,12,7,5.0,12/21/2016,"The Shubert is wonderful, a classic place to see Broadway shows. However we just saw Elf the Musical which was amazing except for the fact that they threw a few swears into it. Why when it's a family show?!?! They totally degraded it for me and my family. No need for it!! Sad that people are getting so immune to such things and just accept it. I however do not. Glad my boys noticed it too and were offended as well. At least they aren't immune.",,,
24,Anthony W.,"Hamden, CT",34,50,8,1.0,11/3/2013,"Went last night (11/2) to see John Pinnette.   I can't believe people put themselves through the ordeal of seeing a show here.Got to the corner of Chapel and Crown a full 90 mins before the show ... to a WALL of cars and pedestrians swarming the area.  It took us so damn long to get near and then into the parking garage ... by  the time we inched, and inched, and inched in, paid the parking fee, got our ticket, then inched up to the 5th floor, found a spot, then ran down the stairs, nearly falling over the knocked out homeless man (and his shopping cart) who was totally oblivious to people coming down around him, we made it into the lobby.     ANOTHER sea of people -- it was HEAVING with people, clogging the stairwells, the TINY elevator (whichheld about 5 people at a time ... big freakin help). Didn't make it to our seats up in the B section until 5 mins before the show ... sweating (did I say it was HOT in there?!).    The upper balcony area is SCARY.   VERY steep and the seats are ridiculously tiny .. there is NO space on either side of you (think of a middle seat in coach on a discount airline) ... and even less legroom.    Your knees are actually touching the shoulders of the people in front of you.The show was great, but this place is so uncomfortable .. it was torture sitting there for almost 2 hrs.They also kept letting latecomers in ... a full 30 mins into the show ... the ushers shining their obnoxious flashlights down the row so the fools could slide down the row into their seats.Then when the show was over, it was mass clogging again out to the front ... mobs of people waiting to go up the 2 TINY elevators into the parking garage (Max Capacity:8) and then the BEST part happened once we got to our car.   We joined the line in the garage at 10:12 ..and barely inched along ... we did not leave that damn garage until 11:05.    Then inched along for another good 15 minutes thru the 1-way streets and traffic lights every 5 feet to the NH connector along with everyone else and the drunks weaving around between all the cars on foot.  Almost a full hour ... just to get out of that  garage.   This was one of the most miserable nights out I have had in a long, long time ... I will never put myself through it again.I can't believe anyone would do this more than once. .. or maybe I;m just not a ""theater person"" !Buh-Bye Shubert.",2,,

Sit in the orchestra near the stage.The conclusion from sitting in ORCH, row S, seats 13-15 on Saturday, March 1st is that the lowest hanging fruit for the Shubert, in terms of room for improvement, is to prevent its employees from talking and walking around during the show, which is, of course, distracting.",,,

Although, if you sit too far back on the ground floor, you will not be able to see up the upper half of the stage, where is where text is usually projected.However, this is completely contrasted by problems of the balcony seats. Balcony seats are very close to the stage and the angle is such that you can literally only see half of the stage. There is also no leg room and the seats are cramped together side and side.I would consider buying balcony tickets a complete waste of money, but if you can get ground floor tickets, I think you would enjoy yourself.

The only thing that I didn't appreciate was the very inappropriate costumes that the women wore in the scene where they sang ""be our guest"", the ladies that were the plates. Those costumes were not child friendly at all, from where I sitting one could get a really nice glimpse of everything, nothing was left to the imagination at all (lots of happy dads in the audience ;) not tastefully done,and very low class.

But, even though they import the first class road companies of popular tours, it's difficult to enjoy them. The seats are suitable for people who are the size of fifth graders - and the rows are impossibly close together. The acoustics are not terrific, and hearing dialogue can be a real problem - though music, for some reason, is more accessible. But, still, it's the Shubert, after all. And that's saying quite a lot. Even with all the inconveniences (did I mention mile long longs at the rest rooms?), we still go here and have a good time.

The seats in the center are a lot better than those not in the center, more so than in other theaters.",1,,
40,Cathy F.,"North Haven, CT",0,20,0,4.0,2/4/2013,"I didn't quite know how to rate this visit, but will say that we were given excellent customer service by both the Facility/Event Manager-Stephanie Panico, and the woman who directed us to our seats. I must say, if you have any trouble ascending or descending a staircase...stay out of the mezzanine. The Center staircase lacks handrails to hold on to, so getting to the top or bottom of these steep stairs is not for the faint of heart...I am only grateful that the woman who was to direct us to our seats gave us even better seats without going up these horrid stairs. We ended up sitting on the right side of the theater, looking towards the stage, in Row B. Which was better than the seats we originally had. Stephanie Panico met us at the door, and had someone seat us at the second floor mezzanine instead of the 3rd floor as often directed when sitting in the mezzanine section, so we wouldn't have so many stairs to descend. Going this way, we only had 4 stairs to descend, and 2 stairs up, to our new seats. THANK YOU Stephanie! Our next show we will definitely purchase Orchestra seats and bypass the stairs. Leg Room: None. Your knees touch the seat in front of you. Seats: Small enough for a 5th Grader. Elevators: Horribly Slow. The bathroom was empty, just about 15 minutes before the show, so we were happy about that. We saw the Adams' Family, the show was fabulous and the actors were great. :) Overall we had a really wonderful time. Beware of the Garage elevators, they only fit 8 people at a time, and are old and crickity! They make some awful kind of noise and sound like the cables are out of whack!",,,
41,James D.,"Ashford, CT",1,10,0,4.0,2/20/2009,"The Shubert is an old theater in New Haven, CT on College St. That puts it just about smack dab in the middle of the action in New Haven (the type of action you want in NH that is) surrounding the theater is the main restaurant/bar/Yale section of the city. It really is probably the gem of Connecticut in regards to things to do, hear, and taste. If you are there before the show and nightfall do yourself a sizeable favor and tour the Yale area on foot. Some stunning, prestigious buildings are within a quick hop, skip, dance and shuffle. While checking out the Yale properties you will find many great places to shop and eat. I have now been to the Shubert Theater twice. Both times for 'pop' music performances, more specifically rock 'n' roll. I would love to experience the theater there sometime soon, so far just rock shows. Tonight I caught Ryan Adams & The Cardinals. At some point in 2008 I went to see Wilco there. For the Cardinals show I bought tickets in advance online. Best available were the first row of the balcony section. Tickets for the performance were $35, after service and restoration fees I paid an extra $12 or so per ticket off their website. The first show I went to I walked up to the box office an hour or so before show time and was able to purchase one ticket in the private orch box directly off of he stage with no service fees. It was a sold out show but they released tickets last minute.So anywho, after downing a Black & Tan at a pub just around the corner my friend and I strolled to the show 10 mins late. The line to get in went quick and their was no security 'pat down'. The bar area in the lobby has been crowded both times I have been there. There is no seating and its in the a direct traffic area. Drinks are $6 beer and $7/$8 for small cocktails. If you ask nice they will make you a double cocktail in the beer cup instead of the small cocktail cup for $14. Thus you avoid making an extra trip if a cocktail is your bag. There is beer available in the mezzanine bar area, not sure about liquor. The balcony area was an odd vantage point to view the show from. I am a fan of being on the 'floor' at concerts in a 'general admission' environment. Being 4 flights of stairs above the stage made me feel disconnected from the performance. In essence I felt as if I was observing a band playing to the folks at stage level. The birds eye view was not for me. The seats were very small with no space in-between so be prepared to get cozy with your neighbor if you are not extremely petite and perfectly centered in your seat. For those accustomed to an assigned seat, and I do mean seated, no getting up and shaking it here, you should not be disappointed or surprised. The previous show where I was in the orch box was much more satisfying as I was close to the stage, on the ground level and had room to move about and get comfortable.The theater itself is very nice and has a unique character in vibe, decor ,and architecture, that you will certainly not find in any modern building. The theater staff is mostly very helpful and attentive, ushering you to your seat and whatnot. This is appreciated as it is not designed like a fast-food restaurant where you can pretty much anticipate where everything is located. The acoustics here seem to be great to the untrained ear . If someone is commenting or yelping (no pun) you can hear it in pretty much every corner of the theater, this can be good and bad ( just ask Ryan Adams). The sound from the balcony for the rock show was not perfect or close to it. It definitely sounded like we were above where the sound was directed listening down on it, while looking at the top of the artists heads. I am sure it sounded much more clear in the orch seats. Parking is either street or garage. I usually have no problem finding street parking within .5 miles of the venue (usually pretty close and I don't mind walking this area as I mentioned), garage parking was $7 tonight very close to the venue. I will definitely see another show at the Shubert, however I will only purchase orchestra level tickets. I am just not a balcony kind of guy, and don't prefer reserved seating for rock shows in general, though I am very willing to accept this normality for the sake of great songs. Crowded lobby, small seats, good staff, a wee bit of charm to spare, it is easy to see why select rock acts choose to book the Shubert. Compared to the Chevrolet Theater in Wallingford which is about as neutral and sterile of character as you can get it is a great option for acts of this size. Plenty of nightlife options everywhere you look make the Shubert a winner in my book, despite the imperfections. CT could use a stellar mid size room, until we get one the Shubert will do fine. BTW they use Protix, it's always nice to pay your service fees to the lesser of two evils. Support Live Music!!!! Better yet Support Independent Music!!!!!",3,,1
