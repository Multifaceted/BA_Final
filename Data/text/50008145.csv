Updated review","4.5 stars. This place still delivers top-quality bbq meat, solid sides and great beers. No surprise they keep opening new locations. Now this location accepts reservations, which is a plus during peek hours. We got the usual brisket, burned ends, pulled pork, baked beans, sweet corn fritters and the s'mores bread pudding. Except for the burned ends (that were a little tough) and the bread pudding (which was a little dry), all was as good as always. Service at the cashier can be a tad pretentious and unwelcoming, so we were happy to meet Christopher, who was outstanding with our group. He was friendly, patient, informative, personable and willing to go the extra mile to help us out. He was everything you'd dream of in terms of customer service. A true keeper.",5,1,6
1,Robert P.,"Philadelphia, PA",276,9,0,3.0,11/4/2018,"Quick preface: I've eaten a good bit of Mighty Quinn's in the past, but this is the first time I've had an experience like this at any of their locations.So the meat of the review: swung by to celebrate a friend's birthday at the close of a wonderful evening.  They happened to be out of pulled pork (weird for a Sunday at 7, but these things happen).  One of the members of the party ordered lean brisket as a substitute.  Prep seemed to be simply cutting a little fat off of a new slab of brisket.  Again, a little weird but meat can be too.Next ordered 10 bones (which in Quinn's parlance is a half rack plus a single order it seems) and attempted to order a quarter pound of fatty brisket.  The restaurant would not serve a quarter pound, only a single serving or full pound.  Refused pretty aggressively.  This was a pretty huge disappointment so I just didn't order anything.At checkout they had only provided a single half rack of ribs but considering all the other issues I just ate my sides.  The rest of my party were kind enough to share their ribs and brisket.  Ribs: spectacular as always.  Brisket on the other hand was extremely dry and largely flavorless.  For $20+ per person without drinks, the service and food quality were below what I've come to expect.",,1,
2,Alan M.,"Long Beach, CA",110,39,14,5.0,10/17/2018,"OK, best brisket ever (and I've had some good brisket around the country). Pulled pork was very good but sausage lacked the smoky hit I was hoping for. Great sides include baked beans with burnt ends, decent slaw and really good mashed sweet potatoes (with pecans and brown sugar).I would have rated this place a solid 4 stars but the super nice women behind the counter dragged things up. One of them even brought me a refill on my beer to the table, even though there's no table service. Sweet.So worth trying out this place- make sure you have the brisket and tip those great women behind the counter!",,,
3,Joanne H.,"New York, NY",255,262,471,3.0,11/4/2018,"Whenever my bf and I want bbq we always make our way down here. He always gets the brontosaurus ribs and though I normally get the brisket, I always regret it. The brisket is always too dry. Spare ribs are a safe bet for me. I once got their broccoli salad and it scarred me enough to never try it again. The dressing they use on it is drenched in salt. Salty broccoli soup, no thank you. Mac and cheese is great. We always end up leaving in a food coma and never wanting bbq again. Until the next craving anyway.",2,,1
4,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",203,238,1439,4.0,7/1/2018,"With the burgeoning rivalry on Brooklyn BBQ vs Texas BBQ, I stand a highly interested, though slightly detached observer. Having not been to Austin or any of the famous southern BBQ haunts, nor having any interest in going up a 7 floor walk-up in Bushwick to someone apartment, Mighty Quinns helps fill the brisket sized hole. Offering both inside tables and sidewalk seating (in the nicer weather) MQ's can fit enough in people as in a ten gallon hat. All of the meat is absolutely fall apart tender and topped with a liberal amount of barbecue sauce, giving the meat a nice tangy kick to it. The pulled pork is incredible, especially when piled sky high on a bun and paired with a ice cold root beer and a side of fries. Sitting out of the sidewalk seating you almost manage to forget that you're in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the world.",2,,1
5,Tim Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",115,196,348,4.0,9/10/2018,"I LOVE Mighty Quinn's - every time I visit a location, the meats are smoked deliciously and everything else is cooked properly and served hot. Everyone who wants good barbecue should try out a Mighty Quinn's location, and thankfully there are a deservedly fast-growing number of Mighty Quinn locations!  We here in Philly are getting our first of the NYC barbecue places at our upcoming Fashion Outlet mall, but I wish it was a Mighty Quinn's instead.That being said, the only critical elements of this location, located in the heart of the great Greenwich Village(!), that I can mention are three: it's rather dark inside here, the super-delicious brisket I was served was pretty heavily fatty (it's certainly not priced cheap), and the staff should not unlock the doors until it is open for business.The first two critiques are self-explanatory; but I'll mention that we entered this location on a Saturday at 11:25am and were told that it was not opening for another 5 minutes. One - I think all restaurants should be open for lunch by 11am, and two - just keep the doors locked until you are ready to serve customers. If someone can walk in, don't make them leave for 5 minutes and expect that they automatically would come back.Pro-tip: skip the single-serving and go for nothing less than the half-pound serving - the meat has such a delicious flavor, and your future-self will thank you!The sweet corn fritters are a great, modern take on an alternative to cornbread, and are perfectly accompanied by maple syrup; and the fries appear to be as fresh cut as can be. Nothing was left on our plates, except a couple decent lumps of fat.I hate to be hatin' on Mighty Quinn's at all, but I think the above items are worth noting.",3,1,1
6,Graham K.,"Arlington, TX",120,235,191,5.0,7/23/2018,"My girlfriend and I randomly stopped in as part of a NYC crawl. We had already imbibed in a few drinks and needed something to nosh on before continuing our jaunt. We followed our noses into Quinn's.Metal and wood interior, black t-shirted and black rubber gloved employees behind the counter, chalkboard menu. This is the quintessential BBQ joint. The small is amazing and all the meats and sides are kept in warming trays for quick service.They let us try a couple different meats before making our final selection (the pulled pork) most are served with a flourish of flaked sea salt. It makes all the difference. Their sauce is smoky and runnier, not viscous and sweet. The meat is rich and heady with spice and smoke, but isn't overpowering. Exactly what we needed. This place is is the real deal, don't let anyone tell you the Northeast cant do BBQ.",,,
7,Ellie P.,"Long Island, NY",23,130,23,1.0,6/8/2018,"We were referred to MQ by a friend who works with Michael Symon as one of the best BBQ in NYC. So, with all the hype around this restaurant, we were expecting to walk into a loud, upbeat vibe with a scent of smokey BBQ. Instead, we walked in to practically crickets and three very bored looking girls behind the counter. (We were there Friday after happy hr BTW) We were stoked to try their famous brontosaurus rib, so we asked for that first. The girl reached below and pulled it out of a warming oven and it looked insanely dry. Same with the half chicken. They brushed sauce on the rib, but nothing on the chicken. Pre-prepped and pre cut food that is dry. Next, on to the sides. On the menu they were incredibly attractive--but in person in the trays they were dry and crumbly and crusty as if they were sitting there for hours. But, we were hopeful and tried a few anyway. First, the food--The rib had good bark, but literally slid off the bone, to the point where we thought they literally put meat on a bone and called it a rib. It was not worth the $28. The chicken was dry as expected but their table bbq sauce helped. Kale salad was incredibly vinegary. The winners were the burnt end baked beans and the mac and cheese (after you ate around the dried out topping). The best dish was the crispy BBQ sandwich (probably bc that was the only thing made to order) Overall, it was such a sad experience. Mighty Quinns has been on my food bucket list for a few years and it was such a disappointment.",,,
8,Sarah G.,"Manhattan, NY",149,185,815,4.0,4/22/2018,"I was really excited to try Mighty Quinn's but I have to say this is really between a 3-4 star review depending on what you get.The saving grace is the absolutely mouth watering Brisket with sea salt on top. That being said, the Mac & Cheese was almost inedible and was not creamy, with some form of curtailed cheese (maybe a mild feta?) binding it together.My honest opinion: I'd return if I was in the area but wouldn't make a special trip.",4,1,2
9,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1701,2743,655,2.0,6/27/2018,"The restaurant has open space out in the warmer weather, and you walk right up and order at the counter cafeteria-style, how much you want and what you want. There are a number of free sides (onions, cucumbers, etc.) but they go light when they give it to you (the one I went to in NJ was much bigger at portioning). No BBQ sauce on the table area where we sat.The brisket - moist and juicy, no complaints there. The place is dark and ill-lit, though, needs some brighter lighting inside, someone to wipe down the tables, and something to keep the flies away when they open up the doors to the outside.",3,1,2
10,David M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",107,2,0,1.0,11/3/2018,Reservations for a restaurant that does not have table service? Could it be anymore pretentious?,,,
11,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3648,951,2085,3.0,12/31/2017,Not sure what all the great reviews are about. My wife and I did not find anything spectacular in here.We came on a thursday night at 7pm and they were out of pulled pork... no biggie... we ordered the brisket and ribs. The brisket was dry and did not have much flavor. The ribs were not bad but without adding bbq sauce they did not have flavor. The meat lacked any punch of flavor. Not great.For sides we ordered the burnt end fries and sweet corn fritters. The fries were the best part of the meal. The sweet corn fritters were bland. No salt or any corn flavor.I was not impressed with this meal at all. 2.5 would be a more fair rating but there has to be better bbq in nyc than this.,4,,
12,Anurag P.,"New York, NY",57,225,321,5.0,6/24/2018,"West Village has a lot of great restaurants, but is cursed with terrible wait times, long lines, and reservation drama. I love the fact that I don't have to worry about that at Mighty Quinn's. I just walk in, get on that line cafeteria style, and take a seat. My favorite meat here is the brisket. If its your first time, definitely start with that. But the pork spare ribs are also good; some people complain of ""dry"" ribs but I disagree - the outside is nicely charred but the inside is soft and tender. I've never tried the chicken or wings here, just because it doesn't seem appropriate given the option for melt-in-your-mouth barbecued meat.Tip: get your meat in a ""sandwich"". You'll get the same amount of meat as going ""naked"", just with a free bun with that serving. I prefer eating my meat in non-sandwich form, so what I'll do is alternate between eating with a fork and grabbing pieces of bread with bits of meat and BBQ sauce. Bread soaks up BBQ sauce and meat juices really well.I usually go light on BBQ sauce because I like to have the meat shine on its own, but the sauce is actually really good, and I'm happy to use it liberally. I love that it's is actually slightly spicy, and not just glorified ketchup.I have a sweet tooth, and therefore a high tolerance for sweet dishes. I also have a personal love for sweet potato as a food. So it's only natural that I am obsessed with the sweet potato casserole here. The walnuts add a salty crunch to the rich/creamy sweet potato and sweet maple. Your mileage may vary, however. I can definitely see some (strange) people finding this too sweet for them.For someone who eats a lot, paying $25+ for two decent servings of meat, slaw/veg, bread, and a hefty side is not an issue at all. You can pay well below this if you eat less. And this will be a regular occurrence for me.Eventually I'll try the burnt ends, the colossal Brontosaurus Rib, and even the chicken if I'm feeling weird. I also really want to try the monthly special flavors of bread pudding (e.g. S'mores for June). But I was in too much of a food coma for that.",,,
13,Marija H.,"Bezirk Spandau, Berlin, Germany",33,9,24,5.0,9/30/2018,This place is a must visit for meat lovers. I had both the pulled pork and the burnt ends. The flavor is amazing and it is so tender! This was the best I ever had! Oh and not to forget the Mac and cheese...it is to die for!!!!!!! I wish this restaurant would be available in Germany!,,,
14,Cindy W.,"Manhattan, NY",35,111,336,4.0,12/14/2017,"Service is fast and polite. The location is very clean and has window walls, so you can people watch.I had a brisket sandwith with coleslaw and pickled cucumbers. The brisket is so tender and has the perfect amount of fat. There were two or three morsels that had very tough, overcooked meat. The bread is also very delicious, but I wish it was warm or toasted. Next time, I would probably just keep the bottom bun. The coleslaw and pickled cucumbers provided the perfect constrasting amount of tang.I was so full by the end of it. Would definitely come back. I like it more than the East Village location too!",,,

Ordered brisket with 2 sides and got a it disappointed. The coleslaw and beans were nothing special, and the meat was on the dry side, despite I've asked for juicier meat. Meat texture was fine, but lacked in flavor. It's nice to have a BBQ joint near Chelsea, but it should have been a better one.",1,1,
16,Vanessa L.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",156,303,973,5.0,9/29/2017,"Wow the BBQ here is uhhhhmaaazinggggg! Really good pricing as well. The single serving is way enough for 1 person so I recommend getting just the single serving which also comes with complimentary sides of the veggies which are 2 diff kinds of cole slaw - one with vinegar and one with mayo, pickled onions, cucumbers and peppers. The peppers were delicious with BBQ. Gives it a nice kick. I got the burnt ends with a side of the broccoli salad and my bf got the brisket with a side of potato salad. Everything tastes spectacular and was so on point! Salad & BBQ! Super tasty and flavorful and the meat was soft. Must try if you love BBQ. The staff is friendly and not stingy at all! They are really generous with the portions that they give. Free refills on soda as well.",2,1,2
17,Anthony B.,"Dallas, TX",86,314,23,2.0,3/27/2018,"Some of my NY friends wanted me to try Mighty Quinn's to see how it stacks up to Texas BBQ. Fly out to NYC to try out BBQ? I've done weirder things on random trips.  Checking out the menu, I see single servings of various meats and it ranges from $8-$10. So if you want two meats, you're out almost $20- a little pricey, but if it's good then it's worth it. I'm surprised there's no two meat option that allows you to mix at a lower price (i.e. 2 meats at $15, each at half a serving). Normally I'd sample the ribs and brisket- the staples of BBQ- but I didn't feel like eating all of that so I opted for the brisket and a side of sweet potato casserole. If the brisket is good, it shouldn't need sauce. Unfortunately, this one needed sauce. The brisket wasn't bone dry, but it definitely could have been more tender and moist.  Maybe I got a slab brisket that didn't have enough fat on it to provide the tenderness, who knows. The flavor was pretty decent however and the sauce tasted good as well. I used a decent amount of sauce. The sweet potato casserole tasted fine- it had a good smooth consistency and sweetness.  The beer was good as well.  It would have been nice if there was bread that came with the meat, something I didn't realize I missed until I saw how sparse my tray of food was. Yes, I could have ordered the sandwich to get bread, but that's not the point- you should offer good old generic white bread to go with your BBQ.Overall- it's an ok effort at BBQ but it has room to grow. I'd say it's about 3 stars, but the price point brings it down to 2 stars. That entire meal was roughly $25. At that price, I'd expect Franklin's quality BBQ. This was more aligned to the fast food BBQ you can get in TX, but at around 30% higher cost. The place is clean, the staff is nice, the BBQ just falls short, especially at its price point.",2,,
18,Irene B.,"New York, NY",446,55,94,2.0,4/30/2018,Just don't think it's that good. Tried the brisket and pork and chicken and all were pretty average. The pork was so mushy and too fatty that there was barely any meat to eat. Atmosphere is nice. You order and then choose your seat. Sauces are available at the table and you get your own tray. Clean environment and very chill. But food just isn't that great.,,,
19,Christina Z.,"New York, NY",947,368,367,1.0,4/30/2018,"I was excited to try Mighty Quinn's to try their BBQ.Got the burnt ends - the service here was pretty terrible and rushed (they don't answer any of your questions and give you a LOT of attitude when you're inquiring about their meats). The flavor for the burnt ends were just so-so, not much to it, just fat and meat. I'm surprised they don't include ANY BREAD AT ALL with your order.Also ordered the mac n cheese - this actually is probably the worst mac n cheese I've ever had in the city. It's overwhelmingly cheesy and heavy...and it's not even HOT/WARM?! It came out pretty grainy and didn't have any character to it at all. The fact it came out semi-congealed since it wasn't kept warm was also a disappointment.I usually hate chicken breast meat, but the spicy chicken sandwich actually tastes better than any of the typical bbq items we ordered.Probably wouldn't come back - also the type of customers that were attracted here were pretty pushy and impatient (wouldn't let me read the menu and order).",,,
20,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2401,4793,5.0,8/14/2017,"I discovered Mighty Quinn's Barbeque at Brooklyn Smorgasburg. I knew they had a homerun with their Bbq brisket. Fatty and juicy, it make you want more after each bite. These guys know BBQ. I went to the East Village location. I went to New Jersey and found them by chance, now its time to try the grandaddy location in the West Village.It's Sunday and I pull up to the front, parking laws are not in effect. Just how I roll baby! My wife & I are on a mission to try their monster rib called Brontasaurs Rib. I'm looking at my wife, she kinda looks like Wilma?? Well Yabba Dabba Doo, call me Fred because we ordered this bad boy! We also ordered corn fritters as well as a funky rye beer from Da Bronx.The corn fritters come with a spicy honey dipping sauce. And we were given a few sides: Hot cherry peppers, pickled cucumbers, vinegar cole slaw all items to cut the fat.Taking a bite of a dipped corn fritter as well as the hunk of rib was pure BBQ heaven. I love Mighty Quinn's Barbecue, the West village location is large and in charge. My favorite BBQ in NYC.",10,11,15
21,Andrei L.,"Long Island, NY",46,164,344,5.0,8/2/2017,"I came here a few weeks ago for dinner on a Friday night after hearing the hype about Mighty Quinn's as one of the best BBQ places in the city.  Upon entrance, I really liked the fast-casual type of set up where you can just order your food, grab it, and then sit down somewhere to eat.  I hate paying extra for tip, so this place is definitely up my alley.  I ended up going all out with a friend; we ordered pretty much everything that looked good and ended up splitting the meal.  We ended up getting the medium portions of the brisket, ribs, and a single order of the burnt ends.  We also ordered the loaded frits, a medium mac and cheese, and drinks.  Total came out to $33 a person, which means I spent way too much.  I always hate doing family style because I spend unnecessarily.  But I think I'm going to still give 5 stars, which means the food was amazing.  I really enjoyed the meal and stuffed myself so full I got diarrhea in the next half hour while we were walking around the village.  All of the items were tasty but my favorite by far was the brisket.  It was so juicy and fatty.  The mac and cheese was another highlight; very rich, creamy, and to die for.  The ribs were also amazing; I think they put some sort of dry rub on it.  If I had to nitpick I'd say they were slightly dry.  Burnt ends were very good too.  In conclusion, I felt like I had a legendary meal, even though it was expensive.  I definitely feel like you can get a lot for $20 or under.  The next time I go, I'm going to get a medium order of brisket, mac and cheese, and a drink.  That should be under or around $20 and a lot of food.  Can't wait.",9,1,3

I expected more given the reviews and the pictures I've seen, but I found my experience here rather mediocre.We tried the Brontosaurus Rib, which was fantastic. The meat was super tender, fatty, and fell right off the bone -- as good BBQ ribs should. It's definitely not worth the $28 price tag, but definitely worth trying if you love a good rib and if you're splitting it with other people.The brisket we ordered was the biggest disappointment. It was dry, and because it was not sliced against the grain, the meat was stringy and tough. I'd be interested to try the burnt ends though, as the ends of our brisket were more fatty and moist.For sides, we ordered the mac and cheese and fries. Fries were mediocre at best, nothing to write home about. The mac and cheese had a nice flavor, but unfortunately was topped with a ton of bread cubes, which got mushy and did not add any textural elements.",,,1

The brontosaurus rib was as good as advertised.  Ridiculously tender and tasty. My only critique was that it was a bit on the greasy side and could've been rendered down a bit more. Also may have been lacking the smokey flavor. But nonetheless, still delicious and worth the experience. And the dirty fries were also great. The chile-lime bbq sauce added a nice kick.

There was a lot of indoor seating and there were even outdoor seating (around 20 chairs), so this place holds a lot of people, even during their busy times. I'd recommend sitting outside especially if the weather is lovely. The staff was friendly and answered our questions thoroughly.  You start off by ordering your food and then paying. I opted for the brisket sandwich (it comes with a side of cole slaw--mayo or vinegar). Also got the 6 piece spicy wings. Overall--the food was good. You definitely need to have their BBQ sauce with the brisket. The brisket itself is juicy, but lacks actual flavor. The wings are good & spicy, but are really small (korean fried chicken has spoiled me with their huge wings!) They're not that filling so definitely get something with it. The fries are standard. Wish I got the broccoli salad or the burnt end baked beans, so definitely coming back for those. A plus is that it's casual, fast food place. I don't like being obligated to pay for tip, so being able to just round up the bill as tip is a plus instead of opting for the usual 18%.",1,,

The menu consists of your typical bbq fair. From brisket, burnt ends, beef ribs, pulled pork and ribs. With some nice tasty sides. We ordered the burnt ends, brisket, smoked wings, mac & cheese and broccoli salad. The burnt ends and brisket were amazing, nice and tender and had great flavor. The mac & cheese had tremendous flavor but the noodles were a bit overcooked. The buttermilk broccoli salad was nice and crunchy. The wings did not have much smoke flavor, they were really dry and tasted like old fryer oil. For the most part  great experience and great food.",2,2,3

We ordered a full rack of the Brontosaurus ribs between 3 people and the portion was slightly too much. Meat was tender and soft, though not the same as the charred taste you would get at an actual charcoal barbecue. You add your own barbecue sauce. For sides we got the mac and cheese, which was great. Buttery and heavy, and I especially liked the crunchy parts. We also ordered the coleslaw with vinegar, they have a choice of vinegar and mayo. Coleslaw was refreshing compared to the mac and cheese and ribs. Overall, a solid meal if you're craving ribs.",,,

We were three people and ordered everything on the menu. The brisket was soft and juicy and beautifully done. The bronto ribs were good too (a tad less than the perfect brisket though). My favorite was their spicy wings. I have not eaten anything like that. Beautiful flavors for chicken wings. I'm not a huge fan of pulled pork byt my friends loved it. Do not miss their sweet potato casserole and broccoli buttermilk something. I was too full to have dessert but I'll be back to try their bread pudding. Oh, and absolutely order the ginger ale- it's made with ginger and cane sugar- very refreshing!!Definitely going back again. Reasonable place to get good meat.",1,,

So you're in Texas, chilling out on a cactus, listening to some country music, watching the tumbleweed, winning the World Series, etc., and you're of course eating some awesome barbecue. Except hold up, you're NOT in Texas, you're not even close - here you are right between Chelsea and the West Village, and here's Mighty Quinn's, and BOY is it delicious. Rambling intros aside, Mighty Quinn's is the second best barbecue in NYC behind Hometown in Red Hook. Their brisket is amazing. Their pulled pork is delicious, although not quite as delicious as their brisket, which did I mention is amazing? Their chicken looks good but why get that when you can get brisket? And their ribs looked phenomenal although again, the brisket. Sandwich, or plain - get it!Also, sides are good. Mac and cheese and fries. Mmmm. Also it's extremely reasonable!",,,
39,Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",205,509,2651,4.0,9/3/2017,"I have been craving for the brontosaurus rib for a while. Finally, we decided to have it for our anniversary dinner. The west village location took reservations, which later I thought it wasn't necessary at all. The place was pretty empty at 6:30PM on a Wednesday. We got the brontosaurus rib, adobo baby back ribs, and a sausage. The brontosaurus rib was very oily. After getting rid of the fat, I enjoyed the tender and juicy meat very much. My husband wasn't a big fan though. The adobo baby back ribs were pretty good, which were tender but not super special. The sausage was very good as well.",3,2,2

I called the restaurant to express my concern about the fat and asked for a refund and the manager told me I'd have to go through Uber.,,,
42,Ryan R.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",50,162,596,5.0,1/17/2018,"I've had this place on my list of places to go for a while and man, I should have went sooner. This place has a very casual vibe. There's wood on some of the walls, brick everywhere, exposed and worn concrete floors. You start by ordering cafeteria style. You pick your meats and they prepare it right in front of you. Then comes your sides, and lastly your drink and payment. If something needs to be made-to-order, they will give you a number and bring it out when it's ready.Now the food here is pretty freaking great. I am so glad I waited to go and mad that I didn't go sooner. The brisket was so tender and flavorful that I only needed to use my fork to pull a bite off the piece. And in my opinion, it didn't need any barbeque sauce on it. I did dab the barbeque sauce on a few pieces and did taste pretty good on it. I recommend ordering the dirty fries too. They were hella delicious! It consisted of burnt ends doused in a chili-lime sauce and some scallions tossed over french fries. The melding of the juices and the fries just worked. And I hate soggy fries. The only item I wasn't keen on was the mac and cheese. I mean, it was OK... It's made with a lighter (white?) cheese and had stuffing mixed into it. It ended up giving me acid reflux. My friend got the pulled pork sandwich. I tried a bite and it was OK I suppose. It was juicy and worked well with their coleslaw. It was just missing something. Perhaps a douse of barbeque sauce from the table? The corn fritter we're pretty good as well. They were dense, every item had corn in them, and paired perfect with a dab of the honey chipotle sauce.I will definitely come back to this place if I get the chance.",2,,1

I went on a Saturday evening and was not disappointed. There was no line and plenty of seats which was very surprising since many of the other BBQ joints have long wait times. We ordered the baby back rib special, brisket, burnt end baked beans, sweet potato casserole and other fixings. Everything was delicious!

Updated review","I gave them a second try after my disappointing first try. I had a regular portion ( about 4 ounces) of brisket, a small scoop of Cole slaw and an 8 oz potion of burnt end baked beans. My partner had  a 4 rib portion of baby backs and the same small order of beans. One of the ribs were so dried out they were inedible. My brisket was just OK. The beans were so overly sweet we could not force them down. With no beverages the total came to over $29. Clearly not worth it. It is really evident now that the food is prepared elsewhere and kept on steam tables to be served. Sorry, at these prices it's 2 strikes you're out. I can't afford a third.",,,

The star was the dinosaur rib but it wasn't as hot and fresh as I was hoping...the person literally just pulled one out of a bucket below her.....the coleslaw was good and the sweet potatoes was probably the best thing I had.

Both are decently spacious and come with no frills, top quality meat with one of my favorite house sauces, the best sides ever, and good beer on tap. Top picks:- I'm a brisket fan, and this place serves a top notch version- Brontosaurus rib is huge and tender if you've got the appetite for it- Dirty frites (smothered with burnt meat ends, chile-lime sauce, red onions and scallions): see my picture and just do it!- Literally all of the sides are amazing and so complimentary to the meats, but definitely get the baked beans with burnt meat ends cooked in. They are smokey with a hint of sweetness, and soooo tastyIt's pretty standard pricing for these types of order-by-pound BBQ spots, but always worth the price.",,,

We ordered the brisket sandwich, baked beans, and Mac n cheese with a bottle of wine and sat outside. We found our table with our name written out all ready to go (pic) and the food was delicious! The brisket was very tender, the beans were flavorful, and the Mac and cheese was different than any other I've had (had a sweetness to it). What would keep me going back other than the delicious food was the attentiveness from the staff, they are lovely people. We asked for a list of names so I could mention them in a post and along with that the manager, Aaron, brought over samples of the s'mores bread pudding (pic)...amazing!!!

The potato salad and beans had great flavor but were a tad undercooked imo. Huge pet peeve is undercooked potatoes in potato salad.

I had read about their famous Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich and I just had to try it... so we stayed.Alert: Do not order this sandwich! Underneath the bun was a mushy, bland, not-spicy piece of chicken. The soggy slaw and pickles seemed old and had no snap. To top it all off, the bun was actually cold!

54,Uche I.,"New York, NY",175,10,0,2.0,1/28/2018,"...Where do I begin? My boyfriend and I visited this establishment after reading stellar reviews online. He was excited to try out the burnt tips, which turned out to be more burnt than tips themselves. I had the brisket, which was the driest brisket I've had in my existence. I ordered a single serving of brisket, which somehow ended up being larger than the half pound of burnt tips my boyfriend ordered. To make matters worse, each side was about $7 after taxes. The side of mac 'n cheese was offensive. It had feta (presumably) and bread crumbs, and reminded me of the slop you receive in the cafeteria during middle school, if I'm being honest. The corn fritters were decent, but if you're going to offer them in place of cornbread, then add more than 2 or 3 pieces of corn per fritter. Honestly, had I seen beforehand that they offered kale slaw as a side, I would've gotten the hint, and hopefully, you will, too.Lastly, any BBQ joint should offer more than one BBQ sauce. And when someone asks for sweet tea, it shouldn't consist of sprinkles of unmelted, grainy sugar as flavoring. Needless to say, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.",,1,

Highly addictive. It's the perfect blend of bacon, onion, and other mix-ins.I also order the chicken sandwich frequently, but occasionally it's followed by The Regret. The regret:Their product and managerial oversight is inconsistent. Tonight I ordered the BBQ Crispy (chicken sandwich) and it was served on a noticeably hard and stale bun, which I then returned to the evening manager.  He met my complaint with a general apathy and malaise (""what do you expect"")?Another inconsistency is their cut of brisket/meats. I once ordered the brisket, the cut of which was over half fat. The staff mentioned it was an overly fatty slab, but mentioned it was policy to not trim any off or rebalance the fat/meat proportions to a normal level.

Fletcher's burnt end at Brooklyn is much better. It's too much sauce on this thing. Brisket: pretty good. Quite tender and beefy. Brono rib: this only comes in one pound with bone-in. Definitely my favorite cut here. It's tender, moist and juicy. The rub was slightly burnt that gave it the charcoal taste. Pork ribs: half pound of this. It's done quite well.

The boyfriend got a half pound of beef brisket and I got a half rack of baby back ribs. We shared a medium mac and cheese and cucumbers and chilli peppers on the side. That was more than enough to fill up our empty bellies. We were so happy when we saw our server carving up our meat in front of us. We decided to sit outside because it was poorly lit inside (part of the rustic chic charm I suppose) and people were very loud.The meat was expertly charred, no frills - except for our server who sprinkled rock salt over it after cutting it (like Salt Bae). All the meat left a smoky aftertaste in our mouths.We drenched all the meat in their delicious sweet barbecue sauce. In particularly I couldn't stop munching on the chilli peppers.

81,Mary J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,145,23,2.0,1/8/2018,"I'm writing this as I pick at some of the worst ""bbq"" brisket I've ever had. Granted it's NYC BBQ which already sets the bar pretty low, but I've had beef jerky that was juicier than this. If I need to hack at it with a knife at all let alone for several seconds, something is wrong. I eat here pretty regularly and it has started to become hit or miss. And don't bother with the sides. Seriously. How do you eff up coleslaw? They're nice people working here, but $17 for a half-eaten meal is a no-no.",1,,
82,Keesha S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,38,113,4.0,3/4/2018,I acme her on a Saturday night it was wasn't packed it was our first time. The manager I believe that's who he was explained the menu with us. I had the brisket which I loved the manager told me that it's smoked for for 18 days or 18 hours I don't remember the bbq sauce was delicious I also ordered the wings too they were just ok my fiancé really liked them . The Mac and cheese is really good too. They have beer there I would of liked it better to if they had cocktails. I also liked that the manager came to us to make sure we liked everything . I would of given 5 stars I thought they didn't have a lot of variety when it comes to the sides I would come back.,,,
83,Mindy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,296,769,3.0,12/16/2016,"Mighty Quinn's has good BBQ. I was expecting a lot more than I got, but that being said, it was still pretty good. The service is fine, nothing too out of the ordinary, but did hope for a little more helpfulness when I was asking questions about the food. The store is a good size for being in New York, but grab a table when you can because tables go fast! I didn't realize that they had BBQ bottle near the register and ate my meat without it, but definitely try to look for those BBQ bottles when you're here!",1,,
84,George B.,"Bronx, NY",191,167,92,4.0,3/7/2016,Great day in the it's you've a late winter BBQ with friends. I've been to the LES location and now here and again I wasn't disappointed. My friends and I enjoyed a great lunch with great tasting beer. My first time to Mighty Quinn's was on the Lower Eastside where we waited on line which was out the door. Now we returned to this location in early March and it was the complete opposite with the same amazing result. I recommend!!!,,,
85,Martin N.,"Middletown, NY",21,79,211,5.0,1/8/2018,The dirty fries are the thing I take an hour long train for. I think they are the best thing on the menu. The burnt ends are also great! The staff was also friendly. Try to come early becauce the lines can be long around 6-7pm but it is always worth the wait!,,,
86,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,5.0,9/10/2015,First I was hipped to Mighty Quinn because of Smorgsburg in Williamsburg.  My husband and I decided to stop into this location to get some delicious BBQ!  I believe we got there when they just opened.  We ordered ribs and a pulled pork sandwich.  The young lady that prepared our food was very sweet and kind.  Once you order and pay for your food you pick a seat where ever you like.  Mighty Quinn has plenty of tables so you never wait for one.  They also have about two tables are near the open window.  If you see one open on a nice day then grab itHands down I believe Mighty Quinn is the best BBQ in the city. Only thing I noticed that I didn't care for is our cashier was blowing on her nails the entire time.  I am guessing she just got her nails done before she came to work and they were wet. Why would come to work with wet nails and be handling peoples' drinks and food?,3,3,2

Mighty Quinn's NY / NJ franchises are comparable and I dare say better than Texas's Rudy's BBQ. The brisket is moist and has a fine bark. It comes on that familiar red butcher paper or in a sandwich with all the fixins'. At less than $10, it is a steal at NYC pricing. Splurge and get a side of crispy pomme frites.",3,3,3
91,Regular G.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",6,13,5,5.0,7/11/2017,"Visited this fabulous BBQ spot with good friends and met other good guys.  Don't believe anyone who tells you that the meat fell off the ribs and was soft as butter until you eat here!!  This spot serves the holy grail of beef ribs!You will take food home from your plate, and most likely will order another plate to go as well.",,,
92,David S.,"Livingston, NJ",78,45,236,5.0,3/19/2017,"In my opinion there is no better BBQ that even comes close to Mighty Quinn's and I do not say that lightheartedly. I am a super fan of BBQ. I eat it everywhere I go. I've eaten BBQ everywhere from NY to Vancouver and everywhere in between. I even smoke my own meat and have competed on the BBQ circuit. But since I started eating at MQs almost two years ago I've had to stop making my own BBQ. Their food is THAT good. I ate there the other night and took some friends that are all aficionados as well. We all agreed. THE BEST!My favorite is the ribs. They are our perfection Perfect smoke ring, slightly chewy and fall off the bone. I love the very light brushing (I want to emphasize very light brushing) of sauce and a sprinkle of sea salt. Whoever thought of the sea salt is a genius!Their brisket is also perfect. They do pulled pork and when I was there they had a special addition of Pastrami which was out of this world. They do great sides of baked beans, two kinds of slaw (with mayo and without) onion rings and fries. A great selection of beers including one of their own brews rounds out the menu. They have many other menu items but I recommend you go and explore for yourself. Three locations in NYC and one in NJ make it easy to get a BBQ fix just about anytime. My only issue with Mighty Quinn's is trying to stay away when I'm trying to watch my caloric intake!",2,1,

And I was still hungry!Tried ordering the burnt ends with a small side of baked beans another time ($14+tax), it was a little more filling/heavy. Good if you're need to knock that southern bbq craving & if you're in west village area. But based on the portion sizes & prices, I'm not dying to come back.",,,
94,Dianna S.,"Joplin, MO",245,414,59,4.0,6/16/2016,"One thing hubby and I have never done while traveling is eat at a casual BBQ restaurant.  Normally, we go all out and hit several fine dining places, but we were watching some show on Food Network or Cooking Channel (one of the two) and Mighty Quinn's was featured (very well, I might add) and that sealed the deal.  Hubby called and made reservations.Turns out, this is wayyyyy more casual than expected.  There was no hostess, so no one checked us in for our reservation.  However, it wasn't crowded so we could order right away anyway.  You go through the line and tell them what you want and when you get to the end of the line, you pay for it.  Easy peasy.Hubby got the Brontosaurus Rib, which is an embarrassingly large piece of meat.  I ordered the pulled pork and broccoli salad, then we split and order of dirty fries.  First of all, the meats were tremendous.  Such a delicious, indulgent flavor.  Some of the best BBQ I've ever had.  Broccoli salad was good, but nothing out of this world.  But the Dirty Fries - holy moly!  These were smothered with burnt ends, scallions and chili-lime sauce and were so heavenly, I could have pushed everything else aside and eaten just those all by myself.  For real, don't bother with any other sides - just order Dirty Fries!Very good meal.  And it was kind of nice to have something casual for a change.  We might have to incorporate that idea more often!",1,,1
95,Ellie A.,"Westport, CT",1,8,0,4.0,1/7/2018,"GREAT QUALITY, especially considering the relatively low prices. This is one of those places that really does live up to the hype. I've had the pulled pork and it's juicy and delicious, especially when you get the roll on the side and drizzle lots of extra barbecue sauce on it. This place is a cheap, delicious gem amidst many restaurants of overpriced mediocrity.",,,
96,Jessica V.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,7,0,5.0,5/10/2018,"Listen, you are stupid if you try and go to the east village location. I've been dying to try Mighty Quinn's for the longest but that location is always packed. Then I discovered the west village location one day and almost lost my shit. Went late afternoon right before dinner time and there was barely anyone in there. Perfect! I was expecting this to be a pretty pricey meal as bbq in nyc usually is, but surprisingly it wasn't at all and I was comfortably full with their portions. Whenever I go to a bbq spot I always get their brisket. It's for sure a tell tale of how good their bbq is. Well let me tell you, their brisket was amazing! And yes I tried it first without their sauce slathered all over it. Had a great sticky sweet crisp on the outside and super tender and juicy in the middle. Melted in your mouth. I then of course tried it with their sauce, because why not and the sauce is really good. My friend had the pulled pork which was also very flavorful. Also got the Mac and cheese and the burnt end baked beans. Mac and cheese was so so good. Super creamy and incredibly rich in cheese flavor. Burnt end baked beans, need I say more? Awesome! You may be saying oh what does this girl from nyc know about bbq. I've been to Austin and tried my fair share of bbq meats and I can definitely put it up there with them. Def not above them because Texas kills it but it's for sure a close contender. All in all I will be going back and getting the same exact thing because it was that good. If you wanna check it out, your best bet is going to this location like I did and for sure getting the same things I did because it won't disappoint",,,

I ordered the brisket and sweet potato casserole as a side. My bf ordered the pulled pork which he loved. I tried a piece of the pork, but it wasn't for me... I didn't really like the taste of it, but I really liked the brisket I ordered. The meat was very tender and juicy, not dry at all. The sauce I put on top made it even tastier!I took one bite of the sweet potato side and it was TOO sweet for me...I could only eat half... maybe I'll try a different side next time.And I wish there was a bigger portion for the price of the meat..for 2 people, the cost of the meal was almost $30 and we were still hungry afterwards.",1,1,

I had the half chicken with a side of mac & cheese, burnt end baked beans and, for my finicky daughter, an order of pomme frites. The chicken was good. The baked beans...lawd! They were so, sooo good! The mac & cheese...grew on me. It had an aftertaste. Nothing bad. It was just...I dunno, probably the result of some seasoning that was used. The more I ate, the less I noticed it. Would I get it again? Hellz yes! I ate a few of my daughter's fries. They were seasoned so well. Delicious with no extra condiments necessary. Only thing was their bbq sauce. It was thin &...meh. I was hoping it'd be thick, sweet and tangy like Sweet Baby Ray's *lipsmack* I'm looking forward to returning. I'll just swap out the sauce.",,,

The brisket was my favorite. Tender and flavorful, no need for BBQ sauce. Spare ribs were also good, smokey flavor with great cartilage. Dirty frites consisted of French fries mixed with the burnt ends of brisket, a spicy sauce and onions. The sauce is quite spicy so you might want to get it on the side, I should've.

105,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2672,3521,16559,4.0,2/1/2016,"For a city that has practically everything food wise, the running joke was NYC lacked any true Southern BBQ scene. (#1) If it wasn't imported via festivals (think Big Apple BBQ) then it was a deflection to the uptown BBQ joints to suggest our state of BBQ affairs was just fine. The recent years have been kinder to cue fans: Brooklyn's Red Hook and Gowanus scene have received a nice boost of super legit BBQ spots worthy of Texan/Carolina comparisons. For Manhattan, Mighty Quinn's has managed to showcase a variety of smoked meats to become BBQ option #1.After a brief start at Smorgasburg where they had lines of New Yorkers crazy for their meats, prompting the opening of their first standalone location in the East Village. There are waits here as well, but their fast casual(ish) setting keeps the herds moving.Supposedly the meats are all slow cooked via hardwood for hours each day. It certainly shows; most of the meats I've sampled from the pulled pork to the brisket to the impressive dinosaur rib (beef rib)and recognize their tender, smoky flavor that many other  Manhattan spots have failed in matching. It won't topple anything people have tried in Texas, but considering the real estate and space alone, this effort is practically herculean.Don't skimp on the sides. The ""Burnt End Beans"" are molasses laden baked beans with bits of thick cut bacon and is worth ordering anytime. The same goes for the Sweet Potato Casserole, a maple pecan crusted side enriched by its sweetness. I haven't been sold on the Edamame Salad so much but it remains a popular choice nonetheless. I personally love coming here in a group and ordering a round of their beers on tap. Seating is not always guaranteed, but the food is worth the wait. _________(#1) Dallas BBQ does not count.",23,15,16
106,Bunny B.,"New York, NY",95,95,296,2.0,1/1/2017,"My brisket tonight was dry and served on a 1.5 inch thick stale brioche bun. It desperately needed sauce - not a good sign. Those generous heaps of pickles I've raved about before are now about 1-2 tablespoons each. The fries and pickles were tasty and definitely the highlight our our meal. The whole point of BBQ is to indulge in something succulent and flavorful - even though it was far from being lean meat, this brisket managed to be dry and sad. A waste of calories. I really hope it was just an off night.",3,1,2

Lets start with the service in this place. The staff were very nice and helpful when it came to choosing my order. The food tho was a different story. I ordered the brisket with the ribs. The issue that I had with the food is that it was extremely cold and dry and the price was through the roof. The food actually tasted decent, but I can't stand bbq when its cold like that.

As mentioned on the menu, they are insanely spicy. Make sure to get some of the free pickles on the side, because they are mouth-numbingly hot.We also got the Brisket Sandwich ($9), which was as excellent as ever, with a good mix of lean and fatty with salt on top, and the amazingly soft, puffy bun.Get the Burnt Ends Baked Beans or the Buttermilk Broccoli Salad too for an incredibly satisfying meal.",14,7,10

There was a line that almost reached the door, but it also moved fairly quickly (~15 minutes). We weren't sure if 1/2 a pound of brisket would be enough for the two of us, so we almost asked for the whole pound - later, we were so glad we hadn't. The red peppers aren't that spicy, so don't be scared! The slight spicyness really adds to the rather heavy and salty BBQ flavor. We also got the dirty fries and broccoli salad on the side. I had expected the broccoli salad to have been drenched in mayo or something like that, but it was surprisingly non-greasy and actually tasty! I loved the nuts mixed into the salad. The dirty fries were quite good as well, though it didn't help too much with the overall saltiness of the meal haha. The meat was definitely the best part of the meal.

Brisket was not heavily seasoned and they add a pitch of sea salt after cutting your portion. The ribs were the star though. Easily pulled off the bone. They tasted just as good without adding sauce; though their BBQ sauce added a dimension of sweetness. For sides Frites(nice and crunchy), mac and cheese( creamy with slight kick on back end), and burnt ends baked beans(pass on these)I would certainly return here or try one of their other locations if in the area.",,,1

Staff was as usual, friendly and very attentive. The prices are always on par and consistent with the other locations, which I really like about Mighty Quinn's. My thought is that the line will be a lot more manageable with the large space, so I'm inclined to make the trek across town to come here, if I don't want to wait outside in the lines in East Village.My go-to meal is the brisket sandwich, a side of burnt ends baked beans, or pomme frites. I always ask for extra coleslaw, pickles, and red onions, and the staff has always obliged. Hah. If I'm craving a bigger portion, I just ask for a half pound of brisket instead of the normal single portion. Also, be careful when ordering large sides because the sizes are actually flippin' huge. We once got a large sweet potato casserole and couldn't finish it for 3 days.If I'm in the area and craving barbecue and beer, I'll definitely hit up Mighty Quinn's.",4,1,
128,Dominick B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,113,0,2.0,7/16/2017,"Not good...... Got the brisket and ""burnt ends"". Major disappointment. Brisket was like mushy London broil. It fell apart as I picked it up with a fork. Rather than being juicy and succulent with a char and a ribbon of fat, it was tasteless, and dry and mushy at the same time....tasted old... The ""burnt ends"" were not burnt, rather cubes of stew meat with a cheap, sweet bbq sauce... The look of a brown pile of dump on the unappetizing brown paper was one that still turns me off... Left half of both on the cafeteria tray and jetted to Joe's Pizza.... Mighty Quinn's was mighty shitty..... Suburban mall, food court stuff...",,,
129,Michael C.,"Queens, NY",468,22,71,3.0,6/10/2017,"Went here with a group of 10 people after waiting weeks for a reservation on a Thursday night...I thought i was more like restaurant than a cafeteria !! You wait in line to order the food you want from ""the butcher"", who cuts up fresh meat by the pound ...Kinda like the cafeteria at school..lol.. A few extras on the menu they have to make but otherwise everything is ready...All the meats were delicious..Wasn't crazy about the mac n cheese but the sweet potato mash thingy was slamming !! Roast pork was yum yum yum.. The prices are a little high but it is fresh meats + Manhattan !! The ambience was aaight, ridiculously dark and loud in there... i asked the manager to turn up the lights but nothing..Overall with me its all about the food which was really good - Was it worth all the hype i heard ? Absolutely not..But if you wanna grab a quick hardy lunch to go or dinner its fine. Basically it BBQ so don't go in expecting filet mignon ..Cute, not fierce but cute..",,1,

133,Dan C.,"New York, NY",980,892,474,4.0,8/24/2015,"There is a dearth of inexpensive places to eat in the West Village.  Let's also add that there are not many fast to-go places to eat in the West Village, either.  Enter Mighty Quinn's.  Solid BBQ at reasonable prices, served up Chipotle fast.  If you are on the go, you can be in and out with a bag of awesomeness in just a couple of minutes.  I go there often and we get the BBQ spareribs and the brisket.  The food is served either as a single serving or by the pound.  You can also add bread to your order as well.  In addition to the BBQ, they give a few small sides for free like coleslaw, cucumbers, etc.  They also have sides like baked beans and a really good broccoli and bacon combo that is simply fantastic.  Let's return to the BBQ for a second.  The sauce is fantastic.  It is really good.  You will find yourself slathering your pile of meat with the stuff.  The service here is really good as well.  Everyone is really nice and they move you along quickly.  This is a fantastic gem of a meat palace.",5,1,2

144,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,3.0,5/23/2015,"First of all, I'm from Texas...the real Texas, not Dallas, Houston or Austin. I grew up on a cattle ranch in West Texas, so I think I know a little about BBQ. So I'm not sure what all the hype is about Miqhty Quinn's.  If you want great BBQ, don't waste your time or money here, just go to Hill Country BBQ.  But that being said, keep in mind that NO BBQ in the Northeast will ever be as good as it is in TX, TN, NC, KC, etc. It's like expecting an amazing lobster roll in St. Louis or great NY-style pizza in Little Rock, just doesn't exist, so BBQ places in NYC need to be compared to other BBQ places here. And as good as Hill Country BBQ is, it still won't be as good as getting it in Lockhart, TX. On to the review...we basically ordered everything to try it all:1. Brisket: 3-stars, edible and better than places like BeeBeeQ's (Dallas BBQ) or Virgil's, but nothing to write home about.  Has a nice 'smoke ring' to it, but looks better than it tastes. They also sprinkle sea salt on top when they serve it to you, which I find strange, cause really good brisket doesn't need anything on it, including sea salt or even BBQ sauce. 2. Burnt Ends: 3-stars, same as above, but they're actually not the burnt ends, it's more like shredded beef brisket drowning in BBQ sauce. Look at my pic to see what I mean. 3. Sausage: 1-star, sausage was grey-white in color and had no flavor for the most part. Didn't even finish it. 4. Spicy Wings: 3-stars, these were not really my thing, but edible. Tasted more like spicy Asian wings, or a poor-man's Pok Pok if you know what I mean.5. Sweet Potato Mash: 5-stars, best thing on the menu. Very good ratio of sweet potato to pecans to maple. 6. Baked Beans: 3-stars, just ok. 7. Broccoli Salad: 2-stars, you know those prepackaged broccoli/carrot/celery/ranch plastic party platters you get at a grocery store? Where the broccoli tastes raw and is crunchy? That's basically what this salad is with some bacon & almonds. 8. Coleslaw: 3-stars, basic coleslaw, nothing to write home about. 9. ""Pickled"" Cucumbers: 1-star, not even pickled, basically just sliced cucumbers with a slight vinegar taste.Overall, Mighty Quinn's is slightly better than an average BBQ spot in the city, but if you want great BBQ, don't waste your time or money here, just go to Hill Country.  But remember, even that will be more expensive and not as good as what you'd get at BBQ's places in the South.",6,2,4

Not the best I've ever had, but it hit the spot .Pulled pork: This was my least favorite of the meats.  Too fatty and not very.. pulled?  Not sure if we just got a bad piece since I've only tried it once.Spare ribs: outstanding!   Loved these.  Perfectly cooked and tasty.Frites: amazing fries.  Wish we'd gotten two orders.  They come out to your table hot and crispy, just the right amount of salt...perfect.Corn fritters: Very tasty.  Like hush puppies but fried corn pudding instead of fried corn bread.  Came with a nice spicy/honey dipping glaze.  basically corn donuts.Beet salad: weak point of the meal.  Totally bland, so this was disappointing.The accompaniments (slaw, ""pickles"") were basically garnish.  Don't waste your tummy room on them.  They did offer hard root beer which was new to me and a total revelation.  I recommend it!The space itself is a decent size and, based on our saturday-at-6-pm visit, not at all crowded. We will probably make this our go-to spot for a meal before the High Line.",,,

The brisket is cut and sprinkle with sea salt on the top when you order, which really bring up the intense meat flavor. However, I didn't get to try their Brontosaurus ribs because it will take them 40+ min to cook, and I was getting hangry. The place got outdoor seating.

It was really expensive to go, definitely a splurge not somewhere you would go for a typical meal. Kind of set up like a Chipotle where you pick out what you want and pay at the end. I got a pork and sandwich, mashed sweet potatoes and a beer and it came out to be like 20+. Once got over the price the food was bomb! My favorite was probably the sweet potatoes me I don't usually like walnuts but it was so warm and good and sweet with the brown sugar.

159,Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",383,381,1085,4.0,4/25/2015,"I'll start by saying, don't bother making a reservation. We came on a Sunday night with a reservation for a table for 5. There's no hostess and there are no waiters, so there's no one on the floor you can ask about your table. When we asked they were caught off guard and offered us drinks until someone got up, but we were able to snag a table for 4 and put a chair at the end. Here's how it works, you order either single (which can come on a bun) or by the pound. Except for the beef rib, that comes on its own. I like that the sides come in sizes too and the small is actually quite large. We ordered way too much stuff, but I'm glad we did because almost everything was amazing. Here's the run down:Beef rib: Massive. Super tender with a nice hard crust on the outside. I prefer the one here to the one at Hometown and it was half the price but similar in size. Brisket: Hands down the best brisket I've ever had. Not too lean, not too fatty. Falling apart tender and still quite moist. It was addicting. Burnt ends: I don't care too much for burnt ends but these were good. Had a nice crust. Chicken thighs: These, I'm sad to say, just weren't good. They were super dry and hard. Not ideal. Sausage: My second favorite. Very juicy inside. Smokey but not overpowering. Corn fritters: These weren't exactly what I had in mind. I was thinking a crunchy exterior with creamy corn inside but this was more like a hush puppy with some kernels of corn inside. Still pretty good. Loved the honey pepper sauce that accompanied it. Sweet potato casserole: Super sweet and extra delicious. I'm not a huge fan of this sort of stuff but the real maple syrup worked for me.Coleslaw: There's was so good. Crunchy, not too wet or heavy. I enjoyed it and I'm not a coleslaw fan.I'd definitely return. Their brisket is out of this world and their prices are fair. No wonder their line is the longest at Smorgasburg!",3,1,2

This is a great place to go with a big group -- not only because they have large tables but because then you can share a bit of everything.We had the spare ribs, pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage.

The briaket sandwich is the classic since that was the only thing they sold at smorgasburg but trust me: order e v e r y t h i n g!!Brisket, pulled pork, ribs, coleslaw, beans, the mashed sweet potatoes with pecans, even the pickles are amazing. The dinosaur rib or whatever is called is way overpriced but everything else is right on the money.

166,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,195,459,4.0,4/26/2015,"Made a reservation here only to discover it really isn't a restaurant, its a better version of tres carne with American bbq. This place has a very backyard bbq with the family feel that I had liked, especially with very welcoming staff, they were happy and very active. My party had the burnt ends & the brisket both with coleslaw, pickles & pickled onions. All very very tasty especially when accompanied with the table bbq sauce. The meat is cut when you order and presented very neatly, it doesn't look like a lot until you've actually started easy and realize how much goes into it. My first time having burnt ends I was very happy with my choice.My only issue was the food could've been hotter, the brisket was on the warm side and eaten quickly to avoid being cold. The lemonade is good but very sweet, I'd suggest splitting a lemonade into two cups of water.Will return to this place again as I do find myself in the area often.",1,,

Compared to the one in the East Village, the barbecue at this location is mediocre at best.What?!No smoking or cooking of any kind happens at this location--all the food is trucked in to this location from the East Village and Jersey. What's the problem with that? Once the meat is smoked, it then sits in a hotbox all day as it makes its journey across the city and becomes mushy. The brisket can barely be cut without falling apart, the flavor is lacking, and the bark separates from the meat.A serious letdown compared to my first run-in with Mighty Quinn's.",1,1,

I also got a single serving of spare ribs ( comes with 4), and a side of mayonnaise based cold slaw. Really flavorful tender meat. I liked both of the cold slaw's.

I'm pretty sure this is the main activity of her job. I don't need someone to be all sunshiny and smily when taking my order (I live in NYC for crying out loud), but when you are down right rude, I will tell others about your bad attitude and never return. You can't have ""ok"" bbq AND bad manners. There are way to many other places in NYC for that.",,1,
173,Mark B.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",20,745,3,5.0,5/19/2015,"We stopped in for lunch and were blown away by the delicious food!Decor: A somewhat regular storefront that leads to a lot of exposed brick and tons of seating inside (with some room outside as well). The main focus is on the food serving/ordering area, as well it should be, with ample natural light provided by the door/windows in the front. Like I said, there is plenty of room for any size group and everything is immaculately clean.Bathroom: A bit dark, but keeps with the same vibe as the rest of the place; it's very clean.Staff: The food servers/preparers and the cashier were all very friendly and very FAST at getting our food ready. Granted, there was zero line but I'm confident it because they move people in and out of there so rapidly.Food: We each came for the Burnt Ends (sandwich) but added a Brontosaurus Rib and some Sweet Potato Casserole. Everything was outstanding! Seriously, this is really, REALLY good BBQ. The rib was the absolute shining star though... not only did it taste wonderful, the course salt was a nice touch, but it was amazing tender and so juicy! Wow! I did wish I had ordered the Wings but I'm glad I didn't b/c by the time we finished everything I was STUFFED.Value: The prices are not bad and about what you would expect from a place like this. I will say that the Brontosaurus Rib is a bit expensive but, then again, it's probably about 1.5 - 2lbs. of pure beef. You won't leave feeling like you didn't get your money's worth here.MQ's is a great spot to grab a bite and, if you have a hankering for BBQ, it's a SOLID spot to visit. I can't wait to return for another B.Rib and to try the Wings!",,,
174,Haley H.,"New York, NY",197,26,6,4.0,5/19/2017,"I come from the South and one thing I really miss is the BBQ, so I'm really happy to have found this place. They serve absolutely delicious, melt in your mouth brisket. We got a side of fries and a side of mac & cheese which were both ok. The mac & cheese was a little too rich for me (thought it was a hot day, seated outside, drinking a beer so perhaps that had an influence). Neither were bad, but skip the sides and focus on the good stuff - THE MEAT.",,,
175,Lucy S.,"Charlotte, NC",11,83,145,5.0,6/21/2016,"Super obsessed with the place. The food is amazing, the drink selection is wonderful and the staff just brighten my day. I got the special of pork cheeks and all of the pickled sides and I was not disappointed at all. Mighty Quinn's is the best barbecue in New York City, hands down. Their sauce is spicy and tangy but also has its sweet moments, I drown my meat in them. The mighty Quinn's Pilsner is also amazing, smooth and hoppy, just be way I like my beer. I got an entire pint for 7 and my entree for 10. I had leftovers to bring home and left super satisfied. I also want to make a shoutout to the staff there. Everyone is super helpful, patient, lively and HILARIOUS. The woman who took my order didn't hesitate to explain every component of each meat dish (how it was cooked, her personal favorites and so on) and the woman at the cash register and the man distributing the sides cracked jokes and we're just genuinely happy and spontaneous. This place is fantastic and I'd recommend it to just about everyone.",,,
176,Laksen R.,"New York, NY",312,392,24,4.0,1/18/2015,Came here one rainy night to grab dinner. We were the only customers in here when we dined. This location is pretty big so you should be able to find seating most of the time. We tried an assortment of things but I will be certainly coming back for the brisket and the burnt ends. We also got the wings which were instantly devoured. Yes there might be better BBQ but I will be definitely coming back because of the convenience of the location and the moderately priced options. Note you order cafeteria style.,1,1,1
177,Fernanda F.,"Arlington, VA",0,32,1,1.0,3/26/2017,I only gave it one star to post a rating for an allergen alert not for the quality or taste of the food. The place looked and smelled great but for anyone with fish allergies this restaurant serves BBQ sauce with some kind of fish in it. Such a shame since it looked yummy.,,,
178,Fred D.,"New Brunswick, NJ",9,23,1,5.0,6/27/2016,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! The burnt ends are a MUST! And if you get a chance, definitely try the wings, they're unreal!Oh and all the pickled veggies are top notch!",,,
179,Jessica P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,69,147,3.0,1/1/2015,"Cute and casual. Brisket was flavorful but the portion is on the small side; it seems they give you the same amount whether you get the protein in a sandwich or ""naked.""  The corn fritters were nice but they were a little overdone, on the darker side. The honey dipping sauce was nothing to write home about, but they were good dipped in the BBQ sauce. The slaw and pickled sides were great but again, very small portion. Overall this place is ok for a quick fix but not if you're looking for hearty portions or traditional sides. There's no mac or collards, for example.",1,1,1
180,Taiyo O.,"New York, NY",911,587,1071,4.0,11/17/2014,"Early weekend dinner4:40pmPickupReasonably priced good American food, sweet, fatty, and salty. They have a good list of American beers to go with.Brisket (naked) $9.25It was juicy and meaty but I found my portion was rather small. I wanted more meat.Spicy Wings $7.50Although the review on this wings are very positive, my wings were just okay. A touch of Asian flavor (soy sauce?) was coming through nicely in the mighty sauce and it was interesting and tasty but I think my wings had passed its peak. Burnt End Baked Beans $3.10It was tasty. Big chunk of meat were nice surprise but very sweet BBQ sauce that overpowered the house-made beans.Sweet Potato Casserole $3.10I enjoyed this sweet thing. Potato was soft and lovely. Some pecans gave a nice texture.Roasted Beet Salad $3.10It would be better if my salad was fresh. For dessert, one of the servers who helped me said, ""I like it!"" How she said was so cute so I got that too. It was delicious as she said and gave me a smile. It was a sweet and filling pudding. Vanilla cream sauce that was drizzled over the pudding and delicious. The sauce must be a mixture of melted butter, milk, sugar, and fresh vanilla. Who doesn't like that combination.- No call and pickup service here -When I want a pickup, I call ahead to eliminate any wait time. When I called to order, I got an unprofessional reply and a tad of rudeness. I blame the manager. She needs a customer care training. Contrary to E.V. store, the space is cold and dark but natural light coming from Greenwich avenue and having outdoor seatings during the day must be better.",4,2,2

182,Todd C.,"New York, NY",132,31,97,4.0,10/21/2015,"Food here is done right!! The spicy smoked beans (forgot menu name) side is almost a meal, and you only need a small. Get the brisket, which has been slow cooked for hours.. resulting in an insanely fatty tender brisket. I've been to MQ quite a few times and have no intentions to slow down.",4,3,4

Best wings ever, and let me add that I don't even like wings.Even the sides are great, the broccoli salad is my husband's favorite, now that's a big deal. When in doubt, go to Mighty Quinn's!",,1,
184,Anthony T.,"Jamaica, NY",244,288,591,4.0,1/5/2017,this is a dope spot down on greenwich. i came here with friends after drinking one night and they have some nice BBQ! i got the Pulled pork sandwich i believe which was delicious. it is kinda on the pricey side but i guess you get what you pay for. me and my friends came here like 12 am and the line went pretty fast. YUMMM go here!,,,
185,Melvon C.,"New York, NY",90,220,53,5.0,2/11/2017,This Is The Best Barbeque I've Had So Far In My Life! On My Last Visit I Gotten Pork Witch Is Server With BBQ Already And Vinegar That's Included With The Meal. It Was So Good! It Was A Great Portion Size Too. I Give This Restaurant  Up!,,,
186,Laura M.,"Bethlehem, PA",19,22,14,4.0,6/5/2016,"Really good BBQ, fair prices. I got the spare ribs and the brisket (both the individual sized portions ~$10 a piece) the brisket was some of the best I've ever had. Good smokey flavor, super tender. The ribs were equally delicious. Their house sauce was also very good. Nice vinegary taste without overpowering. At first glance after ordering I didn't think the quantity of food would be enough, however it ended up being a good amount. I got the fries as a side (~$4) and a beer- they have both draft and bottle as well as wine. Overall a good spot for some great BBQ.",,,
187,Anna K.,"Manhattan, NY",134,73,138,2.0,3/3/2015,"For the price you pay- it wasn't much. I got the pulled pork with a beet salad. In addition, there was a lot of fat as opposed to the meat. With that said, The meat and the sauce was superb. The meat was moist and tender and so so juicy. It was smoked to perfection and did not have any charcoal flavor. The barbecue sauce was just mouthwatering making you want to lick your fingers off.",,,
188,Stephen B.,"Manhattan, NY",16,45,11,5.0,4/6/2016,"Came here for the first time last Friday and the ambiance was dope, with the open doors and the breeze coming through---reminded me of the South. The food was everything I had hoped it'd be: brisket melted in my mouth and the pulled pork was some of the best I've had. I kinda wish they had mustard based? The one thing I regretted was only getting the single naked portion of brisket. I ended up being kinda hungry afterwards (which I guess is good because I then got to eat my gf's pork which I liked better). Next time I'll get a half pound (I'm awful and disgusting).My one gripe? No Mac and cheese and no traditional corn bread. With that said, the meat and other sides are by far enough to outweigh this. Burnt ends baked beans and corn fritters alllmoossssttt made me forget how badly I wanted Mac and cheese!Can't wait to try the UES location.....",,,
189,Martin W.,"Brooklyn, NY",174,598,437,4.0,2/8/2015,"My friend wanted thai food and I was not really liking the place he was suggesting. So I said lets get bbq as we were walking down Greenwich Ave.I knew Mighty Quinn was here and havent had the brisket in some time. Plus it was Friday nite close to 10 pm. Place wasnt really that crowded but most tables were taken.The brisket was very very good I got it naked. Plus had the link of smoked sausage, was not really impressed with the flavor of the sausage. At the east village location they tasted much better more smokey goodness. Had some beet salad to go with this and that tasted very good.My friends enjoyed their orders as their cartons were completely empty. This location seems a little cozier then their east village location. I would surely return here again!!!",,,
190,Anre G.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",9,45,72,2.0,10/29/2016,"Place is hit or miss, for delivery. Have ordered  from them previously and was decent to average, though nothing to write home about. This occasion we placed a caviar order for their basket of brisket and 1/2 the meat received was all FAT. Perhaps their quality checks for dine-in experience is better. So, if looking for some down home barbeque i'd look elsewhere and if it's a delivery order be sure to review your order prior to that delivery guy exiting your doorway. As they say, 3 strikes and you're out and so is Mighty Quinn's Barbeque.",2,,
191,Nina K.,"Manhattan, NY",246,73,29,5.0,9/27/2015,"Mighty Quinn's has great food and a great concept. It's a fast, Chipotle-style line but the protein choices are about 10x more mouth-watering than Chipotle's or any equivalent. And this is coming from a shameless Chipaddict. But back to bbq. I've only had the pulled pork sandwich here because it's been so good that I haven't wanted to try anything else. A friend I was with did enjoy their ribs and I've been meaning to come back for the spicy chicken sandwich and wings.The fries deserve their own paragraph. They're thick, hand-cut and never too crispy; comparable to the most addicting kind of fries you can find at a baseball park or state fair. A heaping portion of meat plus one side - I'd obviously choose the fries but did enjoy the sweet potato casserole here too - is only about $12. And you can add on as many other sides as you'd like, appetite and budget permitting. Top off the meal with a craft beer or an artisanal ice cream sandwich then dine in their simple but spacious no-frills dining room. They're generous about giving as much extra barbecue sauce as you want and have bottles at each table. The takeout option is just as good and efficient, too!",3,2,4
192,Michael S.,"Streamwood, IL",0,5,0,2.0,8/13/2017,"I was pretty excited about coming to this place because it has been showcased on Food Network quite a few times. I left disappointed in my experienced there. We got there right when it opened up on Friday and the music choice was less than impressive with a young child and some hardcore rap playing that was not censored at all. We got burnt ends, a sausage link and a pulled pork sandwich. The lady behind the counter gave me the burnt ends that were already sauced. She didn't ask if I wanted them dry. My wife's pulled pork sandwich came not sauced though. The sausage links were not spicy, but had some good Italian sausage flavor. I felt with all the publicity and the prices, this place should have been more than it was.",,,
193,S K.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/26/2016,"Horrible service and attitude for their customer! Why are they asking me for paying a tip? This is not a normal restaurant, they don't even serve me a food.",1,1,1
194,Ciara R.,"East Orange, NJ",256,12,6,4.0,3/12/2016,"I saw this place on food network and wanted to give it a try. We came around 8 and the line was pretty long, good sign in my book. The food is served cafeteria style. Prices are per single portion or by the pound. I had the half chicken, and it was delicious! The potato salad is decent, liked the unique spice. The baked beans weren't ""Boston's"", that's for sure. I always wondered how baked beans could be made from scratch, I found out today #fail. Loved the stuffing and tasty nuggets of sausage inside of it. They also serve beer!I wouldn't go out my way for this place but if I was in the mood for BBQ and already near one, I'd come back. It's like a step above Famous Daves.",,,
195,Jasmeet A.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",34,45,23,1.0,7/24/2016,"I am in no way a BBQ expert but I think I know something about good food and I have been trying to find a decent BBQ joint in the city for quite a while. I wanted to give this place a shot and first off it has decent ambience, I wouldn't say it's representative of really authentic BBQ joints. We ordered the brisket, the fried chicken sandwich and wings - all were average. Pricing was a big sore point for me as I have had amazing food for this price. The quality of service was disappointing and all in all I would say I am never giving another dime of mine to this place.",,,

You can't go wrong with the brisket (my favorite), the ribs or pulled pork. Meats come with choices of pickles/coleslaw sides. Plus there are several changing(?) sides that are very tasty; I'm partial to the burnt ends baked beans and sweet potatoes.Plus an alright selection of beer (more traditional way to accompany the feast) AND wine (another option, as you see fit). On a nice day, they can open large windows to Greenwich Ave.  Good times!",2,,
198,Ally H.,"New York, NY",3,28,41,2.0,2/21/2016,We were really excited to try their food but left the place hungry and disappointed yesterday afternoon.  We tried the spare ribs which were dry.  We also tried the baked beans which were overwhelming sweet.  We had to throw out the food just after a few bites and look for a different place for lunch...I'm only giving 2 stars instead of 1 because they have lots of gluten free and dairy free options and post the allergen information online.,,,
199,Rachel A.,"Montreal, Canada",81,11,0,5.0,9/18/2015,"This was one of the culinary highlights of my recent trip.to New York!!   I shared an order of brisket and half a chicken.  The sides were a creamy and cheesy Mac and cheese,  a broccoli salad with buttermilk dressing and bacon, and a beet salad that straddled the line between fresh and pickled flavours.   The iced tea was unsweetened,  which I appreciated.   The one item that we passed on was the bread pudding.  Being a short walk away from Big Gay Ice Cream,  it was a logical albeit difficult choice.  We also passed on the Dirty Fries which sounded like they were poutine-tastic.If I lived in NYC I would be a regular at Mighty Quinn's to the point that if I missed a week my pic would be on a milk carton",1,1,1
