0,Shantee E.,"Manhattan, NY",27,33,114,4.0,11/5/2018,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It's one of my go tos when in the Chelsea / Meatpacking area day or night in NYC. They're open 24 hours! If you're going late night on a weekend get ready to wait on line. There's a private room available for parties and large guests, but gets booked quickly. Let's talk about why we are here!!....Their Mac attack is a must have! If you don't eat meat like myself, then you can double up on one of the other two options (the 3 options are: cheddar and fontina, smoked Gouda and bacon, truffle oil). Calamari is a hit or miss here. Last time I had it it was a little chewy.. was disappointed, but the broccolini and their garlic whipped potatoes made up for it. Salads here are also really good as well as their tomato basil soup. I've also had the veggie burger,  which is huge and delicious. I'm literally getting hungry writing this. So changing the subject -- Bathrooms are down their pretty stairs and are gender neutral. Overall, cute, chic restaurant with good American food to satisfy your cravings any time of the day!",1,,
1,Agy C.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",1,2,1,1.0,11/3/2018,"I stopped by before 4am with three of my friends on a raining night, looking for a quick bite. Once we arrived at the door we were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait, one of my friends was flustered we chose this late night spot because his last experience was terrible. He was made aware of this establishments racist antics because of a previous worker there (and his friend) had told him how the owners of this establishment are racist and have told their staff/security guards when it's late night and African-Americans come, to tell them there is a wait of at least 45 minutes. So when we arrive and get told there'd be a wait because everything was full he gets a little on edge, my female friend asked the security guard if it's necessary to wait in the pouring rain when we could wait inside, when the security guard comes back after saying let me see what I can do he says a table has just opened up and we could go in...so our total wait time went from an estimated 15-20 minutes to 2 minutes after my friend asked him eagerly if we could wait inside.Upon entering I noticed at least 3 tables that could seat a party of 4, which I found rather interesting since I didn't see groups of people exiting upon us entering.My friend refused to eat there because of his last experience where his waiter provided the utmost terrible service and treated them as if they were ""dumb"" customers who weren't valuable to their business.Our server that evening was certainly nicer than the descriptions of my friends previous server. However when I get my Mac n cheese to go I notice the size was definitely way smaller than a normal dine in portion.I was charged $11 for this portion of Mac n cheese, which is highly upsetting because I have dined in a few times before so I am aware that the portion I received to go is certainly not an equivalent to what I have gotten when I dined in.Long story short, my perception of Cafeteria has highly changed knowing that my African-American friends felt highly uncomfortable in this establishment because of a prior experience, and their lack of attention to detail when it came to my to go order.At least there a plenty of 24/7 places in the city that never sleeps that isn't Cafeteria that can satisfy my late night hunger.",2,,
2,Marlene S.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",1,43,2,3.0,10/14/2018,"This spot was quick and easy to get a seat in a Saturday afternoon. We were hungry and knew what we wanted. I had the Mac n cheese spring rolls with truffle fries and my friend had a Mac and cheese with biscuits. My spring rolls were fine, I wasn't wowed. The fries were yummy and I would definitely have more. I give it three stars because it was okay and a good option, but I was disgusted by what my neighbors were having. The smell made us want to throw up. I never want to go back to avoid smelling that food again. It was some sort of pepper situation.",,,
3,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",53,190,958,3.0,9/22/2018,"I had a good time at Cafeteria.My boyfriend and I went to Cafeteria for lunch and we were seated right away. The host was very friendly and welcoming. The food was okay; nothing really stood out. The chicken tasted microwaved, as it did not have that ""just fried"" CRUNCH. The wildberry mojito tasted like grape kool-aid; it was refreshing but tasted like it had no liquor. There was a bunch of flies... and when we were ready to go and wanted to ask for the bill, it took forever!",4,,
4,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",58,132,516,2.0,9/11/2018,"I detest when I'm hungry and your establishment is crap. No I'm starving.  I Ubered to what once many moons ago was where people came for food & service. Tonight L'Express was closed for maintenance. The Coffee Shop was just blatantly closed. So I recall the cafeteria is 24 hours. However, another Uber ride over and you are empty and service takes a piss!!!!!I entered and was seated at a table for one.  My water glass was filled. I waited, waited, waited, and waited no waiter. You're not busy so WTF!  I'm looking around still no waiter in sight. I get up from the table and find waiters in the back chit chatting. Again, WTF????  I place my order for the Mac attack and green eggs and ham. I go back to the table. There comes said person AJ or RJ if that's his name - waiter with my food to go- WTF!!!!!No wonder you are empty you completely suck. Then I left my Juul on the table.  The likelyhood of me seeing that again is none- as I can bet the same communication challenged waiter pocketed it.  You seriously need a revamp and better service. I wished L'Express was open so I could have saved myself. People save yourself and RUN!!!!!!!P.s. a round of applause to the friendly staff answering the phone for being kind and polite. They actually looked for my Juul when I phoned.  Too bad it could not be found.",3,2,
5,LaShonda H.,"Marietta, GA",226,394,1299,4.0,11/4/2018,"I really enjoyed the vibe here! This is where the chic young people eat from what I could tell. It is pretty small inside but that may be common in NYC? I was able to get a table immediately but opted for the bar. The bartenders were so cool and I ended up ordering a really good cocktail (Mucha Lucha- espolon tequila, schofferhofer grapefuit, lime, smoked lime rim, $13). For my meal I chose the turkey burger, no avocado, added pepper jack cheese and grilled onions with fries ($16). DEE-LICIOUS!!! That burger was hot out of the fire and so moist. I really enjoyed the music too, it was a bit loud so don't expect to have a deep convo here. The bathrooms were downstairs and a little odd to navigate but I'm so glad I came here. I now have a spot for next time I hit up NY!!",,,
6,Eboni C.,"Atlanta, GA",21,66,228,3.0,8/18/2018,"My partner and I came here on recommendation from a friend of ours. I took a look at it online and was surprised to see that it was a 24/7 restaurant that served comfort food. So one night we decided to try to it out! The restaurant is situated in Greenwich which was pretty close to us.The restaurant itself is very trendy. It was probably the only hipster 24/7 restaurant I've been to. The downside to the restaurant is that there is no real air conditioning. The restaurant leaves the front open so the air flow you receive is dependent on the current weather. This may be different if you go during the day, but I'm unsure. The staff were friendly but took a long time to ask us what we wanted and this continued throughout our stay. We had to ask for our water to be refilled several times. I ordered the bacon gouda mac and cheese. It was tasty but not the best macaroni I've ever had or even in the top 10. But it was good. $12My partner ordered the chicken and waffles. He was unimpressed but it was okay. The chicken was battered too thickly, the waffle was cheddar jalapeño but not advertised as such. The syrup was tasty and the hot sauce was too. Expensive but as to be expected in New York $22",3,,
7,Irwan A.,"South San Francisco, CA",38,125,80,4.0,9/6/2018,"Here is the 3-1-1: Food: For that late night or actually anytime craving this upmarket diner has a wide variety to meet what your needs. Though it was August, I had to try the Thursday special of roasted turkey over silky mash potatoes and topped with sauté green beans & resting on top of a cranberry gravy that should be bottled and served at every Thanksgiving dinner. The turkey breast was just a little over but if was tender this plate of goodness would be the best plate of Thanksgiving ever made. The veggie burger and sweet potato fries was a solid dish as well but does not hold up to the turkey so scheduling your dinner for a Thursday would be good thing.Service: Great service and super friendly staff but could have provided more details on each dish when they were served. Ambiance: Cool vibe and very clean décor, simple but with an upscale feel.",,,
8,Camille C.,"Wyckoff, NJ",267,89,181,3.0,11/13/2018,"A few years ago I used to go to this restaurant as my go to stop with my ex boyfriend for things like their hanger steak salad and chicken and waffles. I recently went back...  and I will never step foot in that restaurant again. I went on a Sunday for brunch with my friend. They sat us in the back of the restaurant, Right behind the door and next to the kitchen. It took a while for our server to come and take our orders... Even though we told them when we sat down we already knew What we wanted to eat, they made us wait. We ended up ordering chicken and waffles and it took them an hour and 30 minutes to give us our food. We almost walked out. They ended up taking one of our meals off the bill and added a free dessert for us. Although they compensated for their slow service we were sitting at a dirty table where flies were flying around. There was a couple that want to sit next to us and they ended up moving because the flies were getting in their food and it was really disgusting. I don't think I'll ever go back I will go back. Back in the day the Cafeteria was an awesome hip, chic and cool place",,,
9,Christina B.,"New York, NY",284,257,764,4.0,8/2/2018,"Cafeteria is a trendy American restaurant that serves food late. Conveniently located on 7th Ave, its an easy place to meet friends for a bite to eat. (You can make reservations on Resy ahead of time.) Some of the drinks are on the sweet end, so if you want something lighter go with The Simple Life (substitute the mezcal for a silver tequila to make it more refreshing) or the spicy margarita (if you can handle some fire). They have a trio of Mac & cheese for an appetizer but the truffle mac is the best one on the list, if you have a small party. Their Mac & cheese balls are also good. The entrees really range in terms of heaviness - the yellowfin tuna is light and basically like a tuna salad, which is my preference after a bunch of appetizers.",2,,
10,Christina E.,"New York, NY",1169,300,1949,3.0,9/14/2018,"I mean, this place is just okay. First came here 9 years ago when I moved to NYC with some girlfriends visiting from LA. Ordered the mac n cheese trio, jalapeno infused margarita (ooh that burned) and it didn't leave a lasting impression. Flash forward to almost a decade later, came to meet a girlfriend for brunch, ordered the sausage patty on a biscuit. The biscuit was really good but my homemade sausiche was so undercooked. Being about third trimester preggo, definitely couldn't risk getting sick, or worse, a deadly bacteria. The ambiance is cool and you will definitely see a lot of well-dressed millennials all ready for their selfies and instagrammable posts, but maybe I'm too old now and can't see the value in coming here when there are so many great brunch spots nearby.",48,25,41
11,Alan H.,"San Francisco, CA",65,367,708,3.0,9/15/2018,"Cafeteria has a great LA vibe. Open 24/7 this restaurant serves comfort food all day in modern digs. Sadly the hype stops there. There was a wait when I came with a friend at 2am. Unlike many restaurants that allow you to put your name in, at Cafeteria your told to wait in line on the side of the building. After 20 minutes we were let in to see half the restaurant empty. From there it only got worse. Service was slow, portions were small, and food was ok. For half the price I would recommend just going to a standard diner if your out late.",2,1,
12,Kristy A.,"Charlotte, NC",298,449,1333,4.0,7/3/2018,"Ate here late on a Saturday night with my honey and one of his good friends. There was some miscommunication, as our waiter hyped up the daily special lobster roll that my guy ordered only to return 20 minutes later and say it wasn't available. Nevertheless, my scallops were good. The beets were sliced and had a cabbage texture. I would substitute these next time. Everyone else was satisfied with their meal.",1,,1
13,RaSheba J.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,98,216,4.0,10/1/2018,"My friend said this was a popping place and her place to go to after the club. I have to say I agree. For now I have it a 4/5 because it wasn't spectacular and I do want to try other items off the menu and come back during he day time. I went at night and there is a doorman, which makes the service super fat and clear. We were seated a few minutes later. Apparently, the restaurant has three different menus, as my friend and I were looking for a particular item off the menu. I ordered the pancakes and the syrup reminded me of Cracker Barrel's syrup, it was so delicious. We also ordered truffle fries to share and it was pretty good.Beware when you go to the restroom it was a little gross but still okay to use the bathroom in. I am definitely returning to try other things on the menu.",,,
14,Carly L.,"New York, NY",171,239,229,5.0,9/4/2018,"I had a great lunch here! Everything was delicious! For drinks, we ordered the wildberry mojito and the passionfruit caipirinha. Both were sweet and fruity, and perfectly strong so that they were still tasty but had us feeling good. As for food, the crispy calamari salad was exactly what I wanted. I love calamari, and this was a great way to turn it into an entree. The sesame dressing was amazing, and they didn't drown the salad in it. The chicken and waffles was also incredible, and I loved the hot sauce that came on the side! Both the calamari and chicken were fried well and the breading was super crispy and flavorful. Everyone was also really pleasant there; the host greeted us with a huge smile, and our server was attentive and friendly. Our food also came out pretty quickly. I look forward to next time!",3,1,2
15,Elizabeth B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,131,178,4.0,9/13/2018,"We came here late at night and were immediately seated. The lighting was very romantic, a bit dark for the three of us, but nice nonetheless. Our server was great, really knowledgeable on the menu. We ordered the chicken, meatloaf, truffle fries, calamari salad, and tomato soup. The food was very rich and delicious! It came out in a timely manner and the food prices were reasonable. However, the reasons for 4 Stars is because of the incredibly loud music, omg it was really bad. We could barely hear ourselves think and to be honest, the other patrons were have issues too. We had to lean over the table or into the other persons ear to hear or say anything. For most of the dinner we sat in silence. The blaring music did not compliment the romantic mood lighting at all. Will we be back? Maybe...it was a great late spot to eat in Chelsea.",1,,
16,Alison R.,"North Haledon, NJ",34,81,167,5.0,5/23/2018,"Had a great experience at Cafeteria on a Sunday around brunch time :D Even though the place looked packed, we were able to be immediately seated as a party of 4. The coffee was very good. I love coffee that's nice and strong! I wanted something light and refreshing so I ordered the acai bowl, which definitely hit the spot. Nothing crazy special but met my expectations.My mom got the lemon ricotta pancakes which she said was delicious and my sister got the smoked salmon toast. Everyone enjoyed their meals!The service was good despite being so busy. I would definitely go back if I was in the area.",4,3,1
17,Mark S.,"Martinsburg, WV",12,80,50,2.0,10/7/2018,"This was an interesting lunch to say the least.  The food was good but the service...oh the service.  Service was slow to say the least and they told us they couldn't split the check but they could run different cards for payment.  We separated the bill by the food we ordered but that didn't quite work for the waiter.  He insisted that we divide the check up differently.  The food here is a little expensive.  I paid $16 for two small tacos.  Granted the tacos were good, but I'm not sure they were $16 good.  If you have time for slow service stop by for good food.  If not pass up on the Cafeteria.",3,,1

A Mac & Cheese Trio?! Ummm yes please. I'm also all over their frisee salad. Excellent cocktails, but remember it's NYC they don't serve alcohol until 12 on Sunday. It's always packed, so you will wait for a table. Awesome place",,,
19,Ruth U.,"New York, NY",33,175,227,4.0,10/29/2018,Super packed. Was seated as soon as they could get us a table. Strong drinks. Crispy fries (just how I like 'em). Filling veggie burger. Would for sure come again.,,,

We got a table downstairs which was nice because it wasn't as loud down there but definitely a darker area than the upstairs. We each ordered a cocktail from their menu, I got the berry mojito and it was fantastic!! Very sweet, but that's the way I like it! My friend got the mule, which I was also able to try, and it was delicious!For my entree I got the crispy calamari salad and it was delicious! It had crispy calamari over market greens, roasted red peppers, green beans, toasted peanuts, and a sesame vinaigrette. I definitely recommend this dish and it's enough to be a full meal on it's own. My friends also got the mac and cheese spring rolls, the mac and cheese trio and the steak and chicken tacos. I got to try some of their food and everything was great! My only concern was the portion of tacos was small for the price, you only get 2. Overall a great experience, if you're in the area definitely check this place out!",2,,
21,Katie H.,"Malverne, NY",7,12,23,4.0,10/28/2018,"The man and I past by this place a few years ago and decide to check it out. We went during lunch time and it became our favorite lunch spot in the city. Their mac & cheese spring rolls are to die for I get them every time I go. Amazing drinks never disappointed. The mussels are good as well, the only down side is they most of the time they are pretty busy and they don't always take reservations.",,,

23,Anthony F.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,2,4,4.0,8/5/2018,"I came to Cafeteria with my girlfriend for lunch. We sat outside because the weather was fairly nice. For drinks I originally ordered the passion fruit caipirinha and my girlfriend ordered the wild berry mojito. We ended up switching because we liked each other's drinks better. We had the sesame skirt steak and grilled Mahi Mahi street tacos for appetizers alongside the cornmeal calamari. The street tacos are good, but they disappear in two bites. The sesame skirt steak is very flavorful. The calamari is amazing. The sauces it came with was very good. We also ordered the Mac attack. It was cool, it's not the best Mac and cheese ever. The truffle oil Mac was better one out of the Three. For dessert we had the fried Oreos which was really good, but we hated the mint ice cream that it came with. I would recommend them trying a new ice cream with this dessert.",1,,

25,Starvel D.,"Lanham, MD",11,41,124,5.0,8/11/2018,"Since I love French toast, I had to try the crunchy croissant French toast. First the cronut, now this! It's a croissant, cut in half, and prepared like French toast with a cornflake crust, mascarpone cream, & warm berries. It really doesn't need syrup but I used it for the top half of the croissant; the bottom half was covered with berries. Most of the breakfast items are a la carte, so I added some eggs, bacon, & a cup of Nutella hot chocolate, as if I needed another reason to love Nutella. I'll be back.",,,
26,Lvan D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,9/23/2018,"The drinks, staff, and atmosphere are all wonderful!However, the food was alright. My husband and I had the chicken and waffles, mac attack, acai bowl, and steak and eggs.All were alright but I knew a few other places within a few blocks that had much better food.The mac attack seemed like they only added flavoring to the top of the mac and cheese instead of throughout. For example, the black truffle mac and cheese only had black truffle oil on the top portion that was exposed but after the initial bite, the rest were all normal mac and cheese. Very disappointed because I love mac and cheese, and do not eat it often.",2,,

However, the Cafeteria is nothing like an actual cafeteria. This restaurant is beautiful inside and outside, especially during the holidays. When we arrived at the restaurant it was covered in snow, and in white Christmas lights. It was kind of like love at first site. Wreaths hung on the walls and lit up the windows! There were also several Christmas trees. Even though the restaurant was filled with people it was still intimate and romantic. The Cafeteria is perfect for any date, even though I saw lots of big groups. We ordered: -Mac and Cheese Spring Rolls w/ Smoked Gouda Dipping Sauce. They tasted interesting but I still liked them.  -Deviled Eggs, pretty basic but good! -A side order of fried polenta (it was a special request to order separately). I love polenta! -Fried Oreos, always a good choice!-Red Velvet ding dongs with a milk shake. Surprisingly just ok. I wouldn't order it again. -Service was excellent, from the hostess, our server, but especially the manager. They let me modify the order and took special request. Hooray for letting me be difficult and then feeding me dessert! #boyfriendgoals This place is open 24/7 and has a nice bar and lounge for people that like to drink. I'm personally more into the food than the drinks so that's all I can tell you about the bar. As for the food, there are 3 different menus, all day, dinner, and overnight. I have my eye on their Croissant French Toast dish! It will be my job to conquer it the next time I come in!",104,77,99

Updated review","Hey hey my fellow Saturday/Sunday Adventures!!!Finally got the chance to stop by here, soooo glad I did! The atmosphere is high end diner and yes they're 24/7! Which in the city is amazing especially with the diner idea. However I will say service is either really good or it's terrible. Point in case ---we have 3 waiters, yes THREE. We originally were explained that we had one gentleman who only had a 10 minute break (after working a double shift into the the early hours) we completely understood considering we all worked in the hospitality industry. However once he went on a break we received a new waiter, one of which explained that breakfast started at 1 AM not midnight. Where as we were by one of our waiters told our group that dinner was switching over to breakfast at midnight....Flash foward to me borderline STARVING then finding out we have to wait another HOUR. NOPE.My best friend was actually much better with this and ordered the cripsy calamari salad prior to knowing this. Though trying to flag ANY waiter down was darn near impossible. Finally we did grab someone but it was irritating to just find someone to handle water----WATER. Several times we had to reach out to to request water WITH lemon. (never came). Otherwise the service was't really awesome, but the food wins over. We ordered two appetizers of mac and cheese spring rolls---delicious and filling. The $22 fried chicken and waffles can be equated to god like. ONLY because the sauces that accompanied it---fresh tobasco cause and sage infused syrup. The syrup is very similar to rosemary but with a hint of lemon. The calamari salad was very filling surprisingly, since it was a salad. Having peanuts with the fried calamari was actually pretty good.  Prices are very New York, but will def order a glass of wine next time. Thanks Cafeteria!",6,1,3
31,Baramee C.,"Chicago, IL",752,628,621,2.0,1/6/2018,"We were hunting for a place for brunch after our initial spot was crowded with a long line. It was just too cold and we were too hungry to wait around. This place was just further down the road and in the direction we were headed, so we stopped in. There were plenty of tables. It looked modern and trendy and had some decent reviews. We had a flight to catch later that day and some errands to run... because that it wasn't overwhelmed with other diners and it was a weekday, we felt we'd be able to get in and out with few hassles.The host was nice and seated us right away. It was the actual other service (mainly from our designated server) that wasn't so great. We knew fairly quickly what we wanted, but to actually get someone to take our order was a task in and of itself. He looked like he may have been fairly new, but people that were seated after us were get their orders taken before we did. It was like we were forgotten. Our water did get refilled, which was nice.As we were finishing up, we had to ask a passing server for our check because ours was no where to be seen and we were in a bit of a rush and had waited 10-15 minutes. As we were walking out, we saw another server just reading the paper and yet another that was on their phone. No one checked in on us when we'd gotten our food...just something we noticed.The food itself:Buttermilk Biscuit with Sausage and Egg - it was alright, but the salad on the side was there to make it look more like a fuller plate than it really was. It wasn't fantastic, but good at most and not really worth the costAvocado Toast Benedict - avocado toast topped with a poached egg and hollandaise with a small side salad. The avocado tasted like bland guacamole and you couldn't taste the pepper flakes. The poached eggs were overcooked and not running at all. The salad was dry...the toast burnt. The Hollandaise, itself, was pretty decent.TLDR: I honestly wouldn't go back and don't think it's really worth checking out.",6,2,3

The place is really modern with a clean design. The service was normal and food was good, but nothing extremely amazing. It is a good casual spot to come with friends but I wouldn't go out of my way.For 2 people, we ordered and shared:-Smoked Gouda and Bacon Mac and Cheese ($13) - if you love mac and cheese, this is the dish for you. It was baked to perfection, and super cheesy. For me, it was a little heavy and I don't think I would get this for my meal by itself-Short Rib or Steak Sandwich [sry i cant remember] ($17) - was also really great and everything inside the sandwich paired well together!-Truffle Parmesan Fires ($8) - Great and would recommend! Was crispy and fresh and loved the truffle flavor-Mint Ginger Lemonade - would pass. Not great tasting for the price :(",,,

We had a group of 5 and we were seated easily, but later when 2 friends tried to join (before we had even ordered) we were told there were no tables for groups more than 5. Unclear if this meant at that time or just generally. I ordered a build your own omelet with goat cheese and mushroom. It was...fine. Nothing to write home about. It came with cold, mediocre home fries and I think it was supposed to come with toast but I never got any. My husband also got an omelet he didn't love.One of my friends is gluten-free and the waiter was helpful in advising options for her. When the time came for dessert, he didn't have a good understanding of what was available or what was even on the menu. I was told there was no chocolate ice cream (although chocolate milkshake was on the menu) and instead picked mint chocolate chip that was truly awful. I want to give this place more stars because I appreciate that its open late and has a great vibe. I just wish the food was better than mediocre.",5,,

It was so unhealthy but sooo good at the same time. I wanted more!! Sadly, you don't get a lot of spring rolls, so my friend gladly shared her fries with me. Since this was for my birthday, my friend and I also split the white chocolate bread pudding. The server heard that it was my birthday and came over to sing me ""Happy Birthday"", it was very sweet! I liked it a lot!",,,
36,Millie R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,236,1227,5.0,1/3/2018,"Cafeteria never gets old. Every time, I come here it feels comfortable and fun. I secretly call it the place where the pretty humans hang out. You never know who you will run into here. It is always a lively and upbeat in atmosphere.  The food is always on point. Although, I always get the same things. I frequent for the Mac & cheese sampler or burgers. This time around I visited Just for dessert. I indulged in the bread pudding which is always so very good & it is topped with ice cream yes! It was a very cold night but I was in need of a nice cold chocolate shake because why not. The staff is very welcoming and accommodating. Service is fast. Although not an extremely big place it is spacious and has a lower level. During the summer it offers outdoor space. The crowd is fashionably trendy. So be fun and cool when you come here. The food is good & the prices are reasonable. Good place for kicking it with your friends or your significant love.",1,,
37,Erin A.,"Little Falls, NJ",162,70,133,2.0,11/11/2017,"Cafeteria I went in a group of 3 at around 4 pm. When we first got here it wa super busy they said the wait would be 10-15 minutes and to wait by the very busy bar. I ordered a drink and we waited while moving every 2 seconds while people passed by. Then they said it would be another 10 minutes even though 30 minutes had already passed. I wasn't that hungry so I was willing to wait, same with everyone in my group. But we finally got a seat but down side it was by the door so it was cold and I had to keep my jacket on the whole time ! I got the Street tacos lentil falafel $13 They were tiny. Not filling at all. Spicy not bad. And the Mac and cheese spring rolls $12 I like the extreme carbs idea, they were good. But I thought dipping it into more cheese was odd. My dad got the salmon $22 He had no complaints. My sister got the classic burger $16 They first brought out chicken and waffles Instead of the burger. Then they brought a burger but it wasn't with onion rings. So she told them. And then they brought out another again without onion rings but she just took it this time. I got the sparkling negroni $12It was a bit bitter but, still enjoyable. We didn't have 1 single waiter. One person took our order. Another gave us the food. And another  gave us the check. We told the one that gave us the food that we wanted the red velvet. He said okay sure. So by the time we were done it would be ready. But when I asked about it later they said they didn't know about it. And it wasn't ordered. That it would take a while to be ready. But we were in a hurry so we were like never mind. They were like sorry. So basically we paid about 90 dollars to be freezing by the door, to have our orders all switched up and not get dessert. So perhaps there's better places in NYC to eat!",6,,2
38,Donald B.,"New York, NY",9,70,0,2.0,9/9/2018,Stopped for lunch with my best friend.I went on recommendation from a friend this past weekend.   There seemed to be a definite problem with the service - slow and less then attentive.    The food was fair but it seemed like a lost cause to complain in any form.   Our waiter was not overly enthusiastic and our service was so slow already that adding any complaint might not have been in our favor.,1,,
39,Mala L.,"Long Island, NY",510,313,1261,3.0,11/14/2017,"Hmm solid 3 stars. I think this place is an average trendy NY restaurant. It's really very nice in there and was impressively filled on a Monday at 4pm.I was told by a couple of people that the mac and cheese here is outstanding. SO I went ahead and ordered the Mac Attack - it was basically a flight of mac and cheese (regular, truffle oil, and bacon/gouda mac). The regular mac was the best by far. It was traditional and creamy. The truffle mac smelled amazing but flavor-wise was underwhelming and oily. The bacon mac and cheese was tasteless and even more oily. Honestly, I was really confused over the hype. So many better mac and cheese options in the city?! (cough cough Sweet Chick). Furthermore, prices are astronomical (*sigh* as expected). And I know, NYC prices, blah blah blah but if you're already going to pay a premium to eat here, at least eat something that will blow your taste buds away.In the future, I'm not going to be the one to suggest Cafeteria. But if I did find myself here again I would happily try something else because the other menu items do look good. Or I'd get the regular mac and cheese again.",2,1,
40,Eric W.,"Manhattan, NY",47,140,681,4.0,6/16/2018,"Really great food. Not so great service. Whenever we needed anything it took a while to get our waiter's attention. I ended up having to ask another waiter to try to get the coffee we ordered at the beginning of our meal that still hadn't come by the time the appetizers arrived. The appetizers and entrees also weren't scattered and the order was mixed up. The food, on the other hand, was great. The meatballs were fantastic, as was the bread they came with. The quinoa bowl with salmon was mediocre. We've had it previously and it was much better the first time. The smoked salmon toast was superb and the locks were delicious. We've previously had the salmon Benedict and that was also great, but we didn't see it on the menu. The lemon ricotta pancakes were alright. The other person liked them, but I wasn't a huge fan. Pretty solid food. Pretty lousy service.",,,

It's 10:00 at night and the restuarant is pretty slow, my boyfriend and I walk in after work because I'm craving the good food that is served here. Sat for 20 minutes and was never approached even though we did our best to make eye contact with the staff, even waving someone down. No water, nothing. We finally flag down a busser and he says ""server will be right over"" 5 more minutes go by, and it's as if all staff members were trying to pretend like we weren't there. Truly bizarre. I am so disappointed because I liked the food there and will NEVER go back. Go anywhere else, at least somewhere they will acknowledge you! You guys should be embarrassed.",1,,
42,Kevin D.,"New York, NY",7,11,11,3.0,8/29/2018,"When the restaurant we planned to visit with our dog ran out of patio room, a passerby recommended Cafeteria. We were excited to grab a table, particularly when we saw how abuzz the place was.The place is cool enough, and the menu has some excellent items which were clearly conceived with thought and expertise. The service put kind of a bad taste in our mouth, though. Across the board, we felt like questions were a nuisance, answers were hard to find, and that the basic flow of a meal wasn't considered. (That feeling doesn't apply to the bus staff, who worked hard to keep things amazingly clean!)The food, too, was 3-stars for us. The menu of elevated classics was fun, but the food wasn't particularly compelling in terms of flavor. The plates were somewhat sloppy in composition (e.g. handfuls of fried dough with no meat in our calamari), albeit well-cooked.All in all, it felt more like a ""scene"" than a quality restaurant. I don't see myself returning, or recommending the place, and the price paid per dish didn't deliver a quality meal of the same value.",1,,

I went here with a friend and we ordered the calamari and the Mac and cheese spring rolls to start. We were also given complimentary cheese biscuits with honey butter. I was disappointed with the mac and cheese spring rolls. There was absolutely no depth or complexity  to the Mac and cheese, no Interesting cheese used; it tasted like kraft Mac and cheese deep fried. It was my least favorite out of everything.The calamari,as they usually are, was extremely greasy. It came with capers, jalapeños and a dipping sauce- everything but the sauce was deep fried even in the capers.The main meal which was chicken and waffles was the star of the night. The chicken was very moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside, beautifully seasoned and huge. It looked like a half chicken on the plate. You could taste the cinnamon in the waffles which were thick and restaurant quality. It came with 2 sauces:the hot sauce which had too much vinegar but I still went dipping I to it because the spice was needed.The maple syrup which was incredible.I will definitely be back only for the chicken and waffles.",,,

Our waiter was very attentive and checked in often even though my friend and I took a while to order -- too busy chitchattin!  Our cocktail of choice was the berry mojito, which was made just right to my liking. I ordered the Grilled N.Y. Sirloin with sweet potato fries and my friend had the Pork Chop with parmesan fries. Both dishes were tasty, though I will admit I've had better sweet potato fries. We then topped it off with selecting the carrot cake for dessert. The icing was way too sweet, but cake was on point! Thanks Cafeteria!

I told the server there were multiple large cockroaches near my table -- he did nothing and said nothing. I understand the city is dirty but c'mon. All the tables around me were equally appalled. The bathrooms were DISGUSTING. Grey Goose martini was made wrong. My friend ordered Cabernet and a white wine was bought out. It took 30 mins for apps to come. Almost an hour for the rest of our mains. I ordered the hanger steak medium rare and it came out well done...who orders a steak well done??? Very confused with all the mistakes.After a few minutes at this restaurant, I realized this might not be a quality dining atmosphere -- much more of a quick cocktail place. The decor is ageing. The chairs look like hospital shower chairs. The staff and host looked miserable. They are either treated like shit or are all having a bad day. So much attitude from our server that I didn't correct any of the mistakes -- martini, steak, etc. I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. Worst place to dine in NYC.",4,1,

50,Jade B.,"Brooklyn, NY",251,147,460,3.0,9/12/2017,"After a long weekend in Boston I was craving some Mac & Cheese. I headed straight here from Penn Station to get my fix. Now this was my first time here, attempts at night made it impossible to enter (also I was too hungry to wait on a line) so it was perfect to stop in during the mid day.I'm not sure if there was a game or Concert going on at MSG but when I sat down I felt like everyone eating was either coming from or going to a club. The bacon Mac & Cheese hit the spot. A crispy golden outer crust where you crack into and find a creamy/cheesy warm center. Although the Mac & cheese was good, I would venture somewhere else in the area at night for food. The security guard and long line feels over the top for some Mac & cheese.",4,1,1

Very fruity and the flavors burst in your mouth. The California Cobb salad was equally delicious and the combo made me a very happy lady. I love Cafeteria. The food is always great and the staff is extremely friendly. It's a very trendy restaurant that's open 24 hrs, and it gets very busy on the weekends. Do yourself a favor and go for breakfast. The pancakes with Chantilly cream are soooo good as well as the French toast. They serve chicken and waffles all day and the chicken is moist and so flavorful. I am never disappointed when I eat at this establishment.",,,
52,Thurz D.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,46,22,5.0,6/11/2018,"We ordered the mac and cheese egg rolls as an appetizer it was good super cheesy!!! I love the dipping sauce. My bro had a chicken sandwich that the toppings were generous and the bread supported the meat. But the best thing waa the fries by far. I got the chicken and waffles because who doesn't order chicken and waffles when they see it on the menu. They were a spicy Cajun waffle with chicken and hot sauce on the side. The chicken was super bland it came out looking like it was amazing and don't get me one it was crunchy but it had no flavor whatsoever. I actually end up sending it back. The manager came out and apologized for the dish she said that the chicken and waffles never tasted so bland before and she's going to speak to the kitchen. She invited me to come back for breakfast on her----------------------Update:So I went back for the chicken and waffles and ordered it just like the chef prepared it. With the cheddar tabasco waffle. The succulent chicken came out hot with a crunch golden coating. The waffle was the percect counterpart to the huge piece of chicken. The hot sauce and pure maple syrup added a savory sweet component to the dish. My only ""problem"" was that the chicken was too big. But who complains about that. What i really love about this establishment is that the manager really took responsibility for my experience. That is the difference between 4 and 5 stars... n yall know i rarely give out 5 stars b/c i leave room for improvement. Cafeteria definitely improved since my last visit.",,,
53,Claudia D.,"Kansas City, MO",0,4,0,1.0,7/11/2018,"I'm visiting Jersey for the first time so this was my first time at this place. Only came because a friend brought me here. Our server ruined the entire experience so I honestly can't even rate anything else other than him. Daniel C was our server and I had to get his name from the receipt. I don't know if he is always like he was today or if he was having a bad day or what. But I've never had such an unpleasant server. Not friendly, extremely nonchalant, seemed like it was a bother to serve us. Didn't smile even once. He literally didn't say anything outside of us asking him questions. Didn't say thank you when dropped off our check or anything. I asked for a straw and he just walked away, so when he came back and I saw he didn't have a straw I said ""I just wanted to know if you heard me ask for a straw since you didn't respond?"" He said ""yes."" Me and my friend were so confused as to why he would be a server with that demeanor and attitude. We kept looking at each other like we missed something. I've been a server on and off for over 10 years and there is just basic serving skills you HAVE TO HAVE EVEN IF YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY. Like basic manners! My friend was on his lunch break and everything took forever. Waited about 15 min before he greets us. Took 30 plus min for just salads to come out. If we had the time , would have asked to a different server.",7,2,

Came here for brunch with a friend near 1pm and lucky us to be seated at the last available table. The servers are quick and prompt. We got the Mac n cheese trio and pancakes. Each Mac n cheese had their own flavor and were all delicious; worth the $16 considering it was pretty filling and we were unable to finish. The pancakes were cute and yummy. There were about 10 pieces of pancakes, which came with whipped cream, fruits, and syrup. I hate soggy pancakes, but they made it to perfect level of crisp. Cafeteria is a nice place to catch up with friends or just to have a casual brunch. Although it's usually busy here, people are pretty quick to eat and leave. Great service and delicious food!",,,

This time around I didn't want to get a full meal, I wind up getting just some small plates with snacks. My bestfriend, and I ordered the mussels, deviled eggs, skirt steak tacos, and the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese is by far my fave. Smoked Gouda cheese and bacon ! Yummy!!!

I had the Roast Chicken ($20) and their version of an Old Fashioned (I don't recall the exact name - $14). The drink was really good, as was the chicken. The presentation is really nice and it definitely looks like a fancier restaurant than it is. That being said, I probably won't come for dinner again simply because the price tag is really high for their entrees. I'd probably come back for some appetizers or desserts though (like the deep fried Oreos with mint chip ice cream WHAT).

This time around, I got the tomato basil soup, which was rich and heavy, in a stick-to-your-ribs way. It had a tiny grilled cheese in the middle, which tasted mainly of bread and not much cheese. There was also a swirl of creme fraiche and what I assume to be basil and oil which added depth. And then I got herb French fries, which I recommend dipping in the soup. The fries are crispy shoestring and come in a generous quantity. My boyfriend had a hamburger with blue cheese and jalapeño (whew!) and said it was pretty good. And though I didn't get them this time, I can vouch for the mac and cheese spring rolls. Also, the place is wheelchair accessible.",,,

I was excited to try the place out because some friends in the city have recommended it to me before; I ended up ordering their aloe lemonade and the smoked salmon benedict, which is served over potato cakes and comes with a side salad.The aloe lemonade was very sweet but good and refreshing! The smoked salmon and poached egg on the benedict were tasty, but I was really disappointed by the potato pancakes - they were pretty soggy and bland, and the hollandaise sauce was mostly just tart and lukewarm.I tried my friend's prosciutto eggs and they were pretty good, though, so I may have just ordered the wrong thing!

I enjoy coming here as an adult as much as I did when coming here in high school - its a little bit bougie, a little extra and always delicious (just like me?) I'll stop now.Jokes aside, Cafeteria consistently provides delicious food and service at all hours in a stylish space. I've come here for lunch, brunch, after work drinks, dinner, and 3am pancakes because I'm a savage but that's neither here nor there. Its the perfect place to meet a friend for brunch or bring your friends/family from out of town who want a slightly over the top experience. Its elevated diner food, what's not to like? Yes, there is a wait on the weekend because they don't take reservations and its bit of a scene. Just calm down and have a drink at the bar or stand on the corner and watch the parade of fashionable people that tend to be strolling down 7th Ave. If you're a party of 2 and not afraid of sun, grab a seat outside and get a front row seat to the show. My go to's here have and always will be the Cafeteria Cosmo with the Calamari Salad. I swear by it because its healthy but also not at all, and there are peanuts in it so I'm miraculously full for the rest of the day afterwards. Its a salad of dreams and I will go out of my way to get my hands on it. The caesar, mac and cheese trio, the burger, pancakes (basically the entire menu) are also worth looking into.If you want a no-frills meal with absolutely no wait or pretentiousness, there is a diner down the street, but I urge you to give Cafeteria a go.",1,2,

Instead of checking up on us the waiter would walk past our table and we'd have to stop him to ask for something.  We ordered the waffle and while I cut the waffle and scooped some cream a whole long hair came out of it. The waiter instead of being polite about it said there weren't any female chefs in the kitchen and basically accused us of stuffing a piece of hair in the cream? He took it and brought us a new waffle eventually but he really didn't have to accuse us for it. Two stars for the horrible service but I honestly love cafeteria food and vibe.

This place has one in its menu, in which the reviews proclaimed it's tastiness! So I had to come try.The toast itself was not bad. It was saltier, oilier, and soggier than I would like. I think they used salted butter to make the toast which wasn't what I was looking for. It wasn't crunchy or served hot.The reason for low stars is the service is slow and and not-so-great overall. It took us two trips to finally try it. The first, we waited over 45 minutes for our order, which didn't show up so we left. We asked the waitress what was going on, she left, came back, told us kitchen was backed up and it would be out in 5 minutes. We stuck around for another 20 minutes with her walking by us many times with no status check or anything. Didn't offer to refill our coffees or anything... and since we were starving we had to go.

We had a reservation but it took half an hour to seat us which is unacceptable. What's the point of making one then? My water glass came with a lipstick stain which was quite displeasing. Naturally the décor is minimalisticly stylish. Before noon on a weekday, the place is jammed for lunch. There are lots of very good all-day choices. Mac n' Cheese spring rolls are killer with a funky cheese (doubling down) dip. A couple of us had burgers which I think should be reserved for when nothing else on the menu sounds any good. The restrooms had a problem...no toilet paper. Service was problematic since we saw our waiter once so he was inattentive at best. Won't be coming back but I guess experience was okay.",,,

Located in Chelsea it is a New York must have while in the city. They are open 24/7 which is super convenient! Good quality food for a reasonable price as well. The chicken and waffles is by far amazing. I usually get it with a plain waffle and not the cheddar one that is offered. The smoked bacon and Gouda Mac and cheese is phenomenal as well. By far some of the best Mac and cheese I've had at a restaurant!!!,3,,

I'm not talking the kind of sweats that look like you just came from the gym all dirty and gross either. That friend, in particular, happens to be a resident DJ at 40/40 Club here in NYC. Anyway, the way the ""bouncer"" at this restaurant treated us was totally uncalled for especially over a pair of sweatpants. Not only that the place was EMPTY!!!!

I feel as though the portions were perfect. The server was very attentive and constantly came over to make sure we were doing well and had drinks.

We replied ""yes it was good"" he then says ""well on a 200.00 bill I should be tipped more like 36.00-40.00, this is how I pay my rent"" we immediately became offended and OUTRAGED.

Waitstaff was super friendly and attentive, which I realize may be a totally different experience from some of the mediocre rating reviews. Both ordered the chicken and waffles (obviously) and it came out lightning fast (like damn were these for us??) and hot. Absolutely delicious! Loved the savory cheddar waffle and somebody back in the kitchen really knows how to a) beautifully season some fried chicken and b) not overcook it so that's its nice and juicy.

It's clean and trendy.  We ordered the pancakes and the vegetarian omelette (it was a build your omelette and it had wild mushrooms, caramelized onions and avocado).  The omelette was excellent with the fried potatoes. The pancakes: not your traditional pancakes as they were 9 small round pancakes in a circle as opposed to what we are all used to which is a stack of 3 or 4 on top of each other.  The pancakes were buttermilk and were light and fluffy. It came with a side of fruit.

102,Morgan G.,"Manhattan, NY",606,244,720,5.0,4/4/2017,"My only question is: Why the heck did it take me so long to try Cafeteria?Though I've been told countless times to check this place out, only this Sunday did I finally make my way over there and actually do it. Cafeteria is a 24-hour modern diner of sorts, but I personally wanted to check it out for brunch. On a beautiful spring day (hopefully the first of many!), my friend and I were seated outside immediately with her dog under a heating lamp and the service was exceptional: friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. Though we came in knowing that we needed to try the mac and cheese spring rolls, we were overwhelmed by all of the incredible brunch offerings (think butternut squash toast, truffle eggs, make your own omelette, etc.) Eventually we both decided on the truffle eggs with smoked salmon and we split the mac and cheese spring rolls as an appetizer. The mac and cheese spring rolls came out less than 5 minutes after we ordered them and they were crispy and creamy with a gooey gouda dipping sauce. Surprisingly the spring rolls actually stayed together pretty well, and every bite was like an explosion of cheesy heaven in my mouth. By the time the truffle eggs came, I was already hitting my fullness capacity, but that didn't stop me from devouring a hefty plate of truffle eggs with parmesan over a piece of bread and smoked salmon. By the end of my meal, I was in foodie heaven with enough Instagram pics to last a lifetime.For a restaurant that's so trendy, the prices here are SO reasonable. Though we didn't wait at all at 11 on a Sunday, I did see some people waiting for an indoor table, so be prepared for what could possibly be a slight wait. I promise, though, it's worth it.",5,1,

I believe I had a Cuban sandwich and all I can say is I've tried and I won't try it again. It wasn't what I expected for the sandwich. Wasn't warm and lacked flavor.

Today I was half day at work and had to go back home and relax. The most surprising thing is the general manager who hang up on me after I called her and explained the situation. She refused to help, told me that it's not the kitchen and said she's waiting to get the check from her office (8 hours and still no check).

Updated review","First visit to Cafeteria was at 4:30 am after the club. I was hungry but unsure of what I wanted. I happen to open the menu backwards and see the dessert page first. I paused and rubbed my eyes because I felt as if they were playing tricks on me. Could it be? My favorite two desserts on the menu together? Fried Oreos and Mint chocolate chip ice cream. Even my friends said that the dessert had me written all over it. Although I won't start I petition to change the menu item name to ""The Sam"" I will say I enjoyed it thoroughly!!! And that Gouda and bacon Mac and cheese will make you tongue to back flips!!! I'll be back for sure!!!",,,
107,Kia A.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",1,203,1044,4.0,4/2/2018,"This place is well known and thus survives more so off of that than amazing good or stellar service. Don't come here starving because the typical wait is about 30 minutes be it you come for brunch, late lunch or evening hours. When it's nice outside they have seats outside which can help you get a table faster which is key if it's brunch time. I've been here a number of times as it is easy to get to and the menu is consistent. I would deem it more so an upscale diner than anything else. The food also follows suit in being diner food versus anything super gourmet. The service and the experience you have  really depends on who you encounter. I've had the hostess/host who is a complete douche then followed by a really excellent waiter or vice versa. Cafeteria tends to have  a very high opinion of itself when it's the norm to typically have people work there that are so douchey. The prices are not cheap but it's not expensive. I know very vague...Food: I've had the waffles, eggs, burger, red velvet shake, red velvet hohos, and fries- all good but nothing to lose my mind over. I'd say go if you're in the area but if the wait is too long here don't be too depressed! Go hit up a diner or any other restaurant in the area and you won't be missing much.",3,,
108,Conrad G.,"New York, NY",17,13,12,4.0,2/2/2018,"I have only good things to say about Cafeteria, except that it is just not quite good enough to warrant a five star review, just because you got to leave some room to rate those truly special places that just belong into this next level category that Cafeteria isn't quite part of - I hope you understand what I mean.Anyway, two main perks about this place are truly worth pointing out. First of all, this place is open 24/7 and next to Halal guys it's possibly your best bet at getting a good meal at 5AM with the extra benefit of seating that is not in some scruffy diner, Dunkin' Donuts or McDonald's where the homeless and mentally ill congregate at night (no offense intended, just facts).I have had various drinks and desserts here over the last few visits at this spot and I will vouch for their cakes and cannoli any day, but I'm sure there are plenty of options I'm just not able to recommend because I've never been curious enough to give them a try.Technically you can bring a date here even after the club, but it's also a cute spot during day time, especially if you get outdoor seating on a hot summer day.",,,

We also ordered an appetizer consisting of three different macaroni and cheese called the Mac attach. Appetizer Mac Attach was DELICOUS creamy and yummy with a crusty cheese topping.  Each one was DELICOUS.  The chicken and waffles was also very good.  Chicken was juicy and crispy at the same time.  Waffles were moist and wonderful. The tomatoe basil soup was fantastic but the only problem we had was with the grilled cheese sandwich.  It was hard as a brick. We showed it to our waitress and without a problem it was replaced with a fresh grilled cheese sandwich which was excellent. Manager was nice enough to not charge us for the grilled cheese sandwich.  I would have given them five stars but the wait to get our food was horrible and the first grilled cheese sandwich we got should have never been served hard as a rock.

As an individual that worked in hospitality industry for a solid decade I can for sure tell that there's been lack of service, I did not let it get to me so I was expecting the food be much better. I wanted to get Mac and Cheese and was told by our server that they are out of it. In the next 30-45 minutes there was another couple sitting next to us that ordered Mac and cheese and they received it. What the hell? Me and my partner had few drinks to begin with and followed by a bottle of wine. Drinks were ok. We've ordered SHORT RIBS that to my taste were a bit dry.The dessert was ok. We've ordered the Citrus something forgot the name ($10) and it was just a scoop of sorbet on a bed of orange and grapefruit doles about 4 of each. Really? The bread pudding was stale and hard to chew. The service charge was included on a party of 2 and the waiter did not verbalize it to the costumers which is my biggest peeve in service. If he would have told us I'd leave even more on top but just for not mentioning it really threw me off.

We ordered the mac attack it's  a trio of their signature mac & cheeses. All three were really good & the price of $16 was ok. The mac & cheese was creamy and flavorful. My steak tacos were good just too small. I also had a berry mojito that was really good as well. My co-workers and I got there at about 3:30 & it wasn't crowded. The guy who waited on us was nice.  He gave suggestions as to what to order but I think the shift waa changing because he never came to check on us and brought us the check without asking if we wanted another drink or dessert. Then the next girl who took over kept coming over asking to take the check even though we were sitting and talking. We kinda felt like they were kicking us out.

I simply ordered chicken & waffles, the waiter then told me we wont be serving this meal tonight. I proceeded to order some salmon which is always a good substitute for me. The issues came in when i noticed another customer who walked in at least 45 mins after me, she actually had chicken & waffles on her table. Soon after my friend approached the manager to discuss how could she have ordered something i was told wouldnt be served. This managers response was really aggressive & rude as if he wanted to fight (he knew better though) all in all i will not be visiting this restaurant anymore!",4,,1
116,Anna C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",106,107,585,3.0,4/5/2017,"Came here around 4pm on a Saturday. Waited about 15 minutes at the bar for a table. Pros: - It was almost dinner time and they still served brunch! - The Mac attack was delicious!! All three were very rich in flavor, and it really hit the spot in terms of absolute comfort food. - Fried Oreo's! (First time trying fried Oreos and I'm so glad I did! It comes standard with mint ice cream, but we swapped it out for vanilla since I'm not the biggest fan of mint ice cream) Cons: - Although the restaurant itself has a pretty trendy vibe, the service was not particularly amazing to match. - Burger was definitely very basic for the price - Felt a bit rushed to leave after the food was finished.",1,,1
117,Megan P.,"Dallas, TX",345,44,61,3.0,11/18/2017,"I went here for breakfast with friends before my flight back home! Breakfast was amazing and the employees were kind. I ordered an omelette with sautéed mushrooms and onions. It was delectable and packed with flavor. It also comes with a side of potatoes and your choice of toast or a biscuit. I also ordered the waffle because I love variety. That was delicious as well. It was crispy and topped with fruit and whip. It wasn't too sweet, which I loved because I don't like to eat too many sweets in the morning. My friends ordered green eggs (eggs with avocado pesto) and ham and avocado toast Benedict. They also enjoyed their dishes. Although breakfast was good, we had some trouble with our bill. We asked the waitress if we can have separate checks. She mentioned that she can't separate checks but we can write our name next to our item on the receipt, which we were fine with. We get our check, write down who is paying for what, and give the waitress our credit cards. She comes back a few minutes later and says ""It's $5 short"" and holds our our cards and the receipt. We were confused. Are our credit cards $5 short or the bill? We really did not know what she was trying to convey. She then clarified ""I divided up the bill the way it was written down but when I did the math, it doesn't add up and it's $5 short."" My friend asked ""Is it $5 short because of tax?"" We looked at the receipt and it was ~$5 in tax and the waitress said no. She said she couldn't figure out why it was short (I'm pretty sure the miscalculation was due to tax because we saw her math and it looks like she only added a few cents or $1 to each dish). We had a flight to catch so we couldn't go back and forth any longer/try to figure out this situation so my friend said to put the missing charge ($5) on her card on top of her own bill. The waitress misunderstood and put the entire bill on my friend's card. We ended up working the charges amongst ourselves after the trip, but it was definitely a headache trying to work out the bill with the waitress. It's 2017, why can't we just have separate checks?!",,,
118,Katherine E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",99,6,1,1.0,10/29/2018,HORRIBLE. The service was slow. I refused to use the silverware given out of preference and was given attitude and told that i wasnt allowed to use plastic silverware.... WHICH THEY HAD NO REASON AS TO WHY. Waited a total of 30 minutes just to be told that l had to use their silverware and that they pretty much didnt care. Manager tried to accommodate after the fact. Probably wont ever come back.,,,
119,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,2.0,2/21/2017,"Extremely disappointing!I had this place bookmarked for over two years, and I picked here to come out with my former colleague. I'll start out with the positives because they were few and far between. The staff greeted me and I was seated immediately. The waitress came to check on the table several times, but we hadn't chosen our wines yet. I appreciated her patience and her efforts; we ultimately chose for the Malbec, which came out quickly. The establishment has a very nice decor and staff was friendly, but now onto the bad.After initially being very patient with us, she then became difficult to locate. I had to waive my hand and flag her down, I felt like I was back in grade school. The food itself was awful: I had the mac attack sampler ($16) and the mac was average, at best. Along with that the truffle fries, which were in the same category. My friend went with the calamari salad, which was enjoyable. When the food was brought out, it was slammed down, and while he apologized it was uncalled for. Also, the table still had the bread basket and small plates and they never were removed, it's typically always removed before the entrees come out, but finally I had to ask them remove it because I absolutely no space. The atmosphere was very loud and was hard to have a conversation. All and all, I'm glad I was able to finally visit, but I don't ever see myself returning here.",6,1,2
120,Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",600,1428,20,3.0,3/10/2018,"You're mostly paying for the atmosphere. It's dark, candlelit and romantic. The food is...basic. Even as far as American restaurants go.

123,Danny V.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",946,131,34,4.0,3/30/2017,"Great late night spot.Had the Macaroon Triplet or whatever it's called. It had a worse name, maybe it was Mac Attack. Anyway, it was three M&Cs in bowls, not a heaping serving but a decent one. The gouda mac is fire. Don't make the mistake of getting the Mac Attack. Instead go all in on gouda, and split another entree with someone else. The truffle mac I found lacking. It was a bit on the runny side. The normal mac also was a bit runny. Did I mentioned I liked the gouda mac? It was fire. Good lord. Dessert was the red velvet yodels (like a red velvet cake dipped in chocolate, much like a dipped cone). The cake didn't blow me away, but it was very good and paired beautifully with the included vanilla milkshake. Service was great. Ambiance is really cool. The bathroom is memorable. I'd come here in a pinch, I'd come here if it was all that was open- and I'd be happy to do it. This place is decently innovative and pretty good. Not quite a destination, but rock solid. For 24/7 places, the only thing I know that's better is Coppelia, and since I've been there 9 million times, this will probably be the place I eat food at 4AM at next.",1,,

Five stars, not only for the quality of food, atmosphere, and crop of attractive and kind staff (and patrons), but also for maintaining a sense of calm, cool, and collective control in the event that a completely unforeseen calamity occurs. I say this because while thoroughly in the midst of deconstructing my gorgeous and equally delectable carrot cake tower of dessert (post dope meal and craft cocktail), I witness the most uncalled for night fight. Long story short, I'll say that Guy and the team of people working late that night handled that ish fit with care and grace, all the while assuaging ones hunger, thirst, and ensuring our physical well being.

Food: 5/5Seriously, everything was superb! Orders came out quickly and we devoured everything!Old School Meatballs- soooo good! Juicy and flavorful, used the bread to sop up all the marinara sauce!Calamari- well seasoned and came with some cherry peppers/capers which brightened the dish.Truffle Parm Fries- so much cheese on top and you could definitely taste the truffles.Prince Edward Mussels- probably the best mussel app I've had in a while; delicious wine sauce and plump mussels!""Mac Attack""- the 3 different Mac and cheeses.Cheddar and fontina, smoked Gouda and bacon, and truffle oil... can't pick a favorite! Maybe the Gouda and bacon...Branzino- fish was flaky and light, the sauce was savory and really loved that bed of spinach.Fettucini with Shrimp- perfectly cooked pasta with delicious rock shrimp.

However, the cleanliness and attitudes of their staff made me lose my appetite and never want to return again. I was so shocked to notice a mouse run by another table. I have heard stories but never actually witnessed anything like that in my 6 years living in Manhattan. The staff only seemed to have an attitude when they were notified. THEY DID NOTHING! It was like they were pretending it didn't happen. I ran to the bathroom before leaving and that too was a disgusting mess. There was no toilet paper on the roll but instead it was bundled in a soggy mess in the corner. I couldn't stay in there longer than a few seconds with the stench. I was so disgusted.",,,

We were trying to find a dinner place with good drinks near Penn station because the night was so cold. After flagging down a cab on 7th ave I decided to take a chance on Cafeteria.Upon arriving, I was shocked to see just how small the place was. It's intimate, definitely a hip crowd. Super trendy.For the food I chose the caesar salad, truffle fries and Mac&Cheese for my dinner. My friend had the chicken and waffles. The food was fairly priced for the area, the fries were great; however the salad and Mac&Cheese weren't my favorites. The waffle from the chicken and waffles was awesome, my friend raved about the chicken. The drinks were fantastic! We had three rounds and zero regrets!

135,Gabriela H.,"Manhattan, NY",247,25,99,3.0,11/21/2017,"Cafeteria is a really cool spot in the heart of Chelsea. I heard about it from a few friends and knew that the mac and cheese was a must. I stopped by on a Thursday on a cool night that was still warm enough to sit outside. The outdoor seating area looks like a couple of tables on the sidewalk but it worked for us. The restaurant has large garage doors in the front and the interior is beautiful. The decor is definitely more elevated than the menu. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to know that Cafeteria is open 24 hours a day. We were seated immediately and ordered some cocktails. I had some type of jalapeno margarita that I really loved. The drinks came in small glasses priced around $14 each which I guess is pretty typical NYC. We weren't starving so we ordered the mac attack - a trio of mac & cheese (regular, bacon and truffle) and a side of sweet potato fries that came with chipotle aioli. The food itself was pretty decent. It was definitely not the best mac and cheese I've ever had but it got the job done. Its hard to mess up anything with bacon and carbs. It was a little flavorless and didn't have that hot, gooey cheese sauce that I crave when ordering mac & cheese. Overall, it's not my first pick for dinner in Chelsea but I would give it another shot.",,,

138,Ny's Finest ..,"Bayside, NY",2,80,11,1.0,1/27/2018,"Had such a horrible experience here with my party of 4. We were seated after an hour wait, only not to have a waiter (yes, no damn waiter) we sat, sat some more, and sat even more and no one ever came to take our order. After about 20 minutes I stopped one of the dozen or so waiters to ask if anyone was covering our table, to which he replied ""I will find out who is cover this table"". After about a 5 minute investigation, he came back and said he didn't know where our waiter was but that he felt bad and will get us started on our drinks, and hopefully by the time we were ready to order he would find out what was going on. Needless to say, the nice guy got us our drinks, which we appreciated, but no one ever came back to take out order. After about another 30 min or so, he passed and saw no one had ever came to our table other then himself. He stopped once again and told us he was working another area but would be back shortly to take out order because he felt bad, and that's what he did. Once that was done we received our meals, after about an hour wait time from the time we sat down. By this time our drinks were done, and we needed another round but guess what? Still NO DAMN WAITER!!!!! I asked to speak to a manager, to explain our situation which was a total waste of time. He seemed more concerned about his outfit then he did about his customers. He told us he would get us a permanent waiter, but never did. Nor did this individual even apologize for our unexceptable inconvenience! Then to make matters worse, this same individual who claimed to be a ""manager"" had the nerve to get him self a cocktail and parade around the establishment with it in his had while his customers weren't receiving any type of service what's so ever. After all was said and done, I had to get out of my seat to go look for him just to get my check so that we could leave... and after hours of sitting around wondering what the hell was going on he returned with our $200 check!!! Sounds like money well spent, doesn't it???? You should try it out for urself some day so u too can be left in amazement of how easy it is to get robbed in NYC!

The first time I came here I had a burger and it was awesome! Couldn't say anything bad about it, but it wasn't also over the top. The  second time I came here I had two drinks, the Mac attack and the steak with yuca fries from the Breakfast menu. The drinks here are great as well, I remember one of them was with vegetable juice which sounds bad but was refreshing. I ordered the Mac attack as an appetizer and also because saw it mentioned by fellow yelpers. It was okay. I would give it a 3 out of 5 , I added hot sauce to make it savory. My steak dish was okay as well, the only thing on the dish I loved was the Yuca fries! They were amazing !I would probably order the fries on its own if I could.The service here is great, they always check back to see if we needed anything. I would give this place a 5 out of 5 for the service.The environment is very loud unfortunately and thats one thing I remember going there the second time.

158,Thando B.,"Manhattan, NY",89,2,0,1.0,12/10/2017,"I've eaten here a few times throughout the years and I usually enjoy the food. Today I had such a poor experience that I can no longer frequent this establishment.I was craving their chicken and waffles, so I walked over. I tried to enter the restaurant then a security guard stopped me and said ""you can't come in, you're wearing sweatpants."" I was wearing Nike track pants at the time and tried explaining the nuances to no avail. He retorted, ""you can't come in with those"".I walked away angrily and called the restaurant to express my disappointment. A manager hastily explained me to that the restaurant "" doesn't allow athletic wear, hats, or hoodies after ten pm"". I'm sorry, but did I miss something? You sell chicken and waffles, you're not a Jean George establishment. Why are you discriminating based on sartorial choices? When restaurants employ dress codes like this it is clear they don't want a certain type of customer to visit their venue. I will never eat at this place again and I suggest you don't either, unless you want to be subjected to arbitrary dress codes.",4,2,

Relatively large restaurant but very popular so there definitely is a wait if you go at the popular times. Even though I'm a big mac and cheese fan and I plus usually go for that esp since it's well known here, I was really feeling breakfast so I got an omelette with avocado pesto and spinach, which comes with toast and side salad. Very solid omelette but the ""avocado pesto"" was basically just avocado but that's fine. Pleasantly surprised that the iced coffee had free refills! The Nutella sticky bun was also really good - not Auntie Anne's/Cinnabon level sticky but still good! The lemon ricotta pancakes were heavenly. Service was quite slow but fine for a leisurely meal. Not expensive, just a solid option for brunch!",,,

First, the hostess with the blue hair needs an attitude adjustment. As we ( a party of 7, that turned into 6 because they took way too long) stood at the entrance and saw that they were busy, we OFFERED to sit at the bar. Instead we are led to a table in the back. After 15/20 minutes of sitting there and no one coming to our table, she comes to let us know we are being moved. Therefore we had questions, as anyone would when starving and wondering if all the servers took the night off. These questions led to eye rolls and twitches of the neck. But, we moved... and waited another 20+ minutes for someone to come to our table. Finally, we ordered and ate delicious mac and cheese spring rolls, salmon (tasty), tacos (good), and burgers (too overcooked and tasted of char). Waited 30 minutes for a bill, and once we gave our form of payment, we didn't receive it back for another 15 minutes. All in all, majority of our food was really good (especially the spring rolls), but the two stars comes from the service we received. The manager tried to make the experience better, but we as well as many tables around us agreed this was one of the worst experiences service wise.",3,2,

Here's what we ordered:Biscuit (complimentary)It's good!Rosé SangriaPretty good! For $35, I was expecting to get more of the actual sangria rather than getting too much ice. Won't order again.Mac attack (Mac and cheese sampler)Slightly over-cooked macaroni noodles. A little runny/watery when it first came. Eventually, the consistency will get better as the cheese slightly thickens. The flavors were a little weak. I wouldn't order this again.Cornmeal calamariWaaaaaay over cooked - overly crispy. Some of the pieces were burnt.Chicken and wafflesChicken was really well prepared. Good amount of batter, but not too thick. Waffle was terrible, it taste weird and the texture was very off. The hot sauce that was served with the dish complements the chicken really well. Good chicken, bad waffle. Mac and cheese Spring rollQuite a unique dish. The Mac and cheese has pretty weak flavor, but at least the spring roll wrapper wasn't overly crispy or burnt. Overall a good dish. This is probably the only item I would order again.Overall, it was an okay visit. I rated this place with 3 stars because the service really was solid even though the food was pretty disappointing. Our waitress was very attentive and really nice. Even though service wasn't fast, considering how busy the place was, I'm impressed with their speed.I probably won't return here for anything else other than their Mac and cheese spring roll (and the solid service).",,,

165,Brett K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,5/4/2018,"Like this place a lot!!Pros:- food is really good and well priced especially for the city- the portions are great and the term cafeteria does the presentation no justice- staff is great, always a pleasure to greet us and answer any questions- CHICKEN AND WAFFLES (you're welcome) Chicken is huge, moist, and well seasoned and the waffle is something like you've never tasted before. *During ""breakfast"" hours the waffle alone with the cinnamon whipped cream and fruit is also quite tasty. - Don't leave here without trying the Mac Attack either. Even if you order as an app for the table it's a must.Cons:- the bathroom is always drab and not that clean, it's co-ed so that may have something to do with it (guilty as charged) pro tip: there is a cool neon sign in the one stall that is defo instagram worthy- the alcoholic drinks are not great, the spicy margarita is the best i've had of the few choices- Lastly dinner hours and weekends can get pretty busy so be prepared to wait a few.The food and service outweighs the cons for sure.",,,

167,Olivia K.,"Queens, NY",80,151,359,3.0,2/7/2017,"It's more like 3.5 stars (to be precise). There were aspects that made it good like the taste of food, but also aspects that made it disappointing like the slow service on a Saturday (about 20 minute wait for food) and pricey cost of some dishes compared to the size of the food. The store itself is pretty nice with the white background and wall decorations. Just like a Cafeteria, it's spacious but can become filled with people.For the food itself, expect to pay about $15 (more or less).BUILD YOUR OWN OMELET [with home fries and a choice of toast or biscuit]: The omelet was not what I expected. The ingredients weren't mixed in with the egg. The wild mushroom and avocado that I ordered was literally under the scrambled egg. CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST: The food itself is not too big. It was more like a croissant with the cinnamon (french toast) taste. With the white cream (?), syrup and fruits, it was pretty good though. NUTELLA STICKY BUN [in a skillet]: I expected to taste a lot of nutella as the name suggest, but it was very subtle. It tasted more like a cinnamon bun with a slight taste of nutella. MAC & CHEESE: It is smaller in size than it seems in pictures.",,,

Food was okay. Nothing that made me go cray. My date ordered a steak and I think they accidentally gave him a pork chop. Who knows. Really, the hostess left a bad taste for the rest of our meal.

Both were absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed the BlackBerries at the bottom of my Wildberry mojito. Can we just take a moment and talk about the biscuits with honey butter? I was very happy with it.My friend and I ordered the cheddar mac & cheese, the classic burger, and truffle fries. They were happy to substitute the regular fries for truffle fries on the burger without an additional fee. However, cheese was in additional two dollars on the burger. The burger was mediocre, just your standard burger. However, the truffle fries were delicious because of the Parmesan topping and the mac & cheese was to die for. I definitely understand why people keep on coming back for the mac & cheese.",,,
174,Sharod L.,"Lutherville, MD",40,16,4,1.0,9/7/2018,"My wife and I visited this restaurant with another couple on a Sunday night. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated. The guy at the door was really cool and kept us updated about our wait time. When we were finally seated, no one came to serve us until about 15 minutes after we sat down. When the waiter finally came to our table, he greeted us with ""Yo!"" Perhaps thinking that was appropriate because he was black and we are black??? I don't know, but that's not how I want to be greeted at any restaurant. Anyway, ordering our food was a chore because the music was so loud that he could not hear a word we said. All of our menu questions had to be asked 2 to 3 times and the same can be said for our actual orders. Only one person at the table ordered a drink (a Coke), and during our 45 minute wait it never came. That's right. They couldn't be bothered to deliver a Coke to the table even though we'd sat there for 45 minutes waiting on our food. The waiter never came back to our table to check on us or update us on our order. Other staff members just walked past our table as if it didn't exist. At some point our original waiter's shift ended and another waiter came to introduce himself. We reminded him about the Coke and he said he'd bring it right over. After waiting another 10 mins for the drink (and our food) we decided to leave. My friend spoke with the manager and received a half-hearted apology. With that said, I can't recommend the food because I didn't taste it. And I would never recommend visiting this restaurant because the service is terrible.",1,,

Cocktail list is fairly inventive - very good margarita on the rocks that isn't too sweet and is spicy. The rolls with honey butter are delicious. I may have eaten more than one given how long the food too to arrive. As far as mains go - the burger is good. The tacos are as good as one can do, given this is NYC. Fries are yummy.

The place is very nice and modern with both bar area seating and table seating. While we waited for our one friend, we stood by the bar. Although we didn't order any drinks, I saw that they had very interesting cocktails, but of course, NYC prices. After being seated, we were immediately given water and bread. The bread was still warm and the butter is a little sweet. Hungry me, ate two pieces. My friends had to stop me or else I wouldn't have eaten my entree. We started off with the calamari and the truffle fries. They were okay, nothing special. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles since I was in the mood for comfort food. I wasn't too impressed. The waffle was soggy and my chicken was overdone. I have to say though, they kept the meat very juicy. Maybe, the bread should've been my entree.

He provided several great suggestions for each course of our meal. We tried the pineapple swizzle, a refreshing semi sweet and very girly cocktail; Cafeteria's twist on an Old Fashion, a modern adaptation of a classic; Escarole Salad with shaved pecorino, apples and a spicy kick; Truffle Oil Mac, a must try for mac enthusiasts; crispy fish tacos and steak tacos, delicious and portions are two tacos each; and the branzino which was cooked to perfection and served with sautéed spinach. The food, drinks, and party like ambiance were all amazing!My only complaint is that one of our dishes was incorrect when it arrived at the table. The busboy apologized and placed an order for the right dish, but the waiter never came over to check on us or apologize for the mistake which took a while to correct.

187,Alyssa A.,"Chicago, IL",103,18,7,1.0,3/10/2018,"1 star because the food was good. They lost the other stars i would've given due to the host and security guard.The night of my birthday I visited NYC and my friends wanted to take me to Cafeteria. They boasted about how great the food and ambiance was. We had a group of 4. The hostess sat us at a table that was very close to another table (hardly any wiggle room) and next to a window (they removed their window covers) and it was extremely cold. I asked her if we could sit elsewhere but at the moment there weren't any tables available so we took our original seats. About 3 minutes later I saw a section across from us with two separate tables. I decided to ask the hostess if we could sit there.I went to the front where the hostess was. I pointed out the two tables and asked her if we could combine them. She said we couldn't. I asked her why not and she explained why. Our conversation was friendly, I just wanted to understand why we couldn't sit there especially since we planned on splitting the checks.In the midst of our conversation, a male host interrupted our conversation to explain to me, again, why my group couldn't sit there. With an excessive amount of attitude he said,  ""If you're a party of 4 why would you have two separate tables? That means you have to have two separate checks. That's going to mess up our sections."" A security guard was next to the host and asked what was the problem. The host began telling the security guard my request and the security guard agreed with the host that my request could not happen. I then tell the both of them that they are being EXTREMELY rude and this conversation had absolutely nothing to do with them -Where was all of this attitude coming from? I am a paying customer.The original hostess then pulls me to the side and apologizes for their (host and security guard) behavior. She was gracious and friendly but the male host and security guard had absolutely no quality customer service. The altercation was the most unprofessional service I've ever received. After the frenzy up front, I sat back down at my table with my group. I requested to speak to a manager. The manager came over and I explained to him what happened. I emphasized that I did not ask to speak to him about our table location but that he needed to be informed of his extremely rude and unprofessional front end employees. While I was speaking with him I could sense that he did not care. He ended up moving us to a different table but he never apologized for his employees words or actions.The waiter assigned to my table was kind and professional. The food was good but I wasn't impressed. The situation up front really ruined my experience. I travel to NYC once a month for work and am always looking for new restaurants to try. It sucks that we chose this place for my birthday dinner and I received such shitty customer service from the front end staff - it was extremely boujee which I am okay with because i can afford it. However, their staff needs to check their attitudes. At the end of the day, the customer is right. You should never argue with a customer. I won't be back to Cafeteria and I don't recommend you spend your money here. There's an abundant amount of restaurants in Manhattan that have great food and provide exceptional customer service and experiences. I should've spent my $160 elsewhere.",,,

It was a very casual vibe with a wide array of different ages. I built my own omelet with onions and cheese, my cousin had the lemon ricotta pancakes. The omelet was good, but the pancakes were great. The lemon ricotta put a trendy mix into the average pancake and it was interesting to try they were very flavorful and fluffy. To make the meal complete we got the cheesy grits on the side and I'm so happy we did. It is very hard to find grits in NYC never mind yummy grits. The staff was very nice, service a little slow but it was a busy Sunday morning.",,,

Cool location right on 7th avenue with ample outdoor seating and a cool vibe indoors. I really have enjoyed most things I've tried here, and I love that the menu is kind of random (meatloaf, salmon, turkey dinner to name a few) but with SO many good options. The French onion dip is a classic starter, but I've also enjoyed the tacos and tomato soup. I will say that your bill could quickly add up here if you have a few drinks, apps, and an entree, but as I said before I've pretty much enjoyed everything I've eaten here so you can't beat a predictably good meal.",2,1,1

198,TQ P.,"Austin, TX",0,9,12,2.0,10/20/2017,"To be perfectly clear. I ate all the food on my plate and pretty much enjoyed it. The waiter was nice and seemed accommodating. The problem was asked for salt, never came. I asked for hot sauce, never came. I asked for egg over easy, was rock hard. I sent back my burger because of the egg and it came back better than the first run. Which was lucky. But they took my utensils and never came back with any. So I dunno. Food is good. Sometimes. Service is meh. But done with a smile. Green juice was excellent.",2,,

A special thanks to the hostess who was sweet enough to let me sit first, even though my friend was a block or two away. SO... I was told this place had BOMB fried chicken and waffles. My expectations weren't high as I couldn't imagine a Manhattan restaurant having GOOD fried chicken. I mean, we all know to get the best fried chicken you make the trek down to Brooklyn. That being said, I wasn't surprised when I found my fried chicken to be a bit dry. The breading on top was okay but I found it to be too salty for my tastebuds. Overall, it wasn't melt-in-your-mouth worthy. Let's just say, it was a notch up from KFC. We also tried the Mac Attack, a flight of Truffle Oil, Cheddar and Fontina and Smoke Gouda and Bacon. Again, nothing to rave about. Without the bacon and truffle oil, the mac and cheese would probably have tasted bland. Was it good? It was okay. Could it be better? Most definitely. Truly feel like the mac and cheese was missing a key ingredient, just can't put my finger on it.And of course, being the semi-alcoholic that I am, I had to try a cocktail. I opted for the Cafeteria Cosmo and was surprised to find it tasted like juice. It tasted more like a mocktail. Where did they hide the alcohol??? Maybe I'll stop by to try their brunch options but probably not.",2,2,1
