3,Steve N.,"New York, NY",97,576,23,1.0,5/31/2018,UK Pret is 5-stars; US Pret is sad. I didn't buy anything because the choices seemed insipid and cowardly by catering to supposed US tastes instead of the bold boxes bulging British shelves. The baked goods case looked forlorn. 22 May 2018,,,

Big location as well, so it's a good place to go grab food and coffee and stay to do homework. I'm not sure if they have wifi here, but it's definitely a good spot to get some work done. It's clean, has good air conditioning, and spacious.",,,
5,Alan F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,35,0,5.0,4/26/2018,"Love this location. It's clean, has good energy, and is easy to get to/find.Shout out to Sunita (I think that was her name) for the stellar customer service and smile two weekends ago when I came in. She did such a good job that I wrote a note to myself to give her props, and am now just getting to it LOL.  When you're in New York it's easy to be in your own world and focused on yourself. It's nice to experience someone who was truly of service - made my day!",,,

7,Kim G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0,5.0,2/7/2018,"the 5 stars is not so much about the food. you like Prêt' s products or you don't right?. But their customer service is the best. STAFF is always helpful, polite and friendly. They should probably train all their staff at this location because the other pret on 23rd and Lex or the one in Union square is ok at best.",1,,
8,Jaclyn G.,"Union, NJ",150,160,696,4.0,1/24/2017,"This is my go-to Pret in the area especially if I get to NY way too early in the morning. I've come here to sit and relax in the morning till I go to work. What's not to like?! They have a lot of food options available during breakfast and lunch. They have pastries, oatmeal, sandwiches (breakfast and lunch), soups, salads, and many more. They're also not as crowded compared to any of the Starbucks (at least 4) within this area and slightly cheaper. This location is pretty large and have plenty of tables and seating available downstairs and upstairs. I've even seen a some people conducting interviews here.As far as my experience here goes, service has been excellent and their workers look like they enjoy working here. I've also received a free hazelnut croissant here once! I haven't seen that hazelnut croissant in a while or at any other Prets I've visited lately but definitely try it! It's hazelnut spread inside the croissant and the outside is topped with mini chocolate chips... mm mm",,,
9,Jordan T.,"Queens, NY",46,23,13,2.0,8/24/2017,"I was curious why this place was more empty than every other restaurant in the area. I soon found out... the air conditioning was so cold it seriously felt like a refrigerator. The sandwich that I got did not taste fresh, had cilantro in it, and was put together very messily. The only thing I would recommend is their juices but they were overpriced too.",,,
10,Margi C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,31,8,4.0,3/11/2018,Love their almond Lattes- best I've ever had! Could use some vegan pastries and vegan food options.- vegan croissant would be nice :) But whatever almond milk they use - it's amazing! Will never go to Starbucks again.,,,

I like that they have many vegetarian options. Not a fan of the juices flavors though and think the drinks are not worth it. Also the brownies are great best brownie bites I've ever had hands down . In the morning they have a different menu so i like the egg and portobello sandwich I just wish they had more whole grain breakfast options with bread.",1,,
13,Nic R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,6/18/2018,"I'm giving this place 2 stars, simply because they are always out of everything by 6:00. I don't know why they bother to stay open till 9:00, because they are pretty much down to empty shelves by 6:00. It defies logic, because this street is packed with people till 10:00 pm. When I ask the staff, they say (politely) , ""yeah, we sell out early."" HUH??? But you're open till 9:00.",,,
14,Nate E.,"San Rafael, CA",563,214,209,4.0,7/1/2016,"Not sure how you can hate on really solid, pretty affordable for NYC organic food. I'm a fan of the wraps at lunch, both the chicken and shrimp ones are really tasty. In the morning, I love the southwest breakfast wrap (vegetarian only), bacon one is hit or miss on how crispy the bacon is. Love the 5-grain oatmeal and the chia pudding or yogurt cups are always tasty.Only know is I wish they had cold brew coffee, rather than just iced. And yes, there is a difference in taste, acidity, caffeine level between cold brew and iced coffee, and cold brew wins out every time. Hence the ""trend"" of everyone from Starbucks to Dunkin getting on board. Still, the hot coffee, is quite delicious and organic, big fan of the Lively Latin.",,,
15,Vince T.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,0,1.0,11/9/2017,"I, personally, have not been to this location. HOWEVER my coworker took one bite of oatmeal from this place and her immediate response was ""I am not happy."" The oatmeal was practically frozen... she tried to resuscitate it by adding some hot water, but it was too late. She then tried putting the oatmeal in a toaster bag and toasting it, but it just turned it into this weird oatmeal wafer thing.It was the saddest I think I've ever seen her and it really harshed my mellow.",,,
16,K W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,72,21,2.0,10/12/2017,"I don't fully understand the appeal of pret a manger. I downloaded their app and received 5 free drinks having been one of the first 50k to download it. It's always been pricey in there so this was the perfect chance for me to try it out and see how I liked it. Yesterday, I tried their hot turmeric latte. Normal price is around $4.50 but I got it for free with the app. It was sugar filled and tasted disgustingly sweet. I don't have a high sugar tolerance, and I know this. However, I can't imagine this being drinkable to anyone at all. I can handle some sugar here and there but this was straight syrup. I had to throw out 3/4 of it by the time i walked down the block with it. Today, I decided to give it another shot. I got the pumpkin spice latte. It was decent, at least until the bottom third of the cup. The bottom was all filled with sugar and syrup. It tasted horrible and again, threw out the rest of it. I also got a southwest egg white wrap. This was good, but for $5- it wasn't fresh. The bread was all hard and dried up. I could've spent the same at a deli and had it made fresh in front of me. I would get it again, but just not often if anything. Thank god the drinks were free or I would've been pretty upset dropping so much on undrinkable messes.",,,

18,Justin R.,"New York, NY",1,8,1,4.0,8/23/2017,The staff here have always been friendly to me. The food is the standard Pret selection - but I like it for something quick and easy.

20,Libby F.,"Silver Spring, MD",1146,1469,1138,4.0,7/21/2015,"A great place to get away from the crowds for a latte or organic hot tea.  It's affordable and cheaper than Starbucks. We didn't eat here, but stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a quick pick me up. It was clean, but the trash bins (attempting to separate recyclables and trash) were overflowing.",1,,2
21,Hazel C.,"East Bay, CA",209,738,8339,4.0,4/24/2015,"We found ourselves here for a break and coffee after a few hours of walking and sightseeing first in the West Village and later in the East Village.  We had just taken a taxi back to the Flatiron to see if we can grab a drink at Eataly, but no luck. The warm spring day has packed Eataly's rooftop Birreria! We ended up here instead, and that was fine with me, as I needed to rest my feet! This place is great! Yes, it's a chain, but it's a good place to grab a quick bite or lunch that's affordable.  I've eaten at other Prets before on previous visits to NYC, and it's always a good choice for breakfast, lunch or snack. It's clean, has a lot of seating, and they serve freshly made salads and sandwiches. The coffee was good too. And if you need wifi, you will get the wifi password on your receipt. The only thing though is that this place doesn't have a lot of outlets for plugging in your phone charger. We went upstairs and was able to find one outlet where I could plug my charger. The downstairs area has couch seating as well. They have two restrooms, one downstairs and one upstairs.  You'll need to punch in a code, so you'll have to ask a clerk for it. If I have a choice between Starbucks and Pret a Manger, I would definitely eat at Pret. They make their sandwiches and salads FRESH daily. Whatever fresh sandwiches, salads and breads they have leftover for the day, they are donated to charities. And apparently, each store is given a daily budget to give away free food to customers.

I especially like your soups, brie and tomato baguettes, and your hot wraps. You should consider making that holiday wrap a year-round thing.But just once, JUST ONCE, I'd love to come here and not have to dance around the guy restocking the shelves. I know it's a weird thing to complain about, but seriously. This happens every single time. Are you guys on 2 minute restocking increments? Am I the only one seeing plenty of food on those shelves at the time the guy rolls out YET ANOTHER giant cart of sandwiches?Just once I'd like to be able to select my sandwich in peace. Not bobbing and weaving around the guy who's just pretty much making it impossible to see what's on the shelves. Not constantly having to step out of the way to make room for the guy who's basically stuffing said shelves with unnecessary amounts of food.I'm sure you guys are just trying to get a jump on the rush. But geez louise. Is there no better way to do it? Sorry, I'm whining here. It's a trivial complaint. You and I both know that regardless of that cart I'm still going to come back and get my meatball wrap.PS - Your locations in the UK are better.",1,2,

There were super cute sandwich choices but I decided Tuna sandwich. I like Tuna sandwich. Multi-grain whole wheat bread was fresh, soft and a good texture with creamy tuna. I appreciated this consciously healthy and tasty sandwich. I felt not cheated and received a good Karma. Offering half sandwiches gives more flexible lunch choices. I just add a salad, soup or dessert to half sandwich and make your own combo and getting two different half sandwiches might work as well. I didn't get to try their interesting and healthy name drinks....On the street window side, there are a narrow table facing to the window with a people watching-single sitting area.",,1,

After spending 15 minutes navigating the Pret phone tree (and being disconnected three times - Pret, why does your phone tree direct to a ""line that is no longer active"" for catering help? Is this amateur hour?) I finally reached someone only to find out that the catering order (that I have a confirmation email for) was never received by the location. Oddly enough, they were able to send it over in about 30 minutes (about an hour late in total) without any information from me meaning it was somewhere in their system. Odd. And frustrating. And I'm writing this post while hangry waiting for the delivery.",,,1
28,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,4.0,6/7/2011,"Went out for lunch today and came across a new location for this chain. Pretty much a carbon copy of the one I had lunch at recently in Union SquareClean, bright, and spacious decor.Diverse selection of freshly made sandwiches, salads, and wraps.Hearty and tasty soup selections.Seating on main level and large upstairs level.  Friendly and quick counter staff.Clean bathroomsAs it was hot outside today I was craving a cool salad. There are about a half dozen varieties to choose from, and all freshly made. Had one with chicken, avocado, walnuts, and dried cranberries. You have to purchase the dressing on the side so I went with the balsamic vinaigrette. Good stuff. Went to sit on the upstairs level at the front overlooking the store which was great for people watching. It was nicely air conditioned in there too.What's cool about this place is that everything is made fresh daily with organic and natural products. No additives or extra preservatives, which can cause all types of problems to our bodies. They use local suppliers for their products. At the end of the day they donate leftover food to City Harvest which is a wonderful charity. Funny, next to this location is the Van Leeuwen Ice Cream truck, and next to the one in Union Square is the Big Gay Ice Cream truck. What is this? Some kind of evil plot to keep us fat after we eat healthy?",8,6,6

Your delicious Hoisin Duck Salad Wrap tickled the cockles of my palette given your delicious description. I picked you up, like a grindr hookup without further inspection. And, as I should have suspected, looks were deceiving. All I saw were the plump ends of the wrap. I pictured succulent duck breasts pressed plushly against the soft tortilla pouch. But when I delicately unpeeled your wrapping, I found a good third of your soul missing (see picture). It was like eating a hollow, empty shell. Yes, you were delicious for a moment, but you left me craving for more. And, alas, an additional $6.99 was not enough for me to return for seconds.",,1,

Given the location--on a strip of chain stores, across from Federal Plaza on Broadway--I'm surprised they didn't take over sooner.I haven't sampled much of the food here, because not much of the food is vegan--although, of course, you can get a plain green salad in a pinch. Everything is pre-made (albeit freshly; one of their selling points is that they never offer day-old food, preferring instead to give it away to homeless shelters at the end of the business day)  so naturally there are no substitutions. I often go in for their coffee, because 1) they have decaf at all their locations, 2) it's organic and 3) it's fresh. (This location has a restroom!)",1,1,1

The music could be slightly lower, but it's not too offensive.As for spending your life away at your lap top, why do it at Starbucks, when you can be someplace a bit more congenial?  Also recommended as a calm place to meet someone for a chat.  It is a chain, but you won't feel totally alienated here.  (It is nothing like that frenzied Pret at Union Square.)Nice fresh selection of the Pret sandwiches, etc.  I love the ability to purchase half-sandwiches.  Beware: the decaf is bitter and scary.",,,

Pret brings a more upscale feel with cheap prices for fresh, quality food. First off, the space is designed very well, it feels very open for a New York City sandwich place, and compared to other Pret's it's a pretty big one. There is plentiful seating upstairs and downstairs and it's not overran by the Flatiron lunch rush, there are usually a few open seats and the line at the cashier is never too long. When considering their food, everything is fresh and tasty like all the other Pret locations. I have never picked a bad sandwich or salad, although I do prefer the chicken salad with bacon (add a side of ranch for a $1 or so more).

But it was a new job and I wanted to make friends and so I went.Uh.Turns out Pret is actually perfectly wonderful. Fresh, tasty, cheap and staffed with friendly people. Lots of places to sit. Crusty baguette sandwiches filled with goodness (the vietnamese sandwich is my favorite, followed by a cheddar sandwich I forget the name of). Delicious gazpacho with chunks of ripe avocado.

There is some seating available, which, except for lunch hours, usually has a seat/table available.Their sandwiches range from vegetarian to the usual chicken...turkey club...etc variety.

48,Ari H.,"Mt Kisco, NY",166,411,0,3.0,7/9/2012,"I have a love/hate relationship with Pret. Primarily, because whenever they come out with something that I love, they invariably discontinue it. This has literally happened to me about 10 times with them. First it was the Chicken Coronation sandiwch- Gone! Then the Cracked Black Pepper Chips- Nixed! Followed by the Raspberry smoothie- Dead!Then it was the warm Meatball wrap and the Falafel- which fortunately they brought back. But then went the Egg Florentine Toastie - 86'd!I think the ONLY thing they managed to keep over the years is their incredible chocolate brownie. But even that they had to meddle with, and make it twice the size. It was PERFECT before, and yet they had to get caught up in their own underwear. At least the recipe stayed the same.Oh, and if you've never been, it's a pre-made restaurant with a contemporary, clean, efficient flow to it. There is limited seating and no table service. There are also about 20 or so around the city, so don't feel like you HAVE to eat at this one. They are pretty consistent. Even when it comes to their discontinuing my favs. :(",1,1,2

51,John K.,"New York, NY",6,29,0,5.0,7/31/2012,"I only bother to write reviews of places these days that are awesome.  How can a chain like Pret a Manger be awesome? Good question.  I'm not sure.  But this one on 23rd street/5th avenue is terrific.  The food is ALWAYS fresh, and it tastes the way food is supposed to.  It's a slight premium to the starbucks next door, but definitely worth it.The staff there is really great.  I like the Pret staff in all the locations- but this one is particularly good.  Stephen, Shawniece, Jamel- I don't know the names of the others, but they are all super friendly, super helpful, and they make me much less grumpy in the morning.The place is has a nice upstairs as well that's rarely crowded, although if it keeps getting great reviews, I'm guessing it will be soon.",1,,

I was looking for a Starbucks because I had a gift card, but decided to come to Pret instead, had everything I was looking for. Will be DEFINITELY returning, especially this location!",,,

54,Kristin M.,"Manhattan, NY",13,35,5,5.0,12/22/2014,"Pret A Manger is seriously one of my favorite places. I work right by it and find myself coming back multiple times a week. The food is always fresh, tasty, and healthy. I am obsessed with their Tomato Feta Soup (seriously it is the BEST). And in the mornings I come by and grab a vanilla latte. I don't cringe at the cost of the food here, so I don't feel guilty coming here two or three times a week! Also an added bonus to the amazing food and good prices - the cashiers are all super friendly and the lines move quickly.",,,
55,Jason S.,"New York, NY",0,28,3,2.0,4/4/2013,"Nice location, nice sandwiches. I would give this Pret 4 stars, but I'm taking two off because you cannot sit down and enjoy your lunch in peace without the staff whooping and yelling very loudly and high-fiving each other every few minutes. It's annoying, irritating and obnoxious. I understand that this behavior is part of Pret's policy to sustain ""staff morale,"" but it's completely inconsiderate and it's actually keeping me away from the place.",,,
56,Saori E.,"Los Angeles, CA",205,273,631,4.0,5/23/2011,"Like other Prets, this one has reliable food. Made fresh, on location.I don't like to go to Pret too often, but it was drizzling, and this place was new, inviting, and had a ton of seating. Don't know how long that'll last, but hopefully with their additional upstairs seating area, they'll always have a seat for you.",2,,

Because we have never seen you before and we want you to come back!  Great service, clean, and most of all delicious coffee.  I felt compelled to buy something so I bought a delicious croissant and ate it with my amazing light roast.  Thanks Pret!",,,
59,Bill G.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,5.0,9/3/2014,"The manager of the place (latino, glasses) is the nicest guy. Making sure everyones food is okay, opening the door for customers etc. a far cry from every other take out spot in the hood.",,,
60,Adam K.,"Hoboken, NJ",149,236,30,4.0,9/13/2011,"Great, fresh sandwiches.  Low calorie is a plus as well for those trying to get in shape (other than a circle). I see everyone is a fan of the Vietnamese sandwich, but I didnt like it.  The ham and cheese is great, if simple. The smoked chicken and mozzarella is also a reliable choice.  The skinny gazbacho was good too. A little pricey but I think a fair trade off for the freshness and deliciousness.",,,
61,Peace L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,65,1,5.0,11/10/2013,"I love Pret.  Even on a bad day, the friendly and helpful employees at Pret are able to (temporarily) suspend my unpleasant attitude.  The food is always fresh, delicious and CONSISTENT, even when busy.  Pret should consider writing a book or patenting their method of hiring/training the right employees and providing consistently delicious food daily (this seems to be a huge challenge in NYC).  Also, the hot chocolate is awesome!!! Perfect balance between delicious chocolate & warm (soy) milk.",,,

63,Joe B.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,28,0,3.0,4/11/2014,"For a franchise whose red ""bubble flags"" float all over the google map of NYC, this place serves pretty good food. They've got a good system of tasty grab and go sandwiches, salads, soups, and sweets; excellent service,; and clean, bright spaces.I run into this location before jumping on the 6 train very other week or so, and ive never run into a long line, but i also travel at off hours. There's always something healthy and fresh available. The new spicy chickpea wrap is really good-love the curry yogurt sauce, and I like the Italian wedding soup, turkey chili, and the avocado baguette. Those are much better than acceptable, but I haven't been disappointed with any other offerings. Most aren't really exciting but like I said they're fresh and flavorful. The nice thing is the food is consistent. If you get the lentil soup this week, it'll be just as good next. The extra nice thing is that the staff are very friendly and helpful. The chain has done a good job training them in the products and in customer service. Not put on at all; the attitude seems genuine. Makes the food taste a little better I think. Good place for a quick bite a couple steps above the ordinary.",,,
64,Nicky C.,"Orlando, FL",0,29,13,3.0,8/21/2013,"I came here because I didn't have enough time to get a grab of food somewhere else, and is conveniently close to my school. The Food: I had a turkey sandwich with cheese, and lettuce & tomato & some sauce ( I forgot what kind). By the way, The sandwiches come prepared already. You just pick what you want and pay at the counter.My experience over all : The sandwich was delicious. I was considering coming back, and making Pret A Manger my go to spot for lunch.  However, some time later after I finished eating the sandwich. I was having this crucial heartburn. That never happen to me before. So therefore, I would not be going back anytime soon.",,,

68,Barb B.,"New York, NY",201,503,0,4.0,3/10/2012,"Pret is such a great chain. I wish more of them were like it. The food is reasonably healthy and tastes good and they are so efficient with their service that even at 12:15 on a weekday you can be in and out in under five minutes. I tried one of the sandwiches you can have toasted, because melted cheese makes everything better, and it was darned okay. I do wish they had a few spinach salads, they are my favorite - all their salads have mixed greens. But really that is a nit. I am a fan of their oatmeal also, it is super creamy. And you cannot beat the prices with a stick. So overall Barb = Fan!",,,
