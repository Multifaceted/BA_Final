If you go, definitely take a trip to the spacious back area - Decor is insta' worthy. The music playlist had me singing along all night, and I saw that they even do theme nights throughout the week. You can tell that they care about the neighborhood community and the people who come by. If you're thinking about a good time on the Upper East Side, I recommend stopping by!",3
1,,7/20/2017,308,,"Minneapolis, MN",Jonathan H.,64,4.0,359,"I have been here a few times during my trips to New York City.  This is a wonderful bar for hanging out with friends and having a good time.When I first approached this establishment, I was expecting an edgy interior.  I was expecting something similar to The Eagle, also a fantastic gay bar in Manhattan.  This assumption was based on the appearance of the outside, especially the door.  When I entered, I was surprised at how wrong I was.  This is not a bad thing.  The inside actually looks like a typical bar next door but with a little pizzazz.  The interior reminds me a little bit of Johnny's Bar, again another fantastic gay bar in Manhattan.I describe this place as cozy and casual.  I enjoy looking at the decorations they have, especially the pictures, the lights, and the stand-out decorations they have on the wall.  The smaller size makes it hard to lose my friends, and it makes it easier to meet new people.  The employees appear to have a good eye on cleanliness and order.  I understand that there are some drunk people at times and that a lot of people like to leave their glasses at a random spot.  The employees seem to do a good job at keeping an eye on such details.  Besides the at-times numerous used glasses, I have not encountered any major problems with major messes or clutter.  Overall, I have always felt comfortable walking in here and enjoying a few drinks.The employees are always friendly and charming.  A couple of them can get a little flirtatious at times, but this is not a bad thing.  In a way, it can be a good thing because it makes me feel that much more beautiful.  They are always good at carrying a good conversation about they gay life when nobody else is waiting for drinks.   They seem to be in good spirits every time I walk in here.  Therefore, I feel comfortable approaching the staff for any requests I may have.The employees appear to be knowledgeable of every drink that exists.  I have asked for some drinks that many other bartenders do not recognize.  The bartenders here have recognized every drink that I request.  These unrecognizable drinks are the minority of what I order, but the bartenders' efforts on this deserve to be acknowledged.  Mostly, I order the vodka cranberry or the martinis.  Regardless what I order, the drink comes to me at a reasonable time, and it always tastes delicious.When I am in New York and looking for a good time, I will continue keeping this place in mind.  I feel like I can count on them for overall quality customer service satisfaction.",5

3,1,5/18/2018,1,,"Syracuse, NY",Margaret S.,0,5.0,3,A wonderful and friendly atmosphere. The bartender was attentive and extremely nice. I had a great time celebrating with friends there for the night. I can't wait to go back! Will definitely be one of my upper east side go to bars!,2
4,2,1/4/2018,0,1,"Yorkville, NY",Sandy H.,2,3.0,29,"Love the staff and crowd. The bartenders always have a smile. They pour you drinks heavy, abc can converse with the best of them. It's a great safe space for local UES guys trying to meet other local LGBTQ neighborhood people. The patrons all welcome you with open arms, the music is.... ok and repetitive. The place isn't pretentious and you can just be.... you. And I like that. A pregame, a night cap, a happy hour place to unwind..... So why 3 stars? The manager (if he is even still employed there)I like beers and my beer selection request for some updates of local IPA's are going to deaf ears I get that not everybody likes beer but the beer selection is quite boring. I merely tried to suggest updating the bottles and maybe getting a new beer on tap and the told me that the selection was great (which is the sports bar staples with different labels. Bud, Bud Light, Heineken, Coors etc). The IPA is boring and there's nothing worth drinking. He said to me ""gay men drink vodka, you don't know anything about the bar business."" Limited space means that you can rotate seasonal drinks and try new things. Stagnation leads to decline in a business. We all know that.",2
5,,1/4/2018,317,,"Manhattan, NY",Djamila B.,0,4.0,8,"Absolutely love this place. Staff is absolutely lovely, great tunes on the juke box, great specials, and show tunes night is the best. One of my favorite spots in the neighborhood.",1
6,1,4/24/2017,231,,"New York, NY",Molly H.,1,5.0,37,"Had such great time here. It's really tiny, but the people are so much fun, the music is good. It's nice and not always common to feel welcome as a girl at a gay bar, and I appreciated it. Also, I feel like I should mention that I had so much fun that I left my credit card on the bar after closing out - they returned my call asking about it and held onto it for over a week, and then I even had a nice time going to retrieve it. Bonus points.",2

Drinks are decently priced, it's a small place but there are some nice couches in the back to lounge on. The best thing about this place is the artwork. I won't give it away here, please go check it out for yourself... I promise you won't be sorry!It's a little far from my place so I don't go there that often, but if you don't feel like trekking downtown to go to a gay bar, check out the Tool Box!",7
10,1,4/30/2015,128,4,"Manhattan, NY",Joe D.,0,3.0,70,"Friendly gay bar, good happy hour.  Drink chips.  Been there about six times.  The seating at the bar is ridiculously cramped.  if there are more than ten people in there it is incredibly hard to get past, but that's not really their fault.  Its a small place, a toolbox if you will.  Two bartenders I met were incredibly nice and good looking.  they both wore fake dog tags so I guess that's their uniform.  Some guy was in the middle of the bar playing solitaire on two of the occasions I was there.  WHY???   Why would the bartenders allow him to take up valuable real estate, at the bar, being completely anti-social and NOT DRINKING.  Not only is there a weird guy, by himself, ignoring everyone at the bar; but HE'S NOT EVEN A PAY/TIPPING CUSTOMER.  Someone told me he is related to the owner.  So what?  If that's the case, he should be in a corner somewhere unobtrusive.  It's really bizarre.  I actually like this bar, despite my review.  If Solitaire Man is there, I won't stay long.",2
11,3,11/25/2014,300,3,"Manhattan, NY",Elyssa J.,142,4.0,590,"I've been here twice. Once because my roommate wanted to go to a gay bar and the second time with another friend.The first time everyone was really rude. Like I was encroaching on their space. Since I had no reason to come back, I never did. Almost two years later, a friend suggested this bar so why not?It was a Thursday night and I was really happy the bartender let me put on the Ravens game. Some of the other bar patrons told me I was ""the most manly"" person in the establishment. Ha! The bartender here was very nice and took the time to explain the specials. I love that there are free snacks to much on!The second time really made up for the first and while this isn't my scene and would patron other bars in the area (I am straight), I will happily come here again if someone insisted.  May I suggest the night with go-go dancers? X-D",2
12,1,3/31/2014,69,2,"New York, NY",Brent H.,93,5.0,113,"The place is great. Simplistic and genuine. The owners left me with with a warm feeling and filled me with intrigue. I had a great experience while I was there and I will go back soon. The cute bartender was all smiles and the customers I met while I was there were great; friendly and courteous. If you're looking for a good time than this place is great.ps -I think that Jen R is inaccurate in her description. I think she's a drama queen that was jealous that her friend was getting hit on. Check yourself before you wreck yourself, Jen R.",3
13,1,10/12/2013,1,6,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",Tristan S.,1,5.0,1,"It was my first night out in NYC, people were friendly, easy to interact with. Everyone played their rolls, bartender, dancer, customer. But we all slipped in and out of character from time to time.",2
14,,12/2/2013,126,,"New York, NY",Stef S.,6,4.0,741,"Didn't know what to expect but I love the Toolbox. It's a great gay bar in the neighborhood. I haven't had any bad experiences so far - the bartenders are wonderful and hilarious to chat with. The jukebox is awesome. The 2-for-1 beer deals on Mondays are awesome. It's tacky and seedy, but what else would you expect with a dive bar. If you're looking to pick people up, this is probably not the place... the crowd is middle aged gay men. But if you want to chill somewhere with your friends, it's a great neighborhood spot. The stripper pole platform is hilarious.",3
15,2,5/21/2015,81,1,"New York, NY",Jay B.,9,5.0,177,I like it. 2-4-1 drinks till 10 three stops up on the m15. No complaints here. Bartenders are fun. Crowd is chill. I need to see this downstairs lounge....,2
16,,4/25/2016,31,1,"Euless, TX",Jack C.,0,2.0,9,"Tiny little neighborhood bar that I came across quite by accident, when there last Saturday night. There was a DJ and the volume was so hight that I could feel on the bar. It was the like you where at a huge venue 20 times it's size. I had to yell my order to the bartender, then he got it wrong...I couldn't talk to the person I came with. Wanted another drink while waiting for another friend  but the bartender was into the other bartender and left us sitting there without a rink for 15 minutes, we just left. This would be a great divey bar that people could enjoy if it weren't pretending to be a miniature Dance Bar. It's a Mixed crowd that would enjoy a bit more mellow background music and have a chance to meet people and talk with nice glass of whit wine or martinis.",3
17,,6/19/2016,0,2,"Manhattan, NY",Steven W.,0,2.0,41,"Had a disappointing night here last night. The bartender was very inattentive, although the bar was not unusually crowded. For the most part, he was not busy making drinks, but just chatting. I could tell a few other patrons were frustrated. It's too bad, because I have some friends living in Yorkville and, in theory, Toolbox would make a nice go-to spot, as the only gay bar in the immediate area and one of only three on the UES. But unfortunately, we didn't have a very good experience. I'll give two stars, because I think the potential exists and maybe the bartenders just need a reminder that people's experience at Toolbox is shaped to a large degree by the service the bartenders provide. That service will have a big influence on whether people come back and recommend the bar to others.",
18,,4/14/2016,476,3,"Manhattan, NY",Devin M.,4,2.0,3,Great bar on the Ues just don't use the juke box cause the Dj will decide there music is better and play what they want just don't waste your money here.,
19,,3/4/2015,782,,"Manhattan, NY",Sarah Rylee F.,16,5.0,80,"I cannot express how much i love this place. my close gay friend brought me here twice and thats it, im in love. the 2for1 happy hour is amazing with their already decent priced drinks and every bartender has been beyond sweet. theres some bars where i do not feel comfortable being a straight woman and i get a few glares from the staff or patrons but here everyone is welcome! i normally hate kareoke but i stopped by during it once and even that was fantastic! in my eyes the tool box can do no wrong. see you soon!!",2

21,1,2/20/2015,0,,"Raleigh, NC",Sean K.,0,5.0,8,If you want fun in a neighborhood bar atmosphere check this place out. It's just plain friendly.  cute guys and gals and a treat outside of Hells Kitchen and the Village,

(If you get here before 10pm they are 2 for 1) The atmosphere is very friendly, safe and, laid back. They make you feel so comfortable and at home, that it becomes hard to stay away.

Just a fun gay bar with friendly people and strong drinks. I was in for bingo night a couple weeks ago and had a great time.Apparently they have a downstairs room where some naughtiness is known to go on, but it was closed on the Wednesday night I was there.",1
26,,1/28/2015,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Natasha J.,5,5.0,5,"Last weekend I finally made my way into this bar. My sister and I had never been into a gay bar, but we were immediately welcomed! The bartender quickly got us drinks and even handed me the remote, and told me to choose a channel. The atmosphere was amazing-- everyone was nice and singing and dancing, even when my drunk sister picked out unlikely choices on the juke box. When we ordered our second drinks, the bartender made a mistake. We told him that he had gotten our orders wrong, and he was extremely apologetic and immediately poured us new ones, no questions asked! I look forward to coming here again. I was in a group of three straight girls, one straight guy, and one gay guy, and we all had an amazing time and had fun dancing and talking to all the other customers. I'm definitely looking forward to visiting this bar again!",1

28,2,1/20/2009,264,2,"Nashua, NH",Ryan D.,64,4.0,358,"I don't know what I was expecting from 'The Tool Box' ... but I have to admit, I was expecting something. I really only find out about gay bars one of two ways: I read about them, either through some website or the latest issue of HX or NEXT, or Scott B. tells about a place he's been to and we try it out together or one night I go it alone along his suggestion. The Tool Box is the one place I found by myself, by accident, while I was trekking downtown on the M15 bus. After seeing the almost unseeable rainbow flag as a blip on the landscape, I busied myself when I got home, trying to see what the place was exactly.I decided to go there on a cold, almost frigid, winter's night. It was a Monday. With the reputation that this place gets as being lame and devoid of people, it really didn't disappoint on this particular evening. I think there were 3 other people when I got in, if that. Within the first hour there, I had a solo audience with the bartender. He told me about the place; he said on Fridays and Saturdays, it gets pretty busy. He was a NY native; he works on Mondays and Fridays. He's a cool dude, if you ever get the chance to go there and meet him.The Tool Box isn't for everyone. It's not a Chelsea bar where everyone is attractive (or at the very least, thinks they are). It's more of a dive place where people who live around there and go, and everyone is kind of nice and treats you like a human being. The ungayest of gay bars. I had fun, and I actually spoke with people at the bar for once... something I don't usually do, unless I'm really, really drunk. It's more of a relaxed vibe, so if that's you, this might be your place. They also have a pool table, which I'd love to play. I wish it was bigger; one reason they may not be super busy all the time, it's the severe lack of space. Still, if my night was any indication, you'll have a lot of the place to yourself.",7
29,,11/13/2012,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Jeremy S.,0,4.0,5,I found this place by reading a craigslist missed connection. Never knew a gay bar was in my neighborhood of the Upper East Side till i read that. Me and my boyfriend decided to walk up and check it out one night. Small and narrow inside till you get to the back. Other then that its a fun place.  I've never been there when they have gogo dancers though. Wouldn't mind checking them out. Bartenders have always been really nice. People inside are always really friendly as well. Nice drink special until 10pm. Wish it was closer to my house.. but then again i would probably go all the time. Cute boys inside.,2
30,3,8/29/2009,13,5,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",Timothy P.,0,4.0,20,"A dive. Seedy. Porno on screen. Nasty, ugly stripper on the bar. Old men looking uncomfortable. $7 Corona. Awesome (current) music playing on a Saturday nite. Loved it! It felt casual and non-judgmental.",3
31,1,1/25/2009,7,21,"Jersey City, NJ",Otto M.,0,2.0,38,"More dump than dive bar, no drunks or dipsomaniacs, so it's really just a lousy little place with Stella on tap and prices that are obscene for the location. $6 for a bottle of bud light??? WTF?  The only excuse is that it's local and the only gay bar around.The entrance is a silver door in a brick wall. The bar is so (structurally) shallow that you can't pass once there are three patrons in the place. Which, due to it's lousy decor, prices and location, isnt' a real problem. There is a pool table without a full set of balls. I'll let you fill in your own joke for that one.  Music is via a laptop that only has mid-90's fag-tasic dance music. Martha Wash, Anastacia, (enter name of a random dancing euro-whore in colorful wig), that Swedish pop band whining about wanting another baby, and other crap you don't want to hear ever again.Saturday night we met 'Nickolai' the Ukrainian bartender who looked so young I wanted to card him. Me and my buddy were the ONLY people in the bar until 11. (we were going to a party in the area)  Nick is a lousy bartender and really seemed to believe we were there to meet him and hear about his life.He has been in this country for a year and lives in Bklyn with 2 guys  and a girl who wants to do him but he's doesn't like fat chicks. He works part time in construction. He is a borderline imbecile, a fact he didn't' offer but my Friend made a professional diagnosis before finishing his first beer.  But once you see Nick's dewy face and stupid grin, you know he wasn't hired for anything other than looks.He told us he was straight about a dozen times, about how he wanted to sleep with a Chinese girl, and how he didn't believe gay Jews existed. Nick, so cute, so dumb. And he's straight. order a beer, and he tells you he's straight. Ask for a drink, it's delivered with ""I'm straight"". Happily for me, I never feel the need to tip 'straight' bartenders in gay bars. Oh, the place had a shockingly clean bathroom.",6

33,,4/28/2009,118,1,"Manhattan, NY",julian e.,0,3.0,4,so i just moved to this neighbourhood and checked this bar out on a monday night around 11. there was hardly anyone there. the bartender was friendly. the place quite a dive. There are no windows. you just have to open the door and jump in with no idea what your getting into (i'm not so into that). played a game of pool and called it a night. I will review again on a more happening evening... cause as it is there's nothing too recommendable.,
