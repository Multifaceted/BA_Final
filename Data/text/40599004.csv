At the risk of sounding like a nostalgic old head, I am happy this E Houston staple is still around from my college daysFriends and I met at Botanica for happy hour today and it was just like old times. Their happy hour runs until 8pm. I ordered several glasses of the sauvignon blanc. It was very drinkable well chilled, crisp, had slight notes of apple.Service at the bar was super fast and the crowd was eclectic and diverse!

Drinks were 50% off which was unheard of for NYE in New York, and everyone was given complimentary champagne for the countdown!Very divey, drinks are cheap for the area and music is live. Lights are dim and there is chatter that fills the atmosphere without being too loud (unlike some places where you can't hear anything!). The Happy Hour (6-8PM) is a great deal, with drinks under $5 mostly all day, all week.",2

I had the ginger drink and my BF had something with mezcal & aperol. Neither were worth the $$.Interior is pretty cute.,1

Located on the corner of East Houston and Mulberry, the space boasts a large seating area with plenty of tables and chairs for large parties. Since we were a group of about 15 we didn't have any trouble claiming a table in the back that was large enough to accommodate us all.Since it was Saturday night they had a live DJ playing music, who also took requests. It was pretty packed by the time we decided to leave but overall it didn't seem stuffy or uncomfortable throughout the entire time we were there.Decent drinks and cheap prices definitely should put this on the list if you're looking to find a spot in LES. The staff was friendly and efficient and the space definitely does allow you to hang out with a large group if you're looking for a bar that can accommodate that. Overall a great time!",5

The taps rotate here and the lights are dim, the music is live and the people, are what make this place. You can get cheap rails and brews anywhere but this place is my go to when in the City and need to burn some time or celebrating with friends.What also makes this place special is the seating, not too many bars with relaxed style seating such as benches, ottomans and sofas. The back room is also pretty cool for large groups as well. Again, this isn't going to woo the pretentious Tinder date you just matched with but perfect for the person that somehow just gets you.

The crowd is a little hipster-ish but you can't beat $4  drinks, $3-$5 beers and $5 wines from 6-8pm seven nights a week. The space is subterranean and no-frills but is spruced up a bit by some candles. Not crowded at all the Saturday less than a week before Thanksgiving and lots of stools, benches and banquet seating to spread out on.

The bartender, who appeared clearly overwhelmed, exhibited that he is in no condition to man the bar by himself. He was very rude and took offense to patrons informing him that he incorrectly made their drinks. He was a poor representation of this establishment and his actions alone have me questioning all of the wonderful reviews this place has gotten. To start, he messed up my order but I didn't realize it until I gave him my card, I informed him and told me because he made it I had to pay for it. He handed me the bill then proceeded to tell me that he would kick me out because this is a private establishment and he can serve whoever he wants, as he proceeded to take the drinks I paid for away from me and tell me that he has the power to remove me and whoever else I came with. Even as others around the bar told the bartender to relax and calm down, he ignored their requests and continued to try his best to embarrass me over his own mistake. His actions were juvenile and classless and I certainly did not deserve to be treated the way I did at this bar. I will make sure to inform anyone who I come across to never step foot in this place as long as John the bartender is still employed there.",8

There is also no table service so we had to order and pay at the bar.At around 6:30 PM, it started to get really rowdy so this is not a place I would suggest to meet for a nice chat over some drinks--we were basically shouting to hear each other over the ruckus.",1

He played terrible music all night, and said he didn't care at all about what customers wanted to hear. When we requested music, because we were the only customers there, he chastised us - it seemed to be racist, as he said he didn't like ""our people's music, from looking at you.""

Okay maybe that language is a little bit too flowery but none the less you would be doing yourself a favor by going. If you're looking to grab a few drinks but don't want to turn all the way up and still want to maintain your chill mode but have the ability to hear the person sitting across or next to you then you'd be doing yourself a favor.

I would snag those seats because once they are gone, they are gone. There is a fair amount of seating here, but not too much space in general. The vibe here is very artsy and relaxed. And the drinks are a fair price as well. We ordered gin and tonics which were not too sweet. Overall I would definitely recommend stopping by here if you're in the neighborhood.",6

The $4 draft cider had me at hello when I first stumbled upon this place, the $5 wine stole my heart, and the $4 mixed drinks won't let me go.  I recommend getting here by 6pm at least if you want to snag a good table.  Also, bring your ID card because security will not let you get in without it!Enjoy and thank me later.P.S. - I almost didn't write this review because I didn't want to share my SoHo/NoHo Gem :)",9

I decided, against better judgement, to go for a rose apple cider instead of one of the cool sounding mixed drinks like Ginger Yum Yum. The rose apple cider came in a pretty cool bottle and the label says that it's actually a local New York cider. Cool.This bar is not divey at all, and I completely disagree with Yelpers who characterize it as such. It's quite hip and young.

I came here to meet up with a guy I knew, which unexpectedly turned into a date. Maybe Botanica has some romantic magic or we just really hit it off, but it ended up being an amazing date.The drink deals were great and the alcohol spurred the conversation. The Australian bartender was charming too, and told my date to be sure to take care of me. The drinks were so cheap that even though we were good and drunk by the time we were trying to close our tab, the bartender said we didn't hit the $20 minimum yet. We had a couple of shots before hitting the road, and the rest is history. Oh, so after that first date? We're still together, 1.5 years later. Thanks, Botanica!",12

Botanica is a beautiful, dimly-lit, divey bar. The entrance stairs come down from street level, so you already feel like you're going underground when you walk in. There's enough seating for just about any group size, but if you see an open booth, you'll want to snatch it quickly! Seats fill up quickly here after 6PM. The daily happy hour is one of my very favorites! Drinks are very cheap here, $4 for draft beers and ciders, $5 for wine, $4 for tasty well drinks--from the time they open (5PM on weekdays/6PM on weekends) until 8PM. Each time I've been, I've been told it's a $10 on cards, which I am more than happy to meet and go beyond!I've been to a few bars with happy hour specials where it tastes and feels like their drinks are watered down, but the drinks at Botanica are always strong to me! I adore their Ginger Yum Yum cocktail and am ecstatic about anywhere I can get bottles of Crabbie's ginger beer. You can't beat the prices and atmosphere here. Plus, the bathrooms are pretty clean and have some interesting graffiti in them. There are very few negatives about this spot. Sometimes, especially later in the night, the music is a little too loud for table conversations. Depending on the bartender--and if you get squeezed into an awkward spot at the counters--it might take a while for you to get your drink, but generally the service is quick and friendly. If it's not, just save yourself the trouble and get two drinks at once, is my advice. I love this spot and will definitely continue to be a regular patron!

They also have an awesome dj that comes in sometimes too. On another note, one time I left my ipod here in a seat cushion, and the bartender was awesome and kept it for me until I was able to come back in and get it the next day.

Well, I admit that I've been missing out.Bontanica Bar is cheap, chill and a great place to be with a group of people. It's located right on Houston St. and has a small entrance. I like how they write the drink specials on the mirror. The bartenders are friendly and like to chat with you! There's decent music and even a juke box in one of the corners. I never would have came if it weren't for my friend's birthday party... and our whole group wouldn't have tried out so many drinks in one night if we didn't have a collaborative goal to get the birthday girl completely drunk.

After that, the bar becomes swarmed with people specifically on weekends. The drinks are so strong, standing no longer becomes an option so the seats come in handy. There is also a separate large seating area which is ideal for groups. No RSVPing required.If you'd like to use your credit/debit card, there's a $20 tab minimum. So, bring cash. There aren't any mirrors in the bathrooms so don't go to the bathroom thinking you're going to have a moment of vanity and take some selfies. The bathrooms are also unbearable. It smells like cruelty and looks like hell.People actually use the dance floor to dance rather than just congregate and I'm starting to think that that's a rare find. So, take advantage of the dance floor.The DJ spins old school hip hop and pop all night. Sometimes really shitty music too but that's another review in itself. He's also good to look at (before 10:30 because after that, they dim the lights and with my astigmatism and the alcohol, seeing becomes an issue).The Wi-Fi password is posted behind the bar and as amazing as that may be, you won't need it. You're at a bar, surrounded by people. Put your phone away and socialize.Also, there is no cover.Overall, the crowd, drinks, music, and atmosphere make Botanica one of my favorites (well after 11).",7

The bar is a bit submerged from the ground floor so the windows don't provide all too much light inside. There is seating in the back for groups in case the front gets a bit crowded. The decor is an eclectic mix of bright red couches, black couches, wooden seats and a variety of wooden tables (from antique to typical bar tables).

Second, a *tear* for departed Nolita House...) My uppity a** has since been clued in, and I realize that this is one of the best spots around. No frills, no drama, chill crowd, great ginger drinks, nice bartenders, and live DJ on weekends (maybe weeknights too, but I've only been on Fridays). I strolled in two weeks ago looking for someplace that could salvage my friend's 25 birthday, soured by a bad start at the first stop nearby (that shall not be named). Scored the booth-like couches in the back room without a fight and our 15-deep party had a great time the rest of the night drinking and chatting away.Eventually, it was time to bid farewell to Botanica in search of food, but this latest visit has placed it high on my lists of bars to hit up in a clutch and bars that are cooler than I'll ever be.",4

It was kind of dark and had a divey feel to it. It was close to 9pm and the place still was rather packed, luckily a table opened up a few minutes of us arriving. The music was fine for conversation, but half way through the music got louder and we had to start speaking in our outside voices. But we were sitting in the corner right under the speaker.The bar was pretty crowded as usual. There was only one bartender there, but he was pretty attentive and was quite speedy in ordering and making drinks. It wasn't one of those situations where you sit there trying to get their attention for eternity. The beer prices were a bit lower than average I'd say, $5-7. The mixed drinks to my surprise were only $5. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came. Honestly this place was nice.

Maybe it is the neon red lights, maybe it is the psuedo hipster vibe, maybe I'm just rambling, but either way, this is a tangent.Now for the perks:1. This place is surprisingly huge, you walk into a narrow, basement level bar outfitted with what looks like furniture from an estate sale, but then find an entire semi-sleezy lounge in the back.2. Bartenders are solid folks, usually with a smile and a sense of humor. Why is this so rare?3. There are options for people on a budget.4. There are also drinks made with a little more artistry and a lot of ginger (read: try their drinks with ginger).5. Either way they pour strong.When trying to think what I don't like about this place I could only think of one specific incident where the DJ was playing nothing but top 40 and was REALLY into it. Singing along, putting his hands up trying to get people hyped. I sincerely hope he was summarily fired because it was obnoxious and my crew left.That being said, another time almost no one was there so I went up to the DJ and complimented him for some of the tracks he was playing.

Drinks are so cheap, good pours, and service is exceptionally efficient and over the top friendly.I had a good laugh with the bouncer outside after some bumbling tourists walked by trying to find macdougal, and carried on even after I shouted she was going the wrong way. Even better conversation with John, the super speedy bartender inside who is reading a song of ice and fire as I am, though he's a book ahead of me.

The front part of the place is like trashy / chic.  Hard to explain but you'll like it.  The backroom is more intimate with furniture your great grandparents may have had in thier study in thier upstate home accented with that vintage coffee table to put your drink on.  Best part about this place is the staff.  Bartenders are awesome.  It was my friends bday so I called ahead and asked if they could do anything to make it epic and they decided to make a ""drink special"" on their specials board with her last name as the ""drink name"".  Everyone was walking up asking for the ""$#%^&$@# special"" and she LOVED it.",1

Nolita can be a bit pretentious/expensive/annoying, so it's nice when a place like Botanica exists where you can just come and chill. They have great drink specials and tons of room so it's never completely overcrowded. It's not the kind of place I would go during the day, but it's definitely a good night time spot.",

For more than two years, at least once every couple of weeks, you could find me at Botanica: sippin on ginger yum-yums, trying to order bar snacks (there are none), and more often than not, shamelessly googly-eyeing w/ their rotating cast of ambiguously foreign bartenders, all for naught. (Sigh.)Then I changed jobs and moved 42 blocks and 3 avenues away. I barely have a reason to be in Soho anymore - and yet. Every two weeks - again, I find myself at Botanica. Still sippin on those yum-yums. Still begging for onion rings. Still being stupid.There is just something about this bar that I can't give up. it could be the drinks, which are great (esp. at happy hour!). It could be its backroom vibe, solid tunes, worn-in seating. It could definitely be its clientele - all, generally, attractive, Sedaris and/or Safran-Foer-esque, dark n' stormy. Or it could just be that this was my spot - always a sure bet, and always will be. You love what you know, and I know Botanica.",1

And this was actually after I started keeping really good track of stuff like that. Sometimes they still get by me.Scott B. met up with some people here, or Kevin J. was having a work thing or something. His friends Chris P. and Matt P. were in town, so I think this is where I had my first extended conversation with both of them. I remember talking to Matt for a really long time about how he didn't like New York (he's from Texas and it was his first time visiting here) and by the end of that talk, I remember think he was kind of right.This place was fun when I first got there, but it's like a basement with acoustics to match. When people start getting loud in here- and trust me, they get LOUD- you literally can't here the person standing next to you. I would love this place (pretty affordable bears actually) if it wasn't such a madhouse, but both times I came here? It was. I'd still go for one drink to meet someone, but not a place to spend an evening.",

Happy hour deals are great but it can get really really crowded because of them during happy hour time. Beware of one karaoke night, too, not sure which night that is, though.

190,,11/7/2011,4,,"Brooklyn, NY",Madeline Y.,0,3.0,59,"The dive vibe is along the lines of the late 90s with the no flare bartenders, dark ambience and music too loud to hear yourself think.More so than restaurants, bars are a huge subjective taste issue. So long as people can get there booze of choice they way the want, service isn't necessarily draw. I do like this place because the bartenders are attentive and aren't necessarily there to flirt with the next pretty face. They make a nice cocktail, fill you pints to the brim accept a thanks and say thanks back. That's all that is really desire amongst us regular drinker.It seems really small at first but there happens to be a back room that, unless you're a regular or not too shy about moving deep in to the back of a shady bar, you'd never know.Happy hour prices are decent for the neighborhood of Nolita which has no shortage of booze markets.The major con with this place is really the bathrooms. There are only two and the place can get really crowded around happy hour meaning, right after the happy stops, there's a long line of dancing drunks. The bathrooms are also very gnarly. I doubt if they get so much as a spritz of 409 during open hours.Also, I'm not a big fan fo the amateur crowd that entertains the place. A lot of 9-5 boozers who pack down way too many shots before the 9:00 hour and become a tad annoying to those of us who like to savor our buzz.Otherwise, I'd recommend this place as an afterwork, let your hair down spot to chill. But the best times are to avoid the happy hour crowd altogether.",

I was kind of drunk already and was like eh no big deal, but then he charges me for a drink that took 20 minutes to get together.

The place is much bigger than you would think it is from the outside....it has a back room with more couches and tables.Came here with a few friends and we were very happy. The only issue was that there was only one bartender and many people looking for drinks. Also, they had a problem with the beer taps when I was there so they stopped serving draft beers around 7:30. I asked if I could get a bottle or a can at the happy hour price because the taps werent working, but the bartender said no. I thought that was a little rude. They should have been accommodating after their taps broke. They do, however, have a great beer list.",
