0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,33,2,4.0,11/12/2018,"The Polo Bar has been a place I've been dying to go to but reservations are a pain to get. It is as if you need to have an in to get in or be really flexible with your schedule. I had to ask my boss to leave an hour or so early just so I can get a reservation and make it there. Am I bitter? Not really because I got out early from work...The one thing I've heard people say about this place is their burger. Get the burger! I obeyed and got the burger. Thank goodness I did. It is probably the best burger I ever had!!! The condiments come in little buckets and everything is so well thought out. We did also get the shrimp cocktail, but.... that could have been omitted. The popper they give you as you wait for your meal is to die for. I seldom eat the bread they give you at restaurants... well.... I seldom finish...okay I like the bread basket, but this is just another level of bread basket bread. Love this place. Will leave work early (if permitted) to go again!",,,1
1,Louis Z.,"San Gabriel, CA",136,44,12,2.0,11/14/2018,"We were very excited to come here. We went with a group reservation. Part of our group arrived first and I arrived a bit later with a friend. When we arrived, I believe the hostess was named Courtney, the hostess regarded us with total disdain because she could not find out parties reservation anymore given part of the group arrived earlier. She treated us like dirt and shoo'ed us out. It wasn't until 5-10 minutes later that she came out again saying they had found our group and we're going to let us in. The food was good. Pastrami sandwich was tasty. We ordered the ribeye Pittaburgh style, rare in middle and crispy outside. The desert was interesting, s'mores and ice cream covered in whsikey. Strong whiskey. But none of the food compares to hot rudely we were treated as customers. Will not be coming back and will actively recommend against it. It's a shame because our waiter was fantastic and the food was good too.",,,
2,Courtney C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",481,39,180,4.0,10/24/2018,"This place is quintessential New York! From the decor to the other patrons, the Polo Bar transports you into a world of luxury and opulence. The upstairs bar scene alone is worth a visit. The hustle and bustle is very reminiscent of the New York streets. People are very nicely dressed as there is a dress code (be sure to look it up). My friend and I were seated promptly in the downstairs dining room (take the stairs instead of the elevator). We started with the crab cake, which is not your normal crab cake (see pics). While it did include lump crab meat, which is a plus, I wouldn't recommend. Their take is just a little too out there. I ordered the chicken under a brick which I LOVED even though it included dark meat. The chicken breast was juicy and flavorful and the bed of spinach was perfectly sautéed. I also had the Pink Pony cocktail which is a must try. My friend order the famous burger and fries and it definitely lives up to the hype.While the food was delicious the service was a little slow. It's really busy, so maybe the waiters can't keep track of all their tables, but there were long gaps between our waiter checking in on us.",,,

Very Ralph Lauren and rich feelingWhen you order drinks, the snacks they give are awesome Deep fried olivesGourmet mixed nutsFresh made kettle potato chipsThe drinks are good- over priced but the environment makes it worth itWhen you go downstairs, you are transported into another world like a bustling speak easy. Lots of people and serversThe food is very good- very American. Their Kobe beef hot dog is very good and their Polo burger was one of the better burgers I have had in a long timeThe halibut was very fresh and prepared wellMy only gripe here was their high priced mark up wine list and a $90 corkage fee. So I would stay with beers and mixed drinksDefinitely worth coming for a special occasion for dinner or meet friends for a drink",8,4,8
5,Jaemme M.,"Richmond, Canada",138,30,39,5.0,8/10/2018,"First of all, their bread is amazing. I had 2 pieces and wanted more but I had to save some space for main course and dessert! Place was very elegant, you would definitely want to dress up when you visit. Now about the food. We had oysters for our appetizer. Not a huge ouster fan but these were very fresh! For main course we ordered 2 Rib Eye Steaks with fries on the side, Dover Sole, Ralph's Corned Beef Sandwich and a BLT Salad. For dessert we had the Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and New York Cheesecake. My favourite? CHEESECAKE! Overall, the food was very very good! Ambiance is nice and intimate. PLUS - service was good. Sorry for the bad quality photos! I only managed to take a video.",1,,
6,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,4.0,10/12/2018,I was lucky enough to get a last minute work invite to this spot and am happy that I jumped on the opportunity.Luckily this wasn't something that I had to pay for myself - there isn't a single thing on the menu that isn't shockingly expensive. Even the pigs in a blanket were $14 and cocktails were $20+ (expensive even for New York standards). We split a lot of dishes across the table. Some of the highlights for us were:Corned beef sandwich (a MUST)Pigs in a blanketBread puddingThe free bread was also amaingBesides the food - this is apparently an amazing spot for celeb siting. I'm not someone who tends to notice these things but apparently we had quite a few present just a few tables away from us (Hoda Kotb and Regis). It's an awesome scene with beautiful decor -- definitely a bit bougie so make sure you dress up a bit!,1,,
7,Michael C.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,7,3,5.0,10/18/2018,"This is probably my favorite establishment in New York City! I love the atmosphere and superbly cooked food, but the bar and lounge area that you're met with as soon as you enter the restaurant is certainly the highlight of the night! The cocktails are seasonly themed and deliciously crafted! The burger and pastrami sandwiches are generously portioned and super tasty! A ++ service! Don't forget to butter your popover!",1,,

Great service xAmazing decor xDelicious food xWe made a reservation for 10:30 p.m. and showed up a little early and hung out in the beautiful bar. We were sat right on time for our booking.We started our meal with a glass of wine which was perfection.I started my meal with a bowl of the carrot ginger soup and ended with the veggie burger; both dishes were full of flavor and cooked to perfection. My husband had the hamburger with fries, he said that his hamburger was more on the well done side, when he asked for medium well, however, he still said it was great! We had to skip dessert due to the fact that we were both super full! I would definitely come back to The Polo Bar! Everything exceeded my expectations.If you are in NYC definitely check this place out!",,,
10,Javette G.,"Bronx, NY",53,32,300,5.0,11/12/2018,"I took my husband here for Veterans Day.  The restaurant is located down the street from Trump Tower.  The restaurant is Ralph Lauren Polo themed and it's very well designed.  The food was delicious and that includes the bar des collations.  The drinks are kinda expensive (21 bucks a pop) but they get you buzzing.   For the appetizers we tried the pigs in the blanket w/ homemade mustard(they are oh so cute), the calamari and zucchini w/ two sauces.  For the main dishes we had the St. Germaine burger (8 oz. beef party, blue cheese, caramelized onion w/port wine) it was tasty and the 22 oz. Tomahawk steak w/ mashed potatoes it was cooked great and it was tasty. The side was hen of the woods mushrooms which were different in a good way.  The desserts were really delicious.  The meal was great from start to finish, the staff were great (asked for the waiter Michael and the Maitre D' Cheutine),the ambiance was amazing.  Thank you for having us Ralph.",,,

Updated review","I was skeptical about going to Polo Bar as they are always committed and its a pain in the neck to plan a few weeks in advance but strange things happen in snow storms I was able to get a quick last minute reservation and I made my way - I love the equestrian  setting and the fire place is beautiful along with the million pictures / photos My server was attentive and kind (forgot his name) and checked in with me after every course 5/5I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli with truffle sauce and shaved truffle and it was divine 5/5For the main course I had the veggie burger which was absolutely delicious, some of the fries were hot and some were cold but I only ate a few so didn't care muchburger 5/5 fries 3/5Chocolate Brownie was divine 5/5The staff is very friendly and courteous and every interaction I had whether with the server, hostess or the gentleman who I met when I walked in was 5/5I hope to return soon, maybe during the next snow I'm a fan and happy to return and try other items on the menu Had the carrot Soup with creme fresh - fresh flavors and filling 5/5For the main course I had the veggie burger 5/5For the desert I had the Brownie 5/5The service and staff are friendly, kind and fun so they get  5/5 stars",2,,
12,Lynn S.,"Alexandria, VA",147,842,294,4.0,3/7/2018,"When I left I was thinking how beautiful a dining room it was, but while we were eating it seemed too noisy and busy, typical NYC. We were greeted at the table by huge individual popovers with a mini tub of creamery butter. Then I ordered a traditional burger well-done, but was served one cooked medium, so it went back. I expected a bit of a wait, but within minutes a fresh plate (and silverware) arrived without any fuss at all. The fries served alongside were hand cut and tasty. As a table, we decided to share a single salad of mixed greens. So glad! Had each of us ordered one, we would have never been able to finish it, like the burger, sized generously. The servers were professional so our table was impeccably maintained (no missing silverware/no need to ask for anything). We had a good meal, left feeling full, and enjoyed our experience. Tip: I suggest you arrive hungry. This is not light fare, plus it's expensive.",3,1,2
13,Richard K.,"Boston, MA",84,188,20,3.0,7/3/2018,"The decor was beautiful and the service was lovely. We started with a few drinks upstairs. For me, all the drinks were a little too sweet and lacked the ""bite"" I enjoy in a cocktail. For dinner we were sat by the stairs almost in the foyer. The restaurant was VERY warm. We started with an appetizer special, the lobster rolls. They were great. Three were served and they were light and refreshing. For dinner we got the veggie burger, the southwestern or santa fe (?) and the classic polo burger. My friend who got the veggie burger didn't enjoy it at all. She said it was very dry and not tasty. My classic burger was okay, but nothing special. I enjoy the burger at Capital more. My burger was ordered medium rare but came out more medium or even medium well (almost brown all the way through).I'm glad we popped in but probably won't be back. I think it would be a cute place to pop in for a drink but I don't think they allow walk-ins for the bar.",2,,1
14,Stefanie C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",25,27,14,4.0,7/17/2018,"I wish I remembered the name of the gentleman who took my reservation over the phone (maybe Andrew) because he was so rude! The young man at the front door was sweet when explaining I needed to call even though I was standing there with him but the guy on the phone was awful! The bartender, Louis, was delightful which totally changed my experience for the better! He made great cocktails and great conversation. He recommended a burger and it was awesome! Definitely make your way down to the dining room if it's your first time, don't just stay at the bar so you get the full experience.",,,

18,Alec H.,"New York, NY",0,27,0,2.0,10/17/2018,"How? How is this restaurant in the crevice of a choked up gloomy basement seriously appealing for high ratings? Because it's backed by ""Ralph Lauren"" and some horse paintings? Stop the nonsense. The food at Katz deli is better. Nothing interesting here on any level. The entire first floor is a bar. Spend your money somewhere with actual windows and a more interesting menu. You can't sell me on their bread so stop with the ""amazing"" bread they offer lol.",1,,
19,Franny A.,"New York, NY",840,1280,1046,3.0,2/24/2018,"Luxe clubby decor with equestrian design with a subterranean dining room, the food exceeded my expectations, service sadly did not. We were a group of seven and did the one month reservation in advance. You are greeted by a hostess at the door, the coat check is inconveniently downstairs- no one to help you with your coats. While we waited for the rest of our party we basically had our coats on the floor by the bar- not a good look at this pricepoint.Finally we were seated...Ate:PopoversPolo Bar Salad- $18Salmon $34I also had a bottle of Von Trapp pilsner which was $12. Bartender was not helpful in the selection. The popovers with butter are amazing! Period! Also, the bar snacks of nuts and crunchy olives were quite good and came to the table, but there were not enough at our large table and had to ask repeatedly for butter and nuts on our side of the table-duh. The salad was nice and I loved the salmon after rejecting the chicken under a brick as I thought it was a roast chicken- what? no roast chicken. No one had desert at our table, but the onion rings were also tasty. Frederick Eklund and husband dining at the next table from us. Would I eat here again in this pricey den of elitism with annoying reservation policy and subpar service- oh yes!",5,3,4
20,Ashley P.,"Los Angeles, CA",586,165,237,5.0,4/14/2018,"An NYC must! The drinks, decor, food, it's all good. They have some of the best pigs in a blanket I've ever had. Been here several times and this is the first time I didn't get dessert. Huge fan of their burgers. It's too bad they don't let people come in to the bar without reservations but I guess that's part of the exclusivity.",1,,
21,David C.,"Berkeley, CA",201,668,597,5.0,3/4/2018,"Leave all your heaistations about money at the door, this place is an experience in fine dining. From our arrival, the vast scotch/whiskey variety and service and skill of the bar attendants.  To the attention from your wait team in the dining hall. To the warm Ralph Lauren traditional decor and attention to detail, not one speck of anything was left behind.  (Although the consisten ""polo bar Ralph Lauren"" on all of the plates was too much)The caviar on fingerling potatoes was perfectly heavenly. The puff out bread made in skillets with fluffy yeast is dreamy.  The oysters were also fresh and perfect.Moving onto the main dishes, the veal was a very large portion and made perfectly.  As was the Sole which was a bit pricey but totally MR and totally worth it.  Try the steamed roasted mushrooms as a side.For desert we had the toffee ice cream with ginger wafer that was amazing.  Great perfect dessert (although the service didn't acknowledge my birthday). The sommelier has wonderful recommendations and we got a very reasonable champagne that was remarkably perfect",2,1,2
22,Liz K.,"New York, NY",239,308,463,2.0,8/9/2017,"The experience was great but the food was beyond mediocre. The whole flow of the restaurant is superb! However, the food is lacking something... like.... it's own originality. Friend order the burger- and guess what? The ingredients and product itself comes from Five Guys. The fries, pickles, and I wouldn't be surprised if the meat and bun came from there as well.Ordered the chicken - it was tasteless. I think I could've beaten and made it myself at home.Like I said- experience is wonderful. They accommodate you to the nines. But the food is below average.",7,3,1

Lobster rolls, tuna tartare, polo house salad, fries, pea soup.  Tasted the veggie burger. Just fair. Entrees: salmon, steak cooked well.  Drinks free flowing.  Chocolate cake, ice cream sundae, frozen yogurt w berries.  All very good.  Glad we came. Great company. Fun night.",2,1,
24,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",46,15,4,2.0,1/4/2018,"While the paranoia of the man with the Ipad at the front door is off-putting, the checkin desk staff with  security radios communicating with them, and the staff downstairs are even stranger. Drinks at the bar, delightful. Delicious. Perfectly served old school style. Food downstairs, fantastic. Service, outstanding. But a team of young financial schmucks, acting like they were the wolves of Wall Street, couldn't stop swearing. Cocksucker, Fuck, Fucking, Whiz, motherfucker, it didn't matter. Rudest people I've ever seen at a restaurant anywhere in the world. The rudest pricks I've ever seen and the same security, who were obsessed by anyone's entrance, couldn't bother to deal with these people. Last time I'll ever visit.",8,9,3

The bar is comfortable and the classic Ralph Lauren designs throughout are exquisite. We were seated downstairs and Carlos provided us with impeccable service from the moment we sat down. I am a wine lover, so with the expansive wine list I had a plethora of amazing options. I chose the Impulsivo Tempranillo, which was fantastic, and my cousin chose a hand crafted cocktail that he thoroughly enjoyed. The ambience is what you would expect from an exclusive establishment. When it came to the patrons, we saw everyone from A-list celebs, to politicians. So, the people watching was a plus!Moving on to our meals, I started with the shrimp cocktail and finished with the chicken paillard, while my cousin enjoyed the crab cake and sea bass. We also added their mashed potatoes, mushrooms and asparagus to the table. Everything was delicious! If you have the chance to dine at The Polo Bar, take it! It is a memorable experience you will thoroughly enjoy.",,,1

28,Ben D.,"South Orange, NJ",74,203,1310,4.0,1/10/2018,"Reservations easier to come by then when this spot first opened a couple of years ago but the wait is worth it.  The decor and ambiance is everything you've heard and more, luckily the experience doesn't stop there.  Cocktails are well crafted so a stop at the bar before you head downstairs for your meal is the way to go.  Simple dishes executed perfectly here so start with the BLT Salad.  The corned beef sandwich has great flavor, all the succulence of pastrami, minus the fat.  Tough choice between that and the Polo Bar Burger, no wrong answers, both are great.",2,,
29,J R.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,45,25,5.0,11/14/2017,"Dear Ralph Lauren, you've won me over. Cool spot in busy midtown just off Madison Ave. Make a reservation. As you enter the restaurant you walk past a classic classy bar. Through the velvets to an elevator that will take you down stairs to the dinner room. Always busy, great for people watching, dinner and drinks. Service is always top notch here. A must stop when in the city.Came here for dinner on a Friday night. Bread and butter served will melt in your mouth. Drinks are good, +++ points for making a special request drink for us. The vegan pasta, polo burger and calamari were all delicious. Decided to split the polo burger in half and share with my date. Good thing we did. Major props to the kitchen for bringing a sliced sautéed jalapeño to the table. Once again, you have one me over Mr. Ralph Lauren.",5,,1
30,Ally B.,"Manhattan, NY",13,210,482,5.0,12/23/2017,"I was definitely impressed by this reservations only spot just off of fifth avenue.  The service was impeccable and the bartenders were experts at crafting unique cocktails.  After before dinner drinks and a few complimentary bar snacks, you proceed downstairs to the world of the polo bar.  The popovers are amazing enough that you will want to return just for another bite of one.  We loved the polo bar burger that was on special and the Ruben was good too, but the burger easily won out.  Make reservations in advance for this one of a kind experience.",1,,1
31,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",2,86,0,3.0,9/19/2018,"I would have given it four stars but for two reasons:-They kept us waiting for 30 minutes after our reservation and without much of an apology-My fish was overcookedDecor is exactly as you would expect- like you fell into Ralph Lauren's private speakeasy.  Very old New York-feeling and I love it.Bar snacks are fantastic- fried olives, freshly made potato chips, and warm mixed nuts.  Drinks are in the over-$20 category but good and come with the standard giant square ice cube.  The wines by the bottle are marked up exponentially.To eat, we had the NY strip which was $60 on our bill when the menu said $55. I'm going to guess it was because my husband substituted spinach for fries but there was no mention- verbal or written, of an up-charge for this. It was very good, but not in the ""best of"" category.  I had the special branzino which I am sad to say was dry.  It was just a simple roasted fish and there is no excuse for them to overcook it but they did.  It wasn't egregious but it was noticeable. The coconut cake special for dessert was excellent.  Our waiter was poised and professional. The clientele on this Tuesday night was mostly tourists. The food overall was good but it seems the price you are paying is mainly for the atmosphere.  From what other people have said, maybe stick with the burger or just go for drinks.",,,

The bar is a very clubby and comfortable wood paneled bar on the first floor. Lots of horse oil paintings as you'd see in a RL store - very elegant and tasteful.  Downstairs is more of the same and more softly lit and cozy, a mix of chairs and banquettes (colored like British bridle leather).  Immediately greeted.  All servers seemed genuinely friendly and all were RL tailored and attractive.  Cocktails were expertly prepared and delicious.  The food looked as good as the decor and was fresh and tasty.  Menu is fairly simple comfort food, ended up with a burger which was outstandingly delicious and juicy.

Oh no, forget the steak prices, you'll be whisked away into a magical land where money is not allowed to float to the brain until the check arrives.I've dined here with colleagues and, oh, no big deal, just sat next to AROD and Jennifer Lopez. Oh...ppffft! No big deal, guys! JK of course we got a photo.We sat at a table and honestly I have not seen anything like this scene in NYC lately. The last time might have been years ago ~5. Swanky decor but very Ralph Lauren. Sexy ambiance! The lighting has something about it that makes it not too bright and not too dark. It's perfect date night spot.The waiters are all on point and make wonderful recommendations. There was a hiccup one time that I took my sister here regarding her birthday dessert but the manager made up for it and sent a few out on the house to apologize which I appreciated.The drinks are out of this world expensive and when I say that, I want you to know that I'm not sitting at divebars drinking $2 wells all evening. I can handle paying $17 a martini however, $21, I was like oh hey now... and I really despise people who write Yelp reviews about how expensive something is but damnit, I just had to.I disgress... So we both had steaks which were just incredible. I mean, the food was very very good. Steak = on point! Drinks were great (did I mention expensive? oh yeah I did...) and I was in love with the ambiance.We made a reservation last minute so it can be done.

Dinner was then downstairs in the basement but the decor is so well done that you don't feel like it.  The tables are very close together to get maximum seating but that meant you can easily eavesdrop on the discussions around you which seems like they are too close together...The food was solid and dependable.,,,

My fiancé and I ordered two starters (lump crab and avocado, and the tuna tartare) and an entree to share, and they served everything to us already split (including the filet mignon), which was a nice touch.Service: The service was very attentive. Our waiter seemed to appear at the moment was glass was getting close to empty, and promptly after we finished each dish.Price: The wine is definitely overpriced ($17 for a glass for Paso Robles, which you can get a bottle for less at the grocery store). The steak was also pricier than other steakhouses we frequent (we live in WI), but it seemed pretty typical for how expensive most nice restaurants are in New York.I LOVED the Polo Bar, and will definitely be back next time I'm in New York.",,,

43,Kate H.,"Brooklyn, NY",411,54,46,5.0,8/15/2017,"Amazing food and drinks.  Wonderful service.  Lovely, seamless experience.  The service was really outstanding.  We didn't have anyone hovering over us, but we also we never waiting to order food, a refill on a drink or ask for extra ketchup (hehe, so elegant).   Cameron, the sommelier, was terrific and recommended excellent food and drinks.  We had such a great, relaxing time here celebrating our engagement.  Our corner table was intimate and romantic, but the feel overall isn't too stiff or formal.  Just a really nice, well-run establishment.  Also, the décor is exactly what you want and expect from Ralph Lauren.  Lots of hunter green, horse paintings, dark wood, leather and low lighting.  Food-wise- everything was so delicious.  I highly recommend Ralph's corned beef sandwich (my absolute favorite, and I don't even like corned beef normally).  The pigs in a blanket, tomato soup, and burger were also scrumptious. And of course, anything off the wine menu that Cameron suggests!We will definitely be back soon.",4,,
44,Jeffrey O.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,48,3,5.0,1/28/2018,"To those whom complain that you need a reservation just to get in the door, please go elsewhere because you don't get that their strict reservation policy is the exact reason this place is so great, imagine, needing a reservation, shocker! It's never packed when you walk in, you can sit at the bar and have drinks before sitting down.  On any given night in the city it's hard to find a decent place that isn't packed and I'm not one to stand 3 deep at a any bar for a $20+ drink. The food is great, the service great, the atmosphere is warm and lively. Make a reservation, wait for the day to arrive and go enjoy.",4,,1

46,Shanel T.,"Roosevelt, NY",75,99,409,5.0,1/22/2018,"Well .. my boyfriend decided to start our New Year off with a special dinner date, and I must say he did an amazing job! He's been planning this for a month, and getting a reservation here isn't easy. Let's start of with entrance -- they go by reservations ONLY! So, walk-ins are NOT allowed no matter who you are. The decor is absolutely stunning, very signature style of Horseback Derby. I've always loved Ralph Lauren from my teenage years, because I was raised on it. So class, and style is my thing when it comes to this distinguished label. We were greeted by the host to walk down stairs where the tables were. We were seated in the back lounge like corner booth. My boyfriend had I believe the ""Man O' War"" if I'm not mistaken (I'm sorry I cannot remember) lol.. I had the Vesper Martini which was absolutely made to perfection. We did hear the starters from our waiter Calib who was amazing from beginning to end. He told us about the starter salad for the night, the fish which was the sea-bass from what I remembered. Since I knew we were going to eat a very fulfilling meal, we skipped everything and went straight to dinner. Both my boyfriend and I got the New York strip steak. I like mine (Medium Rare) him (Medium). Calib offered three types of sauces to pair with our steaks, a bbq sauce, a garlic sauce which was similar to a chimichurri (I went with that) it was sooooo good !! It was fresh and my steak was cooked to perfection ! I have no idea what was in that garlic sauce but I did taste: vinegar, cilantro, garlic, and some other stuff but it was definitely amazing and I will definitely ask what's the ingredients next time. I Paired my steak with spinach and he paired his with the mash potatoes. Little did we forget the steak comes with fries. Which is fine, because the meal was delicious. I also paired my meal with a good ole' Manhattan and boy was that perfect! I did save room for desert, and we shared the brownie (I'm sorry guys I have no picture of the brownie) however I can describe it to you. It had walnuts inside topped with a vanilla scoop and a chocolate ring. When brought to the table the waiter poured chocolate sauce on top and my mouth was watering. Probably the reason why I couldn't snap a pic. So to sum up everything .. My man did an excellent job with making our date super special, and our waiter was superb. I cannot wait to come back here! Thank You so much for a wonderful experience Everything was superb! I can't wait to come back here",4,1,1
47,Jessica B.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",223,223,555,3.0,7/3/2018,"I had really high hopes for my meal here but was underwhelmed. I loved the bar and lounge upstairs. It was adorable and the drinks were good - had the blackberry cobbler. They serve nice bar snacks - fried olives, warm nuts and chips. Downstairs the decor was also on point. They sat us at the worst table in the restaurant which happens just not ideal. Popovers they served us were burnt and not good. We had lobster rolls to starts - this was my favorite part of the meal. Really tasty!  I got the veggie burger and my companions got a cheeseburger and a rustic burger.  Both burgers were supposed to be cooked medium rare. Only one came out medium rare. They enjoyed but didn't love the burger. I was told the veggie burger was really good and people loved it. I LOVE bread and rolls and the ratio of the burger was off to me. The bread wasn't overly fresh and I only ate half the bun which is unheard of for me!  Also not enough sauce so the whole thing was very dry. The pattie itself was quite mushy. Overall wasn't happy with my dish. Thought the whole experience would be better. Bill was much lower than I thought it would be though which was a pleasant surprise.",1,,
48,Manuel E.,"Tucson, AZ",14,19,7,5.0,10/14/2018,"This is the one of the best restaurant I've ever tried at New York! The ambient inside is really confortable the people attending you are always aware of your concerns! From the moment you walk in you receive all the attentions, for starters i got The Polo Bar Crab cake, it didn't sound appetizing at first, but when my server described it with details I decided to follow his advice, and I was really impressed! The crab cake was delicious! I had considered ordering a 2nd one, but ny main dish was about to come, again I was unsure about the main dish I wanted the prime filet mignon and the new york strip! The server again influenced on my decision so I chose the New York Strip. Again no regrets! Everything was delicious! The steak's temperature was more than perfect . Now for dessert I chose the homemade vanilla ice cream with a double espresso! What a wonderful combination! Bring your pals and family here! It's totally worth it!",,,
49,Nikita K.,"New York, NY",30,224,34,1.0,6/9/2017,"I dined here this past Sunday and although I loved the meal and experience at the time, my subsequent food poisoning turned me off of the place. Make a reservation.Decor is lovely, staff is friendly, and they will gladly accommodate any dietary restrictions. Be sure to wear a blazer (staff will remind you when making your reservation). If you do end up going - avoid the calamari (I think this is what caused the food poisoning).Otherwise, come a bit early to enjoy a cocktail before going downstairs. The restaurant is quite intimate/dimly lit, making me think its better for winter dining than the summer months (as there is a lack of windows).Wine list is plentiful as are the cocktails. Menu is essentially a steak house standard; however, they have a rotating list of specials which are worth trying.I will not likely be back, given my food poisoning.",8,1,1
50,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,185,527,4.0,12/28/2016,"4.5 stars.The service was spectacular. From the person that checks you in at the door (yes you need a reservation), to the host at the top of the stairs, to the host at the bottom of the stairs (yes there are 3 check points) to our server, everyone was truly wonderful and so attentive without being pushy.  I came here with my parents and brother on a weekday during the holidays and although we had a 9 pm reservation we were promptly seated at 8:30 when we arrived, which was a pleasant surprise (so +1).  We had drinks earlier at another bar so stuck to wine by the glass and cocktails during dinner.We shared 3 appetizers to start:Calamari. The calamari was fried nicely and the fried zucchini was delicious as well (though there was obviously more zucchini than calamari).  I preferred the pickled jalapeño tartar sauce to the roasted tomato sauce.  Tuna tartare. The tuna was very fresh and the dish was overall very flavorful (sesame seeds, avocado). The crispy bread that came on the side was delicious as well. Chopped Vegetable Salad. There was so much going on in this salad but all the flavors blended together nicely.  It had cucumber, tomatoes, avocado, asparagus, green beans, hearts of palm, radishes, black olives and feta cheese and came with a lemon dressing.For the main dish:I ordered the dover sole (without the caviar). The sauce was very creamy (I don't want to know how much butter they used) and the fish was cooked very well.  The fish didn't come with any sides though and it is the most expensive item on the menu.For the side, we shared the broccolini, which was surprisingly not bitter and went with the fish very well.Members of my family got: (1) the Polo Burger, which looked delicious, the fries were very crispy though lacking in spices and flavors, (2) the special BBQ/Pickled Jalapeño burger, which also looked great and (3) the salmon, which I didn't get to try.  For the dessert:We shared the pecan pie and the brownie.  The Pecan Pie was very sweet but was generally very good, it came served warm.  The brownie was very good as well but it came with walnuts already baked into the dough so they couldn't be removed.  While the nuts didn't overpower the brownie, I definitely prefer brownies without.We had a very nice meal here and I will be back when I have the patience to try to get another reservation.",2,1,1

52,Candace L.,"Los Angeles, CA",3014,1590,3475,5.0,11/9/2016,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a lovely dinner at The Polo Bar Sunday evening. We were staying across the street at The St Regis and this couldn't have been more convenient. I did phone 30 days in advance for a rezzie and was happy to have secured one on the date/time of my choice, since our time in town was limited. I had spent a good amount of the day running the NYC marathon and couldn't wait to tuck myself away in this gorgeous equestrian, leather and oak oasis of Ralph Lauren's. This was our first experience here and we have not been to the Paris or Chicago locations. From the moment we stepped in, through 3 separate check in's ;) we were impressed. The decor is stunning and the environment comfortable and relaxed yet undeniably chic. Our service was fantastic. I don't tend to eat red meat often but I ordered the evenings special burger from Ralph's Colorado cattle ranch (I'm sorry to all of my vegan friends, you are free to slap me now but you know how infrequently I consume beef so give me a pass this time). Honestly, as tasty as it was I only finished half because I'm not usually able to eat much in the hours following a marathon, my stomach just can't handle it. I did enjoy a lovely Cab Sauv and pigs in a blanket. The popovers were tasty, reminded me of those served at Neiman Marcus (which my grandmother and I love). My boyfriend enjoyed a steak and we skipped dessert since we had a rather large cake waiting for the two of us back at our hotel.I had the best time and it was really a perfect way to celebrate the accomplishment of the day.I'd highly recommend dining here if you're in the city and most especially if you're at the St Regis because it's only steps away.",8,4,8

56,Tasha C.,"New York, NY",13,44,1,4.0,12/11/2017,"Had my reservations but they won me over. Notoriously difficult spot to get a reservation had me thinking that the ambience would be uppity and the food mediocre.  Yes to the first, no to the second.  True to the Polo brand every square foot of space is covered with a horse or jockey photo and the wait staff trots around like you're at a steeplechase.  The crowd is decidedly and predictably WASP-y.  Since we were there for the total experience we opted for Mr. Lauren's holiday special - the $200 steak for 2 from his personal, grass-fed cattle herd from his Telluride, CO ranch.  Being a (self-proclaimed) foody and frequent guest at various NYC steak establishments (P. Luger, Spark, Del Friscos, etc.) I have to be honest: Ralph's steak held its own and deserves a spot with the other NYC steakhouses.  Read some of the other reviews, and yeah - if you're getting the chicken dish or something that is, by its nature - bland, then chances are it's going to be mediocre.  Go big or go home.  Also, they brought out complimentary bites of their famed corned beef sandwich (spectacular!).Only ding on why its not 5 stars is thought they could have done better with the sides.  The silver dollar potatoes was legit but the spinach was too salty for my taste, and if I'm paying $200 the greens should hold their own.",1,2,

I had the black bass which was amazing. My friend had the filet mignon which was just as good. For apps, we shared half a dozen oysters and shrimp cocktail. Shrimp was SO good. One of my favorites and freshest I'd have to say. Our server was exceptional. Note: You can't go to the bar just to have a drink. You have to have a table reservation to be able to have a drink at the  bar. This is confirmed by a host/hostess in front of the door before you can enter the bar. After you check-in with the front hostess you go to the back hostess and they will seat  you at the main dining which in at  the lower level(which you take an elevator down to).",2,,2

Updated review","A quick update - I have been able to call the day of to see if there has been a cancellation and was able to snuck in a table for 2 for dinner around 8:30. The place slightly clears out at 8:30 and starts the 2nd seating and until 9:30 I saw people coming in and the place is packed every night during the week and on weekends.The classic burger and their special burger are ALWAYS perfectly done to my liking with fresh fries (they say you don't change the winning horse right? no pun intended....). I would say though, if you are a party of two and are both getting burgers, you almost don't need a starter. We are always OVERLY full when we order a starter with our burgers. But if you must, the crabcake and the pig in a blanket (tiny hot dogs) are delicious!The $18/glass of Merlot from Long Island (what??) is surprisingly good and their fuller body wines at a higher price are of course way more delicious :)",2,3,4

Pros: bar waiting area gives you cute appetizers like fried olives and toasted nuts to snack on while waiting for a table, AMAZING decor and atmosphere, good service and a relaxed dinner that didn't feel rushed. The cocktails were excellent and they also had a good wine list. Only con is that the food wasn't outstanding for the price but it was still very good. This is Ralph Lauren's signature restaurant so it's worth it if only experience that part. :)",,,

We arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation to get drinks before dinner and hang out at the bar. We had corn beef sliders which were phenomenal. The food here is very American which isn't always my favorite but it's just done so well at The Polo Bar. We had burgers for dinner and caviar for dinner. Caviar starter was so good. It was filling but fresh at the same time with potato, creme fresh and caviar. My hubs had the Tex mex burger and I had the Polo Bar burger. Both very good!!! We split the sundae but regretted saying hold the nuts please. Service at the bar and in the restaurant was attentive and fast even on a busy weekend night.",4,,

We ordered a 44 oz ribeye and some sides, the steak was good (took a bit long to get but was well worth the wait) the roasted beet salad was good, the sliders were really good and so were the coffee and desserts...Really nice place and highly recommend.",1,,

I had made reservations about 2 weeks in advance for a Tuesday evening. The day of...we were running late and I called to make sure they would still be able to accommodate. They have a 15 minute grace period, but I knew I would be even more late. When I called the second time to let them know I would be about 30 mins late, they made arrangements with the maitre d to hold our table.

While the food was gorgeous, atmosphere inside and the frequency you gotta come across with celebrities were better reasons for making it so famous (and so difficult to secure a table).We shared the crab cake and pig (sausage) with blanket. Both were great start to our dinner. The honey mustard dipping sauce definitely made the sausage less greasy yet more flavorful. The ribeye  was highlight of the night. Cooked medium rare, the meat was extremely juicy and tender. Do not throw away the roasted garlic on the side!Dessert was very disappointing, unfortunately. Coffee ice cream was close to melting and the chocolate cake was way too solid. My suggestion is to skip dessert.

69,Jessica W.,"Los Angeles, CA",528,126,546,5.0,1/13/2017,"If you like old-school vibes in immaculate new-school settings, the Polo Bar is the place for you. They've capitalized on the Ralph Lauren brand in the most classic ways. Polo art, lavishly framed horse paintings, etc etc etc. It's very old-world yet classy and au-currant. The booths off to the side are where I like to sit but I'm sure there's not a bad table in the house because the service is spectacular and the decor is consistent. You're checked in by the host at the end of the bar upstairs (very cool bar by the way) and then checked in again at the bottom of the stairs. Everyone is happy to see you and from the hosts to the servers they go out of their way to provide impeccable service. I've had the The Polo Bar Salad (Greens, Avocado, Tomatoes, Cucumber & Shaved Radishes with Mustard Vinaigrette) (Yum),  the Kale Salad (which I got without the Pecorino) and the Veggie Burger (which is amazing). But on this recent visit I had their Veggie Chili which was SOOOOOOOO good and the Brussels Sprout Salad which was delish! (My mom got the Chicken Paillard - shown in photo and she loved it.) I was such a cow, that I wolfed down my chili--totally forgetting my responsibility to you, my dear Yelp friends, and our server took pity on me and brought me a new plate and bowl of chili just so I could take a nice photo to indulge my Yelp habit. (I DO THIS FOR YOU, PEOPLE!) Now, that is service. Him, not me.Though, me too, if we're being honest. I love that they have a vegetarian/vegan menu for people like me but they have plenty of top notch menu items for those who indulge. (Which is most of you.)Run, don't walk to The Polo Bar the next time you want a fun, elegant evening out. But don't forget to make a reservation. This isn't your mother's kitchen, you can't just walk in.",20,15,20

The rich wood panelled environment with the equestrian theme is very relaxing & well done. As we left, it was raining and Armando offered to walk is one block to our hotel with umbrellas. That was above & beyond any hospitality we ever expected. Thank you for a wonderful meal and for the royal treatment!",1,,

Great chat and snacks with Hernon, Anthony, and Braxton (spelling?) at the bar. Tanner and two ridiculously pretty girls whose names escape me, hooked me up downstairs at a cozy nook perfect for one. Loved people watching, very friendly and polite crowd I'd say. Art took such good care of me. Kept me fed, watered, and caffeinated. Mentioned off hand that it was my birthday.Intercepted upon departure by Anthony and Hernon who had a special birthday drink waiting for me. Made my birthday so special. 10/10 Hospitality.",,,
80,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,582,505,4.0,2/1/2016,"I wanted to try the Polo Bar for a while, and planned a dinner with a friend for this past Saturday night. I called exactly 1 month in advance to make the reservation, and when I finally got through 40 minutes later, they only had 5, 5:30, or 10pm tables. We chose the 5:30, which worked out fine during the winter, since it was dark out. The largest party size is 4 people.The setting was fantastic. Very cozy, plaid pillows, a warm glowing mahogany brass feeling. Again, a perfect spot for mid-winter. I love that they offer an elevator in lieu of the staircase when you enter the restaurant on the lower level. It's thoughtful for both older patrons and those of us who chose to wear our best looking pair of high heels for the evening. The entire staff, from the trench coat clad bouncer to the hosts and waitresses were supremely professional and well-trained. Service was truly exemplary.My friend and I chose to share some Kumamoto oysters and clams oreganata to start. The oysters were perfect, although the mignonette maybe had just a few too many minced shallots for my own personal taste. The clams were delicious too, but the breading was a little charred on a few.For my main course, I went with the burger, which was cooked perfectly, and so tasty. The special sauce was great, and I love that bacon is a standard accoutrement. Overall, I was really impressed with Polo Bar, and if it wasn't so damn hard to get a reservation, I would love to return.",3,,1

A strict reservation only policy unless, you're a big Baller you can walk in anytime (I am not by the way, and was turned away at the door on my first attempt). But the bar is for me, where most of the charme happens. The food is not bad but when considering how expensive it is a little bad maybe. Drinks are impeccable, service is good. Would I come here again... yes. For drinks and cocktails only. Apparently even for the bar you will need a reservation.",,,1

At 9:05 we asked for our table and the hostess said when your party is all here. At 9:06 our party was ""all here"" (God forbid they sat a 4top with only 3!!), the hostess said 5 minutes. At 9:30, we were still waiting at the bar, and asked again, about our table. Hostess said 5 minutes, as we watched her walk 4 customers from outside to a table. At 9:40 we asked again and she said they are setting up our table. Finally we all got up from the bar and the hostess said she can seat us now.Yes, we are nobodies, but our credit cards work just as well as the somebodies.",8,5,2
88,Ray K.,"San Jose, CA",5,116,92,4.0,12/15/2016,"4.5 starsAs the previous reviewers mentioned, you need a reservation to get in and to get that reso you most likely need to know someone or luck out with an early time which seems to be the safest but scarce way. 3 different check-points before getting seated,  3!The service and overall ambiance of the place is spot on. My cousin's husband helped with the opening and it seems that Mr. Lauren was very particular with all the details and it shows, even down to the salt & pepper grinder/shakers (which were the heaviest I've ever felt). All the workers were extremely attentive and the coziness of the place made me forget about the single digit temperatures outside. Foooooooduh:Amuse-bouche of the corned beef sammy but served in tiny bite-sized versions were very tasty, almost enough to tempt me to order the entree size but resisted. Half-dozen oysters - they had Kumamotos (one of my favs) and I forget the other. All were very fresh and served with a cocktail and mignonette sauces. Tuna tartare was very good. The toasted bread that it was served with was almost as good as the tuna itself, definitely worth ordering. Veal Milanese  - perhaps the best veal I've ever had. I've never had a veal so juicy and the crust had the perfect balance of crunch with great flavoring. I also stole a couple bites of both the polo and portobello burgers from my wife and cousin and they were both very good. I would recommend the portobello if you like rich flavors (truffles galore in this one). The polo burger was more of your standard American burger with top notch ingredients.All in all it was a great experience and as another yelper mentioned, this place is a celebrity sighting hot-spot. Literally had Reese Witherspoon walk right by me and I almost didn't realize. Also saw a celebrity food network chef there that my wife recognized and also heard that Hilary Clinton and RL were in the night before. Would definitely come back if we can secure another table!",1,1,
89,Pearce D.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,173,489,4.0,11/13/2015,"Yes it's a pain to get a reservation, yes it is expensive, and yes, the food is not mind-blowing. But it is a scene worth checking out. Starting with cocktails at the bar, the experience is top notch and you really do feel transported to a different world. Once downstairs in the dining room, it's cozy and not overly pretentious. Celebs are probably a common occurrence as the night I went (a Thursday) my party saw Cuba Gooding Jr., Christopher Lloyd, Kelly Rutherford and Ralph Lauren himself. As for the food, the pigs in a blanket and tuna tartare were good, not great. The burger was above average but there are better in NYC. Salmon and roast chicken were also good, but if you're only about the food, then Polo Bar is probably not worth your time and money.",3,,

93,Charly B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/23/2018,"Possibly the most overrated and overpriced restaurant in nyc. Was looking forward to dinner with my grandfather here all week. He had run many successful fashion brands throughout his life and I had been keen to try it out with him. Firstly the attitude of our waitress (Madison) was shocking. She actually put her hand out to  his face to indicate 'stop' and 'quiet' to him when he asked if she could take his menu while she turned to me for my order. I have never seen that done to an 88 year old gentleman (or any age) in my entire life. Then proceeded to shout at me that she couldn't hear me when I tried to order. The dinner continued on this way.  Very curt, downright rude. I mentioned this to the manager who was very apologetic and offered to let us move tables after our starter but she never came back to follow up. It was just a noisy, awful experience. The food was fine but blanketed by the terrible service. I just kept apologizing to my grandfather all night for bringing him here. I guess this is a fashion restaurant and possibly enjoyable for tourists. Not for New Yorkers who know where to get beautiful service and quality dinners.",,,
94,Allison K.,"Lexington, KY",0,19,0,3.0,4/13/2017,"You HAVE to have reservations. You are allowed to arrive 30 mins early to enjoy the upstairs bar. If your reservation is at 5pm, do not arrive before that time, as they will not open the doors for you. The hostess I made reservations with over the phone failed to mention this. The Polo Bar is a five star environment. It's decked with rich leather, stunning bold plaids, and beautiful equestrian art work. The drinks are five stars, as well. I had gin on the rocks with fresh lime, and it was superb. The first time we visited, our food was wonderful. We ordered a burger and the salmon. The second time we visited (just last week), I was not impressed with my food at all. My filet was ordered medium, however, it was completely charred on the outside, so much so that it actually tasted burnt. The spinach I ordered was flavorless and VERY soggy. My fiancé stuck with his original order, the burger, and was pleased with his meal. Our ticket was $300 though, for two meals and 4 drinks + tip, so be prepared to dish out quite a bit of cash for a meal that isn't as high quality as what you might expect.",3,1,1

97,Michel R.,"Arlington, VA",131,13,1,2.0,3/16/2017,"***Before I begin the 2 star rating is mainly derived from the food, everything else was fantastic! 5 Stars easily! But the food is the most important part. Right??***Getting into this restaurant was difficult.  Had to call exactly 1 month in advance to reserve spots and even after calling 72 times (yes exactly 72 times) I managed to get the last reservation slot available.....geez.  I've heard of this place through the grapevine and decided to try it.  However, I must admit the difficulty to get in is what attracted me most.So once you arrive, you are presented a beautiful restaurant!  Décor is tastefully splattered everywhere.  The coolest thing is that once you check in at the front, he would radio to someone, and from that point everyone knows who you are by name. So, we check in and stood to the side for a few mins as our table was ready quite quickly.  A gentlemen came and said ""Welcome Michel, Please follow me."" He took us to a flight of stairs leading down. He says, ""Just head right down stairs and they will take care of you."" As we walk downstairs, I hear the guy as he walks away saying on a little radio, ""Michel  is coming downstairs.""Once we get downstairs we are greeted again by name and take us our seats.  That initial first impression is incredible and makes you feel so exclusive and just simply cool. Now after this great start, it starts to become sort of a mixed bag. The first downside is that the table are very close to each other and you can hear convos all around you quite clearly so its a little awkward to talk sometimes. The second is the reason you come in the first place, the food. The food is just maybe ok. I order the steak and my gf, the salmon. The steak, while cooked properly, lacked flavor, spice, and everything nice.  It was just a steak. The salmon followed the same pattern. It was just salmon. Pricey food that was just barely ok.  Not worth it.Unfortunely, these shortcomings will prevent me from ever coming back to this place.However, I must note that the service here is immaculate. The best service I've ever had at any restaurant ever. Everything was very prompt. And I mean very prompt and very organized. I never had to ask for anything. As soon as I ran out of water, someone filled it up. If my napkin looks a little too messy, it was immediately replaced. It feels like there is a wait staff for each, individual person.  The coolest thing was when we were done eating and the waiter came over to ask about dessert.  He would grab our dirty and while still talking to us, stick his hand over to the side and someone just grabs them, all without breaking eye contact. Then someone would swoop in and clean up any crumbs leftover.  It was so weirdly cool.",3,4,1

99,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4580,1590,1642,5.0,4/19/2016,"The Polo Bar is one of the most fabulous restaurants in New York. Located in midtown, you enter through a bar on the street level and the restaurant is downstairs. The atmosphere is classically Ralph Lauren. Dark woods, frames filled with portraits of horses and their riders, and the faint smell of polo cologne make you feel as though you've landed at a friends house in the countryside. Start with a drink at the bar. They have a short list of cocktails that are all well executed. I like to start with a glass of champagne before heading downstairs for dinner. Moments after sitting at your table for dinner, a delightful popover arrives on your bread plate. It's warm, cheesy and accompanied by a little dish of butter. It's hard not to dig into it right away, so I usually do just that. I like to order appetizers family style. A few of the things I've enjoyed are the tuna tartare, crab cakes, white asparagus and pigs in a blanket. For mains, the veal milanese is unbelievable. It's a huge portion that could easily be shared, but generally people want it all to themselves, as it is so divine. Lightly breaded and fried, it's topped with a salad of greens and onions with a lemon wedge. The salmon is a splendid medium-rare with a sinfully rich butter sauce. I like to ask for extra sauce on the side. The seasonal halibut was perfectly moist and flakey.  The branzino was a touch too dry the last time I had it. The apple pie for dessert was a classic a la mode and the brownie is topped with warm hot fudge table side. Service is always wonderful and it always feels like a celebration at the Polo Bar.",38,16,25
100,Alexa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",244,14,16,5.0,5/17/2017,"Amazing as always! When you arrive you have 15minutes to enjoy the bar if you'd like- which is always fun. It is always packed and the drinks are alright. I always get a glass of champagne because last time I had the moscow mule it was too strong for my taste. You can also order small bites such as shrimp and pigs in a blanket which are amazing!!For dinner I have gotten both the Branzino and Salmon. Quite personally I recommend the Salmon more as it is a bigger portion. With the branzino definitely order a side because you'll end up being a little hungry. Their burger and french fries are truly the best- so if you want to indulge please do!The service is fantastic and the waiters are always there when you need it. The hardest part is getting a reservation, but once done everyone is very kind and gives you a lot of attention.

The service is elite and the whole staff is trained very well and is one of the best serviced places I have been to.  Must try their crab cakes for starters and I highly recommend the Polo bar burger and Ralph's Corn Beef Sandwich.

They did an excellent job with an undesirable (basement) location, so much so that I didn't even get claustrophobic due to the lack of any windows (and I get claustrophobic easily). It may have been the Vodka. Okay, it was probably the Vodka, but whatever. I had the Chopped Salad and the Veal Milanese. Both were excellent and I highly recommend. The salad was a tad expensive for what it was, but I didn't care because it was delicious. The veal is also served with salad, so perhaps poor ordering by me, but I would have liked a starch with it.

118,Jason C.,"New York, NY",24,161,33,5.0,2/2/2016,"The Polo Bar is so much fun.  I'll break this review down into three areas:1. The decor, ambiance, mood:As you might expect from the Ralph Lauren brand, the restaurant is designed to a T.  I would liken the interior to that of a old East Coast or Palm Beach supper club. Well at least the way you envision one, in realty they're not nearly as nice as this restaurant.  The place is camera ready and looks good enough to double as a movie set or special exhibit at a museum.  There's a lot of saddle leather, tartan and warm woods.  Even the bathrooms are remarkable with green stone, marble and brass fixtures.2. The service:The service is excellent--among the best I've experienced anywhere, very on-point. There's a flow to the service that you can subtly notice.  One is sort of gently guided through the restaurant upon arrival.  First from the doormen, then over the course of an hour or so in our case, to the bar, to the maitre d', downstairs and to our table.  The service staff is very personable and tries to get to know you and what you like. 3. The food.I've dined here 5 times and the food has been impeccable and consistent each time.  Each of the 5 times my wife has had the veggie burger.  It's her favorite in town.  If you're a vegan, vegetarian or just in general a healthier eater, there are many options.  There's a vegetarian menu in fact.  Each of the times I've dined here I've eaten at the the other end of the spectrum and had roasted chicken, wild salmon and the filet mignon.  All have been perfect.  All of the starters, soups and salads we've tried have been great too.I don't find making reservations here too duanting, but having dined here a few times it would be nice if that got me some acknowledgement or better/quicker options for a reservation.",2,1,
119,Lara P.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,33,25,5.0,3/4/2016,"Beauty and Perfection.Came here for girls night out and it did not disappoint. We had the 10pm reservation but that's alright because the place was packed. I love that they only allow patrons who have reservations otherwise there would never be any space at this beautiful bar.  The dining room downstairs has a great ambiance with leather seats and paintings on the wall. Not stuffy like some other places I've been.I had the old fashioned with Rye as my bartender Robert recommended and it was delish. All the staff had great knowledge about the drinks and menu, service was top notch.I ordered the filet mignon because I couldn't help but indulge myself, knowing I could never finish it. Well I did finish it because it was that good. The onion rings that came with were...out of this world!! My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they brought out an entire menu for her, which was pretty impressive.Always make room for desserts ladies! We ordered the super decadent chocolate cake and ice cream, yumm! Would definitely come back here with my husband.",1,,1
120,Cuppy E.,"Long Island, NY",33,190,568,4.0,11/19/2016,"I was so excited to come here. My fiancé and I decided to try The Polo Bar for dinner. This is an upscale/elegant casual bar serving great tasting food at high prices. I love the menu. It has something for everyone. First and foremost, if you don't have a reservation or know someone, you are not getting in. Two women were denied entry as I was walking in. I was met by a cute, well-dressed gentleman with an iPad in hand who verified my reservation. I was then greeted by a hostess near the bar area who again checked my reservation. I was offered a seat at the bar to wait for my fiancé but I chose to wait for him in the dining room. Due to the congestion, barricades and protesters in and around Midtown and Trump Tower, we were running a tad bit late. If you come here, plan well in advance, take the subway or walk, or else you will have to endure hellish traffic conditions in this area.The bar area is upstairs while the actual restaurant is downstairs. You can either take the elevator or use the stairs. I took the elevator as I had on a pair of high heels that are particularly tricky to walk in. The restrooms and coat check are downstairs as well. The dress code is smart dressy. I wanted to wear a Ralph Lauren designed outfit but sadly, I can no longer fit into this particular skirt that was purchased a few years ago :( I had to go with another designer. Once you are led to your seat, you will notice the striking decor of rich mahogany hued leather banquettes, plush tartan green plaid pillows, perfect lighting and several portraits of horses and polo players. It was so comfy and cozy inside. I didn't want to leave.On to the most important part: the food. I ordered the crab cake as an appetizer and the corned beef Reuben for my entree. The crab cake was outstanding but the sandwich was the best sandwich I have ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and had great flavor. The marble rye was well toasted and the whole grain mustard took it to another level. This is a must-order. It comes with coleslaw and your choice of a side salad or fries. I chose the fries and they were fantastic. I forgot to take pictures of the fries. My fiancé went with the kale salad and the roasted chicken. The chicken was wonderfully seasoned with herbs and spices. It was great. I need that recipe. The mashed potatoes were silky smooth and came with a great tasting gravy on the side. I was stuffed at this point but I soldiered on and ordered the Polo Bar Brownie. This was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. Another must-order. It was so good. Walnuts, a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. The brownie was made with a rich dark chocolate and the server drizzled an amazing chocolate sauce on top, making it extra chocolatey.Service was great. Our server was right there and anticipated my every need. The cocktails here are amazing and they use high-quality ingredients in everything that is put in front of you. They have tons of staff making sure that everything runs smoothly. They weren't all standing around like at most places. They all appeared to be busy. This place must cost an arm and a leg to operate. Ralph Lauren did a wonderful job with his latest restaurant. From the restrooms, to the decor, staff, down to the menu. Job well done.",7,1,2
121,Courtney D.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",4,36,0,5.0,3/4/2018,"A preppy young man at the door will ask you, before you can enter the bar, if you have a reservation, and whether you intend to eat dinner. We didn't have a reservation but were deferential and were let in, and were asked to go downstairs for a table. Be sure to peek into the small, cozy, banquette-cornered fireplace study off of the ground-floor bar. Downstairs, more beautiful honey-colored woodwork on the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Every table was taken, with elegant patrons, many eating the famed Polo burger with fries. The menu is simply classic dishes that everyone likes (even an amazing-looking version of pigs-in-blankets--see? old school!). For example, the desserts were exalted versions of chocolate layer cake, ice cream sundaes (with house-made salted caramel ice cream and Ralph's caramel popcorn), cheesecake, sticky toffee pudding with rum ice cream, walnut brittle and toffee sauce, coffee ice cream with dark chocolate shortbread (and also coconut sorbet if you're vegan). My grilled fish and his burger were perfect and so was the service. By the way, there were great vegetarian and vegan options, and I even had gluten-free grilled 'bread' with olive oil with my meal, which most restaurants don't offer. Fantastic experience all around. Highly recommend it.",,,

Updated review","K. Made a reservation this time, 1 month in advance. Eye roll.But wow. I don't know what was better, the service or the food.Even if you are just sitting at the bar, you are formally greeted with warm-yes, warm-freshly prepared and seasoned nuts, potato chips, and fried olives. They had me with just that alone.But the lavishing continued. The bread that they place INDIVIDUALLY on everyone's side plate was made out of some sort of holy ingredients. No one was speaking for a good 5 minutes-it was that good. And please, if you do anything while you're here, order Ralph's coffee ice cream in the end. It'll knock your socks off, and I don't even like ice cream.",,,
124,Renato N.,"Manhattan, NY",7,61,44,4.0,7/29/2017,I stayed at the bar and found this place great. Service on point and good drinks. Compact snack list but does the job perfectly. They also serve their corned beef sandwich as a snack on the bar - highly recommended. Pricey on the other hand,,,
125,Eric S.,"Ventnor City, NJ",87,27,0,2.0,8/5/2017,"We had dinner this evening for the first time. We were very excited. It is a cute place with a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the service and with the food. Our salads were delivered to the wrong members of our party. The chopped salad has fresh vegetables but no flavor. Our food was not cooked and was basically raw fish. If we wanted raw fish we would have ordered sushi. I will say that our drinks were very good and I would definitely recommend this place for drinks and dessert. Dinner, not so much.",,,

For this, the manager gifted us with drinks on the house. Our waiter, was so nice and personable! I was expecting the food to be wonderful, in which it was, but I loved interacting with the staff.

Not much to say here the food was perfect the service was amazing. The ribeye wasn't as good as the ny strip but both were great. As for prices I would say they are reasonable for the location and the name of the place The only negative thing worth mentioning is that reservations are required and can sometimes be a couple of weeks away so plan accordingly,3,2,2

133,Meera A.,"Fairfax, VA",286,180,33,5.0,7/5/2015,"I'm in awe with the 1 star reviews. Everyone is complaining about not being able to make reservations-- this restaurant belongs to Ralph Lauren, why would you ever think you can walk in or get reservations a day or two before? I'm literally laughing out loud. I called three days before and they told me they didn't have availability but the lady was kind enough to tell me when a good time is to call back. So I called the next day around 5pm and was told they had a reservation available at 5pm on Friday. I don't eat dinner early and never at 5-- but I took it because I know how pristine and upscale this restaurant is.From the moment we arrived outside, until we went inside and down the stairs the customer service was great. Everyone that worked there was dressed beautifully, just like I'd imagined them to. Our waiter was very helpful and very patient with us. We ended up ordering the polo burger and the grilled lobster salad. Both to die for!!The place was immaculate--bathrooms beautifully decorated--extremely high etiquette flourished the place; it was the meaning of class.I recommended this place to everyone- it is just a beautiful experience!",7,2,4
134,Joann C.,"Huntington, NY",41,7,1,1.0,6/28/2016,So I have never wrote a negative review but I also have never been treated so poorly by a reservationist So I made a reservation for Monday June 27th by phone we get to the restaurant there is a man with a list we give him our name walk in to check in and was greeted by a less than friendly man he said there is no reservation it's not until July ok things happen we say ok well there has been a mistake can you fit us in he is less than accommodating and tells us to sit at the bar and he will get us inThe server in the bar was amazing however over an hour goes by and he doesn't even look at us let alone come over and give an update l only eat in great restaurants many better than The  polo bar And have never encountered such treatment I expect more from a Ralph Lauren establishment someone needs to remind them bad behavior is out of style,4,5,1

136,Whitnee N.,"Flushing, NY",1,3,1,5.0,7/24/2016,"Made a same day reservation around 10:30pm. This was our first time and loved it!!! Amazing service! From the door to the host stands to our seats, there wasn't a time we weren't greeted without a smile. Very welcoming! Then our server Alexandra, she was super friendly and super fun. Gave us suggestions even if we already knew what we wanted...ordered The crab cake to share for starter, the moisture of the crab cake was perfectly done with the the crispness of its outside! Yummmmm!!...then my date and I both ordered the Polo Bar Burger, both no fries. I got a side of brussel sprouts and he got a side of the sautéed spinach. As an extra entrée, he ordered the roasted chicken with a side of mash potatoes. I must agree with the hype about the Polo Burger. Patty done medium rare with a slice of melted American cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onions and bacon on toasted sesame buns. Definitely a must try! And for dessert we shared the coffee ice cream. Very fancy ambiance with sophisticated decors. Great for dates. Maybe even business meetings, considering the location being in the heart of the city. If you don't mind spending over $20 on a burger, dressing/suiting up, specially if you're a fan of the brand...this place should be on your list of go to's!",3,1,1
137,Joe B.,"Westport, CT",3,52,1,3.0,5/28/2016,"I think a great majority of hype with this restaurant is the difficulty of securing reservations and the cloak and dagger style of how you need to check in at the door before being allowed to enter and how you ultimately are transitioned from the bar area to the dining room. Because once you are actually seated in a warm and beautifully appointed room, you are left with mediocre food and an experience predicated on the quality and personality of your server. I have been to this restaurant a handful of times and the ultimately determining factor of my enjoyment of the evening becomes my server. Some are extremely friendly and engaging and some like last night, a complete dud. Considering the angst one needs to go through with the reservation process as well as before you are actually able to step foot into the dining room, I can strongly recommend that there are much better uses of your time and dining dollars. Because in the end you are being served a mediocre meal and if the engagement of the server is the determining factor in ones experience in a restaurant, I would ultimately deem that experience a failure. In this case the emperor has no clothes, but it does everything possible to make that hard to see.",8,4,
138,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",50,140,439,1.0,3/31/2017,"So sad, I was told we would be able to get in earlier than our 10:30pm reservation and although I contacted he restaurant many times and spoke to Alicia, the front guard hostess, and Frank Furino, manager, who assured me that we would get seated earlier, but that didn't happen. Still waiting and closer to our 10:30pm reservation but nobody moved. The problem that bothers me most is that Frank did not care. He did not care about us being pissed off about waiting close to 2 hours in the bar for our reservation although many 2-person tables came and left. It's called seating people when tables are open. Instead, was this snooty establishment prefers the look more red-roped that grace us with better customer service. I've dined here 5x before and it gets stuffier and stuffer every time. So sad. There are open tables but they'd rather be too preppy and snotty about it. Considering giving it 2 stars or even 3 because the food is so good but just can't get past the pretentious manager, Frank. He could have accommodated us especially since there were at least 3 open tables.",2,,

142,Leney P.,"New York, NY",1,151,0,5.0,12/5/2017,"When a friend from out of town told me they had made reservations for us, I was unsure. Really? This place? I was skeptical.Well, I was wrong. To even drink at the bar, you have to have dinner reservations. There are about 5 security checkpoints where attendants dressed as equestrians check your reservation and lead you to your table/downstairs, etc. I recommend arriving 30-45 minutes early to get a drink at the bar. When your drink arrives, it comes with a ""bar snack"" platter that is actually to die for. Fried olives (amazing), homemade chips (amazing) and a mixed nut cluster. It was all incredible.When it's time for your reservation, you'll be led downstairs to your table (after being passed off to more hosts and hostesses). The complimentary bread is amazing - it's like a cheese, garlic goodness roll. Incredible. The food was all very good, but the portions are on the smaller side. The food items are super original, nor are they meant to be. There's some article where Ralph Lauren said he just wanted to do the classics, and these are that, so I won't judge this place for originality or innovation. But they do it well. The interior decor is a serious treat!",,,

We all tried the Polo Bar Spring Punch and it did not disappoint (as we kept drinking them as the night went on).  As we waited for our table we snacked on the complimentary bar snacks, which were some of the best I've probably ever had (homemade potato chips, fried olives, and delicious mixed nuts). Once our table was ready we were whisked downstairs. Our party got three appetizers to start - the crab cakes, the oysters, and the pigs in a blanket. The crab cake was delicious and different than I have had in the past - maybe it was the mustard bell pepper sauce. Oysters were standard but also very good. And lastly the pigs in a blanket were amazing - I was happy that I was able to snag 2! For dinner two of my party got the veal chop and it was amazing. It's a veal chop but it's almost like a veal schnitzel. I got the filet mignon and it was shockingly one of the better steaks I have had in awhile - coming from someone who goes to high end steakhouses all the time for work events. I don't know if the piece of meat was marinating in butter for days but it was so good! I would definitely get that again. Another person got the Chicken Paillard and she said it was ok but nothing spectacular. Sides - mashed potatoes, fries, and spinach. All standard.

Dinner, I had the Chicken Paillard and my husband had the other chicken dish (1/2 a chicken) with mashed potatoes.  It was so good.  Desert we had the apple pie, a scoop of their coffee ice cream and pecan pie.  It was an old school place that served old school food with their own new school kick.

All employees were friendly and unpretentious, lovely.  Food was great!  My NY strip was perfect, apple pie to die for.  The Ralph's coffee was good too!   Nothing was fancy, but what's wrong w great mashed potatoes?  They are, after all, a signature at Joel Rubochon.  And all for well under $300!!  We'll be back.  Thanks to our server Chiara who was perfect.",5,4,3

Beautiful lighting and furnishing .Waiter was very fun and accommodating. He made our experiences a great one. We ordered two different types of burger with fries and asparagus . Everything was delicious. They also do have vegetarian menu if you are vegetarian . I even liked their bathroom which is furnished in heavy green doors. Beautiful place, great service , and great food. Moderately priced . Will return again soon .",2,,2
159,Travis L.,"ELMHURST, NY",41,54,65,5.0,2/9/2015,"I came here with my girlfriend, sister and friends for my birthday dinner. Make sure you make reservations, there aren't any walk-ins for dinner. At first I had the expctation of this place being real bougy but i was mistaken. My expectations were exceeded. Everything from the coat check to the food was AMAZING!Our server Joshua was very informative about the menu and drinks. His knowledge was important when ordering for some of my friends. He recommended their moscow Mule which was delightful and hit the spot with what I had for dinner.  I had the Salmon well done which at first I was hesistant because when you order any protein well done it comes out dry but I figured I'd give it a try and see if their chef is up for the task of not drying out my fish. My salmon came out PERFECT. The top was crusted and charred a litttle and the inside was immaculate. Hands down the best Salmon I ever had including my own. Highly recommended for any pesco vegetarians out there.My sister and girlfriend has the roasted chicken with a puree of mash potaties, chicken jus and spinach. The chicken was superb, very moist and flavorful but not too overpowering. The puree and spinach were exceptional. My friend had the filot minon 8oz and although I didn't try it, it looked well cooked and tasted even better accorind to him.I don't ever order dessert but i had to try it out because the food was delicious. All of us ordered different desserts so we can try one anothers, lol.  I had the pecan pie, my sister had the apple pie with homemade ice cream, my girlfriend had the dark chocolate brownie with their home made ice cream and my friend had the peanut butter and chocolate tart. All of the desserts tasted great. I recommend ordering coffee to wash it all down.Overall the experience, vibe, and food were amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a true love for quality food. I'll definetely be visiting again.",5,1,3

Called to try to add one more person to a party of three, was denied twice, claiming they were fully booked. Such an embarrassment when we arrived to a table set for four. The food was average, nothing special. The crab cake was unique but too greasy. The veal chop, was overloaded with breadcrumbs such that you couldn't taste the veal. The other dishes ordered were ok. The service was overly keen in a tacky way with awkward jokes. The decor was nice but this isn't a place to return to.",3,,

Really good kale salad, too.My wife really like her watermelon salad and her branzino entree. The pigs in a blanket were good - but five for $14 was a little steep for me! Here's the deal - yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for: great ambiance and very good food just off 5th Avenue. The corned beef sandwich was perfectly toasted, with a wonderfully satisfying blend of really really good meat and melted cheese. The waiter said it would be life changing - it was definitely awesome and huge. I couldn't finish it! It's extremely difficult to get in here. We were lucky because our friend knew someone. The waiter tells us that they rate their curtained after the meal, and that can help you get another Rez if you are appropriately rated by them! Very interesting.Oh, the brownie desert was excellent as well!",,,
163,Moses A.,"Middleton, WI",2,69,120,2.0,8/11/2017,"The Polo Bar is very, very busy and just as noisy. If you have a starter, pass on the crab cake, which lacks seasoning and flavor.  If you stumble upon the swordfish special, go for it; it's tender and beautifully cooked. The branzino is a standard menu staple, and it's simply an excellent choice. The beef tenderloin, when ordered medium well, arrives just a little past well done, but you get a big knife to saw through it.  If you try the charred broccolini, you'll be sorry you ever did; they're bone dry, and either prepared a couple of hours prior or sitting on a counter somewhere for a while; mine, in any event, were not even slightly warm when they arrived. If you do send them back and you're asked why, don't answer. The waiter (if you win the lottery and get Michael H) will argue with you, and will point out that you're wrong on every point you make, making you wonder why he even asked. Of course when you argue with a customer, whether you win or lose you lose. The customer goes home disappointed, but he remembers your name and you're stuck with a 2 star review for food of inconsistent quality and poor service. (Don't hold this against Ralph's, the exquisite RL restaurant in Paris, or Ralph Lauren, the great RL restaurant in Chicago. They're both worth the trip!)",1,,

It is as super easy and quick, and the reservationist was super friendly and helpful. On the day of our reservation, we came about 45 minutes early so I was told to have a seat in the bar, enjoy a drink and we would be called when our table was ready. The bar area was very beautiful. It was pure Americana. They served us homemade chips, hot assorted nuts, and fried olives which were delicious. They then called us for dinner downstairs. That area was beautiful as well. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was great as well. The part I thought was the coolest was when the wait staff would come by with a little scrapper and remove any crumbs on the table, lol. Overall, it was a great place to eat.",1,,

I can't believe how much we enjoyed it.  Greeted at the door and came in thru the chic bar.  We decided to go right into dinner....(make sure you are hungry when you walk in the door--more on this later). The dining room is kind of U shaped and we had a great table because we could see the other patrons (celebs come here) but also felt we could have conversation ever with a full dining room (we were a party of 3). They have cozy banquettes if that is your thing.After cocktail orders (brown derby and lemon drop martini)... Then the popovers arrived.  Warm, light and scrumptious! For apps we had the crab cake which had a phyllo topping and mustard sauce (yum) and a blt salad.... We shared and it was great because we wanted to leave plenty of space for main entrees.Dinner was a NY strip & fries... Perfectly cooked and served with horseradish sauce.  The roasted chicken with herbs de Provence and veal which was pounded thin and breaded.  Portions are big enough to have some to take home!Dessert was the multilayered chocolate cake with cloud like whipped cream, and coffee ice cream...refreshing and delish!  And and ice cream sundae.Our server was professional and darling.  Nothing wrong with a charming waiter!Getting a reservation is an exercise in futility if you are not a planner or flexible.  We had 5:30 ressie and I was disappointed until we walked in the door.What a treat and special night out for us!",3,1,1

I originally booked a table for 4 but we ended up being a party of 5 and they were very accommodating. We just had to sit upstairs at the bar for a couple of minutes where we had a great conversation with the bar tenders.The restaurant downstairs was great. The decor is basically all things polo club. We sat at a table next to Chris Rock. He's a really nice guy. The food was excellent. Would definitely come back here again.,1,1,1
167,Alison M.,"Northport, NY",106,50,90,5.0,8/18/2017,"Advance reservations a MUST for this gastronomical delight!  You will be checked in on the street by someone with an iPad and be directed through the bar.  The hostess station at the top of the stairs will know who you are and direct you down the stairs or elevator.  The dining area and even bathrooms are decked out with all things equestrian.  The impeccable design carries through with the food and service.  My friend and I shared the crab cake which was coated in a fine layer of kataifi (shredded phyllo).  The dipping sauce was perfect and it was loaded with chunks of succulent crabmeat.  It is the size of a large burger patty and perfect for sharing.  We ordered the burger of the day- which had port wine sautéed onions and a formage blue cheese and the famed corned beef sandwich.  Our waiter asked if we intended on sharing and informed us both came with hand cut fries but asked if we wanted to substitute one of the fries for another side (add'l $2 fee).  He suggested the sugar snap peas, which were very tasty and refreshing.  The burger was outrageous and perfectly cooked.  They cut each sandwich in half and served us on a wooden board, each of us getting half!  It came with a pickle and some amazingly fresh coleslaw.  The corned beef lives up to the hype- tender and delicious, served on buttery grilled marble rye.  Although we were stuffed, we couldn't resist sharing a dessert.  The sundaes are supposedly stand out but my friend prefers chocolate and isn't a huge ice cream fan.  It was a toss up between the cobbler and the brownie.  Our waiter suggested the brownie.  It arrived warm, with crunchy almonds, a scoop of gelato and a decadent pitcher of melted chocolate to pour on top.  A chocolate lovers dream!   We had one glass of wine and 2 pilsners between the two of us and the bill came to $140- surprisingly low for the caliber and plethora of food we just hurt ourselves with!  Polo is the perfect special occasion restaurant you have been looking for, or just if you want to feel special.  On the website, they ask that you limit taking pictures to just your party- you never know who may be dining next to you!",,,1
168,Christie D.,"Sandy Hook, CT",0,14,11,5.0,4/22/2017,"The Polo Bar opened in NYC and it was quite difficult to get a reservation, and I would assume it still is. If you do not have a reservation, don't bother stopping by as you quite literally cannot enter the restaurant without one. The staff are top notch; finely dressed, polite and attentive. Not to mention, they are everywhere. There is someone who brings water, another for bread, another to review the menu. The service cannot be beat.You have a short while to relax at the bar upstairs before you move to the dining room for dinner. We were actually seated where Ralph always sits. They told us he liked that seat because it gives a full view of the room and the entry way, so he can see everyone who is dining in his restaurant. The food is delicious. We had a butternut squash soup, the pigs in a blanket appetizer, chili served in an adorable cast iron skillet and the filet. Everything was perfect. It was more than a meal; it was a remarkable dining experience and an absolute treat. We would go back again, though not regularly, because it is quite pricey and we are not local.

The crab cake was one of the best I've ever had, and my wife's veal chop was sizably generous and perfectly crumbed. The much lauded Polo Burger was...ok. Nothing spectacular.

Between us we had a couple of appetizers, burgers and a crab cake - all outstanding. Only one thing bothered me - my drink was priced at $14 on the drink menu, but came back on the bill at $15.75.

180,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,5.0,8/14/2015,"These hot mess one-star reviews from people who are mad they couldn't get into the Polo Bar make me laugh. I'm sorry you're upset that you were jilted by a popular restaurant. The pain will ease with time, I promise.My boyfriend surprised me with dinner here for my birthday. Every component of the meal, from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out, was top-level. I went into it expecting it not to live up to the hype, only to be pleasantly proven wrong. The Polo Bar is as nice and as good and as cool as everyone says it is. The vibe: Downton Abbey meets Mad Men. Super moody lighting playing off of the rich wood, brass, and mirrored finishes. Comfortable noise level of chatter and clatter. The crowd: MONEY. I'm comfortable admitting that I was probably the poorest person in there. Wall Street types, business executives, and yes, several notable celebrities. But this is the kind of place where you don't acknowledge that you recognize them because you're all just trying to enjoy a good meal. Ohmygod is that Kevin Spacey? Ohmygod it is. Don't stare. Eat your chicken and be cool.The staff: Perfection. They're there when they're needed, and they're gone when they're not. They're obliging and polite, and obviously all well-trained to interact with a demographic which is used to getting nothing but the best. The food: Fancy comfort food. Pigs in a blanket sidle up next to caviar on the appetizer list. I had roast chicken (delicious) and the bf had the Polo Burger (so good he refused to offer me a taste). Dessert is HIGHLY recommended, particularly the pecan pie, which changed my life.The prices: High, but much lower than I expected. $177 plus tip for both of us, and we had drinks, apps, entrees, dessert, and coffee. I've spent more on far inferior meals with far inferior service.Overall: A memorable once-in-a-while special-occasion meal. Call well in advance, because reservations are hard to come by. And enjoy yourself. It's the Polo Bar.",14,9,6
181,Craig D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,3/9/2017,"Ambiance: What one could describe only as ""Polo""--wainscot walls, portraits of horses, fireplaces. The bar and sitting room upstairs are excellent, particularly the table next to the fireplace. 5 / 5.Food: High-end American menu. The chefs do well with what the menu is, but I wouldn't characterize the food as extraordinary. It's good, but not as good as the price. 3.5 / 5Service: No complaints about the service. The hosts and servers were polite and friendly. They did not go the extra mile as they would at, for example, a Le Coucou. But they were very good. 4 / 5.Bottom Line: As of right now (March 2017) I give the Polo Bar a 5 / 5. The decor (which is why you go) is superb and makes you feel as if you are in a English gentleman's manor (or Ralph Lauren's, to be more precise), which makes it unique. Moreover, at this time, there's a 50 / 50 chance you'll see some level of celebrity inside, which is always fun, and the crowd is currently very trendy. With that said, I don't think the current level of service and food will enable the Polo Bar to maintain the status it has as one of the toughest reservations to get in NYC.",,,

It was nothing short of perfect! I know it sounds exaggerated but it honestly isn't. I made reservations well in advance as is recommended with this fine place and so once we arrived (our party consisted of 4 adults & 3 kids--family of 5 and his brother/gf were the additional 2ppl) we were well received. They were attentive, extremely polite and we barely had any wait time. Once we were seated our waiter came right over. He was knowledgeable about the menu, gave excellent recommendations and he was not wrong about any of them. I feel awful that I waited this long to write this as now I cannot recall his name. His service was beyond professional (as was everyone associated with this Ralph Lauren establishment), funny, and efficient. The ambiance, decor and feel was traditionally All-American with just the right touch of luxe. I loved that they had a diverse staff, definitely an added plus for our group. Now, the food...... A M A Z I N G! The fish, the chicken, the burger---they were all cooked, prepared and presented superbly! For such normally regular everday meals, these were prepared in such a way that they simply were NOT your ordinary ""burger"" nor ""chicken"" nor ""fish"". And tasted as such, we all agreed.

The ambiance was fantastic, one of those places that you take your folks to - very Gatsby chic. The food was wonderful and the bar on the first floor was lovely, if not a little cramped as it is the main thoroughfare to get to the downstairs dining area.

I asked where the meat is from and they told me it is from the same source of Gibson Steakhouse in Chicago. I went on Gibosn's web site and they state: ""Our beef is corn fed for 120 days and aged for 40 days."" Corn fed!!! Even if it is Organic corn, this is NOT what cows eat!! My point is, if you have an upscale restaurant, the most important thing are your products. Nowadays grass fed meat is the only way to go. I grew up in my grandfather ranch/farm in Veneto, Italy and I know exactly what cows eat.Corn fed is not an option for me even if it makes the meat more tender (you have to know that naturally raised cows do not give tender meat.)Regarding my meal, party of two:1) Crab cake appetizer was excellent, light and with the right taste.2) Filet Mignon, as I said, even if it tasted good, it was not was I was looking for.3) Veal Chop, not good because they were overwhelmed by butter therefore meat did not have its own flavor. 3) Apple Pie was good and thankfully not ""oppressed"" by cinnamon. The crust was soft and delicious and apples inside creamy.I  do not know if all ingredients were Organic or not. This is something that would make the real difference.Service was impeccable.Overall, I will try to go back in October to try the meat from the ranch, otherwise unless they will make public the source of their produces and they are all Organic, there is no reason to return.",9,3,3

Everything is detailed whether the napkins in the restroom have the Polo Bar logo to the table napkins crafted in Italy. Everyone is extremely professional. I had to wait by the bar for a friend and one of the waitresses was consistently filling my ice water. It's a hassle getting a reservation but well worth it. I ordered a burger and cheese platter... Food was outstanding including the bread they serve at the table. If you aren looking for a vintage, 5th avenue, upscale environment... This is definitely the place.",1,,
