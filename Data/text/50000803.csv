1,JANUARY S.,"New York, NY",1,14,0,3.0,11/11/2018,"I love La Pain. Their food is always yummmy...when I eventually get it. Hence, the 3 stars. I don't know if it's the Le Pain culture, but they seriously take their time. I've experienced this in multiple locations on UES. I could be the only person in the place and I've waited 15 mins SOLID for avocado toast. WHY?! I thought I'd get a leg up and order online for pick-up. Nope, same problem :(The two things I cannot gripe about are the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff. The food is always fresh and tasty. The staff is always friendly, despite dealing with people waiting for their orders.",,,
2,Vidushi S.,"New York, NY",123,19,0,1.0,11/9/2018,"I just ordered a breakfast sandwich from here and specified 'NO BACON' atleast twice. This was followed by a 20 min wait. I checked in with the person at the counter and was dismissed with 'it takes 10 min'. I figured they are busy and kept on waiting. I could see a takeaway bag at the kitchen counter and thought its mine. After no help for net 20 min I went to the counter and asked them if its my sandwich and after they confirmed I took it. THE SANDWICH HAD 5 PIECES OF BACON IN IT. Writing in caps just so this is not lost. I saw this when I got home and called them so that I could speak with the manager - JASMINE - after a 5 min wait on the phone, I was told that the Manager is very busy. The person on the phone went on to say 'Hon, you need to be a little understanding'. By this time,  I was annoyed because as customers we show patience and understanding when a restaurant is busy. But as a service industry, the restauranr has 2 key accountabilities towards us1. DO NOT SERVE MEAT WHEN IT IS A NO MEAT SANDWICH2. SHOW THE CURTESY TO EXCUSE YOURSELF FOR 5 MIN FOR A CUSTOMER ON CALL. I am sure its not common for customers to call3. REALIZE THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS TOO HAVE JOBS AND ARE BUSY SO 'BE A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING'The fact that I was served meat when explicitly asked not to made me lose my trust in this place. The wait and the 'very busy manager' unable to attend to a customer specifically calling for her - I can still ignore these as their inability to prioritize. I tried to be 'understanding' by calling to discuss versus directly coming to yelp. But if I receive a dismissal instead of apology or acknowledgement for meat in my samdwich - that is taking your customers for granted. You just lost one.",,,
3,George G.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,23,6,1.0,9/6/2018,"The food: For the price its not amazing. Same goes for the cappuccino. 3 pastries and 3 cappuccinos will run you over $30 bucks.. ridiculous. The staff: I will try and excuse the lady as she seemed to need help, but she was in her world moving tables not realizing I moved it for a reason. She literally shoved it back next to the other one for no reason. She was just plain rude overall. The table next to us had the previous guests plates for over 20 minutes. Appalling service.",1,,
4,Anastasia K.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,2.0,11/2/2018,I love Le Pain Quotidien but this location is awful. What a horrible service ! Ugh... Our waiter was slow and unfriendly. He smiled to us once when he brought a check :(,1,,
5,Debra R.,"New York, NY",91,5,0,1.0,10/22/2018,"This review is for the seated cafe. The service at this location is terrible. I was there around 9:30 on a Monday morning, it was not busy and our table of 3 had to ask to place an order and ask again for our check. We waited at least 20 minutes for a server to take our order. The food is good, as is the cappuccino. No complaints there.The restroom was disgusting, dirty, smelly. If you're going to LePain, go to another location.",1,,

Updated review","I take back my older review. What's up with this locations staff issues?! I give up, you win. You're understaffed, and no one seems in charge. The food is great you just can't get it, or get the table wiped off, or get water, or get the bill. You keep giving me a free item and apologizing. I don't want free stuff. I want my order. So. I'm breaking up with you. I've given you about three years worth of chances. It's come to that point where my mother would say, shame on me! I get it. Time to go.",1,,

9,Charlie D.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,2.0,5/21/2018,"Hi. This is a review for the seated cafe.We really like the food and coffee and proximity. The staff is lovely, there just isn't enough staff at this location. Generally, empty tables are sitting with the previous customers dirty dishes. You wait a minimum of 5 minutes but sometimes as much as 15 before being greeted, and then your table needs to be cleared and cleaned before menus are dropped. That said, if you are prepared and not in a super rush, its not so bad. You just order everything (drinks and food and the check) when you are first greeted by your server otherwise a casual quick breakfast/lunch can turn into a tedious affair. Best to sit at the communal table so you can easily flag the server as they are tending to your neighbors. I wouldn't recommend sitting outside unless you bring your own lunch.",1,,

Updated review","I ordered a tartine and there were mini baby pickles that were served on the side. I was very shocked and disgusted because the mini baby pickles had an old, moldy smell. They literally had a bacteria smell to them. I cannot believe that the chef would be so careless as to keep old, unclean food in the kitchen and serve it to customers! This is not the first time that he has served food in a subpar and careless manner. If the pickles are old or have not been properly refrigerated or what not, they should be thrown out. Customers should not have to risk getting ill due to foods of that nature. Throw out the mini baby pickles that you guys have now!",2,,1

Updated review","We popped in for a quick bite, what a gem! We were hesitant to try LePain because of some of the reviews, but it was busy inside so figured it couldn't be so bad.  So glad we did!  Morgan greeted us right away and though the restaurant was super busy, she gave us excellent and personal service!  The Avocado tartine on gluten free bread was excellent (the side of kale salad has just the right kick) and the three bean chili with baguette was a fall day delight!  Loved the huge lattes in ceramic bowls, perfect to keep your hands warm.  You have gained two UES locals with your food and service today.  Side note, it is curious that the negative reviewers are serial complainers....interesting.",1,,
15,Philipp P.,"New York, NY",6,86,144,5.0,7/31/2017,"I am giving this location 5 stars because of the exceptional waitress Jamika T! Frequently I am visiting Pain Quotidien restaurants in Paris and New York because of their healthy food menu but unfortunately they are well known for their bad service, often because they are understaffed. When you visit this location and you get Jamika as a waitress then you are well taken care of! She will be quick, wont forget anyhting and she will handle the understaffed restaurant by prioritizing her tasks ... Usually I would not rate a restaurant so prominently by their staff but since I have only written low rated reviews for Pain Quotidien's because of their service, I found it important to point out that there are staffmembers at this restaurant that are absolutely outstanding. Jamika should be able to train other waiters on how to keep your customers satisfied.",3,1,

19,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3285,12680,3.0,5/10/2015,"Good spot for tasty breads, muffins, and pastries. Nice place to hit for lunch or weekend brunch. Friendly attentive staff.Tasty coffee and teas. Usually has daily food and drink specials on the board. A little pricey for the portions but worth the quality. Nice seating with separate tables and also a big communal table to share. Lots of terrific spreads to put on your bread offered at the table. That super fatty awesome crazy tasting praline spread is da bomb!. Dropped in here early Saturday evening for a bite to eat and brought along my computer as they also offer free fast wifi. Very happy with that as I was able to get some work done while enjoying a cup of delicious sweet potato soup and a curry chicken salad tartine. Seems like one of their smaller locations, but nicely appointed. Quaint. This one is kind of hidden away on the far East Side and a quiet little gem when you want a peaceful meal.",3,3,3

We only stopped by for a little lunchtime dessert and enjoyed a cream filled donut and a raspberry tarte. Both very yummy. Our cappuccino was also very good.

The quality is hit or miss and the pricing is a little absurd. The avocado toast is very very good (but they are a little stingy with the lettuce mix on top) and my favorite dish, however it'll run you upwards of $15.....for avocado toast.I've ordered the quiche before, easily my favorite food (not including avocado of course), its actually not great. And for a french cafe, that's really disappointing! Especially when I'm finished paying $12 for a tiny slice of slimey quiche! Stick to the tartines and get out your checkbooks. The iced coffee is also really good, but stupidly overpriced (more than starbucks! Which I thought was impossible).",,,

Starbucks latte taste like hot milk-- here I can taste the rich roast.  My favorite drink right now is the super green, and my folks love the pastries. Nice staff at this location too.  Ok-- off to get my latte.Just to add--they have the best rewards app!! Yes I spend a LOT of $$ there, but I find I often earn rewards (that don't disappear in a few days like Starbucks).   Also they allow me to try new things that I might not normally order like the little pancakes (yum!) and the watermelon cooler.  My favorite rich now is the avocado toast.",,,

This thing is liable to chip a tooth.I don't think I can fully describe the supposedly 'fresh' bread than to make a YouTube video with it hitting a home run out of Shea stadium (yes, Shea.). And since I can't physically squeeze it for oh-so-delicate not too crunchy, not too softness that equals a perfectly chosen fresh baguette, I had to purchase it, and trust the counter person's description.I think it came from somewhere in the shadows of the Misty Mountains.

Tried the Parisian ham and Gruyere tartine, which is an open-faced sandwich. Seems a little pricey for what you get, but the ingredients were good, and it came with nice touches like thinly sliced radishes and cucumbers, cornichons, and small olives. If you sit down and take your time with the tartine, you'll enjoy it, which I suppose is the point - this is not the ""super chicken"" hero from Tony Farms a block down the street.I got it to-go, so I can't speak to the table service.Iced coffee is cold-brew, pretty good, not worth the price.The baked goods are top-notch. Not the very best per se, but very good. Again, you get what you pay for. That said, I did enjoy the apple turnover quite a bit (or what passes for one).Was going to be three stars since there's not much value to be had here, but LPQ -is- a step above what's available in the area, so credit goes where it's due.(P.S. - Don't get me wrong about Tony Farms.

The problem is that the staff seems totally miserable.  I don't know why but they are slow, lack all enthusiasm, pretty much make you feel like you're inconveniencing them by eating there, even the people working behind the to-go counter do not really want my business.  Are they understaffed?

I always assumed Le Pain Quotidien was similar to Europa, Pret, etc., so I had never been in one (unless you count the Central Park location) until this location opened just down the street.

Andrea L, the server's glacier-like welcome, made me feel uncomfortable to be there the whole time. We were quiet and respectful but our presence seemed to annoy her. All she had to do is to crack a little smile to make us at feel ease. The coffee was served cold (trying to contain my amazement) and I let it go. I asked for water, that she failed to deliver. Our order was taken and served in a robotesque manner. Food was satisfactory enough. Alas, Andrea never returned to check if we needed anything. This was happening right when they opened. So the restaurant was nearly empty. After finishing our breakfast we were waiting what it seemed like an eternity for our check (Quelle Surprise!!) My friend finally tracked her down for the bill. We paid and left with bad taste in our mouths. Not planning to return at this location. Please hire friendly employees who are kind to patrons.  I don't want to stay away from one of my favourite places because of one bad apple.",,1,

I detoxed after a long night out with the avocado and hemp seed tartine and a mint lemonade. So good! One of my favorites is the mustard and ham tartine. And if I feel like indulging, I'll get a croissant that comes with a bunch of jams/spreads. I always enjoy ordering from their specials menu as well. I once had a spiced cider on a cold winter day that was so satisfying. I love the set up with the long communal wood table in the middle and smaller tables around for more privacy. Prices are pretty reasonable too!",,,
56,Michelle S.,"Woodside, NY",62,3,1,1.0,5/27/2014,"Extremely disappointed with the service they are offering. The waitresses are oblivious to the costumer and they as well make an unwelcoming look. Anyhow, I ordered organic tofu shaved cabbage salad for my lunch and waited for about 25mins. until I follow up my order. One of the waitress told me that they run out of organic tofu and if however I want to change it to organic chicken. I told her why they didn't inform me right away and just made me wait for that long. She then called the manager to explain what happened and I get the same response to the fact that they run out of tofu and very apologetic about it. I decided to take my money back and just walk away losing my time waiting for nothing.",,,

Updated review","Went on a Sunday night around 6. It was about 2/3 full with patrons inside and out with only one waitperson.  I ordered the Tuscan bean salad and BF the cheese/meat cold platter.  Waiter bought the platter only. I waited and waited. Finally my salad which I had had before came.  It was 1/2 the size of previous salad with no pesto croutons, just squares of stale bread. Little dressing.  I would have sent it back but I was hungry and the waiter overwhelmed.  The wine offered at 1/2 price is poor quality. Place needs some organizing...",,,
58,A G.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,5.0,9/26/2014,"Avocado toast is to die for! Also, Our server, the tall blonde- Anne I think her nawas super helpful in guiding us through the menu. She suggested avocado toast with a soft boiled egg and it was to die for! She also explained the cold brew process which I actually never understood before today. She was extremely accommodating towards me and my dog- brought her water and everything! Great patio and nice service.  Cute location.",,,
