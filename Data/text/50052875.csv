0,Arlene Y.,"New York, NY",535,276,287,4.0,6/10/2018,"this place is spacious and has a diner feel to it. You place an order at the counter, sit down, and they bring out the food to you. This makes it so much more efficient.I ordered the fries, onion rings. chicken tenders, burger,and the peanut butter milkshake.The onion rings were perfectly crispy and I loved the onion ring sauce.  I also got the sloppy joes fries- this was amazing it was basically chili cheese fries. The chicken tenders and burger was also great.My favorite was definitely the peanut butter milkshake - it was rich and creamy. The employees are also super friendly. This place reminds me of a mix of johnny rockets and in and out burger - combination of a diner and fast food. I would definitely come back again.",1,,1
1,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,2.0,10/11/2018,"Came here for lunch with a friend after having walked by at least 3 different locations of this mini chain for years.  Place is themed to be a diner and the menu fits it.  You order at the front, give you a tracker to carry, and they bring the food to your table.  Cashier and server were friendly, and there was plenty of seating.  Food came out reasonably fast.Burger was good.  Beef was decent, could've used a little more blue cheese, and bun was fine.  A decent upgrade from a fast food burger, however nothing more and very small for the price.  Fries were just alright and the portion was small there too.  I would come again if someone wanted to, but for no other reason.  Not really worth the caloric/monetary splurge for lunch.",1,,
2,Brieana C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",135,43,52,4.0,9/28/2018,Had a great burger that was seasoned well. The fact that you could choose how you wanted your burger cooked was a huge plus for me. Normally fast casual burger joints give you a well done burger by default. Fries were good as well. I will definitely return!,,,
3,James T.,"Floral Park, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/2/2018,"Horrible service. Went in on lunch break ordered hot dog and fries. 20 minutes later nothing. Nice waiter/runner went to check on order, they never started it. Order got buried. Front cashier has zero personality and could care less about customers or anything. Went for refund she didnt even apologize or look up. Dayna should not be working the front. Wont be back. Have crew of 30 who also wont be back.",,,
4,Gabe O.,"New York, NY",7,147,485,3.0,2/28/2018,"Came across this joint by the reviews on yelp. Sounded good and was co convinced to try out.Everything is a la carte, FYI.Burgers were good. Def better than Shake Shack for sure. Fries were tasty. Onion rings were on point. All that was the good.Just a few things that were bad, partner ordered his burger well done, I ordered medium.... his was medium mine was well. He ordered no tomato, tomato was served on his burger. It's no big deal, but it's really not much we are asking for. Fries, like I said were great, wish they were a little bigger in serving size, since they do come with a 3.49 price.Other than that. Good food. Clean establishment. So so staff. I would come back. Why not.",,,
5,Alex C.,"Jersey City, NJ",251,355,1126,3.0,4/19/2018,"Decent burgers, good fries - they have beer, and that counts towards washing down the grub. Just your regular fast food place, a bit nicer that McD's or Wendy's.",2,2,2
6,Sydelle A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",39,21,115,4.0,7/28/2018,"Awesome awesome awesome staff here. They were so excited to recommend all their most popular burgers and other menu options. I loved the avocado crispy chicken sandwich. It was super tasty and if I could I would have eating a solid 10 sandwiches. The milkshakes are a perfect way to end your milk even though you may be stuffed but because the food is so good, it will be imperative that you complete your meal the best way possible. Definitely a place to go back to for lunch with friends or quick take out.",1,,
7,Shachi B.,"New York, NY",61,555,743,3.0,10/22/2017,"Even though their vegetarian options are not abundant, this place is pretty decent for lunch. I think their best bargain is their small side salad, which for me is a perfect lunch-sized portion. Plus, it comes with a variety of vegetables such as tomatoes, corn and cucumbers. Their mac and cheese used to be really good, but the last couple of times I've ordered it the texture was awful. Gritty, gloopy cheese sauce with extremely overcooked noodles. It's ample for two people to share since it is so rich you really only want one or two bites. If you eat in, it is served in a small skillet and while you might think the cast iron would keep it hot for a longer period of time, it doesn't. Their onion rings are good, but again, they give you way too many in an order so be prepared to share with 2-3 other people. The veggie burger is just ok - it's really heavy and since I couldn't tell if it was cooked on a separate grill from the regular burgers, I would suggest vegetarians steer clear from it. There is ample space for seating, but due to the absolutely terrible ventilation in the space, you're going to smell like grease, fried foods and burgers for the rest of the day. That may be a heavenly perfume for some, but I hate sitting in afternoon meetings smelling so funky. (Also, ugh to afternoon meetings, amirite?)To recap: Get the side salad, you won't be sorry!",,,
8,Sara S.,"Rockville, MD",111,41,13,5.0,7/28/2018,"This is a quick eatery that is clean and in a safe location. My husband and I got the Schnippers signature burgers which were made to perfection. They leave ketchup, mayo and mustard on the table which is awesome. The workers are also very friendly. 10/10 would go back.",,,
9,Keilon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,312,1877,4.0,7/24/2018,"Schnippers is what happens when you have fresh ingredients and good oil to fry your food in lol.  But seriously, I've never had a bad or bland item from here.  The offerings are always hot and fresh. A lot of people love the chicken tenders.  I think they're pretty decent.  They could use one more seasoning in my humble opinion but don't let that distract you from trying them.  I absolutely love the veggie sandwich here and oftentimes still order it even when I'm not going through my healthier vegetarian stages (we all could use a little detox from time to time).  Service here is usually somewhat quick and it's also a nice open space to relax and dine in.  I have no real complaints about this place. Definitely use the Ritual app on workdays to place your order before you leave the office because it can get quite crowded at lunch time.  Oh and don't forget to be a fatty and try the brownies!",,,
10,S V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0,2.0,10/28/2018,"It used to be so much better. In the past, I ordered 2-3 per week for delivery. Now, there is part of the order missing at least every other time ( the woman at the location on the phone is very nice about it), and the food is often burned; Bacon that is so burned, when I tried to bite a piece of my burger, it broke off and flew across the room, and onion rings that have clearly been sitting out a very long time, and are way over-cooked. I don't eat those, but that is a problem since an order of onion rings used to be 5 or so, but the last 2 orders had 2 whole rings and 3 1"" pieces. Ridiculous. The type of onion rings they had a year ago were so much better, maybe the distributor. changed? It's too bad, because it used to be good.",,,
11,Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",205,509,2651,3.0,7/30/2017,"I have tried a few Schnippers locations. Unlike the other locations, this one was not busy at all.  The cashier was pretty mean to me like if I interrupted her ""break"". I guessed that she rather stood around while looking at her nails. I ordered a market fresh salad, which contains beets, fresh corn, avocado, toasted almonds, cherry tomatoes, chick peas, fresh grated parmigiano, radish sprouts, croutons, and vinaigrette. Overall, it tasted pretty fresh and I was full after having.",1,1,1
12,Ginger B.,"New York, NY",159,238,630,4.0,11/30/2017,"Great burgers and good prices for a burger in Tribeca.  I also like the order ahead options in order to skip the busy lunch rush, whether through Schnippers site or through other apps such as Ritual (I usually use Ritual for rewards towards $ back.)The regular salads are a really good portion, such as the ""FIG & BLUE"" salad.Sometimes for lunch I'll just get a side salad with a burger patty on top and that's just the right size.Customer service is pretty good too - once my takeout order was incorrect and I was already back at the office with it, so someone from the restaurant hand-delivered the correct order to my building (walking distance away).My coworkers swear by the fries though I haven't ordered them to vouch for them myself!",3,2,2
13,York N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,22,26,2.0,9/19/2018,"Was underwhelmed with the quality of the burger and the service. The cashier that took my order was nice but I noticed that she didn't ask me if I preferred my burger medium or medium well. So u told her I would like my burger medium well. She then responded with ""that's the default and that's the reason why she didn't ask "" but how would she know that's what I wanted. Plus, I saw her ask two other customers ahead of me for their preferences. But whatever. I then had to wait 20 minute for my order. Watched people that order 10 min after me get their orders before I did. They clearly were not preparing the orders in the order that they were received. I got back to my office to discover a miniature burger that was medium NOT medium well. The cashier put in for a little version. Which is NOT the order I asked for.  I've included a pic of it.",,,

16,Martin W.,"Brooklyn, NY",174,598,437,3.0,10/15/2017,The place is always crowded about lunch time go figure. So I came by about 11 45 no lines and got da burger.Usually they don't ask how you take your burger at other establishments. But here they do so I told the cashier medium. Which I liked that ohh I can get medium rare hmm.So I sit down and start munching. The burger seems pretty decent and the french fries as well. But the burger was well done and only a quarter of the burger was medium rare.,,,
17,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",388,497,41,4.0,8/29/2017,"Was a bit hesitant on ordering in a 'fast-food' burger for dinner, but the BF assured me it'd be good and he was right.  We each had the Schnipp and it arrived in good form and tasted delicious.  My sweet potato fries weren't great - arrived clumped together and weren't seasoned very well.  I recommend ordering the regular fries - tasty and crispy.  We also ordered a side garden salad that was surprisingly good too. Would order from Schnippers again.",1,,1
18,Medusa G.,"Bronx, NY",0,32,4,2.0,4/29/2018,"Meh. Trying to be nice. The customer service there is great. This rating is solely for the food though.Came in here on an empty stomach.The food itself. First of all too dang salty. Not tryna' raise my blood pressure. Lay off the salt.Second of all, kinda bland as far as the cheeseburger and fries I had. Left a lot to be desired. Vanilla milkshake was ok, but maybe a little too sweet. Couldn't finish it.Third of all, a bit pricey for no reason.Overall, great customer service, great ambiance and clean restaurant, but mediocre food at high prices.",,,
19,Jess C.,"Freehold, NJ",17,23,0,3.0,10/4/2018,"The prices are high, but I was ok with that because it's the city. However, the veggie burger was not good and was pretty upset to spend that money on something dry and not fulfilling.",,,
20,Maria R.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",86,96,142,3.0,9/2/2017,This place is ok.. I got the clsssic Cobb salad and it was really good but I didn't like the workers because the guy who served us was nice but I asked him for a water cup and followed him to the register and I overheard his coworkers making fun of him calling him bacon face and wouldn't let him talk until they were done making fun of him. also what restaurant doesn't have still water??? They only have soda water .. oh and the grilled chicken was a little burnt and dry they could totally work on it. Also there's no tissue in the restroom how are people supposed to wash their hands and then open the door with their own hands that's super unsanitary. Also the ketchup and salsa bottles need a refill..,,,
21,Kandace F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1,4.0,2/7/2018,"Alright. Schnippers has forced me to come on Yelp and write a review. I ordered a little before 1:30pm today. My food was supposed to arrive between 2:20pm-2:30. Cool. Next thing you know, I look up, it's ten minutes to 3:00, and I have no lunch. So, I call Schnippers. I spoke to a woman there, I didn't catch her name, but she sounded like The Boss. She apologized for the delay, that they've been backed up w/ their delivery service, but says ""that's no excuse."" She told me that if I didn't have my food in 5 minutes to call back, and someone would leave from the store with a new order. I absolutely loved her no-nonsense, no excuse attitude. I waited another 10 minutes. With no food, I call back. A young man answered, and I gave him the rundown. He apologized profusely, and said that he'd fire up a new order and have someone come and bring it to me. About half an hour later - bam! Cold, tasty shake. Warm sweet potato fries. And my burger was cooked to a perfect medium all the way through. It was a long wait, but it was worth the wait. Thank you, Schnippers!! I really appreciated the awesome customer service.",,1,
22,Claudia W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,3,3.0,8/3/2018,"I ordered through Seamless and it came in a reasonable time. I ordered the Mac and cheese and a drink, but when I ate it, it was a really small portion (but it's $6 and change), and tasted like it was reheated Mac and cheese. I have ordered a crispy chicken sandwich from there before (which was really good), and I would order again from them, but would not get the Mac and cheese.",,,
23,Monica T.,"Brooklyn, NY",316,13,6,1.0,3/2/2018,"I used to love Schnippers. After today, I will no longer visit any of their locations.If it were possible to give zero stars I would. We ordered Schnippers at 12:30 via Grubhub, with an estimated delivery time as 1:50. The longer than usual wait was fair, because the weather was undesirable. I called around 2p and they said the order was leaving and on the way. (Our office is a 10 min bike ride away). I then called back at 2:45, was put on hold and then left there. I understand that places get busy, but this is ridiculous. I called back again around 3, they told me AGAIN that my food had left, at which point I told them I would like to cancel my order and they would not because the order had left already (it was 3:00 at this point). We ended up ordering from Soho Park, it took twenty minutes, and going about the rest of our day. At 4:21, I repeat FOUR TWENTY ONE PM, our delivery is dropped off. Ice cold, the beverage was all over the bag and food, and the food had clearly been sitting in the bags for sometime as they were soaked in grease. A three hour wait is insane, do not order takeout from here, and do not give this business your money. There are plenty of burger places in the city, I would even take McDonald's over this at this point.",,,
24,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1044,25541,4.0,10/7/2016,"Okay, so this review is really more of a 3.5 star review - but I'm nudging it upwards but this is the nicest Schnipper's location I've ever been to. The two I've frequented the most are the one by Flatiron and the one midtown on 7th ave.As I told my friend Ingrid S. and as she made clear in her review - the one thing that I've always been a huge fan of are Schnipper's freakin' chicken tenders. They're amazing. Battered in what seems to be deliciously seasoned italian crumbs and with juicy AF white meat chicken, you cannot go wrong with these.The burgers are okay too for a notch or 2 above fast food - but the chicken tenders here with their chipotle ranch, their buttermilk ranch and their honey mustard and BBQ sauces is where its at. My last time here I also had the pleasure of trying their 4 cheese grilled cheese sandwich with bacon. It was good, tasted homemade and had a good cheese to bread ratio. The bread itself was also perfectly toasted and buttery so kudos there. The mac and cheese here is also sold in a simple, fast food kind of way as well. Better than I thought it would be, but still not cracking my top 10 mac and cheeses I've ever had...but I'm also a mac & cheese snob, so there's that :).Finally, the milkshakes here are also outstanding if you want a nice simple milkshake. My friend got the peanut butter shake and it was good - like diabetes in a cup, lol. I opted for their Cookies n' Cream shake because Oreos give me life. There were chunks of Oreo and chunks of Oreo frosting in my shake. If I were a boy - I would absolutely hop into someone's yard to get this milkshake :).What I really like about Schnipper's is that each location churns out consistently quality food. Those chicken tenders are like crack as are their shakes...and their fries....oh their lovely, lovely fries. Yay Schlepper's!!!",4,2,1
25,Dani T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,1,1.0,3/20/2018,"I wanted to try this place because it looks well organized and clean. The people that work there are for the most part friendly. I decided to get a burger and I ended up getting Green Chile, I told them that I did want any cheese and no sauce but I wanted the peppers. I ask the cook if it was better for me to just get the regular hamburger since I wasn't getting the main toppings and he told me to still get green Chile even tho I would end up paying 5 dollars more. I trusted him and I ended up getting that burger. Big mistake. What I got was a super simple, small, salty and crazy oily burger not bigger than an Oreo cookie. The cook clearly did not care about me and he just wanted to take my money. I am so disappointed and I would never come back to this place. There are many other places that sell better burger around this area. It actually made me feel sick. Just avoid this place",,,
26,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64753,4.0,9/14/2016,"There's another new Schnipper's, this time in TriBeCa, and it feels nicer than the previous ones, with sleek decor and even some rocking chairs to eat in by the solo diner area near the ordering counter.For a chainy fast food place, the food is pretty great. The burgers are solid, including the new one exclusive to this location, the ""Brie Happy TriBeCa Burger"", which is obviously topped with Brie, and plenty of it, but the large variety of chicken sandwiches here are really great too.The fries are excellent and crispy, as are the large onion rings. Aside from Hudson Eats and a few places around that area, including two locations of Shake Shack, this is now definitely one of the top choices for a satisfying lunch.",8,6,6
27,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,9/27/2016,"I've been to both the Flatiron location and now this new location that's relatively close to my job downtown. The benefits of the downtown location is that they have a brand new Brie burger for only this spot. I didn't try it, so I can't speak of how it tastes but I'm pretty sure someone in the group of people I went with for food ordered it and it looked amazing. They always have some kind of crazy happy hour going on for like $2-3 beers. Nothing remarkable but all the Schnippers have cheap drinks until around 7pm. Most important part - the food: I'm not really impressed with their burgers. I had ordered the Hickory Bacon Blue Burger. It was good but not outstanding. The crispy onions and the hickory smokey bbq sauce are the savior of a dry over-cooked meat patty accompanied with blue cheese that even dries it out more with bacon that I couldn't care for. Maybe I ordered the wrong burger. My friend's grilled cheese with bacon wasn't much better though. Also, the mac and cheese side order we split was very powdery and chalky and tasted super processed. Onion rings are really good. Their crack mayo ranch sauce with chipotle blended in is outstanding. I'd dip everything in this. The one recommendation I truly have for this place is GET THEIR CHICKEN FINGERS. No, seriously. They sell some of the best chicken fingers I've ever had in my life. It sounds absurd but it's so true. Moist on the inside and crispy on the outside with a side of crack sauce, yeeeesssssss. If their chicken fingers taste that great, I'd expect their chicken burgers to be equally as fantastic. Lastly, you need to experience their shakes at least once. It's intense and totally shareable. I had tried the peanut butter and chocolate and it literally tastes like someone dumped a pint of melted down chocolate peanut butter Haagen Dazs straight into a blender with some cream and poured me a stiff one. The cookies and cream has actual chunks of oreo like cookies in it. Service was very good. Food, depending on what you order is decent. But I feel so many other burger places in the area (cough Shake Shack and Bareburger) excel and rival them on making the classic cheeseburgers taste significantly better. Also, all locations are pretty much priced the same. Schnipper's specialty burgers and sandwiches run you around $8-10. My advice: get the fried chicken, cheap beer, and milkshakes.",3,1,2
28,Tom K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/4/2018,"I've been here several times in the last few months and can say that I've always had a wonderful experience.

29,Phi C.,"New York, NY",1,43,75,4.0,6/8/2018,This is my first time the Schnippers. The food was pretty good. I would definitely come back again. It was quick and fresh. However the reason I am giving it four stars is that my friend had to wait 15 minutes for a salad. It seemed out of the ordinary that it would take so long. Nevertheless it's a good place to go to for lunch and i would recommend it.,,,
30,Jojo P.,"Queens, NY",51,9,2,1.0,2/1/2018,"One star for their ""baked"" mac and cheese. Oh my god it was just awful. In the menu it states that it's four cheese but I really couldn't tell. Also, it was supposed to be baked, I saw nothing on that plate that indicated that it was baked. Not sure if having it to go was the reason for that. Now for the mac and cheese itself.. it had no flavor and had a really super gritty texture. It tasted as if they used a powder and it didn't mix right. It was so sandy. Not to mention, the serving was almost half the size of a serving for a toddler. I paid almost $7 for that. I will however go back to try a burger or a sandwich because I've seen pictures of this place and it looks good. Just stay away from their toddler sized overly priced sandy and flavorless mac and cheese.",,,
31,Ruby C.,"Manhattan, NY",15,113,1524,3.0,4/17/2017,"Came here for  a late lunch and tried out the Schnipper Classic Burger. I also ordered a side of fries with it. The burger was pretty good. Bacon was crispy and burger patty was juicy. The burger itself lacked a little flavor to it. I didn't really notice the schnipper sauce to be honest, but I didn't really check to see if it was there. The fries on the other hand were not good at all. They didn't taste fresh. They were warm, but had a chew to it, as if they were almost stale or left out for too long after being fried. I didn't finish them, but probably won't be trying those again if I ever go back. Other than that, the space itself is very spacious and has tons of seats. When I came, there were probably less than 5 people there. It's pretty cozy and you get enough personal space. One thing I did noticed was that I was given a buzzer after I placed my order, but my order never buzzed. There was a guy that came up and gave me my order instead. Being that it was empty, it was easy for him to spot us, but if it gets busy, the broken buzzer wouldnt be very efficient. Overall I wouldn't say I would rush here to try the food again, but if there was really no places to eat, it will do the job.",,1,
32,Amany H.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,27,123,3.0,3/31/2017,"I'm not sure how I feel about this joint. Let me give you my experience here. I was around the area because of a PD for work and I wanted a private area to enjoy some Netflix on my phone while I have lunch. In terms of seating and environment, it was very clean and welcoming. I even sat right next to a wall so that I got the privacy I wanted. The joint is pretty cute-designed like a 1950s burger drive in almost. Now the food is pretty good. I ordered the spicy burger I don't remember the name of it but it wasn't spicy. I was feeling like indulging when I saw they offered  sloppy joe fries so I went all in. However, the portion is very tiny for $7 side?! And it was too rich-not in a good way. I felt like I needed something light and right after those fries. The burger was worth it -juicy and well flavored. I just wanted a stronger kick in the chilis.  The price overall is too expensive for the portions they serve. In total I paid about $23 for a meal. I probably won't return there again unless I'm in the area and want only the burger.",1,,
33,Ayesha A.,"Brooklyn, NY",348,414,635,4.0,2/6/2017,"I like this place. I gone to the one in the Flatiron many times. When I realized there was one walking distance from where I worked I decided to give it a try. Came at lunch time, thankfully the restaurant wasn't crowded. Ordered chicken fingers and fries to stay. They give you a sensor to take to your table and when you food is ready they bring it to you similar to one that you would receive at the Olive Garden to wait for your table. The food to made to order so its not exactly quick. When it comes it has everything you need and condiments are on the table. The restaurant is set up nicely. Very clean and staff is nice. I enjoy my visits here.",4,,3

35,L B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,4.0,7/31/2018,"Ordered delivery as I had a chicken finger craving. Man their chicken fingers are ON POINT. Delicious white meat, breading is just right. Fries are meh. Also ordered the mac and cheese because well who can say no to mac? For $6.19, I got a super measly portion and it was not good. Much rather go to Whole Foods and get their mac. And last but not least, also had to pile on the Onion Rings - huge serving, and they were perfectly crispy and absolutely delicious. So total yes to the chicken fingers and onion rings, and no to the fries and mac ... this 3.5 rating will be rounded up because I will totally be stopping by for what I like again!",,,

I also got the sweet potato fries, about $4.60 which were not soggy(thankfully) and freshly made! It came with some type of maple dipping sauce which actually went really well together. I would recommend ordering online then picking up instead of ordering here. Very friendly and helpful service along with a good-sized eating area.

I get out of the subway station, and I see Schnipper's is having something called $2 Tuesdays. I decided to get the cheeseburger which was $2, fries which was also $2 and a drink. It came out to around $7, which is a great deal for Schnipper's. The women who took my order, Vannessa, was actually the only bad experience I had at this place. I asked her about the $2 Tuesday specials, and she wasn't in the mood to tell me anything. She was very curt and a little condescending. I was actually ready to go tell her to keep the food, and I was thinking about going back to Shake Shack, which is a few blocks away, but I wanted a Schipper's burger and put up with her attitude.Other than Vannessa, the experience was pleasant, and I thought the food was very good. It wasn't too crowded when I arrived, and it was easy to get a table. The guy that delivered my burger and fries was very pleasant and the place was clean. I think I waited no more than five minutes for my order to arrive.The cheeseburger was cooked just right to my liking, which is medium. The burger is on the small side but size-wise it is similar to Shake Shack and Five Guys. The burger came with lettuce and tomato. The roll was very fresh. Ketchup was on the table. The fries were crisp, not soggy, and hot. I would come back again. I just don't want to see Vanessa anymore.",2,,1
41,Christiane V.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,0,5.0,3/14/2018,"Seems like many of the negative reviews are about problems ordering out, but I wanted to write about my experience dining in.The veggie and goat cheese sandwich is sooo good! Normally I'm skeptical about ordering things like that from a fast casual burger place, but this exceeded my expectations so much that I have to write a review. The veggies were incredibly fresh, the whole wheat ciabatta was soft, the ratio was on point. Wayyy better and fresher than pret down the street, and much cheaper than the comparable veggie sandwiches at aroma also a few shops down (it was $10 after tax, whereas at aroma it's $15!) I would definitely trust getting a salad or sandwich from here if you don't want a burger. The sandwich was very filling, I didn't even get fries and still couldn't finish the last few bites. The inside is very spacious and very clean, sleek Americana vibe. They bring your order to you so no standing around and waiting. I would definitely go back.",,,

But, yesterday, I'm just stunned with the level of customer service I was essentially gifted. After placing an order, I had to quickly dash back to the office. The woman who took my order held it for like 30 minutes or so until I returned so I could have a freshly made burger upon my return. I didn't even ask for this! I didn't have a chance to ask or speak much as I had to dash out for a short emergency.  But, they wanted to give something to enjoy and said as much.And, then the chef hand-delivered my sandwich to me on a plate.And, when I was finished and sated another server took my tray without prompting.Everyone was kind, friendly, professional and cheerful.I'm floored by how considerate everyone was to me.

When I was looking at the menu while waiting I really couldn't find anything that really stood out to me. It all seemed pretty straightforward and not very creative. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and fries. It was...fine. Just fine. You could have replaced it with a crispy chicken sandwich from Wendy's and I wouldn't notice. The fries were pretty good but fries are good no matter where you go. Overall, it was a bland meal.What was more disappointing was the fact that it was so expensive. The chicken sandwich alone was $10 and didn't come with fries! I can get the same amount of food at Burger King for way less and it would taste exactly the same. Schnipper's is a minimum $20 meal.The staff was pretty decent when it came to service. They all seemed pleasant and at least pretended to like being there. It took a little longer than it should have to get my food seeing as how there were only 2 people (not including myself) there.I'd give Schnipper's a pass.

Also I hate mayo.... and they put it on there w/o it ever saying that it comes with mayo. The real let down was the fries though... they were overcooked to death. They weren't burnt but they were like chewing twigs... very tough.

Updated review","Unfortunately this place just isn't helping itself.  As I said in my original review, the food is quite good.  However -- as other readers have pointed out -- they have a GIANT PROBLEM WITH QUALITY CONTROL.  There is rarely an order that doesn't have something wrong or mixed up.  This last Friday took the cake.  My son came home with the order which was missing his cheese fries -- a typical error for this place, and my son should know by now you have to inspect the order carefully.  So he went back across the street and fetched his fries.  Al good, right?  No, of course not.  Took a bite into my BLT and realized there was no ""L.""  How the hell can you not put lettuce on the Bacon, LETTUCE and tomato sandwich.  Well, if anyone can, Schnippers on Church St. can.  This makes about 9 of the last 10 orders where something was screwed up.  TO THE OWNER: YOU'VE SEEN ALL THE REVIEWS AND HEARD ALL THE COMPLAINTS. HOW HARD IS IT TO FIX THE PROBLEM?  HOW HARD IS IT TO TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO PUT  THE CORRECT ITEMS IN A BAG?  I'm just about giving up on you.",,,

So $7.50 for chicken fingers it says. So was it wrong for me expect more than 4? 4 particularly small sized chicken on top of mc Donalds looking fries. I think its too price for the quantity of meat I got. Taste wise they were ok , nothing I would order again. I also ordered a smores shake, so its tastes like graham cracker icecream and they put some dark chocolates chip inside but they sank to the bottom and don't come up the straw. Overall the shake was good if I can get chocolate up the straw. But I think its interesting flavor and I give credit for that. I would deliver again to try burger.",,,
62,Christian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",672,199,205,3.0,3/5/2017,"We both had a taste for a burger so we decided to stop in here and each order one. She decides to flip the script on me at the register and get a chicken sandwich ( flip flopper) but I stayed true true to my word and ordered a a burger. However, I accidentally ordered the blue cheese burger when I wanted a cheeseburger. I thought they made the mistake but she assured me it was me who made the mistake. How come women always seem to know when you make a mistake? Lol. Anyway, my burger wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again.....bleu cheese, in my opinion is for salads and chicken wings....not burgers. Her chicken sandwich wasn't what she expected either but neither of us feel our meals were bad....we just ordered poorly. The joint was fairly empty since we were there on a Thursday evening  but there was one rambunctious little girl who was terrorizing the place with her mother' blessing. She was very cute but she was very distracting as she ran up and down the steps, played in the condiments and even attempted to follow me in the bathroom as her mother had her face buried in her iPhone.

Casual decor but what grabbed my attention was the fact that you can order, find a seat and they will bring your order to you! They also sell beers and wine if your looking for an extra kick while you were eating. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries. The fries were hot and crispy just the way they were intended to be so no objections there. The issue were the chicken tenders. Crispy outside, soft white meat inside but so bland. It doesn't taste like anything. Even after eating them with ketchup etc it was just okay. My friend ordered the cheeseburger and he said it was just decent.

The mac and cheese came in a little container and was 5.99 plus tax. It was smaller than kid size. The chicken was bland and has no flavor. I would never order from here again. Long story short, food was below average and not worth the price.",,,
