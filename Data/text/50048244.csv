0,Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",85,401,118,5.0,9/10/2018,"We stayed in the ""Towers"" section of the Palace Hotel which consists of the rooms that occupy the highest floors of the building. We loved our 46th floor room that had views of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the NBC buildings. It was also nice to have our own private lobby, concierge, and check in. Sometimes they offered free iced water bottles if you hadn'talready consumed the two free that are provided daily in your rooms with little chocolates. Because we went during the finals of the US Open, staying in the Towers meant you were regularly brushing shoulders with the likes of Serena Williams or Nadal. The hotel's location in midtown is ideal for getting to most of the big tourist destinations, shopping, broadway shows, and great food by foot. The breakfast restaurant and bakery on site are both phenomenal and cocktails on the famous patio was a dream for this Gossip Girl fan. The only negative we had on our trip was the housekeeping. It was super inconsistent and a lot of times even the bare minimum wasn't done. We came back from a long sweaty day of seeing the sites and needed to quickly shower to head back out for dinner and a show. We returned to our newly made up room with no towels. When my husband called to ask for them to bring some they only brought two when most hotels give you four at a minimum. There was no time to call them back up so we just made due. Two nights we weren't given the shower rug so we had to stand on a tiny wash cloth to dry off and two other nights they stopped giving us the complimentary water bottles. Since my husband and I caught a cold at the end of the trip we had to call to request them since we really needed to hydrate. Because it was our first trip to NYC we packed a lot in so when problems like this arise all we have time to do is try to get whatever we don't have and keep it moving; there isn't time to chat with a manager everytime there was an issue especially when we return to our room late at night. Luckily guest services comp'd one morning's breakfast to make up for the hassle which was over $100 off our total hotel bill. This was much appreciated. We would definitely stay here again. The amenities, appearance, and its location make it the best choice.",2,,
1,Amanda L.,"Chicago, IL",14,123,5,5.0,9/9/2018,"This review is for The Towers, which does not have its own separate Yelp page. New York City hotels are ridiculously priced even if you're staying at a Days Inn so hey may as well go all out and get treated like royalty, right? We've stayed here twice and as far as we are concerned, it's the only hotel in Manhattan. They've gone out of their way for us on both visits- providing Neosporin for my blistered feet, setting up use of their Mercedes for trips to Broadway shows, lending us their umbrellas. I have the worst post vacation blues after leaving them. They have wonderful Molton Brown toiletries and I hope they never change them-- they smell amazing and are top notch quality. Room service is super pricey but delicious. We really liked Trouble's Trust-- one of the hotel bars-- which is super modern and has a great cocktail list. It's not cheap by any means but it is a wonderful place. We saw Rafael Nadal's parents in the elevator during the US Open so if it's good enough for them, it's more than enough for me!",,,

The staff was very friendly and accommodated for my late arrival and check out. The Bellman was very helpful and Omar in the Coffee shop made my morning with his positive attitude! We arrived late and had a cocktail in the lounge. Very nice! The Cathedral across the street makes it all the more exquisite! I will definitely return! Thank you!,,,

7,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1187,993,6630,4.0,6/29/2018,"Lotte New York Palace is a beautiful hotel. I was here for two days for a conference. The service was excellent, the food was very good and the setting was clean, new and well kept.I didn't realize that I've walked by this hotel multiple times in Midtown East. Lotte New York Palace is next to St Patrick's Cathedral and one block away from Rockefeller Center. They are steps away from the beautiful St Patrick's. Lotte's also has a nice Christmas tree during the holidays. The lobbies, hallways, and conference rooms exude an understated luxury. The chandeliers are shining and opulent. Golden painted staircases. The sinks in the restrooms are marbled. The white paper towels feel like linen but are disposable. The staff were extremely friendly. They greeted conference goers at the elevators, made sure we got food and refilled the hot beverages. They were quick to adjust the room temperature when people complained about the cold temp. The food was very good for a conference! We had medium rare prime rib sandwiches, fudge brownies, melt sandwiches, Cesar salad wraps, stir fried glass noodles, and BLT with turkey club sandwiches. The food was so fresh, they replenished the items quickly and kept everything so neat and clean!  It was a wonderful hospitality for a conference! instagram.com/snackchatn…",11,5,10
8,Kristin G.,"Austin, TX",147,122,45,3.0,8/2/2018,"We stayed here for a 4 night stay in July and it was a mixed experience. The pros: the beds are super comfortable, the towels are crisp and clean and white, the black out curtains had me sleeping way too late... the shower pressure is awesome, and I didn't want to get out.The cons: the absolute most ridiculous breakfast we had... $36 for 2 eggs, toast, 4 tiny potato pieces, juice and coffee. Really? This is insane. We also ordered the ""millionaires bacon"" or something, which was a thick (like half inch) piece of super  fatty meat with an odd spice on it, for another $12. Everything at the restaurant was overpriced. They never refilled my water once, never cleared empty plates and oddly starting resetting the place settings while we sat there. The coffee cups sat empty through our entire breakfast, and then they just reset around them. Weird.In addition, we returned early to find housekeeping in our room and we let her know we didn't care about vacuuming and she could be finished. When we went in, there were two items from the mini bar sitting by the Tv, with two missing spots for the items in the fridge. This wouldn't be a big deal, if the guy checking us in didn't tell us that sometimes the bills are wrong and add charges from the mini bar since it's super sensitive and weighted and will charge you. Not sure why anyone was in our minibar, but the maid said it was there when she came in, which it was NOT when we left. We had never even opened the bar. And the items were sitting there, unopened. We called the front desk who said the charges were not on our bill. So it's a mystery.We ordered room service the first night, which was expensive but mostly pretty good. The Caesar salad was not edible. It was soaking in dressing. Literally took one bite and placed back on tray.Also, part of our curtains were falling off and looked like they were glued on. And, there was def a critter I'm hoping in the wall, otherwise it sounded like it was under the bed.This is in a great spot, and a pretty hotel. The staff is amazing, but we probably won't be back.",1,,

10,Moses A.,"Middleton, WI",2,69,120,2.0,10/26/2018,"This seems to be a great hotel, at a great location, and at a reasonable cost for what it offers (low-500s for one of the nicer rooms). I almost booked two rooms there for 8 nights. Almost. I discovered the hotel charges $16 a night for Wifi, which, in 2018, is like charging $16 a night for pillows: I can live without, but shouldn't have to. So I chose a different hotel, not because I liked it better (Lotte was my top choice)  but to punish the practice of charging for Wifi.  Airbags used to be an ""option"" in cars too, but now they're standard.  Time to get with the times, folks!",,,
11,Chanel H.,"San Francisco, CA",412,187,2023,3.0,10/12/2017,"Arrived here at 630AM from a redeye  flight. We knew it was definately too early to check in but they kindly checked our bags. We killed time enjoying pastries at the cute shop inside this hotel, Pomme Palais then explored the city-fastfoward to 1:30, they said 1 of our 2 rooms were ready and they'd call us once the other room was cleaned. All of us hung out in room1 until 2:30. Since check-in is usually at 3  we gave them extra time & waited til FOUR o'clock but was still left without a room, we called just to have the phone continuously ring without any answer. We went downstairs & saw a crowd of angry people trying to check-in. They lack communication here! There was a new shift of front desk associates that didn't know about our situation (we were also sent up the wrong car of luggage). It's such a  beautiful hotel I am surprised how unorganized front desk is..i still gave them 3 stars because the bell associates are friendly & helpful...maybe it was an off day..ill update after my 4th night here.",7,5,4
12,Kb B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,4,5.0,6/12/2018,"8 girlfriends of mine stayed here for a bachelorette party. During the first 2 hours, I would have given our rating a 2, because of some mishaps, but the Lotte team went above and beyond to make sure our stay was amazing. My bachelorette group was supposed to have early check in at 10:45am on a Friday. We called the day before to confirm our early check-in time too, and they said everything was a-ok. When we got there, we were told our rooms wouldn't be ready until 3pm. We had 8 girls there, who needed their rooms to change and shower, after a morning barre class (everyone was gross and sweaty & had to change before we could go do anything else in the city). It was a bit of a disaster, but a kind man named Matt showed us up to the 8th floor spa where there were showers and robes for us to get ready. He also helped us store our luggage, but made sure it was available if we needed to get anything out of it. While waiting, they gave our girls a complimentary Gossip Girl tour for our inconvenience. We were supposed to have a brunch with bagels and pastries in one of our hotel rooms to kick off the weekend, but since we couldn't get into our rooms, the Lotte team -- especially Miles -- helps us set up a brunch out on the patio. They brought us a champagne bucket and glasses and made sure we had everything we needed. Miles was especially attentive to us during our patio brunch, and came to check on us multiple times. Because of the mishap, the concierge made sure we had a prime cathedral view and that both of the rooms were put beside each other. The second night we were there, Miles brought us all boxes of specialty chocolates to our rooms and sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne. Normally, I would have had my feathers very ruffled about the mishap that took up two of my bachelorette trip, but the Lotte showed how stellar customer service is supposed to work, and did all they could to make the situation right. It was easy to show some grace seeing how much they cared about making the situation right. Every detail about the hotel is pristine and beautiful. It will make you feel like you have no cares in the world while you are staying -- the only thing I have to critique them on are their bar prices. My girls paid $30 for 1 mimosa, which is absolutely insane, even for NYC prices. I will absolutely stay here every time i come to visit NYC - the bar is set too high now to go anywhere else. Bravo, Lotte!",1,,
13,Jackie G.,"Jersey City, NJ",240,205,165,5.0,12/10/2017,Went to the hotel for drinks and the magic show and had an overall enjoyable experience with a few flaws...1) parking at the palace is impossible2) the reminder email invites you to have drinks in the lobby bar BUT FOR 2PM SHOWS NONE OF THE BARS ARE OPEN. They open at 3 and the restaurant stopped serving at 1. 3) this is a very expensive magic show at a high end hotel... surely they could afford a coat check... but instead there is a a crowded coat rack. Odd choice considering they ask you to dress in cocktail attire. 4) the show tix: general admission tickets apply only to the 4th row (there are only 4 rows). So basically they charge extra for the majority of the room. Tip: the dress code is suggested not enforced. But the hotel is beautiful (especially the courtyard) and the show is very entertaining.  The staff inside the hotel was friendly and helpful. Bathrooms were lovely.,1,,

Updated review","Love this place and so do the kids. We upgraded to the tower and got the 51st floor! Amazing views, bigger room, just a great hotel! The staff is very friendly and helpful! This is definitely luxury! Some issues and why 2 out of 5 stars - bed was a SUNK in and also very uncomfortable. Anytime my toddler moved we both (husband and myself) felt it like we were on an air mattress. Not something I'd expect from such a high end hotel bed. Room 5104. Surprised that a bed was so bad, but I didn't complain. There aren't many electric outlets and none by one side of the bed. Doesn't make sense. Also, housekeeping came but didn't give us new blankets after I left the notecard out to change sheets,  and I left blankets on the floor. My daughter threw up and the housekeeper simply refolded the blanket and put it back like it was clean. Either that was laziness or she should have more training on what's clean/dirty, as it was very obvious there was throw up or something on the blanket. Pic posted*",1,,
15,Angela M.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,282,242,5.0,3/26/2018,"Such an amazing hotel with a prime location. The interior is so classy and regal really does look like a palace. The outdoor terrace courtyard is charming and has a beautiful view of st Patrick's church. Great walking distance to Times Square and Central Park, shopping and restaurants.

16,Ken P.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,254,189,4.0,12/12/2017,"I don't know if its fair to Yelp about a place when you were just doing some touristy sightseeing but that was my goal and plan when I passed by the Lotte New York Palace.  I had just left Rockefeller Center and needed to sit for a moment and gather my wits.  As I neared their space, I noticed a wonderful tree which made for a striking visual on our city streets.  The later hour meant that I didn't have a lot of people in my shot and since their were some pairs of people snapping each other I assisted in the group shot needs.  Why not leave people with a good impression of the place when its possible.Since people were milling in and out I went inside to warm up and look around the lobby where other holiday decorations were sensibly set up.  It was a comfortable setting and I am sure that guests are treated well here.  If you are doing any sort of holiday visual hunting like I was, you should make this a stop and perhaps even have a drink at their bar.  I didn't based on the hour but for sure the next time its a plan.  Thanks for letting me triage Lotte.  We surely appreciated it.",,,
17,Laura G.,"Seattle, WA",163,151,66,4.0,3/29/2018,"I visited the Lotte NYC Palace on my most recent trip to NYC.  In early January I came across a special reduced rate sale - only lasted 2 days.  The rooms were about $220 per night if you prepaid, so I went ahead and grabbed two nights.  I was in NYC celebrating my birthday, so was looking forward to staying here!STAFF - I found most of the staff great.  The concierge desk was outstanding, bellman / luggage desk was also super helpful and great.  Guest services went above and beyond, and even left a delish cake in my room to help me celebrate my birthday.  It said ""Happy 18th Birthday"", which was quite a few birthdays ago, but I loved it anyway, and totally saved the card.  Front desk staff was about 50/50.  Half were great and super accommodating.  Half were kinda cranky and over it.  I didn't interact with the restaurant staff, or the magic show staff, so no comment there.ROOM - we got a room on the 10th floor, and I was kind of bummed to find out that the view was basically of a gray wall of another building.  I asked to be moved for our second night, and kind of hilariously, we got moved to a higher floor, but had pretty much the same view as before, just from the 22nd floor.  So I believe the lesson is that if you get a reduced rate here, you aren't gonna have a view.  I get it, it's fine.The room itself was great, super clean and gorgeous.  Molton Brown shampoos and toiletries, which I ended up liking more than I thought I would.  Heads up - the do not disturb button is by the bedside.  Classin' it up.AREA - Lotte is in Midtown Manhattan, right across from St Patricks.  I so wish I had had a cathedral view room.  The cathedral was gorgeoussssss.Overall, I'd definitely stay here again, and hopefully will have a better view from my room for my next visit.",1,,
18,Amber M.,"Dallas, TX",81,63,0,5.0,7/3/2018,Visited Lotte New York Palace during April 2018.  The weather in NYC during our visit was only so-so and was still pretty cold.  The hotel had doormen with umbrella's and patio heaters for waiting outside for taxi's.  The hotel is gorgeous.  The gardens are gorgeous.  The location can't be beat.  The view from our room overlooked St. Patrick's Cathedral and was breathtaking.   Very close access to the trains.  Hotel staff were very courteous and professional. Catered to our every whim.  They were even kind enough to leave a macaroon amenity and a card thanking us for our stay.,1,1,1

20,Anne C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",97,121,353,1.0,1/4/2018,"We have stayed at this hotel a few years ago & decided we wanted to stay there again this new year holiday.  We were a group of 6 people and had reserved 3 deluxe king rooms at the Lotte New York Towers Hotel. We checked in & were shown to our rooms, the rooms are a nice size however the towels, bedding & robes are very worn out & old. The robes had holes in them & the sheets had yellow stains & blood stains on them. The hotel definitely does not live up to its 5 star status. The shades & drapes in 2 of our rooms opened every hour at night & the people in those rooms did not get any sleep. The managers took off the charge for breakfast which does not justify the bad taste we were left with. I would not recommend this hotel as a 5 Star more like a 3 Star. Also this hotel does not have a friendly lobby or a restaurant just for breakfast & lunch, only room service after lunch. In our prior visits there was a restaurant & a place in the lobby to just sit & enjoy, I was very disappointed.",2,,1

26,Ping G.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,18,41,2.0,3/12/2018,"It seems like the staff at Lotte, whether at the front desk, restaurant, spa, are trained to be aggressive and extract as much additional services or fees from you as possible.  It's odd since it's supposedly a high-end hotel.The wait staff at the Villard restaurant are hit or miss.  I ate breakfast there three times and the waiter we had the first and third mornings named Shoyeb (so?) made condescending comments about how little food I ordered.  Our bills came out to be around $80 each time so I don't see what his problem was.I had a $100 credit for the spa which I used for a manicure.  The manicure was listed as $80 on the website but upon arriving, the spa receptionist charged an additional $25 for something I didn't ask for.  After tax and tip (which they include) the bill was a regular manicure came out to be $130.When I was checking out, the person at the front desk, Alfred, was extremely rude and hostile.  When I asked him for a breakdown of the spa service, he said he couldn't see it and instead, called the spa and handed me the phone.  After I asked about the upcharge (which the receptionist couldn't explain), I handed back the phone to Alfred and told him that the hotel really should list the price accurately or instruct their spa staff to not upcharge for services not asked for.  Alfred started interrupting me before I even finished and kept telling me he couldn't do anything about it.  I let him know that I wasn't asking for the charge to be removed but that I wanted to provide feedback about my stay.  He kept interrupting me and telling me that I would have to talk to a spa manager.I wanted to give Alfred feedback about my stay but since he didn't want to listen, I'm leaving this negative review instead.",2,,

The staff is super friendly and helpful, especially when it comes to restaurant referrals. They also have a super yummy cafe with fantastic cheesecake. Room service was always super quick and the food was delicious.

I owe it all to the Palace. Perhaps, as a millennial, I was drawn in by the connection with Chuck Bass, but boy am I glad I was.I was traveling through NYC for work and on to Fire Island for family over a long weekend in July. I figured hotel prices in the city would be absurd at this point, but my office was next door to the Palace and I was crossing my fingers. I booked the Palace for a Thursday night, and was shocked at how affordable it was.After an early and long train ride, and even longer taxi ride, I was greeted by incredibly professional staff. It was too early to check in, so I left my bags and headed over to the office. Within an hour, the concierge called my cell phone to let me know they were able to get my room ready, they had upgraded me to a better room, AND my bags were already up there. I was so relieved.This was by far the most comfortable hotel room I have ever stayed in, and I travel quite a bit. The bed (California king?) was SO comfortable, with the fluffiest pillows. The room was spacious and clean, and the bathroom was well-stocked with everything I could possibly need. I never wanted to leave.

The real star however, is Teodora. We came to Lotte for drinks, but return for that and her company! Right off the bat, she made my friend and I feel like we were a cross between old friend and esteemed guests. She went through the menu with us in detail and offered drinks based on our tastes and personality with astonishing accuracy-there wasn't a single drink that was brought that we didn't like.

I stayed here for Christmas (23-27) & i would think they would throw in some cookies or something to make our stay special around the holidays but they didn't do anything to make it feel more cozy. the staff just doesn't make you feel welcomed Plus, for the money you can go somewhere nicer where you at least feel a little more appreciated. Wifi was literally $17 a day.. what the hell. I already spent so much money on a hotel why would I pay for wifi.. had to use all my data at the hotel which is extremely annoying. While the rooms were okay, this definitely isnt the best place to stay for Christmas.. no atmosphere at all, no reason to stay here",1,,

41,Kris T.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,55,26,1.0,9/11/2018,"We stayed at the property on August 22, 2015. We were awakened in the middle of the night by the room next door (3014) with screaming, walls shaking, furniture and bodies being tossed around. This went on for hours until the police were called since Hotel Security could not contain the problem. Not only were we frightened but we had to wake at 3 am for our flight to the West Coast making us feel like we had no sleep. The tub was plugged so we stood in 6 inches of water and lights were not functional. Sheets were like cardboard and the pillows smelled like body odor. Out of all this, the most shocking was that the hotel manager has yet to call and apologize or remediate the charges in some regard. We have called four times and complained upon leaving at the front desk. Unreal that no one would call us. We will never be back and we will not advocate that our companies do business with this place again.",,,

My God daughter was surprised to receive all the pomp and circumstance and was almost in tears going through her gift box.  The hotel was just perfect and kudos to you and your staff for a First Class hotel.  I wanted to add a couple of additional comments.   Tonya in the bar was very friendly and I enjoyed chatting with her.  We ordered room-service twice during our stay (I never have high hope for room-service) 1) Thursday - crab cakes and fries and 2) Saturday breakfast.  The crab cakes were divine and honestly, I have not had such wonderful fries and we got A TON!!   I took a picture of my breakfast on Sat and put it on Instagram b/c it was LITERALLY the BEST breakfast burrito I have EVER had!   Living in Texas we eat breakfast tacos/burritos all the time.  I would LOVE for the chef to teach me how to make eggs like this!

46,Danny S.,"Loma Linda, CA",83,571,2,5.0,11/13/2017,"We booked this hotel via Jetblue vacation package.  It got great reviews and was moderately priced (for a NYC Midtown hotel).  My friends stayed here before and suggested it.  The place was packed the whole weekend.  Lots of conferences seems to take place here.  I would definitely try to stay here again if possible.HOtel/Location:  Great location in midtown.  Within walking distance to quite a few things (ie central park, time square, empire state, shopping, etc.) I liked how you can enter the hotel from 3 different streets. The hotel was taken over about 1-2 years ago and they seemed to have kept every as is and in good condition.  No signs of aging.  The lobby is not terribly large but there are more sitting room as you walk in. My biggest gripe would be the elevators.  There are 6 main ones but too forever.  The tower side was even worse.  Only 2 and seems to crawl. I utilized the fitness room and thought it was pretty good.  PLenty of treadmills and elliptical.  They even have a concept 2 rower (very rare to find).  They had plenty of free weights including a bench press rack (very rare as well).  They seem to want to cater to every type of fitness.  They offer cool towels and water dispenser.  The locker rooms were also pretty nice.  Complimentary lockers and steam room for use.  If you can't check into your room after a red eye, go and take a shower there.  There was no free wifi (which is weird).Checkin and Service: I emailed the hotel ahead of time requesting an early check in.  We arrived at 10am and fortunately they had a room for me.  My other friends' rooms were ready about 2-3 hours later.  Service appears pretty good throughout.  They offer a house car for use (within 20 blocks), but it never seemed to be available. The fitness room attendant was really nice and helpful.  Housekeeping was great as well.Room:  They must have remodeled fairly recently.  Our room seemed pretty nice and large for an NYC hotel.  We had 2 beds (full, not queens) and there was still room for a small table and 2 chairs.  Our friend's room (2 queen) over in the Towers was significantly larger.  The bathroom was a decent size.  Toilet had weak flushing ability and clogged on the last day.  The bathtub and shower were decent with good water pressure.  Bathroom amenities included the basic lotion, shampoo, and soap.  No toothbrush.  It wasn't over the top by any means.  The TV was adequate size.  There were no USB plugs.  But fair amount of regular plugs.  We were on the 31st floor and it was fairly quiet and dark.All in all, we had a great stay.  I would recommend this hotel to others.",,,

48,Yuqing L.,"New York, NY",61,261,690,5.0,7/14/2016,"I know this place first from Gossip Girl - like most people do... It is a beautiful and high-end restaurant located in the heart of Manhattan. I first came here this summer for a friend's wedding. I have to say its exterior is better than the interior. It looks spacious and elegant from outside, but from inside, it gets back to a normal grand restaurant similar to others. They offered both cocktail hours and dinner here. The cocktail session offered both hot stations (consist of Chinese and western styles of food) and cold palates. All taste great to me. Dinner was held in a ball room. Food was not as good as the cocktail hour. I guess cooking food for a big group of people is always difficult and can drag down the overall food level. But the good impression from the cocktail hour makes me believe the food level and cooking style of this place.",1,,1

I could have slept for days there! It was also quiet and with fantastic views of the city.They put a special note on my reservation since it was for the wedding, and we were truly treated like a king and queen! Even though our wedding wasn't at the hotel, they upgraded our room (hello, corner room with a view!) as well as the room of my maid of honor. All of the staff were so kind and cheery with us throughout.Plus, after our wedding day, we came back to the room to a big surprise! They left us a complimentary selection of treats with a sweet little congratulations note: a platter of chocolate covered strawberries, sparkling wine on ice, champagne flutes, 2 giant bottles of water (which is what we really needed!!!), and a selection of fruits. It was such a special gesture that made the stay truly memorable for us.Thank you, Lotte staff!!",,,
50,Moses S.,"Austin, TX",234,169,264,5.0,4/18/2016,"A great, if not one of the best, hotel by any standard.Room: 5/5Amenities: 5/5Service: 5/5Ambience: 5/5Location: 5/5Quality: 5/5The New York Palace Hotel, now Lotte New York Palace, is a beautiful hotel inside and out. The Villard Mansion, which is the building encompassing the entrance, the grand lobby, as well as the function rooms of the hotel, is an absolute classic that will keep this hotel in business along with the location. The entrance and the grand lobby could be lit up more to drive home the brilliant, golden image it brings, but that's just my two cents.The rest of the building was equally eye catching. Of course, the classic decor might drive away some millennials that want minimalist W, or modern Park Hyatt-ish interior designs, but to each their own. A classic will always remain appreciated by those who are also timeless. And those who have done their research will know that the New York Palace has something for everyone. Some of the Tower Suites offer the most modern yet elegant designs for everyone's taste.As for my personal experience, I first booked this hotel with skepticism. Full disclosure - I'm Korean like Lotte, which actually was my employer for a while. Having worked as its Seoul Hotel HQ key account manager, I could see why Lotte was aggressive in acquiring the New York Palace. The similarities are uncanny. The twist is that I personally left the hotel after a year for various reasons. I do keep in touch with a few former colleagues but I never received any preferential treatment in booking, discount in rates, or service through them. In short, I didn't tell a single person during the stay that I used to work for Lotte at a managerial position. I was pleasantly surprised to see a Korean employee in front of the reception desk ready to greet guests. Her name was Younha Lee, and I have a feeling she was from Seoul. But the real star of the hotel was Sandy, the receptionist, who checked us in. Sandy was informative, quick, and thoughtful. She checked us in a bit earlier since we arrived early. Knowing it was our anniversary, Sandy upgraded us to the room with a great view on the 38th floor without us begging for it. We knew immediately that our stay was going to be wonderful.The room was also quite pleasant. The bed was comfortable, the headboard brought some elegance to it, the TV, and the desk were all easy on the eyes and high quality. The best part of these rooms, of course, is the view. The view from our room on the 38th floor captured a huge portion of Midtown Manhattan. It was as if someone painted Upper East Side. St. Patrick's Cathedral being the centerpiece, the Rockefeller center and nearby skyscrapers decorated every corner of the view with beauty.The day we checked out, we found out that a complimentary gift was not delivered to our room but we were fine with that considering we were pretty much out of the hotel meeting friends and having fun from early morning until late hours. And the concierge brought the wrong bag the first time, but his sincerity made up for the confusion. Now, if you were thinking I must be biased since I had some connection with Lotte, I hope my mention of the two mistakes offset it. With all honesty, I went as a complete stranger to the hotel, and am reviewing as a totally neutral party. Also, in case you are wondering, not all rooms have free wifi.All in all, a great hotel - Could do (much) better with marketing and PR, but I'm sure it'll get there. I highly recommend the New York Palace.",3,,1

Unfortunately, self-importance seems frequent in high-end places like the Lotte New York Palace. The hotel rests at a top-tier location with access to many great landmarks. I opted to order Indian takeout, having it delivered to the hotel lobby - thankfully no one gave me hell about this.

We'd like to write this review to give extra 5 stars to one of the staff members Maurice, he heard us chatting about gossip girl like many visitors as it has been a big filming location, and instead of rolling his eyes at us tourists - he gave us a full tour of all the filming rooms! We truly appreciated his time and hospitality. He went above and beyond and was a friendly face to us each morning in the lobby.

67,Mama S.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,16,0,4.0,9/13/2018,The Staff here are amazing... every morning reception is met with an angry mob of travelers who arrive to NYC from all over the world and want to check in early. I was one of those people overtired from a redeye from California. They took our bags and gave us options for waiting like... try the spa etc. I chose walking around midtown and then trying out the patio bar for happy hour. The patio is gorgeous with a view of St Patricks- dont miss it! Yes it is expensive because it is Midtown NY and it is very touristy. So be ready. It is a block away from one the most expensive shopping in the city if not the country. Get a grasp on where you are and just decide that $18 prosecco is going to be the new normal. It's fine...you only live once. The room was cozy. Two beds and a decent view. We got a special so I'm going to bet there are much better views but I was pleased just to see city lights and have a clean bed. The housekeeping was fine. I did not actually eat at the hotel... I am sure it is expensive. Coffee and food are literally across the street so I just took a walk every morning to one of the great places nearby and got breakfast. No coffee machine in the room fyi. No fridge. If this is your first time in NYC and you want to be in the middle of things then this is a great place. If you are on a tight budget then stay elsewhere in midtown. I loved the building it is really gorgeous and you really feel like you are experiencing something special when you stay here. You can walk for blocks and blocks and see virtually dozens of sights. Stress free. This is perfect for people who dont know thier way around NYC. Just get out and walk and you will hit a landmark without trying. Enjoy!,,,

78,S H.,"Dublin, OH",0,12,0,5.0,4/13/2017,"We stayed here here in March 2017. Let me start by listing the hotels that I have stated at in NYC. The London, Penthouse Suite, St Regis, Waldorf Astoria, Sixty Soho, The Essex House. If all of the above listed... THIS WAS MY BEST STAY!!! To say the staff is friendly is an understatement. They were so welcoming. The in-room dining was delicious and quick. Location is prime. Close to the Rock and The best shopping on the planet. Our room was spacious and clean. I screwed up the reservation and put my family in (2) double beds rather than (2) Queens. I didn't say anything, but learned that those rooms were possibly located in another part of the hotel called the Towers. You wouldn't even know there was a nicer option because the standard accommodations are so nice. We like to to try new hotels, but have said many times since leaving.....I don't think we could stay anywhere else, we enjoyed it that much. Next time we are trying the Towers.

79,Linna F.,"New York, NY",34,375,67,5.0,6/23/2016,"Phenomenal property, customer service, and great experience!We recently stayed 2 nights at the Towers at Lotte New York because I was getting married in the city and wanted to have a ""home base"" for the night before and for getting ready the day of the wedding. The Towers at Lotte New York caught my eye because I was looking for a central, midtown location that had a beautiful area where my now-husband and I could have our ""first look."" There is a central grand staircase in the lobby that is so beautiful and I knew this would be the place for us.I booked a Towers King, and when I mentioned that I was getting married the following day, Melody kindly gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite! It was such a wonderful gesture, and gave us a ton of room for me to get ready and have my bridesmaids get ready with me. The rooms were well-appointed, with digital touch-screen consoles to control the lighting, window shades, etc. The facilities are pristine, and housekeeping was courteous. We even received a plate of chocolates with a note congratulating us on our just getting married. It was very lovely. My family stayed in a room within the Lotte New York Hotel and enjoyed their lovely accommodations as well. The location overlooks St. Patrick's Cathedral and is close to many things (including Central Park, not far from Rockefeller Center) - it's a good location in midtown. Though there is no restaurant on site, it was very easy to exit the lobby and walk down 1 - 2 blocks on Madison Avenue - there is a deli, Starbucks, Pret A Manger, and plenty of other places to eat. Also, you're in NYC - don't be afraid to wander more than 5 blocks outside of the hotel's radius.The hotel is also very close to the E/M subway station at 53rd Street and 5th Avenue, as well as the 6 train at 51st and Lexington Avenue. I would not hesitate to recommend the Lotte New York Palace/Towers at Lotte New York as a great place to stay in the city - accommodations are luxurious with matching costs, but the service, cleanliness, and overall comfort and aesthetic was wonderful, and I would definitely stay here again!!!",2,,1

Updated review","This is my favorite place to stay when in NYC! Loved everything about it....staff super friendly, their bakery Pomme Palais was the perfect start to our day, we had room service and our dinner was fantastic!  Rooms are super impressive......an overall FIVE STAR place!  Can't wait to book my next stay there",,,
81,Jason L.,"Altadena, CA",2,19,0,3.0,8/21/2018,"Nice building in a great neighborhood.  Most of the staff was great.  My wife and son took a red eye from the west coast, and my mother-in-law (who is a native New Yorker and fairly savvy) was assured that they would have a room.  Now, maybe she was naive and mistaken, but she claims that they assured her a room would be available for them to bunker down in and have a nap.  Nope.  They were told that it was a ""request"" and that the request was denied.  They were left in the lobby for over 5 hours, falling asleep in corner couches, kicked out of several areas, while the staff seemed to not care.  I understand that miscommunications happen, but I cannot believe that there was no place for them to rest up, while their eventual room was set up.  And the front desk staff could not have been less helpful.  The reason I give the hotel at least three stars is that my experience with the hotel AFTER that was great.  All staff was courteous, and very helpful.  It's a shame that the first incident colored the whole experience.  There are a few other annoyances that come with high end hotels, but they were quickly remedied.  I'm still miffed about the whole ""leaving my family in the lobby"" for several hours, but overall the hotel is good to great.  Let's clean up that New York indifference a little and get those ratings up.",,,
82,Chris A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,14,4.0,6/13/2018,"This is my go to hotel in midtown. Great location, nice staff, and a solid bar lobby level that's open fairly late. It's the perfect place for a wind down drink after a business dinner. The rooms are large by NYC standards, room service is quick and good, they can press your suits in the blink of an eye, quiet, great beds, the gym is passable...what else go you need in a business hotel?",,,
83,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,5.0,4/14/2015,"The New York Palace Hotel off Madison Avenue is my favorite hotel not just in NY, but in the country. I know, I'm from NY. Why would you stay at a hotel in NY ?! Well the palace has been a meeting spot for me and my friends. As well as some other hotels in manhattan. But the palace far exceeds the other hotels. The reason being, the staff is amazing here. The hotel has a small opulent feel very cozy. Classy style. Where some Some of the other hotels are so massive. They lack a relaxing feel to them. Back to the staff. Everytime I have come here someone from there staff always says hi to me. The last time that I went here I was walking into a local bar that they have in the hotel two of their staff members asked me how my day was going they also asked me if I would like a complementary macaroon. I told him that I was not staying at the hotel I was just meeting a friend for a drink at troubles. Both of the girls were so friendly they started a conversation with me and we just talked about life and a bunch of different topics. Then the staff member asked if she could take my coat and check it for me. I had a driver one night that was supposed to be picking me up from The palace. I told one of the doorman that if he could just let me know when the vehicle pulled up. Long story short I get a phone call from the driver that said that he is a block and a half away from the hotel and he cannot pull in to the pick up and drop off area of the hotel. I let the doorman know this he mediately contact the concierge had concierge take somebody and walk me all the way a block and a half down to get into this vehicle. The staff you're just goes above and beyond. I know that this hotel is a bit pricey but it's New York City it's a five-star hotel hands-down and you do get what you pay for. For food options here they do have a couple different places as well as a 24 hour in room dining service. There is a bakery called pomme palas. It's a good place for breakfast they have all sorts of French inspired baked goods. There are 2 bars/lounges here. There is Troubles Trust and the tavern on 51. Both have good drinks I do prefer troubles it's a little bit more secluded they like candles on the table the drinks are about $20 a drink and troubles but they make a good drink. The only issue that I do have with the hotel is there are a lot of Tourists that come to this hotel just to take photos and they stand around in the lobby, looking around aimlessly and taking photos. I recommend taking the elevators if you're going to go up floors because a lot of people take photos on the stairs and they block the entire staircase!Overall the palace is my favorite hotel it's a good place to meet up with friends if you're available if not, the palace is def something that you would want to see one point in your life. The staff is great here. just remember it is expensive but you do get what you pay for. PROS:- staff is amazing- good place to meet friends for a drink- 5 star hotel CONS:- a lot of tourists taking photos",6,1,1
84,Christina W.,"Manhattan, NY",327,8,0,2.0,9/18/2017,"Overall I was disappointed. I booked it as my wedding night sweet, also for getting ready with my bridal party. They refused to give any visibility on the possibility of checking in 2 hours early until the morning of the wedding. They gave us a bigger room than booked, but it wasn't particularly nice, which surprised me given the price tag. Lastly, when my husband accidentally dropped his keys in the gap of the elevator doors and it fell down the shaft (there's a big gap by the elevator door), they called back at 2am and 3:30am to tell us that they couldn't find the keys and that it's really not their problem and it was a big ask - why not just say that up front instead of calling us all night?",1,1,

Pourquoi??. .. Mystery, but okaaaaay).It's very easy to feel fancy here.  I had to get over the fact that a single glass of wine costs like $42, but I got ahold of myself and did so very quickly because what's the point in arguing?  Part of what you're paying for is the rental on your A Plus location, A Plus Service, A Plus Views, A Plus convenience and A Forementioned feeling of fancy.It is true you are paying a lot, but it's also true you very much get what you pay for AND THEN SOME.  I just think if you were to put a price on all the non-tangibles here, you really are getting an amazing value here.",6,3,6
90,Hillenbrand H.,"Summit, NJ",11,65,390,5.0,1/18/2017,"The Lotte Palace was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. This was 5-star high class all the way. I had no desire to ever venture out of this peaceful oasis but I wound up going out a few times. Ava, the very professional and charming guest agent checked me in. Ava was the kinds of employee you want your guests to have their first point of contact with. She was very professional and executed her duties with precision, class and a welcoming demeanor. After telling her I was there to celebrate my 50th birthday, she told me she could not believe I was 50! She then proceeded to put me on the 39th floor, center facing the St. Patrick's Cathedral. Room 3920. Kudos Ava! Kudos. Everything about the room was 1st class. Nothing was dated or out of place. Golden and soft yellow hues abound. The room looked right out onto the cathedral. There was no obstructions to be seen. Just a view of this magnificent city as far as one could see. The floor I was on was very quiet, but I am sure, due to the high quality of this hotel's clientele, that no floor was in possession of patrons who sought a more lively environ. This place was boring in a good way. You didn't come here to be a part of the Broadway and Times Square crowd. You came to escape that. The  bathroom was palatial, as was the shower. I actually felt guilty enjoying this much space in a shower by myself but I am not the type of man to look for a pity date for a milestone celebratory occasion (my 50th birthday). I enjoyed this weekend solo and it was the most stress free and fulfilling weekend I have had in a long time. back to the bathroom. There were Molton Brown toiletries set in a nice silver plated tray and the towels were literally like runner rugs. Triple thick rug runners. The king-sized bed was simply out of this world. If I wasn't so eager to go out and eat at the Lincoln Square Steakhouse, I would never have left the room (That venture out was well worth the trip). The linens were crisp and comfy. And the view? I was looking right out onto St. Patrick's Cathedral. The spires of this holy edifice rose up like a crown into the sky. You must visit this institution if you stay here. The inside is just as majestic as the outside. You can ride the elevators up and down and just soak in the grandeur of the entire experience. I was very careful to refrain from using the stocked items in the refrigerator and the food tray. The prices are insane. I believe a 10 oz bottle of Coke was $6.00. I was craving for some reason, chocolate and salty nuts so I took the bait. The Dean & Deluca Nuts ($10.89) and chocolate ($6.53) set me back $17.42. You can feed 2 people at Chipotle's for this amount. Was it worth it? It was D and D for Christ's sakes! A spectacularly exquisite indulgence on my 50th birthday. No regrets. I had pastries  and coffee from Pomme Palais, where many have sung their priases for having the city's best macaroons. The chocolate eclairs looked tempting but I went with a chocolate pastry, excuse me, a pain au Chocolat. I got a few other things and my bill came to $18.45. If you do not eat here, get a box of goodies to go. The blueberry tarts looked like a work of art from behind the case. There are too many ooooos and ahhhss to write about and I am just touching on the parts of the hotel I experienced. I take it the patio is a very popular lunch spot for local office folks because it was filling up fast when I sat out there after I had checked out. Great space and shade to enjoy a casual summer lunch. Staying at the Lotte New York Palace was definitely a splurge for me, but a splurge well worth the price. Kudos to Ava again for helping me to start my birthday off right!",3,2,2

Wifi!!! Please. Mini bar, over the top expensive- no free water!!! Just really not going to earn 5 stars with this stuff, it is cheap.

92,Ariel B.,"Tampa, FL",119,10,0,1.0,5/5/2018,"We have stayed here many times. This time, for an important occasion, the problem began at check-in. We used a travel agent to book us and our parents. After going up to the room, we were unsatisfied by how dark it was with a view to a building wall. Our parents had a cathedral view. We needed some light so went back to the front desk to request a room change. At first, a lady named Nora refused saying they were fully booked. After we described how bad the room was, she took personal offense, said ""you can't talk to me like this"" and ""I won't take this kind of treatment"".  She made us feel like unruly troublemakers. It was pretty shocking. She then said we had to talk to a manager. Taylor the manager then came and suddenly found a corner room on a higher floor. So we go up but our keys don't work. So we return, he expresses surprise that our keys don't work, asks several times if we understand how to operate them (we have stayed here before and they are standard anyways) and then gave us new ones. A security guard met us and after seeing that our keys ""really"" don't work, called to get a maintenance guy to let us in. We are now late for our plans. They inform us that in order to fix the door problem, we have to stay in the room. We ask why and they say because your stuff is in there. We then ask why can a maid come in without us there? We went down again to speak to Taylor and he actually said ""I'm too busy, I'll talk to you later"". In sum, this is worst luxury hotel experience  we have ever had. Btw, if you do choose to book here, ask for a coffee maker in your room and then wait for it not to come. Update: we asked for the coffee maker again today and after 25 minutes got it. Upon checking out, we discovered that this $500+ night hotel charges $21 for a coffee maker and had charges us twice. No warning when we asked for one. Also they give you a $100 credit for breakfast every morning which feels huge but every morning every person we were with exceeded it by $10-20. We were not ordering anything fancy either. 2 eggs, toast and coffee for two people.",,,

Updated review","This review is for our hotel room 916.( I wrote a review for the staff in the gym and bellman, i still give them 5 stars.) So..Upon arrival to our room, I noticed there was water in the bathroom covered with a white face towel. It looked like some one forgot to pick it up when cleaning. I also noticed gray scratch marks on the toilet seats. It was very noticeable, about 3 scratch marks 1/2 inch long and 3 cm wide. I don't know where it came from, but I cleaned it up.  When i sat on the mattress I noticed the bed was not fully positioned onto of the frame, so we had to move it center. Other than that the view  of St Patricks cathedral was a plus. Everything else was clean. I've stayed in several hotels, and for a 5 star hotel, I was expecting higher standards of cleanliness.",,,

The Lotte is located on prestigious (455) Madison Avenue across from the famous St. Patrick's Cathedral and is now owned by an Asian multi-national corporation (Lotte Hotels)  but used to be the notorious Helmsley Palace (Queen of Mean).  It was later owned by the Sultan of Brunei.  I've been here under all owners and it is definitely way better managed now.Great service, luxury accommodations including spa and fitness center, pet friendly, business center, 24 hour laundry services and much more.",9,2,5

Literally the only thing I can complain about is the wifi is a little iffy, and they don't have a sit down breakfast restaurant anymore (just a little cafe)- but no big deal. My favorite part was the automated buttons that control the lighting in all parts of the room, and buttons to raise/lower the shades (my inner geek-ness totally came out when I got way more excited about this than a normal person should lol). Another favorite- they had slippers in the room which were a nice souvineer to take home (again cue overly excited reaction to when the front desk said I can take them home).

I have spent wondrous times here attending weddings, joining my mates at launch parties and also stopping over to see in the New Year more than once but, for this visit,  I was in-house for the Carl Frampton bout at the Barclays Center. Post fight, my favourite corner room overlooking St Paddy's was where I chose to lay my head but, before that, we celebrated Carl's crowning as WBA super featherweight champion with a mammoth session at the bar of Trouble's Trust. Good times indeed.It has been a while since my last trip to the Palace and it has been through a substantial revamp but the Grand Staircase, the Piano Man and that 'Touch of Class' still persist. Superb cordiality, K.O. food and attention to detail always ensures that the Palace will remain one of my favourite NYC drop spots.Hopefully, today's flight home will give me chance to re-hydrate and catch some Zzzzzzzzzzz's.

114,Linda J.,"Noord, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",45,167,2892,4.0,8/9/2014,"The New York Palace Hotel has been a staple in NYC forever. Location: Great location being right in midtown (50th and Madison Avenue).  Next to all of the 5th and Madison Avenues shopping, Rockefeller Center, short walk to Central Park and Grand Central Station if you need to catch the trains.Arrival: There are three different entrances to the hotel - 50th Street, 51st Street and Madison Avenue.  You should arrive on the 50th Street entrance (closest to reception) although its busy.  When we arrived there are people everywhere on the street (it's a busy part of town) and inside the lobby.  Luggage was everywhere on the floor and carts.  I understand it's summer and the hotel was full. Bellman: They were friendly and helpful.Reception/Front Desk: There's a semi circle desk of people ready to check you in.  The woman at reception was friendly.Lobby: The lobby area is ok, but feels old. They need to make it more welcoming in my opinion with more places to sit.Room: We were on the 33rd floor and the room layout is standard.  Walk in, closet on the right, bathroom on the left and the traditional square room.  The size was good. It was bigger than a standard room with plenty of space.View: We had a small view of the East River and lots of buildings of course.Bed: The king size bed was very comfortable.Bathroom: The bathroom was dated.  The size wasn't small, but it wasn't big.  The shower and bathtub was combined and old.. There was one sink, and the door placement wasn't ideal.  Hair dryer: The hair dryer was painfully slow.  Products: Molton Brown which are very nice.Closet: The closest was the usual good size.  They had plenty of hangers.  Ironing board and iron inside.Safe: One benefit of an old room/old hotel is an old safe.  It was the biggest safe I've ever seen in a hotel room and it was located in the closet.  Not sure what people would put in them back in the 80s.Control Panel: The control panel is the oldest control panel I've ever seen.  See pix.  It controlled the lights (sort of) and the AC.Minibar: Very standard with the traditional options.Mirrors: There were two large mirrors in the room. Housekeeping: Above average.Wifi: The wifi was slow and expensive.  I still don't understand hotels who charge for wifi.Dining Outlets I visited: - The Pomme Palais is a patisserie which was nice and they carry coffee, pastries and sandwiches.  I bought some macarons as a gift, but their morning sandwiches looked really yummy.- Their main restaurant Villard is obnoxiously expensive.  See my separate review on the one breakfast I had there.- I did not check out the bar.- They have a nice outdoor courtyard on Madison where you can sit and drink.Gym: Worked out one day and it's a well equipped gym.  It's a good size, not too big and not too small. Spa: Didn't check out the spa.Concierge: I didn't use the concierge because I lived in NYC for 15 years and didn't need help.  Style: No real style to this hotel.  It's one of those large traditional business hotels and it feels like it.  I heard the Towers are much nicer.  I know it's one place where all of the diplomats stay when they come into town for the UN General Assembly.Would I go back?  Yes.  There was nothing really ""wrong"" with the hotel.  It's a nice, clean and very centrally located.  I wouldn't rush back because it's a business hotel which is not my style of hotels.  Yes, I am a hotel snob - there I said it.",1,,

If you time it right you can usually find a fairly reasonable price for a room. The location is great if you're interested in staying in midtown and it really does have an old fashioned luxury feel. It's also a great place to people watch. The appearances on gossip girl are also a fun bonus to staying here. Stayed here recently with my family and I do have a few complaints. When we arrived in our room the throw pillows on the bed were clearly very dirty. It would've been impossible for the maid not to notice, so she must have simply not cared. We brought this to the attention of management and they quickly took care of it and sent us some fruit as an apology. The other complaint I would have is that the shower took over 5 minutes to warm up in the morning. I was almost late to work because of it!",2,,

After my first stay, I noted there's no coffee maker or tea service in the room. Well, my mother, who was my guest for the second stay, loves her black coffee and ""New York Times"" first thing in the morning. So the manager kindly noticed my request and we received the coffee and tea service just a few minutes after checking in.Mom, after enjoying her coffee and free newspaper, did run down to the Pomme Palais cafe to get one of their colorful, delicious eclairs! I had a pain au chocolat and we brought them to the nearby lobby lounge. We were on vacation yet surrounded by heavy-duty, well-dressed business people having early meetings. All blended well together and we felt comfortable whether dressed up or down.The room itself was spacious on both occasions and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've had.",,,

If you like luxury, if you like amazing staff that somehow caters to your every need, while not ever bothering you, than this is the place. We are very, very picky about hotels. We like beauty, opulence, 5 star, and the palace has it all. Not to mention we felt incredibly safe here. We tried the st. Regis and it was a small, awkward hotel. If anyone is trying to decide between the two, there's no comparison. The Palace is number one!",,,
121,p m.,"San Francisco, CA",8,9,0,4.0,7/10/2016,"I should start out by saying that I stayed here on someone else's dime - so I have very little to complain about for such a fantastic experience that I didn't have to foot the bill for.The Palace is fantastically located: St. Patrick's is right out my window, Rockefeller Center is a block away, Times Square is just a bit beyond, the park is within walking distance, et al. A perfect spot to stay for your first time in NYC checking all the must-see boxes. The room is infinitely more spacious than I had expected. I was anticipating a San Francisco-sized teeny tiny hotel room, but the King is a great size, with a very civilized desk next to the window. The bedding really is super comfortable. The fitness room on the 8th floor is great. We received a special deal and get $25 worth of Pomme Palais daily, giving us a great quick breakfast, along with free wifi....but the fact that I had to get a special deal in order to get free wifi in 2016 is definitely a negative. Charging for wifi?? Savages. And - no free water??? Gimme a break! (The water in the mini bar is 8$!!) This is NYC, and the location is really something special, so I guess overcharging is the name of the game and I shouldn't be surprised - but these things seem kinda egregious.Also contributing to the loss of a star: bathroom sink water pressure is virtually nonexistant, and that toilet flushes miiiiighty weakly. There was also some confusion about the details of our rooms that required some sorting out after check-in, and the front desk staff was certainly not completely polite or striving to make me feel like they were doing all the could to set things right. ...But set it right they did, and I'm having a really great stay at this beautiful, super central hotel.

123,Rachel S.,"Edmonds, WA",67,6,2,5.0,4/4/2017,"LOVED our stay here. We had a crazy whirlwind of a trip here in NYC for 3 days and this hotel was our peaceful place to rest and relax. So beautiful!!! We got to stay on the 14th floor, and we had a stunning view of St. Patrick's Cathedral. So luxurious and amazing location, walking distance from many major sightseeing highlights and only a couple blocks from the metro that took us anywhere we wanted to go. They provided 2 cribs for our babies right away and provided a travel pack of baby toiletries for each baby, which is a special touch. We were feeding our babies and accidentally spilled too many crumbs (so sorry!!) in our room and housekeeping was able to clean it up for us in a timely manner. Nice black out shade for the windows. Eating at the hotel restaurant was waaayy too expensive for us but there were nice, more affordable options close by. The best part of our stay was actually one of the Lotte staff, EMMA, a beautiful Irish lady. She was standing in the lobby and saw that I needed help with my luggage as my babies and I were waiting to be picked up to leave. She even waited with my luggage so I could take the babies to the restroom and we had an amazing conversation! She was genuinely interested in what we did and was so nice to my children. Emma was professional, as well as personable and didn't make us feel like she was talking to us just to do her job. She was such a fun person to talk to! She had to leave to go attend to another person and my husband had arrived with the car to pick us up and I was so sad I didn't have a chance to say goodbye, but Emma tracked us down just before we left and gave my babies teddy bears. What exceptional service and so special to add that personal touch to our stay at Lotte. I hope that Lotte will recognize the amazing quality that Emma adds to their hotel and treat her well!

We have to call again and got it around 10pm the night we have arrived. No one told us about there are $20 charge on it until later. That would be fine if the coffee machine is not filled with terrible mold old coffee (see the photo). It is disgusting, not to mention a terrible health hazard. I think the morning people from room service has been nice and tried to make up for the situation, but this is bad! Out of 4 nights, we got turn down only twice, which supposes to be every night. When we left with $0 bill from the hotel, they charged us more than $1500 in my credit card - that is just not unacceptable. When there are a few nice people there, most others are cold and distant.

Who'd say no to that?We were there for 4 nights.  The only thing that was outstanding about the experience was the quality of the food that came out of that kitchen.  It reminded me of some of the best foods I'd had in New York.  The only exception was the caviar at $200 per serving.  It was cheap caviar and the presentation by room service with the rose petals was silly and over the top.Now, for some of the more not so pleasant experiences.  I'll be a monkey's uncle if a maid did not just walk right in to our room with their own master keys every single day! Have the dead bolt on all the times if you're there.  I mean it was absurd! I was there with my little girl and I let her have the big bedroom, since she's a girl and I was spread out in the living room.  But within 1 second, a loud knock on the door with a loud announcement of ""housekeeping"" and in they come! I swear to you there's no pause there not even for a second.  Even if you were standing by waiting to reply and object to entry you would be out of luck.  On one particular occasion one of the housekeepers literally caught me with my pants down and it was embarrassing.Then there was that concierge! OMG! Could this guy be possibly less user friendly? Maybe he was over whelmed as it was a busy time of the year but it's NYC!We wanted to print some theater tickets and we left a good 1/2 hour for getting this done.  We waited in line for that 1/2 hour to be sent off to another part of the hotel, the business center.  When we got there, it was closed?? No we didn't get distracted and went directly there! A whole bunch of experiences like this within a 4 day stay makes for a very uncomfortable daddy.  I came out with my daughter to spend some quality time and it just seemed we were dealing with hotel problems every day!Again, it would be one star but for the food!",6,8,

137,Rick R.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,10,1,5.0,8/27/2017,"First time in years that we were in New York. Have previously stayed at the St. Regis, the Benjamin and wanted to try something new. We knew that there were great hotels downtown but thought that since we wanted to see the MoMA that we would stay close by. There are 2 separate parts to the Lotte NY Palace and I believe that we lucked-out by choosing the Towers. Since there were 3 of us, we needed a large enough space to fit us all and the Executive Suite certainly suited our needs. Approximately 655 sq. ft. with a separate bedroom and sliding-doors to close it off from the living room. Nice sofa pull-out bed for our son. We were on the 46th floor directly facing the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral (on Madison.) Really a wonderful view from Room 4615. The Towers also has its own check-in desk and elevators to the upper floors. As for the cost, I guess one can look it up and see online. We used American Airline miles to the tune of 437,000 miles. (you can figure the cost out if you would like and yes, its been years since we took a trip and thus the huge mileage saved up.)The overall feel of the hotel was one of quiet elegance. It was originally the Villard Mansion built in 1884 as a brownstone palazzo with a huge carriage court entrance. It has been restored to that elegance over the years. In the '80's it was The Helmsley Palace, run by Leonna H. herself; subsequently sold to the Sultan of Brunei and now presently owned by a Korean conglomerate. Everything was immaculate and one couldn't walk too far without seeing an employee willing to help. The service was excellent and each of our servers for breakfast in our room had spent a minimum of 25 years working at the hotel. Some of the other stand-outs are the main restaurant with the gilded ceiling and the 19thC. artwork on the walls. Clearly a mixture of business people and tourists enjoying themselves for meals. Though we did not use the gym, it is fairly extensive and certainly not crowded. The Spa was okay though the massage by Elayne was fantastic.Not much else to add other than we loved it and 5 nights went way too quickly.",,,

Had an okay view of construction, but I really couldn't complain, the room wasn't noisy, unlike some NYC hotels I have stayed at., and it was SOOO SPACIOUS. I've stayed in some tiny accommodations.

Let's just say the bed was not freshly turned over and there was human evidence to prove it.I call down and 3 maids rush up. They change the sheets, but then hurriedly try to leave. When I pointed out they hadn't changed the comforter cover they snip that they only do that when they reset a room for a new guest. Well I was a new guest, so they changed it and promptly fled the scene.Moments later I realized what had really happened... my room had been cleaned, but not turned over for a new guest. Sure enough there were used towels in the bathroom too. By this time it was too late to fight, I had a big day the next morning... so I carefully flipped through each towel until I found a (hopefully) clean one.We left so quickly I didn't have time to blow up at the manager. The folks that booked me here were able to get $100/night back (on a $400+/night rate), but if I were running the place the entire stay would be on me.

We talked for a few minutes about the city and he made great suggestions. The room, a Cathedral King on the 33rd Floor, was wonderful as well. Very quiet, beautiful views of Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, the Hudson, and more. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was great (and the maid even brought extra washcloths when asked), and everything was clean. My mother and sister did have a double with the opposite view on the 39th floor that looked a bit worn; the hotel does seem to be updating things where they can.Overall, I loved the service, the location, the lobby (and all its lounges and cafes), and the room with the view. I cannot wait to return during the warmer months to enjoy the garden courtyard.",1,,
145,Tiffany D.,"Palm Harbor, FL",77,26,11,4.0,9/16/2015,"I really wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't that great. I know New York is expensive and I was ready to spend more than usual, but to get a small bottle of water through room service would have been $20+. If I picked it up, it would have been about $12.The building is beautiful and the room was nice. The bed itself was very comfortable. It took awhile to get checked in and our room wasn't ready around noon (three hours before we were supposed to check in, so fine). The service was just ok, except from the Bell desk. Bell Captain William was super nice and accommodating. He really delivered 5-star service!!Overall, it was just meh. If I had paid half of what I paid, I'd be happy and if it weren't for Bell Captain William I'd be rating 2-3 stars.",2,,1
146,Wendy L.,"Berkeley, CA",672,1239,76,4.0,6/11/2014,"I stayed here for work, otherwise the $449 nightly rate would be out of reach.Parts of the hotel appear to have been updated recently - lobby is in tip-top shape and the cafe in the lobby is bright and cheery. On a beautiful day (which I didn't have during my visit), the courtyard would be great. The rooms are pretty large and roomy, especially for NYC. Room for two double beds, a couple of chairs and a small table and room to walk around the beds and between the beds and TV. Parts of the room seem older - the light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, carpet. Other parts seem more updated - the headboard, bedding and electronics. I appreciate the little things - the electronic do not disturb, the little tray by the TV so you don't lose the remote, slippers and bathrobes (even if mine was a bit ratty). The gym is solid - lots of cardio machines (a couple dozen?), weight-lifting machines and free weights.",2,,
147,Shannon G.,"Oakland, FL",100,6,2,1.0,11/27/2015,"We were sorely disappointed. The hotel promised many 5-star amenities but they were only good if you were a family of 2. I travel frequently and have stayed at many 3.5-4 star hotels with better service, response, friendliness and amenities. We spent several thousand dollars for a 5-star experience. We will NOT make that mistake again. Concierge was rude, the housekeepers were so loud they woke us up and they would leave our windows open and change the temperature in our room. We had a view of a brick wall for the price. Very sad and disappointing for our three children. There are many better hotels in New York. The Millennium for instance in Time Square was much better.",1,,
148,Maureen C.,"Roseland, NJ",50,12,0,3.0,2/5/2018,"We stayed this weekend at the Lotte in a Cathedral view room.  The hotel is average.  The room at first glance looked clean and the view was nice, but we found food on the floor during our stay, especially M&M candies that were never vacuumed up.  The carpet was soiled and we pointed that out to housekeeping when we had them come into the room to show them the food left over from the previous guests, and they concurred. They apologized but did little else.  Our room service breakfast was very good, but $125 for two breakfasts.  We ordered a la carte because the breakfast menu was not extensive, and coffee alone was $10 a person. We weren't too bothered by that because we were supposed to get a $50 food credit when we arrived, which we felt made the cost a bit more palatable. However, when we checked out they hadn't given it to us, even though we confirmed it with reception when we checked in.  When we brought it to their attention they told us they had no record of it.  We had to argue with the receptionist, who told us that she would give it to us this one time, but that she was doing it as a courtesy and really shouldn't do so. The hotel doesn't offer amenities like newspapers or water, everything is a la carte.  The only thing this hotel has going for it is location.",,,

I stayed here for several nights on my most recent visit to NYC and left quite satisfied.Rooms are decidedly large for New York - the beds were comfortable and the furnishings were well-appointed and modern, although the bathrooms are nothing special. My room had a nice view overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral/Midtown as well, which was a pleasure to wake up to each morning. There were a decent amount of plugs and the bedside controls for all the lighting and electronic do not disturb signals were appreciated. However, the alarm clock/iPhone dock still had the old iPhone 4 port. A bit pricey at $400+/night for a standard room and Wi-fi isn't free either, but the entire hotel is elegantly decorated. The lobby as well as the staircase are both exquisitely designed, and relaxing in the courtyard was nice as well. Service was slightly lacking - although I never had any unduly unpleasant interactions with the staff, the service was just not up to par for a luxury hotel. The front desk staff were rather cold and detached, and I was never once greeted upon returning to the hotel. The main taxi queue was chaotic at times as well. The friendliest service I received during my stay was from the housekeeping staff, who made it a point to give me a friendly greeting every time I saw them.",1,,

Stayed in one of the non-renovated rooms which was still very nice. Button controls for just about everything. Bed was nice and plush. Ordered spaghetti for room service and it was prompt and beautifully presented. Check in process was swift. Great walking distance to Rockafeller Center. They have a bar named Trouble's Trust after Leona Helmsley's dog but I didnt make it over there.  Major complaint was the price of wifi was ridiculous! (although I hear its free in the towers).

Then I was asked to call front desk again which manager came up and asked me to go down stairs with him which he claimed to have given me a ""better"" room. After entering the ""better room"", I noticed wall paper is peeling, shower wasn't hot, bath tub porcelain was cracked, carpet is old and dirty, and pillow had stains on them.

A staff member at the desk of the executive lounge instigated a problem in front of other customers. Apologies came forth from the lounge manager and the hotel manager, but all I asked for was to be reimbursed which they chose not to do. Asking for the email of the owner and board of directors was refused as well. You'd think Leona Helmsley still owned the place. In the end, I spend my money at the Four Seasons, the Waldorf etc, numerous friends and family have taken their business elsewhere. The moral of the story?

Updated review","The Palace...Something went wrong when it become the Lotte. While the space is gorgeous unfortunately that's where the perks end. Food is at best mediocre. Forget about lost items. 12 hours later it's no hope to find something left at the spa. Room turn over? Well, sort of. Sheets no longer seem to be in. I guess the thing is now to use duvet covers (mind you, not tucked in). And I guess one needs to request to have items replaced, i.e. Water in mini fridge, bathrobes ...etc.The REAL kicker is that apparently items aren't safe in your room. Or, it's just according to taste... For example, agent provocateur lingerie seems to be safe. But, sheisedo products, Dennis grossmen, leneighe or amore pacific are apparently in high demand. Let's just pray the linen company ""finds"" the tiffanys gold...Though it's quite unlikely as the security staff doesn't seem able to speak to one another over the course of a week so I can't imagine contacting another company is within their capability.There is one shining star at that terribly subpar establishment and his name is Rene at concierge. He is kind, consistent and helpful. So, if you've lost your way and found yourself at this place, keeping your belongings close and tip Rene generously!",4,4,
162,Bill S.,"Queens, NY",102,1,0,3.0,8/21/2016,The only reason I would be giving this hotel three stars is because it is a beautiful hotel with a nice location. Other than that the service isn't 5 star and the parking lot is horrendous. The room we had had a beautiful view of St. Patrick's Cathedral but needed to be updated. We ordered a romance package however when we got to the room there was no champagne and strawberries and we had to call them to send it up. The staff seemed like they really didn't want to be there and were very dismissive. The parking attendant was rude and when we went to pick up the car we had to wait almost 45 minutes to get out car because they moved it all the way across town which doesn't make sense because we told them we were only staying one night! I mean for a five star hotel the service was subpar.,1,,
163,Nelli K.,"San Diego, CA",120,281,177,5.0,9/12/2015,Girls trip to NYC and staying at the palace?! It's perfection. We had a room with the view of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Everything about this hotel is excellent. We had a driver who would drop us off where we needed to go. The courtyard was a place you can sit all day and relax even in busy NYC. The desserts place downstairs had all kinds of wonderful treats. Location of the hotel was very central to almost everything that we wanted to visit.

It delivers a great location, great service, quiet rooms (impossible to find in NY), large rooms (also hard to find in NY) and a beautiful bathroom. Everything is up to date. Don't pay for valet, if you come on a weekend after 7 you can park right on the street or print out a coupon to a local parking vendor, they get way too much for their parking.

167,Jennifer L.,"San Diego, CA",114,336,67,2.0,7/21/2013,"I stayed at the palace before and I was blown away by how lavish the entrance was ,  the opulence of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff. My last trip I would have given the hotel 4.5 stars.  Fast forward to today..We arrived at the hotel to find out it was under extensive construction.  The entire grand lobby is closed and you literally walk over boards to get to the elevators. The restaurant is even closed. It is not what I remember and I really wish I did not book this hotel.  I booked back in January and wish I had check on recent reviews. I don't want to sound so horrible about the hotel but if you have a reservation here I strongly recommend changing it and wait to return until the renovations are complete.   If you are paying what we are I can only say that I am 99% sure that most people will be disappointed and possible angry if they stay at this hotel right now.  Another suggestion is to not bother spending the money to upgrade to a cathedral room.. the cathedral is being renovated as well so has scaffolding all over it.The staff was very nice and tried their best to do what they could for us.  We were upgraded to the a renovated room which was nice and they gave us a bit of a discount on our rooms.  In the end, I would have preferred to pay more and stay at a hotel in which we could meet friends to have drinks and/or dinner.  The renovated rooms are nothing like the style of the old rooms.  The new rooms are very light and bright.  They lean more to the modern side and, in my opinion, are a little plain.  The bathrooms look like they have not been changed.  I kinda miss the opulence of the old rooms and lobby but maybe this is the new direction people asked the hotel to go.One note to the management..  I would be nice to not have to pay $16 a day for wifi!  People are paying anywhere from $400-$800 or more for their rooms. Just include it in the price.. you aren't paying that much for it and your customers know that!",3,1,1

When we arrived, there was a very long line for check-in, but the friendly and apologetic staff approached each guest, offering water bottles and champagne to help ease the pain of the line.

Times Square is within walking distance, but it's a bit farther away. So I consider the location to be good.The lobby and common areas are very pretty, well maintained, and are immaculately clean. The room was fine. Seemed a bit dated maybe, and not much on the walls. Not a big deal since you don't really go to New York to stay in your room all day. The heating and cooling system in the room was a little unique. The lights and AC are all controlled from a panel on the bedside table. The staff at checking was very friendly and helpful. The concierge was patient and helpful even though they seem to be bombarded by the same questions over and over. One lady asked the same question over and over and just didn't get it, but the concierge never got flustered.You should know that there is no restaurant here. There's a cafe that's good for breakfast, but if you want dinner, you'll have to go somewhere. Probably not an issue since New York has tons of great restaurants.",,,
175,Michael D.,"JAMAICA, NY",4,82,38,5.0,8/19/2016,"Wedding venue Villard Mansion at the Lotte Hotel is like finding the rarest diamond in an antique jewelry store. This glowing review is based on my personal experience as the groom. First star, the setting: Villard Mansion completed 1885 in a time when there were no shortage of skilled artisans hired by rich folk who spared no expense on detail. The land the Lotte Hotel and Villard Mansion sit on (Madison Ave between 50th/51st Streets) is still owned by the Catholic Church and St. Patrick's Cathedral which faces directly across the avenue. As part of the hotel, all tables, chairs, and restaurant service was included. Reception allows for 70-100 guests. We had 85, fitting around four large round tables, although other configurations can be made. Bride and groom sat opposite the DJ across a modest dance floor. The space is not too big to lose intimacy and not too crowded that people were tripping over each other. Second star, the people: Bebhinn, Leonardo, Megan. Professional to the max, dressed to the nine. For a regular guy like me(well, with bourgeoisie tendencies), one can be intimidated, however fear of arrogance was replaced by recognizable competence and fear of old school stuffiness was replaced by congeniality and sincerity. THERE IS NO NEED TO HIRE A WEDDING PLANNER. For our wedding, Leo was principally responsible in helping with timelines, and giving his skilled advice for logistics of wedding service, processional/recessional, etc., and on the big day, he and Megan made sure everyone was supposed to be at the proper place including early ""first look"" photography schedule. By the way, that means these amazing photos from the penthouse suite and rooftop on 55th floor. Leo called us on Monday to see how we were doing and also told us that he found two cards for us which probably contained cash in them and mailed them out to us. Third star, the food: They gave us time and advice for narrowing down ample choices of land and sea dishes. I fell for the short rib ravioli. The wine pairings were amazing as well. They allow up to two guests to sample all of the above at the very formal tasting. Our guests had nothing but praises for their dining choices. And a pastry chef, Ron Ben-Israel, prepares an outstanding cake. Fourth star, the service: outstanding. Guests commented to us that the servers were so hard working. It seemed like glasses were always filled with wine which probably helped DJ Mike Strict amp up the dance floor. Fifth star, the price. You chose New York City. There are no bargains, but the Villard Mansion gives you tremendous bang for your buck. Other contenders were similarly priced and include the 1) Pratt House, whom did not have associated hotel for out-of-town guests nor included an impeccable staff for the plating service, and 2) the Burden-Kahn Mansion who were difficult to deal with. The bride and groom are comped two amazing suites on Friday, then we were joined in the same suite on 49th floor on actual wedding night. Now realize this is a ritzy hotel and ordering extras will increase costs tremendously. This is why we opted to have rehearsal dinner and Sunday brunch a few blocks away ""off-site.""  During the run up to ""go-time"" on the actual Saturday afternoon wedding, my then fiancé thought ordering 10 bottles of water reasonable at the time but the bill was $116 for that service. We decided to take home those three last unopened plastic bottles because as a joke line went, they became our ""hundred dollar waters.""In my opinion, the Villard Mansion is an under-publicized, marvelous, all-inclusive wedding venue on par with Le creme de Le creme options we researched.",,,

Scaffolding covered all of the windows, and we woke up to the sound of jackhammers every day. I wish they'd let us know about this when we made the reservation.The rooms are large for NYC, but they're a little outdated. We enjoyed the most expensive breakfasts of our lives in the restaurant, but they were incredibly delicious. Sometimes you wake up at 8 a.m. in NYC, and you just don't feel like going on a food hunt.

Yes, things are pricey. Water isn't free, wifi isn't free but then again it's New York, and I haven't been to many upscale hotels where they were so please don't follow the blind on that one concept of the hotel. It's close to all the action in New York but will have you on your feet in the best of ways. Hotel employees are awesome and have been nothing but hospitable so far, and the food is the bomb dot com but I'm starting to get that general sort of vibe from New York itself.

Given the price, it is quite unacceptable. There is no breakfast, you can go at the ""Pomme Palais"" cafetaria if you want to buy some very expensive coffee.",6,,

180,Shohreh S.,"Santa Clara, CA",6,13,7,5.0,7/31/2016,Great hotel!!! The location is close to Times Square and Rockefeller Center. Rooms are spacious and clean. We stayed at 36 floor and the view was awesome. Staff helped us to get tours which were worth every penny. I will stay here again when I visit NY.,,,
181,Tarek G.,"Houston, TX",8,16,4,3.0,1/13/2017,"I don't know - NYC hotels are so abundant, and so many of them miss the mark.  This one kind of does too, though there are some pluses. The bar is exceptional if you like whiskey and the hotel restaurant is over the top beautiful, but the rooms are dated, poorly maintained, and overpriced (even for NYC). The service is good though, so it gets an unremarkable average rating from me.",1,1,
182,Kevin F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,72,1,2.0,4/12/2016,"I have stayed at the New York palace on a number of occasions for businessOn the positive side:1 good location for midtown2 passing quality for the basics (bed not uncomfortable, room not tiny)On the negative:1 very spotty service - they don't make up the room every day during your stay2 poor value3 slow service eg if you need towels ice mini bar restockingOverall not a horrible choice but I suggest trying other hotels first unless this exact location is critical.",1,,

184,Jaimee S.,"Lakewood, Dallas, TX",1,40,0,5.0,7/1/2016,I had high hopes for this hotel and they were exceeded.  The client service is exceptional-on par with the finest hotels I have visitors.  Papa and Edmark treated us like royalty.  The rooms were large and comfortable.  Perfect for a family visit.  We will definitely return!,,,
185,Jett P.,"Winchester, CA",93,113,77,4.0,7/12/2016,"Great location, decent price, fair service. They just need to update their bar downstairs and add a real restaurant. The concierge Diego had great suggestions and their doorman George was just the right amount of friendly and helpful.",,,
186,Bonnie K.,"Lincolnwood, IL",26,22,0,5.0,4/19/2017,"We have been staying at the New York Palace for the Last 25 Years.Usually twice a year and now more often that our daughter lives in New York. Over the years We have seen the hotel change ownership severals times and I want to say that Things have gotten better with age! I wanted to write this review to show our appreciation for the incredible service we always receive. Victor Caguindagan, the director of the front office Always welcomes us and tries to accommodate any special requests we may have ( my husband always wants extra towels and pillows!). He always checks in with us to make sure that our stay is enjoyable. This never happens when we visit other hotels in other cities. I also want to mention Jimmy the concierge, is always so helpful in booking our restaurant reservations and never disappoints.  The bellmen are always so helpful too.We had been forced over the years to stay at other hotels when at last minute the hotel was sold out and I can assure you that the quality of the hotel is not the same . The rooms at the New York Place  always clean, bedding is high quality, the room sizes are big and spacious ( not like boutique hotels), the bathrooms have enough counter space for all of our toiletries and best of all full length mirrors in the rooms!So, I just to say Well Done!",,,
187,Margaret N.,"Los Angeles, CA",191,450,462,2.0,12/28/2015,"Don't let the beautiful decorations outside the hotel and the nice ambiance in the lobby fool you. The bathroom in my hotel room smelled like urine during my whole stay. And the shower curtain was dirty. Not to mention, the walls are very thin and I could hear everything next door.",2,1,
188,Geoff D.,"Palo Alto, CA",729,740,459,4.0,1/6/2013,"3 night stay here earlier this year. Nice enough hotel, but felt expensive and dated relative to other options in town.As an example, light breakfast of granola and fruit was $50. High even by NY hotel standards.Good location though and fine service during the stay.",2,,2
189,Suedeo D.,"Carolina, RI",0,14,5,3.0,12/29/2016,"Choose Lotte Palace based on trip advisor.  Did not stay in the towers. We had a corner room overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral.  View was spectacular but that was the only bright spot of this hotel.  There is no restaurant and the two bars were dark and creepy.  I walked in and walked out.  They charge 15.99 a day for WiFi.  They don't give complementary water.  They charge 11 dollars a bottle from the mini bar.  Gift shop was a closet sized room selling snacks and water at a better price, but go early because they aren't open late.   I have stayed at many wonderful 5 star hotels...this is truly not one of them.   I would give 3-4 stars at best.  So many other choices in midtown.",1,1,
190,Jane C.,"Bradenton, FL",7,11,0,5.0,9/3/2016,"A fabulous experience!  We stayed for three nights (8/19-8/21).  We were there for a wedding.  Our room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable!  The staff is amazing!  If we even looked like we needed something, someone was there to help.  We informed the hotel that it was also our 46th wedding anniversary.  We were greeted with good wishes, a bottle of Marquis de la Tour, Brut, and Pomme Palais chocolates waiting for us in our room.  Wow!The Lotte New York Palace knows how to make their guests feel very special! We come to NYC frequently to visit our children. The Lotte Palace made a wonderful occasion so fantastic and memorable! The bed was awesome; I'm not a great sleeper.  However, when we came back to our beautiful room after all the festivities, I slept like a baby!  The mattress and pillows were just what we needed for a great night's sleep!A great stay: location, attention, comfort, and service!  We stayed on the 34th floor, and there was absolutely no noise!The Lotte New York Palace is our newfound place to stay!",,,
191,Sachin C.,"Manhattan, NY",171,11,0,2.0,6/22/2016,"If you care about customer service, then avoid this hotel. The rooms and facilities are fine but the service is pretty terrible. I don't think the people are bad, I blame the process. Check-in was delayed for an hour, breakfast took 30 minutes longer than promised, the list goes on",,,
192,Mike K.,"Natick, MA",14,213,0,4.0,11/4/2014,"I was here for one night only recently for the NYC Marathon. The staff were all pretty friendly, and once they found out I was running the race wished me luck. This is midtown Manhattan so everything is very expensive including this hotel. I should go into this review admitting that high prices in NYC are not limited to this hotel. The decor of the hotel is really amazing. The lobby and hotel bar were apparently recently renovated. I did in fact check out the hotel bar. I went in there and had 2 Heinekens. When I went to cash out it was $24.00! Glad I only had 2 beers. I should have walked a couple of blocks to a liquor store and bought a six pack.",2,3,1
193,Sara J.,"Washington, DC",292,197,27,5.0,1/26/2016,I hate big hotels. So this was a huge surprise to me. Lotte by palace is bustling but upscale. All of the staff is delightful and helpful. My room and view were stunning and pristinely clean. Service lovely. Great location. FabuloUs bars. Highly recommended!,1,,
194,Jonah K.,"Miami Beach, FL",387,1556,10,4.0,8/2/2013,"Very nice spot, but it's under construction currently hence there is basicly no lobby. The rooms are a bit old in the main building, but it's well constructed and the rooms are quiet. They are very large and well appointed, classical. The bed is fantastic, and the bathrooms are very nice. This is a great spot.The prices were reasonable for the room $300 per night. Great service all around, highly recommend.",,,
195,Steph B.,"New Haven, CT",28,94,54,5.0,10/28/2014,"I love this hotel!! They recently renovated the lobby and added a sexy bar and really nice lounge.  The lounge service is definitely slow but such a nice addition to this hotel.  The rooms have also been renovated and I love the new design.  Their beds are so comfy and they provide nice robes and slippers.  Great service from all staff.  The cleaning ladies even yelled down the hall when we were wheeling out our luggage to say goodbye!Great hotel, definitely recommend if you are staying in the city.",2,2,

197,Cathy M.,"Prairie Village, KS",49,5,0,5.0,7/25/2016,"There was a problem at check-in, and the front desk manager turned a slight problem into a huge positive experience.  We received a lovely upgrade.  The linens, towels, and amenities are wonderful, along with the extremely attentive staff.  Instead of explaining where the boarding pass kiosk was, a concierge walked me there.  Truly exemplary customer service.  We are changing our NY stays to the Palace from now on.",,,
198,Jacqueline V.,"Hialeah, FL",199,11,7,5.0,8/16/2016,The mattresses in this hotel are so comfortable that you want to remove the sheets to see what brand it is to buy if for your home. The concierge and front desk were pleasant and very helpful. The hotel in itself is beautiful and very clean. Molten Brown products in the bathrooms are a plus! Will be back soon.,,,
199,Kristin B.,"Doylestown, PA",3,46,0,4.0,1/26/2015,"Very nice hotel. Had a king room for the adults with adjoining double for my daughter's friends, who were along for an American Girl weekend. Rooms were extremely clean and the king especially was incredibly spacious by NYC standards. Location is great, staff were very, very pleasant. Little mix-up with the readiness of American Girl amenities I had ordered for the room, but the staff did their best to correct the problem and waved the extra charge that should've been incurred, no questions asked. Will definitely stay again.",1,,
