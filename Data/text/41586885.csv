Grilled cheese sandwiches, fries, tots, and tons of other greasy comfort food you can think of. There are many options and the prices are reasonable.The layout of the place is really cool. I like how it's not enclosed fully by walls. You can observe the night life of the street while you eat.An incredible meal is the Grande Nachos with fries substituted for the chips. The serving is huge. It sounds like a mess but it tastes like a well put together poutine of some sort.",,,
1,Bernice N.,"NY, NY",131,185,1190,4.0,11/1/2018,"I almost walked right by this place, good thing they had a big sign outside with the grilled cheese semi menu, and a board in the window betting that they have the best grilled cheese in town. Its not really a big shop, and to me if it had not been a nice warm day, I dont know if I could have found it. Kinda reminded me of a coffee shop, but lets get down to my food. 5-stars for my soup, it was hot and delicious and yes I will return for another bowl during many NYC cold weather days.3-stars for my Mac&Cheese bites, Ive had better and the ones I had here seem to have a strange taste the more and more I ate them, I do have to say that for the little they give you, they are really filling with a bowl of soup, heck even with the lil dipping cup of soup would of just been fine enough.The glass of wine I paid 8 bucks for was refreshing. I found the cucumber basil sangria a lil off in taste, but it could be right for maybe a hot summer day, just not today for me.Anyway, I found the place to be a cool lil spot and Ill be returning to try some of those grilled cheese sandwiches although it may be a to go order because this place doesnt look to be cozy enough to hang out in on a cold winters day. Oh 5-stars for the great wi-fi service they have, its definitely has that coffee shop, use your laptop and chill type of vibe. Check the bottom of your receipt for the password.",2,,1
2,Joshua S.,"Troy, NY",264,76,55,3.0,10/29/2018,"Comfort food can do no wrong. Especially when its bread and cheese.Different combinations of grilled cheeses and melts, various add-ons, and sauces - You're going to have options.The sandwiches i've had here are, unfortunately, hit or miss. Sometimes you get that perfect sear, with the cheese just about to ooze out, topping perfectly hot. Other times you'll have slightly soggy bread with almost no consistent cheese spread between.I've only had the tomato soup as a side, but its the ultimate dipping ""sauce"" for your melts.The space inside is actually really hip. Bar seating at the windows, table top everywhere else. And a bathroom to boot!All in all, a solid place for a LES quick bite!",,,
3,Sam A.,"Philadelphia, PA",95,256,1855,3.0,10/20/2018,This is an average place to get grilled cheese sandwich. I love the concept I love the open restaurant concepts. However the place is absolutely filthy. The tables and the chairs need to be wiped down with some Lysol it's thick and grimy. The grill cheese was average along with the sweet potato tater tot. I wish I could say that I was blown away by the grill cheese but I can make better ones at home.The whole area needs to be wiped down and cleaner.,1,,1

5,Nan N.,"Brooklyn, NY",264,141,190,5.0,9/26/2018,"You get what you expect.They have 1-2 special grilled cheeses not on the standard menu. With all the sandwiches you can add additional toppings such as truffle oil chicken, grilled onions, etc for a fee.There's ketchup and chalua hot sauce available on the side. The garden grilled cheese was excellent. Had mine topped with the truffle chicken. My oh my, the outside was perfect. Had the texture of fresh hot crispy croutons. The inside was melty but held together well for dipping into the tomato soup. Truffle chicken -you could smell the hint of truffle but not overpowering. Tomato soup: excellent. not too tarty, had right amount of spice. Got the house hot sauce for 45cents. Meh, tastes like your ordinary store bought buffalo hot sauce. Skip it.I think the only negatives were the portion sizing. Without the added chicken to my sandwich, I definitely would have left hungry. Ended up being about $17 without drinks. More than I would have liked to pay for a grilled cheese lunch.Bottom like: they have achieved the gold standard of crispy and melty, with a delightful  tomato soup to accompany",,,
6,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,476,780,2.0,10/14/2018,"This was the longest wait for a mediocre grilled cheese I've ever had. Not doing this again.We waited 20 min for a three-cheese grilled cheese on thin white bread with a small pocket of cheeses in it that didn't even cover the whole inside of the sandwich.The saving grace of this place is 1. Banking on nostalgia and 2. Their sweet potato tots which are, at first, delicious and then become nauseatingly sweet. My advice: buy a thick, fresh sour dough baguette at Amy's Bread and thick slabs of cheese and make your own far quicker and more delicious grilled cheese.",1,2,1
7,Phoebe W.,"New York, NY",548,323,803,3.0,7/19/2018,"This place was pretty decent. I adore grilled cheese sandwiches--especially in classic Sara Lee sliced bread and Kraft singles style--so I wasn't really sure they'd be all that good spruced up. I got the Mediterranean and my friend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both tasted exactly as I thought they would--flavors were great, Mediterranean erred on the soggy end of things and the chicken chunks were slightly too large. Honestly, I think grilled cheese is one of those perfect foods that shouldn't be messed with--anything beyond a thin slice of tomato or some bacon can easily just overwhelm the sandwich as was very much the case here. Additionally, everything was drastically overpriced, like $10 or so for something you can whip up so easily at home.We also got an order of the mac n' cheese bites and those were fantastic. None of that frozen stuff you get at outdoor markets or grimy bars, this was the real deal with creamy pasta and perfectly fried coating. All in all, a cool concept but nothing spectacular.",3,,1
8,Grace Y.,"Cambridge, MA",627,321,257,3.0,7/9/2018,"The food is fine, no major complaints, but it's really overpriced for what it is. A vegan Daiya grilled cheese (with no accompaniments whatsoever) is $9, which doesn't make sense now that I think about it, because a normal grilled cheese is $6 and it costs $2.25 to make any sandwich vegan. You can add toppings like tomatoes or basil for $1.25 extra. My mom got the Little Italy, which she said was good, but a bit lacking in terms of toppings. There were only two slices of pepperoni. They use Balthazar bread, which is nice, but honestly, how can you really mess up a fricking grilled cheese??The place gets pretty hot in the summer because there is no AC and they keep all the windows wide open. You can get 20% off on your first visit and 10% off on subsequent visits if you use Groupon+.",4,1,1
9,Ashley B.,"Queens, NY",326,64,138,4.0,10/18/2018,"I have been waiting to visit this place after stalking it online for so long.  Small place in which you order at the front and they bring the food over.  I tried the fried Mac and cheese bites and the sloppy joe grilled cheese.  I'm stuck between 3-4 stars because I definitely don't have complaints, just maybe expected a little bit more? Food was flavorful but nothing along the lines of me craving to come back here. Definitely greasy, but that's what you came for anyway!! Fried Mac and cheese were definitely the best of the two I tried. I've attached some low quality pictures without a flash; the food wasn't aesthetically pleasing, but again that's also not what you came here for!",,,
10,Daria D.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,141,876,5.0,7/10/2018,"OMG. Amazing! I was in the area for a hair appointment and was looking for a place to grab a quick lunch before heading back home. I came across Cheese Grille and ordered the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had! I ordered the Crispy Goat, which comes with chevre, goat gouda, applewood bacon, and avocado on multigrain bread. I also added tomato for an additional cost to my sandwich. This grilled cheese was definitely filling and just what I needed!I will be back to try their other menu items. Also, after already placing my order I noticed that they had a promo for 10% off your first online order. You can easily access their full menu online so take advantage of the code they offer!",2,,1
11,Dyva L.,"Elmhurst, NY",94,49,107,5.0,9/6/2018,"WOWWWWW!!! Cheesy heaven!!! Yessss!!! I had bookmarked this place a few weeks ago but had forgotten about it. One night, after attending an infused cuisine event, we were craving good quick food. My sister suggested Cheese Grille and I remembered I had wanted to come here. So clearly, I was excited. I didn't go inside, I waited outside in the car because of the lack of parking spaces. That area in Brooklyn is very congested. We went around 4 times and no luck of finding a spot to park. So we ordered to go. I ordered the goat cheese grilled cheese and it was soooooo cheesy and creamy and I dipped it in my tomato soup which was full of flavor and creamy as well. I'll admit, I've never been a fan of tomato soup, but this tomato soup here...FANTASTIC!!!!!!! My husband ordered the sloppy Joe's grilled cheese with jalapenos. OMG!!! It tasted like a philly cheesesteak but with better bread lol!!! We also ordered the tater tots which are breaded with pancake mix or bisquick, it was different but very, very good as well!!! My husband is a tad picky but he was so happy with our grilled cheese sandwiches and our tater tots! We will definitely be back soon to try other things on the menu.",2,1,2
12,Natalie W.,"Syracuse, NY",11,74,7,5.0,10/24/2018,"Quick service, great menu, and solid beverage selections. I stopped into the Cheese Grille on a whim because it was right next to my hotel, and I was pleasantly surprised with how good everything was.

13,MandA R.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",197,1052,2826,5.0,5/6/2018,Fantastic!Came here after a show at Pianos. Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place. I ordered an avocado grilled cheese with bacon and a tomato soup. M ordered a mac n cheese skillet. Everything was delicious! The inside is fairly small with tables and seating along the wall. Loved the wall graffiti and general atmosphere of this place. Super cool and fun. I look forward to returning when in the neighborhood again.,3,,3

They also bring the food to your, which is always cool and a plus++The vibe here is chill, laid back, and you can definitely take a date here(first date or 90th date). The interior walls are also cool. Seems like locals dig this spot, which is always good.  Eat where the locals eat!   Now onto the food! I had the 3 cheese grilled cheese -- cheese pull is UP THERE!

They have beautifully decorated walls, top-to-bottom windows with plenty of blue chairs for seating! It's a comfy place for comfort food!You pay at the counter and they serve your food to you!My friend got the Sloppy Joe and I got the Crispy Goat grilled sandwich. If you love avocados or bacon, you're going to love a Crispy Goat! It tastes like how you would imagine it except it has this nice thick layer of...goat gouda! Goat cheese! Thicker than normal cheese but delicious! However, the bread crust was a little too hard or should I say too ""crispy.""Unfortunately, one thing we noticed for both grilled cheese sandwiches was that they left behind a nasty aftertaste. My friend described it as plastic. It's bad to the point that I could still taste it a couple hours later! I'm so thankful my friend was craving fries (which she didn't even get!) and that searching up fries on Yelp led to here. Aside from the aftertaste, this place is definitely a must-try if you're into comfort food!",6,2,3
16,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",201,204,584,4.0,4/13/2018,"I had the opportunity to experience Cheese Grille on what better occasion then National Grilled Cheese Day! For this special celebration they were handing out complimentary Grilled Cheese Sandwiches all day long (well, from about 3 to 8 PM). I promptly made my way over after work and was excited for the experience that lay ahead.My best guess is that I wasn't the only one who had heard about the promotion that day. When I arrived there were about 20 people waiting in line to enter the cheese-centric restaurant. Fortunately enough it also seemed like the staff planned in advance and had extra hands on deck to have the sandwich making process be as fast and efficient as possible. I don't think I waited more than 5 minutes before getting to the front of the line.I was given their Classic, Cheddar on Levain Pullman, which usually rounds out at about $6. The sandwich itself was really zesty and flavorful. For all of my life I've only made impromptu Grilled Cheese's when I was tight on time, so I definitely appreciated getting to enjoy one that had been thoughtfully crafted. A great sandwich through and through.Cheese Grille also boasts a really interesting interior. It's seating area offers high top tables and stools, along with several benches outside where you can enjoy your cheesy goodness. Seems like an ideal place to hang out and grab a sandwich after a long night in the LES.I'd definitely advise giving this place a shot if you have a particular craving for something cheesy that's sure to leave you satisfied.",4,,2
17,Amanda V.,"Stamford, CT",34,229,53,4.0,8/24/2018,"If you like cheesey food, stop here.  The buffalo mac n cheese was pretty good, but the fried mac n cheese bites were fantastic.  The tomato soup dip that they come with was perfect.   Fair prices, and cute deco inside with seats that look out to the sidewalk and some trees.There were so many choices of grilled cheese too, which all looked amazing.",1,,

The sandwich, so simple, yet executed very well. The bread was crispy and soft at the same time, and the cheese was perfectly melty. The soup was a little different that what I expected, it was less creamy than a Campbell's but made up with it with a heartier tomato flavor.",1,1,1

But I was CRAVING comfort food and really, how could you go wrong with a savory Grilled Cheese, sweet potato tots (yes, SWEET POTATO TOTS), and a complimentary soup? Eating here was a #blessing.

21,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,5.0,7/31/2018,"Given Grilled Cheese is one of my basic food groups, I was on the hunt to find the best grilled cheese in NYC. While I still have a lot more to try, this one has so far been top notch. Firstly, the atmosphere/vibe here is classic LES/EV. Fun paintings on the wall, bright colors, rustic features, interesting and quirky decor. Amazing bright natural lights and prime people watching. The food is delicious, with focus on grilled cheese, tater tots, mac n cheese, french fries, and soup. Great soul warming food, that truly hits the spot on a cold, city day. Everything was crispy, cooked to perfection, lots of flavor, creative combinations for sandwiches. I anticipate coming here a lot more. It is the whole package.",1,1,1
22,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",218,347,521,4.0,2/26/2018,"This was a great discovery--thanks again, Yelp and fellow Yelpers! This is a fun, unassuming spot that serves up some solid grilled cheese with great accompaniments. Both grilled cheeses were good, though ingredient proportions were a bit inconsistent. I enjoyed my garden melt - roasted red pepper was a nice touch, but the advertised olive tapenade was non-existent--thought the sandwich would have been went from good to stellar if that flavor was adequately worked in. On the other hand, my wife enjoyed her ham and cheese, although she found it a bit too heavy on the mustard. The sides were pretty incredible though. The spicy tomato soup was excellent, and seemed like a perfect thing to pair with pretty much any grilled cheese, and the sweet potato tots were just amazing. Decent selections of both wine and beer to pair with your GC as well. Nice spot to hang and enjoy a reasonable meal in a chill environment while people-watching out the window on Allen St. Fun vibe at 9pm - imagine it could be pretty crazy with drunks at 3am though. One word of warning - the bathroom was gross - floor was completely flooded, and the room didn't seem to have been cleaned in ages.  As a kid I remember being intrigued/horrified by this neighborhood. Now I'm mostly just horrified by the prices. It was nice to find a place that seems to effortlessly be neither full-on gentrified fanciness nor pretending to be a retro throwback. Just a simple, fun, reasonably-priced place to eat. With lots of melted cheese and beer to boot. Stop in and enjoy the food. But do your best to hold it in and wait to get home to use the restroom.",3,3,2
23,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,3.0,5/3/2018,"I came here on a weekday for lunch and it was empty. The place was casual, filled with wall art and had plenty of seats with communal tables. I ordered a sloppy joe grilled cheese and a cup of spicy tomato soup. The total was a little over $13. Ouch. First impression? The sandwich was paper thin which was kind of upsetting. Might just be a preference but I had hoped that there would be more filling. The tomato soup was extremely tiny which was also unexpected (pics for reference). I thought the sandwich tasted average. The meat was a bit bland and it could be more cheesy. Having it with the tomato soup helped. The soup was delicious, tangy and spicy with a nice kick to it. Ask for a sample. I highly recommend. My only complaint was how greasy the grilled cheese was. Don't get me wrong. I know i'm not eating the healthiest clean meal. But this was possibly the greasiest grilled cheese I've ever had. It was soaked and dripping in oil (see pics). I felt a little gross after finishing. And thank god I didn't wear white. The service was good and the workers were friendly. I'm guessing when they're not busy, they will help bring you the food. Utensils are silver and not cheap plastic which I appreciate. But I'm not crazy about returning.",,,
24,Leona L.,"New York, NY",179,113,199,4.0,4/24/2018,"Decided to stop by for a mid-day snack because my friend was craving mac and cheese. I've been here before and had one of their sandwiches - which was pretty good. It's definitely a cute place to sit and enjoy your food during a warm day (it's almost like sitting outside when the windows are opened). There's no table service, you simply order at the counter when you're ready. They'll either call your ticket number or bring it to you. We had the classic mac and cheese, sweet potato tots, and nachos cheese. The mac and cheese (cheddar, gruyere and asiago) was really good, definitely cheesy enough and had bread crumbs that gave it a good crunchy layer on top. The sweet potato tots were also super tasty, just a little sweeter than I anticipated compared to sweet potato fries I've had at other places. You can choose what sauce you want with the tots and I chose the aioli (charged extra $0.45 without being informed of it). The nachos with cheese were bland, nothing special about them. It was just melted cheese on tortilla chips, it definitely could be improved to make it different. Overall, the workers were friendly and it's definitely a good place to stop in if you're craving cheese sandwiches or mac and cheese. They also have a large selection of wine and beer, if you just want to sit inside and hang out! However, don't be too shocked if you think it is somewhat pricey for their food.",,,

The cheese was perfectly melted and the bread had a nice crunch. Soup was tangy and creamy. Tots were crispy and slightly sweet. We will definitely come back. It is a little pricey for grilled cheese but the ingredients used were good quality. Decor was interesting and staff was friendly. I would've given this place 5 stars but the restroom was awful. The floor was wet like there was a busted pipe and the toilet seat is so close to the wall you cannot hover, much less sit because there is literally no room for your knees. You'd have to come in and sit from the side. That is just a big no. Put in a smaller toilet and/or remodel your bathroom.

It was also my first time eating here, thus it left quite a first impression on both me and my friend. Beginning with the staff being extremely rude and having no loyalty/respect toward their customers; all over a sheer misunderstanding. The taste of the food was a little inconsistent. Some elements, like the Mac and cheese were good, but other, like the nachos, tasted an absolute mess. Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back.",,,

The food came quickly after we ordered.I got the crispy goat grilled cheese. It was nice and gooey, the chevre was fresh and the avocado was ample. I really liked the atmosphere with the brightly painted walls and the music playing in the background.However, the food does seem overpriced for a grilled cheese sandwich. If you're super hungry, don't go here expecting to be full. There were beers, wine and sangria available, but we didn't get any.",,,

The grilled cheese was flavorful and the bread was toasted right, not too crispy and not too soggy. It wasn't overly oily from the butter either making it easier to hold than some other grilled cheeses I've had around the city. This was $8, a little on the pricier side but definitely worth a dry.What surprised me was their ""shoestring"" fries.. maybe my idea of shoestring is wrong, but they seemed like regular thin cut fries to me. They were crunchy and fried well, no complaints there besides that I wouldn't consider them shoe string. For 45cents they have house made sauces like chipotle aioli and ranch. They didn't tell me it was an extra 45cents when they asked, which is fine because it's not much, I should have seen it on the menu I guess. The ranch had a very strong flavor which my friend didn't enjoy, but i did enjoy dipping my fries in it.Not a bad experience at all, will be back to try their other stuff like Mac n cheese and other grilled cheeses.",,,

Thanks to Yelp I already knew what I wanted...The Sloppy Joe grilled cheese which consists of sloppy joe ground beef and jalapeños. I also got an order of the sweet potato tots which are supposed to come with some type of sriracha Mayo which they must have forgotten so I just used ketchup. In addition to our food, we ordered a carafe of one of their white wines. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The food is also super photogenic; therefore, you can get some great snaps. The ambiance of this place is super casual and laid back. Absolutely no frills. I'd definitely return and recommend to others in the area who might be looking for a quick bite to eat.

I wish the portions were a bit bigger compared to the price, but I was full after my sandwich, cup of soup, and bites of my friend's Mac and cheese. Grilled cheese: the caramelized onions were amazing! And the Dijon gave it such a great kick. My only request is that they spread out the onions and Dijon better because the edges which were missing those two ingredients weren't nearly as good. The Dijon was all in the center, so I'd get bites of intense, nasal passage clearing burns of Dijon mustard. Buffalo Mac and cheese: my friend liked it but I wouldn't eat it again. It was too heavy and fatty tasting because of the fried, battered chicken and the decadent, heavy sauces. Tomato soup: I liked it but it was too expensive for a cup (4-5oz for $3.50).

The grilled cheese was STUFFED w the creamiest most delicious cheese and crispy delicious. I also never get plain grilled cheese and to be so impressed is a lot from me!

The young man taking our order at the register was cheerful and very helpful in terms of explaining selections. We opted for the buffalo chicken Mac & Cheese. It was very good, lots of spicy kick. Keep a cool beverage on the side. I added some BBQ sauce to the Mac & Cheese just to balance the heat just beyI have low tolerance for heat but again it was very good. We also purchased the Little Italy grilled cheese sandwich which has a Pesto spread, oh so good! Overall, on point selections. I am sure we will return to try a few other menu options.",1,1,1

Then we stumbled this wonderful gem. You go in, order what you want, pay and food will be delivered to your table.I knew I wanted mac and cheese so I ordered one with ham while my husband got the goat cheese grilled cheese.

38,Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",923,1222,5104,3.0,8/25/2017,"I had quite a unique experience here and I doubt that it will ever be repeated, so I struggled with how to rate this place. The food was pretty solid, but definitely not life changing. So maybe a 4/5. But The immaturity of the people working there brought the score down to a 3/5. While I was ordering at the register a TV prank was happening in their very tiny sitting space. While I was just far enough away to be able to try and ignore it, my mother was sitting right in the middle of it. She eventually got freaked out enough to leave her seat and come up by me at the register (there was a man wearing 3D glasses who was freaking out, knocking things off tables, waving his arms frantically and bumping into people). Finally, the actors stopped, let everyone know it was a prank and that it was for a TV show. Too late, my mom was already pissed and didn't find it amusing. Frankly, I didn't either. But I'd just paid, so they already had our money. My mother expressed her concerns and was visibly upset, but it didn't seem to phase the man at the counter. In fact, he could barely keep from giggling as he explained that they had signed an agreement with this company and couldn't do anything to stop what had happened. We're I the business owner, I would be concerned about losing a costumer. I would, BARE MINIMUM, offer to add a drink or side dish for free, get the order out ASAP, and continue to check on the guests to make sure they were comfortable in every other way. But again, all he could do was giggle. Thank goodness the TV people were better. Maybe because they just wanted us to sign their paperwork. But after hearing my mom's concerns, they immediately offered to pay for our meal. We got a a grilled cheese with bacon and avocado. Pretty good! We also got a side of sweet tots. They were great with the chipotle sauce (which was extra $). Not sure I'm dying to come back to this place....",8,3,5

I came with a friend and she loved her grilled cheese as well. She ordered the Sloppy Joe and she was a big fan. My order-The Mediterranean and Fries *yum* It was honestly so good! It didn't take long to prepare and it was very filling. Service- The guys who were funny and polite. You don't get served at this restaurant, you have to order at the register and you take your receipt with your number.

Including the pictures on the wall makes even brighter interior.The buffalo chicken grilled cheese was perfection to taste that you could easily finish and order the second one . Don't get me wrong it's big enough for a lunch. Grilled cheese the caramelized onion makes it haven of spot with that beautifully served home made tomato soup smelling the all fresh tomato can make your lunch even better You know, we all crave for some good grilled cheese once in a while for sure and this is the spot that is taking your craving out of your mind because the grilled cheese only could be made this delicious with some or many kind of sauce you can choose.And like most people here saying it's good or it's the best.

In the past, I've put in mealpal orders with this restaurant and talked to a member of their staff who told me I can call before pick up and let them know I don't want the meat in the sandwich whenever the mealpal order is not vegetarian. I had done that before and it was fine. Today I did the same and was told they can't do anything about it and I can either pick up what they have prepared or just lose the meal. That's inconsistent customer service and pretty terrible service when they don't care that they will be losing a customer. Never experienced this anywhere else. I used to order delivery from them a lot too, so definitely not doing that anymore. Bad customer service and average food.",,1,

Service was great and the food was even better! I tried the crispy goat and the garden melt - both were flavorful and filled with lots of cheese. Though the grilled cheeses were delicious, I would've preferred the bread to be less crispy and hard since it made it difficult to bite into. The sweet potato tots were a good change in the usual sweet potato fries. They came out hot and crispy and was a good balance with the chipotle aioli sauce. There's no question that I would be back for the sweet potato tots and to try out the other grilled cheeses.",,1,1

The entire trip was basically me eating my way through Manhattan and it amounted to eating something nearly every hour. It was our last day there and I walked in... and decided to appease Hubby with just getting the sweet potato tater tots to go. We had a plane to catch in a few hours. I still think about the grilled cheese sandwich I missed but next time! Back to what I did buy: the tater tots were pretty good! I finally ate them on the plane so they weren't quite fresh but still satisfying. Tater tots were always a love of mine but sweet potatoes were a new one and I don't regret it one bit. I think we were their first customers of the day and the man did a slight double take when I only ordered the tots but got over it in a split second. We got out order in no time and we were on our way.

55,Naomi S.,"Berkeley, CA",421,150,102,5.0,5/27/2017,"Cheese Grille is a million times better than Murray's Cheese Shop's melt sandwiches. Everything at Cheese Grille blew me away, whereas Murray's sandwiches seemed shoddily made and didn't contain nearly enough of the staple ingredient- cheese. Anyway, onto the cheese grille's food. Get the fried mac and cheese, because the only thing that makes cheese better is frying it (duh), and it comes with a tasty side of marinara. The classic sandwich is solid if you're looking for a traditional option to satisfy your cheese needs. The Crispy Goat had a tangy kick that was not shy- perfect for goat cheese lovers. I loved the Garden Melt's touch of olive tapenade that gave it a refreshing saltiness. The Buffalo Chicken had a major spicy kick, and the chicken was delightfully crunchy. A++++If you're a truffle lover, definitely try the Mediterannean and your taste buds will be in heaven. Save room for dessert because the strawberry speculoos and banana mascarpone are warm, sweet, comforting, and not to be missed.Please don't judge how much I ate... it was really good.",3,3,3

The owner here is as passionate about making grilled cheese as you are about eating cheese, so this pairing is simply divine.If you want to stop by Brooklyn while you're not in Brooklyn, this place is as close as it gets. The walls in here are literally screaming with color and dining here is a personal experience with reasonable prices for Manhattan! Also hello locals: THEY DELIVER! Though fair warning: you're missing out on some fun staff to mix up your day.The Food:1) Banana Mascarpone -- My first love is a savory grilled cheese, UNTIL I tasted this sweet one. Most days, I enjoy slicing up bananas and throwing them into a peanut butter sandwich, cereal, or smoothies, but you have not understood the versatility of banana as a food until you've eaten it here, stuffed between brioche, mascarpone, and a healthy dose of Nutella, what a balance of flavors!2) Sweet potato tots -- So you're terrified of ruining your diet and not achieving your summer bod if you come out here for grilled cheese. Hold that thought because sweet potato tots are on the menu and they're just as glorious as they sound while not tasting as fattening as any old potater tot! A bit pricey for a side, however, there's more than one size to choose from.3) Fried Mac & Cheese -- These bites are well-breaded, but not the clear winner in the food I tried at this place. They're spectacularly cheesy, but, at least for me, they don't have the classic charm of having good old regular mac and cheese nor does it lift me into a new dining experience the way fried oreos do for oreos. Overall: I'd come here, again and again until the staff knows me by name because a cheese lover must befriend all other cheese lovers in the world, especially when they make good grilled cheese!",2,2,2

Updated review","After a not so stellar first visit, I decided to return to try out the ""Sloppy Joe"" and Onion Rings-- which caught my eye last time. The grilled cheese was grilled perfectly, not too much cheese, not too much ground beef, and to top it off, I dipped in Chipotle sauce, which totally enhanced the experience. (Kudos to Michael for making the suggestion). The Onion rings also hit the spot, and weren't too greasy. As I waited for my order I checked out their Instagram page, and noticed they had Mac and Cheese--- I guess that give me no choice but to return for a third time to give that a shot!",4,4,4
61,Amelia A.,"New York, NY",292,151,565,4.0,12/22/2017,"Yummmmmm nothing like a crispy, melty grilled cheese with some hot tomato soup on a cold day!!Upon entering the restaurant, it was actually a little awkward. A man (who I later realized works there and was perhaps the manager?) completely didn't acknowledge me. I was a little confused too because I wasn't sure if you order first? Or get seated and they take your order. In any case, someone who was cleaning acknowledged me once it was clear that the other guy wasn't about to say a word. It was then made clear that I can order at the counter then they would bring the food. The man that took my order and the man who seemed to have been cleaning were very nice and helpful. The guy that seemed to be the manager was an interesting character though.. not that I saw him be mean to customers, but he seemed to very much micro manage and talk down to the employees... not necessarily directly relevant to customers, but still of interesting mention as far as environment feels of the establishment. There is some bar seating and some table seating. Good for anyone stopping in on their own, fun date, or meetup w friends. Random street art type stuff along the walls and really random stickers plastered. Casual and fun feel overall!The food though. Dear god. Crispiest grilled cheese I've ever had in my life that wasn't burnt. I got the Little Italy. It wasn't a heaping sandwich, but it was filling enough along w the cup of spicy tomato soup. Cheesy enough for sure, I wish there was more pepperoni, but man. The pesto really gave it a nice touch. The soup, while hot w a little kick, was also refreshing in a sense. The lemonade to accompany was pretty tasty as well - not too tangy/sour and not too sweet. I will definitely be back. There are too many amazing things that must be tried here o.o",1,,

63,Nancy W.,"New York, NY",556,27,5,4.0,1/21/2018,"This establishment epitomizes why I love New York--this city manages to turn the most basic foods that you would never crave in any other city (e.g. bagels, pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches) into one of the best foods you've ever had. I've been living out of a hotel down the street since moving to the city and walk past this place everyday. There's a poster outside that reads something along the lines of, ""Best grilled cheese in the city or drink on the house."" I scoffed at this for a good week, like best grilled cheese? Low bar much? Ever read a sign that said, ""Best candy corn in the city""? Not only do all candy corn taste the same, but also who the hell craves candy corn/grilled cheese?But it got to me. I craved a grilled cheese today. I walked in around noon on a cold Sunday and ordered the basic ham and cheese sandwich for $8. Dijon, gruyere, caramelized onions, white bread, whatever. Let's add a bowl of spicy tomato soup too because all the reviews said the portions were small, which really worried me because I grew up in middle of nowhere California and expect nothing less than Cheesecake Factory portions. The bread had a larger area than I expected, at least 5x5, and perfectly crisp. Turned to the side, the sandwich was pretty thin, with a small slice or two of ham, some caramelized onions, and 2 thin layers of cheese. I can't think of a way for the sandwich to be thicker though, because the ratio of bread to cheese to meat was just right. You have to get the spicy tomato soup--it elevates all the flavors of the sandwich without ruining the texture. The interior has a line of tables and chairs by the window so you can sit and enjoy this experience alone or sit at the counters to socialize. I highly recommend savoring this experience for yourself at least once. It's too easy to scarf down a piece of bread while talking without realizing that you finished your food. The downside was that the food took more than 20 minutes to come out and the restaurant was hardly full, so I wouldn't come here again if I were looking for a quick lunch before spending an awfully long day in Ikea. I would order for delivery or come back at night to have this along with some beers with a few bros--it stays open late and has a decent selection of drinks.",,,

There is a television here to help you pass the time while you wait, and it had college football on during the time I visited, which was okay. Eventually I got my sandwich and dug in.

The counter worker was pleasant and walked us through the menu and we placed our order. The wait was fair, though admittedly there weren't many people there ahead of us. The food was very aesthetically pleasing when it arrived (as a brief perusal of Instagram can verify), though the taste didn't measure up to the hype, nor did the portions for the price. As an added thought, the drink selection here was quite good.Overall, I would consider coming back with friends for a (very) light bite to eat. Guess I just set my expectations a tad too high.Overall: 3.0 stars----------Pros:- Food is good, and very aesthetically appealing.- On warm/nice days, the open design of the restaurant is a great way to enjoy the evening.Cons:- Didn't quite live up to the hype.- Prices/portions were below expectations.",1,,

Really cute interior with a good amount of seating. Staff was really friendly they even bring your food to u after u order. I would say it's a cute little date spot (granted u both really love cheese) especially in the summer. Now on to Le Food ...The buffalo chicken grilled cheese was amazingly gooey, crunchy, and spicy. The sweet potato tots were bomb (although I wish they were a little crunchier, I'm that weird tater tot lover who likes them super crunchy). The cheese fries, which was def more cheese than fries, were a bit soupy and the amount of cheese left over after eating all the fries kind of made me mad (who wants to waste cheese?). Regardless I was def pleased with what I came here for...the grilled cheese. Will be coming back soon to try the Mac n cheese!",,,

Thanks to a Yelp Elite Event I didn't get in this place was put on my radar...I finally made the time to get here this past weekend easy, simple menu with plenty of cheesy goodness.  After drinking in the area my friend & I made this our final stop for the night, to start we went with a small bottle of the Rosé wine not bad. Appetizers tried the Fried Mac & Cheese these were good nice combo w the Asiago & Chèvre cheeses although I expected them to be better they lacked some flavor better when dipped in the sauce. Grilled cheese I went with the Mediterranean this is asiago, chèvre cheese with tomato, basil & truffle oil ..yummm great tasting the truffle oil gives it that extra kick.  My friend had the Crispy goat this ones chèvre, goat gouda w bacon & avocado another winner very good flavors mix really well. As for the restaurant not a lot can be said simple but funky decor, small space.Service was good prices are cheap, hard to go wrong w this kind of place glad I took the time to check this place out will definitely continue to visit from time to time.",10,3,6

Updated review","I'm about to get real petty, and change my 3-star review to a 1-star.I recently visited Cheese Grille and had an okay experience, so that's exactly what I wrote about. It wasn't a scathing review or anything, but just not my cup of tea so I wrote about exactly how I felt about the food.Fast forward a month or so - Michael I., who I'm guessing is the owner, posted a rude comment to my review (see attached picture), something to the effect of how I should go and open my own restaurant and then they can judge me on how my food tastes.Well, there's just a few things wrong with this comment:1. I have no restaurant business experience, so pretty sure it would fail pretty quickly.2. The experience that I do have is eating food. And some people like certain things, but some people don't. Does everyone like celery? I certainly do not. But it's a personal preference.3. Yelp is a platform where you should be able to give your personal opinion.4. If I was a restaurant owner, and I received less than raving reviews, I wouldn't post some snarky comment (although I would probably be thinking it). I would use it to think of ways to improve so I can gain more customers and change that customer's mind.5. Starting to think he paid all these people to give all these glowing reviews...6. He spelled Cheese Grille as 'CheeseGrile' so if you can't even spell your own business name right, then I really don't fuckin know.So Mikey, I'ma drop a truth bomb on you, if you want me to really get real, without a filter. Here it goes. Your grilled cheese tastes no better than one from a ten-dollar grilled cheese maker. You should be so lucky that I even paid what I did for one of your sandwiches because it was definitely not worth the price tag. And you know what? I originally thought no one was in your establishment because it was cold and rainy, but now I see that weather did not play a factor at all. It was actually your attitude. So while I must admit that I have no food industry skills, I do have people skills, which is something that you lack. I suggest you change that right quick or else you can say goodbye to 'CheeseGrile'. *micdrop*",27,31,12

Simple, yet delectable.  Great customer service.  I was not prepared for a great experience as it seemed like just-another-deli-like venue.  I was quickly put in my place upon perusing the menu offerings at Cheese Grille.  My mouth was watering when I read the variety of grilled cheese type of sandwiches; my heart settled on the Crispy Goat and sweet potato tots: YUM! I paired it with a beer and that made my night.It was a cool New York evening and the food hit the spot! They have high stools and bar top tables.  A tv was playing the latest NBA game.  The cashier and wait help came by to check on us as well.Overall, it was a great experience.

Really open and airy, even more so with the windows open to the street. Staff is really friendly and got a good selection of sandwiches. No fried chicken in this place, but the sloppy joe is pretty damn good. It's a light sandwich, not a whole lot of cheese but just enough, plenty of meat and just a little kick form the peppers. For under ten bucks, it's a no brainer. Just a side note, the olives are great!Would come back for a night lunch, perfect when you're feinding for dessert but gotta eat ""real"" food first. 5/5 would come here again, especially on a brunch date.

The whole storefront was wide open and the restaurant had a great charm about it. The menu is abundant and you can chose one of the pre-made creations or opt to make your own grilled cheese. There's also plenty of sides/apps and an extensive beer/wine menu. Service was fast and friendly. I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese but decided to forego the chicken (not a huge fan of any type of meat in my sandwiches). The sandwich was really delicious, bread was perfectly crusted (would recommend subbing in for the multigrain) and the cheese was perfectly melty. I also ordered the spicy tomato soup which was OK, would have preferred to try the sweet potato tots (next time!).We were able to sit right by the open window and it was simply perfect.

87,Sunny T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",335,128,27,4.0,3/27/2017,"It was during one of my drunken stupors that I finally made it to Cheese Grille. Reasons? A. I had major drunchies. B. At my then-state, I couldn't care less about treating my body as a temple.C. My friend was eating a mainstream burrito at the time. But where's the cheese? Surprised that I not only managed to make it all the way to the shop in a decent manner, but that I even remembered where it was. Got to the counter and was overwhelmed by all the options so I asked the server his favorite. He recommended the Sloppy Joe. Who was I kidding? I'm a goat-cheese or go-home kinda girl. So I settled on the Mediterranean (Chevre, Asiago, Tomato, Basil and Truffle Oil on Multigrain). Holy Heaven. Took that bundle of joy back to the Mexican place my friend was eating his sad burrito at. And one bite into that godly grilled cheese and my tastebuds went bonkers. The bread was oh so crispy and beautifully grilled --not to mention buttered up to perfection. The chevre and asiago was rich and creamy. The way the cheese was melted showed that the cook really knew what he was doing-- got that perfect cheez pullll. Tomatoes were juicy, basil was fresh, and truffle oil was truly indulgent.  Even my sad burrito-eating friend couldn't help but take two (large) bites. Lucky for him I'm a nice drunk and willingly shared. Definitely will go back when I'm facing all those reasons above, or I guess when I just want a damn good grilled cheese. Only reason for taking off one star was I couldn't justify a sandwich for being $9, but I guess that's a given in NYC.",,1,

My girl friend brought us here saying she has been wanting to try this spot for a little while now. And I looove grilled cheese sandwiches so I was all for it. It's a cool little spot, upon walking in we were told we could take a seat and when we knew what we wanted let them know, and they bring the food to your table. The service was nice and the people were friendly. I got the buffalo chicken grilled cheese which was one of the best grilled cheeses I have ever had, besides my own of course lol, and a lions head beer. My girl friend got the Mediterranean grilled cheese and the fried Mac and cheese bites which she said were also great.

This place nails it on the grilled cheese and sells them at such a reasonable price for New York. I think For two sandwiches and nachos we spent a total of 25$ something to think about kids.The Italian one (insert cute name) - Pepperoni, red sauce, mozzarella, pesto had flavor entering the mouth from every angle. It was by far my favorite and I highly suggest getting sandwiches that have toppings because those seemed to taste the best.Three Cheese (no cute name needed) - This one had a lot of unique flavors because of the three different cheeses doing work. However, I got mixed up on occasion but ultimately enjoyed the sandwich and the different salty sweetness each cheese brought.The Nachos - just some liquid cheese and chips. They weren't anything special BUT I just kept eating and eating and eating them. I have no idea what kind of cheese they used... maybe cocaine cheese... the best of all the cheeses. Because I just kept eating and eating and eating. THE VERDICT:The best of the grilled cheese places I have gone in the city. But I don't have a huge respect for grilled cheese restaurants (well why do you keep eating at them then alex)... shut up you're right okay. I finally admit it, you are eff word right. This was good and well-priced so they still get a four but remember... you have the power to basically make the same things for cheaper. But you gotta clean up... and who wants to do that?",2,3,1

We just had a truffle melt from melt shop and decided to compare it with this truffle grilled cheese sandwich. They are so different! The Mediterranean was contained by slices of multi-grain bread which changed the taste a whole lot. I love multi-grain bread but this was not the way to go for a grilled cheese sandwich. I appreciated the extremely googie cheese consistency. This makes eating grilled cheese so much more fun! The smell of truffle was equally as strong as melt shop's truffle melt. The Mediterranean had more than one type of cheese but I can't say that helped with the taste. Overall, the sandwiches were too different to compare.

I tried a sample of the classic to start, with the gooey cheddar cheese and crisp buttery pullman bread hit the mark. Then I ordered was the Little Italy, with asiago, mozzarella, pepperoni, tomato sauce, pesto. The pesto really added the umph to this sandwich and made the flavors pop. The french fries and tater tots were all crispy and not overly greasy. I had a Flower Power IPA and it was a nice companion to the sandwiches.

In fact its even a step up from the classic typical American cheese melted on grilled white bread that we all ate when we were 10 years old, because here they have fancy add on ingredients like avocado, bacon and caramelized onions!!I ordered the Little Italy with added avocado.

I ordered the Little Italy (Asiago, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Tomato Sauce, Pesto on Levain Pullman). The combination was good but I didn't think the grilled cheese sandwich as a whole was anything to rave about, especially for $8. The sandwich was barely bigger than the size of my hand and had only a thin layer of pepperoni. On top of that, I found the bread to be incredibly oily/greasy - this wasn't helped by the fact that I had ordered through UberEats and got no napkins with my order... which I would have assumed was a no-brainer for a restaurant dishing takeout/delivery orders in the city. I'm also a bit put-off by the owner's replies to some of the reviews here.

He got my drink order incorrect (gave me a still Rosé when I asked for sparkling and then argued with me that I didn't order it instead of simply switching it for the correct drink) told me I'd have to keep it and pay for a new one. I ONLY drink sparkling when drinking Rosé and would never order it otherwise. I kept the Rosé and simply tried to enjoy my food after the disappointment.The next time I visited, I wanted to use the 15% off coupon that I received via email on my order. The guy at the register very politely explained to me that I did not read the fine print and that the coupon could only be used if I place the order online and not in person (which I thought was a strange catch but I was fine with it after I saw it was in fact printed on the email) He then told me that he would still honor the discount and proceeded with my order. Good customer service on his end!The manager (same guy from the first visit) over heard and rudely intervened and told him he would NOT allow him to honor it for me. I thought this was extremely poor customer service, especially since he already promised me the discount (not to mention that I am a regular customer). I was completely turned off at this point and even asked him for the contact number of his higher management.. which I never found the time to contact.(He was nervous and uneasy once I asked for this information) I haven't visited much since then.. until tonight. I was greeted by the GM who told me that he let the previous manager go because his practices weren't ""clean enough"".I would be lying if I said I wasn't pleased to hear he was no longer there.. The GM seemed very friendly and attentive .. much more pleasant overall,Sadly, once my order arrived there was further disappointment. I ordered a 3 cheese sandwich ++ truffle oil and extra cheese , tomato soup, and fries (even ""splurged"" and added the ranch and chipotle aioli for dipping, which is an extra 50 cents each)My sandwich was first taken to the wrong table and then i discovered that I did not receive the truffle oil OR extra cheese (I know what extra cheese looks like on their sandwiches, I've had it both ways. And anybody would know the very distinct aroma and taste of truffle) I first made my way back up to let him know that the sandwich didn't have truffle oil and he quickly ran to grab the oil and drizzled a bit onto my sandwich. It actually wasn't until after I sat back down and went to eat the sandwich that I noticed it was also missing extra cheese. I was so exhausted and fed up with the unsatisfactory situations that seem to continue to occur when I eat there, that I didn't even bother going back to tell him ""this also doesn't have extra cheese""(And for those of you that don't know, extra cheese and truffle oil are an extra $2.25 each). I actually enjoy the food. I am a cheese addict! Also, the spicy tomato soup is amazing, and it's vegan! Which was probably what was most very appealing to me when I first found this place. I was born and raised a strict vegetarian. (A lot of places will ruin their soup with chicken broth.)This rating has the potential to be a 5-Star!!!I have yet to decide rather I'll give it one last try. After all, they do say that the 3rd time is a charm, 3 strikes and your out, and.. all those other catchy phrases. If I do, I can only hope that it will be much better because It would be unfortunate for me to give up on this place for good. It would certainly be the last time for me.",,,

I've always been a HUGE fan of grilled cheese sandwiches and was EXCITED to find a shop that serves a large variety of them. Please come with a small group so you can order a bunch of things to try.During my visit I had the sweet potato tater tots that was absolutely BOMB. It was super crispy. The fried mac and cheese balls were also amazing. As for the grilled cheese sandwiches, my favorite was the Garden Melt which was refreshing and lighter than most of the menu. The Crispy Goat has a special place in my heart since I'm a goat cheese lover. Other good options on the menu include the Buffalo Chicken and the Mediterranean (rich truffle flavor). I didn't love the classic sandwich since it tasted something I can easily make at home with american and cheddar cheese.

I don't know why more restaurants don't do that.Our group of 4 got a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches, french fries, sweet potato tots and onion rings. I could do without the sweet potato tots and onion ring. The batter wasn't great on either. The fries were good and they knocked it out of the park with the Ham and Cheese.

However, after my friends and I took a seat at the table closest to the trash can, a waitress or bus girl was extremely rude behind us. We could hear her yelling about people not throwing their trash away and proceeded to slam chairs and dishes she was moving/cleaning. Ironically, she was talking about my coworker, who saw the table we were at wasn't cleaned yet, but would seat all of my coworkers and I. She simply moved the plates/cups from our table to the trash can area. When we saw the waitress/bus girl cleaning the table in front of us, my coworker told her what happened and asked if she didn't mind if we moved to the table she just wiped down. The girl shrugged!

One of the nice things about Cheese Grille is that it was open late, so we found ourselves sauntering in around midnight or so. My dining companion ordered the Buffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese and Onion Rings, and I ordered the Nachos. One of my friends ordered the Banana and Nutella sandwich. I had a taste of the Buffalo Grilled Cheese and though it was too greasy for my taste. The Nachos were also a disappointment, to be honest. The chips were cheap tasting, and the toppings weren't memorable. The nacho cheese tasted like the type you buy in bulk out of the can. They were also served lukewarm which didn't help matters. The Onion Rings were clearly frozen, suffering from a dough-like batter that was not appetizing.Notwithstanding the aforementioned issues, Cheese Grille was open late and relatively inexpensive.",2,1,1

Prices is in the middle range ($7-9ish mainly).I personally got the buffalo chicken. It can be spicy with the jalapenos, tabasco type hot sauce with the buffalo chicken sauce. But other than that, it's pretty good. My friend said that the Mediterranean was great. As long as you like grilled cheese, this place is good. In terms of the store itself, it isn't a big place. It does hold several long tables with seats. It doesn't seem like it gets very packed anyways, so no need to worry about not having seating. The only downside is that there's no AC. The seating area is exposed to the heat. But, it's a quick bite to eat for the most part. So, it's bearable.",,,

This joint is the perfect way to get your grill cheese fix on with a variety of options from traditional to fun. I ordered the sloppy joe, shoestring french fries and the spicy tomato soup because I love to get my dipping on.The sloppy joe is chedder cheese, ground beef and Jalapeños on a white bread. Its very hearty but delicious. The cheese is nicely melted and not overly coagulated. It's hard to mess up a grill cheese and most of the fault lies in the cheese. A lot of bad grill cheese occurs when there is too much cheese and it overpowers the taste or if the cheese is over or under cooked. Not so at this resturant, the cheese was perfect. The fries were as good as any high end resturant but at the end of the day it's just french fries.I also truly enjoyed my spicy tomato soup and thought the extra kick in the soup made this dish stand out from boring tomato soup.

Updated review","The comeback that Cheese Grille made is honestly one of the reasons I'm such a firm believer in second chances. I was sent a message by one of the owners to try them out again and I knew that if they cared about a single customer's experience to such an extent it was only fair I give them a shot at redemption. I showed up at around 1 in the afternoon and was given recommendations for what I should order. Since it was a lovely day I once again sat outside, but this time at their bar where I got to chatting with one of the employees. Apparently the place is run with a very small staff, never more than eight people. For my savory grilled cheese I got a 3 cheese sandwich with caramelized onions and a small order of tomato soup. A little known fact, their tomato soup is rated #3 in NYC. Now, I don't eat a lot of tomato soup, simply because the ones I have had are never very tasty. They taste tinned and metallic and are generally unpleasant, but this was NOT the case for the tomato soup at Cheese Grille. It was undeniably fresh and had the perfect blend of spices, I should've gotten a large. The grilled cheese was infinitely better than the crispy goat I'd had a few days before. This was perfectly cooked, and the cheese was lusciously ooey gooey. When the sandwich was dunked in the tomato soup it was positively scrumptious, a highly recommend doing it.I then moved onto dessert. I decided to go for the strawberry sweet grilled cheese. It's the same size as the 3 cheese, but far more rich and filling. I'd never had speculoos butter before, but it gave the sandwich a great sweetness level which was leveled out by the tartness of the strawberry jam. My only critique for this dish would be that the ice cream wasn't really necessary. Also, maybe some sliced strawberries in the sandwich? To give it more of a bite? It was a lot of soft products (speculoos butter, strawberry jam, chevre cheese) with nothing really binding it together. I definitely want to go back to Cheese Grille for more of their tomato soup, it was amazing. Also, I'm interested in trying their nachos. They make the cheese in-house with BEER! How crazy is that?! And for those of you who are vegan or gluten free, they have options for you too! So swing by if you're interested in a damn good grilled cheese. I do still stand by my first review though, go for something traditional, that's where they excel.",5,1,4
160,Elle R.,"Manhattan, NY",241,1,0,2.0,6/26/2018,"As I sit here eating VERY CLEARLY frozen ""shoestring"" fries, I must advise you to skip this spot. Not only is the service terrible and the woman at the front alarmingly rude, the food is mediocre at best. We spent $42.00 on 2 sandwiches, fries (for $7.50) and 2 beers. The beers were GREAT because they were not a product of this restaurant. When we FINALLY got the sandwiches, it was more than 25 mins later.  The fries followed shortly after and I actually said, ""well, those are definitely frozen"" as soon as I laid eyes on them. Not even salted!! I had the crispy goat and tbh it tasted good but it was hardly crispy and the ingredients were a good inch from the crust. My friend ordered the classic and it was literally EMBARRASSING. There was so little cheese on this sandwich, her boyfriend wouldn't even let me take a photo. Swear on my life there was about a tablespoon of cheese on this thing. No. No. No. I'm probably only giving 2 stars because I had avocado on my sandwich. If you want a good grilled cheese, don't come here. Not worth it.",1,,
161,Brett I.,"Harrison, NJ",272,365,112,4.0,10/31/2016,"Closer to 4.5 stars.Along with mac and cheese and PB & J, grilled cheese sandwiches have this sort of special place in the hearts of many people (including myself) because they were a staple of our childhood. Because they were relatively easy to make and because we kids liked cheese and bread, grilled cheese sandwiches were like a no-brainer for our busy parents who wanted to whip up something we'd like in a short amount of time.Fast forward to adulthood, you find that a place like Cheese Grille does them grilled cheese sandwiches, but they do them well and in a grown-up way, with good cheese and bread, and different types!Tried the HAM AND CHEESE~gruyere, ham, dijon mustard, and caramelized onions. The ham and cheese were really given a kick by the mustard (though it seemed to taste more horseradish-y than dijon... no matter, since I love both), and who doesn't like caramelized onions? Recommended.Also ordered a side of PICKLES, which was a generous helping of different kinds of pickled objects (two kinds of cucumbers, olives, and a jalapeno). I love pickles, and they did a good job.Can't wait to come back and try other sandwiches!",4,3,2
162,KC N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0,3.0,8/5/2018,Visited once and don't think I would visit again. Food tastes good. The place is alright. But everything is too overpriced. The food doesn't worth for how much it cost.,,,
163,Lauren B.,"Merritt Island, FL",26,1,0,5.0,8/3/2018,My classic grilled cheese with the chipotle aioli sauce was amazing. Such a cute little place with a great atmosphere and cool art on the walls.

166,Victoria L.,"Ridgefield, NJ",67,13,0,1.0,5/14/2017,"I would have had a memorable experience with this place but the cashier named Mike, who is apparently the owner doesn't know the first thing about customer service. First off, there is no sign up front that tells us to be fully prepared with our order when we get to the register. There was no one waiting behind us, and we stood near the register reading the menu that was above the register which has a purpose to be read. He tells us that we cannot be in front of the register without our order and is too lazy to answer simple questions, such as ""do you have soup?"" After we are done with our purchase he proceeds to talk down to us saying ""you see, now isn't it much faster when you know your order"" Put more salt in your ""spicy"" campbells tomato soup instead of your soul.",1,5,
167,Kaitlin N.,"New York, NY",338,26,43,5.0,12/23/2016,"This place is dope. If you're a grilled cheese person you need to go here. The guy working at the counter let me in before they opened (didn't realize they opened at 12) and was really nice. The vibes in the restaurant are really chill- you just kind of sit wherever, they have tables and counter seating. You can also order to go at their outdoor counter in the summer.I've gotten the crispy goat cheese grilled cheese twice and it's unbelievable. Apparently it's one of their most popular sandwiches. The sides are awesome too. I've had the stuffed Mac and cheese balls, sweet potato tots and Cheese fries. I've never been disappointed with a meal here. It's really casual and laid back, but they serve wine. Idk what's better than grilled cheese and wine. If you're in the LES you must stop by.",1,,

The sandwiches are also good, but I must say the grande nachos are really good. I switched them with the fries and they are really good. The nachos could easily be split between 2-3 people so keep that in mind. Especially if your thinking of grabbing more food later.",,,
170,David S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",208,238,709,5.0,1/2/2016,"What can I say about this place?  Well I'll start by saying it is a cool little spot in the lower east side.  We heard about this place through the good reviews on Yelp about their Sloppy Joe grilled cheese sandwiches and tater tots.  Though we didn't get their tots because I am not a sweet potato fan, we did still enjoy this meal regardless.  Their take on the sloppy job sandwich is very good and tasty.  They must have known we were from Texas because the sandwich had a hint of jalapenos in it where we put jalapenos in just about everything down here.   Actually that is how the sandwich comes, so it was extra good.  We got the regular fries and onion rings with this.  We will try anyone's onion rings and these were very good.  We noticed a lot of people were also getting the tomato soup with their sandwich, so our daughter decided to order a small cup of soup, and all I have to say is that was  the best choice of the day, because I ended up ordering one for myself.  The tomato soup was awesome so definitely order it with your sandwich and use it to dip your sandwich in it.  The BEST!!  It is very good comfort food that's for sure.Make sure you check in on Yelp and get your complimentary beer or coke with your meal for free.  The only recommendation to the owners is to put up a better sign in front of their place, something more visible from across the street because more than likely you will be getting off of the subway from that side of the street.",1,,
171,Victoria S.,"Flushing, NY",272,29,48,4.0,7/25/2017,"I *love* cheese so naturally, I love grilled cheese sandwiches. I had never actually went to a restaurant that specializes in grilled cheese so my friend and I decided to go here for a late lunch one day. The restaurant had a few customers here and there but it was empty enough that you could sit anywhere you would like to. We sat at the bar so we could look outside as we ate our food.  I ordered the Little Italy because I really love pesto and wanted to try it on a grilled cheese. When our food was brought over to us, I was salivating. The food smelled really good :^) and the bread was a beautiful golden brown (something I can't achieve on my own grilled cheese sandwiches because I burn them all).The sandwich wasn't super greasy (which I appreciate) and when I ripped the sandwich halves apart, you could see the oh so beautiful stringy cheese. My first bite, I was in love. The sandwich was so savory and the ingredients really complemented each other. It really reminded me of eating an actual Italian dish! I would definitely come here again if I wanted another grilled cheese (tbh I'm guaranteed to come again because when am I not in the mood for a grilled cheese??) even though it's kinda small for the price (but still worth it!).",,,

Fresh cheeses plenty of options, huge portion of my side order of sweet potato fries and some olives and dressing on the side! You order at the counter and they bring you the food. The place is small but the awnings were open on a nice breezy summer day. I used my YELP check in for a free soft drink for my friend. Mike was working at the counter. He took my food allergies very serious. I felt safe eating the food here. Mikes great!I had the Crispy Goat grilled cheese sandwich. It had bacon and avocado. My friend had the Mediterranean. We each ordered sweet potato fries. She took hers home. We could have split one. The portions for the small size order is huge! I can not describe how delicious the sandwich is. There's no words for it! You just have to go try it for yourself. Who doesn't like a grill cheese sandwich. Lunch for less than $15.00 can't be beat. I will return!",3,1,2

As of now, there's a Yelp check-in offer for a free brew. Do it up! * The sweet potato tots looks ridiculousBesides missing out on making my meal 100x better by doing the above, I still had a nice time crushing a really good classic grilled cheese and a glass of wine here.

178,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",144,243,151,5.0,7/9/2015,"Stumbled upon this place when our original plans fell through and it was a hit! My cousins and I have walked/drove by this place many times and only now did we realize what a gem it really is. You order in the front and then they will bring your food out to you when it's ready. The sitting area is very nice, open and when it's not too hot out definitely very comfortable.okay if you're here for lunch GET THE LUNCH SPECIAL! It'll include any grill cheese sandwich along with a side for $9.50 after tax it'll be a little over $10. what a steal! A grill cheese by itself is already $8-9 so do yourself a favor.The Mediterranean: chèvre, asiago, tomato, basil and truffle oil. Truffle oil has a very special place in my heart and was the reason I got this sandwich. It did not disappoint. The cheese was gooey and everything worked together perfectly.Crispy Goat: chevre, goat gouda, bacon and avocado. The goat flavor is VERY strong in this sandwich so if you're not a fan of goat cheeses I would not recommend this. But if you can handle the goat flavor then this will be a winner for you. The bacon and avocado add good texture and flavor.Garden Melt: asiago, red pepper, arugula, olive tapenade. Simple and good. All the ingredients work together I really love arugula in sandwiches. The cheese used in this sandwich also made it less messy than the other ones.Classic: cheddar. if you're not feeling that adventurous then stick to the cheddar. The flavor is good and you can't really go wrong.The sweet potato tots. is BOMB. They came out hot and nicely fried. They all came out to golden perfection",4,,3

Special sangria was also on point!",,,1
181,Ridd M.,"Montclair, NJ",188,73,66,3.0,7/20/2016,"Overall, 3.5 I don't venture out to this area of Manhattan as frequently mostly because it's just not the easiest area to get to, but when I heard about another shop that specializes in grilled cheese, I was convinced to make the trip. Who doesn't LOVE grilled cheese?? The place has a nice casual and relaxing ambiance and isn't that big but a good enough size to fit a larger group (they have high long tables with stools). I think its an ideal spot to grab some lunch when in the area or a quick dinner. This is what I got: Garden Melt Sandwich - now I know this is suppose to be a grilled cheese but I just felt there was TOO much cheese (I barely ever say that) and you couldn't taste the other ingredients as much nor were they very flavorful. The heavy cheese made it very filling though. Overall, it wasn't bad when you dipped it into the tomato soup, but I've had a lot better grilled cheeses elsewhere.  I was expecting a lot from this sandwich since the shop is centered around their grilled cheese options, but came out a little disappointed. They had tabasco hot sauce and ketchup on the table but I really wish they would bring in some spicy hot sauces as this would be a great added flavor for the sandwiches (I don't know why so many places only have Tabaco sauce as its really not a good hot sauce at all). For the price (sandwiches average around $8/$9), I think they can make these a little better!  Spicy Tomato Soup - it wasn't that spicy but it was flavorful and a nice dip for the grilled cheese. Sweet Potato Tater Tots with a Chipotle Aoli - I was excited for this as I love potato tots and have a new liking for sweet potato fries. They were a little softer and sweeter then regular potato tots would be but I liked them as they were different and fun to eat. Order also came with a few olives, which was a nice addition. There are a decent amount of vegetarian options and you can ask to omit/add on ingredients to fit dietary needs. You go up to the cashier to order and they will bring your order to your table on wooden slates. Service was fast and efficient.  I'm glad I tried it but probably wouldn't return until I've sampled all the other grilled cheeses in the city :)",2,1,1

My boy friend and I stumbled upon this late night gem as we were ending our night of drinking. At that moment nothing sounded better than some warm ooey gooey cheese at 2am. And better yet, when you check in you get a free brew!Cheese Grille offers around 7 grilled cheese varieties and an extensive beer and wine list. The seating area is first come first serve. Go order at the register first and then find a seat where the server will bring out your food. I went ahead with the Little Italy Sandwich, tomato soup and sweet potato tots and I don't regret any of my late night indulgences. The grilled cheese was hot off the press and melted in my mouth. The Little Italy was so good, it beat the Sloppy Joe my boyfriend was having. The tomato soup is really good to dip your sandwich in. As for the sweet potato tots, I've never had them before. They're heavier than regular potato tater tots but still good. Cheese Grille, I hope we meet again at 2am.",,,

My Crispy Goat was delicious, it had more than enough goat cheese and what's even better added in there? BACON! Thick sliced pieces of bacon and avocado to offset the heaviness of both. Ya can't go wrong with their Fried Mac&Cheese! It was not oily at all whereas some places I've tried ends up leaking out oil. It came with a side of really really good marinara sauce too!

That sandwich - perfectly toasted bread with several cheese types, bacon and avocado. Freaking heaven. The tots were served with a sweet sauce that's good, but would probably add a little wasabi or sriracha to give it a nice kick.
