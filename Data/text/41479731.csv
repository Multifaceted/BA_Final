0,William C.,"Chevy Chase, MD",219,26,1,4.0,10/28/2018,"Hmm, some of the complaints here seem to be: ""there were too many TVs and too much sports at this sports bar!""Well yeah. But if you are trying to find a specific game when a lot of games are on (i.e. Sunday 1pm), lots of TVs with lots of different games is a good thing.I came here to watch a game and have a couple beers, and it was a solid experience. The bartender was friendly, and was chatting it up with a bunch of the patrons.Also, drink prices were not bad. I had a Bud Light and a Goose Island IPA and it came out to $10 total. WOWZA! All sarcasm aside, if you are reading this from out of town, those prices are quite good for the East Village.",,,
1,Forget The F.,"New York, NY",4,84,0,1.0,7/2/2018,"Worst bartenders in the city, even Double Down Saloon, a place that should have an attitude has some of the best bartenders around. Stillwater? One of the bartender females haggled me because of a dollar, like I was nobody. I used to live nearby and used to go at least 5 times a month or more, and never once has any of these bartenders got me a drink or hooked up a discount or even offered some wings, let me slide for a few cents/a dollar (had to go to the ATM to get 20 dollars to give the girl a dollar, no lie!) I've went to a place before only 3 times, and the 3rd time they offered me something. I'm not out here lookin to get freebies but it's a nice thing to offer. Once I told the bartender I would give her a big tip when the final bill comes because I was alone first, then some friends came, and when we were getting ready to leave, she asks me for the tip I said I'd give, so I gave her a 10 spot. Little did I know, my friends put the tip in for me already, and she asked me this AFTER they had left, knowing she was getting more money from me. If that's not a bitch, I don't know what is.",,1,
2,Zoilyna P.,"Morris Heights, Bronx, NY",7,2,3,3.0,6/8/2018,Great prices. But they only had one waitress so service was slow but workers were friendly. Nice outdoors area where you can sit in front of the bar. Wasn't very packed when we first got here at about 8pm.After being there for about 3 hours we noticed the service wasn't that great. The waitress kept forgetting to bring us things we ordered and we'd have to remind them. We also asked for the check and then they came to check on us minutes later and we had to ask again. They then didn't understand how we wanted to split the order and insisted we hadn't said what we said we did.Besides the slow service and whatnot the food and drinks were good.,,,

Updated review","I came in here last Thursday. The last few weeks I looked up this bar again but kept forgetting to go in until last week.I didn't intend to stay long. To ensure that, I ordered the bourbon wings to go on the phone before I began walking from 5 blocks away,By the time I get there, the wings are already done and packed up. I had ordered a draft before I even mentioned the wings order.The wings came with celery and carrot sticks plus  2 containers of bleu cheese. The wings were fall off the bone like good smoked barbecue.",2,1,1

5,Mary L.,"Longmont, CO",14,76,59,5.0,3/3/2018,Perfect day drinking bar with a great hamburger and even a garden burger for me. Cold beer and delicious spicy red beer to start out Saturday!  And being an OSU alum it is extra special,,,
6,Owen T.,"Manhattan, NY",104,2,3,1.0,8/16/2017,"I am a longtime resident of the East Village and have often come in to Stillwater for cheap eats and beer. But no more. Today, I went in for lunch and ordered the lunch special: a burger and a beer. I have come to expect inattentive service here (though today I was the only person eating, so...) and no one has high expectations of the food. However, my burger (ordered medium rare) arrived completely raw on the inside. After about ten minutes, I finally got the attention of the waitress, who took the burger without apology, and soon returned with the recooked Patty, from which I had taken a few bites. It was still uncooked on the inside. Not rare, but raw.But here is the part that prompted this review. She spoke to the owners, who were sitting at a table nearby. They muttered something to her, but did not even look at me, despite the fact that I was ten feet from them and that no one else was in the dining room. The waitress came back under orders to offer me something else from the menu (no thanks), and I told her I was surprised none of the owners had said anything to me. She went over and shortly one them came by to apologize in the most cursory fashion. He voided my check, in fairness, but have no indication of genuine concern or contrition.As I write, they are still sitting there, ignoring me. What a shame. I doubt this review will deter anyone who wants cheap food and booze from coming here, which is probably why the owners feel they can be so cavalier about feeding raw meat to customers. But really, it's a disgrace: there are plenty of other dives on the neighborhood. I recommend avoiding this one.",2,,
7,Ameer S.,"Chicago, IL",191,256,91,3.0,7/29/2017,"I enjoyed the outdoor seating and the $4 happy hour drafts were a great deal, but it had a strange vibe with old men at the bar who seem to be regulars. They death stared me as I walked in. The young female bartender was also tending to a couple of those creepy men a bit ""too much,"" and took forever to take my order despite the fact that she was not really working. A bit desperate for tips, it seemed.",1,,1
8,Jenée R.,"Manhattan, NY",377,2,0,4.0,11/5/2017,Came here to watch football this past Sunday. The bar was full but there was plenty of seating in the side room and high top tables behind the bar. Mix of older and younger patrons. The bartender was very friendly and welcoming. There are also darts are available behind the bar.The Philly cheesesteak nachos were exactly what we needed. Loaded with cheese and tender meat with plenty of guac and pico on the side. The rest of our group had the wings which they loved. A lot of meat and a straightforward Buffalo sauce. The medium was pretty mild so go for hot if you're looking for some spice.,,,

We had agreed to meet up for a meal before the show and ended up at the Stillwater. Our server was awesome as a few members of our party behaved unconscionably, flailing about and squealing that they were so excited about the show that they couldn't eat. Grown women acted like 10 year olds. I grabbed a nibble of food off my plate before the ringleader insisted we leave. Our gracious server boxed up our food. I was so glad to get these women out of your hair. Reminder to self: never go to a restaurant with ""those people.""",,1,
11,Alessandro C.,"New York, NY",356,41,2,2.0,1/28/2017,"Stillwater is your basic sports bar. TVs everywhere and frat guys surrounding them. Don't be fooled by it's chill and secluded exterior. It's full of rambunctious men. The service was pretty decent but felt as though the waitress really didn't care to be there, which I can totally understand. The drinks were NOT strong enough. I had a whiskey ginger and it tasted like just ginger ale. If there's one thing I hate it's being deprived of a decent amount of whiskey. Luckily, They were an average price range or else I would have had to say something. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries and my friend had the Philly cheesesteak nachos. He said they were magnificent. I didn't try them because I don't eat red meat. My chicken tenders were pretty good and the waffle fries were delicious. The real star was the honey mustard that came with them though. I've never enjoyed a condiment more than I did with that honey mustard. I will say that at the end of the night I threw up due it not sitting well in my stomach. I'm not saying that it was specifically the food that made me sick but I know it wasn't from drinking....I'll probably pass on Stillwater the next time it's presented to me as an option.",3,,
12,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1048,236,4.0,9/27/2016,"Stillwater is a perfectly acceptable divey sports bar with several TV screens and decent speakers so you can overhear the commentary if you like. I came here as a last-ditch resort in finding a bar where we could be seated comfortably for the presidential debates. They have two rooms - a main room with the bar and a juke box, and a side room with sit-down tables and three additional screens. We sat down in the side room, opting for a more comfortable debate-viewing experience. On a quiet night, I'm sure you could request for whatever channel you like - the bartenders are accommodating like that.There's a special deal nearly every night - $4 drafts and half-off wings on Mondays, for instance. Yet this place doesn't get too too crowded since it's off into one of the streets. I could see myself coming here for a couple of drinks to chill out if I a) wanted to watch a game in peace, b) had a date with someone I'm not interested in impressing and/or did not wish to be spotted with him/her or c) I wanted to get a little tipsy for cheap somewhere else other than my apartment.",,,

16,Sarah L.,"Zug, Switzerland",0,9,0,2.0,4/7/2017,"It hurts me to rate a bar this low when it flies an Oklahoma State flag. While I can handle the not so gorgeous interior, what I can't handle is rudeness or warm beer. We sat down and we're given a drink menu and then told by the bartender to come up and order at the bar when we were ready. Totally fine! So when I walked up there to order some drinks for my table, she looked visibly annoyed I was taking her out of her conversation with a man at the bar. Well sorry, but I'm doing what you told me and paying you? When we got our beers we took sips and realized, oh these are warm... they were beers out of the tap, so not just some bottle that was left somewhere and forgotten, this was draft. A warm beer, cheap or not, isn't something I want to hang around and drink. All in all, I wish that a place that had Oklahoma State memorabilia on the walls, a OSU flag flying outside and carrying the name Stillwater, would have a little bit of that Cowboy care that I came to know and love while a student there.",,1,

It was a Friday night, our bartender was down to earth. It seemed that all the other customers were munching away on their bar grub, and had some beers. Prices are reasonable, and like most bars, $10 minimum for debit/credit cards. They have an outdoor seating in the front that isn't fancy, but seems narrow enough to be out of the way from people that are walking up and down the street.

Not the most amazing burger ever crushed at a bar.  I would order the philly cheesesteak, I have, and that thing is awesome.  The wings are good.  The chips and salsa is pretty good.  Its a cool bar,  go to kick it, have some good beers, watch some sports, and have fun.  I think you will.",1,2,

28,Cheyenne M.,"New York, NY",179,19,0,5.0,3/9/2016,"What is anyone talking about in their reviews?Atmosphere:This is a sports bar, also has a divey feel to it. If that isn't your scene however (why are you in a sports bar), there is a huge table seated area in the back. Many screens to watch the games and if you don't want a game or it isn't sports season you can request what you want to watch. two bathrooms not just one, and they are clean. Someone comes out almost every 20 minutes to clean them all night. If your drunk friend puked in it and didn't tell you and then you walked in, that's why it's dirty. Plenty of stools around the bar and tables and chairs all around too. In the spring/summer/fall, they have outside seating as well. There's a dart board, a juke box and arcades in the back. The only thing they don't have is karaoke and thank heavens for that. The last thing anyone needs to hear after getting out of work, is a horrible group of barely there girls trying to be Beyoncé (can I get an Amen!!!). Drinks:Their drinks are awesome and at super low prices compared to all the surrounding bars. Their house liquors don't taste cheap at all. They are super generous with the shot levels they pour. The drink specials are anyone's dream, especially if you love margaritas or beers. Their stuff on tap is actually cold. Please tell me another bar in LES that actually has very chilled beer on tap..... I'll wait! The bartenders there are also very seasoned (shoutouts to Nikki and Mari) and can make killer off the menu cocktails too. Food:Dude!!!!!!!!!!!The food is bomb! There is no proper way to word this. Anything on that menu is bomb. -My favorite is the medium buffalo wings. They have kick ass sauce (for the freaks of nature out there) and a mild sauce as well (for the not so badass). #winghappiness-The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad served with a hearty amount of warm grilled chicken is great-Waffle fries: I hate fries but have a soft spot for these. Definitely try these. They are great by themselves. If you want to be extra daring get them with melted cheese and bacon. They are amazing!!!Other great options are the loaded potato skins, the hummus plate and their off the menu pulled pork mac and cheese (chili mac is dope too for those who can't eat pork) Anything you get, you cannot go wrong with. Trust it.Service:The reason I frequent this particular bar so much is because I absolutely love the service and the bartenders that work there. It's literally my home away from work. My place of sanity and what keeps me going during the week. They are great and some of my favorite people in the world. Never rude, stuck up. Never. They are amazing!!! I will go there even when I don't work in the LES anymore. That's how amazing they make each and everyone of my experiences there!!!Why are you still reading this? Go there right now!!!",2,,

I had pretty low expectations but this side dish got the job done. It comes in a cute ceramic bowl and there's more mac & cheese in there than it appears. I've definitely gotten way less for $5.Fries: Decent as well. Very thick and rather soft.Service: Our waitress was friendly and accommodating.

I've honestly been more comfortable and smelled similar odors on a crowded subway in the heat of summer.  At halftime, it was no mystery that half the bar left.

For a bar, it's really roomy inside, and decorated very much like a local bar should be: chalkboards, traffic lights, beer signs, and flat-screen TVs all tuned to some incarnation of ESPN on the walls.I wanted to love this place, mostly because it's always exciting to find a new place that takes chicken wings as seriously as I do. And indeed the wings were good; as my friend promised, they ""fall right off the bone"" and are surprisingly tangy-sweet. I don't know if they necessarily pair up well with bleu cheese, but the fries are definitely a required add-on. Of course, the wings would have tasted even better if they hadn't gotten cold while our waitress completely messed up our order. We wanted two baskets of fries and three of wings...so she brought us three of fries and two of wings. Um. And she got two of us the wrong drinks. She seemed nice enough about it, until we realized that the reason we weren't seeing her was not because she was busy with other patrons but because she was hanging out behind the bar.

We both thought the place was cozy and unpretentious, though neither of us were bowled over by the warmth of the bartenders. The crowd was chill and enjoying the various diversions such as darts and Buck Hunter. My only real criticism of Stillwater is this: If you are going to call yourself an expat Oklahoma State bar, then where is the hanging jersey of former Cowboy great Barry Sanders?

So, the bar allows for a 4 and 5 year old to run around the pool table while the waitress trips around and over them carrying $2 can's of PBR and watered down Blue Moon with a lemon wedge instead of orange. (I'm a beer snob, this angers me)When someone would get up to use the bathroom, she continually asked if she could take their stall for another party.Interrupted us at least three times to offer us free beer she accidentally put on someone else's tab, then got insulted when we said no thank you.The bathrooms were small and smelled, covered in toilet paper and writing on the walls and mirrors and doors.The front of the bar where we sat has an open bay window, which all of the customers continually stood in front of to smoke cigarettes, which meant all the smoke came inside the bar.  Just as I was about to ask the waitress to say something, she went outside to join them.Definitely not a place I will be returning to any time soon.",2,,

It is just too bad that the bar is so otherwise unremarkable.  There is outdoor seating during the early part of the night when it is nice out, too.

This is one of my dad's favorite bars to eat and watch sports at. We were starving last night after driving my dad in from his adventures with us in Queens. A philly cheesesteak sandwich for me hit the spot. My dad enjoyed his catfish po' boy with tomato slices instead of fries. He usually gets the triple grilled cheese with bacon and tomato but he's trying to eat slightly more healthy...but that didn't stop him from stealing lots of my fries. Eric got a shrimp basket which was good except we forgot that they are ALWAYS out of cocktail sauce. We started out with the sausage chili appetizer which is always good but seemed smaller than previously.The waitstaff seems to have changed since I was last in and that's a good thing since many of the waitresses in the past seemed to barely be able to breathe without thinking really deeply about it.

The pool table is a bit cramped by the walls, but it makes it interesting. The bartenders are friendly and attentive, but the waitstaff can be a little inattentive if there is a big party in the 2nd room. No bells and whistles, but a great place to grab some drinks.",,,
98,Jessica A.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,181,0,4.0,1/20/2008,Solid EV dive but not so divey. Not too crowded on Sat night and highly accomodating to very late night drunken Buck Hunting shot taking jukebox playing pool sharking dirty fun. Solid.,,,

100,Megan Z.,"Morgantown, WV",0,1,0,5.0,9/7/2008,"You need to go here on Sunday or Monday (prefferably during happy hour) and order the burbon wings.  They are $3.50 on these days and always AMAZING.. meat fall off the bone, oh my they are the best a chicken can be!  seriously!  and with $3.00 drafts during happy hour. . you can be poor and drunk and full on yumminess for cheap.  GO THERE!  maybe there is nothing else spectacular about here, but believe me the wings are enough.",,,

102,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",34,575,0,2.0,7/27/2008,is it possible to employ such a terrible bar tender? he delivered some of the worst drinks i have ever tasted and even managed to screw up patron shots by putting salt on the limes.,1,,1
103,Muppet A.,"New York, NY",48,82,5,3.0,7/11/2008,"Good dive bar for cheap beers and friendly service. Well-situated for people-watching and street seating. The selection wasn't beyond the expected, but $3 for a low-key beer before a show across the street sounds just fine to me.",1,,
