I have been mostly for a very late lunch, so the place is never super busy. The only thing the bothers me is how slow it always seems to be. I get the impression that is supposed to be a quick lunch stop, which it would be if you order ahead. The whole place seems to just move slow for no apparent reason.",9,1,6

Updated review",Another morning where I have visited this establishment for breakfast. They are fast and easy to do business with in most cases. The food is good and the service is friendly.  But what surprises me are the so many choices of coffee shops within several feet of each other that seem to be always busy as well.,8,3,3
2,Mark F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,3,1.0,11/10/2018,Continuously tasteless. Keep expecting more but nothing has any taste. Even salt and pepper can't ward off the blandness. Should a grilled chicken with LTO mustard really have no flavor AT ALL. I don't know how they do it.,,,
3,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,581,505,4.0,3/6/2018,"Lenwich is awesome. They have multiple locations throughout the city, but I typically stop by this location on weekend mornings for a sandwich. They sell pretty much any ingredient you would need in order to put together a custom sandwich or wrap. The bread is always fresh, and I love the shredded lettuce. I always make a custom sandwich, and they always get it right. Lenwich also offers custom salads. It's great to have this spot in the neighborhood.",1,,1
4,Joel S.,"New York, NY",36,639,14,3.0,4/21/2018,"This sandwich shop has potential.  It's generic, but efficient.  There's a big variety of sandwiches, salads and bowls.  I split an Emma's hero sandwich with SHMBO.  She switched out Swiss cheese for Muenster.  She wisely asked for the bread to be toasted.  The main negative about this sandwich is that the hero bread is lackluster.  It's squishy and almost the consistency of a hamburger bun.  A great sandwich starts with great bread.  Toasting it saved the sandwich.  The sandwich was expertly assembled and was pretty good.  My wife loved it, and I thought that it was good (but I took one for the team and got something that I knew that she would like).  I need to order a  more interesting sandwich on more interesting bread, maybe focaccia, to see what the story was.  All of the tables were dirty.  Four star potential.  We'll see next time.",,,
5,Eric R.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,17,13,5.0,4/19/2018,"Vegetarian sandwich is great. I'm slowly making that ""healthy"" transition and this sandwich made it easy. It was tasty, flavorful and had just the right ingredients to make it a 5 star sandwich my opinion. I've been a foodie for some time and sure recommending this spot and food to everyone will be appreciated.",,,
6,Victoria D.,"Flushing, NY",64,35,29,2.0,4/15/2018,Longer than average wait time if you order there. The way the line set up is really disorganized. I also had a guy tell me he'll make my salad when he feels like opening the salad bar. Uh ok? There are better ways to handle busy situations.I honestly just order online and get the grilled cheese with tomato and avocado here. Everything else is overpriced and the majority of the food quality is unsatisfactory.,,,

8,David B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",44,1,0,1.0,9/24/2018,"This is by far the worst Lenwich that I have gone to. I consistently have a 15-20 minute wait for food. The final time I ordered a meatball platter...4 meatballs on a plate with vegetables. I watched the guy make it in 15 seconds.....too bad he chose to clean the grill, bull shit and take his time to get to orders. The place was empty which was even more frustrating and it wasn't closing for several hours. Im not going here anymore definitely not good service.",,,
9,Sarah L.,"Montclair, NJ",74,118,49,3.0,3/24/2017,"Typical sandwich shop. They close at 7 on Saturday's and shut down the oven 15 minutes before so if you're coming in last minute, expect a cold cut. Got the Emma sandwich which had (a lot!) of turkey and some ham on 7 grain. Made fresh and quickly. Overall, a decent spot for a quick bite, nothing remarkable.",2,,2
10,Cindy L.,"New York, NY",179,177,329,1.0,8/24/2017,"I have been ordering food from here for six years and that ends today. I stopped there on the way home and was given the wrong sandwich but did not realize until I made it all the way back to my apartment. I called, thinking they would send me the correct sandwich, but boy was I wrong. I was basically blamed for taking the wrong sandwich, when the cashier said ""ma'am here is your sandwich"" and was then told she tried to yell for me but I had already crossed the street and she ""didn't want to die"". She then told me I could come and pick up my corrected sandwich. I have never experienced such horrible customer service from any establishment as I did just now. I will continue to visit other Lenwich locations but this one has lost a six year customer.",2,1,
11,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,3/31/2016,The UES needed a place like Lewin. I came here yesterday to grab something quick to eat. Most of the restaurants around are sit down. I have to say I was impressed the salads and sandwiches are huge here. I love! How they chop up your salad into small pieces and mix everything. The menu is diverse. offering breakfast all day and lunch style foods. This place reminds me of a deli mixed with a fast casual restaurant where all of the food is infront of you behind the glass. you point to whet you want. They offer hot and cold sandwiches all of which are numbered or has some sort of funny name attached to  it. The sandwiches are really good. 2 people could defiantly split 1 sandwich or wrap. I love the salads here they mix everything together really well and chop everything up into really small pieces. Overall. This is a good spot if you want to grab something quick. Portions are big. Salads are amazing. I will def be back.,5,3,4
12,Loriey H.,"Flushing, NY",0,28,18,4.0,4/23/2018,The salad bar at this location impressed me with how clean it was and how fresh the ingredients looked. I've gotten several coworkers hooked on the lenwich and fish'wich. Both are delicious and the fresh veggies helps me pretend it's somewhat healthy;). Just be careful when making special requests for the sandwich especially when ordering online for pickup or for delivery. They've gotten my order wrong 100% of the time. Tip: call and tell them of the requests and they will notify the sandwich maker --hopefully to make your perfect sandwich! I've also tried the vegetarian and it's light and fresh. Give it a try!,,,

15,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,3.0,8/5/2016,"A fantastic toasted Lenwich sandwich- so good!

18,Ken K.,"New York, NY",43,65,42,4.0,5/4/2017,"I occasionally come here for breakfast. I usually get a wrap or egg sandwich. I like the pastrami hash wrap. It has egg, pastrami, and potatoes.

19,Grant E.,"New York, NY",22,146,94,1.0,3/27/2016,"Got a chicken cordon bleu here the other day. I was mildly satisfied. The sandwich was decent but lacking in size and absent any sides, an issue when the sandwich costs me 10$ alone. The salad is decent as it offers a good selection of choices at a decent price. However, once again it's still slightly overpriced, especially when you consider justsalad is right around the corner. I would eat here over subway, but only if those were my only two options would I chose to return here.",2,,

21,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,3.0,11/6/2015,"I don't quite get why Lenny's changed its name to Lenwich. Seems kind of dopey to me, but they did not ask my opinion.Lenwich is a clean, basic, expensive and fattening sandwich shop (have you ever looked at the calories for a sandwich? Jesus!!!). The salad bar looks reasonably fresh and clean but it too is quite pricey. The staff is friendly if a bit bored.",5,,2
22,Milly F.,"Queens, NY",0,17,0,2.0,3/21/2018,"Websters dictionary defines the word disgusting as strong indignation. I describe it as Lenwich. I ordered a meatball parm and the bread was very soggy. I may as well have dipped it in water. The parm was also of HUGE portion. This is the reason why America is #1 in greed and #1 in obesity. Will not return. Gave 2 stars because I know other people must like it. Overall, bewitched by the bad experience.",,,
23,Chelsea V.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,1,0,3.0,2/8/2018,"I've been a regular to this establishment for many years and usually I am used to coming in to rude cashiers (especially in the morning) but the 2 young ladies in the front around the night time are super friendly and nice, they listen to each customer and make sure that their wait is short and sweet. They make sure the chefs make the sandwiches exactly how a customer orders them and provide a few laughs and interesting conversation topics while we wait. I've gone out of pocket a few times to give them a great tip because honestly they deserve it. Last week though one of the girls wasn't there and instead lenwhich had another girl with a rude attitude, but the girl that's usually in the back welcomed me with a warm smile so I didn't mind that my dynamic duo wasn't available that week. The food is good but not for the price that they're selling for, to make it worse their prices have gone up again since I was there last week. Lenwhich is literally selling $10+ sandwiches which is ridiculous, they replaced the big plastic salad bowls for the small grain bowls and are selling them for regular big bowl prices. It's kind of insulting honestly given that they are basically stealing to customers who have been loyal to them since their opening. Lenwhich has became a last resort restaurant because of how expensive it is  just buying a sandwich, chip and a drink is close to 20+ dollars and they don't offer any combo meal prices, any sales-nothing to make it cheaper on a customer. It's only convenient when you leave work because it's a small snack while on your way home but with that small snack comes a dent in your wallet that I don't think I'm up for all the time. The 2 girls in the front have had to experience pissed off customers yelling at them for the prices being too expensive while the girls continue to express that they have no control over how much something is inside the store. It is truly a shame because they really make your experience in Lenwhich a little better after hearing how much you have to pay for what you've ordered.",,,

Always efficient, dependable, consistent, customer-centric, professional, considerate, and genuine which are qualities quickly disappearing from the ""fast food"" deli industry today.

I love that they'll pretty much make any sandwich or salad I want, and I've never had an issue with the quality of the ingredients.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm not crazy about their breakfast food. The egg sandwiches can sometimes be soggy, and they've messed up my breakfast sandwich order more than once via Seamless.

I didn't return it but it was definitely not what I ordered. The ""fish"" was mostly bread crumbs with some kind of meat inside. More breadcrumbs less meat ! The whole wheat toast was semi-burnt and soggy while the tomatoes were not fresh and the lettuce had brown spots on it !

37,Trusha S.,"Fremont, CA",41,82,15,2.0,6/12/2015,"This place is just too complicated. Going in, there are too many different counters and rules on how to order. I wanted to change something on my sandwich but couldn't even figure out at which counter I needed to do that in. And they make you carry an empty grocery bag as you wait for your order? Seemed a little odd for me.The good parts about this place: if you use LevelUp or the Lenwich app, you get a $7 credit. Their black and white cookies are good.Their coffee isn't bad either.",2,,

Multiple people at different times and with different problems... Every time I try placing an order here it ruins my mood and meal.The only reason why this place is always gonna be in business is that is convenient, it's on people's way to work and towards the subway, But I would rather walk further and spend my money elsewhere not coming back here.",,,

Slightly pricey, but sooo good. I'm not a fan of Lenny's salads, but I have loved every sandwich I've gotten here.This Lenny's in particular seems better run than the rest. Quick service, clean areas, fast table turnover. The only unpleasant surprise of my visit was that I was in the women's bathroom when a male employee simply walked right in to start cleaning.

It's just a solid place to grab a sandwich no frills attached.They have an extensive list of sandwich favorites to choose from, and you can also build your own. Yes, it is a NYC chain sandwich shop, a little better then Subway and a few others, but nothing super amazing either. Just a good spot if you are craving a decent sandwich or wrap.It's also a good place for a guy like me that is dieting and trying to watch the fat and calorie content. Since it's close to home I have dropped in here a few times on weekends for lunch. With more than enough healthy options to choose from there is no problem building a healthy meal. Grilled chicken sandwich on toasted 7-grain bread with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and deli mustard along with a diet soda. I love deli mustard, which helps a pretty boring sandwich become tolerable. Pretty easy to make a sandwich the way you want it here. This location is clean and the counter staff is quick too, along with outside seating which is a must on a nice day.I do loved grilled chicken, but boy am I getting tired of it!",7,4,7
45,Ashley S.,"Manhattan, NY",286,457,898,2.0,8/27/2015,"Not a fan. I came here and ordered a salad. I don't eat chicken, so I couldn't have more than half of the salads on their menu. I asked the staff member if you're able to make your own. He said yes, so I did that. After adding a couple ingredients, I asked the guy if there was a limit to the ingredients in the make-your-own-salad. He said no, so I added a few more. Should have known better!! I wish he would have told me that you're charged for each ingredient. My salad came out to $14 without meat -- ridiculous! That's double the price of the non-meat salads on their menu. And the salad itself wasn't even that great. My salad had a blend of arugula and mixed greens, with feta cheese, olives, squash, brussel sprouts, quinoa, edamame, tomatoes, and yellow peppers. The ingredients were fresh, although the brussel sprouts were pretty undercooked. I asked for oil and vinegar as my dressing. I assumed it would be some sort of decent vinegar like red wine or balsamic, but no, it was plain white vinegar. For the price, it was definitely not worth it. And even if it would have been the $7 normal salad price, I wouldn't order it again. I will not be returning here!",1,2,

Small enough to finish, everything was in proportion- and fresh.On the other hand, the Classic Italian was on a roll that was so big that to eat any more than half of it would have seemed excessive.

That ends today after the poor treatment I received from the orangutans behind the counter. I respectfully ordered my sandwich and waited for it to be prepared. I took it into the dining area and before I could finish opening the paper on my sandwich, I heard a snickering. I looked up and to my surprise, head ape cashier was laughing at me and making eye contact.

It gets pretty crowded on the weekends, but it's just a great, casual place to go for a quick bite. The grilled chicken they use for the salad is really fresh and I love the balsamic vinaigrette.

66,Rich T.,"REGO PARK, NY",0,15,1,2.0,5/8/2015,"Went into this Lenny's today for a fast bite because I was in the area and was pressed for time.  At mid-day there was no line to order my sandwich.  Requested a toasted & buttered pumpernickel bagel with american cheese from the guy in the back, who then handed me a receipt and a remote-call device that alerts you when your order is ready.  Okay so far, so good.It all went south from there.  I picked up a small bag of Sun chips and a bottle of Diet Coke, then waited a good 8 - 10 minutes for my sandwich to be ready while about 15 or so workers milled about behind the counters.  The girl behind the register tells me I owe $8.31.  I looked at her with mild disbelief, but I paid because I didn't have time to refuse the order over the price and start again somewhere else.  Took my food over to a table, sat down and ate while a procession of assorted kids and hipsters milled about and created an incredible cacophony of sound all around me.  Bagel was small and the cheese had not even been melted onto it.  Some guy decided to bus the table next to me while I was eating and even asked me to move my feet so he could sweep under my table while I was eating.  I don't know about you, but I just love it when someone sweeps dirt particles into the air next to me as I eat.  I told him he's not sweeping under my table while I'm eating and to go away.  He gave me a look like I should drop dead and went away grumbling something.All-in-all the bagel sandwich was mediocre; the service was bad; noise level was beyond ridiculous and the price was much too high - $8.31 for a toasted bagel with cheese, small bag of chips and a soda?  I mean c'mon - it's Manhattan so you expect to be taken for a little bit of a ride, but this order could have been had from any half-decent deli for under $5.00 with service in 3 minutes flat.  I've got to say that side-by-side with midtown delis I've gotten food from, the Lenny's system blows by comparison.  Other places could have served me and 25 other people in the time it took these amateurs to fill a simple order.The brightest point of the experience is that I was able to get a table right away during lunch; there were several available.  That comes as no surprise once you realize you've paid 75% more for your food than you should have.",,,

Especially in a city where so much of one's business is based on takeout and delivery. And if you are going to do that, then please make sure the orders go out correctly and in the best condition. The last sandwich I got was not only made incorrectly and poorly (missing or sparsely applied seasonings and condiments), but when they said they would send me what I needed to make the order correct it took almost an hour. That's on top of the wait for the initial delivery. Completely missed eating my sandwich during my lunch break, and the person I spoke with at the other end (twice) could have cared less.

Updated review","In update of my review last fall, I must say that this Lenny's has become hit and miss at best in the last while. In fact, in the last month, the only good sandwich I had was a vegetarian I picked up at a work meeting and supplemented with my own smoked ham from Schaller & Webber (because vegetarian and sandwich should not go together and Schaller & Webber is the best!). Anyways, back to the point that the grilled roast beef with roasted peppers and onions was extremely dry and bland, and the previously tasty ""Lenny's Combo"" with Pastrami & corned beef was soaked right through the paper bag with Russian dressing and coleslaw juice! If you happen to go on a good day, they still manage to load a heck of lot of ingredients between the bread and the ingredients are pretty fresh.",1,,

Not expecting 4 starts, and normally would not take the time to review such a minor item, but this time the sandwich was so poor I am doing so as a matter of principal. The tiny sandwich arrived with a few crumbs of bacon and almost no cheese. Clearly these guys are trying to make a few bucks by cheating their customers, and we certainly don't want businesses like that in our neighborhood. Will never order from them again. Thankfully we have EJs which is a little more expensive, but they don't skimp and give honest value for your money. Unbelievable.

Everyone is always very friendly and works very quickly and efficiently.

(ie: giving me the wrong muffin and then they sent a guy to give me another and let me keep the wrong one.)I like how they're trying to be green by asking if you want utensils.

Firstly there is it's not the cleanest of places where the food is purchased and nor where the seats are. I will list the negative aspects to this store in no particular order. A Lenny's worker came to the seating area while many of us are here and literally threw chairs around very aggressively and loudly as if it were 2am and after business hours.  This salad I am eating which is overpriced and plainly it sucks, the ingredients suck. The ""olive oil"" I really don't think is actual olive oil. A mediocre salad with a snippet of grill chicken, wilting wrongly cut onions, 1 dollar raisins, not enough peppers, and not fresh cucumbers. How dare you charge 1 dollar for Craisans, almonds, etc. The floor is dirty in the seating area.The young girls tag teaming the register didn't even speak to me, they took my money  and didn't tell me how much it was going cost either.  Alejandro was polite and spoke English well. He told the girl ""This is a 3.75 salad.""  Meanwhile I was charged 8.75 for it and god do I regret it.  The girls however found it more important to discuss their distress over not being able to buy the right pocketbook.  The one handling the money didn't say one word to me but just gave me the change and the receipt. I was a shocked when I saw her only pull out 11 dollars and change for my WAY under par salad. This place is substandard at best and the salad that I got was second rate. There is no internet either. Did I mention the floors are dirty?I hope your Columbus Ave. Lenny's is better; Bono and Tom Cruise seem to think so. Then again that maybe article from 5 years ago or more.  This place speaks to the poor quality of this whole neighbor hood which is grossly overrated - way over priced supermarkets, restaurants and overall SUB standard quality",,,

It's my go to order in lunch at the pool place. They are quick and the food is usually fresh and made well. However, I recently ordered in lunch to my apartment and was a bit underwhelmed with what I received. I ordered a ""create your own salad"" which is something I like to do. I ordered up all my ingredients and at the end was asked whether I wanted my salad chopped. Now, I am a huge fan of the chopped salad, but what was send to me was mushy, as though the salad was chopped together so much that you could barely distinguish between one ingredient from the other and the dressing had kinda made its way into everything, and turned it soggy. In the future, I will think twice before having my salad chopped at Lenny's. What I do like about Lenny's is the very large sandwich menu full of interesting and different combinations of just about everything sandwich related. One that I find particularly good is the Jimmy T's (chicken cutlet with melted mozzarella cheese, grilled onion, sweet peppers and honey mustard). I also recommend honey turkey with Russian dressing, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. That's a pool lunch favorite. There is a Lenny's on practically every corner, which I find sort of annoying in a strange way. I have no idea whether they are all the same in quality.

But from a business perspective this probably keeps them fresh with the constant business crowd and such. Too many options means everyone gets what they want, but can it all be good? I'll never know...3 stars for good sandwiches at reasonable pricesRevisit? Sure, just not that often",,,
106,matthew h.,"New York, NY",227,210,3,4.0,2/18/2008,"Lenny's, is it great? NO. Is it solid and dependable and a good sandwich? absolutely.great chicken cutlets, grilled roast beef, italian combo etcetcetc.You can do better, sure, but you could also do a hell of a lot worse.I get delivery from them all the time, its fast and yummy enough when the basic sandwich urge hits(tonight i ordered the grilled spicy chicken, but replaced the grilled chicken w/ a cutlet instead... hot and yummy)",3,2,2
107,Lindsay K.,"New York, NY",458,568,7,3.0,6/23/2007,"After walking by Lenny's every day for nearly a year, I decided I was finally in the mood for a sandwich and new Yelp review.There are a bunch of tables outside, and patrons eat happily in the shade accompanied by dogs and friends. Inside, the big to-go counter is lined with friendly sandwich makers who also dole out portions of home-cooked hot entrees. I had a roast beef wrap, which was fresh and tasty, but not really worth $7.50. Paired with a Snapple, $9.10 was just too much for a Saturday lunch. I probably won't be back unless I'm dying for some deli meat and sunlight. Which is like all the time, so nevermind.",3,1,1
108,Matt E.,"Richmond, VA",98,111,2,4.0,8/2/2007,"I love Lennys. It's my saturday afternoon delivery place when i just want to hang out at home and watch the FOX baseball game on TV, along with nursing a hang over.The sandwiches are fairly reasonably priced, (my ham sandwich with bacon costs about $6), and i've never had a bad tasting sandwich either. They have a large number of sides and snacks (chips, veggies, etc) and quite a number of drinks as well to choose from. One thing I DO generally recommend is stay away from the food at the steam table. i've had chicken and turkey from there and it's just not that good. stick with the sandwiches.Delivery is pretty fast.The 4 stars is sandwich only, if i included the steam table, it gets 3.",2,1,1

110,joanne m.,"New York, NY",8,42,4,4.0,8/5/2011,"This place is the place to go for a sandwich/bagel/ breakfast food.  My favorite is the Novie sandwich which is smoked salmon, red onions and cream cheese. =) I get it for lunch, breakfast or dinner.   It's clean and a chain that you can find all over the city.  Eat in or get it on the go.  Had some other sandwiches which I didn't really like, but there's a good sized menu to fit everyone's tastes.",,,
111,Mel J.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,2,1,1.0,2/18/2013,"I've never written a review before, but after receiving the worst customer service I've ever experienced.. I felt compelled to share.  Usually a huge fan of Lenny's, this morning I ordered a sandwich and mochaccino.. Only to receive my drink wrapped in a plastic bag, delivered on it's side, and with half of it's contents floating around freestyle within said bag.  I called simply for a refund but was told that I'd have another delivered instead.  An hour later, and no coffee, I called to check up.  Not only did I have the pleasure of dealing with an undoubtedly rude employee but was, in fact, lying.. According to this gem of a woman, I had never called to begin with.  Why would I make this up?!  Check yourself Lenny, and your phone records for that matter.  In addition to poor packing skills, with that kind of attitude flying around I will definitely be ordering my combo sandwiches and chocolatey caffeinated drinks elsewhere.",1,,
112,Justin R.,"New York, NY",27,22,0,4.0,12/23/2007,"This would be a solid five stars if it weren't so damn expensive.Sandwiches are great, will make you never want to eat at a subway (or equivalent chain) again.  Very quick, clearly using fresh ingredients.  Eating in the shop isn't so much fun, unless it's summer and you can sit on the sidewalk.  Delivery is incredibly fast, delivery-boys seem to want a tip as expensive as the price of the sandwiches here... No dice, buddy!",1,,1
113,Wren R.,"Wheaton, IL",10,42,1,4.0,9/26/2007,"Great place for a quick sandwich.  Very quick too, I even went during lunchtime during the week and still no wait. Lots of people but no wait time to order. They're very efficient, as well as good at what they do.Their tortellini pasta salad is very good.  Actually, now that I think of it, all of the sides that I've tried there have gone way beyond my expectations.  The sandwiches themselves are also pretty tasty and not absurdly priced.  $6.50 for a sandwich piled a mile high with delicious non-sucky ham? Aw hell yeah.In fact, I think I'm gonna get a sandwich from Lenny's tomorrow.",1,,1

115,Megan P.,"New York, NY",27,52,0,3.0,9/14/2008,"Lenny's, Lenny's, Lenny's. Besides messing up my order every 5th time or so, they're pretty good!I haven't been to Lenny's lately to eat in, but I have been getting delivery quite often. I love that they'll deliver coffee (hot or iced!), and as of yet it hasn't spilled or leaked onto my order. Their danishes are delish, salads are fantastic, and sandwiches are pretty good. My friend got food poisoning from one of them - but it was at the beginning of the crazy tomato recall... so really not their fault. Lenny's is a solid choice for work-based lunchtime takeout or delivery. If you order offline you can tell them what time you want it delivered. I've always had it arrive within ten minutes of the stated time - pretty nice!",1,1,
116,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",397,338,3,1.0,10/14/2010,"Well, I usually try not to eat fried garbage, but I was REALLY craving a chicken cutlet sandwich today thanks to someone who mentioned Rocky's deli to me. (Rocky's is a deli in the town that I grew up in- pretty much the best deli in the world) I stopped into Lenny's thinking that a deep-fryer is a deep-fryer no matter where you are. Oiy. Sadly mistaken. There were 3 thin slices of 'chicken' on this sandwich- but it was mostly mushy, oily breadcrumbs with some poor quality meat inside.  Ew. The pickles that came with my $8 (!!!) lunch were bendy and chemically..like the ones that come from a grocery store jar (aka: not worth my time) So, I guess the happy ending of this story is that I only ate half. Nice way to turn what would have been a caloric/fat content splurge into something that I didn't feel particularly guilty about. Next time I'll rent a car and drive up to Rocky's.",1,1,
117,Jean M.,"Manhattan, NY",12,15,0,1.0,9/17/2011,"Worst place to order delivery.  Consistenly gets the order wrong..  Today's dibacle resulted in receiving our food almost TWO hours after we first ordered through seamless.  Lenny's is a great place to have breakfast, lunch and even a light dinner.  Which is why this place is such a disappointment.  I highly recommend ordering from the 68th st & 1st ave location as they are much more organized and both friendly and accommodating.  Unfortunately, they are not on seemless.  Not everything is perfect.",,,
118,Tiffany T.,"New York, NY",32,230,2,3.0,4/12/2009,"So many choices, nothing surprising or unusual.  Reliably fresh ingredients combined as usual.  My fave is the veggie special sandwich (#11, I think).  It's the fall-back sandwich I'd make except I'm too lazy to.  At $6.50, it has mustard and thinly sliced fresh veggies (red cabbage, cucumber, tomato, lettuce, avocado, banana peppers) on 7-grain whole wheat sandwich bread.  If they upgraded the bread to crusty loaves from Sullivan's, Orwasher's, or somewhere similar, I'd be in love with the sandwich.Tried their banana walnut muffin out of curiosity.  Pretty good.  Fluffy crumb, not much of a crust.  Think it would great right out of the oven.  Fair amount of walnuts.",,,
119,Joshua R.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",4,37,0,2.0,5/14/2013,Ordered delivery from the Lenny's yesterday with some of the guys at work and we were not impressed for what we payed for.

120,Kacey K.,"Philadelphia, PA",33,150,1,3.0,9/13/2008,"Oh, Lenny's, I don't know what to make of you.  We have kind of a love-hate relationship I think.  I like the variety of the menu here and the convenience of having a place nearby to grab a quick breakfast or sandwich.  BUT they are so unreliable and unpredictable.  As I unwrap my sandwich, I never really know what I'm going to get.  I have found that their sandwiches do not travel well.  Even if I ask them to toast the bread, it always ends up soggy.  I'd also recommend getting one of the sandwiches on the menu.  Whenever I try to ""make my own"", it does not turn out, even if it's simple.  In any case, I still find myself going back here again and again.  It's like the bad relationship you can't get out of!  You know you should leave, but you just can't.",,,

Well, last week my parents were in town and wanted a quick and cheap lunch in a place you could actually sit down in. I just took them down the block to Lenny's.I'd never been in, so their menu was a little crazy at first (though I've encountered worse), but I was able to pick out one of the specials and it was pretty good. Definitely not the best sandwich I've ever had... and definitely not the cheapest, but it was a good stop for a quick lunch.",,,

132,Livin A.,"Flushing, NY",8,23,0,2.0,7/29/2008,"Whoever gave it a single  ""$"" was out of their mind. For a simple wrap, I spent double than what I would at Subway. Not only that, when I used to work on the UES, they would frequently mix-up orders. I'd have to call them up and they would acknowledge there was a ""mistake."" I shudder when I think that there was a possibility of someone's grubby hands all over my sandwich, gearing themselves for a bite, and later realizing they didn't ask for a spinach wrap, but a hero roll instead. GAH! Look, I understand that in NYC, this is a great value, but if you live in the boroughs, you find yourself scratching your head in dismay that you could have bought a pound of turkey for the price of one mediocre sandwich.I can't believe they don't offer soy milk.  And from what my coworkers told me, stay away from the yogurt parfait.
