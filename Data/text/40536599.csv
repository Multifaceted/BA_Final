The place is clean and  the food is fresh. good choices of hot food, salad, soups, and sandwiches for breakfast or lunch.  Again just with they didn't use plastic containers or else I'd go there more.",,,
1,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25525,2.0,12/1/2017,"This is literally one of the worse delis I've ever had the non-pleasure of working by. Whenever I order a sandwich (which is always just like 3 ingredients) they manage to get something wrong and your sandwich will always be at least $3 more than what is specified on their overhead menu, this is pre-tax mind you.Whenever I've indicated their pricing errors I'm told that prices have gone up and it's silly that I should be expecting to pay the price on their menu. Their hot bar is okay, definitely not the best in the neighborhood and the only reason I've been here 5+ times is because they are literally next door to my office. I'm determined to not give them my money ever again though.",3,,3
2,Dara R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,35,28,4.0,5/18/2018,"Considering every place you go in Times Square serves up expensive breakfasts that are small in serving sizes, this deli - while appearing to be a hole in the wall - has some great menu items and large portions for a decent price. You can get a whole breakfast platter for less than $8, whereas most of those posh places have pre-wrapped and pre-made stuff that do not taste fresh.The cooks at this deli make everything from scratch - whether it's a salad or a sandwich, and they can custom make your dish. DO NOT order from the weigh-in food section - it's waaaay too expensive by the time you finish loading your plastic tray. You're better off ordering a freshly made dish.My favorite items to order custom made are the omelettes - their Greek omelette is pretty good. I've also tried their burgers and fries and these aren't too bad either, considering it's from a small deli in the middle of midtown.Definitely recommend for a quick bite - and their coffee is cheaper than those gourmet spots scattered around every corner.",1,,
3,Fina R.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",62,150,216,3.0,3/21/2017,"Olive Tree is the deli right next to office building in midtown manhattan. They have a hot food bar, a salad bar, a deli and a hot sandwich section. Everything is fresh and made to order. Their cheeseburger deluxe is my favorite thing to order. They give a copious amount of French fries - enough for 2 to share ! No I would not tell someone this is a must try deli - it's no Katz ! But, if you work in the area I definitely recommend Olive Tree for a quick and reasonably priced lunch in midtown !",,,
4,TJ R.,"New York, NY",221,162,791,3.0,8/24/2015,"The look of this place is quite old, but it works. As others have mentioned its fairly reasonable for this area. I was able to get two eggs scrambled with a side of turkey bacon, a few veggies and select items from the hot bar, and a ""small"" ice hazelnut coffee for less than $9. The eggs and turkey bacon were standard fair, which is what I wanted. I don't want complicated platters that are a meal for two. I just need some good ole protein for breakfast. From the hot bar food I picked up some broccoli, a couple of chicken pieces from different dishes, I think a chicken marsala and chicken stir fry and red peppers, just to try. Two pieces of maduros (sweet plantains), which were a bit too sweet, like candy, not horrible but not the best. Also added in the mix were a couple of beet slices from the cold bar. Options galore. Most of what I picked/ate were oily, so I wouldn't say this food is heart healthy. Salad bars are pretty much oxymorons at this point. More hot and oily bars. The ""small"" ice coffee is 16oz for $2.25. For $.50 more it gets larger. No need for me.  The cashier was nice and prepped it the way I like it, very lightly sweetened and black. I came in her between the lunch and breakfast time, I'd say around 11:30am, maybe a little earlier. And there were only a couple of other customers in queue. My order was taken very swiftly, no wait so this worked, and prepared within minutes. The dining area upstairs is large but also old and run down looking. Reminds me of a cab stop type of place. Not meant to be pretty but it works. (See photo). I'd return for the simple and easy breakfast option. Hopefully it's not busy as it's pretty easy going this way. Reminder $5 credit card minimum.",1,,1

Updated review","This place is downstairs from my office so I go here very often, almost everyday for breakfast and sometimes twice a day if I need a quick lunch -- I would say anywhere from 4 to 8 times a week. I think that makes me a solid regular. Just now, I picked up a cold sub from here for lunch. There was literally one person behind me. I started to order my sandwich and the guy muttered something fast but softly. I said, excuse me? And he softly repeated something muffled. I said again, I can't hear you, I can't understand you. He said, please speak quickly when ordering because there is a line behind me. ARE YOU SERIOUS??? First of all, way to be completely counter-productive by having this dialogue with me. And, second, that's just rude. Period. I don't speak slowly by any means, but having this person tell me to talk faster in a way that I could not even hear or understand was extremely frustrating. You don't deserve my business anymore. The owner deserves to know that his employee is rude.",,1,

7,Monique S.,"Brooklyn, NY",253,645,682,2.0,12/2/2014,"I was looking for a healthier option for lunch, so I came by here for the salad bar.  It was a little late, and I was surprised that they even had plenty of food.I saw poeple getting lunch, and the food looked decent. The cold food tasted mushy and unseasoned (brussels spouts, beets, garbanzo bean salad, green salad).  The warm food was hardly, but the chicken tasted good.  The mixed vegetables were as cold as can be.I ended up throwing away most of it, and it's by the wait.  Next time, I'll take my $10 elsewhere.",,1,
8,Diane C.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,2,0,2.0,10/4/2016,A standard in the area for a quick egg and cheese on a roll and a mediocre cup of coffee.  It's dirty and the staff is sometimes rude,,,
9,Jennie E.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",15,7,3,1.0,8/8/2016,"This place is so convenient for me HOWEVER the guys who take the sandwich orders/ bagel orders are SO EXTREMELY RUDE and disgusting. And this is not personal bcuz they did the same thing to the 3 people behind me.  If they dont like their job, they shouldn't be working there. This is the 4th yime i give it a try and the same thing.  I have not yet seen them smile or be courteous. ..sad.   it gets you in a weird state of mind so early in the morning.. 3 thumbs down.  AND I CAN GUARANTEE OTHERS WILL AGREE.",,,

Updated review","First time back in quite a while.  Only three stars this time, and that may be too kind.  There are better salad bars these days. They look about the same as five years ago, just a little  tacky decor.  Upstairs seating area is not attractive.",,,
11,Alicia T.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/3/2015,"Lady at the counter put my coffee on top of my sandwich, as soon as I walked out the coffee spills all over my clothes and phone. I returned and told her what happened, threw it out, didn't apologize, told me that I had to go back in line (which was very long) to order another sandwich with an attitude, and if I didn't want to wait in line to come back later or call for delivery! I ended up getting the manager and he ordered me another sandwich without waiting in line, and because of that lady's customer service I'm giving the deli one star. You have people coming in everyday like myself (2-3 times a week) spending their money, I'll take my money somewhere else. P.S. After reading other reviews, I do agree it's not the cleanest Deli. Take your money somewhere else!",,,
12,Billy S.,"Staten Island, NY",3,68,0,1.0,8/8/2013,This place is a mess.  Really filthy inside.  (as evidenced by their grade of C by the board of health).  You can actually see the crud caked up in the corners of the floor.  Only thing that is worse than the cleanliness of this place is the rude guy who mans the grill in the morning. It's actually funny to watch how angry he gets at customers who are placing pretty standard orders.  The best part is the older Asian guy does not have the spine to school his workers or to take a mop and some soap and water to his shop.Ha what a joke.,5,1,
13,Jim H.,"Chichester, NH",43,93,8,3.0,8/14/2014,"Statement: Solid deli, not so much as a store. Pros: the food is solid, well cooked and has a decent taste. Not to mention a good price. A bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel for $3.25 I would say is extremely reasonable. Cons: limited selection of products outside the deli. This place is a deli and buffet to go so something has to give. It's not the cleanest place in the world and it's a bit cramped but again it's Times Square. Overall:  I have no problem going there for a quick meal it gets the job done",,,
14,Harvey C.,"New York, NY",84,273,2286,3.0,12/14/2011,"Earlier this week I stopped by here twice to rate its essentials...1.  toasted bagel which cream cheese for $1.75:yelp.com/biz_photos/niyk…It was a thin chewy bagel which is good.  However the toasting of said bagel made it inedible as i couldn't help but think i was biting into a lump of charcoal...2,  hot food station box for $6.90:yelp.com/biz_photos/niyk…It included things such as stuffed mushrooms, spicy grilled mushrooms, pasta salad, black olives, tuna salad, chick peas + guacamole, asparagus, et cetera.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as Cafe Duke.Summary:  It's your average Korean deli.  I'd stay away from the bagels....",,,

Updated review",I stop in at lunch time and get a small container of mesculn salad topped with roasted veggies and crispy fried calamari for under $4. Olive Tree is now and will remain my go to spot for a quick workplace lunch.,1,,1
16,David Anthony P.,"Bloomfield, NJ",1,32,61,4.0,5/23/2015,A great place for breakfast or lunch. Prices are very affordable for being in midtown & the servings are huge. A great value for breakfast & the man on the grill makes it the way you ask for. Only drawback is that grill closes at 3:00pm daily. Then you have just the hot & cold salad bar to choose from.,,,
17,Nicole B.,"Brooklyn, NY",225,300,37,3.0,10/15/2012,"I work in the area and like Olive Tree for breakfast because they are fast. However, with that being said...if the grill guy could keep from handing out burnt bacon it would be great!!!",,,

19,Andera B.,"SOUTH RICHMOND HILL, NY",2,64,1,3.0,6/18/2014,I come here when I have NO IDEA what to have for lunch.  I'm able to get a little bits of different things from the salad bar.  They have these cold glass noodle dish in the cold salad bar section which is especially good.  It's a good spot if you need to pick up a meal and run.,,,
20,J J.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/19/2014,"I started working in the area over a month ago, and this deli is one block away from my place of work -- a quick enough jaunt to get my breakfast even when running late.  Despite many complaining about the harsh manner of the one-man show working the grill, I was super impressed by his ability to run the grill while dealing with a huge line.  It was poetry in motion that kept me coming back despite mediocre food, at best.That all changed this past Friday.Friday morning, I got my usual sausage on a toasted roll. (I know, disgusting.  But it's a guilty pleasure that I've indulged in for years.)  By Friday evening, I was not feeling well at all.  By Saturday, I was in the bathroom with the worst case of food poisoning I've ever experienced, accompanied by a nasty fever.  Four days later, and the only foods I can stomach are saltines and applesauce.  If you value your health over cheap breakfast eats, stay far away from this place.  I wouldn't wish this type of food poisoning upon my worst enemy.Steer clear; your body will thank you later.",,,
21,Irene J.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,57,240,2.0,2/10/2012,"Pretty much had to give it two stars even though I dont want to , seeing as I had a long history with this place and my personal experience with this place had been satisfactory. However, negative experiences of two close friends had shattered my loyalty and trust in this deli/salad bar. Ive been going to Olive Tree for more than 4 years before the second friend/ coworker found a insect of sorts in her salad. Right there and then I stopped going to Olive Deli. The first friend (who used to work in the building next to mine) has told me a year or two before this that she stopped going to Olive bcs she found a bug in her soup. That didnt stop me from going however, since nothing bad happened to me. But hearing this type of misfortune from two individuals is more than enough proof I or anyone needs to heed the warning.",1,,1
22,Alan P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,3,0,3.0,9/15/2013,"Love the sandwiches. However, don't try to order a hot sandwich around 2:30 on a Saturday. I was told they couldn't do it due to the obscene amount of bacon on their grills. When asked, I was told the bacon was for the following week.",,1,
23,Dan F.,"Manhattan, NY",187,257,70,2.0,8/31/2009,I made a nice salad from their larger-than-most salad bar but no matter what I got it all tasted like it had a hint of bus fumes.  Honestly I don't know what it was but just like everything had a hint of diesel attached to it.  Place could have been a little cleaner but service was good and selection was better than average.  Fair price for the food but the food was clearly lower quality and I probably won't go here again.,1,,
24,Keenan F.,"Staten Island, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/5/2014,"You are wagering you life if you order from this place- I went to Olive Tree Deli today May 5, 2014 - First off the cook taking orders. is one nasty guy. I am making an order for bacon and eggs on a roll, and I get snapped at like he is doing me a favor-  Now here is the part about your life- He cuts the roll and when he is doing it- Cuts his finger, Blood dripped out- What did he do- He put the egg and bacon on the roll and then cut it in have with the knife that he had cut himself with-- A he did not wash the knife and B there was blood on the roll? I complained and he threw the sandwich and then Yelled at me like it is my fault- I am sorry I don't know where this guy had been- What he has- I think this is a health hazard and he should be fired- and the place shut down!! I saw him take orders after me and still use the same infected knife -  I complained to the owner the Asian guy there and he was to afraid to even say a word or he just did not care- I will never go back and if you value your health If I were you - I would not eat a thing there. I am also making a complaint to the board of health as that is just Dangerous. Be warned eat there at your own risk",,,
