0,Matthew W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,20,0.0,5.0,10/27/2018,A few friends invited me to meet them at this place and I gotta say it's definitely not your typical bar...They serve only authentic absinthe and they only do so in the traditional fashion.  It makes the whole experience feel like stepping back in time.And they even have a built in kitchen where you can order hotdogs and a few other food items.Staff is super friendly and non-condescending and seems happy to explain how things work there.This is a great place if you and few friends want to have a get together.HIGHLY recommended.,,,
1,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,3.0,9/23/2018,"This is one of those hidden gems in NYC that has such a history that you want to love for the character and for what it was, but it's been neglected of some love for awhile making it more of a dive, but is that a bad thing? I actually love dive bars. They serve Absinthe in its original form with the lighting of the sugar, with the water and they actually have an entire set up and the bartender will serve it traditionally to you as it was back in the 1800's. The bar itself is like a shotgun, with the bar on the left, the Feltman's hotdog shop in the first part when you walk in, then the theater and actors and actresses are running about as they prepare for the next show all dressed in period clothes appropriate for that era. It's definitely got some spirits lingering about, as I was in the bathroom alone and felt like someone was with me the entire time... If history is your thing, this is a great place to check out.",1,,
2,Michaile B.,"Chicago, IL",15,10,0,5.0,11/13/2018,"I absolutely love this bar; it gives a type of feeling like nice old wood and books and lovely things of a bygone era. We were able to get a lot of different abinsthe drinks from here, and all were good. On the first night we came here my partner wanted an absinthe drink that required an egg and the bartender was nice enough to run to the corner store and get some. The second night we bought some friends, made some friends and drank some more. Totally unpretentious, non-douchebag type of place. Will definitely revisit the next time we come to NY.",1,,
3,Jess W.,"Honolulu, HI",131,130,107,4.0,3/28/2018,"This place is super dirty and gritty.  I mean, I literally had some sticky substance stuck to my sleeve after I put my elbows on the table.  But it's clearly a dive, so it wasn't unexpected. Lots of history here though, so worth a visit. The bartender was really nice; I think she said she was from Scotland?  And the absinthe was interesting. It was cool to see it being made in the traditional manner, but I didn't really care for absinthe. There's also Feltman's, a little hot dog spot operating out of a tiny room in the bar. Apparently, Nathan of Nathan's Famous stole the recipe from Feltman's. It was a pretty good dog.",1,,
4,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4794,3.0,1/20/2018,"I saw a sign for ""The Best Hot Dog in NYC"" outside so my son & I walked in. Once inside, The William Barnacle Tavern is a dank, dusty place. The bartender said its happy hour! $3 Guinness pints for all. Say again, is that the Queens English?? I'll take a pint and we ordered two dogs, the place is kind of attached to the hot dog booth.While we're drinking, a tour comes in the bar? They all get drinks with their tour pass. The guide is talking about how Al Capone hung here back in the day and there are tunnels down here, right this way?? Um.. This is NYC. You know they don't have little mice but rats the size of small dogs? Tour beware..$3 pints = awesomenessThis place has a weird vibe, It's not McSorleys. But they serve absinthe? If I'm in the area again, I'll have to try a crazy drink. For now? 3 Yelp stars from me.",14,5,9
5,Naomi S.,"Berkeley, CA",421,150,102,1.0,1/14/2018,"Worst bar experience I've had in NYC since living here for four years. I came by with about 6 friends to celebrate my birthday after dinner on a frigid January evening around midnight. A few of us ordered drinks, after which the waitress came to our table and asked if my other friends would like to order something. When they said that they were ok not ordering, the waitress became livid and gave us a lecture about how it was NOT okay, and EVERYONE needed to order something. We were all extremely uncomfortable, especially given that it was single digit degrees outside, the bar had plenty of space, and it was my birthday. When we went to pay, the other bartender was so intoxicated that she forgot to give my bf his credit card back for several minutes, even as he stood at the bar waiting, and we witnessed her take another shot in the meantime. When she finally swiped the card, she was too drunk to use the machine, so my bf had to take the card from her hand and simply leave money on the counter, after which the other bartender ran into the street after us yelling that we hadn't paid. Note to bartenders: drink if you want, but don't ruin your customers' experiences, and do have some compassion for budget-crunched students that seek an escape from the cold and were intrigued enough to visit your bar.",3,,
6,Martha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,47,63,5.0,3/31/2018,"We wanted to try absinthe and this place seemed like the best option that had a variety of absinthes and served them with the flaming sugar cubes. We came one week night at around 7pm. It was empty when we arrived, but was packed by the time we left at around 9-9:30. The bar is pretty small and dark - it used to be a speakeasy during prohibition. A NYC Gangster Tour comes through every so often and it seems the tours include a drink at the bar, so when one comes through the bar fills up quickly. The bartender was very nice and helpful. She showed us the absinthe menu and talked us through which one we would like best based on our other drink preferences. She also explained why the sugar is burned on top of the drink while she prepared them. We had a great time and I recommend it if you're looking to try absinthe or find yourself in the area.",,,
7,Alex V.,"Jersey City, NJ",310,275,502,1.0,12/28/2017,"Came in for what I was hoping would be a quick hot dog, but ended up spending about an hour waiting. Asked the bartender for the original hot dog, but the guy who makes them stepped out, so I had to wait (which is understandable). The bartender asked me to take a seat anywhere I like, so I sat along the wall across from the bar.After waiting patiently for over half an hour, I asked if the hot dog was on its way. The bartender looked at me and said, ""I didn't even realize you were still here,"" without even apologizing or anything. Why wouldn't I still be there? Didn't you ask me to take a seat while I wait?Eventually did get my hot dog, and it was pretty good, but the overall experience of being forgotten was pretty bad. Sadly, I was about to recommend this place to a friend who likes absinthe.The other thing is this place smells like some kind of funky, moldy dog. It's really unpleasant to spend too much time here.",2,,
8,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,3.0,2/17/2018,"This place is only worth coming to if want to enjoy some absinthe.  They have a creative menu of different ways to enjoy absinthe. A group of us came here for a quick since the birthday girl wanted to enjoy some absinthe. The drinks are honestly pretty tasty, and they have a few good drink selections on the menu. The bartender was friendly and explained the process of making the absinthe drinks to customers each time. The place itself looks like a bar out of a horror movie and strangely they have a small hot dog vendor connected to the bar.  Literally you can see the small kitchen where he makes the hot dogs and sells them through a small window on the street.  Only time I would ever come here again is if I was craving an absinthe drink creation or maybe one of their interesting cider drinks.",,,
9,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,256,201,5.0,2/14/2018,"We came to try absinthe. My friend and I had never had it, and for her birthday it was something we decided we wanted to do together. So, searching for places on yelp that serve it, this one popped up really quickly. Plus, the fact that this was a speakeasy seemed really cool. We arrived pretty early and got a seat at the bar. It's definitely a neighborhood-standby-feel type of place. The bartender and other patrons were friendly, and the bartender explained the absinthe process to us and helped us chose what to try. It's definitely a unique experience, and if you're new to it like we were, I think it's pretty great for a first time. I also got the hot buttered cider here- and it was darn tasty. This place is a bit off the beaten path for subway riders, but well worth the trek for the experience.",,,
10,Aleigh B.,"New York, NY",2,55,48,5.0,6/22/2018,"We ended here after the Gangster Museum guided tour.  Our bartender was really nice/friendly and she made our 2 Absinthe drinks in the traditional way (sugar cube, fire, and ice water).  It was fun to watch!",,,
11,Remi C.,"Huntington Station, NY",495,490,106,2.0,8/13/2017,"***UPDATE***Jody, one of the other bartenders was fabulous. After sharing how disappointing the service was (1 star, see below), she tried to ameliorate the situation. Major brownie points for that. ---I LOVE ABSINTHE. Feel free to see my reviews about the absinthe lounge in sydney....where i, and my family went...5 times in 3 weeks?Look, read my reviews. I can forgive bad product if there's good service, or bad service if there's good product, but Gina (maybe her name, maybe a pseudonym, because she was awful) provided neither of those. I can forgive poor absinthe preparation (lighting a sugar cube on fire), I can even forgive not telling us about the glorious history of absinthe due to the loud (poor) comedy going on in the background (but great music)...and it's not an absinthe bar, but a dive bar that happens to have a good selection of absinthe given the nature of the bar. BUT, I won't forgive being harassed by an elderly employee who either knows nothing about the drink their serving (then ask somebody else to serve us), or is being willfully obtuse and refuses to converse with the patron. Absinthe isn't your standard drink, and at the bare minimum, you need to explain why (and if) you add sugar, why (why you never should) light a sugar cube on fire, and why (and if) you add water. EVEN, if you neglect all of these, you better damn well engage with somebody who may know better or have a preference for their own preparation. This place offers none of that. I have never been so angry, or poorly treated, at any establishment. Especially when I'm ordering my favourite beverage with my favourite humans. I will never come back here. NEVER come here for absinthe. If you want a dive bar with mediocre comedy, an interesting history, mediocre booze, and some decent music....there are better places with better customer service to go to. NOT RECOMMENDED.",3,,1
12,Allison M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",172,486,1,4.0,5/22/2018,Came here for a pre-dinner drink.  I had never had absinthe but figured why not.  The menu and the red-headed bartender (forget her name) were both very descriptive and she was able to lead me to an entry-level absinthe.  It was great!,4,2,5
13,Eduardo A.,"Queens, NY",37,40,17,4.0,3/18/2018,"The interior needs some work. Its history, location and specialty open up a lot of possiblities. That said, the bartenders were super helpful and patient breaking down the options and attentive to the taste I was looking go against. Definitely a good place to chill with one or a group (if you fit). Looking forward to returning to try other drinks.",,,
14,christine a.,"New York, NY",91,205,83,5.0,8/25/2017,"Friendly with no attitude, this is an old speakeasy and real NYC bar. The ambience is one of a kind. The bartendress was so nice, she told us the fascinating history of the bar and how it's changed over the years. Great Guinness happy hour specials, good hot dogs, Absinth, full bar. This is a real New York place.",,,
15,Billy M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",223,99,54,5.0,12/12/2017,"A fantastic little hole in the wall. Stumbled past this place while out for a date, and we saw the signs for absinthe outside. I'd tried it before, by my fiance hadn't, so we went inside to be greeted by the extremely pleasant and knowledgeable bartender, Pete. He walked us through the absinthe menu, explaining the process in depth from pour to finish. Solid prices for absinthe, you're definitely getting a good deal. Be aware though, if you're a loud talker like me, the bar is attached to a theater, so you may be asked to keep your voice down. All in all, a wonderful spot to grab a drink with friends or a date!",1,,1
16,Luis A.,"Watsonville, CA",49,36,22,5.0,3/18/2018,Come check out this old historic bar where Al Capone once hung out regularly plus a historic theater next door and an underground storage area for bootleg liquor during Prohibition! A place to come have a drink at a historic bar! I'm not big on the they're classic absinthe drinks but try a whisky or rye (Old Fashion) and just imagine what it was like in the 1920s!,,,
17,Caitlin K.,"New York, NY",39,97,1,4.0,8/4/2017,"We stopped in because we had been visiting the Museum of the American Gangster a few weeks back, heard about this historical bar, and wanted to check it out!Of course, we had to try the absinthe. The bartender was great at figuring out which one would be best for us to try, and even suggested we split it (which turned out to be a great suggestion!). It was prepared traditionally - first the absinthe goes in the glass, then a sugar cube is placed on the absinthe spoon resting on top of the glass, it's lit, and then the water drips over it. With the first few sips, I really enjoyed it! I grew to not love it by the end of the glass. My SO really enjoyed it though!If you come for any other drinks, they have great HH specials as well. A fun little find :)",,,
18,Erica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,19,3,5.0,1/5/2018,"My favorite bar in N.Y.! After mars bar closed there was a hole in my heart but William Barnacle Tavern has filled that void! Came here for new years, which was also mine and my boyfriend's one year anniversary, and had a wonderful time. Lorcan and Genie are lovely people and they made us feel right at home. Lorcan spent a good part of the evening explaining the vivid, fascinating history of the bar and showing us around. Gorgeous decor, strong, tasty, reasonably priced drinks, wonderful ambiance, interesting regulars, and an overall comfortable environment. I highly recommend this bar and will definitely be back. Do yourself a favor and check it out.",1,,
19,J. J.,"Houston, TX",313,23,1,4.0,4/24/2018,Dive bar with an interesting history and a solid selection of absinthe. Jody the bartender is extremely knowledgeable and helped me select an absinthe I liked a great deal (the Redux).,1,,1
20,Ariel S.,"New York, NY",394,107,57,5.0,9/25/2017,"I found this place in 2014 and have been coming ever since--whenever I'm in St. Marks. Two things draw me here evermore:1. The bartenders - not all bartenders are made equal and thats ok. NYC is notorious for having some of the rudest bartenders (which is not surprising given how rude New Yorkers can be in return). This place--of almost all the bars I've frequented--consistently has the friendliest, open, and efficient bartenders. That alone is worth the visit.2. Absinthe - Do I need to say more? If you like licorice you'll probably like absinthe and this place hosts an enormous collection at a decent price. And they serve it the right way--with an ice water decanter and atop a sugar cube thats gets ignited. Its an experience that everyone should have!Besides the service and drinks the place is a cool historical find. I think it used to be owned by the mafia at some point (i.e. speakeasy) and it has its own theater in the back of the bar. The place holds true to its nautical name complete with a giant ship replica, wood everywhere, and antiquated silents films playing in the background. Truly a spectacular and classic find in St. Marks and a departure from the ""trendy"" and ever-changing LES",2,1,1
21,Sara M.,"New York, NY",128,39,14,5.0,12/3/2017,"This bar is amazing and I'm not even a big fan of absinthe! This place has the best bartenders I've come across in the city- all are very knowledgeable and willing to walk those of us who don't know a lot about absinthe through the menu. I really wish I could remember our bartender's name so give him a shoutout here. My friends and I got the least licorice-y absinthe, which we wouldn't have known to get without the bartender's help. If you're looking for the traditional absinthe experience with the water dripping over the sugar cube in a former speakeasy with fantastic bartenders, this is the place to go. Ps. When I went, they had a Trump special which is hilarious: a shot of vladimir vodka and a cheap beer.",,,
22,Bert O.,"Highlands, NJ",0,9,8,5.0,4/8/2018,Friendly bartenders and a great historic vibe. Awesome place for a quiet drink with a friend. Haven't taken the tour yet but I will be back!,,,
23,Nick M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",32,33,3,5.0,3/13/2018,"I discovered this place during a Museum of American Gangster tour. (FYI, the Tavern located right beneath the Museum). The chief (Brooklyn native) promised to serve one of the the best hot dogs in the City (Coney Island style hot dog). And yes, that was delicious. I tried both Original one and ""Al Capone"" with vodka sauce. I used to work in tourism industry  and many visitors kept asking me about where they could try ""real American hot dog"". To my shame, at the time I did not know the answer; the best advice I could give is NOT to consider whatever those guys  from Bangladesh sell in food carts in Midtown as ""real American hot dog"" ;) Now I know: If you are looking to try original and delicious hot dog - William Barnacle Tavern is a must!",,,
24,Matt L.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,77,33,5.0,10/25/2016,"Are you an Absinthe snob and have a hard time finding a bar that serves it properly? You will love this place!Excellent selection of premium absinthes served correctly. Prices range from $17-$25 a serving, but the bartenders are generous with the pour and don't use jiggers.After torching the absinthe soaked sugar cube, ice cold water is slowly dripped over, promoting an ideal louche.Great vibes, friendly and well-executed bar service, and a cool location...this bar is a no brainer.",1,,1

This was definitely an awesome place to learn about some absinthe. The bartender had great knowledge about it, especially for my fiancé and I, as we're just starting to learn more about it. She helped us pick out good ones. I got Butterfly and fiancé got Vieux Carre. Both were traditionally prepared, and was pretty cool to watch. She told us more about the Butterfly and the history behind it.Besides the drinks, it was cool to be at a place with great history behind it. The Museum of American Gangster, as well as Theater 80 are home to this very spot. It was a great and different experience that I would gladly come back for.",,,

Supposedly Frank Sinatra was once a bartender here!,1,1,1
30,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1044,25538,3.0,5/14/2013,"I hopped in here last Saturday to get out of the downpour as I waited for friends to arrive as we gathered for a close friend's 27th birthday. I was greeted by the bartender about 5-6 minutes of awkwardly standing by the bar/entrance and not knowing much as there's no menu posted anywhere - thankfully they had a chalkboard sign out front which advertised $5 Guinness drafts and that was the route I ended up taking. After pulling up a chair to the bar (no high chair/stools by the bar - instead they face the wall thus giving your back to the bar, I found this weird but I was told I could move them to the bar so I did so for me and my friend who was nearby and heading over to meet me) the bartender let me try a Smithwick's. I've had it before, but it had been awhile and I find that it tastes different sometimes depending on the bar - it was good hear, smooth and crisp as it should be.This is an awesome Irish Whiskey/Absinthe bar with a rich speakeasy history. They play soft Gaelic ballads and only carry Irish beers on tap - luckily for me I enjoy Guinness, Smithwicks and Irish brews in general. They have an interesting crepe menu too - only $5 for a buttery sugar crepe and an $1 for whatever topping/filling you you'd like. Options include: banana's, salted caramel, NUTELLA, chocolate syrup drizzle, I think blueberries and/or strawberries and more.I unfortunately did not get to order one, but I saw some of the ones brought out for other patrons and they looked (and smelled!) amazing so this is definitely on my bucket list of things to try. Beer and crepes aside, they also had a really pretty silver absinthe fountain. It was unlike any type of alcoholic fountain I had ever seen - I'm not usually a huge absinthe fan but this is now also on my bucket list of things to try here.Their location is also pretty condusive to good times being close to many other bars and restaurants, I'm sure I'll be back sometime.",3,,
31,Ange Q.,"West Babylon, NY",5,15,56,5.0,5/18/2016,"A fun place to drink with friends. Specifically came with a friend to try the absinthe, which we both took the top two suggestions from the bartender (who was particularly nice since we were already a little loud and tipsy). I had St. George while my friend had Mephisto. Mine was more gold than green, the licorice flavor was almost absent, but it was an enjoyable experience. My friend's had just a gentle licorice after taste (which I usually hate) that was faint and pleasant on the tongue as it lingered and dissipated. The atmosphere is great for drunken conversation with friends and a band happened to be playing traditional Irish music, which was great since my friend from Ireland was with us and he happened to make a friend who was from Ireland as well",1,,

33,Karen R.,"East Northport, NY",272,332,1007,5.0,7/27/2014,"I've been kind of obsessed with trying Absinthe & came upon this place. Its a unique bar, apparently it has quite a history. It was dark & quiet inside, not too big. The bartender, I didnt get his name was very knowledgable and didnt mind all my questions. We tried 3 different kinds an authentic French type (green from the herbs) an American which was like the Swiss type (clear) and an aged one (golden in color). They were each different. I liked the French best. They put the sugar cube on the spoon and drip the water from a fountain. The liquid turns opaque when the water is added. Its strong, a good sipping drink, tastes like anise. It was a really  different way to spend some time at a bar, I really enjoyed it.",3,2,2

(I believe my cocktail was $12, but things were getting fuzzy at that point). I highly recommend the Mad Hatter cocktail!There are a variety of crepes you can order. They're not fantastic, but you're not coming to this place for food. However, if you're looking for something to much on, they hit the spot. There are also dessert crepes, which are always a good idea.The place is tiny, so only come with a friend or two.

And it has a HUGE absinthe list.The bartender told me that Sinatra had one of his first gigs there and that it used to be a speakeasy with a horseshoe bar. I was drunk, so some of those facts may or may not be facts. Either way, as a bar it is a place to leave the East Village and enjoy another time. Inside seems like little has changed in the last 40 years. But who knows? I like the vibe. It's pretty calm. The absinthe drip always seems to be on (20+ absinthes). And anyone that enjoys absinthe is A-OK! They also have 4 taps with very standard things. Brooklyn Lager, Strongbow Cider, Guiness, etc. Then another list of other hard alcohols.I hope to come back to explore the place more.

The bartender really knows his absinthe and he would help you if you have any questions about what kind of absinthe you should drink. It's was my first time having absinthe, and this drink is the definition of a black jellybean lol. I'm not a fan of black licorice, but after a while, you get used to the taste. I saw great comments about the crepes here so I decided to get one. I got the crepe Suzette (not on the menu but the chef will tell you about it if you ask). Delicious!

I must say it was a very uniqueexperience. This place holds a lot of history and the bartenders are well informed about it. Its joined to a theatre so has a very old theatre feel to it. There are no stools to go with the bar counter, which I found a bit different but perhaps all old school taverns are built that way. However, there were plenty of other seatings in the front and on the side walls that we could grab. The place was extremely quiet.  For a while it was just two of us and the bar tender. They also project the theatre performances on one of the walls, you feel continuously entertained. I had never had absinthe before, so I had no clue what to expect when I saw their menu. I decided to play safe and go for Hot Cider with Rum. It was the perfect drink for that chilly day. Also, loved how it was served in a coffee mug. But, who knew absinthe would taste 10 times better than rum? I did not want to give back my friend's drink once I had a taste of it. It just had so much flavor and feel to it. If I did not have a dinner reservation, I would have surely stayed longer and ordered another round of cider with absinthe. Perfect reason to visit again.",3,,

43,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",252,505,1,4.0,2/5/2014,"You have to take the good with the bad at this place.  The good is that you have these cute older women making all the drinks and you know that cider was made with a heavy dose of tender, love and care.  That said, you may have to wait a little bit for that drink as things aren't exactly ""fast-paced"" around here.  The crepes made in house by this charming french guy only makes this place even more unique.  Pair that with the fact that you are connected to a theatre (The Bayside Musical is a MUST see), and you have the William Barnacle Tavern.  I would say it is worth at least stopping in for a drink if you are in the neighborhood.  Bottom line: If you go, look around and, for a second, remember back to when NYC wasn't full of faux charm and starbucks.",1,,1
44,Sharon R.,"Washington, DC",196,315,485,5.0,1/21/2013,"As soon as we walked in my friend said ""This feels like we left New York"" which is funny since later on while I was checking other yelp reviews it's exactly what someone else said. The place was pretty desolated especially for a weekend night, I think there was one or maybe 2 other tables besides us. My boyfriend swears it had maritime decor but I can't really remember. Either way, it's a pretty strange place ran by a couple. They play Irish music and the husband plays along with his flute/pipe every once in a while. I wonder if they are the only two employees because the wife, who came to serve us, looked REALLY sleepy... I can't really rate the absinthe itself, so I'm really rating on the experience. One of the most interesting parts was taking a history tour around the establishment which includes tunnels down under. History includes speakeasy, mafia conspiracy and remains of a dutch house.  The husband is even coming out with a book detailing all of the evidence that they have uncovered from previous owners...I won't ruin the story for you...if you are around just ask, he'll gladly tell :)",5,1,1

A few minutes later, a French man brought up a crepe, explaining that this is the first weekend he's made crepes for customers, and wanted us to sample the goods. So we did, and it was delish!  All in all, a really interesting space, nice barman and crepe chef, and reasonably priced pours. I'll be back!",2,1,1

I was waiting for Bill the Butcher to enter draped in an American flag and pluck out my eye. The owner is very engaging and is more than happy to divulge the fabled history of the building, from the shady political dealings to the days of prohibition when it operated as a speakeasy (Finally! Someone with whom I can share my needlessly vast knowledge of crime and punishment in the early 20th century!).The absinthe is what often draws people to the location. The preparation is an experience in itself as he explained to us the many kinds and method of serving it.How did I watch an entire documentary about absinthe and nothing was mentioned about licorice? It tastes exactly like licorice. I hate licorice. Disappointment aside, I still enjoyed the place. I did not know there was an adjacent museum he offers tours of which I will have to check out. Also there is a performing arts theatre that shares the space next to the bar area. If you are looking for a less than ordinary place to hang out and speak with colorful folks then this is your stop.",1,3,

Unfortunately, when piling out of the subway it started drizzling and then it turned into a full on flash flood, monsoon type of rain and I started panicking not knowing where we were all meeting. But another friend was sitting cozily up in this bar waiting for other arrivals. In a glorious tirade and huffing I fling myself through the doors and instantly flip over backwards onto my bottom. Literally every patron in the bar lunged forward to help me up. It was humiliating but also very kind of the entire bar. And also everyone literally there was Irish. Cheers. The beer selection, though medium pricey was a decent selection. I do love Smithwicks on tap. Most things were $5 or $6 and not sure if they have a happy hour or not on week days. But it was a relief from the rain and the lady behind the bar was super nice. They had an interesting sounding crepe menu that I may have to come back for some day. And an ornate basin of what they say is filled with absinthe near the door. The bar is fairly old fashioned. It may even be a historical building. Though, I didn't get to explore enough I was only in for a pint. But a lovely little place I had no idea existed.",1,,1

And the Frenchman making crepes is a genius.  I was the only person in the bar and I immediately called two friends to meet me because I needed to share the experience. I learned about absinthe, I learned about history, I fell in love. It was like the first time I read Hemingway. So detailed, so beautiful. The history of this building is in the air. I immediately recommended it to all my friends who are dating or are online dating scavengers. There are two types of absinthe. One follows the holy trinity and the other is a fuckin renegade. Both are great. Check out that ice dripper used to melt the caramelized sugar cube. Could it be used as Chinese torture? Hell yes. Could it be used in my S&M room. It already is.",2,3,3

59,Matt M.,"Nashville, TN",25,57,23,4.0,3/14/2013,"What a great surprise this place was during a recent NYC trip. After doing some research on speakeasies in the city, and thanks to the help of other Yelpers, we found this place and decided to give it a try on a late Tuesday evening. That particular night was (I think) an open mic night, so there was some decent music filling the air. There is a great history with this place. If the names Lucky Luciano or Al Capone interest you, then this is a must-see. Should you find the owner, Mr. Otway (who was dressed in a full three-piece suit the night of our visit), he will be more than happy to share the long and varied history of this establishment, which sits on the former site of a Dutch farmhouse. As for the tavern itself, it's old, cramped and dark--some of the best elements that make up the greatest dive bars. They offer absinthe, and while the taste of that particular spirit is of no interest to me, it's mesmerizing to watch the water drip that creates the cocktail. Unfortunately, we made the mistake of ordering a couple of whiskey sours where I think they forgot the whiskey. Definitely stick with the absinthe or beer if you're going to partake.So why the 4-star review if the drinks sucked? Well, the couple with us enjoyed their drinks, so I'm giving them a pass since I didn't order the specialty. The service was great, along with the ambiance, but the real reason for 4-stars is the lively history Mr. Otway's anecdotes lend to this establishment. That encounter alone was one of the most memorable experiences during this latest NYC trip. My only regret is that we didn't have time to return and have our attention captured, yet again, by Mr. Otway's tales of the William Barnacle Tavern.",2,,2
60,Maggie H.,"Savannah, GA",115,362,82,3.0,1/12/2015,"This is a weird little place.  We stopped in for after dinner drinks before seeing a show next door.  I had read the reviews of the crepes & had planned on ordering one for dessert, however, the smell of the crepes being prepared was so strong and off putting I opted to skip them.  It had a burnt smell to it, nothing enticing about it at all.  The smell actually kind of put a damper on our whole experience.   I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was underwhelmed.  I asked for a cocktail menu so I could look over the absinthe offerings I had heard so much about but there were no menus, which was no biggie, but the bartender offered little guidance on what was available.  I figured if you're famous for being an absinthe bar, you would at least mention that you serve it.  We ended up trying the absinthe, which, as someone else mentioned tasted like licorice. It also made me insanely thirsty.  I felt like a camel for the rest of the night and could not get enough water.  Basically, I didn't care for the only things that make this place unique, so I have no reason to come back again.",2,,1

They are so nice, and always willing to share the story of their prohibition-era building. One time, the owner even gave myself and some friends a casual tour around, explaining the history of the building to us. As if that isn't enough, they have a variety of absinthe (which you can watch being prepared traditionally!) and other drinks, coupled with a soundtrack of Irish music. I believe they also have many events throughout the year, such as film screenings in their theater, Irish music/dance performances, and themed parties.  Definitely a favorite of mine, a real treasure through and through.

The man is a genius who makes these crepes and he really does know his food and its quality. Usually crepes are too sweet and overpacked with nutella and fruits that just gets messy, but here you get them on plates and the crepes are fried. I have never had them before, and I got the sweet crepe of strawberries with caramel and whipped cream. It was AMAZING! I tried some of my friend's savory crepe with egg and some other things. I loved it as well. I would seriously go back here just for the crepes. I tried my first legit absinthe here, and it was just so cool how they did everything. We got the first three on the list, and I realized that I don't actually like absinthe. If you're trying it for the first time and want to go with some a bit milder, I would recommend choosing the one with the vanilla tones.",,,
63,Abby S.,"New York, NY",282,227,1,5.0,6/3/2012,"My speakeasy adventure led me to this very eccentric and intriguing place in the East Village. We were looking for a bar that wasnt so packed and decided to step into this place not knowing that we would be stepping into prohibition circa 1920s. Inside, you will find a lovely honest to goodness Irish couple. They run the joint. Authentic Irish music fills the air and the interior is a little art deco-ish. Grab a seat at the bar so you can talk to the man of the house, Lorcan. He will engulf you with stories of his family and the history of the bar and what happened during prohibition in this exact place. They have an amazing selection of whiskey here ranging from 10 dollars to 90 dollars. He is very knowledgeable with his whiskey as you can expect from an Irishman which delighted my date who was Irish as well and we ended up trying their best whiskey in the house. It was truly amazing. The top shelf one he served us had a delectable aftertaste, very woodsy. It had hints of oak and even almost charcoal-like in the back of the throat. The average whiskey even tasted fantastic as well. But Lorcan had a surprise for me. He concocted an absinthe cocktail that he discovered the recipe from one of the old artifacts he found in the speakeasy, I believe it was stuffed in an old beer bottle. Delicious and very exciting to be sipping an almost extinct drink!We then found out that there is an old theatre inside this bar as well as a prohibition museum! What a surprise! Lorcan proceeded to give us hard hats and took us on a tour of the building. We saw the theatre and then we went downstairs where he showed us the original door of the speakeasy and the hidden tunnels they used to hide in! It was fascinating for sure. There were old artifacts everywhere, even extremely old beer bottles. Truly amazing treasures from that time. He showed us that the building still run on the old school air conditioning system where it pumps the water that creates the cold air. This place is really legit! This is not your typical Irish bar for sure. It is serene and almost eerie. If you want truly great whiskey and great company come to William Barnacle. But sssssshhhhhhh.... You didn't hear that from me. This place still hold that secrecy and mystery. It is one of those places that makes you feel like you are in the know if you go here. If you want an interesting time, and good place to go on a date that is quiet and intimate, come here. It was by far the most intriguing and one of the best dates I have had. And Lorcan.. He is definitely the man!",4,2,4

The absinthe is pricey but worth the experience. The other drinks are also very well made, such as the sour drinks as well as the warm cider. The Creperie inside is amazing and I am writing a separate review for them as well but try EVERYTHING. We had the egg cheese and onion crepe along with the caramel and whipped cream crepe all of which were stupendously good. I dont know why more people dont know about this place and it is definitely a place I'm adding to my local spots that tourists dont frequent.

The owners are brilliant, beautiful souls. In the colder months they have hot cider that you can drink with rum or whiskey! Their absinthe knowledge and selection is fantastic, and if you've never experienced absinthe before, they will guide you through the subtle and not-so-subtle differences with expert explanations.

If you are Irish, or a lover of Irish music and culture, you will feel very at home and even nostalgic for a home you may have never even known in this lifetime. When I step into the Absinthe Bar (as my friends call it in short-hand) I feel as if I am dipped into a dream of every bar I had ever dreamed of in the best of books and most elusive of songs. Go here and linger, stay for a couple of hours and exchange stories with old friends & new. If you're lucky, The owner will announce an impromptu tour and you will learn the deep and fascinating history of the building. I found this place by pure chance and fate one rainy night when I had only been living here for a matter of months. You will be lead to this place by destiny, drink it in, breathe in the richness of the twilight, and let yourself be transported into a true New York dream.",,,
89,E. V.,"New York, NY",0,17,0,5.0,1/1/2012,Words cannot describe this place. You come (despite the unfortunate signage) for the absinthe and stay for the stories. By the end of the night the owner was playing his whistle along with the music. I heard tales of the old building from prohibition. I drank 12 year Jameson. I was offered a hard hat and a tour of the basement. Amazing.,4,,1

91,Sarah H.,"New York, NY",242,238,225,5.0,2/17/2013,"!!! I just get so excited about this place! the inside is very interesting meaning there is so much to look at and admire such as antique items and blah blah you know. lol anyway, the people who work here are super friendly from the two times I went and you have just GOT to get some absinthe because they light the sugar cube on fire and it makes an aWESOME photo since the flame glows different colors. I know, it's the little things that matter most. Anytime I am in this area i have just got to stop in and get my absinthe on. I can't wait until the weather warms up so I can do that and then walk around the parks in NYC, that sounds lovely!",,,
92,Daniel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,35,3,4.0,9/16/2012,"This place is a bit strange.  As my friend said, ""I feel like we left New York.""  Run by whom I believe to be the original owner's son and his wife, this throw-back reflects what life must have been like in 1920's gangster-run East Village.",,,
