1,Ali E.,"Boston, MA",428,8,5,1.0,9/22/2018,Sophie's completely discriminated against my friend. The bouncer denied her entry despite her having a valid form of ID and made our party feel extremely patronized. I would not recommend this bar to anyone. We will not be coming back.,4,,
2,Caroline G.,"Purchase, NY",1,1,0,1.0,9/22/2018,"Would give zero stars if possible. We were let into the bar at 10PM Saturday night (9/22). As soon as we were let in, one woman from our party was dragged out physically by the bouncer. He claimed she was underage though she had a legal ID and is several years over the legal limit. We asked him to scan the ID to prove validity - he refused. He refused as well to make any eye contact with us, tell us his name, or answer any of our questions. He raised his voice at us when he became agitated that we asked him to get a scanner. We were completely sober getting to the bar, and explained how offended and perturbed we were at his blatant sexism and infantilism of women. He refused to acknowledge us, refused to get a manager, refused to listen. If the manager of this bar is reading this review, please look into the behavior of this bouncer.",4,,

A member of our party was dragged out of the bar when the manager claimed she had a fake ID (it wasn't), and refused to scan it when we informed him it was legitimate and that she was a few years over the age limit, which is both discriminatory and illegal.

Drinks were cheapish, but not dirt cheap. I love a good dive bar, don't get me wrong, but it needs to have that little bit of something that makes it  more than just a bar.

A few middle-aged men drinking PBR, Duck Dynasty on the CRT TV, a jukebox and billiards in the back. Chyeah, it's a dive bar. Bourdain mentioned this is one of the last  real dive bars in all of Manhattan, and there has to be a bit of credit in that department. It was a little awkward the first time I came here, as we got quite a bit of stares, but afterwards I felt pretty comfortable once we struck up some conversation.Lots of worn decor and upholstery will tell you that Sophie's been through a few rodeos, but that's part of the charm. Not saying that pretentiously, I really actually think that it does show a bit of character. That being said, you should beware of incredibly dirty seats and walls. Heh.Bartenders are generally friendly, drinks are cheap, and it's rarely ever crowded like Doc Holliday's. Sometimes that's all you need in a bar.

I met a few people that don't go there often but spent three hours of my night talking to a delightful regular. I ended up staying until close hanging out with strangers and honestly felt just as at home as I do at many of the local bars back home. Great atmosphere, friendly people, decent prices...

The other ladies tending bar were amiable and quick and the drinks are cheap and good and the jukebox is decent and the decor is cool.  It was really loud and the crowd at 11pm was getting douchey but I know to manage my expectations of such things when in the lower half of Manhattan on a Friday night.)So, my friends and I were sitting on the bench to the right of the bar, where the staff can enter and exit.  The bartender in question (she may have been a barback) came out through the swinging doors to take a bucket of trash out, and in her haste dropped a huge wad of cash onto the floor.  I picked it up and placed it on the bar.  When she came back in we pointed out that she had dropped it.  She stopped and literally sneered at us, grabbed the cash, and went back behind the bar.I have a lot of respect and empathy for people in the service industry.  You have to deal with dickbags on the regular.  I get that you probably have had a day chock full of dickbags, and you just want to get the hell out of there.  I also get that this is New York, and there's a higher percentage of dickbaggery here.  But holy shit.  I just rescued the entirety of your tips from your shift, and you can't even say thanks?On her next trip out my friend was crouching in front of the swinging doors, putting her wallet in her bag.  In an already crammed bar, she barked at her to get out of the way, and when my friend took more than a nanosecond fumbling with her bag she got more aggressive.  My husband said, ""Hey give her a sec, she's just getting her bag.""  Her: (glare)Him: ""Oh and you're welcome for your cash we saved for you by the way.""(pregnant pause)Her: ""You're a dick.""Wow.  No, my friend.  You are.",6,1,

We are sitting in front of empty seats and the bartender, a disgusting woman (if she can be called that) in her late 30s refuses us service because ""people are already sitting there"". Like what? How is that relevant? We aren't even sitting down we are just ordering drinks. I momentarily forget about the drink and go say hi to some more friends and probably another 10 minutes goes by when I try to get a drink again. The bartender asks for my ID before even asking for my order, goes to the opposite side of the bar, scans it LITERALLY 40 times (my ID is undoubtedly real), comes back after 2 minutes and simply says ""I don't like your attitude"" and refuses to take my order. Really? I don't like your false sense of superiority from being a bartender at a shitty East Village diver bar.Well, she got what she wanted when the group of 10 people I was with left.

Understanding that they had a certain standard, I offered to abide by their rules, take it off and wear what I had underneath in, a very nice looking blue silk shirt and black pants in. The owner unfortunately had already decided that I was a bad person, because he was disgusted at the fact that I had shown up in a Santa suit and refused to let me in even when dressed appropriately and had taken all the Santa gear off. They even refused to let me talk to my friends who were already inside. This is the most extreme overreaction to a Santa suit I have ever seen. I understand that you want to keep out rowdy college kids but I am not one of those and I don't appreciate you randomly refusing me service. And I am really mad that I could not even takeit off to go in and talk to my friends. I have never felt so abused. I literally just wanted to sit and have a beer quietly.

I went on a Wednesday night with about 9 others and we crowded ourselves around a small table quite happily. We were there for a while, but it was about 3 degrees outside so we didn't feel like bar hopping. All of us ordered at least one drink during our stay and most ordered two or three. The drinks were really well priced, 4 dollars for a pint. But the bartender working was incredibly rude and unfriendly. She ignored us for a while when we first got there and when we did pay a friend of mine gave me the quarters he got from change so I had exact change for my drink. She took my money, give me a sneer and snapped, ""You guys know I make my living off tips, right."" I was shocked. That is a completely inappropriate manner in which to conduct yourself at your place of work. Of course we were going to tip her but after that I really didn't want to. I begrudgingly tipped her anyways and we went on with our night. I'd say we were there for about 2 and a half hours, casually drinking our beers and hanging around with friends arriving and leaving. The bar filled up slightly by 12 but nothing busy and most people were down by the pool table. At 12:45 this same bartender came over to out table and in a patronizing manner told us that it was time for us to leave. We figured that it was closing time or something but no she had decided that we had to leave the bar because we'd been there for too long without ordering enough drinks and they needed the table for paying customers. Now I could understand on a busy Friday night if you need a larger table for the influx of people. But this place was barely half full and if it were obvious that our table was needed we certainly would've noticed. She glared at us until we all got up and left and while we were standing outside saying goodnight to each other I noticed her standing behind the bar sneering and gesturing in our direction, clearly telling this story to other patrons. I can tell you now that I will not be going back to that bar, despite the prices. I do not appreciate being spoken down to and certainly not being treated poorly. I understand that being a bartender for your career can be rough if it is not where you want to be, but that is a completely unacceptable way to treat your partrons.",4,,

I took a full nose dive and was dragged for blocks and blocks past townhouses and public schools straight to Avenue A and 5th where I sought refuge at Sophie's for a beer and a shot.....my nose covered in gravel and a strange white powder.  Inside the bar, I'm mixing old with new as I check in to foursquare and simultaneously order a beer and a shot of whiskey with a name only the regulars of forty years know.......that sun bleached liter of rye with a German name and layers of dust.  Mick Jagger and Iggy Pop sing in succession across the over there juke box and I settle in to my long summer's nap....resting the frosty pint of suds against my beard stubble and hoot and holler along to the nearby groups of friends who make inside jokes that I only laugh to from the comfort of my barside stool.  Passers by come and go and open the door to the pub...letting in some of that oppressive July humidity which hits me while I read the weekly Village Voice and move on to my 4th or 5th drink.                                     The patron count moves from 4 to 20 and I realize it's dark out.....and in this summer solstice that's almost a welcome because it brings out that wistful breeze from Tompkins Square Park which ruffles my shirt as I sit on the ground outside the bar and smoke a cigarette.....counting my toes and waving hello to the passing people and cabs moving along the street.  Every inch of my being is telling me to go home and be noble and finish the day without a scar to wake up early and start fresh the next day and go to work to that cubicle.........but Sophie's is that devil on my right shoulder and what's right is right and who wants to go home when the beer is cold and the company is just perfect?  The night moves to whiskey and the breeze outside has gone to bed which I should have done hours before but chose to extend my hand out hours later to hail an illegible cabride home and sleep with my clothes still on.  Sophie's could have been named Sarah's or Susan's....but I wouldn't have remembered....much like I wouldn't remember much of any of the night waking up at the witching hour and hastily throwing some clothes on to run out for the subway and take the ride to work.",5,3,4

64,Christine M.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,1.0,3/9/2014,"I love dive bars with all my heart, I like cheap drinks and mellow ambiance when I meet up with friends. I went to Sophie's several time over the last year, and always had a fantastic time. Unfortunately, my experience last night was such a disappointment that I doubt I will ever return. I could give it another chance but New York City is filled with awesome places to drink and listen to chill music, and nobody has to put up with bad service. This is called self-respect. Okay okay, I understand that bartenders are people too, and everyone has rough days that make it harder to be pleasant. But I worked in the service industry and restoration for a few years, and I never took my bad mood out on customers. But gosh, do yourself a favor and go spend your money somewhere that values your business, especially since dive bars are by definition comfortable and low-key places. Last night, was Saturday night in Manhattan, and a couple of friends and I decided to go to Sophie's after getting dinner. I recommended Sophie's to others because my previous visits have been magical and I was excited to return and share with people I love the happiness of drinking at a great bar. We are not rowdy people nor are we disrespectful. There were no reasons to receive bad service.Some of us went to the bar to order drinks, while others took over the jukebox, the laziest of us stayed at the table and smiled. It was a quiet evening at the bar, not too crowded, the music was fun, and all the factors were lined up for a wonderful evening. At some points friends previously at the bar returned to the table with drinks. We had almost forgotten they came with us to Sophie's since maybe 15 - 20 minutes had passed since we had seen them. Seriously, almost 20 minutes. Now, some of you may say ""Hey but you are not the center of the world, one bartender can only serve so many people at once"", which is a valid and worthy point, but no, the bar had almost nobody, the bartender did not seem to be apologetic for making anyone wait, he passed my friends trying to order multiple times without acknowledging them... So I fear that I have to say that this bartender was grumpy, and maybe should re-consider his decision of working at a bar if he despises people so much. I don't care how long one has work at a place, it is no excuse to be unpleasant. Anyways, someone ordered a whisky sour, well it came in a wine glass and looked nothing like a whisky sour, which made very little sense to anyone. So he didn't receive a tip since the drink was not really what it was supposed to be and was charged for, and the service was unacceptable. Granted, I do think that not giving tip is a bit of a jerk move but sometimes it's the most efficient way to demonstrate discontent. So then, when he returned for a second round, he was told by the bartender that he did not want to serve him anymore... so basically, both were being a bit stubborn. Meanwhile, other friends sitting at the bar closer to the pool table waited for a pretty long time also before receiving their drinks. **This fact is important because it demonstrates that the bartender hated us but did not offer better service to other customers he could not hate yet since he did not know we were affiliated with the other people at the other end of the bar.Long story short- don't know who this bartender is, don't care how long he's worked there, he needs to either be more efficient at serving people spending money in his establishment or maybe just be more pleasant when he finally pays attention to customers. I am sorry I have to leave a negative review of the bar, it's just that last night shattered my dreams and ruined part of my night because I don't like people being upset. The positive note is that there are plenty more bars in the city, where I don't have to feel bad for paying for a drink at a bar. Peace",4,5,

It's enough for the semi serious pool shark who's waiting to get his ass handed to him (you're welcome, mitchland).  Drinks are reasonably priced, and the divey smokey atmosphere is on point.  I don't know if I'd come here again though, unless someone tells me there's a happy hour special.",2,1,2
93,M H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,93,2,5.0,2/7/2013,"I spent 1992-2000 drunk in this bar.  What can I say, except that I don't drink anymore. It definitely wasn't the same since Bruce Jones (the guy in the portrait by the pool table) did his last call, and I couldn't bear to be there much longer after because I still felt his presence and missed him terribly when I went,  but every few years, I would wander in for a beer, then eventually, a soda.  New crops of kids would come in to enjoy pretty much the same jukebox music kept there from the 90's (or even earlier- old timers, correct me).  Regulars would come and go, but it was always old-school service- shot and beer place, and keep the cocktails classic, under 5 ingredients.  I remember going back in 2008 once after not having been there for 3 years, and seeing a bartender that hadn't been there since 2000 come up to me, nonchalantly say, ""pint of light, the usual?"" as if I had never left, or better yet as if he had never left, for more than half a decade.  Time seems to stop at Sophie's.  I think they still have Barefoot Eddie's toy art stashed on a shelf somewhere.  If I were to ever go into an alcoholic relapse and decide to hide away forever, this place would be it.",1,1,1
94,Carla L.,"New York, NY",119,240,22,4.0,1/9/2009,"A classic dive bar.  Bare, grungy, crusty, and cheap.  Pool table, jukebox, and Big Buck Hunter.  Kept us entertained and perfectly happy for hours.",1,,
95,Jack B.,"New Harmony, IN",0,2,0,5.0,7/1/2011,"Small town atmosphere, away from the hustle and bustle. Good selection in Jukebox tunes & the drink prices have been spoken. I would not change anything, but add...a more selection on strong hops tasting IPAs, like Stone IPA?

98,Justin G.,"New York, NY",47,125,1,4.0,5/26/2010,"This is MY BAR cuz I live on this street and Ace rubs me the wrong way four nights a week when loud idiots scream at each other in the streets outside my window.  But Sophie's, it's a normal dive bar with comfy seats and a good jukebox, just like everyone else says. It's quiet enough to meet someone for a conversation but loud enough to remind you it's a dive bar. I go there for the mugs - yes you can get pints but sometimes I just want a quick beer that's a bit smaller, and that's where the $2.50 Guinness comes in handy. I don't mind if Ace's continues to keep me up at night as long as those halfwits don't start migrating over to my Sophie's!",1,,
99,Katherine M.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",5,27,4,4.0,7/27/2010,We left ACE and started to walk up the block. We saw a bar with tons of lights. We went in and found Sophies! A total dive bar with cheap drinks fun crowd and nice bartender. Would not hesitate to end the night here again...I mean where else in NYC can you buy a round for $10.00?!?!,,1,
100,Catherine F.,"New York, NY",14,5,0,5.0,8/27/2009,"When I go here, I feel like a horse in a stable. Which can be really comforting. And there are all my horsie friends hanging around with me, chewing straw and drinking it down. And here comes our kind farmer with more drinks and a pat on the head. Home sweet home.",2,4,2
101,Matt D.,"Boston, MA",88,251,8,4.0,5/20/2010,"I made a point of heading to Sophies during my visit to New York City after Anthony Bourdain stopped by during a No Reservations episode on Manhattan. I liked the fact Sophies was a little out of the way and a place where the locales hang out. My friends and I spent a lazy Sunday afternoon here. The beers were cheap and the service was friendly. I really liked the atmosphere. The jukebox had Iggy Pop's Lust for Life album and a Best of David Bowie album, a nice plus. I think if I lived in New York, I would be at this dive bar at least once a week.",,,1
102,Stephen B.,"Flushing, NY",176,300,266,4.0,8/2/2010,"Spent a lot of time in this dive bar in the 90's.  Love the place.  The fight to get a beer when it's crowded, the dirty bathroom.  I loved going there early and getting a table with friends and just hanging out all knight.  Lovely lovely times.",,,
103,Kate F.,"Houston, TX",2,477,17,3.0,8/14/2010,"Awesome juke box ... weird smell, not very good drink deals for a dive (i want a 3 dollar beer, please.) Seriously a meh experience.",,,
104,Melissa A.,"New York, NY",27,6,0,5.0,4/25/2006,"As Bobby F. stated,"" I shouldn't even be telling you this"", but since the secrets out I will. Sophie's is the greatest dive of them all! I know it's gotten more popular, which has unfortunately put off some of the old regulars(old as in how long they've been going), but it's still Sophie's. This joint has the best jukebox selection of them all, a slightly slanted but well-used pool table, cheap strong drinks, and plenty of cool easy-going people to chill with. If you're into posh and luxurious hang-outs, this is NOT the place for you! If you're into kicking back with some friends, listening to great music while you knock back some drinks, and meeting a wide array of people, you'll love it. There's more I could say about Sophie's, but I won't. You'll know as soon as you're inside if this is the place for you.",3,1,2
105,Niles S.,"Atlanta, GA",6,29,0,4.0,2/13/2007,"Despite the ""grisly clientele"", Sophie's was recently famous for its underage drinking.  Since then the cops have stepped in and the bar has returned to its former dive glory.  The jukebox is great (Clash, Television, John Lee Hooker, etc..), the beer's alright and the crowd is as indifferent to you as you are to them.  I find Sophie's is best enjoyed on an off-night with a couple friends, sitting at a table, buying pitchers and pumping dollars into the jukebox.  Just ignore the old man at the bar staring at your girlfriend.  He's cool.",2,2,1
106,Adam N.,"New York, NY",7,34,0,4.0,4/20/2009,"Truly a dive bar, but the best night to come is on Sunday Nights.  There is a live old time music Jam there with great musicians playing old time music.  The TV is still on so you can watch the game and listen to the music.  I love it.",1,,
107,Gina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",254,207,2,4.0,11/30/2005,"Highly recommended, assuming you can find it.  On E. 5th, amongst a barrage of trendy cafes Sophie's sits unmarked, hiding from the hipster culture you would expect to see drinking $3 McSorley's pints at an Alphabet City bar.  Sophie's has all the charm of your neighborhood hole in the wall; cheap beer, a well-stocked juke box, and pool table.  Come by for the no-nonsense vibe and to get a good buzz going for under $20.",2,,1
108,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,2.0,4/11/2007,"Its divey. Crusty. Regulars type place. When I went there was a weird mix of underage collegiates and older men. I was drunk and wasn't feeling the more laid back vibe, so I left.",2,,

I shouldn't even be telling you about this because if it got randomly popular it would be ruined.A pool table, $4 pints or $11 pitchers of yuengling black & tan, a grisly clientele of old school locals, bike messengers, and a few younger folk lacking pretension make this a great bar to spend a week night in.",,2,

121,elise h.,"New York, NY",52,239,6,3.0,10/13/2008,"Sophie's offers absolutely nothing in the way of glamour, excitement or newness -- but it's managed to stay open for years and years, and there's certainly something to that.  When you go in, you'll immediately notice a musty smell about the place that makes you think it hasn't been washed for decades.  This is dive personified.  But there's never anything too annoying on the jukebox, there's a pool table in the back and their drinks are cheaper than most places in the neighborhood.  There's nothing pretentious about the place at all and you can feel comfortable drinking here whether you're 50 or 20.  There's usually lots of older regulars sitting at the bar, but it's mostly a young folks establishment.  Weekend nights get pretty crowded, but any other time you go there's a table for you to sit at.  I hate ordering mixed drinks at this place (they don't do them well) but if you just get a beer or a glass of scotch you are good to go.  Not the most interesting place but it's a good option if you really don't feel like thinking about where to go.",1,,
