2,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,4.0,7/3/2018,"Nice, welcoming salad bar/cafe just a block away from the west side of Times Square. They serve breakfast and lunch here. On the TV they have up above, the World Cup was going on the and the workers were cheering on for Mexico. It was a rediculously hot morning when I walked in. We're having a heat wave right now, and even though it wasn't even 10AM yet, already it felt like it was above 90 degrees. I haven't even cooked anything in my own house because of this heat, I've been eating outside. I came in to Cafe Kabila and decided on a mushroom and cheese omelette. The server behind the counter made it right in front of me and of course I took a picture of him making it LOL.",8,4,4

Updated review","Chicken salad sandwich for MealPal still has great flavor, but it has definitely decreased in size--not sure it really qualifies as a meal now, more like a snack...disappointing.",3,,
4,Liz A.,"Kearny, NJ",76,1,0,5.0,11/1/2018,"This is my favorite lunch place. Today I got a sweet potato and poblano soup - it was so good. Their soup is incredible! Lots of daily vegan, vegetarian, dairy free, gluten-free (as well as some creamy and/or meaty options) and they are always bettwr than the other local spots. Earlier this week I tried the goat cheese and portobello sandwich and it was truly the best sandwich I've had in so long. My coworkers and I freak out about this place all the time, always calling for their daily soups lol. They also have breakfast but I've never had it. I've tried some smoothies as well and although they aren't as good as the soup, they're still very good. They don't offer half sandwiches but I usually get a sandwich and a large soup and it's more than enough for lunch for two days.",,,
5,Rosie S.,"Syosset, NY",88,15,8,4.0,9/19/2018,Changed my review because I have them another chance after hearing back from their service rep. I go here frequently and haven't had another issue. The guy let me use my free soup offer with a purchase of salad even after I paid and forgot to use it! Nice. I hope to get more offers though because that's where I usually choose where to get lunch!,,,
6,Daniel K.,"New York, NY",116,43,0,5.0,1/31/2018,"I truly cannot say enough good about this place. It's the absolute best soup/salad/sandwich/smoothie joint in Midtown. If what you want starts with an S, come here.It's actually Moroccan fusion, which you'd never know from any signage in the place. And by now I've probably explored the whole menu, and their take on everything is good. I've converted a swath of my coworkers, and according to my mint.com, I've managed to spend over $2000. Somehow, I have no regrets. Go here to get takeout, because it's not really a sit-down joint. Your lunch place probably sucks by comparison.",,,
7,Sam R.,"Manhattan, NY",384,26,7,5.0,6/30/2018,Absolutely amazing from start to finish. Aziz the owner warmly greeted me as i entered. There is a bevy of beautifully delicious and healthy options.  I chose the hot buffet in back and it was stunning. Cooked in a perfect blend of Moroccan spices. Had five different dishes. After friendly banter he gave me a free special Moroccan mint tea!  This place is a must go for all in nyc. Good price too! Shukran habibi!!!!,,,

All the servers were extremely friendly, offering us tea or water as they walked by. I got an omelette and smoothie. Both were amazing. The food looked and tasted super fresh and was priced very reasonably. By far the best breakfast place I've eaten at in the city.",,,
9,Shawn H.,"San Francisco, CA",1,3,4,5.0,3/15/2018,"Stopped by for a quick breakfast, and this place met every expectation. The staff was extremely helpful and multiple workers were making sure that we had been helped. I ordered a make your own omelette and a smoothie. There were so many smoothie options with lots of fresh foods and extra additives available. Same goes for the omelette bar as there were lots of vegetables and options from which to choose. Everything was so fresh and efficient and decently priced too. The breakfast potatoes were incredible and far better than many attempts at the side that I have had before. I definitely would come back to this place if I got a chance.",1,,1

The salad in the other hand was merely passable. The Kabila mix greens that they used were stale(more yellow than green) and they did not even add enough dressing. Overall, I thought that the food was tad overpriced for the quality.",,,
14,Soren N.,"ASTORIA, NY",82,216,82,4.0,1/8/2017,"This is a pretty decent sandwich spot in a pretty barren neighborhood. I stopped by for lunch a few days after Christmas and the place was nearly deserted. They have a huge menu of soups, salads and sandwiches and chairs inside for seating. You order directly from the cooks and then checkout cafeteria style before sitting down. I went for the hot avocado and turkey sandwich and it was pretty tasty. This is a great place to go if you work in the neighborhood or want a quick meal, but I wouldn't travel out of my way to come here.",,,

17,Stephanie S.,"Clifton, NJ",744,684,1735,5.0,10/13/2014,"Not your typical NYC tossed salad, soup and sandwich cafe. This place is a bit of an upgrade. The food bar has some nice Mediterranean selections. The soup options are very creative, I noticed they had chicken curry and butternut squash just to name a few. I tried the turkey chili and the flavor rocked, but it was more like turkey vegetable brothy soup than chili. The sandwiches look great, my co-worker ordered one and liked it a lot. The salads are good too. They have a great bakery selections with flavored iced coffees. They also provide you with many sweetening options like agave syrup, brown and white sugar cubes, etc. Overall a really nice lunch spot!",,,

21,Leesa G.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",49,13,2,2.0,10/19/2015,"I ordered a beef kebob box for lunch via Seamless since I saw it recommended by someone else. Maybe mine was made different, but it really wan't anything worth going for. The veggies that came with it were alright. Just cabbage and zucchini. However, the food part of the dish...meh. The rice was edible but pretty dry and tasteless. The meat was really dry. I could barely eat it even with the dressing, and I don't think I'd have been able to eat it at all without it. As it was, I couldn't finish all three pieces. I also ordered a Kabila Spiced Chai latte, which tasted find but was far too sweet. Yes, I did order it with the vanilla syrup but shouldn't they know not to put both the sugar AND the syrup in it? Since it was a size small, it really made a big difference. Also, the bottom was just clumpy chai spice which was pretty unpleasant.On the upside, they have a very quick delivery. It took only 30 minutes to get it from the time I placed the order online.",,,

29,Richard B.,"Bronx, NY",968,997,600,2.0,12/4/2012,"I dropped in here to use an incredible free $7 credit through level up. I had no idea what to get as places like this give me anxiety. You get screamed at by 50 people at once to place your order. I was in the mood for Thai, but since I was using my iphone while walking down the street at the same time like i was drunk I quickly ducked into this place. Since the deal was practically free lunch and I noticed they had a  Thai meatball sandwich, I went with it. The meat ball was more like a gyro meat, and the sauce was not peanuty at all as advertised. I'm not sure what these flavors were, but they were no where near Thai. The hero was quite messy but edible though. In the end the damage was $2.75 to my credit card after applying the $7 discount. But I would never pay almost $10 for that in real life. It's just not practical or worth it for that cafeteria style food they serve here.",1,,

The only reason why it didn't receive 5 stars is because sometimes the quality can shift- sometimes it's super good and then not so great (but still good). I usually get the chicken grilled cheese. The soups are always on point however and I am never disappointed with them.,1,,

There was a sign, so that's my fault for not reading, but who quotes prices per half a pound? Very shady. Sandwiches will run you $10. My co-worker got soup and salad and it was $15.

61,Jess M.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,11,15,4.0,10/18/2012,"Bright clean place in the middle of a dirty, loud block of city. Seems a bit pricey, but I'm willing to pay a bit more for veggies/healthier food in midtown. Seems like a pretty new place, but if I'm working in this area again, I'd plan to go back.",1,,
62,Veronica W.,"Princeton, NJ",0,8,5,5.0,1/28/2015,"This is my favorite place to eat lunch and it's pretty clear that it's a lot of people's favorite place to eat lunch. I always get the buffet food in the back of the store, which has a variety of really unique indian, greek and american food. I never know what new things are going to be there and the flavors of every dish are so unique. Definitely a place to try!",,,
63,Alison T.,"Austin, TX",40,16,2,4.0,12/6/2012,"Clean, great selection, friendly staff, good prices. Used LevelUp app to pay and got a $7 credit. Try the buffet in the back. Good garment district lunch spot.",,,
64,Robert P.,"Teaneck, NJ",2,4,0,5.0,1/17/2013,"I really love their coffee, the best in midtown and little wait.  It's a revolving selection- I especially love it when they have Ethiopian coffee.Friendly service, too.",,,
65,Omar V.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,1,5.0,12/13/2014,"Oh my god this place is designed Very modern , and the service and the food is amazing , there Tunisian tuna sandwich is amazing it literally melts in your mouth and it has a lot of taste and flavor not like the restaurant or the cafes around the area definitely one of my favorite not just there sandwiches but also there buffer area in the back there coffee is # 1. I definitely recommend.",,,
66,M P.,"Astoria, NY",0,7,0,3.0,12/13/2012,"The area is a culinary black hole, so I was very excited to see a new, clean, different lunch spot. Went in on the first day and got a smoothie. It was so good and so well priced (Heath King nearby, with their $10 disaster smoothies needs to take lessons from Kabila). They also do fresh fruit juices, also great. Their signature sandwiches are beyond fresh and delicious combos (my favorite is the Smoked Salmon Sandwich-yum). Best of all there is a small Market table at the very back of the store. This is NOTHING like the ""buffets"" that the grimey lunch spots nerby have. The Market table at Kabila is small, INSPIRED and delicious. It changes every day and offers a well edited spread of healthy and well balanced options (proteins, greens, carbs). The manager is always present and takes a personal interest in each customer's experience.",1,,
67,Luke C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,3,0,5.0,11/9/2012,Great Lunch spot that is the sister cafe of Cafe Madiba near Union Square. Forget the everything else and go straight for the soups at the back of the cafe. They rotate daily and are amazing. The Turkey Pot Pie is my new favorite soup of all time.,1,,
68,Sophie R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,40,0,3.0,12/13/2012,"Tried the hot food buffet in the back based on reviews on yelp.  Wasn't so sure if I wanted to go hot food vs soup, salad, sandwiches, etc.  After I cannot decide I saw a bunch of people together getting hot food buffet so I thought must be good and thought to try it myself.  I also saw a 20% off sign so I decided this is it.  Went to the back and tried some items such as spicy chicken of some sort (1 piece), then 1 crab meat patty, and 1 piece jerk chicken thigh.  Checked out and became 7.05 dollars after a 20% discount!  Wow for 3 items that is quite expensive I thought.  I tried the food and it was Okay.  I was still hungry of course.  That was more so of a snack.  Spent $7 and I was not satisfied.  Quality wise it was alright but could be better.  It also did not have a lot of food.  There was some selection but the selection itself did not have a lot of food.  For example, there was only 4 crab cakes when I got there.  There was only 3 pieces or so left of the jerk chicken.  That was around noon so why so little food per selection?!  I don't get it.  It must be that good or they only make so little.  Overall - okay food but way expensive and did not satisfy my hunger.",,,
