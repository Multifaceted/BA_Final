0,Leena C.,"Houston, TX",154,419,146,5.0,8/9/2018,"Sweet Caroline. Woot woot.Best accidental find ever. Flew in late and was looking for a spot for food and a few drinks. And low and behold Dalton appears. Nice clean bar with a huge beer list and lots of groovy music. That night it was old skool. Yes with the k, lol.We ordered food. Pizza and sliders and both were delish. They had a late night happy hour and we ordered a few drinks from there. The patrons and staff were very friendly. The bartender Caroline was so amazing. She was nice and helpful. Giving us a list of spots to hit up and she was soooo right. I wanted to go back to thank her but we moved hotels and didn't have much time but that list was our saving grace. It seemed like a nice neighborhood spot. Everyone was so welcoming and the staff was A plus plus. Would def recommend it. And will def be back on my next visit.",,,

Love that they have their beer menu posted on a TV screen. And they have a great selection of tough to find on draft brews. Plenty of TV's to watch sports. Bartenders were attentive.

We left the bar for about 5 minutes and came back in to use the restroom. We greeted them hello as we walked in, and said thank you as we left. The bartender said ""yeah next time buy something."" We said we were here earlier, they responded with ""Shut up"", ""we don't care."" It was our last night in New York, and this place left a very sour taste in our mouth.Drinks were ok.",2,1,2

Updated review","Very pleased with my lunch today. In addition to the great bartender, my burger was delicious with soft avocado, a toasted bun and butter lettuce. I am not into sports except horse racing, but the number of TVs (not too loud) is impressive. A bonus was the sweet potato fries, as they had a nice crisp to them I have rarely found elsewhere. A good layout with big windows at the front that open make this a good place to go, particularly for sports. I also like the roomy restrooms. On my favs list.",,,
4,Nathalie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",646,140,494,4.0,3/2/2018,"DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND A BAR IN MIDTOWN WITH DECENT PRICED BEERS AND BREAD THAT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE CARDBOARD? My boyfriend and I were so surprised by this place. Cannot tell you how many times we've rushed to a sports bars in midtown only to find they weren't showing the basketball game of the night but some hockey team or baseball highlights instead, without the volume on. We were seated at the bar right in front of the largest screen that they have. I ordered the Turkey club ($16) and was so happy with it. Great looking sandwich and tasted just as good. Avocado, bacon, goat cheese (MMMMM), lettuce, tomato and this awesome cranberry mustard on multigrain that my bf liked so much he ordered one himself. Great service and we finally enjoyed the All Star Game!",4,2,1

6,Molly B.,"New York, NY",110,43,37,4.0,9/24/2018,"Honestly this is one of my favorite casual sports bars in Manhattan. It's a chill environment with nice service, and the food is good. A nice place to just relax after work, with a good happy hour special. Wine and beer are around $5 and cosmos are $6 until 7pm. Some good cheap beer options as well. Just an overall solid place. The wings are good, and so are the nachos and burgers. Some good classic pub bar food.",,,
7,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,4.0,2/22/2018,"Your average Midtown Irish-style sports bar in Hell's Kitchen area that probably gets most of it business from tourist, business happy hour and those hanging around the Time square/Hell's Kitchen area.  Been here a few times with a large group of friends at night and during a weekend day.  Ambience: spacious bar with a good amount of seating that could accommodate large groups.  If need be they'll even put tables together togethers.  Long bar with a good amount of tv's to catch whatever sporting event is on.  Has more of a modern style feel than your average old Irish pub which attracts a diverse crowd.  Atmosphere/Staff:  It can get busy in here but not to the point where it's super packed and obnoxiously loud.  You'll be able to hold a conversation with friends (even on karaoke night).  Mixed crowd at night time and you'll see the regulars during peak happy hour time.  The staff is attentive for the most part but I've noticed one time that they've seemed understaffed and overwhelmed a bit.  Nonetheless the bartenders and waiters has always provided good service to our group.     Drinks/Food:  Better than your average sports bar food.  I've tried a few different dishes off the menu and never really had a complaint. Would recommend the chicken fingers, the build your own burger and truffle mac & cheese.   The one thing I really like is their decent size selection of beers both on tap and in bottle.  They've also adopted the newer menu screen which I enjoy seeing in bars.  Beers are your usual Manhattan style price, but they do have a good happy from 12pm-7pm and 12am-4am.",,,
8,Elizabeth M.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,95,174,4.0,5/23/2018,"I've been here a few times. More drinks than food..this particular night I decided to try the wings and sliders. I wasn't too keen on the flavor of the sliders as they came off rather bland and the wings were overcooked. It was surely just an off night. The drinks and service, however, are stellar! Every time I've been here for drinks the bartenders are super nice and attentive. They have numerous screens for you to watch games or whatever event may be playing that night. It's a good place to stop in if you're killing time or with friends to pass the time.",2,,3

11,Casey C.,"Bayonne, NJ",250,66,48,3.0,10/18/2017,"Decent spot.  Nothing out of the ordinary...basic Irish style with a long bar and plenty of televisions to watch whatever sporting event is on.  Gets pretty busy during happy hour and/or if there are any big games.The wait staff is pretty attentive and the selection of Beer is better than a lot of places of this ilk.  Pricey however...Expect to pay at least 8 for most beers...and they actually 12 oz beers that in my mind should be the full pint.  Happy hour can still get you 4 dollar bud light...but if you like light beer...just go to Rudys the next block over for 8 dollar pitchers of the swill.  Pic included of the cheesteak...which even though pricey was solid.  Kudos to not calling it a ""philly cheesesteak"" bc it clearly was more of a sliced steak sand with onions and peppers.  (If you don't know the difference then you clearly don't know the difference)  The roasted peppers were fresh, large and full of flavor and the meat itself was above average.I wouldn't call this a neighborhood bar by any stretch...more like a tourist/business happy hour spot.  Most likely picks up a lot of business due to its proximity to Port Authority.  For sure leaps and bounds better than any place in there.Pricing slightly above what I had hoped but still a solid spot worth coming back from time to time; especially for the games",,,

Their TVs are extremely large, and you can see the game from anywhere you sit.Beers are pricey; think $8 for Blue Moons. Surprised there weren't pitchers, just beer buckets. Since I was going to be overcharged anyway, decided to go with a Delirium Tremens at $10. Tasty. We split some buffalo wings for $13, which were spicy but had good meat on the bone.Giving them a bump up because service was so good-- they are attentive on the floor and frequently checked in without making it seem like they were pressuring us to order more. Bathrooms were also very clean.If you must watch sports in Hell's Kitchen, not a bad pick.",1,,1

18,Christopher Y.,"Manhattan, NY",324,88,65,3.0,2/22/2017,"Average spot. Mix of your typical Irish local bar and sports bar. Some guys are definitely usuals here, drinking away and chatting casually with the bar tender and landing free beers. Cool. They appreciate loyalty. Other fellas are drinking and yelling at the TV with moving people in jerseys, trying to throw round air filled objects into orange rimmed nets. When did we begin to care so much about Carmelo?Service was meh, beer prices were eh. Only reason this bar is still open in my opinion is the wide selection of beer, the removal of the Times Square crowd, and the vast space. They have at least 15 beers on tap alone and more bottled beer, so you're bound to find something you like. Cheers to the hostess who took a picture for us. Boo to the bartender who thought correcting our pronunciation out loud to the rest of the bar was educational. Won't be back anytime soon though. I prefer to embarrass myself alone, in front of a mirror, holding a juice box.Also, broken glasses are no fun, you'll hear that from everyone.",2,1,2

Lots of tv's with sports on. I figured the food couldn't be very good. Boy was I wrong! The food is the reason to go.

We stumbled upon Dalton's while we were walking around. It turned out to be really nice inside. They had tables across from the bar that are family friendly. It was nice and clean. And the bartendar was knowledgable about their extensive beer selection which was displayed on a few tv monitors on the walls.I started with a Chimay Triple White, and then I had a Lagunitas Brown Shugga 2016.

30,Midwestern Perspective S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",87,32,33,4.0,1/21/2018,"Midwestern Guy: Dalton's Bar & Grill is a great sports bar in the Hell's Kitchen area. They have tons of TV's and typically show every game (we mostly went here during baseball playoffs and football season). They are also willing to swap TV's to whatever team you root for, within reason. Dalton's has a decent beer selection with a roaming list of all-day happy hour specials that typically includes bud light, yuengling, and at least one ""semi-craft"" draft. Their chicken sandwiches are amazing, grilled or fried, and their french fries are excellent. I recommend getting extra aioli with your order, as it goes well with the fries. I have yet to try the wings here, but they always smell delicious as the wait staff walks by.Midwestern Gal: there is a great food selection with options ranging from salad, to fried chicken, to soup. To echo what midwestern guy said, the chicken sandwich and aioli are amazing! They also have a build your own burger option which is great for the picky eaters (cough, cough, me) out there.  I would not recommend the grilled cheese. It is just american cheese in between two pieces of white bread.  Everything else I've had has been very good!  I wish they had a longer happy hour but can't complain too much, that's NY for you! Also, the service has been excellent every time we have been in.",,,
31,Amelia A.,"New York, NY",292,151,565,3.0,6/20/2016,"Stopped in on a whim bc a group of us were trying to find a last minute meet up spot for another friend to join.Location/Accessibility : Certainly very close to the ACE train's 42nd St stop.  Very obvious and easy to find along 9th Ave.Ambience : Your typical sports bar for sure.  Plenty of tv's, lit well enough, and quite spacious.  The noise level was pretty average, although the place certainly wasn't packed, and there weren't any huge games going on at the time.  Got there a little after 7, so the happy hour crowd would've been gone for the most part (or so I assume).  Good for groups though if you want to come with several friends.  There were 5 of us tonight, and they were more than happy to push some tables together to accommodate.Service : Eh. This was very much just okay.  The server was essentially just doing her job.  Wasn't overly friendly or helpful, but I wouldn't go so far as to say she was unpleasant either.  She seemed a little annoyed that she had to come back twice for our drink order, but who knows. Maybe she was having a rough day.  Drinks came out quickly - 2 cocktails and 3 beers.  Drink : I ordered the Caribbean Rum Punch.  It looked very pretty, unfortunately it didn't taste so great.  Definitely had the coconut flavor, but I'm one of those people that strongly prefers to have as little of that alcohol taste and burn as possible.  This was one of those drinks that I downed just not to waste.Overall, it didn't seem like anything special.  However, to be fair, I wish I'd tried some of their food.  Perhaps that would've offset things a bit.  If you're looking for any bar to grab a drink at, then this place is fine; but if you're looking for special drinks or a place that is super unique/fun, then there are certainly better finds.",1,1,

Nothing spectacular going on here but Dalton's gets five stars because of its consistently good food and service. The burgers and boneless buffalo wings have never been less than delicious, and the drink prices are comparable to the cheaper bars in the area. The wait staff is usually very attentive and makes sure that you'll never have an empty glass. Great for watching any sports games as well, you can see pretty much every TV in the bar no matter where you sit. Dalton's is definitely worth a visit!",,,

Caroline, our bartender, is what made our night. She's very friendly and made us feel welcome. Additionally, she is attentive and provided high-quality service.

It was a Saturday and I passed by and it was very empty so I got a table. The bar situation does not look all that bad if one had to sit at the bar. It is a large space with high top tables almost throughout. The restrooms are in the back. The bar consumes one wall. I sat down, got coffee and ordered a beef burger medium well which came with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle on a toasted brioche. I got a piece of American cheese [1.50 extra] Other additions are also extra. The burger was delicious.

38,Samantha K.,"Oakland, CA",148,4,6,1.0,7/7/2018,"I've heard good things about Dalton's so I'm disappointed by my experience today, to say the least. It was around 10am and I didn't realize the World Cup was on until heading home with my coffee cup in hand. I stepped inside Dalton's, which wasn't crowded, and the lovely young server asked if I'd like a seat at the bar or at a table and I requested a table. She brought a menu and some water. A few minutes later, a tall man with a Dalton's shirt on walked past, picked up my coffee cup, shook it a little and when I said ""I'm not done with that,"" he walked off mumbling ""there's no outside drinks allowed."" I was in shock and sat quietly stewing for a few minutes. After about 15 minutes, the server came back over and asked if I was going to order because ""my manager said you're going to have to order"" to which I requested to speak directly with him. When he came over, I told him that I didn't appreciate the way he snatched my cup off the table without my permission. He told me that there were no outside drinks allowed (which I totally understand and respect! But again, they were open before official opening hours due to the game and I wasn't told to throw it away before entering.) I said to him that I would have appreciated being told of that and given a chance to either get rid of my drink myself or leave. He repeated ""there are no outside drinks allowed"" and referred to a sign out front. I told him I hadn't seen the sign and still would have appreciated being spoken to rather than have my coffee taken without permission. He continued to robotically repeat himself about the rule, offered no apology for his disrespect, and was fine with my decision to leave. As I walked out, he too, walked outside to prepare the outdoor seating. I stopped and looked for the sign he referred to stating no outside drinks allowed and could not find it anywhere between my seat and the front door so I asked him where it was. His back toward me, he continued to fuss with the chairs so I repeated that I did not see a sign and could he please show it to me. I asked three times and was blatantly ignored. I'll bet if I wasn't a woman sitting alone, I would not have been treated this way; however, it does not matter because I will not be returning to Dalton's with or without my friends!",,,

At the price point, was hoping the cheesesteak was going to be pretty good - unfortunately the meat was extra salty and very dry, and the bread-to-meat ratio was unfavorable. Sweet potato fries were fine. Beer selection is your regular fare.Could get over the food, but the service was lacking. One guy manning the entire bar while the server ladies were chilling since no one was sitting on the tables late at night. This made getting the check, food, and general service much slower than it should have been. I guess the bar is fine if you're just getting a quick drink - just not for me.",2,1,1
46,Hillary B.,"New York, NY",8,131,51,4.0,9/22/2016,"I've been twice- once on a Saturday night around 1 am. It was surprisingly dead, but I was just with a friend looking to have a night cap or two, not looking to party so it was okay for that. But typically on a Saturday I'd want something more wild. The bar tender was super sweet and friendly, very bubbly. The wings were SO HOT I could barely eat them- but a kitchen being open that late is always a plus. The other time I went was for brunch. Their brunch menu offers a complimentary drink which is nice. I got their breakfast sandwich (bacon egg and cheese on a croissant) and it was SOOOO yummy! It was amazing. The Bloody Mary was good too, but a bit spicy. The service was good. Overall good place! I'll be back!",,,
47,Ashlee S.,"Brooklyn, NY",139,33,7,4.0,6/8/2017,"Nice late night happy hour after 11! They always have an impressive draft list, and they even code them (fruity, hoppy, etc.) The mac and cheese has truffle in it and is amazing! Definitely the highlight of all the food we ordered. The quesadilla was a bit overflowing with cheese and the grilled cheese was large yet unimpressive, but the pretzels with beer cheese were really good. We also ordered the tots, and they weren't what we expected- they were ok but I won't be ordering them again. Very friendly service from several servers throughout the night. I liked the ""share all tables"" vibe, because you felt like you could ask anyone for what you needed.I would definitely say pop in after/ before seeing a show. Try to catch the happy hour (4pm- 7pm I believe, then after 11pm) for great deals on drinks! Order the mac and cheese and you won't be disappointed. I will be coming back!",,,

They were delicious.Had chicken tenders and fries. Friend had breakfast flatbread. Fries were good. Chicken tenders were ok. Really thin and hard to cut.

We continued drinking Marker's Mark but what was served wasn't that. The Nachoes were okay. Each chip had a bunch of stuff on it which is good quality to have. I had the Chicken Pot Pie which was basically salty chicken and cream soup in a Ramakin with puff pastry on top. I was not a fan. It also had a weird sweet quality to it.  The Truffle Mac n Cheese was better. Overall, I simply didn't like the place. But it seems like a great place to watch a game and drink beer.

Looks like typical sports bar but their food and presentation are terrific. Ordered a Cobb salad and a chicken panini, which came with fries. Waitress noticed they brought us regular fries, not the sweet potato ones we ordered. So we got both--and they were worth every carb. What a great find.

It's an Irish sports bar with Sunday night Karoake who wouldn't love this place? Every night they're open till 4am and you will always be greeted by a bartender with an Irish accent! The bartenders are pretty cool except for the Red Head so I keep my distance from her. They almost always have drinks specials that include shots, mixed drinks and bottled beers. Do me a favor and stay away from their Sangria it was the biggest mistake ever!! Way too sweet and just I guess something that no one ever orders so it had a bitter taste. The food is decent and the drinks are strong. The crowd is mainly kids that are barely 21 and people that have been going there for years. It's your average neighborhood bar with good vibes.",1,2,1

The vegetable flatbread was also mediocre. The bread was a flat soft pita, which was less substantial bread than I was hoping. The vegetables topping the bread with some cheese were nothing special.

I'm sorry, is there not enough room in this nearly empty bar? We were having fun and wanted to dance, plenty of space to move around us, but that's not how the staff saw it. Two people dancing creates a block for the wait staff to get out of the kitchen to give foods/drinks to the other 15 patrons in the bar.....yeah you're not fooling me.

My friends loved it tho. It taste like any sliders to me. Nothing special. It comes in 3.-Truffle fries were pretty flavorful. I def taste the truffle. My major complaint is that the fries were very short. Most of them felt like it was leftover pieces from the bottom of the pit or just broken? Just annoying to have to grab 3 pieces of fries to equal one normal size fry.-Tots was so good!!! but it only came with 10 pieces. Giving this place 4 stars.

Average price for NYC (non happy hour, skews a bit more than you would like to pay). Our server was very helpful even on a busy Friday night.As for ambiance, top 40 music was playing.

First off we're here for a pitch event, while my mother is pitching I'm trying to enjoy dinner and my beer. So when we arrived no one greeted us, or asked if we wanted menus. We had to flag down another waitress to order just a few beers and eventually when our waitress came around she still didn't bring menus, our menu came from a bar back. I've been sitting here 10 mins, waiting for my grilled cheese after eating my tomato soup which was alright it tasted like an open jar of pasta sauce. I haven't seen my waitress she hasn't bothered to check in on me and at least 4 times I have seen her standing at the POS not even bothering to check in on me. She's made an effort to check in on the other two tables around me but is ignoring my table. The two stars are for the atmosphere, the decent beer prices and for the fact that they have a pretty decent beer menu. I'm pretty disappointed in service, despite the fact it's a busy Wednesday night most folks are seated at the bar or over on the far side of the bar for the pitch event. Very very disappointed.Waitress finally checked in on me to ask if I wanted another beer, but apparently had only heard 2 tomato soups when we told her tomato soup and grilled cheese. Instead of her confirming before walking away, she just went off without checking with me about the food. Absolutely abysmal service and absolutely sad that this would happen.",,1,

I've found the service here to be super spotty time after time, and it never gets better.Once we came for dinner and it was pretty empty and the waitress totally forgot about our group and took us 30 minutes to get our order in. It then additionally took an hour and a half for the food to come out and no apologies from the waitress. We still left her an 18% tip and she had the gall to ask for the extra 2%. The times, they are tough. We felt bad for her, so we gave her the extra dollar, but it was something that I won't forget. I want to spread good karma, but this was a place where my patience was tested. Shouldn't happen at your ""neighborhood friendly bar.""

I ordered the watermelon raspberry margarita. The food was good. It's your standard American food. I'm vegetarian so I only order mozzarella sticks and fries but my friends ordered their wings and burgers. Everyone gave their food a thumbs up. This place could have easily gotten five stars had the service been a little better. We were out for a friend's birthday and it was a party of 7. Orders were placed incorrectly and our server was not attentive. I got the feeling that she knew our party was large so she'd automatically get gratuity.

When I came here for happy hour, I was kinda confused by a sign that said $5 for a shot and beer. I thought it was for both together, which I thought was amazing. But it was $5 for each. Tricky tricky. However, for their happy hour, they do have $4 beers which is pretty decent for the area. However, where they shine is their food. When I came for dinner, I ordered the chicken pot pie. HEAVENLY. It was HUGE. It was DELICIOUS. It was everything I could hope for and it was not at all expensive. My friend got the fish and chips which were also cooked to perfection. Another friend got mussels, and while I'm not a huge fan of mussels in general everyone else seemed to love it. Another friend got truffle mac and cheese, and we thought that might not be a good idea cause we thought that they would skimp out on the chicken and other meat in it, but it had a very decent portion of proteins in it. The service during happy hour was a little slow (especially when you're trying to chug as many beers as possible before happy hour ends), but when we went during dinner, it was pretty empty and the service was great. I guess you can expect when it's busy, for service to be a bit slower. Overall a good experience both times.",1,,

The crowd is mixed mostly young professionals that are from the area so it doesn't have that touristy feel to it. Food is from what I can remember the few times I've ordered was ok.

I had had a disappointing burger the day before and needed a fix of delicious bar food.I'm glad we found Dalton's.Their happy hour specials were nothing special, only a few choices, both Pale Ales, so I went with Purple Haze. They were out, so I instead got Blue Moon. We ordered the pretzel, that came with spicy ranch and a weird fruit dip we avoided. The ranch was a great addition, though. I should stop ordering pretzels at non-German restaurants. They're never as good as Auntie Anne's, and always much more expensive, but I digress.My buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious! Just what I needed. On tasty bread, and with a generous helping of crispy french fries, it totally hit the spot.An added bonus came when our server came around and was giving out free bottles of Coors. The fact that Coors is so-so is not their fault. Free beer! Always a good thing.When we got the check we found that I had been charged for both the Purple Haze (that I didn't get) and the Blue Moon.

There is always good seating, nice crowd, friendly staff and an inexpensive bill afterwards! I love how close it is to Broadway, Port Authority and the Lincoln tunnel!

When we 1st came in it looked like a nicer sports bar and also a little familiar. (I later realized I had been here last year before going to see the Dropkick Murphy's at Terminal 5.) The day bartender was so nice and very attentive. She greeted us promptly and had drinks in front of us before we got settled in our seat. We ordered food too, which was pretty good, better than average bar food. The game was on most of the televisions and the sound was played over the main sound system and easy to hear. Unfortunately, after we ate it was the bartender shift change and the night bartender SUCKED. I don't know how he managed to keep that job long enough for some of the regulars to know his name, because his BLATANT disregard of his customers was appalling! I actually took a photo of my empty Guinness glass because that's what sat in front of me most of the evening.

I thought that was great and when she brought out our separate bills I was still being charged for a drink and my friend was receiving a free drink. I asked about this, as it didn't really make sense to me. I was calm and not angry or aggressive. I simply said that I didn't understand why. Frankly, my friend's food didn't have a hair in it. I was met with complete defensiveness. Even when the manager came to explain it to me, he was immediately defensive. He ended up crinkling up my bill and storming off. I never asked for anything to be free, and I wasn't refusing to pay for that one drink, I was just asking for them to explain and I was treated poorly as a result.

It's your average bar/pub with yummy food. We got the quesadillas and sliders which were very good. They have a ton of tvs (check out the pic) all playing sports, so I guess this is the place to go for catching a game. The service was good. However it was kind of annoying when our appetizers came out with our food. (definition of appetizer: a small dish of food or a drink taken before a meal or the main course of a meal to stimulate one's appetite.) Our waitress informed us that the food all comes out together. Fail. They surprisingly played really good music. I say surprisingly because the place seemed empty and not a spot to bump and grind.

I surveyed the area, mostly men and 2 other women. I finished my drink and asked for the check. It was $12.50...really? I was a little upset, it was a bit much just for a vodka red bull.

There were also happy hour draft and bottle deals going on for $5. A group of 7 arrived for early dinner and to watch the games around 6pm on a Saturday. It was not packed yet but getting there.

The staff was very nice and they changed the channel for us to watch the game we were interested in. They did have nice happy hour specials that were available from 12-8. However, for a sports bar, I found it to be a bit dead for a Saturday filled with sports. What's the test of a successful sports bar? A crowd of loyal fans religiously watching their respective teams.The food was fine, but it was nothing out of the ordinary.

They were both hoppy beers that have shorter shelf life than most; it could be that they don't go fast with their current crowd. The nachos I had weren't well-layered.

There's not much to say about this place other than the fact that the bartenders are nice and attentive when you need them too. What I really liked was usually the front staff won't care about seating you. I was so shocked when one of the hostess guys led us to the bar and even pulled up a chair for me.

We were seating in the back with a lot of space. First of all, I would only come here for Happy Hour. If not for happy hour, a Stella goes for $7-8. The happy hour drinks were a bit watered down. If you get the more expensive cocktails ($9-10), they are stronger. My friends got food here and it was okay, nothing crazy, just regular bar food. On the plus side, the waitress were overly attentive, checking up on us several time. They did add a 18% gratuity so I expect decent service. They also had several TVs broadcasting all the sports channel. If you have a big party and it's 7pm and all the bars are super crowded, come here for that one hour of Happy Hour drinks.",1,2,1

145,D h.,"Indianapolis, IN",28,558,2225,3.0,11/10/2011,"Much bigger place and without a doubt, a sports bar. Tons of little pennant things that all beer companies distribute to compliment the other numerous sports flags. Tons of 42"" hdtvs on the north and south walls, with a couple more hung around the entry. Very frickin loud and darker lighting, though the tvs brighten it up.  A big place for nyc.  Probably 20 bar stools with thin black padding and a wooden back.  Black bar top (wooden, but it lacks any character) with no rail. Brass pole foot rail. 20 or so beers on tap and and equal number of bottled beers. Bar back is brick and dominated by the tvs.  Food is very average.  One loud bitch that I wish I could muzzle. She was just having fun, but damn, the entire bar knew how much fun she was having (""Frank, I know that you had an awesome time. I think the entire town knows you had an awesome time""). Along the north wall are many, many high tables, with more in the center about halfway to the back. Two large elevated booths on each side in the rear.  Crowd is a mixed bag, but overall pretty laid back and friendly.  As far as I can tell, all seem tired of the fat laughing bitch having way too much fun (she is sitting in the center and no one is near her aside from two friends).  In fact, I'm trying to hurry and finish my beer to get out of here (yes, I think she is a regular).  Not so much a shot girl bar, but definitely a jagermeister on-the-counter bar.  Daltons takes it a step further by also having a patron tequila distribution machine on the bar (not the back bar, but the bar-bar next to the beer taps).  Probably a good place to watch the game, but otherwise is very loud, pop music playing, people high five-ing.On other nights with more friends, Dalton's is still loud, but much more fun.  So, a good place to go with friends, not so much when alone.",2,,

154,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,4.0,6/8/2010,"If it weren't for the midtown prices (which you have to expect), I'd give this place 5-stars!I'm not a huge sports bar person but have always had a great time & excellent service at Daltons.  They have a large selection of beers, two of which that choose as the $4 beer specials for the month.  They also choose two liquors for $5 shot specials each month.  If you stick to the drink specials, you'll balance the food prices.  Either way, it's happy hour all the time at Daltons!Last time I went there I split this ginormous appetizer sampler - which was so huge it had to be served on two oversized plates - with 3 other people...and it was more then enough!  We got two hot dogs, one each of their beef & turkey burger sliders, chicken wings, chicken fingers, and spinach artichoke dip with chips.When we ordered I thought $30 was a super inflated price...but when it arrived I could see it would be worth every midtown-penny!  All portions were generously sized.  With the exception of having to cut the hotdogs & sliders in half, we were able to go back for second tastings on everything else.  This was an awesome change from the usual ""everyone gets one bite of each thing and then remains hungry"" midtown app sampler experience.  And, even though we arrived at 1:30 am on a Sunday late-night, everything was made fresh!  Nothing sat waiting to be reheated for late night folk.The bartender was super accommodating, never judging us for only ordering drink specials and never rushing us out of the bar, even though we sat there forever sipping and talking.The ambiance is nice, the seating is comfortable, and they have the tables and stools arranged just right in order to pack in the peops but give everyone space.This is really one of the best spots in the area of midtown for service & quality.  I'll keep going back time after time and will never complain about the walk to 9th ave!",,,

156,Greg K.,"New York, NY",4,3,0,1.0,5/10/2013,I've been previously and found it unobjectionable and the staff friendly. However this time I felt absolutely swindled. They provided a draft list sans prices. I assumed based on previous experience that most beers would be $6-$8. When the bill came it turned out beers that aren't that especially rare (Flying Dog Raging Bitch. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA) were $12 and $10 respectively. That is financial entrapment and some shady garbage. I will never come here again and neither should any self respecting human being. For shame,1,6,

Updated review","OK, so an update from my 4/25/11 review...There is new direction at the helm of this classic, neighborhood watering hole and it shows. The addition of several new tap offerings (Anchor Steam, Abita Purple Haze, Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold, Shiner Bock....among others) and exception menu additions and revised presentations, a DJ on Friday and Saturday and the return of Karaoke Madness on Sunday and Thursday and a hint of a possible Karaoke competition. All this in concert with what the place already had going for it STAFF, SPORTS and SERVICE, and I now must speak with my banker who has become worried. The FRIED CHICKEN is the TRUTH! The new direction is a testament to what good can come from good decision making and an ownership with care, concern and vision.",2,,

164,Michael M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,16,11,1.0,11/18/2012,"If I could put Zero stars I would be.Up until last night I would have given it three to four stars.I have been going to this bar for several years. The chicken wings and five dollar patron shots have kept me coming back. The place is a regular place. Better than average amount of tvs for watching sports, lively music that makes it feel like a party, comfortable seating, and good attention from the bartender. The bartender even remembered me, which makes last night all the more unforgivable.I went there to meet friends to celebrate my fiancé's birthday. I got there early and opened a tab on which I bought chicken wings patron and guiness. When I closed my tab at the end of the night there were triple the amount of items; things I did not order.I told the woman bartender ( who claimed to have worked there for three years) the issue. She said NONE of my friends paid for their drinks and that they put it all on my tab. She said,"" no money or cards had crossed the bar"" besides mine.There are a couple problems with this. First and foremost YOU DO NOT PUT ITEMS ON A TAB UNLESS THEY TELL YOU TO, or I have said I was paying for the group. That is the most unethical practice I have ever witnessed in NYC ever. It does not matter if it is a big group of people and (hypothetically) if some of them did not pay their entire bill. You do not stick all the items, which, you as a bartender, failed to have them pay for on the only card you have open left behind the bar. I never indicated that I was paying for anything that I did not order, nor did anyone in my group ever order something and tell her to put it on my tab.Which brings me to the second issue; accusing my friends of being liars and cheats. Since obviously there was no error on the bartenders part ( whom might I add was doing shots with the group next to us), she accused all of my friends of sticking me with an odd amount of drinks ( only one of several different beers). My friends paid mostly in cash and they ordered many drinks. WHY WOULD ONLY A TINY AMOUNT APPEAR ON MY TAB, and not even close to there complete orders?!?! Since they were not there it was easy for her to insult their and my integrity. Not acceptable. She proceeded to talk over me, raise her voice, and insist that my closest friends whom I frequented bars with for over the past five years and have never once left me with a bill, were liars and at fault. Only after I blew every whole in her weak statements wide open, did she start to complain about giving me buy backs ( which I had previously received none after being there for several hours).Lastly, the bartender who has served me every time beforehand and whom I have always tipped more than 20%, never lifted a hand to help understand or resolve the situation. The bartender who I was dealing with even expressed his (supposed) nasty comments about the situation to pin him as the bad guy and distance herself from the egregious error. Years of loyal patronage are treated this way at Dalton's.This is the worlds longest review so I'm ending it. In short I paid all that they had wrongfully charged me, and left without raising more of a commotion (which no one at the bar even noticed) than I already had. No one insults my integrity nor my esteemed friends. Not over money.I hope they enjoy the extra 70 dollars because that is the last they will ever receive from me or ANYONE that I know.",6,2,

Large beer selection as well. The food is fantastic for pub food. I've tried the truffle fries (a must try!), the chicken quesadilla and chicken tenders. All great in my opinion.

174,Rachael M.,"CANAL STREET, NY",4,15,0,1.0,3/18/2012,"If you are thinking about going to Daltons, stop. Just don't. Please. This place should go out of business as the management are literally the rudest people I have ever encountered. My friends and I went to Daltons yesterday because we were looking for a place to watch the NCAA games and celebrate St Paddy's day. It was a crappy weird location (43rd and 9th- ugh) but it fit the bill and we scored a table- AND they had a foursquare special that you get 25 cent wings and $4 bud lights and Yuenglings during the march madness tourney.  Also, they had $5 shots all day all night. Sweet! So, we order a round of these shots, and the manager, Shawn, comes over and tells us there are no $5 specials today (we are literally sitting underneath the sign that says ""$5 Shots, All Day, All Night!).  He then proceeds to cross off the sign that listed this. We said ""uh, buddy, cant really do that"" (In a much more professional way of course) He offered to buy us a round (which was nice) but scolded us that he should not be doing this, and the sign should not have been up.  Shawn- if you manage the bar- make sure specials you are ""not running"" are not advertised before you open! Don't be rude to your customers because you don't know how to run a bar.  Moving on...Many games and many hours pass and I pull Shawn over to tell him we will be asking for our check but have the foursquare special, and show it to him. He says ""There are no specials on St Paddy's Day. Everyone knows that""  Well, actually sir, there are...and your bar is participating in one. And then he said ""Well, our PR person should not have done that"" and then...he WALKED AWAY. I was stunned. When our waitress came over I asked for the check and told her the situation, she said she would see what she could do. She then brought over another manager, also named Shawn and just as unpleasant, to ""help"". He says ""What seems to be the problem here?""- as if he is in law enforcement.   I explained the situation to him and he cut me off and said ""look, we don't do specials on St Paddy's day"" I tried to explain that no exclusions were listed in their ADVERTISED special, and honestly we have been in his bar all day and he is being pretty rude to us. Then...he also WALKED AWAY in the middle of my sentence. I literally have never experienced people so rude in my life- and they are the management of this place. Our waitress, Sarah, was sweet and just caught in the middle. I felt bad for her (Sarah- Quit that miserable place!!) It gets WORSE, believe it or not. So Sarah brings over the bill and said she was able to get us a discount on some of the bud lights.  She didn't mention the Yuenglings but at this point I just want to get the hell out of there and pay money to drink anywhere else.  The bill was $683 and they automatically added $195 in tip. Wait a minute....in what weird world is that 18%?? So we do some math and realize the ""discount"" they gave us they then added back onto the tip.  At this point I am looking around for cameras and Ashton Kutcher because I swear we must be on some new ""real people can get Punk'd too!"" episode or something. Sadly, we were not being Punk'd, this was real ish!In summary: go to Daltons if you like going to crappy locations, being talked down to, getting ripped off, eating disgusting food, and contributing to the success of a douchebag.  I will take myself (and my check-ins) elsewhere!!",3,,

Daltons itself appears to be a sports bar that transforms into a karaoke club on Thursdays and Sundays.  The emcee was an extremely talented performer that was enjoyable to watch and it seemed that the regulars that attended this karaoke go because of the overall quality.  It is more of a show than the typical watching drunk people belt out Don't Stop Believing.  The drinks were reasonably priced and the wait staff was attentive.   We only ordered the nachos and I was pretty unimpressed with them.  Overall it seemed like a fun bar.,,,

So back to one dollar tips. or exactly 15% if I ordered food.Place gets 3 stars because I like the music, I sing along (along with others in the bar), its girl friendly and guy friendly, they have karokee that is interesting lol and hilarious. Many tv'sThe prices are kind of ...outrageous if you dont realize how much it REALLY is. Like getting a bill for 40/50 bucks for three items and a drink or two.  The chicken fings are my fav and they cost about 8 or 9 maybe 10 dollars, I forget bc of brokeness  I havent been in a while.So very pricey for bar food, GRANTED it is pretty yummy for a bar. You'll be surprised. Always a seat open.",,,
197,Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",688,1833,7,5.0,1/22/2007,"Good place to stop by on a Saturday, early in the evening. It was pretty empty, we grabbed a seat at the bar. Bartender kicked ass, I got my standard Belvedere Tonic, 2 limes. He gave me some shit for the 2 limes bit, but then fished out the biggest pieces he could find, and even squeezed em in for me. Rock.We got some calamari and some spring rolls, nothing special, typical frozen about 10 years ago and then tossed in a deep fat fryer for a few mins. Good coating for the ole tum tum before a night of drinking though.Update: This is my home away from home now. I miss Ronan when I wander away for too long. Is it Ronan or Ronin? Who cares, he rules.  We will be back, over and over and over again!Update: It's Ronan, and Ashley kicks ass too. And Sean. Yeah, love this place.",2,,2
198,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,3.0,7/9/2007,"Nicer than your typical pub with outdoor seating and classy high booths/tables.  They have a large bar and wide selection of beers.  The menu has your standard bar food, but it's of better quality and they offer some more upscale cuisine (grilled salmon with veggies, for example) as well.  I had the grilled shrimp salad with lemon vinaigrette.  The shrimp were well-seasoned and grilled perfectly.  The dressing was sweet, but not too lemon-y.  I also tasted my friend's french fries, which I thought were greasy and could use more salt.  It seems like it would have a fun bar scene (it didn't when I went on a Sunday afternoon), and the food is decent.",1,,2
199,Jason C.,"New York, NY",15,147,0,2.0,8/23/2006,"A basic pub that's trying to take it a bit upscale (check out the semi-cool, semi-dentist office fabric on the benches in the back.)  Really, nothing special, except it's close to my house and, at least from the tables in the back, I can get some free WiFi.  If you're not a fan of lotsa flatscreens, or an occasional raucous group of pub-crawlers, you should probably stay away.  If you're looking for $7 beers, $10 burgers, and sports on TV, then its worth checking out, if you're in the neighborhood. Oh, and they've got a reasonably good selection of beers (~20 or so.)",1,,2
