0,Steve A.,"Hilliard, OH",852,1390,1959,5.0,10/18/2018,"The Candle Cafe is one of the world's best known vegetarian restaurants. It's been around a long time. The history actually goes back about 30 years. It has a best selling cookbook. The food is all vegan so there's no need to ask questions about that. It doesn't have that much room inside. It wasn't a problem because it wasn't that busy. There's so many places to eat around here that it must get overlooked. It's popular with vegetarians for sure, but it gets some who aren't. The inside is modern looking without being flashy. Everything on the menu is vegan, so you're good if you're looking for vegan choices. The food unfortunately is expensive though. It sucks because that limited my meal to just an entree with no cocktails and none of the cookies which looked good. I had the Cajun Seitan Sandwich with a side of fries. This is about $16 so it's not cheap but it's good and expertly made. Everything on the menu sounded good. Too bad pretty much everything on the menu was costly. Try something here, just an entree.",1,1,1
1,Rose K.,"New York, NY",397,452,591,5.0,10/17/2018,"After a particularly stunning experience at the upscale location of Candle Cafe, I have been waiting with bated breath to try The Cafe version. As you know, I'm on my never-ending quest to try all the vegan offerings in New York City, and this is one of the must-try staples.It was the middle of a weekday, around 3pm, and The Candle Cafe East was on my way back to work. I treated myself to a little break. There is a happy hour from 3-7pm on weekdays but it's limited to drinks, not food. The cafe still manages to be bustling in the dead of the afternoon. I love that there is a countertop for coffee or full-service food if you're sitting alone. They had no problems with me seating myself at the back- there are outlets available, which is so nice if you need to recharge in more than one way, if you catch my drift. My server was direct and honest about answering my questions -- in his opinion, of course (such as: is it worth it to get the mac and cheese as a side? no. is it worth it to get the carrot cake? yes) and I ended up ordering the Mexican Lasagna. I liked that I could trust the server to give me a real opinion on what to order. It's a beautiful slice of 100% vegan lasagna, laden with violife cheese and sour cream. The texture was startlingly perfect. I loved the way the cauliflower ""chorizo"" and black beans meshed. The bright crisp greens (I think they are collard greens?) were a perfect way to make this meal feel healthy. The service was busy and matter-of-fact: there was rushing around, but in a way that made you feel taken care of, but not hovered-over. My water glass was always refilled at the proper time. I passed on getting the highly-recommended carrot cake, only because I polished off the entire lasagna like it was my life's business. My phone, spirit, and energy recharged, I ambled my way back out into NYC feeling like I could conquer anything. Thank you for a wonderful vegan experience. I can't wait to come back!",,,
2,Donald F.,"Woodinville, WA",16,23,0,4.0,9/30/2018,"Great vegan cafe with a good selection of food in different styles. I enjoyed some excellent juice and a seitan burger which had a great balance of crispiness, substance and flavour.Staff here are great, and I can see why. When I was having lunch one of the senior staff was mentoring a new member, quite openly during service. His attention to detail and his emphasis on ensuring happy customers was very clear. I learned a lot just listening to him!",,,
3,Molly N.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",12,84,81,5.0,7/9/2018,"Love the freedom for vegans to order anything and everything on the menu here, the variety they have and how satisfying everything is. The kale caesar is creamy and cheesy enough to qualify as comfort food, complete with massaged kale, bright cherry tomatoes, crunchy polenta croutons, briny fried capers, cashew parm and here with grilled tempeh.The southwestern breakfast empanada with tofu scramble, tempeh chorizo, sautéed veggies and chipotle mayo is a crispy, indulgent treat too.Mmmmm can't wait to go back and try everything else. Grateful for all of the Candle restaurants!",1,,
4,Jyotsna N.,"New York, NY",12,27,3,4.0,11/15/2018,"Limited choice, tasty vegan place. The service was great and their cauliflower dishes were well made. I am not a big fan of seitan, here or anywhere. Overall cute place with good service to hangout with your partner for lunch or dinner.",,,
5,David C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,3,1.0,9/20/2018,"I had the impossible burger. The potato fries was soggy and dirty. The bun on the burger was also soggy. The potato fries still had soil in it (signs of poor food safety training. avoid especially if you're elderly or have children with you). Soggy fries and soggy burger bun definitely isn't worth $17.42. If I was going to eat crappy food, I might as well bring food from home for a fraction of the cost.Also, the service is horrible. I arrived at their location and ordered the beyond burger to take out. It wasn't available and I was recommended the impossible burger. I didn't know what it was, but I didn't feel like asking for a menu and spend time looking through it so I just accepted it. After ordering and paying, I asked the waiter ""Can I wait outside"", she said sure. After waiting 45 minutes on the bench in the front of their restaurant, I finally gave up and was prepared to tell them that I have things to do and my lunch break is over. I went in and the same waiter tells me that she thought I left. It made me so upset. I explained to her that I told her I was going to wait outside. She said nothing and just handed my food over. So, the rest of my day is ruined because I hadn't ate anything the whole day and I finally receive my food at 3:22 PM, but it tasted really bad. Also, I was late to get back to work, because I had to eat an expensive soggy burger and soggy fries for my first meal of the day because it was all I had.",2,,
6,Caitlyn C.,"New York, NY",298,197,318,4.0,4/2/2018,"Candle cafe is a casual but delicious vegan spot on the UES. Not everything on the menu is gluten free, but they have a good amount of options and even a separate GF menu to use. I ordered from their ""good food plate"" option. You get to choose 4 items and two sauces from a big list of foods. They really fill the plate up for this so if you're really hungry this is a great way to go! I loved both the bbq and red pepper turmeric sauces I tried. In addition to regular food, candle also has juice elixirs, smoothies, wines and beers and desserts. They've got a great amount of seating among the bar, high tops and low tables. The wait staff is really friendly and the food was served quite fast! Great for a delicious and quick bite.",,,
7,Lisa K.,"Queens, NY",175,77,28,3.0,3/13/2018,"A Gift Gone WrongIn summary: If you receive a gift card for Candle 79, READ THIS REVIEW CAREFULLY. That way, you will not experience the same unfortunate surprise that I did at the end of my meal. The food was delicious, but I only ate there because I had a gift card to use. Or so I thought. My previous service experiences are why I haven't returned for some time to the Candle 79 restaurants. Tonight's solvable issue now joins that experience list.Please note, Stephanie the GM on duty, was contacted for assistance with this issue. The details: I received this gift card as a Christmas gift from my brother. It came inside of a Candle 79 cookbook. That cookbook was on display at the front entrance of the restaurant as I entered - first picture. The OpenTable app wasn't allowing me to make a reservation, but I could see there was a 7:15 PM and 7:45 PM reservation open when I was online between 4 and 5 PM.I arrived at 7:45 PM, and the hostess asked if I had a reservation. I explained my OpenTable issue earlier. The hostess politely smiled and nodded, then told I needed to wait for a table. When I asked the wait time, she said she needed to check on tables turning over. I said OK, then walked over to the bar. It was open seating there, and you can order dinner there.I didn't know my friend had made a reservation, so thanks to him we were seated upon his arrival. We browsed the menu. We ordered sparkling water, two entrées, and a side of brussels sprouts. The Live Lasagna is the second picture. Absolutely delectable, I enjoyed every bite. I asked for the check, got it, and inserted my credit card and gift card. The server went to process the payment.He then returned, and dropped an unexpected bomb on us: they couldn't accept the gift card. When I asked why, he said each Candle 79 location has its own gift card, and they're unable to use the gift card. I asked for the manager on duty. I still don't know his name. He was very kind. I asked him if it was possible to call the other location, check the gift card balance, and work out a way to process the gift card. He called the restaurant, verified the gift card amount, but could not get the jam on duty, Stephanie, to approve a solution. I was now the owner of a $70 bill when I was expecting to only pay $20 plus tip. I was taking my friend to dinner, so of course I could not accept his money. I recently moved, money is tight, so I NEVER would have eaten here knowing I would need to pay for the full meal. The company website shows all three locations are under the same umbrella. Here's an excerpt from the Candle Café homepage:""All three locations feature (ie both Candle Cafés and Candle 79) four menu changes per year that coincide with the growing seasons for the fresh fruit, produce, herbs and other naturally delicious ingredients that go into our dishes.""Isn't Candle Cafe a location? Considering the service issues I experienced at my three previous dining experiences here, this was the best one to date. I hope your dining and service experiences are better than mine.",,1,

Updated review",The waiter is annoying again but the food is good and organic. Feel like limited option compared with the west side. Got sweet potato lasagna - not heavy and pretty good! Highly recommend. Salad portion is good and not boring too.,,,
9,Carmen E.,"New York, NY",165,39,43,2.0,10/20/2018,"I walked in to the Candle Cafe for lunch on a Saturday and I loved the friendly staff and the space.  I ordered the mushroom-seitan burger, the falafel  and from the kid's menu the pizza. The food greatly lacked in flavor and it was bland. The kid pizza was burnt and it looked like I'd been made out of pita bread.  The falafel was non existent, there were just about three small pieces at the bottom and the rest was one blop of salad.  The best part of the burger were the truffle fries although I felt no truffle on it.  There was also no sriracha aioli or onion rings.  While eating, I was baffled, couldn't understand why such a highly rated place was feeding me bland food, each individual component had just a tiny hint of flavor and the more you searched for it, the harder it was to truly detect it. It's like when you go to a hotel and you order something vegan and their final product shows they don't know how to blend flavors together.  Maybe I came on an off day and they were heavily focusing more on the brunch items on the menu.  However, this should not be an excuse to for each individual of food to lack in flavor.  Eating should be an experience of multidimensional layers of savoring the items that have been prepared.   Not sure if I want to give this place another try.  Overpriced items for bland food.  I can make these burgers at home.",,,
10,David K.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,2.0,11/10/2018,"Usually it is a really an enjoyable experience but not today - started with a dirty glass of water, then a cracked coffee mug leaking through the the crack. Asked for toast which took ages. Orange juice we got only after two reminders, sugar  not available- why? coffee served with no spoon and just to cap that- non functional pen with the check. Too bad- since the food is usually great.",,,
11,Melissa D.,"Islip, NY",91,575,156,4.0,9/30/2017,"Space: clean, airy, and bright. Good amount of seating with a small bar in the front. Staff: friendly and hipster-ish, as is the usual at vegan joints. Food: it's so nice to be at a place where allergies and food preferences are taken seriously. The juices and smoothies are great. I love the yogurt parfait for dessert- or lunch :) the soup specials are delicious and go great with their cornbread (sadly not gluten-free). The menu is limited if you can't have soy or wheat as your protein, which is why only 4 stars. Otherwise, the taste and quality are wonderful. I will definitely keep this in the rotation when I'm trying to be healthy.",,,
12,Hannah M.,"New York, NY",1,66,25,3.0,7/9/2018,"I feel awful only giving three stars to a vegan restaurant, but I was not impressed with the food and the prices. One thing I can say the service was wonderful. Our waiter was aware we weren't too thrilled with one of our meals and gave us a complimentary strawberry crumble dessert. I thought that was great service and showed integrity in a restaurant. I have been here before they renovated the location. I didn't feel the atmosphere had any personality and the chairs were very uncomfortable. The buffalo cauliflower was good but we got five small bites for over ten dollars. I don't mind spending money on good food but the dish was missing something. I had the seitan with kale and my friend ordered the fried chicken dish. I thought mine was tasty but we were not impressed with his. Overall I suggest candle 79 over this spot. I will come back to see how things may change for the better because i would  like to support vegan local spots.",,1,
13,Paige H.,"New York, NY",14,183,17,5.0,2/26/2018,"DROOLING!!!! Best vegan spot I've ever been to... the service was incredible, the appetizers were scrumptious, the elixir shots cleared my sinuses and made me feel like my cold would be gone within seconds (it was shortly after this dinner), and the entrees were hefty and delicious. My friend and I ordered two apps, two entrees, and two desserts (carrot cake was divine and the chocolate thing was SO yummy!), and we decided that we went overboard. We'll definitely be back!!",,,
14,Laurel F.,"New York, NY",351,254,539,4.0,5/30/2017,"Once again, I am not vegan, but this food makes you totally forget about meat & cheese! So yummy! I definitely recommend for a sit-down lunch spot. I came with my mom and we were seated right away. Only thing is that Candle Cafe is very small, so the seating is very tight, practically on top of each other. The wait staff is also very slow and a bit unorganized. Those were my only complaints. The food was amazing though! My mom and I split a few dishes. We got a large house salad ($12), buffalo cauliflower ($12), and fried avocado tacos ($15). All were fresh and delicious. The portions are a tad small, but for lunch it was perfect. I definitely recommend the tacos; they were super tasty! I am so glad I recently moved nearby, so I will definitely be back!",4,,2

20,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,4.0,5/8/2018,"A totally vegan, casual, fun restaurant with amazing food. If you have anyone with special food needs, this is the place to go. As a baseline, everything they serve is vegan, but they have an additional gluten free menu. They also offer so many delicious juices, cocktails, salads... it's a gem and I love seeing restaurants cater to specific food sensitivities or preferences. The vegan eggplant lasagna was amazing... we couldn't even tell it wasn't real cheese. The server was quirky, fun and very helpful and attentive. My only complaint would be the decor... for some place with so much charm in the menu and philosophy, there wasn't much that drew the eye, or made it a charming environment.",3,,1
21,Victor F.,"Queens, NY",230,10,18,1.0,5/15/2018,"The food was bland and very expensive. I'm vegan & I've had much better food and I can cook something up in very little time that tastes a lot better than this. I'm willing to pay top dollar for exquisite flavor but since quality of food was 2 stars and we ended up paying about $40 per person, this place deserves a 1-star unfortunately. Seems like I'm paying more for location. If you do end up going, I would go with a burger since it looks pretty good and the gluten free bread is actually tasty. It's not a full meal but it's a cool thing to try because the texture of the burger is unique. Not going back here though. I do not recommend. If you're gonna charge all that money, back it up with good food!!",2,1,

We ordered a smoothie and a main meal and HOLY MOLY, it was AMAZING.I got the burger and fries and ate it all in about 5 minutes.

It has a really strong umami taste and the fries were nice and crispy. I would come back for this gem. We also got the pancakes which were tasty but had a weird consistency - could have been a lot fluffier.  They were kinda hard to chew. Perhaps they need to add more baking soda to the recipe or attempt to use canned chickpea water -yep it's a thing! The staff are friendly and the place is very clean and charming.

Updated review","Ok! So, I've came back for dinner and lunch two more times on different days, since my first experience which on a Sunday afternoon, and I'm happy to say that it has been wonderful! The waiters and workers were different then the ones working before, they were very friendly and welcoming, and the service was great! Fast, professional, and very on top of everything. Both times we sat near the front, and the energy is a lot better than in the back where it's dense for me. All in all I love Candle Cafe! It's wonderful! The food is delicious, and I'm so happy that everyone has been nice and warm these last two times. Although I prefer going to Candle 79, candle Cafe is really laid back and sometimes that's preferred.      The Golden Vitality shot, was so good. It was the perfect pick me up after a long day and before dinner. Pure energy! Loved it     My husband can't get enough of their Steamed  Dumplings. I've had those all 3 times I've gone. They're excellent and I highly recommend.     I also tried the Cauliflower Bites, in BBQ sauce instead and it was amazing 5 stars! Loved it and I'll probably come here a lot the time just for that.The cauliflower was slightly cooked, nice and steamed, with a slight crunch! Mmmm     The Vegetable Nori Rolls are very good. However I didn't read that it had rice in it and thought it was just vegetables. I got confused with their crystal rolls which I wanted to try badly, haha, i didn't complain or return because that's not like me, So it's ok. They weren't mind blowing, like some of their other menu items, but if your craving Vegan Sushi I highly recommend it because it taste great..      The Tempeh Empanadas were to die for! I got the chance to try them and I so recommend these! They are Phenomenal! Flavors and textures were so so good my friends loved them too!!     The Fall Salad is delicious! So good I love all their cashew and Almond cheeses and sauces!  The flavors and textures we're wonderful.  I highly recommend! I was really satisfied with it, and I'll be having this again.      My Husband Tried The Seitan & Mushroom Burger and he loved loved loved it! He was so happy and I was too. This was his first Vegan burger. I highly recommend to anyone trying vegan food for the first time. I tried a bit of the patty and the mushroom sauce, and it was excellent! The bread looked really nice. I'm very happy about this, because it's opened him up even more to vegan food. The fries were amazing as well, I tried them and we both loved them. So yes 5 Star experiences. The Food was beautiful and delicious, and everyone was much nicer. Perfect!Thank you everyone! We love Candle Cafe :) Everyone must try!",1,,

31,Kim P.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",1,13,29,5.0,2/2/2018,"It's easy to find vegetarian restaurants in New York City, but every now and then you stumble upon a truly great one: Candle Cafe is one of those. I don't know how they do it, but their food-creativity is equally matched with the taste of their cuisine! I try to get something different every time I visit, but sometimes, I would just order the same thing that I ordered the last time. The restaurant is small but very welcoming, and there is usually a waiting period before one can get a seat but it is usually not that long. If you have a big group, or want to go some place that is more upscale, go to their sister restaurant that is just a few blocks away: Candle 79. The menu could be a little intimidating if you are not familiar with vegetarian/vegan food lingo. When in doubt, ask the waitstaff member for clarification. I used to order The Indian plate for lunch, but it doesn't seem like they have it anymore. Since their menu changes often, I highly recommend going a few times and trying different items. I have never been disappointed, and you are sure to find at least one dish that you will absolutely love! You can thank me later!",1,,

It's a bit small, so perhaps consider ordering one more appetizer.I had the Indian food entree, while my friend had the choose your own option where he customized a Cajun- like plate. Consider this, because I constantly was eyeing his plate especially the cornbread...Overall the food was very good and was filling, for the most part. It probably could have had a bit more taste perhaps with the play of more spices, or different food combinations but again it was very pleasant.

I'm not vegan, but recognize the cardiovascular health benefits of avoiding animal protein. I don't typically seek out vegan restaurants. Having said that, if you like vegetables and legumes, you won't be sacrificing flavor by eating here. I had a portobello mushroom sandwich and platter of four sides. I enjoyed it all. I'm glad they did the renovation, because I had avoided the cafe before due to its dowdy look. The redo works well. It's bright and well soundproofed. Tables are a bit closer together than is ideal.

38,Stephanie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,7,0,4.0,7/8/2018,"This is probably one of the most delicious tasting vegan food I've ever had. I got the mushroom seitan burger and it was amazing. Ambiance and staff were also great! Would definitely recommend this restaurant. My only issue... I was there with my toddler so I ordered him some PLAIN elbow pasta that was $8. Ok. I asked for a side side of steamed broccoli for him. The tiny plate cost $7. That's fine. I also ordered him some OJ. NINE DOLLARS!! That's $9!!! $9!!! Are you joking me?? For some juice? Is there gold in there? And they knew it was for my toddler Bc i asked them to water it down. The least they could have done was warn me his watered down OJ was going to be $9! End rant. I really loved the restaurant, I would just never go back with my toddler :)",,,
39,Amanda T.,"Bronx, NY",0,21,1,3.0,11/8/2017,"I came here twice in the past 2-3 weeks. I think overall it was okay. The service was good but the lack of flavor at $20+ for an entree is not worth it. Especially with all the vegan restaurants NYC has to offer. This wasn't my favorite.I tried the chorizo empanadas. Unfortunately, I did not taste the tempeh whatsoever. The center of the empanadas were soggy because they're inconveniently placed over black beans. The sautéed kale was unseasoned. I did however enjoy the pickled onions. Still, I don't think the dish is worth $20.The southern plate was better. The texture of the fried seitan was great but I was a little disappointed with the garlic mash. They could've been a bit more creamy and flavorful.Lastly, we created our own dish where I tasted the mac and cheese and that was a winner for me! Creamy and delicious just like the real deal.",2,,

41,Linan C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,95,69,3.0,1/6/2018,"Went to Candle Cafe after its sister restaurant Candle 79 was too long a wait; this is supposedly the more affordable of the two while offering similar vegan options. The Candle restaurants are very well-known for their vegan food and I've been wanting to try one for a long time. We ordered the mezze platter for starter, and empanadas and lasagna as entrees. Sadly, the mezze platter was the only thing worth praising that night; the empanadas were extremely oily, making the bed of kale underneath taste like it had been soaked in oil, and there was a lot of dough and very little filling. The lasagna was layers of tofu put together with little flavor. Compared to the meal we had just days ago at Blossom on Columbus, Candle Cafe pales far in comparison. On top of the mediocre food, our service was extremely slow and the waiter was nowhere to be found most of the night.",,,

I can't eat dairy, and the quesadilla was not only super filling, but tasted SO much like cheese that I was scared it actually was! Super authentic, even my dairy-loving boyfriend couldn't stop eating it. However, ordered it again a few months later and it has been completely different both times -- barely any cheese flavor, super bland, and has a weird cinnamon taste now which is really odd... not to mention we only received half the portion.

Their juices were great and it was awesome to sit at the bar and watch them make it. The size is pretty reasonable and one juice could reasonably serve as a meal. I was starving when I went so I also got the jackfruit burger which was spicy, sloppy, and scrumptious. I never expected to get such a massive burger at a cute little cafe but there it was. I loved the burger and would go back and eat it in a heart beat. Since we were sitting at the bar, we were able to converse with the super friendly staff.

53,Amanda R.,"New York, NY",3,28,0,3.0,10/2/2018,"It pains me to leave a low rating for a restaurant I used to love for nearly 20 years, but between the inconsistency of the food (especially the juices) and the dozens of better vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants in the city, Candle Cafe is mediocre at best. Two days in a row, I ordered a very simple green juice, ""Green Goddess,"" and both times ingredients were clearly missing, the juice differed greatly in color from day to day, tasted vile, and so I poured $18 of juice down the sink. I'm not new to juicing or to the specific juice that I ordered. I know what it should taste like. Because I ordered delivery and because of how defensive and difficult management can be when alerted to staff errors (I learned this the hard way a few years ago), I didn't waste time ""complaining."" Word to the wise: this place is okay if you live nearby. If you're traveling from out of town, do yourself a favor and try a different vegan restaurant. Or go to Candle79 or Candle Cafe West. Both of those restaurants are substantially better than this one. There is also nothing too exciting or unique on the menu here. This was not the case years ago, when this was one of the very few options in town. I wish I could write a more positive review but I'm not sure how many more chances I can give this restaurant to get simple things right.",1,,

The pie was so smooth and full of dark chocolate flavor.  I had the ginger latte made with almond milk, I thought it would have espresso in it but it was fresh go get and milk and very refreshing!

We really enjoyed the mashed potatoes and collard greens, but the fried seitan 'chikn' it came with was completely unseasoned, and I do mean completely. The seitan AND the breading had nary a hint of salt, pepper, paprika, or any kind of herb. I make seitan at home frequently and it HAS to be seasoned to be edible. Thankfully, we asked for extra gravy (which was delicious) which helped to add flavor to the meal. The Mexican bowl tasted good, as did the sweet potato lasagna. The smoothies we got however, were again, nothing special. Three stars in all because service was good and fast, and the food was mostly good. Just not quite as delicious as we've become accustomed to in many of the vegan restaurants in Cali.",,,

Updated review","I love vegetables. I fully believe that you can make a perfectly delicious meal with kale, sweet potatoes, and quinoa, and be done (not to say I don't also LOVE me some steak, either!). This was the perfect little light brunch to start a healthy weekend. The cafe wasn't crowded, service was perfect, and the ingredients fresh. The brunch menu is pretty limited and the prices a little steep, but what can you expect from a vegan place? My friend and I ordered a French toast and southwestern crepe, as well as two juices between the two of us. We were seated promptly at noon when we arrived, as there was no wait time. My crepe was pretty disappointing--not a huge fan of the flavors and the overpowering mushroom taste, but I did love the French toast. Something about it just seemed less guilty to eat--it was a bit more chewy and less sweet than regular French toast, but I like my desserts less sweet. I ordered a tutti fruti smoothie, which was very delicious and apparently healthy (although I definitely could've just made one myself), but my friend's flu and cold juice tasted overwhelmingly of ginger, even though she told the waiter to lessen ginger because she can't stand the taste. I'm not in a food coma, which is great, and my tummy thanked me for it! Not a bad way to start a healthy weekend!",,,

I'm so happy I finally ate here -- the food was amazing and the staff was honestly what put the experience over the top. I had the seitan mushroom burger for lunch -- cashew mozzarella was unbelievable. Very messy meal but so worth having to be extra careful while I ate it. The staff and servers have great energy, are friendly and so personable. Thank you Candle Cafe!",1,1,1
59,Sara B.,"Bronx, NY",0,21,0,1.0,10/17/2018,"Horrible! Our evening began when we walked into a sister restaurant of the lovely Candle Cafe on the UWS. It's pricey there, but you get interesting, creative vegan foods in a nice atmosphere with great service. At this place, the tables and chairs are uncomfortably close and it looks more like a diner. But we went in anyway. The menu is similar and the prices are just as high. So we sat down and our server came over but then couldn't take our order because her iPad was down. She returned within a couple of minutes and we ordered. My son ordered a beer which arrived but with no glass ""We don't have any glasses,"" they said. Seriously??! A restaurant with no glasses? Then they served our appetizer (buffalo cauliflower) which was overly oily. Then came out avocado salad, only they left out one ingredient... avocado! We told another server (ours didn't come back to our table except to give us the salad back. She never asked how things were, never refilled our water glasses, etc.) The other woman said that we were given the wrong salad and took it away. Our original server came back with the sale that had been taken and said, ""Oh, they just forgot the avocado, I'll get you some."" We had to wait for that too. Then came the main dish which was pretty oily, lukewarm and tasteless, and the fries were soggy. Sad because the dish happens to be a favorite of mine at Candle on the UWS. For a last awful touch, we were swarmed by mosquitoes. I said something to a server passing our table and he said, ""Yeah, we're having a problem with bugs."" EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE! Huge waste of money and time. Eating out is supposed to be an experience where you feel taken care of. This was the opposite.",,,
60,Rosa D.,"Waukegan, IL",0,4,3,4.0,11/22/2017,Service was fast. We only had quesadillas. Good portion size. A lot of flavor. Loved the salsa on the side. Recommend the Natural Soda ginger ale.,,,
61,Latef X.,"New York, NY",36,551,620,3.0,3/26/2017,"Cajun seitan sandwich was good, but the protein patty should have been crispier and more textured. The whole sandwich texture wise was a little too soft and not diversified. If it had a raw, fresh component to it, it would have been much better -- maybe a slaw or something. The price tag is steep for a sandwich and potato wedges at $17.50 including tax. Add tip on there and you're at $20+ for a decent but not mind blowing sandwich. I guess the quality of ingredients are good and organic junkies can be fed peacefully here. Dunno, I'm used to super fresh veggies for cheap being from California.The staff are super nice and helpful here. Black guy working the counter was like the nicest, genuinely friendly, smiley worker ever. :) However, it took over 25 minutes to get a take-out order, so they don't hustle.Ambiance is very casual and hipster-diner like. They have a bar area in the front but the whole place is kinda cramped. Welcome to NYC.",,,

I've been vegan for almost 4 years and I've never been to this restaurant.The service was good. I was greeted right away. I couldn't decide if I wanted to sit at the bar or a table. It was a little crowded, so I thought the bar would be a better option. It was not. I don't recommend sitting there unless you can deal with call-in orders, the juicer, and take-out orders. I couldn't. The wait staff was great about reseating me. I ordered a Tipsy Palmer cocktail. The flavor balance was perfect; nice mix of tea and sake. The server made some recommendations.

Finally I got a group of friends who were adventurous plus a few that were vegetarian, and I am so glad that we came here. If all vegan food tasted this good, I would have no qualms becoming a vegan. We all ordered salad or their burgers, and from what I was told, their salads are amazing! I had the avocado BLT and it tasted so good I didn't even care that there wasn't any real bacon in it. I tried the burgers as well, and the seitan was great! I still don't really know what seitan was but it was a really good imitation of meat.Services was great, the waiter we had was really friendly and pretty much gave us all of our recommendations for food and none of us were disappointed. The ambience is also lovely, I loved the interior decor as it was very beautiful and classy. I had also thought it would be expensive but it wasn't! Not by any means cheap, but pretty good for high quality vegan food, or so I imagine but I wouldn't really know since I have no point of comparison at all.

Updated review","I've been coming to The Candle Cafe since it's inception some 20 plus years ago. I loved it up until this past year. The service is always great. What I no longer find appealing about the restaurant are the ""up charges"" for EVERYTHING. You cannot simply have any more dressing without a charge never mind substitutions. Also, I think they need to get with 2018 and have some options other than soy. When you are a vegan establishment it should be understood that many people do not enjoy soy. There's a lot of really good competitors out there now, so pleasing the customers should be a priority.",,,
74,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,10/27/2015,"First things first: I'm an omnivore.My vegetarian friend and I came here on a Monday night after hearing good things. I was a bit apprehensive though because I can't say I've had many positive experiences with vegan foods. Plus, it seems my fellow Yelpers are completely split into two camps: those who think heaven and earth of Candle Cafe, and those who find the food bland and boring. Who to believe??Upon walking in, you know immediately you're in a healthy place; the smell of fresh produce (read: freshly-mowed lawn) from their juice bar is strong. The smells from neighboring tables' plates, however, were intoxicating. I was excited! At the waiter's suggestion, we had the chimichurri skewer appetizer, I had the seitan enchilada, and my friend had the vegetable and lentil cake. Delicious flavors highlighted the ingredients in each of the dishes, and I really found everything to be tasty. Despite some of the names of the ingredients (like, seitan chorizo), the meat-like ingredients tasted NOTHING like meat. But don't let that turn you off, meat-eaters, because the flavors are still yummy.So in the Yelp debate over the food at Candle Cafe, here's my final verdict: the food is good. Omnivores, adjust your expectations and keep an open mind, and you shall not be disappointed.",3,1,
75,Angela L.,"New York, NY",171,245,10,1.0,9/22/2016,"Over the last ten years this place has been in a state of decline. They quit carrying the Peanut Butter Bomb and their carrot cake is a completely different, bland recipe. They have the worst vegan mac n cheese I've ever had. There's a $5 delivery fee (but they won't tell you when placing your order) so keep an eye out for that before tipping. And the worst is this new menu. Tonight we ordered their enchiladas and the cajun seitan sandwich. Their new chili aioli is basically flavorless with no heat, and they forgot to put the grilled onions on the sandwich. I remember when their aioli was so thick and delicious. Now it just melts into the bread and you can't even taste it. The enchiladas were neither spicy nor even remotely flavorful. It's such a shame because about ten years ago this place was THE GREATEST. Now I can definitely say it's the most mediocre vegan restaurant I know. If you have to dine here, stick to the healthy options such as steamed veggies. No point in wasting calories on fried food with no flavor.

Plates 20 dollars and up. Food was great though, I got the Cajun sandwich which wasnt spicy at all. Delicious though,the service was good too. They also have a bar at the entrance which was nice but pricey. I woild go back.",,,

Updated review","Overpriced dishes with cheap ingredients.   $20 Mexican bowl full of only chips and hard to eat cheap roman lettuce was not ideal.   $7 lentil soup with a half slice of thin bread that cost 50cents to make was nothing special either.    The only decent thing was free ice tea refills.... but they failed to put more ice in the glass.  On a hot day, ice drinks is a must, even more when the  menu says ""refreshing drinks"".       No rice or beans in the bowl either......  I think the kitchen needs to be supervised better.  It was basically Nachos.",,,
86,Alana I.,"Manhattan, NY",348,4,0,5.0,3/19/2018,"Food was incredible, go for the Seitan Mushroom Burger!!! Service was great. A little on the pricey side for something advertised as casual dining, but the quality was definitely all there to prove it's value. Can't wait to come back!",,,
87,Gabrielle R.,"Brooklyn, NY",288,1,0,1.0,3/3/2018,"Wow, did this place ever go down the drain. This was one of the best vegan spots in the city. In the handful of times  I have eaten here recently, the service has been awful, the food, undercooked, and the heat has been broken on some of the coldest days of the year. I paid $50 plus tip for a smoothie, main, and dessert, which tasted like cardboard. What a rip off. Needs new management or will end up closing regardless. What a disappointment!!!!",,,
88,Tanvi P.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,51,15,2.0,7/4/2017,"We went for dinner after a tiring evening at Central Park. Although, this place is vegetarian friendly, portion size is a joke! We spent $35+ tips for a cafe kind of food and we were hungry again! Had to order food from another restaurant to fill our hunger...Also, the food items were quite expensive. I'd rather go to chipotle or subway for cafe kind of food. Self service and inexpensive with good portion size.",,,

91,Linda S.,"New York, NY",0,80,5,2.0,1/7/2018,"Small, lively restaurant.  The coffee machine was broken, which is sad on a Sunday morning. I ordered ""Lox Bagel"".  The ""lox"" tasted good. The bagel itself was too crumbly. When I picked it up to bite into it, it started to break apart. There were many waiters, but the food didn't appear all that quickly, so perhaps they need more people in the kitchen and fewer on the floor.  The host was very friendly. No problems with this restaurant, but no particular reason to return.",,,
92,Fariha K.,"Bronx, NY",86,147,76,1.0,10/22/2015,"I don't know what people find so amazing about this place. Besides the customer service, the food was super bland and overpriced. Appetizer: Flatbread pizza: 13$ was way too much for the size of the pizza. It wasn't bad in terms of taste but it was probably equivalent to a small Pizza Hut pizza that's served for half the price. I don't think it's even as big as a small pizza from Pizza Hut to be honest.Entree:Cajun Seitan: 17$. Flavorless, bland, I truthfully do not know what was so Cajun about this sandwich. It was terrible, even the fries were not properly seasoned. Sweet Potato bbq sandwich: 16$. Better than the Cajun seitan but still bland in flavor and the side of fries were not seasoned. Would pick this over the Cajun seitan any day though. Dessert:Carrot Cake: okay, not bad but not great either. The texture of the cake seemed off to me, it wasn't moist but crumbly which I did not enjoy. Total meal cost: 70$ for nothing. Terrible food and a waste of money. If you truly want to try awesome vegan food that is affordable, go to Champs on Williamsburg. Best vegan spot in the city and definitely not as terrible as this place. This visit was legit upsetting and disappointing all at once, I will NOT be coming back.",,,
93,Jenna S.,"Atlanta, GA",13,35,17,4.0,12/10/2017,"Now let me say I'm definitely not a vegetarian/vegan so I tend to stay far away from these kinds of restaurants. This place is delicious!! First off that choco-date smoothie is amazing, so good. I could have had 3 more of those. The sushi was tender and also incredible. The dips, the bowls of veggies, everything was fantastic. The only exception was the pickled vegetables dish which was just jalapeños and some pickled white onion and carrot! Was not good. Also the menu is set haphazardly, which made for ordering harder than it should be. But overall, really great!",,,
94,Brittany J.,"Naugatuck, CT",6,33,44,4.0,11/13/2017,"4 stars is for the service and the apps. The young lady was very attentive, knowledgeable and funny. We started with the quesadilla and fried dumplings which were absolutely delicious and left us in high anticipation for our entrees. Don't forget to order a side of gauc with the quesadilla, so tasty. Once we received our entrees we were met with disappointment. I had the southern plate with a side of mac n cheese and my friend had the mushroom burger. The collard greens lacked flavor as well as the Mac n cheese. It tasted like the water it was boiled in with a pinch of shredded cheese thrown in. Cornbread and fried seitan were yummy. I had a bite of my friend's burger which was good. I loved the fries and with their ketchup. For the dessert we ordered the s'more brownie but it was dry, extremely dry. The side of coconut ice cream was a nice touch but still didn't help the dry brownie. All and all it was a great experience. Would love to go back to try other things on the menu which they change often so I'll be back",,,

Updated review","Great vegan/vegetarian food! I'm not a big fan of vegan food, but my mom is a vegan so I took her there and she adored it. Generous portions and a ton of options for vegans and vegetarians alike. Again, not super big on that kind of food but I could tell it was good for what it was. I'll definitely be bringing my mother back here!",,,
96,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",357,144,37,4.0,8/28/2016,"I walked past Candle Cafe today and noticed that they're temporarily closed for renovations during the month of August (they reopen on September 1st). It made me think about how much I'm looking forward to coming back, and it also served as a reminder to write this review!Inside, the cafe is casual and intimate, but still gives the impression of a ""nice"" restaurant. There isn't a lot of room for groups - it's more of a place for date night or catching up with a friend or two. It gets pretty crowded in the early evening, but the staff doesn't try to rush you out the door.The menu excels at enhancing the usual vegetarian standbys, like seitan and tempeh, as well as simulating meals that traditionally contain meat, evidenced by dishes such as ""spaghetti and wheatballs.""It was difficult to pick just one of these options, but the Cajun seitan sandwich grabbed my attention that night. Cajun-crusted seitan on toasted focaccia, topped with steamed greens, caramelized onions, avocado, and ancho-chili aioli, this sandwich had a little bit of everything. The smooth texture of the avocado was an unexpected component, deviating from what you'd normally consider to be Cajun cuisine. The sweet potato fries could have been slightly crispier, though this didn't detract too much from the meal overall.My boyfriend enjoyed his chipotle black bean burger, but wished that it had been served on a real burger bun, rather than whole wheat flatbread (it was basically one of those sandwich thins). He particularly liked the truffle fries he got on the side.I'll definitely be making future trips to Candle Cafe, and especially can't wait to try their enticing vegan brunch!",,,

99,Taylor G.,"Paris, France",83,10,0,1.0,12/6/2017,"I've eaten here twice now, the second time only because a friend was in town. The food tastes like it's been sitting in the freezer for two months, bland and ordinary. Won't be back.",,,

101,Erika G.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,19,8,3.0,6/16/2017,"We ate here two years ago when in NY and had a fantastic experience which is why we returned tonight. Unfortunately our experience tonight was sub par. We had reservations at 6. Numerous people came in after us, ate and left and we were still waiting on food. The whole experience took FOREVER. We didn't leave until almost 8:00 and we have two little ones. I blame the kitchen. It's like they forgot about us. My salad was mostly radicchio - not much lettuce although the basil hempseed dressing was good. The tempeh bacon BLT was bland. Both orders of Mexican lasagna came out luke warm and were so incredibly spicy it masked any other flavor profile going on. They forgot to make my sons grilled cheese. The only redeeming value was the limonade, lemon ginger tea and dessert - those were delicious. However, the whole experience was certainly not worth $322.00 and there wasn't an apology for the wait. I am trained in plant based cooking and desserts and I didn't feel like the food was memorable in any way. Another turnoff was waiting on the bathroom for almost ten minutes only to see one of the cooks come out, clearly using bathroom time to get on his cell phone. Is that why I waited so long for my food!? I will say that the staff were very nice and bartender even pitched in to take our dessert order. We are just so incredibly disappointed in this experience. When your in town for only a short time, you want ever vegan meal to be awesome. Sadly, that didn't happen tonight.",,,

103,Noam M.,"Queens, NY",1,51,25,2.0,2/21/2016,"I was so disappointed! I remember being amazed at the food when I first moved to New York in 2003. The menu has changed a lot, and so apparently has the quality.The Chef's Pasta was tasteless. The ""Bolognese"" sauce was barely existent. It tasted, not like restaurant food, but like something I'd whip up at home, someone like me with no cooking skills.The pumpkin seitan entree was bland. The seitan had no taste, relying entirely on the sauce on top. Add the sauce was only ok. It came with unflavored quinoa and bitter rabe.The curry lentil cake, though presented beautifully, was an unremarkable patty of vegetables mushed together, like a not-so-good veggie burger without the bun. Underneath it was some roasted vegetables, which were adequate, and that bitter rabe.The seitan chimichuri appetizer was good. That was the one highlight. But at these prices ($12 appetizer, $22 entree) I expect much better food. This meal made me sad.",3,,1

The portobello steak entree was good, but too much portobello... feel like I paid 20+ dollars for a dish that was 75% mushroom... my bf's dish was really good, but it was a Special and I forgot what it was called.",,,

When a friend of mine suggested Candle Cafe for dinner, I was sold. I had looked at the menu online and was blown away by the options and the decent beer/wine/cocktail list. I arrived a bit before my friend and the manager seemed to have an issue with seating me 2 minutes before my friend arrived. I knocked off a star solely for that.Our waiter was very nice. There were specials for the evening, including an Indian dish with tofu instead of chicken. I opted for the Mexican lasagna. If you had blindfolded me and asked if there was real cheese, I would have said yes. The lasagna was flavorful and perfect, also paired with a side of steamed kale. The bill came out to around $20 per person (a bit more since we each had a beer). It's definitely a steal and a great place to back away from meat and get a healthy dose of your veggies.",1,1,1

Here's my beef (see what I did there!!!) .... they have a ""BLT"" you can order. The ""fakon"" (I'm not sure that's the technical name, but it was fake bacon"" was terrible. Why bother trying?

I was there foe almost 10-15 minutes, no one came to my table,  didn't even drop off a water. I was alone a d thought they would handle that easily. I didn't know if I had one server or they all helped. They kept walking by me and my back wasn't even to them. A girl says I'll be right with you and nothing, finally a guy comes takes my order forgets my water and another guy gets me one. Food again delicious.  I finish they clear my table and leave me there again. They don't ask if I want desert or a drink just left me there.

The only reason I am not giving five stars is because there were only 5 pieces of cauliflower on the plate for $12. Buffalo cauliflower is my favorite dish and I've gotten it in quite a few places in NYC, and they always give you a large portion, so my suggestion would be just to increase the portion a bit, or lower the price.

Rude service doesn't deserve a tip, so I didn't include one.

The ambience is cool and the service was great - everyone is so nice!!They have an extensive vegan menu. We were in a hurry so we ordered some guac and 4 sides to share. Guac was good but cost $12!! Way too much for the serving size. The sides were great - favorites included the brussel sprouts and the Mac and cheese. We tried the pumpkin seitan and I just couldn't stomach it. Nothing pumpkin about it and it was just so bland. I would suggest trying something different instead.The best part was the smoothies we ordered to go for the road.

Updated review","Until recently, I've been going to Candle only for special occasions, such as when I want a traditional dinner during holidays or when I want to introduce a date to great vegan food. I didn't realize how close this place was to my kendo dojo, so now I am trying to come here fairly regularly.The ambience is pleasant and tasteful. You can sit at a table or sit at the front counter. I have never seen this place at less than 90% capacity or more, so the counter may be faster. It's higher scale than a diner though.Even with the busy factor, your Food will still arrive fairly quickly, and that greatly impressed me.The food is nothing short of outstanding. I believe it's the best vegan food in New York. The only place I ever encountered with cruelty-free food of this caliber was at Down to Earth in Hawaii.The wait staff is also very efficient and courteous. Yesterday I was asked if I wanted to have their wifi password for guests. This is the first time anyone at any restaurant ever asked me that question, so that was a very pleasant surprise!My only misgiving about this place is it's relatively expensive. I spent 42 dollars (including tip) on one entree plus dessert. But it's excellent food, and I believe Candle is one of the greatest emissaries of the vegan diet, ever. That's why I want to continue dining here whenever I can. I may just skip desserts, though, as tempting as they are.",4,1,2

But at the candle, deliciousness burns bright. Rather than give some long winded treatise of this or that dish, I want every foodie to take note that the seasoning of each dish is both amazing and consistent - amazing because of the complexity and variegation of flavors, consistent because, if you're going back for something you love; it will be there. If you know someone who thinks veggie is a bore, treat them to lunch or dinner here - you'll make a friend for life.Just went back for the Indian Plate - 12/12/17 (It's not on the new menu so ask for it.). I love it when you're thinking about a dish, and you finally go, and it's perfect. I went back and there it was.So, I'll say it another way. If you want to experience something sensational; go.

139,Robin C.,"Albany, NY",13,54,12,5.0,6/14/2016,"We love a vegan restaurant that doesn't pack its menu with quinoa salads and tofu curries, so this place was a welcome oasis in an area that's strangely all about meat, meat, and more meat. We parked the two carnivores in our party down the street at JG Melon (they wanted hamburgers, and, FYI, were pretty disappointed with that place) and grabbed a seat at the bar at Candle. The ambience here is nothing to write home about -- it's a pretty plain-Jane bunch of two-top and four-top tables, plus the bar -- but I barely noticed, thanks to the food and the wait staff, who manage to stay laid-back and friendly despite a packed-to-the-gills lunch service.My boyfriend went for the Indian plate, which he enjoyed very much. I took a taste (the chutney was great; the rice a bit undercooked), but, honestly, I was too obsessed with my Cajun seitan sandwich to pay much attention. Let's talk about that, shall we? Seitan is something of an acquired taste/texture, but if you like it, this version is grilled it for a little bit of outer chewiness and inner tenderness. It's served on a crunchy roll with greens, a heap of sauteed onions, and a mildly spiced mayo. I added a side of sweet potato fries, then dug in and took a leave-no-man-behind approach to everything on my plate.For dessert, we split the chocolate peanut butter pie with a scoop of ice cream. If you've never had vegan ice cream, know that it's made with a coconut milk base, which not everyone likes, but I happen to love. This version was terrific, and avoided the gritty mouth-feel of many vegan ice creams. The pie itself -- which has a tofu base -- was supersmooth and crazy-rich; definitely better suited to two people than one. Candle isn't cheap -- expect to pay at least $17 per entree, and $10 or so for desserts and/or drinks -- but I couldn't have enjoyed it more. The next time I'm in the area, I know where I'll be going.",3,1,1

Which is not my preference. I joked, ""don't all these people have somewhere to go? It's 230.."" The host laughed and asked if I could wait a couple minutes and he would have something for me, offered to get me a beverage while I waited recommending candle vice smoothie - a fruity blend which the menu said promoted Brian function . ""Perfect, I need to be productive, could use some brain power."" He found me a seat and I WAS able to be productive, the crowd thinned some by 3 and the drink was delic. Also ordered a motcha latte, unsweetened but the server quickly brought over a natural sweetener when I requested it .The vibe. The atmosphere is all about good vibes with artwork and decor complimenting this including a special board my most recent visit with messages chalked next to the specials  ""spread love; it's the candle way"" and ""Daily Vibe: Raise your words not voices; It is rain that grows flowers not thunder."" ~RumiHighly recommend as a good vibe cafe for lunch, smoothies and coffee - just be aware it can get crowded so plan the time you come.",3,2,3

The burrito was very good, filling and with a real Mexican kick - something I haven't found much of yet in NY. As for the elixir shot (kale, parsley, cayenne, grapefruit, yada yada yada), I finished it. It wasn't bad - strong tomato juice taste with pulp-esque stuff in it - although I'm not sure how often I'll get one.Good service, too. I asked for the chips; they don't come with the burrito.

I came here on a Sunday night and was seated right away. Got the Crispy Dumplings to start - which were delicious (the spicy balsamic dipping sauce blended so well with the rest of the dumpling). Then as a second starter, we tried the mac and cheese made with tapioca. I really enjoyed it because it had less salt than a typical M&C and still tasted ""creamy"". Then we moved on to the chili-lime seitan - it was very filling and the quinoa blended perfectly to calm down the chiliness of the seitan (albeit a bit too dry). The dollop of guac on top was nice - although it was  about the size of my thumb and a little bit more would've gone a long way! I'm really not sure how this costs $22 at all - perhaps seitan is a bit harder to cook? The decor is really inviting, and the servers we all very nice and friendly.

The size of the portions was perfect to me. I had the carrot cake as dessert,  based on some recommendations here on Yelp,  and it was just amazing.

Updated review","I've been coming to Candle Cafe for many years and I'm so disappointed that they keep changing the menu all the time. The reason people go to restaurants quite often is to have that special dish that they love so much but you can't do that to Candle Cafe since they're constantly changing the menu with the seasons which is so unnecessary because customers love consistency. I really wish that the chef or the owners would consider to keep the menu more consistent and stop changing it so often. It's so so disappointing every time I try to get a dish I love, it's already changed again. For example the chimichurri's appetizer used to be on a bed of greens, now they don't serve it on greens & the sauce ihas changed. Please keep consistency and pay attention to what the customers order over and over again and keep those dishes. That's what great restaurants do.",,,

The collards were not cooked well enough and tasted very bitter...not like homemade.

He was offering an excuse without even asking my name or checking the fact that I was on the list.   I told him I was on the list and he turned his back on me and walked away.  The hostess said I did not understand and attempted to give me a lame explanation. I immediately left with my family.   Because the manager turned his back and walked away, I would never go back.   He could have attempted to offer an explanation rather then leave it to an inexperienced hostess.  Poor customer service and I am sorry to say I will not be back.",,,

I've been a vegetarian for my whole life so it's very refreshing to find a restaurant where I can eat everything on the menu. Tried the chimichurri skewers, the raspberry lemonade, the guacamole, and the tofu club sandwich. All were excellent! As a table we shared the chocolate mousse, the carrot cake, and the fruit crumble a la mode (that day, it was apple cinnamon). The carrot cake was the weakest of the three, being very dense and it did not have a very strong flavor. My favorite of all that I tried was the tofu club sandwich, which was very filling and had great flavor. The guacamole was excellent- but $12! It's not really a specialty vegan food because no matter where you get it, it's vegan! The entrees seemed to be fairly priced, but the drinks and some of the appetizers were very expensive. Our service was excellent and the server was very amicable. The ambiance is mediocre; not very fancy. I would come back here, but it may be more of a casual lunch place. Come here hungry!

The plating is beautiful and portions are quite big. Eggplant Napolitano was amazing! I've never had eggplant like that before. Service was also fantastic.

This is your treat. My advice? Split this with somebody or get some balancing desert (sorbet or coconut ice cream?). I had it first when I was ravenous and I got about 3/4 through before my stomach was like HOLD UP, TONGUE, I'M TRYING TO KEEP UP DOWN HERE. mmm mm good.Manicotti: I was expecting this to be very different. Probably because I never get manicotti as a vegan so I forgot what it was. (See picture) I mean it was good but it didn't blow my mind. Probably because I was imagining seitan stuffed raviloi swimming in a cream tomato sauce with greens. and I prefer my greens a bit more acidic to take the bitter edge off. But that's just me!Cajun Seitan Burger to go: yum! but would have been better in house. I tried a fry when I got it: divine. Later? a little sadder. the sandwich was tasty!

181,Melissa H.,"New York, NY",0,10,1,5.0,8/3/2015,"The best VEGAN food in NYC, hands down. Sounds like an oxymoron, right? ""Tasty vegan food"". Well, let me tell you something: this is the vegan restaurant to win over any/all non-believers.Let's start with the starters. I recommend ordering a few and sharing. The Grilled Chimichurri Seitan Skewers are incredible. They taste very meaty and are sure to satisfy. For something lighter, the Summer Rolls and Avocado & Heart of Palm Ceviche are crisp and refreshing and paired with delectable sauces. Skip the Mezze plate, which you can get at any decent Middle Eastern/Mediterranean joint. Now, onto the sandwiches, the Cajun Seitan Club is what dreams are made of: crispy, breaded seitan, avocado, vegan mayo and caramelized onions. I wouldn't call this health food, but I am a big believer that not all calories are created equal, so at least you can relish in knowing this orgasmic food is made with whole, healthy ingredients. One of my faves is also the Tofu Club, but sadly they took this off the menu (if you're reading this Candle Cafe, please bring it back! And the Paradise Casserole, as well). :'(As for the entrees, I highly recommend the Ginger Miso Stir-fry or the Mexican Lasagna. Too delicious. You'd never guest that something so good, could be so good for you! They also have a great option called the ""Good Food Plate"", which is 4 sides and 2 sauces. Like everything else on the menu, the desserts are pretty awesome, too - but I wouldn't call them healthy, just healthier than your average sweets. The tofu Chocolate Cake is crazy good and the Carrot Cake may be ever better. I have a weakness for the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Long story short, you really can't go wrong here, whether you're vegan, or not.",3,,2
182,Pamela J.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",88,823,744,3.0,9/24/2014,"I give three stars for a vegan restaurant period.  This was one of the only places around when I first moved to NYC.  Now, we are blessed with many, many more choices.I found the menu really bland and boring, however, which was a disappointment.  I had an arugula salad with some veggies and fried mushrooms.  The oddest ting happened while eating - I got shooting pains in my stomach.  That would happen back in the days of shoveling all sorts of pastas and dairy products into my system and rarely happens now.  Not sure what it was that caused this.  Aside from the food, the environment was peaceful enough with it's enlightened diners.",1,,
183,Kirsten B.,"Flushing, NY",52,106,206,3.0,1/4/2016,"I came here with my fiance while we were off from work and looking to try out more vegan restaurants in the city. It was pretty packed when we went, and the tables aren't exactly large. I got a kale salad with a side of their mac&cheese, and my fiance got nachos with pulled jackfruit. The kale salad was good, and large, but still not that filling (which is why I got the mac&cheese, plus I'll try almost any vegan mac&cheese at least once). That was also pretty good, but it either needed sriracha or some seasoning on it. It's not often that I've had a vegan mac&cheese that I've liked without adding some kind of seasoning to it. The jackfruit nachos that my fiance got were great though, if I go back I'll be ordering those for myself.The service was good, they even make a point of asking if anyone at the table had allergies they need to accommodate. The main reason I'm not giving them more stars is because they're kind of expensive and the food was good, but not mind-blowing.",,,
184,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",21,100,86,5.0,10/26/2015,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Not just one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants, but I mean one of my overall favorites!  Everything I have tried here has been skillfully prepared, with great flavors. I love the presentation of all the dishes here. Even with something as simple as a sandwich, the ""fancy"" presentation on big plates makes it seem special. It adds to the experience.My favorite is the Cajun Seitan sandwich. It is their secret weapon--you MUST try it. The BLT club sandwich ties for first too. I especially enjoy it with the aoli that comes with the seitan sandwich- ask for it on the side! The ""fries"" are amazing - they are hearty potato wedges. I like to ask for mine to be made as ""truffle fries,"" they do charge extra for this but its delicious. Now that I know I can do that, I can't help myself every time! Sweet potato fries are also great. The ""good food plate"" is another go-to for me when I crave something healthy and low-carb (as an alternative to my favorite sandwiches). It's a generous portion of delicious veggies (and tofu or seitan) and I love the sauces (especially the carrot ginger). Sometimes they give me an extra sauce, which is nice because the veggies can be plain and the sauce adds some variety.The nachos appetizer is delicious. Nachos are not something I normally order, but here they are light, healthy, and tasty! The decor is nice and the service is good. Servers are always so nice and friendly. I never feel rushed or ignored.My only complaint is that it is a tad expensive, especially for a place that is all vegetarian. However, I am also pretty sure it is all organic, which is a plus.",1,,
185,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,11/2/2014,"In my ongoing quest to balance out my brownie-binges (read: every Friday night and some spillover into Saturday morning) with 5 minutes on the treadmill, I have dabbled in the mighty power of tofu, quinoa, and tempeh. Hold on, I need to step onto the soapbox for a minute: the whole gluten-free, organic, OMG-kale movement annoys the bejeesus out of me. The people who are actually allergic to gluten have my deepest condolences. But for every person who will drop dead if they ingest a bite of gluten-packed bread, there are five others who use it just to drive themselves and their wallets nuts. I honestly think everything in moderation (even refined sugars and cheese and deep-fried, beer battered steak) will keep both your body and soul happier in the long run, instead of deeming select items to be totally forsaken. Okay, I just resent people who hold up the line at Starbucks by asking a million of questions and making sure the whipped foam on their pumpkin spice latte is absolutely fat-free, not skim, not 1%, not 2%. Or who insist on eating spirulina muffins and lying to my face that it's more delicious than my butter-heavy banana nut bread. Girl please. Anyway, I liked the Mediterranean wrap (needed a bit more tofu feta), loved the vegan carrot cake, and hated the prices. I guess it's better than Candle 79 but the idea of shelling out close to $20 for some diced tofu, brown rice, and broccoli/vegetable medley makes me sad. You can buy all those ingredients at your Trader Joes or health food market for $20 and feed yourself for a few days.  Also, our guy waiter was super nice and chill, while our girl waiter stared me down when I had the audacity to tell her to take the iced tea off our receipt when we never got it. Also not sure why only the cajun seitan sandwich gets fries as a side and the rest of the sandwich/burger options only have greens.",,2,

I hardly ever complain, until now!",,,1

196,Andrew C.,"Union, NJ",13,32,11,2.0,10/8/2014,"Let me preface by saying: I like the owners. they're good people, they are universally liked.That being said, the problem with Candle is what is the problem with virtually all health food restaurants in New York city. In the first half of the decade of the new millennium, rents skyrocketed. Then in the second half, food costs spiraled upward, due to freight costs. These two phenomena turned vegetarian restaurants, once bargains, into very expensive eateries. As a result, menu prices have outrun.inflation, coupled with eateries reducing portions.The accompanying photo corroborates my point.The selection of these four items--brown rice, grilled  tempeh, grilled tofu and sauteed broccoli set me back a surreal $20. Twenty bucks! Ordered separately, each item would be $5-7.So I don't make the principals of the Candle culpable. It does, however, motivate me more than ever, to prepare my own meals, even if this means getting out of bed earlier, or staying up late, or cut into my weekend leisure. Because truth be told, I could prepare all in this picture for under four dollars. yes, there's no ambience nor the pleasure of dining out. still, if I were to eat out twice per week, this would set me back $2,000 annually. I refuse to pay these prices for these portions.oh, regarding the food, the tofu was best, really firm, probably the Bridge brand. Tempeh had good seasoning, broccoli was cooked long enough to break down micro cellulose and stl retained bright green color. The carrot-ginger dressing and gravy were flavorful, what there was of it. The rice was too wet and tasteless. I skipped on soup, appetizer and dessert as I was not going to walk out of this spartan decorated cafe with a forty dollar  bill, as I once dined there, soup -to-nuts, for under half that price. Again, I don't blame the owners, its a sign of the times and I will protest by cooking more often.",,,

198,Rachel Z.,"Manhattan, NY",32,27,2,5.0,6/1/2015,"This place does vegan food RIGHT. One peeve I have with vegan places is that the foods are greasy, fried, or in some other way unhealthy, but disguised as ""healthy"" vegan fare. Candle Cafe isn't it. They present vegan food just as is, no trying to cover up or overcompensate with extra oil or sauce. Everything that I tried was freshly prepared in a way that I would cook for myself at home.I ordered the grilled portobello steak and sweet potato smoothie. The entree was nutritious and deliciously satisfying, but it was the smoothie that stood out. The guy at the bar suggested adding peanut butter, which sounded like a great idea in my books. Was it ever. It was like drinking pie in a glass, indulgent tasting yet healthy! I love that this place turns such simple, seasonal ingredients into hearty and delicious meals.
