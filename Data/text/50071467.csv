0,Carola B.,"Weehawken, NJ",93,99,329,5.0,11/9/2018,"Absolutely love the design of this place, a more sofisticate ""sports bar"" where to get a drink after work if you happen to be in Midtown. I came here for dinner and everything was very good!We shared some appetizers as tuna tartare, risotto balls, shrimp and best of all loaded Mac n cheese with bacon, shrimp and beef. Truly the best one I've ever had!!",,,

2,Victoria E.,"San Francisco, CA",652,796,15477,4.0,6/16/2018,"I came here for breakfast one morning. This is adjacent to the hotel that I stay at which actually offers free breakfast for selected items on the menu. I had the steak and eggs which was on the free breakfast menu section which was fine. The cappuccino was great. But the best part about this restaurant is how it's designed. It has inside and outside all together and it opens up to the street so it makes it feel bigger than it really is. I think the food is not its strength, it's the drinks. In the evening, it gets very busy which I thought was good. It does get loud because people linger after the happy . hour.I like how the Crown Plaza gets a face lift after many months of renovation. I don't have to go to the next door cafe for breakfast anymore.",6,2,5

Updated review","So I stumbled upon this almost empty restaurant during my lunch break. There were about two tables half way done with their food and one person at the end of the bar. Bartender comes over and I ask her for some suggestions she tells me about this steak burger they have so I order it. I look them up on Yelp and saw that they did like 15% off your bill if you check in. I ask the bartender about it she doesn't know and reverts the question over to a floor manager I'm guessing and he tells me no they don't honor it. I said ok confused and he comes back a min later and says that they do honor it he just wasn't informed about it, ok cool.I'm sitting at the bar looking through emails maybe ten minutes goes by still no food but ok it's only been ten minutes. I look up all the workers are hanging out at the end of the bar talking, ok it's a slow day. There are several people standing at the corner of where I'm sitting and not one person checked in on me, asked me if I needed anything , nothing. It's been 20 something minutes now I ask for a drink and it was strong exactly what I needed for the day and the only reason I added one more star.I thought the bartender would notice that I was sitting there with no food and would go check nope. I had to point it out to her. ""Um do you know where my food is?"" A manger goes back to check on my food 6 mins later comes back and goes back into conversation with the employees like I wasn't sitting there waiting for a response. More time goes by and finally she comes over and says they're wrapping it up for me because at this point my lunch break is over. After over 40 mins of waiting for a burger in an empty restaurant (I was the only person ordering food at this point) the bartender tells the manager what happened and they comped my drink and discounted my food. I gave them one star for the discount and 1 more star because the bartender made me the strongest rum and coke I've ever had. I did not like the steak sandwich at all after all that waiting it was not good. I just had a company event at TGA on Thursday and I will say I had a much better experience this time around. Bartenders were friendly. Drinks were still great and the food was better. It was during happy hour and I noticed that they get a nice crowd by the bar area. I may return for happy hour and see how that goes.",,,

5,A. B.,"West New York, NJ",2,37,114,4.0,5/3/2018,"A lovely venue in midtown Manhattan. A nice clean lunch  menu, not overwhelming, but delicious. I was there for lunch with friends.  The service was slow despite the fact that there were not a lot of people there. So don't go for lunch if you have to rush back to work. I ordered the grilled chicken, bacon and Swiss bread . Others ordered TGA burger and the shroom burger. We were all happy with our meals. There is a garden dining area that is very nice and there is a bar there. It is all glass and the roof opens up. It opens at 2pm during the week.",,,2

I came here for brunch, did not drink but they for have a bottomless mimosa/bellini etc. for 2 hours/$35. Best home fries I've had in a long time, well prepared food, I had the crab cakes benny, so good! Enjoyed my visit here and would return and recommend.",1,,
7,Ashley F.,"New York, NY",144,122,558,5.0,1/26/2018,"Came here for happy hour (4pm - 7pm) with my boyfriend. Includes $5 drafts, $6 cocktails with titos vodka and $7 glasses of wine. Not bad, especially considering the ambience of the environment. High ceilings with long, branchy lights. Lots of TVs. Marble countertop. Polite bartender. Some couches and tables by the front, which is all glass, so you can look outside at the street (not much to see though). I got titos margarita on the rocks. It was tasty. My boyfriend got a stout. We were quite pleased.",2,,1

9,Juliana G.,"Northport, NY",307,64,51,5.0,2/10/2018,"stopped in here on a Friday night with a few friends. We decided to sit at the bar and take advantage of their happy hour. Their wines were $7 a glass which is a great deal in NYC. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We ordered french fries as a snack and they came out quickly and were delicious. Loved the high ceilings and the ambiance. I was surprised that it was attached to a hotel - but once you were inside, you couldn't even notice!",1,,
10,Nicole S.,"Floral Park, NY",360,51,9,3.0,6/12/2018,"This restaurant was ok. Not a bad place to go if you work in the garment district. My friend and I came here for our lunch break one day and had an alright experience We both got salads and they were great, but they took 35 minutes to come out. We didn't have time to finish them because we had to return to work. Service was just awful. I used a yelp check in coupon and our waitress forgot to apply it to the bill. Since everything was so slow we had no time to fix it. Although she forgot to apply it to the bill, she sure remembered to mark it redeemed on my phone!! Lol. Oh well. I probably wouldn't go back anyway since there are so many other great places in the city",,,2

Updated review","Picked this place since it was close by and I liked the bar / restaurant concept. I loved the high ceilings and cool light structures that they had in front. I got the spicy miso steak cooked medium rare which came out perfectly. The sauce was very tasty and the meat was tender and not chewy or tough at all! While the steak was stellar, I wasn't too fond of the wedge fries that came with it. The seasoning was cooked but the fries were a bit undercooked or maybe just not fried enough. They tasted too much like cardboard and there weren't too many pieces either. Still I think the steak made up for it in terms of taste and quantity of food.",,,
12,Cindy L.,"New York, NY",91,54,10,4.0,1/25/2018,"Came here for a business lunch. Overall, a solid spot for business or with friends. Not located on the best street, given there is construction going on and closed sidewalks all around. However, once inside, I have to say, the space is quite impressive. It's spacious and seems much bigger due to the soaring ceilings. The decor is both chic and luxurious. I would definitely have loved going there for happy hour and maybe have a Manhattan or two, but I digress. Though the decor was memorable, the ambiance....well, there wasn't much of one. Which had to do with the fact that we were the only table in the entire restaurant. At 12:30 pm. On a Thursday. In midtown. So, it was kind of disconcerting. But I'm optimistic that will change once the weather turns and the pace picks up because the food we had was really good. We both ordered cobb salads, which, I know, is pretty boring and basic. However, you'd be surprised how easily simple things get messed up. The price point was a bit high but it is midtown and the quality was above average. The chicken was well seasoned and moist, the salad dressed just enough, the bacon at the right point of crispiness. There was one miss, which was the bean hummus that we had to start and that was a major disappointment. It was too runny and the pita tasted chewy.",1,,1
13,Eccde E.,"Havre de Grace, MD",0,6,0,4.0,1/5/2018,Some local beer. Unusual but very good crispy chicken sandwich. The staff was excellent and attentive. Short walk from Penn Station while I waited the 90 minutes for the next train. I would stop by again.,2,,1
14,Heather C.,"Sharon, MA",0,8,0,1.0,5/17/2018,"Staying in the adjacent hotel, stopped in for breakfast at 9:00. Wasn't too busy, only one server working. I didn't place my order until 9:35, well after others who had arrived after me had gotten their food. No one came to take a drink order or check on me. I was seated in a weird corner, maybe that was why I was ignored? When my order was finally taken (and I got my food close to 10) no apologies were offered. Then my bill was wrong. Would definitely not recommend if you're in a hurry!",,,
15,Robert E.,"Oakland Park, FL",261,32,75,4.0,3/15/2018,Great local bar near the Hilton Garden Inn and Javits Center. Good sound system and plenty of TVs for games!,,,
16,Steph D.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,119,1,1.0,7/15/2018,"If you're visiting New York but aren't eager to truly explore the local cuisine, TGA NYC is for you!  This restaurant expertly interprets the food from a Holiday Inn in central Ohio, but raises the stakes with the casually indifferent service that New York City has mastered. But don't trust me, you'll have plenty of time to form an opinion as you wait 60+ minutes for food, without interruption of a waitperson to actually bring you more coffee or water.",,,
17,Greg F.,"New York, NY",1,1,2,5.0,12/20/2017,"Found out about this new restaurant through a friend, so decided to try it out before I went to a Knicks game.  Less than a 5 minute walk from the garden.  Amazing space, with fast/friendly service.  The Old Fashioned is on tap and is delicious!  Had the buratta and the caeser salad, both of which were amazing!  Recommend TGA to anyone in the area!  5 stars!!",1,,1

We got super cute pics in the back room and the decor was a great talking point since interior design was something we have in common! Unfortunately, my hamburger came out practically raw and I needed to ask for it to be cooked 2 more times for it to be edible. Not sure if I would come back here it it wasn't for my new BumbleBFF and the chic decor.",,,

22,Lynn S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,28,1,2.0,6/23/2018,"The food was good, and that's the only reason this place gets two stars. The server had a attitude and ignored me for the whole time. Did not even give me water!! When I finished eating, the 15% gratitude was already added to my bill, and this guy circled tip suggestions in the bottom of my bill and asking for another 20%. Are you fuckin kidding me? You think your shitty service worth 35% of tip? Not coming back, and ppl be aware",,,
23,Kev W.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,6,1,5.0,3/23/2018,Great place.   Went for Sunday Brunch and had a great meal.Will have to try it again when the weather is better and the outside space is open.,1,,

27,Joe V.,"Universal City, CA",0,13,0,5.0,4/2/2018,Great food. Great drink. Great vibe. I took team members to TGA on March 25 and all 7 of us thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff was friendly and both the manager and GM were cool and accommodating when I mentioned two of the team members were celebrating birthdays. They did a super job making it special. The burgers were out of this world. I had short ribs which melted in my mouth. Loved the experience and it looks like they are expanding to open a beer garden. Just in time for the summer. Can't wait.,,,
28,Emma T.,"New York, NY",270,32,8,4.0,2/11/2018,"wanted to try a new spot after a late night at work, so I stopped by TGA for a quick bite at the bar.

We were seated quickly and attended to every step of the meal. Even the manager/owner stopped by to say hello.  On Valentine's Day I got the salmon, I'd highly recommend it to anyone it's absolutely perfect!  We were there for three hours that night and can't wait for next time!  Enjoy!",,,
32,Katharine H.,"Ballwin, MO",0,145,0,3.0,6/4/2018,Definitely try the chicken wings. Especially if you're feeling adventurous. Kim Chi? You make my stomach hurt. Korean barbecue? Pish posh!,,,

We made a reservation on Open table for 6pm. We were a little late due to being stuck at work but the hostess was very accompanying and sat us. Promptly the waitress took our drink order. Great cocktail list but we ordered 2 glasses of wine. For apps we have the chicken meatball (out of this world) and the homemade fresh mozz. Amazing. We split the burger as well which was good size and tasty. Bar had a good happy crowd and they mentioned they are opening a Biergarten with an open roof next month.

39,Alex G.,"Massapequa, NY",11,6,0,5.0,12/9/2017,"I visited the recently opened TGA restaurant and lounge in the Crowne Plaza Hotel Hudson Yards on 36th street and it was amazing experience. TGA has a good sized bar, a lounge area and looks like they are adding a heated open air beer garden with a retractable roof. The drinks were good, they had a nice assortment of specialty beers.  I tried the appetizers and would recommend the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, Salmon Crudo and Tuna Tartare. They were pretty packed for being open two days and I was surprised that servers were really good and knew the menu and very attentive. The prices were reasonable and didn't feel like they were overly priced. Definately a stop if your going to midtown, close to MSG, Penn or Times Square.",,,1
40,Megan W.,"Queens, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/6/2017,"Your attention is immediately drawn to this place because first thing you see are the long chandelier-type lights that hang from what is at least a 70 ft ceiling - not exaggerating. On the inside there's a little something for everyone. Of course there's a fully stocked bar with super friendly and entertaining bar staff. There's also a lounge-type area with gorgeous blue velvet couches and glass tables. If you're there for dinner the dining space has nice half booth/half tables that can accommodate large parties. The food was absolutely delicious! Couldn't get enough of the Italian white bean dip appetizer, and the braised shortrib was amazing!! Didn't even need a knife to cut it it was so tender. I will definitely be back for some more food and definitely a few more West Side Highways (one of their signature cocktails - a must try!)",,,1
