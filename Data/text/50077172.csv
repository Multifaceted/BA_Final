Updated review","Recently was in the area, and was very much satisfied with the service. The quality of the foodserved to me was exceptional. My previous review proves the point hitting 100 percent is very difficult. This time around, they scored a big 100 percent for me. Next time visiting Stuyvesant Town Peter Cooper area, this is a must visit. Nice work chef.",,,

Updated review","Updating my review because Felipe reached out to me personally, apologized and we had a bit of a heart to heart!  It's really honorable when a business is accepting of feedback and I don't feel uncomfortable going back to eat here anymore! In fact, I will come for food tonight!When I see Felipe's mom tonight (perhaps she's working) I will now have a better understanding that working the register can be very overwhelming during rush times and hope for the best moving forward :)Again, really love their pizza! Maybe will finally try their Penne Vodka tonight and switch it up! Thanks again Felipe.",2,1,2

5,Christina S.,"Westwood, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,10/17/2018,"Absolutely disgusting food and horrible customer service. In my opinion, if you actually like eating here, you have probably never eaten high quality, authentic Italian food. How does a so-called Italian restaurant mess up baked ziti?!?This was my second time ordering pickup from here. The first time my penne vodka barely had any sauce on it- but still I decided to give this place a second chance, out of convenience, since I live a block away. Tonight I placed an order of baked ziti, pasta carbonara, and a side of broccoli. I asked if they could do vodka sauce instead of marinara on the baked ziti- they said it was no problem but they had to charge me $3 extra. I said that was fine. After bringing home my food, I find artichokes in my baked ziti? I am VERY allergic to artichokes. No where on the menu does it say that any of their sauces, or any dishes actually, contain artichokes. Being Italian myself, and having eaten at many Italian restaurants, I have never encountered or heard of putting artichokes in either vodka sauce or in baked ziti. So I called and explained that I'm very allergic to artichokes and that the menu did not list it as an ingredient. I understand that I ordered something ""special"" (by exchanging the marinara for vodka) but like I said, no where mentioned artichokes. Instead of apologizing or offering a solution, the man I spoke with began arguing with me that their vodka sauce ALWAYS has artichokes in it. I explained that I have eaten their penne vodka before and it did not have artichokes. He angrily persisted that it ALWAYS does and that it was MY fault that I didn't tell them no artichokes. ""Okay...but mine didn't last time. And how would I be able to ask for no artichokes if the menu doesn't list artichokes, and that isn't a typical ingredient to put in vodka sauce? ..Bottom line, I'm allergic and I cannot eat my meal."" ""Well we always use artichokes so you have to say no artichokes.""............So after a lot of back and forth, I said I would like to pick up another order of baked ziti with regular sauce, and without artichokes. He was obviously not happy with this. He asked if I had touched the one I received. ""No...?"" I still cannot believe they actually made me bring back my order. What are they gonna do, serve it to someone else? To top it off, the baked ziti and my fiancé's carbonara was mediocre at best. The side of broccoli with garlic had no flavor. And I just can't help but be pissed that I paid an extra $3 for the vodka sauce, and the meal I ended up with had regular sauce. But they did not offer me ANY sort of apology for this entire inconvenience, never mind think to refund me for that. Rude staff and shitty food. Complete waste of 40 bucks.",,,
6,HJ K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,28,0,1.0,10/17/2018,"This review is just for the pizza at the front. Their slices are unbearably salty even the cheese slice.The selection is quite limited for pizzas. Usually only cheese, Margherita, or grandma slices available at all times. Other pies are random depending on what day of the week it is. I sometimes order a chicken slice and it's sometimes 4.00 or 4.50 depending on who checks me out at the register.",,,
7,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,3.0,4/15/2018,"Food is pretty decent. I decided to try a different place tonight so I ordered from Franks - scallops with linguine and a plain pizza. The pizza was surprisingly good - chewy crust, good sauce, it could probably use a little more cheese. The scallops were OK - they didn't follow the instructions RE having the same sauce in the linguine. The scallops weren't seared on all sides - basically they were caked on top with bread crumbs and thrown under a broiler. I'll probably order pizza from them again but I'd pass on pasta.",,,

It was delivered to my job.  When I  went to take a slice the pie was half spinach and half sausage and one of my coworkers took a slice of the sausage. I called them and told them they have me the wrong pizza and they told me that they sent what I ordered. After going back and forth and telling them the receipt had the correct order they agreed to deliver a new pie and take back the old one. When I told then one of the slices was missing they said no. I asked to speak to the manager. She started screaming in the phone and hung up on me. At this point I was livid and I put on my jacket and went there and opened the box of pizza and showed them the receipt. They said nothing, made a new pie and gave me a weak apology and a free salad with spoiled lettuce. They've lost a loyal customer.",,,

I ordered delivery from them last night and it was awful. The chicken in the Chicken Parmigiana was stringy, gross, hard to cut with a knife since it was so hard and nasty and mostly inedible. It also didn't taste very good.We also had Fettucini Bolognese that was not very good.On the plus side, they delivered fairly quickly and gave you a huge amount of bread.I won't be patronizing Frank's anymore.",,,

The veal is horribly quality and they serve artichoke hearts in the penne vodka. That's ok if you like that, but I don't and it's not even listed in the description. What I also noticed is the bread they serve for the hero, they use the same bread for the table with butter. There are so many places better for veal and penne vodka in this neighborhood. Never again.",,,

They will overcharge you when you're not looking.I went in to order a large cheese pizza which is $12.50 but they told me total was $14.50 because it includes tax. I told them there's no way tax was 16%. The old lady went to her calculator punched in some numbers and came up as $13.75 but came back and told me it was $14.50 plus tax. This type of behavior from the old lady is not an anomaly for me. I've gone in a couple times in the past where she overcharged me and I had to point it out to her. But this time she was just blatantly lying. Needless to say, I will not be going back. And for those that have no choice, remember to check your bill.",2,,1

Appetizers came out 1 hour late as the main course, the glass of wine is too little to be that expensive. The set up of the table was bad, two big forks each? And some of us had a little spoon for dessert and other had the spoon of soup. Btw we got full only with bread when the ""real"" food came out we took it to go.

This happened when my friend decided he wanted a slice of pizza after I ordered my slice and a can of soda. So without looking at my change, I gave the woman an extra $2.50 for the extra slice which she took. She said nothing about already charging me for the slice. Later I decided to get a slice to go for my daughter and I realized my change was incorrect. I addressed the woman business owner who refused to even listen to me and the guy making pizzas started yelling at me that I should have checked my change when I got it back.

Updated review","My favorite neighborhood restaurant- great food, great service, great people working there! Been enjoying their food for at least 30 years at this location and longer at previous locations.  Hortensia, Franks wife and her son Felipe have carried on for Frank who passed away last year and they still give us the love and delicious home cooking we all look for.  Tonight I had a bowl of heart warming minestrone soup to start then a house salad big by any place's standards. For main course I had Chicken Paillard, on a bed of chopped tomato's and onions.  I had  nice espresso and  a piece of Apple crumb cheese cake for  dessert!  All this with a soda - for $ 40 including tax and tip!  Delivery when you want it is always fast and fresh and hot.",,,

Older folks gotta eat too and they've been in this community longer than your In-line-for-30-minutes-at-Arthichoke's ass.

Ordered three tiramisus through Seamless and they knowingly sent three completely different kinds of cakes/pies. When I called to ask what had happened their only excuse was that they were close to closing time and they just sent whatever they had left over! I was just dumbfounded because I had been looking forward to TIRAMISUs specifically and got my hopes up. Had I known they didn't have tiramisus, I would have cancelled and gone with a different restaurant. The person on the phone told me the only way that they could resolve this issue in any way was for me to make the trip to their restaurant (which I clearly wasn't going to do at 10:50pm on a Sunday). Please keep this in mind when considering this restaurant. If my experience is at all representative of their customer service, then you are in for a terrible surprise.",,2,

BUT, an hour and a half waiting for your entree with NO COMMUNICATION is just too long.Walked into the restaurant with reservations for 6PM for our group of six. We've never been to this restaurant but the reviews seemed okay so our friend booked the table. Upon entering, we mention our reservations to the ""host"", and she immediately starts yelling at us in Spanish. Now Im pretty conversational in Spanish so I understand she is telling us to go to the back (unescorted). Ummm okay, the place isn't that big... but thats kind of weird. Also, she never asked our name for the reservations. (What if she gave her last table away!?) Oh, Ill also mention the CHAIR blocking the entranceway. We practically had to hurdle our way to our table.So we all sit down and quickly get menus (the only thing we get quickly!). Within fifteen minutes, we get served two loaves of bread. Great, we're hungry! We then put in our appetizer and entrees orders. The calamari comes out twenty minutes later. Okay fine, let's dig in. Oh wait, 4 out of the 6 of us are missing forks and napkins and 2 of us are missing spoons. Wait another five minutes to get those.... The calamari was nothing special and the portion was small. We should've ordered more but thank god we didn't because who knows how long that would've taken!An hour goes by and we are all hungry! The waiter hasn't even checked in with us. My table discusses what to do since we kept seeing TAKE OUT orders go by us. Now I consider myself to be pretty reasonable but no joke, every few minutes, a new take out order would be walked out of the kitchen!! I then ask the waiter for more bread as a HINT to check on our food. Another twenty minutes later (1 hour and twenty minutes TOTAL) the second round of bread comes out. My entire table is just grouchy at this point. As soon as the bread hits the table, I tell the waiter that we've been waiting close to an hour and a half for our food. He does not say a word and runs straight to the kitchen. Okay, I work in sales so I understand customer service pretty well but there was ZERO communication. No ""sorry"", no ""sorry, we are short staffed today"", no ""let me check on that"", NOTHING!!! At this point, we really consider leaving but we hold out for ten more minutes and voila! By some miracle of God, our food comes. We scarf the food down ASAP and get the hell out of there!!! What else could go wrong now? How about, it takes another 20 minutes to get our check??!

56,Bradley T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,24,0,3.0,9/14/2013,"I finally had dinner here recently after walking by about a thousand times. I give this place a 5 for atmosphere and a 3 for food. I am rounding down to 3. Sue me!My experience was okay. The dining room in back is the best part. Because the front room is just a pizza take-out, going into the back feels a little like entering a secret club. Like a secret club run by someone's grandmother.Some other reviewers have called the decor ""outdated,"" but I thought it had a musty and claustrophobic charm. The waiters and most of the other patrons look like they've been working/eating here since LBJ was in office. I felt young and vital by comparison . .  . a nice change from feeling like the old person in the room, which seems to be happening more and more. Lesson: if you're feeling old, sit next to a much older person!I got one of the pasta specials, can't remember the name but it had the word ""country"" or maybe ""rustic"" in the name; the pasta itself was good but the dish was marred by overuse of green bell peppers (also kind of a throwback, so I guess that's appropriate) and the overall seasoning was off a bit. Not bad, just a tad bland. On the plus side, a small carafe of the house wine was cheap and drinkable. The service was good.This stretch of First Avenue has changed a lot over the last few years. It's nice to have a place like Frank's still hanging in there. I will have to try the pizza here one of these days.",,1,

The dining area is nothing fancy and very laid back. I dined on a Wednesday night. Lots of older folks and families. They start you off with a warm loaf of bread which you almost can't go wrong with. For the entree, I ordered Lobster Raviolis in a pink shrimp bisque sauce. AMAZING dish! It's enough to fill you up, but not to share. The sauce is thick and had such good flavor. They're also generous with their lobster and shrimp chunks which is rare to find. I highly recommend Franks! Lots of great traditional Italian dishes on the menu. The only reason this place doesn't receive 5 stars is because service was a little slow. However, it's not a big deal because the food was worth the wait and the servers were friendly.

62,Georgia D.,"New York, NY",16,25,8,1.0,8/8/2012,"I used to order from this place all the time through delivery.com. The pizza is ok- not great but certainly not bad. Keep in mind when reading this that I've ordered from them at least 20 times this year alone. The second to last time I ordered from them, the order took forever to get to me (over an hour!) and since I had paid online the tip was already included so I chalked it up to a learning experience. Less than a week ago I ordered from them again. This time I decided to only put half the tip on my credit card and would supplement with cash once the pizzas were delivered. The pizza arrived about 75 minutes after I placed the order (which is ridiculous since the pizzas were obviously cold at that point) with a note taped to one of the boxes saying ""too far and tip is not enough"". Having read the note and seeing as the delivery took too long I did not give the delivery guy any more money than i had already put on my credit card. I then called Frank's to ask if they had, in fact, put that note there or if it was from the delivery guy. I spoke to a woman who said she was the owner. She informed me that I live too far for them to deliver (even though it was not a problem the other 30 times they had delivered to me) and that bc the credit card tip was not enough in her opinion ($4- which was half of what they would have gotten if the pizza arrived in a timely manner)) she did not was my business and I could go else where. He exact words were ""I don't need your business:. Seeing as they are obviously doing well enough to not need repeat or new business, according to the owner herself, I would recommend no one go here.

Not sure how to describe Franks.  It's one of those pizza-place-in-the-front-but-HOLY-S&%T-there's-a-restaurant-in-the-back type places.  That honestly amazed me as a kid, almost like the entrance was through a fireplace or secret bookshelf and not just a double door.  In regards to the food, it's your classic, neighborhood, Italian place.  You're not going to get anything fancy, trendy, or contemporary.  But if you want a really good slice of NY style pizza, can't go wrong with Franks.  Some Chicken Francese?  My sisters swear by it.  Want something to drink?  You could order a bottle, but why not just get a carafe of house wine  instead?  Me?  I always go for the linguine Sinatra, which is just linguine, and a bunch of shell fish.  Simple.  Good.  Food.  3 Stars for the food, and I""m adding another star just for the sentimental value.",5,1,1

And it did take twenty minutes for them to run our credit card.UPDATE: They charged more than we authorized. We gave a 15% tip because the service was bad and that's the least we'll give, and yet they charged us a few dollars more than we agreed to pay.

The cheese pizza is good as always. One of the best plain slices I've had. The pesto.. well... it's okay. I wouldn't really pay a couple extra bucks for it. Its just plain pizza with globs of pesto sauce in random areas... and there is so much in one area it doesn't work out. Coming from an Italian family, trust me, I KNOW what great pesto sauce tastes like. This was good, don't get me wrong, but too rich to be on pizza. The salad is good, and the dressing is nice.

They had me come downstairs before the delivery guy got there cause they didn't want to buzz. whatever.food:they forgot my salad. the pizza was the most soggiest mess i have ever seen. not only did the cheese and toppings all slide off the dough, but it was actually watery. I'm not sure if that was from the sauce, or the veggies I had on it, but it made the whole thing a mushy mess. so, yeah maybe they had an off day, everyone does, but I wouldn't waste money on this place to take my chances again.",3,1,2
103,Cyrus X.,"New York, NY",39,55,0,3.0,12/11/2007,"2 restaurants in one!   I usually check out Frank's when I'm in a rush and need a couple tasty fresh slices of pepperoni or mushroom. Behind the pizza joint, through a glass door, is the real trattoria; here, the ambiance is that of an Italian grandma's home.: Quaintm spacious and unpretentious; the food is consistently good and reasonably priced.   I recommend the ravioli.   The only downside is that I always get the same aloof Mexican waiter whom I swear is consistently drunk.  This weekend, I'm heading there for the lobster special (drooling as I write ...).  Frank's, in my humble opinion, qualifies as a hidden gem.EDIT: I went back to Frank's and realized something that I had overlooked the first time.  The average age of the clientle is about 70. The food wasn't great this time.  Frank is no longer a hidden gem but still has decent food for decent prices. It's down to 2.5 stars.  However, if I'm disappointed again, it will be off of my list.  This pizza up front has never dissapointed though.",3,,1
104,Ellen O.,"New York, NY",51,198,476,4.0,7/28/2009,"Finally had dinner at Frank's Trattoria with my mother and sister.  You would think this was just another pizza place, but they have a nice restaurant in the back.  Service was attentive.  Frank's offers very good traditional Italian cooking (nothing new fangled, but sometimes I want traditional).  Great prices ($13 for chicken entrees; $15 for veal entrees).  Tiramisu was excellent, as was the fried calamari.  Don't mind about the older age group.",,,
105,Francesca F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,4.0,2/24/2012,The pizza and the food are both excellent here.  The owner is a bit of a grouchy lady who rarely smiles and is rough around the edges but they make a hell of a pizza and the other food is very good as well.  The only caveat are the veggies.  In have ordered vegetables that were overcooked or on their last leg and tasted sour so you may want to steer clear of the pizza garden!,,,
106,Pucci P.,"New York, NY",15,152,135,3.0,11/8/2005,I have yet to see the place but I often order it for delivery.  Decent Italian dishes with a fair price.  Entrees come with either pasta or a salad.  My favorites are the chicken parmagina and the calamari marinara.,,,
107,Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",711,1265,21,5.0,5/18/2007,"I'm glad Frank's trattoria exists.  This is my go to delivery pizzeria.  But let me talk about some of the pastas first.  They're alright.  They come with bread and salad, both of which are mediocre, and I really wish salad wouldn't come in an aluminum tin.  The pasta is where things start getting better.  They give you a decent portion for what you're paying, anywhere from 7-10 bucks, which is pretty reasonable.  They heap on a thick layer of cheese on top and the sauce, whether it's meat sauce or vodka sauce, is always a good consistency, not too runny or salty.  Now the pizza.  Man.  Once you open the top on this thing, your appetite flares.  The sauce is zesty, the cheese is just the right amount of thickness, and unlike a lot of pizzerias, you'll get fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned shrooms if you order them.  This pizza is so good, I'll eat half of one all to myself and stare down that fifth slice like a fat girl staring down a boyscout at a school dance.  Just thinking about that pizza makes me shiver.",1,1,1
108,Kim T.,"Somerset, NJ",3,40,0,2.0,5/27/2008,"the unfortunate truth is that this place basically sucks.  i'm forced to give it two stars because it's the only game in town if you want pizzeria style food like chicken parm, baked ziti, garlic bread, etc. in kips bay.  i long for the pizzerias of bensonhurst where every place made a sauce as good as your mother's and the spaghetti with meatballs was as delicious as any sunday dinner you had with the family.  if you don't know what i'm talking about, then i guess frank's is good enough.  for me, it's a mediocre imposter and i'd rather not even bother.",1,1,1
109,A B.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,2.0,11/8/2009,i couldn't even finish it. it was like going to pizza hut and getting two slices except with a little more salt thrown on and a couple of tomato chunks thrown in to make it seem fresh.it actually made me sick to my stomach. the sauce was slimy and disgusting.i'd recommend going to mike's on 2nd and 24th. not great but better than this.,,,
110,Adam R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/8/2009,"While I will not claim to know anything about the pizza, the food here is absolutely worthless. I have never had food so obviously prepared from frozen or canned ingredients. The food had zero flavor and the spaghetti sauce was almost definitely ragu. The service was good but who cares when you are forking bland food into your mouth.",,,
111,Greg F.,"New York, NY",92,14,0,4.0,11/26/2008,"Frank's is above decent pizza that is great for a quck cheese slice.  Pretty greasy pizza just the way i like it, but the crispiness of the crust varies from visit to visit. The toppings are quality....especially the sausage.  My roommate rocks the pasta dishes all the time and says they're excellent....looks a bit overpriced to me though.  Never eaten in....have always only ordered takeout, so will have to try that out..",,,
