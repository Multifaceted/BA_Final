My man suggested we try Waverly Inn, as it was his friend's favorite spot to eat. It's at a corner building in the west village - looks small and intimate, but when you walk inside, the restaurant is rather large. I want to emphasize the artwork here. It's a very dim-light restaurant with artwork and mirrors all around the walls. It's my type of vibe - dim-light, intimate, and nice artwork around. The server was really attentive throughout the meal - we didn't go a few minutes without having our water filled. I ordered an octopus dish with pine nuts and my man ordered a burger with fries. We started off with a signature salad. A simple, American meal. All the food seemed well prepared. The food didn't blow me away but it was quality and a really nice date night overall. It helps that there's a nice selection of wine. Pop in if you're in the neighborhood and at least grab a drink in the main room - it's beautiful.",,,
1,Jeremey W.,"Brooklyn, NY",298,17,5,3.0,10/22/2018,"I just recently moved here  in the West Village and this was on my list of places to try. Service- was stellar, the host is he was  was dressed to the t with his blazer and bandana ( tres chic, he totally was giving me Euro chic vibes) and was supper friendly. My waiter Ryan was super professional and timely with everything! I didn't make a reservation and ate near the bar. Food: I had two appetizers the Maryland crab cakes and the beet salad. I am from Maryland and the crab cake didn't at all taste like a Maryland crab cake. They get an A for effort. It lacked the old bay flavoring and it was overly breaded. The beet salad was to die for though, I highly recommend it.  If you're going to do a MD crab cake I recommend you have a chef or cook from a local MD restaurant come in and teach you how to do it right! Vibe: trendy, and fabulous. Overall experience- I would come back for sure I'm not giving up on the place just yet as there are many more things for me to try on the menu!",,,

5,Sabrina F.,"Houston, TX",368,435,274,5.0,10/11/2017,"When I stepped into Waverly Inn, it was like walking into a mid-century parlor. It's eclectic, intimate and super cozy. There's fantastic character, and it's perfectly nestled into a quiet West Village neighborhood. I came here with a few colleagues after an 8-hour planning session, so it was safe to say we were long overdue for some wine and decadence. We ordered a round of small plates for the table, and these stood out the most://Veggie plate - Very flavorful, topped with the freshest avocados I've ever had. //Grilled Octopus - Extremely fresh. It's not really big enough to share, so I'd order two for a table of 3 or more.//Black Truffle Mac & Cheese - If you're going to spend $90 on a Mac & Cheese dish, do it here. This was a specialty item, not listed on the menu. If you're really feeling fancy, the white truffle is available for a mere $280. For my main course, I opted for the sea bass with lobster orzo. The fish was blackened perfectly, and the orzo added a delightfully creamy finish. Service was exceptional. The house sommelier even stopped by to help us with making the best bottle selection. I'd definitely recommend if you're in the area!",3,,1
6,Judy H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,68,37,2.0,5/12/2018,"The only thing commendable thing about this restaurant is the outside seating and the biscuits that come before dinner. Everything else is mediocre/overpriced/ and it seems people come here for the scene, and potential to see someone famous. We came in for a res for 845 on a monday night, some members of our party didnt arrive until 25 minutes later, and by that time, our table still was not ready for some reason. Not sure if the table was given away ? We proceeded to wait 30 more minutes for a table to become available. We were taking photos of one another, as a member of our party was visiting from abroad, and got scolded by the wait staff and were told we coudn't take photos in the restaurant. What ...This is not a museum.... The food itself is SO mediocre...on the verge of being bad and is ridiculously overpriced as you would expect. The waiter we had was also a bit socially awkward.At one point, a huge leaf fell into our dish of food from above, as we were sitting outside, and when we told one of the waitresses all she said was ""oh"",  and proceeded to collect the leaf into her pocket and said she wanted to save it.....Neglecting to help us with the situation any further. All in all, if you want to sit in the outside area for the ambience, this place could be worthwhile. But for the west village ambience and MUCH better food, I would recommend Minetta Tavern over this.",1,1,

9,David J.,"New York, NY",61,272,15,5.0,2/15/2018,"What a magic night! From start to finish, everything was delicious and wonderful. The location on the ground floor of a 19th-century building gives it an ambience that can't be faked, but what IS faked are the 1920s-style murals covering every wall. I think I recognized Cole Porter and a couple of Barrymores. Dress well to go there, because it's sophisticated downtown NYC. Nevertheless, they are very accommodating. We shared everything: a tangy winter salad of kale & grapefruit, then grilled octopus that was quite spicy! It wasn't described that way on the menu, but I love spicy food, so it was a pleasant surprise. Then we shared a chicken pot pie and a side of some of the best onion rings a person could ask for. Dessert? How about Bananas Foster, made even better with a burnt sugar crust like a creme brûlée. Good coffee too, but be aware; it's strong!It was like a night out in the era of Dorothy Parker and the early ""New Yorker."" Can't wait for the next special occasion to go back.",2,,

Kid you not, melted in your mouth. Something to do with the globs of vanilla whipped cream.The famous Waverly burger: delicious, but too heavy on the meat.

The bar is small, so don't expect to find a lot of room to stand around (additionally there's a small seating area behind the bar that leaves very little room) and the larger dining area to the right can get stuffy.The staff is attentive and the bar tenders are knowledgeable and whip up some wonderful cocktails.

It can seem a little musty and cramped with the low ceilings inside though. The enclosed garden at the back is a prettier spot for dinner - but it's also quite difficult to get a table in. The food is well....highly average. The menu is a bit tired - it's a selection of classic american comfort food dishes (a mishmash of burgers, pastas, grilled dishes, etc.).The service was adequate.

14,George M.,"Manhattan, NY",4989,522,680,4.0,4/9/2017,"The Waverly Inn needs no introduction. Thus all that I can offer was my recent--and first--experience at one of New York City's finest establishments. But first, the menu states at the bottom that photography is strictly prohibited. Yet despite the prohibition, I had to clandestinely take a pic of the top part of the menu bearing a president Trump quote. See pic.We ordered the grilled vegetable quinoa salad and the foie gras sausage for starters. Both were excellent! I'm trying to stay clear of foie gras but it is oh so good. My ethics are battling my stomach and the stomach is winning.    We decided on the steak for two for the main. We've both had better.  Dessert consisted of the apple sorbet and the strawberry gelato. If I were a grade school teacher then I would grade the sorbet A for effort but it kinds of ends there. On the other had, the strawberry gelato was outstanding. Also outstanding was the honey infused butter and homemade biscuits ahead of our appetizers. Oh and needless to mention, they have an amazing wine list, with a dominance of French wines. Front of house service and service at the bar was best in class. Table service was adequate but could most definitely have been better. The staff was very responsive but they were committing the cardinal sin of wine overpour. Think pour similar to ordering a glass of wine by the glass instead of a bottle. I'll be back...",9,10,10

They wouldn't seat us until our party was there so we got a drink at the bar. The bartenders definitely knew what they were doing. We sat in the back, a covered outdoor area. It was a really beautiful area. I ordered an iced tea and the eggs Benedict, and it was all delicious.

The decor is eclectic, beautiful, and natural. The service could not have been better. It did not seem to matter which waiter was assigned to any table as they all seemed to be extremely attentive to all and ready to get us what we needed.The bouillabaisse  was perfect and had fresh chunks of everything you'd expect in such a delicious seafood stew. Our charred octopus was as good as we've had and the salmon crudo with avocado had many layers of flavor and texture that was quite a delight in the mouth.

We were seated in the enclosed garden, which was beautiful with a ton of natural light. It seems like the doors open in the summer to have more of an outside feel. I'll definitely back to check it out once the weather warms!After brunch, we sat in the bar area which is very cozy with a fireplace, all wood decor and nice jazz playing. This spot is great for brunch, but somewhat pricey so good for special occasion. The mimosas are wonderful, with fresh OJ and some Grand Marnier. We ordered the special omelette and the Croquetas madame, then shared bananas foster for dessert. The omelette was good, but nothing phenomenal. The bananas foster and croque madame are great!!We had mentioned to the restaurant when making our reservation that we were celebrating a big anniversary. Was a bit disappointed that no mention was made of it given how nice of a restaurant it is.

27,Colin M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",131,369,106,4.0,1/27/2017,"After being offered to come to dinner at The Waverly Inn, something sprung up in my brain to the gist of ""I think I've heard of that place."" Not being from New York, I have zero pre-conceived notions of the food, the waitstaff, or the guest list. I found the place to exude charm and character, considering when my Uber driver dropped me off I thought I typed in the wrong address. We had weekday reservations at 6:15PM and were shuffled back to our table in the back of the restaurant. It was fairly empty and was wondering what all of the hype was about (it didn't stay empty for long, hence the lack of available reservations for the rest of the night).Having dined at my fair share of fancy establishments, I was pleased the waiter didn't attempt to up-sell us on every drink, every add-on, and every course. I had an old fashioned to start, which was truly old fashioned... by that, I mean pretty much just bourbon and nothing else. But at least there wasn't any soda water.The highlight of my meal, surprisingly enough, was my salad. I had the iceburg wedge salad which was a great size, with a great mix of ingredients (bonus points for the onion crips and scallions). For dinner, I had the Lobster Thermidor, which while tasty, was only the half shell. Needless to say, after finishing a $50 half lobster, I was still hungry (the waiter actually could have told me to upgrade in this case).For dessert I had a cup of coffee and a dark chocolate ganache dessert which was also very good. Frankly, the restaurant gets 3 stars for the atmosphere, an additional star for the food, maybe a fifth star on a return visit with a more filling meal. Alas, I didn't see any celebrities, not that it would've mattered to me if I did.",2,,

Can't wait to return one day for dinner.Update: Returned for dinner. We sat in the booth between the main room and the garden. It felt as though we had a private room. Warm bread at start was a nice touch along with a sommelier who knew her wine in and out. She knew exactly what we wanted & recommended two wines that we loved. Chicken pot pie was superb. Lobster salad was ok.Bill for 4 was $280 which was reasonable. We ordered by the bottle which helped and we also moved to a new place for dessert.,2,,

He actually spoke to me with his head down buried in his phone, all the while talking to me and directing me to the bar as I waited for my other party to arrive. Horrible way to greet your quests.

Waverly Inn was around the corner and we had heard good things so we went there to celebrate. Being engaged for all of 1 hour, I literally could not contain my excitement and blurted out to the waiter that we had just gotten engaged and we were celebrating. He couldn't have looked less enthused. But we were in our own little world that we barely noticed. We ordered champagne, an app, and two entrees.The bill ended up being pretty expensive. I'm writing this review because in hindsight, I really cant believe that they wouldn't give us the champagne complimentary...no free dessert, nothing! It just irked me because I always see restaurants making a big deal out of these things, genuinely happy when people choose to celebrate such special moments at their restaurant. Waverly Inn simply did not give a shi**. Idk, just put a bad taste in my mouth. This may seem like a dumb thing to complain about but it was such a happy moment in my life and for such a well-known restaurant, they could've paid a little more attention.

You are very close to the table next to you which makes it awkward to get up. We ordered the Cote de Boeuf. It was flavorless! It desperately needed some aging. It was also not cooked as we asked, we wanted medium rare and it came medium well, making it tough. That sort of mistake should not happen at this price point. The sides were boring.

I asked our relatively inattentive server, Andrew, if we could add a chair for just 10 minutes to quickly celebrate as I blew out a birthday candle. It's not THAT he said no (of course I knew it was a possibility), it was the *condescending and dismissive* manner IN WHICH he said no that leads me here to write a review. ""It wouldn't be convenient to the other guests,"" he said in a haughty tone before walking away. No other thought or potential solution was offered. He simply didn't seem to care enough about *our* occasion as he did for the ""other guests"" around us. Do with that what you will. However, I have a difficult time believing that 10 minutes of eating dessert with an additional chair next to them would have been that out of sorts for anyone near us -- particularly on a lively Friday night. But rather than offer to help us -- guests he was also serving -- he dismissed me outright.So I offered my chair to my friend, and I stood next to him as Andrew brought out my birthday dessert and candle.

The food is good but the portions are on the small side and it is pricey. But, this is the West Village. What I think is arrogant is their no picture taking policy. When my friend tried to take a picture of an actress (with her permission) for his daughter, a waiter and the sommelier came rushing over and almost tackled him. He was mortified and we felt horribly for him. It was a horrible way to end the evening and none of us will be going back there at any time soon.",1,1,1

46,Autumn S.,"New York, NY",2,29,0,2.0,2/8/2017,"The ambience is amazing and the decor/feel of the restaurant is very nice. The food was generally good too. I did a meal out of several ""small plates"" (aka appetizers) instead of ordering an ""big plates"" (aka entrees) because that menu just seemed more interesting. I was wondering why the overall rating was mediocre compared to how amazing the place looks/tastes and particularly because it's hard to get a reservation for the weekends.  But I think that mostly has to do with the service.  While the waiter was pleasant, he didn't come back to check on us at all after the initial order. Everything else we got (e.g. Water, bread, wine menu, actually ordering wine, etc - basically everything other than the bill) was done through the bust wait staff.  That was disappointing because we wanted some wine with dinner and not when we were almost done.Then while the waiter served us the bill, he turned to the next table to see how they liked their food. I didn't appreciate the multitasking effort.  I know I'm supposed to remember the name of the wait staff when leaving a so-so review but I just forget. We were seated in the beautiful back room with the barn doors.",,,

We live nearby and find it difficult to go anywhere else. Actually scrap that, even if I lived uptown I'd be a regular. It rampacked with personality and steeped in history with tones of tails you may be lucky enough to hear.The bar staff are always super and make a mean aperol spritz. The sommelier is one of my favourite I've ever met. So friendly and helpful with amazing and sometimes unusual suggestions. Every single staff member I've ever encountered from the host to the wait staff and everyone in between, have been professional, polite and knowledgable.The bar, dining room and patio are literally unbeatable. Fantastic atmosphere. Patio is beautiful in summer and the dining room with those fires in winter is magical. The wedge salad, burger and onion rings are hard to resist.My only complaint is I wish the menu changed a little or they'd more specials on offer (solely as I'm here twice a week or so and would love a little variety).Go. You absolutely won't regret it.",7,,

We had a very hard time deciding between the heavier chicken pot pie and the lobster thermidor but we were very happy we went with the lobster because it was delicious and I notice now that it's also a seasonal item on the menu, and we can try the chicken pot pie any other time.I think this was my favorite birthday dinner out of the many I had this week.

Everything was okay until I asked the waiter for a photo of my relatively small party of 5. He said, ""we don't really do photography here"". I get it, you're some kind of fancy restaurant with some fancy whatevers and history and nice decor. Maybe I wasn't dressed nice enough to be photographed in their court yard, I don't know. I was just rubbed the wrong way with his refusal to take a photo for me.Regardless of how good the Cuban sandwich was (very fatty, very yummy), this experience left me very salty.

We sit by the fireplace when available. The place was packed solid last time we were there--but the food was just as incredible as ever!

The interior is old old old and very charming in an old city antique way. But I was disappointed from the moment we walked in the door. I do not appreciate snooty greeters or receptionists.  The 2 young women who guarded the entrance were more interested in their phones and chatting with each other than helping us. We were told we would have to wait until our entire party of 7 arrived. OK fine  but don't be rude and immediately go back to your phone. Then there was a private party in the back room.  When we looked to see what was going on, the party planner went ballistic and told us to back off, someone was giving a toast. Again, no need to be rude.  Our waiter was not the least bit solicitious and seemed put out that he had to wait on us. The food was expensive and only slightly above average. Most restaurants at least acknowledge a patrons birthday.  There was nothing. Not even a candle on a plate. I felt they were trying to hurry us out the door and really did not care whether we enjoyed our meal or not.  This might be a nice place if you are looking for a cozy dinner for 2 or 3 but it simply did not work for us.

It is covered in glass (so no matter rain or shine) with a giant tree growing right through it. Best seat in the house. The inside interior is also lovely, but quite packed with tables and the ceilings are rather low. I noticed it was rather noisy during peak hours. My partner took me here for my birthday. We sat out in the courtyard, surrounded by ivy and various plants, and as as the sun set the candle light grew stronger and the fireplace cozier... It was heavenly. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio to start, and Hokkaido Scallops and Skate Wing as the main course. The Carpaccio (starter) was beautifully served and well textures. The main courses we good, but nothing spectacular.But the biscuits. Homemade biscuits with honey butter... ON POINT.

All the dishes were very satisfying, but the pork belly was a little too fatty for my liking. The waiters were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu but the service was slightly disorganized - our table of 4 seemed to have 2 waiters that did not communicate with each other: We were asked for drink orders twice, they came to give us condiments twice, and then we were asked how we were enjoying our food twice.

62,Joie S.,"Providence, RI",61,501,0,4.0,1/15/2015,"I have wanted to try the Waverly Inn forever and I finally went last weekend. We had a good time, but there were some cons.Pros: The atmosphere. It is absolutely beautiful in there and we ate out on the closed in patio area. The biscuits. Oh. my. god. They were delicious, and the butter was great too. The service. They were always there refilling water, asking if you needed anything etc. The price and quality of the food. For a place like the Waverly, the price of the food was actually not too bad. Entrees were between 25 and 35 and they were pretty delicious. I had the gnocchi, and my friends had the roasted chicken, duck, and the chicken pot pie. My friend didn't love the duck entree but the rest of us were raving about our choices. Cons:The price of the drinks. There really isn't an affordable drink on the menu so be prepared for that.The service. Yes, they were attentive so that's a pro, but honestly it was too much. They were always there and honestly it felt like they were rushing you to get you out of there so they could turn over the table. When I'm at a nice restaurant, for a nice dinner with friends, I really don't want to feel like they want me to hurry up and move along. Closeness of the tables. If you are a party of two, prepared to be sandwiched in next to other couples. I""m actually not sure how some people got out once they sat other people so close to them. We were a party of three so we were good at our four person table but those two tops are uncomfortably close. Overall, this is a great spot for a special occasion.

The duck was rubbery, the steak was alright, and the venison was bland. Even the $20+ burger was dry and flavorless.The staff were friendly enough, especially at the beginning of the night. Although towards the end as they were winding down, it was tough to get anyones attention.

Dishes we liked: The duck, beet salad, pot pie, and the brussel sprouts.  Nothing seemed to be outstanding though.  Before coming I had I heard they give you homemade chocolates at the end of the meal, which I was SO excited for, but they RAN OUT.  We mentioned we were upset to the waiter and he came with a chocolate ganache dessert which was OUT OF THIS WORLD and very nice of him.Great atmosphere, but the food was not AMAZING for the price you are paying which is why I give 4/5 stars.  I would come back for a romantic special occasion.",3,,

We were seated in the garden right by the fireplace, and it really was a delight.Solid brunch with a lot of classics (eggs benedict, omelettes, etc), but also some more interesting plates as well (lamb chilaquiles). I was a bit nervous because their menu changes often, and it is difficult to find one online to check to see how gluten free friendly they are. Luckily, our server was knowledgable about which dishes were gluten free, and there were several options.The pork belly with potato hash and fried egg was not only gf, but it was also delicious if not a bit too decadent (serioooous chunk of pork belly).

He was constantly saying things like ""we have x brand of tequila"" and when we asked for other options he said ""our other options are very expensive $40+."" We didn't ask you about the damned price, we asked you for options! I also find it laughable that their truffle mac and cheese was around $100.

We had the beet root salad, which was delicious and the steak, which was too fatty for my liking. The best part of the meal was the free biscuit!

Apparently she hadn't heard him and it was her first time here.So the food. Mac & Cheese is the only thing worth ordering. The sole is good but not the best I have ever had.

We ordered a 2005 Rioja which was excellent. We had a variety of oysters which were crisp and fresh and delicious. He ordered the steak; I had the gnocchi. The gnocchi was a bit dry but the truffle mushrooms wee superb. We had creamed spinach which is def worth it. His steak was the perfect bite.

In a nut shell, the only thing here that is worth to visit is the historic site and the story behind it.As usual, today's service was also slow. The pancake dish came out rather dry, so we asked for more syrup. We waited and waited, it finally came with a small dish which has less then 10cc of maple syrup in it... so we requested another one and it took forever to come. In fact, we had to ask 4 different waiters in order to receive the 2nd small dish of syrup.When we asked for check, it took another 10 minutes for no answer. So we asked anther server for check, then our server got sent to us and ask what else do we want... it seemed to us that the servers here don't talk to each other or helping each other, but it also did not appeal to us that it's based on individual station responsibility. It's a mess.Before we left, we asked to speak to the manager and figured the managerial staff would appreciate our honest feedback. Unfortunately, this particular manager (morning shift on May 21st, 2016) all he did was to speak softly but defending the team..., no wonder the service is sloppy if this is how a manager's reaction when customers have something to say.

85,L L.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,4.0,5/5/2017,"Ah the Waverly Inn! Over the decades we ate here regularly. The comfort food menu and the cozy interior with roaring fire made it particularly delightful in winter. The garden and delish cocktails were the bee's knees in spring and summer. Although it was ever a haunt of artists and writers there was always a table. On week nights we could walk in and get seated. Then came along Graydon Carter. The part ownership by Vanity Fair's EIC turned the Inn into a circus and celebrity zoo. Lines of limos, paparazzi, a big bouncer, and a ""no photography"" policy became de rigeur. All of the coziness of this Village charmer went away as did we and a lot of the old regulars. Fortunately, the hubbub died down and celebs stopped showing up. It's possible to get in here again. The food is as it ever was. Sadly the staff is still so arrogant (while ignorant) that it is unbearable. I'm praying that the Waverly will some day get the rehab that it needs and return to its original, welcoming ways. Carter's only great contribution is the quote at the head of the menu. Just like on the cover of VF he throws in sarcasm in the literal small print. ""Waverly Inn - worst food in the city"" Donald J. Trump",,,
86,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,817,371,5.0,5/30/2013,"Some 5 stars are ""as good as it gets"" FOR the kind of establishments they are, even if moderate or casual. Waverly is the ""you'll never forget your dinner and experience"" kind of 5 stars. The most romantic restaurant I've been to in Manhattan in 3 years, along with One if by Land, Two if by Sea. Gotham Bar and Grill will always be one of my favorite restaurants in any city but this is the ultimate anniversary, Valentine's Day, pop the question restaurant. Note: Yelp directions are wrong: you do NOT get off at 14th, or rather, not 14th Union Square. Spent 15 on a cab just from East to West Village and it truly lives up to the Village's maddening confusion for an uptown girl. I get below Union Square and forget about it. But all was forgiven once I stepped into this stunning old school (but not old) New York place on a brownstone street called Bank. I thought it would be more expensive than it was and if you get a salad and split and entree, this is not that much more than your average fine dining. Of course, if you have entree and appetizer (true of any restaurant), your bill will expand. We had Sancerre by the glass which was a mistake and we would have saved a good 35 or so by just ordering a bottle. But the Tuscan kale salad with light anchovy dressing, tiny croutons and pine nuts was so good (but I guess not vegan or vegetarian for the poor souls who can't or won't eat meat), it's a salad lover's fantasy or a salad for those who hate salad. My Park Slope friend tells me ricotta gnocchi is a NY thing but I've not seen it before. It's lighter than your average potato one and this is ""flash fried"" but I think that's misleading as a description. It was, by a long shot, the best gnocchi of my life and the spinach and parmesan exquisite. The ceilings are low and the murals on the wall of this dark, cozy dining room with a fireplace remind one a little of Sevilla, the old Spanish restaurant in the Village which takes no reservations. There is the cutest bar I've ever seen with some tables (I think these are reserved as well but am not sure) and about 7 stools clearly frequented by locals eating alone. (It's off the beaten path so it is not the kind of place people wander in from the street). In the back is a garden area: part of it is indoors with one of those vertical gardens I first saw at David Rubinstein Atrium off Lincoln Center along with a patio right out of Frances Hodgson Burnett.  The host and hostess were very nice when I rushed in from the cab 20 minutes late, but my friend had not arrived and they were cool. Apparently, I am not the first to get hopelessly lost trying to find a restaurant which was ""white hot"" as a friend of mine put it last year and nearly impossible to get in. Our server was top notch and older; Waverly Inn is not a place you wait tables at 30 between acting classes and auditions. These are seasoned veterans and they know everything about the menu and wine list. Rhubarb tart is not a tart really. It's more of a cobbler and it's very yummy but not your average fine dining American tart. I would have been happy eating two of the mini-loaves for dessert. If you love bread , it's worth a trip to this secret place JUST for the bread, which has a slight honey flavor which pairs well with the Sancerre we ordered (stupidly , by the glass which probably drove the bill up 35 bucks). There is nothing in LA or SB like this. We have many fine restaurants in both my two main cities of residence but if you want to feel like you're in NYC, take a cab down to Waverly. NOTE: NO pictures allowed, not of food nor of decor. I suppose if it's your birthday (or you are a regular who spends money here often), you could ask them to waive this policy. I understand why Jon A wrote this was his ""new favorite restaurant in the world, as charmingly and self-concsiously hyperbolic as that sounds.For two it was 140 pre-tip: one good-sized entree, two salads, 4 glasses of Sancerre and a dessert. As I said, we drank the same wine and should have ordered a bottle. It was not as bad as I thought in terms of price though we did split entree and didn't do the signature truffle mac and cheese.P.S. I didn't find it pretentious at all except for the no pictures thing. I mean it's not as though the murals are light sensitive and if you're paying this much to eat, you should be able to take pictures of the decor , your companions or the food (particularly if you blog about food and will sing their praises and bring them business)!",4,1,1

The skin was crispy but the meat was tender. I must say that it was second only to the duck I had at Montreal's Joe Beef.

For starters we had the Truffle Mac and Cheese which has fresh shaved black truffle on top. This is one of their specialties, but be prepared to pay a pretty penny. We also had the fois gras and beets which were both standard flavors IMHO. We had the Lobster Thermidor which was a bit on the tough side, but 2 lb lobsters tend to be chewier. Gruyere was nicely integrated though. My dinner mates had the tuna which was good but not particularly exciting. Ironically, the most surprising dish of the night was the side of carrots. They were roasted perfectly with a hint of smokey flavor that complemented the sweetness of the carrots. Overall, great ambience, nice date spot, decent food and flavors, but overpriced.",,,

First off, if your diet and wallet can afford that Mac and cheese appetizer they offer, it is surely a cheese and truffle bonanza.  If you're looking for something lighter, the crab cakes are the sure-fire runner up. For dinner, there is only 1 option in my opinion, the cheeseburger!  Save your coin, it won't buy you anything better than this. Be sure to request the truffle fries to accompany.The service in my opinion is really it's downfall.  I've sat, eaten my 2 courses in just under an hour due to their speed.  If we wanted fast food, we'd go to mcdonalds, so slow down and make it an experience.  The drinks are great though, and the bartenders are very friendly.Overall, we all know why we come here.

Yesterday, they were asking for 175$ a pop. I consider that as an insult and frankly just unacceptable.

It seems that every dish is exaggerated in one way or the other. My pork belly had too much vinegar. My husband's gnocchi was too billowy and too soft. The dessert had salted caramel sauce, and it was much too salty. They have definitely put too many tables in this restaurant, leaving you elbow-to-elbow with your neighbors, but this is just a New York thing.

Our waiter, when we could get him in an otherwise half-full dinning room, was aloof and at a loss to explain how they no longer serve a basic like jam nor toast to put it on. During breakfast. Oversized strollers crowd the narrow dinning space and small atrium (cranky babies included) while the music, usually a low distant jazz befit of the intimate setting, was replaced with Stevie Ray Vaughn at a rowdy pub volume. One fears if this assumed new management previously held court at a chain eatery. Any snark aside, Waverly, we've sincerely loved you just as you were. Your experience was absolutely perfect.

The wine selection was extensive and they had a few interesting beers in bottle. When we asked what exactly was in the pot pie out of curiosity, our server replied with ""everything"" in a snobbish tone and unwilling to continue to explain or answer our question. We got it anyway given the rave reviews. Then, our food arrived very quickly and way before our drink order was even on the table. Usually this is fine, but when we asked another server for our drinks our server finally came back with our beers and didn't even apologize. Also I'd think he'd pour it in a cup for us or at least offer. Hubbie got the pot pie which he found pretty tasty but nothing spectacular. He ate the whole thing.

The problem is that these items aren't any better than if you got them at a random restaurant anywhere. Granted, the Mac and cheese comes with truffles, but without them it tastes completely average and in no way remarkable- and it costs $150 pretax. Someone on yelp said it was $55, which is false. Apparently this place is taking a page from Nello's. Service was not attentive and the cocktail list is very short and not creative.

For dessert we had the apple crisp, one of the better renditions I have had in recent years.  Nice streusel topping!Service was excellent. Our waiter Rafael was very chill and knowledgeable about the menu.It was a nice experience all in all, but nothing that would compel a repeat visit when there are so many newer and more interesting places in NYC to try!",2,1,1

It's my go-to place regardless of weekend or weeknight. It casually impresses with a gorgeous interior and relaxing outside tables (both in the courtyard and on the street). Yes, there are countless wonderful restaurants across the price and cuisine spectra, but Waverly Inn is my favorite combination of great food, great drinks, great waiters, and the *feeling* that you're in NYC at a West Village restaurant. The vibe is very friendly, but not intrusive. You can have a nice time with the staff and be on a romantic date or out with a group of friends. You just feel NYC here. The burger, the salmon, the incredible melon salad, the fantastic lobster salad...it's all so good.

It's pretty obvious that unless you play the part of a douchey moneybag they will treat like dirt.As others mentioned the wait staff will grab your food away before you finish and without asking if you're finished. That's basic waitering 101 at any local diner. This happened twice with the food plates and it happened with my cocktail as well. Other reviewers mention this too so ours wasn't an isolated case.

The place is quaint and beautiful in the village but stops there. It's extremely hot, typical NYC village table squeezed so close you are eating with your neighbor. We didn't receive a bread basket - had to ask for it several times while the people next to us received there's upon sitting down. Service was just slow and selective. Again table next to us received multiple visits from service but they were loud and obnoxious ordering many things from the menu. I guess dropping $175 for 2 people for dinner/drinks by my fiancé wasn't enough for the waiter so we were treated 2nd class. Food was okay. He had the burger which he enjoyed and I had a wedge salad and crab cakes and thought it was good food. On the plus side they do know how to make a descent French 75.",1,,
141,Amanda P.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",31,37,13,3.0,8/2/2013,"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night. We initially had reservations for the conservatory, but when we got there they said there was a private event, and space requests are just considerations, not definite. Not cool.However, the restaurant's main room is beautiful. Murals line the walls, and you feel like you've been transported to another century. It was obvious that most of the people in the restaurant were on a date. Definitely dress to impress with this crowd.The waiter was great, and made the menu reading sound like he was telling a fairy tale. Our whole party opted for the truffle fries and gnocchi, which were good. Portions are pretty big, which makes the price tag seem a little less steep. Apparently the ketchup would be ""the best I will ever have,"" according to the waiter. It was meh.Overall, I enjoyed this place. The food was good, but not mindblowingly great. Service was quick and attentive.  I had my water glass filled about every ten minutes. Downside: no pictures in the restaurant. Dessert was $13 for a two scoops of sorbet (uh, what?). Didn't get the room we wanted, without the courtesy of a phone call informing us. I would definitely come back here on a date, but probably not otherwise.",3,,2
142,David R.,"Montclair, NJ",76,137,11,2.0,5/13/2013,"Celebrated National Hallmark Corporation Day (AKA Mothers' Day) here last evening, treated by local son and terrific recent bride. Found parking across the street, which was a plus. We basically were the first in and after a minor reservation kerfuffle, were seated at a lovely round table in the front corner. Our waiter was a pleasant chap who was attentive but not hovering, which I appreciated, and water glasses were refilled often by pleasant busboys.  We saw that there was a sign forbidding photography inside. Not really sure, except perhaps the owner wants to protect the intellectual property rights of the decorative murals: caricatures of well-known NY artists (the usual suspects: Warhol, David Bowie, etc.).I started with a wedge, which turned out to be more of a wedgette: think a few minor lettuce leaves arranged on a plate, concave side up, partially filled with a mixture of some sorta crumbly cheese, buttermilk, and lardons. They were tasty, but I was expecting a Ruth's Chris 1/4 head of Iceberg lettuce with really first-rate Maytag Bleu-Cheeze dressing, so I was a little disappointed. I think the menu description might be emended to say ""Our own idiosyncratic, not-quite a wedge, done in our unique minimalist style.""For my main, I ordered the much-lauded Chikn Pot Pie. Now, CPP is a favorite of mine 'cause it reminds me of my youth when my mother would occasionally take a stab at this elegant dish by combining left over chicken pieces she had forgotten to throw out the previous week with a can of baby peas (LeSeur), cemented together by mixing in a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup. We kids, and especially my big sister, accurately called this offering ""Chicken Glop,"" served on white toast wedges. Mmmm, good eatin'!(I want to interrupt this review to say that the best CPP I have had in years is served at the Hollywood Diner, northeast corner of 16th & 6th. It has a flaky Phyllo-like top and is served steaming hot with large pieces of white meat chicken, a tasty but not too-gloppy broth, peas and carrots, pearl onions and the strategic differentiating ingredient, pieces of pimento. Next time you're in the 'hood, grab yourself one.)The Waverly's version, in comparison, was, putting it charitably, not up to my mother's Chicken Glop. The initial presentation was a bit off-putting, as the traditional, GAPP (Generally Accepted Pastry Principles) had been ignored and the accepted and expected millefeuille pastry lid had been replaced by a sort of biggish round cracker that you might find in an Carr's Cracker Assortment customized for Andre the Giant. It was big, round, hard, and thin and barely covered the surface of the dish. So sad. Poor Andre. More fool I, hoping that the actual contents would put things right. The actual mixture was over-salted to the point of shame. Some white-meat chicken, some dark-meat chicken, lots of tiny mushroom pieces, and overall tasteless (except for the salt.) Really, Waverly people!Others at the table had the Crab Cakes: good but one of the two servings was cold and had to be sent back; the NY strip was ordered MR and was delivered Medium, so had to be sent back and another prepared. The back of the house needs some more supervision. There's just no excuse for one of two identical plates to be cold. And one in the party asked for her pea soup to be served steaming hot, but it was not and had to be sent back.  All this sending back for reheating and re-cooking throws off the rhythm of the meal and is symptomatic of a restaurant that has stopped caring.All-in-all, the company was great - we love our kids and always have a good time with them. That's really what matters; the food is really secondary - as it surely was in this case.On the other hand, we had a terrific meal Saturday night at John Andrews on Rt 23 in South Egremont, MA.

It was odd, but other wise the service was impeccable and the food was fantastic.  Prices are reasonable on first glance, but compared to portion size.. yea it is pricey.  We shared 3 appetizers, each had our own entree, and we shared 3 desserts.  We ended up being stuffed and could barely finish our desserts.  It was plenty of food.Their biscuits are legit biscuits - so buttery and so easy to devour.  We shared the octupus, the crab cakes, and the tuna tartare to start.  We totally cleaned each plate.For my main course I chose the ricotta gnocchi with truffle oil and mushrooms (truffle heaven, but heavy) and Alex had the chicken pot pie. Both were delicious. Everyone enjoyed their entrees.We shared the bananas foster, a solid chocolate and caramel creation and the strawberry rhubarb crisp - which was our absolute favorite.  It was so good!!The drinks were strong and the staff was very nice - everyone said hello/welcome on the way in and thank you/have a good night on the way out.  Would definitely come back for a special occasion again even though the hovering was odd towards the end of our meal.",3,,1

Ambiance:  Spectacular, especially around this time of the year.  It reminds me of the feeling I get when I enter Minetta Tavern or The Guard House (This is on the Main Line in PA).  Service: Simply awful.  I dine out about 3-4 times a week and it pains me to say this as I do realize being a server is a tough job.  I understand if a server is slow due to the restaurant being packed and/or the restaurant not having enough staff.  Most servers that are slow are usually super nice when they do finally come around which I think makes up for the sluggish service.  However this server had an attitude.  It was not only noticed by myself but also by the three other people I was dining with.  The most notable incident was when my friend took a bite of his ribeye and it was cold.  My friend politely got the servers attention and stated that the steak was cold.  The server with an attitude said in response, ""I don't know why it would be cold?"" as though my friend was lying.  The server should have said, ""I apologize"" and took the steak back to the kitchen.  It was pretty bizarre.  Also, the staff clearing the table was outrageously clumsy and whoever was pouring the water kept on pouring tap water into the sparking water glasses and vice versa.  No organization at all.  *If someone from the staff does in fact read this please note I do not use my real name.  However we were sitting at the four person table in the corner when you turn left to the left.  Our reservation was at 7:15PM last night.",,,

I don't know. She pulled some kind of magic.The decor is dark, dark, dark - and absolutely lovely.  For dinner, you're hopefully seated at a round table in the greenhouse next to the working fireplace, where ivy can dust your shoulders as you ogle fellow patrons spending ridiculous amounts of money on wine & truffled treats.Staff is top-notch, as they should be for a place of this reputation.  We had an excellent cabernet - Titus 2009 (Yes, I wrote down the name, it was that good.)  Only knock on the menu is the cocktail selection - super-manly and dark.  All rum, scotch, and 1 tequila drink - not really my tatste.The dishes were all good, but variable levels of excellence..So I'll highlight the standouts.  We started with grilled octopus (excellent and extra crispy), roasted beet and goat cheese salad (skip it, it's not that exciting,) PEI mussels with chorizo (also not that exciting, and a special addition to the menu that evening,) the gnocchi with truffles (I DIE) and the crab cakes (I DIE AGAIN.)  Get: octopus, gnocchi, crab cakes.On to entrees: Obviously had to try the absurdly indulgent truffled mac & cheese.  Would I order it if I were footing the bill personally? No.  Was I tempted to lick the plate? Yes. (Get it) Steamed dover sole: light and flavorful, this was a crowd-pleaser. (Get it)  Steak with mushrooms?

The bar is cozy and I suggest arriving early to have a drink there. They have a great selection of wines by the glass. We had the Pinot Noir from Napa (Ingrim?). We loved it so much, we ordered a bottle of it when we sat for dinner.We were seated in the ""garden"" room right next to the fireplace. It was very comfortable and I would highly recommend this room and seat location during the winter. Very cozy. The service was professional and fine. Their dishes are served as small or large plates.

The wine list is also on the pricey side, like I said this is a good spot for a special occasion or celebration... one's last night in this amazing city being quite the occasion to celebrate! The bar area is dark and romantic as well. Although sadly we didn't see any, I've heard this is a good place for celeb sightings as well. Food wise the appetizers were the highlight of the meal. The Foie Gras was rich and excellent. The Tuna Tartare was just as tasty and fresh as other Yelpers have mentioned and should not be missed. We also did a half dozen oysters for the table.I had the duck breast on special as my entree which came with a risotto and cherries on top.

160,Victoria G.,"New York, NY",35,136,21,5.0,9/30/2013,"Wow. Just, wow. And for this gal, that does NOT come easily.Having consistently topped my list of 'must-go's' I was fortunate enough to dine at Waverly not once, but twice in the last two weeks. (I know I know...patience is a virtue; good things come to those who wait, and all that jazz....) Each meal was absolutely incredible and I can confidently say that if I could (and could afford to), I'd return every single week. Not only is the food out of this world, but the ambiance of the indoor/outdoor patio is so stunning and transformative it begs for special occasions to be had, bottles of expensive champagne to be popped and memories made.ABSOLUTE MUSTS are the kale salad as well as the truffle mac. Honestly. For once, just once, ignore the hefty price tag and go for it. I indulged in both the black truffle as well as the first of the season white--each is death-row worthy, with an unctuous perfectly crisped top, and a heap of al dente macaroni nestled in a nutty-meets-slightly-sweet velvety cheese below. The truffles are delicately handled and shaved at the adept hands of Waverly's delightful (and super attentive) staff. Moving on, the duck (with enough heft to satisfy and a silkiness I've never had in any similar dish), the steak (cooked to medium-rare perfection with delish veggies) and the chicken (something I often shy away from) are each incredible in their own right. Both the duck and steak make a perfect duo for any meat lovers who opt to share, and the chicken is toothsome enough (and is accompanied by aromatic and uber rich potatoes that beg to be lapped up) to elevate it to another level--rivaling the NoMads and dare I say, Locanda V's. You really can't go wrong (and truth be told I'm dying to go back for the short rib special mmmm)Wines run the gamut from obscenely expensive to much more reasonably priced options--the Chianti Classico la Trame was just such an option, holding up spectacularly with lighter and heavier fare alike...proving to be a great middle ground between a lighter, more tannic cab and a richer more power-forward Italian red.Do yourself a favor and go here now. Sit in the back, either next to the fire or under the stars and indulge each and every one of the senses. It'll be an evening you won't regret and one you'll always remember.Just be sure to invite me. :-)",,,

164,Kels P.,"Manhattan, NY",10,54,5,4.0,5/23/2012,"I've been for both brunch and dinner and I'm very happy with Waverly! Brunch is probably my favorite meal of the day so here goes a few thoughts: Pros: 1) Food is definitely above average. My friends regularly order the merguez sausage (excellent), the dutch pancake (buttery, sweet and salty all at the same time - yum!) and the egg white sandwich (delish and remotely healthy? Im all over it). 2) Ambience. Located on a quiet, sunny street, try to snag one of the six or so outdoor tables if you can. There's also a nice greenhouse area in the back with a lot of light. Attracts a well-dressed and pretty hip crowd.3) Good service. They'd good about letting you sit and talk without interrupting you too often. I've always had good, prompt service and when a small mistake was made here or there it was always correctly quickly (e.g. once i ordered iced tea and the waiter brought iced coffe; it was corrected within minutes). Cons1) Bathrooms are TINY. As in, the elderly women behind me had trouble fitting into the stalls. 2) It can get expensive if you're not watching yourself much. My boyfriend once ordered the mac and cheese with truffles and it was $65. It was totally worth it - but it was more expensive than my usual velveta hehe.I love Waverly and I'll be back for sure!",4,2,2

I've had this before and its not even close to being worth $100. When we didn't order the mac n cheese, due to the obvious price, he questioned our order and said honestly, i would get less appetizers and get the mac n cheese. It was very uncomfortable having him push this on us. Then we asked about the crab cake to make sure it was fresh lump crab and not covered in bread crumbs, our waiter said assured us that its lump crab and does not have a lot of bread crumbs. When the crab cakes arrived it was the exact opposite of what he said, it was covered in bread crumbs and there was no sign of lump crab.Finally, when our burger came it was over cooked and the bun was 100% stale.I will not return to this place because of the rude service and extremely sub par food.",1,,

The Parmesan creme fresh felt out of place, but it was fine. I also ordered a pea veloute, which was pretty good though a little underseasoned. The cooked mushrooms brought the soup to life, but the rest of the soup, including the pea purée base, weren't used creatively.The real problem was out main dishes. My friend ordered a medium burger, which was rare (a deep red). My girlfriend got pappardelle with a lamb ragout, which was either not cooked long enough or made with too much flour because it was unpleasantly way too al dente. I caught a break with my chicken pot pie, which was mostly fine, but did contain a couple large bites of cartilage. It's worth noting that this place is known for its Mac and cheese, which is $125 for a crock, so we opted not to order it.

175,Vern W.,"New York, NY",20,52,12,3.0,1/1/2012,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  But I think that part of this comes from it being potentially expensive.  So I'll factor that out for a moment. The space is beautiful.  Essentially the garden section of a NYC townhouse that extends back into a larger space that may have been an indoor garden or livery space with brick walls and high glass ceilings. It has a charm that would take one back a century or two. Very nice. But don't try taking any pictures.  It's not allowed!The service was top notch.   Our waiter was helpful, and very professional. It was clear that the restaurant has a way of doing things and demands excellence from its staff. The food was good, I had the chicken pot pie.  It was not the best that I'd ever had, nor was it the worst.  It was solid. I was going to have the Mediterranean vegetable platter, but was glad that I did not. It looked very beautiful, but would not have sufficed as an appetizer for me. forget about it as an entree. I forget what our other dining companions had, but they came from the pricier side of the menu. I think that with the four entrees and the beverages (soda for me, wine for the others) the bill came up to about $300. So here's where we go to why I am not a fan. What you are paying for is an eclectic form of fine dining. And fine dining is great ... it is something that one should do for oneself at least once in a blue moon. If that is what you want, and money is no object. This would be a great place to do it. The restaurant does it in a very warm earthy environment. If you think that paying over $100 for macaroni and cheese is pretentious (and to be fair their mac and cheese has white truffle in it) This would not be the place for you.  As someone who usually eats at home or in diners, going here (not my idea) threw me for a loop since it was not what I was expecting. If money is no object for you, you are on a super model diet, and you want a warm environment that still feels like the dining experience you would get at a top notch hotel, I would definitely recommend it.I only ask that you tell me if that mac and cheese is worth it!  It sounds good, but I could not justify the expense.",5,2,1

The service is excellent and attentive. But I give it only 3 stars for the food. There is nothing innovative about the menu. It is very expensive comfort food, served in small portions.  A chicken pot pie, macaroni and cheese or a hamburger and fries are over $20.00! If I want to pay $150.00 for two of us for dinner I don't want macaroni and cheese that I can prepare at home, thank you very much! Regardless of the truffles! They have a very extensive upscale wine list. It was a challenge to find a bottle on the menu for under $100.00!I ordered  the sea bass which appeared to be the most innovative entree on the menu.

I'll cut to the chase. Ordered wedge salad, burger and octopus and trout. Most of it was really good. Girlfriend was unimpressed with trout but all in all the food was very tasty. Biscuits are standout as well. But the meal was over way too fast. I had to actually slow down while eating my burger to make sure I was in my chair for at least 60 minutes.As many have noted the restaurant is extremely cramped.

There are lots of cozy corners. The garden is magnificent. If you are a serious oenophile, you will appreciate the wine list.  The setting is 4 stars.  The food is maybe 2 stars, and that is without considering the *zowie* prices.  The dover sole with steamed vegetables was comparable to the similar specials Upstate or Souen in the East Village, except at Upstate or Souen it is 18 or 22$. At Waverly it was 60$. It did come at Waverly with a ramikin of hollandaise sauce. I'm of the mind that if you have a nice piece of fish lemon and salt and pepper are enough, you don't need to bury it in hollandaise. The fricassee corn appetizer special was the best thing we ordered: fresh and delicious.  The pasta entree could have been served at a nice hospital cafeteria: its roasted red peppers were fine but the orecchiette was bland and lukewarm.",1,1,

The first  couple years The Waverly was packed with A List Celebrities just about every night, not as much any more. The place still has a wonderful ambiance created by Goode and Carter, taking a great old space, not changing anything much, and sprucing it up in just the right fashion, same as Keith McNally did with the similar venerable old Minetta Tavern about 12 blocks from the Waverly. Though the Waverly Inn is not the Hot Spot it once was, it's still pretty darn good, mainly for the ambiance.

192,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",67,150,838,4.0,8/21/2011,"My girlfriend and I came here two nights ago for dinner. Despite the fact that it was a Friday, we were able to make a 6:15pm reservation via Open Table with only three or four hours to spare. We arrived just before our reservation and were warmly greeted by the hosts standing just inside the main door of the bar area, which with its dark wood paneling, fireplace, tables set below the windows and grand bar setup, has a very cozy feel to it.We were escorted into the dining room, which had an atmosphere similar to the bar room, with its decorative murals on the wall and dark wood paneling. The seating varied from booth style to lone tables. After walking halfway into the dining room, the host stopped and explained that this was the main dining room, but they also had outdoor garden seating in the back, then asking which we would prefer. After looking at the garden, we decided to sit there. I would have to disagree with what others have said about the garden being ""Siberia,"" but perhaps that's moreso in the cold winter months. On a warm summer night in August, at 6:15pm, the main dining room was basically empty and the garden room had much more life and activity to it.After being seated, our waiter, whose name was Zachary, asked us if we'd like still, sparkling or tap water. We opted for tap water with lemon before looking over the menu, wine and cocktail list. To drink, I opted for the Waverly Lemonade, which was made of gin, agave, cayenne pepper and I forget what else - maybe some lemon juice and cane sugar. It was a good drink and with a price tag of $14, it's mixed quite strongly. Between the alcohol and the cayenne pepper, it packed a punch and I consumed it over our entire meal, including dessert. As for my gf, she had the Lime Rickey, which was also good, tho more or less just an $8 glass of limeade.After we ordered our drinks, Zachary explained the specials and there were quite a few. He then brought some freshly made biscuits, which were small yet warm and buttery - in other words, delicious. When we finally got down to deciding on our food, we opted to start with some oysters, which were off the specials. They had Blue Points, Barron Points and Kumamotos. They offered two of each for $25, but we opted for two of the Barron Points and two of the Kumamotos, which are both West Coast Oysters. The West Coast oysters ran $4.25 per oyster, while the Blue Points from Long Island were perhaps $3.25 or $3.50 each. Anyways, were the oysters worth it? Absolutely and without a doubt.For our main course, I had the Braised Rabbit and she had the Roasted Amish Chicken. Both were excellent, tasty and flavorful. The rabbit came with fava beans, chanterelles and house made pappardelle. The pasta was delicious as well and perfectly cooked. All aspects of the dish went very well together, although it came in a bit of a cream sauce, that while not overwhemling, was probably a case of ""less is better.""My gf's chicken was equally as good and came with morel mushroom and mashed potatoes. The distinguishing factor of the chicken was how they left the skin on one side only and cooked it to be crispy, while the rest of the meat was not dried out at all, but was juicy and flavorful.For dessert, we shared the Bananas Foster, which unfortunately, could not be set afire and flambed. Instead, the bananas were drizzled with rum and caramel, before being baked in the oven in an iron skillet. It was then topped with vanilla ice cream. YUM!!!Our waiter, Zachary, also came by our table often to make sure all was well and to see if we needed anything. Towards the end of dinner, the skies let open with torrential rain, thunder and lightning. I asked Zachary if our table was needed or if we could wait out the rain. He said we could wait out the rain, tho we did not want to overstay our welcome and left before the rain stopped. I'd say the service here was perfect and not pretentious or condescending as others have noted.The prices were also very reasonable. For our oysters, rabbit, chicken and dessert, our total was only $88. After, drinks, tax and tip were added on, it was obviously a bit more, but still, not bad at all.The only real negative to the evening were people sitting a table or two down from  us, who were complaining that the Wavery Inn isn't as exclusive as it once was. The only other place I've overheard people complaining about exclusivity was Le Cirque, during Restaurant Week Winter 2011.While my experience here was well worth it, it does seem that the restaurant is still being somewhat selective. As we were leaving, a woman walked in asking for a table. She was told the restaurant was full, which would've been fine if the place had been full, but there were plenty of empty tables, including all the tables in the bar area and a good amount of tables in the dining room. Since the Inn's phone number is now public and they are on Open Table, just make a reservation :)",3,,

The atmosphere is divine and romantic - a roaring fireplace in the wooden entry room, and candles and christmas lights in the main dining room.The waiter was extremely well knowledge on the menu and answered many of our questions. He gave us a very long time to decide on our food, and gave great suggestions. The table next to us talked to the restaurant sommelier for the perfect wine pairing with our dinner. We even dined in the midst of a very famous actor.The restaurant put a candle in my dessert, which was the chocolate mousse cake. It is small portioned, but the food is very rich so that is all you can really eat. I also ordered the beet salad, which was delicious but did not contain enough beets. The roasted amish chicken was so tender and flavorful, but it came with a piece of white meat and an equally large piece of dark meat. As I am not a fan of dark meat at all, I could not eat this piece, which was half of the plate. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something special and memorable.",1,,1
196,John R.,"New York, NY",64,347,0,4.0,7/3/2012,Brunch here is very good.  Try the pear pancakes.The restaurant is one of the nicest decorated places I've ever seen.  The courtyard at the back is really nice too.,,,
197,Caio M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,0,2.0,3/3/2014,"Food is good, but not outstanding, and service is... careless, to say the least. Plates were taken before we finished, had to order espressos 3 times to get them, gave them two cards to split the check, they returned one and charged everything to the other. Can't imagine why, in a city with so many options, one would waste time and money to be treated as an annoyance.",1,,
198,Bonnie B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,31,0,2.0,3/30/2015,"Very nice ambience and  very romantic. However, the food was just awful. It was so oversalted that I had to drink a gallon of water when I came home. The waiter was not very friendly and I found the whole place very overpriced and snobbish. It's for the wannabes.",3,,
199,Helen B.,"New York, NY",97,277,0,4.0,10/23/2011,"3.5 stars..My friend took me here for my birthday and it was good. The service is great and the crowd is a scene, but I don't feel it's pretentious..or maybe I have just lived in NYC for so long now that it doesn't matter to me.It's definitely romantic here, so I recommend taking a gf or bf for romantic date. The food is good, we had the octopus and tuna tartar to start and I had a great steamed sea bass. My friend had the rabbit and we finished with a crumble.The cocktails are great and they have a great selection of wine. It was a nice evening. Great service and really cozy when the weather gets cool outside.. it's a nice evening here.",2,,
