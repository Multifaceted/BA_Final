I absolutely agree.I've been there three times now, and already have reservations to go back again in December. The place is small -- so you definitely want to make a reservation in advance. The service is outstanding, from the person who greets you to the servers to the folks who clear the tables.We had an avocado salad that was so fresh with a dressing that literally surprised me and the person I shared it with. Surprised us like, stop yourself in the middle of your sentence and say, ""Holy [profanity], this is ridiculously good dressing!"" And come on -- who talks about salad dressing...?The pastas we had were delicious -- I had the ravioli with butter and sage; heavenly! My friend had something with a meat sauce, which she said was just as delicious.I don't often have dessert at dinner, especially after having eaten pasta -- but mama had had a day... So we ordered the cannoli. Oh my gosh. Light, flavorful -- a perfect end to a perfect meal.And if you are a wine drinker, I highly recommend either the Sangiovese or the Montepulciano di Abruzzo. Excellent wines both!",1,,1

Our server was Pablo and he was very kind, extremely attentive, and even comped our dessert because it was my birthday.I got the All'Astice lobster pasta which was astounding. I was so shocked at the amount of lobster meat present. They did not skimp.My girlfriend got seafood stuffed squid ink ravioli which was the special for the night and was also delicious. She raved about how incredibly light and fluffy the dough was.Highly recommend Il Corso. 5 Stars.",,,
2,Wei S.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",217,87,2,4.0,10/21/2018,"Came here on a Friday night around 7:30pm with 1 other person and we were seated immediately. The restaurant is small and intimate - definitely good for date night! Overall, dishes are fairly pricey but you get a decent portion and the food is wonderful! We ordered the calamari (came with shrimp, artichoke, and dates too), the wild boar ragu, and I can't remember the last dish but it was made of a pistachio sauce! Would say the favorite is the wild boar ragu: very fresh pasta, chunks of meat (versus typically shredded), relatively light - would recommend!Overall great experience and great service but would probably only go for a special event versus a casual dinner.",,,
3,Roger E.,"Henderson, NV",0,116,2,4.0,11/20/2018,"Very good, creative, Italian food.Try the grilled Octopus.  Excellent service. Perfect for a quiet, romantic dinner. The chiefs specials should not be overlooked.  Nothing fancy, but if your looking for a "" Godfather"" type atmosphere, you will be happy you came here.",,,
4,Kara Y.,"New York, NY",18,80,202,3.0,9/17/2017,"3.5 stars. Rounded down because our dinner was slightly overpriced for what it was. The restaurant is narrow but has two sections, decor is nice and classy. The waiter, was nice, but got my order wrong (originally ordered fettuccine bolognese), I didn't make a big deal out of it since I also like seafood pastas (he ordered me the spaghetti de mare). It's funny because he also got the orders of the table near us wrong - maybe it's time to invest in a notepad? Anyway, we ordered the calamari for appetizer and it was average. My bf ordered the lobster pasta (paccheri all'astice) and although the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce lacked flavor and influence from the lobster pieces that it came with. My seafood pasta was alright, thought it needed more seasoning. Overall, the food is average and seems to be on the blander side, and the portion was small. It was a nice dinner but I will not be returning.",1,1,1
5,Lynn S.,"Alexandria, VA",147,842,294,4.0,3/1/2018,"Excellent small restaurant except for the boring bread basket. Fantastic service, great fried calamari appetizer (perfect for sharing). The quality here is high and the prices are fair. The menu had fish, chicken & pasta choices, less meat. I was unimpressed with their bread basket.As far as we could tell most of the other diners were repeat customers, always a positive sign. Quite a surprise to find this little gem in midtown Manhattan.Tip: Loving parmesan cheese, I sprinkled it on the linguine vongole. Don't do it! The clams are salty enough on their own, and delicious.",1,,1

Relatively small inside but roomy enough where you don't feel cramped. Service was great and the food was outstanding.I had the Ortolana salad (Mixed Baby Lettuce, Fennel, Balsamic Dressing) to start and the presentation was amazing with the salad ingredients themselves creating a bowl on a flat dish. For the main course I had a lightly (as in very lightly) breaded and fried monk fish over spinach that was truly amazing.",2,,1
7,Jesse N.,"Manhattan, NY",401,84,23,5.0,6/26/2017,"WOW! This place blew me away. My mom was visiting in town as part of her belated birthday celebration so I took her out for dinner before we went to see Kinky Boots on Broadway. The only requirement I had was that she wanted italian. I originally wanted to take her to L'Artusi, but they didn't have any dinner reservations for when we wanted to eat, so I started hunting and stumbled upon Il Corso. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't had italian food in a long time, but this was some of the best italian I've had in a while (probably since I went to L'Artusi actually!) My mom and I ordered drinks and I had the Ahhh Perol (an Aperol and grapefruit juice cocktail) while she had the sangria. Both drinks were strong but very delicious. As a starter, my mom and I split the Beet Salad which was beautifully paired with frisee, chopped hazelnuts, and a goat cheese cream and it was fantastic. Then for dinner my mom had the butternut squash ravioli (phenomenal), and I had the cacio e pepe which was served in a parmesan crisp formed into a bowl. I have never inhaled pasta so fast in my life. The service was amazing and our waiter was extremely helpful in choosing what to eat. Definitely recommend this restaurant if you're having a night out on Broadway or at Radio City. Some seriously amazing italian food.",3,,

The place was fresh with only a dozen reviews or so then and I chose this place. Food was great. Short ribs were amazing and just melted in my mouth. Sometimes there's only a few foods/tastes/smells that you can remember and it takes you back in time. The short ribs are on that list for me. Years later and I can still remember that they were so good. I think the ambiance of the room was a bit dark and maybe a bit quiet. Service was good and not pushy.",,,

I'm not much of a wine drinker so I asked the waiter for a decent white which turned out to be a great call.Service was perfect, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable when you consider everything together.It CAN get noisy but it wasn't unbearable and we were able to have a conversation without having to really raise our voice.

15,Katie B.,"Portland, OR",46,581,490,3.0,1/3/2018,"To be honest, our dining experience at Il Corso was fairly forgettable. The food was good, but not great.  We had a beet salad and burrata to start, followed by various pasta dishes and the short rib. The pastas were a great al dente, but the sauces were a little too heavy for my taste. The service was odd, with our server disappearing for long periods, and our seating was cramped. The dining room was also sweltering - we were all starting to sweat a little and wanting to leave before the meal was over. For the price point and the level of service, I would not come back. It was a non-descript, standard, slightly overpriced Italian dinner.",1,,2
16,Robert F.,"Brookline, MA",0,20,14,5.0,7/29/2018,We had beautifully presented and perfectly prepared salads and pastas.  If you like pasta with mushroom and creamy sauce try theirs. A generous portion with some garlic for a nice tangy flavour.  The split pea soup was prepared with some potato and herbs.  The capanado was freshly prepared and chunky.  We saw other dishes going to neighbouring tables and regretted our inability to eat more.  We didn't have any desserts because they didn't seem to be anything special - but mostly because we'd have to put it in our pocket cause we were thoroughly stuffed. There are so many fine restaurants it's hard to think about returning but Il Corso is on our New York A-list.  Enjoy.,,,

24,Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",848,301,730,4.0,5/20/2016,"Came here to celebrate one of my coworker's last day in the company. Had a reservation for 6:00pm, but ended up pushing it to around 6:15pm/6:30pm.. because you know how it is, you can't always leave the office when you expect to. The staff was very nice and accommodating about moving our reservation/being a little late. When we got there, around 6:15pm the place was pretty much empty except for a couple of tables.. after all, it is an early dinner.The restaurant is pretty small, a couple of intimate seating in the front and much larger group tables available in the back. The bathroom is all the way in the back as well, one stall for men and one stall for women. This place is.. frankly, extremely crowded. Our server, whose name I forgot, was very knowledgeable about the menu as well as the specials. The specials were so long and detailed that I pretty much lost him in his words, and just decided to look at the menu instead. I chose the salmon as my entree and we had some type of mozzarella cheese with a puree and calamari for appetizers. The mozzarella cheese literally melts in your mouth and it was nice to eat, though I am not a huge fan of cheeses. The calamai was very lightly battered, but it was very good. The squid taste was still prevalent against the batter, and the sauce complimented it nicely. These are truly appetizer portions, regretfully! The calamari was soo good!!Everyone at my table got pasta(their specialty) except for me, in which I decided to get the salmon. The salmon came with a side of mashed potatoes on a bed of spinach. The mashed potatoes were delicious, creamy.. everything that you would want your dream mashed potatoes to be. It proved to be the highlight of my plate. The salmon was a hugeee piece, and although it wasn't terrible.. I wouldn't say that it was anything to rave about either. Not buttery, melt in your mouth that you would anticipate. The bed of spinach was salty, but to my liking.For dessert, they bring out a platter of dessert displays that you can choose from. This is unique and appreciated over the traditional menu. We got the creme brûlée which was perfect!! I highly recommend this, and the cannoli which I did not try.Overall, the meal for 4 people's entree and two desserts and two appetizers came out to $163 and change, which isn't too bad but definitely more expensive than what you would normally spend on a dinner. This is a great, intimate place to splurge your money! I probably wouldn't come back but my experience here was very pleasant!",4,3,4
25,Joshua G.,"Austin, TX",196,40,6,5.0,3/30/2018,"We had a $275 humble lunch for 4 here. It ain't cheap, but it's everything I imagined New York to be. Their ravioli special was awesome, as was the wine and service. Definitely check it out if you're not on a tight budget and in the area.",,,
26,Dee M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",1,18,15,5.0,8/14/2018,Absolutely amazing dinner!   Homemade Pasta cooked to perfection.  The cherry tomato sauce was simply delicious.  They threw in some grilled eggplant and spinach since I am vegetarian.   My date had the seafood spaghetti.   Spaghetti was once again cooked to perfection.   For dessert we shared a chocolate mousse with vanilla ice cream.   The service was very attentive and the ambiance was amazing.   We even bumped into some authentic Italian tourists and the conversation with them transported us to Italy as we were getting ready to leave.  All in all a wonderful experience.,,,

I had a pasta dish with clams, oysters, and calamari in it, and my mom had the Parmesan pasta bowl. Both pasta dishes were great, but the star of the meal was definitely the tiramisu!

30,Melanie S.,"Chicago, IL",682,885,451,5.0,9/25/2015,"How can such a terrific place in NYC have so few reviews? Frankly, I'm rather shocked, especially for an establishment that's been around for over twenty years!Yep, Il Corso is a real find.To be fair, it wasn't *my* find. I read the effusive review of fellow Yelper (and namesake), Melanie B., back in June, and filed it away in the crevice of my brain reserved for things that I want to try in the future. (Or maybe I just bookmarked it.)As luck would have it, I was planning on taking my mommy to NYC for a mother-daughter weekend in mid-September; it was the first reservation I made. I just knew this place would be perfect for our first dinner.And it was.It's kind of small and cozy, and it just oozes charm. If you weren't specifically looking for it, you just might walk right past it.But don't.We started with bellinis (because when in Rome, right?), that were flawless, and a perfect pick-me-up after a long afternoon of walking, shopping, and more walking.We moved on to a special appetizer of fried zucchini blossoms, stuffed with homemade ricotta and parmegiano reggiano. This is something I don't come across very often, so how could I not order it? The real question is why did I not order two? The zucchini blossoms were delicately battered and fried, and the two cheeses combined into one oozy, creamy, explosion of deliciousness. If they happen to have this, do not miss it.My mom had the cacio e pepe, which is fairly common in an Italian restaurant. I make this at home sometimes. This minimalist dish is basically pasta, cheese, and fresh pepper. With so few ingredients, they all need to be the highest quality.And of course they were. The ""bowl"" the pasta came in was a basket of parmegiano reggiano! Let that sink in for a minute.An edible basket of cheese! What could be more wonderful?!I opted for something heartier, and chose the pork tenderloin with sauteed wild mushrooms, finished with a marsala glaze, and served with roasted fingerling potatoes. I all but licked the plate clean.I was secretly hoping they would have one of my favorite Italian desserts on the menu, which is panna cotta. Tiramisu is ubiquitous, but panna cotta, not so much. Glory be! Not only did they have it, but it came with mixed berries and raspberry sauce. I died and went to heaven.The service is warm. The atmosphere is endearing. The food is superlative; I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.Even though I typically make a point to *not* return to a restaurant I've already tried when I go on vacation, I will most definitely return to Il Corso next time I'm in Manhattan.",14,6,9

33,Lisa T.,"Rockaway, NJ",36,330,48,3.0,12/18/2017,"Came in on a busy Saturday evening and were sat promptly as we had a reservation. Service was a mixed bag. Sometimes we would struggle to flag someone down, other times they were hovering over us, pouring more wine or water as soon as anyone took one sip. The restaurant was also uncomfortably warm for a winter evening. We asked the waiter if there could be anything done about the heat and he just shrugged and said this is just how it is, that there was nothing he could do. The food was mediocre at best. Calamari appetizer was good, we enjoyed the fried dates; the avocado artichoke appetizer was not what I expected, very unique but very tasty nonetheless. Overall the table felt the food was underwhelming. I had the mushroom risotto with fois gras. The fois gras was amazing, cooked well and flavorful, perfect grill marks and a bit smokey. However, the risotto was a soupy mess and the rice itself was undercooked. Some of us enjoyed their meals (ravioli special; wild boar ragu pasta) while others were disappointed (fish didn't taste fresh). I don't think we'll be back.",,,

He took our orders, made recommendations, made my friend's cocktail exactly to her liking, and worked so amazingly well with the rest of the staff to make everything transition throughout the meal so smoothly.The meal.

No joke, our Uber almost passed it, it's so easy to miss, but make sure you don't.I had the wild boar Ragu on pappardelle, the spaghetti with Parmesan and olive oil in a Parmesan bowl, and the seafood spaghetti. My friend got the salmon and another pasta dish and they both looked to die for. We also shared the calamari and IT IS SO GOOD.But that homemade pappardelle had to be one of my most favorite bites of food. You can't beat the bite of fresh pasta and its texture.There's just so much to say but too little time. I would go back in a heartbeat!OMG HOW DID I FORGET THE PANNA COTTA.

Cacio E pepe - Served in a parmesan cheese basket.  Gave it a nice and different texture, however I've had better (even with the cheese basket).  Still good, but you can definitely get better in the city Ragu Papardelle - very flavorful and tasty.  Not mind-blowing, but done well.  Tiramisu - this was the standout in my opinion.   Not overpowering with the coffee flavor.  Done just right.  Also perfect to share for 4 people. Nutella pie (not what it was actually called on the menu, but you'll know what I'm talking about ;) ) - I guess I described it this way because thats exactly what it tasted like... pie crust with nutella slapped onto it and then chilled.  Add a few hazelnuts and there you go.  Skip this.  All in all a decent place to check out if  you're in the area and not in the mood to wait.  Only thing that would bring me back would be the tiramisu!",1,1,1

For tomatoes not to be in season they tasted as if they were just picked from the vine and the mozzarella and prosciutto felt like they were directly imported from Italy. We also ordered a spinach salad and even that was delicious. The crispy prosciutto was such a great touch For the main courses we got the Cacio e Pepe and lasagna. The Cacio e Pepe was beautifully presented and had amazing flavor. Not too much pepper and the pasta was perfectly cooked.

This little hidden restaurant in Midtown is one of my favorites.Love their linguini with veal and pork ragú. Yes, judge me for eating veal. I don't eat it often, but sometimes a girl just can't stop herself!  The short ribs are worth every calorie as well as their prosciutto truffle ravioli. Gnocchi is always my standby, and while I absolutely love theirs, there are so many delicious entrees to choose from, I would be remiss to choose the ""safe"" option.Don't mind the fact that there's often a long wait and there's no place to stand; their cherry tomato sauce will make up for it.

The service was perfect. Absolutely nothing I would change. Very gracious. And the food was excellent. I started with a special soup - a chilled carrot and orange bisque with croutons. After powerwalking the hot streets, it was really refreshing. Great flavor. I'm also a sucker for a simple spaghetti pomodoro, so I went for the spaghetti in a cherry tomato and basil sauce. It was just what I wanted. I don't know why I can't seem to get a plate of pasta like that in Minnesota, but I'll carry that memory with me until I find myself back in NYC.",,,

57,Ashley G.,"Hartford, CT",179,87,157,3.0,4/12/2016,"I was in NYC for a conference with my friend and we were craving a cute little Italian place for dinner. We found II Corso which was close to our hotel so it worked out perfectly. I will start off by saying that the food is absolutely phenomenal. Very authentic, delicious, decent portions, and satisfying. We shared an appetizer, the burrata cheese (AMAZING!), I had the gnocchi for dinner, and tiramisu for dessert. Everything was delicious, it's a little bit expensive, but it's NYC so it's to be expected. However, here is why I give a 3 star review...the service was really inconsistent. It was great in the beginning, very attentive, asking us if we liked everything, more water/drinks, ect. But after we finished dinner, our server disappeared for like 45 minutes, We even looked around for him and he was at the back of the restaurant and after making eye contact with him, he turned around and walked in the other direction. It was so strange! Then a different server came over and asked if we needed something and we said we wanted to order dessert. He told us our server would be right with us. Then our server finally came over and asked if we ordered dessert....well no, you just ignored us for almost an hour! So we ordered dessert and they forgot my friend's tea, but at that point, we were already disappointed... So to summarize, if the food wasn't good, my experience would have been a 0. But if the service was good, my experience would have been a 5, the food was amazing. The service was just inconsistent and left us feeling disappointed.",1,,

62,Steve V.,"Dallas, TX",11,60,2,4.0,10/16/2015,"We were directed here by a bartender at Cock & Bull on 45th. We were looking for somequality NY Italian without having to get overly dressy or blow a ton of money.I'm glad we went. It was a Tuesday around 7pm, our last night of our vacation in NYC, and we were sat immediately, no reservation. The restaurant was still busy though. I think we must have gotten there just in time to avoid a wait.It's a little small but big enough that there was a 20 top being served next to us.Service was excellent. The staff was cordial yet fast and efficient.The food:Started with the Calamari Dorati  (fried calamari)I loved the flavor of the crust and the dipping sauce. The calamari was fresh but it was a little too al dente. Not horrible or uneatable ... just maybe over cooked a smidge. We still ate it all and I really didn't feel like it was worth making a deal over it. Mainly because the sauce was soooo good.Main Course:Costicine Di Bue Al Vino Rosso (Braised boneless beef short ribs, red wine reduction, mashed potatoes)I really enjoyed this. The short ribs were tender and flavorful. The sauce went very well with the mashed potatoes. Fettuccine Alla Bolognese (Flat noodle, bolognese beef ragu)My wife ordered this one. She though it was good. I thought it was fresh and light tasting yet for me a little muted in flavor. I know a Bolognese sauce is supposed to be mild... but after tasting the sauce from the calamari, I wanted more of that flavor.Overall, I'm glad we went to Il Corso, I would recommend to anyone looking for Italian in the midtown area. Prices were very reasonable for being in NYC and for the quality of the food and service.",3,,1
63,Jeffrey P.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,7,5,5.0,1/4/2016,"We were staying in mid-town and was after some Italian cuisine. We looked around and on Yelp and decided that we would go here as it was a short walk from Rockefeller centre. We went there around 8:45 on a Sunday night and were sat down immediately. Bonus!Our waiter was super polite and attentive. Their menu had a great selection, and their specials of the day was very substantial. I'd suggest to have the waiter to slow down and go over some the specials, as there were quite a few. The wine selection really complemented the meals.The ambience was very intimate with dimmed lighting and romantic music playing over the speakers.At the end of the night, we were surprised with the price of the meal, as we felt like we splurged a bit, with having a main and shared a salad with a few glasses of wines each. The bill was reasonably priced, and the quality of the food surpassed my expectations",1,,

Arugula, baby spinach, frisée, and romaine. Very simply dressed with a little olive oil and lemon. That's as it should be, too many salads today are loaded with too much stuff and overdressed with a gloppy gooey dressing. This is also the way my Italian step-father dresses his salads. It was a nice, light start to the meal.My bolognese was cooked to a perfect al dente. It was delicious, and arrived to the table piping hot.My wife ordered the special ravioli of the night. Goat cheese and pear filled, with a parmesan cream sauce and topped with walnuts and arugula. She complained that the filling didn't taste of goat cheese. But it was amazing nonetheless. The cream sauce was especially delicious. I wanted to lick her plate it was so good.Next time we are in the city we'll be sure to stop back at Il Corso again for dinner.",3,,1
65,KT Tershowski I.,"Tampa, FL",414,133,147,5.0,7/14/2014,"I have been here several times with colleagues and friends.  I absolutely LOVE this restaurant.  It's a very quaint and cozy restaurant and in a great location from the office.  Atmosphere (5/5):  Rather small quarters, but makes for a quaint and cozy seating.  The restaurant is decorated very eloquent with oil and watercolor paintings provided with suitable seating. Service (5/5):  The servers are great.  They check up on you, your water and drinks are always filled and they are very attentive.Food (4/5): I have never ordered anything I dislike.  The only reason I gave the food four stars is because the food is rather pricey -- appetizers are basically as much as the main course.  The portion sizes are generous.  The preparation is nicely done.  Food has always been brought out in a reasonable timeframe.  I would recommend ordering the burrata, carpaccio di manzo and carpaccio di tonno for appetizers.  Gnocchi alla siciliana or risotto ai pocini for dinner are my favorites.  The wine selection is high quality, but not too many options. If you are looking for authentic quality Italian food, this is the place.  You won't go wrong with this restaurant.",4,,

It's an intimate Italian place in midtown that was busy even mid-week the day after Valentines Day. The service was excellent - the waiter allowed me to try a glass of wine I'd never had before to make sure I liked it. We had the burrata, two pasta dishes, a side of brussels sprouts, cheesecake, and tiramisu. The food was fantastic. My only gripe was that the special pasta I ordered (which I liked less than the non-special pasta my fiancee ordered) was far more expensive than the other pasta dishes on the menu (including one that was virtually identical except for one ingredient). I can't fault the restaurant entirely for that, I could have/should have asked the waiter the price but the premium was more than I expected. Lesson learned.",,,

Since it was the middle of the lunch rush, it was pretty noisy. I ordered the ravioli special which had spinach and artichoke and surprisingly swordfish. I try to stick to a vegetarian diet, so when I asked my waiter what the ravioli had it in, he didn't say the swordfish, just the spinach and artichoke in a white wine sauce (I think) so I was excited to try it. However, I was so hungry so I ate it anyway. The wait wasn't long, I was just starving.Otherwise, my glass of sparkling water was never empty and the food was delicious! Very light but impactful flavor and you don't feel gross after you're done eating. The lentils and olive oil with bread served before the meal came out was new for me as well.This place is not cheap! The bill for 4 of us was $146. We got two bottles of sparkling water and 4 entrees and thats it so don't be too shocked when your bill comes. Unless you got money like that and $146 is chump change for you. My FAVORITE part of my dining experience was not only the coat check, but also the fact that the hostess brought this miniature chair next to my table for my purse! I was so happy because I have an expensive bag and i was not keen on putting it on the floor and it didn't hang on my chair. I'll definitely go back here again!

The food and service was really good. I got the lobster tube pasta and my wife got the gnocchi. Although the portions are not huge like in other southern Italian restaurants it was enough to be filling and very tasty. I tried some of my wife's gnocchi and it was the best I've ever tasted.

84,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,200,300,3.0,4/8/2017,"Dined here on a Saturday evening with a reservation. First, the good. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is extremely relaxed and comfortable, at least in the back room where we were seated which also appears to be considerably quieter than the front room. The food, however varies greatly. We began with the tuna tartare special and the salad Ortolana. My dining partner indicated that the Tuna Tartare was excellent. I normally order tuna tartare but didn't order this one since it had a multitude of ingredients and I prefer my tuna tartare simple. My Salad Ortolana looked beautiful. But it turned out to be nothing more than a mixed salad with a very vinegary vinaigrette with cucumber slices wrapped around it. It was also too cold probably having been sitting in the refrigerator. Then again, the dish is an artwork and takes some time to make. Entrees were Pork and Fettuccine Bolognese. The pork dish was also artistic in appearance and fantastic in flavor according to my dining partner.  My Fettuccine ala bolognese (flat noodles with beef ragu was dissapointing. The Fettuccine were more  like ""Fettuccinitelli"" (if there is such a thing). I'm used to traditional fettuccini. Trouble with this dish is it was absolutely tasteless and bland.  Dessert was the Nutella tart with vanilla ice cream. This would have been better if it were heated more, but it was OK but gooey.  The adjoining table asked the prices of the daily specials when the waiter described them which is a good idea here since they are priced higher than the menu items though not exhorbitantly so.

When tried several pastas which they patiently and obligingly split into four plates. The special appetizer was a heirloom tomato, slightly grilled and stuffed with lobster and topped with a prawn. The waiter only had to describe it, say he only had two left and we immediately ordered them both.

NOM, NOM, NOM, YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!  We had the custard type thing with the berries on top.  It was perfect for three people.  Everyone got a couple of bites.  Not too heavy and just enough to satisfy our sweet tooth at the end of the meal.I absolutely love this place.  I would highly recommend it for an Italian spot that is totally reasonable!!!!!!!Go and check it out.",2,,

The service here was great and very attentive - we sat in the back room and I really enjoyed the minimalistic decor with the interesting artwork that complemented the room very well. For dinner, we tried the Burrata, Pappardelle with Mushrooms, and their special of the night - Lobster Pasta. A few other dishes, but I can't remember which ones. We also had an excellent bottle of Pinot Grigio which the waiter suggested and brought out.The Burrata was mediocre here, however, their pastas were excellent.

Unfortunately  I feel deceived by all the reviews. This was the most BLAND tasting Italian food I ever ate.  The celebrant and I were not happy and we will not be back.The lasagna had raving reviews on Yelp but it fell short of expectation.We ordered the lasagna and the Pasta with truffle oil. Maybe I am not a fan of al dente but we found all of this to be plain and bland.  There was not enough spice or flavor. I felt like they used ala vodka sauce in the lasagna rather then marinara.  Id rather go to Tommy Lasagna or Lupa for real Italian food.I was thinking perhaps the dessert could save our palettes. We ordered the apple pie ala mode. We didn't even finish it after three bites. We were so disappointed with the whole meal and feel it was overpriced.,1,,

The service was ON POINT! They did not make me feel weird for dining alone, which is something that I have had to get used to in my business travels, and brought everything out with great speed. The pastas are all house made and the bread is delightful. I could have had a meal of the bread and the lentils in olive oil that they bring you to start alone.

Updated review","As usual, great service and delicious food! My boss took me here for my birthday and Il Corso didn't disappoint!  We never get tired of coming here.  The staff is so friendly and genuine.  Every employee has always been happy and gratuitous every time we dined here.  The hostess even helped me with my coat which I rarely see the ladies do. Fresh bread, fresh mozz, fresh homemade pasta, fresh desserts. The lemon cake and the hazelnut tart were both phenomenal!!! You can't go wrong. I've never had anything here that I disliked. Most recently I had the tagliolini with mushrooms, truffle and smoked mozz. Delicioso!",2,,2

My bolognese lasagna was terrific and my husband had the duck special - unbelievably good and a beautiful presentation.

110,Baby S.,"Oceanside, NY",0,673,0,4.0,3/9/2017,"NYC has an abundance of Italian restaurants and this particular block has two practically next to each other.  We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Our waiter was a friendly, affable guy.  We ordered grilled calamari and bresaola emiliana for appetizers, and for the mains, I had the pasta special-pappardelle with duck and wild mushrooms while my friends had salads.  For the dessert, we shared the nutella cake, it was the bomb.  Why am I not giving it five stars?  Half a star is deducted because while the food was good, it was not something that you could come be dying to come back for, except maybe for the cake.  Half a star is deducted because when another server sprinkled parmesan cheese onto our entries, he sprinkled into each of my friends' glasses that had sparkling water.  I am not a primadonna and in a less classier and much cheaper place, I would not even mind, but in an establishment that charges 20 bucks for an appetizers, 30 bucks for pasta entrée and 40 bucks for other main entries, this should be been noticed and swiftly replaced with a full bottle of sparkling.  No notice, no apologies, no replacement.",1,,

Il Corso had grilled Octoupusand it was fairly decent, the best part of my meal in fact.  I must also add that the service was pretty good as well. The big disappointment was in my main course the seafood pasta in tomato sauce which was overly sweet totally lacking in bite or taste. I might have been tempted to go back and experiment with another entree but the by the glass wine list tells me otherwise. I'm probably a wine snob, but seeing Pinot Grigio and California Chardonay as a wine selection in an Italian restaurant tells me they don't have a clue. In the first case, there isn't a worse example of Italian white wine and in the second it's not even Italian.It's not that this restaurant is bad, it's that its devoid of good. Only go here if you are seeing a Broadway show and having difficulty finding a place to eat. I'm sure you'll find something acceptable here, but you aren't dining , you are just eating.",1,,

I had the gnocci and the sauce was watery and runny.

Our pasta and fish dishes were fine but nothing memorable. I will say the service was great, no faults there. Ultimately, based on reviews I was expecting somethign better than the standard midtown italian restaurant but unfortunately was a bit let down. Finally, it's not the restaurants fault but on yelp it's listed as ""quiet"" and this place was loud, loud even by nyc/midtown standards.

You should know, though, that I have a general complaint about Italian food places; I think they charge too much money for food that I can throw together at home in 20 minutes just as well. I mean, a beet salad, or a pasta with fresh mushrooms & herbs? Nothing really pushes the culinary envelope here.  But what they served was well prepared. One of the people I was with had a daily special that was decent (some pheasant dish).2) The wines were on the expensive side; no real choices under $40, and the bulk were closer to $80, and many well over $100. And the glasses they served this in were cheap-o, and didn't do justice to the wine (especially at this price).3) Wait staff was acceptable, but only just. They appeared the minimum number of times required to get the job done, but had we needed anything out of the ordinary, I would have wanted more visits. On the plus side, though, the restaurant isn't so big that it would be hard to flag them down.I wouldn't advise a friend to NOT go here.

The ambiance is sophisticated yet warm and inviting - perfect for a date night or reconnecting with old friends over a special meal.The food was excellent. A small bowl of marinated lentils came with the fresh bread - really delicious and unexpected! We also chose a sald with French fennel, orange, and greens - really refreshing. We all had pasta dishes, which was a great choice since all were fresh , house made pastas, beautifully & deliciously prepared. The cuisine is primarily northern Italian - very satisfying yet not overdone proportions.I would highly recommend this restaurant for this who enjoy an excellent meal and a very pleasing atmosphere.",,,

Like people said, this is a dangerous place to go before a show.  We showed up for our 6:15 Reservations, and had to RUSH out the door to make an 8:00 show at City Center, 1 block away. The reason?  Entrees took about 45min-1hr to come out.  Entrees arrive at 7:30pm.  Hardly a relaxed meal. My wife makes excellent company, so I didn't mind the wait, per se.  But the pasta dishes we ordered were hardly something special, some sauce and some shrimp!  When you are paying NYC prices for dinner, NYC prices for a show, when you make all your reservations and show up on time -- why should you have to rush like a Monday morning?Book 5:30pm if you have a show to attend...",,,

The biggest pile of messy tentacles I've ever seen.  I gamely dove in, but ultimately abandoned it. Overcooked, oversalted, BLORF.I ordered from the specials: tagliatelle with boar ragu.  While the sauce was flavorful and the pasta cooked perfectly al dente, the term ""ragu"" did not apply to this dish. It was as if there were some extra sauce left over that they threw some nuggets of boar into at the beginning of the shift, instead of simmering it slowly until tender.  The meat was tough and dry--inedible.  I sent it back.I ended up finishing my mother's lobster penne.  Again, the pasta was al dente, the sauce was delicious, and the meat overcooked.  I finished it anyway (she had eaten most of the lobster meat by then) and luckily since the portions are so large, that was plenty.My cousin had gnocchi in a totally uninspired marinara sauce.  In all fairness, she loved it (she's not a fan of spices).  I found the sauce bland and the gnocchi too soft.  As if almost no flour was used.  This may be a style thing.  I prefer my gnocchi to be more like a dumpling.  Not heavy, but not mush-in-your-mouth, either.With a chef possessing a little more finesse this place could be great.  As it is, it seems hit-or-miss, though the things they do well they do very well.",,,

This is a gem...The Insalata Caprese with buffalo mozzarella was out of this world.  I get this often in restaurants and the mozzarella was incredibly rich and fresh.  Prices were reasonable for Manhattan.  They make all their pasta in-house.The only disappointing item was the avocado and artichoke salad.  We shared this as an app and while it was not bad, it was mediocre.  Service A+.",,,

169,J. P.,"New York, NY",22,199,1,5.0,9/12/2010,"For what it is -- a small, traditional, non-destination restaurant -- Il Corso, based on more than half a dozen dinners I've had there, is pretty darn excellent.There are two dining rooms -- a busier, more lively one up front (with slightly tighter seating), and a more sedate, spacious one in the back. I like them both.Service is consistently great and a key draw: the Italian waiters are friendly, polite and professional, good humored and prepared with helpful suggestions when asked. I've noticed that over a span of a couple years, there's minimal turnover with familiar waitstaff regularly present.Well-made apéritifs/cocktails and a good wine list; the bread/focaccia basket presented with a little dish of lentils in spiced olive oil for spooning over is a nice touch.The food is carefully prepared and well presented. We usually get a combination of specials and menu items for appetizers. Other than calamari dorati that are sometimes paler than I like (ask for them to be cooked more deeply golden if you prefer, as I do), misfires are very rare and seasonal specials and fresh salads shine. Mains, both pastas and meat/fish entrees, are also consistently excellent. The lasagna all'Emiliana -- tender, light and toothsome all at once -- is particularly delicious, as is the hearty pappardelle al sugo di anatra (duck ragout). On a recent visit, a special with lobster, shrimp and scallops and fresh tagliatelle was outstanding, as was the oven-baked orata (dorade/sea bream).There's a selection of usual desserts presented on a sample tray; we usually go for the crème brûlée which is fine.A definite gem of a place, convivial, delicious and a welcome haven of civility, terrific service and wonderful food in midtown west.",4,,

But since I don't remember, it neither blew me away nor left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended. wait, that's not really a pun. never mind).What I do remember, though, is having a nice conversation in a restaurant that wasn't too fussy, loud, or busy.

Going through Food Network's Guide to Dining and Drinking in NYC (which you NEED to check out... NOW!) I happen upon Il Corso in the ""Best of Italian"" category.  If its recommended by Food Network, it has to be good, right? So I decide to give this place a shot - and I am SO glad I did!First of all, MAKE A RESERVATION.  When my friend and I showed up for our 7:30 reservation, there was a line about 6 people long out the door.  (This may have been due to the fact that it was a Saturday night, but better to be safe than sorry).  Lucky for us, we were seated automatically in the back dining room, which houses about 10 tables dressed in white tablecloths, is dimly lit, and is very clean.  After a little while, our waiter (who was obviously straight from Italy, as could be noted by his thick accent) came over to take our drink orders and tell us about the specials of the night - all of which sounded amazing.  As an appetizer, we decided on the fresh buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto, tomato salad, and basil.  This was brought out to us pre-divided onto two plates, which I thought was very nice, and each plate had a generous portion of food.  The tomatoes were not the best (perhaps because of the time of year?), but the mozzarella and prosciutto were incredible, very fresh.For dinner, my friend ordered one of the specials - potato and tomato gnocchi with shrimp in a lobster brandy cream sauce - and I got the fettuccine with cherry tomato sauce, basil and buffalo ricotta cheese.  My dish tasted SO fresh, the tomatoes in the sauce were much better than those that came with the appetizer, and the pasta (which they make in-house) was perfectly cooked al dente..I LOVED it.  My friend's dish was exceptional as well.Stuffed from our dinners, we didn't think we wanted to order dessert.  But when our waiter came out holding a tray displaying the various sweet offerings, we had to indulge in the nutella tart.  Good, but nothing to write home about, and I would have definitely been satisfied without it.The only reason for the docked star (4/5) was for the service.  Although our waiter was extremely accommodating and always had a smile on his face, he did seem to forget about our little table in the corner a few times (especially when we asked for the check and had to wait about 10 minutes).  Overall, however, this was a very delicious, well rounded meal, and I will DEFINITELY be returning in the future.FYI: For two glasses of wine, an appetizer, two entrees, dessert, and a cappuccino, our bill came to around $100 - a pretty affordable NYC dinner, especially in this area.",,,
183,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",228,592,50,4.0,11/25/2012,"I don't usually rate Midtown establishments very highly.  They cater to tourists (we hearts you tourists, don't misunderstand) but don't usually focus on the quality of ingredients or service as much as I would like them to.  This does NOT apply to Il Corso.  Mama and I were starving on a Tuesday afternoon at 4 pm and Il Corso were more than happy to welcome us for an early dinner.  To make our adventure short, I should tell you, I knocked over my first martini, changed tables twice and still-they were beyond courteous.  We started with beets-YUM.  The yellow and red beets, dressed in lemon, with one of the most incredible goats cheeses I've had since I left Lebanon.  Lebanon and goat cheese? Yes, we make a sort of Labneh made of goat cheese that is stored in olive oil, and eaten with pita bread.  Delish!  This goat cheese tasted just like that.  Then, I had the special, which was swordfish stuffed with seasoned bread crumbs.  It was good, but not incredibly good.  I like swordfish more than I like chocolate (IE. A lot) but I prefer it medium rare on the grill with lemon juice.  I ate the fish without the stuffing.  Mama did better and ordered the wild salmon which was perfect.We finished off with the apple pie, which was excellent.  Overall, this place rocks in terms of quality of food and service.  Do yourself a favor, and hit this place up next time you're in the area.  You won't be disappointed.",,,
184,Angela D.,"Sound Beach, NY",2,37,4,4.0,5/4/2014,Fried calamari was very good.  The beet salad and pear Gorgonzola salad were very good.  Gnocchi were light.  Lasagna was layered with noodles and not a gloppy mess of sauce .  Pappardelle pasta was a little to al dente for me but the fungi and truffle sauce was delicious.  Topped off with a good cup of decaf cappuccino and Nutella pie with hazel nut ice cream and strawberry.  Strawberry is exactly what this needed to cut sweetness.  Overall a very good meal.  Thank you Yelp for finding this spot.  Better than the places across from Carnegie Hall.,1,,1
185,Steve O.,"Englishtown, NJ",2,31,5,4.0,3/6/2010,"We were looking for a yummy Italian place that would not put a hole in my wallet and stumbled upon this place after reading the reviews here.Sometimes in NY you can get a meal with great food and service without overpaying.This restaurant is on a smaller side and has a narrow section in the front and a wider (but also smallish) room in the back. We were seated in the front and although the tables were close together, they were not too close where I felt uncomfortable. The food was tasty and solid throughout the whole meal. We shared a zucchini, artichoke, eggplant, sun dried tomato appetizer that came with delicious extra virgin olive oil and a blob of some Italian cheese that resembled cream cheese but tasted a whole lot better. We told them when we ordered that we were going to share it and lo and behold they brought it out on two plates - score!!! Each plate was big enough to count as an appetizer on its own.For the main course I had the thick pasta with duck and my gf had penne with some artichoke/eggplant oil+garlic sauce. Both were tasty and they were kind enough to replace the penne with Spaghetti on our request. When we asked for dessert, the waiter brought out a tray with all the dessert options laid out and explained each one (sweet). We picked the chocolate cake/cupcake thing and it came in a bowl of delicious caramel cream. The prices are really reasonable for the city, even the wine was less than $10 a glass. Where can you find that these days. The total for 2 drinks, appetizer, 2 main course, dessert, cappuccino and tea came to $98. The service was absolutely fantastic. Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive waiter never felt like a bother and we stayed for about 2 hours total, with the last 1/2 hour just chatting over coffee. He even put out his hand for a shake when we were leaving - I don't ever remember that happening anywhere else.I give it 4/5 stars because the food did not blow me away and the bread was on a stale side.

The meal ended with sharing some delicious desserts..You could tell that the chef uses only the finest ingredients and it is reflected in the prices accordingly.

At times very attentive and then there were times you couldn't get their attention.   Came in with a group of 5 and we all thought the salads were excellent, main course descent, dessert horrible.  The only thing worth eating for dessert was the crema cotta which was very light.",,,

Comments around the table included ""inedible"" and ""atrocious.""  Since it is near the theater district and big hotels, I imagine they survive with an out of town clientele who don't know where to go...I truly felt sorry for people who are paying hard earned dollars for a fine meal in NYC.  I can't believe I spent MY hard earned dollars here!",1,,1

198,Susan C.,"New York, NY",19,29,0,2.0,12/19/2013,"Pretty underwhelming. I took my brother here for a birthday dinner - he wanted Italian and something in midtown, and I sort of wished I hadn't. The restaurant was completely packed, so perhaps I'm just missing something. They gave us a bread basket with olive oil/lentils, which is good. We split an order of the spinach tortellini with ricotta for our first course. This was actually by far the best thing we ate that night - the pasta was fresh, and the sauce was creamy and delicious. For the 2nd course, I ordered the pork tenderloin and he ordered the chicken breast. The waiter told him they were out of the chicken (it was like 7 pm on a Thursday?!?), so he ordered the veal cutlet instead. Neither of us liked our entrees, which tasted like chain-restaurant italian, which was disappointing. My pork was cooked to the right temperature but both entrees just lacked flavor. Also, the pan fried potatoes that came with our food was scalding hot. We finished with the panna cotta, which was good, and plated beautifully. The service was very good. Overall, the bill came to $160 for 2 entrees, a pasta, dessert, and 3 drinks. I think because the entrees weren't so good, it just felt over-priced to me. They do have a pretty large pasta menu, and it seems like most of the good reviews on here are based on the pasta, so I would stick to that if you come here. They also have big portions here, so that's a plus.",1,,
199,John B.,"Monroe Township, NJ",18,124,0,4.0,11/23/2014,I was torn between a 3 or 4 stars here.   We had some very good dishes and some good dishes. The octopus appetizer was very good.   They constantly filled our table with bread.  Main course - I had the broccoli rabe with sausage.  Not much sausage. Again a good dish but not spectacular.  My son had lobster and pasta and loved it but again not much lobster.  They accommodated my young sons picky eating and provided butter pasta with a price to match a kids meal.  We will add Corso to our list of places to go back too but they will have competition from other 3/4 star Italian.,,,
