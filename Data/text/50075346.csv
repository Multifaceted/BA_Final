0,Tanya C.,"New York, NY",126,41,1,5.0,7/26/2018,"Best lunch deal in the neighborhood hands down. I favor the salad station which is only $9 for a very generous number of ingredients. Best salad deal in the neighborhood for sure!Also have tried quinoa bowl ($9 with a huge piece of salmon!!) and sandwich station - all delicious and great quality for the price.My colleagues keep saying taco station and ramen bowls are also great.Staff has always been friendly, fast and courteous - all in all five stars without a doubt. And my whole office on the same block agrees, we go there almost every day.",,,
1,Enriko G.,"New York, NY",84,22,6,4.0,11/19/2018,"Greasy launch. Good service. Fresh, very busy around 12-2pm here. 20 min in line to pay. But other then that everything is great",,,
2,Tina B.,"Bronx, NY",186,84,96,2.0,4/18/2018,"I came in today after seeing the Grand Opening sign. The food is so so.... best thing on my plate was the ""wild rice"". The oven roasted turkey is a little under cooked and the mac and cheese is very underseasoned. The advertised 8.99/lb price got me to come in bit then I was charged 10.49/lb at the register. Was originally going to just let it go and never come back but something made me turn around. The young ""manager"" who happened to be at the front was able to adjust the price for me and was very courteous. Thank you to him. ...A few tweaks to the menu and better overall understand of the pricing among all employees and they could give Essen (one street over) a run for their money, literally.",5,1,1
3,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,2.0,4/6/2018,"This place is huge and spacious. There are plenty of seats upstairs. I came at 1:30pm during the weekday and it was empty. I gave the hot/cold buffet a try and it's not worth the price. I believe it was a little over $10 a pound ($10.49?) and they only have large boxes. The selection looked good but what I got wasn't very tasty. The beef stew was weird, salmon was bland, turkey was extremely salty, chicken marsala too heavy. I did like their variety of sushi. I wished they refilled the buffet more often cause my food was cold. The staff was nice. Overall I felt that it's overpriced. There's plenty of other options in midtown. I probably won't return.",7,3,4
4,Irina G.,"Edgewater, NJ",473,220,1428,5.0,4/2/2018,"New place. Just opened last week. Prices are reasonable, food is good and there is plenty of seating upstairs. There are several  food stations: coffee and juices, sushi, quinoa and rice bowls, hot food buffet, salad station and possibly something else I am missing... (maybe pizza?)I got a salmon bowl. It was about $9 ($4.50 during opening week) and was great! The fish was fresh and cooked well, rice tasted good and the sauces, nuts and seeds worked well with it. I was satisfied and didn't have to break the bank for a healthy meal in the midtown area. Definitely worth a try if you are in the area for breakfast or lunch.",1,,1
5,Rebecca D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,9,0,4.0,11/18/2018,"The hot bar isn't impressive, but I love the quesadillas. There's a lot of seating upstairs, so this is a great lunch spot.",,,
6,Shawn F.,"Covington, KY",62,655,962,5.0,5/18/2018,"I'll admit that it's been a while since my last visit, though having worked just one block over (on 5th Avenue) for many years, it was a mainstay in terms of lunch options for not only myself, but a number of coworkers who don't always have the time for a sitdown lunch but want something more substantial & healthy than the fast food options that litter the neighborhood.  Though there is a good amount of seating if you do have time & aren't just going to bag it & head back to your office.I'd sometimes hit the buffet harder than I probably should have, which of course led to a higher than hoped for price, so I was usually better off with a sandwich order.  Their menu is a diverse one & most of us in NYC welcome diversity.  The food was always fresh & varied & service was speedy & efficient, if not overly friendly (then again, neither am I, as I usually visited when starving) - these people do their job well.",3,2,2
7,Jackie A.,"New York, NY",393,17,2,1.0,9/29/2018,"UNSANITARY. Avoid at all costs. I called out the guy that he forgot an ingredient and he said I can replace it since they didn't have it. Wouldn't have offered had I not said anything. Then he proceeded to handle money then cut up my chicken. I told him that's unsanitary and while walking out he yelled ""not to come back I no want to see you here."" Will be reporting him and unsanitary practices to corporate and NY health department to ensure they receive a low health grade.",,,
8,Kylie L.,"New Providence, NJ",3,66,1,5.0,9/29/2018,"This is one of my favorite buffets in the city. For $4.99/lb, you can load up on meat, fish, and veggies to your heart's content. The caveat is that everyone already knows about this amazing deal, and so the salmon and good stuff are gone by 3:01pm. Spacious seating area upstairs. Good place to rest & recharge.Favorites: slow cooked pork, green bean salad, crab saladPrice: $8.99/lb + tax ($4.99/lb + tax after 3pm)",,,
9,Anatole A.,"Sunnyside, NY",305,8,0,4.0,5/17/2018,"Easily one of the best additions to the Midtown East neighborhood and welcome alternative for lunch and buffet. The staff is beyond courteous, professional, and welcoming. The prices are also very welcome, with reasonable deals on a bunch of items. And yes, the spotlight is on them as of May 2018, but they're dealing with it best they can and still delivering awesome hospitality and taking care of customers. Well done, folks!",5,1,1
10,Nathan H.,"Dix Hills, NY",102,9,3,5.0,5/16/2018,"The last time I was here, I got the BBQ steak sandwich. I probably should have reviewed this place then, but I didn't. I am now. It was so good, and I was pleasantly surprised with their use of fresh mushrooms (I usually expect places like this to use canned mushrooms... so that was really nice), as well.I love a place with good prices, delicious food, and a multicultural staff that doesn't tolerate racism at any level.If I have any suggestion, it'd be to include nutrition facts (calories, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals, etc). I'd happily volunteer to help with that...",4,,
11,Ray T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,18,0,1.0,9/11/2018,"Stay away from after 3 pm Buffett, I was suspicious that the food is very old and it is. I had a very bad stomach pain last night. Look at the food it looks very old. I was very upset. Will never go back here again.",,,
12,Julian D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",171,3,1,5.0,8/22/2018,Really affordable. It is an oasis in the food desert that is midtown Manhattan. I recommend the fresh prepared foods or salads instead of the hot/cold bar. Wraps and sandwiches are fantastic and the staff is friendly.,,,
13,J F.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,6,4,5.0,5/21/2018,"This is a great place for lunch in midtown!Note: this is a real review. Granted, all of the media attention drew me in, but I'm glad it did, because I now have an awesome addition to my grab-and-go work lunch rotation. Fresh Kitchen is very chic for a midtown deli, and it has several distinct stations that offer a lot of variety, including hot and cold food bars, sandwiches, salads, a noodle bar, and a Latin-inspired grill. I got shrimp tacos, and they were fantastic -- three large tacos packed with a ton of shrimp, plus unlimited toppings (including guac) for $9! The employees were extremely friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend Fresh Kitchen, and I will definitely be back often.",,,
14,Mark A.,"Astoria, NY",203,13,1,1.0,7/12/2018,"Came in on Thursday at 7:08pm. The door was open, the signs were on the side walk so I went in. I was looking over the sushi and about a minute later one of the young associates came up to me and said ""sir, sir!! We're closed"" as if I should've known that. I put the sushi back and walked out. Here's an idea; if you're closed then take your street signs off the street and CLOSE YOUR DOOR. I don't blame the young associate. I blame poor management. Not a good experience. She should've at least let me buy the sushi!!",,,
15,Lina P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,8/2/2018,Best lunch spot in Midtown. Great variety and prices. The buffet always has many different options and the salad station is very popular. Highly recommended.,,,
16,Jeff S.,"Miami, FL",0,13,0,1.0,7/20/2018,"Bought the tuna sashimi bowl on white rice for lunch.  After eating the tuna on top, the white rice beneath it was soaked in red dye/red food coloring!!  Been eating fresh sushi for 30 years (even right off the boat in the FL Keys,) and have NEVER seen the white rice stained neon red!  There's a reason it's only $9.00.  Will never go back--",,,
17,Eddie S.,"New York, NY",0,61,5,1.0,4/13/2018,"Really?  This is the exact same place as what was there before when it was Sara's ""Gourmet"" Kitchen.   They just redecorated a bit.  Same layout.  Same food.   It's the exact same generic template of a hot/cold food bar in any generic asian midtown lunch deli ... the exact same.  I give them 6 months.    Here's a tip ... to the proprietors.  Don't do the exact same thing as every other identical generic midtown lunch deli.  Do you know why the other deli one block up Madison (which I won't name) has 3 lines 50 people deep at lunch?  They do it differently, and mix it up.",3,3,1
18,Suzette N.,"New York, NY",3,9,5,5.0,5/15/2018,"With a plethora of meal options, reasonable prices & friendly personnel - Fresh Kitchen easily earns 5 stars from me! They have an open floor layout so there's plenty of space to ponder your choices without the feeling of getting trampled. There is also a chic (and SPOTLESS) seating area upstairs where you can enjoy your meal with friends, coworkers or family alike! The food is always fresh and delicious and the customer service is always top notch! I had a recent instance there where I wanted to order a chicken caesar wrap and asked if there was cheese on it beforehand (I am lactose intolerant) - the staffer insisted on making me a fresh one with no cheese! All in all - great place to go in Midtown East!!",,,1
19,Michelle L.,"Hauppauge, NY",222,10,3,4.0,4/26/2018,"Stopped in here on my way to work and got a bacon egg and avocado sanwich on whole wheat bread and an iced green tea. It was super good, everyone was very nice and they use organic eggs which I love! The prices were awesome and it seems like they have a lot of choices. The only thing is they didn't have recycling which is a pet peeve of mine. Looking forward to going back!",1,,
20,Christopher C.,"Methuen, MA",213,34,7,5.0,5/18/2018,Fantastic food options. As the name suggests everything is fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and create a fun environment. Great lunch spot!,,,
21,Chris E.,"Union, NJ",73,47,4,5.0,4/4/2018,"Since they've opened, I've ordered like 5 times here and I haven't been disappointed yet. Everything here is delicious and I'm particularly fond of their salads. Tacos are great too. Hot bar looks good but I haven't tried it yet. Really, the only thing missing is pizza but that doesn't bother me. If you work in the area, it's a great option.",1,,
22,Brian C.,"New York, NY",93,29,1,2.0,6/8/2018,"When I asked a question about the fact that their menu board says a Quesadilla is served with Rice & Beans, I was told the menu is wrong in a very rude way.  It turned out not to taste very good either.  I will stick to the much more crowded and efficient Essen one block up.",1,,

24,Annie J.,"CANAL STREET, NY",2,8,0,1.0,6/21/2018,"I went back one time last week (6/18) and had soup and it was absolutely disgusting. I have never had such bad soup. It was southwestern chicken and my co-workers and I were completely amazed that they could serve such bad tasting soup. It was hot, but so poorly made, I don't think an animal would eat it. I would be seriously afraid of spending any more money on this place. As it is, I spent $6.00 and the thought of going in there to ask for my money is more than I can tolerate. If this is the soup, what is the produce like? I know the coffee is watery and lukewarm. Perhaps the owner should find a new business. He clearly does not know how to staff and/or he's too cheap to hire someone good to be in charge of the food.",,,
