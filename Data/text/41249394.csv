0,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,5.0,5/24/2018,"Great spot for brunch/lunch! I have been to the Union Square and W. Village location, all have same menu and system.The menu has tons of breakfast options served all day and also vegan and gluten free stuff. How it works? You make the line to order at the counter, pay and then they sit you to wait for your order. Super-efficient and even when there is a lot of people it moves really fast.I had the goat cheese & avo on toast with walnut pesto, cucumber and arugula ($12.50) and replaced the goat cheese for poached egg. Loooved the pesto! Not too oily and savory enough.My friends had the poached eggs & avo salad with smoked salmon, fresh lemon and olive oil ($14.95) and the Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato sandwich on choice of bread with arugula and pesto ($12.50).Everyone was really happy and surprised how generous the portions were considering the prices.",2,,2
1,Karol M.,"New York, NY",0,32,8,2.0,10/1/2018,I had tried to go to this place a couple of times but is was always super busy with a wait. I had high expectations cause of this. Unfortunately it disappointed. We were there early on Saturday when it wasnt too busy. We ordered at counter & got a seat quickly. The decor of place is nice & funky. The staff are super hip & friendly. That was the highlight of the visit.  We ordered two mimosas . They were out of glasses so they asked if it was ok to serve on pint glasses. Yaay for portion size but its just not the same drinking mimosas out of pint glasses. I ask a waiter to bring small glass to pour it into when they had ready. He kindly brought one pretty quickly. My coffee came in a mug that was completely cracked. The food menu is pretty basic for New York city brunch. I ordered the breakfast tacos. They are nice but just pretty standard fare. My boyfriend ordered poached egg salad with salmon. The poached eggs were hard and completely overcooked. I'd say my local deli serves better food. There are so many better brunch places in New York. Won't be rushing back.,,,
2,Evelyn A.,"Toronto, Canada",3031,1279,1414,4.0,9/14/2018,"André 3000 was in this establishment right before I popped in for a glass of wine. This meant, no one cared about me. I did, however, get to hear everyone talk about the best half of Outkast and enjoy this adorable little joint. I had a nice glass of red by candlelight, noted all of their delicious breakfast and lunch options on the menu board, and I will return.",5,1,7
3,Jill S.,"New York, NY",14,386,0,2.0,8/11/2018,"This is a decent spot for lunch. It's a cute place but there are no fans nor any air conditioning so it gets a bit sticky inside if it's a hot NYC summer day outside. The food is fine; honestly nothing to write home about. My biggest reason for only two stars is around the tipping protocol. You order food at the counter and then sit to wait for your food. I was here on a Friday afternoon with five coworkers and because things get a little chaotic when coordinating five lunch orders in a smaller space, I decided to pay for my coworkers to make it easier. Well, I didn't include a tip when I paid because a.) I think it's a little strange to tip when placing orders at a counter and b.) I don't like to tip until the end of the meal after I have had the full experience. After we were done eating and getting ready to leave, one of the staff members came over and said to the whole table, ""Can I get you anything else? You didn't tip so I wanted to make sure there's nothing else we can do for you."" I was really embarrassed that this was announced to the whole table, especially because the staff member who announced this was the same staff member who rang up the lunch transaction. Within 90 seconds I was back at the counter with the same staff member and she found my receipt immediatlely - I didn't even have to give her my name or show her my copy of the receipt, so she knew it was me who didn't tip. If she had come to me privately and asked about the tip I wouldn't be so annoyed while writing this review a day later....but I'm still annoyed that this staff member embarrassed me in front of my coworkers. While the staff did push some tables together to seat a group of five, between ordering at the counter, gathering your own utensils/napkins, the discomfort due to the lack of air circulation inside, and the food being just OK, I don't think I was deserving of being embarrassed.I will not be going back.",2,,
4,Fatima L.,"New York, NY",20,173,1340,2.0,7/22/2018,"Pretty crowded at 11:30am on Sunday. You order first at the counter and then sit down. When we went they were out of forks and maybe their washer was broken because they gave us plastic forks.... A sit down restaurant with plastic forks, I couldn't believe it. I had the avocado salmon salad for $15 and hubby had the French toast for $13. Pretty affordable prices and in a cute, charming area of the village but the food was so mediocre and the atmosphere was so bad that it was overall a really blegh experience. I would note that's it's kind of loud inside, for some reason they turn their music up even though it's crowded which adds to the noise level. Would skip. Much better restaurant's like blue stone Lane and Jack's wife Freda on the same block.",2,2,
5,Fenn N.,"Manhattan, NY",3,128,286,3.0,9/6/2018,"We came here since the brunch place across the street had a ridiculous wait. Grey Dog is pretty pricey and the quality is ok. The service was good but it's a different setup. You have to get your own utensils, water, and condiments. Never been a fan of those setups. Food was ok not spectacular.",1,,
6,Rory M.,"Nashville, TN",113,315,940,4.0,6/25/2018,"The Grey Dog is a cozy and quaint spot for breakfast + lunch alike with a neighborhood feel to it. Unlike other locations, this location had no line at primetime on Sunday morning, which we were not complaining about. Grab a menu, order at the counter, and they'll call out your name when your food is ready and bring it over to you. You have to get all of your silverware + condiments for yourself - just a heads up!The menu has classic breakfast dishes, salads, sandwiches, burgers, and a few other dishes - definitely something to please everyone. Here's what we ate: POACHED EGGS & AVOCADO SALAD // A perfect dish for brunch, blending some of your breakfast favorites in the form of a salad. The colorful plate came with a bed of arugula topped with shaved carrots + beets, slices of ripe avocado, two perfectly poached eggs, slices of smoked salmon, a lemon slice, and a toasted piece of bread. The runny yolks running into the arugula melded well with the other ingredients on the plate for a very vibrant and fresh breakfast with all of your favorite ingredients.CLASSIC BURGER // This burger was good, but not one of the best I've ever had. The burger is actually a double-burger, which came as a surprise! It's served with lettuce, tomato, and onion on the side to dress it as you please. The fries were the star of the plate - they were so crispy all around, without any soggy limp ones hanging out in the bunch. Definitely get the fries!GRILLED CHICKEN PRESS // My cousin ate this sandwich and really enjoyed it, and from the looks of it, I would order + devour it. The grilled chicken is layered with a thick layer of melted mozzarella, pesto, and sundried tomatoes on a pressed bread with char marks :P. Again, the fries were dynamite!The Grey Dog is an easy spot for grabbing a quick bite. I particulary like this location because it wasn't as crowded as the others are.",,,
7,Myles C.,"Brooklyn, NY",436,198,30,4.0,8/6/2018,"Fantastic local omelette that was a nice size, filling, and honestly, very handsome. I realize that was a weird thing to call an omelette, but it was shapely and even and a gorgeous yellow. The toast was a little too thick for my liking but still enjoyable. The house potatoes were also pretty good, but I think that I've had better ones. Hot sauce is good, service is good. I got the brussel sprouts as well but these were a little disappointing to be honest. They were overdone and too many leaves and not enough hearts. Not quite as good as Westville's TBH. It's difficult for me to decide between 4 for 5 stars. I'm going to have to say 4.5.",,,1
8,Melody L.,"Washington, DC",11,180,382,4.0,7/20/2018,"Great neighborhood spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch! My family and I were newcomers and were not sure how the seating and ordering process worked. We initially tried to seat ourselves at a table, but one of the waiters placed a bandana on a table in the back for us while we waited to order at the counter. The menu is expansive and has classic breakfast staples like pancakes, french toast, omelettes, home fries, and more. All of us were easily able to find something we liked. After ordering, paying, and tipping all at the counter, we sat comfortably at our saved table in the back, where there was a big screen showing a world cup game. We didn't realize that the service was limited in that we had to get up for our own water and utensils. However, the staff did refill coffee and bring out the food (by loudly calling out your name until they find your table.) The portions were generous and very satisfying. I wouldn't say my ham egg & cheese croissant was totally amazing, but it definitely hit the spot. I liked the casual atmosphere and neighborhood feel to the place.",1,,
9,Andrea B.,"New York, NY",2,35,51,5.0,8/24/2018,"Excellent service, food, and wine. My friends got the club and Mac n cheese and loved them. I had the Nachos and was in heaven. Super cheesy and fresh!",,,1
10,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,5.0,4/23/2018,"As soon as I first walked in, I knew this was going to be one of my favorite NYC places. The atmosphere is funky, fun, whimsical, eccentric, hippie, quirky light, and overall very cozy and inviting. It has exposed brick, fun flags, funky pictures, the tables are all of different islands. Nothing about the decor really goes together or makes sense, but thats what makes it so great. I love how you order at the counter and then sit down for them to deliver your food. I feel that its efficient, and makes it more casual. The servers are helpful, friendly, welcoming and overall make the experience super enjoyable. The menu is extensive, and everything I have had is good. The sandwiches are all classic and great portion, the chicken fingers were average, the sweet potato fries were unbelievable, and my absolute favorite was the vegan (With chicken) zoodles with pesto. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had, perhaps because of the lightness, the flavor... everything about it was perfect. I want to try so many things on their menu and can't wait to keep coming back. Definitely a spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch, and also has several vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options.",4,1,1
11,Alan C.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",628,19,4,5.0,10/17/2018,"Great local hangout with a casual vibe, awesome staff, killer food, and heavy cream for my coffee. Two enthusiastic thumbs up. Love me some West Village.",,,
12,Nicki N.,"Birmingham, AL",74,130,310,5.0,10/28/2017,"Absolutely, I loved this restaurant. So many great brunch and lunch choices. I had the signature Grey Dog breakfast with 2 eggs, sausage patty, French toast (with bananas, strawberries and blueberries) and potatoes. This meal was so delicious with a stand out in the French toast. The syrup seemed extra special and the fruit was perfectly complimentary. I would do it all again except I tried other stuff.A friend ordered the salmon toast points and I had to control myself from going back for more. It was served on a pita with capers, cream cheese, onions... #lifeexperienceAlso had the cafe au lait with hazelnut coffee. Not something I drink on a regular but was really delicious for vacation breakfast! Great start to a tourist's day. Definitely a go to breakfast/brunch/lunch spot because there were so many great choices. Wish I had a few more days so we could come and try the tuna and avocado tacos... #sadface. Gotta be on the agenda for next time!",,,1
13,Bowie W.,"Boston, MA",561,103,160,4.0,9/9/2017,"Pros:- Such a cute place. The decor is on point - very hipster and cozy. I love the christmas lights they had hanging up on the ceiling.- Fresh food! I've been to several Grey Dog locations and every time the food, from the vegetables they use as garnish to the fruits, was always fresh.Cons:- Very little seating room so it's not great for big groups and you should definitely keep in mind the times that you come (avoid rush hours)Specifics:- Grey Dog Club = Can't really go wrong with this classic. It was delicious and exactly what I expected from a classic bacon turkey sandwich. Also, honey mustard is my weakness.- Smoked Salmon Toast Points = So good. The highlight of my Grey Dog adventures so far. They didn't skimp out and gave us plenty of salmon. I feel like sour cream is one of those things where too much of it ends up killing the dish (like mayo) and was glad to see that they made sure there was a perfect amount on each slice but did not over do it. Also, can we please talk about the shapes and colors on this dish (see picture below). Such esthetic!Instagram @bowtiebowie for more food adventures!",2,,2
14,Powell M.,"New York, NY",13,200,139,5.0,3/9/2018,"Food: YUM! Variety of food: So much variety!!!! Charming staff: totally! Seating: weekday morning, lots of people with laptops taking up space. If you are a single person, it would be more polite to double up with another single person working on a 2 top table, so others can eat and leave, so more people can eat and leave. But the staff seem to be okay with this relax atmosphere the day I was there. Smoked salmon toast points were amazing, and a really decent portion. I saw some people ordering the Grey Dog Breakfast, and it looked amazing. Eggs looked perfectly cooked. I am 90% sure they are packed to the gills on the weekend for brunch. So bring your patience and then enjoy the fantastic food.",1,,
15,Nicholas R.,"Harrison, NJ",223,222,36,4.0,1/23/2018,"Grey Dog is a hippie brunch/lunch/dinner place located throughout Manhattan. It's quirky seating system makes newcomers a bit standoffish as you pretty much just grab an open table, hold it, then go up and order your meal, then wait for a random server to come over and ask every table if it's their food. It's chaotic yet fun. They have a fairly extensive menu offering items from salads, tacos, burgers, sandwiches, eggs and more. Every meal I have had here has been delicious, reasonably priced and large portions. One thing to note is the awkward tipping. Do you tip? If you do, how much? Whats expected? It's self-service, but offers the quality of a true sit down. Overall, its quirky, its fun and its delicious. Try it out!",6,1,1
16,Rebecca S.,"Cupertino, CA",238,957,1326,4.0,7/24/2017,"Tldr; the most important bit of info to know about the Grey Dog is that they serve FROZÉ with SOJU! (At least they do during the Summer). It's refreshing, strong and only $10 for a great big glass. Ok, so beyond the delish frozé, Grey Dog is a super cute little cafe that's great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee and wine. My friend and I stopped in for dinner and both enjoyed nice big salads along with our frozé. My seared tuna salad was fresh and filling and the ginger dressing was excellent. Meal prices are in the $11-16 range, and options include sandwiches, burgers, bowls, pastas and egg dishes only served during breakfast hours. Food was great, but service was so-so. Employees were friendly but aloof. We were moved 3 times to accommodate larger parties, but were never given an apology. They also forgot to serve my salad with bread, which I requested more than once. Oh well! I suppose it can be overwhelming when you work at a busy restaurant.",1,1,2
17,Maha W.,"Boca Raton, FL",7,61,46,5.0,7/21/2018,Great breakfast venue. I sampled the frozen rosé and peach drink. It's very strong. I had the egg and cheese croissant with Home fries. The home fries have a hint of chipotle. I wish I would've known Bc I hate chipotle. I despise it. But everything tasted great. Portions are very large. There's only one bathroom so I had to wait a little bit for the bathroom. They have really good looking breads and cakes. My friend had an egg white omelette with Brie. She enjoyed it. They initially forgot to add the cheese but she reminded them. The place has plenty of space to sit and eat.,,,
18,Michael N.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,95,2,5.0,7/9/2018,"Fantastic place to go for coffee and camaraderie, and an addictive atmosphere. I went at 8pm on a Sunday night, not too crowded. Service was excellent and friendly (but not too friendly), maps cover the walls and tables (I was in heaven) and I loved the sign reminding you to not be a table hog. Coffee is very good, and I tried the apple fritter cake, which was delicious. They serve food as well, which looked great, I'll have to try some next time I'm there. An awesome experience.",,,
19,Christina R.,"West Islip, NY",313,185,129,5.0,3/5/2018,What a great place! The whole concept is pretty cool.. a hostess shows you a bandana and looks for a table that fits your party while you order at the counter. There are lots of options for different dietary needs including vegan and gluten free. Even on a Saturday evening they had open tables but still crowded. Really liked that they didn't rush us out and let us sit around to talk.,,,
20,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,5/18/2017,"I need a cool place to counteract with the hot weather, so decided to run to this chilled cafe in west village early in the morning before work. The place was rather small, yet with a huge selection of breakfast goodies and beverages. Barista with a big smile too, loved it! Inside decoration reminded me of ancient Europe for some reason...Got my daily caffeine fix, very balanced in taste. Strongly recommend this place!",10,6,15
21,Ping F.,"Manhattan, NY",101,232,1444,3.0,7/1/2017,"Randomly stopped by for brunch with my friend.  It was our first time there so the waiter told us that we order/pay first and grab the utensils, water and condiments from the side ourselves.  A server brought the food to the table.  I thought that the business model is interesting, which I guess makes it easier for people to pay for their own meal and not have to worry about splitting the check later.  My friend ordered the kids meal French Toast while I ordered the Guacamole bacon grilled cheese sandwich with fries $12.95.  I though the French Toast looked really tiny, even for kids meal size.  She wanted French Toast but did not see it in the regular menu.My grilled cheese sandwich was lukewarm when it arrived on the table so the cheese wasn't gooey, and it didn't have enough cheese.  The bacon wasn't crispy enough, it was chewy. The sandwich was mostly guacamole, which normally I wouldn't have a problem with because I love guacamole but I would have prefer a better ratio of cheese to guacamole.  The fries on the other hand were the perfect texture - you can't really mess up fries.We ordered a pitcher of red sangria which was about 4 small wine glasses size.  It was tasty and had a lot of fruit.  I wish there were bubble tea straws so I could have sipped the sangria and fruit together. =)If I was super hungry and I was near a Grey Dog, I'll dine here again. Hunger make me lazy to research restaurants with short notice.",,1,1
22,Matt S.,"Mercer Island, WA",106,313,14,5.0,12/20/2017,I'm not sure how the seating process works but it does. Greeted at the door but a friendly face and given a specific hanky color to look for once ordering is complete. Food was super delicious- we both had the special and enjoyed every bit. This place can be a beehive of activity and lines on the weekends so be prepared to play along and not loiter.,,,2
23,Melissa R.,"Kenosha, WI",3,23,48,5.0,7/19/2018,"Cute place! Everything sounds and looks yummy! Service was great, no rushing while in the midst of indecision. Food came out quickly and it was freshly made. The portions here are enormous! It's a little on the pricey side (but I am from the Midwest where it's cheaper) so the amount of food makes up for it. The yogurt granola bowl was so refreshing and filling, I didn't need to stop for lunch.",,,
24,Julia S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",38,148,145,4.0,12/23/2017,"Nice little place that offers different types of dishes such as woks, mac and cheese, hamburgers, pasta, etc. I order pad thai, and it was a cold dish like a salad, it was good though.",,,
25,Britta G.,"Los Angeles, CA",569,296,475,5.0,10/16/2017,Love this place! We went for a late breakfast and I split the egg and cheese croissant with my sister. It came with the most delicious breakfast potatoes and the sandwich was also amazing! They use a super creamy cheese. We also got the hazelnut coffee which deserves 5 starts on its own.

26,Dominiece N.,"University Park, FL",11,10,9,4.0,1/14/2018,"Chelsea Location:  The Grey Dog was a cute, quaint, hippy places. The turned three connected homes into the restaurant. When you come in you get online to order your food and when you're done ordering they seat you...it was different. The place is a nice vibe. Food was pretty good... and they give you a decent amount of food. Even their homemade mixed lemonade was great. I would definitely recommend it. They have something for everyone: meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegan...and it's not just ONE option, they gave a few options for all.Service was awesome. The cashier lady that you order from was very knowledgeable about the menu and recommendations. I will definitely be going back",,,
27,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,3.0,10/15/2017,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite for dinner on a busy Saturday night in the city. There were a couple of bar stools available, so we were able to order at the counter and be seated right away.After perusing the menu for a bit, I decided to go with the fish tacos with a side of salad and Brussels sprouts.The fish tacos--which the waitress said they are well-known for--were decent. The fish had nice flavor and was a good-sized portion--but the flavor didn't 'wow' me. The salad on the side was also a little lackluster as it was hardly dressed at all.The side of Brussels sprouts was alright--they were a bit too steamed for my liking as they were more mushy than crispy, though the flavor was still okay.Overall, this place serves up some solid food options, but just doesn't hit the high marks that one would expect from a 4 or 5 star restaurant. Nevertheless, the service here was friendly, though it wasn't always the most attentive and the food took a while to come out.",2,,1

Although it was very crowded with limited seating, their servers were very accommodating and made sure we had a table ready very quickly.

31,Tishea D.,"Baltimore, MD",534,266,462,3.0,4/8/2017,"So I was in New York for a business trip and I had two more hours before I had to be back to the train station. We decided to stop here and warm up since we were soaked from the rainy day. I guess this was a pretty poplar spot because they were crowded. We finally found a seat. I loved how they had snacks and things for you to sample in the front of the diner. That was cute. They had great customer service. One of the servers gave me a compliment and told me how much she loved my make-up. ( I guess that is also another way to get a nice tip from me) I like when my waiter/waitress are very personable. I was at the diner at Friday March 31st, at about 4:00. I ordered a small hot apple cider which was good and an apple cobbler. So the apple cobbler. It was really dry. I was disappointed but I am a team player so I continued to eat it. So while chewing  I felt something really stringy and uncomfortable in my mouth. I pulled out about three inches of a strand of blonde hair. I was so mad but since I was on a business trip I decided not to take it back or make a scene.",,,

33,Bryan B.,"New York, NY",9,1,0,1.0,2/18/2018,"Alright... this is an ACTUAL restaurant? Like, one where you hire employees, make food, serve the customers?  It looked more like a casting call for an upcoming 4/10 Netflix series- for real tho.I understand having a unique system but Jesus, I was in no way served or accommodated other than just getting my food brought to me.Note- chicken tenders and a Panini took 30 minutes in an empty restaurant.After 10 minutes of not getting the water, I asked my server for water,  and was pointed in the direction of the servers booth where I could get it myself?  And the same happened when I asked for napkins?  If it was chipotle I just wish I had known earlier, and if it is chipotle why do you have 6 servers standing around making out and practicing their acting. This place was legitimately a mediocre Netflix series based in east Williamsburg.  I'm telling you.I'm just mad I got an undercooked chicken tender and paid a tip for absolutely nothingI love food",,1,1

She introduce me to this amazing place, and I'm so glad I came here, because the food is absolutely amazing. You order your food from the front and they bring it to you. The menu is actually mixed with both breakfast, lunch, and dinner which is great! I had the seared tuna tacos, and at first I was going to pair it with a salad, but I wanted to take a walk on the wild side, and get fries instead. I'm so glad I decided to do that, because the food was delicious!! Omg! I've never had seasoned seared tuna like that before. I kind of want to go there everyday to just order that, because I love tacos lol.. but when I say the food is fresh, it's just that! I grabbed the ketchup, salt and pepper thinking the fries would probably be bland, but it was seasoned fries! I have no idea what seasoning they put on the fries, but I'm so mad I left fries on my plate lmao! Now I'm dreaming about the fries and I can't wait to go back! The service is great, and they are very helpful with selecting items. I also had an ice caramel macchiato. So much for Starbucks!

They relocated down the block and now one of a few locations but definitely still maintain the vibe. While I am not a fan of hipster quinoa places, they still have great menu items and yummy coffee. In fact, you probably get a sensory overload looking at the number of options available. Recently had the chili which was pretty good and chicken sandwich with fries. Love the fries!

I couldn't decide if I loved that or wished it was more veggie-like. A good thing to order if you're a vegetarian craving a real burger, but if you want a very veggie texture and flavor, that's not what you're getting here. The patty was pretty thin compared to other restaurant veggie burgers I've had -- it was about the size of a frozen, store-bought veggie burger -- but [sweet potato fries included] the overall meal was quite filling. The fried onions and sauce (""tofu relish"" = vegan Big Mac sauce) on the burger were a nice touch.",,,

Updated review",used to enjoy coming here but the service has gone downhill. None of the servers seem to know what's going on. They don't know what the kitchen has. They stand around bullshitting with each other. It's so unprofessional it's embarrassing. I recommend getting your food to go because the quality is still there,,,
40,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,4.0,11/11/2016,"Here's the drill: it's semi-self service. You order at the counter, pay there, and if you want to stay, tell the waiters and they'd put an apron to a table so you can sit there after ordering. When the food is out, they yell your name and bring food to your table. You grab napkins, utensils, waters yourselves. This whole process is slightly painful to me for some reason. If I want a fast food place, I wouldn't have come here. Maybe because I thought it's similar to Market Table right around the corner. With that said, the food was actually good in a ""basic"" way. I got the gumbo and half grilled cheese sandwich combo. Gumbo wasn't a looker and a little too watery, but it had enough spice and flavors that I actually liked. Grilled cheese sandwich was not the best, but I ordered it with bacon and guac and it tasted good. My husband got the breakfast quesadilla, I tasted it and it was surprisingly good, although I wouldn't technically call it a quesadilla, there's no cheese. It's more of a tortilla wrap stuffed scrambled egg plus mushroom/onion and cut to slices. I would've given them a 3.5 because the food was very basic, good and standard, nothing to rave about, like the stuff I can make at home. It's a 4 because other than the awkward girl who took our order at the front, everyone else was super nice.",12,12,12
41,Bentley W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,4,5.0,4/22/2018,Had a great experience for breakfast on a Saturday. They have a smart set up where you wait in line to order and they have someone on staff get you a table reserved by the time you're done. Coffee was wonderful with free refills and the egg and cheese croissant was exactly what I needed. Prices are super reasonable and portions are great. I'm looking forward to going back for other meals because everything looked and sounded so tasty!,,,

Our conversation was cut short, and the waiter was so abrupt and persistent that the table next to us even commented to us ""wow, I didn't like that"".It's a pity - the waiter's behavior was in poor taste.NOT recommended for a 'relaxing Sunday brunch'.",3,,1

Grey Dog's website is user-friendly, as you get to pick time of pick up and customize many of the options from the menu.Ordered the Goat Cheese+Avocado Sandwich on sourdough with salad ($12) and the Hummus Toast on challah with fries ($12) to share. Pickup was actually ready well before the time I chose, so was hoping it wouldn't be soggy by the time I got to it. Sourdough is slightly toasted, sandwiching a large helping of avocado, arugula, goat cheese, and pesto. Avocado/goat cheese combo overpowered the other ingredients, but the arugula and celery gave some texture to the filling. Accompanying salad is light with modest balsamic vinaigrette for flavoring (not soggy). Hummus Toast is great, four thick sliced pieces of challah bread hosting a handful of tomatoes, hummus, and crisped kale. Good balance of flavor.Was able to pick up and go without much waiting. Lots of other options for soups, salads, and such - so plenty of reasons to return.",,,1

53,Cindy X.,"Manhattan, NY",131,244,448,3.0,7/2/2016,"We were searching on Yelp for a place that serves American food and found The Grey Dog. Inside the restaurant looked vintage, almost like it was supposed to be in a small old town area. There weren't any waiters or waitresses to serve you, you have to go up to the register and order.Without the servers is probably why the old looking wooden tables looked a bit dirty and sticky. We went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich with fries, seared tuna taco and fish tacos with a side of arugula salad for 4 people because we weren't crazy hungry at that moment.The portion of the food are huge and we couldn't finish it. The fish tacos taste fresh (had better ones) but the salad was very bitter and we ended up throwing it out. The seared tuna wasn't bad however the chicken sandwich was really dry and didn't taste that good. Overall the food quality is like 3 stars. Not too crazy about it. Food was neither white nor black, it was somewhat gray just like how they named it ""The Gray Dog"". I'll probably stop by again if I am in the area or if I'm really hungry.",1,1,1

55,Jessica L.,"Bayside, NY",331,148,257,5.0,3/22/2016,"This place does get pretttty crowded during brunch hours, so beware. There's a line that forms to the counter where you order, each customer is shown what their handkerchief looks like, and after you order you go to the specific table where your handkerchief is on. When your food is ready, the waiter brings the food to your table according to the handkerchief; pretty efficient service! If you like lox and cream cheese, I highly recommend the smoked salmon toast points! The lox is so fresh and paired with the perfect amount of cream cheese. If you like tuna sashimi and are a fan of salads, I also recommend the tuna steak salad! The tuna was cooked perfectly, with a nice pink center. The salad dressing paired really nicely with the salad as a whole. Though the line was pretty long, the wait itself wasn't that long.

59,Carol L.,"New York, NY",729,392,1367,5.0,8/11/2017,"One of my favorite brunch places! Located in the heart of East Village near Washington Square Park, it was poppin' on a Saturday morning. We were all pretty hungover from a night of drinking the night before, and my friend suggested this place as a hearty brunch the next day. We arrived ~11 am on Saturday morning, and waited for ~15 minutes to order. We all got the grey dog breakfast platter, which included your choice of meat, your choice of style of eggs, French toast or waffles, homestyle potatoes, and fresh fruit. All for $14! It is self-seating, so we waited around until one of the tables cleared up. The food came out pretty quickly for how many people were there, and we happily dug in. The food was fresh and really good, and I think that was the best post-drinking brunch I'd had in a long, long time. The coffee was strong and we were able to get refills, change our mug into a to-go cup AND get a refill to go! Loved the service, wonderful food, and a cheery, loud-ish atmosphere that is very Sunday brunch. Would recommend, 10/10!",,,

I've had their eggs and their omelet that both come with home fries. The brunch is nothing extraordinary but it is tasty and not expensive, especially for the SoHo area.

It was so good!! The raspberry jam added a sweetness to the sandwich and contrasted nicely with the brie cheese. You get your choice of regular fries, a salad, or sweet potato fires (+$1) with your sandwich and they give you a huge portion of either. I had the regular fries and man did it hit the spot. The Grey Dog has always been a solid lunch option - all their locations. I think this one might be my favorite one, since it's larger than the Union Square option and lighter than the Noho one.",1,,1

This restaurant, which has several branches throughout NYC, is beautifully decorated in a mix of rustic/weathered signs, tables, and chairs. It's the type of place where you order before sitting. While that may sound stressful on a busy weekend morning, they have mastered the system of seating guests. While you wait in line, a hostess will find you group a table and reserve it with a specific bandana so it is ready for you when you complete your order. We got the bandana adorned with marijuana leaves haha.While they make fabulous coffee drinks, the highlight is really the food. A mix of delicious (and healthy sounding) sandwiches, pastas, soups, salads, and brunch fare. I've been here several times and never been disappointed. Avocado toast, salmon/avocado salad, the Grey Dog club, seafood gumbo, the Grey Dog breakfast, mustard brussel sprouts are just a few amazing things I've tried.

My only complaint: they used to have a sandwich on the menu that was grilled veggies with herbed goat cheese on flat bread AND THEY GOT RID OF IT!! Most disappointing.

I guess that's a thing when you're really hungry though. I enjoyed the spicy kale caesar salad and added chicken. It was a heaping pile of yum, plus I had leftovers. The dressing wasn't as spicy as I expected, and I didn't care for the pita it came with. It was too tough/stale, so I could barely bite into it. My husband also enjoyed his club sandwich. I remember the bread being especially delicious. We went mid-afternoon, so there was a steady flow of customers, but not overly crowded. I can imagine that isn't the case during peak hours.

The employees are all super nice and way cooler than I am. The food is great--  everything is very fresh and feels fairly healthy. I will say I find the food a little pricey, but you pay for the atmosphere as well.

To my surprise, I stumbled upon a cute little café with a good amount of vegan options posted on their outside menu. It was already pretty busy at 11AM so I thought I'd check it out.I was instantly greeted with a smile and friendly service. The procedure for dining in is to order at the counter, snag a table, pay...and then your food is brought out to you by name. Drinks are delivered via the counter. They also serve alcohol if you're looking for a hair of the (grey) dog. The young girl behind the counter answered all my annoying vegan questions and with her guidance I opted for the spiced chai latte with soy and the veggie burger with avocado and sweet potato fries. Perfectly delicious...and vegan. The tofu relish was amazing and the red onions and cole slaw added a lovely flavor to a nice tasting patty. Note: I normally HATE cole slaw...this one was fresh and light and not slathered in mayo.The music added to the overall chill but buzzing vibe. 15% off your order if you check in on Yelp!",10,3,6

The wait went by fairly quickly though, and we just saw it as a sign that this place was as good as the Yelp reviews claimed. The cafe itself is pretty tiny, but it had such a cute, homey vibe to it. I was also surprised by how extensive the menu was - every item on there sounded delicious! The most difficult part was trying to decide if we were in the mood for breakfast or lunch because it was late morning by the time we got there. I ultimately ended up ordering the guacamole & bacon grilled cheese (my favorite combination) with fries. Loved it! I got the strawberry lemonade as well, which was super refreshing and not too sweet.

Menu is etched on the wall and a line for a table quickly forms at the counter.  Orders for table service or takeout are taken at the counter as well as immediate payment.  Waiters reserve your table by placing a colored bandana.  Sunday brunch fit for my party of two we ordered:The Reuben with French Fries  NachosSodaClassic Burger with French Fries (without cheese)Iced Green TeaEntrees and platters are served to your table while everything else as condiments, utensils, napkins are self-served.  My burger was okay but not entirely juicy as I had yearned.  The Fries were average.  My friend's Reuben sandwich was enticing but the nachos was overwhelming filled with too much toppings: black beans, Jalapenos, Sour cream, Salsa, Mozzarella, cheddar Jack, and tomato.  The Grey Dog hits the spot for brunch or lunch but not dinner.  We actually occupied our table slightly longer than average time as with age + I needed to digest, but luckily the staff did not ushered us out.Note: No table hibernation as there is a immediate table turnover for this café especially during peak lunch or dinner hours.",1,,1
90,Christine B.,"Queens, NY",82,185,293,4.0,3/10/2017,I've dined in and ordered take out from GD. My only complaint is the dry bread they use for the sandwich and burgers - everything else is great. The quality and portions are always massive. If your meal comes with fries then make sure to sub it with sweet potato fries.,,,
91,Kate P.,"New York, NY",0,18,16,5.0,12/31/2016,This is my favorite casual spot in the neighborhood. Sometimes I pop in for coffee to go or to grab a quick lunch with friends- but it's always a solid choice no matter what time of day. Service is always excellent and I always leave feeling a little happier than when I walked in.,3,,
92,Amanda H.,"JAMAICA, NY",115,39,105,4.0,7/24/2016,"After asking some locals for a good place to go for breakfast in the area, this place was their #1 suggestion. I was very pleased with the location, the ambiance and the food itself. I ordered the Egg Sandwich with Cheese and Bacon on a Croissant which came with home fries. Eggs were fluffy....bacon was crispy as I requested.......just the right amount of cheese......and the croissant was soft and buttery. What I thought was very unique was that you serve your own water, get your own condiments and utensils from a little station. You have servers; however, this concept makes you feel like you're in the comfort of your own home! I will definitely return for another visit.",,,
93,John B.,"London, United Kingdom",214,380,1321,4.0,1/11/2016,"Interesting. In a good way.Very preppy (is that word still used?), and the crowd seemed to be youngish.Not THE most amazing food I've ever eaten (quesadilla & brown rice bowl) but it wasn't bad and in context ($40 for 2 people) is why it achieves its 4* rating.I'd recommend it for a quick bite to eat undoubtedly, given the location, I'd argue its astonishing value for money.",3,3,2

95,Elissa C.,"East Hartford, CT",0,13,6,5.0,6/27/2017,This place was a spur of the moment kind of stop. Absolutely loved it the minute we opened the door!

96,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,4.0,12/10/2015,"Skeptical at first, I am fast becoming a fan of Grey Dog. Sure, the servers are all sporting 90s college fashion and impossibly chipper attitudes, but the service is good and things move along nicely. We came in right around the time it opens, snagging a nice table, but would probably not wait in line to brunch here.Breakfast/brunch prices are good and the portions large. I ordered the ""POACHED EGGS & AVOCADO SALAD OVER ARUGULA WITH SMOKED SALMON, FRESH LEMON, & OLIVE OIL."" It was good and felt pretty healthy, with the arugula salad providing a nice, light bed for the rest of it.Others had french toast and egg sandwiches and everyone was happy. It would be nice if the waiters walked around to do the free coffee refills, but it was easy enough to get them from the counter.",2,,1
97,Charley T.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,3/30/2018,"I got the poached egg and avocado salad with salmon. Unfortunately it gave me food poisoning and I have to admit it did taste a little funny when I was eating it. My girlfriend said it smelled really bad too. The place seemed nice, really interesting and cool vibe, the service was good, and I see other reviews that say good things about the same order...maybe I just got a bad piece of fish.",,,

99,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3836,3382,93,4.0,10/6/2015,"I met up with my friend Sabra E. at The Grey Dog for coffee when I was in town. I picked it for pure convenience, but it was a cute place, comfortable with a bustling, warm, villagey vibe. We got a table and ordered up at the counter. The barista was nice.I got a big mug of cappuccino, and it hit the spot on a drizzly day. I'm not a habitual coffee drinker, but I thought it was a good cup, and I do love me some milk foam. Sabra ordered a club sandwich and wasn't too happy with it. It's possible this place is better for coffee than for food. It did feel more like a coffee shop than a restaurant.Anyway, I was happy with The Grey Dog and would visit again if I'm ever in need of a coffee place in this part of town. I liked my cappuccino and had a lovely time relaxing and catching up with my friend.",10,5,6
100,John D.,"San Clemente, CA",52,31,11,3.0,6/11/2016,"Friendly corner place - definitely local oriented. Had the hummus and guacamole appetizers, which were tasty. The hummus did not come with near enough pita bread. When we asked for more, the waiter literally brought two more skinny slices. Half pound of hummus left. Beer was cold.

Let me tell ya, this place has the best grilled cheese I've had. It was light, tasty, and flavorful. Really enjoyed our table art (maps of Maryland and Oregon) The service was wonderful. The staff is personable and very approachable. Great place! Will come again in the future to try brunch!",,,
107,Tomas K.,"Garland, TX",10,84,64,5.0,12/11/2016,"My wife and I were waking past the Grey Dog after dinner in little Italy and decided to stop in for a drink. Very cozy and welcoming atmosphere with music playing and not to noisy. We wanted a laid back place where we could hang out and talk. They had a nice selection of beers and wine; we ended up getting the spiced wine and a bread pudding for dessert. The wine was fantastic, but the bread pudding was a little disappointing. It was very chewy and not tasty. I'm still giving 5 stars though because the atmosphere and service was excellent. They served food as well, sandwiches and salads and such, but I can't comment on that since we didn't have any food. If you're looking for a great place to have a drink with friends this place is worth checking out.",,,
108,Rachel B.,"New York, NY",51,28,5,1.0,8/27/2016,"If you skip all of this review just read this line: CELIACS, this place is not safe. Really sad to have to rate so poorly. The Grey Dog has long been a favorite of mine because of its delicious gluten-free options. Yesterday I finally indulged in the Grey Dog Breakfast to celebrate a new job; I told the man who took my order that I had a gluten allergy (celiac) and requested gf French toast. A couple hours later, I was vomiting violently with a terrible bought of ""gluten poisoning"" as I call it. Once I had gotten it all out of my system and slept it off, I called the manager and told him that something had gone awry with ordering. He said the home fries have gluten -- something the cashier must have missed besides my saying ""gluten allergy."" I'm really bummed to not be able to come here anymore. I loved this place. But knowing now that the staff just isn't prepared to handle serious allergies, I can't come back. Celiacs: STAY AWAY. For those with no allergies, the food is great! But I wouldn't trust them in safely handling any allergy, sadly.",3,2,2
109,Ally C.,"New York, NY",499,239,136,4.0,11/5/2015,"Solid, unpretentious brunch place if you can get a table. You order at the front (like you would at a cafe) and you take a seat, and wait for your food to come to you. Most everything else is self-serve -- there's a table further down that has water cups/jug, silverware, and napkins. Everyone working there had an ultra-cool urban hipster chic thing going on, so you can enjoy their stylish air while you sip your extra-black coffee and ponder your life choices.It was super crowded when we tried to go on a Sunday afternoon. The three of us ended up sitting at the bar stools by the window, and it was a little hard talking to/hearing each other. The food tasted good though, and plentiful. I got the eggs any-style (I got em poached) and I wasn't able to finish everything.",,,

111,Karin A.,"Middle Village, NY",90,79,110,3.0,11/19/2015,"Went there this Sunday for some brunch with my friend from out of town. As most brunch places around this area there was a line to get seated. We were greeted by a guy and told us how this place works - you stand in line - order and then you sit down and wait for the food to come. We asked the guy for a table not next to the bathroom - and he still gave us the table next to it (therefore - one star). We waited only about 10 minutes to order - not bad at all! The atmosphere was cool. Great music and not too loud so you could still have a nice conversation and enjoy your food. I liked the decor - very cute.We didn't have to wait long at all for our food. My friend had the grey dog breakfast with French toast - she really enjoyed her plate. I had the poached eggs and avocado salad. My avocado bits had some of the ""brown"" coloring on it so wasn't too impressed. The salmon and eggs were ok. Nothing special. The salad greens were just plain - I felt it needed some vinegar, slice of lemon or at least a little drizzle of olive oil or something.I probably wouldn't come back here for the food - or if I did I would probably stick with pancakes or French toast.",,,
112,Hanna C.,"New York, NY",275,24,0,5.0,7/18/2017,"I absolutely love this place. The convenience of the location (right near the West 4th St. Subway Station [ABCDEFM]) as well as the quiet location on Carmine Street a couple blocks down from Bleeker St. is perfect. Although the space is almost a maze of a space, with two rooms, I've never had to wait for a table. I love that you line up and order at the counter, pay, and then they bring you your food. Very convenient and efficient. I got eggs, bacon, and toast. Delicious. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great breakfast/brunch spot. At times it can be pretty crowded and loud, but most of the time, it is pleasantly full but you can still have a good conversation.",,,

I was here for Sunday brunch and the place was full. It is great for people of all ages too.

Sometimes line could be slow to move as people take their own sweet time to order the food.Reasonably priced and coffee shop feel.  The menu is exhaustive with eggs, burgers, sandwiches and wraps.  A number of vegetarian/vegan options to pick from.  House Fries are the best and can be accompanied with anything.  The chai latte was nice (only prepared hot) with cinnamon on top.",,,

Updated review","The atmosphere is very casual. This is the greatest  breakfast hangout spot I know of. Dogs are not really allowed inside but only because of the law. Most customers are big dog fans and owners and this is reflected in the style of all The Grey Dog restaurants. The food is healthy and the kitchens are nice and clean. The staff all seem to be hippie types as well as the music choices they pick. That said, the owner is anti free Wifi or NYU students would camp out forever.",,,
118,Mihir G.,"Chicago, IL",135,93,43,5.0,8/10/2016,I love this spot! Met a friend here for a quick bite to eat along with a cold beer on a hot Summer day.

Not gonna lie though, the nachos/Philly cheese steak and all the comfort food looked amazing.My only qualm is the iced coffee. It seemed a bit watered down.  Maybe they put too much ice in it?

While there was quite a line formed (as is typically for most places in NYC), it moved quickly, thanks to the attentive, efficient and welcoming staff.  The Grey Dog's Breakfast was just what we needed--weekend comfort food-- fresh, light and with just the right portions of eggs, home fries, bacon and pancakes (sounds like a lot, but they manage to give you just enough food to feel satisfied and not bloated).

The Grey Dog has appy's, breakfast, and lunch that can be ordered any time of the day. (There's something devil-ish about ordering breakfast for dinner - which I love.) It's very small inside with wooden furnish. This location of TGD is a bit more meaningful to the owners.. a way of coming back home to their original area they started off with years ago.I ordered the Smoked Salmon Toast Points with the cream cheese on the side, of course. There's something about it that made it taste better than any other restaurant that serves lox. Maybe it's the area? Maybe it was the kind gentleman that saved seats for us while we ordered our food? MAYBE it was because they were playing Lauren Hill and SWV at 9am? I need to recommend this spot to Elizabeth Gilbert so she can write a new book: EAT. BRUNCH. LOVE.",3,3,1

And waited. Meanwhile the staff behind the counter discussed their Friday nights and made coffees at a glacial pace. When I finally got to order, I was pretty snippy and became more so when my order of a piccolo was greeted with a confused look. I had to explain how to make it. Just not good enough considering the location of this place in the village.The food itself (grey dog bfast) was fine, but the counter staff need a kick in the head.There are better places than this in the west village,unfortunately most don't open early enough.",,,

144,Elle G.,"New York, NY",129,103,0,4.0,6/26/2015,"It seems whenever I'm here I'm usually just getting a muffin or a slice of banana bread or something like that - quick late breakfast but nothing too filling. So I can't personally vouch for most of the food. However I have occasionally asked people sitting next to me if they liked what they ordered. So far I've gotten good reviews on the egg sandwiches and some of the other sandwiches. (Portions look big, from what I've seen.) I do like the muffins and other pastries and was pleasantly surprised when I recently tried a gluten-free muffin. (They will toast it for you if you want and give you jam if you request it)It's cutely rustic inside and casual. They have a bathroom that is on the right side of the room if you're walking in - past the counter where you order food and drink.Staff seems nice and friendly. This is usually a good place to sit and read the paper if you come at a not terribly busy time. I've mostly been here between 11 and 12 on weekdays. If you come around 11 it isn't hard to get a table. The place seems to fill up for early-lunch crowd around 11:45 or so.",2,,1

So far I've just been getting the egg sandwich, and it's been good every single time. The Grey Dog has a couple or three locations in the city. This one happens to be close to my company's home office, and it's become one of my ""go to"" breakfast choices when I'm in the city on business.It's a coffee shop, right? So keep that in mind. It's coffee-shop atmosphere with good food and friendly staff. I like it because I can get in and get coffee and food straight away, and quickly be eating and getting my day off to a great start.",,,
146,Rory M.,"New York, NY",223,26,10,2.0,5/29/2015,"I really don't see the hype with this place. My coworkers crave it, but whenever I go I'm always disappointed. I've ordered their grilled cheese before, which was awful (I don't know how you can really make a bad grilled cheese...) and their chili wasn't something I'd write home about either. I also have had their fish tacos and those were just way too fried for me! I couldn't even taste the fish it was like they fried it completely well done and threw it into the tacos. The only thing I had tried that was ok so far was the quesadilla. The people that work there are absolutely lovely and it's a quick in and out for lunch. I wish I loved it and as you can see I've given it multiple tries (I'm sure I'll still keep trying), but it never really satisfies me.",3,,1

Breakfast sandwich on croissant with sausage/bacon: 9.50 (comes with a side of homefries)--I suppose you can't really go wrong with a breakfast sandwich, but I thought it had just the right balance of egg & cheese, and the cheese was sandwiched between the eggs, but it was thoroughly melted through.",,,

Place is cute wooden decor, attentive staff, and a interesting but cool feel to the place. I ordered the chicken tenders because I was kind of craving something chicken-y and I saw a picture of it on yelp and it looks good. I was also not disappointed, the chicken was moist and the serving size left me satisfied and full. The barbecue sauce was quality. The only downside was the breading was very granular and maybe skin taste a little dry. The side of fries were also very quality. My friend order the vegetable soup which was a little disappointing, you could clearly identified the taste of each vegetable ingredient however the consistency was a bit more of the purée. She also ordered the sweet potato fries which are pretty spectacular and worth getting again.Overall good diner experience for a casual snack and I would return in the future.",,,

I tend to get the combo of half a sandwich and soup (the carrot ginger soup is delicious). The vibe in the day time is chill and laid back; it has a cute little rustic charm. At the night, the place transforms into a more intimate setting; the lights dim and candles are placed on each table. I honestly don't have any complaints about this place. The staff is always nice and super attentive and they roll out the food pretty quickly. I've been to a couple of the other Grey Dog locations, but this one is by far my favorite.",,,

155,Sara M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,25,0,4.0,2/11/2017,"I love this place. It's the kind of place that makes me wish I had enough of a disposable income to be ""a regular"". When I worked in the area I went once every two weeks or so to pick up a muffin on my way to work (the pumpkin muffin is my go-to and is one of the best muffins, pumpkin or otherwise, I have ever had). I've had a few other baked goods and menu items there (sandwiches, etc.)  and all come in good portions and are delicious. The coffee is some of the best I've had in the city and they also make a really good chai, though I recommend only getting the chai ""for here"" (for some reason it never tastes as good when I got it to go... something to do with the tea to milk ratio, maybe?). The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect for either casual dining or setting up a laptop for a few hours, though the tables are very small. I've also used them for catering and they are reasonably priced, punctual, and provide everything you need to serve.I am knocking off a star because toward the end of the two-and-a-half years I frequented the Carmine St location, they seemed to have a lot of staff turnovers, and the service, once unfailingly pleasant and efficient, started to fluctuate. The staff was younger and at times not incredibly pleasant in the early hours. I also had a few instances with being given the wrong change, and with showing up at 7:30 (they open at 7) to find that no baked goods had come out of the oven yet. The prices also went up, to the point where I didn't get my morning muffin as often.Overall, it is an amazing local coffee shop and eatery that deserves continuing patronage to all of its locations.",1,,1

I can't say I've ever had anything I didn't like here. They also do half priced bottles of wine for happy hour, which I've yet to take them up on despite it clearly being an awesome deal.I also have to say, I think I actually like this location better than the original. While the original Carmine spot was bigger, the restaurant they took over (RIP Marinella) was always a nice place and I think Grey Dog feels a lot friendlier and more welcoming in its reincarnation, and the always friendly and helpful staff certainly contributes to that atmosphere.Best time to come for lunch is earlyish, 11:30-12:30. The closer you get to 12:30/1pm the more likely you are to stand in line a while.

Nothing snide.  Just very warm.  Tried the spinach/salmon/poached egg/avocado salad for breakfast - wow!  Something I would never have concocted by myself, but just a fantastically flavored meal. The softly poached eggs with the spinach and avocado was an eye opener. The smoked salmon added another level of flavor to this.  Came back for brunch a couple of days later - this time on the grilled cheese sandwich (with bacon of course) and their split pea soup.  I love split pea soup.  This was top notch. Thick. Well spiced.  Awesome.  Our whole party had great meals on both occasions. Definitely a winner if you are in the West Village area.",,,

It's laid back and cool, no one rushes you and it feels homey. The first time we came, we were a group of five on a Saturday around lunch time. They reserved a table for us with a bandanna and we waited in line to order our food. The line was long, but I think we got through it in around 10-15 minutes and then another 10 minutes or so for our food to arrive. Staff is super friendly.We've tried a number of things at this place and none of them has ever disappointed. In particular, their sandwiches are great and a large portion.Hummus and Feta sandwich is great - they are super easy with customization, too. Just pick the sandwich closest to what you want and they'll switch it around for you. I haven't ever run into any problems with it and I'm a serial customizer.Sour apple and brie with roasted turkey and raspberry mustard is fantastic as is the grilled chicken press (I believe that's their most popular sandwich). On all sandwiches you can pick the bread - they have about 6 options, all made in house. I love their nine grain, but all of the breads are great.Carrot ginger soup is good and a nice mix of being hardy yet light. Comes with peanuts on top, which is fun. I hear their turkey chili is great, but haven't tried it. Probably my least favorite of everything we've tried is the nacho dish. There's nothing special about it and it's not particularly big. I'd go with something else over that for sure.They also make a marble brownie, which is really good (and a large portion!), but is definitely on the sweet side. Not a big fan of super sweet brownies, but I do still like this one.I will say that I like the 49 Carmine location (which is new) the best. The chelsea location is just.not.nearly.as.good. I'd recommend going to this one.",,,

We walked over to the Grey Dog and it was quiet and not too crowded, although it filled up when we were leaving.

This isn't too bad for brunch in Manhattan.  All in all, it was pretty decent. Although I enjoyed the cappuccino, the food was nothing to write home about.  The general ambiance of the place is pretty casual, but also pretty busy.  Perhaps part of the frenzy comes from the ""self-serve"" aspect of the restaurant: patrons are responsible for getting their own silverware, napkins, and cups of water.  Even still, the wait staff was pretty nice and we received our food promptly.  I wouldn't be too opposed to re-visit, but it's definitely not on my list of favorite places to go.",,,

194,Lauren L.,"Manhattan, NY",89,228,0,5.0,3/26/2014,"SO happy that this location of Grey Dog finally opened.  The original location was on Carmine, but it closed awhile back and the owners finally found a new spot where Marinella restaurant used to be.  They completely gutted the place, and the new space is beautiful.  It has a similar feel to the other locations and the same great menu, but you can tell this one is special.  There is a quote in the doorway that says ""nothing crushes us"", and the owners, employees, and neighborhood are all very happy that they are finally back in the West Village.",1,1,1

196,David D.,"New York, NY",139,22,4,5.0,11/17/2015,"Delicious food, friendly service, lots of healthy and vegetarian options, and the charming, rustic decor all make the Grey Dog one of my favorite spots for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  The entrée salads are a delicious, filling meal all by themselves, and the sandwiches are scrumptious.",,,
197,Stephy S.,"Holmdel, NJ",154,646,119,3.0,8/8/2014,Cute place. Their menu looks spectacularly delicious. My friend and I both got sandwiches (she got a reuben and I got some chicken panini) but they were a bit dry. May have been a fluke though. Very busy but never felt rushed out!,,,
