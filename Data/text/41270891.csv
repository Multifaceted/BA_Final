Never had to ask for another drink! Why? Because he knew his clients! The bouncers here were always great to chat with! From Scotty D, Storm they made Whiskey trader a fun safe environment for us drinkers! Me and my wife always made this spot our goto place and our co-workers as well!!!! Too bad I don't live in the area anymore or I'd definitely be here all the time again :(  I wish I could take Fredy, Scotty D, Storm and move them to Seattle , Washington and have them run Whiskey Trader West Coast !!! LoL",,,

It's a nice spot to chill and they play really good music and the ambiance is chilled and you get complimentary popcorn. Their fireball shots were good served them chilled. Each fireball shot was $6.00 each. And Patron shots $9.00. Its a nice spot that gets crowded quick so when your in the midtown/ Broadway check it out. My Yelp family I'll check in on my next foodie adventure.Oh,1,,1

Horrible place where sexual assaults are apparently acceptable and the norm...We had to call the police and now they're currently reviewing the cameras to figure out if the perv is a repeat offender.  Great job at keeping your clientele safe, Whiskey Trader!",2,,

6,Sean D.,"New York, NY",248,25,4,4.0,10/23/2018,"They don't serve food here but they let you bring food in. This is especially a good case to get black tap burger to-go from down the street and bring it in there. Because who wants a milkshake, we want beer. This place is spacious and there's usually always a spot at a table or the bar. I like that it has a juke box because not every bar in midtown has them. If you go down the stairs near the bathrooms there's an area to play beer pong. The happy hour is pretty good during the weekdays. From 4-5 you can get $4 Budweiser, then it goes up a dollar every hour until normal price.",,,
7,Susan C.,"New York, NY",61,214,798,3.0,3/17/2018,"Friendly, chill sports bar to grab a beer, watch a game and hang with friends. Bartenders are good sports even if they don't agree with your choice of sports teams. Came here a few times, first time they had a one drink minimum per person, and the latest time was to watch this year's NFL division finals. They had free pizza that afternoon with purchase of a beer, which was a nice touch. Not too crowded on Saturday afternoons and evenings, each time we had a group of about 5-7 people and were able to be seated right away. Fairly typical selection of beers on tap and a fully stocked bar in case you wanted to order other drinks. They have specials on afternoons and during happy hours too, and reasonable prices considering the midtown location.",1,,1

They had a few specials- one being pickle backs- which I love. The bartender was personable and able to accommodate a full bar by himself. He was timely and considerate of all of time as well. One of the best bartenders I've seen in a while. The atmosphere was also nice. Dimly lit and lots of wood finishes to warm up the bar making it feel more cozy and intimate. Next time I'm in the city I will for sure be back. Everything you're doing Whiskey Trader, keep up the good work!",,,

Eventually when more people came, people started saying  ""no....we are paying all separate."" We even mentioned leaving if this was such an issue. Also, a few people stopped at the bar to grab their drink before seeing us because they didn't realize we had a server...which they were promptly reprimanded for...The waitress was just overall rude/cold and we were disappointed.

To take a pickle-back. Try and have an open mind here because I was surprised by how tasty it was. You take a shot of whiskey (Jamison I believe) and follow it with a shot of pickle juice. Okay, you're a bit grossed out right? But if you like pickles, then it's actually pretty good. But just in case you can follow it with a few swigs of beer and the taste is gone. I even ordered another round before we left. Here's my suggestion; if you are ever in Midtown you should go here, get some beer, maybe try a pickle-back and then do some people watching at Times Square with a nice buzz.",1,,

Updated review","Hi Brendan, I saw your reply to my Yelp comment and I appreciate the response. I understand Arun is a veteran at Whiskey Trader which actually makes me even more upset at the customer service I was given. My company celebrated our Holiday party at Whiskey Trader last year as well and encountered a similar situation with Arun. We reserved the back area of the bar from 8-10pm and when we arrived found another party already reserved for our spot. With no where else to go, and having our event catered, we shared the space and Arun did his best to accommodate us. This year we decided to have the event at your bar again and, to make sure we reserved it with enough time, made the reservation back in August. I spoke with Arun in August and he mentioned that it was so far in advance that he would assure us the space would be ours. I called back again in October to confirm and spoke with Arun again who re-confirmed the space was ours from 8-10pm. I called yesterday to notify Arun that we secured a caterer and to ask if we could change the reservation from 8-11pm. This is when Arun decided to tell me the space was booked for another party until 830 and asked if we could come at 9. By this point Arun had already known we were interested in the space since August, whether he put it in writing on the books or not. The fact that he would offer it to someone else and then tell us to change our time is completely ridiculous and bad business. I've secured a caterer and had around 50+ people attending...I can't even imagine what would have happened had we shown up. I understand that your policy says that a reservation needs to be in writing but last year we didn't sign anything either. In fact, this is the first time I am hearing anything about this. I am completely disappointed by this service and having it happen for the second year in a row I will not be recommending this to my friends and/or colleagues. I understand this is a he said/she said situation as it was never on your books but the fault is on your employee for never explaining that to us. If you checked your records last year you would see we hosted our event there too with no signed contract. If Arun was as good an employee as you say, and he acknowledged that we expressed interest in the space since August, then he should have followed up with us to confirm instead of us chasing him down; ultimately to have him screw us out of the space; AGAIN! Completely ridiculous and really bad business. Won't be recommending this space in the future.",6,1,
34,Angela T.,"Bronx, NY",2,27,0,2.0,1/15/2016,"I arranged a company happy hour and I chose here hoping that this place would be good. Unfortunately, it was not.For a midtown after work place, the music was deafening and it had three awful, horrendously rude waitresses, who were dressed tacky in short shorts (where are we? Florida?).When I asked one to turn the music down, she flat out said no. Then another, in her Russian accent and with nasty hair, that clearly hadn't seen a shower or brush in days, threatened me that no one would leave the establishment, if she didn't get someone's credit card. Yes, you read that right: this moron thought 15 business people would rush the door and not pay! After that, she randomly decided that cc's required a $20 minimum.The only thing that saved this place was the free popcorn and she was pretty good about keeping us supplied with that.",2,2,
35,Melissa L.,"Portland, OR",1563,1174,983,3.0,2/16/2015,"Some new friends took us here for a drink.    Upon entry they had a rack you could hang your coat.  Headed to the bar and after about 5 minutes we were able to get seats for a group of 4.  Ordered a round of Moscow mules.  Meh.  Doesn't seem NYC has that down yet.  I switched to cranberry vodkas, while the rest of the group switched to different mixed drinks.Prompt service.  Plus, Bar serves you popcorn, which you will inevitably eat while drinking, even if you aren't hungry. Noticed a beer pong table downstairs by the bathrooms (no one was using it, while I was there.)Probably a totally different vibe later in the night versus 6pm on a Saturday.",,,
36,Cece Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2,726,711,3.0,1/23/2016,"This bar looks divey from the outside, but walk inside and you'll find that it's actually pretty clean.  Still comfy and casual.  One minor caveat: You're going to smell like the free popcorn when you leave.We arrived early so there were still plenty of seating available, both at the bar and tables. There's a huge flatscreen TV over the bar so you can watch whatever sports game is on.  There are also some couches in the back area, which can be reserved for large groups.",,1,
37,Brad L.,"Anchorage, AK",10,15,10,2.0,2/19/2017,"It would be a cool bar if people were ever there. I was one of maybe 8-10 people in a bar set up for college style partying with dance music and beer pong. I went on a weekday and a Saturday night; both were slow nights with no one dancing or playing beer pong. Also, I was not pleased how they cleaned around me the entire time I was there, 2 hours before closing time. I felt like they wanted me to leave.",,,
38,Jesy B.,"Portland, OR",205,575,30,3.0,6/13/2014,"Hmmmm. Whiskey Trader, you're kind of an odd duck. We were walking around looking for a place to grab some drinks and picked this place since people on Yelp said it had good prices and drink specials. Which it did. What it did NOT have was consistent pricing. I ordered a vodka soda which cost $8, but a shot of Stoli O (I believe) was $5. Huh? Well vodka cost more? Same with my boyfriend's drink. He got a whiskey soda, $8 - but a shot of Jameson cost less? Does soda water cost $3 or something? Yeah, NYC is expensive but the ""specials"" applied who knows when. It said all day...and when I did just get a Stoli shot it was $5. HEADSCRATCHER. Service was fine - except when the bartender's friend showed up and we watched them down shot after shot. I always find it weird when bartenders drink heavily at work, but that's just me. The space was very well laid out with nice TVs to watch the game on, and they had beer pong tables if you wanted to play. Overall, it's okay but the pricing thing really ticked me off so I doubt I'd be back.",5,3,1
39,Jen R.,"Milwaukee, WI",106,43,37,4.0,2/7/2017,Great place for cheap drinks and to get drunk at. Free popcorn is a bonus. Watched the super bowl here and they gave free pizza out. Umm yes.,,,
40,Phatsoo18 R.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,2.0,11/6/2015,"First off my co-workers and I used to come to this place at least 2-4 times a month.  This was the best pre-game spot hands down.  Good music, and cheap booze, plus its down the street from the office.  Now, I doubt that we will ever come back.  At one time they offered $3 bud light pints and $5 Jay-mo shots all night long along with there other specials.  Then they implemented a 7pm cut off.  We scaled back.  It's been a while so we decided to check it out.  The once sought out Bud Light Jay-mo specials now ends at 5pm.  Really?  I noticed this time is wasn't as packed at it usually is, now I know why.  $11.75 for 2 Bud Lights?!  $4 I can understand, even $5.  If I am paying more than that $5 for cheap beer I rather spend it on a more tasty beer which is justifiable.One of the other issues why we scaled back, the 7pm cut off wasn't the end of the world, was asking for an itemized receipt.  They don't give it to you automatically.  Let's face it, if it wasn't for the cheap specials we wouldn't step down in this place.  Its dirty, has a smell of old beer and puke.  The sound system sounds muffled, as a result of a few blown out speakers.  But 5pm happy hour cut off?  Don't you guys know your demographic audience?  People are just getting out of work at 5pm.",1,,
41,David K.,"San Jose, CA",108,182,417,3.0,11/10/2014,"The place is pretty cheap, they had $5 shots and beer cost $6 I think. They also give you free popcorn and there's several TVs in the bar area, which was great on Friday night because my buddy and I could watch the NBA while having our drinks. One of the good things about this bar was that they had Goose Island. As someone from Chicago, it's always nice to find a place that has the Chicago-based beer.The music is pretty loud, so it's not a great place for talking. It wasn't very crowded though, even on a Friday night at 11:30pm. They also have free wifi, the password is posted along the back wall, behind the bar.Oh, their location is just a couple blocks north of the infamous Halal Guys. Get a buzz going, then head down 2 blocks and get some chicken and rice. Just watch out that you don't pour a crazy amount of hot sauce in your drunken stupor. Your mouth and stomach will hate you more than your liver hates you for drinking.",,2,

I come in and an older caucasian male bartender sneezes and attempts to shake my hand, I deny politely by signaling a salutation with a head nod. Then I request a food menu as a large portion of sports bars in midtown east usually do, where the bartender threw multiple menu's on the bar table and told me to order out! I deny the order out menu's where he proceeds to say order a drink or leave-pretty rude, so I just left. Do yourself a favor-don't come here in Sundays, heck don't come here at all!",1,,1
43,Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1565,364,209,4.0,8/23/2014,"My friends are such weirdos. Don't worry, I don't say anything behind their backs that I wouldn't say right to their faces. I say that they are weirdos because we started the night at one of those bars where drinks are $18/mixed cocktail and $9/beer, got some slices, then came to Whiskey Tavern. Still dressed to the 9's from our previous gathering, we strolled into the bar with about 10 people and proceeded to turn the place into our own personal party.The drinks were obviously cheaper than the last bar, and there was a good level of alcohol in them. I hate when they give you a glass that appears to have nothing in it, but the same is true for a drink that tastes like it was mixed at a local frat party. Whiskey Tavern, much like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, got it juuuuust right. The music was fantastic. It was like party music from 1996-now. Such a fun mix. There were a few songs where we actually stopped our conversations to remark, ""Oh, wow. I haven't heard this song in forever!"" It is definitely conveying a sense of don't take yourself too seriously, grab a beer and have some fun.Bathrooms were clean and well-stocked, and no line to get in. That alone deserves a star. We also got a game of beer pong going down on the basement level. As we got drunker we started games with the free popcorn, such as ""put your beer on the ledge and we are all going to try to throw popcorn into it."" I know, I know -- the custodial staff must hate us, but I made most of my shots.**Comparatively speaking. Actual ratio was about 1/5.",,,1

Not sure about the scene here for happy hour but I came here with a friend pretty late at night close to 1:30 AM. The crowd was mixed from young adults to creepy old guys with toupees trying to take home the bartenders. I had a moscow mule for the first time and it was delish. Tried a strawberry margarita and it tasted like old candy...the bartender was sweet enough to switch it out for a new drink. Blue long island was solid as well. Prices were good considering you can pay 15+ for drinks in Manhattan. They also have a popcorn machine which they will serve right to you which is awesome - the less I have to get up the better. Wouldn't be my first choice for a bar during regular hours but it's nice to know they're open super late (4 am) if you want to get your creep on or if you're looking for a chill place to get a few strong drinks and stumble back to your apartment or hotel. 4 drinks and three shots came to 61 bucks. Not bad.,,1,

The place is pretty divey and dark, but we found some seats by the bar and saw the drink specials. $3 draft bud light, $5 shots. We indulged. We had a few shots and beers and just sat and talked. They also had free wifi, which was pretty nice since I don't have a smart phone and could connect my ipod touch (I know, I'm living in the past but I'm upgrading soon). I think the absolute selling point that really made this place great was the bartender. Granted it wasn't too busy, but she was just sooooooo attentive. She recommended drinks for my female friend and kept coming back whenever she noticed our drinks were low. I think the thing that surprised me the most was that she kept coming back even when my female friend was drinking water at one point and asking if she wanted more water. I've never gotten that kind of service at any other bar. I wish I got her name so I could mention her here, but alas, I did not. On the way to the bathroom I noticed that there was a sitting/lounging area, but we didn't really look over there and just stayed at the bar. Also people keep talking about free popcorn, but we didn't get any :( I don't know if they stopped doing that or if it was just that day, but a little sadness, but I won't hold it against them.",1,,
50,Ray L.,"New York, NY",17,86,13,4.0,5/20/2015,"Great after-work bar.Lots of TV screens showing different sports and an extensive whiskey menu!Servers are really nice and they provide you with free popcorn so you don't stumble around the entire place on an empty stomach.It's a bit loud (so our server mistook one of our orders) and probably not great for big groups. And it's not an elegant bar by any means, but definitely solid!I'd go back again.",,,1

Music is always at a perfect volume and bartenders are always good. Oh, and you get unlimited free popcorn. This place will give you a genuine southern feel, like you're in Tennessee, hardwood floors, walls, ceiling etc. Great place to take friends and chat.",1,,

The whole box was ten cents. Here, it's all yours.""Couple with candy cane: ""Awesome.""Guy: ""Can I get a rum punch and...""Barkeep: ""What's in a rum punch?""Guy: ""It's a girly thing.

On the rocks.""Same guy, unprovoked: ""Man, I know so many fucking bar jokes, I could go ALL NIGHT.""Us: -slow nodding-Big fan. Post 9pm, only slightly less a fan because the gentle giant bartender passes the torch to the younger, buxom and bitchy staff and the clientele gets sorta douchey.

The bouncer was really friendly! The bartenders were super attentive, but the hype over the popcorn is a little over the top - they didn't refill any of the bowls around us and didn't seem concerned with it. We ordered dark & stormys from the happy hour menu (I think they were $8), and they were pretty decent - not great because they weren't mixed that well. The scene is pretty divey, but you could easily go to watch a game or hang out with friends. The music is on point though - great throwback tunes.

Found whiskey traders thanks to Yelp (I specifically searched dive bars :-D)  and we made our way there from the apple store,  hence the need for a cheap drink lol. So we entered at 9pm and the bar was packed lucky we managed to nab two seats at the corner of the bar. I ordered a house vodka with a dash of sprite and cranberry (a poor girls cosmo ) and my mom ordered a beer. Our lovely bartender toyah(?) suggested that I choose from the board of the all time happy hour specials as the house vodka was the same price as a cocktail. I decided to take her advice and switch to a raspberry margaritas . The measure is descent to say it's house liquor and the margarita mix is tasty my mum got a Brooklyn larger and was in her words ""perfect it was chilled to a perfect temp with a decent all the way down the glass head"". I also love the fact they give u popcorn.All in all whiskey traders delivered all we were looking for, decent drinks, a nice atmosphere and great customer services. Thanks you guys.

In the dessert of decent bar options that is the upper midtown area, this was a nice find. I arrived at around 6:00, and there were plenty of other patrons but it wasn't overcrowded. There were games on all of the television screens, and music playing on the loudspeakers, but the noise was not so loud as to prevent conversation at a reasonable ""loud voice"" level.The happy hour deals aren't too bad, though I wasn't interested in any of them myself. $3 pints of Bud light, $8 margaritas and mojitos, $5 shots. I got a Yuengling, not on the HH menu but at $6 kind of a standard Manhattan price for the brand. One of my colleagues got me a whiskey sour, which was done pretty well, but I'm not sure what the price was. The free popcorn was a nice touch, though I was annoyed that my repeated requests for a refill were ignored even after 4 new people joined our group. All in all, I think I'll probably be coming back.

Service was horrible. When I finally did get served my drink wasn't good at all. I don't know if the bartender was new but she definitely didn't know what she was doing. On top of this she was very rude. Neither of the bartenders paid much attention to the customers because they spent most of their time playing on their cell phones.

71,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,4.0,1/16/2012,"Whiskey Trader is really one of the better bars in the city for sports viewing without having to deal with all the typical douchebaggery. That way, you can belt out the national anthem at full volume with your group of ten bros during the pre-game. You can order consecutive bomb shots lined up on one full end of the bar at the half, without being judged by the staff. You can stomp on the floor and chant at the top of your lungs for your team (whom actually isn't even playing that day) whenever you Goddamn please. You can pretty much own this spot if you come equipped with enough unbridled testosterone and hooligan fanaticism.OK, so maybe we were those douchebags.Still, Whiskey Trader is made up of a series of open rooms, one after another, so for example, there's always the option to chill in the candlelit lounge section, complete with couches and a classy fireplace, instead of getting rowdy in the middle, main bar area. There's even a smaller space further back that has additional seating, foosball, and a few old-school arcade games. Plus, TVs are everywhere, so you can catch the game in any section, no matter your personal brand of comfort. And there were stairs to an apparent second floor that we didn't even bother to explore, honestly.But we remained in the heart of the establishment, the center of attention, at the long wooden bar where we were never without a basket of free popcorn (!) in front of us and $5 Jager and Jameson shots were always readily accessible. Both the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly, attentive, and hard-working. I was even impressed with the complimentary coat racks, something typically replaced with a bored-to-death female collecting bills to put your jacket on a hanger. Plus tip.From the outside, Whiskey Trader looks like your standard Midtown pub with its unassuming storefront and strip club entrance awning. And what it may lack a bit in character is certainly made up for with super-reasonable bar tabs, loads of space, and choices between sofa and a martini, bar stool and a beer, or on your feet with a joystick. I went in with zero expectations for this place. I came out with a new go-to sports bar in this part of town.",2,1,1

Updated review","Basement-y dark bar with CHEAP drink specials and mostly miserable staff.Since we go here every other week, I figured I had to update to 3 stars. After all, if a place wasn't at least A-OK why would I keep going? Honestly it would be higher, but the girls behind the bar can be quite rude...like...almost all the time. Some of the table service girls are nice though.I started tipping more thinking that would help. It didn't.But whatever, it's not a dealbreaker. They have good happy hour specials:(until 8pm)$3 draft bud light$5 shots (jameson, picklebacks, fireball)$7 Patron shots$7 margaritas and mojitos$7 sangria....and THAT my fellow yelpers, is why you come to Whiskey.I will never understand why people come here for the popcorn.

I make good popcorn at home on my stove. The shit they make at TWT is of no note whatsoever except to those who are drunk and starving. It's salty GMO styrofoam provided to line your stomach in a flimsy defense against the many cocktails/beers that you are going to consume here with no access to any real food whatsoever. The crowd here is not interesting unless interesting to you is a bunch of guys in suits coming straight from their office jobs, and cocktail waitresses in embarrassing attire. In fact, the way the staff dress is part of the reason I'll never be back. I cannot support a business that demeans its female employees by requiring them to wear horribly unflattering and inappropriate outfits.There are a zillion places in midtown with better scenes, better music, actual food, employees who are wearing clothes on their bodies, and infinitely superior spaces.

89,Melanie C.,"Southport, CT",209,2,0,2.0,1/12/2015,"Bartender humiliated me in front of several customers. My friend and I both had open tabs, but then decided we wanted to split a bottle of prosecco on our credit cards. The bartender explained he couldn't combine our tabs, so we closed out our tabs to open up a new one to pay for the bottle together. I am a server and I split the bill for people all the time with no hassle, so I didn't think the bartender would mind accommodating us. But oh, he did. Side note: Business was relatively slow at this time.Reason 1 for not wanting to split the tab: his shift was ending soon (how should this affect me?) Reason 2: the credit card minimum was $12, our totals would've been $12.50 a piece (mind you, we are both servers, we would've tipped well over 20% on each card and we are on a tight budget) So I cave, and just say something like ""okay whatever you can just put it all on my card"" and yes, honestly I was kind of pissed! We do this kind of thing for people at my place of work all the time and I really didn't understand why he was being such a jerk about it since he claimed their policy was $12 minimum on credit cards.Bartender's response: ""do you have some kind of problem?""And I say, well, ""yes I just don't see why you can't accommodate us, we closed our original tabs so we could split this one""Bartender points his finger and tells my face ""you have a snooty attitude, and we don't do snooty here.""

94,Mike O.,"Manhattan, NY",53,141,20,3.0,8/31/2012,"They have a happy hour here on bud light drafts for 3 dollars, 5 dollar Mojitos, and 5 dollar shots, not including tequila, which I believe we're 7 dollars.We agreed that the Mojitos were lacking not only in alcohol, but taste as well. I typically find it hard to find good Mojitos, which can be due to the mount of time and effort it takes to make one, and this was one of those places. Make it enough times, and a bartender would care less how it comes out an hour into happy hour.The bartender was often hard to get her attention at times too. She was by herself, and munching at the end of the bar. I guess they were under staffed that day.We left shortly after. May come back for the three dollar drafts though.Cheers",2,,

96,Pat P.,"St John's Wood, London, United Kingdom",173,336,0,3.0,8/15/2013,"Okay, so it's not a magnificent venue with breathtaking decor and a soft, poetic ambiance like most whiskey enthusiasts would prefer. Having said that, the only thing that's remotely ""whiskey"" about this place is the name, so I certainly wouldn't go expecting a grand single-malt soiree. What it is is a casual bar that welcomes anyone and will get quite loud during game days. The drinks are cheap, the popcorn is free, and the staff is generally hit or miss. Call it a dive bar in Midtown East, and you'll find yourself here more than you might expect.",,,

We were there during Happy Hour and it was Halloween time so there were cauldrons of candy and the famous and DELICIOUS freshly popped and salted popcorn! It's FREE and UNLIMITED! =)Drink specials are pretty cool too. Got a few rounds of patron shots and at $5 a pop, why not?The atmosphere is fun (though the night we were there it was a packed house filled to the brim with ""monkey suits"" as my friend would put it). They also have a foosball table and pretty friendly staff. It was a good times with good people! i would go again :)",,,

Instead, she told me to go a few doors down to Whiskey Trader for happy hour. This place has a very odd crowd, a mix of businessmen, tourists, sport fanatics, and a few (heavy on the few) girls who probably work in the area. Music is blaring, but not bad, TV's are always on a sports channel, also not bad. For drink specials they have a 5 dollar pear martini that is quite strong, 3 dollar bud lights, 5 dollar shots of some sort, so yeah it's got good deals. The bartenders are in weird get ups with their mid drifts showing as though it is their take on Coyote Ugly. Video games are scattered about, as is seating so try and find one but be okay with standing if need be. Having a seat also means you get some free popcorn.Honestly, I would come back here, but only after I have had a really rough day at work.",,,
102,Bryon B.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,104,0,2.0,2/28/2012,"So I gotta write a review about this place. My Co-workers and I come here pretty often after a shift at the restaurant. The seats are comfortable, the beer and liquor selections are OK and occasionally they have decent drink specials. The truth is though, we only really come here because of its proximity to our work, and the fact that after we all leave, we all spread out to each of the 5 boroughs + NJ. I probably wouldn't come back on my own, and it's not exactly the place I tell my friends about. The drink specials are often shots with names like ""The Blowjob"" or ""The Pornstar"" and the whole place has a skeezy vibe that is only amplified by the scantily clad bartenders (who seem to be hired more for their looks than actual bar-tending ability)The music at times can be a bit overpowering, and although they have a digital jukebox, if you put on a genre of music or a song they don't like they'll quickly turn down the jukebox to play their own house music (even if you're one of the only people in the bar) In addition to that, more than once I've seen there be issues with the security at the bar. They kicked one of my co-workers out immediately after he came in because he tripped over a coat rack in the middle of the floor (accusing him of being drunk), and one of the bouncers spend an inordinate amount of time hitting on an other one of my coworkers.  I've seen one or two fights go down on the premises the times I've been there, I can't blame them for being overzealous in keeping out potentially problem-causing drunks, but the advances on my female coworker was kind of creepy. The popcorn is pretty bad, and half the times I've had it it's been burned. So that's something to consider. But the lounge is a decent place to hang out (when it's not busy) and the Jameson and pickle-back special they've been running recently is pretty decent. This still isn't enough to mitigate the negative aspects of my experiences there, It's a midtown bar that really caters to the midtown hotel crowd, and to be honest I'm probably not going back.",2,,1
103,Tina D.,"Brooklyn, NY",107,147,13,3.0,5/11/2014,"Came here on a Friday afternoon with coworkers. They dim the lights at five, so it has a chill feel around there. The crowd is a decent mix, with it leaning towards older gentlemen. There is a beer pong table in the far back, a lounge area in the back, and typical bar layout in the main area. Decent jukebox and happy hour prices ($8 margaritas/mojitos; $5 shots; $3 Bud Light pints). Not the best, not the worst in the area. Service isn't too shabby either--free popcorn anyone?",1,,

The weekend bartender, Jim, is absolutely no shit an old school NYC bartender and is the best.  The music is awesome!  You can order food delivery right to the bar or bring in something from a local sandwich spot of your choice.  Jim will do his best to put a sports event of your choice on one of the TV screens right at the bar and is great at keeping your drink full.  An excellent spot and I strongly recommend the place.  We come here almost every visit to NYC and enjoy it every time.",,,
108,Ted D.,"Addison, Dallas, TX",14,50,5,2.0,2/18/2014,"Very limited beer options make this bar stand out in contrast to any other bar I visited in NYC. There are no adventurous options. The place was dark but I like that atmosphere. 2 of the 3 TVs had color issues, but they did have pro wrestling on so that was fun to watch while drinking. They brought me free popcorn which was meh but I idly ate it anyways. The bartenders seemed to ignore the waitress who would come by to get drinks for the patrons sitting in the table area, and she would usually yell  getting my attention but surprisingly not the bartenders'. One creepy old guy at the bar told one of them how much he liked the song that was playing, then she danced around for him some, and her tip on the bar got larger. It was an interesting experience but I don't think I'd go back when there are plenty of options around.",1,,1

I wasn't expecting to find much in the area (I generally avoid midtown for the sake of my budget!) but I was pleasantly surprised to note the drink special signs beckoning us down the dark stairway. Happy hour goes until 9PM on Saturday?? What devilry is this?? We decided to give it a shot. $5 mango mojitos and free popcorn! $20 worth of delicious, mango-y mojito and two bowls of popcorn later, I was pleasantly buzzed. Fortunately, this bar was not busy at all so no one really noticed or got in the way of my trips to the bathroom (a real plus not having to deal with massive lines!). I also liked that there were different sports playing on the large TVs and projector screens - I am not much of a sports fan but I do turn into one when I've had a few.

116,Amy C.,"Washington, DC",558,946,44,3.0,11/22/2009,"One of my friends celebrated her birthday here, citing this as one of her favorite spots. I arrived with a girlfriend and a guy friend. None of us was aware that there was a dress code. After checking out the Yelp reviews (which calls this place a ""sports bar"") and the website (which says ""casual neat""), I didn't think I had to warn my guy friend. But when we arrived, the bouncer told him he couldn't go in because he was wearing Tims. In spite of our pleas, even from the birthday girl who's a regular costumer, he refused to give him admittance. He said there was a strict dress code, yet he was letting in guys in dirty sneakers and baggy jeans. Beside the boots, my friend was dressed very ""neatly."" In the end, he decided to give up and go home.The argument we had with the bouncer brought the mood down. Besides that... There's no cover, free coat check, the drinks are very reasonably priced for this area, the bartenders are great, and the music is a great mix of merengue, bachata, and contemporary pop hits. I wish I can say the same about the crowd though. The place was filled with mostly guys (I would say it seemed like 3/4 of the place was guys). A group of them attempted to follow me and my girlfriend to the train station when we left. I think the bouncers should worry more about shady costumers and their costumers' safety than ONE guy with boots.",,2,

I had come here a few times and then reserved a few tables at the back section for my birthday. It was perfect for everyone to sit on couches and relax.

Try it I did and subsequently fell a little head over heels for the dark surroundings, 3 floors, mindless music right off of Z100 and, last but not least, the supremely cheap happy hour with incredibly long hours. I tried their Mojito, which was delicious, but I really prefer an after work beer, and switched it right up. My friend had an apple martini (Yep, she's fancy) which was exactly how I think an apple martini should taste. While I'm no mixologist, I certainly have had my fair share of spirits and I'm telling you it tasted good. Once happily buzzed, we gossiped and chatted until our dinner reservations around 8, where we parted ways to consume much needed sustenance to try and absorb the alcohol swimming in our stomachs. I will go back, but mostly because it's right near my office and, let's call a spade a spade, the cheaper the booze, the more you drink.",1,1,1

Updated review","Ok, I have to amend. On second visit, despite the fairly empty bar the bartender guy gave way too much 'tude and to people requesting games to watch on the tv screens. He was flustered and just didn't have the brains to juggle game lineup. Worse of all, he would change channels right after you requested a game- without telling you. So you settle in with your drink and then OH- channel change to another game. Not cool. Why did that  happen? Well I'll tell ya. Having listened to the bartender chat with a barback, all they want to do to customers who walk in looking for their game on the tv is to give them their game, suck them into buying a drink and then he changes the channel! If that wasn't bad enough, a graver sin was committed: changing the channel with 2 minutes left in a game. WTF is that?? All the free popcorn in the world isn't worth the uncertainty and annoyance of all the tv channel switching. So, definitely not an ideal sports bar. Don't come here if you want to watch your game uninterrupted.",,,

They made my husband take off his Minnesota Twins baseball hat as there were no hats permitted for men. Kind of weird. The bar is so loud you can not hear one another. The drinks were way over poured and I think something was wrong with their soda machine which made you regret getting a mixed drink and wish you got a beer. They serve popcorn which smells terrible and I did not eat it. Its dark and cramped. My husband quickly regretted using the bathroom as it was so tiny almost impossible to get in and out of without running into another person. There are plenty of TV's but few places to take a seat. The wait staff are female and dressed very provative. Our waitress was friendly but she could bareley hear us and we really could not hear her.
