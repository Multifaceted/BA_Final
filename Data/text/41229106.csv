0,Cristián L.,"New York, NY",335,3,0.0,5.0,10/21/2018,Had a birthday celebration with my friends last night and it was a blast! The workers here were super friendly and very social. It was fun interacting with them. We rolled through with a whole lot of friends and did a two hour open bar. I appreciated  not having to put a down payment beforehand unlike other places when we were looking around for a space. We was able to order from the bar AND they had staff walking around serving drinks/food and they was on point! The second my cup was empty they asked if I wanted another drink. So much fun. Open bar price was great.Would so gather there again for a guaranteed good time.,,,

3,Nan N.,"Brooklyn, NY",264,141,190,1.0,1/14/2018,"Trash. Ever factor that could be bad was. Had a reservation for 3pm Sunday. Due to the large football crowd, we didn't get our table until 3:30. Okay, that's out of their control and it is a bar scene. By the time we got seated and with the menu, our server told us the brunch and unlimited brunch drinks was not available because it ends at 4pm. Okay... That's not what your website says (brunch until 4, drinks til 5) but we'll go with the excuses. Onto the food: pulled pork Benedict - with NO hollandaise!! We told the guy who brought out the food that it was missing. His reply, ""do you still want it?""  we asked for them to just bring the hollandaise sauce out separately. Surprise surprise, it never came. Roasted potatoes with our dishes were actually crispy and cooked well. The parmesan truffle fries which came with ketchup, spicy mayo, and another sauce were actually good and seasoned well. Lamb burger: not bad. Bar standards, and not overcooked. Duck hash and breakfast roll were meh Bloody Mary's: Mary would come back from the grave and splash this stuff into the maker's face. BOTTOM LINE: boozy brunch bomb",4,1,

The quizmaster is a lot of fun and explains the rules thoroughly for every one who is new and all the veterans alike. The entire trivia night consists of 8 rounds with 8 questions per round. Yea, it's a lot. You're able to ""joker"" any round you want to double your points. For all you as competitive as I am, there is one team who has won consecutively for 16 months. Tuesday night specials include Sam Adams ($7) and house margaritas ($7). The bartender is so friendly! She makes a GREAT margarita! The bar food in standard and not very impressive. In the heart of East Village, great food is a short walk away. All in all, a great place to spend your Tuesday night!",1,,

Then again, what are you doing at a sports bar before noon?I like the Blind Pig because it does not mess around. It flies the Arsenal flag with pride yearlong, but when the team is not playing they will have whatever live sports are on at that time. Fair to say I am only here for Arsenal matches or trivia night (Tuesdays at 8!), but if I needed a sports bar in a pinch, the Blind Pig more than suffices.The food is actually decent bar food, especially the sweet potato fries and boneless chicken wings. They also have a few decent bottled beers available, which is a must for me. This is simply a quality sports bar in East Village.",,,
8,Hadley H.,"New York, NY",110,93,118,4.0,8/7/2017,"When it came to ambiance, this bar didn't really stand out in comparison to other sports bars. It did, however, surprise me with its food options!I love greasy bar food, but it's not always what I want when I go out on a Friday night.  The Apple and goat cheese salad that I ordered was abundant and delicious!  My friend ordered a burger, and it was so large that she couldn't close it.  The fried egg on top was cooked to perfection.  I want to try the baked zucchini flatbread, and wouldn't mind sampling their brunch menu as well.  The waitress brought us the check well before we were ready to leave - we easily could have ordered a couple more drinks each.  We didn't really understand this, as there were still plenty of other open tables.  Otherwise, great establishment, I'll definitely keep it in mind for a second try.",1,,

10,Victoria S.,"New York, NY",346,111,49,3.0,12/17/2017,"Fun atmosphere- great sports bar. I came here for a brunch with a very large group of friends. I would recommend their brunch, just not for large parties (there were about 15 of us) The staff was very busy and was not equipped to handle such a large party. Plus, there wasn't a table big enough for the large group, so we had to be broken up, which isn't the best situation as guests. The food was surprisingly great though - i had an omelette with bacon, mushrooms and cheese, i loved it! Plus with brunch, you can pick the bottomless option with mimosas and/or Bloody Marys! Or if you do not want bottomless - a free beverage is provided with your meal. I would definitely come back to watch a game or for brunch - just with a smaller party ;)",2,1,1
11,Adam S.,"Blooming Prairie, MN",88,1,0,1.0,11/4/2018,One of the worst bars I've ever been to. Maybe the worst. Went in there today at 11 am to get a bloody and breakfast in hopes of watching the Chelsea game. Me and my mom were the only people in the bar and the cool hipster guy with the curly mustache and remote said the game wasn't on. It was. He then said he needed to have the TVs set to the football games. So for an hour we sat watching screens with team logos on them. The food was cold and gross. My eggs Benedict had an uncooked English muffin with burnt slices of ham. The Bloody Mary was terrible. To add insult to injury the piece of celery more closely resembled a tooth pick. If you're thinking about going here I'd recommend just going to seven 11 and getting a beer and some snacks and brown bagging it on their patio since no one else is going to be sitting there. I had to ask to get a cup of water. Enough said. Blind pig sucks.,,,

It's a noisy sports bar, but we didn't mind. Their happy hour is pretty good, and the food is decent However, when we got the bill at the end of the night, we noticed that we'd been charged an extra $12 drink that none of us had ordered. They included a gratuity in the bill for us, but when we calculated it, they put a 22% gratuity on the TAXED amount, not just the subtotal. I'm glad we caught this because my bill ended up being $15 cheaper. We asked the waitress to take the extra drink off, and to not automatically add gratuity. They did so and everything worked out fine, but I don't like this business tactic at all. Will not be returning.",,,1
19,Caitlyn W.,"New Orleans, LA",202,25,27,5.0,7/31/2018,"This is such a great neighborhood bar! We love the outside seating and our dog frequently joins us when the weather is nice. Apparently they also have additional seating in the back patio that we haven't checked out yet. We also come here a good bit for trivia on Tuesday. The service is always top notch and we've never had any issues. Unlike most bars, they actually have really good food for a bar which is a great selling point for me! Happy hour deals are pretty good as well. I like to come for the boneless wing deal on Wednesday's! Sangria tastes more like a fruit punch but still delicious. They've gone above and beyond to accommodate us when there was a specific game we wanted to watch. Overall, a great neighborhood bar and everyone we've encountered has been friendly-unusual for the city and we've been here a lot!",,,
20,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",276,412,694,3.0,4/23/2018,"Came here for drinks after Happy Hour and prior to dinner and more drinks. Fairly easily to get a seat being that the real crowd didn't come yet. Didn't order anything too crazy that the bartender couldn't grab. I was super excited about my fries though! Fries were super crispy so it was the perfect way to kind of sober up before rallying again. I don't think I was a big fan of the service because it took quite a while to get some attention although it was still fairly dead. Wouldn't consider this a super clean venue as well, but it is your typical dive bar so you can't expect much out of it. Pretty on par with all of the other dive bars!",,,
21,Gladys N.,"Rahway, NJ",2,48,17,5.0,2/23/2018,"I have been waiting to write a review as I wanted to ensure it was PROPER!First things first, reservations- I called to make a reservation for a party of 30 for a Sunday brunch with not much notice. NO PROBLEM. Upon arrival at 12pm, (we had a 1pm reservation for the unlimited mimosa etc) we were seated in a large area, our party ended up being 37, so they were VERY accommodating and gave us a bigger space... they started serving us drinks with NO issue that the clock hadn't officially started. We ordered some pitchers of beers and mingled until everyone arrived.  Our server Jen was PHENOMENAL. That young lady took everyone's order without skipping a  beat and without delay, I AM TALKING ABOUT 37 people and 7 of them were kids, NO SMALL TASK!Our food order was FINE considering our party size, they (Jen and Luis the kitchen server) were PATIENT, were quick when needing to correct or add to the order and all while being professional. There was a little bit of a mix up but by no fault of theirs at all.The food itself was DELICIOUS, so much so that we had two pregnant ones in our party (not part of the boozy brunch) order twice!  Everything on the menu was SPOT ON. It was a LOVELY experience for our group and the celebration (25yr surprise) went off smoothly. Others at the bar were very gracious with our loud group!From the owner, to the bartender (awesome shots!) to Jen and Luis, THANK YOU!!We will absolutely be back here. CHECK THEM OUT!!",,,1

It's only 4 o'clock.  After he dropped off our TWO beers he never checked on us again or to see if everything was okay. Wouldn't come back. Plus beer didn't seem right. Not the end of the world, but it seemed like him trying to hide that he was taking a shot was only thing that made him happy.",,,

28,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,1.0,5/19/2017,"I came here to meet with some folks from the hometown that I hadn't seen in a long time. I'm sure I have walked by here before, but the easiest way to identify the Blind Pig is any sign of Arsenal paraphernalia that is hanging up (as I found out, this is the spot to be to watch their games). It's a decently-sized space, and when the weather is nice, opening up the windows lets what would be a typical dive bar experience otherwise breathe a bit more. Nonetheless, the beer selection is not that great - only a few crafts available at most - and the bartender took quite some time to get my beer and close my tab, despite not being all that busy. Being seated was not a much better experience, either - it took quite some time to get our order in, and all of our entrees slowly got served, one by one - and they gave my burger to someone else entirely, and I ended up with a turkey and bacon burger. It was not one of the better burgers I have had, to put it kindly; the texture of the patty was rubbery and dry, and the bacon was pretty limp and uninspired as well. The fries were at least solid, but the boneless chicken wings were very dry, despite having an okay crisp. We also inexplicably watched a waitress drop two beers on the ground - one of them while she was trying to clean up the other - and it took us a while to get our check to close out.It's an okay space, and the trivia on Tuesday nights is fun, but outside of solely that reason, I would probably not find myself back here anytime soon, whether it be for a meal or for a drink. There are plenty of better options in this city on both fronts at the same kind of price point.",6,1,1

The waitress failed to point out to us that she added a tip to our bills. I waited tables for years and never in an establishment that condoned this sort of behavior. If a party of six warrants a compulsory tip, that's fine. You should notify the members of the party that are paying so they do not double tip. This is a one star review as I cant recommend anyone frequenting establishments that either allow employees to add a gratuity without pointing it out, or employ waitresses that try to scam the clientele into double tipping. If you do opt to go to this bar, read your bill carefully and warn your friends to do the same.",,,
32,Jaime M.,"Huntington, NY",295,1,0,1.0,10/15/2017,"I went here for a friends birthday, as they advertised a $32 open bar deal for two hours (as set up prior by the birthday girl). I bought the band for $32 plus a tip, and ordered my first drink. It was weak and basically a cup of ice, so it was no surprise that I finished it in a minute. I went to get another and the bartender accused me of giving my drink to my friend, and demanded I bring back the empty glass, even after explaining to her that I just drank it quickly and we all had wristbands regardless. A few minutes later, the other bartender served me. BUT THEN, about 30 minutes later, I went back to the bar, empty glass in tow. I stood waiting to be served. It was crowded, but not ""I need to push my way to the bar"" crowded. The original bartender saw me then didn't ask what I wanted and moved on. The second bartender noticed, and told her I was waiting and to get my order. She asked me from across the bar what I wanted, and I had to literally scream my answer (Not in a rude way; in a ""it's a noisy bar"" way), but then served three other parties, checked her phone, and stood there. When the bus boy noticed I was still standing there, he asked her to serve me, and I saw her shake her head and say ""no."" Finally the other bartender came over and asked why I hadn't ordered yet, and I couldn't say anything other than ""she literally ignored me and refused to serve me."" This is UNACCEPTABLE as I was a paying customer! I understand ""not liking me"" as you thought I was breaking the rules, but in a bar my money is just as good as anyone else's and I tipped her throughout the night. Ignoring a customer on ANY grounds is horrible and if it wasn't so crowded I would've gotten her name and contacted management directly, as this is not a way to behave as a bartender. This is a typical college-esque dive bar, and can be a fun time with the right people, but the horrible service and rudeness from that bartender means I'll never be back.",4,,

One person in my party had to leave because it took so long. The food was cold and the proportions were awful. The drinks were inconsistent. This bar does very well so there is no reason for them to be short staffed or have such awful service. You can't really blame the waitress or bartenders for being short staffed, so I think this bar needs to really reconsider what's important because this is not working. It's a shame because this is a great sport bar in terms of coming to watch the game, but a bar needs more than TV's to make customers happy.",,,

I came on a Sunday around 11:15 and it was completely empty so we had our pick of tables. We were seated immediately by a lovely waitress who brought us water and menus. She told us about bottomless brunch- for $12 extra, you can have unlimited bloody Mary's or mimosas for 2 hours- but we opted out. I ordered the veggie eggs Benedict (if you read my reviews a lot, you'll know that this is a favorite of mine), which came with spinach, tomato and feta, and my friend got the Blind Pig breakfast roll. Both were perfectly fine but nothing exciting. My Benedict was actually a bit cold and tasted like salsa, but wasn't horrible. My friend's favorite part of the meal was the potatoes on the side- they were crisp and hot and paired well with the brunch. Another perk: every brunch comes with a free drink, your choice of coffee, tea, a mimosa, etc. This place seems like a great bar to hang out at when the game is on, but it's also a relaxing place to go to for brunch. The menu has the usual stuff, and other eccentricities like chicken and waffles and pulled pork Benedict. Check it out!",1,,

I had to explain to him I was literally on my way. It was an awful first impression, and we got there just to find out it was not even crowded. Then after 2 hours on the dot, we got kicked out of our table because ""another party was coming"", meanwhile again there were other tables open.

We came to watch the Yankees game, an over an hour early, then were told 15 minutes before game time the table was reserved and we had to leave.

We told her we needed a moment,  no sooner than that was said, she disappeared. When we finally decided what we wanted, and after flagging down the server, she comes over and hastily took it. She returned to the table a bit later to ask me what I had ordered.  About 20 minutes later, the food shows up and the food runner comes over and asks us what we had ordered.. (our waitress was having a jolly conversation with her friends at the bar). By this point he and I were out of water. I waited for her to come over, she didn't. She was comparing highlights or something with another girl. So I walk over and say ""sorry to interrupt, but can we get more water"". She eventually brought it over. When it was time for the bill, was then riding the back of another waitress.... this left the worst taste in our mouths.  The restaurant cares nothing about customers and I will never step foot in this joint again.

44,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",135,109,261,2.0,11/3/2015,"I came here on a random Friday night to get some dinner, and I was nervous about going to a sports bar that it would be too drunk/happy hour like. We had called before and they said it was ""not so bad"", so we decided to go. We walked in and unfortunately it was what I expected it to be (loud, drunk people), but they had an open table in the back so we decided to take it anyway. I wasn't really in the mood for anything on their menu, so I just ordered a random burger. I got the pretzel burger which came with honey mustard on a pretzel bun. It was tasty, yet hours later I felt really sick from it. It came with fries so I had a few which were good. My friends shared the lamb burger and nachos. The nachos could've been more melty and gooey, it was hard for things to stay on the chip. The food was average. This is probably a good place to grab a drink and watch a sports game, but the burger made me sick so I probably won't come back for food.",2,,1
45,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,276,32,3.0,9/19/2014,"I've passed this place many times since I live nearby. The atmosphere inside has always seemed cool, albeit typical. Finally got around to trying it out tonight. The inside is spacious, with giant TVs on the walls--I imagine it's perfect for game days (and it seems like fellow Yelpers would agree). The lighting was dim, and the crowd loud, especially because it was 830pm on a Friday night. My boyfriend and I were seated right away--the tables are wooden and bench-style seating flush against the walls, so we could sit perpendicular to one another, which was nice since it would have been hard to hear one another if we had to sit across from each other. We were attended to in good time as soon as we flagged down waitstaff, and they gave us three menus--their drink specials, and a more extensive drink menu, plus the regular food menu. The selection of beers was just right--not so many choices as to be overwhelming, but enough to browse through for a few minutes while choosing our entrees. We both ordered burgers--he got the Pig Burger and I got the Black and Blue. The former comes loaded with meat--chorizo and bacon--and cheddar. The usual fixins' were on the side--onion, lettuce, tomato. But they deliver it to you open so you can easily remove whatever you don't like before you ""assemble"" the burger. Of course, I'm sure you could also request that certain items are left off entirely. The Black and Blue was topped off with Gorgonzola, and the burger blackened on the outside (on purpose--that would be the ""black"" part of the name), but medium rare inside, which was great. The fries we each got on the side were pretty good--didn't get the Old Bay waffle fries but definitely will try it later!",1,1,1

48,Lindsay S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/17/2018,"Came here this afternoon with friends for St Paddys. While waiting at the bar for a drink, I was elbowed in the face by a man; I gave him a dirty look upon which he informed me that he was the son of the owner and I should ""watch myself"". I said ""I don't care who you are, don't touch me"". A female who was with him then got in my face and again reminded me that his father owned the bar and I should ""watch myself"". I can only assume that by ""watching myself"" they were asking me to stop complaining that this random man was elbowing me, but I again said that I didn't care who he was, I wasn't going to allow some man to elbow me out of the bar. The woman then got closer to my face, continuing to warn me to stay out of the way, and I eventually moved to the back of the bar and then left. Before I left, I saw the man who was threatening me high-five the bartender and say ""she didn't know who I was"".  I can't say for sure that this male was, in fact, the son of the owner, but if he was, what I experienced was disgusting and shameful to the entire bar.**to be clear, I was not making any kind of issue at the bar. The only reason I was harassed was because I had the gall to tell the owner's son not to elbow me in the face.",,,

The question that I had going through my head was the significance of the blind pig...didn't see anything with a pig thats blind in the place...Server was very friendly and attentive.The cure - ground sirloin with American cheese and egg. It was like breakfast in a burger. It was a massive unexpected 2 patty burger. The meat was juicy and the burger it self was dripping in oil, but hey that's what makes a good burger, the moister. The taste of the meat however, was a little more bland than how I would have liked, but nothing a little ketchup couldn't do. Don't get me wrong it was still delicious! More than I could handle.Sweat potato fries: to DIE for!! One of the best I've ever had thus far. Buffalo wings - mild.  We weren't sure if we wanted the hot or mild, so we went with the mild. The waiter was nice to suggest that she would bring us extra hot sauce on the side. Sure enough...it wasn't that spicy so I am glad we got that extra dipping sauce.

The table we originally chose was wobbly and loose so we moved to a tight fitting bench in the shade. Shortly after hearing the special, which is bottomless bloody Mary's and mamosas for an extra $12, we both order water and our meals. The waitress was very friendly.I ordered the blind pig breakfast roll and my friend ordered the vegetarian eggs benedict. Our food came after about 10 minutes and was well presented. I wasn't aware of the home fries side that it came with but it was a pleasant and delicious surprise! My roll as descent and consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage; the original dish also comes with grilled tomato and siracha mayo. My sausage was a little charred but still edible and they left a water pitcher for us which was very kind. My friend did not enjoy her eggs benedict too much but had a good cup of tea. Reasonably priced with each entre costing $13 and it comes with ONE complimentary drink of your choice! Again the waitress was so kind and funny!",1,1,1

So if you're not a sport watching individual, avoid this place on game nights because the spectators get a tad too rowdy and combination of alcohol is not the best atmosphere if you are trying to catch up with a friend because you literally wont be able to hear each other. Came here for after work drinks, big mistake was coming here on a night of a Rangers game. But nonetheless we had a good hour to ourselves prior to that and in that time we were able to enjoy burgers, flatbread, and a bowl of Brussel sprouts. Not sure if I was just super hungry but I never had such delicious Brussel sprouts at a bar! They also have a good $5 wine, cocktail happy hour and a little cheaper for beer. Although the noise level is a little above my tolerance, for what it is, still two thumbs up and needless to say, I will be coming back for those Brussel sprouts, on a non-game day of course.",1,,

Updated review","I'm just writing another review because I have been back to this place about 100 times since my first review and my mind hasn't changed.I spend like, 75 hours here during the World series this year and I can't complain one bit. Place was packed but the food, the drinks, and even the service were top notch. And you can't beat their 5-8 happy hour during the week with 5 dollar drinks. Fantastic.The food is excellent and the waitresses/bartenders are so so so sweet and provide better service than any of the fancy or famous restaurants in the city. Best nachos I've ever had. (My go to are the Chili ones but the pulled pork ones are also fantastic). Their truffle fries with the 3 sauces are amazing. Their wings are pretty good, really inconsistent each time i go, but pretty good) and their mozz sticks/pretzel bites/ all bar food is great. Sometimes they have specials for the day and I tried their special Jalapano poppers- they were the best I ever had. So different but so delicious. Go!!!",,,

It's been claimed that this is one of the best places to catch an Arsenal game outside of North London and having been to North London a whopping number of 1 time, I concur. Besides my obvious bias, it's generally a good sports bar. Every possible area on the walls have been used to place a TV or a projection screen so you won't have to worry about not having a good view of your team. The beer choices are fantastic. Recently they have added some new craft beers. The Leinenkenkugels Summer Shandy is a great way to start your day time drinking. yelp.com/user_local_phot…I wish the food was better but unfortunately it's not that great.

80,Michael C.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,6/15/2015,"Please read in its entirety so you don't get scammed:Our group was on the patio area and our server provided adequate service aside from a spilled beer. No one minded as we were having a good time. When our group was done for the night one of our members asked for change for a $100 and received $90 back. This was brought to our server's attention and fixed. This should have been our first warning.Once our group settled up a few members in our group used the facilities. This was when I was approached by the waitress asking if everything was alright since she usually gets tipped more. In years of drinking at countless bars and restaurants this has never happened. My friends and I tip well (and usually in cash which is better for servers...and leaves us no evidence). While I found her directness rude and tacky, I didn't think much of it since I don't know everyone's life and what leads someone to be so bold. I gave her more cash and asked if that was sufficient. She said it was fine and left.Later that evening I found out she approached another member of the group who was leaving the rest room with the same story and took more money! After finding this out and factoring in the ""miscounted"" change, we all felt very taken advantage of. Calling the manager the next day yielded nothing but a polite ""I'll look into it"" My wife loves this place but I will not be coming back. Don't get tricked by this server.

Waitresses and bartenders are pretty friendly and act like they like their jobs, so that's a good sign. You can come here most hours with a big group and still be able to get seated. During football season, you better come here to secure a seat. They do have all the NFL games, so this is definitely a place to hit up if the game you want is not on regional TV.Food here is pretty darn good. The pulled pork nachos are huge and delicious, and the wings, while a bit smaller, are done pretty well. I've also had the burger here, which is pretty standard, but not terribly expensive and the fries are good. Drinks are always pretty good and strong and they have a decent beer selection. And after 11pm, the beers are $4. Some of the Yelpers wrote pretty scathing reviews about the steak here, and I have to say, who the heck orders steak somewhere other than a steakhouse? Rookie move, son.We've been here for trivia night a few times, and while the questions are pretty good and just the right amount of difficulty, the time between rounds is dreadfully long. By the time trivia is over, you feel like you've been at the bar for 4 hours. Oh wait, you actually have been there for 4 hours. Yikes. Oh yeah, and beware the spillover from Beauty bar on weekends.

Their iconography caught our attention, and their happy hour schedule - which runs a bit before lunch to 8 PM (weekdays) - kept us there.This neighborhood spot has flatscreens all over, but avoids being an obnoxious sports bar. Thanks to subtle lighting, their bar's not a bad place to catch an afternoon drink. During our brief interlude, we heard a mix of music, noticing the Stones's ""Beast of Burden"", and later I tapped my foot to Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"".A bartender poured me a shot of straight whiskey ($5) which did the trick. It was a ""farewell for now"" shot, a good way to dull the senses and end an afternoon of unintentional aimlessness.I'll be back to relax sidewalk-side, and to sample their waffle fries.",12,10,13

For $25 you get an entree and unlimited mimosas or bloody Mary's for 2 hours. I really appreciated their champagne to orange juice ratio; it was more like champagne with a splash of orange juice, and our server was always on top of making sure our glasses were full. I had the pigs benedict which was REALLY tasty and the pulled pork instead of ham was a nice twist on the classic dish. Lastly, the thing that set this place apart was the amazing 90s music that played the entire time. One great song after another and at one point the entire restaurant stopped their conversation to sing Aerosmith's ""I don't want to miss a thing"". We had a blast and will definitely be back.",1,,

Well, I should have known that was a bad idea, as the joint was asses to elbows with the collective body heats soaring towards the quadruple figures as hundreds of Bay Area denizens packed themselves into this relatively tiny rathskeller. That said, I had two options: drench myself with sweat that wasn't my own and likely take home various other fluids that didn't previously belong to me, or hop across 14th and catch the game at Blind Pig.I chose the latter.Turns out, this is a pretty legit sports bar, and I wasn't the only one with the same Finnerty's spillover idea -- it was jammed with SF fans, and perhaps 3-5 Packers fans total. Lots of TVs, nice game day drink specials, and enough room to practice my Reverse Warrior while watching them upset the Super Bowl champs, two years removed. Not a bad way to spend the evening.",6,4,7

I had always kind of shyed away from the Blind Pig, because it just doesn't sound like my kind of place. Their logo is a pig with x-ed out eyes, for chrissakes!We got drinks and sat outside, because it was nice enough out and the inside had the Presidential debate booming at a volume I would have winced at if it was music. People were actually just hanging out on the street and listening to the debate. Service was swift and friendly. Waitress was cute as sin. I was pleasantly surprised at the menu, which had a good selection of pub food, including plenty without meat. Classmates got the sliders and raved about them. Boneless chicken wings received a shrug and a nod. I got the nachos and wasn't thrilled... they were not too cheesy, and had a mix of shredded, melty cheese and nacho cheese sauce (like, what you'd get on movie theatre nachos). Most of it was just plain chips. Also, they drizzled the sour cream, rather than having a cup to dip, which kind of grossed me out, because what kind of sour cream drizzles? I still ate them though, because they were salty and involved jalepenos and cheese. Hard to really screw that up. I think next time I'll try the spinach artichoke dip or one of the veggie sandwiches.Four appetizers came to $45. If you're desperately searching for a place to grab a drink and decent food, Blind Pig is hunky dory. Just don't bother with nachos!",4,,1

There was plenty of room when we arrived around 10pm Saturday, so our group of 8-10 was able to grab a table in the back with waitress service. In addition to our drinks and a pitcher of water (+1 for that), they brought us a round of free shots! The shots were some dangerously unburning cinnamon tequila that tasted like drinking Big Red gum. I have no shame in telling you I nursed that shot for a hour just because I knew in younger days I could have had 4 without thinking, and that would have been messy. The music was good and fun even if a touch too loud (hush, I'm old). I can't remember the last time I felt the urge to dance at a bar, but Blind Pig delivered. I left pretty early around 1am so not sure how crazy it gets later on, but it was pretty chill and fun the whole time I was there. Draws a younger crowd of course. Good time!",,,1

111,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",779,342,81,3.0,3/16/2013,"Came here on a Tuesday night for some trivia action. Just to warn people, this is NOT a spot to play if you are just doing it for fun. If you have a competitive team, then this is the spot for you - otherwise, I feel that the atmosphere is very intense. There were roughly 20 teams and all of them were gunning for the big prize.I arrived at 7:45PM and luckily I grabbed the last table near the back. It was already crowded by people prepping for trivia night. By around 8:00 PM all of my teammates and I had arrived and we were ready to begin. BUT, this place has a habit of starting late, around 8:30-45. Trivia should start on time - teams that can't assemble by the starting time should be disadvantaged by missing the opportunity to answer the first few questions just so that it all ends on time. We ended up leaving at around 10:30PM because there was still about half the game left and we were pretty far behind the other teams.My other main qualm with this place is the service. Our waitress was always rushing around and not checking in with us. It was really hard trying to nab her as she ran by us and disappearing into the crowd. There was also this guy cleaning the tables who was pretty rude, as in pushing people out of the way, being very brusque, and overall not having any host-manners. My friend ordered the cheeseburger sliders and, even though it came with three, each piece was so pitifully small that the entire dish looked like a joke.I do like Trivia Tryst, but Blind Pig was just too intense for our level and the service was not nearly good enough to keep us attached. We'll probably stick with going to Bud's Ale House in Astoria.",,,

At the time we walked in, it was relatively uncrowded, but we ultimately ended up waiting over an hour for our food. 40 minute after we ordered, we started to inquire as to what happened and were told it would be just a ""few minutes."" 20 minutes later, we were still waiting and noticed that patrons that had come in after we ordered had received their food--the same dishes we had ordered. We asked to speak to the manager, and he rudely offered us only a 20% discount. As my friends and I were trying to explain that we had been waiting for over hour and needed to leave soon, he told us we we could get a 20% discount, no discount, or no food. When our dishes finally came out, it was clear that the food had just been thrown on the plate. The food was fine, and the waitress was incredibly sweet as she was running around trying to serve everyone. However, the absurdly long wait time and the incredibly rude and unapologetic manager ruined the morning for us.",,,

We ordered drinks; which by the way were awesome. Then my family and I noticed that another table was becoming available that we would be more comfortable sitting at.

You can probably figure this out just looking at the wall of fame right when you enter the place. The bar is decent size but gets pretty packed during the games so you know the drill - come early, get your seat and order your food/drinks and enjoy the game! This is not your classic football/soccer bar mainly because it is a sit down restaurant as well and this definitely reduces the capacity of the place (those Balzac age women did not look like soccer fans!) Btw, try their wings, they are kick ass! I made a mistake of trying some drink call double grape soda (or something like that) which was really a can of grape soda and 2 shots of vodka and was like $16... I should've had 3 beers instead lol We came here once on a non-game day and had a lot of fun: good music, good beer, cool ambiance, good friends - what else you need to enjoy life?",1,,

Waiters/waitresses are just as nice and certainly put up with a lot of bullshit weaving through fans during Arsenal matches.Food is weak. Lamb burger was super dry. Mozzarella sticks were standard. The nachos had some cheese-whiz situation on top of stale chips. The steak in the steak salad was tough and had formed a nice rind from being left sitting out.This was my go-to spot for Arsenal matches. But lately, it's way too crowded (or maybe I'm getting too old). They should limit the amount of people. It'd be great if they could open the patio area up, but I understand the difficulty with the noise and the neighbors. Still, too crowded to be enjoyable for Arsenal matches.All that being said, I don't believe I've ever been here for anything other than an Arsenal match so I can't speak to the bar/restaurant at other times.

118,Andrew S.,"Manhattan, NY",143,90,2,3.0,3/11/2014,"I'm doing my best to not let the outcome of the game affect my review, as the game was truly horrendous. Luckily, my experience at the Blind Pig was solid and it would be hard to change much.On a weekend most of their regular happy hour drink specials that exist mid-week are gone, but that doesn't affect arguably the best deal. For $25, you can pick a bucket of 5 different craft beers from their pretty solid list of bottles and cans. We got a few buckets and in the process experienced a great selection of craft beers from around the country including 21st Amendment, Saranac, and ProhibitionThe only issue we had with the buckets is that each can was open before it arrived, resulting in spillage and beers warming faster than we'd like. Food here is pretty standard bar food and my burger was good. Nothing crazy but good. Others at the table got the nachos and they looked great. Topped with mounds of cheese, meat, and other goodies, I think I made a mistake not ordering them.In terms of game watching, you can't go wrong. There are a few projectors and large TVs, and as long as no giants sit in front of them you should be in for a good experience. I'll definitely be back at some point to try out the craft beers again and catch another game. Here's hoping they rotate the selection.",1,1,1

Anyway, had a good, perfectly cooked burger, served on an oversized english muffin, which is my favorite type of delivery system for a burger. Nice selection of beers on tap, friendly and courteous service, and good views of the game from almost every seat in the place, even though I sat at the bar. Not that it matters, but the other customers seemed to be nice, normal people - not overly ""fratty"" bros chugging beer and being obnoxious - and there were women there also - which makes for a better experience. Overall, a quality sports bar with a better than average spirits selection and better than average pub food with some original twists (Montauk clam chowder - a hybrid of Manhattan and New England) which I will be sure to try next time.",4,2,3
132,Monique S.,"Brooklyn, NY",253,645,682,3.0,5/18/2011,"Went here for the unlimited mimosa and bloody mary brunch.  The room is dark, but the crowd is bright.  A lot of arsenal fans here go to watch the games.  Despite their lost against Aston Villa when I went, the crowd was quite lively for the afternoon, even breaking into song at times.The food is ok. I had an omelet, and my friends had the Irish breakfast.  Nothing to write home about, but nothing bad at all.  The waffle fries are quite delish and noteworthy.The unlimited drinks were hardly drinks. The mimosas tasted like they took a tablespoon of champagne and added a glass of orange juice.  We nicknamed them, ""orange drink.""  I think that pretty much sums it up.My suggestion:  Get the 12.99 regular brunch.  Even that comes with a drink. After that, just buy a drink that's worth your money.",1,1,1

I've never been here outside of a match, so I can't comment to that. But I did enjoy a 64oz mug of Guinness with my buddy at 7:30AM during match day. That was quite enjoyable.

Our waitress came to check on us, oh, NEVER. And she even had the nerve to tell us not to get drinks at the bar, but from her-- well, maybe if you weren't busy standing around the kitchen all night and not doing your actual job, we would!The food was alright, nothing special.

Very laid back, great selection of beer, and in my experience the service is fantastic (it might help that they see me at least once a week). The space itself is simple, with a bunch of tables, stools at the bar, and TVs everywhere. It's a great spot to watch a game. The blind pig is an Arsenal bar if you were wondering. The food is simple, but tasty. You can't go wrong with one of their burgers, and the old bay fries are great (but sometimes I splurge and spend an extra $1 on tots). My friend always gets wings, which gives me food envy so I have to eat at least one. If you're looking for non-greasy or healthy food, may I remind you that this is a bar? And as far as bar food goes, I'll keep eating at the blind pig. I've also been here for their bottomless brunch a couple times. Food was what you'd expect, and they were very quick about getting me my next drink (even if I hadn't finished my current one). Basically, you should go.",,,

But what you will get is decent food and unlimited Mimosas for $25 all in. Cheap, affordable, drunk. I had the omelet and my friend had the vegetarian florentine. Both were excellent choices. Only thing that was a downer was the deviled eggs that I added. I love me some deviled eggs, but their flavored deviled eggs missed the mark.

I had a great experience from start to finish, happy I chose this place.Before: Contacted them via e-mail to set up my party, got a response within 24 hours. The person I spoke with was extremely helpful and catered to my requests. I had a party of 10-20 coming in to watch the Rangers/Devils game and was assured I'd get a high top table and the game playing in my area. Party: I was happy to see that my tables were all ready to go! I had a perfect corner in the back left with two tables and two screens for the game. The server was very friendly and attentive, never waited long for anything and it was a Saturday night. She was also a good sport when some of the group (ended up being 20 people) attempted ordering from the bar other than her, she asked me to have them just go through her but I couldn't control my group.

You know most places there's one great person (lately it's been the waitress) and one incompetent or worse, ASSHOLE. But holy hat-trick batman, EVERYONE at this place was great. The manager, Derrick, did his best to accommodate us, clearing a table for us, frequently checking back to make sure everything was okay, asking if there was anything he could do. (He could NOT make the Yankees win, however. Neither could Alex Rodriguez.) Then there was Nicole, our waitress. Not only as beautiful as a Pacific sunset, but so nice and friendly you wanted to play Monopoly! And the doorman, Jakub. He knows EVERYBODY... and everybody loves him. You'll see seemingly random people walking by, stopping to give him a hug. He's from Nigeria... and is gonna teach me Hausa on my next visit.Inside is a bit noisy, and it may be crowded. At least it was on a Thursday night when the Yankees were playing. OK beer selection. The food is typical bar food, but there are some surprises. The pork nachos were great.

The duck hash was underwhelming. The duck itself was a bit dry and tough and it was served with a ton of large chunky potatoes - not what I think of when I picture a hash. It felt like I was eating mostly potatoes and was picking through, trying to find the duck pieces. The drinks were good - bloody mary was incredibly spicy so I went with the mimosa.

I asked several times later and he refused to give me any reason whatsoever, even though the manager I spoke to (who was a very nice guy) said he had to tell me why. Logic would dictate that if he had a reason he would tell me, the fact that he continued to refuse leads me to conclude that he has no reason, and just decided to single me out personally. I can only guess why. Did he see ID and remember my name? Maybe he doesn't like Jews. It's just a theory, I'm not saying I believe it's true, but if he refuses to give me a reason all I can do is speculate.

179,Sean S.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,40,0,5.0,4/18/2011,"As an Arsenal supporter, I have to say that this place has gone out of its way to make us feel at home. Football supporters can be kind of an odd thing to have around (see Vanessa's review below, apparently we're all lame because we like football), we sing rude songs and drink copious beers at 9 AM on a Saturday or Sunday. That said, the bartenders do a great job of serving us all, even if I'm sure they're not thrilled about waking up early on a weekend to hear us warble off-key about how much we hate Tottenham (and boy, do we hate Tottenham). On top of that, they fly our flags and have hung up some Gooner paraphernalia inside, which is a nice touch.Oh...and the omelet with bacon and cheese is brilliant.",2,4,6
180,Daniel U.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,49,5,5.0,5/27/2013,"This review concerns this place on the occasion of Arsenal games only. I have no real experience of the Blind Pig outside of these games. However, when Arsenal are playing, we the fans are always well treated, and feel very welcome. The brunch menu is very good, particularly the Pigs Benedict of which I am a huge fan. The beer specials in the morning (ssshh!) are very encouraging. The staff have a great memory and I am full of admiration for how they handle such a large crowd on weekend mornings. Please don't take my Blind Pig Away!",3,,1

Kitchen open late and wings were delicious (we went with bad breath [garlic] and teri yaki). The appletini was definitely worth it. My brother was impressed with the beer selection and the ones he ordered. Quick service and the booths easily fit our party of ~12. The DJ kept the mood fun while at a decibel that you could still have a conversation with your friends or sit back and enjoy the music.,,,

184,Alison H.,"Somerset, Somerset, NJ",586,607,1276,3.0,3/17/2013,Hot mess on saint patty's but I think I will most certainly return at another time. The bar itself is huge and there is a ton of other seating. TV's everywhere too...great place to watch a game.,3,1,2
185,Vanni P.,"New York, NY",132,574,2,3.0,1/6/2012,"Pretty fun spot to watch sports, pretty average dive bar for the rest. And I know they're posturing as a speakeasy - that is not the case. Dive. Bar. Once we come to grips with reality, everything flows pretty smoothly: the Blind Pig has all the trappings. Beers galore, big TV screens, lots of space to stand up and shout obscenities at the ref, etc. For some reason, every time I go watch a game here the Giants win (last-minute win over the Pats, Packers upset) so I'll be going back. Everything else can be found in millions of other look-alikes.",,,
186,Aakash P.,"Chicago, IL",6,53,2,4.0,8/26/2014,"I have been to blind pig on numerous occasion. Whether you are going to watch a game or just meet friends for a drink, the bar offers a great selection of beer and drinks. Don't expect service to instant if you come during gameday, the bar definitely gets packed and it is better to get a large table or just order at the bar. The lunch special is great if you are in the area and they also have wifi if you need. By far the best item I have had on the menu is the Blind Pig Nachos -- definitley give them a try!",,,
187,Erin C.,"Waltham, MA",139,531,80,4.0,1/1/2010,Great place to stop in for a drink. I loved the dark atmosphere and laid back feel. Its almost like a fancier dive bar. The bartender was quick to make sure my glass was always half full too which always gets 2 thumbs up from me.,,,
188,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,277,87,3.0,8/16/2013,"A-OK - Sure, that just about sums it up. The food is typical pub fare, service is friendly. Come to think of it, just about all aspects are ""typical pub"" - Trivia night (tuesdays) seems to be quite popular and loud. Not a destination. Just an A-OK kinda place.",1,,
189,Wing L.,"Brooklyn, NY",451,375,2179,3.0,1/21/2011,"**************** This review is only for the food ******************I've been to the Blind Pig twice now.  The first time I was there, I was continuing my mission of trying out as much of the buffalo wings around NYC as I can.  At this place, the choices for the wings sauce are mild, medium, hot, and nuclear.  With my penchant to abuse myself with the hottest wings that every place has on the menu, I of course gravitated to the nuclear.  When the wings came, the first thing I noticed was that they were puny.  Either they got these wings from miniature chickens or those poor chickens have been starved most of their life.  Size aside, I was pleasantly surprised when biting into the nicely crispy fried skin that the nuclear was indeed properly named.  This is no tamed down typical wimpy bar sauce.  My mouth tingled pleasantly from the heat. Not the hottest that I've ever eaten but definitely above average for heat level.The wings being an appetizer, I ordered the sliders as my main meal and found them to be pretty good.  The sliders had a generous portion of beef between each bun and were served medium rare as requested.  It is served with some minced veggies on the side to add to taste.  The burgers comes with waffles fries but for $1 more, I upgraded the fries for the onions rings.  I wished that I didn't.  It was OK at first but towards the end, I was starting to feel as if the rings were too greasy and I just couldn't make myself finish them all. On my second visit, I ordered the nuclear wings again because despite the diminutive size, I really enjoyed them.  I also ordered their ribeye steak as my entree this time. Not sure what happened but when my order of buffalo wings came, it somehow morphed into an order of their boneless buffalo wings.  Since the mistake happened already and I was kind of curious to see how their boneless wings were like anyway, I decided to keep the dish.  My impression?  Not only did they make it boneless.  They made it skinless too. They basically used chunks of chicken breast which have a different texture to wing meat.  One of the best parts of a well made buffalo wing is it's crispy skin and this is missing that.  It's not the same without it. Another problem with the skinless wings are that the size of each ""wing"" varies greatly.  Some are laughably small, comparable to the size of a typical marble while others are about the size of the regular wings (Not that their regular wings are that big). The nuclear sauce was as good as I remembered though.Now about my order of ribeye steak.  I think they must have mistaken my order of that too.  Somehow when I said ribeye steak with portabella merlot reduction , I must have mumbled something like ""half ribeye steak and half fat please"" because that is exactly what I got.    What was edible was good and tender but come on, once I trimmed off the fat, I lost half my steak. No exaggeration.  Looking at the bright side (trying to anyway), the steak came with these huge mutant sliced portabella mushrooms on top.  The steak is served with your typical bland steamed veggies and a choice of  mashed potatoes, rice, waffle fries, or linguine on the side.  I chose the linguine. Nothing special about it.  Cooked linguine in a weak marinara sauce topped with a bit of cheese.  I would never order the steak or the linguine again.Buffalo Wings: 3.5 stars (Would have given it a four but it's just too puny)Onion Rings: 3 starsSliders: 4 starsSkinless Buffalo Wings: 2 starsRibeye Steak with Portabella reduction sauce: 2 starsI was hovering between a 2 or a three but my average came out to be a 3 so 3 it is.P.S.  Sodas are unlimited refills.Heat level of the hottest buffalo wings from a scale of one to five, five being the hottest. 4",13,9,10
190,Henali P.,"Manhattan, NY",153,210,66,4.0,1/18/2012,"I came here on a Sunday evening for the Giants game. Place was packed so get here earlier to save a nice spot to STAND...well if you are lucky, then you will find a spot to sit! TV's everywhere. Loved the music. Crowd was normal and young. Hard to walk around here but they had beer specials which are good enough for a game night :Dbtw Giants won that night.. weeee!",,,
191,Alyvia M.,"New York, NY",483,770,48,2.0,1/22/2009,"""Are you ready for some football???""I know I am when I go to the Blind Pig on a Sunday. They make a great bloody Mary, and have a decent menu for a pub. I'd go with the sliders (yum) wings, or buffalo chicken sand (double yum). (there's something about their buffalo sauce that leaves you wanting more). Sticky table tops from spilled beer, sausage-fest of a meat market (run ladies), and waitresses who really don't love their job are small prices to pay for convenience and football. This place was around for prohibition.I don't expect much from a dive, and this one is better than most in the city. You can see a screen from wherever you're standing inside.Just don't use the bathroom, it looks like it hasn't been serviced since 2001.",2,2,2
192,Patrick C.,"Astoria, NY",20,77,0,3.0,5/20/2013,"I've been coming here for years and yeah it's fine. I've never thought to Yelp this place because for everything that's right or wrong with it, it's all worth it just to come watch the Arsenal games, bottom line. But at long last, it must be said that Blind Pig has the WORST COFFEE I have ever tasted. Ever. It's absolute dirt, and it's extremely worrying that no one has ever caught on to this fact and said, ""Hmm, has anyone ever noticed that we keep ordering this swill and trying to sell it?",1,1,
193,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,3.0,9/24/2009,"I went on a Saturday in the middle of the day. The bar is large, and there's actually a ""beer garden"" in the back (kind of narrow without much of a view). The menu of cocktails is quite extensive, but the beer selection is pretty standard. I had a fine experience here - nothing special, though. On top of that, while our waitress was perfectly nice, she talked with us extensively about how nauseous she was, which, she explained, had nothing to do with food but probably a yoga-dehydration experience. But it was just a little odd. Standard bar fare and a good space for groups.",,,

195,Jae C.,"Manhattan, NY",145,237,2,3.0,4/14/2013,"I can't comment on anything but the weekly Arsenal games. This is probably the bar of choice if you are an Arsenal fan. If not, you will not have fun here. Diehards congregate here for each of the games and given how close the race for 3rd is in the Premier League, the emotions run high with each kick of the ball. It was nearly impossible to find standing space but the bartenders were very good at keeping on top of all the volume. People were ordering various bar fare but with no space to sit or really post up, it wasn't an option. Come on a non-game night for a more sane bar experience.",1,,
196,Lori G.,"Danbury, CT",38,116,164,4.0,1/3/2014,Went here for drinks on the earlier side of the night. The drinks for scrumptious. It was nice and quiet so the place was spacious for us to roam freely. It got crazy later. I could see it being fun for a group of friends to start or end the night.,,,
197,Erik D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,7/27/2014,So I'm still here and guess what? Bad service aka They blindsided you with false info. I'm not tipping. They don't explain brunch unlimited drinks yada yada. Beware of the signs that says otherwise. It's untrue....sadly my friends got suckered with me since we were walking and hungry originally wanted to show them IHOP because of my childhood however they was a long queue. I wish there's no stars but it won't let me process. My friends are from Europe and it's embarassing that this is happening. Been to many places across the world but seriously it's embarrassing that it happened in my own backyard. The people who wrote good things are either friends of someone who works here or from Staten Island. Jus sayin',,,
198,Malorie S.,"New York, NY",16,4,1,4.0,3/22/2011,"With March Madness in full swing, I was looking for a fun bar with decent food and enough tvs to watch multiple games. Enter Blind Pig. The atmosphere was great with an eclectic mix of people. Some obviously there because it's a Saturday night and that's what you do. Others there on date night. And of course the bracket-obsessed basketball fans like me.There were giant screens all around the bar with multiple games on, so I could follow more than one game at a time. The mood was set with some classic 90s tunes that were quickly hushed to turn up the commentators during the last seconds of buzzer-beater games.And to top it all off, the food was better than average bar food. With pizzas, wraps, and soups in addition to the burgers, wings, and fries, the menu had plenty of great options.This is the perfect venue for getting out of the house to watch your favorite sports--definitely a repeat.",1,,1
