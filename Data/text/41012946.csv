They have some of the best Fish 'n' Chips I've had anywhere, fresh made-to-order Sushi every Wednesday and amazing New England style Lobster Rolls every Friday during the Summer. Top notch for a corporate cafeteria!",

2,2,5/2/2007,188,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Victor L.,14,3.0,1057,"Note: this cafe is reserved for Time Warner employees and employees under its conglomerate. It is on the 10th floor of the Time Warner building.First things first, you must purchase a card and put money on it to eat here, or use a credit card or debit card. You cannot use cash here. Moderate to heavily busy, the lunch here is an upscale cafeteria, with the seating comfortable and a terrific, open, full wall window views of Central Park. Its expensive for sure, but they have top notch food usually, theme days, such as sushi, and staples like a deli, salad, salad bar in the middle island, snacks, burgers, steaks, salmon, pasta, and some more traditional American foods. Its not quite as good as The Lodge in the Viacom building (which has a nice outdoor area patio), that place rocks the shiznit, but its solid, the view is great, and its just a wonderful place to eat if you are part of the TW family. The nice part is people watching TW employees, who dress a little more appropriately than I do for work, and how they are different from the office I work in in terms of demeanor and style. Its just nice to see, compare and contrast. You could be sitting next to a president and not know it. I love that about life.Oh and there's hot sauce everywhere. And the grill man is really funny.Beyond that, a lot of stuff and events are held here, I think its an RA run place (Restaurant Associates), which is probably the largest catering company in the city.",2
