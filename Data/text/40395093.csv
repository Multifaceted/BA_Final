0,Lydia W.,"Willingboro, NJ",110,87,75,4.0,8/19/2018,You can legit dance on the bar at your own risk. This is a fun place and the bartender was very interactive and danced on the bar as well. They have a late night happy hour from 2am-4am.I would definitely visit this place again!,,,
1,Daniela E.,"Willingboro, NJ",154,134,458,4.0,8/19/2018,"Okay, so going to Coyote Ugly in NYC and dancing on the bar has been on my bucket list for quite a while! And I am glad to say this has been accomplished! It's just what you expect and nothing more, nothing less. Music is played off of the juke box which is good because you get a selection but bad because people can skip your songs and so on. One of the bartenders were great, serving, dancing and everything (we don't remember her name) while the others were very dry. Like you are a Coyote Ugly! Act like it! Prices for drinks are average at a bar in the city. The security were great, they helped us get up & down from the bar, and helped us with a situation we felt uncomfortable with. Overall, there isn't much to say about it. Not many people were there and it was a Saturday night but still a small amount. We would go again but just know what you're going for and don't expect anything different.",1,4,1
2,Danielle M.,"Queens, NY",322,282,619,5.0,12/30/2017,"I don't know why this place has only 2 and a half stars overall rating- cuz I had a blast when I went! I had attended a friends show at the theater next door and I've never been here and just had to stop into the famous ""Coyote Ugly."" See, I'm a big movie buff- and naturally I saw the movie and always wanted to see if the place was anything like it. They don't spray water on you if you ask for it lol- but they definitely know how to have a good time and liven things up! I like the fact that they have a jukebox and you can play whatever you like- as long as it's something you can dance to of course! The bartenders were great! We were served by ""Misha"", and she was just awesome! It wasn't too crowded when we got there because it was still kinda early for a Saturday night- but the bouncer did say it starts to get crowded about midnight. The drinks were nice and strong so you get what you pay for. We hung out there for about two hours- and before I left, I naturally had to get up on the bar and dance one song haha! Was so much fun! The crowd was great too! Everyone dancing and having a good time. Just what I like to see at a Manhattan spot! I highly recommend this place- whether you're just visiting NYC or you actually live in NYC! I have to go back again!",5,4,6
3,Jamal C.,"Whittier, CA",6,6,3,5.0,10/28/2018,mesha is the best bartender!!! This bar is super fun! Me and my friends from LA came to NY and so glad we found this place because it's the best,,,
4,Erica N.,"Whittier, CA",73,2,0,5.0,10/28/2018,mesha was the best bartender ever! She made my birthday so special and was so fun and friendly. 10/10 would definitely come again,,,
5,Eileen T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,1,2,3.0,8/19/2018,Dancing on top of a bar is now crossed off my bucket list! The bartender was full of energy and had an ugly personality  It was a little empty but still lot's of fun. I'd go back.,,1,
6,Alexis T.,"New York, NY",131,67,140,5.0,7/31/2018,"I don't know why this place has two stars, but y'all are crazy. This weekend I went out with my sorority sisters and friends celebrating her birthday and this was our second and last stop. First, let me just say this place is amazing. When we first came in, it wasn't crowded because the night was still young but everyone was lively and having a good time. Walking into this bar felt as if I was watching this movie up close and personal (if you don't know what i'm talking about, first i'm going to pray for you. Secondly, google coyote ugly movie). My friends and I grabbed a booth and ordered our drinks. I told the girls at the bar that it was my sorority sister's birthday and they gave her a free drink and shot. Music was awesome and the bartenders were sweet and knew how to have fun.  Once they noticed my friends and I dancing in the booths, one girl ( i forgot her name but I know she's Jamaican) she threw ice at us and we got up on the bar and danced with them. Everyone from the many 21st birthdays to the bridal party that stopped by was having a good time. I was singing and dancing with girls from Australia like i knew them all my life. This bar is fun, the bartenders know how to put on a good show, and they have no problem letting you know when you're out of line. I will definitely be going back. Seriously, if you're looking for a good time around St. Marks, this place will not disappoint.",,,

8,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11026,2.0,4/3/2017,"As someone who constantly goes to bars and restaurants ironically, it takes a lot for me to recommend steering clear of a place entirely.In hindsight, it was probably a bad idea to go to Coyote Ugly on a weekend while the sun was still out.As soon as we walked up, a drunk group of college kids swung there for open as they were leaving and the douche leaking out of the place was palpable.And by douche, I mean really, really loud shitty country music and an air of venereal disease.Once inside, we were immediately carded, and then the bartender atop the bar started pressuring us into order drinks and doing body shots off of her. I barely wanted to sit on a stool there, so that was a hard pass.Maybe I'm just becoming an old man, but the music was so goddamn loud we had to yell at each other. But hey, at least we weren't old fat dudes hootin' and hollering at any girl who dared dance even a little bit.",4,8,2

11,Bob T.,"New York, NY",66,18,1,2.0,8/31/2018,"So all of a sudden, the Coyote Ugly chain has eliminated the 2 for 1 Happy Hour which has been in place since it's inception! That is going to hurt business. Most all of the bars on the Lower East Side have a Happy Hour. This will backfire on them. And since Happy Hour is eliminated, they should at least give a buyback to regulars after two or 3 drinks.",3,,
12,William Y.,"Queens, NY",0,8,0,1.0,8/25/2018,"This place went downhill. A few years ago I use to come here every now and then, low key, girls dancing on the bar. However when I came in there were almost all guys, we walked to the back and was trying to decide if we going to stay. Not even a 10 seconds has gone by the bartender yells loud enough and everyone is staring at us where she says are you guys getting a drink, if not get out of here. I kept saying let me talk to my friends first, she waited a few seconds and then kept yelling loudly for us to order or get out. The girls are decent at best, bartenders are assholes fuck this place there is better places to check out",1,1,
13,Sandra H.,"New York, NY",3,24,3,1.0,10/8/2017,Ufff even though this place is an institution in new york (yeah thanks to that shitty movie) i really don t get it!In the beginning it is supposed to be some feminist act to not allow male going on the bar but this place turned to the opposite of feminism! Female bartender are shaking their booty and belt wiping people for money.i found this shit show really degrading.Plus the music was awful (bad Jersey frat house style party seriously)Def won t go back!,2,5,1
14,Catherine I.,"East Brunswick, NJ",134,14,8,4.0,3/2/2018,"Pretty cool place, definitely entertaining. Drink prices are reasonable but I felt like they should have been a little stronger.

15,Erin P.,"Brooklyn, NY",335,287,1018,1.0,4/2/2017,"I can honestly say that I never wanted to enter this place but on a cloudy Saturday afternoon, I crossed the threshold (thankfully just as a large group of loud college aged ladies exited). Our IDs were immediately checked by the bouncer/bar back/jack of all trades while a woman wearing very little clothing danced on the bar. We asked what their beer and shot special was (PBR and shot for 10$) then asked how much just the PBR was (3$). The lady was like YOU'RE IN NYC LIVE A LITTLE! but we had been living a little in other much cheaper dive bars on the block that had the same special for 7-8$. Once we received our beers we quickly started to drink them because the incredibly loud country music was starting to wear on us. The general ambiance is a dive bar that is just trying too hard. Bras were hanging around the ceiling, stickers adorned the walls. The crowd was awkward middle aged men or a few out of town couples. Once younger lady started to dance so the man swooped her up on the bar to dance with the scantily clad hostess which seemed to annoy one man sitting at the bar while simultaneously egging on another who began to yell for her to keep dancing. Overall I felt rather embarrassed to be in there while the sun was still up. This might be entirely my (or to be more exact, MIKE AND CHUCK'S) fault. Its not like the music was to my liking or the crowd was bumping. I will have to give it to them that the PBR was cheap enough. Although if you look at the specials it said a 16oz was 3$, not the 12 that we got, but now I am just being nitpicky. I strongly suggest for a truer dive bar experience go to coal or international down the block. But if you are looking for ladies dancing on a bar with cheap drinks go here--- Oh wait no.. I suggest Iron Horse Instead, Plus they have a swing and the sliders on sunday are 1$.",3,3,3
16,JJ F.,"Las Vegas, NV",142,2,0,1.0,10/31/2017,The beers tasted funky like they went bad. I tried a few beers and they all had the same nasty taste. The bartenders didn't care. Worst bar in the village.,,1,
17,Jesse R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",117,464,19,2.0,1/8/2016,"The vibe was WAY weird here on a recent Thursday night. There was like a bike messenger meet-up or something that had about 10 bike messengers eating an Italian feast with their bags sprawled out everywhere. It looked like a campground. Meanwhile, a mentally disturbed man was laying on the floor repeatedly taking his shirt on and off.Usually, between the dancers and the clientele this bar is just sloppy fun, but this time around it was just very, very weird - and not really in a New York fun weird - it was just uncomfortable.$3 PBR tall boys, though.",5,8,3
18,Will I.,"Yonkers, NY",1,29,25,4.0,9/14/2016,Perhaps the best bar in NYC. There is never a dull moment with the fun bartenders and ladies. They have a good selection on the shelf and a jukebox box which plays the best pop hits or classics.The only gripes I have are about the pricing and pushiness to have a drink. There have been moments when I get a drink and 5mins later asked if I want another one. The shots are pretty pricey for a dive bar. If they dropped the drink prices and let people relax they retain more customers.,,,
19,Kate S.,"New York, NY",580,277,370,1.0,1/11/2016,"If a sleazy bar is what you're lookin for, then this is the place for you! I honestly had a hard time even staying for 10 minutes. Not only did the vibe scream ""trashy dive bar that attracts lonely 30 year old men,"" but it was also just scummy. I also do not want to see this place at midnight where everyone is well hammered. That's just a very scary thought.Maybe if I were a 30 year old lonely male who enjoyed bartenders dancing on the bar with half their clothes on, then I just maybe would like this place.",3,1,3

The doorman took her ID and went, ""You're under 21. You were born in 96,"" when her license clearly states she was born in 95. Now, a doorman from another bar earlier in the evening did point out that at a first glance, someone could make that mistake, but he could read it, as could the four OTHER doormen checking her ID could. We tried to make him inspect it closer and show him the difference between the 5 and 6 in the print (and, really, do people with fake IDs have the guts to argue back?), but he refused. Not wanting to waste any more time, we went around the corner to Pinks and spent the rest of the night enjoying the awesome service there.",4,3,

Updated review","This bar has finally hit rock bottom and I will no longer go here on the weekends as long as that rude, nasty bouncer/doorman named Kevin is working. He has a serious problem with people playing rock or country on the jukebox and even stops you from going to the jukebox if he thinks you are going to play that kind of music. He even plays the jukebox himself, while leaving the door unguarded at times. One time he told my friend that he better contain his girlfriend from dancing on the bar (for no reason), and it wasn't even his girlfriend. Other patrons have told me they overheard him saying racist things about white people. He is also known for kicking guys out of the bar just because they are talking to a girl. Kevin gets jealous it seems and spends more time flirting with the female patrons and messing with the jukebox than doing his job! Most regulars have also stopped coming to Coyote on the weekends because they cannot stand Kevin, the doorman. The owners and managers need to realize that HE is the reason why their numbers are so low on the weekends. I even noticed others complained about him in previous reviews on here.",2,1,
22,Lisa A.,"Milwaukee, WI",254,635,1084,4.0,5/8/2014,"So this place is not what it looks like in the movie. If you get past that part you'll find a slightly gritty but friendly dive-ish rock n roll bar - almost like your corner neighborhood bar, if your neighborhood pub had you move your drinks every 5 minutes or so and people (some misguided among them) climbed up and started dancing on the bar. You might almost miss this place if you're walking down first avenue.   Look for the red and blue (I think?) lettering and you're there.There's a happy hour special that's supposed to be good but we kind of came at an odd time (Sunday funday).  There's a wall of bras some ladies decided to part company with at some point during their time here. You can also buy merchandise including some boy shorts that say coyote ugly on the front and money maker on the back. I can neither confirm nor deny that I now own a pair of these.",2,7,2

How rude. Your job is to be a bouncer- not tell us how not good looking we are. We would've stayed and bought more drinks, but we want to go out and have fun, not get downgraded or unnecessarily harassed by an employee.",2,8,1
24,Thalie L.,"Queens, NY",90,302,312,4.0,5/9/2016,"I read some reviews before i wrote mine and i can understand the customers on some points (too many guys, disgusting bathroom, old dusty bras, not like in the movie etc...). However, my experience was pretty fun last saturday. I had dinner in the Lower East Side at Jadis and we were looking for a cool place to dance. I am really bad in finding a place/club where I like the music. Me and my friends went first to a bar called i believe BAR and it was just ok. We were a little bit disappointed and about to go home when i remember that we were not to far from the place i got my first tattoo earlier this week and coyote ugly was next door. I offered to my friends to just try the bar for 10 minutes. And we finally stay for 2 hours. Yes it is a disgusting dive bar with mostly weird men in their 30s. BUT it is fun! the music is the hits from the radio, the security guards were pretty cool, the coyotes were nice with our group and fun to watch. I am not sure it's an easy job but they were doing it great! We will come back!",4,3,3
25,Marvin P.,"Queens, Queens, NY",77,31,11,3.0,7/6/2017,"The girls here are chill & not too pushy to buy drinks. My favorite bartender was a Caucasian girl with short black hair, beautiful body. I WILL say this though, they'll throw you OUT if you TOUCH them while dancing.",,,

27,Jude J.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",1248,113,198,2.0,2/26/2015,"Teleportation exists! It feels like this bar came from some ole' highway drinking stop for bikers, not a bar located in the center of NYC.You might find a bunch of new age college kids in here but the location has a old age feeling that someone at one point had sniffed crack off it's tables. It's not too classy, the bathrooms look like that's where rolling stones go for a ""quickie"". The badass rocker feeling is pretty cool but that's not an excuse for a trashy bar, there's only two things here that would make you enjoy your night; the new jukebox (most bars have them anyways) and some pretty cool bartenders. There's also a random strip pole near the ""open area"" (I don't want to say dance floor) and I was scared to touch it. Don't forget to take a knock out before you leave, on the punching machine in the back to test your strength verse your friends. Aim for a million, sorry it doesn't go that high but we could only dream.The bartenders are quick to serve you a drink just as quickly as they are able to convince other girls to get on the bar table and dance. If you go up two or three times they will even give you a cool Coyote Ugly shirt to take home, which you might lose on the way or forget where you got it from. Don't worry, it's all fair out here because the bartending girls are willing to show you some moves once they step up there. Ladies make sure your friends are with you because it is not easy getting down from there.It's a great place to see your friends act stupid, especially if they are drunk girls. It's an even better place to stop by for just a half an hour (make sure it's no more than that, count those 30 minutes to the last), it will get your blood pumping to go out to a spot where you can do some real partying for the rest of the night.",36,31,33
28,Karla A.,"Bronx, NY",343,121,136,2.0,7/5/2015,"ULTIMATE dive bar.Bras hanging on the walls, country music is playing, older men and girls dancing on the bar. Looks like some interesting things go on in here!There are poles around the whole bar with small circular surfaces to put your drinks on..kinda disgusted I touched one of those poles, lol.They have a really cool jukebox though.

29,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,3.0,9/20/2015,"Coyote Ugly is probably a place that's only fun if you're drunk. Where else can you dance on top of the bar and have the (liquid) courage to do so? (and yes, my friends and I did get a chance to do that!)I've always wondered about this place ever since seeing the movie and I finally paid it a visit on a Friday night. It was pretty empty between the hours of 10 pm and 12 am. There's an interesting mix of clientele, ranging from 40-year-old women having their (probably) once a year Girls' Night Out, to toothless, drunk truck-driver-looking folk.They have a jukebox (that you have to pay to change the song) with a sign that says it's strictly a country/rock and roll bar - but I heard a few Top 40 hits that were snuck in there.For a dive bar, the drinks aren't really that cheap. A shot of Jameson is around $8. I guess it's more about the experience than anything else. I probably wouldn't come back unless I was bringing someone who hasn't been to Coyote Ugly before, but I'm glad that I can now cross this off my bucket list!",,1,

33,Chau P.,"Washington, DC",280,152,281,2.0,9/21/2014,"7:30 p.m. Saturday - 3 People1. Ambiance: Dark and dingy. I don't know what to say about this place besides that it needs major renovation. It's so run down. I'm curious as to how this place continues to stay afloat. 2. Cleanliness: It doesn't look very clean. If you drop food on the floor, I don't think enough penicillin will kill all the bad bacterias for you to be able to apply the five second rule. Not that I apply the five second rule at these locations anyhow, but I'm just throwing it out there that it's quite ghastly. :)3. Service: On the bar, there was one dancer performing when we stopped by. I think we walked in at the wrong time. While the dancer was performing on the bar, she held up a belt, bent over one of the customers and started spanking him really hard. Perhaps 5-6 times. I mean, my mom didn't even spank me that hard as a child. My sister saw that and I think it scared her because she was probably thinking, ""Is that what they do here? Today is my birthday and I am not going to be spanked like that."" 4. Costs: The drinks are cheap but we didn't try it. They were having some sort of drink specials. I was too distracted to look at the price. 5. Overall experience: The bar looked a little degraded. Perhaps a little remodeling would lift the face of the place so it doesn't look so used and abused.

34,Louis L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,6,0,5.0,10/10/2015,"10 year bartending vet here. I've seen every type of place, or at least I thought I had until I stepped foot into Coyote Ugly. Not sure how I've managed to live in the city my whole life and not stop in here until a few weeks ago after work, but i'm thoroughly glad that I did. Keep in mind, this review is for a Monday night. Can only imagine how it is on other nights.Dancing on the bar aside (I'm a taken man and as such am not allow to enjoy such things) the bartenders and bouncer were some of the nicest industry people I've had the chance to meet. ALSO, buy one get one late night happy hour on EVERYTHING. Can't really beat that, my friends. Fuck these haters on her and trust a professional. Coyote Ugly is solid as it gets, unless of course, you're a yuppie that doesn't know how to have a good time. If that's the case, go up to Mercury Bar in Midtown and meet a nice stock broker with a big wallet and a small dick instead. If you like fun and being around other people having fun, this is your spot. Oh also, I think there were some cute girls dancing on the bar or something. I dunno.",2,9,

They were on top of their game, making sure everyone was being taken care of even if they were getting orders barked at them.Though, the room was insanely packed. Very packed. I almost was waiting for the fire dept to come and say there were too many people in the bar. The place was definitely filled with way more guys than girls. My friends had fun dancing on the bar (I opted out as I was wearing a dress and wasn't in the mood for anyone looking up my skirt ... at least that's what I remember unless I was that drunk that I forgot already ... now I really hope I hadn't danced on that bar haha). My one friend even added her bra to the collection.We all had fun and the drinks were flowing. I don't remember the cost as I think a lot of the male patrons offered us free drinks (thanks guys!).

They also write on men with sharpies (toxic chemicals), rip clothing of customers, and lick inside strangers belly buttons (extremely disgusting). Definitely do not come here if you want good drinks. If you like shots, and commercial beer this is the place to come and watch a couple of women dancing on a bar (usually not the most attractive may I add). Definitely an experience.",5,6,

I was even beginning to wonder why the place wasn't more packed - it's not as if there is a shortage of voyeurs in this city. I got my answer pretty quickly. One of the bartenders took the nozzle for the soda and sprayed all the people behind the bar with it. Was this supposed to be funny? I must have left my sense of humor at home cuz I wasn't laughing.

From the bathrooms to the floors, I was repulsed. Drinks aren't even that cheap for a hole in the wall. A bit too trashy, and definitely not my scene.

As my cab pulled up and me and my friends got out, we already had this uneasy feeling about going in. Yeah, I was definitely being a good friend. As we walked in, we were half expecting it to be like the movie... you know, full of sexy, lots of dancing on bar tops and it also being a nice clean bar... yeahhhh NO. Get that idea out of your mind because what it looks like inside is a dirty card board box with scribbles all over the walls. Such a mess in here. The bathroom, like other reviews indicate seems like you will catch some sort of infection just walking by. I mean I'm down for a good time at a low key bar as much as anyone else, because dive bars are where you can just drink and chill out... but yea let's just agree that I couldn't stay there for longer than necessary. After I bought a round of birthday shots (which were quite pricey so just stick to beer), I got OUT of there ASAP and went somewhere else to drink those images out of my mind and hopefully sterilize myself. Once I got home, I showered.",4,6,1

I guess what it comes down to is for it being THE Coyote Ugly Bar of folk lore where it's suppose to be the alternative bar of Manhattan filled with crazy dancing girls and back to back shots...it came off more as a dying relic of the 90's. I mean yeah it looks like a solid bar but is that really enough anymore?? Bars are now doing some amazing things and updating their drink specials and there menus and it just seemed this bar wasn't there. I understand the bar dancers are cute but you can find that in tons of other bars across the city that have great turn outs and dance floors!

I was having drink on my way home after work and was verbally harassed by the guy I turned down and his morbidly obese & balding woman friend a few seats down from me... I had a long and stressful day at work, was just relaxing and answering emails so the drama was annoying. Bartender listened in and did nothing. Doorman was friendly; that was the only plus.

The only time I'm here is for a birthday celebration, usually a friend's 21st. There are certain things, such as body shots and dancing on the bar, that only Coyote has that most bars wouldn't dare dream to do. The body shots are.....how should I say......complete?  Step One, bartender strips your upper body. Step Two, bartender writes on your exposed body with permanent market, usually calling you a bitch or a sucker. Step Three, bartender pours two shots of tequila into her belly button, which you slurp out. Final Step, bartender takes your own belt and whips your ass however many times you want.

Let me just say that if I chose to drink from one of their glasses (and I mean IF), I was afraid I may have potentially caught something that I probably, no definitely, would have regretted later.Easy choice was to make a 180 and run, not walk, out the door.

The bathrooms will give you an STD just walking into them. I honestly think they clean the bathrooms with a bucket of warm urine and a sponge.Two shots of Jamesons for $16 and a cheap PBR for $2 - meh. Beer list pretty much sucks. Bartenders are dressed in tight skin revealing outfits, which is not so good when they have blubber and cellulite boucing all around. Yeah, we walked in and saw the girls dancing on the bar just like in the Coyote Ugly movie, but the problem is none of them vaguely approached the level of hotness the movie portrayed. You won't find Maria Bello or Piper Pirabo here!The crowd was your basic nerd boy, trailer trashy, and frat boy types. This type of place is amazing to them.

Updated review","Still RUDE!This happened early (between 7-8pm) on a Monday night not too long ago. Me and my friend enter the venue and approach the bar. It's Monday, so its dead. My friend is a regular and she starts to talk to bartender and order.  All of a sudden some random dude approaches me and demands to see ID from me and my friend. He only addresses me because my friend is busy ordering. At that moment, I was surprised and shocked and scared. Sure this dude is white and wearing a button-down shirt, but who is he to randomly walk up to me and demand to see my ID? He didn't immediately identify himself as an employee or a security guard. I tell my friend this random dude is demanding ID. Then he says he security. He lets it go when he realizes my friend is regular.Like I said, you can't come up to young women and and not identify yourself as security and then demand to see these young women's IDs. That is a sure way to start a fight. If you're a good security guard, you identify yourself. If you're a good security guard, you post yourself at the door and not linger in the back of the venue.

Hot bartenders dancing on the bar, yes. Mixture of classic rock, country & new shit, alright. Bartenders yelling into a microphone shitting on people who aren't drinking...no. Bartenders offering to make ""really yummy shots"" and they turn out to be $10 a pop, no. (They were Svedka.) For such a divey establishment, they should have cheaper shots... especially if they're constantly hounding girls to get on the bar. Which I did, by the way, because why the hell not?! And it was fun too. (Yes.)There was another thing that didn't send me. The bartenders would get a guy to volunteer to take a body shot off one of the bartenders - then the girl would rip his shirt off, write degrading things on him in sharpie, have him take the shot, and then whip him with a belt - and not lightly. (Is that even legal?!) I'm all for women who take charge and feminism and whatnot, but whipping a dude while yelling degrading shit into a microphone?

It looks like all of the staff is different, the girls are...meh, and tit's not as welcoming as it once was. And if they see you with out a drink, they immediately try and kick you out! I'm no lightweight but I prefer not to get alcohol poisoning downing beer after beer after beer in rapid succession.

It was written up by one of the bartenders way back when and we all know about the movie that followed... I will say this, for as cheesy and commercial as it might have gotten after its height of fame.... it still is a plain, dirty, fun time. This is what you need to do. Come here with a group of girls. Get a good buzz before you go. Get a round of drinks and get up on the bar to dance (or just do a little two-step ass shaking).

Girls dancing on the ledge have the tendency of exciting everybody, especially drunk girls. When my friend who was extremely wasted wouldn't let us stop her from dancing on the ledge, I'm glad the bouncers were nice enough to ask her to come down instead of dragging her away from the ledge.

I think you need to go with a big or crazy group or on the right night.,1,,

The low key, chill atmosphere with the relatively cheap drinks. It's awesome. Prior to coming here I was at Doc Hollidays - another personal favorite bar. To be honest I think it's great! Also it's a bit refreshing since there are so many tourists there everyone is pretty chill and looking to meet people. I got a Ton of free shots. Thanks guys!! I'll be back Coyote Ugly - you're a new personal favorite local dive bar. Enjoy!",1,,

It's really clean.""-The guy at This Little PiggyI could not help, but burst out laughing because the bathroom at the Coyote Ugly is probably infested with the Black Plague and is no cleaner than an outdoor latrine, that's flooded with a solid two inches of who knows what liquid.Don't expect a crazy scene like the movie Coyote Ugly, because it really has nothing to do with that. Despite the bathroom, $3 PBRs and attractive fun bartenders that periodically dance on the bar make up for it. I feel in love with one that looked like a half Asian mix. Hopefully I will one day see this gorgeous creature again, but a piece of my heart will always be left in Coyote Ugly.",,4,

Updated review",So apparently the bar was re done.    Gone are the smells of piss and lost dreams (good).  But also are a lot of the townsfolk (bad).  Came here on a Saturday.     (Maybe cause it was a saturday). Nothing but bridge and tunnel and tourists.  If it's packed.   Wait 30 min. It empties.   The. Refills again.   Kinda weird how it works.   Overall great place to yell and scream and have a good time.  The bouncers are actually nice and douches like most are.,,,

92,Rionna D.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,10/11/2014,"Hands down, the worst experience I've ever had. It was my roommates friends birthday so we decided to stop in for a drink or 2. I buy everyone a round of shots, and a beer for myself. The bartender, Kay, asks me if I would like to close out or leave it open, so I just tell her to close out. Well, my bank put a hold on my card, so when she ran it, it got declined. So she comes up to me, tells me it's declined... in which I tell her I'll give my bank a call, because I just checked my account, and I definitely had the money to cover the bill. Kay  then proceeds to go to a guy sitting a few seats down from me pointing at me, and rolling her eyes, telling him about how my card got declined, which is the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. I myself am I server and this stuff happens ALL THE TIME. It is not a big deal, and it is definitely not a topic that is acceptable to be going around and telling other bar guests about. So I finally get a hold of my bank, and tell them the situation. I clear everything up, come back to the bar, and let her know she can run it again and it would go through. She runs it, gives me the slip to sign... I have the pen and the receipt in my hand about to sign it, but end up saying something really quick to my roommate... and I kid you not this bartender screams, ""CAN YOU FUCKING SIGN THE RECEIPT ALREADY? I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH YOUR BULLSHIT FOR 35 MINS... JUST SIGN THE FUCKING THING."" ....I'm sorry but there was literally NO need to talk to me like that. Everyone around me saw it and were so taken back by how she treated me because we have never been somewhere where it okay to treat your guests like that. So in the end, I obviously didn't tip her because after treating me the way she did with telling my business to other bar guests, and then screaming and cursing in my face, I decided there was no need to. And I'll say it again, I've been a server for years so I have never not tipped someone even if the service was terrible. I saved a copy of my bill which came out to be $47, and I check my bank statement this morning and she tipped herself $6 without my permission.So if you want to get treated like absolute shit and have money stolen from you, I recommend this place! Oh, and ask for Kay, because all the other bartenders were really sweet.",1,1,

The crowd is not an unusual mix for the LES. Aside from a few creeps at the front of the bar, it's an average and unexceptional group of people. Yes, the bartenders are salty and try to scam you into buying them drinks. That said, they're all marginally attractive, and occasionally there's a standout. Even the music is a nice break from the other bars in the area that try really hard to be hip. You can't help but queue Crüe on the jukebox. It's a fun, trashy place to drink.

A buddy of mine took me here for the first time last weekend. He's local, I'm a recent addition. The first thing I saw when I walked in the door was the bartender in a short plaid skirt standing above a shirtless guy bent over the bar getting whipped by her with a cat-o-nine tails. She put her skirt over his head and rubbed her ass and crotch in his face then tied a leather belt around his neck for female patrons in the bar to drag him around like a dog. When he returned to the bar, she bent him over backwards, stood on his collar bones (Yeah, actually), poured a shot into her mouth then spat it into his. I watched this entire display of debauchery while enjoying a $2 can of PBR. PBR doesn't do it for ya? Grab a $2 Rolling Rock instead. The decor in this pit is disgusting. The walls are lined with pictures of former patrons being abused by bartenders and topless girls, whose old bras have been nailed to the ceiling, walls, and every other available space. It has an Ora of being held together with decaying wood and sweat, not to mention a few other bodily fluids. The bartenders are sexy, but in a trashy way, like everything else in this cesspool. Looking for a real treat? check out the washroom. There's a bare toilet in the far corner, with paper suspended by a rusty piece of wire, and no stall for privacy. Two urinals that are constantly full of bright yellow piss and globs of beer tainted vomit dispersed with a Jackson Pollack casualness.

One watered down jameson and she has been throwing up all morning.

Also, the manager chick showed up and it is clear she is a royal bitch. she said nothing to the customers but she kept snapping at the poor bartenders who are already trying to hustle the 6 other patrons for $20 body shots of well whiskey (bleh) in their underwear no less.  I even heard one of the bartenders say 'yes ma'am' quietly when the mgr snapped at her, so we left.

I've been to this bar once, and I don't think I'm being hasty in declaring that I'll never, ever return in the course of my life-time, barring some unforeseen, lethal thunderstorm that compels me to take refuge in the closest, skeeviest bar on the Lower East Side. I suppose I should begin by exploring my first impressions of the bar, which were not favorable. I arrived sometime after midnight and joined the company of twelve other men, all of whom seemed to be extremely lonely and depressed. They gazed into their half-empty glasses of alcohol in search of something-most likely a reason to continue living. I can't adequately describe the atmosphere, except to say that it was reminiscent of a scene you would read in a Eugene O'Neill play, only not quite as cheery. Execrable '80s ballads blaring from the jukebox, female bartenders expectorating gin into your mouth, which-if you have rather pedestrian fetishes, as I do, isn't a very arousing experience-possibly being solicited by  local drug dealers, and being charged a princely sum in order to enjoy the experience. The only thing I can say in its favor is that Coyote Ugly probably has some of the most demure, polite bathroom graffiti that I've ever encountered.",5,7,3

I felt like I was back in rural Indiana without the classy midwestern grace.Speaking of midwestern grace, the main reason I had a disgusting time here was that I was definitely gay bashed by two overweight, bemulleted, 40-something women from one of those states where people find that kind of stuff funny.  I think it had something to do with how I'd enjoy getting sexually abused in prison.  That was IT!I walked out and waited for my friend at the entrance, watching people smelling of PBR and Aqua Velva stumble in and out the door and speak lewdly about passing women.  One guy fell flat on his face.  I couldn't tell if they were victims of alcohol consumption or testosterone poisoning, but I guarantee that no amount of Axe body spray will help me fit in with this crowd.",15,31,10

Honestly I hadn't been here in like 3 years and I realized last night that there really aren't that many reasons for me to come here anymore.

It's obviously been a while since I've paid for drinks in a bar so maybe I'm not the best gauge for these sort of things but that does seem kind of pricey for the place I was in. I also could have done without getting the beer splashed on me like I was in some rap video. I guess the girls dancing on the bar was pretty clutch, really it's saving grace for the night.

We ordered two vodka sodas and a vodka tonic. Our model wannabe bartender returned with our drinks. I asked if she had any limes and she snapped ""no"" as if I were some dive bar neophyte who didn't know the sleazy ethic at work here. What proceeded was beyond words. As it turns out all three of our drinks were Vodka tonics. We got her attention and told her. With arch eyebrows and full of attitude she began questioning our claim as if we were conspiring to pull one on her, with comments in bimbo speak ""uhmm, that's really funny because you said two vodka tonics and one vodka soda."" We answered that all three were vodka tonics and we only ordered one. That she noticed my wife had a straw in her drink which she put in one drink to denote the vodka tonic. We explained that we shared the stirrer because she only gave us one between the three of us.  She insisted they can't all be vodka tonics and we were wrong. I told her to try the drinks and see for herself. She did, issued no apologies and then proceeded to make us the weakest round of 24.00 well drinks this side of the East River. Then within five minutes before my friend barely made a dent in his drink, her partner grabbed his drink, dumped and washed it, as if he were done, not even asking. At this point, tired of the complete ineptitude and rudeness of this bar, we left. I took what was a good tip (my wife and I have both been bartenders at bars in NYC where you actually had to know what you're doing), off the counter and stuffed it back in my pocket. Our bartender was in shock. It amazes me that three polite well paying customers who tip well, were treated with such contempt, while we left her with a sad crowd of threadbare desperate full time boozers who order cheap beer and tip accordingly. She had the attitude that give NYC a bad name, and I can bet any amount of money she hasn't been in the city more than year or two. Real NY'ers tend to be alot friendlier and know charm gets a better tip than wanton bitchiness. Why this place is still in business is beyond me. There are countless dive bars throughout the East Village, and this one is poorly run, overpriced and its bartenders are unnecessarily rude. If it's hot babes you want serving you, then go to coffee shop, at least they receive some modicum of training, drinks cost less, and we won't feel like you're hanging out with losers. Our server at Coyote Ugly  watches too many movies. May it fall into the sinkhole of oblivion.",,1,1

The jukebox is kind of cheesy but has some good country and Guns 'n Roses type stuff, but let's face it, who goes there for the music?I like this place, and I wish they hadn't made that dumb movie about it, which was a lot more like Red Rocks.

162,Ted M.,"Manhattan, NY",44,151,1,2.0,4/18/2010,"about what you'd expect, which is to say - pretty miserable. a much smaller space than i was expecting, and bartenders are much less attractive than they'd lead you to believe. they dance well, sure, but ""letting it all hang out"" should not involve so much ""hanging out.""service is pretty poor - i was actually refused water twice, and once ordered my beer from a second bartender after the first one got my beer, walked it to the other end of the bar while she talked with her friends for 5 minutes, then came back and scoffed at me for having the nerve to order from someone else rather than wait for her. beers are cheap (can't ask for a better deal than $2 rolling rocks), but selection is piss-poor. at one point they actually ran out of pitchers, which seems unfathomable to me since pretty much everyone was drinking bottles or cans.crowd is odd, and somewhat tourist-y - not exactly the best nyc has to offer. music is, for the most part, country/southern rock, but unfortunately not very good southern rock.the entire time i was here, i wanted to vomit, but the bouncers were nice and remembered me when i stepped out for about 5 minutes at a time a couple times to get some air/go buy a bottle of water at the deli next door.i won't be back, and it's not even the kind of place i can say i'm glad i went to once.",4,,1

Being the community of Coyotes I would sue the place, or just make a raid attacking everything that moves there)). So one night I was about to go to the fancy schmancy place in meatpacking all dressed up, wearing the high heels and I happened to pass by this place. Ive heard a lot about this place and back in Russia a lot of my friends have liked the movie (which I never watched and I dont think Ill ever make myself to). So I got really curious to get in, see what it looks like inside of this legendary place and maybe have a glass of wine...just to warm myself up before grand drinking later. First thing I remember is a SHOCK...the guys inside...where the hell did they appear from??? they looked like the truckdrivers right from the highway after several days driving non-stop...all sweaty, filthy, with big barrel of beer instead of the belly....Yuck! And believe me I saw a lot of weird things in my life...but this one! I wanted to pierce my eyes! But how to erase that image from my memory... a lobotomy maybe? and there were girls dancing at the bar....i bet they looked totally different from that hollywood girl who danced and sang in the movie...I mean i wouldnt mind if the girls looked pretty with gorgeous bodies...but the last thing you want to see is the cellulite shaking in front of your face while you are having a sip of your drink. So I decided I needed a drink IMMEDIATELLY!!! So I came to the bar and ordered sauvingon blanc. They said they didnt have it. Ok, I said chardonnay is fine. The bartender replied they didnt have it either. Any wines? No, nothing. Ok I told to myself, no panic, vodka based martini would be fine. So I ordered Grey Goose vodka dirty martini. The bartender looked at me as if I was insane. I cant make this drink. We dont have Grey Goose. Ok (I still tried to be patient)...any vodka dirty martini. We dont have the olives. JESUS CHRIST!!!! Ok I said just give me a shot of vodka. all they had was Kettle 1 and for some reason it was sooo warm( excuse me i didnt order the hot sake). well, it was disgusting!!! I paid and tipped but I decided I'll never come back...nunca...nikogda. Not even in my worst nightmares!!!",1,1,

Who doesn't want to walk into a bar and immediately be hit with the stink of vomit sweat and piss? Saddle up to the bar on one of their fine stools and witness the fruit flies pecking at you and sitting on the drinks. Want to order a round? Put your hands on the rotting filthy wooden bar and wait for a girl to walk over and pour a glass of filth into your cup. If you're really up for it, you can go ahead and order the special, that's where a girl pulls you toward the bar, takes off your shirt, drinks a shot of house whiskey (gasoline and urine) and then spits it in your mouth. YES! That is what I have been waiting for, a girl I wouldn't be caught dead with vomiting a drink that tastes like a shoe into my mouth.

I live here and so do all my friends who used to mob this place several times per week. We partied hard with the bartenders, bouncers and managers who we all considered part of the family. We never had a problem with the low rent atmosphere and had no time for prima donnas sniffing about the poor state of the rest rooms. We loved our bar. Notice I'm using the past tense. Over the last year or so, with the exception of one or two, the quality of the bartenders has totally tanked and they've lost all appreciation for a loyal band of regulars who tip many times more than a frat boy one timer ever will. Personally, I'd be mortified to leave a measly buck tip for a drink knowing that my friends are trying to earn a living. One of the bartenders who we all used to think was the sweetest thing ever somehow became the general manager and immediately did a personality 180 when she realized she didn't need to waste her time being nice to you since her income didn't depend on your tips anymore. She didn't just become less friendly, she got downright rude and nasty and none of out regular group will ever go there again while she's still employed. Luckily, they have a high turn over and there's always hope. I wish there was some way to communicate to Lil that her flagship bar is being ruined.",3,,

It was always so much fun, I danced on the bar, the crowd was a mixture of hot young guys, young girls wanting to have a good time, and the occasional skeezy older man who was there simply to see the girls shake it on the bar. I was highly upset when it shut down.NYC Coyote Ugly... I stayed as far away from the bar as I could, the crowd was mostly skeezy older men wanting to see the girls shake it on the bar, ""moderately"" attractive girls, and only the occasional hot young guy.The two coyotes that were working were not doing a good job of getting the crowd really involved.... and they looked BORED when they were doing their signature dances on the bar. Hello, this is your job... put your back into it and have a nice smile on your face. One of the two times that they got other girls to come dance on the bar - it was horrible. It was this girl's birthday, she was very overweight, wearing a tube top, and one of the coyotes said she'd take off her shirt and give her a coyote ugly shirt. The coyote starts to pull up her shirt... slowly... slowly... now when she got to the part where you'd start seeing the strapless bra (that I assumed would be there since she's taking off her shirt in a bar - not a strip club) it wasn't. ***It is hard to shock me with this kind of stuff.... but my jaw hit the floor. I couldn't believe this girl just did that!!*** She was standing there topless for a good 30-40 seconds before the coyote got the shirt over her... OMG. The crowd also stood in shock, and then one of the older skeezy guys let out an awkward ""yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh""Also, it took the coyotes for-ev-er to do everything. I understand that I'm a girl, and not really their target audience, but you don't have to ignore me.... I'm one of the girls you're trying to get to dance on the bar to make your male customers happy and get you bigger tips. I was trying to order my last drink and close out my tab, but instead of coming to see what I want, they just pointed out my chest and said ""boobies boobies boobies"" to the beat of the song... which made all the guys within ear shot take a nice long look at the girls... which would be fine... if I was able to get what I came for! But no, I waited 20 minutes for a beer and my tab while the coyotes flirted with each other and the male patrons around me. The bar wasn't crowded, so this was really not necessary.I think that will be my one and only experience with this C.U. but doesn't mean I won't go to another one in the future... because I will hope it's more along the lines of the DC C.U. good time that I love.",2,6,1

Because damn, the moment a song comes on that they have some choreographed dance to, you're not drinking. and if another one comes on right after that, you're still not drinking. one bad run at the jukebox, you'll be sober enough to appreciate the big tipping leering men at both corners of the bar. The girl having a bacherlorette party seemed to have fun among the good-hearted jeering from the bartender who was forcing shots of well vodka on her and her friends. if only I could have been so lucky as to have been served when I was trying to pay. and of course, need I mention that the drinks were overpriced and weak? Im serious. Gin and Tonic, Club Soda is not an adequate substitution- and I paid 8 dollars for that drink.
