0,Ruth M.,"Eden Prairie, MN",76,231,48,5.0,7/29/2018,"We went to see Aladdin and we were blown AWAY! The production value was just mind boggling. Truly, to the production team, well freaking done! The little tricks that enhanced the performance were the page changing of a book, obviously getting the magic carpet to fly, and the outfit changes. Just a tiny few highlights, but there wasn't a single scene that went by that I wasn't in awe over the cleverness of the scenic designer, costume designer, illusion designer and the director who is also the choreographer for all of the dances! I can't even. Like an eruption of ""what the what?!"" So amazing. And my God for the performance numbers! *literally leaving me speechless and I can't find the words to describe my sense of astonishment*",,,
1,AnnMarie N.,"Rockville Centre, NY",132,276,866,3.0,9/12/2018,"Long legged humans beware! At least on the balcony... It's a tight fit.Quick process thru the front, tickets scanned from my phone, inspect my purse and straight to the elevator - complete with elevator attendant. Shown to our seats by a theater attendant, and let the show commence! Aladdin, a childhood fave, come to life on stage. Dazzling performances, expert musicians, amazing backdrops and costumes. There was no monkey. There was no elephant. I was disappointed. Enjoyed everything nonetheless. Make sure you pee at intermission, we were shuffled straight down the stairs and out the door at the end of the show.",1,1,1
2,Manoj B.,"San Francisco, CA",313,230,490,5.0,7/26/2018,"We came in here on a Saturday afternoon for the 2 PM show and as expected the place was packed. We had a smooth check in and had a great view from our seats on Mezzanine.And the show, Aladdin was just magical! The setup, wardrobe and performance - everything was spot on. Each of the actors did an amazing job especially Genie. Really worth a visit!",,,1

4,Maulik M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",321,297,885,4.0,4/7/2018,"The broadway show Alladin was definitely an experience of a lifetime. We had a great time watching Aladdin. The theater itself is gorgeous stunningly breathtakingly beautiful. The outside is not much to look at but the inside has been beautifully restored. The staff was accommodating and very helpful. Seats are slightly cramped anyone over 5'11 may be looking forward to the intermission to stretch their legs. They could use more bathrooms as there's always a long line during the intermission and the downstairs bar only takes cash. The lobby is small compared to most other theaters on Broadway so arrive in time to get seated before the show starts. It can be quite crowded in staircases if you're sitting in Mezz level and there isn't a great exit strategy but beyond that, this theater is historic with beautiful architecture. Beautiful theater, great hospitality, and even better performance. I highly recommend bringing the family to see Disney shows at this place!",10,4,8
5,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,4.0,4/19/2018,"The New Amsterdam Theatre is one of the better Broadway theaters I've visited. A few of the Broadway theaters are ran down and in desperate need of repairs. Currently New Amsterdam is home to Aladdin - The Musical, which is a remarkable show. (I highly recommend seeing it). This theater is spacious and have the old school feel that we all love so much; hoping to get a feel for what it's like to have lived in New York City ""back in the day"" and ""go to the theater."" lol Concessions are going to be expensive - as with any Broadway show - but coat check is only $3. It's the cheapest thing you can get at the theater. Go figure.",1,,
6,Caelan D.,"Englishtown, NJ",2,2,1,5.0,10/14/2018,"I saw Aladdin here, and both the theater and the show was amazing! I recommend anyone and everyone to come here, and/or see Aladdin! P.S Thanks to the Sultan for letting us go onto the stage after the play!",,,1
7,Trish J.,"Freehold, NJ",227,174,533,4.0,4/30/2018,"This is a beautiful theater. I came here to see Aladdin on a spring day. Getting through the line at the door was simple and quick. The bag checker  was a joke he took a very brief look in my bag. I could've snuck anything in there and gotten away with it. So I'm not convinced that this place is really that secure. This is the fist broadway show that I've been to where your tickets are scanned directly from your phone. I loved this because you don't have to fuss with printable tickets from home. Our seats were in mezzanine and we took the elevator (equipped with an elevator attendant btw) up to the second floor. We had 2 minuets until the show started we were promptly lead to our seats by theatre staff. The seats were terribly uncomfortable, not so much for me because I had the aisle seat but the leg room is pretty much non existent. I'm 5'9 and my son is 5'6 and he was complaining about his legs throughout the performance. At 5'11 my husband completely gave up and stood in the back of the theatre (the floor manager said this was ok) during the entire second act. As far as the seats' girth I found it to be acceptable. I'm plus sized and I set comfortably. It was really just the leg room that was a real bummer. But as with all of the broadway theaters snug seating isn't just exclusive to this place. The place was a little warm no temperature control I guess. The bathroom and concession stand at intermission were an absolute zoo but that's to be expected. The place was clean and the employees were very friendly/helpful. I'd certainly return.Also, it's location is great. There are all sorts of nearby restaurants like Dallas BBQ, BB Kings, etc to eat at. Not to mention it's super close to the port authority.",8,2,8
8,Takeshi Y.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1190,226,5649,5.0,3/20/2018,"1. The New Amsterdan Theater is a traditional old school stage performance/musical theater. This high cultural institution is one of the pride, joy, and honor of the Broadway theater district. It is conveniently located at the heat of the theater district by the Times Square in Manhattan, New York. 2. ALADDIN: I was invited to see the Aladdin, produced by the Disney at the New Amsterdam Theater. This live stage musical is an adaptation of the Disney's original children's fantasy anime movie. And this really opened the door to the completely new groups of audience, otherwise they would never ever visited the New Amsterdam Theater. I saw so many little and young children came to see this masterpieces. 3. DISNEY'S TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT CONCEPT: I really respect how Disney production created and operated this musical here. The choice of the very classically decorated and accessorized New Amsterdam Theater was magical. Each employees even dressed up in costumes and played their cast role all over the places inside the theater. Even before the show starts, you are pulled into the dreamy fantasy world of Disney's Aladdin here. What a treat for the children of all ages! I wish every musical theaters adapt this special treat for the audience like this. I was deeply inspired, even before the show stars. 4. MUSICAL: The Disney production and its workers' quality and love for their art and for their audience here were completely different level and truly beyond this world than any musical and live theater performance engagements I visited before. You really have to experience this with your all senses before you die.        5. ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS: As a visual artist, I was deeply inspired, except there are few rooms of improvements. One is the lighting of the main theater before and after the show. (Needless to say, no photographying and videotaping during the show.) I wish the lighting here were a bit lighter and they installed more upscale lighting (such as temporary but classic-looking chandeliers, for an example) so that even the common smartphones and cheep digital camera can take a great photos of their friends and family member against the interior of the theater  here. Sadly, the best photoshooting spot with the perfect lighting was only at the entrance of this theater's ticket counter, which I took several photos and posted below.   If you have never seen the Aladdin here, I highly recommend you to get the tickets IMMEDIATELY and see their small miracles at the New Amsterdam Theater. PS: TRADITIONAL STAGE PERFORMANCE THEATER: This means this traditional performance theater, New Amsterdam Theater, although the cutting edge entertainment technology by Disney company's was poured, it was a traditional stage performance/musical theater. They do not use the today's virtual reality 3D headsets, holographic 3D projection (such as the Laserium theaters with truly hallucination-inducing magical laser shows of 1970s) or individually interactive fully computerized animatronic puppets -- all these were done before 2000 in Japan. Compare this to the ""live performance"" and ""live musical concert"" by the Vocaloids, which completely pack the giant auditoriums and concert halls in Japan and around the world today. The Vocaloids super star such as Miku Hatsune already established a top singer status in Japanese music industry, although her personality, physical appearances, gestures, motions, and even her very own voice were all completely man-created and synthesized by high speed computer programs (which you can also purchase and let her sing of your own original musical notes for you even in your studio apartment even with an decades-old  desktop computer.) On the stage, her computer-generated 3D HD projection image is used. Miku's international traveling show was also held in NYC and other big cities in the US and around the world today. I am a really big fan of Miku Hatsune. I hope Disney incorporate this Japanese cutting edge entertainment technology and culture before long.

Dad complained about the seats being a bit tight however, he is over 6 feet sooooooo, sorry tall fellas, you may feel the same . The attendants were very helpful with helping us find out seats and we didn't experience any interruptions while watching the play . FYI, the decor' inside is amazing.",,,
10,Pearl W.,"Suitland, MD",20,132,220,5.0,3/31/2018,My boyfriend treated us to see the Aladdin play on a Sunday Afternoon. The theatre is right in Times Square so catching the train was most convenient. We got there right on time and was seated immediately. A lot of people were there but the staff was able to manage the large crowd. We sat up on the balcony and had great seats. It's an old theatre so it is kind of tight. The show started on time and it was nothing but great! Big ups to Major Attaway who played the genie! AWESOMEEEEE I LOVED HIM. He was definitely the show! The show was appropriate for all ages ( I'm in my late 20s haha) definitely recommend ! Great date option!,,,
11,Will L.,"Lafayette Hill, PA",527,443,28,5.0,1/28/2018,"Great place to watch Aladdin! We didn't have the ""best"" seats in the house by any stretch, but we had no problem at all seeing the show. Getting in was really easy with digital tickets, and while they did check bags, they didn't give us a hard time about bringing water in.Our seats were comfortable and had some room to place our backpacks and such, and it didn't feel cramped. The restrooms downstairs were clean and big enough to accommodate everyone.The show itself was fun as well and made me want to watch the original movie again, and get excited about the new one coming out!",1,,
12,Pamela M.,"Wellington, FL",40,47,164,4.0,12/23/2017,The family and I saw Aladdin and we loved it. It was a fun play. The theater seating is a little tight though. I would recommend seeing the play.,1,,
13,Bianca M.,"Las Vegas, NV",419,172,183,5.0,11/14/2017,The theater is old school and I enjoyed getting a feel for how it used to be back in the day! It might not be as convenient now but it was okay. I guess just don't be in a rush to get out of there it takes a little time. They play I watch was Aladdin and it was really good. Didn't expect it to be as good as it was.,2,,
14,Melissa M.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,209,208,4.0,10/15/2017,"A+ for multiple bathrooms, one on each floor I think. B- for the chaotic line outside. This theatre might be the biggest in the area I've step foot in, and I've been to about 10. While I felt that put 5th row mezzanine seats were still pretty good, I imagine the top few rows are a little too far up for a good view. Single wine was $15, I think double was $21 or so, Coke's are $9. I realize I should've taken a pic of the menu.",1,,
15,Aly R.,"West Orange, NJ",208,202,197,4.0,1/7/2018,"Aladdin is a fantastic show. If this review was of the show only, it would be five stars due to the quality of the production. The sets, the costumes, and the talent were all top notch. To speak specifically about the theater - there isn't a bad seat in the house. Keep in mind that if you sit in the balcony area, the steps are extremely steep. The credit card machine was not working at the concession stand on our level and was cash only.",5,2,3
16,Chrissy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,167,414,5.0,7/21/2017,The theatre overall is really nice with an amazing staff. It's pretty big and lots of seats. Elevated enough to see without anyone's head in the way. Best spot would be the mezzanine seats.,3,,

We were in town for the marathon and what better way to keep off of your feet than to enjoy theatre? Aladdin was so much fun! I loved it! I'd highly suggest attending this musical, perfect for all ages but if your little ones are really young, please do us all a favor and leave them with a sitter. It's not fun for anyone to have a young child crying in here and it's not really fair for them either.Our seats were fantastic but boy are they small and crammed. I'm fairly petite and let me tell you it was a struggle for me, so if you're taller than about 4'6 and weigh more than 65 lbs you may not be entirely comfortable. We purchased via ticketmaster and then later also tried for the lottery which didn't pan out so were happy we had purchased in advance of our travel.The staff were all very friendly, I loved their uniforms really added to the experience and theatre itself is just beautifully ornate. The performance was surely 5 STARS.",9,5,6
19,Jessica W.,"Lovettsville, VA",208,226,334,4.0,5/3/2017,"Although I saw Aladdin at this theater, I am reviewing just the theater itself, not the actual show. The seats on the balcony are incredibly tight. I have been to several Broadway theaters, and I generally find them to be happily average-sized. These were very much tighter than the average theater. I am not very tall (5'6""), but my knees were touching the seat in front of me. Also, at most Broadway theaters, every seat is a good seat. Not so at this theater. It's very steep in the balcony seating section, and it's hard to see. Many times when the actors were downstage, I found myself having to lean forward to be able to see completely. One of the great things, however, is the bathrooms on the balcony-level. They're spacious, clean, and easy to access. Some of the Broadway theaters have smaller, dated bathrooms which makes intermission tricky; however, the bathrooms were great here.",7,,2
20,Lucie T.,"New York, NY",16,77,405,5.0,6/24/2017,"Beautiful theatre in a very busy, congested area. It's right on Times Square. I saw ""Aladdin"", the seats are spacious, but the leg rooms are very compacted.",1,,
21,Gigi L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,0,5.0,11/14/2017,"A few weeks ago, I purchased tickets to Aladdin for a surprise birthday gift to my brother. Little did my brother know, I was also the surprise - traveling from Los Angeles to celebrate his 28th Birthday! I flew into town on Friday and planned on watching Aladdin on Saturday for their 2 pm showing. That morning, I had slipped in the bath, pushing us to be about 2 hours late to the show - I had almost lost hope until the accommodating staff came to my aid with solutions. My first interaction was with Kellie, the theatre floor manager - she then directed me to a gentleman named Mike, their ticketing Manager, whom by far had the friendliest demeanor, and BEST customer service etiquette I've ever experienced.After briefly explaining my situation regarding my injured back, he already had options setup. Mike was able to reschedule our show for Sunday and seated us in a more comfortable chair for my lower back. He was incredibly understanding, and kind hearted. I will be going back to see other shows they have at their theatre!",2,,
22,Joshua F.,"San Francisco, CA",419,555,370,5.0,1/26/2018,"This review is for the theater only, not the play.Disney really outdid themselves and picked the perfect theater for Aladdin. Every service employee was in costume and played their cast role (think the old Tower of Terror). Moreover, the theater was the perfect size for the mid-tier play. Awesome.The cast for the Aladdin play we saw seemed a bit tired and lagged. I saw the SF cast and they were tremendous.",,,
23,Shadya N.,"New York, NY",25,129,208,3.0,11/16/2016,"Lovely theater! The location isn't the greatest (time square) but certainly very convenient, especially for tourists. Attended the Aladdin show, and it was just magnificent. The theater is large, however the seating area is extremely tight. You can bet you'll be touching your neighbor a couple of times throughout the night. Rows aren't properly leveled, so if your on the shorter side or the guest in front of you is much taller, you will find yourself looking for a better view during the show. Other than that, staff are helpful. Gift shop available as well as bar/snack area (Expensive, so beware).Bathrooms were very clean and the show was great!! Easy to get in and out of theater, and always someone available to help. PS* souvenir cup provided after beverage purchase",1,,
24,Gerardine R.,"Corona, NY",0,15,31,5.0,1/21/2018,The theater is quite large and even has an elevator if you dont want to walk up to the mezzazine or balcony. We were seated in the right mezzanine (GG 2 and 4) and had a great view of the stage. The seats though are a bit cramped. We were lucky and got the aisle seat so my bf was able to stretch out his leg. Im 5'0 so it wasnt a problem for me.We saw Aladdin and loved every minute of it. Great show for all ages. It does deviate from the movie but it was still awesome. The genie and the magic carpet was the best part!!,,,
25,Joshua R.,"East Windsor, NJ",2,13,32,4.0,9/1/2017,"Saw this on Friday. Sat row J balcony. Surprisingly comfortable. I has enough legroom (I'm about 5' 7""). There was a long line to get in, but we cut the line and were thrown in with a big bunch of people who were in front of the doors. Got autographs (not pictured). Good show and nice staff. My mom was afraid of the steep incline so I had to cover her view as me and her switched seats before the show haha. Other than that, great experience. Beautiful theatre. Something important to note is that from Balcony Row J seat 15, there is a pipe, so the ticket is labeled as obstructed view along with ""SEAT BEHIND PIPE"" printed on the ticket as well. The ticket was $57.50 (bought on the day of the performance, a few hours prior; it was an 8:00 show).",1,1,1
26,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1260,5.0,1/25/2016,"I came here during Broadway week (2 for 1 tix) to see Aladdin. I been wanting to see this play for awhile but didn't want to pay full price so this was great. We arrived a little bit early and were led inside while they opened up. They had a bar and a stand with some Aladdin items for sale but nothing not caught my eye.We finally went inside and once the show started it was great. The acting, singing, stage and props were all really good and the show had us captivated the whole time.If you want to see a show then see Aladdin it was awesome.",15,7,10
27,Margo S.,"Somerset, Somerset, NJ",25,9,9,5.0,10/1/2017,Husband won the lottery. I did not want to go to the play because I had so much to do today but I am glad we did.

28,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",13,72,165,5.0,2/12/2016,"Location: right in Times Square on broadwayAtmosphere: vintage but just beautiful if you can appreciate architecture, and great artistry throughout the venue. The theatre is definitely historical. Show: absolutely amazing!!! I watched Aladdin and it was perfect!Very colourful play, great special effects and grand scale backdrops. Kudos to the creative team and the special effects. Dancing throughout made it enjoyable along with the witty humour using current events. Only downfall is they speak so fast that I'm sure my mom missed a lot of great whimsical jokes. Overall I would watch this show again and again. Worth every penny. Products on sale are a bit over priced but that typical in any of these type of venues. Enjoy the show! And remember to rub the lamp outside the theatre and make a wish ;)",3,,
29,Jenna L.,"Syracuse, NY",314,379,1567,4.0,3/4/2016,"I saw Aladdin here on 2/13/15. We were all the way up in the balcony, despite the fact I am deathly afraid of heights, it wasn't TERRIBLE (still scary though not gonna lie). We could see the stage perfectly, and the show was absolutely amazing. We arrived a half hour early, we bought our tickets in advance so the admission and seating went relatively fast. We were in our seats 15 min before the show started. They start the show at the EXACT time it says on the ticket which I liked. It's nice not to wait around, but for the people who showed up late it wasn't so great for them. Some people were walking in 30 minutes after the show started. Eek.There are concession stands at every level. Prepare to spend around $26 dollars for 2 beers which come with a complementary plastic Aladdin cup. Ended up giving the cup to my little cousin. They have snacks such as chips, nuts, candy, etc. Don't ask me the price because I don't even want to know after spending that much on beer, but it's Manhattan what do you expect. I forgot this wasn't a movie theater and couldn't get the good stuff like nachos with cheese haha.The theatre and bathrooms were spotless. The ushers were great. I've been to 3 Broadway shows and this was one of the nicer theaters for sure.",2,,1
30,Amanda M.,"Washington, DC",1126,741,3887,4.0,4/17/2016,"Saturday 8pm showing of Aladdin.  Section 3, orchestra area in row 3.  Our seats were to the left of the stage at a slight angle, a little difficult to view because we were having to look up so I would recommend center seats or anything further back.I was pleasantly surprised by the production of Aladdin, it kept my attention the entire time.  It had great dancing, singing, comedy and special effects.There is an area in the front before you enter the theater where you can purchase souvenirs. The concession stand has snacks, a pretty well stocked bar and non-alcoholic beverages.  A water, soda and sour patch kids was $19.I would definitely come back to see another show at this theater.",1,,

Specifically, genie stole the show!  Genie was charming, funny, energetic, and entertaining!  But of course all the characters brought their A game to provide us an awesome show!Also the disappearance scenes were just magical and supertacular that you are left scratching your head on how they do it!Would definitely recommend Broadway shows in NY!Oh, and even the upstairs seating had awesome views!",2,,
32,Anam F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",71,14,12,5.0,2/18/2018,"My husband took me to see Aladdin for my birthday and boy oh boy was it a great pick. The show was entertaining beginning to end. Costumes, sets, characters and everything else was very well thought out. They made small changes to the story but nothing that will be objectionable to a die hard disney follower like myself. The theater was beautiful, although a little heads up to those people on the heavier or taller side, the seats are very congested. Totally understandable though, an amazing show such as this is in high demand and therefore they want to fit in as many people as they can. Ofc it was still a houseful. The show is obviously viewable from all angles but I'd suggest avoiding the balcony seats since its a very acute side view and ofc if you want to save some bucks and buy seats on the back of the theater, you better keep your fingers crossed that the person ahead of you isn't too tall lol.

I did not go up to the balcony, but I could see how pitched the ceiling was above us, and I am sure glad I avoided the balcony bc it looked super steep!! The mezzanine was great!  There were 4 of us and we sat in row PP on the side.  I was worried that our little 8 year old would have a hard time seeing so far in the back if it wasn't pitched enough, but she could see just fine!The best part about row MM, NN, PP, QQ is that they are rows of 4.  So if you are a group of 4 you have the whole row to yourself! No one getting up to leave and you dont have to interrupt anyone if you need to sneak out quick to the restroom. THE BEST ROW IN MEZZ IS ROW MM on the side.  It is a row of 4 and you have your own entrance to the row so you dont have to go up the stairs and come back down.I made sure to take 3 pictures of the mezz area so you can see the view:Front RowMiddleBackThey were all good seats as we had second from the top in Mezz and could see the show just great!",42,,4

The ushers are so friendly and helpful, the staff at the bar and the souvenir stands are great and the show is FANTASTIC!I can honestly say that any and all expectations were exceeded with my visit there and if I lived anywhere close to NYC I'd probably go back again just to relive the experience.

The New Amsterdam's interior is glorious architecture and equipped with great acoustics for sound, fully audible and sound accessible throughout the Balcony level.  Surround sound can be heard during Aladdin's search as the prophecy ""A Diamond in the Rough"" to find the magic lamp in the Cave of Wonders and warns him not to touch anything except the lamp but Abu, the mischievous monkey touches a large ruby (Aladdin touches a coin for the stage version without Abu) and the cave angrily uproars loudly. The stage is equipped with hidden compartments for the Genie and his enchantments to disappear and re-appear.  Kid-friendly as ushers distribute cushions for your child to sit higher. The Mezzanine Center area is stadium style seating with steps and aisles are well lit.  The ceiling is adorned with gold relief art and elaborate crystal chandeliers.Overall Experience - The large dark red stage curtain brings excitement and high anticipation for performance time.  Over 100 years old, yet still standing with glory and showcasing great Broadway theatrical plays and musical performances today.  The New Amsterdam Theatre is designated a New York landmark in 1997.""Opened in 1903, the New Amsterdam was Broadway's biggest theatre. It enjoyed great success in the early part of the decade with ""The Ziegfeld Follies"" but didn't fare well during the Great Depression, not fully recovering until the 1990s, when Disney Theatrical Productions signed a long-term lease.  The New Amsterdam has since housed many of Disney's biggest Broadway hits: The Lion King, Mary Poppins, and its current resident musical, Aladdin."" -- Wikipedia",5,,3

Built in 1903 I can't imagine the musicals and plays it's seen over the years, the talent that has come through, the folks who have sat in the same chairs etc. The architecture of this place is exquisite and the attention to detail from the seating arrangement to the balconies to the ceilings is just unmatched. We came up to NYC for Aladdin The Musical and it did not disappoint. The set design was amazing, the cast was stunning and incredibly talented. It was very much a childhood dream come true. I could not quit smiling the entire show. My only complaint is that the seats are a little small (1903 America was MUCH smaller than 2017 America) and while I will be hitting the gym in the morning that would be the one thing I would restore about the theater. Everyone minus the children in the crowd were in each other's laps. Other than that one comical thing everything was perfection!!!",1,1,1

We arrived 15 minutes before the show which wasn't a problem since the staff kept the line moving and got everyone seated quickly and efficiently. They had plenty of staff to help with the hundreds of people walking through asking questions, stopping to take pictures, and getting refreshments to keep everyone moving and get the show started on time.We had great seats that were comfortable to sit in for the 2+ hours of show time, the bathrooms were clean, spacious aisles so that you had leg room (not enough to let people pass you though, that would deserve 5 stars!)Overall great venue, can't wait to see another show here!",1,,
47,Lotus H.,,62,93,259,3.0,8/25/2017,I came here to see Alladin. The way this theatre is designed was not efficient at all. You have to pick up your tickets 30-15 min PRIOR to entrance or they will NOT let you in. It's faster to take the elevator up and down than to take the stairs. Once the show ends you can take the stairs but it'll take twice as long. It will also lead you straight to the street. Balcony level seating was a lot closer than the other theatres I visisted. Quite uncomfortable.,1,,

Second, there's a bathroom on the mezzanine floor. None of that go from the mezzanine down to the first floor and then down some more to the basement to line up in a never ending line to use the bathroom. Third, our mid-mezzanine seats were great - even on the right side. We were able to see so much and the seats are sloped enough that I'm able to see even with the tall guy in front of me. There's plenty of leg room, at least for someone of my height. The people working are pleasant - sometimes you get the cranky seat usher who will snap at you for just being in his section!

50,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1132,1290,6797,5.0,12/9/2014,"Wowwwwwww....... what a beautiful theatre with a very rich history.  Apparently, from 1913 - 1927, this housed the Ziegfeld Follies where Mr. Ziegfeld himself kept an office in the same bldg. and even operated a nightclub on the roof.  Then, many years later, Disney got an exclusive lease for this to be their theatre for all Disney productions, which is currently the home of Aladdin.  While this was designated as a New York City landmark back in 1979, it was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in '80.  This theatre, along with the Lyceum, is the oldest surviving Broadway venue.  One thing's for certain, I know it's old because my knees crunched into the row in front of me.  People weren't very tall back when this theatre was constructed, and I'm finding this more and more in most of the Broadway theatre venues.As for Disney show productions, they spared no expense, and this current production of Aladdin was sensational.  Not only did James Monroe Iglehart steal the show with his outstanding performance as the Genie, but the costumes, scenery and other performers were just as wonderful.",2,1,1

The theater was beautiful but smaller than I thought, which is not necessarily a bad thing. We sat in center orchestra row N and the seats were incredible - great view! I really think that even the last rows in orchestra had a great view. The artsy ceiling and box seats are nice to look at before the show starts. Every single staff member I encountered was very polite and had a smile on their face. There are bathrooms on every level but the orchestra bathrooms are downstairs in the basement. During intermission, the women's line wrapped around the stairs but thankfully it moved very quickly because there are 14 stalls!One star off because the seats are tiny. The legroom wasn't bad (I'm 5'7), but I felt cramped between my 6'2 husband and the man sitting on my other side. Also - my bag of M&Ms cost $5! Lol.

54,Mariana P.,"White Plains, NY",3,17,7,4.0,2/19/2017,Date night to see Aladdin. The show was incredible. The entire cast was amazing. Our favorite was the Genie & Jafar. The staff helped us get to our seats immediately since the show was about to open. The seats are super tight so we had to remove our jackets to sit comfortably. The only bad thing I can say is that the seats being so tight refrained us from being able to get any souvenirs. The entire row of people have to get up to make space to go out. To our luck we had middle of the row seats. I def recommend seeing Aladdin. It's super romantic,,,

The show itself was great and easily one of my favorites. Parking can be found a short distance away and is within walking distance from the theater. You'll end up paying around $40 for a few hours.

The decor in this theater and setup is beautiful as well.Now the negatives. The seating is very tight, not much leg room. It is a bit annoying when people want to get by for their seats as well. If you want to drink expect to pay an arm and a leg. I payed 34$ for two jack and cokes. Granted they made them for me strong, they were not worth 34$!

Updated review","The New Amsterdam Theatre has a rich history of Broadway shows, including some of the best and classic Disney themed shows.  They are located on 42nd street which only adds to the classic feeling.  They are fast and efficient at getting you in and out of the show and have a nice facility.  My last review was lower because of the seat location but this time I had great seats for Aladdin.",11,9,9
60,Melissa N.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,564,947,3.0,3/6/2014,"Came here to see Aladdin yesterday!Entering the theatre was quick and easy which was great since it was a freezing cold night! Quick scans and we were in - surprising since it was like a mob scene. The place was very nice with old charm. Nice distance orchestra seating, but small seats.I did not have such a great view either with this kid who was towering a head taller than my seat because he was using not one but TWO cushions.. keep in mind that the seats angle upwards as the rows go back and he was still that much higher. I need you to picture this - the cushions were level with, if not higher than, the arm rests..AND this boy didn't even look interested in the show! He was like half sleeping the whole time and blocking my entire left side view for the first half of the show. I really couldn't bring myself to say anything so my bf grabbed a cushion for me (and for the lady behind me bc I would tower and block her view as well) how sweet :)  Meanwhile this woman was kicking my chair so much you'd think she was having her knee reflex tested the whole night. On top of that, I was sitting next to a guy that smelled like a liquor bar counter who very tall and required a lot of space..I made due and scowl to myself and my bf because that's what i do..The show itself was pretty good. The Genie's song was great, but ""A Whole New World"" and ""Prince Ali"" were a bit disappointing.. Abu is not there and carpet is not a character, but there were some new characters.To be honest, I was on a Disney cruise in November 2013 and their Aladdin performance was better than this.. and that was INCLUDED with my cruise. I feel terrible that this didn't fit our high hopes because my bf took me to see ""The Little Mermaid"" (my fav) for my birthday and I brought him to see his for his birthday and it was okay to us. Maybe we were tainted by the cruise..The genie was funny, but not hilarious, Aladdin was good, Jasmine was forgettable (I'm mainly thinking of A Whole New World), but her costume was beautiful! The other characters were fun. I thought it was GREAT that JAFAR from the ORIGINAL movie was the Jafar in the show! It brings you right back to hear his voice. That was really cool!Overall, I would recommend it because it was a nice night out, but it wouldn't be the end of the world to miss it either.",2,1,
61,Melissa H.,"Concord, CA",0,6,0,3.0,1/6/2018,"We saw Aladdin at the New Amsterdam and the show was amazing!  The theater is beautiful, and I would agree with other commenters about the cramped seating, but would also add that the cushions are very uncomfortable, and the cushions are showing their age and probably need to be replaced.  You had to constantly adjust how you sat to prevent discomfort.  My girls were also in agreement with this. We had orchestra seating, in row R, with a great view of the show, which I would highly recommend seeing.",,,
62,Don L.,"Franklin, MA",31,184,131,4.0,12/9/2014,"I recently attended a performance of Aladdin. The show was definitely wonderful and I agree that the theater was nicely restored. The views were nice and the employees were friendly and helpful.   No doubt the Disney connection helps on that point. I found the absence of legroom in the Mezzanine level to be downright painful. I am somewhat used to this given that I am very tall, but having read several reviews extolling the legroom made the actual experience doubly disappointing. Looking down, it did look like there was a lot more legroom in the prime seating area. I recommend that if you really want or need legroom fork over the price for the expensive seats.",,,

I can't say whether leg room goes down as the seating area goes higher up, but our group (ranging in height from 5'10 to 5' tall) was pleased.  We were very close to the box seat area, which had beautiful carvings. The whole theatre is a pleasure to look at and I felt it added to the overall positive experience with this play. While this review is about the theatre itself, I'll add that Aladdin was a great play, with gorgeous costumes and backdrops and a talented cast. Snacks and drinks were pricey, but that's about the same in any theater.  I got a mint lemonade drink in a special Aladdin plastic cup, and it was around $11.

It followed very close to the story we all know, yet had hints of pop culture cleverly tucked into the plot. Visually, this was also incredible.

I found the place impressive--lovely old ambiance, good seats, terrific sound.  There are a lot of stairs to navigate to get to bathrooms, but a disable bathroom is available on the main floor.I went to see Aladdin and found it very colorful, energetic and fun. Sets were terrific, performances were great, dancing and singing were, as expected, great.

I am 5'2'' and I was uncomfortable with the leg space, I felt horrible for my claustrophobic, scared of heights, 6'2'' uncle sitting next to me. It is just not practical the amount of space some theatres allot their audience to sit for 2-3 hours. ALSO, we had high school students from Italy (about 30 of them) sitting behind us. I remember what it was like to be an obnoxious teenager and out with my friends with our teacher, I get it. But my loud Italian mother ( who still scares me) asked (yelled) at them twice to be quiet and they rudely spoke back to her and added some gestures (kids these days). They were flat out rude. Then during intermission, my party, the party next to us, and the party in front of us (about 16 people) all complained to our ushers about the rude teenagers (children) sitting behind us talking throughout the play. The usher said she would talk to the chaperon and act accordingly if it continued in the second act. Well  that did not happen... Aladdin was great but the kids behind us made it really hard to listen and experience everything Broadway has to offer, not to mention we paid a pretty penny for those seats. I understand kids will be kids, and teenagers are the worst, I remember it, it was only a few (okay maybe a decade) years ago.

84,Angeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,597,290,4.0,7/31/2014,"I reviewed this theatre when I came here recently to see Aladdin!  Below is my review for Aladdin, but I wanted to review the actual theatre.  We sat in the left hand orchestra seats and they were not bad seats at all.  We were in the middle of the row and I didn't feel like I was stuck in a tiny space.  The seats are comfortable and the view was great.  I found the people working here to be really nice and friendly!  It fit very well with the whole Disney musical theme.  The mens and womens restrooms are in the basement and they are on opposite sides.  The bathrooms are pretty big and clean.  I would definitely come back and buy the same seats again!   My review for Aladdin:The show is 2.5 hours with a 30 min intermission.  We sat in the orchestra seats on the left side and they were great seats!  The genie was really funny.  The storyline was executed well and I never felt like I wanted the musical to end.  They don't really concentrate on the love story between Aladdin and Jasmine as much, but that doesn't take away from the show.Make sure you pay attention to the dialogue and also the scene where Aladdin makes his first wish.  The singing and dancing was amazing.  The scene with the magic carpet is also another great scene.  I wish I could fly on that magic carpet.  It looked truly magical =)If you are in town and get the chance to see Aladdin, I highly suggest you come see it!  Disney musicals never fail.",1,,1

We were a little worried about our seats being up too high & not being able to see, but after being in this theatre, I imagine that any seat would give you a great show.  The sound, the lighting, the sets-- everything was fantastic.  I was in awe throughout the whole show.  Aladdin was a great musical, not too impressed with how the pair sang ""A Whole New World"" which is one of the most classic Disney duets songs, but that calls for another review. The New Amsterdam Theatre did not disappoint one bit!",2,,

Excellent service at the food and drink stands and a pretty good selection of snacks and cocktails.",1,,
89,Colleen J.,"Montebello, CA",23,23,3,3.0,8/9/2015,This is a review of the building. I did not enjoy the first half of the musical because I had no leg room whatsoever. I couldn't even put my feet flat on the floor in a normal sitting position. I was leaving at intermission when the staff member in the elevator began to talk to me and found out my problem. She found someone to get me a different seat. The second half was much more enjoyable. I am sad that they'd actually sell tickets to seats that someone couldn't sit in without doing yoga. Their entire balcony needs to be remodeled. 5 stars for the staff. 5 stars for the cast of Aladdin.,1,,

91,La S.,"Great Neck, NY",294,630,101,3.0,3/2/2014,"It's a nice theater, but the seats are made for anorexic people.  The building structure is also a bit off, as in some of the seating areas, there are giant poles holding the structure together, and there's a seat there, but no human could actually sit there - maybe half an alien.I have been to many productions here, most of which have been Disney related.  Last night was Aladdin.  The costumes were beautiful and for the most part was nicely done.  Jasmine was horrible and they under did ""Prince Ali"" - so it was only a meh production for me.I think Disney needs to come in and sort this place out; there's so much potential for growth here, but they're so overly consumed with making as much money as they can, they don't realize that they're sacrificing their desired market in doing so.",,,1
92,Devin L.,"Yonkers, NY",309,729,108,4.0,3/3/2014,"Saw Aladdin yesterday.I liked it enough, well acted, good singers.  The place itself was great.  Beautiful venue.  I got my tickets a little late, so I had to sit in the balcony, but the sight lines were great, the sound was very good.  I had no complaints about the seating at all, with the exception of leg room.  My long legs don't take well to Broadway theaters.The odd thing is that they waste a few seats, by putting support poles directly in front of a few seats, basically negating some of the seats.Entering and leaving was a bit of controlled chaos.  They direct you to elevators to get to the mezz and balcony.  There can be long waits, but there are stairs.  The hall itself gets very packed when leaving.  Either wait a few minutes to leave, or get out as quickly as possible.",,,
93,Kaitlin G.,"San Francisco, CA",62,47,16,5.0,4/29/2015,"Thank you Eisner and Disney Theatrical for investing in the New Amsterdam Theatre, taking a once dilapidated venue and restoring it back as what's now one of the most beautiful theatres ever. The interior is done up in Art Nouveau so when you walk in, you feel as if you've stepped inside a garden courtyard. Here, the New Amsterdam ushers are Disney-employed, meaning customer service and communication are top-notch; these cast members are on top of their game demonstrating the Four Keys, getting people to and from their seats quickly, efficiently, and with courtesy. Bravo.No seat is a bad seat here, except for maybe limited view. I was recently lucky to grab the last orchestra seat for a Saturday night performance of Aladdin - which was superb. Expect to get up, grab a drink, and stretch your legs during the fifteen-minute intermission because, as with all of these theaters, the legroom is very limited. However, if you absolutely need your legroom, see if you can score a seat in the very back Orchestra row where there are free-standing chairs as those offer ample space to stretch out your legs.If you ever find yourself in Manhattan, catch a show at the New Amsterdam if not for the show, then for the beautiful carve work and general splendor of this historic venue.",1,,

Was told they are an independent theater and they CHOOSE THE TICKETS FOR YOU!!  Should have known when the PB rep said please don't hold it against him, he'll put in my request for Mezzanine, but could not guarantee anything!  Soooooo, what did I get?? THE VERY LAST ROW IN THE THEATER, ORCHESTRA LEVEL!! Really great for the three little kids who probably won't be able to see a thing.  So ticked off. Would never have bought the tickets had I known that was where my ''chosen"" seating would be. Reported my displeasure to PB that they shouldn't do business with a theater that doesn't let people know the seating availability BEFORE making a purchase. Learned my lesson not to buy a pig in a poke....(p.s. Have used PB for many things in the past & have always been more than pleased with services).",1,1,

97,Sarah J.,"San Francisco, CA",484,96,63,4.0,8/16/2014,"Our seats were left Balcony A seats. I'm an average-height female and had to lean forward in my chair so that the railing didn't block the view of the stage's edge. Here, you can see the whole stage, even the conductor/orchestra. The seats are pretty high and you can't really see faces that well, which made me wish I made my other choice of middle mezzanine seats. It also seemed a bit dangerous walking down the steep stairs to get to our seats. A trip and I could have gone tumbling off the balcony. Overall, the theater is quite old but they have maintained it well. I didn't think the seats were too small as others have written. But this must also be because we had A seats. They are cushioned and comfortable. Aladdin (or pretty much ""the Genie show"") here was unbelievably good, and the resources/technology of the theatre seems to be on par with the necessities of the show.Notes: - Good, they have elevators for being such an old theater.- Good, they had bathrooms on the balcony floor so that we didn't have to go down.- Good, they started the show ~10 minutes later than the stated time for last-minute people to settle down in their seats.-Good, we were one of those last-minute people and it took less than 5 minutes from when we entered the theater to sit down in our seats.",5,2,
98,Christina L.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",1,7,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"This is not a review of Aladdin, or the theatre as a venue. This is a review of the horrid staff at the ticketing office. I was visiting NYC with my two kids, and my niece and nephew. It was an expensive trip, and getting Broadway tickets for the five of us felt so out of reach of what I could afford. But I wanted to give the kids the unique Broadway show experience and decided to go ahead - neither of them had been to NYC before, and the two older ones were visiting from Sweden. I got tickets online at StubHub - something that as far as I know is neither illegal nor uncommon - and printed them out to bring to the theater. When we arrived at the gate, 4 of the tickets scanned OK, but the 5th had a problematic barcode - possibly a download or printing issue. I was given the option to take the kids to the ticket booth to straighten this out, or have the 4 kids go in and take their seats. Because the show was about to start, I opted to let them go in and went to the ticketing office. There I met the Queen Grinch who set out on her mission to ruin the evening for me. I will never forgive her. She kept repeating that 'you got this ticket from a third party vendor, so we are not responsible for it, you need to sort it out with StubHub'. She even kept telling me this after I explained that I had 4 kids in the audience. What a despicable person. She handed me an address slip and told me to go to the Stubhub office. I was so traumatized at this point, that I took the address slip, turned around, and started walking out of the office. Only to realize I could not possibly or responsibly leave 4 kids in the theatre. So I turned around and appealed to this horrid person. She made a big deal about how they were going to see what they could do and kept me waiting. After a while I was handed a pink slip, stating that I had a ticket for the seat I had paid for, with the caveat that if someone can to claim that seat, I had to give it up. Then she told me threateningly 'if someone comes to claim this seat, you need to give it up'. I was so upset, I was about to throw up. The kids loved the show. I really tried hard to make myself focus on enjoying the show, but I just couldn't do it. A beautiful experience trashed. Like squashing a butterfly - just because you can. Solving the issue of scalping and online ticketing hurting theater revenue is not solved by abusing out of town theater visitors. Thanks for reading.",1,,

The play itself was mediocre but that is another review ;) The theater was nicely decorated and I like how they let people in early to be seated instead of waiting outside. They had several guides scanning people in and assisting people to their seats. We sat in the mezzanine and the rows were a bit more cramped than other theaters I been too. The stairs and aisle are also narrow; which when congested made it very easy to fall. The theater wasn't as big as some of the other theaters but the theater is comfy. They had mini stores, bathrooms, and concessions stands on each floor.",1,,

Though I'm a disney nerd so I may be a bit biased. My mind is still blown as to how they made the carpet fly so beautifully! The sets were gorgeous and so were the costumes! I liked how they included ""Proud of Your Boy"", which had been cut from the Disney movie. Also Genie did such a great job. It was amazing. Given the chance, I definitely would watch it again. The theater itself is beautiful. We were sitting in the mezzanine and I had a wonderful view of the stage. The space can get crowded, but it's the same with most broadway theaters. It took a while to head to the bathrooms, but despite the lack of spaciousness they did a great job with the layout..though I'm not interior designer, so I can't say much :pOverall it was a great experience!",3,,

However, Disney has gone out of its way to restore or recreate the fine details of this Theater.As a ""big guy"" and having attended other shows in restored theaters where the seating is geared for the 5 foot and under crowd, I was fortunate to get seats in one of the box seat sections. If you purchase seats through Ticket Master, this would be Box Seat Sections 9, 10, 11 & 12. Yes, its on the sides of the theater, but you have ample leg room similar to the exit rows on airplane.

The wood part of the seat was digging into my calves and there wasn't enough legroom. I'm petite. The ladies next to me were above average in height and had small calves and weren't comfortable either. If the person in front of me shifted her head, I couldn't see half the stage.

My only complaint was that I got told not to climb over a row of seats to get to mine. Now, I hear you- ""But why are you climbing over seats, that's ratchet!"" Yeah, I get it!

While there are many opposing views on the presence of Disney in the New York theatre scene, you cannot deny that this theatre is a class act. The theatre staff are all Disney employees/cast members and treat guests with respect and patience. Something that can not be said about a Shubert, Nederlander or Jujamcyn house.Every detail of the interior has been meticulously restored by Disney after the theatre sat empty and falling apart for years. The final product is breathtaking. When you go you must make extra time to roam the many rooms and lounges. Check out the downstairs lounge between the men's and women's restrooms. Also be sure to look at the details of wall paintings, lighting fixtures and the Art Nouveau style details in the architecture and design...all of which is original to the 1903 construction.SEATING NOTE:The rear mezzanine and rear balcony provides a frustrating view of the stage. The rear mezzanine is so high and under the balcony that the top half of the set is cut off.

It reminded me of being back in the 1950s watching theatre. I really liked that.What I do not like about this theatre is their seating. Their seats are HORRIBLE. There is truly no room at all. I am a skinny female and I am telling you, the seats are cramped. There is no leg room at all. When I wanted to stand up to stretch my legs, even that was hard. Secondly, when someone sits in front of you, they block your view and I did not like that at all. The seats should be a bit higher. I was literally crouching and moving my head around to see the show. The guy sitting behind me had the audacity to tap me to tell me to crouch lower because he couldn't see - well hello I can't see either.Additionally, the bathrooms are very old. This is a theatre - the bathrooms should be a little bit nicer.Overall, the theatre is true to its era, but the seating def. needs to be better.",2,,
125,Roxana G.,"Yonkers, NY",22,91,104,4.0,2/27/2013,The first time I went to this classic Broadway Theater! I was set-up to see a more adventurous off-Broadway production and the last minute I tried my luck at New Amsterdam Theater since I wanted so much to see Mary Poppins before it goes out. We got Balcony tickets... but the view was absolutely perfect! This old theater seem to come out from a story tale itself.  The whole production was excellent.  The only problem I had was with the seats and the leg-room...small and small! Even if we are taller and heavier today than the people at the beginning of the XXth century ...   I saw children and teenagers having a problem with the leg room. The alternative is that we are spoiled today and our mind is conditioned  for comfort!,,,1

The seats, are rather tight and are pretty steep in the upper balcony and mezzanine seats... but that's to allow for everyone to have a great view of the stage. But I would suggest if you have children and elderly individuals, best to get Orchestra seats. There were a lot of people who were having a difficult time navigating their way up and down the steep balcony/mezzanine stairs. The staff is very accommodating and even moved a couple of people to aisle seats because of blocked view and/or elderly individuals dealing with pain from the cramped seating. While the theater leaves a lot to be desired, I think the Broadway of Aladdin is well worth the three hours of cramps, aches and pains that follow!",1,,

The theater has an architecture that allows you to see and hear from every corner of it. I actually paid for seats ""behind the pipe line"" and they were not bad. If you actually purchase these ""behind the pipe line"" tickets but towards the center of the balcony section, there is no pipeline to bother you at all.

It's like the freezer at Costco, the cold room at Burton, and the great outdoors. I think tonight's temperature was 51 degrees. The theater inside must have been in the forties. It was the first time I have ever watched a musical with my long winter coat on and cashmere gloves. Brrrr. I heard about three other people complain. During intermission a bunch even went into the hallway because they thought there was a radiator in there.The New Amsterdam Theater is nice. It's sort of small so even if you are in the Mezzanine you have a good seat. Even if you were at the very top. Also there is an elevator. This was the first time I didn't have to walk up three flights of stairs at a theater.The bathroom was up to date and had plenty of stalls. No wait at all. I just saw Mary Poppins at the New Amsterdam. They did some pretty amazing things in the theater such as having her fly throughout. Yup, the show wasn't limited to the stage.

It's a bit smaller than some of the other ones I've been to like Gershwin but the architecture is beautiful and the ushers' and staff are very nice. It's also very easy to find and a little outside the essential craziness of Times Square. Also quite convenient as it is right next to one of the entrances of the Times Square station. I absolutely loved the design of the balconies on the side. On top of everything else, Aladdin was fantastic and so funny! I recommend both the show and the theatre!",1,1,1
143,DeAdra W.,"Haddonfield, NJ",17,75,1,2.0,9/8/2014,"Won't be spending money or directing anyone I know to shows at this theater anytime soon which is a shame... because Aladdin is currently there and was a really fun show- from what I got... because I paid over $100 to listen to the gentleman behind me and his baby. Yes. Baby. As in this child was so small that he had to be carried in via a baby carrier, he couldn't speak actual words, he had a diaper bag with his belongings, and couldn't entirely sit up by himself. But for whatever reason, that was okay. I understand that Aladdin is based on a Disney movie, but this was by no means a children's show. Regardless, according to the show's site, it's stated that it's recommended for children at least 6. While I understand that that's simply a recommendation, but honestly- had I know that there would be actual babies there, there is no way that I would've spent the money to see something there. Had my boyfriend and I not gotten the tickets as part of a deal (the seats that we were in are actually priced at about $100 each-), I would've demanded a refund. Whenever the baby got remotely noisy (as one would expect an infant to be because you know... that's what babies do-)- which was like every 15 minutes or so, the gentleman would get up with him and walk to the back of the section to quiet him down. So not only is this small child disruptive (by no fault of his own because who the hell expects a baby to be silent for 2 1/2 hours), this guy was being disruptive with the constant up and down. What's worse, is that when I walked to find an usher away from these people with the baby (because I wasn't trying to be rude and at this point, they've paid to be there just like I had-) to find out if this was general practice, I was pretty much brushed off. Listen to me- DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE. If you want Disney, go see the Lion King. And hope that the folks in this show are in something else soon because they are fantastic... it's just a shame to spend that much money on tickets for something like this to spend 2 1/2 hours listening to an infant and dealing with a rude and unapologetic usher who ruined the experience.",3,,
144,V K.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",0,5,0,1.0,2/3/2013,"This is one of the worst theatres I've been to so far. Awful seating. And a total fire hazard. I will most likely NEVER see a show in this theatre again.The one star is only for the lovely staff member who helped us.My mother and I had a mother and daughter date today, and decided to spend our money and our time to see Mary Poppins. We got our TKTS and the best seats they had were the balcony seats. I have never had worse seating. There was absolutely no leg room. Seriously. NO LEG ROOM. All the seats in that area were incredibly cramped. These were such nose-bleed seats that the performers for the show were nothing but moving figures, and the sound system was disappointingly out of date. My mother and I were wondering what would happen if there was a fire. There would be no chance that anyone in the balcony seats would be able to get out. As soon as intermission, we decided to leave and didn't bother to stay for the second act.And then we had the most hardest time to exit as hundreds of people were lining up for snacks or bathrooms, the stairwell were a bit zig zagged and cramped = FIRE HAZARDA lovely ticket person asked if we were satisfied, and we informed her that we were not. She was incredibly helpful and offered to find us the house manager to see if there were any available orchestra seats. But by that point, we were so worn out by this experience, we decided to leave. They should either tear down this theatre and build a new one, or completely forget about ever selling balcony seats. Seriously.",1,,1

152,Linda C.,"Los Gatos, CA",113,294,25,4.0,8/28/2009,"Absolutely beautiful Art Nouveau theatre....one of the best examples of Art Nouveau art I've seen in my life. I spent intermission running from wall to wall to look at carvings, lights, paintings...it is an Art Nouveau lovers dream come true. The theatre was renovated by Disney, who I understand has a 99 year lease of it or something along those lines (I see a lot of people saying they ""own"" it online but I don't think that is quite true from a legal perspective).My only gripe about the theatre is that the seat rows are spaced so closely that you wouldn't be able to get up during the performance to visit the washroom without forcing everyone in your row to stand up. The seats were very tight and uncomfortable for my partner, who is 6'4"" and a well built hockey player. If you're looking to make this a truly special event, or if you have antsy small children, blow a bit of extra coin on one of the spectacular box seats (6 on each side if I recall correctly) so that you have some leg room and the ability to move about.",3,,

Mary Poppins was excellent too, it was a great evening. Before the show started I grabbed a small box of junior mints at the concession stand.

When we arrived to our seats, my boyfriend who is 6'5 could not fit even if they dipped him in Crisco oil. We are a little used to him having issues sometimes with seating so it wasn't much of a big deal. We searched for a manager to be accommodated elsewhere. James, the floor manager ""tried"" to help us but disappeared and the show started and we had to stand in a corner waiting like idiots. Then he comes up to us with two chairs and sat us randomly in a corner directly behind two people. I couldn't see over their heads and was sitting next to a huge pole. To make matters worse I was constantly being shoved by people walking up and down the isle. I normally don't ever complain about things like this but this was completely unacceptable. We were then greeted by this short Mafia looking man dressed in black named Joe. He was apparently the theater Manager. He took my boyfriend to the box office to find other "" dates "" would work for us to see the show again. He kept stressing that it was a sold out show to us.
