I'm addicted to their ""gambas al ajillo""! I lost count of how many times I've come here; either for brunch, HH, or dinner...always on point, always delicious. Everything is consistently good. Also, their happy hour is so underrated! Try it!  Favorite tapas/dishes:-Gambas al ajillo-Pincho de carne-Vieras a la plancha (wow!)-Barcelona Blue Salad-Goat cheese croquettes -Piggyback dates-Patatas bravas-Tostones-Churrasco (plato fuerte)",,,

Her rice as well was not fully cooked.Suggestion: If you want rice don't come here, and as to the restaurant you have such good flavor and such a beautiful display, but take your time making rice it is the key essential to most plates.

4,Chrissy L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",150,10,21,4.0,10/11/2018,"Went here for a Bumble date because we decided to do a brunch. I've been to the One in Washington Heights and noticed this one was close to my house! I figured it'd be a cool spot to go since they don't play super loud music during brunch and you can actually talk to people at your table lol. Super casual and relaxed. I've only had brunch food there and it's always been good. One thing I noticed is that the plates at this location are a few dollars more expensive then the other location, I guess because it's in the city?? Idk, whatever the reason is they should keep the prices the same at both locations. Always go for the unlimited mimosa deal ($13), they have so many different flavors. Trust me, I've had them all lol. Solid chill brunch place!",,,
5,James W.,"New York, NY",165,276,401,1.0,4/21/2018,"Yikes! The $13 bottomless brunch is a joke! Basically, there are three brunch cocktail options to choose from: Mimosa, Sangria, and Bloody Mary. Most people will order a brunch entree ($10-$20) and the $13 90-minute bottomless brunch cocktail, which is a great deal...if there was actual alcohol in the cocktails. Our waitress gave us a pitcher of Mimosa and you could see/taste that there was very little sparkling wine in the Mimosa.We had looked over at the bar and noticed the same waitress pouring a pitcher of Mimosa for another table and basically filled the entire pitcher with orange juice and ""topped"" it off with a little sparkling wine. The ratio of orange juice to alcohol was completely ridiculous. One of our other friends ordered a red sangria and the taste of the sangria was also ""off."" I understand that the business has to make money, but people come to bottomless brunch to have a good time...not to get diabetes and stay sober. The food wasn't good either. Our table ordered the steak and eggs and a calamari. I've never seen fried calamari cut into such small pieces and it was super chewy. As for the steak and eggs, the sunny-side eggs were burnt on the sides. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Not only is the location awful (about a 15 minute walk to the closest train station), but also the food and bottomless brunch special is a total hack!",1,2,

Updated review","I've come here several times but as of lately the food has just gotten better and better. Their Happy Hour isn't bad. They have $6 Margaritas which I love and they come in all flavors. My fave is the peach. Wendy the bartender is pretty cool. The food here is amazing. The churrasco is def a must. You wont regret it. I will def be coming back real soon. Its a nice place to unwind after a  day. Came back on 8/28/2018, Jairo the owner, is so genuinely cool and conversations with him are awesome! Hubs and I hung out by the bar after what happened to be the busiest day of our lives. It was hot and muggy and we both needed a cool refreshing drink. Marcha did it for us and we were not disappointed. I really recommend everyone to come here for after work drinks. The food is amazing. I ordered my usual Churrasco and Hubs had the Pollo Criollo. Holy Moly....Yikes. It was so so good. Cant wait to go back. We conversed with great ppl at the bar and discovered they now have a DJ with different music genres on Sat night. We will def be trying that out. Thanks Jairo, Thanks Marcha! You Rock!!!",,,

9,sarah j.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,7/22/2018,"One of my favorite New York spots! I find in general that new york food can veer far into the pretentious. This place is not pretentious. It serves solid tapas, fabulous and cheap drinks, and has some of the best service ever.

12,Felix S.,"New York, NY",1097,57,29,1.0,4/1/2018,"Very upset. Came from Pennsylvania here to try the paella! Did not eat anything all day in hype to come try this dish. When I arrived it was time to order appetizers, guess what this will be the beginning to this review..May I have some Calamri? - sorry we ran outNext question?Can I order the Paella?- yes..Ten minutes later the server comes out, sorry we don't have any lobster no more. There was nothing the place did to even show their apologies other than a sorry. The place is a small location located on the lower east side but for their signature dishes to be sold out at 6:45pm is uncalled for. I hope management can fix this issue.However end of the day, the paella was still horrible! Tasted like complete metal. Was able to try someone else plate :)Happy Easter and Beware!",,,

Not only did they have a few specialty/craft beers on tap, ALL of the drinks were reasonably priced. fantastically priced even. I am from the East Village, and I don't think I've ever spent so little money, and gotten so many drinks. I would definitely go back again for more fun, and maybe try some food next time!",,,
16,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,5/23/2017,"4.5 stars. So close to 5, but not quite to the level as other tapas joints I've given perfect marks to. Still, Marcha Cocina is a fantastic dinner option if you're willing to venture all the way to Avenue C. Ave C (and Alphabet City in general) actually happens to be one of my very favorite places to spend time. The only issue is convincing others that's it's a good use of *their* time. I think I need more ""down for whatever"" friends. Even better, a whole group of 'em. Marcha Cocina has a fun, social vibe with enough tables to accommodate large parties. Not to mention, the food is pretty affordable as far as tapas restaurants go. Our tab came in at around $80 and we shared five plates and one cocktail each. Came to Marcha Cocina at around 8pm on a Saturday night. The place is a decent size and very high energy (aka loud). We didn't have a reservation but managed to get a table in about three minutes. Like most venues on Ave C, Marcha Cocina would be packed if its was more centrally-located. It always astounds me that people miss out on all of the wonderful things over here simply because it's a bit of a trek. But I benefit from everyone else's laziness, so I shouldn't complain. Anyway, if you are planning to come here with a larger group, though, better to make a reservation. They've got nice, long tables in back but all were taken when we were there.You could easily come to Marcha Cocina for drinks and leave it at that. The cocktail menu is all kinds of yummy and tropical. They're most famous for their Coconut Pineapple Mojitos here, which are as good as advertised. I'm not totally sure how I only had just one. A fabulous summer drink and clearly dangerous. The party of 12 across the way from us clearly was taking advantage of them. If rum isn't your thing, they have plenty of other options, too. I will say though that rum is typically *not* my thing, so this is worth a shot either way. I'm guessing the beverages have something to do with the party atmosphere here. Speaking of, despite the excessive volume, I liked the energy here. Most tapas places I've been to have more of an intimate vibe--or at least more refined/sophisticated as far as atmosphere goes. Marcha Cocina brought me back to my summer in Spain, which is still one of the best trips I've ever taken. So if you can put up with the noise (drinks help!), it's worth it. Food-wise, Marcha Cocina has most of the good classics and some unique dishes as well. A whole section of croquetas (yes please), a bunch of seafood and more chorizo than you could ever want. So I'm sad to say that the friend I was dining with has recently gone pescatarian. It didn't affect our experience too much, though. Most of what we ordered was meat-free and the one dish that featured ham was easily fixable so no harm done. Our eats, below: Gambas al Ajillo (Sauteed shrimp, olive oil, garlic and pepper flakes): A-A traditional dish at any Spanish venue. They tend to come highly recommend no matter where you go, probably because the kitchen works extra hard to ensure that they're up to snuff. These were yummy, but not necessarily better than any other shrimp dishes I've tried. I've had a few Gambas preparations that were fantastic, but most are just average or good in my book. I'm probably missing something. In any case, the flavors were light/simple, served as it should be.Patatas Bravas (potatoes w/ brava aioli): A-Another dish they push here. Again, nothing wildly impressing but I enjoyed them a lot. The reason I went with an A- as opposed to an A was because really, they were just potatoes with aioli slathered all over (see picture). But again, a dish like this doesn't get tampered with much on tapas menus. Definitely a crowd pleaser, and the aioli was fantastic.Hongos Croquette (Mixed wild mushrooms, thyme, rosemary and truffle trumpet aioli): A+Oh man, these were it. I mean just look at the ingredients--hard to mess these up. Croquetas done right are serious flavor bombs, and these, as I said, were ""it"". Mushrooms with great seasoning and herbal flavors coming through due to the thyme/rosemary and then truffle aioli, well, let's just say that those two words juxtaposed is a potent thing.Cangrejo Coca (Flatbread w/ crab meat, goat cheese, Manchego, cilantro, jalapeno, onions): A-I don't typically see flatbreads on tapas menus so this was a nice option. The jalapeno seemed a bit discordant, as did pairing goat cheese with crab, but overall still yummy. Cheese is welcome on most flatbreads so can't fault them there.Vieiras a la Plancha (Seared scallops, spinach, caramelized onions, crispy Serrano ham and Manchego cheese sauce): AGetting this sans ham made a slight difference but I still loved the dish overall. I go hot and cold with scallops so it was a pleasant surprise that I enjoyed these so much. Cooked beautifully, sweet/earthy/rich accompaniments. Service was an A+. Awesome waiter and patient during our long stint of scouring the menu.",10,2,6

The second time I went here my friend same Joe celebrated her moms bday this time i did not eat but I had the tostones with this garlic thing they make there .... see now thats a winner but it still isn't enough food to get me saying like Im coming back for sure.

It was not empty nor super crowded,  it was very chill where you can hear your conversations with your friend and also enjoy the music ( idk about anyone else, but I enjoy a nice sophisticated brunch rather then going to a brunch where it's pretty much a club scene on a Sunday morning) .  The quality of service was superb; wouldn't you love to go to a place where the server knows what he is talking about? YES? This is the place!  I decided to go with the Egg Benedict (recommended by the server) with ham, and my drink for the day was Passion fruit Mimosa. The food is to die for, as an appetizer I had meatballs with bread on the side ( I posted a picture up), OMG that was heaven!  My friend order the French toast and she was bragging of how good they were that I had to try it... she was not lying, the French toast was AMAZING.  Ok, so I tried the meatballs, I tried the egg Benedict and I tried the French toast, good thing I am skinny lol.My drink was the passion fruit mimosa, but I wanted to also try the mango mojito.  Mojitos to me are tricky; I do not think everyone knows how to make a good mojito, but this place new the science behind it.  It was the perfect measurements because it was so good to have!!My overall experience was very congenial, I loved the environment and the friendly staff and most of all the food and drinks are to die for.

It was my girlfriends bday, I called ahead to ask if we could have a bottle of champagne waiting for us at the table, and it was. 5 stars all around especially bacon dates and Allan.",,,1

Plenty to chose from and it is until 8pm. Can't beat that in the city. The food spectacular - def try the Gambas Al Ajillo, croquetas (chicken was my fave) and the steak flatbread. The white sangria was great and they DO NOT put sugar in it ...which i loved. The bartender was super friendly and attentive. Would definitely go back and want to try their brunch!",,,

60,Madison N.,"Saint Louis, MO",208,161,70,4.0,2/29/2016,Yum! They had so many tapas selections with a huge menu full of variety. I was pretty happy with everything I had except some of the items came out lukewarm when they should have been hot. Weird since tapas come on a flow and the place wasnt crowded. Their happy hour is also great ($5 sangria if I remember correctly).,,,
61,Arielle R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,1,5.0,5/5/2017,This place is the best authentic place. Came here on a first date a year ago.

They give you this amazing tasting shot named ""Donkey Sauce,"" upon arrival. I recommend the ""Churrasco"" (Skirt steak) as your main course and my go to drink is the super tasty Sangria! As an appetizer I really enjoyed the ""piggyback dates.""Can't tell you enough about this place, you'd have to come and try it yourself! Tell them James sent you! :-)",,,1

65,Ileana M.,"Cambria Heights, Queens, NY",122,14,0,5.0,3/29/2016,"I am super skeptical about giving Marcha a review to the public, its such a hidden gem I want to keep it to myself. Now, I have come here for drinks a few times; the ambiance is great because its pretty trendy on the inside and there isn't that loud dive scene going on. If Allen is behind the bar you know your drinks will be made to perfection. Last Saturday, I came for brunch with a girlfriend after all other places in the LES were full (I kind of forgot they did brunch or this would have been my first stop). There was no wait and it was 3:30 in the afternoon...prime brunch time. You can pay and additional $15 for bottomless brunch drinks for 1.5 hours with an any entrée; which is around $11-15. Our server was a sweetheart she allowed us to try every flavor of there flavored mimosa. We sat for hours and just chatted, listened to music and were not rushed out. I believe this is what brunch is suppose to be like...not that packed, loud music and people scene. I encourage all to go and enjoy yourself!",,,

What a phenomenal decision. They were friendly from the moment we walked in the door and kindly showed us to our seats. We ordered beers (Ommegang) but the cocktails that people were drinking around us looked awesome as well. We ordered the friend calamari, croquettes, and a paella that was nothing shy of a work of art. Let me step back and say that I'm not generally a huge fan of seafood. Still the calamari came out first and was one of the best things I've ever tasted. The croquettes were amazing and the paella was on point. There was nothing I didn't enjoy and the price was great as well. I know this place is going to be popular once the word gets out. Would recommend.",1,,

81,David G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,78,0,5.0,9/28/2016,"Best  I've ever had!

85,Carlos S.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,1,5.0,7/27/2015,"Yesterday I had the immense pleasure of having a late lunch at Marcha. Let me start off by saying that as soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted and escorted to our table. The establishment itself is elegantly understated and after walking in we felt as if we were at home. If you go, let the bartender make you a refreshing caipirinha, which tasted amazing after walking in from the heat. The menu was amazing but we opted to do a tapas style lunch. The food was sinfully good!! The #foodporn comes to mind after tasting the delicacies that were being brought from the kitchen. My ultimate favorite dishes were the dates wrapped in bacon and sprinkled with blue cheese followed closely by the mushroom croquettes and then the meatballs. OMG! You would think we were stuffed, but the food was light and very satisfying! All in all, I gave Marcha 5 stars but if I could give them more I would. I have to say that the service was AMAZING! We were treated like family which is one of the benefits of eating at this Latin owned business. Our servers were very food savvy and friendly. Did I mention that the food was PHENOMENAL??!!!! I am very much looking forward to going back to Marcha to try their brunch next weekend!!! Buena suerte Marcha!!! I wish you years of continued success! I left a very very very happy customer!",2,,1

After reading great reviews about their Washington Heights restaurant, I was very excited to try their food in their east village location. The food was not what i expected. We ordered the ribeye steak (medium rare) and it was basically bloody raw. We also ordered their calamari and it was cold and unappetizing, their chorizo plate was very salty, the bread was burnt, and the mixed seafood dish was unpalatable. Overall very disappointing and will not be returning. The staff however was very nice and deserts were the only passable dishes of the night.",,1,

The salad was not only amazing, it was huge! The chorizo, delicious. Tried the red and white sangria- they were both great. Really nice waiter/bartender. But really they got their fifth star on behalf of my grandmother- a harsh critic at 85- who insists that it was the best chorizo (and camarones) she ever tasted and that I must come back to buy some as a side to her rice- for thanksgiving!",1,,

Ive visited several restaurant on east village and nothing is like this restaurant. The look is modern, the type of music they play is for everyone. The food hummm hummm hummm. If you go I recommend the albondiga its very tasty also you can try the gambas al ajillo and pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you cannotto Marchaand  not try their paella it takes a little long but its worth the wait.  Marcha also offers excellent service, the crew is young and full of energy.  When you visit east village or you are in the NY area make sure you visit Marcha :O).",1,,
