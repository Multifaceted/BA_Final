0,Rose O.,"Randall Manor, NY",7,28,27,3.0,7/9/2018,"The first picture is my most recent and the second was my last visit. This is 3 is really because of my last vision t because this visit t today would be 1 star. Last time I came the burger was actually very satisfying and service was wonderful that I came again for my lunch break. Today was terrible, I ordered the same burger but it did taste a feel the  same, the texture was grainy almost but the flavor was good. It was just the burger the meat that worried me and if I am sick later I will know why. My burger was NOT medium at all and the person who brought to my table basically tossed it and left. I get it, it's TGIF BUT COME ONE REALLY PEOPLE???? Get it together.",,,
1,Steve K.,"Mineola, NY",0,5,0,1.0,8/10/2018,STAY AWAY. Service horrible:  Waited 1/2 hour food. Expensive:  Food costs twice as much as other restaurants for similar portions. Quality:  Nothing special. Didn't even receive napkin.,,,

4,Mehmet I.,"Yonkers, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/26/2018,"Horrible service, our waiter did not distribute plates and utensils. All he did was leaving in the corner of our table. It took over one hour for our meal to be served. Once we got our meal, the burgers was over cooked instead of the requested medium rare. The Cajun chicken looked stale or as if was left out and reheated. The Cesar salad had no dressing and the lettuce used was stale. I really hope the health dept. shuts this place down.",,,

6,Dwayne P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,0,1.0,10/4/2018,"Floor is sticky.  Bartender was extremely standoffish to other guests as well as myself.  You do not ever respond to a customer by saying ""I don't know I just bartend"".  You(Black female bartender with glasses) could have atleast pointed the customer in the right direction.  I had to leave within five minutes The reviews on here speak for themselves.  Get it together please",1,,
7,Kim R.,"Brighton, MA",5,81,10,1.0,12/29/2017,"SAVE YOURSELF. EAT ANYWHERE ELSE! Came here with my family mostly to get out of the freezing cold temps. I usually never eat anywhere without checking Yelp first. My mistake. Huge mistake. Everything about this experience was horrible. We were seated and promptly brought waters. Started ok. But those waters were never refilled, despite all four of our glasses being empty since before our food even came. After looking through the menu and choosing to order from the special lunch menu, we were told upon ordering that the lunch specials were not in effect that day because of ""the holiday"". It was not a holiday. It was December 27. We saw at least two other tables up and leave because of this. We should have too but it was just too cold outside. So, we ordered. And it took FOREVER for the food to come. So we sat with empty water glasses regretting our decision to try this place. Then it got worse...our food came. 1. The tomato mozzarella ""salad"" was a joke. It was a small plate of cherry tomatoes with a couple globs of cheese tossed in. Edible but hardly a salad. 2. The chicken fingers plate my daughter ordered ended up costing $19.39. FOR CHICKEN FINGERS AND FRIES?! 3. Their white cheddar broccoli soup. DO NOT EAT. OMG. It was completely lacking broccoli and the white cheddar. Just don't. It was terrible. Especially the unmelted (cold) shredded cheese tossed on top. 4. The caesar salad came with 2 croutons. TWO! This was after they brought me the wrong salad (covered in chicken) and then brought me this teeny tiny salad that was supposed to be meal sized not a side salad but whatever. I was not waiting any longer. And they never brought me my breadstick :( I cannot believe a place that serves such disgusting food is still in business. And not just in business - but a thriving chain all over the city. Gross.",4,,
8,Sal P.,"Manhattan, NY",399,8,0,1.0,11/3/2018,"The people who say ""one star is too much to give this place"" aren't lying, this was in fact one of the worst Friday chains I've ever been to in my life. I've had better experience at the trashiest McDonalds in NYC.. the service was terrible.. servers and bussers all sitting texting at tables and even eating in between customer interactions. Server ""Chad"" was an absolute airhead.. he knew nothing about the menu and was inherently untrained. Manager could not even gain control of the group of servers texting. Drinks took 20 minutes .. peach sangria and vodka soda.. really? They tried to serve me cheese sauce for the pretzel sticks in a dirty cup and with little to NO cheese.. I'm still shook a chef sent something like that to a table of paying customers. The bartender refused to add a liquor I wanted into a drink because ""they don't do that here"" yet they had the liquor on hand behind the bar lol.. a very oddly nightmarish experience. Trust me stay away, save the headache and save the money.",,,

My kid is a picky eater so I stuck to places we were familiar with. It took 20mins to take our drink order, and then another 10 for our dinner order. Our server never came back to check on us after our meal until we were clearly ""finished"" with our meal. The Jack Daniels chicken was overly peppered but otherwise okay. Another disappointment during my visit to NYC.",3,,
12,Laura Jimena M.,"Carbondale, CO",65,5,3,1.0,7/14/2018,"I think even 1 star is to much for this place, when we came in they even don't  talk to us, they ignored us completely, the lady that seats you is in the end of the wall and you have to get there without any advice, everyone  gives bad service, looking  at you if they are giving it for free, after we sat we waited for at least 15 minutes  and no waiter and the one that came said they didn't have endless apps even though the sign outside the restaurant clearly stated they had.

Horrible service, food was cold and portions were small compared to the price. It took ten minutes just to have someone even visit our table.

The manager blew me off and stated that if I wanted something else, I'd need to pay for it. Like are you kidding me? He could have just fixed my order.3)My burger was cold and dry.

If you go for a meal, then smack yourself right now. I ordered endless apps & to eat just 2, it took over an hour. Don't waste time on endless apps. It's a ripoff.   Don't get me wrong, the apps are tasty but it takes an eternity to get food here. Aside from happy hour at the bar, I won't be eating here ever again & I've been coming for years. The food service is atrocious.",2,,

24,Mark S.,"WALL STREET, NY",4,149,502,1.0,9/20/2017,"This is the first time I left a review without even a chance to eat the food. I saw the appetizer special on TV and decided how bad could it be. My father use to take us to Fridays when we were kids. My father acted like he was taking us to Lutece; but I remember it to be pretty good. First off, the signage was so small, superman would have to squint to see it. You walk down a hallway that had the esthetics of a new jersey fun house. The place looked like a nursing home cafeteria. The place was not crowded but the bartender didn't wait on us or even acknowledge us for over 15 minutes. We walked out. There was no hostess when we arrived and no one when we left. Shoot this place and put It out of its misery.",2,,

Unfortunately the food wasn't even cooked all of the way through, so we just ended up leaving and paying for the drinks. Very disappointed seeing as this is the only TGI Fridays (they closed the other one on 14th Street and Union Square). Just very disappointing.",2,,

31,Captain R.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,73,35,1.0,12/2/2017,"One of the WORST Friday's franchise restaurant is this location. I was not greeted by no one at the front desk. It took about 10 minutes looking for a waiter and when I found one I was brushed off!! I then was seated by not a waiter but someone working the back of the house. I waited for almost 15 min, nobody showed up. I felt I was treated as a second class citizen. I walked out very pissed. Definelty not coming here again. I went over to Murphy's tavern where I felt at ""home."" Avoid this Friday's location, you've been warned!!",4,1,1
32,Rachel V.,"Houston, TX",18,10,24,1.0,12/18/2017,"Terrible experience. My family and I ate here last week and it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.Our party of 7 was seated upstairs, which was relatively vacant. There was a table right next to us that appeared to be finishing up. It took our server over 5 minutes to greet us and take our drink orders. It took another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive only to see that my husband was given a Bud Light instead of a Budweiser and my 9 year old daughter was given an ice water instead of a cup of hot tea. My brother in law's Budweiser was flat and not near as cold as it should have been. We told our waitress about the incorrect orders and she wouldn't even let me finish my sentence without cutting me off saying ""I got you"". When she brought my husband's Budweiser, she brought the Bud Light back to the table and told us it was on the house. Ummm... we don' drink BL, lady! Jeez.At this point, i was in need of a drink. Even though I knew better, I ordered a margarita, as did my sister in law. Lord know the bartender must have been harvesting the limes because it took forever to get our drinks. Now, we're from Texas- home of the perfect margarita, so I may be a little biased, but COME ON. Terrible. We ordered two appetizers for the table: hot spinach dip and mozz sticks. Honestly at this point, I was not even surprised at the amount of time it took to get them to our table. The chips were stale and the spinach was just clumped on the side of the bowl; it hadn't even been mixed in with the cheese. I mean, at least pretend to be doing your job, y'all. I asked the waitress for new chips (I got you) and much to my amazement, she returned in less that 45 minutes with perfectly hot fresh chips. Tf did she find these chips? Cause the ones that we originally got where rough. Sister in law ordered potato skins. We she got them, they were dry and didn't have chives or ranch, as she specifically requested.Husband got wings; he was NOT impressed and only ate 3 of them. Daughter 1 got a burger and fries. She didn't have any real complaints, but she only ate about 1/3 of it. Daughter 2 got chicken strips. NOT good. I tried one and couldn't finish the rubbery mess that was on her plate. I ordered ribs and a Cesar salad.  Everyone got their food but me. Mine was literally 10 minutes later than everyone else's. And my salad didn't come out; I had to ask for it. When she did bring it, it was wilted and gross. Didn't even take one bite before sending it back. I ate 3 ribs and was over it. Sent those back too. She took my salad (I got you) and when she came back for the ribs, she still had my salad in her hand. This was like 5 minutes later. Why in the world was still carrying it around?? Took way too long to get our bill and get the hell out of there. Ridiculous prices (yes, I know it's NY, but for the service... man. Terrible.).We spent over 2 hours there. Pull it together TGI Fridays.",3,,
33,Jeremy C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,0,2.0,12/16/2017,Should have checked yelp first. Would have avoided a very expensive mistake. Long Island iced tea is $14 with about as much alcohol as a wine cooler. My medium burger was dry and just below burnt. No seasoning on the soggy fries. The only reason they are getting two stars is that the boneless buffalo wings were ok.,2,,1
34,Disappointed C.,"Miami, FL",0,3,0,1.0,12/27/2017,Worst service. They took 1 hr and 15 monto serve my daughter the wrong food and to apologize because they didn't have the soup I ordered. What kind of restaurant takes over an hour to tell you that ....They don't have the food you want,2,,

38,M M.,"New York, NY",2,125,0,2.0,5/25/2018,Yikes. This spot needs some work especially in the service department. Came here for a quick beer and app for happy hour with a friend. Three bartenders on and service was painfully slow. Apps came out looking like they've been sitting in the window too long which is odd because it wasn't very busy and no one else at the lightly busy bar had food. Bartender kept pushing $15 app special and was rather pushy with conversation. Avoid.,1,,1

Upon finding one person which in fact was the waiter he stated he was the only waiter on duty are you kidding me it's Friday night at 7:00 pm and had several tables to service. So eventually my friend and I got tired of waiting and decided to leave. I suggest to run fast TGIF this is very unacceptable, and very unprofessional if you can't afford to hire more staff then you should close down for business I have had better service at Wendy's and Burger King in this area. I will not return.",3,,
41,Allen M.,"Acworth, GA",1,135,1,3.0,7/24/2017,Overall the food is not bad. Tried the new chicken nachos. A slight different take. Not the usual pile of chips covered with cheese and meat. Think of tostada shells each covered with a slight cream cheese and chicken. Not bad at all.Now for the service. The food came out very promptly. Slight confusion when you walk in. No one is there to greet you. Had to walk to the back and ask for a table. Straighten out the dysfunction and I'm sure ratings would improve.,,1,

Lastly, as l was signing the receipt, he was hovering over me to see how much tip l was writing down and had the nerve to chase us as we walk outside to change it!

I did see the terrible reviews and low rating on Yelp before visiting, but I figured how bad can a brownie with a scoop of ice cream be messed up. Answer: VERY! What was served can only be described as microwaved brownie batter with a scoop of melted ice cream. There was absolutely no consistency to the so-called brownie. I ate it reluctantly- because we were there already. It didn't taste bad, per say- just as uncooked cookie batter doesn't taste bad either. But it was definitely was not the way a brownie should be served. So disappointing- I left feeling like I ate chocolate slop :( Please see picture of some remnants of so-called brownie..",4,2,1

Not once did be come by to check on us and to top it all off once we asked for the check i had to get AGAIN to hand him my card to get out of there cus of course we waited another 15 mins to see if he would come and cash us out.

I actually called in my order from a nearby hotel so I wasn't actually served but I do have a small complaint which was accommodated therefore  will return. I placed a large order and it was ready when I got there. I was happy because it was a cold and rainy night. Once I returned to my room I realized that they had not given me the slice of cheese cake I ordered. I called them and they asked that I return so they could give it to me.

We came from the DC area to visit and sight see and this was the closest place where we thought we could get some great food from a recognizable place. We get seated pretty quickly and served, but I knew this place had horrible service after we received the wrong drinks and waiting more than an hour for our food to come out. No one even came over to ask if everything was okay. Once we received our food my mother did not get her order and had to wait another 30 minutes until the server finally came over to ask where her food was, WTF you should know if everyone has gotten their food yet since you took our order. My mom asked to cancel but they said it will be right out. Her food comes out....with the wrong side. She decided not to eat it and was still charged for it.

I asked him about drink specials and was dryly informed they were not corporate and did not participate it's not what he said it's how he said it .

I didn't even return the receipt to her with the tip amount, before I noticed I forgot to use the coupon.  I asked her to please run it again and use the coupon for 15% off.  She returned and told me that the managers said they couldn't use the coupon because I was already checked out.  I wasn't already checked out!  I never signed or gave them the signed receipt back to check me out.  Complete BS!",1,,

Save yourself the agony.  We entered and waited 10+ minutes to be seated. No one ever came, so we found someone and made them seat us. After sitting for another 15-20 minutes without being acknowledged, we asked for a server. A few minutes later someone appeared to take our order, only to disappear again for what seemed like forever. Eventually the food came. Water was never refilled, and at this point I needed booze to calm my nerves, but getting drinks was as difficult as ordering food. The food seemed okay at the time, but we were both sick with food poisoning for days to come. This is not surprising, as we witnessed employees and the manager walking in and out of the kitchen, shoving food into their mouths.  If you're thinking maybe we went on an off day and it was just busy, think again. We got this treatment at an off peak time, it wasn't busy and there appeared to be plenty of staff.

67,Sarah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,3.0,11/21/2017,"The dismal atmosphere of the Wall Street Friday's was too much for even me. And I am one to revel in the grotesque. But, if I want to experience palpable misery it better not be in a chain restaurant, goddamnit. I left the suburbs for a reason. I paid what I thought was a really unfair and arbitrary amount of money for one whiskey ginger: $11.38 or something, which you can understand is infuriating, since one of the best things about bars is that they charge even amounts and disregard change. We were waiting for Lilah to show up, whom I was meeting for the first time. Lilah has the tendency to remind you of Penny Lane from ""Almost Famous"" in both aesthetics and personality. She has this enigmatic mischief about her and a harshly layered haircut like a long lost member of The Runaways. She wears a long coat: monochromatic gold embroidered patterns with faux fur on the sleeves and collar. The white fur looked more like gray, and the jacket had an overall weathered look, but it was still markedly glamorous. While we waited for Lilah I sipped my drink the way one drinks when they have no intention of buying another, but also have the intention of sitting at the bar for a considerably lengthy amount of time. My friend- I'll call him Tim- sat unabashedly with a glass of tap water in front of him. He looked at me somberly. ""Lilah moonlights as a prostitite"" he exhaled and paused dramatically, waiting for some kind of reaction I wasn't going to give him. ""Ok"" I said and stared blankly back at him. In my head I thought maybe she can give me some insight because at the time prostitution seemed like a good alternative to restaurant work. Tim had a habit of making subtle, calculated comments to get a rise out of me that would result in talking myself into a corner of frustration. I could tell the prostitution comment was a set up for one of these attempts, but he must've misjudged my feelings about prostitution. He would always remain quite stoic during these probings, and would deny any malintent if I ever suggested it, which both infuriated and intrigued me because I'm not used to people causing me to question the superiority of my own intellect.",1,,

She also got my side wrong even though my best friend and I were the only people there ordering anything. The food was mediocre also.

I asked if he could ask the chef and he answered ""no it can't be made that way"". When I insisted that he ask, he walked down and spoke to someone who he said was the manager but looked to me like the host. He then returned and said that it could not be made without dairy. I then ordered a turkey burger and everyone in my party received their meals about 30 minutes later and I did not get a meal. The person who delivered the meal says that there was not another meal for the table. The waiter then came to apologize stating that he forgot to put it in and it would be ""one minute, no five"". He had an annoying smirk on his face as if it was funny. My food came out about seven minutes later and was uncooked. No manager came to speak to me. The manager was sitting eating lunch when the waiter went to speak to her only after I told him I no longer wanted the food and she motioned him away. I did not eat while my entire party ate.

Many patrons had walked out in disappointment. We were hella patient coz hey, we were tired and hungry. Our lovely waitress reassured us but she was mad as hell at the kitchen staff. Apparently the cooks were super slow on that night. I'm confused, how does a restaurant in the heart of NYC have slow kitchen service on a seemingly average night. Oh my! The waitress made sure the manager came to our table. He was unbothered and said he'd give us a discount. That was his 'perfect solution'.The food came... it was good but not worth the drama. We called back the manager tried to sort it out. He was like 'ok, you can have free dessert'. We accepted and yes, we gave the lovely, feisty waitress a pretty amazing tip!

Nobody came, even tried to wave down somebody but still nothing. As we were getting ready to leave the bartender comes by and ask us ""has anyone help you yet?"" Seriously dude?! Worst service ever. I don't understand how this place is even open for business with all the bad reviews.",2,1,
102,david s.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,14,0,1.0,3/28/2017,"just finished lunch there and I will NEVER go back. it was supposed to be a quick stop after having some meeting downtown. I ordered soup, waited about 15 minutes. about 20 minutes later my wife's appetizer came out and was cold. I told the waiter/bartender who told me it was just cold on the top. I handed it to him and suggested he do it again and could I get my lunch order. The ribs I ordered were over done. no silverware, I got that myself. service was s-l-o-w. I heard others complaining. Finally I got my check. I got up from my table to the bar to pay it. Despite being a) large and b) the only one standing at the bar I still had to yell to get his attention to PAY. As he was processing my bill a waitress comes and asks him for change. He stops and walks over to her. I suggested he do one thing at a time. This waiter is clearly overworked. As I was leaving I saw the manager sitting down eating. While managers get to eat, I would hope they would lend a hand in getting their customers taken care of first. As I started to explain what when wrong, he shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. this is quite possibly one of the worst run restaurants I have ever been to.DON'T GO. Walk a few blocks up the street for FAR BETTER options. can you give less than a one star? I should have.",1,,

114,Ms.Meowshki B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,20,2.0,1/20/2016,"Well this was interesting.  I was in the area and really craving some buffalo wings.  Unfortunately I wasn't on time for the happy hour app special so I settled for a dinner entree.Before coming in I checked this location out on Yelp, and I didn't have high hopes but at least I knew what I was getting myself into.  This place really is 1 star but because my server Raven was attentive I just bumped it up to 2.Let me begin.... Came in and there were about 3 parties ahead of me.   All just standing around.  I was told that the wait would be 15min (I was by myself) and was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar.  There were 4 free booths and 3 tables available.  I asked if I can just sit at a booth instead.  I was told no.  I wasn't surprised since other yelpers had similar complaints about free tables and long waits.  I decided to wait and was Seated within 10 minutes-  so I was happy.  I ordered the half rack of ribs w seasoned fries and a soda.  The seasoned fries which came out just barely warm was nothing to rave about-  nothing too seasoned about them, and the portion was what I would describe as ""just enough"".  I politely ask for replacement fries which were a huge portion of fresh and hot fries.  I didn't wait too long for them and was able to enjoy them with my meal.   Although I did enjoy my ribs i didn't find them really really hot which makes me wonder how long were they sitting around for.  On my way out,  I went into the second floor women's restroom which is like a shoebox with 2 tiny bathroom stalls.  I swear it must have been initially meant as a one person bathroom that they decided to renovate into a 2 stall bathroom.  It also smelled terrible in there.   There was no bag hook on the door and I certainly was not gong to put my bag on the floor.   Since the stall walls & door were literally In my face I couldn't help but noticed how dirty they were!  Like gross dirty!  When was the last time they wiped them down?  Never probably!  Completely filthy and I did not want to even imagine what the filth was all about. Also, the lid on the garbage can was filthy and you can see the filth caked on to the lid.  Really unacceptable if you ask me!  They looked like garbage lids straight out of a nightclub/dive bar. And as I left,  I was reminded as to why the service at this place sux. I literally watched (and heard) 2 guys walk into this place,  ask to be seated at one of the booths by the bar and was escorted right over.  Bye!",1,,

Don't get me wrong, i venture out into Manhattan all the time, but i sure was hosed at this particular TGI Friday's and it's my fault for not doing my homework! I had a $100 gift certificate that was good for any 7 Friday's locations in Manhattan and this was the one I chose to go to with the thought that it's farther away from midtown and would be less crowded. I was 100% correct about the crowding, as the place was at 10% capacity at 8:20pm on a Saturday night. At first my friends and I were so happy because it was a quick seat and all, then we opened the menus.$22 for a salad...A SALAD!Everything started to make sense at that one moment, i understood we were in the financial district and it's ""dead"" at night on the weekends, but it is the absolutely insane pricing that keeps this place empty!The prices they charge at this location should be illegal. No specials available, no stripes reward card accepted, $45 gratuity enforced for a party of 6 and $310 bucks total for two apps and 6 entrees. I could have went to Keens Steakhouse and spent similar money! My food was OK, then again i only got the basic chicken fingers and fries so it's hard to mess that up. The pick 3 sampler was OK too with potato skins, fried mozzarella and boneless buffalo wings. Our waiter was in a rush but didn't make any mistakes, except for forgetting to take our main course order after our apps came and then telling us at 8:55pm ""we close at 10, do you want anything else?""He made no sense, and nothing else at this place does either. 2 stars because we were seated promptly and the food was OK, otherwise i will never step foot in this location again unless it's an absolute emergency!",2,,

We order sirloin steak, sizzling chicken, and chicken/shrimp pasta. None of us finished our food. My steak was small and not 10oz, it was tasteless even after putting lots of pepper on it. The chicken was rubbery and must of been frozen for a long time. The waiter grabbed the tip while we were still sitting and started counting it before we even left. She never cracked a smile and seem like she was in a rush. Overall this was the worst tgif I have been too. Will never be back and not recommended to anyone.",1,1,

We got colder and colder as we sat there. I watched several other customers pull their scarves and jackets up around their ears and neck trying to get warm. Eventually I went to the bathroom to try to warm up with the hand dryer. This is ridiculous, people!As for the food, I think I've rating it one star more than it deserves. I went for Chicken Tenders and Fries. Fries were soggy and barely warm. Chicken Tenders were dry. My three companions all were unimpressed with their meals also. One ordered a burger well-done, and got it medium-rare. He tried to eat it, but eventually had to send it back. To the waitress's credit, she removed it from the bill.The Guinness I ordered tasted like it was poured from a Macca's post-mix coke dispenser; thin and watery.

129,Pattie B.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,7/22/2016,"Worst Friday's in the history of all Friday's locations.  Arrived at 12:40 pm, seated ourselves, was told a server would be right over, 20 minutes later we ordered. They would not give us the complimentary chips w salsa nor did they want to honor the July Deals card that I presented. I asked for a manager. When the manager came over she explained that they are a franchise and do not have to honor or go by any of the Friday's rules - shocking. In any event she told me that she would allow me to use the coupon this time but if I used the coupon I could not get the chips w salsa. I should have walked out right there but we ordered. Took 45 minutes to serve a Friday's Shrimp and a Sizzling Chicken w Cheese - unacceptable. Also they ""ran out of straws"", the table next to us was the last table to receive straws. Really? This is a damn shame that it is in a prime location and is run poorly.  Mgmt was no where on site and had to be called out of the kitchen. Although nice enough she really didn't care if we ate there or not. After looking around at the other diners, many of them were looking for their servers or their food. One table with 2 people behind us waited so long that they just left the establishment. I work in the area and have been to plenty of Fridays and this truly is the worst Fridays that I have ever been to. The waiter that we had could not even understand the menu and had a hard time writing down our order and apparently had never been familiarized with the ""stripes"" cards because when I presented it he did not know what it was and had to ask the manager. Also, for a prime location where every restaurant in the area is packed, this Fridays was no where near half way full ~ tells you a lot about the management. Totally disappointed and would like to see something done to rectify such a bad experience. For verification purposes: I was at Table 46, Party of 2, Total Bill $32.37 with tip totaled $40.00, the number at the top of my receipt is 0132.",1,,

If I hadn't forgotten my iPhone which contains my beloved Yelp app, this unfortunate meal tragedy would have never occurred. *kicking myself*After my experience here, I'd like to recommend two things. First, Yelp, please consolidate all of the crappy one and two star reviews of this same location from everyone else into one profile so we can truly assess the sheer magnitude of just how awful this place really is. And two... I propose we hereby change the name of this place from TGIF Friday's to TGI GFY. As in TGI Go F#%K YOURSELF! This place ruined all TGI Friday's to follow and I doubt I will ever be eating at this chain again now.I've had better microwave dinners than this (no wonder why TGI Friday's has a line of these which I will now boycott thank you very much) at a fraction of the price. Hell... I'll bet cat food kicks the crap out of any of the dishes served here. I'm even willing to wager that NASA astronauts are eating way better than this up in space, Tang and all. In fact, while we're on the subject of dehydrated food... I'm quite sure that my dish was one of those ""pour hot water over it and voila"" meals. How dare them trying to pass this nuked disaster off as actual cooked over a hot stove restaurant food! And it still doesn't explain why it took so friggin' long. Chef Boyar-shitty in the back must have slacking! To add insult to injury they charge over $15 for this rubbish? You've got to be kidding me... really?Whatever you do... DO NOT order the Chicken with Shrimp Cajun Pasta at all costs. It sounds good in theory and looks great in the pics on the menu but in reality, the chicken in the dish was overcooked and did not seem very fresh and the shrimp looked like baby shrimp that had been frozen back when Walt Disney died, quite possibly in the same freezer. My first impressions of the cryogenically frozen shrimp I was subjected to here was not good. These shrimps were gray and nasty and definitely not the color shrimp are supposed to be; the sauce was bland as hell and I needed half a shaker of salt to make it somewhat edible. This is coming from someone who makes it a point to never add salt. By the way TGI GFY, my stomach/metabolism called and it wants those 1300 calories tacked back on to my day without my having to become a bulimic because that was the lowest grade food my taste buds have ever had the misfortune of coming across and it's not fair to put that many calories in something that isn't even good. Brownie sundaes maybe... Your Cajun Chicken with Shrimp Pasta, not so much!!One star for the cotton candy cosmo drink but only because they brought me a whole extra shaker of it. Kudos to the mixologist that came up with this one but even drunk off my ass, the food here would never be good and the service couldn't have been worse if I had brought in a $9.99 coupon and asked the waiter if the coupon included his tip with a straight face.Moral of the story: Do not forget your smart phone loaded with the Yelp app before dining!",30,30,22

This place is *expensive.* Holy hell... its more expensive than the Time Square Applebees. If you're planning to get full, be prepared to drop 35 bucks. And unlike many other overpriced restaurants in FiDi, TGIF doesn't make it up with grandeur, service, or any shallow for-shows. It really just straight up sucks. I can tell you about how drinks took 10-15 minutes to come or how the steak was too salty, but I was too busy trying to forget about the experience and my tab.If you're a tourist and you see that FiDi has become a ghost town at night and can't seem to find a casual restaurant, try Stone Street.

The food does not take to long to be served. But one time I was short on time and the waitress kindly asked me if I would like to take it to go and wrapped it up for me to take to work with me. Their appetizers are good, I like it. Not a fan of their wine though. I see there are a lot of bad reviews for this Friday's on here, it's believable. But the service is better now. The location is perfect the food is okay. I think the food could be better..Getting seated usually happens very quickly.

She seemed way more content with the male foreigners a couple seats down.We both ordered the cotton candy cosmo drink (i forget the actual name). I had mentioned that I had been craving cotton candy all day so she said she would bring extra over. I got all excited but to my dismay, it never came. My friend asked for water and she never got it. She asked again and got it ten minutes later. Now people please keep in mind that there were maybe three tables sat and a solid total of five people at the bar so it's not like this lady had a lot on her plate.Now here's the best part.. We asked for the cup of dirt dessert and she said they didn't sell it anymore. Okay, so why is it on the menu? Then we ordered the warm apple dessert. Oh sorry we are out of that. We have been for the past couple weeks. REALLY? Then we finally ordered the brownie dessert. 20 minutes later she tells us that the kitchen didn't prep the icecream so they had to go downstairs to get it. REALLY? Were we the only people to order dessert that day? And I mean come on, its not like you have to make ice cream. Just scoop it, geez.She told us 'don't worry i'll hook you up.' I thought this meant we werent going to have to pay for this disaster. Instead, she brings out two and charged us for one. Now this would have been a nice gesture and all but we had just said that we wanted to split something cuz we had eaten so much earlier. Also, I couldn't actually tell you where my brownie was. It was more of a brownie and icecream soup. If I were her I wouldnt even bring it out.Before we left we went to the ladies room. I practically wanted to vomit what I just attempted to eat because the bathrooms were THAT awful. Smelly, damp, broken everything, trash everywhere and clearly unsanitary.",2,1,

I flagged the guy down for food and waited 35min for the ribs. Flagged the guy down for a refill and lastly for the check. They suck big time, I can't say every server, but most are just walking around bumping into each other.Crazy stupid dumb prices. Check out the ribs photo. Math majors- why does a full rack entree cost more than double the half rack. I said more than double. You can get two half racks, and double everything else for a dollar less than getting a full. Think about that. This place is awful and the food quality? Puppy chow.",,1,

151,Mike O.,"Manhattan, NY",53,141,20,2.0,8/15/2012,"A few weeks ago, I gave the Friday's at Penn Station a solid four Stars. This one? Not so much. I saw the reviews on yelp prior, but did not believe it. They gave us a mix of weekday menus along with weekend menus which had a 20 percent price increase while we scratched our heads in confusion for 5 minutes.The southwest burger was definitely the driest burger I have ever had at Friday's, and was a chore to eat. I noticed that they don't even ask you how you want your burger.Drink was far inferior to the one at Penn Station as well. Are there no standards that are held across locations?  Friday's, please correct these flaws.Cheers",1,1,
152,Ashley T.,"Toronto, Canada",2,15,2,1.0,2/19/2013,"This place was disgraceful. After a busy morning touring downtown Manhattan, I wound up at this TGI Fridays with my dad and my fiancé because there really weren't many lunch options in the financial district. I'd grown up with Fridays restaurants in other cities and had never had a bad experience, so I was relieved when we found this place, thinking it would be a reliable option where we could all find something we liked. Boy, was I wrong!We waited awhile to be seated, then even longer to get menus, and drinks took forever to arrive at our table. It was more than an hour before we got our main meals. Our server, Cynthia, couldn't have cared less about her job or her customers. We asked several times for various things, more drinks, extra cutlery, etc, and none of our requests were ever fulfilled. We ended up stealing a cutlery set from another table, and when that table was seated, they took cutlery from a third table, etc. When the food finally arrived (I believe we waited about 75 minutes from the time we ordered it), it was awful. The bun on my dad's sandwich was stale, and the bun on my fiancé's burger was toasted to within an inch of it's life to try and hide the staleness (unsuccessfully). Both meals were inedible. My chicken fingers were only okay (and it usually doesn't take much to impress me), and the fries were cold. When the bill came, it was wrong. We never received the side salad we had ordered. We waited another 20 minutes for that to be corrected. There were only two working stalls in the dumpy women's bathroom, which is inexcusable for a 250-seat restaurant.Overall, a horrifying experience. Won't be back to this Fridays location or any other any time soon.",1,,

Here is a list of all of the negatives I've spotted in this restaurant. 1. There was no host at the door to seat us. 2. There was always a waitress running. 3. There is no price list on the drinks. Ginger ale came out to be 4 bucks. 4. The service was horrible, waited 40 minutes for food, two sandwiches that I could have made at home in under ten minutes. 20 for drinks. 5. I witnessed a waiter steal chips from a customers table when they went to use the restroom. 6. The food was over saturated in the sauce. Serious sogginess warning. 7. They were out of menus. Positives1.The decor was classic and set a good mood. 2. Plenty of seating. 3. If you order water it comes in 3 minutes. Obviously this place seems horrible to eat at. Not coming here again. The only reason I did not protest was because I had a lot to talk about with my wife. So the time went by quicker than usual.

157,Roman H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,101,0,3.0,3/16/2014,"Went there for a mid-week lunch.

158,Sanna S.,"New York, NY",0,5,4,1.0,11/10/2014,"This was by far the worst dining experience of my life! I don't even know where to start. The service sucked, the restaurant was almost empty but it took forever for the watered down drinks to arrive. Did I mention that the poor excuse of a fluorescent colored margarita was over 12 bucks? And that there are no prices in the menu so you'll never know how screwed you are before the bill arrives, because the waitress doesn't know the prices and promises to get back to you, but never does? And then also forgets to bring the water, the beer AND the appetizer. And also, once the app arrives half way through the meal, it's the wrong app! It's like candid camera!The ""chicken wings"" were so salty that I couldn't stomach more than one piece, and I'm 100% sure they we're nuked in the micro. They probably don't even have a real kitchen and just warms frozen tgi dishes in the microwave. Oh, and the best part... The food is totally over priced! I have never been pissed of at a restaurant before but this experience was so nasty that I refused to pay the full bill and the manager - who soon realized that even though we spoke a foreign language with our friends - weren't tourists. He didn't even argue when I refused to pay for this crap they call food. This is a tourist trap and a poor excuse for a restaurant. I've never eaten at a TGI before since I usually steer away from chain restaurants, but I'm not a foodie snob! Like most people I just know the difference between edible and non-edible food. Don't bring your hard earned cash to this place. The only positive thing coming out of this gnarly experience is that I will NEVER go to a resturant before checking the yelp reviews before! And if this is the standard for TGI-restaurants, I will steer clear from them forever.",1,,

You have to go down in the basement to get to the restaurant and it's always dark and gloomy. Second, the service here is just awful. The waitress tried to tell me that my license was expired, and I told her to look again, and she said ""Oh nevermind. I'm sorry."" Absolutely retarded. Then I ordered a Strawberry Daiquiri, which was the WORST I've ever had in my entire life. I wanted to leave right then and there but I didn't. I stayed and ate dinner with my boyfriend and the prices are so expensive for so little. One time, I waited so long for a table and waitresses kept passing me by, (some of them were sitting down eating looking at me), and then I just left and went some where else. I'm talking really bad service here. Overall, my boyfriend told me we are never going here again, and I agreed.

So I've tried to place lunch or dinner orders here on probably 6 different occasions, but their cc machine is always down and they can't accept phone orders, so you have to physically go there to order and wait for the food, which I don't have time to do when I'm at work. So today, I bit the bullet and walked down there. First off, it's in a basement. There's hardly any tables, it's just one of those shady places you feel uncomfortable walking into but hey, it's Friday's, right? So we walk in with a large order to go for the whole office. Their menu is different than the one online and the bartender has no idea what's online, so I had to call the office and have everybody find something new. The bartender kept telling us to look at the price, and I said it's okay its fine just put it in. When I saw that one burger was $20, I said ""wow"".  The bartender turned around and said ""Why don't you go across the St from ground zero, there's a burger king there"".  Obviously after the rude comment, I got up to leave and took my $400 order with me, but I was so mad I had to warn everybody else to stay away from this shady basement ""restaurant"" AND it's terrible, rude service!!!!",,1,
174,Erin C.,"Moorestown, NJ",137,555,89,1.0,7/6/2008,"Needed food post-River to River 4th of July show, found: TGI Fridays. Okay, fine, inhale crappy chain food, continue with epic adventuring. That was the plan. A few details stopped us up. First of all, the calorie listing for each and every item on Friday's menu. Or wait, we were seated at a table near the bar because there was nowhere else for two to sit. The place was packed with people that make you feel terrible for the second thought that brought you in against your better judgment. And the calorie count. The back of food packaging bases its nutrition information on 2,000 calorie diets. Dailyplate.com gives you a calorie limit somewhere in the 1,000s depending on how much weight you want to lose or maintain and how fast. So it is probably a legal issue more than a sort of courtesy that compelled Friday's to list the 1,000+ calorie content next to each option. Kill me now. While calorie counts there are aplenty, prices are another issue altogether. This was 4th of July and a raspberry cherry margarita was on order, hesitantly so at least. There were no prices written in the goddam menu. Didn't know til the hyper-sugary cesspool was sadly in my stomach that it was $12.42, and although the waiter brought the nachoes (which were okay $14) and the ""rita"" to the table, my friend had to approach the bar even to order and then to get silverware and then to Get The Bill and then to Pay The Bill. When seated at a table that gets wait service, someone is supposed to span the two and half yard between from the bar with the bill. And we tipped, but whom exactly did we tip? Who knows; they didn't deserve it. Our experience was one step short of cooking the food ourselves, and we could've done that for less calories and less money.",2,,

There was no menu posted at the outside but again there was no indication of what awaited youinside.This was a ""cellar"", with tables and chairs and various commerical decoration. The menu was like a who's who"" of generic food . Because we were desperate we ordered one beer , one seltzer and (2) fried mozzarella appetizers ;which had six each. The bill was a whopping $46.00. I was shocked. That would equate to $2.00 per stick. I was so angry I wrote a letter to the corporate center complaining about the high prices. One could eat at a much nicer restaurant for 1/2 the price . The letter which was thier response glossed over the complaint and said they hope on my next visit my experience would be better.

186,Moises M.,"New York, NY",243,7,3,1.0,11/16/2015,"i've been sporadically coming to this location after work for about 8 years now. today me and 8 co-workers decided to have lunch there at about 12pm and had the worse experience ever!!!! the spinach dip did not look like what i usually would order when i would come in the evenings. when i bought it to the managers attention, she seemed to have an attitude and kept insisting that they always make it the exact same way. this was not true at all! today the spinach dominated the whole plate and i am used to it being creamier not just at tgif, but anywhere i've ordered a spinach dip. the shredded cheese wasn't even melted and the spinach what large pieces. out of 9 people 7 complained about their food, and are now worried of possible food poisoning, as some items came out cold from the kitchen. it was very early and only abt 2 other tables were occupied, so we couldn't understand how the food came out cold from the kitchen. the food had no flavor and items had to be substituted because they were out of stock. they do not participate in any of lunch specials that are emailed to me online and they do not accept tgif stripes. i honestly feel that this location should not be apart of the tgif food chain. it is a poor reputation of a brand they we used to get excited about. now i am wondering will i ever return!!??",1,,
187,Victoria B.,"Mahopac, NY",0,10,0,1.0,8/8/2014,Please do not go into this restaurant. The staff is scary. And they put things like vodka in your drink illegally. They are infamous for spiking your drink. I would stay out of that place. They have a bad reputation that they need to clean up.,1,1,
188,m t.,"Barrington, IL",0,38,0,1.0,10/30/2012,"We were seated opstairs and then the wait began. Our waitress did not even come to the able to offer us menu/water. Finally, we got up and left. It wasn't because the places was understaffed. In fact, there were three or four waitresses chatting nearby. When we were leaving they had the nerve to ask: ""Is everything alright?""  This location gives the TGIF brand a bad name.",1,,
189,Jermaine A.,"Manhattan, NY",629,51,2,1.0,1/27/2012,Why the fuck would anyone with self respect enter TGIF. Food = Shit and Service = Shit. It should be called Thank God I'm Not Here lol,2,2,1
190,Christina B.,"Lake Mary, FL",5,6,1,1.0,5/6/2013,"The service sucked!! Yonathan (yes, with a ""Y"") was the worst server I've ever had and the food was mediocre at best. The bartender actually broke a glass in the ice bin, too. Just awful. Not worth the time or money.",,,
191,Thane P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",220,27,2,1.0,4/8/2013,Filthy. Food all over the dirty worn carpet. Service was less than desirable,,,
192,The Fuzzies S.,"San Jose, CA",381,136,136,1.0,9/7/2011,"Erin F., the bartender : smh. why? here are the reasons:-diluted alcoholic beverages; trust me, i know since i was a bartender-when i took the ice out  and placed on the melt mat (for bar tending) to prevent even more dilution, she said, ""i could'a strained that for you""; swiped the ice with her hands from the dirty melt mat and didn't even wash her hands after! (gross, I'm now a registered nurse, and that is unsanitary)-since we sat at the bar, we wanted to watch the US Open, especially since it was here, in NY. It was not on because, according to Erin F., there was ""bad signal from the rain."" She stated that she will check again if the channel worked, but never checked. And honestly, how was it, that all other channels were working? It's not like they had antennas, the US Open was being shown on cable and I'm sure every other sports bar had the US Open tennis matches on...International visitors came to NYC to watch these games, and in this one restaurant, there was bad signal? (questioning her integrity) -got my food order wrong, i ordered the Mediterranean skewers and she gave me the Hamachi skewers. -when i told her, she demonstrated her ego by whipping out the menu, curtly responding ""look, the Mediterranean comes with this, which you got..."". So i responded, this sauce is hoisin sauce. Hoisin sauce goes with hamachi, not with Mediterranean food. I'm supposed to get mine with Greek yogurt. She goes, ""oh"" and walks away...-Got our bill wrong; it was happy hour and were supposed to get all our happy hour drinks and appetizers half off, but she never took it offWonderful, Erin F. (sarcasm) It's okay to make a bazillion mistakes, but you definitely need to be served some humble pie before you can serve others.Oh, and the food - I had to order broccoli to cut all the grease.  'Nuff said.",7,2,1
193,Zach P.,"New York, NY",0,237,2517,2.0,2/7/2013,"Typical TGI Friday's. Went here for Super Bowl Sunday thought I would packed, most defiantly wasn't. Paid about $20 for a mediocre meal. I could have gotten a way better one for the same price had I just gone uptown.",,,
194,Dhruti P.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,1.0,5/25/2014,The service really really sucks here....it took them 25 mins just to us our drinks....we canceled our order and when to pizza place next door....the pizza was really good !,1,,
195,Amber R.,"Nashville, TN",20,42,1,1.0,12/19/2011,"Horrible service and outrageous prices. They got my order wrong and charged me an arm and a leg for a salad. This place definitely ruined my already low opinion of TGIF's. I doubt I will attend another one, and definitely not this one.",2,,
196,Jozann B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,39,3,1.0,8/8/2013,"This place sucks!  Where is the zero star rating?  My sons hamburger was NOT KIDDING ice cold we waited so long for the food and it must have been just sitting and sitting.  I ordered a flatbread and it was undercooked, doughy and so heavy with cheese that when we picked it up....a slab of cheese slid back on the plate and the dough broke apart on the plate.  The manager said ""I don't know what's going on in the kitchen today, I just got here and it's like the third compliant about the food today.""  It was terrible.  Dark, cramped, service was slow....waitress acted like she'd never worked there before today....ugh would have just walked out if the children weren't so tired and hungry....won't go again...maybe not even to another one within the chain it was so bad!",3,1,
197,DK B.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,46,5,1.0,7/8/2009,First let me say - I hate the slop that TGIF calls  food.  The only reason I go is because the old lady likes it.  Seems everything I've ever ordered sounds so much better tasting on the menu than the slop they put in front of you.  TGIF  = This Garbage Is Food?,3,4,1
198,Tasha M.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",1,5,0,1.0,12/29/2013,"I don't normally put up reviews but this weekend was a mess and to start it off was TGI FRIDAYS!!!!!! This place is low key can't even notice it if your not looking for it. I wish I didnt find it!!! Horrible. Waited forever to get an appetizer, then when it came it was horrible ( nachos) who goes wrong with nachos??? This place does!!! I should have left after that. But we decided to stay because we already put in our meal order. I got lobster with salmon.... 3 pieces of tiny lobster pieces on top of salmon. Who goes wrong with salmon?? This place does!!! Yuck yuck yuck!!  The chicken....dry... I can go on and on. I thought it was just us but the table across from us experienced the same yucky food!!!",2,,
199,Restaurant R.,"Camp Hill, PA",0,30,6,3.0,5/27/2014,"Stopped in before going up town to get the train and overall, considering the location, it was decent. We ordered drinks (soda and beer) and were given to us quickly.  Carpet and surroundings were dingy and dirty. Looked like it needed a good remodel and update. We got a steak/shrimp-cooked the way we ordered, and got the half ribs and vegetables. The ribs were dry and looked well over cooked but we prefer them dryer. Veggies tasted fresh and good. Refills were given on soda quickly. For two meals (ribs, steak, shrimp, a soda and one beer) the bill was $50",1,,
