0,Emily M.,"New York, NY",127,93,138,4.0,10/29/2018,"Panera is a go-to comfort food for me so I guess I'm lucky we don't have any uptown. I visited this location on 10/28/2018 and enjoyed my experience for what it was. I was able to order at the kiosk, which is always my preference since I like to customize my orders and compare prices before making a decision. However, they did not have anyone replacing the little buzzers (there was a stack by the counter I saw once I went over to the take out section) so I had to put in a random number and notify the staff. He was friendly enough about it and I was still able to sit down and wait for my food. I ordered the Quinoa Mediterranean Salad and bowl of Tomato Soup with french bread. The salad was larger than I expected and had all my customization correct. I visited around 5pm and there was only one seat available. This place is packed so be aware! They seem understaffed for dinner rush so just be ready to snag a table and wipe it down yourself or you'll be out of luck.A Panera is a Panera is a Panera as far as price goes. $12 for a slightly upgraded You Pick Two and that's plenty of food for me. The vegetables tasted fresh and the soup was almost hot enough. The salad seemed bigger than other locations and the side french baguette was DEFINITELY bigger. Yum!PROS: Quick service. Portions are decent. Prices are decent. Good comfort/consistent food. CONS: Not enough seating. Long lines for the bathrooms. Not really a con, but it is just another fast casual place when you can eat at so many awesome local joints.",3,3,2
1,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1116,19810,2.0,8/25/2018,"Listen to Yelp Friend Jim! Unbelievable that there is one person at the counter three of us in line and the place was empty on a Saturday morning!  Nearby a manager was at a register. Later I saw what appeared to be another manager walking around. No one jumped in to assist with customers or ask how we were.  The girl taking my order did the best she could. This place is rigidly operated unlike what I'm accustomed to in other locations. Finally I decided on a flat Sprouted Grain Bagel, Bacon, American Cheese with Basil Pesto Sauce. I had a $2 off coupon for a breakfast sandwich so it came to $3.80 total. The sandwich was delicious. I earned my final visit to get a reward. I have  a free cookie coming to me. My receipt says 5 visits to my next reward. I thought it was 10 previously. So that's nice. The cook hollered for me during preparation of my sandwich. He questioned no egg. I said definitely no egg. I asked if it was Cheddar Cheese. He said I could have American if I preferred. He added I need to specify in an abrupt tone. I said I wasn't given options when I ordered. I sat back down to wait for him to prepare. Once again I got a holler from the kitchen. It appears they don't bring your food to the table as they don't have enough employees. They're getting two stars. One for cleanliness and one for the delicious breakfast sandwich. Other than that I did not feel welcomed or comfortable. The electric plug had a cover over it and WiFi doesn't connect. I walked FOUR miles this morning for exercise. I'm here and I'm going to enjoy Union Square. I don't recommend this Panera Location if you're in the neighborhood. Go somewhere else if you want customer service in a welcoming friendly atmosphere!",43,21,29
2,Emanuel C.,"New York, NY",551,141,305,3.0,8/20/2018,"I love going to Panera. It is a no fuss place to get simple enough pastries, charge my phone if I'm low and dont have my battery pack (As I didn't last night) and to have small creative meetings with peers in a nice setting. However, in NY, I'm not so sure these (much like Starbucks) are holding their own. Aside from huge corporate marketshare, in terms of quality and personality.There are so many Cafe's and bakeries with extremely high quality products, it is slowly becoming hard to justify spending money here at a chain bakery. Still.  I do enjoy their breads, I love their bagels, and their rapid pick-up options which I use from my phone. Especially, ordering food for my peers or my staff if they are already at a location. I just need the table number and from my phone I can order food, snacks, drinks for them before I arrive. I also tend to love their Chicken Alfredo. Granted it is nothing compared to any number of Italian restaurants in the city, but useful and decently portioned and priced if I am sitting and meeting with someone late in the evening. That's the other thing I enjoy. They tend to be open late. I get a ton of freebies from Panera, which is something that keeps me coming back. The coffee is lackluster. It is simple and run of the mill. But will get you going. So I've never been happy about their pricing. Their teas are a bit better. But still a general sugary facade will greet you to mask general blends. Overall they are great places for a number of options but I prefer the smaller artisan cafe's. This location had great counter staff but needed to work on cleanliness as the place was a mess. The bathrooms were also in shambles. An absolute disgusting mess. I would still rather walk in here than the Starbucks next door.",1,,
3,Jessica K.,"Queens, NY",131,134,252,1.0,7/5/2018,"One star isn't for Panera, it's for Panera Union Square. I went to grab lunch at my usual Panera on 23rd Street, only to see a sign tacked up that they closed that location. The next closest is the Union Square branch. Should have known better due to my experience at other food establishments in the area, but I was really craving my Green Goddess salad You Pick 2 deal. I used the fast order kiosk as I do in all Panera locations. I customize my sandwiches and salads due to personal taste preference and have never had an issue in all the years of me using the kiosk. My salad I asked for *NO bacon, *Extra dressing. My salad comes with bacon, and no extra dressing.My sandwich was just a complete shit show. Mind you, I've ordered this sandwich countless times. NEVER in my life have I received such a disgusting looking meal. It looks like someone chewed up my sandwich, and spit it back out on the bread. My side of bread was just thrown in the bag like an afterthought, and was so stale and hard. Thanks for absolutely NOTHING Union Square. The place wasn't even busy. 23rd used to be an absolute zoo and they never disrespected customers and food quality to this degree. On top of receiving such a disgusting meal, prices seem higher here. Stay away from this location and go to literally any other one. They just don't care here.",2,,

Afterwards we waited for our name to be called, but after waiting for a while without hearing my name I just got up and checked. It was sitting there the whole time, they just never called my name. It was also all packed up in to go boxes. We never indicated we wanted it to go. Perhaps they were trying to throw out hints since they were closing soon.",1,1,1

8,Bernice N.,"NY, NY",132,185,1190,4.0,7/3/2018,"Now I heard about panera bread, about the same time I started getting into Starbucks coffee, (many years ago), but just never really check the place out because, I thought it was all about bread. Well forward to June when my job had an end of the year celebration that was cater by Panera. I had this salad that left an inpression on me, that had me feeling like ok, im gonna stop in one day. Well today was that day. The place was clean, had plenty seating areas, they even bring you your food if you decided to sit and stay. My cashier, Aerial was very patience with me, because for it being my first time there, I had no idea what was the way they do things here. I saw that they had express ordering thru an tablet, I saw you could wait and order thru a cashier, and I saw that after you order you stand in an area while someone calls your name and you pick up your order, kind of like Shake Shack, but a little less chaotic. You pick half a salad with a sandwich or soup, or soup and sandwich. I really just wanted the salad I had from work. Aerial who was pleasnant and professional told me I get either free chips or an apple with my salad. Of course I choose an apple for my Fuji Apple salad.So overall, I was happy, not so much with the price though, 8 bucks for a small salad, but its America where everything is over rated and cost an arm/leg. I know for facts it will be awhile before I buy here again, I got to get my money up first ;)",3,,2

12,Sophia G.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",52,40,54,5.0,8/27/2018,"I was never a Panera girl. But after coming here with my friends, I changed my mind! The best part about the place was the workers. SUPER chill, cheery, bright, and welcoming. They make jokes, laugh, and have a great time serving the customers. The place was clean, and there is ample seating for everyone! Also, I added a bunch of free toppings to my Mediterranean Sandwich. Even though it was only a half, because of all the toppings I was full by the end.

13,Meg R.,"Orinda, CA",4,17,1,2.0,8/14/2018,"I try to keep my reviews on the positive side, but I have to be honest to feel good about my life.I frequent this Panera Bread given its close proximity to my office. It's weird. I keep going to this Panera Bread even though my experience is consistently bad, which is something I need to take responsibility for, I know.Today while standing in line among the frustrated masses waiting for their orders, I realized that the last time I ate here I experienced severe stomach spasms due to some old pesto on my tomato mozzarella flat bread. ""Hey, maybe it was just an off day,"" I reasoned. As I stood in line, I watched the kitchen staff break into a fight about miscommunication concerning orders. Then the flashbacks began flooding in of all the past fights I've witnessed in the Panera Bread kitchen. Just FYI: In this Panera, be prepared to fight for your order during pickup. This is usually a confusing process where various names are called and the wrong people grab for the wrong order and for some reason, patrons and staff alike switch into survival mode during the order pick-up process. This is a high stress zone, folks. If you work in a high stress environment and your lunch is the one opportunity to relax, know that you will not find it in the Panera Pickup Zone.I opened my order to find this salad. This is the asian chicken salad, hold the chicken. See attached pic. Full disclosure, a small container of Chinese chicken salad dressing was provided. There's also no where to sit and long lines for the bathroom.I decided today to not return and be okay with this decision. They do have really good bread there though. . .If you like bread.",,,

If you desperately need a bathroom, you could sneak in here, but do NOT ask to use it; (they'll make you BUY something..), just confidently walk in the place and head towards the back and pretend you are looking for your friend who's supposedly sitting at a table. I was trying to sneak a few puffs on my electronic cigarette one day, and the manager caught me and was not very happy with me. I had no receipt for a purchase, and he almost threw me out.

I'm pretty chill, I've worked in food service and I know it can be very stressful but what I experienced was completely inappropriate. I had grabbed lunched around 215 and I peacefully sat and ate my lunch. I finished and then after I finished I proceeded to begin to do some work since the restaurant wasn't very busy. Less than an hour after I arrived the manager, or who I assume was the manager, came up to my table and essentially shouted at me that they were in the middle of the dinner rush (at 3pm? K gurl), that I had been ""taking up space for hours"" and that I needed to leave immediately. He then turned to another employee and said for her to call the cops if I didn't ""move my fat ass"" to call the cops. This is absolutely unacceptable and I believe there was a personal reason why the manager asked me to leave, as soon as I got up three people who appeared to be close with him took my table and he sat with them.",2,1,

Many previous reviewers mention the problem with it being super crowded to the point where you cannot find a seat. It seems like management has tried to solve this issue by only serving the food in takeout boxes which I hate because the portion sizes (especially the salad) is considerably smaller. The checkout kiosks also do not have the pagers for you to sit down and eat your food. However, I did ask the cashier to dine in and the food was served on a plate and I was given a pager, even though I had to go pick it up instead of it being served to me. I wouldn't have a problem with this if I didn't think that my seat would be taken if I got up on the rare occasion that I actually found a seat. I also think that many of the employees are very rude, ESPECIALLY the cashiers. Customer service is really not a thing here. They just want you to take your food and get out. The food is a hit or miss. They are very stingy with their ingredients especially in the sandwiches that have chicken or avocado. They vary in size every time I get them but typically are served on small sizes of bread. I wouldn't mind but these sandwiches are not all that cheap. They raised their prices too.",,,

I brought this to her attention and requested a refund (she charged me an extra $). Here's what went wrong/a tip you can take away:1. It took over five minutes to correct the issue - the cashier wasn't pressing her manager to resolve this quickly 2. The cashier said under her breath that ""it's just a dollar more"" (what she charged for the wrong order). If this is Panera's mistake, why should the customer pay more than he/she should?3.

I ordered the turkey sausage, egg whites and spinach breakfast sandwich and was relatively happy with what I got.  I was expecting a turkey patty so when I saw that it was a pile of ground turkey in the middle of the egg white I was a little surprised but it was tasty nonetheless. The only downside was that there was cheese on it and the menu did not specify that it came with cheese. While I don't hate cheese, I just did not choose to have it at that moment and having to scrape it off was more work than I had intended or preferred to do.  All in all, the experience was good and next time I'm in the area and need to get a quick bite to eat this probably will be one of the places that I'll consider.",,,

I only ever get either the cheddar and broccoli soup and or the Mac and cheese. Usually, I'll get both the Mac and cheese and the cheddar and broccoli soup. I'd assume that's two meals even if you're paying for it together. My boyfriend asked the manager that calls out the names on the side if he could get another bread. He asked my boyfriend ""why?"" & my boyfriend said because we have a soup and Mac and cheese. The manager then was kind of rude and said ""well you have to tell the cashier you want another bread and pay for it"". So... I'm suppose to eat one bread with both my soup and Mac and cheese? What if the other order was for someone else. It just didn't make sense. They gave us the bread, but with a side of attitude. The food is lit, but that policy is bogus.

He demanded to see my receipt. Then he waited a bit and didn't give it back. Then the guy who took my order came back with it and demanded that he actually ordered something else.

No complaints about the food. I always get to go orders, usually for dinner since my fiancee can pick it up on the way home. Last week even thought we'd just ordered like a few days before, it was a less than pleasant evening. 1. We always same order 2 soups, 2 sandwiches, 2 apples, we always have to ask for an extra bread even though that should be just a given.. 2. They wanted us to exchange an apple for a bread, I was caught off guard because the apple is a side to the sandwich and the bread comes as a side to the soup 3. After going back and forth for about 10 mins, they just gave it to us. Now after all of this, I was upset so I wrote their customer service about it and they basically were telling me that each item comes with a side, so why was damn near harassed to exchange one? While I love Panera and spend at least $100 here every 2 weeks, (after 3x you basically spend $100) I think I'll go somewhere else. This may sound whiny but it's just bread, you're going to throw it out at the end of the day anyway. There is always an issue, whether they have an item, whether my fiancee can redeem the reward or why is there no clean tables. 3 stars, food is Panera quality.

My next best bet is to call in to this location and find out the best way to rectify the issue. At the end of the day money was spent, and I don't have my product.

It was the best. Now I usually stick with the Asian Sesame salad or the BBQ Chicken salad. I'm not sure if it is because this location is always crowded but they package everything to-go.

And you can finish your meal with an apple. So healthy!Another combo we got was the shrimp caesar salad and turkey cranberry flatbread. The salad, supposedly half-sized, was huge. I also forgot to ask for dressing on the side. But that was fine, the dressing wasn't overwhelming. The salad was fresh and shrimp were quite big and yummy. The only item that didn't impress me very much was the Turkey cranberry flatbread sandwich- I mean the taste was fine there was just too little filling.

I think I broke a sweat waiting for my beverage and I did not make my train. As I'm rushing I spill some Chai on my leg and to my shock and horror, it was lukewarm. Why would you make me wait an eternity to give me warm latte? I feel like the girl from scream queens--maybe I should've specified to how many degrees I would like my latte heated. I didn't drink it.

This is my first ever review but I had to do it to warn people. DO NOT COME HERE!!As soon I as I walked into the restaurant the smell of burnt food permeated the air. (That should have told me turn back). However, I planned to meet up with my friend for dinner around 7 but she was running late. So I found a table for us and starting reading to pass the time. Not 15 minutes later, a short gruff man (Nick the manager) stomps up to me and rudely states that I will have to vacate the area because I haven't bought anything. I try to explain that I will be buying something shortly because I am waiting on a friend and so he rolls his and rudely reminds me that even though I will be buying something I will have 45 minutes total to be at the table. He leaves and my friend calls me lost (New to New York lol). So as I am on the phone trying to instruct her how to get to the Panera (no more than 5 minutes) he returns and orders me to leave the table. I try to calmly say I was just about to order but he ignored me and rudely told e that ""I couldn't abuse the system"" and that I can ""sit all day in Starbucks"" (Next door). Now I understand that the store is busy and had every intention of buying food. However I did not appreciate how rude this MANAGER was being. He clearly did not value customer service. AND when I asked for a customer service hotline to report my dissatisfaction. He told me he did not know and told me to ""go find it"" somewhere in the store. The possibly most upsetting thing was the way he spoke to me. I noticed his interaction with another white customer who had been there for 45 minutes without buying anything and while it was assertive it was also much more polite. I am from the South and have not experienced such race related rudeness. So do not come in here if you would like customer service or a staff that isn't racist.

Add on only two people taking orders and a line of 15-20 waiting to order and it was pain in the worst way.So we went with a kids salad, kids grilled cheese, almond chicken salad sandwich and tortellini alfredo.The kids' grilled cheese could best be described as a shit load of bread with some cheese put in as an afterthought.   The kids' salad came drenched in their oil & vinegar dressing that I asked for on the side. The chicken salad sandwich was decent and the tortellini was clearly done by ""Chef Mike"" as certain parts were hot, others luke warm and others cold.All this and a fifteen plus minute wait for the food at a price of more than $10 dollars a person.  Let me up, I've had enough!On a kind note, if I had to pick out some good things to say about this Panera it would be that it had lights, offered legible POS receipts, had bitchin' A/C and surprisingly there was plenty of dirty seating as most people were taking their orders to go.I suppose I get why people like this place but by-in-large I'm not in that tax bracket so I think I'll happily go back to my Panera abstaining ways.",,1,

The food here is pretty consistent in quality and quantity to every other Panera I've ever been to, and it's relatively clean for a location that seemed so busy.The kitchen, however, seems to be really slow. It took me 15 minutes to get my take out order of one soup, and there was quite a line by the pickup booth. For-here orders were left on the counter, piling up until there wasn't any more table space and getting cold while the waitstaff scrambled to bring orders to everyone. Not sure if they're always so short staffed, but they definitely didn't seem to handle rush hour too well the few times I've been here.

The staff in the evening is very careless when it comes to your order and good delivery experiences are few and far between with UberRush. I wish that the day folks would school the night people so that there could be some consistency. It is always very frustrating to order dinner and the food looks sloppily put together. I will say though, everytime that I have called and complained to a manager in the evening, I've gotten excellent treatment. But I shouldn't have to complain! It should be right the first time. Tonight's visit prompted this review because I ordered Rapid Pick Up online, got there 15min after it was supposed to be ready and it wasn't, it was just sitting on the counter and I had to go and ask for it. My flatbread sandwich was sloppily thrown together and had way too much of the ingredients, which only sucks because I am paying close attention to what I am eating. *I tend not to try to eat inside unless it's a non-busy time because finding seating is impossible.

I got my order to go and the kale was not even visible upon first glance - however when I went to check if they gave me the wrong salad they acted like I should have known that it was a mix of both. for the couple extra bucks I was paying, you'd think it would be all kale but whatever. the panini was great as it pretty much always is, but my last recommendation is to always eat in the store when you can. from my experiences they always give you more food and it's much better prepared than the to go stuff. still wishing that panera was as good as it used to be, but it's definitely a better option than some chain quick service restaurants.",,2,

Updated review","I did not enjoy my experience. I was at Panera Bread for about an hour and was forced to leave by the manager even after I told him I will order more food. I understand that there is seating time limit and that it would be best to create more seating for new customers, but just because newer customers come in, does that not make me a customer anymore? That's not right. I love Panera Bread, but I am discouraged from coming back here. Update: I went to eat here again with a friend who was craving Panera Bread while we were in the area. I am absolutely horrified to have been met with the same disrespectful treatment from a manager. The staff are nice, the managers aren't. This time, one manager yelled at me when he came out from the bathroom for knocking. I was not the one knocking I just happened to be the first waiting in line. Smh. The person who knocked let him know it was not me, yet I did not get any apology whatsoever for that behavior.",,,
128,Oscar R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,5/16/2017,"Kirby, the manager is the rudest, most hostile individual in customer service I have ever encountered.  I bought the self-serve green tea this morning, as I do most mornings.  It tasted like it had cleaning chemicals in it, and 1/2 hour after drinking a few sips I felt nauseous and had a burning sensation in my throat and on my tongue.  I'm a doctor and work at the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Phillips Ambulatory Care Center located directly above this Panera location.  I don't make claims of poisoning or illness frivolously.  I let manager Kirby know that I had bought the green tea from the self-serve machine, which was nearly empty. I also let him know that I suspected that they had attempted to clean the machine (as it was nearly empty), and hadn't rinsed it, leaving chemicals in the small amount of green tea remaining.  All I expected was an apology and a replacement.  Instead, Kirby became defensive and belligerent, challenged me to take the tea to a lab and have it analyzed, and embarrassed me in front of other customers. I am contacting the corporate offices, and the New York City Department of Health and Hygiene, and The New York City Better Business Bureau. Panera Bread has no business allowing someone like Kirby to work in food service.By the way, this location had the following NYC Dept of Health & Hygiene sanitary violations on its most recent inspection of 4/24/17:1) Eggs found dirty/cracked; liquid, frozen or powdered eggs not pasteurized.2) Non-food contact surface improperly constructed.

It's ridiculously small but it's creamy and is good enough to satisfy those minor mac n' cheese cravings everyone should have. The breakfast rolls are usually just heated up. They aren't really freshly made. This particular branch has a lot of seating but I feel the whole place could use a little bit of a renovation especially since its right in Union Square.,,,

This location next to Union Square is fairly new and spotless, though from my experience, all locations are pretty spotless. Last time I went I got a half soup and sandwich ($11-12ish) with a seasonal pressed turkey and cranberry sandwich and a hearty chicken and dumpling soup. It was perfect.

However, this past week,  I went during off hours (10:30 a.m.) and it took way too long for me to get a cup of soup! There were at least 10 people waiting around the counter to pick up their food.But the worst transgression of all was that there was an employee in the food prep area who was biting her nails the entire time I was waiting for my meal! It was so unappetizing, I had to try hard not to gag. Like, I'm not exaggerating, she was gnawing at her fingers. To be fair to her, I didn't see her handle any food. However, she probably should have been! She literally was standing around doing nothing while there was a line of people waiting for their food.  Finally, when my food was done, another lady put it into a bag and haphazardly slammed it down on the counter. It's a bag with hot soup lady! Be careful! She didn't even bother calling out my name.  Just in general, everyone behind the counter looked so miserable and unhappy to be there.

149,Mary Jane C.,"New York, NY",205,59,32,1.0,8/25/2014,"I try to avoid most food chains since I do live in New York City--home of a gazillion cuisines, but once in awhile, I crave Panera Bread. Here, at the Union Square location, the employees here are not on par with Panera Bread's standards, and I know this since I worked in Panera Bread back in college. I understand it's in a crowded and touristy area, so it gets busy. They've got the cleaning down in the common areas and the food preparation timeliness, but there's something wrong behind the counters with customer service and food quality.I've been here three different times, and each time, I'm disappointed. I've clearly been spoiled by the consistent  good quality of food and customer service at any Panera Bread I've been to in Alabama, California, Georgia and Florida.I always order the Pick 2 combo--sandwich/panini and soup. Every single time, they never fill my soup bowl all the way. I'm not saying fill it to where it's overflowing, but don't fill only 2/3 of my bowl where there's a huge gap roomy enough for more. One of the three times, they only filled HALF of my bowl. That's like giving me half of a cookie when I paid for a whole cookie. On top of that, I always have to warm up my soup in the microwave when I just got the soup.As for the panini, it wasn't quite a panini. Two out of three times, my bread wasn't completely toasted and inside wasn't warm (as in the cheese in my chipotle chicken and Frontega chicken didn't get melty like it's supposed to.)Also, they screwed up my friend's strawberry smoothie. They put too much yogurt and too little ice and strawberry mix. It tasted like they just dumped plain strawberry yogurt in there with a little bit of ice. McDonald's makes better strawberry smoothies than that.On top of all that, the cashiers always seem like they don't want to talk to you (the dining room cleaners were nice though), which they probably don't, but it would be greatly appreciated if they pretended like they did.So, in essence, I recommend going to another location if you're craving Panera Bread or just eating elsewhere, like at Patty's Taco Truck on 15th Street and Union Square West.

The interior was very blah and not inviting it was also very confusing and deceiving as you walk in and have to continue walking back where the space opens into a fairly large dining area.While you're waiting for your food you have to stand in this middle area if you're getting your food to go that just makes you kind of feel like you're in the way. They have computer monitors that have timers for your orders and I assume are supposed to give you insight as to when your food will be ready but after intently studying them I could not figure out why these were useful or exactly how they were working.The food- salty and rich. Very typical panera bread, the baguette was delicious as per usual and the french onion soup, although my favorite soup they serve was salty and hard to choke down the entire thing. Their chicken caesar salad is always pretty reliable and good but would never been my first choice for lunch.",,,1

Ordering online was quite easy and you could even select the time you wanted it to be ready. Since I didn't want my food until later, this was perfect. When I arrived at the place, there was a shelf with a few online orders. I was directed to mine and all I had to do was pick up the bag. Easy enough. Unfortunately, the area didn't have a warming lamp or anything to keep the food warm. Luckily, I got a soup, which cools slower, and mine was fine to eat. I got the edamame soba bowl and it wasn't bad at all. I got it for half off with the coupon, but would not spend $10 for the full price. The amount was just too small and not worth it. The seating in the place was quite nice. Lots of tables and plenty of spots for someone eating solo. Nobody came and bothered me while I was eating either.

While I was ordering,  the cashier wandered off. Okay, I thought maybe she was new and needed guidance from a co-worker. Whatever.  When she came back, I asked if she remembered or if I should start again.  She asked me to start again so I repeated myself and she said now she remembered.  Great. I take my milk from the cooler, which is warm, but it's vacuum packed so I don't worry about it. Then I sit and wait for my sandwich.  It's a long time before my order arrives. Almost 15 minutes for a PBJ.The bread is very thick and it's actually half a sandwich but I figure it's a kiddy portion. However, when I open it up to peek inside, there are the barest smears of peanut butter and jelly. No exaggeration,  the opacity was about 10%. So I took it back and said I'd like my peanut butter and jelly to be more than a molecule thick. They made me a new sandwich with proper amounts of filling. So it took a total of 30 minutes for an acceptable half-sandwich.  Doubt I'll return to this location.  Too slow and not done right without complaining. If they don't know how to make a PBJ, that doesn't instill much confidence.",1,,

Aggressively asked by another panera employee if I were alone and willing to share my table because it was so crowded (obviously was willing but not sure why they need to aggressively be monitoring tables when people are more than capable of asking someone that question themselves).

Comes out five minutes later with one small slice of avocado... small bits of chicken scattered all over... two slices of bacon... embarrassing Panera. To top it off, I went and asked for a few more slices of avocado - the lady behind the counter gives me lip about how they gave me the right amount and tells me I should ask/pay for extra avocado if I want it, loudly 'harrumphs' and then slaps a quarter of a whole avocado on my try.

Why do I say this...well if you often read my reviews on here you probably realize by now that I am a harsh critic, I like what I like and if something isn't to my liking, the person or place responsible will realize it one way or another...and the same goes if I do like something. Also if you read my reviews often you will or have realized already that I like sandwiches from various places. Other than the typical Philly Cheesesteak that I will get from my favorite Cheesestake spot in Lower East Side ""Philly's""...one of my favorite sandwich spots has always been Quiznos, but of course it so happens that there are not as many Quizno's in NYC...or in the country for that matter as there used to be cause for whatever reason they are just not beating their sandwich spot competition like that. So, in getting to the point...it has been awhile since I've had a very good, IMPRESSIVE standard sandwich in NYC and especially one that even came close to beating that of Quizno's. Went to Panera Bread a few days ago and have been anticipating trying this place for about a year now. Impressed succeeded! Heavily surprised at how good Panera Bread is and added to that...they did what no other sandwich spot has been able to do or fulfill and that is beating my taste of good sandwiches in that of Quizno's...I had the Steak and cheese Asiago sandwich from here with kettle chips...WOW! Everything you can imagine from a great sandwich, a nice blend of meat and lettuce and tomato and the bread...my Gawd, the bread is just so nicely toasted and flavored, you would think you're eating at a gourmet restaurant but hence the value of the sandwich and mind you I got a large...was ONLY about $8...the size wasn't over the top but it did't need to be. Everything about the meal was very well proportioned and the chips were good as well...What is keeping Panera from a 5 star though...their workers, at least at this specific location show little enthusiasm and looked plentiful annoyed with their jobs. Now I say this in various reviews cause I see this a lot at restaurants and just places of service in general with service employee's having the annoyed, frowned look on their faces, I can understand the frustration at times having to deal with customers and having to try to put a smile on your face especially when it is close to quitting time...just please do not give me attitude if I am not giving you attitude. I know how it is to be frustrated at a job where you probably aren't getting paid you're worth and the demands on you from higher ups are annoying and probably aren't being followed by the person handing them down themselves but please...do not pass that off to a customer who is just trying to get their food/service and just wanting to move it along.

I was also was going to order another pastry, when I told him that he said you can get it and go. Which was very rude, and I was like he can't serious this can't be real. But as I looked around he did that to few other African Americans/ethnic people and and bypassed Caucasian which shocked me. There was a couple of people who were Caucasian that was there sitting before I ordered and still was there but he addressed me? Didn't say anything to them I was racial discriminated against because of the color of my skin. This problem needs to be addressed or I will be seeking legal advice from my lawyer and also get other people on the form who felt discriminated against to join in and sue the company.",1,,

Unacceptable customer experience in my opinion,,,
173,Megan M.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",284,66,5,3.0,7/19/2013,"Panera Bread in Union Square is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat for under $10. However, this location needs some customer service training. I stepped up to the register to place my order and the cashier rudely snapped at me saying, "" Your order better be to go, because we are closing soon."" Um, they were closing in 45 minutes and I was planning on taking it to go anyhow. Rude attitude was not necessary. Just after placing my order, a homeless lady approached the counter and started screaming about how another customer had pushed her so she deserved a free meal from Panera. She was so upset that a cop on his lunch break had to console her. I grabbed my food and was happy to get out of there.",1,1,1
174,Laurie F.,"New York, NY",14,41,1,2.0,5/21/2014,"I work around the corner, so I've been here a few times. The Thai Chicken Salad? Solid move. Chicken Noodle Soup? Sure. But damn I wish I had checked these reviews today, because apparently I got the same thing as a reviewer did yesterday (Turkey Avocado BLT on Sourdough) and it was PITIFUL. The little bit of turkey that was on it reminded me of Perdue Shortcuts pre-cooked chicken that you'd buy in the supermarket. It was DRENCHED in mayo on both sides. There was a skimpy piece of avocado that was barely perceptible. The people working were busy, which I understand and I hope that's why they all seemed like they couldn't be bothered, but the quality of the food coming out on plates didn't look so great either. So, one star for the decent food I've had previously, and one star for the very nice person that took my order (Kathy). But, Panera, for over $10 (what my order cost) I could have easily went to Au Bon Pain, Pret A Manger, Hale & Hearty, Cosi, or almost any deli (ALL in the area!) and got a better sandwich. Please realize how much competition you have in the area and step it up.",,,
175,Whitney K.,"Cambria Heights, NY",24,4,5,1.0,12/4/2015,"I love Panera Bread so this pains me to write this review. This location is HORRIBLE. Literally EVERY TIME I do a ""Rapid Pick Up"", my order is either wrong or something is missing or BOTH. For example, I placed an order on December 1st for 6 items. 1 item was missing and another item was made completely wrong. I can understand if you verbally give a complicated order, but an online order??? Come on man. There is every opportunity to double check if the order was made correctly, ESPECIALLY if it's made for pick up WELL IN ADVANCE!On top of the Rapid Pick Up sucking, the employees are disrespectful and don't know how to conduct themselves in a professional manner. For example: today, I went to purchase breakfast and a treat for my kids at work, a gentleman placed an order and it was ready around the back. They called his name out but he didn't hear because he had on headphones. He walked over the the pick up station and looked at his receipt. One of the workers asked him a question, but again, he didn't hear. Then she said, ""give me your receipt"". She took it, looked and said, ""this is yours"" and handed it to him. The other worker next to her said (loudly), ""what? he couldn't hear you??"" and the worker replied (with an attitude, ""clearly not"". Another example: One worker asked her manager if another worker was coming in. The manager replied yes and the worker was like, ""Oh..well she good. She got an attitude. But sh*t, we all have attitudes, right?"" Like seriously? Maybe I'm just being petty but this is annoying. No other Panera Bread is like this. Or at least I haven't experienced one like this. Smh. Get it together Union Square",,,
176,Job M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,28,0,4.0,8/10/2014,"I went for the first time to Panera Bread at Union Square. As I walked in I noticed this restaurant has a large number of tables and chairs for seating. Much more than the Starbucks which is next door and Le Pan Quotedien also next door.And just about all of the tables were being used by people dinning at 2pm on a Thursday. I ordered a turkey avocado panini with bacon and a diet Pepsi . ALl for $12 came with a bag of potato chips . Since no seats were available I ate it in union square park across the street. Where people at the restaurant coffee shop pay top dollar to overlook union square park.Panera Bread is a big thumbs up. My sandwich had actual turkey meat. And it tasted great. UNfortunately I could only easily find the calories on line , I am not sure if it is posted in the restaurant. I was certainly surprised to find very good food, reasonably healthy at a very fair price. I should not have eaten the potato chips since the sandwich was around 800 calories.",,,
177,Davie C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/30/2016,"This is only me second experience with Panera but after this I won't come back. I had previously had a friend be followed around by security, and the same guard was in my face doing the same. The girl who took my order seemed annoyed I was there and I didn't know what was on the panini. She even seemed annoyed when I gave her a tip. The guy that was handing off food didn't call my name or order and merely sat it to the side. This is not what he did for the young women before me. The only person that gave any semblance of customer service was a red haired young lady that wasn't even on duty.  All all, these multiple levels of failures at basic customer service, microaggressions and feelings of discrimination mean that I will never suggest this location to anyone that wants a pleasant meal.",,,
178,Charles T.,"New York, NY",0,20,0,2.0,10/21/2015,"Crowded, not enough seating and sort of ""school cafeteria"" in the vibe at the counter.  I've never been the huge fan of Panera that some of my friends are (in my opinion ""artisan bread"" shouldn't necessarily be a synonym for ""break your teeth hard""), but they do have good soups.  Maybe this location is hampered by the fact that it is the only one in all of Manhattan (or if there is another I don't know where it is), but last time I was there, the tables weren't clean and there is always someone needing to get in the bathroom who can't because of a lost receipt.  Not the  rustic, relaxing place I think it is meant to be.",,,

I am not one to complain either, so this is upsetting. I got there around 6:15 and I wanted to get dinner and leave asap. The girl who took my order was a bit rude and she charged me MORE instead of the regular 7.99 my pick 2. I didn't notice until I was on the train that she overcharged me. I felt rushed, even though there weren't many people behind me. When I was waiting to get my meal, the girl who was making the food rudely asked me to move out of the way and stay away from the serving table. I didn't register what she was saying at first because the girl didn't even look at me when she said it. When I got my food, I ran out the door without even checking if everything was what I hard ordered.I specifically asked for NO chicken in my salad and I was happy to see a chicken-less apple Fiji salad. However, what blew my mind was that as I start eating my meal, I realized that the soup is not the Corn Chowder that I ordered but the Chicken Soup (I am a vegetarian, so you can imagine how displeased I was).I do enjoy Panera, so I probably will be back but I hope the experience is better the second time around.",1,,

The cashiers are extremely slow, and there are NEVER enough of them, yet other employees wander aimlessly around the store or hide in corners on their cell phones. The people making the food, also slow, spend the entire time talking, gossiping, and cursing LOUDLY amongst each other.

Like, the two pieces of bread are basically touching themselves!! As with most chains, the food doesn't change much from store to store.

I can just eat it how it is.When I found out that Panera was opening up in Union Square. I was so f*cking excited.  This place has some really good food and great lunch deals. I know... it's a chain, but it's a chain that you can see and taste the quality they put in. It does get packed, since the location is in Union Square, but the mornings are usually fast. I can get a coffee in under 5 minutes. Since you do make it yourself with all the coffee just out there. Iced Coffee is in the back with the soda fountains.All in all, I do love this place.

It is actually larger than it looks from when you enter through main entrance. I would have never known there was more seating towards the back of the place (where restrooms are located). My only gripe is that there is only 1 women and 1 men stall for the restrooms. Needless to say the line was long and you have to wait forever, if you're a woman. I mean you can definitely use the men's bathroom but even doing that you still would need to wait on a line of other woman going in there. They would do better to just put unisex signs on the doors or open up another bathroom.The staff is REALLY nice. That is a great task dealing with variety of NY attitudes and nationalities being a bit of a tourist trap area of Union Sq. I didn't get usual ""know-it-all"" server reply or sarcasm. I'd go back just because of the nice people that work in this location.Food was great, as usual. The wait time was not too bad - maybe 10-15 mins to be brought over. The pastery case was a bit empty and had slim pickings, probably because it was after lunch hour rush. They should bake a larger quantity to keep up with demand of things that obviously sellout quickly and won't sit out too long anyway.I will definitely be going here again.",1,,

196,Armand K.,"Manhattan, NY",135,116,297,2.0,2/14/2013,"Lame overall experience.A friend recommended we try something different, being a Manhattanite that translated into trying something that is very much so not different for those who are not lucky enough to have  hundreds of unique restaurants within walking distance. We also remembered how in love some of our friends were with Panera when it first started expanding on Long Island and in upstate NY. So we walked in, the place was clean, fairly packed, and had a pleasantly casual atmosphere.Ordered the premium chicken salad with avocado and crumbled bacon. The food was brought out to us once ready, which was unexpected and different from my last Panera experience (roughly 3 years ago) in a good way. Started picking through the salad and noticed the avocado was past ripe and quite brown, the chicken was not of the highest quality and despite pieces of bacon and unexpected bleu cheese, it lacked flavor. Poor quality ingredients, very little protein, and an overall bland flavor profile prevented me from wanting to finish it. The apple served along side it was unfortunately equally pathetic.Thanks, but not thanks Panera Bread. Too many interesting options to spend another meal here.",,,
197,Ayhan D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,5/20/2015,Don't go and waste your money there. I used to go there sometimes but the rudeness of the manager and the administrative staff made me stop going there. They are really rude and expect you to eat their tasteless food in max 30 mins and leave. And they follow people if they stay longer or use the restrooms. Such a lousy management. They think they are professionals but lose customers. I'll simply tell my students to stay away from that place. Such a shame panera,,,

I look forward to their soups each winter. When I found out there were locations in the NYC area, I was excited - as was my husband. Sadly, the Union Square location let us down.My turkey sandwich, a long time personal favorite, came with no condiments. Just turkey, tomato, onion (onion??) and dry bread. Not even the usual sourdough it always comes on. No lovely dijon mayo. No nothing. The soup bowls here seem smaller, but that could just be the different style of bowl. My husband's 1/2 panino (we both did the ""You Pick 2"" was 1/2 the size of the 1/2 he usually gets elsewhere). Prices were NYC higher, of course. Just disappointing.",,,
