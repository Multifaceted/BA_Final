2,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2296,4007,4.0,6/18/2018,"New York changes a lot.   It's actually one of the cool things about the city.   Even in a day, or a week, a restaurant could open at your favorite old location, or staff can completely change somewhere, and thus the vibe, the experience. I had been to flight maybe a year prior to my recent visit.   I remember it feeling off the grid, pure Americana, comfortable, dark, almost kitschy, almost dive bar, unpretentious but self conscious.  It was decorated but lived in, the food was decent bar food and there were drink specials. I came back seeking all those things, mainly cheap beer.  The bar was full of regulars and the bartender was fun but gruff if overbearing, commanding the stage. I felt at home.  I ordered the .50 wing special, 10 minimum order, and a tall boy Narragansett for $5.  I topped it off with a few more $3 tecate cans.  In a city becoming gradually more and more  commercial, a $3 beer in New York is becoming more of a rarity.   The wings were good, so was the bar banter between the customers and staff.   Being next to happening gay ""Gym sports bar"", ""flight"" almost acts as a satellite gay bar.  What I like is that Fligjt 151 isn't so busy, feels clean, and has cheap decent beers.   You can chat at the bar with the existing group or take some privacy at a table near the back. Atmosphere - funky Americana dive bar Food and drink - good value, cheap beers      and decent food at reasonable prices",5,1,4

The music was low but it was explained to us that they were being courteous to their neighbors who lived above. So it's understandable.

Updated review","Can be fun....   Used to come here more when I lived in the area.  However most of the bartenders here are kind of touchy and tend to lack a sense of humor.   There was this lovely lady who was very nice and friendly and very reminiscent of the actress Kate Winslet, but better looking.  I think she left awhile ago.  This was in like 2014-15.  Their TVs are also too small for watching sports and such.  They have decent bar food options.   Still recommended for people visiting the area as there some good looking people you can meet here. Chelsea is changing and becoming more upscale and less gay-identified (Nothing wrong with gay - but if you're not looking for that it kind of sucked here 10-20 years ago).   But hopefully it won't get too yuppie-fied or sanitized either, as Chelsea has always been known for its hedonistic charm.",,,
16,Michael M.,"Brooklyn, NY",269,22,2,1.0,4/28/2018,"I have been coming here for a few years. There is a new bartender/ server girl and she asked if someone could put a card down for the tab. I specially told her I wanted to pay cash and she said I don't care if you pay with cash or card, you must put a card down. I told her I'll never be back here because of this. Then as she walks away she comes back and says I was just gonna leave with out paying. I'm telling her to go away from my table. She crazy. I have. Tomoto allergy and she still puts a tomato on my plate. Also asked for a medium rare and it's burnt.",2,,
17,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,5.0,5/12/2017,"I see Flight 151 has gotten mixed reviews on Yelp, but I honestly think it's one of the best bars in the city. There's no glitz or glamour here, no velvet ropes or bottle service, and no long waits to get in or go to the bathroom.There are, however, some amazing specials. On Mondays there are $5 Margaritas. On Tuesdays there's flip-a-coin night where you order a drink, call heads or tails, and don't have to pay if you get it right. There's no penalty or downside and the drinks are cheap as is, but if you're on a roll you can find yourself with quite a low bar tab. On Wednesdays there are $1 mini sliders and another drink special that's eluding me right now. On Thursdays there's trivia, but it's at the bar only. Every 15 minutes or so bartender reads out a random question from a Trivial Pursuit card and the first person to yell the answer gets a drink of their choice for free.You can also ask for a box of trivial pursuit cards just to take over to a table and enjoy quizzing your friends with. Best of all, they have those paper covers for the tables and crayons for drawing/hangman/dots/poetry. I think that this is one of the most underrated, best features of the place and always makes for extra fun.There's actually a fairly robust menu and the food is pretty good for a bar, I must say. They also have TVs to play whatever big game might be on that night.I think Flight 151 is a prime candidate for a local, go-to spot if you live in the area. It's hard to say whether you should make this a destination on its own, but I wouldn't mind if this was the only bar I went to for the rest of my life.",6,4,

The fact that they look-and charge-  like a dive bar with secretly higher standards for liquor/food makes them my favorite local joint, hands-down.

I also loved that the tables had paper table clothes and crayons, which kept us entertained playing tic tac toe. I've only gotten burgers here but they've always been good.

26,joseph h.,"Manhattan, NY",17,31,0,3.0,1/23/2017,"I am updating my initial review from last winter, in which I rated the venue as two stars, because the owner reached out afterwards and took actions which removed the problem.  Since then, I have been here twice, with bartender Francine serving me in a pleasant and welcoming manner.  From my personal experience, I would vote this bar most improved.  Below was my original review.  The burgers are very good, the curly fries even better, and the drinks are cheap.  It could be NYC's version of Cheers, and lured me in about half a dozen times, including three times over the last month.  But the last two times this month, the male bartender with dark hair acts as if he is a king, ignoring this male client.  He has been a consistently rude dude, while working to charm the women at the bar.  (Or at least, he was trying to).  The women bartender, on the other hand, was both pretty and sweet.  Order from her; ignore him.  They should transform this to a bar with only women bartenders, and get rid of him ASAP.   He is definitely costing them money.  If his attitude were like hers, this would be a four to five star rating.",3,,

I do not know, we jumped into the bar directly. They have full bars and specials and happy hours discounts like all others bars. So nothing expressed. My friend told me that their bathroom is cool, but I did not have a chance to pee there. So fellow YELPERs, lemme know if that's that interesting.Had beer. Service: bartender is definitely only talking to one dude....but thats good since we wanted to be left alone for the games.There are many later diners there...All I can see was that they were binge eating junk but delicious food.Jealous..Overall: 3 stars because unc loss...I know, there's no logic in this review.",2,1,1

We had about 2 hours to go and had the munchies. After walking around a bit were decided to pop into Flight 151.The theme of this bar is aeronautical and it isn't executed in a kitschy way. Their beer selection was pretty decent, as is their happy hour which is $2 Budweiser, Bud Light, Coors Light & pints of PBR and $ 3 well drinks & glasses of wine on Mondays through Friday's from 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM. Not bad at all.Monday's through Thursday they also do special promotions like spinning their drinking wheel, trivia, etc.For food we shared a plate of their cheese and bacon French fries and they were faaaaaaantastic! Strangely enough I also remember there randomly being crayons and paper placemats on our table which turned into me drawing mermaids and coloring...good times.Since moving out of Manhattan I'm really never in this neighborhood anymore, but if I am, I would definitely check this place out again since there were some things on their menu that I really wanted to try. 4 stars.",2,1,4

Be on the lookout for STEVE when you come here. Dude looks like a cross between John Cusak and Keanu Reeves. ITS PRETTY AMAZING.

40,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1851,4.0,7/11/2013,"Surprisingly excellent bar. Their happy hour may be one of the best (though also one of the shortest) in the city. From 5-7 they have $2 pints and $3 well drinks. Other specials include:Monday: $4 Margarita (frozen or on the rocks)Tuesday: ""Flip Night"", if you win a coin toss with the bartender your drink is free (don't know if they limit the free drinks)Wednesday: They spin a wheel every hour and announce a different drink specialThursday: Trivia Night (new question every 15 minutes where the first correct answer gets a free drink)Regular drafts are $3-7 (most are $4-6) and they have a full and surprising food menu. In addition to the standard bar food they also have an impressive list of proper entrees and custom hot dogs. I got the meatloaf ($13) which comes with mixed vegetables, salad, and choice of potato. The food was excellent and beautifully presented, almost shocking given the fact this is a divey bar with an airplane motif. The comfortable booths in back are covered in white paper with a cup of crayons. It's a fun way to pass the time and show off your doodling or tic tac toe skills. If crayons aren't your thing they have some board games (mostly just chess/checkers)Service was hit or miss, during my couple hours here I had 3 different people helping me. One of which was utterly clueless, he even insisted I pick a dressing despite me telling him I didn't want my salad. He brought me a salad anyway. The other waitresses weren't bad though, so 2 out of 3 is pretty good. I'll definitely be back in the near future for more of their drink specials and food.

The drinks were strong and extremely well-priced. Went back the next day and encountered a new staff that was equally outgoing and chatty.

Doorman told me I could take a seat anywhere and gave me a menu but nothing else. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to wait for a server or order from the bar. So after waiting 10 minutes I guessed that I had to order from the bar. A female bartender took my drink and food order.I got my food and is was very presentable I ordered a hamburger with curly fries. I enjoyed the fries immensely! They were great and perfectly seasoned. The hamburger bun was very dry, I had to down it with two beers to finish. Another negative point during my visit was when I went up to the bar to order another drink, I guess the bartender noticed I was seated at a table, and told me that I could not order from the bar, I had to order from a server!  I sat down waited for a server to come my way, order my draft beer. That server went back to the bar and the very same bartender poured my beer so my server could bring it to me. Talk about inefficiency!  There was one person sitting at the bar at the time!  Why couldn't I just cut out the middle man wasn't like anyone greeted me in the first place.

I thought he was generally pretty welcoming, intelligent, funny, and outgoing, and those are qualities I think are requisite for that particular job.  He was cool, we were cool, things were cool.  I was looking forward to having a nice night there...the two times I had visited before he made sure to introduce me to some regulars and make me feel at home.  At some point tonight, tho, he commented to me and my friend that he finds nothing less attractive than a ""blonde white girl.""  This was unprovoked, apropos of nothing...and to two blonde women.  Reading this, I'm sure many would find the comment innocuous or believe I'm overreacting, but you know what?  I had a rough day, a rough few months, have my own stuff, and frankly don't appreciate unsolicited commentary about how the way I look is apparently completely repulsive to some guy.  Maybe he thinks blonde women need to be taken down a peg, maybe he felt like expression of his revulsion toward us would make him seem affable, but it didn't and it's not my place to make guesses.  I feel confused, insulted, and worse for coming there than if I had done something else with my time after work.I'm giving this place three stars, because I don't think the bartender is a bad guy at all (I'm actually disappointed because otherwise I'm enthusiastic about his presence), but at the same time, my experience was enough to disincentivize future visits.   I just don't get why negging your customers is interesting.  I am a regular at a few bars (don't judge), and while things can get dicey at times, it never crosses the line into insults like that.I'm sad writing this, but I felt the need to communicate my thoughts about it.  I guess my advice would be to avoid the place on certain nights if you're female, present as caucasian, and highlight your hair.",6,1,
47,Jim H.,"New York, NY",9,48,128,1.0,12/22/2016,"Bad customer service and hit or miss food! I had a couple of neighbors over to my apartment tonight, to watch a movie, and we decided to order dinner in. I called Flight 151 and requested three appetizers, four entrées, four beverages and four deserts. I was told that the entrées come with salad and what dressing would I like on them. I asked if I could substitute one salad for a soup instead. I was told no because their computer system was unable to make any substitutions. I politely asked, ""I'm spending over $100 and you can't exchange a salad for a soup?"" The person taking the order nicely asked me to hold a moment and I heard her ask the manager if she could give the soup in place of a salad and his answer was, ""Absolutely not."" There's just too many restaurants in Manhattan to patronize one that has bad customer service - especially when it comes to a simple request. I'm not one to believe that the customer is always right either. But, one knows whenever a business is just all wrong toward their customers. So, in choosing to order-in from Flight 151 tonight, we hit a dead end. No problem, I know how to make a U-turn and that's what I did and canceled the entire order. I won't be patronizing this restaurant any longer and I've been a customer here for 24 years. The food was never all that good. But, it was a quick fix and a semi-reliable meal a few times a year. There were two other neighborhood households visiting me tonight and they said they'll never patronize this restaurant simply because of Flight 151's inhospitality toward their guests. We took our business elsewhere and the restaurant that we did order from was happy to offer soup or salad with their entrées. This was a non-issue for this other neighborhood restaurant. One more thing I should mention about Flight 151 is that quite often their fried food has been kept in the grease too long, over fried and tastes only of old grease. Because of this, I quit ordering onion rings from here many years ago! Now, because of the bad customer service and substandard food, I'll never do business with them again. Too many other good choices in Chelsea to be bothered again by Flight 151.... ADDENDUM TO MY ABOVE REVIEW: I see the manager of Flight 151 has responded here to my unsatisfactory review. Very nice of you to do so, Sir. Your response makes me believe that it was not the manager who denied the substitution of soup instead of salad. However, I was denied by the restaurant when placing my order tonight. I made the call at 5:46pm and your staff knows this took place. But, they're not admitting it to you. Good luck and I don't wish you any bad will.",1,,

There was nobody in the entire restaurant, completely empty, and they wouldn't let us sit with our beers because those were for people ordering food. Instead, they'd rather have us stand in front of the bar and clog up the walkway (there were 6 of us). My friend sat in an empty booth, one of the 70 empty chairs. Waitress came, snatched her beer and slammed it on the bar, said she had to order food if she wanted to keep sitting and smiled. DISGUSTING ATTITUDE. We didn't even finish our (flat) beer. We left.

The place offers a typical assortment of sandwiches and burgers, served with a side of potatoes. Though I am not a vegetarian, I do recommended the vegetable sandwich with a side of curly fries. Once again it's not amazing but it's relatively healthy and tastes decent. Drinks:This place has a wide selection of not so great beers (Stella, bud, etc) and a modest selection of decent ones. The prices however aren't bad as each beer ranges from $3-$6. The cocktails are also relatively cheap ($5, I think) but they are very basic. Bartenders:I've been here twice and had three different bartenders. All were attentive and good in there own way. Atmosphere:I've enjoyed watching a Nets game and a World Cup game here. The crowd is very eclectic yet the place still has a very local, homey vibe. They have an abundance of big screens, which is great. They seem to also frequently have random bar games too where you can win free drinks- also excellent.

Unfortunately, once the food came, I changed my mind about continuing to come back for lunch. Salad wasn't the best but I wasn't expecting much from a dive bar with a kitschy flight theme. It did have a fishy taste to it--as if it had been hanging out on the freezer for a while with fishy foods. The kicker came when I took a bite out of the chicken sandwich. The chicken was so rubbery it tasted like it was frozen, dehydrated, boiled in Elmer's glue, shown a picture of a campfire to make it feel warm, and then served on a bun. I was so nervous about what I was eating I couldn't finish it.

Kind of place where your drink is already waiting for you and two stools down there's a friend or someone who could be by the end of the night. I've gotten to know more than a few of the other regulars here and it's always surprising to me how long they've been coming and how far they travel to continue to if they've moved out of the area. Brass Tacks: Flip Night on Tuesdays is always a blast; every time you order your drinks the bartender flips a coin and if you call it, it's free. Simple as that. Trivia on Thursdays starts at 7 and Steve is hilarious. Marielle and Johan are definitely my favorites; Weds. night is a great night to hang out there because it's a little less crowded and the constant shot specials are a steal. 3$ Rolling Rocks, 5$ mixed drinks at any hour pretty much can't be beat and the food is surprisingly great. I usually get the Veggie Burger (best in neighborhood, no joke) with curly fries and cheese but the Mozz Sticks, Pasta (Salmon cream penne?), and the daily specials are all killer (Buffalo Nachos. Buffalo. Nachos.). They'll even accommodate some insane requests: I once sat next to a guy who ordered a deep-fried hot dog topped with a mozz. stick, covered in chili and a swath of sour cream.

89,John F.,"Arlington, VA",110,49,3,4.0,10/13/2014,"Flight 151 is my favorite local dive bar.  The service is attentive and friendly, the decor amusing, and the food is surprisingly good especially given the prices.  The silly drinking games add to the fun and I love the jukebox I can control with my phone.  Of course, they always know it's me when the 80s come on.  I have been here many many times so I've tried almost all the food.  The Chicken Dijon, Crab cakes, tuna melts, and exceptional curly fries are all standouts.  Even the pasta carbonara isn't half bad and that's something most Italian restaurants can't even get right.  Now the ribs are lackluster but this is a bar not a BBQ joint, the veggie burger is sub-par but who orders one in a sports bar other than my non-meat eating girlfriend whom I took there on a first date, and the specials are so repetitive that sometimes I think the owner Roy is having a joke at everyone's expense.  Amusingly enough though, while some dishes are prepared surprisingly well, they can't get the burger right.  If you order a burger rare, which is how I like it, you can forget about getting it that way.  When I've ordered a burger ""as rare as you can make it,"" the server once responded by saying ""you mean you want it 'black and blue'?"" to which I responded in the affirmative.  It still came out well-done.  Oh well, no place is perfect and Flight 151 is no exception.  Regardless, if I'm looking for a cheap place to get a beer and a reliable bite, it's my go-to dive.  The fact that it's less than two blocks away doesn't hurt.  If you see Matt the bartender, tell him his ""best buddy"" sent you.  Don't expect better service though unless you play Phish for him.  Oh and if you hear ""I Ran"" by A Flock of Seagulls, I'm probably in the joint.",,,

93,Jarrod B.,"Northport, NY",0,16,0,1.0,11/17/2014,"This was easily one of the worst bars I've ever been to. The waitress came over to our table with a glaze over her eyes and needed to read the entire beer menu when we asked about one. A second waitress followed and blew right by joking/playful straight to obnoxious. The music was good if you want to listen to Drake radio on Pandora, which I'm definitely into, just not on a Sunday night at a sports bar.A friend mentioned that the last couple of times they went the chicken was rubbery and tasted like it was microwaved, so that eliminated about half the menu. She recommended the crab cakes but I really wish I didn't listen because they were almost entirely bread and the sauce on top made it taste like pizza. We got the chips and salsa for the table and although the salsa had a pretty good kick to it, it was completely watered down. I ordered a burger medium rare and it came still mooing when it got to the table. The curly fries, even served lukewarm, were definitely the best part of the entire meal. Flight is a college bar with all of the bad parts and none of the good ones. Probably won't be finding me in there again.",,,

What to do next? Simple: catch Flight 151 direct to schwasty face. So said Bob Dylan. This bar is the last of a dying breed: the Chelsea dive. Affordable, affable, vaguely aviation-themed. Has functioning plumbing, electric, and HVAC. Close to the Subway. But I can't stand dive bars. Give me the Oak Room at the Fairmont Douchington any day. So there's another force at work here, and that force is Matt the barkeep. Hot sauce addict, beard enthusiast, nocturnal creature, mixologist. He'll keep you hydrated while giggling at your friend's Koch brothers affiliation. Time slips by and the Jamesons flow, and at some point you'll realize you've spent 7 hours of your life staring at dated wall sconces clutching an imitation crystal tumbler.

109,Kate R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/13/2015,"Writing my first yelp review because of my experience today, as well as similar experiences here in the past.I'll start with the bad news.  I've been to this bar many times (20+) times to watch college and pro football.  My crew typically picks this bar because we can always get a table (i.e., it is not crowded on Sundays during NFL games).  It is clear based on our consistent treatment from the manager (the thin, balding, man with long grey hair, who wears glasses), I can see why we can always get a table.  Today, specifically, when we arrived we asked specifically about what games would be on what TVs so we could decide where to sit.  When the 4pm games came on, we asked our waitress, and then this manager, to put the games on as promised.  He told us the games were not on yet (which was not true, we were following the games on our phones), and then when we asked again he grunted (did not speak) at us and walked away.  We waited another 10-15 minutes to ask again (well into the 1st quarter) and this time he walked by us, said again just ""I don't know,"" and walked to the back.  When he came back, my friend asked him if he was going to acknowledge our request (at this time the TVs at issue were showing recaps, not actual games), and he again grunted said ""f*ck,"" and at which point I turned at asked him if we ""had spent enough money for him to pay attention to us.""  10 minutes later he came back and changed the televisions.  At least 2 other times during the night he walked by our table and said ""f*ck"" and ""a**holes"" while walking by us, and nothing else.  It was insulting, especially since we spent hundreds of dollars there.  If it wasn't for the very kind and attentive wait staff, we would have left on the spot.It is worth mentioning that we had another run in with this man last January during the NFL playoffs which I think would concern the owners.  During the wild card round (when they play one game at a time, so there is only one game to put on the TVs and there is only one potential game to put on sound for) I came into this bar with a group of 12-15 people who were ready to eat lunch and drink heavily.  There were 3-4 people sitting at the bar, and the rest of the restaurant was completely empty.  The games were on the TV, and we asked this same manager to put the sound on.  He said they only put sound on for Jets or Giants games, which I knew was not true having watched almost every game at this bar during the 2014-15 season.  We plead with him to put the sound on, or we would be forced to leave.  He refused and said the owner (I hope he/she is reading this) did not permit it.  It bears repeating that other than the 3-4 people at the bar, the place was EMPTY.  Any time we tried to ask him about it, he would say no and then run away to the back of the restaurant.  The waitress who was going to have our table started pleading with him, knowing that if we left she would lose out on a $100+ dollar tip, he again rudely refused, and ran to the back.  As a result, we all left, and spent over $1,000 at Jake's Saloon on 9th Avenue, who was happy to have us.The good news is that the waiters and waitresses are always nice, attentive, friendly, and accommodating.  They have a lot of beer choices, and good food.  And, you can always get  a table on NFL football Sundays.We were told by staff at the restaurant that many complaints have been made about this man, and the owners refuse to do anything about it.  They suggested we write a Yelp review, so here we are.  This man is consistently VERY rude, curses at guests, and turns away customers willing to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars.  This not only effects the wait staff, but costs the owners money.  I hope this is rectified immediately, or we will find another dive bar to give our money too every, single Sunday this fall.",3,,

We decided to go with curly fries and cheese on the side to start and I ordered the chicken enchiladas as a main course. The portion was really big! It came with a small side of rice, beans and was topped with melted cheese and salsa. The fries were really good. The menu had all the typical bar-food choices and we got a perfect side booth right in front of the flat screen TV.

143,Robert M.,"La Puente, CA",25,26,0,1.0,3/9/2011,Their seemingly amazing happy hour deals on draft beers are limited to Bud and Rolling Rocks. I am not picky but don't advertise drafts if mean only cheap drafts. When I mentioned the misleading signs the bartender got an attitude.I had never had Rolling Rock before so I decided to give it a shot. It tasted like horse piss. Not being one to let alcohol go to waste I choked it down then ordered a Blue Moon which tasted like a Blue Moon mixed with horse piss. This place seems incapable of getting anything right.,4,5,1
144,Ethan F.,"Brooklyn, NY",416,165,638,5.0,2/4/2011,"I'm fortunate enough to work right around the corner from this gem. Otherwise, I probably would have never thought twice to go in here. It just looks like any other hole-in-the-wall bar from the outside. But, once you step in, it's a totally different story. Flight 151, in addition to being a bar, is a fully operating restaurant...with really tasty food to boot!F151 is home to the city's most savory veggie burger. It's the last thing that I would have ever expected, especially since I've visited pretty much every vegetarian/vegan place in all of Manhattan. Pair that veggie burger up with an order of curly fries, and we're talking best meal ever potential.F151 has a super affordable lunch special. For $8.00, you get either a soup or salad, a sandwich (from a list of about 10 choices), and a side (most of which are a variation on a potato). The portions are VERY generous. A to-go box is mandatory. Just how lunch should be!F151 makes all of their dressings in-house. How many bars that you know of do that? I love it. Get the house vinaigrette...it's TO DIE FOR. I was tempted to lick my salad plate clean. It's THAT good.The decor in F151 is a little cheesy, but somehow the joint still manages to pull off being super cute. You'll find me eating here again during my lunch hour in the very near future.",8,2,2

Filled with a decent mix of patrons this is definitely a no attitude bar.There's just enough TV's for those that wish to catch their sports as well as the nice open windows give you fair bit of people watching capabilities.This place is a simple and fun place to come to to unwind and kill a few hours.  The bar food is pretty good with their burgers the typical kind that are dripping with ""goes perfect with alcohol"" grease.",1,,

Happy hour is 5-7 Monday-Thursday and they have some fun promos like Flip Night Tuesday where you call a coin toss and if you guess right you get a free beer. I prefer $2 pints during happy hour and overall the drinks aren't too pricey for New York City, specifically the Chelsea area.As for the typical bar food it was greasy and unappetizing. At least the beer was flowing and the company was entertaining. Other than the interesting Aviation theme this bar was fairly unmemorable.

A simple kettle and soda tall. Needless to say if I wanted any type of service, myself or my friends would have to literally get up and get her to come wait on us.

Their beers are exceptionally, tooth freezingly cold, and they have many drink specials throughout the week. It is ,however, extremely loud, making conversation difficult at best. Their menu is a bit broader than one might imagine and they do specials that change (weekly I think), but I would say that I get sick as often as I don't after eating here and so now I mostly just stick to the beer. I would give them only one star for the food due to the high incidences of intestinal distress that I have suffered by their cooks hand, but they are mostly a bar and they do that well enough, and my friends like it here so again I am a little reluctant to shoot them down completely.",1,,1

They have a video game, but I didn't note what it was. And they have O'Doul's, which was nice, because I haven't been drinking lately. $6 a bottle, though, which is what a six pack costs in my neighborhood.Lots of after-work suit and tie guys from nearby offices. More of a corporate crowd than I'm used to in Chelsea. But friendly and comfortable, despite the way-small bathrooms.One thing that has nothing to do with the bar, but somewhere nearby, was the stacks of magazines I found in someone's trash and recycling. Back issues of Another Magazine and Dazed & Confused, as well as other pricy imported fashion mags. There was a day that I would have cut open a bundle and loaded up to take them home, but instead, I just assessed the stash, smiled, and said, ""Good for you, humans. Good for you."" in my best Dr. Who impression.Awesome free magazines. An unknown perk of Flight 151.",1,1,1

Tuesday night they have a flip-for-drinks special where PBR is $2 with a coin-flip determining whether you pay at all. For the non-math people in the audience, this means $1 PBR all night.The food is of the bar/pub variety and is not bad. It's kind of an unexpected place to go drinking, but somehow I end up there quite a bit.",1,1,1

199,Matthew C.,"Forest Hills, NY",121,94,50,3.0,10/9/2010,"Walked into this place on my friend's recommendation. We arrived at about 7:00 P.M. and the place was kind of dead, but it  started filling up shortly after we arrived. The food was typical mediocre bar food. I had the crab cake sandwich, which was OK. My friend loved his buffalo chicken sandwich, but this was after 3 beers and an empty stomach. The one redeeming factor was the service. Our hostess and server made this place memorable and worth another visit. Dominique the hostess was charming and courteous. Sarah our server was awesome. She was attentive, prompt, and incredibly patient with our endless questions. These two lovely ladies are the reason I will return. If you're in the area check it out.",1,,
