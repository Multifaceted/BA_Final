Updated review","Yesterday I ventured into Old Town. It was packed, everyone was cheers and it reminded me of Cheers. You know that bar where everyone knows your name. The bartenders are old school and polite. I found out that not only is this a historic bar but it has loads of personality.  I meet some really amazing people at the bar. Ladies, I recommend a glass of rosé!  In the food department I ordered the nachos - simply a winner.   I read other reviews where there was much raving about their chicken wings. I suppose I must make an encore visit to sample. Old Town has stained glass windows, dumbwaiters, and a crowd of regulars.   I was simply marveled that not only did I live in the neighborhood for years, but walked pass many times and never tried them out. I feel like I cheated myself in that department.  If you're looking for some old New York, I recommend you add Old Town to your bucket list. Thank You Roberto and Old Town for treating me to a wonderful evening.     So I went back to OTB for an encore. The wings were everything and more.  I asked for the recipe but was told it's simple.  In my honest opinion the wings are simply delicious. Hotdog - good quality, solid and comes with dressing. Cheeseburger - mmm mmm good!!!! I had my burger with Swiss cheese. French Fries - they make their own!Martini - I had a vodka martini - I love the fact that their martini's are mini's. Beer - their pumpkin beer is a must try this season!Oh yeah & the next time you watch SVU the bar scene might just have been filmed at OTB - a big might.P.s.Next time you are at OTB stop by the bar and say hello to the handsome and awesome Mister Fitz!!!!",2,1,2
1,Michael Z.,"New York, NY",451,154,345,5.0,10/11/2018,"Over the past year, I've been questing with a friend to find the best wings in NYC, hitting up one new place a month based on a variety of compilations. With our last month of this just wrapping up, Old Town is probably my definitive favorite of all the places we went to for classic buffalo wings. Actions speak louder than words, and I can definitely say that I've found myself coming back here and taking friends who haven't been, advertising the wings here as the best I've ever had. Honestly, I don't know how to describe these wings other than by saying they're exactly everything I've ever wanted in a buffalo wing, and it's consistent, and it delivers. It's as simple as that. Well fried and well sauced, with plenty of meat on every bone and probably the best blue cheese dip I've had to go with it (and I'm a ranch fan).If you go to the top floor for dinner, it can be a little quiet on slower nights, especially if you're going early. I have a feeling that this is where some variance in the wings might be introduced, as the temperature and seasoning have had some less than ideal moments--specifically the wings were a bit too salty once, and not quite hot enough another time. That being said, the buffalo flavor is unmatched for me, and the portions interestingly stick out for the price. Many wings places do not offer wings the size of this place's, and even fewer can claim as good of a # per dollar or even lb per dollar value, at least in NYC.You likely won't need a side, especially if you get a large, but if you do opt for one, I can vouch for the fries and calamari, which are both decent.Service is pretty good for the most part, but you'll probably want to flag servers down if you want something quick. I really enjoy the decor, as it shows the history of the place, but it can feel a bit beat up at times. I've actually never eaten in the first floor, where most of the liveliness seems to be, but I see this place as a wings restaurant more than a bar, so dining floor works for me.",,,
2,Gerard P.,"Staten Island, NY",276,372,5,2.0,7/17/2018,"As other people have said, the main draw here is nostalgia and sentimentality. If you want to pretend what it was like during conclaves of the Algonquin Round Table, you might enjoy this place. While the staff is friendly and attentive, the food is sub par, even by bar standards-I saw insects hovering around  a Caesar salad. The musical selection is depressive, although better than the Top 40 pop pablum you usually find in NYC bars-and enjoyable if you're a fan of the blues, which I'm not. I went to this bar years ago for happy hour with my friends, and it was much more vibrant. I don't know what happened, but it's not an improvement.",,,
3,Ryan P.,"Manhattan, NY",2835,85,10717,3.0,9/22/2018,"Cool bar with a lot of character. They also have a reasonable menu. If you are looking for a bar snack it is good, I recommend the giant pretzel. We had dinner there. For any other food, I would recommend sticking to the simple American classics, mainly burgers. I had the turkey burger which I was not at all a fan of. All in all a fun bar though.",10,2,9
4,Laura V.,"North Bay Village, FL",85,10,0,1.0,11/16/2018,"Came here with my colleagues after work to get some drinks. First thing when we walked in, one of the bartenders (short-haired blonde probably in her 40s) approaches our table and says without even looking at us: ""excuse me, you're not going to store your crap here and not order anything"" I said: ""of course we're going to order, we just got here"" to that she responds ""oh ok I was just checking"", I said ""there are better ways to take an order"". I ordered a Guinness, enjoyed it with my friends, payed, tipped generously and promised to never go back to that place.",,,
5,Dimitrios D.,"Queens, NY",71,372,407,3.0,2/10/2018,"Old Town Bar is a cool looking, historic bar.  It has a dumbwaiter- that pulley elevator thing that transports trays and plates to and from the basement to the ground floor.  It has high ceilings and old fashioned wooden furnishings. But tables are also sticky and the place overall is sort of dingy.  If the place had a major cleaning, it would be so, so much nicer- at least for someone like me who's a bit of a germ person. All in all though, a solid, historical NYC bar with no major complaints.",1,,
6,Diego M.,"Springfield, NJ",296,139,270,4.0,6/4/2018,"Good place for a quick draft. Don't expect anything fancy. No chocolate porters or IPAs, or at least don't expect the bartender to know. It's Pabst or Guiness, keep it simple. Burgers are pretty good. Ambiance is old school.",,,
7,Joe H.,"New York, NY",228,44,288,5.0,4/22/2018,"I'm a big wing guy. I love 'em. If I could only eat one food for the rest of my life, it would be buffalo wings. Hands down. The wings here, you ask? Fantastic! Not too big or too small. Just the right amount of flavor and sauce. Came with mostly flats and a delicious blue cheese dressing. If you can get down with some good wings, check this place out.",1,,1
8,Giuseppe A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",63,1,0,2.0,10/27/2018,"Over all experience very good.Food is good. Not exceptional. The location is very charming, being an original old New York bar. The only downside is that they decided to add to our check 20% tip. We were just 3 people.They didn't give us options and they filled our check with 20%. Didn't like that.",,,
9,Morgan M.,"Oceanside, CA",78,17,8,4.0,3/22/2018,"I'm pretty bent on this one. I really wanted to like this place but our server was terrible. We walked in and asked for a booth. The server offered to clean up the only available booth for us, which was nice of her. I left to use the restroom and when I returned, my wife told me that the server was being rude to her. I didn't think much of it until the server came to take our orders. She was nice enough to me but flat out rude to my wife. She responded to me cheerfully but when my wife placed her order, she either responded with very short answers or just completely ignored her and walked off. That treatment continued throughout the entire time we were there. The establish was a little run down but it almost felt as if that was the vibe that they were going for. It is called ""Old Town Bar"" after all. The urinals in the men's room are no joke. They're the biggest, most magnificent urinals I've ever seen! Now onto the part that makes this review hard for me: the food. I ordered the buffalo wings and my wife got the cheeseburger and we split both of them, as we often do. The burger seemed a little on the small side but was really tasty and perfectly medium rare. The wings though. Wow. Seriously the best wings I've ever eaten in my life. And my wife and I are avid wing eaters. We actually ordered a second serving of the wings so we could take them home. They have seriously amazing wings. We might not ever go into another Buffalo Wild Wings again...Update: we came back a second because the wings  were seriously that good. This time we got a different server and she was really nice to my wife and I. Upgrading this place to 4 stars. Also, the back of the menu has some pretty cool facts about the history of the bar, dating back to pre-prohibition time. Very interesting read. Anyways, the wings here are bomb. I'll definitely be back next time I visit NYC. Seriously. Go get some wings from this joint.",1,,
10,Chris S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",154,245,9,4.0,1/4/2018,"With bragging rights of being one of the oldest bars in the city, I just love this spot.   It is what it is, a very old bar with the decor to match.   There are two floors - which I typically get there when the first floor is packed and head upstairs.   The food is always, okay.  But it makes up for it in charm and I am confident most of the staff have been there since before I was born. Great lower midtown spot for after work!",4,1,2
11,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,118,0,4.0,12/21/2017,"I liked this bar for exactly what it was. It's old and it shows. As a native New Yorker, this is one of the only bars I've visited in Manhattan with such an ""old school neighborhood bar down the block"" feel. The bartenders were experienced and the drinks were good. I'm not sure about ordering food here. Some places are just meant for drinking and it's always pretty obvious. If you're looking for a night out- this isn't the place. This is where you go on a night when you're feeling lazy and it's too cold to walk far. I was there on a Saturday night. Huge range of ages - 70 year olds (you can tell this has been their bar for 50 years) and people in their 20's. Everyone was there to get drunk and have a good time and that's  exactly what I did.",3,,1
12,Emma P.,"Hoboken, NJ",12,86,95,4.0,6/10/2018,"Classic New York bar in a great position tucked away behind Union Sq. The interior is original, a long oak bar with a huge mirror behind, tin ceilings and wooden booths downstairs with a dining room upstairs. Service is gruff, but the staff are nice once you get through their tough exteriors. They serve a good selection of beers and the cocktails are decent. (Order a classic one such as a Martini, not some new fangled fancy pants flower flavoured glittery unicorn one, because I'm pretty sure they won't make you the unicorn one!). Wine is pretty terrible, the sort of wine you would get on an economy flight but honestly, what do you expect? It's not a 'cheese and wine' type bar. The Old Town gets busy early evening, it's the sort of bar people visit after work or meet up at before going elsewhere.Food is basic bar food, burgers, dogs, wings, nachos etc. Prices are reasonable and the food is fair for bar food, it's exactly what you need when you've been drinking. I know that its called 'Old Town Bar and Restaurant' but for me, it is much more of a bar than a dining destination. It's a pretty spectacular bar with a very good atmosphere. The Old Town is a very 'New York' type of place, one that's been around for ages and one which I hope stays around for many years to come!",1,,
13,K M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0,3.0,10/2/2018,"Great atmosphere,  part cool dive bar part post prohibition throw-back.  Odd, in a bad way, customer service today. Paid with credit card. Server returned to table and threw it at table said it was declined and disappeared. I got out another card to pay (she did not come back for a while). I  called cc. It was declined because of suspicious merchant activity. When she returned with slip to sign, I nicely told her what they said and she said ""doesn't matter"" when I said well seems problem was on merchant side she responded with a rude ""whatever"". Tip reflected ... treat people the way you would want if you want a tip!",,,
14,Marc S.,"Manhattan, NY",401,1,0,1.0,9/23/2018,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I showed up 10 minutes before they opened and I got as escorted out of the restaurant and showed 0 respect. The owner was nasty, the chef was nasty, overall really terrible experience. I have been here before and the wings are usually great and have never been treated like this.  I think it is time for a change in management because it seems the people who have been running the place for years are tired and grumpy. If I could give it 0 stars I would.",,,

Also a vibe that it's not trying too hard. Had a Guinness here and my friend had a Negroni. The Guinness was good, the Negroni...not so much, but maybe that is to be expected at a place like this. Prices seemed a little high. I would stick to beer or neat liquor here. Fun to at least stop in and experience.",,,

24,Thomas C.,"Massapequa Park, NY",353,296,3807,3.0,5/28/2016,"I lunched at Old Town Bar & Restaurant on 5/18, a joint that is divier than Greg Louganis. I sat at a table in the bar area toward the rear of the bar, not in the distinct dining area. The wood on the table was peeling off. I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger which came with fries($16.50) and a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, one of the many excellent draft and bottle beers the restaurant offers.My server took my order politely and efficiently, albeit a bit coolly.My meal arrived promptly. The Bacon Cheese Burger arrived medium as requested. It was fairly good but, for $16.50, the burger seemed a little small. The fries were competently made, tasty and not greasy.Although you can get a good burger here, there are better options in the Flatiron, Murray Hill and Kips Bay area.",1,4,2

The hostess, after we said we just wanted to order drinks, told our party to go upstairs . Went upstairs to an empty room filled with empty tables and the lady said we could only sit down if each individual person ordered food, basically they said no to the $200 tab of multiple rounds of drinks and appetizers.

I ate some sort of mushy calamari as an appetizer followed by a steak sandwich, flavorless and served cold. Everything on the table was flaccid and sad. My steak knife fell on the floor, gone forever, but I knew I would not be able to get the waitress' attention, although I tried. The place does have an old New York vibe, but you know what?

If not, we have to go to the Old Town Bar.""I hadn't been to the Old Town Bar, so we did, in fact, go to the Old Town Bar. It was one of those monsoon days in mid-July, and it felt so good to be inside, drying off and rehydrating with beer. The bar was excellent, as promised, one of the oldest in Manhattan, with dark wood booths and a long mirrored bar, the atmosphere pleasantly thick even at 4:30 on a weekday afternoon. The only annoying thing was that the bathroom was out the door and up a flight of stairs, but even the flight of stairs was kind of cool.I had a couple beers and stole some of Adam's fries, but otherwise didn't eat here, though you can get a full meal. I drank pints of Lagunitas IPA--the beer selection was pretty standard (I really do love that you can get Lagunitas everywhere these days), but honestly, it would've felt strange to run into a bunch of seasonal microbrews here.Old Town Bar was a neat place for a drink, and I'd love to go back next time I need a bar near Union Square.

45,Peter K.,"New York, NY",77,1077,48,5.0,5/22/2017,The legendary Old Town Bar & Restaurant is one of NYC's oldest bars in continuous operation since 1892! And one of the coolest looking bars in NYC! The marble and mahogany bar is 55 ft long and the ceilings are 16 ft high! It's appeared in lots of movies and TV shows and was where House Of Pain shot the video for Jump Around. Really cool pace with great history. Full bar and restaurant too.,,,
46,Laura O.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,8,2,1.0,2/7/2018,"I have been here many times and had never had a problem until tonight when I was going to meet old college friends in town for drinks. I was running late but had chosen Old Town Bar for my friends as a sort of tourist location/catch up setting. In transit, I started to receive frantic texts from our group message saying my friends were getting kicked out of their booth because they weren't meeting their drink minimum? I had never known Old Town to have such a thing and had sat there many a time with one other friend and had a drink and left. They said they had asked all the bartenders to be sure and no one had ever heard of the rule ""$10 minimum per person"" which is interesting because the average drink is around $7.50. Let's also note the friends in the booth are two women, one is black and one is Mexican. I am white and late and rushing to get to them. I arrive just in time to see the manager yelling at my friends as they calmly try to talk with him saying phrases like ""Can I explain my perspective now?"" only to literally be met with ""Those are my rules and if you don't like it then you can get out. I've been here for 40 years."" This man looked INSANE and I just don't know who the hell yells at their customers?! I work in the restaurant industry and have to deal with the unfortunate real ness that sometimes things won't go your way, but to create a mathematically impossible drink minimum and then proceed to kick them out because they weren't spending money quickly enough to make up for our lateness is baffling. He also threatened to call the police! Forgot to add that part in. This is also all over not only the drink minimum but also the fact that they couldn't have just 2 people in a booth...did I mention that? And on our way out I looked around and over half of the booths had 2 PEOPLE in them. But, they were all white so I guess that plays a little differently. Is Old Town Bar code for ""Old Racist Ways""? Let a girl know, because I will tell everyone I know I'm New York to never support this business. Peace.",30,2,
47,Sonja M.,"Chicago, IL",229,1,0,1.0,2/7/2018,"Full disclosure: I'm part of the percent of people who exclusively downloaded the yelp app to leave a bad review about a terrible experience I had while at Old Town Bar for the very first time. I also left a very similar review on Old Towns FB page. In the power that I have in the age of social media, just wanted to briefly mention that not even 10 minutes ago I left Old Town Bar shaken and on the verge of tears. After receiving pretty unacceptable service and behavior from our waitress my table asked to speak with a manager. However, before we asked to speak with a manager we were informed by our waitress that tables near the bar were for three or more guests only. It was my FIRST TIME at Old Town Bar and even I thought ""seems reasonable."" I honestly did not know and told the waitress that I had never been here before (we were only two people at the time; with another three on the way). For those reading, my friend and I were already seated in the booth for I believe close to a half hour, before any of this was mentioned. Maybe the waitress was giving the two of us some time before mentioning the minimum. However, we were also told in that same moment that there was a $10 minimum per person at the table. My drink alone was a local cider at $9.50. My friends drink was $7.50. I would have ordered a second cider as it's the only thing I am able to drink. But, that's what struck me as odd as someone in the service industry myself. The $10 minimum per person I hadn't heard of before. I'm from the Chicago land area, I've heard of service fees and gratuity fees and splitting checks and only two cards to a table. Chicago Improv has a two drink minimum per person. However these places state it verbally and in fine print on the menus. With Old Town Bar, I couldn't confirm these minimums (guest and dollar amount) anywhere in fine print on the menu. I thought about asking another table on my waitresses section, but didn't want to encroach on their evening. But I did see another table of two (white) woman with food and drink near the door. Had they been told the same thing?I then proceeded to get up and ask a younger bartender about the minimums at the tables. The bartender said he didn't know and quote ""doesn't do the tables."" My friend asked another bartender, an older gentleman and he said he didn't know. I guess that's when my friend and I ""knew,"" that we were being treated differently because we were people of color. The manager ultimately comes over already visibly upset and annoyed (just as our other guests were arriving) and gave us his few sentences of ""this is how it is with the minimums. If you don't like it- tough"" kind of attitude. I said, ""Okay. Would you like to hear our side of the story?"" I could not finish as the manager proceeded to tell us to leave and to never come back. I was really taken a back, because I believe the situation could have been squashed in that moment had the manager just listened and chalked it up to just a comp on the one or maybe two drinks. But that was not the case as the manager was so confrontational in his initial approach. He quote ""has been here for 40 years!"" I guess Old Town has Old Ways with its blatant racism. I felt like he was blowing it out of proportion. I didn't understand why this was escalating to the level that it did. It was so unbelievable that it couldn't be handled professionally right then and there. We did leave without paying for our two drinks and fully understand that sometimes there are minimums and tables cannot be taken by smaller parties, but the way we were spoken to was acceptable. I should mention that the waitress was already clearing the table before we even put our jackets on. At least let us leave before you flip the table. As a food runner and busser myself isn't that a service industry standard? Clearly not even pretending to respect guests and their space. I should also mention that the waitress told us as we were putting on our jackets that ""it was your prerogative to get the manager."" Literally blaming guests that asking for a manager went south for us. I actually still said ""Thank you. Have a good night,"" before finally leaving myself.I ultimately feel like the manager and waitress were having more than bad days and honestly didn't want to deal with people of color on a Wednesday night. I hope others do not frequent this location, which to my understanding is a shame as Old Town Bar is one of the older bars still around. And taking the managers own words ""there are other places!"" Indeed there are. Old Town Bar should be avoided at all costs. My friends and I could have been customers at this bar for another 40 years had Old Town Bar manager and waitress provided better steps of service.",14,,

It still looks very Victorian, from the tin ceilings, to the Lincrusta wallpaper and the antique bar. Everything about the place is old, which makes it just perfect in my opinion. Food-wise, the smoked turkey Reuben is awesome. Also can't go wrong with mozzarella sticks. In terms of beer they have the standards on tap, including Sierra Nevada and Lagunitas IPA. They have a rotating seasonal tap, which recently featured Bell's Oberon. Having said that, it's not a beer-snob type of place. Down to earth, low key and one of my go-to Manhattan spots.",,,

Then I love you.Anyway, this place in particular holds fond memories for me, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get as close as they can to the 'old New York'.

63,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1372,384,370,4.0,5/12/2014,"I really liked Old Town and it may just be my new favorite place to grab a beer when in the Union Square area. The first thing you notice when walking in are the huge 20 foot ceilings -- I am no contractor but it was at least 2 stories tall -- along the old-style ceiling adornments, wooden and green colors with old, presumably original, fixtures that may have been brass or copper. It has a real old timey feel, but not in a divey or dirty way. It felt like this was a place where the classy men of the 30's would go.One of my favorite parts of the original decor was the Men's bathroom. When you go to a modern bar's bathroom, many times they try to pack in as many urinals as they can, leading to super small sizes. Sometimes it feels like you are trying to pee into a gatorade bottle! At Old Town, the bathroom has 2 HUGE porcelain urinals. These puppies are about 5 feet tall, 3 feet wide and go to the floor. They are also styled with fancy borders and such. It felt like peeing into a Cadillac.Grab a booth if you can, it's pretty cool to sit and look around the joint, but there is plenty of standing space around to hang out in. We grabbed a few pitchers of beer at reasonable prices, nothing special about the them but nothing wrong either. They came out cold and tasty as one would expect from good draft beer.",5,2,4

69,Natalie C.,"San Francisco, CA",351,1,0,1.0,2/8/2018,"I visited this establishment a few months ago with a friend and had a poor experience with my waiter who was a older white female. This was in the first 2 minutes of sitting down, so i moved to the bar and the bartender was pleasant and saved the evening. But last night my friend suggested we go here and I immediately remembered my last time being here and reluctantly agreed to go. AGAIN. SAME WAITER With the same nasty attitude all in the first 60 seconds of serving me. I am a young black girl and I immediately felt her negative energy. I was sitting in a booth. There had to be no more than 7 people in this bar/restaurant at the time. First thing she says is ""are you waiting for other people?"" I said yes they should be here shortly. She said ""well how long?"" I said..... ""shortly."" She says ""well if my boss comes down and sees one person taking up a booth ill get in trouble. I said ""well like i said... people will be joining me shortly"" After about 10 mins of awkward exchanges over drink recommendations, 1 of 3 of my guests shows up. Waitress comes back and gets her drink (with a smile now ill add) and says ""it's 10$ per person to sit here."" Mind you drinks are 7$ and up and we had already had one that was half empty so once the rest of my party arrived I'm SURE we would get another round. But anyway, something didn't seem right about that. So my friend asks one bartender and i ask another and neither of them said they knew anything about that policy. Mine said ""i don't do anything with the tables."" And on top of that i see nothing but parties of 2 in all of the surrounding booth. My friend and I are both people of color but she is white passing so I knew this was a race issue. I ask her to send the manager to our table in hopes that maybe he can explain this policy. This is where things REALLY went left. The manager who was old, white, and large immediately came over on the defense. He doesn't even ask what the issue is before rambling off about their ""policy"". He also refuses to address me directly. He's only looking at my friend and acts like I'm not even there. At this point another guest in my party shows up and is just stunned by the managers body language and behavior. My friend cuts him off and says ""hey, would you like to get our side of the story now?"" And he says ok and then I say ""And you can address me because I'm actually the one who called you over here."" He just starts SHOUTING at me going on and on but finishes with ""and if you don't like it, you can leave"" .... and I followed with ""gladly"". A simple discussion could have prevented this entire situation. As I'm collecting my belongings the waitress comes over in a scuff and starts clearing the table (of our two empty drinks I might add) as if to rush us out faster. It was just unbelievable and sad. This place is trash. Blatant racist trash, and I would discourage anyone from ever wasting your money there!",8,,

89,Rich R.,"Jonesboro, AR",10,514,2013,4.0,11/26/2011,"On the Esquire ""Best Bars in America"" list, this is a great place. Not a wide selection on tap and nothing special about the menu, still Old Town has a nice vibe, they must be doing something right to endure since 1892. Old Town is, old. It is a beauty, 16 foot ceilings and every surface lovingly adorned in wood. The legend of the giant urinals is true, 1910 is stamped on them (a short bio about these restroom relics is featured in the menu, how appetizing!)Our very leisurely group dinner at Old Town was accidental and we could not have asked for anything better. Seated at the back of the restaurant we were able to talk, watch the historic dumb waiters in operation and not feel any pressure to continue ordering or get out. I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a hurry, Old Town operates at an old world pace  like a restaurant in Italy, you'll get your check eventually but in the meantime just chill out and enjoy the setting.",3,2,3

91,Jamey M.,"Chicago, IL",1,16,0,1.0,5/15/2016,"Where to start. I am still completely flabbergasted at the way my friends and I were treated yesterday. I was in town from Chicago; my friend was in town from Atlanta. I wanted to hang in the Union Sq. area and we both had friends who live in NYC who wanted to meet up with us. Enter Old Town Bar. I sit down and order a Captain and diet. My friend asks what kind of ciders they have, the bartender says what it is, and describes it as a dry cider. My friend didn't want that, so she started with a water. My NYC friend showed up and ordered 2 vodka somethings. Her NYC friend showed up and ordered a water. My friend and I get an appetizer. So between the 4 of us, we've ordered 3 drinks and an app. The bartender swings by after a half hour and explains to the girls drinking water that if they want to sit at the bar they have to order a drink. I TOTALLY understand that, buuuuut he was a total dick about it and basically berated us. My traveling companion said, I tried to order a cider, and he yelled ""WE HAVE CIDER"" (but it was one my friend likes). So we said, okie dokie, we'll leave. My NYC friend and I cashed out, and I see that my teeny tiny Captain was $12. I get its NYC, but come on...and (more importantly) I'm super pissed at how he treated my friends, so I tipped him $1 and wrote on the check ""Highway Fucking Robbery"".  NOTE: I would NEVER had said anything if he hadn't been so incredibly rude to us. Also, please note, that both girls drinking water were going to tip him a few bucks for the waters. But after the way they were treated, there was no way they were going to leave any money. Soooo...the bartender takes our receipts, and as I'm walking out, he yells to me to ""go back to Kansas"". This was obviously in response to either the ""Highway Fucking Robbery"" comment or the $1 tip. Believe you, me...he's lucky he got $1. So I responded that I'm from Chicago and am used to jacked up prices, but he was a dick and that price was actually ridiculous. So he told me to go back to Chicago, to which I responded ""you obviously need to get laid"". A lot of this is not verbatim except for the ""go back to Kansas part"", and there was a lot more back and forth, but you get the point. That all could have gone way better, on both ends. But I didn't react until this bartender had already been rude to us a few times (basically...he started it! Whaaa). All I know is that I hope that bartenders life isn't as miserable as he made it seem. Oh! And I also know I will never...ever...go back to Old Town Bar. Which bums me out...it's a super great dive in NYC.... And I live in Old Town in Chicago. Alas...c'est la vie.",4,1,1

The spot looked great. Upon ordering my food . Never did I get my  appetizer that I requested. However I got my wings almost instantly awesome,right.this is what we orderedI tried there chicken wings I rate them 4/5. My girlfriend tried there chicken fingers a lil to much fat on them she said. Now there fries perfect. After the food was served and again I repeat I never got my cheese sticks. It went down hill ,could not get a refill right away keep in mind there were two empty tables by me. And here's the kick  it took without exaggerating over 25 min for a bill .

99,Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1565,364,209,4.0,6/29/2013,"Walking into this bar is like walking into a time machine and being transported back to Prohibition. It's an old speakeasy located right in the Flatiron district of New York City. It has also been in continuous operation since 1892! oldtownbar.com/index.htmlThe coolest part about this bar is sitting in the little booths along the sides of the restaurant and admiring the old newspaper clippings/photographs of celebrities visiting this place decades ago. They have maintained the structural integrity of the building and avoided to pressures the renovate. One nice addition that they HAVE made is they have added in a women's bathroom. It is so funny because that bathroom is definitely an afterthought. Just the awkward location gives this away. It's up the stairs on the second floor and behind the kitchen. It's a quaint reminder that ""back in the day,"" women weren't allowed in bars. Therefore, no women's room was needed.I also liked that there was an older man bartender. Not having 20-something college kids behind the bar added to the ambiance. We came here with a group of 10-15 rowdy softball players, and he encouraged us to have a nice time, and happily entertained our questions about the bar while making us plenty of ""house specials."" The house special was some killer fresh squeezed lemonades spiked with vodka, which was refreshing for a hot and sticky summer afternoon.",1,,6

From the soaring tin plated ceiling, to the old warn bar top, yellowed pictures and framed news articles pinned all around, to the pitted mirrors on the walls. This place definitely has a history. I wish those walls could talk.I actually like dropping in here for a later afternoon lunch, when it is quiet and I can use some ""alone"" time away from work. Walking in yesterday I encountered the sweet sounds of Morrissey playing overhead -bonus points for the 90's music selection they seemed to have on! Usually go for a cheeseburger here. Juicy on a soft bun, fries and pickle. Pretty basic but solid burger here. I instead went with the turkey reuben. Served hot on toasted rye bread - yum! Along with a Guinness this was an enjoyable lunch.Overall, they have decent menu of bar food selections, and the normal selection of bottle and draft beers.

Case and point was today when I stopped in for lunch. I ordered a tuna melt with fries and a cider in a can with a pint glass. The tuna melt was ok, but fries were cold. The real hum zinger was the $9.50 cider in a can that was terrible. I didn't realize it was that much until I got the bill (totally my fault). I asked the server for a water because the cider was really bad. He brought me the water and made no mention of the fact that i told him the drink was bad, and then brought me the bill, seeing that I did not drink any of the $9.50 cider.

My German beers, one of the only decent ones off the bottle list, were going for $8.50 a pop.  Yes, you read that correctly. If I opted for the absolute shittiest beer on the menu, they've banging me $5.50. This is re-DONK-ulous.  After we'd been there for a bit, a group of three men arrived and asked for a table. The waitstaff didn't ask if we would move but rather forced us from our table. And the obnoxious patrons stood over us, me in particular, until we found people to take their things.  No apologies, no appreciation for us giving up our space...Just obnoxiousness.  As a side note, at one point during the afternoon, a waitress trying to get through literally body checked me with not a word of ""excuse me"".  I encountered not one person who worked here that was even slightly suited to be in the service industry.  Would I come back? I think you know the answer to that...NO. I'll let someone else charge me ridiculous amounts of money for beer someplace where they at least pretend to be grateful for my business.",3,,

It was a short stop as it was nearing the end of the night, so I had only purchased one drink. When I asked to close my tab, the bartender curtly told me that it was a two drink minimum for credit cards.

Because that is at the bartender's discretion, and I'll keep your card until you can be accommodating"" I ended up leaving my card there to retrieve it the next day.  There's no reason for that, even if it is policy (which I have trouble understanding).  Disappointed in this place and we will not be going back.",1,,

Nothing has changed about this place in 100 years. The booths look like they date back to the 1890s, and the huge mirrors behind the bar are probably 100 years old as well. High ceilings and old time lighting make this place one of the most unchanged places in NYC. Truly an accomplishment for a family run bar to stay in the family and not change anything at all. I didn't ask the guy behind the bar if he was Merri's dad, but when he gave me my change back he dropped a 20, and then a few minutes later came and gave it to me, so whoever that fella was he is an honest fella.

If I had to come back, I wouldn't mind but I wouldn't plan a night specifically around this place. However, that all changed when I was heading towards the bathroom and discovered that Joss freakin' Whedon was sitting at a table near the entrance! Now I've seen celebrities before and didn't care one bit. I thought I was one to not get overly star struck. And then I saw Joss Whedon and that all changed. I didn't even make it to the bathroom cause I had to turn back around to freak out with my friend. Oddly enough my friend and I seemed to be the only people who realized or cared that the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was at the bar! I will admit that I bothered him. I just had to. At one point I saw him sitting by himself at the table so I just had to take my chance. Buffy was basically the greatest thing to have ever be on my TV. I grew up with that show.

Sure!  Were they ""fingers""? Um, sure!  Were the delicious? Um...Flo seemed to be bouncing around the dining area a lot with little or no purpose.  One trip to grab a saucer.  Another trip for a fork.  Was she all there?

I also thought the women's bathroom upstairs was weirdly not private... the chain lock on the door allowed it to be opened several inches even when someone was inside... granted, there was a separate saloon-type door for the stall with the toilet but since that one didn't have a lock, it still felt pretty exposed.

160,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",367,86,3,5.0,4/7/2014,"Okay, so I know that a 5-star rating for Old Town could seem a bit excessive considering the fact that I wouldn't use any superlatives to describe this bar.  It doesn't have the best design/layout, or the cheapest drinks, or the coolest bartenders, or the most awesome music.  But maybe the one thing that Old Town is best at is just not being exceptional at all.  Especially in a place like Manhattan, there is something nice about walking into a bar for the first time and feeling like you've been there before.Nearly everything about Old Town is familiar: the Irish Pub vibe; long & narrow floor plan; built-in wooden high-top bar covering one entire wall; dim, yellow-hued lighting from the old-as-f--k wall-mounted fixtures; Always Most Desirable booth seating; walls adorned with massive mirrors and random memorabilia; a somewhat-camouflaged room in the back of the bar furnished with wobbly, beat-up tables and chairs in whichever haphazard arrangement the last group left them in; bartenders who [at least seem to] have worked there for 30+ years, etc.Yes, I believe that there is a rendition of Old Town found in every single town and city in America - however, this bar has the distinct advantage of a just-north-of-Union-Square location, i.e., basically the center of the Universe.  My friends and I tend to use Old Town as our default meet-up location whenever we're coming from different places at slightly different times and/or no one can come up with an alternative plan.My one complaint is that the women's bathrooms are a bit rapey.  While the men's bathrooms are right off of the main bar, the women's bathrooms are upstairs via a separate back staircase.  Old Town has an additional dining room upstairs, but it is closed at night so the lights are off, but the kitchen is also upstairs.  So especially later on in the evening (9:00pm - 12am-ish) when the kitchen is still open but food orders are slow, there are always a bunch of cooks and busboys loitering around in this isolated dark area in front of the women's bathrooms.  Last time I was up there, a couple of them kept trying to get into the bathroom while I was inside, jostling the door and yelling repeatedly.  I will assume that the male kitchen staff typically use the women's bathrooms since they're right next to the kitchen, and they were probably just drunk and/or didn't realize anyone was in the bathroom (although that should be obvious if the door is locked) but still - every time I go upstairs by myself to use the restrooms, I get the sensation of walking through a dark alley by myself at night - as a small female, it's impossible not to feel a little bit vulnerable and uneasy.",5,1,1

The place is completely old school and has remained relatively unchanged throughout the years. The 16 or so high classic tin ceilings and 55 foot marble and wood bar and giant mirror behind the bar are not only impressive but combine to make the place feel extremely cold and cavernous.

It has a dumbwaiter which they still use! And, it's completely wooden down to the booths and bar.",2,,
183,Mariah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,16,1,5.0,10/13/2014,Stopped here quickly for a drink with my sister. The drink was strong and good! Will definitely go back to try the food,,,
184,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",758,1660,36,3.0,5/6/2010,"Yeah this place really is old town, without the riff-raffy feel of McSorley's.I had a becks... reliable.",,,
185,David B.,"West New York, NJ",0,18,0,2.0,1/14/2016,"Stopped in last night for some wings and beers.  First time to this place and nothing was exceptional so doubt I will venture back.  The place is VERY old which is cool, but you can tell it needs to TLC.  It could be so much better if the owner just invested some money into restoring it.  Probably the best part of the evening was the ice in the urinals in the bathroom.  That is not what should have been the highlight.  The Guinness was good, but then again how can you mess that up? We ordered wings which came out so fast they had to be wings that were cooked in advance and then just reheated in the fryer before serving them.  I have owned a restaurant and know how long it takes to cook wings.  3 minutes is NOT possible.  Anyway they were good but nothing to right home about.  They had a strange taste to them.  Almost like they were fried in oil that need to be changed out desparately.  If you are in the area stop in for a beer but find someplace else to eat.",,,
186,LeeLa B.,"Toronto, Canada",13,25,2,4.0,1/5/2016,Didn't eat here just had a drink. LOVE the decor! Will make this a regular stop on our trips to NYC. The music is great and it's got such a cool feel to the place. Love these kinds of spots.,,,
187,Travis C.,"Pennington, NJ",30,88,41,3.0,7/2/2012,"Go for the ambiance, good service, and a cool look. Nothing special about the beer selection, we didn't eat so I cant comment on the food. The staff actually let us in before opening since it was so hot outside, and they were attentive so thats a plus in my book.",,,
188,Jackie P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,4,0,4.0,1/29/2013,"The downstairs has a great, old-timey feel to it. Very classic! And perfect for happy hour or grabbing a quick drink with friends. We enjoyed dinner and drinks on the second floor, which was a bit quieter. They have a great selection of beers and bar food. The turkey burger was a bit dry, but the fries are fantastic and a friend said the bowl of chili was delicious. They're famous for their hot dogs!",,,
189,Eric B.,"Overland Park, KS",2,16,1,4.0,10/24/2015,Great little old feel bar and dive in the Union Square area. Classic wooden bar and a crowd that's dedicated to drinking. Food menu is fairly limited but it's a nice little stop in the area.,,,
190,Alex B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,0,3.0,8/28/2014,"Minus two stars because there are borderline hateful messages scrawled out in freehand and taped to the front windows.  It's possible they are just super ahead of the curve with respect to alternative comedy and unintelligible psychobabble is the medium of the future.  Also, I've never seen anyone hassled inside and, given the laid back vibe, wouldn't expect to.  Aside from the slightly off-color pseudo hate speech, this is a really nice place to have a drink.  Most importantly, Old Town's casual atmosphere can't be beat anywhere in the Union Square area.",,,
191,Sara R.,"Portland, OR",127,128,36,4.0,4/9/2014,Upstairs drinks and food.  My first hot totti and Apple totti.  Both were delicious.  The food was good but thats it.  The menu looked old and way outdated.  Guacamole & Chips was listed under 'Salads' hilarious.  I don't think they need to change anything.  Both upstairs and down was packed with patrons.  The ambiance is just wonderful.,,,
192,Stan G.,"Leicester, NC",122,302,91,5.0,11/16/2013,Classic bar with great selection. Meet your friends here. Device was attentive all night long with our group of 6.,,,
193,Bif P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,381,5,5.0,3/24/2014,"I've been coming here a few times a year for over 20 years and for some reason never wrote about it. Another great stop on the historic NYC tour. Great bar , professional cordial bartenders and staff and some of the best wings you'll ever have. Burgers are awesome as well.  It gets packed so if you want to really experience and check out the old time bar come early and walk around. I remember back in the day I'd spot the author Frank McCourt in here once a week. Old Town is no secret and you will bump into celebs, locals, frat guys out on the piss, large rowdy groups, quiet dates...everything. That's why I love it because the crowd always changes. I only hope they would update the beer choices though. The best on tap is Sierra Nevada, not a wide variety, imo.",,,
194,Kiki M.,"Seattle, WA",147,456,6,4.0,9/29/2010,"This is another bar on Esquire's ""America's Best Bars"" list under the ""Very Old Bar"" category. The summery of the bar states Old Town Bar is the oldest bar in New York. Old Town Bar is located on a rather desolate block surrounded by what I'm sure are other very old buildings. Very few drinkers were in the bar which is probably not unusual for Tuesday afternoon. I was relieved because I enjoy when a bar is empty. It is a dark bar, bigger than I would have expected equipped with an upstairs dining area that had stained glass windows. It was a cross between a church, Victorian living room, and upscale Irish bar from the 1800s. Lots of wood. A curious collection of interior designs, yes, but is hard for me to use one word to capture its essence. Despite its title of oldest bar in New York it looked fairly new. Maybe it gets a face lift every few years? The bartender handed me a menu and asked what I'd like. I asked what was on tap and he pointed to and explained each tap available. I decided to go with the seasonal ale which was a whopping $7.50. Damn, New York, your drinks are no joke. I browsed through the menu and it was your usual bar menu with lots of greasy deep fried fare, sandwiches, and burgers. I saw a few people munching on their dishes. One person had a tuna melt and another had buffalo wings. I sat and nursed my beer while I soaked up the ambiance.Old Town Bar deserves to be on Esquire's list. This is the perfect place to stop by for a beer whether you are flying solo or with friends. It looks dark and sinister as you walk in but welcomes you with history",5,4,5
195,Josh B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,17,0,2.0,2/5/2011,"Wtf happened to Old Town???  8 freakin 50 for a bottle of stella?  Wtf?  Seriously-  no need to come to NY's former speakeasy.   Petes tavern has better beer selections,  cheaper prices and nicer bartenders.   Oh yeah - $13 bones for a cheeseburger?   For $15 bones i can get a pat lafrida special at union square cafe- served by way nicer barkeeps.  Old town- get 'yo sh@t together and read the papers - there's a recession going on!  Hello?history/shmistory - you want history, take a bus tour, you want good eats at good value, go somewhere else.",1,2,1
196,Adam S.,"New York, NY",2,3,0,1.0,5/14/2013,"There was a roach crawling around on the bar, next to the clean glasses. The roach was killed there. Nothing it was crawling on or near was cleaned.Guess the ""Grade Pending"" in the window was for a reason.",1,,
197,Christopher C.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,9,0,3.0,1/19/2013,"The bar and restaurant are absolutely solid. It was a long wait for dinner upstairs and the food is pretty great. The buffalo burger has been my go to selection here. The bar is one to be revered indeed. The bar staff is amazingly attentive for such a hustled atmosphere. Three stars since it isn't an absolute wonder, but one could easily make this place a consistent watering hole if you live around Union Square.",1,1,1
198,Sharon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,53,2,4.0,11/27/2010,"I once warned a friend that this is the type of place where a cloud of history hits you in the face the minute you walk through the doors.  And it's true - this is a beautiful old bar that's been around and in continual operation for nearly 100 years.  I'd been before and had a pretty fun time, but I only sampled the food here today, and I must insist that these are perhaps the best burgers I've had.  They may even give Shake Shack a run for the money.   And you can't have a bloody mary with your burger at the shack either, so there's that.    They could use a couple of extra servers in the dining room (our waitress was a bit overwhelmed), but she was pleasant, so it was kind of forgivable.   We all had such a good time we plan to be back.  I just imagine it will be tough to avoid the douchebro set that no doubt loves it here.  But I won't let that keep me away from those burgers.    Also, it's a BAR.  Leave the kids at home, or take them to Goodburger.  Leave this place to the grownups - I don't want toddlers in my tavern.",2,1,
199,Julie P.,"New York, NY",82,23,7,5.0,6/28/2014,Fantastic find! Staff were great and loads of charm. We had the burgers on recommendation and were not disappointed. Would recommend to anyone that wants a good meal in a great place.,,,
