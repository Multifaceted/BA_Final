0,Cieanne E.,"Brooklyn, NY",157,128,244,4.0,7/8/2015,"So sad I no longer work right up the block from them. The breakfast sandwiches are the best in the area. I order variations of the same thing every time and the guy always asks ""pepper on the eggs...right??"" It's really cool considering they are taking tons of orders daily. In the year that I've been ordering here I've had one complaint and it was fixed quickly. As skeevy as buffets are and as much as I try to resist them Speedys always has some interesting options that I can't resist trying. Cauliflower in a red sauce (who knew!!). It's not the biggest place and it gets really crowded during peak breakfast and lunch hours. Those are the best times to know exactly what you want and just call for delivery. Delivery is speedy (pun intended) I've come here after some pretty late happy hour binges and ordered the Grilled Cheese with bacon and tomato deluxe with cheddar cheese of course. The simplest meal but sooooooo good!!!! Truly my weakness at Speedy's.",1,1,2
1,Tosh A.,"New York, NY",84,1,0,1.0,8/30/2018,"I walk by this spot everyday to work but I usually get breakfast from the coffee shop on my work's block. Felt like I needed a little change, so gave this a try. Order the usual coffee with bacon/egg/cheese bagel.Coffee 1/5The barista/cashier asked me I needed milk (not room) and poured it for me (it was behind the counter by the coffee, WHAT!). Regardless, coffee tastes like the cheapest leftover batch that nobody who actually likes to drink coffee would try.Bacon/egg/cheese bagel 0/5Quite a few customization options here so you could get any combination. However, I can't imagine a busy spot like this in a prime location would use super fucking shitty wonderbread kind bagels. It looked, felt and tasted like bread - not bagel.To each their own, and by all means serve all of this but keep your prices to reflect what you're selling.Another reason I hate tourists - helping such businesses thrive.",,,

I don't know if I got lucky but I enjoyed both my orders of food from here. Sure it's expensive but the 10 piece nugget meal from the McDonalds on 6th avenue is the same price. Plus if you sit upstairs,They will bring your food to you and you can wash your meal down with free water. You definitely can't beat that in Herald Square.",2,2,2
3,Kylie L.,"New Providence, NJ",3,66,1,3.0,9/29/2018,"As its name suggests, this place is nothing but speedy. Throngs of hungry tourists pass by this intersection everyday. And they have just the right foods: salads, sandwiches, cookies, ice cream, and a hot & cold buffet. Seating is available upstairs.They have these amazing sweet and powdery Greek butter cookies (kourabiedes) which crumble in your mouth. At $14.95/lb, they don't come cheap. Just be careful if the cash register guy stiffs you on the change or quotes you a price without weighing them (happened to me!).The hot buffet could have more options, especially during dinner time when there's only mashed potatoes or fried chicken left. For a 24-hour place, they should consider replenishing the buffet items. Favorites: mac & cheese, Greek saladPrice: $10.99/lb + tax",,,

I had to repeat my order to him three times because he kept forgetting/ misunderstanding. The barista who served me spent most of the prep time talking to someone across the room than actually making my drink, spilled some of it, and wiped the cup with a dingy looking rag. The barista next to him managed to serve two full orders with much more food and drinks than me in the time it took him to process my order. Not super great service but the food was okay.",,,

But at 4am, you begin to get desperate, so I decided to give it a try.Decent cup of black coffee. Of course there are better in the city, but there are far worse. It is also open 24 hours on every day except for Sunday and Monday, which makes Speedy's incredibly convenient when you just need that late night coffee.This place is a holy grail for people who missed trains or have an upcoming deadline.",2,,

They have a nice selection of pre-made sandwiches,wraps and salads as well as made to order. I have had a few of the wraps, the medi-tuna wrap was the best so far with tuna,olives,capers and peppers. The turkey and avocado with jicama was also pretty good. The only one I didnt care for was the salmon with lime ginger dressing because there was no dressing. Not sure if they were supposed to add it in the package or onto the sandwich or if the counter ladies were supposed to give it to me but either way it was way too dry. All of the wraps were very fresh and the cashiers are all very friendly.",2,2,1

15,Nikk B.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,54,2,1.0,4/7/2017,"Worse $15 of my life spent on lunch. The salad was actually decent (fresh produce and protein) but I encountered the rudest, most belligerent cashier here. She rang my items and when I asked about ice for my drink and she quoted the price, I reluctantly agreed to add on. I loathe when places charge exhorbitant amounts for things like plastic cups and frozen tap water, and particularly when you're already spending a premium to eat.So cashier proceeds to push me and my tray along when I asked for the second time about my ice. To which she practically yelled, ""you told me no!"" I calmly let her know that I requested ice which she of course never rang, and proceeded to handle me with an attitude as a result of her mistake. No big deal, right? She finally rings the ice purchase, yells to an employee across the room in Spanish to fetch the ice, then again pushes my tray out of the way. At this point I am highly irritated and voice it to her. I expressed that she was rude. Her reply: ""YOU are rude!"" What?! In what universe do we live? It took everything in me to not jam my tray with food into her person and then demand my money back. The nerve! After eating, I located and coached the alleged ""manager"" on the art of customer service and advised that his employees should be thoroughly trained. I also alerted him to the fact that I would be writing a negative review here. Listen, even if I worked a 12-hour day and this was the only place open (with no groceries at home), I would not step foot in this place again. Blech.",5,1,

21,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1044,25525,3.0,1/30/2015,"Speedy's is your typical, mediocre, meh midtown deli. I came here with my friend (and fellow Yelp Eliter) Danielle P. for late night munchies after we attended a digital media/tech networking event. It was snowing when we went in and thus my scarf was covered in snow flurries which I was shaking off (shake it off! shake it off!) with my hands - upon entering a man came up to me to ""help"" me get the snow off of me, he basically touched my coat right where my breasts were. I hit his hand, used an expletive and gave him a look that if I was on American Horror Story Coven would have turned hi into a bonfire right then and there.So my friend and I each ordered egg and cheeses sandwiches on toasted, buttered rolls and waited awhile for them to be made. The guy who harassed me earlier said something inappropriate to me and then accused me of not having a sense a humor. At this point, he's not worth my wasting words on so I shoot him another ""if looks could kill"" glare. Each of our sandwiches came out to practically $4 which is higher than your average deli price, but we're in midtown and this place seems like a tourist trap anyway. I think it would have been nice for one of their employees to have done something when I was harassed by that moron, not because it's someone else's responsibility to look out for me, but because I was a customer and this was occurring on their property. This alone tempts me to give them a 2 star rating based on my experience, but our sandwiches were tasty and they gave us each (after I asked) a little container filled with Tapatio Hot Sauce which sent the flavor of our breakfast sandwiches to new heights...so 3 stars.",2,1,3

We got the chicken noodle soup, a few hot dish options, and a salad. Again, all the food was pretty good, but all of that (soup and a split single plate of salad and hot food) with a soda was $24. The plate wasn't even filled ($9.99 per pound, I think?). Honestly though, it was the cashier that got to me- she threw my soda on the counter after knocking it over, causing it to explode later when I opened it. She was also rude when I went to the counter to pay. I wouldn't say I wouldn't come back, but there are things they can work on.",1,,1

You kinda know by the location that its going to be pricey, but you would think they would keep the buffet a little fresher because of its location too. They have commuter coming by all day so why not yak the time to freshen up the salmon? Make sure the lettuce isnt wilting? The chicken hasn't completely dried out under the heat lamps? No one likes wilty, dry, old food. Their salads also seem DRENCHED in dressing. Its kinda overkill. If they just kept the staples - simple grilled chicken, tuna, fresh veggies, etc - then it wouldn't be half bad, but for the price i wish they would rotate the food more.",,,

31,Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,12,1,1.0,8/6/2015,"I am the kind person who never leaves a bad review, even if the service is really bad. I understand places have off-days. Speedy's is a go-to because are close to my office - not because they're particularly good or anything. The coffee and food are okay, even if everything is very overpriced.Today is the day I stop going. The cashier argued with me for about six minutes because she poured me a hot coffee when I asked for an iced coffee. This is a non-issue, because anyone else would correct the mistake by pouring you a new coffee and charging you the difference. However, this cashier decided just to argue with me saying that I asked for a regular coffee because there is no way in the world that she may have misheard me.I didn't mis-speak, but even if I did - who cares? I don't want it. Pour me a new one, and I will give you more money. Transaction ended. Or just give me a cup of ice for God's sake!Instead, she continued to argue that I didn't say ""iced"", shoved the receipt in my face because that's factual evidence that I was wrong because obviously *I* typed ""hot coffee"" into the register, and she refused to make me a new one.I was so mad and hate this kind of confrontation, I so I told her to keep her coffee and walked out without even getting a refund. I couldn't even open that can of worms, oh lord.Moral of the story: I hated that I went to Speedy's to begin with since it's a waste of money, but now I have a definitive reason to not go there any more. This kind of drama over the sale of coffee?F this place.",3,3,
32,David C.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,2,5.0,8/10/2016,"Speedys is amazing. I come here pretty often (like 4x per week). It's conveniently close but that's not why I go there. I go there because the food always tastes phenomenal. It's nothing like the surrounding delis that always have the same menu--believe me I've tried them all. So let's see, the chicken is always season and cooked perfectly. It's soft and tender and swimming in all the carefully picked seasonings they use. And it's never the same--they switch up the menu every day. You can literally go everyday and not eat the same thing. The London broil--Jesus! It's GREAT. Again, always season right and never overcooked. The beef is always soft and it literally falls apart in your mouth. It doesn't feel like your eating rubber like the nearby places. The rice selection, where do I start? They always have different types (at least 2 out everyday) but my favorite is the vegetarian rice--it has mushrooms, etc and tastes amazing. ""Arroz con pollo"" is also a good one. A lot of people here will complain about the price per pound, even though it's not drastically different than surrounding places. What you get is fresh, delicious, well-cooked food, everyday of the week and that's something worth paying for!",3,1,

But me and my girlfriend stopped by for some soup and some other hot food. They had a salad bar and hot food bar. We had the cream of broccoli soup 8.00 for 16 oz. It was so watered down and was not worth it. We also had the hot buffet food for $9.95 per pound. We had the roast chicken, broccoli, salmon, mashed potatoes, and chicken fingers. The hot food was actually not bad and satisfied our taste buds. I think the wraps and sandwiches would be a good choice here expecially since they make hot orders.

It's freaking $10/lb.Every visit, their cold food / salad bar is fresh (trays just put out) with simple and clean options. I always get the honey mustard chicken and their garlic bread (aka, giant crouton). Their pesto chickpea, bean salad, pesto pasta, Mediterranean salad, etc have always tasted light and clean to me.

They usually have a good selection of interesting salads in the middle section, and there's a decent selection for the make-your-own salad section.

When I walked in the salad bar was closed so I decided to get the sandwich. Ordered the chicken sandwich, they took almost 10 mins to prepare that sandwich.

Shows the magnitude of my intellectual abilities.Speedy's has variety and quality OR did I just dupe myself into thinking that for the past year. Ready made sandwiches and salads that are available for less than ten dollars. If you're desperate and really, really and TRULY in a rush, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise, you have so many other options were you can better invest your money.In my previous life (pre-YELP) when I was very naive and didn't know any better, I would purchase breakfast here almost every day and sometimes lunch several times a week. I'll confess, it was very decent (hot/cold buffet is very healthy) but I knew it was overpriced in the back of my mind. Of course, I was already ensnared in the web of this tourist trap.Over time, I learned to grow and mature and realize, there is more to life than Speedy's. Their smoothies are very delicious and very filling for a post-gym workout but there is still this love-hate relationship that lingers. It's strategically placed so, I can't help but stare at its allure once I emerge from the train station each and every single day.It's inevitable, this spell will never be broken however, the most important thing is that I know how to get my money's worth.",3,5,3

I checked my tea before leaving and saw that they didn't put it in and I had paid for it already so I told the guy and he just took it, put one thin lemon slice in and gave it back without saying sorry. this place is always crowded and so hectic and barely any space to walk around. hope you aren't claustrophobic!",,,

A lot of people take their food upstairs to eat, which means they're doubling back from the cash registers while others are trying to pay.

73,kim r.,"Manhattan, NY",1,36,2,2.0,7/14/2016,"I work at Macy's and go to Speedy's every day to grab breakfast before heading to the office. First, the positive: I ordered my team a catered breakfast from Speedy's on Thanksgiving this past year, because we were working @ the office for the Parade. The delivery team was fantastic. They were on time, quick, extremely friendly, and even helped us set up the dishes and the burners. Two thumbs up to that team for working hard and being so nice on what is typically a holiday for many people.Next, the negative: the shorter woman who works the register during the morning rush is miserable and unfriendly, to the point of rudeness. She rolls her eyes at customers, walks away from the register if she doesn't want to help you, and never says hello or thank you. After the 100th time of being treated rudely by her this morning, I've decided to spend my money elsewhere. Speedy's management would do well to conduct a customer service training with their checkout staff; otherwise I anticipate they'll continue to lose business - there's plenty of delis in this neighborhood.",,,

They also have desserts and even smoothies! Upstairs there is plenty of seating and you also get a nice view overlooking Midtown and Herald Square. They are decently priced considering the area.

I also thought about getting a drink too - when I saw that they were charging $3.50 for a Vita Coco I could not bring myself to do it.",,,

105,Pallavi B.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,279,139,3.0,6/18/2012,"Went there to the DMV office and by the time we got over with the official work it was brunch time already.Religiously, my husband promptly yelped and this place called Grace popped up at 17 W, 32nd street. We trotted over only to found that place is now closed or it was so inconspicuous that we were not able to locate it. So we tried to give Speedy's a try as we have walked past it. My husband ordered classic ham sandwich and I ordered the fresh mozzarella sandwich and sat in the park outside to enjoy our meal.We also ordered coffee and chamomile tea to go with it.My sandwich was tasty and filling and had fresh ingredients. My husband was a little disappointed as the person didn't put fresh mozzarella in his sandwich and put another cheese instead.We might go back in case we are in the neighborhood but won't go especially to eat there.",,,
106,Heather M.,"Weehawken, NJ",13,40,0,4.0,5/8/2012,"Speedy's is much like a bustling beehive. I'll never forget seeing it for the first time when my current employer's office moved to Midtown. I was frightened by the piranha-like customers and the loud, inhuman yelling of, ""NUUEEXT! NUUEEXT!"" One of the first times I braved the crowd and bought lunch I was appalled by how unfriendly and rushed the environment seemed plus how pricey most everything was. I didn't return for quite some time. That was almost 3 years ago now and I've been buying breakfast and lunch here so often I'm a little embarrassed every time I walk in. It literally takes practice to get used to Speedy's and know how to handle yourself while ordering food, dishing food out for yourself from the buffet with other people's limbs all over the place, knowing where the two lines are, and keeping your ears perked for one of the cashiers to yell, ""NEXT!"", from either your side or the opposite side in case the other line of customers cleared out faster than the one you're standing in. I've been to my fair share of delis around this area of Manhattan and Speedy's buffet is the most impressive--taste wise that is. Be careful with the dense solid foods (i.e. cherry tomatoes, potatoes) because they will drive your buffet lunch price up an extra $4 with each plop into your container (I might be exaggerating but it feels like at least a few bucks). It's about $9 per lb. I believe for the buffet.Their pre-made sandwiches are okay but too much money in my opinion. Oftentimes I'll end up gnawing on the hard bread like a dog with a bone (I think this has only happened with the baguette type of bread). I prefer their paninis--although the last one I ordered wasn't cooked long enough to make all the roasted chicken warm inside.If you want something quick and cheap their soups with a bun are good.Their pre-made salads are decent but so expensive--just under $10. I love the Cobb Salad.My favorite thing here is the breakfast buffet. Great variety and tastes good. Except for the oatmeal. I've only had the oatmeal with fruit in it...never again. I'm addicted to their little breakfast burritos. I wish they had a small egg white version though because of that reason. I'm starting to get worried about my cholesterol from all the fatty yoke. I appreciate having the option to grab just a few pieces of fruit to include with my breakfast since they always have some pineapple or strawberries for the choosing.I've been religiously ordering a Café au lait each morning the past few months. I had a Café au lait from a more ""fancy"" place nearby and it wasn't as lovely as Speedy's version.I have never tried their sweets after all this time shockingly. They look tasty, I should treat myself one of these days.I suggest giving Speedy's at least a few tries before running for the hills. It's worth it after awhile!",,,

So far, so good- it seems to be frequently maintained for freshness, and the selections have been tasty- salmon, three-bean salad, wild rice are among the things I like so far.The service is efficient, and the workers are friendly enough. My one ding is probably price: I'm not too thrilled with paying $9.50 for a pound of food.

Updated review","OK, when i'm wrong, i admit to it. so here comes the big admission: speedy's isn't THAT horrible. sure, it's still expensive, and it's no gourmet eats. but for breakfast, it will suffice. the trick is to not actually GO there, but to proceed directly to work, pick up the phone, and then order whatever it is that your little stomach desires (in my case, it is usually a spinach, mushroom & american cheese omelet with roasted potatoes and dry whole wheat toast). within a reasonable amount of time (on average, 15-20 minutes), someone will arrive at your office and deliver said meal. the quality of the ingredients is decent, meaning i'm not picking through my eggs going, ""will this kill me? salmonella, do i want to engage you?"" i have yet to get sick from eating here, and that says a lot since my stomach is a picky brat that way.by the way, said breakfast is 6.50 (not including tip) which is a bit pricy but you know what? i'm worth it.",3,2,1

I call Speedy's the Leslie O. trap.  I think their buffet is delicious but SO PRICEY, even in comparison to the whole foods buffet.  I think it's $10/lb, regardless of whether you are getting a salad or salmon.  Their cold pasta salads are good.  The white bean salad is my favorite.  I always take a little bit of everything when I'm at a buffet and everything I've tasted here was good but I warn you again, you will be a little shocked the first time and walk out hungry every other time.Tip: There's a large seating area upstairs.",,,
114,Shea D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",109,547,88,4.0,10/29/2010,"I was in the market for a ""healthy"" lunch alternative to the usual fare since I'll probably be consuming about 3000 calories worth of BBQ food and margaritas tonight after I meet up with friends. I ran a 5K this morning before work and plan on doing a 10K tomorrow, so lets just say that my metabolism is on fire, and we can also just say that Speedy's was my third meal of the day (and it's only 2:34pm).Our staff attorney suggested that I try out the grilled salmon at Speedy's, and it would be an understatement to say that I was skeptical. Are you kidding? Good salmon? Next to Herald's Square? You're lying.But with no other prominent alternative, I decided I'd at least walk over and check out what she was talking about. I've spent my morning on interstate divorces and women fleeing Pakistan, so I've earned the right to a more expensive than normal lunch. Speedy's didn't disappoint in that arena: $8.95 a pound for the hot and cold buffets! Now, I can understand why some people might be upset paying $8.95 for a salad or chicken fingers (reviews below), but if you end up paying $7.97 for almost a pound of salmon and rice, that's actually a pretty good deal. Clearly, the devil's in the details here on what you should get.The buffet is small, but you can find some good stuff. Service was also very quick (though getting ""next"" shouted at me on hyper-quick repeat is kind of annoying). I also liked that this place didn't have the nasty super deli smells that a lot of other places around here have. There seems to be a soup and sandwich area, coffee counter, and fridge in here as well.Back at my office, I cracked open the container and the moment of truth had arrived: whoa, this piece of grilled salmon slid apart easily, it's juicy, and it *tastes* good? This must be a dream. The rice doesn't stick together and is filling? What planet am I on? Post-meal, I am feeling nice and full for the first time all day, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I managed to find something a bit healthier than the normal lunch options around my office. Now bring on the BBQ food and margaritas! Oh, and interstate divorce cases. :-/",2,1,1
115,Chris B.,"Boxborough, MA",0,23,0,4.0,12/28/2012,"Walked over to Speedys right off the train at Penn Station. Placed was packed, of course.  It was about 12:15 on a weekday. Nevertheless we got our trays filled pretty quick, paid at the counter, and headed upstairs for a table. Not many open seats but we got five together in the middle and the tables turn over very quickly anyway. Great food. Mary had a huge collection of salads (ETL) and I got the vegan pea soup. Fantastic. I went back down and got a non-dairy smoothie to go. The girls got a gigantic pain au chocolat and a cinnamon muffin and juice. They're not following Eat to Live. Gran got a salad and a muffin. She can't resist the pastry, but she gets her veggies in first. Fast service, huge selection, not too pricey...what's not to love here?  Forgot to mention freshness!  Very rejuvenating after the train ride.

116,Sara U.,"New York, NY",16,97,0,2.0,9/29/2010,"It gets 2 stars because it literally is across the street from my job, and there is nothing else around.

As someone else mentioned, I got 2 chicken tenders and a few pieces of diced potatoes, and it was over $10.00. The grilled cheese there is $5! It's literally 2 slices of Wonder Bread and a slice of Kraft cheese. It does not take $4 worth of labor to make a sandwich consisting of less than $1 ingredients.The place is chaotic (a salad-bar type set up in the middle of the cash registers and the line for sandwiches), and I swear I never make it out of there without a new bruise.I really hate Speedy's, but I know I will end up back there someday again when I don't feel like walking far to get some food.",1,1,3

If your a company and want catering, better to call several times as they forget to place the order with the kitchen, so you have to call an hour ahead of time, and yes they will be late with it.Stressful dining, stressful period.

I'm usually rushing to work in the morning and this place is small, yet organized with efficient cashiers. I like these kind of  ""grab and go"" places.It's a very tiny deli on the corner. It's buffet-style, so you grab a tray and choose out of plenty of options for what you're in the mood for. I only stopped in during breakfast-time and there were so many choices. One side is hot food where you could ask them to make eggs, sausage/bacon, pancakes etc.. basically any hot breakfast food you want. I was looking at some of the trays and it all looked so good.In the middle is the bakery-type stuff. Fresh bagels, muffins, croissants, danishes. Everything is truly FRESH! That's what I really loved about it. There's also a frig section with fruit cups, yogurt parfaits, etc.There's four or five cash registers with full coffee bar areas where you could have your favorite blend, many types of teas or even a smoothie. The pastries up front always look irresistible!Tea is my morning pick-me-up of choice. A large tea runs $1.50 which is more affordable then my usual D&D purchase. Overall, the prices are acceptable and not over the top. Thanks to Speedy's I'm actually a more tolerable morning person.FYI- they also offering catering services.",,,

Being one of the wandering and vague tourists (that the locals avoid) myself, I could hardly complain about the customer base, as other reviewers have. I do admit that their prices are not modest. I was wondering if that was my out-of-town perspective, but I see that some locals noticed the same thing. For fast food, it is a bit pricey. With that said, for fast food it's really, really GOOD!I'm on a kick recently of fruit-only breakfasts (our two visits here were both for breakfast), but the fruit and fruit juice were really fresh and yummy. I noticed that my dining companion's omelette and breakfast sandwich both looked really good (and were made to order). The self serve food bars looked awesome. The baked goods made me drool.The staff was friendly. They clear up very quickly. While it gets a trifle warm upstairs, it is very clean and not too crowded. There's no table service, but it's not hard to get some hot sauce or seasoning brought to you if you require it. Honestly, the latté could have been a little better, but I have high standards in that department.

It's like a deli/salad bar with everything charged by wieght. It's just that there are no signs or hint of a system in this place! Unless you work here or are a local regular customer you just cram in here and wander about the isles trying to work out what to eat.Don't get me wrong, the salad bar is great and easy to reach, and the soups are good. But the hot (well really lukewarm) food section is tiny and badly laid out. Even the menu is a bit wonky. The only solid dish was chicken and roast potatoes. But otherwise there was basmati rice (but no curry), a bread chicken something in sauce and nothing but mashed potato to go with it...oh, may be sauteed veg too. But then there was salmon, green beans and steak?!Don't get me started on the check-out counters. Horrid in a rush. And the dining room upstairs is worse than an unloved franchised McDs.

The thing you'll hear most while you're in there is the cashier yelling ""NEXT!!"" on repeat.Other possible names for Speedy's should include the following:Obnoxious's -- That's due to the crowd and aforementioned shouting cashiers.Expensive's -- That's due to their high prices. Two chicken fingers, some mashed potatoes, and a side of Greek salad: $12. Ouch.Blah's -- That's because their food is all quite edible, but not anything special. Blah.Lucky's -- That's because they are lucky there aren't other better options in the immediate vicinity.

That beats a fat-ridden Starbucks frappe any day, though I'm sure there's still a pile of calories hidden in Speedy's drinks as well, considering they use a MOUNTAIN of the frozen yogurt when they're preparing it for the blender.The food here is alright. It's your typical hot breakfast/lunch/dinner buffet style deli-ish place, though I think the quality is a bit higher than most delis in general. It's somewhat more expensive too, but you kinda come to expect that from a place that pretends to look like an ""organic foods"" venue, but really isn't. (Honestly though, *nobody* should charge that much for a container of melon pieces.) It's pretty clean, and they have a nice upstairs seating area overlooking Greeley and Herald Squares.Be warned though, if you come here during rush hour and common workplace mealtimes. The place gets PACKED, and because the main floor is so cramped and ill-arranged with that damn buffet table blocking traffic (Feng Shui anyone?), the line tends to curve around itself and out the side door, leading to a lot of line-cutting, pissed-off customers, stepping on toes, cursing, and general rudeness, which definitely isn't fun at 8:45 in the morning.",4,1,1

Speedy's is by far the best quality we have encountered.  Unlike many other places, the ingredients are FRESH and the food is well seasoned.  If you get it ""for here"" they even bring your meal to you at their upstairs seating area. We also appreciated that they have three choices of sauce (including a delicious seasoned mayo) to put on your meal in their eating area. It may cost $1 more than their competition, but it is well worth it.  If you are staying anywhere near 32nd and Broadway, this place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",,,

You'll pay a little more, but its worth it because of their salads. Or that's why I like it--cold noodle salads, cucumber, feta, olive salads, etc you get the point.

I always see them rotating out the food in the salad bar so it always seems to be fresh and I think its super tasty. Coworkers seem obsessed with their breakfast but I've never personally ordered it.  I also love the petite cookie 2 packs at the registers and their coffee is good.

You can either take-out or eat upstairs (although I always take-out and I'm not sure how the seating exactly works or how much of it there actually is). I like it here because, for the most part, they serve/sell healthy food. And delicious, healthy food. I loveee their soups. I can't remember the name but they have this bean soup that is out of this world. Oh and they always come with a roll at no extra cost (which I like because it reminds me of Panera Bread, mmm) Also I've been dying to try a turkey sandwich from the deli counter.. they just look so fresh (how many delis can you say that about in NYC?)! The employees are quite friendly which always adds to the place and it is always kept clean. The only downside... between the hours of 12-1pm it becomes quite the madhouse (which is why I primarily choose to bring my food back to the office).",1,,1

This place is a reminder of why I bring my lunch to work 90% of the time. In search of a healthy quick meal, I stumbled into Speedy's, lurred by the lime green awnings and promise of ""fresh"" food. I saw that they had a self-serve cold food bar with what looked like a pretty good 3 bean salad. The Greek salad also had some tasty look olives and cheese.  I filled a container with a moderate amount (not a TON by any means, but not skimpy) and was alarmed beyond measure when it rang up to $17!!!!!!!!!!!!! FOR MAINLY BEANS! I think even the cashier felt bad for me when she saw my jaw hit the counter as she kept offering me ""extra"" salt and pepper. After swearing to live on Ramen the rest of the month, I thought that perhaps this would at least be a darn good lunch. NO! It was an oily, mushy mess! The cheese was dry and salty, the olives weren't pitted, the tomoatoes had no flaver, the peppers were dripping in oil and the beans were tasteless and soggy. GROSS! I will NEVER go here again.",,,

The inside of the diminutive deli has no logic, so it's a mishmash of people waiting in line to pay, waiting in line for soup, hunting for drinks, fighting against the grain to go upstairs etc. The food is enh. The chips are always stale when you buy the pre-prepared sandwiches. Dear Speedy's,If you put chips, in a case with a damp sandwich, the chips will absorb the moisture, and take on a rather non-chip like consistency.Sincerely,AaronOn the bright side, I give it a two, because at least you will always get a seat if you do go here and buy lunch.

Expensive? Yes, definitely. But, you would expect higher prices for food that is fresh, well made, and high quality. Speedy's is IT. This is no run of the mill deli that is on every corner in M'hattan, with their tired old hot and cold food that tastes like it is made in one big warehouse somewhere... Speedy's food tastes like it is thought out and prepared by chefs. The breakfast bar is killer, love the turkey sausage and mexican omelette, and the quesedillas. The lunch is even better - with as many healthy and delicious choices as one could conjure. As we speak I am chewing filet mignon! On a LUNCH BAR? In MANHATTAN? Unheard of. And a seafood pasta that actually contained REAL shrimp and mussels - not to mention fried calamari. Speedy's is the BOMB. It's not an every day thing, only because I am too busy trying every Korean spot on 32nd St - but it is DEFINITELY a tried and true favorite!",,,
