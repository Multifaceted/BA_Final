2,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,3.0,7/16/2016,"The name alone, as a gay man, was reason to pop into this deli.  I love a good basket, who doesn't really? and Le basket packs the goods, with a sprawling buffet ranging from Chinese stir frys to latin tostones to fruit.  I picked up 3 meatballs, a tostone - fried banana cake, a large meaty piece of avocado, a few Brussel sprouts and voila ! - I had a sensible fast lunch with a soda for under $6.   Meatballs were fresh and tender in a gravy, brussels crunchy and flavourful.  It's not gourmet but its cheap and can be healthy for on the go.  3 small tables in the back give you a chance at quick dining.  The space is comfortable and clean.  Sandwiches made to order Buffet - the price per pound wasn't advertised, but I'm assuming it was under $7 a pound.In summary - a clean deli with good prices where you don't have to wait.",5,4,2
3,Brian R.,"Queens, NY",205,351,134,4.0,4/1/2016,"This is a great spot to grab some breakfast in the morning.  I use to stop in here almost daily for bacon egg and cheese on a bagel.  This is a pretty solid breakfast sandwich and the best that I have found in the area.  The bacon is always nice a crispy.  Just the way I like it.  The cheese is melted just right and the bagel is toasted perfectly.  For only $3.50 this is a great buy.The best part about this place is the guys behind the counter.  They are always friendly and quick.  This place can get pretty busy in the morning, but they are always on top of it.  The one guy always remembers me no matter how long it's been since I've last been there.  He has my bagel in the toaster as soon as he sees me.  This is pretty impressive considering how many people roll through here each day.  This man deserves a raise.",1,,1

5,Kaitlyn R.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,26,45,5.0,6/20/2016,"I had a brief argument with a coworker about whether the star rating for Delis mean anything on Yelp because most people would only review casual bodega-like places when they have a bad experience. I would expect to get and do exactly get a sandwich when I go to a Deli.I did, in fact, receive the sandwich that I ordered and it was a reasonable price. Therefore, this no-frills Deli that has a solid selection and combo options as well as a prepared foods bar, gets a 5 star from me. Hopefully my review will boost their rating because there is definitely a lack of casual food counters in NoHo.",2,2,2

13,Sheldon S.,"New York, NY",551,189,85,4.0,3/14/2014,"Le Basket is a small convenient store with deli (meats, hot/cold sandwiches made to order), hot bar, flower stand on side of store, and other normal convenient store goodies. Outside the front of the establishment on the sidewalk along Broadway is an area gated off to dine. There are metal chairs and tables under a retractable awning. There are also three metal tables with a few chairs crammed in a back corner in the interior of the store if one wants to flee the busy street or rain that may be outside. The store can get very crowded during lunch times but the staff manages to get everyone out and on their way quite quickly.Le Basket is my go to stop for a quick meal around lunch on many days during the week. I always go for the hot bar as soon as the food is placed out. In spite of its small size, the bar has a nice selection with just enough variety. Additionally, you'll be hard pressed to find a better priced hot bar around, at least that I know about anyway.",3,1,2
14,Max A.,"Prospect Park, NJ",4,12,2,1.0,9/5/2015,This place is absolutely disgusting. They have had the same exact food on their buffet for three days (I've checked.) the staff is incredibly lame and unable to help in anyway. They also mark up their drink 2.50 above everyone else in the area.,1,1,
15,Roman P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,83,0,4.0,4/29/2014,"Le Basket is a sort of dime a dozen delicatessen with a few extra perks that makes it notable. The location is great for NYU students, SOHO techies, and the hordes of tourists who love shopping for over-priced pants. It's only real draw during the day is the slightly quirky salad bar with plenty of options like asparagus, bok choy, stuffed tofu, avocado slices, and grilled mushrooms. There is also a hot food section where you can get a variety of fried meats and seafoods. The sandwiches that they make are quite large and loved by many a cheap NYU student.Another interesting thing about this place is that it functions as a bar during the summer months. Because you can get beer there and because there is outdoor seating at the front, this place is ideal for drinking 40s and people watching. The food is admittedly not incredible, but it is good enough for the price. The service is generally good and because so many people shop here, there is turnover. This ain't worth going to if you live and work in Midtown, but if you work in the area, it is worth trying for lunch.",,1,
16,Luxe T.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,1/3/2016,I order avocado+extra avocado with bacon on seamless. It took an hour for a sandwich and they gave me white bread sandwich with ham. I called them to resend and they never did. Slow and bad service. How hard is that send out the order?,,,

19,Tekwar T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,91,2,4.0,1/9/2014,"I've been coming here for years for their buffet spread. They have a wide assortment of veggies and hot food. Most of it really good, such as the tomato/avocado salsa, steamed broccoli/carrots, chinese pork, sweet plantains. However, whoever works the kitchen isn't always consistent. Sometimes an item that is great one day, was not executed well the next. For instance, the salmon fillets will be perfect one day, and the next it tastes funny. Or some days the plantains are too mushy or the avocados have black spots on them. Despite the quality control issue, if you come here several times you'll recognize which items to avoid on that particular day. Also note, they make sandwiches which I haven't tried and they sell flowers around the corner of entrance.",,,

22,Leila V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/13/2016,"We went into a deli at midnight looking for a snack and tea. We entered to find a place that had nowhere to sit, and two sullen men scowling behind the register and deli counter. We realized there were no hot beverages or welcoming spirit to be found. We looked at each other, wondering if we should buy a snack and head out, and how to plot our next moves. As my guy friend was scrolling on his phone, Angry Man (AM) #1 aggressively barked at my friend asking if he was going to order something. AM #1 did not make eye contact or acknowledge me, a woman. My friend said no. He then told my friend that we needed to get out, since we could only be in the store if we were customers. This man never even looked at me, or considered that I might be a customer. AM #2 behind the register watched and said nothing, colluding with his co-worker's vile temperament and manner. I, who had yet to be addressed, politely said that I was actually looking to buy something. AM #1 said nothing, glowered at my friend, and turned away. There was silence. We walked out and vowed to leave a Yelp review.",1,,
23,C.A. C.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,16,0,1.0,6/24/2012,"Horrid, abolsutely horrid. Like most, I work in the area most of my co-workers usually frequent this place for random things to eat to keep us from killing the guests over the phone or each other. Now, I ordered for pick up via SeamlessWeb and I don't know if I unchecked the option where it said ""add onions"" with my cream cheese bagel (but let's assume I did.)  And I open my bagel to find. ONIONS. *shudders*Speaking of which people who eat cream cheese bagels WITH Onions are stank breath having bastards. Period. And I hated the way my quesadilla was made. Maybe it's me, but when you make a quesadilla it's made with guacamole, the cook decided to make it slices of advocado like ""Meh, they'll know the difference) well...I did. And I'm pleased.",1,2,
24,Emma Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,5.0,5/6/2015,"I needed a new caterer that was inexpensive yet good. I researched here and there and stumbled onto Le Basket by chance. There weren't any bad reviews so I called and asked for an estimate. The estimate they gave me was a much better price than the caterer I used to order from and since I was on a tight budget, I decided to take the risk and order lunch from them. It happened that I was in the neighborhood the day before the shoot so I stopped by to check the deli out. The deli was clean and tidy and the food in the salad bar thankfully didn't look like it had been sitting out for days. It looked delicious and fresh, which was relieving. The owner was there and he was friendly and nice even before I introduced myself. And Min was also there and she was very sweet and accommodating in person as she was over the phone. So far so good. And then shoot day came and the food arrived at noon. The food was simply fantastic for the price. The chicken was really delish. My crew kept on coming back for extra helpings of all that they brought over, which is great since you want them well-fed and happy during a long shoot. If you need an inexpensive caterer for a casual work-event, this is a great place to order from. They give generous portions, are proud of the quality of their food and it's excellent for the price. I'm going to talk about their chicken again as I end this review because it was seriously so good. Everyone kept coming back for another piece. So good. So so good. If you order catering from them, ask them to include their chicken.",,,

They also have a nice selection of buffet food, one of my favorites though is their tuna salad or egg salad sandwiches. Their breakfast menu is great too. Pancakes, french toast, susage, egg and cheese on a bagel, ect. I believe in this area we have 3 delis to choose from and out of the three I like Le Basket.  I personally know the owner because he was one of my clients at my job and his whole staff is great.

I'd recommend the Cuban or the Le Basket special (turkey, bacon, avocado). The chicken parm is also good (and huge) but the rueben, in my experience, tends to be rather small (but still tasty).

Great, cheap way to get my ramen munchies taken care of on the way home. Feel like I might be doing that more often... don't judge!2- I always see people just chillin' and sippin' beers outside where all the chairs and tables are.

Pronouncing fif-teen versus fif-ty seems like a pretty essential part of the job, especially when you are overcharging ridiculously. But maybe that's part of their strategy. The cashier's English was so useless that there was little point in talking to him. Eventually I got him to give me the $50, but he gave it to me in cash and refused to refund me for the tax they had charged, because he said (I think, based on his incoherent babbling) that they would be charged for it too.

51,Regina W.,"Oakland, CA",316,229,52,4.0,7/1/2009,"I'm digging this place.  I went there for the first time yesterday for breakfast.  I was hungry and hadn't bought any food.  Boo...!!!  I'd seen Le Basket the night before, but walked past it to another place where I had one of the worst salmon entrees ever.  I needed something good.I ordered their breakfast special, which is just two eggs, home fries and toast for $3.00.  I asked for a side of bacon too and got an iced coffee.  It cost me $6.50 total.  It was good.  It's not haute cuisine. It's a corner deli merged with a greasy spoon. My breakfast tasted like a quick but traditional American breakfast.  I didn't have anywhere to go, so I sat outdoors, fired up my laptop and enjoyed breakfast while watching the people and the traffic go by.  For what I paid, what I got really hit the spot and helped me start off my day right.It also helped that the folks behind the counter were really nice.  I heard someone speak Korean and, since I do too, I got to practice.  God knows it's not like I get many chances most of the time.Anyway, I'll go back, for sure.  It's inexpensive and the folks are nice.",1,2,1
52,Lauren F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,10/14/2011,"THE WORST. HUGE OBJECT in sandwich not to mention incorrect order. Could have cracked a tooth. Talk about a health code violation. On top of that, the manager wanted to SEE the sandwich prior to crediting $6.00 back. What if I would have bitten down normally and sued the restaurant for a cracked tooth. Would have been much more than $6.00. Such a waste of time. BEWARE",1,,1
53,Michelle M.,"San Mateo, CA",3,46,2,4.0,3/31/2010,"Le Basket is a pretty standard deli with a food bar.  They have a pretty good selection, though they don't really have typical salad bar items, so it's not really a create-your-own salad place.  A lot of the food looked similar to nearby Space Market's, causing me to wonder if maybe there's some sort of third party providing the food for these types of places.  Either way, it's a good spot to grab a quick lunch.I do wonder though if the owners know that ""Le Basket"" means ""the sneaker"" in French...  hmmm.",,,
54,Tracy G.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,34,4,4.0,6/8/2012,"I work across the street and Le Basket is always a great place to pick up yummy lunch.  The salad and hot food bar are good--nothing too out of the ordinary for a NY deli, but always great choices.  And I've always found the staff very friendly.  I mostly do lunch there, but also have been pleased with the egg sandwiches in the morning.  A great neighborhood mainstay!",,,

Some time's I'll even make it there for lunch when I'm in the mood, because who can pass up a huge cheeseburger and a plethora of fries for only $5.50?Le Basket will always have a little place in my heart.

And it's quick and inexpensive, for me. I've also ordered deliver a few times when I was not able to leave the office for lunch. They've saved me many times by accepting credit cards and delivering for only $6 bucks worth of food and they are quick and the food is hot when I get it. Keep in mind I work about 2 minutes away, but still it's better than having to pay 8 bucks for a lousy sandwich then an additional $3 on a drink and tip just to get them to deliver like many other places.",,,

I just started working in the area recently and one of the first things on my to-do list was to find the best chicken parm within walking distance. After disasters with several other locales (from undercooked chicken to exorbitant prices for bad quality food) I found this place and it's definitely a keeper in my lunch menu! The deli sandwiches are also great for good quantity for your price. Just be aware of the crowds around lunch time as it can get really packed.,,,

Hot days are the best, just relax, sip the beer, watch the people. Good place for city sketches, if you like that kind of thing. To say it a third time, its the patio and the location and the relaxation (and the beer which is cheaper than sitting on a patio at a pub/cafe/blahbity blah).If you stay around too long and you get hungry they has food to.
