0,R L.,"Queens, NY",619,1034,3105,4.0,7/18/2018,"More of a diner type place than a restaurant but it's a cool spot. Its right on the corner and they have tall windows so you can people watch if you sit by the windows. There are booths as well and counter seating as well. Pretty typical diner menu which means just about anything is available. Sandwiches, soups, burgers, entree type dinners, etc. It can be a tight squeeze inside if its busy. Just the aisles. The place itself is not that big so it's one way in the aisles. Great service though and the food is good. Great place to grab a bite to eat.",9,5,9

2,Adriane S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,2,1.0,5/28/2018,"Do NOT eat here, UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE A COCKROACH AS A TABLE GUEST!!!!!!!!Today I ate at Westside Restaurant for the first time. The restaurant was crowded, which I took as a good sign. The service was quick and the food was adequate. As I finished my meal, a baby cockroach crawled across the booth and joined me for my last few bites of egg and french fries. Upon discovering the repulsive creature, I jumped out of my seat, was asked what was wrong by the restaurant staff, and watched as they nonchalantly (almost too nonchalantly - as if this was a common occurrence) crushed the cockroach, killing it. Talk about customer service!",2,1,1
3,Mi Rae C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",58,425,1652,3.0,9/16/2018,"This is a review of Westside as compared to other diners.  Solid coffee, eggs and potatoes were good, toast was not toasted enough.  My challah french toast was pretty disappointing.  It was basically just challah bread with hardly any egg batter incorporated.  They didn't have pure maple syrup much to my dismay and I had to order a side of strawberries since the french toast was so basic.",1,,1

5,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",179,350,239,2.0,3/2/2018,"Came here early on a Saturday morning, at the suggestion of a friend, We were heading to see an early movie at the AMC theatre a few blocks away afterward, so she said this would be a convenient spot to meet up and have some breakfast and chat.I'm all for old school New York diners, but I just wasn't impressed by this place. The decor is super old, but not a nostalgic old, like an old that really needs to be renovated. When I first walked in, it was a few minutes before I was greeted, even though I stood right in front of the hostess stand. The woman behind it was in such a deep scroll on her iPhone that she didn't even realize a customer had walked in and was standing just a foot in front of her.A waitress who was pouring someone coffee at a nearby table saw me and came over and asked how many people it would be. I said two, and she grabbed some menus and took me to a table. It was pretty empty at that hour (around 9 a.m.), and I asked to sit at a window table, and she kindly accommodated the request.The menu is huge, as is expected in any diner. Eating out when you eat low-carb is usually a challenge, but even moreso at diners, and this place is no exception. Most of the breakfast items are heavy on the carbs/sugar, so egg dishes is where I concentrated my eyes. Unfortunately, they all come with home fries and toast, but you cannot substitute for a small green salad or fruit salad. You have to get those and pay full price for them -- even when you decline the potatoes/toast.I got the Mexican omelette (it had tomatoes, guac, jalapenos) and substituted cheddar cheese for the pepper jack. The omelette itself was a good size, but had wayyyyy too much congealed, greasy cheese in it. If you're watching your food intake, maybe request some cheese on the side or don't get it at all.The coffee was abysmal. Didn't taste good at all. Watery and flavor was just off. My friend's water glass had a full lip lipstick mark on it. Ugh.Service was quick and the waitress was nice enough. The location is good but it's the Upper West Side, people. I paid $23 for an omelette, two pieces of whole wheat toast, and gross coffee. Paying for eggs, bread and coffee at a restaurant is annoying in and of itself, when I can make the same thing at home for just about $4. But there are many, many other places in the area for a quick breakfast with better quality and better tasting food. Sadly, the other reviews here about mediocrity aren't wrong.",,,
6,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,3.0,4/13/2018,"Okay the food isn't fantastic, but it doesn't deserve all these low ratings! Keep in mind it's a diner, Yelp people, so you can't compare it with classy restaurants. For a diner, the food is a three. Absolutely nothing outstanding, but nothing bad, either. I got the matza ball soup. It came out lukewarm, but I liked the balls. Friends got the sweet kale salad, which looked like a great healthy choice, the burger, which looked below average, and the scrambled eggs, which looked solid, but you have to really try to mess that up. So some misses and some mehs, but our waiter was hilarious and fast, and we were seated immediately late on a Friday night, and I'm a sucker for the old-school NYC diner look, so Westside Diner, I dub thee three stars!",7,7,7

9,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,356,4.0,1/6/2018,"I've been here many times over maybe 15 years, and the low reviews are baffling.  It's a diner.  It's not fancy.  It's not even the best diner around.  But it's solid and it's been around a while, and it's pricey because it's in New York on Broadway on the Upper West Side, and it's got rent to pay.  You want a turkey club, they make you a turkey club.  It's good and the fries it comes with are usually excellent.  The matzah ball soup is... fine.  The pancakes are better than fine.  The service is quick and always pleasant, and the place is often full of repeat customers--I often see them, neighbors I recognize, when I walk by.  And it's open on New Year's Day in the morning, to boot.",3,,
10,David F.,"Manhattan, NY",29,83,600,3.0,6/26/2017,"A solid diner on the UWS. I don't understand the prevalence of 1 and 2 star reviews here. This place consistently delivers traditional diner food, with friendly and fast service and prices that are reasonable given the neighborhood. I can't say that it's anything extraordinarily special, but for a tasty omelet or burger, it does the trick. The food invariably is served quickly and the waitstaff is attentive. On my most recent trip, I had a spinach, tomato and feta cheese omelet, with tomato and lettuce substituted for potatoes. (The waiter patiently and promptly checked to see if fruit salad could be substituted; alas, it could not.) My daughter went with the chicken fingers and fries. The food was very good all around. Westside is not a place that I seek out, but when you need a quick meal in that part of town, it certainly does the trick.",3,2,1

We came here for breakfast on a weekend. It was relatively early (around 9am) so no wait at all. I got the lumberjack combo and husband got the two eggs with potatoes and ham. Both were very solid, and pancakes in mine were surprisingly fluffy and delicious. One common complaint we both had was the ham. It tasted very artificial and you could tell the quality was bad, but once again, I'm not really expecting a thick slab of gourmet ham...

Even though the food is a bit blue collar for the area it still tastes fresh and it came out hot.  I have only ordered the gyro which is a bit average because it is a diner and that's not what they specialize in, but it's tasty and the portions are more than enough to fill me up. More importantly they have a full bar! Again, the servers (when I've gone) have been more than accommodating and nice. NYC needs to keep more diners like this alive and running.

I have dined at The Smith months ago and loved it; but that place gets crowded. Being that lunch rush was approaching, I decided to choose the slightly less busier, and less fancier Westside Restaurant. I didn't expect anything extraordinary. I just wanted a simple breakfast; something simple as pancakes and coffee. The food was decent, my pancakes, the corned-beef hash, and the Belgian waffle my Mom ordered were good. The coffee, tasted as if it was sitting in that pot for the entire morning. I guess that is why they kept asking if I wanted the rest of it, I mean a refill. I like the coffee shop establishments in NYC but I don't think this place is going to be on my list of establishments to frequent.",3,2,3

They just don't get the fact the customer is always right.They don't make a grilled chicken deluxe sandwich, fine I get that. OK then, french fries on the side. Can I get that with bacon? no? Oh, I can get it on the side fine. just so you know they won't be on the side for long because your making me put it on the chicken. I'll need Mayo and some hot sauce. (they don't have chipotle mayo, so I'll make a hot sauce mayo at the table)The order comes to the table, there's lettuce but no tomato. I said where's the tomato. answer: It doesn't come with tomato, it's extra. I hand him the plate and ask him to have them put tomato on it, or does that have to have it's own plate as well. Answer: no, I can have them put tomato on it. Great. The order comes back with four small thick slice rings of roma tomatos. I shack my head and roll my eyes. unbelivable I got a tomato you put in a salad. He goes to walk away and I ask where's the mayo and hot sauce. He says he'll be right back. The grilled chicken is not grilled but infact seasoned with god only knows what and it was cooked on the flat top that is used to cook hambergers, and eggs in the morning. The french fries are awful, There is this pre-packaged flour garbage they put on french fries for years to keep them crispy. After eating a few, my mouth feels like i've been eating crakers. There is this pasty feeling in my mouth thats feels like if I took a sip of water I could spit out biskets. This place is a train wreck. I guess the customers who do go to this dinner have given up on the service and menu offerings and are glad that the food stays down and they don't get sick.

The cheese tasted rubbery, as if it had been left out for too long, which it probably was. The chicken was dry and flavorless. I opened up my wrap (didn't feel like eating the whole wheat tortilla) only to find a piece of aluminum foil clinging to some lettuce.

Walking into this place, which shouldn't be called a restaurant, I felt kinda tight because the door was very narrow and kind of short and I'm a pretty tall fellow. It seems like a Long Island Greek diner family member just moved to the upper west side and decided to open this place. Don't they have tall Greek people??? We were allowed to sit any where we wanted to sit, we took a booth because it seemed to be the most comfortable, and it kind of was. Well they gave us the menu and a glass of water, mind you that was the only water we were given while there, so if you want more water you better ask for it or else you will be very thirsty. My girlfriend order a simple wrap and I ordered a simple burger. Nothing to complicated and we thought we would be in and out in less than 45 minutes. But we were wrong, dead wrong. We waited over 25 minutes to get our order, and when it did come out my burger was already Iuke warm, at best, and my fries were already getting cold. The burger is not the best I've ever had but what can you expect when you go to a diner. You have a menu with a thousand items on it and not one of them is made perfectly so you get what you can.

Bottom line is the place is just overpriced and inconsistent. Paying $18 for a grilled chicken wrap that comes out all lettuce is not what I call a good deal. At a diner you expect large portions for reasonable prices. If I wanted a small overpriced sand which, I would go to Pret. The staff is nice enough but gets flustered easily when it's crowded.

It USED to be an outstanding diner -- whatever you ordered was excellent, well made and delicious. Sometime in the past few years this place has gone steadily down hill...but I kept trying out of nostalgia, and the memory of all the great meals I once had here. Then my son got sick from a grilled cheese he had here. That was after extraordinarily CRAPPY SERVICE. As in, I had to stand up and ask when our order would be taken. It was taken and brought by a surly waiter who looked like he'd rather be doing anything else.

I told the waitress it was the wrong order and she debated me, telling me the yellow color was ""from the green in the spinach"".  Seriously.  I took a taste and told her ""No, this has yolk in it."" and she took it back and returned with the most BURNT egg white omelet I've ever had.  Worse?  It didn't even taste good.The diner tried to make it up to me by not charging me for the egg whites and soda I ordered, but frankly the damage was done.  Between the waitress' attitude, lack of attentiveness and a freaking BURNT omelet, this place gets the thumbs down from me.  Never again.",4,1,2

They have so many omelets to choose from so  I usually get an omelet to take out. I do not usually go to diners in the city at all usually only when I am in Jersey but their omelets are as good as any I have had in Jersey and are better then I have had in Brooklyn and Queens. They must have a seniors special because there are usually seniors dining in  when we get take out. When I eat at diners I usually only order breakfast food as diners are not really known for much else except sometimes their burgers. I have not had a burger here. I got into omelets when I worked at the old chain Brew N Burgers which used to be all over the city (when I was a  teenager.)

The omelette was moist and the potatoes were fresh which beats most diners right there. The sausage was just okay. I prefer thin well done ones and these were plump and had a soft texture. Service was fine not great. Total tab $15.84 after tax/before tip",,,
149,Mark T.,Australia,0,52,0,3.0,5/15/2014,We pulled in here after an afternoon movie. I had a panini and my partner a guacamole burger. We also had a glass of white wine. Wine was not as cold as it could have been. Food was good. Service was good. We had a nice seat beside the window but they put a big guy next to us for no real reason since there were other seats...,,,
150,Adam L.,"Flushing, NY",2,29,2,2.0,6/18/2008,"$10 for a hamburger and fries?! ($9.03 w/ tax + $1 tip)I was in the mood for a plate of crispy diner style fries today.  I decided to go in here today instead of my usual halal stop.  My 2 complaints: 1, the price obviously, and 2 the crumbling hamburger.  Not so much the burger itself but the bread that couldn't hold the toppings, I'll just say it got a little messy and was slowly not looking like a hamburger anymore but instead a patty with crumbled bread and runny ketchup.Oh and the fries weren't as crispy as I thought they would be, they were crispy, but I've had better. (And maybe a 3rd complaint, the table set up, it's like a maze, but that didn't bother me so much.)",1,1,1

When I went back again the next weekend - I went for the pancakes and did not regret it.Tiny tables. Super affordable.",,,

160,Jessica S.,"Mebane, NC",2,75,3,3.0,5/3/2012,"We came here for breakfast after seeing a taping of a talk show a block or so away.  There was no wait at about 11am, but yet, there was a steady crowd of people  coming and going while we ate, most of whom appeared to be locals, which I take to be a good sign.  The food was good, (my grandma really liked the buckwheat pancakes), the portions were more than adequate, our coffees and waters were kept full, and the service was prompt and polite.  The restrooms were very clean, although small.  We didn't feel rushed, but we didn't linger for very long either.   We ate, we got full on a decent meal, and we were on our way in under an hour.  Success.  I'd come back if I was uptown and hungry.",,,

162,Theodore S.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,5,0,4.0,7/13/2009,"If you like diner food, it is great. Really friendly staff, and great service. I am not sure the people giving it such bad reviews went to the same place. It is not fancy, I do suggest the Romanian steak. Hearing people complain about how the ""fancier"" items on the menu weren't up to their standards is sort of funny, it is a diner, you order diner food, it is like going to a Japanese restaurant and asking for a hamburger. The fancy items aren't bad, they are good, not great but good.  Go there, get a burger, a breakfast, maybe some meatloaf, do this and it will not disappoint. As for the complaints about the staff, I got the opposite, they seemed very friendly, maybe the people were rude to them, or maybe I just got lucky.",,,1
163,Jay B.,"South Salem, NY",5,44,2,4.0,1/16/2007,"I've decided that this place is my new ""local."" The breakfast is a good value, although the service can sometimes be spotty. It's a nice mix of families, college kids and young locals. Plus, they make their own muffins on-site! The oat bran comes to your table warm and soft.. amazing. Good pancakes and corned beef hash for those looking for heartier fare. Coffee is whatever, but who cares when you have such disarmingly good cheap eats?",1,3,1

I thought the place was great. C. had an eggplant panini that she says was ""fine."" My meal was awesome. I had a cup of cream of celery soup, a fried egg sandwich on white toast with lettuce, tomato, and mustard. And for dessert, a piece of hot apple pie with vanilla ice cream. C.'s meal wasn't that great, but I ordered cheap to avoid the relatively high prices -- you are on the upper west side by Lincoln Center -- and came out aces. The wait staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. That said, it did take some time to get their attention when it was time to pay and go, but otherwise: Get the egg sandwich.",1,,
168,Ali K.,"New York, NY",856,570,728,4.0,1/11/2011,"24/7 diners are def where it's at, obviously. But i went here during the day with my girlfriend we were looking for a place to grab a quick bite before heading back into midtown to a museum for the day, it was suggested by the concierge at our friends building so we decided to go ahead and try it. Immediately upon walking in we were seated, it was a nice, cozy, small space and i was actually pretty happy we were seated near the window. Nothing to amazing about the window seating except the people watching, immediately i was brought out my onion soup which was extremely tasty with saltine crackers. Our meal's actually came pretty promptly now that i think about it. My girlfriend bought a french toast breakfast platter and it seemed to thoroughly enjoy it with a smile on her face. The name of my dish escapes me but it was linguine with a garlic sauce glazed over it and chicken strips. I don't want to bash on the meal but it was def. a little to rich in flavor for me, very good and very filling but just a little to rich for my liking. But i'm going to say the chef did not ""scrimp"" me on the portion, i kept looking down saying, ""really i'm not done? Like wtf!! So that was def a plus.",,,
