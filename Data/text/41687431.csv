It's an easy stop to make of you are trying to looking for an alternative to fast food. It is a little pricey, considering the amount of food you get. I had ordered the pure power plate which included chicken, tomatoes . It takes about 7-10 minutes for them to make your order, however the food is worth the wait. The staff is friendly and the art in the store is eye catching. If you are near the World trade center and looking for a hearty bite to eat; I would definitely stop by this healthy hole in the wall.",,,
1,Sean R.,"Ann Arbor, MI",11,35,3,2.0,7/31/2018,"The food can be edible or it can be bland and flavorless.  Just depends on what you get.  Avoid the Tone Thai, it is a dry and tasteless mess.  The Bicep Burrito is very good and worth getting since it actually taste like food and they do make good guacamole.  A major issue with this place is that they are very slow.  Don't expect your food to be ready in a timely fashion.  If you want healthy meal options, this is not a bad place if you accept their shortcomings in making flavorful dishes.",1,,
2,Jelani R.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,2,0,1.0,6/25/2018,"Trash Period. It's no way they taste there food before giving it. And they don't stand by their product which means if you don't like it and tell them why then you just keep it. Tried it twice, first it was the sandwich (super dry). Second time it was the shake, taste like nothing but powder. I only complained the second time. Never again!!!!""EAT RIGHT. GO THE DISTANCE!!!"" Away from this store",1,1,
3,Roxana F.,"New York, NY",70,202,21,3.0,8/9/2018,"I really loved my wrap from Stamina (spicy chipotle chicken) but was pretty annoyed that there were not one but two chicken bones in here. One I was noticed as soon as I bit into the wrap but the other I didn't notice until it was on its way to my stomach haha. Partly my fault as I was ravenous and definitely not chewing as much as I should have. Bonus points for having gluten free wraps and speedy delivery. Will order again, will just be more careful!",2,1,1
4,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,170,469,5.0,11/13/2017,"My friend told me to try this place, it's not too far from where I live and there's plenty of healthy options. I thought it was expensive but turns out you get a good amount of food to make it worth it. I heard this place is amazing for smoothies and juices, but I will have to try that next time. First was the BBQ plate which was chicken in a sweet BBQ sauce over brown rice with half an avocado for about $12. I thought it was kind of pricey but it was definitely enough for 2 meals, so worth it. The chicken was fine, a little dry but the avocado was fresh. As I was ordering I saw a sign for açaí bowls (which was not on the menu) which the cashier said was açaí and banana blended together with banana and granola on top. It was $8.50 and also turned out to be a massive bowl. Pretty tasty too. The menu has so many other healthy options that I want to try, including healthy sandwiches, pizza, quesadillas, all of which I want to try. I will definitely come back to try more and get my healthy food fix!",1,,1

In addition to being a decent size, the chicken was cooked well and the added guacamole and salsa really provided for a nice bite.Overall, this is a decent spot to grab a quick, healthy bite in FiDi.",3,,

It came in a pita which was not torn, means I couldn't hold the ""sandwich"" together and had to use a fork. The chicken was dry, pita drier and absolutely no sauce. I couldn't eat it, and it came with a giant piece of onion, tomato. Absolutely no effort taken to make this edible. Had to dump the whole thing and go elsewhere for food",,,

There were no other customers in there when I ordered.Instead of offering a solution or telling me how long it would be the woman tells me ""you barely just got here"". I told you it's already been 15 minutes. The receipt said 11:18 am and it was 11:33 when I asked you where my food was.

It can get pricey if you order food plus a shake/juice but it's worth it because it's healthy. I usually get the guilt free pizza because I love pizza and could probably eat it everyday. The guilt free pizza comes with extremely thin crust, low fat tomato sauce and cheese and you choose your toppings. I usually spend about $12 on the pizza because I add chicken, spinach and pineapples. Although it could use some more flavor, it's healthy so it makes me feel good about myself. I also had the quesadilla which was huge and looked more like a Calzone. I definitely couldn't finish everything because of the big portions.The juices are great! I have only tried the Hypertension and the pineapple really helps mask the taste of the vegetables.

The food proportion (at least what I ordered) was actually pretty big for the price. I got the stamina bbq plate and it came stuffed with bbq chicken, a lot of brown rice and an avocado for just $11!

Updated review","I tried their Bicep Burrito Wrap today from MealPal and it was another filling and satisfying meal.  The burrito was made with a whole wheat shell and came with a little bit of brown rice, guacamole, generous helping of grilled chicken breast, beans, salsa. I am not sure if there was cheese in it. The burrito itself was slightly spicy which I like. It was nicely seasoned and not overly salty. I am sensitive to salt. It also wasn't greasy. All I know is that I am stuffed and satisfied. So far, I've only tried two items on their menu and have been very happy with both. I look forward to making this place my go-to for a healthy, satisfying lunch alternative.",1,1,1
25,Jasmine O.,"San Jose, CA",3,61,18,5.0,10/16/2017,Yooo!!! I had a Nutty banana smoothie and wow! It was so yummy. In Hawaii there's a place called Lanikai Juice that has a very similar drink and since I've tried it over there I haven't been able to find something quiet as good until now! Thank you Stamina!,,,
26,Shelbee C.,"Roseville, CA",0,11,2,5.0,4/28/2018,high key my favorite place for feel good fuel.  I've been living in a hotel so I just go here or postmates food for the day from here when I feel like I've been binging on too much junk food and I need more balanced meals.  Amazing vegetarian options.  Also today I woke up feeling like shit but after the vitamin c smoothie and an egg white pita I'm so ready for today! Also for people who postmates or get food delivered they are amazing! Somehow my pita was still hot and my smoothie was still cold everything was beautifully packaged.,,,
27,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,3.0,12/1/2015,"Ironically, this place serves food that's exactly identical to what I usually make at home - I stir fry some protein with a bunch of veggies, add no salt, and instead season the dish with an overdose of hot peppers. And then I eat the food I cook which makes me sniffle quite a bit and think ""wow I'm pretty good."" But when a restaurant serves the same type of dish, I suddenly become demanding and think this place sucks. I guess that's just how I am, 100% rational.I got the powerhouse plate which has onions, peppers, bison and chicken. The meats are a bit dry but hey it's better (and safer) than meat that's underdone. The restaurant seems to pride itself in using practically no salt, and I find it kind of amazing that this dish can be both tasteless and overwhelmingly spicy at the same time. I also got the vegetable lentil soup which was cooked well despite the lack of salt.At the end of the day I liked my lunch because it was hearty and nutritious. However, it reminded me that the food I cook actually sucks and that I don't want to pay anyone else $15 to cook like this.",8,10,2
28,David S.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,8,0,1.0,2/26/2018,It's a great name because in order to get your food or speak to someone in the shop you're going to need a lot of damn Stamina. This seems like a place that only takes orders thru apps. I've ordered food. Never showed. Called to followup. Then called to cancel. Nobody answers. You get a voicemail of a corporate name. The time I didn't receive the order (previous week) the wrap wasn't made well. And not surely not as perceived. It'll give you the stamina you lost bc the wrap was loaded w calories. The whole experience was shady. It's a restaurant! Why shady?!,,,

For breakfast I ordered oatmeal and a juice drink. All delicious, handed to me by friendly staff behind the counter.Also Allset allows lower tip on this restaurant, since it is not a full-service restaurant so it makes it much more attractive to order from Stamina.",,,
31,Gileana C.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,0,4.0,6/21/2018,Love the food from here. The wraps are a good size especially if you split your meals during the day. My favorite is the holy guacamole.,,,
32,Meaghan P.,"New York, NY",1,32,16,1.0,5/25/2017,"Not a big fan of this place. I've ordered three different items on three different visits, and figured I've seen enough to write a review. My first complaint is Stamina claims to be a health food restaurant while providing no nutritional information for any menu items and a few vegetarian (replacing meat in an item for tofu or a veggie patty for nearly an extra $2 doesn't count) and zero vegan options. The only thing that's great about this place is that the food has more nutrients, less grease/fat, and more added protein than the local competition - yes, it's healthier, but if you order a basic menu item (i.e. a wrap/sandwich) AND a shake/juice... you've easily consumed more food than you probably should for an entire day... at least it's a more nutritious 1600 calories though!What I've ordered:1.  Pure Power Shake - this shake tastes great, but it's so dense and rich it easily has 700-800 calories and 70+ carbs for a medium size. Can't imagine all the sugar in it, I am diabetic and it shot my blood sugar through the roof. I  couldn't drink the whole thing.2. Protein Pancakes - these are very dry and taste like eating a dense stack of protein powder flavored wheat bread (if this were a thing). They're topped with maybe four pieces of fresh strawberries and bananas. They don't tell you they provide no butter or syrup (which I understand as it's a health food restaurant) and I was disappointed to find this out after getting back to my office. The massive size and nothing to help with the fact that they're so dry = I couldn't eat more than half of one. 3. Baked Falafel Sandwich - again, couldn't finish this item and not because I wasn't hungry. The falafel had a dry and stale texture, and was flavorless. It was cold, not my idea of ""baked"". The hummus soaked through the pita before I walked back to work (2.5 blocks) and I didn't taste any tahini, if there was any. It also took 13 minutes to prepare meanwhile no other customers were in the restaurant the entire time.",,,
33,Ginger B.,"New York, NY",159,238,627,3.0,6/13/2016,"The food is pretty good here, but I usually get takeout/delivery for lunch so unfortunately the baked fries aren't crispy when I eat them.I tried the grilled chicken Greek salad wrap - but there was no feta or olives, just lettuce, tomato, onion, so it was just grilled chicken and salad and a yogurt sauce.  If I am able to come here to eat in person I'll update my review accordingly.",1,,
34,3men2 M.,"Bronx, NY",0,40,3,3.0,11/3/2017,The portuons are large and the food is good but not tastey out of this world. A good location for healthy food and good choices. A bit pricey but thats what you get in downtown,,,
35,Tiana B.,"Staten Island, NY",5,49,21,4.0,2/28/2017,I typically order a Sweet potato and a mango Smoothie from here and love it! Sweet potato always comes to me warm and the smoothies here are great. Ive had the grilled chicken here before and probably wont eat it without adobo or A LOT of salt. Agree with others when they say food is pretty bland. Its healthy though so it makes sense to not add a lot of added salt and other things. Stamina is great for someone who is looking for a healthy breakfast. I reccommend the 6 egg white breakfast with sweet potato,1,,

And the food too, plus you can get dressing that's freshly made form the juiced (for example the carrot ginger dressing).The restaurant in itself is bare, even if the music selection is awesome, for the quality of food it does not attract many people to eat inside.If you do eat inside, you can see plenty of delivery guys carrying out orders, you can tell their neighbors love their food.

41,Nazia B.,"Bronxville, NY",4,67,18,1.0,12/8/2016,Ordered the Stamina BBQ Chicken meal. Boy was I disappointed. You can get wayyyy better tasting food in the halal carts on Broadway for only $6 compared to Stamina's price of $13. I would suggest avoiding this place. The rice was over boiled and mushy and the chicken breast tossed around in some BBQ sauce.,,,
42,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,2.0,7/2/2013,"This might mark my breakup with ""health food"" (except we were never really together in the first place). Only lard from now on! I decided I needed some quickie energy (STAMINA?) one afternoon for a long trek up to the Bronx. Walked in, decided on a bison burger. Surely The Sake of Healthiness could not ruin the indulgence of a burger, right? Well, the burger was terrible. The chopped lettuce was crisp and bouncy, but that was it. The whole thing was rubbery and tasteless and came alone in a pita pocket. I ended up taking the meat patty out, drowning it in hot sauce, and eating that. (Still wasn't good.)They also have a menu of juices and protein shakes. On another day I wanted a green juice (which is apparently a ""thing."" I have a secret, shameful love of green juice). Theirs was a little watery but otherwise comparable to Health King nearby (yelp.com/biz/health-king…), in goodness and in price ($6 for what equates to a small, ugh). As I walked out straw-in-mouth, I was hit with a craving for a big, fat, real burger. Thanks, Zaitzeff's grease fumes.All this is a good example of selection bias. Only a specific segment of the population will happily grab lunch somewhere that overtly positions itself as a ""healthy"" eatery. And they are going to enjoy it, almost regardless of a more general measure of deliciousness. I have my own consumer biases, but mediocre health food where the healthiness has to be so explicitly marketed apparently doesn't do it for me.",11,13,8

44,Katie A.,"New York, NY",5,52,2,2.0,8/25/2016,"Quick delivery, but the breakfast burrito was painfully tasteless. Not sure how a burrito packed with guac, bacon and chipotle sauce could be as flavorful as a fresh piece of cardboard, but somehow it is. Also- distribution of contents was DEPLORABLE.

First this location as limited seated. Second it's overpriced.  I orders a garden salad and it was tiny ! Smaller than a bodega small and cost $7.50 for spinach red onion shaved carrot and a few tomatoes. Most of the items they offer here are one step up from a McDonald's wrap. Not healthy at all. Smh!

This ended up being a little more than $19... which I don't normally spend on breakfast but I was treating myself and expecting this to be super delicious. It was incredibly bland. Every bite was a chore. I took a salt packet and sprinkled a little salt, but the crunchy salt on top just made it an even more miserable experience.I also got a smoothie. It was supposed to be $5.95, but I substituted the apple juice for soy milk... ended up being close to $8. It tasted mainly bland and slightly bitter. The crunchy ice in it gave off a rather unappetizing freezer smell (you know... when other freezer food odors get absorbed).I gave 2 stars because I guess I'm not that mad and at least I feel physically ok.

Got a large stress reliever shake with a scoop of soy protein powder for $8 and a chicken wrap deluxe. The wrap was huge and couldn't be finished but I wish there was an option of a side besides a large helping of fries (maybe like a baked potato or mashed taters) since it kind of defeats the purpose of getting a healthy chicken wrap. And I was disappointed with my shake because whoever made it didn't even stir the soy powder in the drink so I had to keep spending times stirring and breaking up big globs of powder balls in my drink.,,,

I had the pure protein, chunks of chicken and bison  smothered in a spicy, 7/10 spicy for someone who eats spicy daily, sauce mixed with tomatoes and onions.It was good not great.

55,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",412,1514,173,3.0,3/6/2015,"**review based on delivery**I'm one of those ""weird"" people who enjoy a good salad. 9 times out of 10, I prefer a hearty salad over a burger. So when Seamless suggested Stamina Grill, I was sold. I browsed the (large) menu and decided on the grilled chicken salad. I paired it with spinach and decided to top the whole thing off with tzatziki because I'm all about that opa.  The food came relatively quick and when I opened the bag I was a bit disappointed by the size of the salad. I don't have a HUGE appetite but I do like a filling salad so I don't snack the rest of the workday. I popped it open, mixed in the tzatziki and prepared to be left wanting more. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the ingredients were and how tasty their chicken was. Overall, it was a delicious lunch but still a bit on the small side. I'm knocking off 2 stars because of the size and the cost. With tip, lunch came out to $14 and the salad was the size of one that should come to a total of maybe $10 (including beverage). I'll definitely try something else out next time as long as it includes the perfectly seasoned chicken and the garlic-filled tzatziki.",,,

57,Ali C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,7,0,2.0,10/26/2015,"This is probably my second or third review on Yelp as too often I'm lazy to write one, but the quality (blandness?) of the food definitely prompted it. Completely flavorless, cold wrap. I did order a cold wrap, but this was unlike other cold wraps I've had. This was...COLD. Bland chicken and bland vegetables added to a bland tortilla gave me a VERY bland wrap. I can't stress enough how bland this was!Anyway, it 'felt' healthy, but the downside is that it I ended up eating something else right after, something that was more filling. Net caloric intake ended up being much higher than if I'd just eaten the unhealthy stuff to start with. To be fair, my girlfriend liked the salmon in her wrap, but the wrap as a whole was still pretty bland for her too. Maybe I'll add a star for the appreciated salmon.",2,1,

Whatever you get, you'll get a good sized portion and it will be prepared in the most healthy way possible. The flip side is that it isn't the most delicious tasting food in the world.I've come here on a few occasions when I was starving but didn't want to go for an unhealthy option. I got the chicken sandwich with a side of baked sweet potato fries. The sandwich tasted like a plain baked chicken breast with with minimum seasoning. The sweet potato fries are also baked but are much better tasting. It's pretty hard for sweet potato fries to not be delicious unless you completely burn them. They were baked very nicely with a little crisp to them, but it still isn't the same as having them fried. An important side note, the fries take a VERY long time to make since they're baked. They definitely need to find a way around this as it took over 20 minutes to prepare.I'll continue to come here on the days I want a healthy but filling meal.

Updated review","My boss recently had Stamina cater one of our lunches! Aweeeesome.I tried their yummy steak and cheese wrap, it was spicy but very good.My colleagues also raved about the tofu and chicken wraps.The salads were huge and plentiful! They were also able to prepare the order in a very short period of time, yay!",2,,2
69,Randy H.,"Albertson, NY",724,220,878,4.0,12/6/2012,"A healthy quesadilla in Manhattan? Shut the front door.No really. Stamina Grill & Juice Bar has an amazing selection of healthy food choices. Let's just say every item on the menu is numbered and it goes from 1 to a 100 and throw in a few alphabet letters for the juice menu.I loved the variety at this place. They had everything from Grilled Chicken Sandwiches ($6.50) to Bison Burgers ($7.00). They even had guilt-free pizza on the menu (is there such a thing as guilt-free?) ($5/$8).Today I tried one of their low-fat quesadillas, the Stamina Quesadilla ($9.00). This thing was huge, I'm talking a meal here. It comes out in a small pizza box and it's heavy. The Stamina Quesadilla comes with grilled chicken, low-fat cheese, tomato, mushrooms, and onions. The mushrooms are big and meaty and there's plenty of onion for flavor. The crust is a very thin tortilla and very crispy. It can be tricky trying to lift this up to eat (it's served sliced in quarters). Very good and highly recommended.I need to come back again to continue to explore the menu here. The store is bright and clean and the counter staff was very helpful.Two thumbs up from me. This place is a great lunch (or dinner) stop if you're in the area.",9,7,7

I ordered a 12"" pizza, hummus and pita, and an iced coffee. The food was still hot and the Iced coffee still had ice when delivered! They even went so far as to provide me with a small cup of skim milk to add to my iced coffee which was very thoughtful. The hummus came in a large 12 oz container. I was expecting maybe 4 oz or so, but they really delivered! And the pizza was so good. The quality of the pizza was phenomenal, you would never have known it was guilt free. I got chicken, onions, peppers, and mushrooms on mine and it easily is enough for two people to share. I will be ordering from them again. The best part about this nutritional restaurant is that it is affordable. These gems are few in far between in Manhattan. Can't wait to try more of their menu!",,,

The ingredients taste natural and fresh. There is not very much seasoning but this is a health food place so I didn't expect that! Also got a small lentil soup, which comes with little slices of pita. It's a basic lentil soup packed with nutrients, but not as tasty as the burrito for sure!",2,,

Granted, it's not really freshly grilled, and was most likely microwaved like so many other places, but I was pleasantly sated.There were some training issues due to their first day, but that is to be expected.

84,Robert G.,"Baldwin, NY",0,17,1,4.0,1/6/2015,"I'm starting my second stint doing Paleo/Atkins/Low carb and it's very difficult finding takeout options. I found Stamina online and their menu had four, promising ""Low-Carb Power"" entrees that were hot meals, in addition to a number of salads.I went with the ""Super Salmon"" which is grilled salmon w/ mango salsa, sautéed spinach, and avocado. There was more on the plate than I expected, which is a good thing as I expected very small portions. Instead, I got a good chunk of boneless salmon, a filling amount of spinach, half an avocado, and probably a quarter-cup of salsa.The salmon was pretty bland and cooked more than I would choose - however, they probably cook the salmon to be safe and it was not overcooked. The salsa was not placed on top of the fish which is a good thing as it was very cold. It had a little kick to it. The spinach was nicely cooked. Getting a half an avocado was nice and it was perfectly ripe. Next time I get the salmon I'll ask for a side of BBQ sauce or salad dressing.The interior is pretty spartan and not great for enjoying a meal with friends, but works well if you just want to sit and eat your meal before you're off again. The menu was split up all over the walls, so if you wanted to browse the salads it was on this wall, and if you wanted to review wraps it was over there on that other wall. Weird. I grabbed a paper menu at the register and it made everything easier.I was pretty pleased with my visit and will be back again soon, probably trying the bison. A $14 lunch is a little more than I care to spend, but that's what it takes to find a healthy, cooked, low-carb entree.",,,

I get the Pure Power religiously (minus the coconut, not a big fan) and it fills me up during my hot yoga/gym sessions. I actually feel almost too full when I drink it. Their other smoothies are good too, and they will alter/adjust if you ask them. I've had the Bison burger sandwich, which I wasn't too impressed with. It was a burger slapped on a whole wheat pita with lettuce, tomato and onion. No sauce. The burger was dry and I suspect pre-made because I ordered and 3 mins later it was ready. They take longer for my shakes! I tried them again for the Popeye Quesadilla and that was more my speed. It was huge, so I only ate half in one sitting. I was pleasantly surprised that they loaded it up with chicken and spinach, no skimping. I just wish the chicken was a little more flavorful. But the pico de gallo/salasa thing they gave me with it was delish and made up for it. Oh and the chocolate chip muffins are amazing! I prob eat one like every other day. :XService is good. They do take a little time because it's made to order, but it's worth it. Everyone has been really friendly every time I've been there. The guys that hand out flyers outside can be a little off putting, but whatevs. Nothing is perfect. Can be a little pricey for certain items, but it's FiDi. I'll be a regular here.",2,,2

However, the service/management is just terrible and there is a complete lack of consistency with how the dishes are prepared. Oh and if you want to make any adjustments to your order? Ha! Good luck with that. Ask for no onions, best believe there will be onions!Don't get me wrong, the people who work here are very nice. But the kitchen staff is sooooo slow and doesn't pay attention to how the food should be prepared. Also, it would be really nice if they listed nutrition facts. Obviously this place is geared towards health conscious people who want to know about calories/fat/carbs etc. Like I said before, food is good, but aside from that this place needs help.",,1,

Anyway, moving on...STAMINA GRILL - Excited to find this healthy jewel in the Financial District. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan Wrap with a Stress Reliever Juice and the food totally delivered. I absolutely love my Chicken Parm ANYTHING, so when I found out there was a healthier version I had to try it and it exceeded my expectations. The chicken was juicy and the mozzarella deliciously melted, you can't go wrong. They have a large variety of healthy meals, juices, and smoothies that I am anticipating to try now.

It took a few minutes for the staff to confirm it was a legit coupon, but they were very friendly about it and apologetic of the extra time it took.  I love the simplicity and organization of the menu.  Each type of item (and they have Salads, Wraps, Juices, Smoothies and I believe one other thing) has its own board and each has around 5 different choices.  The healthy breakfast burrito I got was fantastic.  Eggwhites, turkey bacon, lowfat cheese, guacamole and brown rice.  I was underwhelmed by their hot sauce, but luckily I always have my own at the office.  It's hard to create a healthy (or at least not too unhealthy) breakfast wrap that still tastes good, but they did it.  and it was massive.The Juice might be slightly overpriced compared to the street alternatives, but I'll take it, especially later in the day when the other options close up shop.Again, very friendly service so I'll keep going back.",5,,3

I've also had the Chicken Chipotle Quesadilla which was also huge and really good. Now my last visit i decided to try something different and was VERY disappointed. I opted for the turkey burger deluxe which comes with sweet potato fries and water. Now I'm no Chef Ramsay but the fries were just tasteless, thank god the sweet potato are naturally sweet. But the greatest disappointment of them all was the turkey burger. usually a turkey burger consist of ground turkey nicely seasoned. Well not this, it look more like a rubber imitation turkey burger.

I told him that by the time it arrived, it would be cold after two hours of being out for delivery. He refused stating that it didn't make sense for the kitchen to remake the food.

I walked by this place after dining at my fave work week lunch spot downtown, GRK. They kindly had menus outside so I figured wouldn't hurt to grab one. I told my other foodie friend that we should give this spot a go. After reviewing the menu over and over I thought I had it narrowed it. All very healthy and clean eating choices. I was going to get the baked falafel sandwich but at the last minute went with my orginal pick of the the ginger wrap. This was grilled chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomato and a lite carrot ginger sauce. First, I had planned on staying and they didn't even ask so when I got my wrap it was in a to go bag, which is simply just a waste. The wrap was a decent size and had okay flavor. However after eating, I felt unsatisfied and wanted more. My friend had ordered the stamina quesadilla. This was an amazing size portion of food. Her only complaint was that it was a little messy for her liking. No true seating, more of a pick up and go sort of place. Pricing is decent for what their dishin' out.

My order was ready in less than 5 minutes which lead me to believe that everything was pre-cooked and not made to order as the guy told me.First of all, the whole wheat wrap was not a soft wrap; rather it was tough to chew on and unwrapped with the contents falling out when I placed it down on my desk.The chicken was bland and didn't have that grilled taste I was expecting. There were lots of tomatoes and lettuce but not much avocado. Lastly, the carrot ginger dressing didn't even taste like it. I couldn't detect the ginger taste at all in the wrap. The overall taste was quite bland and not flavorful at all.  For $9.25, I expected more.Perhaps since they are so new they need to iron out the kinks but for now, I'm not going to be returning any time soon.",,2,

When I walked in, I was somewhat surprised their was no line during peak lunch hour and the staff is unfriendly, I was not even greeted upon entering my order.  There were about five employees just standing behind the counter hanging out.  Also for some reason, they have the menus hanging on the wall on a huge sign lit up. I ordered the Stay Strong which was grilled chicken with lentils and brown rice.  Somehow this food was cooked in three minutes, yes three minutes!  Stamina Grill must think people are stupid and have no knowledge of what freshly prepared food tastes like.  The food did not have a fresh taste to it and was clearly warmed up in a microwave. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back.  This time I ordered the thai wrap which was a turkey burger with veggies and a so called low fat thai sauce.  The thai sauce was something bought in a grocery story and the turkey burger had zero taste.  I am not surprised the location is always empty, especially in the financial district, there should be a line during lunch hours. Stamina Grill and Juice Bar has a good concept but they need to actually freshly prepare and cook their food.",,1,
