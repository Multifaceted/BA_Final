Very hospitable and very caring for attention to guests. I love the drawing room here. Great chill atmosphere plus coffee service in the morning and full bar honesty policy always. Only open to guests. The best part of my experience is the breakfast and the dinner/movie. Breakfasts in the restaurant are delicious, offers a continental buffet and a full breakfast option. The dinner/movie option is best imo. Great 3 course dinner and a film in the private theatre. Oh, the bath products are quite good. Be sure to snag the linen spray.",

As for the food, it came with 2 biscuits, 3 savory bites, 1 cucumber and cream cheese sandwich and 4 dessert bites for each person. It took forever to get our tea that the food runner almost brought out the food before realizing we had not gotten our tea. Then it also took forever to get our check.

I have multiple experiences dining for brunch and dinner at the restaurant as this is one of my parents' favorite establishments in the city.  The restaurant is not the most innovative or avante garde, and so I understand why people are disappointed with the food if they are looking for that type of restaurant. However, as a lovely place for dining with friends and family in a calm and beautiful setting, the Crosby shines. The wait staff is great and always accommodating, and the restaurant never rushes you as a party. All the entrees and appetizers I've ordered have been very good. The salmon in particular is delicious.

This is probably closer to a 2 star than a 3 star service for the food and the service that we got for the afternoon tea. One red flag even before the food even came out was that the menu only featured 3 different kinds of teas and we had to ask if there was a more extensive menu. While the ""extensive"" tea menu did have a few more options, for $48 / person, the list was not impressive. The food looked and tasted like the restaurant wasn't really trying so it was hard to me to really justify the cost of the meal.To top it off, when we got the check, there was a 20% gratuity tacked on even though we were just a party of 2 and the tea from the extensive menu actually costs extra.The server did take those charges off when we inquired but this review is really meant for the hotel. If you are charging $48 / person, people have certain expectations and this below par.",1

Two words: Fancy and blandWhen you first get into the restaurant you feel like you walked into a luxurious place. Nicely decorated chairs, nice ambiance, nice tables, nice decorations, etc... Everything that you would expect from a fancy place. The waitresses and waiters are wearing uniforms. They make you feel like you are in England having British tea time. Once the food comes, oh dear, they come nicely decorated with fancy tea set, plates, and others. They are really nice looking. However, food was decent and nothing peculiar. They were bland and tasteless. Nothing that piqued my interest, made me remember it, and write good about it... Let's say it was a disappointment!In order to get to the restroom you must go through a maze that it is in the basement. The maze has lots of doors, and its takes long distance to get there. But, the restroom is clean, very clean. I guess it was worth it to go through all the workout to get to the restroom. Overall, this place is only eye pleasant, not so much of tummy pleasant.

We grabbed a table overlooking the gorgeous private garden and opted for the cocktail/bar plate option. I had a ""The Last Word"", an apparently classic cocktail composed of gin, green Chartreuse, Luxardo, and lime juice, and it was fantastic. The herbal flavors of the gin and Chartreuse worked really well together and the taste was rather unique. Just a note: You can only order drinks that would normally cost less than $17, which rules out the ""premium cocktails"" which are $25(!!!?) and, for some reason, the whiskey cocktails. We didn't get to choose the food: Everyone received the veggie sliders. They weren't something I would choose normally, but they were tasty, with a little spicy something on top. The screening room, located down in the basement, is of move-theater quality, which a large screen and comfortable bright-orange seats. On the way in, if you haven't already had enough to eat, you can grab a box of buttered popcorn and some water, which is a nice touch. We didn't love the film we saw (""Carol""), but the quality of the movies shown in general seems to be pretty good: lots of critically-acclaimed and award-nominated films.Tip: Definitely spend some time in the ultra-luxurious bathroom. I felt truly happy in there.",3

Met with friends here for afternoon tea. The tea set is $38 pp, which is in the mid range of afternoon tea sets. Everything was on pointe, from the waitstaff to the settings to the tea set itself. I ordered the chamomile flowers tea, which had an amazing floral scent and delicate flavor. The set came with the usual scones with cream and jam, tea sandwiches, and desserts. The scones came warmed, which was a nice touch. I especially enjoyed the cinnamon scone. The sandwiches were traditional salmon, cucumber, egg, and turkey, so nothing special, but absolutely no complaints about the quality of ingredients or taste. I could barely get to desserts, but the little cookies were yummy.The atmosphere in this beautiful restaurant is what makes it stand out from other tea places. It's beautiful and hip but very comfortable and casual. Not the least fussy like other tea places. The service is very unhurried, so you don't feel rushed. Would definitely go back.",3

29,,11/2/2016,0,,"Washington, DC",K V.,3,4.0,36,"Best afternoon tea in NYC!As a Brit (former Londoner), I'm very particular about afternoon tea. (The Ritz really IS number 1; the Dorchester ""must try harder"", as they say on old school reports.) And I've done afternoon tea in every one of the prestigious hotels here in NYC .. only to be largely disappointed. (Note to the Plaza, the Pierre, the Ritz-Carlton, et al: please, please just drop the dreaded nonsense of sticking currants/raisins into the scones - that abomination is strictly for kids only, at least as per the traditional British afternoon tea. Talking of abomination, the Ritz-Carlton's afternoon tea scored A for Abomination on virtually every front.) By comparison, the Crosby St Hotel gets it spot on. I was surprised, because it it not the stereotypical, conventional, traditional afternoon tea: it is a very rock-n-roll 2016 version. But it adheres religiously, sensitively and gallantly to the timeless principles of the afternoon tea ceremony, and with aplomb. I go back there again and again, as they constantly change the afternoon tea menu. The only quibble is that sometimes the servers are clueless about how to serve tea: (i) do not put the tiered tray directly in front of (under the nose of) the patron!! Shudder. That is where the empty plate goes!! (ii) you must at least ONCE refill the tea-pot, especially since the pot only contains 2 cups!! Plan on the patron drinking 4 cups of tea - this is a tea ceremony, not a pop-in to Starbucks/Teavana for a grab-n-go!!  Ugh.",

The bathrooms are incredible in terms of the marbling and the size. The location is incredible since it's right inside Soho, literally behind the Soho Broadway shopping strip.THE FOOD: The food and drinks were solid. We had Dark Horse wine and finger mini-cupcakes. Both were delicious. THE SERVICE: The bartenders in the lower level (Shout out to Ella!) are not only great at refilling your glass and keeping the bar area tidy, but they are also super friendly and always smiling.

I can honestly say that the pastries ie. macroon, petite fours and all the other dessert were incredibly disgusting.  I love sweets..to a fault and i just sat there trying to figure out what guey element they put in this pastry.  Their pastry chef should be iced with frosting and asked to stand out in the cold. For Soho, their pastry was an abomination.  Unfortunately, we did not order the course that had cupcakes or chocolate cover strawberries because we were led to believe it was included in the menu we ordered which is actually not very detailed. I don't think i should spend my money to redo this experience that was botched by a new waiter.

I don't miss the sweets, but they do give you Voss water by the bed. Nice. I came here solo. I think if I shared this room, the bathroom might be a problem. The size of the bathroom is fine. Shower no tub. I had a problem with the door being so close to the toilet. You might hit yourself at one point. Ha ha. Unless you are okay with a companion not closing the door while he/she does their business, then you're okay with their standard room lolThe room is very cozy, well decorated. My friend up to chat before we went to dinner. She found it very comfortable to hang out. The couch was comfortable, the large windows and high ceilings were nice. I do have to warn those who are light sleepers, and those who sleep early ... the garbage truck that runs on Crosby woke me up every night. This is why I still miss the Trump hotel. I wouldn't have that problem there. I was on the 4th floor facing Crosby. Not sure how it is facing the east side. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Free Wi-fi in the room is always a plus in my books especially when you're paying this much for accommodations. Thanks for the hospitality!Hope to return soon!",1

Each time the waitstaff left us feeling a bit miffed.  Like waiting on a fellow staff member who took her meal at the table next to us and not acknowledging us for 15 minutes. The food was tasty, but the lack-luster of service made me want to leave the hotel for food and drink. A wait person in a different SoHo venue mentioned to us the waitstaff at The Crosby are given benefits, vacation time, and generally better compensated. I do not know if these politics play into the service one receives in the restaurant/bar areas, but this review is for the HOTEL. Not the bar/restaurant.Overall hotel stay - great experience.

I visited with a friend on a weekday afternoon and a lot of people were there chilling in the courtyard of the hotel restaurant. The weather was beautiful with sunlight shining through the windows of the hotel. We wanted to try the afternoon tea, and it did not disappoint (maybe except for their service). The tea set was absolutely gorgeous and it was not worn like some places i have been to. Their scones are definitely one of the best I had in the city where they warmed it up so the outside is a bit crispy, remind me of the ones I had in London! The fruit tart was buttery and the cake was chocolaty, LOVE IT! Macaron was just on point as well. However, one item I did not like was the sandwiches. I do not understand why so many tea places lacks attention to the sandwich. It might be on the bottom of the tray, but it still deserves some attention! There were barely anything in the middle of the sandwich, it was more like two pieces of bread put together. But overall, it was a good afternoon tea with beautiful decor.If only the service was a bit better, I think it would deserve five stars. I came here paying a certain amount of money and I demand the same service in return. I sat down and decided what I want, but I had to wave my hands for almost 10 minutes before they attend to me. If you did not see me, that is fine, but I obviously called them before the other guests a few tables away from us but yet they still decide to ignore me.

52,,8/24/2015,0,,"New York, NY",K V.,0,5.0,3,"The best afternoon tea in NYC by far. Having lived in London, I've been very spoiled when it comes to knowing what a good afternoon tea is. Here in NYC, I've been disappointed not to find a single worthy afternoon tea. The Plaza's tea (twice) was poor (with stale bread, amazingly); the Pierre was unexceptional, dull even; the RItz-Carlton's was a calamity; Lady Mendl's was the best of the bunch, but only passably charming (but still mediocre). Then I discovered the Crosby Street Hotel's afternoon tea. Goodness! THIS is how afternoon tea is done properly - and with aplomb. I would actually call this a sort of 'rock-and-roll afternoon tea', while carefully acknowledging the sacred rules of the afternoon tea ritual.  Being a little 'rock-and-roll' (the afternoon tea, not me), I wouldn't therefore have expected to like it. However, it knocked my socks off entirely - a careful marriage of rock-and-roll panache with tradition, elegance and the greatest sophistication. By the way, I've never tasted a better blending of matcha and white chocolate (their mini tiramisu) - my taste buds could only think ""crikey!!"" for the next 5 minutes, and in a very good way!Every single aspect of this afternoon tea was flawless (including Kit Kemp's china designs, and the treats/cakes, each of which left my taste-buds in a riot), but a special note for the Marigold tea: the most sacred of all principles when it comes to afternoon tea is that the anchor - the tea - should never be eclipsed by the food and should easily be able to hold its own against even the most astonishing, ravishing treats. Rarely does that happen (at least here in NYC) - and this Marigold tea simply stole the show. There is no need to go anywhere else for afternoon tea in NYC.",1

The only redeeming thing was the scones and clotted cream with jam. But that's not what we came for! I can get a scone anywhere.  We got the champagne tea which was $52 and included a glass of champagne.  The regular tea was $40. Which would lead you to assume that the glass of champagne is $12, correct? NOPE. When we were done with our tea we asked for another glass of champagne. Guess how much that extra glass of champagne was? $32. So an afternoon tea for 3 ended up being $100 each. Absurd. Why didn't the waiter tell us how much that flute was? Just so disappointed.

There are great amenities in the room including a mini bar chock full of gourmet snacks and drinks, an awesome pro hair dryer (none of this tiny con-air crap) and tons of cable to watch.The in room dining menu is just as good as the restaurant and changes seasonally which I love since I stay at Firmdale hotels frequently throughout the year. They also have a seasonal cocktail menu to die for. Other special touches include turn down service with extra bottles of water and an herbal calming spray for the pillows, and most times I stay at this hotel chain I am given a little gift at check in -collar stays, chocolates, body oil. But the thing that really compelled me to review is my last visit. I was in NYC on business and got food poisoning. Being away from home and ill was such an awful experience, but the Crosby staff jumped to the challenge and took care of me! First they put me in touch with a Doctor who was able to give me advice over the phone and said he could come to the hotel if I wasn't better in a few hours. When he advised me to get gatorade I didn't know what to do as I couldn't go 15 minutes without puking. Crosby concierge to the rescue!

First, the lobby is stunning!  Truly beautiful, inviting and funky all at the same time...with interesting sculptures, flattering lighting, British staff who will open the door for you and ask if you need any help (I love that...both the accents and the service) and instant access to the super-cool Crosby Bar (where I will go on my next date!). To the right of the lobby are a flight of stairs heading down to some gorgeously decorated and maintained meeting rooms and a posh screening room with super comfy orange seats and a very nice sized screen and stage area.  If I had a film to screen, I would do it here (pricing for the screening room is on their site...$600 an hour with a two hour minimum).  The cocktail hour before the screening was held in one of the main meeting rooms, which look more like Victorian (yet modern) living rooms.  Comfy atmosphere, lots of seating, more flattering lighting, competent and friendly bartenders, and very good food (from the restaurant upstairs, I assume).  I couldn't help but be amazed anywhere I looked...there was something interesting to look at EVERYWHERE.  Also, as another Yelper mentioned, the ""public area"" bathrooms are hidden away in hallways...and they are gorgeous.  You just have to visit them.  I can't wait to go back to the Crosby Bar for a cocktail and some dinner.  This hotel truly WOWed me.",3

It is definitely more expensive than many other options in town, but it is such a wonderful place so calm, peaceful, thoughtfully designed, and oh so visually stimulating. It was by far my favorite hotel experience I've ever had in New York, which would also include the following:St. Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Every W Hotel, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Essex House, The Hotel on Rivington, The Thompson, The Time, The Gansevoort, The Waldorf... Okay, you get it. I'm spoiled. But staying here was the most tremendous spoiling of all. The robes were white and plush. The bed was comfortable and cozy. The room was thoughtfully designed without being overly pretentious. Wifi was actually complimentary with your stay. Very rare in most hotels. The eco touches to the hotel were apt and were spot on without glaring ""green"" such as: wonderful dual flush toilets in the downstairs bathrooms and reclaimed wood floors. One thing I especially found amazing about it's green standards is that downstairs where all of the conference rooms etc were, the rooms were quite chilly. I know this sounds a bit odd, but the rooms were not in use at all (except for me taking pictures and the maintenance man passing through) and the hotel seemed to intelligently not heat the space while not being used. So many places overheat in the winter, and overcool in the summer. I didn't have dinner here, but I did enjoy the breakfast buffet two days in a row and it was absolutely scrumptious. The $20 gives you unlimited yogurt, cereal, cold muesli, dates, fresh fruit, muffins, croissants, etc, as well as coffee/tea and a fresh juice.

I work in SoHo and walk past CSH on the Lafayette side, frequently.  With the below-street level walk-down entrance, it has always appeared so secret-garden-like and friendly to me.  So much so that I planned a work happy hour here just this week.  We have an approximate 40-headcount office and we typically have a 60% show rate to our monthly mingles/happy hours.  When we tried to make reservations at CSH they kindly informed us that it's ""first come first serve"" and that they do not take reservations for anything other than dining.  Fair enough, and we thought it might be easier for us to arrive in the 5:30-6p.m. range and find adequate seating and/or unobtrusive standing room, at best.  No problem.  CSH was busy, which is great for business and understandable, especially at that time of day and in this part of town.  Heck, most bars and restaurants in NYC are expected to be busy at that time of day.  However, when we kindly requested for an exception to be made to allow us to seat out on the outer [vacant] patio, we were told they could not satisfy our request because it was for ""hotel guests only"" and they were fully booked.  (so does this mean they were expecting a surge of hotel guests to come down at once and sit outside in the 65* weather?).  We then asked to sit at a table, but we were also turned down because that was reserved for dining guests.  No exceptions could be made and nothing was offered to accommodate our 20+ guests.  At $16.50/drink for a 2+ hour visit for a very thirsty group of business professionals having come off of a long work day, my guess is that this would have amounted to a bill somewhere in the $1K-$1.5K range.  It is very possible that that perhaps CSH does not need the business as they did not make any effort to accommodate our needs.  But from a local and growing company's standpoint, it is common business courtesy and etiquette to at least make some effort in attempt to service the needs of a large group of well-paying patrons (on our company's dime, might I add, so it's not as though we were paying separate checks and/or one at a time).  Alas, this was anything but a good first impression and I was quite saddened by it not only because I suggested this place of business as a host for our work happy hour, but also because had we enjoyed ourselves and been treated with respect, we would most likely and frequently - returned our business as a group and/or with current and prospective clients.  CSH may have beautiful décor and be located in a thriving part of town,  but their business practices are quite the opposite of beautiful and rather deterring at best.",9

Dessert - a a sticky toffee date cake with vanilla ice cream. The slice of cake was so large I could barely eat it, and it was to die for. Even my guest was impressed. To top it off, we went downstairs to view the movie, and they had free popcorn and drinks!! Excellent night, would absolutely go again.",1

Last time I saw her in London, we had afternoon tea at Kensington Gardens, so I thought it proper to fit afternoon tea into her visit, stateside. I've walked up and down these blocks many times, but somehow missed Crosby Street Hotel. It is chicly decorated and a visual sensation. I made late afternoon reservations for afternoon tea. It was pretty empty until the early happy hour crowd started to pour in.Since I've been drinking bubbly left and right for other events within a very condensed timeline, we opted for the non-champagne afternoon tea, which is approximately $34 pp  We shared a pot of tea (and they were great about adding hot water) and squealed like schoolgirls when the tiered tray was brought out. - The tea set and plates were gorgeous. My gf said they were ""so posh"" in her Irish/British accent.- We loved the finger sandwiches. The bread was slightly toasted and the decrusted. There were four flavors and I loved them all. - There were also 4 scones (2 types) total with clotted cream and two types of preserves. We each had a scone and this really did us in! - The middle tier was the least exciting. There were mini cupcakes with weird cream cheese (?) frosting, cheesecake/brownie bars, and a lemon tart with fresh berries. We ate the berries from the tart, didn't touch the bars, and I had a bite of the cupcakes. I wonder if you can swamp out the middle tier for more sandwiches, because those were divine.Service was great and obtrusive. We sat there for a while and someone stopped by every once in a while. Would definitely go back! There is also outdoor seating in the back...",3

That being said, we adore the hotel and can't wait for an excuse to go back.",1

I also had the ribeye steak for 2 (by myself! .. ahahaaa!  I'm only 5'7"", 150lbs) .. holy schit!!  I was fighting a much loved battle eating that oversized delicious piece of meat - our neighbor table guests were staring with saliva running down their mouths; I'm a carnivore!  My date had a salad (can't remember which one but was delicious with burrata) and the burger ... she was flip-flopping on the chair with a big smile on her face :).. they do their meat right and we enjoyed it.  The staff acts pleasant and in this day and age where customer service is seriously lacking - these ladies and gents keep it ""tight"" to remind you they want to keep the ambiance chill and sophisticated.  Steak tartare here is now my go to place.  Wine selection was also very decent.  Never stayed here ..

The room been throughly cleaned, and we are very picky about clean.  During our stay the maid service was great, all supplies were replenished.A couple of the earlier yelper's comments were critical about the service and after our experience, those critical comments seem really off base.  We stay in 5 star european hotels every year, and have stayed in many of the nicest hotels in NYC over the years, and the Crosby is in that class -- it is a small hotel, so it does not have every amenity, but what they did not have, the concierge found a great close by appropriate solution.  Some hotels concierges only seem to have stuffy recommendations (or kickback recommendations), but that definitely was not the case at the Crosby.  The front door staff is great, they always had an honest smile.  It is not easy getting a cab in soho on a saturday night, but they tried very hard and succeeded.A minor down side is that they stop serving food in the bar at 10 or 11, but the bar waitress served us some great cookies (no charge) and mixed nuts, which was fine -- it must have to do with their license, since they can serve food to guests outside of the bar late at night.  Also the fabric on the ottoman in our room was a bit tired, but that happens in almost any hotel.Overall we had a great visit, loved the hotel and staff, and will be back next time we stay in soho.",1

I'm sure the hotel is lovely as the space itself is excellent.My wife and I decided to try the 3 course dinner and movie combo for $50 a head which seemed a decent value given the caliber of the hotel (which is very swish etc). The food on the evening was fine, nothing over the top but I had a decent middle-of-the-road steak. Service overall was poor on the night, including in the restaurant, though the main issue with the review is to follow.The movie (Limitless) cuts out halfway through the thing which as anyone can imagine would be an annoying issue considering you've invested the money and had the meal...then boom it cuts out!! So does the hotel sort out the technical issue with the movie after you've been taunted with the first half or does the hotel apologize profusely and try to win back your affection!? Neither - what happened was the hotel refused to offer anything except that we were ""allowed to enjoy a free movie at a later date"". No customer service representative ensuring a top establishment treats its customers well when it screws up - which is in my mind a complimentary dinner and movie for 2 seeing as though thats what we paid for in the first place and never received in full. This was not even considered and when my wife spoke to the hotel rep she was spoken down to and alerted to the fact that the hotel ""did not have to offer anything to reconcile the situation.""So against our better judgment we eventually go back when a movie is playing which we want to see, though we have 1 more friend with us for the movie only. They charge us $20 for the one person to WATCH THE MOVIE ONLY. Getting the ticket itself was a chore as the hostess at the restaurant hardly looked up from her laptop to acknowledge our presence. We arrived a 7:50 for the 8pm movie, there was one party of 5 in front of us, and we went down to the movie at 8:05. The hostess was about as rude and pompous as I've ever seen and this is my 4th year in NYC. In summary, if you want a beautiful spot this is definitely a place to go. But if you want any substance or warmth in anything do not bother with this establishment. I acknowledge this may not apply to the hotel as I have not stayed the night - my review is purely based on the restaurant and the quality of the service for the Sunday movie. It was very very poor and I will never return.",1

If we hadn't had any contact with the staff, I would have given the hotel 5 stars.  I can only give 2, because staff botched every opportunity to provide good service.  Hotel guests may opt to be served in the guest-only areas by room service personnel.  We had afternoon tea in the garden during which we had to go inside and ask the front desk to call room service 3 times, and called directly on the house phone twice, due to forgotten service items, more drinks and the check.   They then mis-charged us so that took additional time.  Needless to say it was not enjoyable.  Another example is that the front desk called us prior to our trip and encouraged us to take advantage of the 2 p.m. check-in time. We told them we would, but when we arrived at 2:45, we were told that the room wasn't ready.  We had ordered some snacks that we were still noshing on that room service took away while we were out. It took two requests, four hours apart, to get them replaced.  We ordered champagne that was delivered warm in a half-filled ice bucket.  There is no self-serve ice and we had to call 3 times for more ice (it was late afternoon, not generally a busy time).  Housekeeping did not return used glasses or provide enough bath tissue or Kleenex.   There's more, but why go on.  If you stay here, expect to pay top dollar to be frustrated by poor service.",2

125,,12/25/2009,31,,"Sherman Oaks, CA",Debbie D.,0,2.0,6,"Haven't stayed here yet, but after a visit to the lobby and Crosby Bar, I may have changed my mind about staying here in the future.  We stayed at the Soho Hotel in London, also part of the English Firmdale chain, and had an absolutely amazing experience.  The hotel, staff and public spaces were second to none.  The staff, in particular, was lovely.  We were anxiously awaiting the Crosby Street Hotel and hoped it would hold up to our experience in London.  Unfortunately, we were treated rudely immediately, as if we were looky-loos who didn't belong.  I felt compelled to tell the staff that we had stayed at the Soho, just to get them to realize that we deserved to be treated as any other guest or potential guest would be treated.  We had reservations for afternoon tea in the Crosby Bar and nearly left after the snooty attitude we experienced from the lobby staff, including the doorman and the concierge.  We were very disappointed.  I'm concerned that Firmdale has priced this hotel out of the market, with standard rooms at over $500 per night.  They have priced it even higher than their London properties, which is surprising.  The spaces are absolutely gorgeous, as with any Firmdale property.  Unfortunately, the attitude of the staff took away from the beauty of the place...and took away from an otherwise magical Christmas Eve in Soho.",2
