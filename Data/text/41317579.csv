Come here if you have a love for Pickle Back Shots or if you are trying to impress someone else's that loves Pickle Back Shots! The shots start at $8 and get a bit more pricier depending on how Faaaaannnnccccyyyy you'd like to get with them. The place may seem crowded when you first enter because it's a bit narrow with the bar but if you Lee waking to the back the space opens up. With a lot more seating in the back.The bar is dark making it a bit romantic! Well as romantic as you can get while having Pickle Back Shots! Tasty Pickle Back Shots! Do not come here hungry, unless you want to fill up on Spicy Pickles & Jalapeño Olives, which are tasty in my opinion.",1,,
1,Monika Z.,"East Bronx, NY",7,3,1,5.0,10/19/2018,"Packed Thursday-Saturday but otherwise fantastic bar. Great date spot if earlier in the day. If you like pickle juice this is the place. Reasonably priced drinks, great music and really good service.",1,,
2,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,326,593,4.0,9/9/2018,"We stopped in here one Sunday night for a couple of after-dinner drinks. Place was quiet given the time, but bar staff were friendly and hospitable. We started with a bottle of wine (really reasonably priced - and good!) and soon decided to have a second one. We then finished the night with a couple of rounds of their famous picklebacks. They have different varieties and we tried a couple (regular and smoky), both of which were really good.The place is done up nicely, with exposed brick, vines and plants and classy, rustic decor elements. From the looks of it I think there was a band earlier that evening but they had wrapped up when we got there. Good place for drinks, I'll be back to try more of their picklebacks at a more busy time perhaps.",1,,1
3,Micky C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,4.0,11/14/2018,really cool atmosphere during the fall season. great drinks and cocktail menuWill go again,,,
4,Amit G.,"Coram, NY",103,58,423,5.0,10/1/2018,"My favorite bar in the city! Close to union square, my favorite part of the city. The one thing you have to try when you go there is the pickle-back shot! You basically do a whiskey shot followed by a shot of pickle juice. Yes, I know it sounds disgusting but trust me, it's delicious! Once you try the basic one, go for the spicy pickle back and the Bentley. They also have a good selection of craft beers and pretty good choices for mixed drinks. Their old fashioned hits the spot. The decor and vibe is on point and the place gets lit on the weekends. Cheers!",3,1,2
5,Kathy M.,"Saint Paul, MN",254,113,2268,5.0,8/8/2018,"I absolutely loved everything about this place!From the outside, it's an unassuming, unmarked, no-sign doorway into HEAVEN! The decor was charming, there was live music and PICKLE BACKS! There were 4 of us and we were able to find a table towards the back, near the music trio. A vocalist sitting on a Cajon and a tambourine wrapped around her foot; a keyboardist and a guitarist playing melodic renditions of top 40s hits from the 90s and 2000s. It really set the mood right for us. So, we're sitting in this cute place with live music - only thing left if service and drinks. BOTH WERE AWESOME! The bartender was friendly and attentive and I just love taking shots with pickle brine! And, for some strange reason, it's not very common. But The Belfry specializes in it, which means they specialize in making my heart happy! I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in NYC!",,,
6,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",399,484,1233,4.0,8/30/2018,"Try their picklebacks. What's a picklelback, you ask? It is a shot of whiskey, scotch or tequila with some kind of pickle juice as a chaser. Smokey, sour or spicy---you choose.I nearly passed by this adorable venue as no sign was visible and I saw a variety of plants outside. I needed to take a look at the card to confirm it was the Belfry.Once inside, this massive establishment had several seating options: the bar, tables, counter style, front or back of the bar.The interior was gorgeous and unfortunately, I was unable to take any photos.The bar was fully stocked and then some with a fun menu of craft cocktails, wine, beer and yes, the pickleback.They have some nibbles such as pickles to eat but I'm unaware of other food options.Live music kicks off at 8 pm each night and I was able to listen to some.Happy hour special run until 7 pm.After ordering my old reliable, Rose wine--i was encouraged by my friend to try the pickleback I chose the Wiliam Wallace--a smooth whiskey chased by pickle juice spicy in nature (their online menu stated sour but the chalkboard indicated spicy---and I love spicy everything).The experience was like no other and I was an instant fan!.By the way, it gets real noisy and crowded (seemingly with NYU students as well) but their music is off the hook!I highly recommend this place. A lot of fun and great atmosphere.You might be listening to Nickleback while trying a pickleback.Good stuff.",30,17,30
7,Liana L.,"Manhattan, NY",120,28,37,5.0,10/24/2018,"Today I've decided to stop by and make a last minute surprise for my coworker. I didn't make any reservation and they gave me a nice table on the back that fit my whole party of 9 people!! The happy hour at this place is FANTASTIC! All wine bottles half off? YES PLEASE!! :))  At 8pm, they had some super cool live band playing live! Lovely music, good drinks, amazing vibe. Best place for happy hour or for a romantic/fun date  Oh! Did I mention the decor? It's the cutest thing ever!!!! Think about Urban Outfitters walk into a bar... yes, this is belfry! :)",1,1,1
8,Joan S.,"New York, NY",320,80,209,5.0,6/27/2018,"Hands down, my favorite bar in NYC. As soon as you walk in, you are enveloped in the cozy, warm, and rustic atmosphere. I've taken a handful of my out-of-town friends here, and it has become one of their favorite bars. Drinks & Deals:They have great happy hour deals (2-7PM)! Their happy hour is until 7pm, you can get beer or a glass of wine for $5. I had Pinot Grigio and also a white Russian. I'm a lover of coffee so White Russian was absolutely delicious ($15). Their menu is seasonal so I had this during the winter. During the summer, I had their cider beer ($8) which is pretty good. The only downside to this place is that they don't sell food. Service:AMAZING service. I've been here probably 5 times (I stopped keeping count after awhile...) and each time there is someone different on their staff that serves us. However, each time the service has been absolutely phenomenal. Of not, it can get pretty packed later in the evening.Atmosphere:10/10! If the cutely-decorated entrance with its many plants isn't inviting enough..this place's amazing ambience is immediately apparent with the dim-lighting and lovely interior decorations. They change up their decoration every season. Right now (it's summer), they have plants hanging from the wall. During the winter, they have the place decorated with pine cones and lovely ceiling wintry decorations. They often have live music playing in the evening, elevating an already wonderful experience. Overall:My favorite bar in NYC, no question about it.",1,,
9,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,5/12/2018,"We came on a Friday night and it was packed. We managed to snag some seats at the front, but we still had to order our drinks at the bar.This place is known for its pickle backs so we all ordered the classic. I don't think I've ever had a proper pickle back, so this was an eye opening experience. I don't think it actually matters which liquor you drink because the pickle brine instantly neutralizes any burning sensation   or taste of hard alcohol. Extremely deadly since that means I can't really taste how strong it is.Steps to take:1. Take shot of hard alcohol2. Take shot of brine juice3. Rinse and repeat for a good night.",3,4,5
10,Vivian C.,"Cincinnati, OH",382,99,352,5.0,6/18/2018,"What a great hang out spot! My friend and I came here early Sunday afternoon. They had happy hour special from 2pm to 7pm that was half off bottles of wine and beers. My friend and I shared a bottle of prosecco. With the happy hour deal, it only came out to be $20. The staff told us that there was live music playing around 4pm. We couldn't stay that long but would have loved to listened to some blues. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The waitstaff would come by to make sure our water and flutes were filled and the bartender even offer us free cookies. Decor was nicely done. Casual, intimate vibe.",,,1
11,Daniella L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,90,42,5.0,5/10/2018,"The Last Waltz: Has Mezcal, Pineapple, & Chiptole - it has a smoked and spiced taste to it. Midwest Mule - This drink was sweet and refreshing, great for the summer. Classic - Pickle Back, Irish Whiskey and Sour Pickle. Down side, they do not serve food but you're more than welcome to being outside food in. Waitress was super nice and welcoming. Great place for a date night and meeting friends up for drinks. Super laid back bar. I would totally go there again!",,,
12,Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",101,316,856,4.0,2/19/2018,"This was such a cozy bar tucked away on a busy Avenue. The inside decor is really relaxing and the dim lighting in the late afternoon and early evening is quite nice. Service here is also really great! They have really fun cocktails and seem to change up the menu quite frequently. The winter specials included items such as a hot toddy and an Irish coffee. Presentation of these cocktails were really nice. Place also seems to have a lot of different events going on, different themes on different nights, and some nights even centered around specific drinks. Think I also remember seeing something about a trivia night here. Seems like a great local bar to come hang out in that most people wouldn't normally step into. This place definitely has a lot of charm.",1,,
13,Jess J.,"Brooklyn, NY",249,148,359,3.0,7/22/2018,"Nice decor, but not good for gathering if you're looking to have a conversation on a Thursday evening. We made reservations for 7 and was seated in the back tables. The bar was already crowded and loud. Then a 4 person band set up right behind our table including a giant bass and drums which was fun, but not made conversation. May be a great date place if you're looking to enjoy some funky music. You can't hear anything at that point.We ordered the specialty cocktails. New Old Fashioned was made with Suntory but it seemed like they were able to sub some of the liquor choices in the set cocktails. My friend had the raspberry gimlet type drink, which was pretty tart. The highlight for me was probably just the jalapeño olives.",,,
14,Jane M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,258,376,5.0,7/1/2018,"Their happy hour deal is awesome! You can order bottles of wine for 50% off. The interior is spacious and feels homey. I love the copious amounts of plants which created an inviting environment to this place. They have a selection of reds, whites, rose and prosseco for the happy hour deal. I think this place is also well known for their picklebacks. I would def be back with friends during happy hour.",,,2
15,Trish S.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",29,42,1,5.0,4/27/2018,"I'm not one to normally review bars but I really enjoyed my experience here! Came on a Wednesday night and got a nice table in the back, had a few glasses of wine and my friend had some beers. It was crowded around 6:45 but not too busy you couldn't hear each other.Around 8 a live band came to play and they were great! The only difficulty was that the bar was PACKED, standing room and everything, so it got really loud. The waitress had a 9:00 reservation on the table (didn't know you could reserve tables at belfry....who does that?) but she nicely moved us and gave us a FREE PICKLEBACK! To top it off, this drunk girl spilled my entire glass of wine and the bartender happily refilled it for me....this is some of the best nyc bar service I've ever seen! Definitely go to belfry for a date (on a weeknight...it gets wild on the weekend) or to catch up with friends. I loved it and can't wait to return!",2,,1
16,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,988,6100,3.0,9/13/2017,"In the area kinda bar hoping we passed by this place, my friend mentioned it was decent to check out.Drinks seems like pickle backs are the thing to have here I must say never had it so why not give it a try...A shot of Jameson & pickle juice seems to be what makes this ever so popular shot.. It's interesting Not quite a combination I would go for? U just need to take a deep breath & bottoms up!! Whoa not terrible the pickle juice takes away the harsh taste of the Jameson, definitely interesting to say the least. As for the place decent size, good music playing very dimly lit good vibe & atmosphere. Service was good & prices are decent good place for drinks.",5,2,3
17,Andrew T.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",225,22,1,1.0,10/15/2018,"Inconsistent. I frequently go here with no issues. Went on a Friday night and was stopped at the door for wearing ""sweatpants."" The bar was fairly empty at 2 am. For whatever reason the bouncer considered my grey slacks ""sweatpants"" so it was a no go. Stupid rules with stupid management. Will not be back.",1,,
18,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,4.0,2/15/2018,"Really like the vibe of this bar for a happy hour or date night. The half off wine bottles happy hour is a great deal and pretty unique. We shared a perfectly decent pinot noir for just $17. The atmosphere is quite lovely complete with hanging light fixtures, decorative branches, and candles to set the mood. I wouldn't classify it as a ""fancy"" place but it looks like they serve some alright cocktails (as well as their famous picklebacks) and it's definitely a not a grimy dive you'd be embarrassed to take someone. It would be nice if they offered any sort of food or bar snack, but at least you can bring it from outside. I recommend grabbing a panini from Bite across the street and uncorking here.",2,,2
19,Gen W.,"Denver, CO",62,143,23,4.0,7/27/2018,This place is fun. It gets crowded on the weekends. It definitely seems more like a late twenties crowd then anything else but they have creative drinks an interesting decor.,,,
20,James N.,"Jersey City, NJ",135,9,1,1.0,10/11/2018,"They have a ""dress code"" - meaning, the bouncer turns away people who don't ""look"" right. The excuse I was given was that shorts weren't allowed - even though there were people inside wearing shorts AND despite the fact that I've already been in the Belfry before with shorts on. Definitely hit up this glorified college bar if you're dying to get an authentic douchebag-y velvet rope experience. If you want to grab a relaxed drink with friends, there are plenty of other bars that won't turn your money away.",,,
21,Malika L.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,42,0,5.0,10/2/2018,"Cozy bar in Union Square. Nice staff who take it upon themselves to learn and memorize your name. Drinks are fairly priced, even outside of happy hour.",,,
22,Kayla F.,"Manhattan, NY",293,64,10,5.0,10/9/2018,"This place is a very swanky, chic, hip New York bar. Was introduced to pickle-backs here, new favorite thing! But their signature cocktails are very well made and yummy. Cool atmosphere!",,,
23,Ami R.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,106,102,3.0,9/16/2018,"Stars off for no live music on Saturday night. Their Bees Knees was a bit too tart, and trust me while they are always a lil tart, this was too much.",,,
24,Magda O.,"Washington, DC",0,6,0,2.0,11/1/2018,"Nothing worse than over paying for a mediocre cocktail by inexperienced unfriendly chilly bartenders who look like they just got out of bed. The women who work here put themselves together like professionals, but the guys? No thanks. I would rather drink at a proper dive bar which is where they belong, and in the dark. $15?? This is not Park avenue but the plants are delightful.",,,
25,Urszula P.,"Manhattan, NY",57,151,472,5.0,4/11/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by this bar. I highly recommend it if you have a group that needs a space for happy hour as this place takes reservations! It's incredible and unheard of. This is a pretty bar with wood design and high ceilings so I also appreciated the ambiance.It also allows food to be delivered or brought in so your friends enjoy drinks and food. Plus the staff actually paid attention to us. My friends and I took advantage of this and grabbed some hummus fronext door for shareable snacks. If you are a fan, they had live music starting around 9 when we were leaving (likely only specific nights).",4,,1
26,Lindsey H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/26/2018,"Romance and Trevor absolutely kill it, great guys make the experience here a million times more fun. If you're in the city definitely make a trip here, get the pickle back!",,,
27,Anne-Marie G.,"Goldens Bridge, NY",22,53,67,5.0,3/31/2018,"Absolutely loved this small, intimate, gorgeous little speakeasy with live jazz. Bartender chomping gum (never a good look) and a bit loopy, but he obv cares about his cocktails and when he got my order wrong ""bought"" my spicy pickles for me (which were absolutely delicious by the way)So a win win.Alas had to move my car so had to jet way too soon... but I'll def be back. Great vibe, highly recommend!",2,,1
28,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/12/2017,"Love this spot! Its a very eclectic cozy little bar that gets very crowded and fun on the weekends and later on the week nights. Its a little small, so not the best for groups but is great for a date or drinks with a few friends. Their picklebacks, what they're known for, are very good but so are their cocktails!",,,
29,Christie L.,"Medford, MA",310,234,682,4.0,9/28/2017,"PICKLE JUICE CHASERS?!  Ew gross... why would anyone ever do that right?! BUT NO. They are pretty damn good chasers. Apparently this is a thing and Belfrys is notoriously known for picklebacks.  A shot of Jameson followed by a shot of pickle juice. Who knew? There are 4 different options for picklebacks. My friends deemed the spicy one was the best so that's what we got. The pickle juice takes away the burn from the Jameson and is quite tasty I might say. The place is a decent size, nice decor and good music. I wish there was some more standing room though or maybe some space for dancing.",1,1,1
30,Ramya S.,"Manhattan, NY",91,16,9,4.0,9/4/2017,"As a fan of picklebacks, I was pleasantly surprised by this spot. There's four different options for picklebacks (we opted for the regular kind). I didn't like the spicy pickle juice as much but that may be personal preference. Also try out their cocktails - I had the Rearden which had tequila, mint, and ginger and was great.",3,,
31,Wei Teresa C.,"New York, NY",82,107,189,3.0,9/30/2017,"Busy, cute bar with dim and cute lights! Came here on a double date around 8 or 9pm on a weekend and we were able to get a little section of the shelf by the edge right next to the bar. Still, it was was so crowded our drinks were getting knocked around if we held it, and it was hard to talk (what's new, haha!). Still, we stayed for a good part of 2 hours before heading out. The pickebacks were surprisingly delicious and easy to go down. It's basically a shot of Jameson with pickle juice to chase, and even though it sounded weird and it was the first I'd heard of it, I highly recommend it! Other than that, the cocktails ran about $20 which were a little steep IMO even for NYC. I had a hard time getting in because my face is a little young and I had my CA ID. The bouncer asked for my age and since I'd just turned 22 but spent my birthday studying, I answered incorrectly and he started doubting me since. He asked for my address and I gave him my college address, which was different from my permanent home one. Obviously he started doubting me and almost wouldn't let me in. He's doing his job, but it's a LITTLE ridiculous considering that my ID and face don't look all that different - like it's young but you can tell it's me. Just a little funny anecdote but it deters me from going back even more haha. Coat check available!",1,1,
32,Ellie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,151,400,4.0,2/18/2017,Solid bar that has good pickle shot or should I say picklebacks...We got some whisky shots with our pickle shots and not everyone was a fan of the picklebacks but I loved it I think its a fun concept. We also got lots of beer and wine. We enjoyed the IPA the most though - nice draft beer. Service was a bit slow as we waited 20 minutes for our beer but the place was very busy. Now lets say this - I came here Saturday night and the place had a giant line outside so try to come here around 9 the latest especially if you're in a group and you want a corner table. The design of this bar is very romantic yet trendy as they have a fairy light ceiling in the back of the place  Nice bouncer,3,2,3
33,Natalie H.,"Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, NY",220,228,64,4.0,8/31/2017,"Perfect for happy hour, as long as you're not hungry! There isn't really any food here except for pickles, which are yummy but not that substantive. Luckily you're almost in the East Village and there are plentiful food options steps away.Loved everything else though- tons of beautiful plants at the entry way, fantastic throwback music (Come On Eileen and Beatle's Revolution in one night? Can't get better!), friendly bar tenders, and great drink specials - basically half off everything. They also have a bunch of pickleback shot variations, which are pretty delicious once you get over the weirdness of drinking brine.",1,1,

I've never had a pickleback shot before trying one at the Belfry and omg I'm hooked! Tried the classic with the sour brine, amazing. The pickle juice here is so smooth and delicious. Also tried the Bentley (packs a PUNCH, very spicy) and the Tickleblack (with mezcal instead of whiskey, also delicious). Who knew pickle juice was such a good chaser. We literally just took one after another and it was a great night.",3,,
36,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,6/15/2017,"My first attempt at checking out The Belfry was foiled when we walked in and found the place completely empty on a Sunday afternoon.  I had walked by the bar on several weeknights, however, and had always seen it completely packed, so we had decided that this was not the right time to visit.  But when my colleague was looking for a happy hour spot, I instantly thought that that would be the perfect opportunity.We arrived at the bar around 6 pm on the Thursday, and it was reasonably busy, but it did not get crowded until around 8 pm.  This gave us the perfect opportunity to enjoy their amazing daily happy hour, which lasted until 7 pm.  Specials during this time included $5 select local drafts, $5 house wines, and 50% off all bottles of wine!  While some of my coworkers decided to share a few bottles, I was lured away from the discount by the appeal of The Rearden cocktail.  This drink included all of my favorite ingredients - tequila, elderflower, lime, mint, and ginger beer.  It was light and refreshing with an added zing from the ginger and a smokiness from the tequila.  I simply loved it!   In addition, while there were no substantial food options, my colleague got a round of spicy pickles to share with the table.  The hot red pepper brine sure packed a kick, but the sour pickles themselves had that funky flavor often found in these salty snacks.  The 8 ounce helping was pretty small and more for 2 people than the 6 of us at the table.  Lastly, the seating arrangement was a bit tricky, as each table could only hold about 6-8 people.  We had had double that number and had to spread out among 2 tables.  Since each was table round and unable to be pushed together, we mainly had our backs to each other.  This was obviously not ideal for us, but would have been fine for a smaller group.  Also, while the server was very sweet, she was pretty swamped by servicing all of the tables on her own, which led to some longer wait times.Overall, though, the drinks, prices, and gothic décor at The Belfry offered us a fun celebration spot.",10,7,8

38,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10946,4.0,12/13/2016,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH. We get it, Yelp. They do picklebacks here for just $5. And they have a wide variety of picklebacks! So you can doctor them up and make them fancy or spicy! Woo. Picklepack and canned beer party. They also have a normal happy hour every day: 4-7pm $5 drafts/house wines & I believe mixed drinks. The beer I first picked kind of blew when I came a week ago and the only other beer was kicked (they had a only New York crafted beer happy hour/lame) and I had switched to wine. Still not a bad deal. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 3 is again, nice shots for $5. Also, my friend specifically wanted to come here for a pumpkin flavored old fashioned. It was listed in a yelp review and then we realized it wasn't on the seasonal menu and he almost cried because he promised his wife that had a bad week pumpkin old fashioneds. How did this night end up? They made them the pumpkin old fashioneds and it was effing delicious (sharing is caring) and they also burned fresh spices on fire on top of it (it was cool). Yay, Belfry! I also almost shot this down to 3 stars though because when I first arrived I asked one of the lady bartenders what the specials were: she listed the nyc draft beers, house wine, wells, and named a specialty cocktail. Near the end of the night I asked for the specialty cocktail (a cup of Amaretto, cream, and kahlua, with almonds and spices and things that were nice), a guy made it and then said it was about triple the price I was expecting him to tell me. Which would be great if this was a cup of like really nice bourbon but it was basically lightly alcohol infused cream. Regret in a cup. The decor is cute though. They have ice skates on the wall! Yay! And they do trivia on Tuesdays which people were saying is a lot of fun as we quickly exited the crowds for food.",3,2,4

I thought this was a flower store looking from outside. The entrance and exterior are decorated with plants. The interior looks neat and clean. Unless someone points a gun to my head and threatens me that I have to drink pickle juice, I wouldn't drink it. I hate the whole vinegar family - pickles, capers, olives etc. I didn't dare to try the pickleback but my friend did. His facial expressions were golden. I tried their pumpkin old fashioned. The pumpkin taste was weak. The service was great although I didn't stay for long. There were not many people at the time but I can imagine this place easily packed and busy on a Friday night.",,,

We went saturday night, the place was packed and we could only find place enough to stand around the side bar. They only have limited choices when it comes to food. Pickles and string beans were good, small portions. Overall the decor, music and people in that bar are fun! Highly recommend.",,,

It was nice to be able to chat with friends without having to yell over all the noice and music. The drinks were great, the bartenders were friendly, but what I want to applaud the Belfry on is their music. The r&b/slow jam vibe for a Sunday evening was perfect. The song selection was on point and to have it transition to a live r&b duo couldn't have gone any better. Bravo.",,,1
52,Bessie F.,"Randolph, MA",10,69,7,4.0,1/8/2018,Super chic ambience and sweet staff! Came here on a Saturday night with some friends and completely fell in love with the decor and feel of the place. Definitely a 20s-30s kind of cocktail bar. Their happy hour also offers sick deals - we got a bottle of prosecco half off which was neat. I also had the margarita on the menu and that was very good and pretty strong so definitely worth your money. 10/10 would recommend.,,,
53,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,256,201,5.0,1/4/2018,"A friend and I rang in the New Year here, and let me say, it was all done excellently. The drinks were all spot on (which, you never know with an open bar type event) and they had more than enough food circulating for everyone to eat. It was a great atmosphere to celebrate in- not a club, but not a super stuffy black tie deal either. The bartenders and staff were all just as happy and excited as all of the guests- there's nothing better than having a good time completely surrounded by others doing the same. I'll be back when I'm in the area again and need to meet a friend or two for a drink- their prices are also more reasonable than most other bars I've seen in Manhattan. Cheers to the New Year!",,,

I've been a handful of times, and I'm sure I'll be back for their $5 happy hour specials, though the later in the night it gets, the louder it becomes, so not ideal if you want to talk to your friend or date. A few nights a week they also host live music.",2,,
57,Shushu C.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,437,409,5.0,3/13/2017,The atmosphere at once impressed me because it was so cute. I felt a mixture of being an elf in the woods and at home in a little cottage. Immediately upon sitting down we were given water and menus. This would be a great date place (and apparently other people thought so as well bc there was PDA going on around us)....We ordered the hot toddy to share and it was decent....but what really stood out was the amazing service we received. We were celebrating a friend's birthday that day and we asked if we could eat the cake there. They didn't charge us any fees for us eating the cake and offered paper plates and forks....the waitress was completely cool about it. I don't think we would've minded paying but the service was definitely above and beyond what we were expecting. Next time I come back I am definitely getting the pickleback shots and I'm going to try all the pickles there..bc personally I love pickles. This place was made for me.,3,1,3
58,Ariana R.,"Washington, DC",114,100,104,4.0,5/27/2017,"It's like the secret garden inside. The exposed brick walls, candles in mason jars and greenery create a relaxing environment. I was there around 5 on a Friday, and there was plenty of space at the bar and throughout. Great happy hour specials on tap beer, and very friendly and attentive bartenders.Cocktails had cute names, and were decent though in the $13-14 range.$10 credit card minimum (only a real issue if you're stopping in for 1 drink during happy hour).",,,
59,Maia H.,"New York, NY",180,125,83,4.0,4/25/2017,"This rating is based on a weekday happy hour - NOT a weekend visit. On the weekend, the ""bouncers"" or whatever we want to call them are just too extra for me. The crowd is also very different on the weekends. The Belfry is super cute on the inside and a good place to host a small group of friends (not enough space for a big party!). The bartenders are very friendly and always have good suggestions. Can't remember the drink name, but I had a killer raspberry mojito-esque drink there.",,,
60,Alexander C.,"San Francisco, CA",102,164,192,5.0,3/3/2016,"This bar was great and didn't have much people when we stepped in (4pm on Saturday) but slowly got much much busier as time went on.  We got a cozy little table and checked out their menus which were in paper form and on some walls in the back.  We got several drinks (all of which were good) but the best was the peach mojito. I do not like peach but actually didn't mind the small flavor of it in this cocktail.  We were intrigued by the ""pickle back"" which we found out is a shot of liquor then a shot of pickle juice.  We got the regular with bourbon and my friend got one with mezcal which is similar to tequila.  Apart from suffering from my clumsiness and spilling some on myself it wasn't that bad.  Surprisingly good considering how sour I expected the pickle juice to be.  Our friend actually said she wanted a cup of the pickle juice it was so good (we were not drunk, first bar of the day).  Finally, the music selection they played was great.  Mainly hip hop, I know I heard Logic and Drake.  Would definitely come back, maybe during a happy hour.",2,2,2

The crowd is young and it will get crowded weekend nights but I would consider this bar again for a chill night with friends. The bar itself is beautifully decorated, with good lighting, not too bright and not too dark. The music was good and not too loud so I wasn't screaming my face off to ask ""how was your day"" which was great. As for the drinks, I got two cocktails, Winter Cider and my friends got beers. The beer selections were great. There was so much to choose from, plenty on draft. As for the cocktails, I found it to be underwhelming. The cocktails were served in small cups so for $13-$14, I felt I was overpaying for a drink. The taste itself was just okay as well. I got the Rob Ford which was lavender based and although smelled greatly like lavender, the taste came off a little bitter. I also got Smoke Signals and nothing memorable to it either. Overall, good atmosphere and the bartenders were great. Although super busy, they were very good at multi-tasking and trying to tackle as many orders as possible. I would just skip the cocktails and go for the beers or their infamous picklebacks.",3,1,1
63,Brianna E.,"New York, NY",627,84,160,4.0,5/25/2016,"Occasion: after work gathering with my sorority sisters. PRO TIPS: 1. It gets PACKED, space is limited so be prepared to talk close and move out of the way, often. 2. Wait time to order drinks is long, try to order 2 at once. 3. Tables are in the back but fill up FAST- get back there. 4. Live music happens at the front so beware if you are sitting at the front tables -- you will be IN the music. This place has a tone of a date bar- dimly lit, candles, woodsy, ferngully, like interior. Great seasonal cocktails and pleasant staff. My only drawback is the craziness that is after work drinks.... Sometimes you cannot move because of the limited space, but if you don't mind a tight squeeze you will love this place. ** the Cleanse drink is a great refreshing summer drink!",,,1

Definitely will be coming back here",,,

I was feeling in the holiday spirit and got the off White Russian, which had eggnog as one of its ingredients and it was awesome! Perfect taste to get you in the spirit. I also tried the Midwest mule (basically a Moscow mile with a blackberry touch of flavor). Both were really good.The decor on the inside towards the back is pretty cool with all the lights and large branches that make a sort of arch. Will definitely be back!",4,1,1

Not the best tasting chaser but it gets the job done as you can't taste the alcohol at all after.I also got the ""one that got away"" cocktail that was a gin, lavender and grapefruit mixture. It tastes like it was 95% gin with a splash of lavender and no grapefruit. It was also super packed in the narrow hallway along the bars with some slightly more space in the back with some tables / high tops.",,2,

They offer half priced bottles of wine, which you can't beat (especially when it's like 15 bucks a person). There were super quick with service and followed up to see if we needed anything else before we left. It did get busy so I'd suggest arriving sooner than later to fully enjoy their Happy Hour.",,,1
68,Laura F.,"Queens, NY",4,28,8,4.0,7/23/2017,"This is an awesome bar, we went on a Saturday at 7pm and it was fairly empty at this point. They take reservations and can seat up to 10 people comfortably at a table. It's definitely not a scene to stand up a drink/ dance but more chill to sit and drink. It does get a bit loud so you'll end up shouting to talk to people. By the end of the night all of the seats and tables were full but it wasn't packed or crowded in there which was great. Drinks were really good, especially their pickle back shots. Most of the drink prices can be found online on their website menu. Cocktails are $14, pickle back shots start at $7.For food they only serve pickles at $4 per jar. The pickles were really good, we had sour and spicy. If you get hungry, feel free to bring in a pizza! They seemed to be really cool about this which was awesome. The servers constantly came over to ask if we needed anything and always tapped up our water.The seating is a bit rough though. The chairs aren't cushioned so sitting there for a long period of time definitely had everyone's backs hurting.",1,,
69,Natasha D.,"Westville, NJ",61,70,1,3.0,3/8/2017,"I had looked this place up before heading into the area and thought it looked like a good time. My friend and I walked in and while it was crowded we were able to find some space at the bar. Seeing that they had pickle backs here, we ordered one spicy and one sour. The whiskey that they pour for the pickle back is better than previous places that I've gone. However, the pickle juice that they use is not as good as other places. I'm not sure what was different about it, but they were a little disappointing. The beer selection was pretty good.I liked the place, but with it being an alley bar and a Friday night, it quickly got too crowded for my taste and we moved on. I can see myself going back earlier in the evening or during the week.",,,
70,Alka M.,"New York, NY",555,139,43,2.0,7/30/2017,"I liked the vibe in here- pretty loud throwback music and younger crowd- but the service and drinks itself were bad. First, it took forever to get the bartenders attention. Not because he was busy, but because he was chatting with his buddys who were at the bar as customers about their recent girl conquests. As we was making my drinks, he continued to do so and the drink itself was lacking. I had the midwest mule and it was horrible, I took 5 sips and gave it to a friend. The ginger beer was literally poured out of a can of some low quality brand, and the drink itself tasted like soda. He made it in a rush, and it showed. Wouldn't return.",,2,

You are surrounded by plants and flowers and stringing lights. I love pickle back shots so naturally had to order them. 5 dollars for the spicey pickleback shot and 7 dollars for the sour pickleback shots. Both shots so smooth and delicious.on top of that service was great from the bouncer to the hostess to the waitress. Even customers were friendly! Would totally come back again.",2,,

73,Gina R.,"Providence, RI",1,12,0,5.0,7/20/2018,"Tried this place based on the cool vibe from the pics and the good reviews and it didn't disappoint. Loved the ambiance- candles, exposed brick, plants, loved it all. It was such a nice change from the typical bar. It would be a great date spot. Loved the bar tender as well, wish we got his name so we could give him credit. Super nice and great service. We stopped in shortly after they opened for happy hour. FYI they don't have much for food other than pickles but they are BYOF so you can bring in your own eats. Tried the classic pickle back with the sour brine and personally loved it. Hope to be back next time we're in NYC",,,
74,Ashley B.,"New York, NY",171,82,24,4.0,5/13/2017,"Great date bar in the east village with live jazz music after 8pm. No cover and they're known for their picklebacks. Keep in my mind, the spicy pickle juice has a CRAZY craaaaazy kick to it.. so if you're not into that, order yourself a regular pickleback (which is amazing). You can thank me later.Ambience is dark, filled with candle lights everywhere & cute decor that some of us mentioned looked super hog warts (in a good way). It did get super crowded at times so I recommend for a small group gathering (8-10 max), and expect some people to be standing. The bar was crowded but I didn't wait more than 5 minutes to order a drink from the 2 busy looking bartenders on a Thursday night.Would definitely recommend to check out if you're in the area!",2,,
75,Martha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,47,63,5.0,1/4/2018,"My roommate and I came here for New Year's Eve to their ticketed event. It was excellent! The tickets were pretty reasonably priced comparable to similar venues and areas, especially for open bar from 9pm - 1am. They didn't oversell the event and there was room to move around the whole night. The bartenders were friendly and made anything I could throw at them and the alcohol wasn't just the cheap stuff. The hors d'oeuvres they had were typical bar food, but good and there was always plenty of food going around. They had mini pigs in a blanket, pickles, crackers and pimento cheese, coconut shrimp and a nacho station. Getting in the door was the hardest part because they had to check the list then coat check was right inside the door so you had to wait for other people before you could get in, but that was a minor inconvenience that was more than made up for. They handed you a glass of champagne when you walked in and right before midnight they passed out hats and noise makers. It was an incredibly fun New Year's Eve! We also met and had great conversations with other people there.",,,

A tad on the loud side so if with friends having a conversation can take some patience. We stopped by for drinks on a night out and I was introduced to the pickle back, my friend's love them. The bar gets three stars because of the service. Our server was pushy and not just not very nice. She made the experience not so great, it could have been much better. So 3 stars, I'd go back to give it another shot. We will see.",,,

He apparently came here often, but it was my first time and I felt like it was hard to find. I passed it a good couple times before whipping out Google Maps and looking like a complete lost tourist.None the less, I found it and it was the cutest place. I have a thing for little fairy lights and dimly lit places. On top of that, they had candles and mason jars. Like, hello! Automatic points in my book. Sorry not sorry that I'm a complete girly girl. My date had a table right in the front by the window. At first it was loud because of the party next to us, but once they left, the noise level was perfect for conversation and it was a nice backdrop for a lovely night. It wasn't too crowded and the people who worked there were incredibly nice as well as attentive.The drinks were good. I will have to go back for their pickleback shots that they seems to be famous for. I went with a peach mojito (2 actually) and an abita purple haze, all of which were pleasant. The purple haze smelled a bit funny to me and I was a little unsure about how to feel about it at first, but I was looking for light and refreshing drinks that night and all of my choices did the job. The peach mojito was exceptionally good.Overall, I adore this bar. I loved the charm. It wasn't too crowded. The drinks were wonderful. The people were so warm and welcoming.

79,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,4/6/2017,"We came on a Tuesday for trivia and it's definitely one of the best in NYC. The questions are between medium-hard to hard, depending on what your level of random general knowledge is. The crowd enjoys clever team names, though there is no prize for the best one (let this be a vehement protest of that policy).After 10pm on trivia nights there's a $5 can+shot special that can't be missed. Above all else, though, they offer a well-equipped pickle(back) menu. Spicy, sour, briny, whatever you're into, they'll hook you up with something to eat or chase your shot with.Trivia starts at 8pm on Tuesday. I would recommend getting there by 7:30pm AT THE LATEST to guarantee yourself a seat. No one who got there after 7:45pm was sitting. The first category when we were there was ""Dictators"".

I don't blame the bartenders because it was PACKED, but the layout is pretty bad for how many people they allow the space.The decor is nice, but not nice enough for me to want to deal with that crowd or bar again.

Also the shot and a can is a great deal which we took advantage of. The menu is actually pretty extensive but we stook to shots and beer and ordered some spicy pickles.

This bar is one of the bars in NYC that offer Abita Purple Haze, which is MY favorite beer. You should give it a try if you like light and comes with a SLIGHTLY sweet aftertaste.  The only complaint is that it can get EXTREMELY loud where having a conversation is super hard.

You can bring your own food into this space. I went with my friends for happy hour and we brought in some pork buns, and instead of giving us the usual glare other establishments might give, our server commended us on our A+ food choice.Second, they sadly do not have $5 picklebacks because they changed their whiskey to Jameson. The classic pickleback is $7, and WOW it was a delicious experience! I wasn't expecting to like picklebacks in general, but man that was something else.The ambiance is gorgeous, too. SO East Village, in the best way possible. I believe they also have live music after 8:00pm, although I'm not too sure. Happy hour is from 5-7 on weekdays I believe.I recommend going just as happy hour is beginning. Our server told us that it starts getting busy around 6:30 or so. They take reservations.

88,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,5/10/2016,"I'm almost embarrassed to write this review, because I'm all about picklebacks yet failed to get one here. Shame on me. Seriously. I feel ashamed. And shame isn't a pleasant feeling, people. In any case, thankfully the Belfry has far more to offer than these oh-so-delightful specialty shots. Good cocktails, even better beer and fantastic ambiance--especially for this part of the ""East Village"".For some reason, I was expecting the Belfry to be incredibly rowdy. Saturday night, right off the L line, nice weather, etc. etc. Not that I knew anything about the Belfry prior to going--this assumption was based on exactly zero facts. I suppose I've just been to enough bars in this area that don't attract my favorite type of people. Call me a judgy mcjudgster, I don't really care. Everyone has their own crowd preference. That's why cliques exist. Anyway, I digress. My point: the Belfry is actually down to earth, boasts a gorgeous interior, and is full of friendly people. The bouncers on this particular night were also quite cheery, which is notable considering ""cheery"" is not an adjective I'd typically use to describe bouncer-dom. The Belfry is good for just about anything, though I wouldn't recommend it for a date. Too loud. Romantic encounters might need to be limited to mingling. Come here with a couple girlfriends and stand near the bar or come here with a larger party and snag one of many tables for a chill night out. I'd actually go with the latter if I got a do-over--the space for mingling is quite narrow and not really conducive to any sort of natural flow. But we made do. Given the good vibes,  no real potential for a subway-at-rush-hour-claustrophobia/rage altercation.You might be wondering why I have yet to cover the drinks. Remember that shame I mentioned? It's already hard to admit my pickleback failure once...and now I'm doing it again. I do love me some self-deprecating humor. Anyway. I had one beer and one cocktail during my visit. I'd say the cocktail menu as a whole is a bit above average but won't blow any mixology enthusiasts away. I had a whiskey-based specialty cocktail which could've been great, but the ratios were off. Way too sweet. Should've stuck with beer.And about that beer--fabulous selection on tap. Mostly domestic with a few international highlights (Belgium, Germany, the usual suspects). They also make a point to serve local beer, which I always appreciate, given that New York boasts a pretty impressive number of good breweries. It comes as no surprise, then, that I went with a super yummy SingleCut beer. You can't go wrong when you buy right. Wait...something tells me I stole that slogan. Oh well.",9,6,5

Starting at $5, you'd be surprised how tasty a shot of whiskey chased by a shot of pickle brine is - a combination that shouldn't work but somehow REALLY does! FYI - Happy Hour: $2 off drafts and wells; $5 shot 4-8pm from Tues thru Thurs and 4-6pm on Friday and Saturday",8,,4
91,Gabriela H.,"Charlotte, NC",143,167,15,5.0,10/9/2017,I was recommended this place by a native New Yorker.  The bartenders are all hospitable and make mean drinks. The atmosphere is chill with great music.,1,,
92,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,4.0,5/15/2015,"I've been to The Belfry somewhere between 8 and 27 times, on Thursday, Friday, Tuesday, and Saturday between the hours of 6:00 PM and 3:30 AM so I'd say I've covered just about the entire spectrum. Note to self: Maybe I should tell drunk Kelly to check in to bars circa 2:00 AM so I can achieve #duke status at this place.If you like pickle back shots this is the place for you. They also have $5 PBR and a shot. (I actually just gagged a little bit writing that because I am currently a bit hungover and think that that whiskey shot last night was a big contributor).On Thursday nights, they have a live jazz player and he is fabulous. Don't be cheap - please tip him. So I would give this place 5 stars BUT once I was coming from a soccer game and was in sneakers and was not allowed in. After pleading with the bouncer and informing him that I had just played in my ALL BOYS LEAGUE and SCORED A GOAL he still wouldn't budge. Okay I guess you have the right to have a dress code but I really just wanted to go in and get a pickleback shot and leave. Le sigh. There are also always at least 3 hinge dates going on at this place at any given time, and usually a grouper as well, making this an ideal spot for people watching.",1,6,
93,Ron D.,"Highlandtown, Baltimore, MD",0,34,21,5.0,10/8/2017,Exactly as advertised; easily the nicest craft beer pub near union square. The ambience space staff and beverages could not have been nicer - clean green beautiful and great music.,1,,
94,Jay W.,"Westville, NJ",178,833,47,3.0,8/25/2016,"Pickle backs are the thing here.  They were $5 each, with the option of spicy or sour pickle juice.  Pickle backs aren't really my thing, but I tried it here, due to solidarity with my pickle back lovin' partner in crime.  I thought the pickle juice was not as good as other places that I've had it (not as good as Bob and Barbara's in Philly).  I did appreciate that there was some spice to it, but not enough flavor.I liked the look of this place.  It got packed pretty quickly on a Friday night.  I like the look of the place, it looks like a dressed up alley.  Service was pretty good.A good place to stop in for a drink.",,,1
95,Sabaa S.,"New York, NY",303,9,0,5.0,9/11/2017,I love this bar! It's a great place to go with friends or for a date! Just has a super positive vibe and sometimes has live music! Such a cute place!,1,,
96,Jordan N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,2,5.0,9/6/2017,"This place is basically drinks only (with the exception of pickles, but you're not gonna fill up on that), so don't come hungry - that being said, the drinks are great and the happy hour prices are phenomenal! Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area and you're looking for a drink with great music and a great atmosphere. The only thing I'd say is it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it, as there's no sign outside. Still, it's overall a great place, and I already plan on returning again soon to introduce some new friends to the spot!",1,,
97,Paulette M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,16,8,5.0,5/18/2017,"Such a fun place to celebrate! The live music on Thursdays starts at 8pm and they know how to get a party started! When the live band stops, the tracks keep the party going.  The drinks were on point, flavor and alcohol! Sip that mezcal...smoked tequila slowly!!! So delish, but will creep on you!!! Thoughtful, Attentive hostess, Dara, did a great job with our large group of people. Big shout out to Nick, manager, and Rise for making our event such a fabulous memory!!!!",,,
98,Matt L.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,77,33,5.0,10/25/2016,"You have to go here!! What an amazing bar and experience. $5 picklebacks, friendly and attentive bartenders, and a sexy/beautiful ambiance.Pumpkin Old Fashioned ($14) - absolutely delicious. Made with pumpkin purée, maple syrup, and microplaned, flamed cinnamon...this cocktail was worth every penny.Pickleback Shots ($5-$9) - starting at only $5 (honestly), these are a steal. Various types of brine; including: sour, spicy, Bentley (think Bloody Mary), and more. We had several and loved them all.Pickle ""Snacks"" - they serve assorted pickles, string beans, okra, etc. in a delicious house brine (~$4/$5). Amazing.The staff is friendly, beautiful, and delivers excellent customer service. Even the owner (you'll see him behind the bar) is a total stud.The Belfry clearly takes fall very seriously, complete with pumpkins and tasteful, autumnal decor. If you are looking for a retreat in the city--and are somehow still reading this and not drinking--then you need to go here.",,,
99,Justin H.,"New York, NY",27,5,4,5.0,5/15/2017,"One of my favorite places to grab a drink. Downsides is that it can get crowded at times, but the music is always a pretty good mix, and the ambiance is dark but not creepy. They have string lights strung up all over the place which I think makes it look very unique. Highly recommend the spicy pickleback. Even if you don't like spicy foods, it goes down great and you'll love it.",,,

This was worse than the concoctions I came up with at frat parties back in college with plastic bottle booze. For almost $15 a cocktail, I expect a lot better. I told the bartender I didn't like it and if I could have something else, he took it behind the bar, threw out half and added soda. It still tasted awful! I will not be coming back here.",,2,

Their food menu is definitely for pickle lovers, which I'm not. They only have about 6-7 items on the menu, but no fries! I was craving fries and they didnt even have that. This is a good place to chill if you're  waiting for dinner reservations, such as Ippudo. Its nearby and quick enough to walk back when your table is ready!",,,
106,Anne K.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/21/2017,"I have been to this bar a handful of times. Normally the service is good, and as are the drinks. My friends and I decided to go to the bar on a Tuesday night during trivia night. When I first tried  to enter the bar, I was stopped at the entrance by a gentleman named Nick. I was stopped and was asked if I had a reservation. I immediately indicated I didn't, but that I had friends inside the bar (I will say mt MALE friends who had entered 15 minutes before me- weren't stopped. or questioned). I was informed that unless I had a reservation, myself nor my friends could stay at the bar. (note: It was 6:45pm when I got to the bar and trivia started at 8pm) After this brief/tense exchange with ""Nick"" I was able to enter the bar. Funnily enough, my friends already had a table (without a reservation) and we placed 2nd in trivia (after I was at the entrance that my friends and I wouldn't even be able to participate). To top off the end night, I was that the bar prizes for 2nd and 3rd places could NOT be applied to an already existing tab (we had a pretty expensive tab for 3 people at that point and bar prizes were NOT specified in the beginning of the game). We inquired if this could be applied to an already exiting tab (since half of us were already intoxicated, had work the next day, and weren't informed of prices before hand) or if we could utilize the prize at a later date. We were immediately told, no. (awesome policy, right? You wouldn't want to give a group of people a bar tab to return and revisit more patronage?) Okay, fine, we get it. We will move on with our lives.BUT since we were patrons of the bar, we wanted to double check with ""management."" Luckily for us, we were graced by ""Nick's"" presence. He was as charmless and accommodating as when I entered  the bar. He didn't apologize or anything. He told me ""it was all a misunderstanding."" There was no misunderstanding. I was told I couldn't participate in a game and told I wouldn't be seated or able to stay (neither of which were true.) I don't think i'll be returning to this bar and will recommend to my friends to do the same. The drinks and bartenders are good, but if that is the type of sexism and service I will be given, then I will spend my money elsewhere.",4,3,

I was sitting at the bar, alone, waiting for my friend, and ordered a drink, because my friend insisted he wanted to open the tab for me.. he was running late, and I communicated that to the bartender, and even then, the bartender kept barking at me.

I didn't make a big deal about it but really? So she proceeded to tell me that drinks were then free (as they should have been after a colossal f*ck up like that) but what she really meant was *1* free drink (which my friend ended up paying for). The manager was a total prick about it. This place is VERY POORLY RUN. What happened to the customer is always right, especially when an establishment gives away their debit card???

The line moves quickly though, there's constantly people coming and going. There's a lot of seating at the back once you pass the bar. If you get lucky, a table might leave and you can quickly grab one [even if it says reserved in it]. The bartender and servers are all really helpful and are always glad to recommend drinks!

The service was great, the bartender was friendly and took his time with all the customers, never felt rushed.There are 3 bathrooms there, and i think they are all unisex.A lot of food options in the area, and you can bring food back in the bar since they do not sell any.

Their long wooden bar with ample stool seating serves up a variety of cocktails, drafts and liquors. The vibe is slightly hip and bespoke without being pretentious or trendy. It's a bar that can equally work for a first date or happy hour with co-workers. The lighting's dim enough without being too intimate and the volume is just right to hold steady conversation. The Belfry is a refreshing option to have on your radar if you're looking for a chill meeting spot centrally located in the East Village.",,,

Its a fun ambience that can fit into both a group or date setting. Specials are inexpensive; the $5 Standard, a brine shot and a whisky shot, is one of my go-to's when I come here. They also have trivia night, at least they did on the Tuesday when I was there, starting at 8pm. The one downside is that the bar itself is very narrow, so once it gets packed, good look moving, but hey, welcome to New York.",,,

Mission accomplished--with an off-menu pickle back to top. Only downside is that it could get crowded so it makes going to the bathroom at the other end of the bar an even bigger challenge (than trying all the pickle backs).",1,,

The gauntlet of cheering is only fun for so long, and then folks get disappointed when you discontinue it. They subscribe to the ""let's place the urinal where anyone who walks in the bathroom will come face to face with another man's junk"" theory.I'm not good at math, but I think that comes out on the positive side.",15,9,8

127,Clare V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/9/2017,"The Belfry commits theft via illegal credit card charges. This is the first Yelp review I have written because I am so outraged at what happened.I bought two shots and two drinks, and after having left a cash tip and clearly indicating on the credit card receipt that I was not leaving a credit tip, lo and behold the next day I just happened to check my credit card statement and there was an extra 20% (EXACTLY 20%, not a round number, like they have a button on the register that facilitates this) added to my bill. I guess my bartender GEORGE decided he deserved more than I left. I immediately called the bar and demanded it be taken off, was told a manager would get back to me. None did. I called back twice and they did eventually take it off.This is illegal. I looked at other one star Yelp reviews for this place and saw that it is certainly not the first time George has added an extra credit card tip for himself. I don't know if the other bartenders do this as well, but I realized they certainly knew about it from my phone calls to the Belfry.

Okay so what you may NOT know is that they have different kinds of PBs. Regular, spicy, sweet, etc. It's fantastic and you haven't lived until you've tried them. this is one of my favorite jumping-off points for a night. Come here, down a few PBs, take in the lovely village ambiance, then split. Honestly I don't often spend more than an hour here. That being said, I have had their other drinks, which do not disappoint. It can get VERY crowded there though, so be warned if you go on a peak night. Service is usually pretty good though despite this, and despite me being a dude. PROTIP: Guys, have girls you're with order the drinks, it's way faster.

Would you like a mason jar of vinegar with a bumpy solid floating in the middle of it? Why, yes, thank you. NOT.The drink menu here is alright, but nothing exactly astounding. It took forever to get our drinks and the people who sat next to us got theirs earlier despite coming in way later than us. There's a reason why this place was practically empty on one the busiest nights in the city, during Pride. I would personally say it's because the faux lux interior and ambience of the place doesn't match what it serves. What kind of crowd are you trying to pull in, mate?

It was 95 degrees out, sue me. One of the things I enjoy the most about this place is the number of underage kids who try to get in, and the bouncers know IDs pretty well, and they turn away a good number of kids. Haha, what a fun time for those kids. God, I'm old. Anyways, my friends all hate picklebacks, but since they're fairly cheap here during happy hour, I always get them. They also do them pretty well here, with different options, so that's just the best place to start the night. Sometimes you just want that sour, crazy burning taste in your mouth to start off that buzz. They have some very good beers on draft, and their seasonal beers are always pretty well selected. My last visit, they had Southern Tier Pumking (delicious, but you can't drink too much of it because it's such a rich flavor), and I haven't seen a place in New York with Pumking on draft, so that was pretty impressive.Overall, with all the different drafts, reasonable pricing, and moderately active crowds, you more than likely to have a great time, whether you are starting the night here, or you stay the whole time.

141,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",4999,1213,6244,4.0,3/7/2016,"If you're a pickleback fan, stop reading this already and head over to the Belfry. As so many have been mentioned, the PB menu is solid and the base level of 'back (rail whiskey and pickle juice) will cost you just $5. While this isn't the greaaatest special per se, the fact that you can get it in a pretty nice venue with live Jazz on Sunday nights makes it a go-to stop when in the area. Seriously, this is a dive-y type special and the fact that you don't have to endure wet dive bar stank while slamming back cheap shots is a huge bonus. A bit bro-y on weekends, the crowd is still cool and as easy going as can be when $5 shots are on the menu, even when the place is packed. Again, PB fan? Do it... and get it spicy",14,9,10
142,Katy A.,"Manhattan, NY",2,4,0,2.0,8/25/2017,I've waited tables before so I try to be very conscious of service positions being blamed for things that aren't their fault. That being said: I've never been less disappointed in a bartender. My friend and I came here because we had previously been here for drinks. We got our cocktails and immediately hated them. We asked for new ones and got turned away and told if we wanted juice added to our drinks it would be $4 extra. We tried to talk to someone else and got turned away. Choking down $15 drinks I would have turned down at a frat party feels silly.,1,2,
143,Rosemary R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,57,0,5.0,9/24/2017,"Great cocktail bar, great beer bar and one of the very few with the hard to find picklebacks. I recommend the ""Classic"" pickleback.

144,Jane Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,58,136,4.0,10/25/2015,"This is the best place to start or end your night. PICKLEBACKS!! 5 dollars for a shot of their standard house bourbon and sour pickle brine. all night long. Pickleback lovers, you can not possibly go wrong with that. There are also other options for spicy picklebacks and different types of whiskeys on the menu. Plus the bartenders are also friendly.Weeknights here are super chill and laid back. The music, decor impart a very cozy vibe to relax and catch up with friends. This place insanely packed on weekend nights and the walkway around the bar is pretty narrow so people are literally squeezing and dancing their way back and forth. For a $5 special all night long in new york city, you shouldn't expect much else.",,,
145,Victoria L.,"New York, NY",148,142,218,5.0,2/19/2016,"I love the vibes at The Belfry. It's a cool, low-key bar. This a great place to grab drinks with friends but I wouldn't turn up here. The drinks are good and the prices are reasonable. The pickle backs are great and I appreciate their shot & can deal. They also have a good selection of beer and well drinks. I recommend the pumpkin beer (seasonal?) and whiskey sour. Would definitely recommend, but try avoiding peak hours if you want a table.",4,2,4
146,Charley K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",89,277,0,5.0,4/3/2016,"This is a fantastic place for drinks around Union Square! Let me list the perks: a solid happy hour until 8pm, live music most nights, decent amount of seating, and very sweet and attentive service. The interior is ornate, yet the vibe of the Belfry remains relaxed, and like others have said, low-key. I like that as one of their happy hour specials, you can get NY-area brews for $5 a pop. Do be warned that the credit card minimum is $20, so bring cash just in case.",2,,1
147,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",374,758,1,1.0,6/28/2016,"The interior and decor is beautiful. The people and drinks here suck ass. I imagine it's mostly NYU kids who make their way to this bar because the amount of shoving, pushing, and general assdrunkery here was absurd. I've never been stepped on so many times in a damn bar. Further, the drinks here were horrendous. Priced at a relatively steep $13, the only good one I had was the Cleanse, which honestly tasted no different from lemonade. The other two-- Peach Mojito and another cocktail I can't even remember were so bad. They both tasted like watered down lime juice. Can't say I'd ever come again unless it's very early in the evening, when the crowd is less ragey and hopefully when the bartenders have a better handle on how to make their signature house drinks. What a joke.",,2,1

We were just going to come here for a few drinks on a Saturday night but once we started with 2 rounds of pickle backs and found a table, we just stayed all night. It's a low key, laid back bar. There's enough tables to find a seat here. Seems busier earlier in the night.They have a spicy pickle back and we all preferred that one over the regular one. The spice really isn't bad. It's just a hint of spiciness. Basically, it's a chill place to get drunk for cheap!",1,,

This place is AMAZING, not to mention that it has the prettiest entrance on the block by far. Fairy lights.. Rustic sign.. Plants.. I'm in love! Also, they do happy hour from 4-8pm (a selection of $5 beers), as well as $5 picklebacks all night long. Their drink menu is huge and they offer a large selection of different drinks. Not into picklebacks? No problemo! Perhaps you'd fancy a cocktail, beer, or wine instead? Yep, they've got it! The boyfriend and I came here on a Monday evening while waiting for a dinner appointment, and we easily found a seat by the bar. Of course we HAD to try the picklebacks. It was only my second time having that in my life as I'm honestly not a fan of pickles. I was surprised that I actually really enjoyed it - the pickle juice went down really smoothly and it tasted gooood! If you're like me and you usually take your pickles out of your burgers and give them away to friends, I'd highly recommend that you give this a shot. I'm not guaranteeing it, but it might just change your opinion about pickles!Two things to take note of:1) Do not come here expecting to have a proper meal or bar snacks because they do not serve food (unless you're fine with eating jars of pickles, which they do have). 2) There is a $20 minimum if you want to use a credit card.Overall, I had an enjoyable experience here and will definitely be back. My only wish is for them to expand their food menu some day to include things other than pickles. Once that happens, I believe the experience will be complete. Highly recommended!",4,4,3

Found this cute bar on a quiet night, and the staff explained what a pickleback is: a delicious shot of Jameson and your choice of flavored pickle brine. While not the tastiest shot I've ever tried, the sour flavor takes the punch out of the sweet Jameson, and the combination is unique. For only $5, it's worth a try!The rest of the bar is stocked, and I'd definitely return to see what else they offer.",,,

If our pregame didn't quite cut it, a round or two of pickle backs saves us a lot of money at the next bar/club we run off to. This bar has a fun vibe too if you're planning on staying a while. It's a bit narrow, so it can get difficult to get to the back where there's a little more open space. The back has some seating too!",1,,

The inside of this place is dark and lidded with candles which brings in a sense of relaxation and relief after those stress weekdays of work!!Come here for happy hours!! My friends ordered the pickle back shots for me that comes along with a chaser that can be spicy or sour. I had the spicy one which in the end of the drink, it's get to your throat with a bit spiciness to it which is manageable! But be prepared for it or else you might choke due to the sourness of it as well!  It definitely something different form what I usually drink and taste so it was something new and interesting to me.

162,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,4.0,12/2/2012,"Can't believe there are not more reviews for The Belfry. We were here last night for a few drinks that turned into an evening of pickle backs!This is a terrific looking place. I think it is fairly new. You can see they put some good effort into the decor here. Long bar anchors the main room. There is a room with benches and tables in the back and a few up front. Dark and dimly lit with rich woods and brick walls. The hanging lighting fixtures are very ornate and gives off the impression you are in a castle. Plenty of candles too that add to the ambiance. It all gives off a very mature and cool vibe. Last night the place had quite a large crowd there. Mixed crowd too. Plenty of seating as we were still able to grab a seat at the bar. Seems like The Belfry is a hit as it was jumping. The music selection was great with old tunes from The Stones, David Bowie, Creedence Clearwater, and a mix of 50's thrown in. It was nice to hang out in a full bar that played good music and not horrible rap, hip hop, and pop non-stop. The staff we encountered, bartenders and waitress / hostess, were friendly and attentive. The crowd were also pretty nice and respectful, but energetic and having a fun time. Had no problem getting drinks and the bartenders catered to our requests. There is a solid craft beer list here with 20 on tap. Some tasty choices too. Full bar with a selection of liquors along with a small house cocktail list.The winner here was the Beer & Shot deal for $5. Can of Tecate and shot of whiskey. Oh yeah. This is on select nights - Tues 10pm til close and Thurs-Sat 8pm-11pm. The best were the pickle backs. Four different types to choose from. With Jamesons. Delicious! I saw plenty of them being made and drank all night. Yup, a few of those ended up in my belly!The Belfry is a solid joint.",5,1,2
163,Selena B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,8/19/2017,Screw this place. They are so pretentious. There is no name outside.

164,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",848,3176,11053,5.0,6/25/2013,"If you like picklebacks, then you MUST go to The Belfry. Their spicy pickle juice is delicious. The Standard pickleback is $5 (house bourbon) and the Classic is just $7 (with Jameson). They also do a can of beer and a shot for $6 from 6pm to 11. What a deal!Bartenders are attentive and waitresses are nice. Music selection is chill alt/indie-rock, and the bass is surprisingly booming in the bathroom.

Highly recommend coming here for one of those, especially if you've never tried one. While I admit they sound disgusting, they are actually surprisingly tasty and if you're not one for taking shots, you'll probably be surprised by how much smoother they go down with some pickle juice at the finish. I really enjoyed this spot overall and would definitely recommend it. They had a nice selection of cocktails and some good drink deals. The space is nice and I liked that you could actually move around and have a conversation.",4,2,3

It's clean, not too divey, and they give you a shot of (good) bourbon and a shot of pickle juice for $5. On top of that they played excellent CHUNES. It is a bit crowded but that was not a huge factor at play here. Would go back !",,,

It has that perfect vibe of good drinks without all the hustle of the other bars in the same area, it's really inviting.They specialize in pickle back shots, which isn't my thing, but they have a stunning array of options to choose from. They also have a great selection of unusual cocktails that can please any pallet, and if that doesn't suit your style the bartenders are knowledgeable enough to mix you up something unique just for you. The staff are all super friendly and the overall vibe really makes you want to hunker down and catch up with friends for awhile.They do not have a kitchen, however you can order take out from any of the local eateries and have it delivered.

This is either a destination, or one of many you'd likely visit along this stretch of 14th St.  I came here with a few others for some Happy Hour pickle-backs, which are not my thing, but hey, for $5, can you really go wrong?Drinks are served up in mason jars, which in itself is endearing, perhaps in Williamsburg.  The decor however is something I was keen on talking about, because it really is well thought out and lends it that character that I really love. It's warm, inviting, yet dark, and intimate all at once.Great music selection, which spans from the eclectic, to the 80s, all the way to all things current contribute to the vibe. However, it's the bartenders that make the place, and they do a great job of staying on top of providing a service to us patrons in the crazier hours.",3,2,2

Because we had over 5 people standing near the bar they considered us a ""party"" and we were not allowed at the bar before we stayed any longer.

180,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",877,406,479,5.0,8/10/2016,"Belfry , you won my heart.I loved anything pickled, and anything with alcohol, so when you have the best of both worlds with yummy pickleback shots, how could you complain?The vibe of this place is very southern and classy. I saw lots of large groups come together just to chat and chill. From dim lighting, mason jars, funky art and quotes, a huge long wooden bar, and sofas on both walls, you really could lounge here for a while. I think this place is good for an intimate date or to catch up with friends. The crowd here is generally mid 20's and older. Also it doesn't hurt that the bartenders were really cute  and they were so friendly. They danced and laughed with us, and served our shots quick. They were also really skilled, there really is a science to this, the perfect ratio of good bourbon and pickle juice. They are super generous on alcohol here, my jack and coke was STRONG, but thats how i like it ;]The booze itself is really good quality, and the shots are only 5 - 8 bucks at most, depending on whether or not you want it spicy. The menu also had a good priced selection on wine, fancy cocktails, and good whiskey selections, especially their house bourbon.Happy hour from 6-8 is also a big plus , especially on draft beers. Again I saw a great selection.Of course you can have some pickle jars with your pickle juice, or spicy cold cuts and various peppers to compliment your drink.I also enjoyed seeing their live band playing banjo, blue grass and country music, I even heard a yiddish song too lol.  There is also good seating right by them so you can see them upclose and personal.Oh and a clean bathroom is a major plus, that is rare to find at bars these days.Overall, come here when your happy, sad or looking to get drunk. You won't regret it.",7,2,4

183,Steph H.,"New York, NY",95,43,30,5.0,6/19/2016,The belfry is really an amazing spot nestled within union square. Known for its picklebacks (whiskey + pickle juice) the belfry also has some great cocktails. This spot has a long bar and it feels sort of like a gauntlet to go through if you wanted a table at the back. Generally 20-30 yr olds frequent and it can get really crowded. Sometime there is a wait outside to get in which is unfortunate. Pretty good service - picklebacks flow like water and the selection is great. My personal favorite is the spicy pickle juice with anything. They have their own house whiskey + pickle juice for $5 so you can buy a round for your friends and not hate your drunk self later. Solid place and great decor - I think of it as an urban secret garden. Just don't expect to have a lot of space and you'll be fighting to get the attention of the bartenders.,,,

Drinks were very weak, but not overpriced. The beer selection is blah blah blah blah. The band ""Frankadelics"" was obnoxiously loud, not very good, and aggressive about demanding tips. Here's why they get one star: my bill was $55. I left $10 as a tip in cash on the clipboard the bartender gave me to fill out the receipt. I just checked my bank account and for some reason, I have been charged $66. That is stealing. This is a fraudulent establishment.

I had heard of pickleback shots before, but was always turned off by the slightly unpleasant name. After a particularly stressful day, my boyfriend and I stopped by and encouraged by the price and various signs, we tried out the picklebacks. I learned that you take the pickle juice shot before the whiskey (who knew!) from the very nice bartender. Also had a great beer selection and a cool ambiance.

189,Timmy S.,"New York, NY",300,7,0,1.0,8/23/2015,"I've never written a review before on any website about anything. Came here for a Friday night happy hour. My friend was closing out her tab and signed the receipt. I felt bad that she wanted to pay for everything so I told her not to charge a tip on her card because I'd leave a cash tip. I attached the standard ($2-3 per drink/shot) to the signed receipt and handed it to the bartender. Now that I'm with her again and she's checking her tab, we both realized that she was way overcharged. The only reason I'm giving this spot a bad review is because I know for a FACT this is not an accident like I originally thought. This already happened once some time ago with one of my other friends who came over after the Belfey and also realized she was overcharged. She immediately called and they said they'd fix it, which they did. If you scroll down through other reviews, I'm not the only one with this same exact story so obviously they're making this a habit. This is also a nice bar. I know because I've lived across the street for over two years. The decor and overall ambience is great. Pickle backs are good. Drinks have a nice presentation (mason jars). My final words of wisdom is yea sure come to this place, it's nice. Just NEVER PAY WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD....unless u have no issue calling Belfry/your credit card company the next day.",2,1,

191,Ashley A.,"Vineland, NJ",94,31,13,5.0,8/25/2016,One of my favorite stops.   The ambience here is very unique.  They have a nice list of draft beers.  They have a blueberry beer that I just love.   My husband loves thier legendary pickle back shots.  Shot of whiskey then followed by a shot of pickle juice.  Last night they had a group playing music that sounded like it was from the 1920's.  Really cool.,2,,
192,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5159,3.0,12/18/2013,"The Belfry is almost synonymous with pickle backs in this neck of the woods and for good reason; they're cheap, delicious, and dy-no-mite!On a daily basis you can pop in and grab yourself a $5 respite from the long work day in the form of well whiskey accompanied by house made pickle juice. The secret's been out on this magical combination for some time, but The Belfry really does Bushwick Country Club justice (the bar that many agree invented the seemingly bizarre pairing).Other drinks are hit and miss. They were out of the mulled wine advertised on the wall and the hot apple cider was anything but hot. A nice flavor, but I was really jonesin' for a hot sip of booze after trekking many blocks in sub-freezing weather. I suppose there are bigger concerns in life, but hey - it is what it is.",10,2,8
193,Michael L.,"Tampa, FL",9,2,2,5.0,7/30/2014,Phenomenal place and the secret menu is unknown but the best. The creativity in the shots is unparalleled in New York.  It is true mixologist theory but applied to picklebacks and shots. First time I've heard of a triple back. George gave us a bacon cheeseburger shot chased by a special desert shot that was incredible Highly recommended.,1,,1
194,Joe L.,"South Orange, NJ",304,394,317,4.0,8/20/2015,"Stopped in here on a recent Sat night before a show at Irving Plaza for some pre-gaming.  I remember this space when it used to be the King's Head Tavern but didn't realize this is what/who took over.  I liked the layout and the vibe.  It's kind of long and narrow, a bit dark, but with some nice attention to detail and tasteful décor.  It was still on the early side when I came in, but I can see how this place could be a complete shit show.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but it felt like at any moment a pack full of bros and their sorority girlfriends were going to descend upon the place.  It was already pretty loud and I imagine it gets quite rowdy when they're closer to capacity.  The main reason for this assumption, and also part of the reason why I liked this place, is because they have a plethora of pickle backs on the menu.  As such, people are shooting whiskey left and right in here, so you can imagine what that can turn into.I cut bait and got out of there before it or I got too messy, but I enjoyed myself.  There are a number of reasonably priced shot/back combos and the ones I had were all really good.  I can't say I loved the attitude of the two bar keeps, but whatever.  If you need to muscle down some shots or knock back a couple beers while in the area, this is as good a watering hole as any to get it done at.  Color me pickled!",1,,1
195,Andy W.,"New York, NY",213,17,18,4.0,9/25/2015,"Favorite pickleback bar in the city. They have an outstanding mix of pickle backs to choose from, alongside their infamous $5 pickle back shot + beer.Vibe here is stellar - it's a dimly lit lounge feel with Top 50 music. Only word of caution is it gets packed on weekends and the drinks add up. But that just means you're out to have a good time.",1,,
196,Keli R.,"Milford, CT",310,328,16,4.0,12/1/2014,"Fantastic music.  Warm,cozy and intimate.  The five dollar pickle backs with brine from the pickle guys?  I mean seriously....seriously?Absolutely fantastic find and I'm so glad that I stumbled across it",,,
197,Tania M.,"New York, NY",207,25,3,5.0,9/29/2016,"I don't know where to start with this place, the first time I came here, the bartenders were so so sweet. They really make you feel at home here. They talk to you, introduce themselves and make sure you are enjoying yourself. The decor is also the cutest here, this is one of the reasons I keep coming back. (Aside from the AWESOME bartenders). This is a place where you can always feel welcome and relaxed, even on busy nights. The crowd really doesn't get that crazy and it's usually a good mix of people. The drink/cocktail/beer list is awesome!!! For fall cocktails their October style beers are so good. I've had most of the cocktails and the best one is probably the Midwest Mule. You'll never want to go anywhere else!",1,,
198,Ambrose C.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,570,1654,4.0,5/6/2014,"Whoever came up with the idea of drinking a shot glass with whiskey and drinking a shot glass filled with pickle brine afterwards must have been a really eccentric but witty man. This is a drinking idea that I never heard about until I came to this place on a Friday night, and it definitely became one of the most pleasant surprises I found in New York. It's definitely not the most disgusting thing to drink, and it's definitely better than drinking ""rectified alcohol"". Supposedly, this place is known for ""picklebacks"", which is pretty much drinking a shot glass filled with whiskey and using pickle brine as a chaser. Pickle brine is pretty much a liquid made from water, salt, and possibly vinegar that is used to ferment a cucumber. The fermentation turns the cucumber into a pickle and the liquid becomes pickle brine or pickle preserve. A chaser is a beverage you drink after drinking a shot glass of hard liquor to make the strong taste of hard liquor tolerable. The prices for these drinks are surprisingly very reasonable for a city like New York, at around $5 for a shot glass of Bourbon whiskey and a shot glass of pickle brine. This is called the ""Standard"". After the bitter aftertaste of the whiskey, drinking the pickle brine made this combination a surprisingly delicious drink. I also got the ""Big Game Jameson"", which is about $7, and has a shot glass of Jameson Irish whiskey, and a shot glass of spicy pickle brine. This one had a good flavor and definitely had more potent energy. After drinking these two drinks, I felt some slight intoxication. This place does not serve food, so this is a great place to go to after eating a good meal and you are really craving for some alcohol to make the evening crazier or even funner. It's a very casual environment, so it's not a very sophisticated bar, but it's also smoother than your typical ""dive bar"". Bartenders were fairly helpful and friendly. Overall, if you are looking for a bar in New York that serves some whiskey and you really want to drink some pickle juice after drinking your shot of whiskey, then this place is a pretty good choice. This bar was definitely one of the most pleasant surprises in New York I found so far, and I would not mind coming back here again for another drink.",1,1,
199,Gina F.,"New York, NY",26,260,252,3.0,11/22/2015,"Good place to go if you have a group and want to be near a train station. Manager was accommodating via email and our table was ready when we arrived (hour early, place empty). Drink menu looks enticing but most cocktails fell short and many were abandoned untouched on the table. Pickle backs , however were popular with our group. Several rounds of those lead to some rowdy behavior that the wait staff seemed to be able to handle. Appears that most of the clientele were groups. Not  a place I would go to to enjoy a cocktail. You can bring food in, Vanessa's dumpling next door was popular.",,,
