0,Derek S.,"Las Vegas, NV",972,89,152,5.0,11/11/2018,"A fantastic little spot that's great for locals and tourists alike!Regular seating is about a 15-20 minute wait, but I grabbed a seat at the end of the bar. Lots of options to choose from, but at the end I went with the Pastrami Hash with two eggs. Truth be told, not a huge hash fan, I find it really depends on the quality of ingredients and most places tend to skimp. That being said, I was greatly surprised when the plate came out with a healthy portion of pastrami hash. Which tasted amazing and was perfectly complemented by the eggs, polenta and english muffin. I will judge every hash going forward with this as my new standard. I want to go again, but I also want to keep trying new places.",,,
1,Johan R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,2,0,3.0,9/18/2018,"Service: 4  Food: 2.5 Price: 3.5 (1 low, 5 high)The exterior looks great. The interior was nice. Mostly a classic American diner menu. Been here twice for Dinner*Second time here the service was alot better, one of the best I've recieved. Seated quickly and the waiter was outstanding. The food however wasn't as great...-The Pollo Cubano's chicken presentation and flavor resembles an average homecook's plate. I ordered it because it looked like it didn't fit in with this american classic menu, and it doesn't. The golden-yellow colored, Spaniard, saffron rice; which was the saving grace of the dish that added a balanced flavor to the chicken, was hiding underneath the pale chicken breast (no dark meat, punny.) and barely sweated onions.+The Perfect Plate salad entrée looks more like a platter because all of the ingredients are seperated, although good on their own. [It's also enough for two, and if you mix it all up it's even better imo.] -However, this time they gave us a bruised, over seasoned advocado, and not-so-fresh quinoa that I didn't appreciate.+The Watermelon Cooler alone is worth the trip there.",,,

It was because they... treated me like a ""human being""... I don't ever wanna go back because I'm not used to that. it made me cry... especially because... being under the ""trans-umbrella"" makes most treat us all like we're monsters. and it's difficult for me for change to good... but thank you.

Only thing is, the meal can easily get expensive, with of their items being a little overpriced. Sadly, the fries, while extremely hot and fresh, could have been cooked a little longer. It may just be their style of french fry, but I like mine extra crispy! Lastly, the BBQ sauce was outstanding, shockingly good for a diner. I'm guessing it was made in house.Overall, deff a place I would go back to, especially if I was in the mood for a good veggie burger!",2,,

11,Loren F.,"Cincinnati, OH",112,24,31,4.0,10/25/2018,"I came here for a breakfast meeting with a mentor on a quick trip to NYC, and I was surprisingly impressed by Brooklyn Diner! Honestly, when I first looked it up, I thought it would be a cheesy tourist trap and nothing special. Yes, it was pretty crowded and the prices here steep because tourists likely frequent the diner, but the food was actually really good!! And our server was very attentive despite having a full restaurant of hungry diners. The space we sat in was pretty cramped--there were 4 or so two-top tables lined up against the back wall with booth seating on one side, and we had to move the tables around just to be able to sit down and get back up when we were done. A minor inconvenience, though. It's pretty close to Central Park and 5th Avenue, so if you're looking for a place to grab a bite on your first visit to NYC or to show someone else around then I would consider Brooklyn Diner as a good option!",2,,1

I was seated very quickly and the place was relatively busy but not too loud. The waiter came to take the order pretty quickly which was also good.The menu has some standard diner items and some fun meals that I wouldn't have expected. Thanksgiving day meal with turkey, cranberry sauce, and the fixings? Yes they have that! And the Matza ball soup. Another yes. Their bacon cheeseburger was pretty good as well. They have a lot of decent items for a decent price.After we put in our order it didn't take very long to come out which was another plus as I was starving and ready to eat. The food was hot and fresh. Definite recommend for a later night meal, at a reasonably good price.",2,,

It's overtaken by tourists and families, which adds to the overall buzz. Friend and I sat at the counter because there was no wait, whereas there was a 20-minute wait for a booth. Pastrami hash frittata - filling, delicious, had a lot of little pastrami pieces on top, and came with corn muffins. Smoked salmon benedict - I loved the smoked salmon, and the eggs were perfectly runny. Service was great. Coffees and waters were constantly refilled. Prices are around $20 per dish, which I don't think is worth these portions, but the quality being relatively good for the area makes up for it.",4,1,6

My son ordered pancakes and an OJ, it was 3 huge pancakes. Nothing special about them, no fruit, no sides with any of the dishes. But it was like $15-20 for plain ass pancakes. Ridiculous if you ask me! My daughter got the same. Neither of them liked the the pancakes. My husband ordered the sweet macaroni dish...it was weird. Not what I expected. Not good.

19,Joshua S.,"Jacksonville, FL",281,155,694,2.0,9/13/2017,"A good meal, but not worth the cash. Plus we ran into a hiccup on our only visit..The atmosphere was fun and busy. The diner was set up well and the displays were alluring. I loved the hanging cake displays and the plaques by each table where a famous or well-known person sat. We were hurriedly escorted to our table and our order was taken. I ordered the hash and Luke the chicken parm. I loved the fries since their seasoning was amazing. No sauces needed! I was satisfied but towards the end of our meal, Luke discovered plastic baked with his chicken.. The portion was massive so there's no telling how much of it he ate. I'm surprised we didn't see it since he did mention it was chewy... They manager was quick to explain why that may have occurred, was very apologetic and took the parm off our check. I was hoping to have breakfast here since advertised was breakfast all day, but they were so busy the lunch menu was only provided. I quite enjoyed my food, but our stomachs felt upset after we knew we had some plastic. Good, but I wouldn't want to go back since we'd have to carefully examine our food next time just for safety..",1,1,

The waiter was super nice and attentive. I wanted to get dessert but when I saw that a slice of cheesecake was over $11 I decided to skip it. Good for a quick bite but definitely a tourist trap.

The Brooklyn Diner was close by so we decided to try it. There was a bit of a wait where I read yelp reviews and quickly realized chicken pot pie was their specialty. I had woken up that morning with a sore throat (turns out it was the beginning of the flu ) and when I saw matzo ball soup I knew that was just the thing for my aching throat. My boyfriend went with the chicken pot pie. We were both very happy with our options and left with warm, full stomachs. It definitely has the feel of a bustling NYC diner like you would expect. Definitely would recommend!",2,,

Water wasn't refilled until glasses were empty and we had already gotten the check. Do not recommend. A thousand other options. I should have paid attention to the three star rating.",,,

27,Eric G.,"New York, NY",236,103,63,4.0,2/8/2018,Brooklyn Diner has been great for many years. But of course you should know they do not have a Diner menu or prices. It's a Diner in name and atmosphere only. I most recently went for brunch and enjoyed every bite of the smoked salmon scramble. It is served with delicious fried polenta and toast. The coffee was good & fresh and the service was fast and attentive. The Brooklyn Diner used to have one of the best desserts in NYC. It was their homemade Lemon Meringue Pie and to this day I have not had a slice of Lemon Meringue Pie that has compared. Please bring this dessert back!!! Please!!,,,

It was bustling with people coming in and going out; food being carried up and down the aisles. My husband and daughter shared a huge pot pie. I had a barbecue chicken sandwich, fries and a unique cole slaw that I wasn't crazy about. My sandwich was very tasty though. I tasted the pot pie. To me it looked better than it tasted but it was good. This place is a bit pricey, but hey, it's NYC so it's what you expect. Overall it was a cool spot with pretty good tasting food.

33,Don N.,"Pearl City, HI",133,219,515,3.0,3/31/2017,"Finished watching the play Waitress so we needed some diner food and pie. Went over to Brooklyn Diner hoping for a late dinner and some pie. Still pretty crowded after 10 pm, we got seats pretty quickly, looked at the menu, and saw PIE on the dessert side. Yes! (More on this later)Food: I ordered the Matza Ball and the. Arugula Salad (saving room for Pie), offspring ordered the Chicken Pot Pie. The food came quickly..the Chicken Pot Pie was enormous, Yelp Tip, enough for two people to share. I had some, she ate her fill, and it looked like we hardly made a dent. Then again at $24.25 the portions should be large. The soup was decent, salad was very tart. Food was okay, hot, and portions large. Okay..here's where I had to drop a star, the dessert side of the menu said in large letters ""Cakes, Pies & Cookies"". When we asked our waiter he said they don't serve pie here...um..its on your menu! Oh well,roll with it and ordered the Famous Red Velvet Cake. The Cake (like the other menu items) were of generous portions to say least. I found it okay but on the dry side. Red Velvet should be very moist, it tasted like it had been frozen.Service: Pretty good service, friendly, fast, and efficient. Atmosphere: Very large Diner style restaurant with lots of tables. Loud, bustling, what one would expect for a restaurant in Times Square. Value: Pricey but if you share then not bad. If two people share the entree which probably would be perfect then it cuts the price in half. Even the desserts are meant to be shared based on the size. Overall: Good service, okay food, crowded, a decent stop for a diner type meal in Time Square. If you are looking for fine dining, look somewhere else.  If you are looking for pie..look somewhere else too. If you want a decent if somewhat unspectacular but solid meal, you could do worse then Brooklyn Diner.",2,,3

We ended up ordering essentially a side of pancakes and a side of eggs together, and even though the pancakes side was supposed to be just plain pancakes, he asked the chef to accomodate my friend's request for blueberry pancakes because she was from Maine. It was very kind of him to help us out like this! More generally, I've been to this restaurant twice, and each time have been impressed with the ENORMOUS portions. I would consider it to be outrageously overpriced if it were not easily possible to split dishes - the chicken pot pie could feed me and two friends. The ingredients are all of good quality too. It is decidedly an upscale diner - not your average Waffle House - but if you know that going in and don't expect waffle house prices, you will likely be pleased.",1,,

The issue is if the diner is better or worse than other diners.It's a bit of a tourist trap, however, given the location, I wouldn't be surprised if a good percentage of their clientele are from out of town. It's also a little more expensive than the average diner. However, given that the size of the cheesecake slice, the price seems reasonable. I might go back.",,,

But, please, eat unhealthy.  Have the pastrami, a must have.  And the service is quick and attentive.In the end, this place is overpriced.  And Junior's, another nearby Brooklyn themed restaurant, has similar quality at more reasonable prices.   Your call.",,,

How do you have a diner and offer burgers and you don't do fried onions? Milkshake was another $10.

59,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,4.0,1/20/2017,"Let me start by saying, you have to get a milkshake! They are unbelievable! This is one of two restaurants in this mini chain (?) - with this one being my favourite; partially because it provided a reprieve from the 10F when I first moved to the city and was exploring Central Park but more importantly its more synonymous with a diner than the Times Square locationIt has what you would expect from a diner but more up market and the price reflects that. I'm normally a big fan of the Rubens but last time I went the menu was considerably smaller - I believe this is dependent on when you go rather than them cutting back - but I could be wrong. I have always found the food adequate for the price point but I would say it's a kind of every day spot - not that memorable in the context of NY. The milkshakes though - they are another level!",,,1
60,Nicholas C.,"Boston, MA",68,8,2,3.0,6/15/2017,"After crossing the threshold the Brooklyn Diner we were greeted by a manager who looked up our reservation. After being unable to find it she passive-aggressively told us that our reservation did not exist but she would seat us anyways. When I finally pulled the reservation I had on OpenTable to show her she insisted that it was the fault of the user for not sending in the reservation properly. My family ordered a variety of burgers and sandwiches. I myself had a Cheeseburger with Pastrami. The burger itself was delicious, manageable to hold and wasn't overfilled with ingredients. The Bun was toasted and fluffy and had a thick patty in the middle. However, when the waiter took our order we asked for medium-rare cooked patties that came out as medium-well for my brother and I. The fries were also good, crispy and had good seasoning. My sisters vanilla milkshake was also great. Not too thick and they also gave us the remaining shake that in another glass (which I'm glad cause that was one expensive shake!)Towards the end of our meal the manager made another appearance to tell us that she in fact found our reservation and walked away. Overall the food was good but the heavy price tag for a burger would make me wary of coming back.",1,1,1

He was so pleased with himself he dropped his pants and loudly declared to all who could hear that that was better than sex...a comment the veracity of which I was able to later confirm in a short (the operable word) and disappointing conversation with his wife. Which, by way of preamble, is to say that this unfortunate and overpriced place, is definitely not better than sex. And I'm not talking about the very best sex. In fact, any sex is better than this place. The very worst sex you have ever had is more desirable than this...even the self inflicted kind. There is just nothing good to say for one simple reason - when you look at the prices it distracts you from everything else. Nothing can be that good when a simple breakfast comes in at $25.To be fair, the service was expeditious. Dispensing with the usual civilities that make one feel human, there was a searing and practical focus on finding out what I wanted to order and getting it to my table as quickly as possible - accompanied by the check. This quaint little tactic sends the clear message to shut up, eat up, pay up and go away.

Honestly, I just wasn't impressed. Far too much effort spent trying to be something you're not. You're a Diner, the ubiquitous greasy-spoon. When I think Diner, I think corned beef hash, Patty melts, egg cream, and piping hot coffee. Polenta with breakfast? Come on now pal. I grew up in an Italian home, never once did we eat polenta with breakfast. The part that's truly the most off-putting with this, is the price. I mean, it's absurd. If your tourists are willing to get suckered into paying this much for a short-order breakfast; then god bless. But good god. $3.95 for a cup of joe? Get real pal.

Thought it was your typical diner but located in the middle of the city. Weird. It was fairly crowded so we waited for about 15 mins or so.  We checked out the menu while waiting online. When in doubt at a diner, i would go for breakfast, cant go wrong with some bacon & eggs. Then you start to look around at what other people order and what the waiters/waitresses are walking around with. One item that I kept seeing was this massive chicken pot pie. I thought i was seeing things but i wasnt. It was on their menu but its a limited item, so when its gone for the day, its gone. it comes with a hefty price though, $26, but it was one of those YOLO moment. I would probably never return to this diner, so i ordered it. It was delicious. Needless to say, it was ALL gone at the end.

The seating is extremely comfortable and I felt like I had stepped back in time with the great black and white photo's on the walls and the tiny plaques of past stars who dined at our booth. The location near Carnegie Hall is so homey, I really love it. My girlfriend had the salmon burger... it was amazing. I had the veggie burger and that too was wonderful. The portions are huge so go hungry.... For dessert we had to have the Brooklyn blackout cake and it did not disappoint... so moist and chocolaty. The check was to be as expected for Midtown West and rightfully so, this place is a gem!

Updated review","Ate at the BD this past Saturday (September 23, 2017), and I must say, Alex our server was one of the most professional servers / top notch servers that I have had at a restaurant IN YEARS. Alex was prompt but not to intrusive and certainly not pushy. The chow was on point. The wife had the Mac & Cheese with pastrami. Not to cheesy, but cheesy enough. I had the Ruben, and it was great. The knock out punch came with dessert, we had the coconut layer cake and the chocolate layer cake with ganache icing. To say the two cakes were better then my Granny's is a complete understatement. the cakes were freshly home baked in the diner, and were an all consuming emotional ride down memory lane when Granny would make coconut layer cake at Easter. Unfortunately, Granny went to the kitchen in the sky in 93 and I promise you the cakes at the Brooklyn Diner are a true representation of one of my fondest memories from my childhood. I can say that these two cakes were two of the best I have tasted in 30 years. I would also like to add that Nick (the manager) was incredibly personable, just a true pleasure to have had the opportunity to be in his company, and his diner. The end",1,,

Wasn't really how long I wanted to wait but he came and got us in 10 mins and we sat down.When I looked at the menu everything seemed pretty expensive. We did have kids with us but the waiter said they can make kid portions. The food came out in a good time. And our waiter definitely impressed me when he memorized all 6 of our meals without writing them down. I think that's so cool. Anyways when the food came out omg everything looked delicious and let me tell you it was!! We all pretty much shared every entree we ordered. Not one thing I didn't like.

The matzo balls tasted like matzo and were just hard enough. The cheesecake was great too but couldn't finish it.  The service was great.  The food was great.  Nick the manager came up to ask how everything was and said to ""take my time, no need to rush"" even though they were closing. I would definitely come back when I am in town.",1,,

Everyone in our group enjoyed a variety of dishes and we even took some baked goods back to the hotel that made a fantastic breakfast. Great service too!,,,

Updated review","There is a diner in  manhattan called ""BROOKLYN DINER"" I dropped in thinking i could finally get a decent burger. Burger was so so . bun was as hard as yesterdays bread , french fries were broken leftover fries from really bad potato's , crispy onion rings were soggy, and nothing was seasoned . the best thing on the plate was the pickle . So if you want to pay 23 dollars plus tax and tip ,,,,to enjoy a pickle drop in on BROOKLYN DINER.",,,
104,Edward R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,49,0,1.0,2/5/2018,"Went there for brunch on a Sunday.  The scrambled eggs had the consistency - and the taste - of rubber; the ""polenta"" was anything but; and the bacon had NO TASTE - which is remarkable for a cured meat.I'm not in NY very often, but next time I'm there, I will definitely avoid this place.",,,

Ive had better burgers and better hotdogs for 1/3 of the price. I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you were extremely hungry.",,,

This time around, I wasn't as impressed with the service as our waiter would have rather spent more time talking to his coworkers than actually working. We both ordered burgers and we were in heaven! The fries are good as well. Of course we got dessert too - a black and white milkshake for me and a plain cheesecake for my husband. Both were wonderful! Overall we were really pleased and we plan on returning the next time we are in New York!",1,,

After 3 waiters stared blankly at me I asked if I should seat myself. After finally being sat, I look around to see how small & tight this place is. The menu itself is sad, the options are minimal & extremely over priced however I was willing to try out the spot anyway. After an agonizing 10 minutes a waiter finally comes up, asks me if I'm ready to order, I told him I needed more time, as I wanted to add that I'd like water to start he shuffled off. This was the final straw for me & I left this establishment. Second worst visit to any restaurant. Will NEVER return.",,,

I had the Homemade chicken noodle soup with a side of their famous Noodle Kruegal. The soup noodles were light and paired well with the shredded chicken and accents of dill sprinkled in the broth. The Noodle Kreugal is essentially a bread pudding, but unique because it is made with noodles in place of bread. I couldn't ask for a better lunch after a morning at Central Park.

113,R H.,"Princeton, NJ",1,43,4,2.0,1/22/2018,"I stopped by here for a late lunch with 2 friends on a busy Saturday. We were able to be seated quickly. Things went downhill from there. This place is ridiculously expensive. Yelp's 2 dollar sign range is incorrect. It should be 3. I had a bowl of matza ball soup, which was delicious. But it was barely half full and only had 1 ball and they charged more than $13!!! I ordered a side of fries and it was $8. And perhaps the biggest rip off, my 1 glass of iced tea (which was never refilled) was just under $5!!!! Ok, I know this is NYC, but even there these prices are ridiculous. I will never eat here again and will be sure others know. I'll mention all the food we had was ok or good, though the plates were oily/greasy in places they shouldn't have been, so they didn't take care to wipe them. Service was not good, and it wasn't so busy because of the hour (3pm). The bathroom was gross. We were seated in a location where the freezing outside wind was blowing on us the entire time and the host seemed not to be making much of an effort to keep the door shut. All in all a bad experience. The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is because the soup was really delicious. I didn't even mind the price (exc the bowl wasn't nearly full) of the soup. Everything else, another story. Don't eat here.",,,

Walking to the Central Park Zoo, we wanted breakfast and were just going to stumble around until we saw something we might like. We had originally stopped to look at the menu across the street at another breakfast place and were about to walk in, until we turned around and saw the Brooklyn Diner, and both thought hmmmm that looks more interesting. Walking up to the Diner, we could see the place was jam packed, so we weren't sure how much of a wait we would have. The Host was amazing... throughout the entire visit, I saw multiple groups walk in who were being told they would have somewhat of a wait [maybe 20 mins max] but where some people turn and decide to go elsewhere, the host was so accommodating, offering menus and explaining a good spot to sit outside while they waited. I didn't see one group decide to go elsewhere, they all waited for their turn to come and be seated].Since we were only a party of 2, we were seated immediately. Our server came right over pouring us coffee; which never got less to less than half a cup without being refilled. The menu had many options; and while the descriptions may not give you the impression you're getting the price listed worth of food, let me tell you, for the most part you are!I had a bacon and cheese omelet which came with toast and polenta. The omelet was filled with bacon and the polenta was amazing! The portions are big, and not just what I ordered, but looking around I could see it was a common theme of the entrees. While the food was a little pricey for my liking, the food was excellent and the service great. A very classy place, while the patrons have a very casual attire, all servers are dressed in black, with suit vests and a tie... very classy look!Maybe not your breakfast place everyday, but definitely a place to come to!",1,,

Hubby had the regular cheeseburger, which was also done very well. He said "" you don't get cheeseburgers like this very often."" Quite a compliment as he enjoys burgers and travels the world for business. The fries were delicious too but my oh my as good as the burgers & fries were the coconut cream cake was amazing!

The noodle cake in heavy cream will eventually get eaten from the frig. Then it will be friggin good with that fudge. The parsley and sea salt fries were not too thin nor too fat. Goldilocks might have been comfortable enough to take a nap after biting through their crispy outside to the soft inside ...

She wanted onion rings with her order instead of fries, sorry we don't serve those; onion rings are a staple at all the diners in my neighborhood and at most. $5 for a 16 ounce soda and $11.95 for a chocolate shake called ""The Chocolatier"". Supposed to have hot fudge and chocolate chips that were more chocolate wafers that were filled midway of the glass. Felt more like eating a glass of chocolate cereal than a shake.

Got both here, but we did eat at 5:30 pm. The menu is traditional diner with fabulous accents-the cheeseburger was one of the best I've ever had with a brioche bun, good cheddar and perfectly cooked (and I think) good quality. And not TOO big. Fries where hot and perfect. Our waiter , Yaya? Was fast and really pleasant with a fantastic smile. Even the wine was a cut above. $12 a glass but worth every sip.

I saw this diner and had to take a chance on a final Reuben sandwich. It was taken back a bit to find this wasn't really a diner. Reuben sandwich were priced at $22. Ouch! Automatically assuming up scale can't do a good reuben. It has to be a dive restaurant. But took a chance anyway. And what??? It was the MOST delicious sandwich ever!! Seriously good.

Overall great service, good food, a little pricey.",1,1,1

They must have great pastrami because you could find a lot of it on the menu (pastrami Mac and cheese, pastrami spring rolls, and of course the pastrami sandwich).Tried the cheeseburger deluxe since it claimed to be the best. Don't believe everything you read people. It was a typical cheeseburger. Not bad but definitely not the best.Thankfully I also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. As soon as I told the bartender my order he mentioned it was a great choice since it was his favourite. Always a good sign, and I wasn't disappointed. Very flavourful meatballs, extra thick noodles and no need for parmasean cheese.I liked the old school diner style of this place. But what I liked best was the service. Very friendly easy going staff. As always I recommend sitting at the bar of any place. Shake, the bartender was such a pleasure to meet.Bonus: all tables in the bar area have access to outlets.

Not the case here. Truly mediocre at a high price, including $4.95 for a glass of  stale Coke. Not even anything remotely interestingly touristy about the place except for the prices. There was a reason why I passed by this place for years and never walked in. Go with your first impressions. Don't order the poached salmon, which comes with burnt (not caramelized) onions and peppers, and the tomato sauce is freshly made from the can, or the burger with guacamole made so well ahead of time that it tasted rancid and bitter. Fries were cold but at least not greasy.Very surprising because other restaurants under that ownership are good to excellent",1,,

Both came with deep fried polenta tots and cold toast.  I asked about home fries or some other potato dish but they don't serve it.  We both left most of the polenta and toast on our plates and ate maybe half of the boring omelette.  The only other item I ordered was a cup of coffee which was never refilled.  For this disappointing breakfast I paid almost $50!.  I considered it a waste of money.  We did, however, love the Downton Abbey exhibit.",,,

Still tasted good but what I wad looking for.  I will say it was huge.  Twice the size I thought it'd be and could've easily feed me and my husband.  My husband got the chicken parm and that was fantastic.  Super good and moist and it was huge as well.  The chicken breast was probably as big as my face haha overall it was fine but for the price I probably won't go back,,,

I had eaten at another restaurant the night before and had a meal (paella) that was less money than what they charge for their chili hot dog.  Yes--the chili hot dog is $24!.  The paella I had the night before was $23. The menu was also much more limited than I would expect from an actual diner. On the good side, the service was fairly good and the food was fairly good.  The people who work there were friendly.  But you can go someplace else for much better food in a much better atmosphere.  If all you want is a hamburger and fries or a chili hot dog, you can get ones just as good for much less money.  I will not be going there again because it is just not worth the price.",,,

Something about my huevos rancheros tasted weird/bad & im hoping I don't get sick. My boyfriends pancakes were fine, he just wasn't a fan of the fact that the peanut butter cups were left wholly intact & not broken up into smaller pieces throughout the pancake.

This location is on West 57th Street attached to the ground level of an office building, so there are always a lot of people having meetings there. There usually isn't too much of a wait and I am often seated right away, even if the person I am waiting for has not arrived.  The pace is pretty quick here as they know you need to get your food quickly, but then they slow down and let you eat and chat as long as you like.  I get all sorts of stuff from eggs to fruit to pancakes, etc. when I eat here.  Everything is very good, not amazing, but reliable.  The last thing you need is the person you are meeting to get an awful meal or have to wait forever for the food - it becomes distracting.    One of these days, I am going skip breakfast and just order a slice of one the massive cakes near the front door for breakfast.",1,,

Breakfast was awesome, gray taste and large portions -so much my husband and I thought next time we will share one main dish and perhaps get some oatmeal or yogurt with btw we saw them serve and they use very fresh fruits and again, large portions. I did not give the place 5 stars only because I really struggle paying over $45 for breakfast. In my opinion more than $50 is a bit pricey for two people only drinking coffee with their breakfast-no juice or milk which normally adds to your check. Other than that this place is a must!",,,
