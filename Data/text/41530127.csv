0,,7/1/2018,0,1,"Cherry Hill, NJ",Merle N.,0.0,5.0,15,"An American Treasure! This is the newest iteration of the East Village classic. The night I visited was everything you would want from an East Village dive bar night--strange people, juke box picks from Bowie to Van Halen to who-knows-what. And then we have a bartender who was merry and sultry and served up drinks with aplomb. She's a keeper!The barkeep and servers rocked on, even in the face off--or despite--having to tell, European party of drinkers after another, that, yes, it's not only customary to tip American barkeeps, but it's also the way said barkeeps actually get paid. It's always been this way in tourist-heavy NYC, but in the East Village, the memos take a while--or decades--that tipping bartenders, and tipping them well, is the ticket to a nice evening of merry-marking America style. At the International Bar, it turns out, it's an essential part of their mission to spread the gospel of tipping. I put down a fiver just to cover a couple of Italian fellas who feigned ignorance! It's just a small gesture to support this legendary spot.",
1,,11/7/2018,314,,"Manhattan, NY",Alain N.,28,1.0,72,"We came here for an end of the night drink walking through the neighborhood.  It's cozy and divey.  Only ordered beers about 7 dollars per Heinekens and asked for 3 waters along with the beer and the bartender flat out told me ""no water here.""  I honestly thought it was a joke because she said it so seriously and kept going on with the drink pouring.  It wasn't a great first impression and for the price point I think we can find a little bit better in this area.The interior is older and painted over as expected from a dive bar. I usually like it but I think I was just too put off by the staff to continue here so we left .After reading past reviews it looks like we were not the first to experience this.",
2,,11/19/2018,549,1,"Valhalla, NY",Shirley S.,138,3.0,132,"This review is probably inaccurate because most people wouldn't go to bars at 4 PM on a Saturday...but my BF and I needed a place to chill at before heading to dinner so we found this place. Dim grungy interior with lights laced along the wall like in Stranger Things, bathroom with no mirrors and heavy graffiti, and a dirty darts table in the back--it was interesting seeing the ingredients to a hot messy Saturday night at a bar without the crowd or the noise. The bartender is respectful and nice, no nonsense. We got the shot + beer for $8 and it is what it is. Your typical NY bar, always reliable, which I've come to appreciate after seeing the lack of such in other cities.",
3,11,3/11/2018,620,10,"Brooklyn, NY",Chuck C.,2371,4.0,332,"You a fan of dives? No? Stop reading now, as this is pretty much the dive to end all dives:*Bathroom is gross? Check *Beer is cheap? Check (drinking a 3$ Miller as we speak)*Jukebox full of old albums? You betcha Optional requirements*Unkempt back yard? Check *Old dudes talking about NYC's hayday? CHECK*Friendly as hell bartender? YepThis place is the epitome of dive bars that are increasingly hard to find , even in this part of town (RIP arrow bar). Come here for cheap drinks to start a Saturday, or end...well any day. Again though, only if you like a dive (if you don't, we can't be friends).",9
4,,8/15/2018,85,,"New York, NY",Francisca W.,1,5.0,2,"This place is as authentic as it gets.If you come to this bar you will experience one of NYC's most legendary neighborhoods, taking the local route. Order a drink, take a spin on the jukebox, and chill in the no-frills, divey atmosphere.Plenty bars on tap; two screens for when the game is on; jukebox spinning classics and obscurities.",
5,,2/25/2018,171,,"New York, NY",Carly L.,229,3.0,239,"The drinks are strong and cheap, I'll give it that. The place is definitely divey but it extends a bit in the back, so my friends and I were able to get seats in a little back room to ourselves. There are also seats outside. In the room that we were sitting in, you can play video games like Pac Man. The service wasn't the greatest. I definitely prefer the Clockwork Bar for dive bars, although this place has comparable prices.",
6,,1/26/2018,107,,"Brooklyn, NY",Rusty R.,28,5.0,279,"The international bar...A legendHard to replace the previous iterations on st marks and then 1 block over, but the spirit lives onStill, nothing but admiration for this place Frankly the new iteration is friendly and the bar more CozyA new classic What a wonderful placeMakes you want to curl up and enjoy a pint or two!",
7,,2/20/2018,59,,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",Aranza G.,0,1.0,1,The bartender is xenophobic. This sucks. I'm from Venezuela and didn't know it was obligatory to tip. Worst place ever.,4
8,,2/28/2018,2,,"Bloomington, IN",Rachel S.,0,1.0,2,The girl bartender is a complete bitch. I wouldn't dare ask for water because she will not give it to you. Once you close out your tab she will aggressively ask and wait til you give her a tip although she doesn't even deserve one.,3
9,,3/4/2018,20,,"New York, NY",Mike H.,0,2.0,213,"The female bartender who came on shift at 8pm on Saturday night was very unfriendly and borderline rude.  She never smiled and treated many patrons with a nasty attitude. It seems that several other yelpers have already complained about her. I love the atmosphere and jukebox of International Bar (formerly Coal Yard), but that Saturday night female bartender needs to go!",1
10,,8/19/2018,0,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Dan W.,0,5.0,4,"Dark and divey. Cheap drinks, friendly bartenders! Spacious backyard for the area with a colorful mural that reads EAST VILLAGE. One of the few bars in NYC that stills opens at 8am.",
11,,3/4/2018,0,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Miranda B.,2,1.0,9,"I have always liked this bar until my experience last night. My boyfriend asked the bartender if she could close my tab for me and then, from out of nowhere, she started calling out my boyfriend, shaming him in front of everyone asking why he wouldn't put down his card instead and pay for me. I was in shock--this was a completely unnecessary comment and downright rude. I didn't understand where this was coming from but the bartender seemed like she had had a couple of drinks. When my friends and I confronted her about her rude comments and behavior she simply said, ""I don't care, leave a bad Yelp review if you want."" The bouncer intervened and asked if there was any problem and we simply told him that the bartender was being rude. He had no response to that. My friend walked out angry, after confronting her about her behavior, and she was yelling at the bouncer to ""leave the door open, I want to throw this quarter at him!!"" Very bizarre, unexplainable behavior. I was just in shock about the whole situation and tried to be understanding but there is no excuse for behavior like that. I have worked in customer service and that is no way to treat a customer--especially when they weren't trying to provoke you in any way and if they were simply asking for the check. I was in shock and left her a 20% tip regardless, but immediately regretted it afterwards. My friends and I had a good night at the bar catching up but our experience was completely ruined by this bartender's extremely inappropriate behavior. I do not recommend this place, and I hope this very rude lady bartender will receive the full consequences of her ridiculously unprofessional actions.",
12,,3/14/2018,0,,"New York, NY",Joseph C.,1,1.0,17,"I have lived literally next door to the old International bar for 5 years now so naturally when they moved a block and a half more down on 1st ave I continued to be a patron. Ive always enjoyed coming here until last weekend. I went on Friday night (sat morning) around 2am on the 9th of March with three friends. Two of my friends went in ahead of me while my other friend an I lagged slightly behind. When we walked in we saw our two friends in the corner who waived us over and yelled ""pull up some chairs!"" My friend and I placed our hands on the backs on two barstools and the bartender, a brunette female and possibly irish, runs over and yells at us saying ""how about you effing ask me before you move my chairs or better yet how about you order some effing drinks"" my friend told her that we were going to order as soon as we sat down and then she said ""better yet why dont you get the eff out of my bar."" Then she asked my two other friends if they were with us C***s and then kicks them out too. One of them is actually a bartender in the East Village too! There is no other side to this story, we walked in and were all cursed at and thrown out within 60 seconds. I cant wait to watch this place go out of business just like the last one.",
