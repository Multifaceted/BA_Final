0,Charlene L.,"West Sayville, NY",250,64,603,5.0,7/21/2018,"This spot will impress!! Here's why!Great location, right in midtown easy to find from the E train. The service was excellent and attentive. The hostess was so polite. The waitstaff was knowledgable as well. All of his recommendations, including best temperature for each cut of meat, were spot on!We were pleasantly surprised by the pickles and peppers as a centerpiece. And the wine list was extensive. I ordered the rack of lamb. Each piece was butchered beautifully with the perfect lollipop cut. The strip steak was the most flavorful on the menu. It was an amazing cut, not too chewy, but well marbled. The creamed spinach was delicious, filled with garlic and fresh spinach. We enjoyed our special steak dinner even more since it was reasonably priced! We ate and drank like royalty for far less than expected. We will be back to enjoy more that Bob's has to offer.",4,2,5
1,John R.,"Warren, NJ",174,1219,345,4.0,8/8/2018,"I do not know how long this place has been here but I never knew about it. They seem to be famous for their ginormous carrot and the thing really is too big. Not that you would want to but it is entree size in itself...Anyway, had the caesar salad along with the rack of lamb with a baked potato. The lamb was perfectly prepared and the potato was a nice treat for me since I have not had one in quite some time. Overall, it was the salad that could have been better as the lettuce they used seemed to not be as good as other options I have seen.",4,,2
2,Melissa L.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",1,11,3,1.0,5/25/2018,"Great bar and drinks but the food is beyond subpar. Started with the shrimp appetizer. The fried shrimp were sitting on a piece lettuce soaked in oil; this creates a soggy mess. That said, they quickly corrected without much of an ask.Then my veal chop and baked potato is brought out. The veal chop I ordered medium rare has no pink and is as dry as cardboard. Also the baked potato accoutrements were almost empty and had clearly been out for hours. While management offered to fix the veal, 45 minutes later, I was still waiting for a veal chop and finally had to leave since by then it was 11:30pm.While the manager did not charge me for my shrimp appetizer, I would have gladly paid for it and simply wanted dinner that wasn't a disaster and took two hours to receive.I dine at Bob's in other locations on a very regular basis and love it. Bob's in NYC has impressively poor management and food. Do not recommend.",,,
3,Katherine D.,"St Simons Island, GA",0,12,0,4.0,10/22/2018,"We ate here for our 7th wedding anniversary. Steaks were great, service was great & atmosphere was relaxing. We were also pleased with the location since we were hotel guests at the adjoining Omni.",,,
4,Tish W.,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",69,10,5,4.0,10/13/2018,"The food here is great and expect big servings. It is attached to the Omni, which is convenient. They keep pickled peppers and pickles on the table, which is different. We had the shrimp cocktail to start, the shrimp are huge and tasty. I got the salmon for dinner and it was cooked just right. The only compliant I have is the prices.  They were a little on the high end expect to play 60 plus per person.",,,
5,Ron R.,"Indianapolis, IN",74,431,232,4.0,10/15/2017,"Had a great experience here!  Came in with a work event and we had a pre fixed menu of salad, Filet and choice of dessert.The salad was a chopped salad that was pretty basic (it did have artichokes in it which made it stand out a bit)The main course was a 9oz Filet served with a massive carrot in a maple glaze and mashed potatoes.  Everything in his dish was great.  The steak cooked perfect, the carrot was not too tough and not too soft and cut with a knife.  The potatoes were creamy and served as a great balance to the steak which was cooked a perfect medium rare for me.The desserts were a choice between New York Cheesecake and Carrot Cake.  I opted for the carrot cake.  It was nothing special.  A decent carrot cake that you can mind most anywhere.  I also tried a bite of the cheesecake from one of my table mates and it was also just ok. All in all I think the event space was beautiful, and the food was good.",2,,
6,Daniel M.,"Royal Palm Beach, FL",171,52,123,4.0,2/12/2018,"My wife and I had dinner at Bob's while staying at the Omni Berkshire. The atmosphere is dark and cozy in true steakhouse tradition. I personally enjoyed the aged, framed, American flag in particular. I didn't get the backstory as to the significance or it's placement but thoroughly respected their decision to incorporate it into their decor. Service was extremely attentive. (Almost too attentive) but I'm not going to fault them for that. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and offered educated suggestions which I always appreciate. I started with several glasses of a lovely, full-bodied Cabernet, the shrimp cocktail and the Prime New York strip. My beautiful wife, a vegetarian, indulged in the fresh tomato mozzarella salad and several of their delicious sides. The creamed spinach being her favorite. (I didn't even get to try it!) While on the subject of sides, let it be known that most fine steakhouses force you to order accompaniments al la carte. Not at Bob's!  I was morally obligated toorder the skillet fried potatoes with sautéed onions and peppercorn gravy. With that as a complementary option, how could any God-fearing, red blooded American refuse with good conscience? If you are looking for a good, traditional, steakhouse in Midtown look no further than Bob's chophouse.",2,,
7,Calvin L.,"Sunset Park, NY",362,10,9,2.0,3/4/2018,"This was my first time eating at Bob's Steak & Chop House. My friend and I had breakfast here. I didnt know what to order. I'm a huge fan of Eggs Benedit, I notice they had it in their breakfast menu so thats what I ordered. My friend ordered french toast. French toast was fine, not too sweet, it was almost perfect. The problem I have with my Eggs Benedit is, I FELT LIKE I PAID $28 FOR 2 HARD BOIL EGGS. The egg was almost cooked completely. AND THE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE, IT WAS LITERALLY FOAM. After cutting the EggsBenedit in half, all the hollandaise sauce disappeared. Hollandaise sauce is the most important part of this dish!! The waiter gave us the check while we were still eating. And its ridiculous how they automatically add 18% gratitude to the check. But overall, nice workers, nice restaurant, and food was OK.",,,
8,Leann P.,"Crawfordsville, IN",137,250,468,5.0,4/2/2017,"We had a wonderful experience at Bob's Steak & Chop Shop! The food and the service was excellent. We were impressed by each course that came out. Also, our waiter was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed to have a great experience.The salad, though pricey, was large and could be shared. The steak had a wonderful sear on the outside and was cooled perfectly inside. The creme brûlée was one of the best I have ever had!The manager stopped by our table to check on us and give us his card in case we find ourselves in NYC again and looking for another exceptional meal at Bob's. If you can't tell, I recommend this restaurant 100%.",4,,1
9,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1132,1290,6797,5.0,3/12/2017,"A very nicely appointed Steakhouse that is adjacent to the Omni Berkshire Hotel where we stayed over the Christmas holiday.  I was a bit under the weather, wasn't really hungry, but felt we should get a little something to eat anyway.  This restaurant was most accommodating... instead of forcing me to get a full size Cobb Salad, they graciously created a 1/2 size portion because I wasn't very hungry.  That was very nice.  I got a nice cup of chamomile tea to go with it, and it was very good quality tea at that.  The Cobb salad, even the 1/2 portion, was still huge, but very tasty with all fresh ingredients.  I really enjoyed it for not being very hungry.  The hubby got a burger and fries, and while I didn't taste it, I could see it was real good quality.  He gobbled it up.A little bit of trivia on this restaurant..... years and years ago, it was owned by my best friend's parents and was called Morgen's.  I understand it changed hands many times since before becoming Bob's Steak & Chop House, and while her parents have since passed, it was a special kind of feeling to walk in there knowing it was their place for so many years.  While this restaurant is on the pricey side (what steakhouse isn't?), even from what we ate, it's worth every penny.  Maybe next trip, we'll try dinner here...... and maybe I'll come with a better appetite.",7,6,7
10,Wesley M.,"Stamford, CT",144,34,0,3.0,8/5/2018,"Stayed at the Omni and went for breakfast. This is typical of a mediocre hotel breakfast. Ordered French toast and a side of berries with coffee and juice...$65. French toast was lacklustre and night I say a tad too thick. Berries were sour. Coffee tasted like dirt, or specifically one of those crap pods restaurants use now. Juice was good. Service was attentive enough. Strange that they include gratuity in the bill automatically though I suppose that keeps the servers happy since most people would not want to tip on such a large breakfast bill for what is essentially a ihop breakfast. It may be just my own quark but I hate those generic and cheap looking Sysco plates they use here. When paying so much for a meal, it's nice to have better utensils to use but my coffee cup and saucer was a coffee cup and bread plate. The hotel may be 4 stars but this restaurant is not.",,,
11,Robin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,22,0,5.0,3/1/2018,"This steakhouse has great energy and ambience.It is decorated in a traditional dark wood, low lighting, yet everything on my table was lit perfectly for me to see.I was greeted when I walked in by the Host and given a nice table where i could view the room even though I was a single lady.  My waiter was prompt on introducing himself and asking what I wanted to drink.I had been to the bar a couple nights before, had the malbec and sample shrimp platter.  If you want lite fair, I highly recommend you stick to an appetizer or ask for a half salad.  The Two Shrimp Cocktail, Two Shrimp Remoulade and Two Fried Shrimp is a full plate for me.  It was delicious.Tonight, I had barely eaten all day to properly eat dinner here.I ordered a glass of malbec, MARYLAND-STYLE CRAB CAKE With Honey Mustard Sauce, RACK OF LAMB.The wine was delivered pronto.   On the table is a plate, fork and knife to dig into the jar of pickled cucumbers and red peppers.  While I was slicing and munching on one each, a round of crusted bread appeared with room temperature butter.  This was all delicious.  The plate and bread crumbs were neatly dissappeared and replaced with a new knife and my crab cake.  This is a nicely portioned crab cake, which you could share half with a friend and not feel slighted.  I, however, savored every bite. They are made with fresh crab, which places them in the ""sweet and succulent"" territory and NOT into ""fishy and please god, take that smell away from me"" land of canned crabmeat.  Add the compliment of honey mustand sauce and yum!This portion of the meal was cleared and again I received new silverware and knife.The rack of lamb was perfectly done at medium rare, flavorful and juicy.  It was tender and I could eat it right off the bone.As everyone else has mentioned, the main entree is accompanied by a choice of potato (I chose smashed) and a maple syrup glazed carrot.  These are to die for.I have over half my rack of lamb and half the potato and carrot to eat today.  I am looking forward to my leftover meal with glee.My waiter refilled my water glass without having to be asked.  I was offered dessert even after I asked for my meal to be boxed to go.   The manager came to my table, introduced himself and asked if I enjoyed my dinner and was the experience to my liking?You can eat at a lot of tasty steakhouses, SERVICE is priceless.  This restaurant is a gem, and fully understands what service is.  Thank you for a lovely dining experience, Enri.",3,,1

The pickled salad on the table was a nice teaser.  we enjoyed the steak, the service and the entire experience.  Bobs exudes the dimly lit, relaxing, city steakhouse air - the tinging of wine glasses, whispers of conversations.",,,
14,Latrice R.,"Richmond, VA",30,197,600,5.0,8/13/2017,"After walking 6 miles through the city. We settled back at Bob's. Lol. The ambience was nicely lit. Staff was attentive. What really made our experience was that the manager noticed that i was cold, and he adjusted the temperature for us. There was a group that was in there that was very rowdy and loud. But it didn't deter our experience at Bob's. Initially, you are served with bread. Bread was great especially if you're hungry. I ordered the jumbo shrimp scampi. Boy were those shrimp HUGE! I cut them up and it made a very nice meaty shrimp scampi. It's also has bacon in it for those that do not like pork. But it's just made it more flavorful. Hubby had the pork rib chop with the legendary carrot. All I can say is that I don't even like carrots. But it didn't taste like a carrot. It tasted like a very light sweet potato. That thing was great! The pork rib chop had a light crisp to it while it was also nice and juicy! That pork chop was sooo nice and tender. It also paired nicely with some type of fried apple purée. I saved the best for last. The jelly beans!!! These aren't any regular jelly beans! These are some gourmet jelly beans. Get some on the way out!",2,1,2
15,Frank F.,"Monmouth County, NJ",31,87,115,3.0,3/4/2018,With so many world renowned Steak Houses in NYC there is no point in going to this mediocre establishment.   Steak was ok but all the sides had weird unusual flavoring.  Even the French fries which should be straight forward where totally disappointing.  The wait staff although pleasant rushed us even though the place was half empty.  To degrade things further they kept pushing us to buy wine after we said where not drinking wine tonight and we had other alcohol drinks in front of us.  The disconnect was frustrating and distracting to our good time out.,,,

However, they had good service, and this is a comfortable place to dine with both a bar and dining area. Lots of people staying at the hotel were eating here.",7,1,6
18,Camille S.,"Arlington, VA",46,145,1495,5.0,12/5/2016,"Wow! I'm so incredibly impressed by this restaurant. Don't let the hotel location fool you, this restaurant is worth staying in your hotel for!Located at the Omni Hotel on 52nd st. You'll find this Texas Steakhouse, boasting prime cuts of steak, a giant carrot and your choice of potatoes.Typical steakhouse then right? Wrong. They're so much more! The wait staff is attentive, they have coat check, and the atmosphere is business casual. The decor is something you'd find in a classy old home, so really, you just stepped into time and are having dinner at your fancy estate.We started with glasses of delicious red wines (Simi, Stags Leap, Chianti)Then onto appetizers: the soup of the day, tomato soup, the mozzarella and tomato salad, and the smoked salmon plate. You just can't go wrong with that combo. I ate the soup until the last drop.We also ordered the 16oz Filet, 8oz Pork ""Rib"" chop and the 28oz Waygu Tomahawk special, complete with giant bone because what's a Tomahawk without it?Although each of those cuts comes with a giant carrot and a potato of your choice, we also opted for Brussels sprouts and creamed corn. Now, I've never liked cream corn, but this was fantabulous!You'd think we didn't leave room for dessert... but we ordered creme brûlée, key lime pie, and the chocolate sundae on top of a giant peanut butter brownieAccompanied by a selection of teas and expressos, it was the perfect capstone.I'd recommend this place for any upcoming work events, their private rooms are cozy and wifi enabled. It's the perfect spot for a business dinner too! I'll definitely be coming back!",3,,
19,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,569,74,3.0,5/29/2017,"It's located in the Omni Hotel, which I've never stayed at (you know dollar value is a thematic obsession on MC3, duh!). But sometimes when I'm in the area, I'll chill in the lobby to feel rich. Why pay millions of dollars for a palatial ""foyer"" in your apartment when you can just pop into any number of 4/5-star hotels in NYC, enjoy free air conditioning, and act like you own the place? The ""acquisitive instinct,"" that's what.Moving on to Bob's: it's OK, but just that. Absence of prime rib at a ""steak and chop"" house is glaring. The onion rings were great, though. Porterhouse was standard, and TBH, you could cook it yourself at home. Given the price point, I'd recommend doing just that. So far, Rocco's and Quality Meats are the places to beat on the steak front.",1,1,2

When you walk in you are greeted by a welcoming hostess and then you are lead into a fancy white table cloth steak house. This place is a very classy steak house, I would come business casual at the very least. Restaurant is very big and spacious, I felt excited coming here:Steak Sandwich - Had a thick cut of steak in between the bread, came with a choice of either skillet potatoes or French fries. Was not able to finish this, would recommend to finish this at the restaurant instead of bringing it home because the bread would get extremely hard later on.Shrimp Scampi - Pasta was Al Dente, very flavorful and  plenty to share between the 3 of us, would recommend.Prime Ribeye - ordered this baby medium rare, delicious, perfection. Steak had the perfect amount of sear and not over charred like most other steak houses. Steak was super juicy. It came with a large sweet carrot and ordered skillet potatoes.

The gave us bread which was also warm and soft in the center which was a nice surprise....hate getting cold, hard bread with hard butter.

We got back to the hotel and I tore into the room service menu because I NEEDED something... Or maybe just wanted something? Ha! I ended up asking for a side of chicken (that would typically be added to the top of a salad for $8) and the roasted Brussels sprouts ($14). Decent pricing sure, however... The delivery fee and gratuity, etc = $$$$$$ and my husband wanted a Diet Coke ($7)... So this wound up being a $50 bill! Ha! Was it worth the price tag though?!Eh.I actually REALLY have a BONE to pick with Bob's! I don't eat pork. Nope. So when I got the Brussels sprouts I was EXTREMELY disappointed that they were roasted with pancetta! NO WHERE ON THE MENU DID IT SAY THIS! No where! I guess I was stupid enough NOT TO ASK HOW THE SPROUTS WERE COOKED BUT WTF! What if I were VEGAN! I would have been PISSED (even more) that I spent $14 on a tiny bowl of murder! That being said, I was hungry enough that I picked all the pig bits out and drained the fat... As much as I could. Were they good?! Sure... If you're a pig sucking fiend, then you'd probably find these Brussels sprouts quite edible, but I actually felt GUILTY eating them- clearly I'm over it now... But still. That just really annoyed me. Oh and the chicken... Really just a source of protein so as to keep me full til my next meal, nothing special AT ALL. You can probably see by my photo that the chicken looks like it came from a food delivery service package. So not impressed by Bob and honestly, I regret ordering room service. REFUND PLEASE!

My partner had the ribeye. HUGE portion and cooked to perfection. Top it off they sang happy birthday and we both got free desserts and a drink as well.

It was not super chewy because I hate super chewy steak. 4. It was 28oz so it's huge and great for ""sharing is caring"" which I did. You get a huge piece of warm bread brought over & if you are a bread lover such as myself then it's a win/win situation while you wait on the grub.. The smashed potatoes are very good too but that glazed carrot... (Drools). Also, if you like mushrooms.. You must order them!!! The mushrooms  are the BOMB.Com. I also tried the lobster bisque soup which is the only thing that I would say was just Ok. Drinks: I had a mojito.. well ok, I had 2 mojitos because one isn't enough.

36,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",193,212,4275,4.0,12/27/2016,"Flavor:We had two beef items and lamb. I'll focus on the beef here and discuss the lamb later.The 22oz cote de boeuf rib eye was the better of the two steaks we had. It was cooked perfectly to medium rare, with a nice crust on the outside that was packed with good, simple seasoning.The 28oz porterhouse had a slightly different flavor profile to it that I wasn't really feeling. It was still really fucking good - don't get me wrong - but going back and forth with the rib eye created a stark and noticeable difference, and it just reinforced my love for rib eye.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available:There's a lot of variety here. Three different sized rib eyes, filets and strips, and a t-bone as well as a porterhouse. Excellent showing. All the cuts are wet-aged for 28 days, so the flavor is a bit different than the standard dry aged cuts at many NYC joints.Portion Size & Plating:Portions here run slightly small for the steaks in relation to the pricing. The cuts themselves are good sizes, though, and so are teh other items like sides and apps.Price:The prices are a bit high for the sizes, with a 22oz ""cote de boeuf"" being $62 and prime porterhouse being $75. Luckily the quality is on point.Bar:The bar is great. It's a big rectangle with a bunch of high top tables situated along the windows that look out onto 52nd Street. Definitely a spot you can hang at for a bit. They also mix a good martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. Hendricks is $16, which is very fair in my opinion.Specials and Other Meats:This joint has a solid variety of other non-beef meats. They offer lamb, duck, pork, and veal (the other white beef). Fuck chicken. We tried both the lamb and the duck, and both really stood out as exemplary menu items that are totally worth trying. These would even be great as appetizers to share with the table.Apps, Sides & Desserts:We tried a lot of shit, and if I go deep into each with descriptions, this will be a long fucking review. So let me just rattle them off and highlight a little here and there.Bacon: (thick cut slabs of Neuskes - outstanding): Crab cake (great honey mustard sauce): Potatoes (these were incredible - you can see them on the bottom right side of the steak here, sliced like thick potato chips, baked to a crisp, and covered with cheese sauce and onions): Onion rings (amazing stack and perfectly cooked): Mushrooms: Roasted Brussels (because you need a little green sometimes): Creamed Corn: I didn't get a pic but it was excellent. Creamed Spinach: Fried Calamari (great crispy batter): Smoked Salmon (the prosciutto of the fish genre - excellent): Baked Potato & Carrot: See pics of the composed dishes above. The thick, long, and obviously phallic carrot is prominently placed on each plate, it seems, like the raging boner that hides within Donald Trump's pants. You can just imagine the jokes that went around the table with that. Carrot Cake (very moist and tasty): Creme Brûlée (perfect execution): Key Lime Pie: Bread Pudding: Chocolate Brownie Cake:Seafood Selection:There's salmon, shrimp (scampi or fried jumbos), crab cakes (entree portion), lobster tails and fresh fish of the day available. Not a whole lot, but it certainly will get the job done for the assholes who aren't ordering meat. In fact, we ordered the shrimp scampi with black pepper pasta, and it was fantastic. I kept going back in for more and more, bite after bite.Service:Impeccable. Everyone here is amazing and attentive. They know their menu well, and make excellent suggestions. Worth mentioning here is the amazing jar of pickles and peppers that comes out to every table. Careful or you might fill up on this instead of steak! The table bread was warm and flakey, like a large dinner roll.Ambiance:I like the large, open feel to this place. Finally, you can stretch out in Manhattan and not hit the back of someone's head. Also the decor is beautiful with warm grey paneled walls and beautiful table settings.",3,,2
37,Grant L.,"Roslyn, NY",1,40,19,5.0,3/25/2017,Went to Bobs last night with a group of 4 friends.  We all thought the food and service were outstanding.  We had gone to Bobs in Austin in July for my Bachlpr party so we wanted to try the NYC location.  It was better than Austin.  The GM Jolie came over throughout our meal to check on us and she was fantastic.  Food 5 starsOrdered wedge salad and chopped house both great and came put exactly how we wantedEntrees 2 bone in rib eye fantastic and cooked perfectly Lamb chops were unreal!Boneless rib eye friend said it was awesomeWaiter brought us Bacon on the house which was very nice and delicious!Desert we had peanut butter brownie Sunday was soooo good and huge enough for 6We had 2 bottles of a blend red wine.  Great choices.  Bread and pickles they give you to start were awesomeBravo!!!  Will be back soon,,,
38,Matthew C.,"New York, NY",7,8,8,5.0,8/18/2017,"As this is a Texas style eatery, it had the biggest carrot I have ever seen.  It's a little on the sweet side as I believe it's marinated in apple sauce.  This made it the best tasting carrot I've ever had.  We had the lamb chops and ribeye.  Both cooked medium.  Both were delicous.  The smashed potatoes were pretty good.  Also had the creamed spinach which was very good compared to other steakhouses.  This place will be revisited.",,,
39,Mary Beth B.,"O'Fallon, MO",0,3,2,5.0,9/23/2017,Excellent food and even better service. Alfredo is the best server with such an attention to detail and genuine personality. I came here for my birthday and couldn't be more impressed. I sure hope ownership appreciates their excellent staff!! The steaks are amazing. Quality of service is top notch. Wow. Impressed. Will for sure come back again. Highly recommend this place and make sure to ask for Alfredo!,,,
40,Mr. C.,"Leesburg, VA",1,12,0,2.0,12/26/2017,So. Very high priced and food is average. If I were to do it again my money would be better spent someplace else. The wait staff was borderline rude. The bartenders were great but that's where the greatness ended. Would not recommend.,,,
41,Dave E.,"Toronto, Canada",2,5,0,2.0,1/8/2017,"My new Fiancé and I recently traveled to New York from Chicago.  We love the Omni's brunch in Chicago, so we decided to try this one out Thursday morning after our engagement.  We were asked if we were patrons of the hotel.  When we said ""no"" we felt like we were shunned. (We were staying at the Intercontinental Barclays, down the street.)  We were seated, ordered and ate.  She had the eggs Benedict that was good.  I ordered the corned beef hash that tasted as if it was out of a can with a few runny eggs and some burnt toast.   The only service we receive after that was when I asked for a water and a refill on my coffee.  They were also very prompt on giving us our bill.  I could understand if it was breakfast rush, but there were only a few other tables.",,,
42,Kristen C.,"Las Vegas, NV",180,11,0,5.0,6/4/2017,Love this steakhouse! A Texas classic in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. My filet was expertly cooked and the smashed potatoes are amazing. Come hungry -- the warm bread they bring to each table is amazing. Drinks are strong.,,,
43,Gisele H.,"Orlando, FL",0,5,0,2.0,1/27/2017,"Was going to go to Del Frisco, Mastros, or Palm where the steak is excellent one every visit, but decided to try here as was staying at Omni and didn't feel like venturing out in the cold. Big mistake. First time steak came out cold, had to have been sitting for at least 10 minutes. Second time rare when ordered medium.  Potato was cold too and carrot not cooked enough. Steak and carrot had good flavor though. Just wish was cooked properly. Server kind of disappeared after cold steak came and never did check on me. Complained to another server steak was cold and her response was - what do you want me to do about it? (Maybe bring me a hot steak!) Did get someone to bring me the second steak. I will come back here. Great place for a glass of wine. Did eat at  one in Dallas and was excellent and did return to that place.",,,
44,Heather E.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,10,0,5.0,1/12/2018,"Bob's is awesome! Delicious cocktails, tender lamb and steak, bacon-enhanced brussels sprouts. Our waiter Mo provided exceptional service. Our party of six had a phenomenal time.",,,
45,Ron M.,"Darien, CT",121,9,1,5.0,5/26/2017,"Outstanding dining experience, centered around Bob's unique brand elements, including pickles in brine.  Service was top-notch and steaks seared to perfection.  I will encourage my friends and clients to dine here.  Really really good.",,,
46,Matt B.,"Staten Island, NY",3,38,9,4.0,11/20/2016,"Excellent. I have been to other Bobs locations around the country and so had a buddy of mine, so we were very excited when we heard one would be opening in New York. Went on a Saturday night with the wives. New York Bobs did not disappoint. The steaks and sides were well prepared and our waiter and the staff were very attentive to us. I had the bone in KC strip and my wife had the filet. Both were melt in your mouth delicious. Must mention two other things. If you like onion rings, get them here, and The peanut butter brownie sundae the 4 of us split was amazing. As for the carrot, can't even begin to describe the size of this thing. (See pic)On a side note, It was disappointingly uncrowded (I know that's not a word) for a Saturday night but I'm hoping that just because it's a new and inside a hotel and NY'ers aren't familiar with the brand yet. Please NY'ers get to Bobs, you will love it. Don't make us lose it.",,,
47,Dawn B.,"Eisenhower East, Alexandria, VA",3,3,0,5.0,4/30/2017,"My daughter and I recently were in NYC, staying at the Omni Berkshire for a girls birthday weekend and to see a play.  We are both steak fans so I made reservations at Bob's.  Kevin was our waiter, and was outstanding.  We had surf and turf and even the sides, a huge glazed carrot and garlic smashed potatoes, were out of this world.  Jolie was the restaurant manager and came over to see how everything was and my daughter told her phenomenal!  When Julie found out we were there for my daughters birthday, she sent us a piece of cheesecake with a candle.  So sweet!  It was literally the best meal I have ever had.  The service, food and drinks were excellent.  I would highly recommend trying this steakhouse, you will not be disappointed.",,,
48,Robert S.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",0,1,0,5.0,10/6/2017,Damil is a great bartender.  Super personable and funny.  Was refreshing after being in town and having rude bartenders at other establishments.  Good drinks too!,,,
49,Becca B.,"Fullerton, CA",261,46,6,5.0,12/18/2016,Service is impeccable. Food is OUTSTANDING! I hiiiiiighly recommend this place! The filet mignon is amazing!,,,
50,Tedgrrr P.,"New York, NY",71,109,0,1.0,5/3/2017,one of the worst steaks I have ever eaten - either the meat was spoiled; or it was microwaved. God I wish I had sent it back. Never had such a terrible steak.,,,
51,John V.,"Darien, CT",0,5,0,5.0,5/30/2017,"Very well executed NYC steakhouse (despite that they started in TX) with some interesting specialties.  Convenient location close to north end exit for GCT trains.  What set them apart for me was the extraordinary service.  From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and an easy going attitude that was like going to a good friend's house for dinner.  But few friends will cater to you as well as the staff at Bobs.  We will be back...",,,
52,Enxhi R.,"Staten Island, NY",0,3,0,5.0,11/28/2016,"Get ready to eat a lot of food!I went here with my girlfriend on a Friday night, and we absolutely loved it. I'm a very difficult man to impress, but this of course makes an exception. The location is very convenient, and there's lots of parking space available on any road near Bob's. The place is beautiful inside. It's very cosy and all around there is a comforting atmosphere that comes from the dim lights and the blue-gray colonial paint; you can immediately tell that this how an American steakhouse should look like.The greeting staff was very friendly. Enri (the restaurant manager), was extremely polite and patient with us since we came without a reservation and the place was packed. He took great care of us at the bar, and afterwards when we sat to eat, he visited us at the table another two times to ask if everything was well. As for the cooking, 5 star food and beyond 5 star service. The waiter we had was a 50-ish year old man from Sweden. A well-manered gentleman that clearly had passion for his profession. I've been to Benjamin steakhouse and to the Strip house as well, but I tell you folks, the care and treatment that we received from our waiter was way beyond the other to. It is very important to understand how well you are treated in Bob's Steak & Chop House. The service you get really elevates the food even more. Which brings me to the other section of this review, the tremendous cooking.Before the appetizers, the waiter brought a jar of homemade pickles, accompanied by a fantastic bakery bread (warm and soft on the inside, with a thin crust on the outside). After that we ordered the fried calamari and the tiger shrimps. I know seafood well since I come from a seaside country, and for sure both the calamari and shrimp were very fresh. The salads were very good too, but I suggest ordering 1 salad per person, since the portions are beyond large. I ordered the filet mignon, and my girlfriend ordered the ribeye. Both of course were prime and dry-aged. Best steak I've eaten in NYC. Period. Extremely fresh meat, medium-rare to perfection, and sear crusted on the outside. Both steaks come with a sweet juicy carrot and your choice of potatoes. All in all, excellent steak, excellent service, and excellent atmosphere.",,,1
53,Matthew H.,"Chicago, IL",13,8,0,5.0,1/5/2017,"Tremendous. This is located in the Omni hotel but this is not your typical hotel restaurant. The staff is warm, friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is everything you would expect from a Midtown steakhouse and the food is top notch. I will admit that I initially came to this restaurant because I was staying in this hotel. In the future I will stay at this hotel because of this restaurant!",,,
54,Mam M.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,22,0,4.0,1/4/2017,I was here on business.  Had dinner and ordered the rib eye steak.  Perfectly cooked medium.  The taste was phenomenal.  The service was excellent.  The waiter made sure all at the table had drinks and the food was brought at the same time.  I recommend this place and will definitely be going back.,,,
55,Darin F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,2,0,5.0,12/11/2016,"Absolutely amazing dinner experience. My girlfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better night. Both of our steaks were seasoned and cooked to perfection. Perfect amount of char on the outside for a great steakhouse taste and inside was juicy and tender making every bite mouth watering. The service was spectacular, weve never felt so appreciated or welcomed by a restaurant before. From our waiter to the management everyone came over to make sure everything was to our liking. They even tossed in a free piece of cheesecake seeing it was our first time in New York. Would absolutely recommend to anyone and look forward to making it a must stop next time were in town. Cant wait for a Bobs to open near us!",,,
56,Jerrilic H.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,0,5.0,12/27/2016,Last but the best meal in NYC！The environment of the restaurant is enjoyable. The steak is great and Karl is nice and gentle！Everyone here are sweet and kind. I really like Bob's!!,,,
57,RB W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,3.0,12/9/2016,"The people at this restaurant could not be nicer. Good bar scene and a classy addition to the neighborhood, The food needs work -- it is mediocre at best. I will keep going because of the location and the accommodating staff.",,,
58,S M.,"New Canaan, CT",0,171,0,3.0,12/5/2016,"This was my first visit to what is apparently a fairly large chain of steakhouses.  Located off the lobby of the Omni Berkshire Place, it is a warm, clubby room with a nice bar attached.  Our party of six found the food to be very good to excellent, depending on the selection. (Surprisingly, salads were a high point.  So was the ribeye.) So what keeps this from being a 4 star choice?  First, the service was more than a little sloppy, although super amiable.  Timing was off with long waits between courses and incorrect delivery of dishes.  Second, the wine list was ridiculously overpriced.  Our table included two oenophiles and they were pretty shocked.  Third, the overall value proposition (ambience, food quality, service and price all combined) seemed a little out of whack.  This is NYC where you have world famous stand-alone steakhouses like Sparks plus a branch of every major high end steakhouse chain in the country.  I think Bob's needs to step up its game a bit if they want to compete in this arena.  Finally, lose the carrot....",,,
