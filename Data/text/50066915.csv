0,Bethany M.,"San Francisco, CA",189,207,191,3.0,7/3/2018,"This is your basic Starbucks. Super convenient to where I live and love how I can use the Starbucks app to pre-order; it's always ready when I arrive. The employees are nice and there are seats that look outside so at least if you have to work, you get a little sunshine and people watching down. It's definitely an outdated Starbucks and definitely could use some exterior work to make it nicer but it gets the job done.",,,

Updated review","Hello when you're paying so much for your drink you want it full to the top..And the refrigerator wasn't working. They had no breakfast food out, Which wouldn't have been bad but it took so long for them to run to the back to get my yogurt with fruit and granola.And hello we all have to work!",1,,
2,Catherine M.,"Brier, WA",287,171,279,2.0,8/4/2018,Baristas here seem unhappy? I'm confused. Both times I came in for super simple orders both the girls I interacted with had alllll the attitude.

Don't really know why people are rating it so low.  I see pictures of a messy counter which is the customers not the staff... there are garbage cans to use!  This place is busy!  Coffee was correct every morning and would either order a pastry or breakfast sandwich.  All were good. They were nice.One girl does have the tendency to roll her eyes.  If she does it again I'll add her name,1,1,

Located in an area of San Francisco notorious for privileged white customers that live within the neighborhood, the employees do an amazing job. They handle the rude, crazy customers who live in the neighborhood as well as the overwhelming homeless population with pure elegance and class. This is the Starbucks to go to for delicious Frappys, smiles and hearts crafted with a straw wrapper.",,,

Just today I ordered a drink that was supposed to have whipped cream. There was none on my drink so I asked for it to be added. Instead of adding it on top he poured out half the drink and then added it.

Today, I ordered my normal drink and the cashier said that they did not have a powdered topping I asked for - ""we don't have that here.""  I asked if she was sure because every other Starbucks I go to has it.  She was irritated with me and nasty.  When I found the topping by the barista and showed it to the cashier and explained this is what I was asking for, she yelled at me and gave me attitude as if we were at a rival high school basketball game.  It was terrible customer service and just a poor interaction with a person in general.  Lame!",1,1,

20,Angela M.,"San Francisco, CA",96,62,35,4.0,10/9/2016,"Nice environment. Friendly staff. Nice set up. Located in Marina district. What I thought was cool is that the windows slide open so it appears to be outdoor seating. A guy came in and asked if he could open the windows and he did. That made the environment much nicer. I was a little disappointed at 1st because I thought they didn't have outdoor seating, but when he slid the front windows open it made it all better. Also they have seating in the back, but no windows. I don't like that, but I do like this area because there is a fireplace which may be nice on cold winter days. I will have to try it out when that time comes! The only thing I didn't care for was the floor was not that clean. They should probably sweep more. There are many small bakeries and coffee shops, but I do have to say Starbucks is still quite popular. Line was to the door, but the staff was efficient in taking orders.",1,,2

I asked him if I could pick up the drink another time as it was my mistake with the mis calculation and my Lyft was around the corner. Zach did not hesitate to begin working on my drink in between taking the next order. Truly appreciative of this today, as I needed this coffee before a major appointment. Thank you.",,,

After getting them warmed  I sat inside to enjoy the one of the sandwiches. As a normal human being I wanted to use the restroom after a while. The girl batista told me that the bathroom is closed. Just like that. This place is open till 9pm. And you close your bathroom by 7.30pm? How do you expect the customers to not use the bathroom when you provide seating to enjoy their coffee and food leisurely.  And if the shop is open till 9 pm , why is the bathroom closed so early? There were few people who were getting their work done. And you are selling coffee. (Which actually make people pee more). Very disappointed on how they treat their customers.",2,,

Updated review","This is about their customer service.  I was in a few days ago and ordered a tea and a protein box.  I only had a large bill to pay with, and no credit card.  The young woman behind the counter had exceptional customer service.  I didn't catch her name, but she had long blondish/brownish, maybe wavy hair-from what I can remember.  She asked if I had something smaller, and I said unfortunately I did not.  This is where any other coffee shop, or any other counter establishment, would turn me away and say ""there's a bank down the street that can make change for you."" This was not the situation.  The sweet girl then took me by surprise and said, ""ok, that's not a problem.  Today your purchase is on me, next time just remember that we can't take large bills since we don't carry much change in our registers."" I was actually speechless and asked if she was sure, and she just smiled and said ""yes, have a great day"". A little kindness will take you very far.  Thank you for being the reason why I will only shop at this Starbucks in the future.",,,

However this was a special weekend. It was the night of the Golden gate Bridges 75th anniversary celebration. Consequently there were a few tens of thousands of extra people in the area and everyone was hungry or thirsty. So while all the other places were closed, this starbucks had a line at least a half an hour long! None the less they were the only game in town.

It was hard to read her name, but it started with J and looked like Juliette. I inquired about the new types of beans that were advertised on the signs in the store. She was dumbfounded and unable to answer my basic question. 1. Which bean do you use if a customer doesn't specify? I ordered and paid. As I was getting ready to walk away, I observed her filling out a venti cup. I told her I ordered a grande. She informed me they were out of grande cups. How do you run out of cups? Next, I walked over and joined  the herd of people waiting for their beverages. Finally, I heard my order called out because they didn't have my name. When I picked up my cup it seems lighter than normal. I realize it was in a venti cup, but it didn't seem to have the quantity of a grande inside. In addition, it didn't taste like it had any vanilla in it. I left annoyed with my imperfect coffee because I didn't feel like dealing with the already annoying situation.",1,3,1

This area was quieter and more relaxing than the hustle and bustle in the front.  Also, in the walkway between the front and the back areas are the men's and women's restrooms, which you need the number combination from the barista for access.  The restrooms were large and clean.  Overall, a very nice Starbucks",3,,1

And we're not talking complicated drinks here: iced coffee black was the culprit today.The problem seems to be only one competent person behind the counter making drinks while at least one or two others clean(?) in slow motion. There's absolutely no supervision so I doubt the problem will get resolved. Last time I was here a woman got really upset with the complete standstill and asked to speak with the manager.

Updated review","Okay, here's the deal. My original review is three years old, and things have changed a lot since then. My star rating is 100% for the staff (because, let's face it...a grande chai is a grande chai no matter which Starbucks you choose). But the baristas at this location are so incredibly nice. I am a regular and someone often greets me by name and readies my order before I even reach the cash register. They are also the speediest of any Starbucks I go to. No matter how long the line, no one ever seems to wait very long. I am honestly bummed when I have to go to another location.Side note: the older gentleman I referenced in my original review who seems to be a point of contention for many reviewers is still there, and actually quite nice after you warm to him and vice versa.

The workers are super nice and made our orders very quickly (because I for one, was dehydrated). Came here after grabbing some sandwiches and was hoping for some seating to devour them. Walked through this short hallway that led to the back and there was a nice room with a glass ceiling that brought natural light in. And I live for natural light in calm places. We sat near the fireplace with comfy chairs and this made the best environment for me and my bestie to beast our sandwiches and sip on our drinks.I got the passion tea apple juice - it's not on the menu, but my bestie is total Starbuckshead and this was her usual so she got it for me. Definitely TRY. Ask them for the passion TEA instead of lemonade and ask for apple juice and SWEETENED as well. So delicious! Sadly I finished this in about 5 minutes.. I got the largest cup too :(Their bathrooms are super clean and they have wifi which is a plus if you need to grab a drink and work on something. It's near a bus stop and in a nice neighborhood.

The store has a nice selection of pasteries, snacks, lunch boxes etc. The front area is small but has some seating by the window. There is a back area with more seating if you feel like relaxing for a bit. There is also a bench outside in the front for people watching!The only negative side(and reason for the missing star) is an older employee who just needs an attitude check. I know there are a few other people that have reviewed this place and mentioned this employee. He was not only rude to me but to my friend as well on seperate occasions.

EACH TIME, I've watched them make my caramel macchiato wrong (the shots go on top guys...). They have at least 4 people working and it seems like it's just one.

It's funny and nice because they know what I like and will make be drinks based on what I say I'm in the mood for and how much caffeine I need. Francisco, Dillon, Chloe and Curtis are my favorites!

Doodle on cups, invent new coffee drinks, TRASH the corporate branding everywhere in sight!I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings, dear - I'm only telling you this because I love you.

106,Erika S.,"Denver, CO",39,20,0,2.0,11/26/2008,"This Starbucks couldn't be any closer to my house, so for that I'm indebted.  However, today was an experience was as close to discerning that a multi million dollar empire should ever come.First a foremost, I completely understand that new Holiday help is of the essence during a busy time like now.  However, before you suit-up an employee in uniform and put them to work at Starbucks, it seems essential (in my opinion) that they have some idea, (specifically in this case), what coffee tastes like and how it is ground.So, for those of you who don't know there is a new ""Holiday Blend"" in addition o the Christmas Blend Starbucks sells each Holiday season.  It seems to be the politically correct product for all those non-Christians wanting a holiday-like pound of coffee.  Great, all the more power to them.  I've had the Christmas blend and although I love spicy anything, I'm not a huge fan of my coffee tasting outrageously nutmeg or cinnamon flavored.  I asked the gentleman taking my order if he'd ever tried the Holiday blend, and if he knew what it tasted like.  His response to me was, ""It tastes like regular coffee.""My eyes darted to the left and my head tilted, was my question worded incorrectly?""Yes, but what does it taste like? Is it spicy, is it bold?"" I proceeded to inquire.""Um, I don't know."" He answered, as he turned to another employee to find the answer. Of course she also didn't know and had to ask yet another employee.  Finally the third employee answered, ""It tastes kind of like the Christmas blend, but not as bold.""I could see asking any more detailed questions would evoke in me a similar feeling to that if I attempted to spontaneously teach Egyptian Hieroglyphics, so I settled for the Holiday Blend and handed him my card.  Upon checkout, I asked if I could have that ground for a cone.  He placed the coffee in a bag for me and pushed in over the counter as if we were threw.  I again innately glanced left and politely stated that I needed it ground for a cone.  Though thoroughly baffled by my utterance, he repeated my request to a colleague and passed my coffee along.  After waiting nearly ten more minutes for another employee to grind what appeared to be nearly three pounds of coffee for the store, my litle orphin pound of coffee was finally ground.  Services...rendered.Now listen, I am one of those hard-to-piss-off patrons, and rarely ever feel better about writing or saying something negative about an establishment.  But in this case, I feel it just plain a matter of principle that when servicing customers, you as an employee should have or be given, some sort of formal training before beginning; a dress rehearsal before the show!I expect things to be much better the next time I go in, so consider this a warning! ;-)",,,
