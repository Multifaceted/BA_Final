The syrup accompanied the pancake well and honestly it was like having cake for breakfast. Came here for brunch with some friends and only have good things to say about this place. I believe it is also relatively new. The food was very tasty, the interior was well decorated and cozy, and we were seated pretty quickly even tho we had 6 people. Along with the pancake I also ordered the c madame which incorporates Katz deli's pastrami. Very tasty. Everyone else loved their food too! Will be back.. in a week :)",

It's like walking into a cute cottage or summer home in France. Windows opened to get the outside breeze, fresh plants, and unique decor. Service is good, food even better! The menu is a perfect array of brunch items from juevos rancheros to pancakes. Anyone can find what they like here without being too overwhelmed with options. Dish sizes are perfectly portioned to share or for a main dish. Dishes I recommend are the juevos ranchero (tad spicy) and riccota crostini toast. Delicious!! I would securely order the two orders of the ceostini for the table. Also got the pancakes. Stack of three perfectly fluffy cake like pancakes. Very cute yummy spot. Excited to go back and try more.",1

We had The Sheep & the peach- yummy ricotta on bread, and the Salmon Grain Bowl (my friend loved it but I thought it was just ok). Place was not too loud and good for conversation. Server could have been a bit more attentive by offering milk for our coffee or ketchup for our fries, but still had a lovely time.",
4,,8/8/2018,494,,"New York, NY",Elizabeth D.,110,4.0,47,"Love this place as far as atmosphere and location, and even food.Have come in twice and both times i was sat down quickly. I've ordered the heirloom and haloumi dish and also the ceviche.Both were delicious. The ceviche, although small, was honestly mind blowing as far as flavors.I've also gotten their blood orange mimosa which to me tasted just ok. I think it was pretty more than it was tasty. My biggest minus is the fact that they have few options for people with limiting diets (that's a lot of people in nyc!) such as gluten free or dairy free. Sure you can get a dish that has dairy or gluten and just ask for it without but then you lose a lot of the flavoring so it kinda defeats the purpose of going out to eat :(",

I will have to say I wish they had more options to their menu, but other than that, I liked it. I got their huevos tostadas and it hit the spot. I probably will get something different next time. If you are looking for a quaint spot, you should come here.",1

Service: Slow...took awhile to get a waiter to our table BUT all of our servers were super nice, offered to take our photo when we clearly were struggling with awkward selfie (groupie) pic. They also allowed us to push our reservation half an hour when we realized there was noFood: Everything was good, from presentation to quality of ingredients. We had the Heriloom and Haloumi plate, the Greens and Grains, and The LES Croque Madame. The highlight was definitely the Haloumi plate. Yum.Drinks: Nothing to extravagant on the cocktail list but my gf loved her spritz and their iced coffee is nitro cold brew, complete with stripey straw. Overall, Minnie's should not be overlooked for a start to a Sunday Funday in the LES or a quick brunch date.",

The atmosphere is cute and simple. It's a smaller restaurant, but the seats aren't crowded. We were sat right away and decided on the Pancakes and Huevos Rancheros. I'm surprised I've never seen Minnie's on any ""Best Pancakes NY"" list because their pancakes were phenomenal. If I could rate that alone, it would be 5 stars. The Huevos Rancheros was disappointing though; the ingredients were thrown together without any exciting flare or flavor. The service was fine and to the point. I'd come back for the pancakes.",

Updated review",245,,"Brooklyn, NY",Brennen D.,106,5.0,122,"Minnie's serves one of my favorite dishes of all time! I fell in love at first bite with their delicious lamb neck hash. I honesty picked it because it sounded very interesting, but I was blown away by the flavor and mix of textures!First off, my first impressions was that it was a cute place! My girl friend and I were just walking around the neighborhood and we liked how they designed their restaurant. It is nice and cozy inside. Staff was really friendly and we were greeted with a smile. When we took our seat, I noticed a mirror. One wall had this slanted mirror which was cool. It was convenient when I needed to fix my hair.I feel like street parking would be difficult to find here, and unfortunately they do not have a parking lot. There are train stations close by which is how we got there.All in all, definitely worth checking out. I'm definitely going to revisit and try some other dishes on their menu!",
11,,4/22/2018,264,,"San Francisco, CA",Paul H.,25,4.0,72,"Loved this brunch spot. Right down from Clinton St and the line there is crazy so decided to come here instead. More than satisfied! French toast was amazing. At first glance it may look small, but it'll fill you up especially if you get another item to share. We got the tostadas and those two items between the two of us was enough for us. Tip: go to the bar and eat, don't wait to sit unless it's a reasonable time. Unless you reallllyyy want to sit at a table.",1
12,,4/30/2018,14,,"Toronto, Canada",Joy H.,298,5.0,92,"Really cute place with nice staff!The decor had an artsy nautical hipster vibe and was very brightly lit with all the windows. The staff were all super friendly and make great recommendations.We ordered the banana buttermilk pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs. The pancakes were amazing and fluffy--the bananas were slightly caramelized and made each pancake bite taste divine. You can also choose to have the fruits on the side if you like, instead of cooked into the pancakes. The eggs were cooked to perfection and very lightly salted, which suited my tastes but not my friend's (who really enjoys salt)--you can always add more salt but you can't take salt away.Very beautiful place to have a meal and chat with good food!",
13,3,1/28/2018,184,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Jenny C.,372,3.0,310,"My friend and I stopped by here since the restaurant we originally wanted to brunch at had technically difficulties with conedison and the next closest one we ventured to had a 2 hour wait time (INSANE for how hungry I was so heck no). This had a wait time of 25-30 minutes which was fine by my friend and I so we decided to wait outside and chat until they called us to come inside. The environment was very casual, the music sort of loud but since we were seated close to each other, it was fine. If you have a bigger party and you wanted to hear the person from across the table, it might be a bit of a problem (or maybe my hearing just sucks). Once seated, we were given water and menus. Due to it being a Sunday, they were probably (guessing here) busier than usual so it took a bit of time before they came to check if we wanted any drinks and (maybe a bit longer than usual) for our food after we declined drinks. However, the actual food to table was a decent wait time which was great (since I was starving!). My friend ordered the pancakes with some chocolate chips added in (that's an additional $2; you can add bananas too) with a side order of a sunny side egg ($3 - which, for an egg, is kind of pricey but meh). I had the huevos rancheros with a side order of fries. My friend thought her pancakes proportion was larger than what she had expected (which led her to doggybag one pancake home) and she said it was like eating a dessert for brunch (which is NOT a bad thing AT all) and the sunny side egg was nothing out of the ordinary. My huevos rancheros, aesthetically, I think it could look better but the taste is what counts in my humble opinion. It had a bit of spiciness and that's really all that I can remember (which means, it wasn't superbly memorable to me). It was good though. The fries were okay, some got soggy at the bottom. Overall, I felt that Minnie's was okay. If I was around the area and the wait time for everywhere was about 2 hours, I would probably come back. But I do not think I will go out of my way to come back for another brunch experience.",3
14,1,3/30/2018,394,,"San Francisco, CA",Ayumi W.,325,4.0,175,"A cute little restaurant that's perfect to catch up with a friend in the middle of the week. Interior is well designed and the place is not too crowded.They have a small menu and I wish they had options for side veggies for the entree. We split the ricotta and pear toast and each got the 1/2 cooked salmon. I liked both, but don't expect this place to be the meal of your lifetime or something that will change your life entirely. It's a good spot for a sit down place that's not too fancy but still intimate enough for a nice dinner.",
15,,4/15/2018,154,,"Brooklyn, NY",Frances T.,64,5.0,125,"Five stars go to the lamb neck hash and the amazing service. The lamb neck hash was a pleasant surprise. At first, I looked at the restaurant and expected the only thing they would have served is avocado on toast. But don't ever judge a book by its cover. This dish was the best pairing of lamb, sunny side up fried eggs, and crispy hash. The lamb was extremely tender. I loved the combination of spreading it on the sourdough with the egg yolk. The ambiance of this restaurant was also super cute. Despite the all white and pristine look, they played some ratchet music which I liked. Overall it was a great experience. Something I def would come back for.",
16,,7/9/2018,730,,"New York, NY",Ryan R.,149,4.0,1659,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a weeknight. I made a reservation, but did not need it as there were several open tables when we arrived.After perusing the menu, we decided to split a few dishes:The sheep and the peach (3.5 stars): This appetizer was pretty good--though the peach was a bit understated in my opinion and I was hoping for a nice, juicy, refreshing peach.Lamb neck flatbread (3.5 stars): This appetizer was also decent--nothing that really blew me away, but tasty nonetheless.Burger (4 stars): Another good burger in the city--this one had pork belly on top and brisket that made it super juicy and flavorful--a good size as well.Salmon (4 stars): This dish was refreshingly light and fresh and was one of our favorites of the meal.Overall, this place serves up some decent food and has a nice vibe. It was not as crowded as you would expect for a place of this quality, but I felt that it may be due to being about $3-$5 more expensive per dish than it should be. Nonetheless, it's a nice spot in the neighborhood and perfect for a date or small gathering.",1

I enjoyed my experience here! Definitely recommendENVIRONMENT: the restaurant has a nice aesthetic. The restaurant was full but if didn't feel crowded at all. The waitresses are very friendly as well!FOOD: this place is not your traditional American brunch. The food options are unique but tasty. I ordered the John's burger and my friend got the Sheep and Peach. We both loved it, plus the good arrived within 15mins of order.",
18,2,8/31/2017,627,,"New York, NY",Brianna E.,160,5.0,84,"Wow! This place is stellar! Super inviting from the outside, sitting perfectly on the corner for great people watching. Upon walking inside, you can see the designers took their time and created a perfect ambiance. Windows line the wall and open for an amazing breeze for your meal. Candles light the room and give the perfect chill vibe for a date, family dinner, celebratory experience or drinks at the their gorgeous bar.The drink menus give an array of selections, but I chose the Lola -- and man was it nice! The perfect blend of freshness that still tastes like summer but could be a perfect crisp drink year round.The food selections are out of this world! As a table we shared the vegetable egg quinoa, which was MY FAVORITE, and I think every table in the place had a bowl on as well. We also had the octopus and I could've literally eaten 2 more servings of it because it was so delicious. My two friends split the burger and fries, I don't eat meat, but it looked fantastic-- the fries and sweet pickles were very good.Our waitress was so helpful with our menu questions and selections and very attentive. All in all it was a wonderful experience and I will be back to get the salmon :)",3
19,,10/5/2017,792,,"New York, NY",Liz S.,1568,3.0,706,"I came a few weeks ago for dinner with friends. I reserved a couple days out for a 7:30 Friday evening spot, which I would recommend doing. All of the seats were taken, though it didn't seem like too many people were waiting outside.The atmosphere feels very ""girls night out."" The crowd skews female and late twenties, and it's a pre-party vibe. Don't know that the decor works entirely-- the aggressive photo portrait on the wall seems out of place. The seating is cramped. Very dark, with candles.They have a relatively short cocktail list, but there were  a couple of tequila options. I went with one that ended up being a slightly fruity, slightly spicy margarita, and I was fine with it. Must have been $15 or close to it. My friend had a negroni and liked it.I started with The Sheep and The Peach ($15). This is the must-get dish and it lives up to it. The peaches are caramelized and warm, the ricotta is creamy, the arugula adds some tartness, and there's enough dressing to make the crusty bread work. It's a bit difficult to eat, but I enjoyed it. Portion is substantial and it would be a lovely way to start your day.Where Minnie's lost me was the Fluke Ceviche ($16). It came in a minuscule dish, like one for pocket change or rings. It was about three bites. The flavors were fine, but not outstanding. You can't go around charging this much for this little. Double the portion, at least, or drop it.One friend had the charred octopus, which I thought good but not great; octopus was cooked well but sides didn't mesh. Another had the lamb neck flatbread, which I liked.Service was on the slow side, especially to pay our check, though everyone we interacted with was fine.I'm not sure why this place rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it's that it doesn't seem to have a clear point of view-- Mediterranean-ish but also a burger and a half chicken? Too many buzzword ingredients? I left feeling like it was more expensive than what I got out of it, as well as not terribly unique. They're not doing anything wrong, but that doesn't mean I have to love it.This place would be great if you had to meet someone for brunch in LES, but I wouldn't go out of my way for dinner.",1
20,1,3/19/2018,144,,"Queens, NY",Jessica C.,151,4.0,243,The wait is quite long here like over an hour for brunch around 2pm long.I ordered the french toast which came nicely stacked like jenga. Two layers though so dont think youre getting an actual tower. lol Each piece of french toast had a cornflake crust on the outside that provided great texture. It also came with greek yogurt and fruit which gave acidity and tartness. Also get the syrup on the side to prevent the french toast from getting soggy. 100% would order again since it satisfied my sweet tooth without being too sweet.My friends got the huevos rancheros tostadas and the LES croque madame which they really enjoyed! So overall i think there is something on the menu for everyone.,1
21,,10/12/2018,1,,"Ardsley, NY",Dana P.,0,2.0,18,"Despite several open four-top tables with ample space around them, my party of four were sat at a four-top very, very squished between two other parties. Fine, but at that table there was almost no room whatsoever to squeeze past the other parties to sit on the banquette. The host did not offer to pull the table out and so my friends went to try and squeeze by the other tables to sit down and by doing so knocked over our neighbor's glass of water. It shattered to the floor and we apologized profusely, however, very weirdly, no one in the restaurant cleaned up the glass all over the floor (not to mention the puddle). In fact, when we instinctively stepped away to allow them to clean it up and then asked if they wanted to clean it up, the host said nothing, very awkwardly, so we sat down and ended up sitting with our feet on broken glass for our entire meal.We flagged it to the host again and then to our server and nothing was done. The glass breaking was so loud (in this tiny restaurant) that I find it pretty impossible that no employee knew what had happened. Luckily we were all wearing closed-toe shoes but really this was unacceptable.The food was fine. My food was prepared incorrectly so it wasn't a great meal for me but my friends all enjoyed their food: the huevos rancheros, pancakes, and french toast. I have worked in the food industry for many years, both FOH and BOH, and I give great leniency and understanding for service, but this was too weird and I will not be coming back.",

The food was delicious too, and you can tell they use very fresh ingredients. Definitely recommend!",
23,1,7/23/2017,85,,"Manhattan, NY",Rose I.,3164,5.0,377,"Everything was perfect. Ambiance, decor, the crosswinds on a beautiful summer evening. The food was even better. What a nice surprise to find a blend of healthy and hearty offerings to satisfy the sophisticated yet indecisive palette in a casual setting. Started with the smoked cauliflower and fried quinoa. I haven't had fried rice in awhile because I'm picky about the grain used - quinoa was the perfect substitute. Filled with veggies and egg, the quinoa was enjoyable and could serve as a meal for some diners. Smoked cauliflower fritto was delicious thanks to the harissa yogurt Tried the salmon - it was delicious .  If that was the last thing we ate at the restaurant we would've already been satisfied. But then came the meats which blew us away and left this dish in the dust .. nothing wrong - it truly is a tasty way to get in protein and omega-3's. Just not as memorable as the following..The lamb flatbread and the brisket burger, which came with thin (not shoestring) fries, are must-have - they're amazing! The flatbread appears to be served on one or two soft tortillas (hence the dual pricing).  If you eat lamb, you're going to like this. If it's your first time eating lamb, you'll like it too. The dressing and hot sauce on the side work well together .. the star of the meal was the burger. Juicy is the first thought that comes to mind followed by hearty and flavorful. Succulent on a toasted brioche as well. I normally don't like brioche (I find them dry and stale-tasting) .. this brioche was extra laminated and moist to my liking For dessert got the homemade strawberry rhubarb crumble. I thought it was quite heavy/thick in the middle with a strong tart taste.. perhaps if the crumble was a little more crisp and chunky I would've enjoyed it more. I won't dwell on this weak point because the impression was quickly redeemed when the bill arrived with 2 chocolate chip cookies .. warm, a little crisp, and all chewy.. these were perfect .Bright and airy, this restaurant creates a comfortable atmosphere to enjoy really good food",2

Updated review",19,8,"San Francisco, CA",Anish S.,4,5.0,17,"Apologies to the Minnie's team. True story here.I'm sitting at the Ludlow Hotel with a friend. Two women nearby start talking to us and asking a bunch of questions. Then the more drunk of the two, seemingly out of left field, went on a mini-rant about how terrible Minnie's is. I've never been to or heard of Minnie's. So my assumption, understandably, is that someone working at Minnie's must have treated her poorly. Why else would someone hate a restaurant enough to bring it up in conversation with strangers? They must've done her dirty.In a yolo moment, I let her use my Yelp account to offer some revenge to the establishment that wronged her. Karma, really. I was typing, but she was dictating. This is why the review sounds like a 9-year old who just watched a PG-13 movie with 7 cuss words and feeling rebellious.We all had a quick laugh once I clicked send. Justice served.I: ""Lulz, so what did this place do to you anyways?""Her: ""My ex's girlfriend owns it. And she sucks.""I: ...So there you have it. I just trashed a small business owner near my new neighborhood who is likely a very lovely person, chef, and entrepreneur. And did it with the linguistic sophistication of that one kid trolling AIM chat rooms with ascii art (13 / M / []D[][]\/[][]D).",

The space is very cute, and we were seated immediately.I had the LES croque madame and my friends had the huevos rancheros. The food was good, but not amazing. It also came out very fast. I think from the time we sat down to the time we finished eating, it was only half an hour. That was a bit weird for ambiance, but I it's definitely better than the alternative.",1

I will definitely be trying them next time instead of the burger.",

30,10,9/18/2017,4932,7,"Manhattan, NY",Ruggy J.,5152,5.0,2413,"I gotta say, I expected nothing, but was blown away by Minnie's.I unfairly judged a book by the cover. My original sniff test of a 25 year old novice restauranteur funded by a nightclub-owner father was suspect at best. There was no way this was going to be anything but a privileged millennial with deep pockets and more focus on Instagram baiting than giving Clinton Street a great new restaurant. I was completely wrong, though the place certainly does make for a great Instagram photo op. Minnie's is as legit an operation as any, and deserves to be standing shoulder to shoulder with any other restaurant in LES. Their pork belly burger was an indulgent treat that sounded like a gut bomb on paper, but was well balanced for something so rich. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the fluke ceviche was light, crisp, and perfect for a warm night in the city. Paired with an inventive take on an old fashioned featuring aged Balsamic vinegar, it was one of my favorite meals of the month. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu (including that cake you've seen all over the internet), and perhaps sometime soon they'll be open for lunch during the week. I have no clue if that's a goal of theirs, but something this good should be open more than five hours per day.",12

Food: ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly - top half is crusted and seared while the bottom is raw.  Served with additional veggies, overall very delicious with citrus flavoring from the greens. The girlfriend ordered the 1/2 chicken - she enjoyed it, a bit dry but flavorful. Of note, the chicken takes at least 25 min to prepare, so beware.

We had high hopes for it and both came out a little underwhelmed but agree it's a solid spot in the neighborhood for a ""girl's night"" dinn. The good: vegetable and egg fried quinoa (we both agreed it's something we'd like to try to make on our own); hot and fresh out of the oven strawberry rhubarb crumble; v trendy decor and open windows make for a pleasant mealThe not so good: smoked cauliflower fritto (something about the flavor on this was a little off);  the price ended up being $50 each for three small plates, two cocktails, and one dessert, way more than either of us expected to spend for a casual Thursday dinner",2
34,,6/27/2018,42,1,"Elmhurst, NY",Gabby C.,13,1.0,25,"I gave this place a 1 star forIt's service. I'm a very bubbly person hit my server Charity was such a complete b***** (female dog). Can't curse because I also have to remember this will go public. I got invited here thru friends and we all met there it was a nice cool dim place the setting was spectacular. The server must I say was just rude I asked her what was good and what she would get on the menu. She first asked me if I was vegetarian, I told her I wasn't but I eat vegetarian dishes right away she was just rude. Maybe I cameOff arrogant but she definitely showed her arrogance. That's besides the point I thought I was crazy but my friends throughout the evening saw it too. I ordered a glass of red wine and I asked her if she had merlot she told me we only have this and that on the menu might I say with an attitude. I dontt play with people That are serving my food because it's the obvious they are serving my food. When she had went to get the drinks I noticed her say something to the bartender or wherever was at at the bar and they both looked at me. Made me feel stupid and uncomfortable.  We all ordered my friend ordered the zucchini and steak which was delicious and I really enjoyed my order which was the cauliflower and peppers which was great it was a fried Cauliflower with a pink sauce and some jalapeño red and green peppers it was interesting and delightful. My other friend had ordered the burger which was good I'm assuming because he ate it all. At the end of our dinner we asked for deserts and she told us the deserts my friend asked if he could add gelato to one of the desert she said sternly no. I mean I get it ,it's whatever on the menu you'd have to follow. But it's a matter of good service might I say it's at moderate pricing but people go there to enjoy food have good conversation joke a little just enjoy life. At the end of the evening she directly just placed the check in front of me when it should've been placed in the middle of all of us. Maybe this server Charity S. Didn't like me but we all felt it at the table or maybe she didn't like me because I asked if there was merlot and said the wrong thing. It doesn't matter!  Or maybe she didn't like us because we were Asian. That's besides the point. You guys have real good food but this server really disappointed me it sucks because I work in the hair industry and food and hair come hand in hand. Word of mouth also goes a long way. So if you do decide to go there just make sure your server isn't the bald headed girl with a tail in the back. She isn't a happy camper!",1

We ordered small plates due to a time constraint. These included the sheep and the pear, the smoked cauliflower fritto, and the lamb neck flatbread. The cauliflower fritto was probably the best of the three. However it did seem that the amount of yogurt was a bit too much as a compliment to the cauliflower. The sheep and the pear was disappointing. The ricotta was piled so high that it swallowed the flavor of the pear and pomegranate. The lamb neck flatbread was OK, but for $19, the price didn't make sense.",

However, when we arrived early for our 1:45 reservation for 2, the hostess wouldn't seat us, saying that the (many) empty tables were reserved for later parties. We would be seated only if we gave up the table in 30 minutes. Baffled, we asked to speak to the manager, who had to be reached by phone after some more unpleasantries with the hostess. The manager, in all fairness, was nice on the phone, but at that point, we felt unwanted as customers by the on-site staff and didn't feel comfortable staying. Perhaps when the service improves, I will have a chance to try their food. In the meantime, there are many other great restaurants in the neighborhood that respects its customers.",1

After experiencing insane wait times at Clinton St. Baking Co., my friend and I decided to stop by Minnie's and give it a try. Best decision ever! The menu, while on the small side, offered a good variety of choices. I settled on an iced coffee and banana pancakes. The iced coffee is the best iced coffee I've ever had; seriously, it's addictive. The pancakes? I still dream about them. Fluffy, filling, and contains the perfect amount of banana.

48,3,8/23/2017,35,1,"New Orleans, LA",Charles M.,3,5.0,22,"Minnie's is the best new restaurant I've eaten at in years. I was shocked to learn they've only been open for a month or two. Despite being in a trendy part of NYC the staff was very friendly and helpful. We called at the last minute for a large group that included four young children and the hostess told me she would have to check and get back to me about reserving a table. I assumed that was that and started thinking about another restaurant when my phone rang and it was the hostess telling me they'd be happy to put a few tables together for us, even going so far as to warn us that they had another large group. The other group turned out to be a wedding party which only added to the festive atmosphere of the small eclectic space on the LES. The waitstaff was equally friendly and very knowledgable about the small, but exciting menu. We started with a few salads, the cucumber and heirloom tomato being the best of the bunch. The dressing was light, with just the right amount of acidity. It tasted like I made it myself ( I am a vinegar snob and usually hate restaurant made salad dressings as they often use cheap, mass produced vinegars.)  The tomatoes were amazing! We  also had some fried cauliflower which is a much neglected treat. My only complaint was I wish it had been larger, but then again I was sharing with a large party.Often restaurants that offer excellent starters disappoint when the main courses appear. This was not the case at Minnie's. Every entree we had was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and unique in its flavor profiles. My favorite was the pork belly which was crispy with just a thin layer of melt in your mouth fat between the crust and the succulent meat. The sauce was also wonderful with a hint of sweet and sour. I regretted offering to share it among my fellow diners. Next time I will make sure to order one just for myself. The strangest menu item was the lamb neck flatbread. It turned out to be the best shwarma/gyro I have ever eaten. The meat was crispy, yet not dry and the slaw and sauce were flavorful without overwhelming the meat. Even the young children in our group were able to find selections on the menu that pleased. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked as was the roasted chicken served with caramelized summer squash. The french fries were also a big hit with the kids and adults alike. For dessert we were offered a 'birthday cake' that was a huge hit with the kids and chocolate mousse that was passable, though not at the same level as the rest of the meal. Finally they brought us out some wedding cake for the kids from the wedding party that was just then winding down.  Minnie's is owned by a delightful young lady who watched over the dining room all night, as any good owner should. I can't wait to go back!",3

We ordered a few cocktails but our favorite was the sunburn (although they were out of the edelweiss flower that is supposed to go in the drink). The sunburn was smooth, sweet delicious. The love potion cocktail was interesting - the tequila was a bit overpowering the drink and it was annoying to spit out the peppercorns that constantly entered my straw. The margarita was OK. We loved the sheep and peach - so many complementary textures and flavors - I could have gone back for more. The pork belly was also delicious and loved how there was definite crispiness to the skin. The salmon dish was fine, but nothing spectacular in comparison to other salmon dishes we have had elsewhere, and the octopus salad was a little overly fishy despite all the lemon/citrus and beans that were thrown in to neutralize/complement the fishiness. To end the evening, there were two small warm chocolate chip cookies that arrived with the bill. Service was kinda slow - we were tucked away in a corner so it wasn't the easiest to get the attention of the server. So overall 4/5.",2

The icing on the cake is a parting gift of complimentary chocolate chip cookies that melt in your mouth.

The seating is cozy and the staff we interacted with were all very friendly and accommodating. Apart from the online menu, there is a short wine and cocktail list, and several dessert options.My friend and I split 'the sheep and the peach', since we'd seen the photos on Yelp, and I agree with previous reviewers that it is a must-order; the ricotta and caramelized peaches are a delicious combination. For our entrees, I ordered the salmon and my friend got the burger. The salmon was perfectly cooked and beautifully flaky, with a great combination of flavors, but might have benefited from more vegetables on the side to complete the dish -- if you're hungry, I recommend pairing it with a salad or small starter. We finished with a slice of the pink birthday cake, which was fine but not extraordinary -- one of the other desserts (fruit crumble, chocolate mousse) might have been a better choice. Of course, we gobbled it down anyway.Overall, this is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and we will definitely be back.",

My hamburger was great so I would recommend ordering that if you are looking for an experience as follows - Thinking that a restaurant with 4.5 stars in the LES would be pretty busy on a Saturday night, my boyfriend and I made a reservation for 9:30pm. When we get there, we are surprised to see that the place was almost empty with only 3-4 other patrons in the restaurant. The hostess sits us down at our candle lit table and brings us menus. Intimate ambiance so we are thinking so far so good. We order our food and then it starts to go downhill. In a matter of minutes (around 10pm), Cardi B's new album was BLARING at an extremely inappropriate volume and the bartender starts vigorously prepping the bar for all of 0 people. There was not one person at the bar and she is prepping it like there is a line out the door. The table next to us got up and left, my boyfriend and I wishing we could do the same and however we unfortunately had already ordered food. My boyfriend and I are yelling across the table in utter disbelief that Cardi B was blasting like we were at a club in basically an empty small restaurant where people are (trying) to have a nice intimate meal. It truly couldn't have been at a more inappropriate level of volume. The blonde hostess with short hair came over to check on us on approximately 0 times.

We got the burger which is incredibly delicious, the octopus was great and some peachy cheesy appetizer. Yum! Will definitely come back and i personally highly recommend this place",
86,,6/29/2017,0,,"New York, NY",Mack S.,2,5.0,4,"Been waiting for this place to open for a while, the windows looked very promising from the outside.  It's just as nice inside, too!  We got the lime and fun cocktail - delicious.  The pork belly was incredible, and everything else on the menu looked spectacular (the salmon, the ricotta and peach dish, the fried-rice quinoa situation, the ceviche - everything).  We'll be back!",
87,,7/13/2017,9,,"New York, NY",Greg K.,7,5.0,13,"This place is the perfect addition to the Lower East Side.  I live one block away and had the most amazing dinning experience tonight.  I dined with a friend that wasn't going to eat, we ended up sharing the grilled octopus with beans, quinoa with fresh veggies and burrata with grilled peaches.  It was all insane.  I'm so happy this is in my hood.  The music was perfect too.  This is my new favorite Manhattan restaurant.",
88,,7/12/2017,0,,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",Madeline S.,0,5.0,5,"An excellent new neighborhood spot, that's worth making the walk a bit East any night of the week (except Monday!). A perfect dinner choice for Summer, thanks to wide open windows, fun printed pillow and gorgeous flower boxes -- all very appealing to the eye. Excited to see how it transforms throughout the seasons. I could stay at Minnie's for hours, beginning with light bites (typically start with the Octopus, Cucumber Salad or Ceviche) +  a glass of Minuty rosé or one of the delish cocktails, followed by some salmon, and ending with the delicious crumble and glass of red wine -- I always leave satisfied, but not too full, and very happy. This ""something for everyone"" spot is perfect for many occasions -- date night, din with the parents and group dinners. And by the way, the wine menu is extremely impressive!Minnie's attracts a chic crowd, wide age range and generally low key but bustling crowd. The friends and family vibe contributes to a fun, welcoming, charming and social atmosphere. Friendly, cute and extremely stylish Millie, owner and hostess of Minnie's, shines through as an exact representation of the amazing new NYC dining establishment she built!",

91,,11/5/2017,0,,"Manhattan, NY",David H.,0,5.0,5,"I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary on a coworker's recommendation. The dinner was fabulous. We split the lamb neck flat bread and then I ordered the salmon and she ordered the octopus. We were both blown away by the variety of flavors and the general ambiance. We had plans to go to a cocktail bar after, but decided to move to the bar and order dessert while chatting with the wonderful bartender. The pink cake must be tasted to be believed!!",

93,,9/11/2017,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Giulio G.,0,5.0,19,"Love this place. It's quaint/cute, with a top notch menu. The owner is young and hungry(as in she's trying hard not she needs to eat more.) I honestly think new competitive businesses are exactly what that neighborhood needs to stay vibrant. Go check this spot out it's good vibes!",

The ceviche is the best I have ever had - complex flavors creating a welcome twist on a favorite, delicious salmon and who doesn't love pink iced birthday cake.  Chef John exceeded our high expectations! This restaurant is a must!",

The fried quinoa dish is a real crowd pleaser and the burger is maybe one of the best I have ever had. The owner has done an amazing job of integrating the space with the outside and is always bumping amazing music",
