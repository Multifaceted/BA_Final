Updated review","Come here if you want a yummy burger in a novelty environment/speakeasy kind of experience.  It's NYC so it's pricey.It's hidden in the swanky Parker New York Hotel.  It's past the concierge and towards some drapes on your left side, which leads to a narrow hallway. Then voila, the burger joint.  Order a burger with cheese or not.  Then choose your toppings.  Add some fries, beer and ENJOY!  It's suppose to mimic a hole-in-the-wall joint.  We watched the World Cup on a tiny, vintage television.  The TV was so small, we couldn't see the score, lol.  There are some funny messages on the walls and you can write on the wall.  Leave your mark.  Write on the wall after you eat your burger.",,,
1,Tiffany C.,"Chicago, IL",2,11,9,3.0,10/19/2018,"Burger joint is in a very unassuming location hidden in the lobby of Le Parc Meridian. I actually thought I was in the wrong place until I saw a neon burger sign near a curtain. I came on a weekday during lunch and I was lucky to snatch a table up right when a party was leaving. Service was quick for how busy the place was and cashiers was friendly.Burger was average, nothing to rave about though. I don't think I'll be back. Main draw for me to visit was the ""hidden"" aspect.",,,
2,Karla M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",30,54,68,5.0,9/13/2018,"We LOVE thus place! Such good burgers and fries. It's hidden inside this beautiful hotel, but it's super casual and messy even: writing on the walls, old wood and you order fast-food style. It's def a place to try out; but there usually is a line! Enjoy!",,,
3,Jill W.,"New York, NY",342,89,8,4.0,11/18/2018,"Really great ""hidden"" burger spot in the Le Parker Meridien. We came here not quite sure what to expect as it is really hard to find even when you are in the hotel itself. When we finally got there, the place was completely packed. We were surprised that there was no waiter service but even on a Saturday night, we still were able to get a table without much hassle. The burgers tasted extremely good and definitely are comparable to J.G. Melons (i.e. they taste very good!). I also appreciated the 90s music blasting in the background with Sex and the City posters around us. I would definitely go back!",1,,1
4,Elle D.,"Manhattan, NY",84,130,23,3.0,11/19/2018,"I like burger joint for its tucked-away-charm! The adorable neon burger sign (and giant line of people) is the only evidence of the divey burger joint tucked away in the Parker Meridian. It's an expensive burger ($40 for me and my husband for 2 drinks and 2 burgers with fries). Cash only! Tables are tight! While I'm glad I checked out this tiny Zagat-rated burger gem, I don't think I'll be coming back!",,,
5,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,3.0,8/12/2018,"This joint is located in a fancy hotel. it feels completely out of place cause the interior of the joint is so messy and drawn on. There are menus in different languages there so you know this place has to be touristy. I feel like tourists come here to try a traditional American burger. Decent amount of seating inside, but due to the sheer number of people here, we ended up sharing the table with several others. Pay at the front after ordering and grab your food when it's ready. Classic cheeseburger - medium patty. Not a very big burger. Buns are not toasted. Fairly basic burger you can make at home. Fries - skinny and comes in a brown bag. Decent amount of fries. Not very salted. Plenty of other places with better burgers. Not sure why this place is so popular.",4,1,1
6,Courtney R.,"Alexandria, VA",10,127,294,3.0,10/10/2018,"What I thought was cool about this place was that it was located in a hotel,  behind a red curtain. So it had a sort of unexpected mystique to it. The service was quick,  the people working were very nice,  I am giving them three stars because I got a bacon cheeseburger with the works,  and the actual meat did not taste seasoned. The burger was over all okay,  but had I not got the cheese,  bacon,  onion,  mayo,  ketchup,  etc on it I probably wouldn't have finished it.",,,

The line thankfully didn't get long until 5 minutes after I arrived. Got a double cheeseburger and a small coke. It cost me $22. For the hype and price, this place isn't anything to rave about. The burger was good but similar to Shake Shack. Your money is better spent elsewhere.",2,,
9,Nadia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,29,33,1.0,11/4/2018,"Overpriced overhyped burgers. Long line to wait to order and find seats in a small establishment. Burgers are basic and nothing extraordinary. A meal of cheeseburger, fries & drink is $30. They serve it in a paper wrapper and greasy bag for the fries. In n out in LA is 100x better. // only 3 beers to select from.",,,
10,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,151,3.0,8/27/2018,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Monday night after reading some good things about this place. There was a bit of a line and we probably stood in line for about 45 minutes before finally ordering and sitting down.I went with a double burger and a side of fries. I asked for the burgers medium, but they were definitely medium well, as it seems like they just sort of serve the same burgers to everyone no matter what they ask for temperature-wise. That being said, these burgers were pretty huge and the double burger was quite the handful.As far as the flavor of everything--it was pretty average and not really worth standing in line for. The back room vibe of this place is cool, but again the food just doesn't live up to the hype.",1,,1
11,John R.,"Clifton, Louisville, KY",612,216,7651,4.0,5/15/2018,"Love this little tucked-away gem. Greasy-spoon burgers are my jam. burger joint delivers. Popped in here during a trip to NYC. For starters, it'll take you a hot minute to locate it inside the Parker Hotel. It's not out in the open. Look for the neon sign. Once you locate it, you'll notice it's a relatively small restaurant. There are a handful of booths. It's a somewhat tight squeeze but there is room for groups. The menu is relatively simple. Choose a Hamburger or Cheeseburger. Choose a single or a double. Choose your toppings. Add fries or other sides. The burgers are hearty, big, and come out fast. I got a double with cheese and mustard. The fries were crisp, savory, and juicy. I definitely recommend adding those on. Check this place out if you're in the area. They're open later than some nearby spots and the wait time is short!",,,
12,Daisha N.,"Seattle, WA",481,559,1574,5.0,10/17/2018,"I've been to this spot several times and I have to say it was delicious. Its a hidden little gem and you wouldn't know what this is unless someone told you! I do love the atmosphere and there is normally a little line, but they are quick to take your order. Just remember they are made to order, so the wait can take some time. I've sat in here a few times. In fact I've taken one person here, but for the most part, this was my secret spot. The price, it was pretty high for a burger and fries, but never left unhappy! After a long day of shopping you should stop on here and get you a burger and shake!",,,
13,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1900,827,3.0,2/3/2018,"Beyond the upscale marble walls of Le Parker Meridien, you have the gritty, hipster, New York-themed Burger Joint. The hamburgers are okay here, nothing special, and relatively small for the price ($8.96 for a hamburger, $9.42 for a cheeseburger). Mine, with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mustard, actually made me a little sad. But I was beatified by the retro vibe and cool walls. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you want a unique experience in midtown, it's not a bad spot. Had no wait on Saturday at 7, which was awesome, so I suggest you come then.",8,6,8
14,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,104,69,3.0,2/3/2018,"Tucked away inside the Parker Le Meridien, burger joint is a small establishment in midtown with an even smaller menu. Their specialty is indeed burgers and not much else. For a small midtown eatery, they've got a great low key/trendy vibe (some tourists but doesn't feel too tourist heavy). They only seat about 30 people and burgers are ordered from register. The graffiti written and engraved into the wood walls at first feels overwhelming but at second glance it helps add a lot of character to the restaurant. The burger is on the slightly smaller side, only 5 ounces and can be cooked anyway you like. It's definitely a delicious burger but does not rank anywhere near as good as some of the burgers that you can get downtown (such as Whitman's, Minetta Tavern or the Spotted Pig).The rest of the menu is fairly standard for a quick serve burger joint. Fries that look and taste like they came from Mickey D's. Milkshakes and coleslaw are a nice touch to the menu but aren't anything to rave about.",1,,1

16,Mad P.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,34,56,5.0,9/3/2018,"Burger Joint is a must-visit location for me whenever I go to New York City. ""Hidden"" behind a curtain in the lobby of Le Parc Meridien near Carnegie Hall.The burgers are excellent. The genius of Burger Joint is it's simplicity. All the ingredients are fresh and you can tell. I have eaten here multiple times. This time I was unimpressed with the fries, but the cheeseburger with everything (pickles, fresh onions, tomato, lettuce and ""special sauce""), cooked medium, was worth the transcontinental flight (from Los Angeles)!",1,,1
17,Christin M.,"Brooklyn, NY",189,124,662,3.0,11/16/2017,"Burger = 5 starsDining Experience = 1 starThe burger here is indeed exceptional (as are the fries!) but sadly not really worth the frustrating experience of battling rude tourists to find a seat/space to enjoy it in my opinion. The patty was juicy and cooked perfectly. The toppings were generous and fresh. But there are just too many other amazing burger options in nyc where I'm afforded elbow room to enjoy my juicy food without others desperately hovering and waiting ...in super cramped quarters. Because the space is so limited and cannot accommodate a queue system for seating, I think staff working the floor would be helpful (you shouldn't have to tell a tourist that their luggage doesn't get to enjoy a seat in a booth while many are waiting to sit but clearly some people don't get it).",4,,1

The space is small and tight. 70's type basement feel going on. The menu is simple. Waiting for your burger is another 15 minutes. Overall I thought the burger was quite good. The meat was of good quality and was fresh and juicy. A little savory and a little salty. Smoky grilled flavor, but definitely could've used more seasoning. The bread was good, but a little too thin. The greens fresh. Fries were crispy and delicious - probably the best part.  The shakes were delightfully thick.",,,

20,Jacques I.,"Bellevue, WA",100,1311,2074,4.0,10/27/2017,"Solid, no-frills burger joint, hidden in Le Parker Meridien.I wouldn't have known about this place had it not been for Anthony Bourdain who knows his shiz and never disappoints!  Like Bourdain, I don't want anything special with my burger.  I like old-school burgers with the basics and a SOFT bun.  I never understood what the deal was with the brioche bun and all things fancy when it comes to one of America's iconic foods.  It's a burger!  It's meant to be a simple, greasy and have that touch of Americana. I came here for lunch and was happy to find that there were still tables available because I read before that the place gets crowded, especially since it's so small.  Hidden on the lower level of the hotel, you're only guided here by the fluorescent, neon sign of a burger, with an arrow that points down...once you look by the curtains in the lobby.  You order at the counter where it's cash only and it doesn't take long for your order to be ready. I ordered a Cheese Burger with the works, which consists of lettuce, tomato, onions, ketchup and mustard AKA what a burger should come with.  Additionally, I had fries and a bottled water, as the combo costs about $16.  The burger is wrapped in paper and fries come in a paper bag, so if you get take-out, it's easy to do so, which may be handy during the lunch hour.  10 minutes later the place was getting packed with suits.  The burger, like the joint, was solid and casual.  The beef patty seemed to be about six ounces and was cooked to a perfect medium, which was juicy and flavorful, especially with the melted cheddah cheese on top!  You don't need much to be satisfied when a burger is cooked perfectly on the grill, which is the case here.  For a simple burger that is beyond fast food yet without the fluff - burger joint proves it's the place to check out, even if it's located in posh Le Parker Meridien.  Thanks, Anthony Bourdain!",3,,
21,Jonathan H.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",0,31,0,5.0,11/17/2018,One of the best burger places in ny. Hard to say what it is but the meat is just perfect and buns taste great.

What a let down. My daughter thought it was good but could tell she was just saving face--it was her choice...I was hoping for a bagel this morning but got up late and completely went straight to the Burger Joint on 54th at Le Parker Méridienne around 11:30ish just a few steps from our hotel. For the price point I thought it was not worth it. Probably the burger I got, the meat was dry, there was no juice as one would expect in a burger made from fresh meat.

Updated review","I don't understand all the negative reviews here. This place is amazing. As a lover of burgers, the burger joint definitely exceeded my expectations. Don't come here trying to watch a sports game or eat a wide variety of food. Come here expecting to get a kick ass burger and fries and you won't be disappointed. Limited seating, but my partner and I were able to snag two seats easily on a Friday night as people are in and out fast.",,,

Place order, look for your own seat, take your order, finish your burger and then clean up after you finish your burger( including cheeseburger + works+ soda+ fries) total price is $16...wait, you have to tip even they don't do any service besides cooking so what is difference than McDonald's?  This is a legend place but not for a foodie.",3,,
27,Tung D.,"Santa Monica, CA",364,359,586,3.0,10/5/2017,"The reason I wanted to try this restaurant was because, it was a ""hidden"" burger restaurant. ""Hidden"" was in quotation because it was not exactly hard to find haha. Located inside the Le Meridian Hotel, the restaurant is super crowded during lunch/dinner time, and you can easily spot the line which usually extended all the way to the hotel lobby.Once inside, follow the red curtain to a corner to find the neon sign of a burger. If you see a line of people, that is it. The interior was pretty hip, with all the wall decoration. There was also an old-time tube TV, which was airing shows from the 80s and 90s.Onto the food, the price was jacked up a little bit. I got a ""the works"" cheeseburger with all the toppings (lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, mayo, mustard, and ketchup), and a soda for $17.51 including tax and before tips.It took a while to wait for my burger. I didn't particularly mind because it felt cool and privileged sitting inside the restaurant. Plus, that meant they made the burger fresh. It wasn't easy to find a table though. It was 9pm when I visited but it was still quite crowded. The burger wasn't that particularly outstanding. It was fast food type of burger. Definitely not gourmet / artisan burger. The beef patty and the cheese was pretty fresh of frying pan though. The beef however, was quite average and flavorless. The fries were regular fast food fries that weren't much different from McDonalds. Still, it tasted much better than fast food chains like Shake Shack or In-n-Out. If one day you treat me to a fast food burger dinner, I would pick this one over Shake Shack and In-n-Out every time. Let me just put it that way haha.",2,,
28,P C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,26,0,4.0,10/30/2018,"It's a pretty good burger spot, parked in the back of the Meridian. Prices are high for what it's worth, but the quality is pretty solid.",,,

The cashier was very unfriendly, but it wasn't really an issue with ordering anything.The burger was decent but there are plenty of other great burgers out there. I wouldn't make a trip here just for the burger. We also got fries, which were very nice and fresh, without too much salt added on. The chocolate milkshake was the best part of our meal.Seats are hard to get and we luckily happened to be standing next to a table that left. Otherwise, we may have had to wait a lot longer for a seat.Don't like that the menu is really hard to read and is unclear until you get to the very front, which makes you have to scramble to order. Unclear if this is supposed to contribute to the ""decor"" of the place but it could be contributing to the long lines. Also think for what we get, it's a bit overpriced - but hey, it's a place inside a NYC hotel. What else can I expect?Decent option for a burger in the area at night time, but I wouldn't make a separate trip here. Would consider stopping by for a shake.",,,

Not a great spot for hanging out, more just a come in, eat, and get out kinda joint to let other folks standing in line have a chance to sit down and enjoy their meal too.Apparently you're not supposed to write on the walls, I think it started with having celebrities sign the walls.

Very cute inside, with graffiti and messages on the wall. The seating is extremely limited, about 4 booths, and people were definitely waiting for us to finish! We stood on a traditional fast food-ish line, with workers who hurried you along if you weren't quite ready to order, or in our case, was unfamiliar with the menu. My daughter got a hamburger plain, with a fountain drink. I opted for a fountain drink and a grilled cheese. It was totally not a grilled cheese but a cheese san grilled in some parts and cold in others (gross) and wasn't edible. Sigh. My daughter liked her burger just fine. We scored a table, too, which was eagerly watched by workers on lunch break and scooped up as soon as we cleared. Cute place in the city. Mediocre offerings but good if you're on the fly.",1,,
36,Diane K.,"New York, NY",217,108,702,3.0,8/16/2017,"It was fun trying to find this little hidden burger place. It's located in the Meridian Hotel but all you need is to find a huge black curtain next to the hotel receptionist desk, find a LED burger icon/sign and walk into the ""alleyway"". When we hit the entrance, we couldn't walk further in because the wait line was already up to the entrance. You first order, find a seat (or take out) and then pick up your order. The seats you would expect to be available when you finish ordering. It's self-served so make sure you throw your own trash into the garbage bins after your meal (One of my biggest pet peeves...) Although they accept major credit/debit cards, they want you to tip them in cash. The menu is written on a couple of cardboards with colorful markers, somewhat hidden and hard to read since the place is really dark. It somewhat gives out a mystery, but relaxing vibe. If you are hoping for a good picture of the food, it's going to be difficult. (Refer to my photo, looks like crap) buttttt the burgers were satisfying and super hearty. My boyfriend ordered a double cheeseburger with The Works (their mixing sauce) not understanding how big the burger would be. He thought it's jus like the ones from Five Guys...The presentation was somewhat similar. It was two patties and typical burger garnishment (tomatoes, onion, lettuce), it was whooping $17 before tax. It does fill you up for sure but I thought that was a bit too high, basically the price of a restaurant burger. To me, it was just an ordinary burger.",,,1
37,Joey R.,"Atlanta, GA",97,92,279,5.0,8/22/2017,"A trip to NYC without visiting Burger Joint is like peanut butter without the jelly....or cereal without the milk! On a recent trip to NYC I wasted no time heading straight to the place that serves up some of the most mouthwatering burgers the Big Apple has to offer. Don't let the small digs fool you. Although it's located in the Le Parker Meridian hotel, burger joint is practically a hole in the wall. But this hole in the wall draws massive crowds with wait times that can average 30 minutes or more. Don't let this stop you from achieving pure burger bliss. Is 30 minutes too long to wait for a juicy, meaty chunk of heaven?The ambience is certainly not the secret to the  legendary success. The restaurant is dark, drab, and claustrophobic...which is just fine by me. Once I have one of those burgers in hand, all is right with the world. All burgers are thick, juicy, and made to order. They offer both single and double hamburgers and cheeseburgers with classic toppings. It tastes like a thick burger grilled up in your own backyard. Be prepared to get down and dirty! These burgers are juicy and messy. Also don't be alarmed at how much they pile on the toppings. You can always remove whatever you don't want.The french fries are decent and they also offer whole pickles and huge chocolate brownies but it's the burgers that really shine here.  If you are staying in the hotel, you can actually order takeout by calling the restaurant directly. You can then bypass the line and simply walk up to the register while everyone gives you the stink eye. Otherwise, the only way to get this burger is to stand in line and try to patiently wait.There is limited seating here, so you will either need to take your food elsewhere or stay and fight for a table. There are some tables and booths but nowhere near the number to meet the demand. I've  sometimes taken the burger out into the lobby of Le Parker Meridian and chowed down there.They are open daily from 11 am to 11:30 pm and  midnight on Friday and Saturday. I've sometimes seen them give away free food like the chocolate brownies at closing time. Don't miss out on one of the best burgers in NYC. Don't worry... You can thank me later! :)",,,

The burger was excellent and the fries were also fantastic, for the price and quality. The presentation isn't anything NYC amazing but it didn't matter it was good and worth the wait.

After seeing it featured on his show The Layover, I had to try Burger Joint the next time I was in Manhattan. I'll be straight with you, it's not easy to find. It's located inside a hotel, down a tiny, dimly lit corridor, to the right of a neon burger. It all feels very Eyes Wide Shut until you're embraced by an overwhelming burger aroma and the sounds of classic rock mixed in with some Mowtown. It's a small spot with walls covered in writing and signs that say ""don't write on the walls"". The menu at Burger Joint is small, a positive when you consider the fact that they have perfected the few items on it. I ordered a burger, medium rare with the works (lettuce, pickles, tomato, mustard, ketchup, onion - no mayo) with (shoestring) fries and an Allagash wheat beer. I don't know what to say other than, this burger is exactly (EXACTLY!) the way a burger should be made. The bun, excellent. The taste, astounding! The meat, flawlessly grilled. Being from Canada it's not easy to get your burger medium rare, but when you can, and it's done properly with meat that has been well stored, good god, what a treat! The price point is fair, the ambiance is banging. There is a bit of a wait but, c'mon, that's what happens when a tiny place seemingly covets big business. I'll be back for certain. Like, every time I'm in Manhattan from now until forever.",3,,
47,Vicky T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,41,2,4.0,4/17/2018,I think I found out about this place by watching one of Anthony bourdain's shows. Was in the area a few weeks ago... starving... and craving a burger. Oh man.... this is a very very tasty $9 burger. A 10/10 rating burger. Fries are extra.  Fries were a 3/10 rating because they were room temperature and stale tasting fries.. which is surprising because this place was packed. There are like 15 people on line at any given time. So fries should always be hot and crispy because burgers and fries are cooking nonstop at this place. How are the fries room temp and stale? Lol Weird. Anyways... if you love burgers... check this place out.  Its hidden in the parker meridien hotel behind a curtain near the front desk.,2,1,1

Eat and then leave, don't be that jerk who stays on his laptop for 20minutes while people holding burgers struggle to find a spot. Burger is similar to shake shack but with nice grilled flavor and cooked medium. Fries are like a better version of MacDonald's fries. Price is pretty steep at 9 for a burger.

The cashier was very unamused at his post and didn't even acknowledge us for a while which is difficult because this restaurant is very tiny. The actual restaurant is cool in terms of decor and the written menus. I got a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a coke which brought my total to around $20. I did enjoy the burger, but I could've had a similar if not better entree and experience at Five Guys or Shake Shack. I was with a friend who concurred.

The burger was juicy and definitely great but the fries were sub-par at best. I saw the fryer in the back pour them out of a freezer bag and fry them once, not worth the extra $5.

Just walking to burger joint is a cool experience. Upon reaching the concierge desk at the Parker Meridian, you walk past the right side of the desk, go to the back, and find the burger spot nestled in a corner of the hotel. The whole space is probably no bigger than a (large) studio apartment, with a few high tables and 6 or so booths for seating. The line can get gnarly, but moves quickly. Now to the food. Let me say it again: these burgers are da BOMB. The patties are thick, juicy, and well-seasoned, and the fixings (e.g., lettuce, tomato) are fresh and crisp. I loved the fact that for the cheeseburgers, they used sharp cheddar slices, and that they lightly toasted the bun. On top of that, the fact that they wrap each one in butcher paper, which somehow brings it all home for me. The fries here are also good but they're essentially...McDonald's fries. I LOVE me some Mickey D fries, but am I really going to the Parker Meridian for that? And the sodas are typical tristate area pizzeria cups and beverage options.So, yeah, food here is expensive. It's at least $11+ for a whole meal. But the burgers are excellent, and the vibe *is* cool. Definitely on my list of NYC's iconic burgers.",2,1,2

Mostly tourists at that time.The burger is super- right amount of fat, great grilled flavor. Good bun, slightly toasted, fresh lettuce and tomato, ketchup, mustard. It's really quite simple - but they nail it. IMO no need for fries. They don't go deep on beer selection (3 on tap I think) but you can find something that will go great w/ a burger - I had an Allagash White.Bottom Line: Go. But mid afternoon or at night.

You can't really go wrong with a cheeseburger, which is why I went for that option. I thought it was juicy and good, but I think I expected a lot more than that. The fries were pretty close to McDonalds if you ask me... I tried my mom's burger which was a spicy burger and I thought it was a lot better than mine.

Somehow, they gave me one regular cheese burger and one double cheese burger. lol Taste was ok. However it wasn't taste like the best burger, but it seems they use all natural veggies and meat.

And I know why!  I never thought I'd say this but the burgers here are just as good as inn-n-out, if not slightly better!  And I love inn-n-out!  They reminded me of inn n out burgers but with a thicker more sizable and tastier patty, and a little more moist overall.  I was pleasantly surprised.The burgers are only $6-8 each but for some reason when you order a double (two patties) the price doubles.  You could've just bought two actual burgers?  They do have tasty fries and beer, but you also have to pray a seat opens up when your food is ready and the place is tiny.  Shockingly the customers were all courteous enough to let the person in front of them take the next available seat, instead of jumping ahead and saving seats.  Go NY!  Or maybe it was bc we were all tourists and in a good mood.  I also liked the divey decor and SATC poster!",,,

First off, don't be fooled by the luxury and ritziness of the hotel. The décor is also very rustic inside burger joint, so don't expect the vogue appearance that you see when you walk through the lobby. Find the curtain with the door and the neon burger sign and it's basically there waiting for you. Depending on what time you go, there could be a short wait or a long wait... but just expect great tasting burgers and fries. I can say that the food here tastes really good and the prices are fair.

Came to check it out if it was actually legit. Also because it's located in an upscale hotel in a tiny place behind the curtain. The contrast is intriguing to me. My bf and I popped in around 11:30 am. No ridiculous line yet. We both ordered a medium rare cheeseburger and fries. First impression, the presentation is not appealing. The bun was smushed and everything was messy when I opened the paper wrap. I'm a person that also eats with my eyes (and I love taking pictures) so that was a huge no no for me. Tbh, the meat wasn't super juicy, the seasoning was standard, and the fries just tasted like McDonald's fries. For a burger that cost $10 it was kind of disappointing. I would rather go to five guys or shake shack with more topping options or just a cheaper burger. If you are a tourist, this is a (good) place to experience an American burger. The interior walls are pretty artsy as well. But for others, the burger is not special at all and I wouldn't recommend it.",2,1,2

But hey, it certainly makes an interesting story and spot to check out.Burger Joint is one of many gotta-try places we have all heard about, but never really got the chance to try it. Well today, I finally got to it! Despite the freezing cold weather and countless tourists waiting on line in hopes to get a taste of what used to be or still could be the #1 burger spot in NYC, I was determined to get my hands on one. A medium-well cheeseburger with ""the works"" (lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard, ketchup and pickle) and some fries I got! The cheeseburger was bursting with smoky grilled flavor and every single ingredient sandwiched between the two slices of bun was married together harmoniously with every bite. It was truly a classic cheeseburger and with classic flavors. The only drawback -- the beef patty lacked some salt. As for the fries, they were sub-par.I'd come back again for the burger just as long as there is no wait... p.s. A note from my fellow Yelper: Grilled Cheese was not a good choice. It was just three slices of cheese with burger buns, un-grilled, for $7+. You could get another burger for the same amount.",8,3,5

This place definitely exceeded my expectations. I didn't know how big their patty is, so I got a double cheese burger. Will I go back and make the same decision knowing how big their patties are? Yes. Lots of goodness, why not?Their burgers are grilled to perfection. Their patties are very well seasoned, and they use good quality meat. Juicy and packed with flavors. The works and the sauce go very well together. This place is an example of how to create an excellent classic burger. The buns are very soft and flavorful, and it obviously couldn't hold my huge double cheese burger together. This was the only downside.

If you didn't know about it you would walk right by it off the lobby. It's to the right of their front desk. The line was out the door & it took a good 20-30 minutes to get food around 9pm on a weekend. There aren't many seats so hopefully you can come with a person so one stands in line & the other hunts down seats to save otherwise you have to take your meal to go. The burger was cooked well & tasted ok. The hamburger bun was something completely regular you would use at home. I wasn't impressed with the bun & bc of that the burger was so juicy it fell apart. It created a mess & I couldn't really enjoy it. The fries come in a bag & they were pretty well. You feel the need to eat fast since there's such a huge line of people to get in for your seats. It's very crowded in there & super hot since there's just one tiny door to get in & they're cooking burgers on the grill in a tiny room. 2 burgers, 2 fries, & 2 drinks cost us $60. Super pricey.

129,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,4/13/2017,"This is a great place to take someone you want to impress with you're knowledge of the NYC food scene. You go into Le Parker Meridien in midtown (it's a 5-star hotel) and basically find this random curtain, pull it back, and walk into a burger joint. The only way you'd know it was there is a neon sign of a burger.Be warned: there is barely any seating. You're either going to eat standing up or take it back to your office/apartment. I'd say the tables turn over every 10-15 minutes or so as with many burger joints, but it's not the best place to wait (dark and cramped). Pro Tip: Have everyone except one friend sit down or find seats while one unlucky friend gets on line and orders. If you're bold or friendly you can sometimes ask other people to share a table, and sometimes others will ask you the same.Keep in mind, you have to pay a bit of a price for the exclusivity we're talking about here. They know they've built up some cache with their name and whole speakeasy-esque schtick which is how they get away with charging $20 for a burger.Most importantly: THE BURGER IS DELICIOUS. Seriously, it's amazing and one of my favorites in NYC (see my list). The meat is juicy, the bun is fresh, the lettuce and tomato are crisp...all the ingredients of a great burger.To sum up:Pros:- Amazing Food- Makes you look cool bringing friendsCons:- Expensive- Limited seatingI personally think the pros outweigh the cons, but then again I once waited 3+ hours for the Spotted Pig burger",6,,2

How good can your burgers really be when you have to rely on the hype of being ""hidden"" in a hotel, right? Wrong.One whiff of the burger joint and I was sold. This is an American burger joint. The music, the grungy scrawled notes on the wall, the booths, and that smell of burger fats cooking. There is nothing touristy about this experience in my book.Now let's talk about their cheeseburger because there is little I love more in this life than when I bite into a burger and all the fats and juices ooze out of the patty.

The quality of meat didn't taste that great, it was a bit juicy and tender but that was about it. It ordered it with some classic toppings, iceburg lettuce, tomato and red onion. The tomatoes and onions were thinly slices but the iceburg was kind of just ripped up and thrown in.The cheese was a thin slice and was completely melted but not totally overpowering. I saw that they typically ask you for the temperature but they didn't do that for me, not sure if it was because I called in the order but would have liked to order it a little rarer.I didn't bother ordering fries because I just wanted to try the burger but I don't think i'm missing out on anything.

140,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",284,130,874,3.0,8/19/2015,"We decided to try Burger Joint tonight based off of a recommendation.  I'm not really a ""no frills"" burger place kind of girl (yes, I want bacon, avocado, and some caramelized onions on that, please) but the reviews of this place are stellar.  Burger Joint is located inside a gorgeous hotel with a big, dark bar in the front.  The restaurant itself is nestled in the back.  We approached a Six-Flags-ride-esque line which we thought was for check in - turns out it was for the restaurant.We waited about 45 minutes in a Wednesday night in this line.  The line wound around twice so each time we thought we were getting close, we were promptly shut down.  While you are on line, you can review little paper menus in other languages which you can mark your orders on (cute and helpful if you have a different native language). We ordered burgers, fries, soft drinks, and a brownie dessert (pretty much the extent of the menu).  You seat yourself while they make your food, and they deliver the food to your table.  I got my burger plain with cheese, and it was good - not magical but very solid.  The fries were the star; they were thin, crunchy, and not salted.  I thought that the food was good, but it wasn't anything super out of the ordinary.  The place was kind of a dive and our table was sticky and our seats were cracked,  but the atmosphere was lively and fun.  They told us that they would bring over our dessert later on, and when they didn't, we went up to ask about it.  Turns out they ran out of brownies, which was disappointing (wish they told us earlier) but they did give us a milkshake to make up for it, which was nice/fair.  Overall it was a good experience; I would go back if there was no line, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this burger.",1,1,1

When I finally realized where it was (thanks to other fellow Yelpers!) I went back and ended up having one of the best burgers I've ever had!They cook their burgers to your liking, so you know you're getting a fresh burger. Their fries aren't the greatest, but definitely plentiful. The seating area is pretty small, and it can be really hard to get a place to sit during their peak hours, but it's the perfect opportunity to have a seat with either a tourist, or a New Yorker.

The Burger Joint is hidden in Le Parker Meridien and most people wouldn't think this type of place even existed there. Second, wait in line for at least 20 minutes to order. Once you get to the front, you better know what you want.  There are only a couple of ways to order your burger: either a hamburger or cheeseburger, single or double. My boyfriend and I decided to order the cheeseburger and a side of french fries. The order came out pretty quickly.Overall, the burger was really good, but not great. I'm sorry to say but I've had better burgers at Five Guys. There, I said it. Here's the thing: the patty was not seasoned. Also, the burger was pretty messy.

It's the mix of mayo and ketchup that does it.  The burger was juicy. 5/5 for the burger.There is no 'service' so I can't rate that.But what really pulled this place down was the fries. They are really crappy. I would say like a 1.5 or 2 at best. I think they should either take them off the menu or do them better.Would I return?Maybe.

The food:Cheeseburger with The Works- The works is w/lettuce, tomato, onion, sliced pickles, mustard, ketchup, and mayo. The burger looks like a hot mess, it is not photo friendly at all. I thought the burger was just OK. I had a few issues with the burger, I thought the beef itself had no flavor and to make it worse, I don't think the burger was seasoned at all. In terms of the burger as a whole, I really only remember tasting pickles, mustard and onions. The bun did have a nice chew which was nice.

To begin with, the place was filthy. There should be guidelines on how many people can eat at the restaurant, because if an emergency happen, everyone would be trapped inside. There's almost no walkway because there's a lot of people in line, tables combined, and people waiting along the walkways. In addition, the burgers they are serving are mediocre. You'd be better off spending your money at five guys, shake shack, or in n out. They just don't offer any value on their menu. Their shakes are $10 and there's nothing special about it. More importantly, the staff are not friendly. They shout at you and does not communicate well with you. If they make a mistake of giving you a different order, they would make you pay for their mistake. These people should not work in the service industry where a person should be hospitable and kind. I understand that they need to make up for their mistake, but for the prices they are charging, they should be able to make way enough.

Not me, that's for sure.It's located in Le Parker Meridian hotel. It's not exactly hidden as there's a big neon sign. But if you need directions, walk in through the revolving doors, and past the reception desk on the left there's a hallway. There will probably be a line.It's an amazing contrast of divey within a nice hotel. The walls are written on, and there's a seemingly random assortment of movie posters on the wall. The menu is written on a piece of cardboard, but since they probably have a lot of international customers, they have different language menus outside by the door that you can fill out instead of trying to explain what you want (really nice touch).Funny story - before the West Village location opened, I had actually been to a Burger Joint in Buenos Aires. They had the same logo, cardboard menus, and markers to write on the walls, but to this day, I still don't know if it's a knock-off or related. But that was an amazing burger. I expected no less from the flagship.The line was pretty long, but moved fast. I think it only took 10 minutes to get to the register. Make sure your order's right, the sign warns, or else they'll send you to the back of the line (I don't actually think they will, as the guy taking our order was super nice). Give them your name, and they'll call you when your meal's ready.I went with a cheeseburger medium rare with basically everything except mustard. That's lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayo, pickles and ketchup. Also a side of fries, which come in the paper bag and grease it all the way through.As far as the burger goes, it was great, but a victim to the hype. I thought the meat was nicely spiced and cooked well. Not a small patty, but pretty flat. Bun wasn't anything to write home about as it was just prepackaged bread. I thought it tasted like a fancier version of fast food, in the vein of Shake Shack, but better.Definitely not in the consideration for best burger in the entire city, as there's a whole crop of ""fancy"" options.

Don't order the double cheeseburger - its gigantic.  I had flashbacks of Smashburger - it was falling apart in my hands.  If you must, then order two cheeseburgers instead.2. The burger was definitely juicy - no question.  The wrapper it came in was drenched.  However, I felt the burger was bland - no seasoning (even salt or pepper) whatsoever.  Couldn't even appreciate the cheese being there.3. The french fries were shoestring fries - crispy but, again, no flavor.  I did make note of several people in the joint reaching for the salt (as I had to).4. Vanilla shake was good.5. The place now takes credit cards (previously it was cash only)Overall, I think its a bit excessive to pay for this burger.  It's over-hyped and definitely better burgers out there in the city.  Try it once (when you get the opportunity- by no means do you need to go out of your way for this meal) and then move on.",,,

This is no bargain and the taste is just, I hate to be cliched, 'meh.' McDonald's is better.  This is sad to me since this used to be a hidden gem in midtown but I will not return. There are so many other better burger places.  Walk over to 8th Ave to Five Napkin, or go to Five Guys.  However, I recognized that my words will fall on deaf ears,  This place is now ensconced as a tourist stop and they will continue to come, filling the coffers of this overpriced and unfriendly place.",,,

The place looks like a pop up from the outside but it is a real structure on the inside with a funky Texas BBQ decor. Not a huge selection and you order by starting with the works and subtracting what you don't want. They did not have Jalapeños though, which was a real bummer. Sigh. Oh and you gotta put your fone away. They have a real intolerance for peeps who bees situationally unaware, which I wish more places had. Oh, and know what you want when you get to the person at the counter. If you hem and haw, they will send you to the back of the line, which can be long but moves fast. I had the cheeseburger wit everything and it was excellent. Cooked right in front of ya, and an honest to goodness real bun. Prolly the best burger I have eaten in midtown and the grill master knew the difference between medium and medium-rare. Juicy and nicely charred like an expert backyard griller does at a Super Bowl party. The only place that I have been to that could possibly give them a run for their money is Jackson Hole, which I have loved for years. Outstanding fries were presented as well and a serious helping for sure. The only thing that takes away a star was the brownie, which was dry and kinda burnt. I expect they sourced it from someone else but I am not sure. The staff was very funny, and although they were busy, they had time for a joke and a smile.

This shows up as the best in NYC we'll hell it's just a ciuplke of blocks so we trek up 6th and 10 minutes later were there. My wife and 2 daughters (adults) finally find the location. Inside the Meridian Hotel. Didn't know it was partitioned off inside literally the lobby. The line was 30 minutes long, can't see inside so not thinking to go look we stood there. But we were out if the weather. When we get to the entrance we see not a trendy, rock/punk looking joint. But a 40x40 you order at the counter, good luck finding a seat, $29.95 for a double cheeseburger, fries and a beer. Anthony Bourdains review 100%correct and on point. Stay away.",,,
178,Phil M.,"Oshawa, Canada",5,222,401,4.0,2/28/2016,"If you want to try the Burger Joint, it has to be the location at the Parker Meridien hotel.  The burger itself is nothing great, but the experience is a must!  You walk into this beautiful 5-star hotel and the last thing you would expect to find is the Burger Joint.  It's hidden behind this big red curtain.  To the left of this curtain is a dark hallway with a small neon sign that is the icon of a burger.  That's it... no signs, advertising, nothing...  If you don't know it's there, you would walk right past it.So walk down this dark hallway, approach the dimly lit neon sign and you will reach the doorway.  You walk in and you're in another world, amazing... you just left a 5-star hotel and walked into a burger dive... awesome!  The place is small, crowded... but the atmosphere is great with happy people eating their burgers, great burger dive decor. Again the burger is not that great... but you have to go to this location at least once for the experience.",2,1,1
179,Staci B.,"Thornbury, Australia",39,42,94,2.0,7/4/2016,"Everyone loves a hidden location right - be it a bar, a restaurant, or a burger joint!Burger Joint was easy enough to locate - behind the red curtains past the reception at the Le Parker Meridian, the neon burger on the wall guides you to the door that is the entry to this hidden spot.We came on a late Thursday afternoon (post the lunch time rush) and didn't have any problems with finding a table and the queue to order was a reasonable one.  There is rather dim lighting, which can make the menu - written on cardboard in front of the kitchen - hard to read, especially when the room to order is already minimal. Sadly the excitement of finding the place and admiring the cool fit out was the height of any joyful feelings for the visit as the burger was just pretty darn average.They had cooked the burger to near perfection - still a little pink on the inside, but charred and brown on the outside.  But unfortunately, it just didn't taste any good.  It was just a circle of meat without any flavour or taste.I'm glad we got to experience this secret burger bar, but once was definitely enough.",,,
180,Andrew S.,"Queens, NY",299,618,1198,4.0,1/8/2016,"Impression is you walk into a nice hotel and behind the curtain you feel like you walk into another dimension, a messy hole in the wall burger joint as if in the middle of no where. Booth seating, non booth seating, messy-tattered walls with sharpie written in and old framed magazines and posters on the wall... intentionally dumpy decor.Booth seating is dim but not too dim, lit with a defaced lamp, but overall pretty cool. Not much of condiments on table except salt and pepper but on the side there are packs of ketchup, mustard, mayo, hot sauce.Ordered cheese burger for $8.96 and fries. Burgers are medium size stacked with your basic choices of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickle, etc...it's a pretty basic burger, pretty plump. Burger meat is meaty but light and soft, bun is soft and thin, overall burger is good. The fries are thin, not so crisp, meh average fries, hey guys did you get these fries from McDonalds?Drinks: Bottled water, five choices of soda from tap behind the counter and Samuel Adams on tap. Stack of brownies at the register, looked tempting when waiting but not sure how long they been there based on appearance, pass.Old school television playing basketball game.I use to remember they do not except credit cards, now they do!",7,4,6

A perfect medium rare does the job quite well. The burger is greasy, tasty, and has a perfect bun to meat ratio. Be prepared for long lines, so I suggest coming early. The fries are thin and not too mushy but not too hard (I prefer mushy fries) - nothing to write home about. I would come again if I happen to be in the area.",3,,3
182,Zonia M.,"East Elmhurst, NY",25,79,35,4.0,2/16/2017,I would give this place 3.5 STARS.The burger was pretty darn good. However they're a bit pricey and I wasn't a fan of the fries. The menu is pretty straight forward and the place has limited seating. Also the place is hidden inside a hotel which is odd and it decorated like an low-light bar kind of scene.,,1,
183,Christina O.,"San Francisco, CA",16,40,26,3.0,2/3/2017,"Short version: pricey and small. cool ambience. would not come again. Our über driver said the best burger in ny was this place. Although reviews said otherwise, I decided to have faith in our uber driver. It is located inside a very nice hotel. You find the door off to the side of the lobby and it seems really out of place with the rest of the hotel. But it gives off a hole in the wall, hipster/divey feel. The walls are plastered with stickers, pictures, and sharpie writing. It was about $10-15 for a burger, fries, and a drink. But the burger was so small and the patty was not irresistibly juicy. It was just your basic burger.",1,,

Most of my coworkers thought this was a joke, but to me (being the Californian that I am) it sounded enough like the Grilled Cheese at In-N-Out to warrant giving it a try. Have to say, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. It was okay, but really overpriced for what it was. Not a huge fan of the fries either as I felt they could be crispier. Meat eaters of the group seemed to like their burgers, though! Just not an ideal lunch spot for vegetarians.",1,,

The atmosphere and decor were clearly the best parts of this restaurant. It's like a hole in the wall joint inside a nice hotel. Unfortunately the food was not representative of your typical hole in the wall. The burgers were very bland and the fries were blah. And what's up with no free refills on Coke? My BFF works for Coke so I know they get great margins on that expensive cup of soda. If not for the creative decor, I'd give fewer stars. It is definitely a tourist trap and was packed!

The burger I ordered (cheeseburger 'the works') was definitely a good burger, but not as delicious as the reviews suggested.

195,Melody C.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,325,42,3.0,12/14/2016,"I'm sure when they first opened, it was a cool thing to be this kind of grungy, here's your damn burger, shop in a nice hotel in a nice, touristy area. At least that's how the fondness of the place was related to me. Because...it tastes like a burger anyone, without trying, can make and put together in their own backyard/patio/rooftop barbecue with decent, slightly under-salted fries. Especially since there's that line. That line, where on the weekends, you're snaking around outside and then you get your burger, and then you're like...why? I could have gotten a better burger at Shake Shack for almost half the price.The worst of it all, though, are the people who come here. Mostly made of tourist, or just some obnoxious drunk people on weeknights. It's like everything you don't like about Manhattan rolled up into one tiny spot. There are people who stand way too close to you, who breathe over you, who shout to their families over you, who cut in front of you, who grab a table before they've even ordered because they don't understand how seating logistics work, and who get to the front of the line and then not know what to order, which slows everything down. If you're there on a weekend, and you're standing in that line that's still outside of the joint, and it's been 30 minutes, you're already thinking, ""man, why am I doing this to myself?"" And then you think, well the food must be worth it. But it's not. The shake's not either.Oh, oh, oh. Also. Their soda to syrup ratio for their fountain drinks is off. Too much carbonated water, not enough syrup. Yes, I care about things like that.What I do like: the decor. It's adorable in it's messy way, hinging on a little try-hard. The people who work there, because somehow are enjoying themselves and having a lot of fun. The regulars who cut, but I don't give a shit because they make the workers happy and they just want to take something to go. The menu in different languages outside. The paper everything for your burger and fries.Ultimately, my opinion doesn't matter because this place's popularity is beyond. But if someone talks this place up, please bring yourself back down; it'll make the experience more enjoyable.",1,,
196,Wendy L.,"Berkeley, CA",672,1239,76,2.0,10/6/2015,"Despite having stayed at Le Parker Meridien multiple times, I went to The Burger Joint when I was staying a few blocks away. I was excited for a tasty burger and was sorely disappointed by the relatively flavorless hamburger patty. The fries were good and definitely the highlight of the meal.You really shouldn't done here unless you want a burger and fries since there really isn't anything else on the menu. It's a ""dive"" of sorts just off of the reception desk at the hotel. It can get packed but luckily you have high turnover since this isn't a place where you'd want to linger.",6,,
197,Arvid Y.,"Rochester, NY",310,488,739,3.0,9/23/2014,"So maybe the quality has fallen a bit since its inception, because I visited Burger Joint over the weekend and was not impressed.Don't get me wrong, it's an above average burger, but not worth the 30-45 minute wait that I experienced. I think Burger Joint's biggest draw is the fact that it's hidden inside the Le Parker Meridian hotel. It's got that ""it factor"" and in today's age, hidden equals hip.The restaurant itself is tiny, with a max occupancy around 30 people. The line-up forms around the restaurant and towards to lobby of the hotel. A burger is around $8.50, which is not bad considering it's in NYC and a supposed ""hotspot.""The burger patty was of good quality. It reminded me of a thicker In-and-Out burger. It was juicy and cooked to order correctly (medium). The toppings, including the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles were crispy and fresh.The real bummer was the bun. It was slightly soggy and not completely toasted. I was hoping for something more substantial with a bit more texture. The other disappointing thing are the fries. They taste EXACTLY like McDonald's fries to me and after reading some other reviews, i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks so. Overall, not a bad burger. Just not worth the hype and wait. I definitely prefer Shake Shake and even Five Guys. At least I can tell people i've been here now, I guess.",3,1,
198,Winnie L.,"Irvine, CA",108,132,254,3.0,3/7/2016,The atmosphere was fun but not the line. It was a great burger and fries and glad I tried it but I wouldn't stand in that line again.

The biggest news is that on a Friday the lady and I actually got in without a huge line and found a seat with a minimum of fuss. We both got the cheeseburger with the works, shared fries and then I sat back down until our order was ready. The burger, was delicious, hot, greasy, not as flat and bland as I thought it would be.The fries were, well, I found a hair in it. I went up and the guys behind the counter whispered to each other ""another one with hair in it..."" EwThe next bag fortunately, didn't have any follicles in it and after careful consumption of the burger didn't find any hair in the burger either.The hair thing alone and the repeated occurrence would be enough to rate it lower but I kept thinking about that burger for 8 meals afterward. I think blendwise, Burger Joint's mix is one of the best I've had. Everything else about this place is a distant star to the meat-but when I flash back to it I see a long hair right in the middle of my fries.",1,1,1
