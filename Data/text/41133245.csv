1,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,637,4.0,10/18/2018,I was in the West Village and searching for a cocktail bar to go to to end the night. Pegu Club did not disappoint! I'm not the best when it comes to direction in the west village but the place wasn't hard to find especially with a bouncer outside. My boyfriend and I ended up trying their earl grey cocktail which was so good! You could really taste the earl grey. I wish I had more room in my stomach to drink more of their fun cocktails but it was close to the end of the night. Pegu Club is open pretty late and when I went there was a lot of seating by the bar. I can't wait to come back to try more of their drinks!,2,,1
2,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",208,241,160,4.0,9/28/2018,"Pegu Club was really one of those first speakeasy / fancy cocktail lounges to start the cocktail club movement in NYC and the rest of the country.  AKA, it's one of the originals. I made it a point to come here a few weeks ago as it's been on my NYC cocktail joint hit list, and actually made a second trip a few days ago with friends visiting from Houston.  The atmosphere itself is cool - overlooks Houston street, dimly lit, a mix of bar, lounge and table seating, but starting to feel a little dated against all of the new and shiny-er cocktail places that have emerged and been inspired by this place over the years.    But you come here for the drinks.  There is true artistry and  science that go into developing cocktails like these.  I went for the Pisco Punch, which had pineapple infused brandy, grapefruit, lemon juice and lime. I loved it so much I ordered it again a few weeks later. And one of the best things about Pegu Club is HAPPY HOUR! So few of these fancy cocktail lounges have happy hour, where you can snag a cocktail for a cool $10 instead of $16.  Don't quote me, but I believe happy hour is from 5-7 during the week. But totally worth dropping in for a drink before dinner.",1,,3
3,Nada S.,"Mississauga, Canada",132,211,583,4.0,5/24/2018,"This place was so great for our afternoon cocktail stop. The cocktails were very well constructed and the flavour palettes were fantastic. We were disappointed to find out that several menu items for the ""snacks"" were sold out so early in the day before the evening even rolled around. Over all we had a good experience. The only reason I docked a star is that service was sub par and the missing menu items was a huge let down. If you're just going for drinks and cool ambiance. I recommend it.",1,,
4,Aishwarya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,73,125,5.0,10/17/2018,"This is the first of the reviews I'm doing to the places I went to celebrate my birthday week this year. I have to say this place has a classy vibe. Its big and cozy. The bartenders are nice and attentive. I only had one too many of the Earl Grey MarTEAni and it's to die for. It tastes exactly like earl grey tea with a boozy feeling. It is purely delicious. If you're a tea fan like me, you must get it. It's so addicting. I couldn't stop having it. The place is sorta pricey but it's worth it. I will stop by here again just for that martini. It made my birthday extra boozy and extra special.",1,,1
5,Monica C.,"Long Island, NY",19,49,21,5.0,10/29/2018,"This place has been on my list for several years but I never made it until recently with a date. We met at another bar that was way too noisy and overcrowded so we came here with fingers crossed hoping to snag a table on Friday night without reservations. Luckily, we were seated right away! It's a great classy spot, dimly lit, with lounge seating that's perfect for a date or an intimate evening with friends. It's quiet enough so you can have a discussion without yelling and the drinks are great!",,,
6,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,982,6061,3.0,4/13/2018,"After having dinner in the area we were not quite ready to call it a night, my friend mentioned this place so we decided to stop by. after a small walk since we needed it after dinner we arrived here glad the place was not crowded we came in & sat down in the front area.Drinks we went with the Earl Grey MarTEAni .. this is a very interesting drink it's earl grey infused gin, lemon juice & raw egg white quite tasty & gives u a very nice buzz.as for the place very cool laid back vibe, dimly lit, good music playing along with very nice comfy seating. A common factor in the reviews seems to be the service, seems as though not so great for some for us it was good, granted we were only here for drinks.Prices are a bit pricey on the cocktails ($16) hurts a bit since you really can't get too crazy otherwise u will find yourself with quite the bill. We enjoyed our drinks & time.",10,1,5
7,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,5.0,4/11/2018,"I've been meaning to come here for a while and finally got the chance to! It was everything I imagined and more.Granted my experience might have been different since I went on Easter when not many people are out, but it wasn't crowded at all and the service was very friendly. Ricky, the bartender, was able to not only make the delicious drinks on the menu but come up with original cocktails based on my preference. He got it right every time and they all were amazing! Out of the cocktails on the list though, the Black Pearl was definitely my favorite.I would definitely come back here again, especially on days when Ricky is working. Tell him what you like and he will make something amazing for you.",2,1,2
8,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,483,1214,5.0,1/3/2018,"Gorgeous, opulent with a speakeasy feel & ambiance, Pegu delivers on many levels.Arriving earlier in the evening granted us the choice of prime seating selection; however, it was nearly packed upon leaving.What I liked about Pegu's atmosphere was the option to choose a comfy sofa seating or table with chairs.The ambiance was cozy, sultry and definitely sexy. Again, a speakeasy kind of ambiance.Pegu  is known for their creative craft cocktails and the Piquante was the one that hit my eye as it was spicy. I was glad i could substitute vodka for gin. The cocktail was served in a gimlet type glass---looking quite elegant--and very delicious! Nice spicy kick. A limited food menu was also available and we tried the crispy calamari (with a chipotle mayo) and the scallop sliders (just 2). I must say the food (appetizer portion but not appetizer price), was delicious.In summary, Pegu can accommodate any occasion--a date, night out with friends, casual get together or a celebration. Must visit.",11,1,5

10,Ami R.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,106,102,5.0,9/16/2018,Sits between the east and west village and definitely a staple. A good place to get solid cocktails before a night out. Get there early (7-9) before it gets packed for the young crowd to start partying.,,,
11,Jose T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",180,4,2,5.0,11/5/2018,"One of the original cocktail bars in NYC. Elegant drinks, perfectly dim lights, and exceptional service.

13,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",78,156,0,4.0,3/8/2018,"Good enough to be a go-to spot in Soho!Pegu has a vaguely Indochinese air...with a surplus of carved woodwork and an Asian-inspired snack menu. The vibe is mature and sexy, but don't expect it to be quiet....it can get pretty loud as the night progresses.The cocktails are the star here though...always on point, very pretty (beautiful garnishes, ice cubes the size of a crate, etc.) and quite potent! The servers are also nice and knowledgeable about the cocktails, and the bartenders listen to preferences - e.g., I always ask for my favorite cocktail to be made spicier...and they always crank up the heat :) It's also not hard to get a spot here on weekends, and they have plenty of standing room too.",1,,
14,Miryam Y.,"Newtonville, Newton, MA",42,68,182,4.0,9/5/2017,"My type of spot! I loved how ""hidden"" this place was. I came here on a Tuesday evening, so I'm sure it was way quieter than it is on weekends. The ambience was perfect; awesome lighting, beautiful decor, and perfect noise level. Drinks are expensive; your typical NYC prices: $16/cocktail, but were incredible.I had the Grapefruit Cooler - very impressive. I loved the detail of the cocktail glasses themselves being very cold (so cool!)My only complaint is that it was uncomfortably cold in there, but I'll take that over sweating!Highly recommend this cocktail bar and can't wait to come back!",1,,
15,Sim H.,"Manhattan, NY",55,91,4,4.0,10/20/2018,"This is a nice cocktail bar for when you want to gather in a group in a classy place, and don't want a rowdy or crowded bar. Very spacious and lively, but can still talk to each other without shouting. I hosted my birthday drinks here and you can reserve one of the seating areas. Drinks are pricey but you pay for the ambience. Nice decor too and bathrooms are kept clean.",,,
16,Cristina D.,"Morgantown, WV",233,23,4,5.0,10/14/2018,"Really cool atmosphere, great service, awesome drinks, and tasty food. The prices are reasonable and worth every penny.

17,Sophie S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/15/2018,"My husband asked for a Manhattan. We watched the bartender grab a nice whiskey (Michter's), put it down and use Wild Turkey instead. They charged us for Michter's (the tab said Michter's Manhattan) and when we asked the bartender about his subterfuge he didn't apologize, simply turned his back and re-ran the bill.  It was a bad drink, tried to overcharge us, and then had the gall to be rude about it.",,,
18,Curtis G.,"Boston, MA",87,114,115,4.0,12/1/2017,"Totally overlooked place in Soho. It's kind of hard to find since the entrance is so unassuming. Great for happy hour or pre dinner drinks and eats though. They are known for their signature cocktails  like the Pegu Club and their Earl Grey Marteani which is a personal favorite and one of the best drinks in the city. Inside is a relaxing loungy upstairs bar, nice and dark and cozy. Staff is very professional and great. Bring a few friends and enjoy a great start to your night. They have some great small plates too like their deviled eggs, calamari, duck bites! All fantastic.",2,,1
19,Yinglu W.,"New York, NY",1,213,198,5.0,12/26/2017,This place is very interesting. Different flowers went with cocktails and the tapas were designated w unique taste. I ordered elderflowers which left me a very deep impression.,1,,
20,Caroline T.,"Hollywood, FL",334,91,52,4.0,12/17/2017,"Lovely earl grey martini- this drink just truly speaks to my soul. It is the perfect mixture of liquor and earl gray with a sugar rim.Pegu is a great place to visit in soho if you're looking for a well made cocktail. It is not cheap at all so just know that before going. Not as crowded on the week days, but gets very crowded on weekends. Not worth it to go with more than 2 people on Friday or Saturday because you won't get a seat unless you made a reservation. It is much better and really completes the experience to be able to sit at a table!",1,,
21,Alyssa J.,"Fremont, CA",483,13,10,5.0,9/25/2018,"Earl gray martini and Pisco punch drinks were so delicious!!! We got there around 11 PM and unless you reserved a table, you have to stand around the bar area, so keep that in mind!",,,

Another group sat in the table that had been ""reserved"" for us, and the hostess said she'd call the manager to get them to leave. She came back and told us she couldn't because they were part of a birthday party that had reserved that area of the restaurant, and gave us no options or consolation and just walked away. This is after we had been waiting for an HOUR. Bartenders were also incredibly inattentive.",1,,
25,John D.,"Austin, TX",0,18,0,3.0,3/11/2018,"I enjoy a good cocktail.  What I had here was decent but not particularly mind blowing.  It took quite some time to get the attention of the server to get our orders in.  Drinks as mentioned were decent but not particularly exceptional for the price.  The atmosphere was also ... interesting.  Seems kind of like an odd plastic feel to it, pretentious may be a better word.",2,,
26,Allie G.,"New York, NY",0,30,16,4.0,10/15/2017,"Cool, upscale spot to grab a drink on date night, either before or after dinner. We came here around 9:15 on a Saturday night before 10:00 reservations around the corner.The entrance is pretty discreet, it's situated next to the outdoor patio of Dos Caminos and marked with a red neon lion on the door. You walk up two flights of stairs into the dimly lit space filled with plenty of tables, couches, and pub chairs. It was pretty packed and every table was filled - I'm assuming you have to put your name in with a waiter before getting one - but you can likely snag a seat at the bar or there's some standing room in the walkway.We ordered the Jamaican Firefly and a grey goose martini. The bar bus boy took our order and passed it to one of two bartenders, who made all of the drinks. This process made it take a little longer before we were served, but it was worth it. The Jamaican Firefly was their take on a dark and stormy, made with house made ginger beer. It was one of the top 5 cocktails I've had and it went down too easily. A must try!",1,,

Oh boy was this one place that I was pleasantly surprised by. Up a flight of stairs with a cute view, a charming host welcomes you in and seats you. Reservations are recommended if you plan to go here unless you kind of wandered over the way my friend and I did.Their drinks menu has a panel of their specialty drinks offered daily while the other side is seasonal offerings. The ones they have for winter are amazing. I treated myself to an apple ginger toddy and that was definitely a little too strong for an early evening drink, but I'll take a strong drink any day. Most drinks go for $15 a piece and a good number of them just sound good. There are a couple snacks on the menu, but most people seem to be there for a drink or two. The decor is nice and open, the place is warmly lit and everything about being here was absolute fun. SUCH JAZZ OVER THE SPEAKERS. Absolute favorite setting. You can get a bit dressy for date night or dress slightly more casual for catching up with friends, works either way! Definitely a place to check out!",5,2,2

33,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1187,991,6587,3.0,11/13/2016,"Pegu Club is a loud casual bar/lounge in Soho.  This was my first visit for a friend's Big Birthday.We arrived around 10:15 pm, only to find that another party were sitting at some of our reserved tables. For 10 minutes of confusion and back and forth, the other group realized they were in the wrong spot. It took 30 minutes to clear their drinks and waters. The menu had decent drinks, if you choose the right one. I got the earl grey Martini and K got the After Midnight. We both enjoyed our respective drinks: mine was aromatic and sour and K's had mezcal and smooth aftertaste, thanks to the beer chaser.  Our waters were filled consistently but the waitress didn't return to see if we liked our drinks or to see if we wanted another. Very spotty/inconsistent service for a very crowded Saturday night. Many patrons went to the bar to get their own drinks. I might come back on weekday night. Our group was pretty chill, and dwindled as the night went on.Some patrons of the Club had too much to drink, and one guest walked into the decorative fencing near the steps. Umm yea. Otherwise, it was great to see old friends, make new ones and to celebrate A's Birthday!",8,3,5

The 12 year old bar is VERY spacious that for a quick second I forgot we were still in NYC! We sat at the bar, and I tried the Earl Grey MarTEAni for my 1st drink, and the Apple Ginger Toddy for my 2nd drink. Both were delicious that I wish we had more time to try others. The MarTEAni was very light and delicate, yet strong. It tasted like a refreshing spiked glass of earl grey tea. The Apple Ginger Toddy was pleasantly spiced, not too sweet, and definitely warmed me up from being out on an ice cold 9 degree night. The bar was quiet on a Sunday night, and service was friendly. I look forward to returning and trying more drinks from Pegu Club!",1,,

42,Veronica L.,"New York, NY",128,79,23,4.0,3/11/2018,"Absolutely loved Pegu Club. Decided to come here on a Friday after work (6:30ish) & it was relatively easy to get a table. It's a great spot to chat & actually have a conversation with someone  as the noise level isn't so loud you can't hear the other person. Even if you are standing by the bar  there is enough room for you and your group to be comfortable where you don't feel cramped and squished. The staff was extremely friendly & the drinks were perfectly made. You don't feel rushed either which is something I love when grabbing drinks and just wanting to sit and chat and take your time. The only reason I'm taking one star away is because although I'm a big fan of dimly lit bars, this bar is almost pitch black. It's hard to see inside and while walking in and out I felt like I was going to miss a random step and wipe out in front of everyone.",2,1,1

44,Ankita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",646,251,895,2.0,1/17/2017,"5 stars for the drinks and environment, 1-2 for the service. Let me preface this by saying that I used to love Pegu Club as a whole. Until recently, it was one of my favorite bars in the city. And even though my last visit left a bitter taste in my mouth, I still think Pegu Club should be recognized for its excellent drinks.At the risk of sounding pretentious, Pegu Club is more of an experience than just another cocktail bar. They take great care in crafting their cocktails. You can pretty much guarantee that whatever you order, you won't find anywhere else. All their drinks have been tested and perfected so that the 4 or 5 ingredients come together to make a unique and well-balanced drink. Rather than recommending something, I'd suggest taking a look at their ever-changing and seasonal menu and exploring a little. Prices are standard for New York (about $15 a cocktail) but they're pretty strong and very tasty.Unfortunately, the last time I was here I experienced very unprofessional and off-putting service. We made a reservation for 12, and I was excited to introduce friends to Pegu Club for my birthday. Our waitress was excellent and accommodating of our large group for most of the night. However, we hit a snag when paying the bill. There was an issue with the cards, and in all honesty I still don't know exactly what happened (we got back someone else's credit card). Our own card was never found or returned. Regardless of who was at fault, I think the waitress could have handled the situation much more professionally. Complaining about customers to another waitress (while they're still there, no less) is not the way to go. Neither is becoming outright unhelpful and defensive. We had numerous people try to talk to her and figure out the situation, but left frustrated with how it was handled.Frankly I was shocked and disappointed. I might expect this from another bar, but not Pegu Club. As much as I've loved it in the past I don't know if I'd return anymore. We had a great 2-3 hours that ended on a very poor note.",11,3,2

Here you had a host walk me and my date to a very comfortable table with awesome loungy comfortable chairs and we could have a conversation. Nearby was the bar with the loud conversations etc. so the place has the best of both worlds. I had the pegu cocktail which was very refreshing and the earl grey martini, which was right up my ally. I hear if you go to the bar and give them basic drink preferences they whip you up something unique that you'll likely enjoy. I didn't get to partake in that with the mixologists. In short I'll definitely be back, this was not a one time only thing just to say I was here.",,,

It's definitely more of a lounge feel than a cocktail bar/mixology spot, but they do it pretty good. Multiple bartenders (which is great), good seating, and a relaxing environment all made Pegu a decent stop for a good drink. I had the ""Little Italy,"" which was a nice spin on a classic Manhattan. They used Woodford, Cynar, and Sweet Vermouth, which was done well. It wasn't as smooth as I'd have liked (since we also swung by PDT earlier, it was stiff competition). The decor and vibe of Pegu gave it the 3/5 for me. The cocktail menu looked pretty robust as well, but more spins off classic cocktails instead of original drinks.",2,,1

70,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,5.0,12/26/2015,"Pegu Club gets its name and its cocktail concept from the late 1800s-era British Colonial Officers' Club located in Rangoon, Burma (modern-day Yangon, Myanmar). The city is no longer known for its cocktail culture, but apparently back then, Rangoon barkeeps could mix a mean cocktail. Upon entering, there's a free coat check downstairs, complete with a friendly, chatty coat check guy. You go up two flights of stairs to get to the bar.We were a group of 10, here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday evening, and were easily accommodated even though we all filtered in at different times. Friends who had been here before highly recommended the Earl Grey MarTEAni (Earl Grey tea-infused gin, simple syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg white - $14), and I'm glad I accepted the recommendation as the drink was indeed fantastic. My second drink, the seasonal Black Pearl (Demerara rum, Jamaican rum, cherry liqueur, chamomile liqueur, Sweet Vermouth, Absinthe - $15), was even better. I tend to love cherry liqueurs in cocktails, but this was even better than I expected. The decor is what you'd expect - clean, modern, minimalist, low lighting. The drinks have comely accoutrements. Everything exudes class. Pegu Club is definitely near the top of my list of New York cocktail bars.",4,1,3

We didn't have a table, but looked like you could reserve them in advance. The atmosphere was very dim (so dim that a 23 year old needed to take out a phone light). Overall, cool spot  with really unique and quality cocktails. We both ordered spicy infused gin cocktails. Very pricey - $34 for two cocktails. I would come back on a special occasion and maybe get a table but too stuffy of a vibe for a regular drink.",1,,
72,Jonny R.,"Milwaukee, WI",92,67,28,4.0,3/15/2016,"This is a great bar for nice conversation or a date. The ambience is intimate with a wonderful decor. The lounge is upscale and has an old school vibe which I really like. The bar itself is gorgeous and really stands out in the dimly lit room. The service was great and couldn't have asked for more. I had the Pegu club cocktail which was very nice if you like a stronger taste with bitters, while my gf had the earl grey martini. Her drink was pure perfection and I'd really recommend it!Our 2nd round wasn't that great. I had the little devil (or whatever it's called) and it was STRONG!! That might be an understatement because it tasted like jet fuel. Still had nice flavor just a little too strong (and I love strong drinks but this was a bit much). Gf had the black pearl which she enjoyed but it was not even comparable to the earl grey martini. We also ordered the mini scallop burgers, the sloppy duck burgers, and the chicken satay. Everything was exceptional and their food is very tasty. I'd definitely recommend at least one order of food with your drinks. Definitely worth a second visit!!",1,,
73,Lauren B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/1/2018,"I will start with saying that I've been here before and enjoy their drinks but the service is absolutely despicable.  Here's what happened...Saturday night was my friend's birthday and 4 of us wanted to go to a cocktail bar after dinner. Having been here before, I told my friends this place was great and we should go. I made a reservation a few days ahead of time for 10:30 on Saturday night.I get to the bar and my friends are all really excited. We get to the hostess and I say I made a reservation. The hostess says she does not have the reservation. She asks if we called and cancelled it. I say no. She asks if I'm sure. etc. She is extremely rude to us throughout this back and forth. She eventually says she will give us a table in 5 minutes and we should stand by the bar. A few minutes go by and she comes over to us and tells us that there is nothing she can do, sorry. And that we should leave. At this point, I am very angry since I brought a few of my friends here and it was one of their birthdays. As this happened, about 4 tables worth of people got up. I said ""can we sit at any of those tables?"" She says no, those are for people with reservations. I was like I have a reservation!!! But she wasn't budging. We left and went to a different, way better bar and had a fun night anyway but the whole situation was annoying.I understand that restaurants mess up sometimes, but the least they can do is try to fix it. This hostess not only did nothing to try to fix their mistake, but was EXTREMELY rude to us. I have never felt so disrespected in my life. Me, nor any of the people I was with will ever go back here. The service , and based on the other yelp reviews I've read, the way they handle mistakes at this bar is problematic. If you're dying to try Pegu Club's drinks, proceed with caution. The drinks are decent, but honestly not nearly good enough to make up for their very serious service issues.",,,
74,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,10/19/2015,"I have to say, when you enter Pegu Club, it feels kinda dingy and at first glance, doesn't seem like a very well-kept cocktail bar. However, after spending some time here, I really enjoyed everything and really ended up enjoying the ambiance. A good number of cocktail bars in Manhattan seem to sprout from Pegu Club alums, so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. Came for some celebratory cocktails post-dinner on a Friday and we were able to find seats quickly for two. Again, since we were in a bit of a celebratory mood, we tried a little bit of everything, starting with mostly the ""classics,"" so to say. Started off with the earl grey martini and the pineapple pisco sour. I really enjoyed the earl grey martini, and the hints of tea were so subtle yet so delicious, and not terribly sweet. The pineapple pisco sour was pretty good too, although a bit sweet for my own tastes. We also tried the whiskey smash, which was pretty strong, although not really the smash that was advertised. I'm a big whiskey fan, and I guess it didn't really live up to my standards. However, I went with an old-fashioned later on in the night, and it was quite excellent.Service was a bit on the spottier side, but I guess we did come at a pretty busy time, so it's more or less forgivable. Also, we saw a couple that was not happy with the quality of their drinks, and the bartenders were more than happy to replace them, which was very surprising.  Prices are definitely on the more expensive side, but standard for a cocktail bar. You'd probably expect slightly nicer upholstery from a $14 cocktail joint, but it is what it is.It got fairly rowdy as the night went on, so even though it started out as pretty chill, the vibe escalated pretty quickly. Nonetheless, I had a very good time, and I'll likely be back for casual drinks, but I would avoid this place on weekends if you're looking for a laid-back place to hang out or have date night.",24,15,23

I have been here twice and it is one of the original speakeasy, craft cocktail bars in NY and I think this place is great, it's super sophisticated, it's spacious and I love the Jazz. The setup is very swanky and it feels like vintage Burma with the Mahogany wood to the windows. I really love the setup and it is an ideal place for a date, it also seems more of an adult place so come presentable. The drinks are so perfectly balanced and super smooth, they take so much time and effort to produce a quality product and it shows, unfortunately the price does too.The drink:Whiskey Smash- Rye Whiskey, muddled lemons & mint, simple syrup. It's very similar to a Mint julep. I think I could drink 100 of these, not because they are low in alcohol content but because they are super smooth and very tasty. I thought this drink was very refreshing and I love the mint addition. I really enjoyed this.Pegu Club- London Dry Gin, Angostura Bitters, orange bitters, orange Curaçao, fresh lime juice. This was a very tasty drink, it's a easy drinking beverage and I liked what seemed like the hint of apricot.Black Pearl- Demerara rum, Jamaican rum, cherry liqueur, chamomile liqueur, Sweet Vermouth, Absinthe. For me, it tasted like port but less intense. This was a nice beverage, it seemed like an sophisticated gentleman's beverage. Bitter Admiral- British Navy strength Gin, Campari, fresh grapefruit juice. Lol this was a super girlie drink, it was pink but surprisingly strong. The drink has a bitter finish from the grapefruit.",17,10,13

It was already 11pm and I was exhausted. Plus, I wasn't up for exploring a new neighborhood via subway and foot so late in the day but didn't want to pay $$$ for taxis. But #yolo, and I went for it. I started out at Employees Only after a quick $12 taxi ride. After trying to order a drink for 10 minutes and failing, I left on foot to come to Pegu Club, only a few short blocks away.It wasn't very busy (thank goodness!) and I grabbed a seat at the bar. Immediately I was given some water and a cocktail menu, and I knew right away that I needed to try their signature Pegu Club cocktail. It was an excellent choice. Since I planned to have just one more drink, I asked the bartender for his opinion. Before I knew it, I was sipping on my second one - the earl grey martini - and talking to him about what should be my third. This time, he made me something that wasn't on the menu and it was my favorite. I should reiterate that the first two menu cocktails were outstanding. This third drink started out with a scotch rinse and I think it was bitters and St. Germaine. The vibe here is very classy. Aside from bar seating, there are small tables along the wall with intimate lighting. At the bar you can witness the art of bartending. There's a small food menu and nothing caught my fancy. That's okay though because this place is definitely one that you come to for the drinks!I could have stayed for another few hours but I was getting hungry and the food I was craving was over in Koreatown. So, after asking for my check, the bartender made us a nightcap of something wonderful (how cool is it that the bartenders can drink on the clock here?!) and I was on my merry way.This is at the top of my list when I visit New York again.",6,3,6

The lighting is dimmed for a intimate atmosphere (great for dates and intimate conversation between a small group of friends) and it offers comfortable chairs so you would feel relaxed sitting down having a drink while chatting away. We chose a spot next to some windows so we can chat away while sipping our drink and looking out to the roads occasionally. Cocktail pricing is on the normal New York price ($14) but the portion was definitely on a smaller side. I ordered the Pisco Punch and it was outstanding. The base alcohol is pineapple infused Pisco Brandy, mixed with grapefruit & lime syrup, and fresh lemon juice. Jazz music was playing continuously throughout the night.

The bartenders are super crafty with whipping up drinks/ cocktails that is not listed on menu. They know their stuff. Small tapas/ bar menu is tasty! I love their Pisco Punch Cocktail (it comes with a pretty flower in it) But after a few of those it does get a little bit overwhelming I have to admit.Sat at the bar and the tables.

101,Peter Y.,"Forest Hills, NY",58,54,90,4.0,1/30/2015,"The Pegu Club is another (and I'm reluctant to use this word cause it's a kind of a misnomer that's now commonplace) ""speakeasy"" style cocktail bar in the same vein as your Angel Shares, Death and Cos, and PDTs. The reason this place is comparable is it can be an intimate space with lavish style and an emphasis on giving you a great cocktail. In other words, don't come here and order a Bud Light  But not only is it a great pick as an after dinner destination for a date, it's actually a perfect spot to relax and have a snack in the late afternoon.  Unlike the other ""speakeasies"" listed above, it's somewhat accessible. The times I've come here, I've never been turned away. You can walk in and just chill at the bar (the other places don't allow standing room). There's space towards the entrance for larger groups as well (the other places tend to limit your party size). It lacks that pretentious vibe you find at other places without foregoing the dark, candlelit atmosphere.The bartenders aren't above giving free shots either. Last time I came here, my friends and I ordered so much that by the end, the bartender was throwing shots at us. This probably marked the only time I've ever stopped accepting free alcohol. Tsk tsk...The drinks fall into the ""pretty good"" category but I won't go into detail beyond suggesting that anyone who visits the Pegu Club should at least try their namesake cocktail. As for food, must haves include the shishito peppers and the scallop burgers.  Come here for a date and your date will end well.  That's the midas guarantee.",2,1,

It's the bar that you take people to impress.It was quite crowded when we got there after dinner, so we had to hover a bit around the bar. Luckily, the really friendly bartender spotted us right away and got us menus. Not long after, the guy sitting in front of me whom I was trying not to overcrowd offered me his seats, as he was leaving. Score!The menu has a lot of cool-sounding cocktails, so it was tough to choose, but I settled on the French Pearl and the Champagne Apricato. The French Pearl was light and sweet, but my favorite of the two was definitely the Champagne Apricato, which was so crisp and fruity and refreshing. Plus, it came with a flower - points for presentation.The bartender was doing a whole dramatic show of making drinks, which I found quite entertaining. At one point he gave us a free shot for accidentally splashing a little water near us, which was very considerate. All in all, a cool spot for a date or to catch up with friends.",,,1

If you are more into sweet drinks try the pisco punch. They use pineapple infused pisco which fits great, it adds the sweetness of the fruit so they use less simple syrup.The service is very good.

Decor is fancy and the hand crafted cocktails are great. Earl. Grey. Martini. Those other reviewers certainly know what they're talking about. Listen up and get one. On a side note... If you're the type who wants a tasty cocktail, but, also wants to complain about the $13 or so price tag... We're in a big city - I'm sure you can find a bar within a 3 minute walk of Pegu Club that'll throw some 'syrup', 'mixers' and Absolut in a glass for ya for $6. Cheers!",1,1,1

But whatever it has makes my heart sing and my liver quiver with excitement because it is simply THE BEST.An upscale but unpretentious lounge with cool beats, attractive crowd, well balanced drinks and kick ass bartenders.  Now, on to the cocktails!Gin-gin mule -- has the profile of a mojito (minty and refreshing!) but this was made with Tanqueray.  I love the crystallized ginger that came as a garnish. Take a bite of it and sip your drink, gives it another dimension.  Pegu Club --  I had to order the namesake of the British officers club in 19th century Burma. It has gin, orange curaçao, and lime juice. I love the slight pink color this drink projects in a dimly lit bar, it looks very dainty, but it's snappy and very potent. Honeydew daiquiri -- made with Tanqueray and garnished with a ball of honeydew. It's like a candy cocktail but will hit you in one ... two ... three! POW! ;) Pisco punch -- a personal fave of Brooklynite Sarah W.  It's easy to drink, but they don't call it punch for nothing. I had such a great time here especially with the awesome service from bartender Ken-ta (pretty quick for a crowded Friday night) And the gratis tequila shots may or may not have influenced this review.  I'll never tell.  * hic *",15,15,18
115,Carlos S.,"New York, NY",8,16,0,5.0,7/16/2016,"Not exaggerating - my favorite spot in all of New York City and definitely the best speakeasy I've been to (although Back Room recently gave it a good run for its money).  A+ ambience and drinks.I first went to Pegu Club at 4:00 PM on a Saturday afternoon in April 2014. We sat by the window and had the whole place to ourselves.  Even at that peculiar hour for a drink, we felt moved by our experience. As you wait for your drink, read the description on the menu...I cannot do it justice, but it is highly poignant/nostalgic and captures that sensation of ""escape from it at all"" that you feel when you're there.  What I also love about PC is that I've never had more than a 10-minute wait for a spot (regardless of how late on a weekend night I've been there). I've been there about 5 times - this by itself is another testament to how great this place is since as a cardinal rule of NYC living I don't like to repeat restaurants/bars more than twice. Get the Pegu Club and the Earl Grey Marteani. Sit back in your comfy chair, relax, and enjoy one of the best places of all.",,,

This place also has a history to it, which you can read about on the menu.I arrived around 8pm on a Friday and thanks to the nice hostess, was able to secure a table for 3 with no wait and no reservation! This is basically unheard of for popular places in NY.I had two gin cocktails and the duck sliders (2), all of which were delicious. My friends enjoyed their drinks and food too.

119,Joanna M.,"San Rafael, CA",403,671,904,4.0,4/12/2012,"Do you have any of the following criteria when it comes to a bar?-The bartenders or ""mixologists"" have OCD and take more than ten minutes to make your drink, and that they use little bottles of whoknowswhat and crazy cool tinctures?-That it serve an amazing drink called 'Penicillin'? -That it not be on the ground floor?-That there is seating? That you can hear your companions talk?-All of the above?This is a hot-spot drink nerd's wet dream come true. The colonial officer's club theme was a tad overdone, in my opinion, but since it's named after a cocktail invented for white imperialists, I see that they are being thorough. Walk directly up the stairs and you'll be transported to this sumptuous 19th century era gentleman's club, and the loudest noise you'll hear is the sweet serenade of shakers and ice.I had been told that Pegu makes some of the best cocktails in Manhattan and I wasn't disappointed. Anyplace with a cocktail called Penicillin sounded like my kind of bar, and it was truly delicious, and as we weren't in any hurry I appreciated the attention to detail and time devoted to my non-pharmaceutical cure. A mixture of ginger, lemon, honey, and scotch proved to be one of the best drinks I've ever had, and if I had any ailments I'm sure that they vanished.To round out my other criteria, I have to say that this place was lower on the douche scale than I anticipated, even at 2am on a Saturday night...or Sunday morn. It was a little less intimate than I like, but scoring a small little table alongside the dark paneled wall was a way to get up close and personal with my drink away from the bar buzz. Definitely put this on your Manhattan cocktail trail route. And if you forget your antibiotics, you're more than covered.",10,9,12

They were sadly out of ingredients for the Fire & Ice (delicious-sounding chocolate and Kahlua dessert cocktail), so I resigned to the Applejack Cobbler cocktail ($14) instead.  It was beautifully made with a flower on top.  Very strong, so that little drink will go a long way.  I really liked my friend's virgin Mojito, but she was seriously served only half a drink.  The glass was literally half full (photo below), so when we asked they top off the drink, they said they don't serve drinks that way.  Buuuut my cocktail was topped off, so....huh???  Good service otherwise though.",,1,

There are cozy nooks you can tuck into for a more intimate experience, as well as open tables in the middle of the fray. Complimentary coat check at the entrance is a lovely touch, for those of us who layer up like maniacs and then want to show off our prettier threads once inside. On a Saturday night, my date and I were able to secure a nice corner table without any issue around 8pm, but note that by 10:30 the noise level was significantly higher and the bar itself was quite packed, so plan accordingly.Although you can pretty much get anything your heart desires here, it's worth exploring the seasonal offerings and also getting the house classic (Earl Grey Marteani). Be adventurous and make the trip worthwhile by not ordering the same drink twice!Although we didn't order any food, the tables around us certainly did and everything looked fantastic, so I'll definitely come with a bigger appetite next time (and there will be many, many next times!)",9,2,2

And I know this because I spent an embarrassingly long time here last week drinking till the sun was (almost) out. And then I spent the rest of the week visiting other world class bars and nothing compared to the level of service, quality of drinks, or ambience. No joke - this was the best of the very best. Some bars are fun because they're packed and loud and everyone who's everyone is there. Other bars are fun because they're quiet or divey. This bar is the perfect balance between classy/upscale and casual with the right amount of noise and people. I could still hear my friends, I could still hear the music, but it was packed till 4am on the weekend. You feel cool just being here. Another reason they're a step above for me is because they're the pavers of cocktail culture. This bar has been around and at the top of its game for 10+ years. I heard a rumor that even learning to make a daiquiri perfectly is something the owner Audrey teaches her staff for up to two years! They take making perfect drinks perfectly serious and the result is that you get the best drink and the best experience.A lot of other NYC cocktail bars are small and quaint and this one is a beast! You don't have to come here with just 1 or 2 people, there's plenty of room for a whole group! I was here with 2 friends and it was such a magical night because I came all the way from Seattle and in walked another Seattle friend who I had no idea was also in town. Imagine that? But as fans of cocktails and great bars, it ended up being no huge surprise we were both there because, well, DUH - Pegu club is amazing.

This is a great cocktail lounge that I had been wanting to try for some time. On a whim, and somewhat early on a Friday night, my friend and I stopped in for drinks (more than what we had planned - whoops!) and some bites.We were greeted at the top of the stairs and seated at a small table toward the back of the lounge. The seats are heavy, but very comfortable and each table has its own light. We decided to share a few of the small bites from the menu as our dinner so we picked three - the shishito peppers, crispy squid and the famous scallop mini burgers.The shishito peppers were great - always a crowd pleaser. The crispy squid was good, nothing special in my book. The scallop burgers were awesome. The scallop is sliced width-wise and laid on the bun with a chipotle mayo, fresh basil and onions. Rich but damn good.As for the cocktails - I started with the French Pearl - a mixture of gin, pernod, mint, lime juice and simple syrup. It was delicious - and not overly-pernod-y if you catch my drift. I had been toying with ordering the Cucumber Creole, so I decided to have that next. That drink contains gin, aquavit, sherry, cucumber, mint and lemon juice. Good, but honestly, after having the French Pearl, I was spoiled....so I went back....for a good handful more. Our server was pleasant and attentive. Though...there were two lower couch areas near our table both containing couples who were literally making out the entire time. So, due to how my friend and I were facing, we each had a couple just behind the other's shoulder who was mid-tongue for much of the evening. Had that not been happening, I am sure we would have liked our time better, but c'est la vie.Next time I go, I'd like to sit at the bar and see what else the bartenders can create.

Music is loud enough to have a conversation at the bar without straining your vocal cords one bit.   Drinks: We had a number of selections from the classic whisky sour to the Pegu version of singapore sling, which was also superb and not as sweet at the original.  After 2 rounds of drinks and warm conversation with several bar staff, it was clear that they very keen to make us happy. I will be back !",2,,
137,Veronica S.,"San Francisco, CA",277,1441,349,4.0,2/11/2014,"I think ""lounge"" is the proper way to categorize this as it certainly did not feel like a speakeasy. Waltz upstairs as you enter a large, spacious area. To your immediate corners, you'll find tables that will seat parties of 4-8.As you walk further down, you'll meet the bar to your right, and more tables to your left (mainly party of 2 tables). The bar is run by a few great mixologista bartenders. Tried several drinks here and none of them disappointed. They were all top notch, bursting with flavor but also fairly strong. Gin Gin Mule was delish but I was impressed with their Mojito - certainly not your typical fare. Order it and you'll know what I mean. Although it's a great date spot, I find Pegu is more accommodating than speakeasies (Milk&Honey, PDT, Little Branch) if you want to join with a party of 4-6. More spacious and roomy.",1,1,2

I showed up here on a Thursday around 9:30pm with 6 friends and after a few minute wait (actually only a few minutes - 5-10) we were able to get a table. Right up by the bar was crowded, but there was room to spread out. The waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and most of us found a cocktail we wanted. They didn't have any tequila-based cocktails on the menu so one friend ordered a custom tequila-based drink. We all loved our drinks, but the second round was exclusively made up of Earl Grey Martinis.The crowd was late-twenties to early-thirties and was slightly mixed - some people were out for Thursday night shenanigans while others (my group included) had just come from the office. Don't show up in jeans and flats, but you don't need to be dressed to the nines. There's only 1 women's bathroom but it's kept nicely. All of the staff were really friendly. The bar is long but not wide, so I wouldn't come with a group of 20 for a birthday party, etc., but up to ~10 is practical. I'll definitely be back!",,,

143,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,827,9215,5.0,11/5/2011,"A truly wonderful lounge, and a new favorite.  Discreet entrance on busy Houston St, this sophisticated lounge is entirely on the second floor, with nice window views all along one side.  Decor is Asian-inspired classic, simple, not eye-catching.  Plush seating for small to mid-size groups at tables, or have a seat at the beautiful and roomy bar.Overall service is excellent.  The hostesses we've interacted with keep us in the loop about seating, always cordial. The wait staff are on point, somehow there when you need them.  And the bartenders are simply good at what they do, and are attentive and easy-going.The highlight are their superlative cocktails, gorgeous creations of harmonious flavors and fine presentation.  My favorites are the Earl Grey MarTEAni, with its lovely creamy finish (raw egg white) and the Fleur de Paradis, a delicate elderflower cocktail.  After multiple visits and sampling at least a dozen different cocktails, I've concluded this is one fine cocktail institution and I look forward to many more visits here.There's a small snack menu and some of these are a fine addition to the cocktails.  Ones I enjoyed are scallop sliders and smoked trout deviled eggs.  Less impressed with the duck sliders, like a sloppy joe with overpowering sauce and passable fried calamari.Check their reservation policies.  Its possible to book an adjacent space for a mid-size (10 - 20) group.  Otherwise, its generally first come, first serve.  They don't limit the numbers of people who come in and wait by the bar so as it gets busy, it can also get quite noisy.  I much prefer being here, at the bar, during less busy times to get the best attention to the drinks and ambience.",2,,

The bartender took time to explain some unique drinks and offer advice.The drinks are a little pricey but they are delicious. I'd definitely recommend this for someone seeking a lounge for a little conversation or romance.",,,

The ambiance was very nice and we could have girly chat without problems. We ordered wine and cocktails, all very nice. But when it comes to food, there just isn't much choice and the portions were very small We had summer rolls and yellow tail tartar type of thing, although they were delicious, they could barely call appetizers at all.

We decided to have a glass of drinks first before heading to dinner at dos caminos.. Forgive me.. I really don't remember what I've ordered but it was something with guava.. It was slightly ""manly"" for me as I thought my guava drink will be sweet.. I love the ""earl grey"" thing that Erin ordered.. It reminds me of my favorite drink in one of the other speakeasies that I love going to..I have heard a lot of great things about pegu club..

It's the little dark glass door next to the rowdy Dos Caminos on houston street. Venture upstairs and find a dimly lit (basically pitch-black), long room with asian-inspired windows, lots of low lounge booths, and a trendy bar in the middle. Of course, the main attraction is the amazing cocktails. I highly recommend both the Earl Grey Gin MarTEAni ($14), which is an early grey infused gin with lemon and egg white. However, I replaced my egg white with grapefruit cooler--BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. So good. I also had a ""winter special"" gin martini with so many ingredients I didn't recognize. It was very strong but very, very good. You ca't go wrong with any of the drinks here. The bartenders are fantastic and really committed to making the perfect drink for you, so speak your mind.

I do not venture to cocktail bars that often as I don't normally need a perfectly well crafted libation. However, upon prompting from my friend who is a regular (the Duke on four-square) of this joint I decided to swing by again.While I wouldn't classify the venue as a speak easy, you probably wouldn't notice it just walking on Houston. But enter the door, proceed up the stairs and you're transformed into an intimate setting that has more than enough space for a weeknight. We parked at the bar, where our bartender quickly attended to us. Coming with said ""regular"" we had great service. Apparently, the guy was ranked the best bartender in New York by some magazine. I was very impressed with how much care he put into making the Gin Gin Mule. I'm sure he's made thousands of them throughout his career, but he put the utmost attention into it. I later found out the bartender was a former chemistry major at Rutgers (my alma-mater) so from chemicals to alcohol, not that far of a departure! The drink was very tasty and had just enough ginger flavor as not to overwhelm it. At $14.00 while not cheap, the price is reasonable for New York City.I would return here, though probably not every week like my friend:)",1,,

I think my body must finally agree with me on something: this finely crafted cocktail is too good to waste. Cuz sitting there amidst the noisy shadows and Asian-inspired decor, while you and your friends chat it up is cool, as long as you have another one (marteani, that is) on the way. And cuz it's nice to indulge in something you truly adore once in a while, even if you end up having five or six--betcha can't have just one drink here--and it puts you over your weekly budget.",1,3,

Some thought it was literally a club, and some thought it was a marked-up bar. Apparently it's a pretty chill lounge with an Asian twist. For those of you good with geography, it's a Burmese twist to be exact. Both their adventurous cocktails ( Poquito Picante) and classic ones (Manhattan) are all well executed. See the photos I posted.Among the group we tried at least 6 cocktails and i'd give 4 stars to all of them! It's more chill than you may expect. Had a blast thereFood option is limited.

162,VaVa V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1,5.0,3/13/2015,"I love the speakeasy vibe of this bar, from when you first enter. It has great loungey atmosphere and subtle and elegant decor. A real highlight are Sunday evenings especially when Glenn Crytzer's Pegu Club All Stars band plays insatiable live music, specifically hot jazz that feeds the soul. Mr. Crytzer tries to rotate the musician's roster to keep it fresh and dynamic. I get really excited for example when Jason Prover (of The Hot Sardines and Sneak Thievery Orchestra) sits in. You might see Mike Davis (an impeccably sartorial vintage-dressed musician), rockstar Dan Levinson (who has often played with Vince Giordano & His Nighthawks) and a new import from Denver, Ian Hutchinson who is a sassy bass player who is also becoming such a quick fixture in the hot jazz circuit. In fact I just saw Ian play with the legendary pianist Gordon Webster at the Rum House last night, also another fun joint.Going back to Glenn Cryzter - while you are enjoying the setting.....you might also notice that he often also plays original old-timey compositions as oppose to just big band standards or repeating his sets which is something to be greatly admired.[one can preview his music here too - glenncrytzer.com]Being able to unwind and dance to his music is a great way to cap the weekend. The bartenders are very knowledgeable, friendly and make delicious cocktails. I remember what great fun last year, when we celebrated a friend Stephanie's birthday and we jammed for her in a circle, while she had a balloon tied to her hand. That was adorable!When my friend Idalia came in from San Francisco, I took her there and we had a terrific time and even ran into Tamar Korn who is a phenomenal hot jazz singer (who used to sing with The Cangelosi Cards).Besides the cozy seating at the bar, there are also booths and lounge seating that affords all kinds of social interactions which is wonderful. And if you wanted more privacy on a date, you could retreat towards the back of the club.I highly recommend this club as an essential New York experience, especially on Sunday evenings with the bonus live music! Really can't go wrong with that if you are a hot jazz enthusiast and/or lindy hop dancer.",1,,2

It was a Duck something or other and one of the ingredients was SLJIVOVITZ! So of course I ordered that!It was GREAT! Very strong, but delicious. I had two. Loved the ambiance in here, its dark, the crowd is upscale and i didn't really know where I was going to end up that night, so I was a little under dressed in my ""nice"" sweater and combat boots. Ladies, this is the kind of place where that little black dress is perfect, fyi. The hostess completely forgot us at the bar, I did feel like I was waiting forever. We caught it when a pair that just arrived were getting seated before us. We pointed it out and the hostess seemed very genuinely apologetic about forgetting us and we were seated promptly. Otherwise the service was flawless. They checked on us regularly and remembered what we were drinking. It has none if the pretense and haughtiness that some of these ""speakeasy"" type places have, which is great as a novelty, but really after you've been to one or two the novelty wears off fast.

I've made it at home so I know what a pain in the butt process it is to make lime syrup, grapefruit syrup and infuse pisco with pineapple over 3 days.Needless to say, I was eager to revisit Pegu Club once again to have this magical libation. What ruined the experience though was the terribly inattentive service. My friend and I sat at the bar on a very quiet Monday night. We got our first round right away, but neither of the two bartenders bothered to ask us if we wanted a second. After waiting 30 minutes with empty glasses, we had to interrupt their conversation to ask for our check. They chatted for a bit more, and then gave us our check.

Very romantic ambiance so it's a perfect place for date night or a low-key girl's night out! For drinks, we tried their Earl grey marTEAnis, which were delicious! For food, we tried their scallop sliders and the squid. The squid was just ok as it didn't have too much flavor but the scallop sliders were amazing! Would definitely recommend this place and can't wait to go back.",1,1,1

181,Annie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,129,548,4.0,10/25/2014,"Great cocktail bar with an intimate and classy ambience. Drinks here are quite steep but that is already expected being in the location that it's in. I had the Pisco Punch and Mojito. Both were sweet but not potent enough for the price I'm paying for. However, if you're not satisfied with your drinks, the workers are very generous on switching it for you. Overall, this is a great place to grab drinks with a date. Will definitely return to indulge on their other cocktails!",2,1,1
182,Sheri Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,11,1,4.0,8/16/2015,"The bar itself is quite cool looking but the rest of the room has a sort of stark feel to it. I had the gin-gin mule, which was amazing. Nice crafted cocktails for the price in NYC!",,,
183,Jason C.,"Rockville, MD",338,493,782,5.0,7/23/2012,"Lots of times I want to scream in frustration when I visit a high end cocktail bar in NYC.  Every decent one has been publicized to death via every medium out there whether it be a magazine, the internet, or television.  Sometimes I clench my teeth and bear the raunchy tourist & yuppie crowd, the unbearable heat, the long waits, and the claustrophobia inducing environments just so I can have a good drink.Then comes Pegu, a place that serves fantastic cocktails infused with high quality ingredients in a laid-back, upscale atmosphere with clients who are the polar opposite of the those found in the hipster scene.You don't have to make reservations, you don't have to wait 2.5 hrs on a weekend, you won't feel like you are being jam packed like a herd of animals in a barn.  I'm not rushed with a time limit for my table and I don't feel like I'm being pushed constantly by the server to drink more.  Add to the fact that the cocktails are 4.25+ star quality and you got yourself a winner.I love Pegu.  So far in Manhattan, this is the only upscale cocktail bar selling fantastic drinks where I can escape the busy city life and drink in peace.I had two drinks:1) Pegu Club - a classic drink of this joint which contains a well-balanced mix of gin, orange curaçao, and lime juice. It has a slight pinkish hue.  It's appropriately and not overly sweet....but deadly.2) Guava-based drink (can't remember what it was called).  It was ordered on the premise that it would be a fruity and sweet drink, but contrary to expectations, it was a bit on the dry side and had a strong tobacco smell permeating from the drink.  I loved it, but not my female companions.  Be cognizant of this fact when ordering this drink. I honestly felt it was an interesting combination as a fruity based strong tobacco smelling cocktail drink is not commonly served.Recently, the Pegu Club was rated the #2 best cocktail bar in NYC by Eater NY.  Hopefully, the increasing publicity of Pegu does not transform the atmosphere to that of its peers like Death & Co, PDT, and Angel's Share.  It would certainly be a shame to lose the one quality of Pegu that makes it so attractive.4.25* for drinks + 4.75* for atmosphere = 4.5* average",7,4,7
184,Shahida A.,"New York, NY",152,213,229,5.0,11/5/2015,Pegu Club has outstanding drinks and a dimly lit romantic atmosphere perfect for date night. We got a large couch all to ourselves and took our time relishing our yummy drinks and the great service we received.  Highly recommended!,2,1,1
185,Amit K.,"Clifton, NJ",2,736,0,4.0,7/31/2013,"Pretty large ""speakeasy"". Limited cocktail menu (compared to Angel Share),but the cocktails are great. They have perfected each cocktail they make.Good for a pre-dinner drink.",,,

I had the Earl Gray MarTEAni and i've been thinking about it ever since. So good. I don't actually remember the other cocktails I had, they were good as well but yum yum yum.I went on a weeknight and it wasn't busy at all, very quiet and a great place to meet someone for the first time or if you want to be able to chat!",4,2,2

188,Garima V.,"New York, NY",11,71,15,3.0,7/26/2015,I went there with my family for pre dinner drinks on a Saturday at about 8:30pm. I feel like this place was really great about five years ago. It's dingy and dusty and there was a big rip in the seat. I feel like the drinks could have been stronger and the service could have been better. I think the place was understaffed because it too a while to catch the waitresses attention each time,,,
189,Joanne B.,"San Diego, CA",1026,674,2504,4.0,10/15/2012,"My childhood friend (who now resides in NYC) turned me to Pegu Club as she provided me with her list of go to places on my recent trip to Manhattan.  When she said that her favorite mixologist works at this bar, then I figured that we should check it out while we were in town.We got there early enough in the evening before the late night crowd occupied the available seats.  Fortunately, our party of seven was able to secure the seating area in the very back for the two hours we were there.  Our cocktail server was very attentive as we went down the list of their cocktail menu of drinks to try out.  I had the cocktail that had apples & cucumber, it was pretty refreshing. I love the fact that this was a lounge where we could chill and not be required to purchase bottle service just to have a seat.  We found it comical with all the folks trying to open the restroom door for the guys.  It was a sliding door, but many guys thought it was a single stall restroom until we told them otherwise.  Oh well, when we sat where we did, you couldn't help but get a good laugh out of it.I'd definitely recommend Pegu Club if you're searching for a cozy lounge to relax with friends over a few cocktails.",2,,
190,Linh N.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,540,1462,4.0,8/8/2012,"The boyfriend likes a place that is a lounge, intimate, comfortable, has good service, pretty awesome drinks, and no lines. And that's what he got for his birthday.I decided on Pegu Club because of how similar it is to a speakeasy but doesn't really carry all that baggage of actually being a speakeasy. Located on the second floor, the vibe of Pegu was modern with a nice chic feeling. We got seated right away by the window, across from the bar itself and had comfortable cushioned couch chairs. We got 2 glasses of water right away which is pretty awesome in my books when I don't have to ask for one at a lounge.Tantris Sidecar and Whiskey Smash are delicious. Pegu Club Cocktail and Little Italy were a bit of a killer, really strong indeed. Great atmosphere and the waitresses were extremely attentive and does their job well. We also ordered a plate of deviled egg, I'm not a bit fan in general so I couldn't really enjoy it. The deviled egg does pack a lot of spice though.Definitely will return to try the other cocktails and also have the mixologists create one for my taste buds. Nice spot for a first date also!",2,,3
191,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,4.0,1/29/2013,"Great spot to meet up with a group of friends. I heard that Pegu is usually pretty crowded, but I guess we got lucky since it was freezing outside. My group of six was able to get a table without much issue. I would describe Pegu as a trendy lounge that has the speak-easy type mixologists. The drinks here are strong and well made. I had the Manhattan and Whiskey Smash - both were superb. If you're looking for something more clubby with dancing, then I wouldn't recommend Pegu. But if you're looking to have conversations over drinks to catch-up with friends, then Pegu is a prime choice. I will definitely be back!",1,,
192,Sebastian F.,"San Francisco, CA",504,1063,1242,4.0,5/20/2012,"Pegu Bar is one of my favorite lounges in New York. Stylish but not pretentious, friendly service, and yes, the drinks. The bartenders really know what they're doing and lucky you if you personally know one of them who pours you a shot or two for free. If you're on the unfortunate side of life like I am you'll easily end up paying $50 for two cocktails but hey, who cares if the crowd is great and you're just having a good time. Bring some $$$ and get lost in cocktail heaven.",4,3,4
193,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1573,657,1217,5.0,4/4/2012,"Heed my warning: Pegu Club may arouse your inner, erotic creature. (You): Go on...?Maybe it was the company. Maybe it was the music. Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was the fact that we were surrounded by sexy women on the prowl.... and we started discussing our preferences and fetishes. Wait, wait, I'm getting off track here.Allow me to break Pegu down for you based on my experience: Do you ever have one of those cliché New York City fantasies where you meet some mysterious man (or woman) at a mysterious bar and the entire atmosphere literally makes the whole evening a tense session of mind-stimulating foreplay? (Which then leads to the obvious resulting scenario...) Ok, so I didn't exactly meet up with a mysterious stranger for my evening at Pegu, but that is exactly the feeling I got while I was there. As some of my guy friends might say, this place has the potential to seal the deal. It has that vibe. That lavish, teasing, sensual encompassing vibe that makes you feel like you're a super model incognito. To me, the decor just oozes sexy confidence and from surveying the room, I could tell it was rubbing off on people. I know it was rubbing off on me.So now that I've probably warmed you up a little bit, let's focus on the most important reason why people come to Pegu: the drinks. For myself, I started off with a La Fluer de Paradis at the bar counter. Our bartender has somewhat of  a famous reputation for crafting delectable drinks according to your tastes and I was looking forward to trying what he chose for me. I was informed that my cocktail had been created using gin and La Germaine. Sweet like flowers, crisp, and strong without being bitingly so. I normally do not love gin based drinks but I found this to be a very pleasant surprise. Next at the suggestion of my alcoholic partner in crime for the evening, I chose the Earl Grey Martini. At this point we had scored a two person table on the far side that came with two plush chairs. Ah it felt so good to sit back, sip, and take in the scenery while engaging in inappropriate conversation with my compadre. The Earl Grey Martini is probably one of the more interesting drinks I've had in my lifetime. The top third of this drink is basically all foam and a small bit of orange peel. Just dive right in and slurp that head. You imagine it will taste like tea but it instead shocks you with a strong citrus flavor at first sip. The citrus flavor then transitions from sweet to the slight bitterness of Earl Grey and then to something more round and full in essence. I'm not quite sure what was all going on with my taste buds, but I liked it.By the way, I loved our waitress. She had a little Bettie Paige thing going on with her bangs and bold lipstick. Such a doll. She enthusiastically served our drinks the rest of the evening at our table. She basically cheered me on when I decided to step up my game and order two Old Fashioneds. Knock knock, I'm drunk! In hindsight, not the smartest decision I've made but it tasted so good and went down smoothly. I didn't gag at all like I normally do on whiskey! Impressive.The music definitely changed at one point to a beat I wanted to jump up and dance to (amongst other things). I remember being asked at one point why was I scratching the table slowly with my nails. I don't recall giving an answer and I'm sure as hell not going to give you one now. Watch out if you've been sitting down and have had 3-4 drinks as that first walk to the washroom to fix your lipstick can be quite a doozy. I can personally assure you, you are definitely getting your money's worth with your liquor.We decided to call it a night as my funds had run embarrassingly low and my friend was hungry for deliciously greasy noodles. Pegu ain't cheap but I bet you already knew that. While it wasn't really crowded when I entered around 8:30 on Friday night, the room had filled up immensely as we stumbled (and I do mean stumbled) out at 11.Pegu Club stands for the most part unmarked on the street, only betraying its presence with an emblem on its door that changes colors depending on the day. While not technically a speakeasy, there are no big signs or flashing neon lights to catch your eye. Sadly like some of the better things in life, it can be easily missed if you aren't looking for it. For those of us who know what we're looking for, we are lucky. With its incredible drinks, swanky decor and sexy aura, Pegu Club is surely an establishment you don't want to pass by.",22,21,23
194,Lee Y.,"New York, NY",163,25,0,5.0,11/7/2015,"My favorite cocktail bar in the city! In my personal opinion, pegu cocktails are better than employees only and not as crowded as them and NO LINES! Try the earl grey martini! Super good",1,1,1
195,Jessa B.,"Manhattan, NY",86,94,8,5.0,3/21/2015,Really love this place! It has such charm and the drinks are great. I took my parents here while they were in town (the love Bourbon Bars) and they loved it!!!! The Fleur de Paradis was yum!,,,
196,Christopher C.,"Denver, CO",425,1544,295,4.0,9/19/2012,"I thought the location of this place was kind of strange, but after you walk up stairs you really could be anywhere.After looking at the bar and menu this bar caters to Gin & Rye drinks which I love both. I think its due to what they were drinking before Prohibition and at the Pegu Club in Burma. ...I could be wrong.Anyway I had nice cocktail in the afternoon, that was super strong and I enjoyed till the end. This is a great place that is pretty central and where you can get a great cocktail.",1,1,1
197,Dian L.,"New York, NY",97,235,39,4.0,1/16/2015,"Shanghai Tang orientalist red lit windows line the wall. The tacky nods to P.F. Chang's and Tao are negligible because the rounded chairs that line the wall are intimate and this place is not huge like those restaurants but thin and classy. A light oak hewn bar and high orientalist shelves lined with vintage looking liquors candles and chotchkes. The bartender shakes drinks speedily. Young, professional, he asks how's she treatin ya. She is the Earl Grey Marteani, and has light earl grey and lemon flavor with egg froth on the top, tasting not too sweet, like a light tea cake.Over the course of the night I drink next to industry folks celebrating the bartender (Ricky's) wife's birthday. He mixes me a drink with notes of cilantro and generously provides me with a shot of whiskey to drink with the people and toast his wife. I feel like a friend. He engages in a brief but strengthening conversation with me where I bitch about my career and he recommends Yes Please (which resonates as I now am reading it) and with high fives, encouragement, and a champagne shot, I head off home on this Tuesday tipsy and feeling supported.",,,1
198,Rebecca C.,"New York, NY",284,323,7,5.0,10/6/2012,"Pricey but yummy! So it's worth it.I came here twice for separate friends' birthdays and it is the perfect setting for intimate conversation and drink swapping. It's also funny to muse about how Pegu sort of reminds us of 3rd Floor in Ktown but minus the snob factor and soju. (Although I do kind of like 3rd Floor)My friends loved the Honeydew-Absinthe drink, I enjoyed the Gin Gin Mule (I'm a gin girl), and the one with the chili pepper in it. An Earl Grey+egg white drink was ordered and it was quite the crowd pleaser.",1,,1
199,Laura G.,"Washington, DC",40,133,108,5.0,6/21/2012,"I'm going to do my best to emulate Pegu Club by keeping it simple.The drinks aren't cheap, but they are carefully crafted from high-quality elements. My favorites were the Gin-Gin Mule (gin, homemade ginger beer, mint and fresh lime juice) and the Whiskey Smash (whiskey, muddled lemons and mint, and simple syrup). I had a sip of the Tantris Sidecar that my girlfriend ordered, and it was perfectly executed. The vibe was upscale without being pretentious, perfect for casual and intimate conversation with my date without having to shout over music or other people. I actually wondered for a moment if we were in the right place as we walked up the stairs to the club since it was so quiet. I don't mind that one bit, since one of my versions of Hell involves some sort of Night at the Roxbury-style club and bro-dudes pounding Jägerbombs. We were there soon after it opened, so I can't speak to what it's like as the night goes on.Pegu Club isn't cheap, but it's damn good.",2,1,1
