I ordered the scrambled eggs on an everything bagel with havarti cheese and bacon. It was made to order, and fulfilled my bagel craving for the day. I also had an iced coffee with soy, that was incredibly bold (just how I like it)! Great customer service from all, especially from staff member Adrienne and one of the managers, Michael. What a great start to my New York vacation!",,,
1,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,4.0,5/21/2018,"Noticed this place while walking by recently and decided to stop in for brunch. There is no obvious sign so you kind of have to know that its there! There are a variety of yummy treats to choose from, we tried the chocolate chip loaf and it was pretty good! They had a bunch of pre-made foods which all looked good and fresh as well. The prices are really for what you get, I really enjoyed my BLT which came with a side Cole slaw and arugula salad thing, and it definitely filled me up! Its a cute clean spot near the park to stop for breakfast/brunch/a sweet treat.My only real complaint is that the staff was a bit standoffish. There are no drinks listed on the menu and when I asked if they had coffee they answered yes as though I was stupid for asking. They also gave us the end piece of the chocolate chip loaf we ordered, which was considerably smaller than the other pieces in the display. I will likely be back as the food was good and well priced, hopefully the staff is better next time.",1,1,1

Updated review","Yura has wonderful cookies but at $12.00 per off box, she is now cheating her customers even more by making their size 1/3 smaller. She thinks that her customers don't notice, but I do. Time to go to Citaraella who has excellent cookies. Being ripped of by this supposed socialist sucks.",,,
3,Niki C.,"Columbia, SC",2,27,59,5.0,10/19/2018,Great service and a good cappuccino for only $3! Fast and delicious! The mini cupcake was okay and satisfying but not worth the $2 for how small it is. Overall recommended.,,,
4,Kim G.,"New York, NY",132,329,986,3.0,6/12/2017,"I must say for an on the fly pick, this cafe/take out shop Yura is pretty awesome.  There is a massive amount of people that come in and out at breakfast and lunch, so be prepared for a line. They have the usual breakfast and lunch items with some great speciality foods. On this day we ordered a BEC on a roll it was hot and fresh with gruyere cheese oozing out. It was on a soft seeded roll. It was a great egg sandwich. We also got the Belgian waffles. They were good but def not as good as the sandwich! Also, coffee is decent. (292)",3,2,4
5,Jo L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,13,8,4.0,11/30/2017,Stopped by here for lunch since it was recommend by my doctor's office. Lovely place and the prepared food tastes great. But I found a slice of the fruit sticker label in my pear fennel salad which you see in the picture. I am sitting here at my desk sifting through the salad to see if there are anymore fruit stickers. Why? Because the salad is to damn good to throw out. And can't go back uptown to complain. Please be more careful prepping your food.,2,,

8,Tona C.,"Bronx, NY",3,16,29,4.0,4/5/2018,I would only give 4 starts because I haven't tried their lunch yet I usually get an hour break in the morning so I come here for a little treat once in a while to have their amazing pound cakes.

9,Michael P.,"New York, NY",246,250,11,4.0,12/15/2017,Nice interior and good baked goods. Had the coconut custard pie which was delicious.  Also had a cupcake which was stale but still decent and you can tell there are good ingredients here. The only thing is that it's a bit of an organizational mess and you never know where the line is and workers are running around and seem lost. Would come back for that coconut custard pie though.,1,,

13,Elizabeth W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,2.0,9/11/2018,"Perhaps trivial, but: They don't offer butter with their muffins, etc. Previously, it has been possible to ask for butter, and be given a small amount in a paper condiment cup. Today, I asked and was told it would cost 50 cents. That seemed petty, and I said never mind. I was there with a group of women who meet for breakfast every two weeks. The butter, added to an unpleasant experience of another in the group, caused us to plan to meet elsewhere in the future. PS. I had a fleeting fantasy of nipping in occasionally when passing to ask, ""Are you still charging 50 cents for butter?""",,,

High ceilings give the old bakery feel to the atmosphere. Employees are always helpful when I come in. They have prepared foods as well. Lots of items to take to work if you're on the go. I've never been disappointed. They've been in business a long time. They know how to get it right!!,27,13,25

17,Mabel A.,"Mount Pocono, PA",20,31,67,1.0,10/16/2017,Really disappointing! I don't usually complain but the attitude this morning and the lack of help when NO one took my order on the line and TWO cashiers weren't ringing no one. She couldn't extend her arm a foot to get me a muffin and she suggested I take a look at the menu when I was clear about what I wanted to order! So rude and unhelpful!

18,Dee G.,"Miami Beach, FL",3,41,10,2.0,5/25/2017,"I came here via the suggestion of a friend before going to the nearby gardens. The service at this place was putrid. We waited on line and got to the register to order, and they told us we were supposed to order while we were in line. Huh? No one approached us to take our order, and there was no sign or anything. They just told us to go to the back of the line and order. The women didn't even look up from their registers.When I got back to the registers, I complained there was no sign to let customers know to order while in line. The woman pointed to a small, faded chalk sign. I could barely read it. Anyway, waiting in line twice is not really cool with me, so I'll probably never be back. Croissant and chai latte were good, but service left a terrible taste in my mouth.",2,2,

Food was good and the space is nice and open, giving you a nice tranquil eating experience. The rest of their prepared food and sandwiches are also good. My only qualm is that they didn't have a toaster for the bagel I purchased and they don't have wifi so it's not a great place to do work. Anyway will probably eat here again if I pass by.",,,

Updated review","Renewing disappointment with Yura. Have gone a few times recently after a long happy boycott but my husband prefers convenience over principle so I gave it another chance. Still bad. Waited 10 minutes for a coffee, checking in occasionally, politely, gingerly---knowing how sensitive they are--greeted with sighs and eye rolls. Got the cappuccino and it was totally flat, no foam. Not life or death but selling poached salmon and pinwheels isn't rocket science either. Note it was not a peak busy time. Bye Felicia.",,,
22,Susan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,3.0,4/13/2018,"Most of these reviews belong to the Yura on 92nd which is now closed. It was a neighborhood institution.  As a customer since the day they opened, I have stopped at Yura on 92nd Street at least four times a week for many years.  I use their catering service for extended family dinners, kids parties, and entertaining.  I was excited to see see their new space a few blocks north on Madison.  But the wonderful neighborhood place Yura is gone.  Still have baked goods and soup. But very little prepared food. Now really trying to be a restaurant (their restaurant Square Meal was so much better).  Confusing line to order anything. Milk in coffee today was spoilt.  New manager is rude and condescending.  So disappointing.  A big loss for the neighborhood.",2,,
23,Caitlin P.,"Larchmont, NY",0,2,0,2.0,4/9/2018,Was so sad to find out that they moved and no longer have any of their prepared food.  Now it's just overpriced and average...nothing special.  And the new place is cold and harsh...no charm like the old one.  Really hope they realize how disappointed their customers are and bring back the prepared foods! Sigh.,1,,

26,Dana K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,3/25/2018,"I have been a serious fan of Yura's baking since first discovering her original location on Third Avenue, more than two decades ago.  Her's is one of the few bakeries I've found in NYC that reminds of me of the seriously delicious home-baked goods from my Connecticut childhood.  Favorites include the exceptional farm cake and blueberry muffins, fantastic pecan, pumpkin and apple pies, and delicious cakes.  I've always found the service to be friendly and think the prices are comparable to other better bakeries in NYC.  When I went by the 92nd Street location recently, I was so relieved the sign on the window announced their move a few blocks north, rather than the closing of yet another beloved institution, and wish them much success in their new space.",,,
27,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",169,571,866,4.0,8/21/2014,"Quite expensive so this is more of a once-every-few-months treat yourself kind of lunch/breakfast spot. Definitely could not afford coming more than that. But all the food is fresh and made daily.The baked goods are delicious. My all time favorite is the seasonal key lime pie. Huge slices prepackaged and one of the best I've ever tasted. The meringue on to it too did for. Lots of options, though, even if you're not into key lime pie... so it's always hard to leave Yura without some sort of dessert (great cookies too)!The sandwiches and salads are also excellent. I always tried to switch it up but the Lucas Chicken Salad was too good to pass on. The dressing...the best! Much too small a space and overrun with strollers to stay and eat so I recommend getting some lunch to go and walking over to Central Park for a lovely Yura picnic.",2,,
28,Catharine N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/29/2018,"What happened to Yura?? The old Yura on 92nd street was a well oiled machine. This new location on 94th is horrible. When you walk in, there is no line - you just go to anyone who looks free behind the counter. If you're lucky, there may be a print out of a stained menu nearby for you to look at. They no longer have most of the foods that made them so popular (turkey pinwheels, corn and barley salad, string beans with mushrooms, asian chicken wraps, lunch sets, etc.) There is no more prepared food. There is no more deli counter with various salads on display. Forget about picking something up quickly - you have to order everything from someone at the counter, then grab a seat and wait for someone to come out from the back yelling your name or order. I used to go to Yura on 92nd for a ham and cheese sandwich and end up buying $50 worth of food bc I would pick all the yummy looking things from the display. No possibility of them getting impromptu purchases now. Everyone in the neighborhood is complaining about how awful the new location is. They would be smart to get rid of most of their tables and bring back all the refrigerated displays. It's really too bad that they had to mess with what was a very good formula.",2,,

30,Matty O.,"Manhattan, NY",8,45,1,4.0,1/24/2018,"Yura on Madison is yet another spectacular spot for a quick bite. They are hopping in both the winter and summer. I have been here countless times and am never upset with what I get. There is one thing however that if I were the owner of Yura, I would change. Although Yura is a small ""company"", they should still manufacture their own PLASTIC GIFT CARDS. The paper receipt that they use is not only easily recreatable, but it is also a hassle for the cashier to calculate and rewrite the remaining balance on the ""card"". Other than that, their prices are worth the food you are buying. Also something to note is that the seating is limited and it is best to walk to the park or go home to enjoy your meal! :)",,,

We were planning on going their for our Christmas Apple pie but we stopped by this place and the pie did look really good. Almost same price as Two Little Red Hens just $6 cheaper. Regardless. We were hoping it tasted as great. Not even close. It tasted like a pie I could buy from Costco and it was way too sweet. I am sure they are great for other things, we wouldn't know, but I would not recommend their apple pie at all. Nobody ate their piece at the Christmas party , it was all left over. What a waste.

And had them cash before me and when I confronted her she told me I had to wait until she is finish with them..Huh??? I was there and by the register to pay you even had my muffins in your hand before they came in. Very disappointed as it is always recommended and a huge income to your establishment comes from my job .

At least once a month. I usually take 1-3 slices home with me to share with the family, but its like pulling teeth to find out what they have, how much is it, what does that name mean (chess pie is not obvious!) and any other questions. I've often been tempted to have breakfast there but the service is just so chilly I end up ordering a slice or two of pies and then walking on home and making breakfast myself. If the service picked up just a notch, this would be a 5 star review. It really does make that much of a difference.

My coffee was great--strong but not bitter. I also got an extra bagel for later (which was super fresh and fluffy), and also got a cream cheese brownie for later.

Head down the street one block to Eli's, better food, better selection and much better service.     I had been going to Yura's for over twenty years. I always ordered an egg sandwich, but with only one egg, instead of the usual two eggs, and the old manager discounted it $1.00 as I was getting less product, and they were doing less work. When I asked the new manager, Lia, for the same discount, she not only refused, but was insolent and surly. She said they did not make ""to order"" sandwiches, and when I tried to explain it was not a unique sandwich, just their regular egg sandwich with one less egg, she refused to accommodate me. More amazingly when  I asked what I would pay if i ordered a three egg sandwich, she replied, ""a dollar extra,"" and a four egg sandwich, I asked, ""two dollars more.""  ""But what if i want a one egg sandwich,"" I asked, ""same price as the two egg sandwich!"" she replied. So not only is she rude and insolent, she is an idiot it terms of dealing with longstanding customers and trying to accomodate  a reasonable request.     For the record, I went down the block to Eli's, ordered a one egg sandwich, asked the manager if he would discount $1.00 as I was getting less product and he answered, ""Of course, sir.""    So i will spend the next 20 years giving my business to Eli's,    Keep up the good work Lia.",6,2,1

Updated review","I have visitors in from out of town and my friend wanted a simple cup of coffee. I remember this place was bad from my first experience, but because she just wanted coffee and it was right across from my apartment, we decided to stop in really quick.Just what I thought. VERY VERY VERY RUDE customer service! My friend ordered her coffee, and was told it would be called when it was ready. We waited for a long time until finally we went up to the cashier and she says, ""You need to wait!"" Mean while, her coffee had been sitting there the WHOLE time.  When we told her that was her coffee sitting there, she grabbed the coffee and seemed very irritated with us.

I usually am questionable on buying pre-made sandwiches, but ever since I tried this one here I am hooked!

There's sitting inside, but there are only a couple of small tables. If you happen to catch one!Yura is great spot to have coffee and breakfast. The place is packed during the mornings and during lunch hour. There's always foot traffic inside, but it moves pretty fast. The crowd always changes throughout the day: You have your stroller moms, nannies, school kids, UES models, and late-day starters.

The chocolate chip scones are my weakness along with the cupcakes.",,,
56,Doreen L.,"Long Island, NY",282,605,36,2.0,3/23/2011,"They should rename this place Excessive on Madison. I get it.. we're on Madison Avenue, in the 90s, blah blah blah... but that doesn't excuse charging $8 for a whole sandwich called ""Chicken Picnic on a Bun."" Am I the only one who had to play a guessing game to figure out what was on the sandwich? Is there a list of ingredients anywhere, because I didn't see it! If I had known half of the stuff on there, I certainly wouldn't have gotten a whole sandwich (and spent $8 on it).To add insult to injury, I picked up a bottle of organic Plan Tea. When I got to the counter, the woman ringing me up had to ask her co-worker how much it cost. They both didn't seem sure, and I ended up paying $3 for it. Um, THREE DOLLARS for a 16 oz. bottle of tea? I can get a can of organic Fair Trade certified tea for $1.33 at the supermarket. Same thing, and it tastes better than the Plan Tea bottle of tea. Give me a break. As for the good side, I've had the coffee here as well - it's decently priced - and it was good. I also had a mini cheese danish, and it was yum, and only $1.50. For actual food, however, this place is just over the top. If you like wasting your money on overpriced, regular food, then by all means, go ahead. Otherwise, this is definitely a place to splurge only once in a while, and even then, don't expect anything all that spectacular.",3,2,

59,Melanie T.,"Manhattan, NY",27,332,225,5.0,1/30/2011,"I love the scones, so fluffy and buttery. You can choose from chocolate chip, raisin, and sometimes blueberry. The raisin scones are the best in my opinion.  They make good angel food cake too. This is one of the few places that sells it and it's not too sweet, light and airy. It comes either drizzled with lemon glaze or chocolate. I chose chocolate. The glaze is the sweetest part of the cake. The sandwiches were ridiculously small so I suggest skipping those. Go for the baked goods. Ok so I'm raising my rating, because I just tried their ""Cool Lime Pie"" which is basically key lime pie, any my oh my is it fantastic. Creamy, tangy, sweet, smooth, topped with thick layer of fluffy whipped cream. The slice is huge and soo amazing. It is a bit pricey, but oh so worth it! The Chicken Picnic sandwich is the best. It's fried chicken with huge lettuce leaves, lightly creamy coleslaw, and sweet tangy bread and butter pickles, served on a fluffy. When I come here for a quick bite for lunch I always get it. My other favorite sandwich is the mini mozzarella that comes on a soft herb roll with olive tapenade, creamy mozzarella, and fresh arugula and tomatoes. The combination of these elements make a delicious sandwich similar to caprese, but even better. The freshness of the ingredients and the flavor combination are what really sets this sandwich apart. I also recommend the Grilled Shrimp Lunchbox. Pricey, yes, worth it double yes. The lunchbox comes with grilled shrimp, a salad of corn and bulgur grains, mixed greens, potato salad, some poached vegetables, and a deviled egg. The deviled egg is amazing, luscious whipped filling with a nice hit of mustard. The corn in the corn salad is sweet, while the rice is just the right texture. I normally hate potato salad, but this one is amazing being very creamy and slightly tangy from pickled red onion. The shrimp have that nice charred flavor that you get from barbecuing. Everything you get at Yura is fresh and delicious. Love this place, highly recommended.",2,,

Updated review","I really don't like to write negative reviews because any business can have a bad day, but this establishment never seems to change!  I stopped going to Yura years ago because I got fed up with the rudeness of the staff.  But, a year ago, Yura  opened up a small coffee shop next to the larger corner store and the staff and manager were lovely, friendly, fast and helpful.  I was so excited to have a friendly coffee shop so close.  But, when that shop closed after the summer I thought I would give Yura on Madison another chance.  Well, as they say, a leopard can't change its spots.  The staff at this store remains brusque and rude. The food is OK, ( they sometimes have nice soups) but it can be very pricey.I think its worth going one block down the street and around the corner to Gina's La fornarina for coffee, pastries etc.  Higher quality and friendlier staff!",5,,

UGHhh trust fund baby alert literally. On the other hand, that blueberry banana cake they sell here is pretty dam scrumptious. It was the only thing that was reasonably priced. Tell me how they wanted to charge me 16.75 for a mesculin salad with 2 micro oz's of goat cheese on top of it. High way robberryyyy my man.  So inside I had to Scarface my got dam diet and pay 4 dollars for this dam cake that I'll probably get diabetes from after I wolf it down.

A small menu is available made-to-order.While it doesn't look like they actually make all the baked goods, the prepared foods seem to be made in house and are actually discounted if you come at the end of the day (I'm not sure about the specifics of the discount... it was just mumbled to me when I purchased food around 5:30). If they truly discount certain items at the end of the day, that's a rarity in the prepped foods business. Most stores don't make new things everyday. The quality of the food is rather high, but so are the prices. A couple of containers of food for dinner (starch, vegetable, protein) will most likely run you over $20.

Updated review","Sure it is expensive, but this place is such a great spot for breakfast and lunch.  It is busy, but I always find that a table opens up while I'm waiting for my order.  For lunch, grab a delicious chicken or turkey breast sandwich with lemon or chive mayo or one of their well made salads.  For breakfast, anything on the menu will satisfy.  The oatmeal is creamy and warm and comes with brown sugar and cream to add in if you'd like.  The egg sandwiches are delicious, especially if they still have one of their crusty rolls to serve them on.  The omelets and twice baked potatoes make you feel like you're getting more of a meal and are made to order so be prepared for a short wait- it is worth it!  I love this place and will miss it when I'm gone.

100,Tiffany T.,"New York, NY",32,230,2,4.0,11/23/2007,"Second review to follow up on the muffins Yura makes and sells at the Dishes counter in the food court in Grand Central Terminal.  Yura confused me at first since they don't have  a prominent sign for their storefront.  All I could find was the phrase ""On Madson"" discreetly placed on a window near the entrance to the right (the door to the left is for exiting).  Once you enter, you see a store that seems high-class and large due to its neutral colors, large windows, and high ceilings.  Bakery counter to your left and prepared foods such as salads/sandwiches/etc. to your right.  Of course, I went left.Yum!  I love the apple walnut and the raisin bran muffins.  The first has a very soft crumb and delicious apple chunks with crunchy walnuts throughout the muffin.  Great apple-spiced flavor.  The raisin bran, being of the bran family, is not as soft and not as sweet.  But I love the grain-flavor all the same.  Both of these and a banana-something muffin are sold at the Grand Central Terminal.  There are one or two other muffins that are sold at Yura's but not at Grand Central.  But I didn't think I would like them as much as the apple-walnut (e.g., corn muffin, black-out muffin).I did try their blackened salmon sandwich.  Pan-fried salmon, slaw marinated in something, tomato slices and lettuce on white sesame hamburger bun.  I liked the flavor but couldn't bring myself to eat the black part of the salmon...carcinogens!  For some reason, I was thinking it'd be grilled, not completely blackened on one side.  **Note that some time late in the day (evening?  Definitely around 7pm to 8pm) Yura has buy-one-get-one-free on certain sandwiches/salads/pastries.  And $3 min on credit cards.",3,,2
101,Jessica Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,68,1,3.0,1/3/2012,"Was disappointed to find that this place fell off since I was last here. My favorite part was the large selection of hot food byt the pound, which has been reduced to a small cold case with limited and less tasty selections. I also went the day after a holiday so maybe they didn't have time to make the awesome stuff (corn fritters! friend eggplant sandwiches mmm). Otherwise, a cute place to get a quick bite, just be prepared to shell out 15 bucks at least.",,,

104,Diana R.,"New York, NY",6,10,0,3.0,3/10/2009,"Yura is a neighborhood staple and only worth going to if you are nearby, in need of a quick fix.  I have been going to Yura since its inception and it has always been consistent.  For prepared lunch options all of the sandwiches are delicious, especially the Turkey Pinwheels (addictive!), the Roast Beef sandwich on a roll, and the simple ham and Swiss on a mini-baguette.  All of these options are prepared ahead of time and tend to sell out by mid-afternoon.  My mom has had Yura cater her events for many years and their food was always acceptable but nothing out of the ordinary.They also offer hot breakfasts made to order.  I recently ordered the french toast to go and it was disgusting.  It was mushy and undercooked, definitely not recommended.  My boyfriend ordered egg and bacon on a bagel and the bagel was tasteless.  Their desserts are delicious!  Their small vanilla cake is amazing, especially heated up later, and their crumble is super good as well.Some hits and misses, but if you are around you will probably be satisfied by what you eat.",1,,1

108,michelle s.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,1.0,3/23/2011,"Like Christine M, I also work in the neighborhood and have encountered nothing but rudeness and neglect from the irate, incompetent staff. Everyday I stop in for a large coffee and end up leaving in a completely terrible, angry mood because, for some reason, the cashiers find it impossible to sell me a coffee without giving me some kind of attitude. I get that they have to deal with a lot of obnoxious UES moms and kids, but they know I work in the area and still treat me terribly.And for those looking to splurge on this type of food(bland and overpriced), I would suggest going to Corner Cafe & Bakery just down the street at Madison and 89th street. They have EXACTLY the same food, desserts and drinks but a MUCH friendly staff who are willing to be pleasant.",1,,

Sure, it's not the cheapest place in the area, but to be fair, there are more excessive places that are not nearly as good. If you want cheap, run to the deli across Madison (is that still there?), but if you want delicious mini cupcakes, awesome roast beef sandwiches (fried onions!) and yummy butternut squash soups, Yura is bomb. Also, people watching at Yura is like seeing an issue of Town & Country unfold in real life, always a plus.",,,
110,Sean W.,"NY, NY",529,129,11,4.0,5/12/2011,"While I was working in the Upper East Side, most of the time I ate here and ordered a lunch box while on break. This is a pricy, but considering the area and the quality, what you pay is what you get. The salads and baked desserts are the items that shine at Yura's.  They are always made fresh and never disappoint in the taste department. My personal favorite salads I order are the ""corn and barley"" salad and the ""greek couscous"" salad. They also provided free sampling on their soups, which are pretty good as well, especially my favorite Gazpacho. The desserts are also worth mentioning, especially their apple crumble pie. So, if you want a good healthy lunch or splurge on a dessert in the Upper East Side, Yura's is the place. Plus its near Central Park, if you want to eat outdoors.",,,

115,Zoe P.,"New Haven, CT",166,742,17,4.0,8/7/2008,"Mmmmm...best soup ever! I'm probably biased in my review because I spent many a free period during High School running over to Yura to get something to eat. There are so many options for lunch or a snack: either one of their great boxed lunches (the chicken or bean rolls with broccoli, bean salad and their really amazing farro and corn salad are delicious!), sandwiches, soups or prepared foods (which they can heat up for you if you want - awesome!), and quite a few baked goods like cupcakes, huge cookies, brownies, slices of cake/pie, muffins/scones (so good - and so deadly)...it could be hard to choose at times!Sometimes the people who work there are really surly, but those are mostly the ones who either work the registers or take drink orders; basically the ones who deal with the most people throughout the day. The soup/prepared foods guys are really nice and friendly. There really isn't much room to sit, and the few tables are quickly taken the moment someone makes a move to leave. Better to not even try to get one, unless its pretty empty inside.",,,

Lots of nice places to get a coffee etc. I really wonder why the boss or owner allows these cashiers to act the way they  do. I also wonder why a simple request for skim milk is just ignored.  It is such a shame, but why put up with their crappy attitudes, just go elsewhere!",,,

The breakfast sandwiches are ok, but they must buy only a dozen rolls b/c they are always out by 10:00.  They used to serve some nice Italian brioches, but those have been replaced by mediocre croissants.  The quality is just one step above a corner deli -- the prices are in the stratosphere.",1,,2

Not the Magnolia breed at all, Yura's little cakes have lighter whipped frosting and much tastier stems. Plus, when you go there on a cupcake hunt, you can gather a bit of lunch at their decent deli of healthy items - now, you don't have to feel guilty about the sugar intake!
