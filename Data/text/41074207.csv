0,3,9/2/2018,219,1,"Chevy Chase, MD",William C.,1,5.0,27,"This place is the bomb.First of all, so many jazz clubs suffer from a layout that seems designed to provide the minimum sight line to the maximum number of people. Not so with smalls. You can see from anywhere! I was even lurking on the stairs for a bit, and still had a great view.Last I went, you can also get a can of PBR here to hit the drink minimum for $3! It's really nice not to be forced to overpay for some crappy drink like you will at many jazz/comedy clubs. All I ask is that they'd pick literally anything besides PBR. Rolling Rock, Busch Light, any bottom-shelf frat beer is better than PBR, which is the worst beer of all time. But for $3 I'll still drink one. Alright, I had two.I can't remember who I even saw here, but the music was top notch. I was literally there bobbing my head and tapping my feet, alone, at 2am, because my friends wanted to go home. Didn't feel out of place in the least. What a blast!",3
1,1,10/26/2018,1,1,"Scottsdale, AZ",Jakob M.,0,4.0,8,"If you love jazz you definitely must ... swing by (badumtss ... that was a bad one, I know). The Small Jazz Club is a pretty great place. The pros are a convenient location, a lovely setting and, most importantly, FANTASTIC jazz. The Dave Stoler quartet was there when we were there and they rocked the place ... simply amazing! The whole setting also gets you in the mood for some sweet jazz and the acoustics are fabulous. The Small Jazz Club also lives up to his name though; It is very small. That creates a homely and comfy environment but also means that the place is very crowded. I am German and have only been to European jazz clubs so maybe this is normal in NYC, but you do not get a spacious table for your own. You sit in benches like in a church or cinema which is not necessarily a disadvantage. It only means you should basically come for the jazz and for the jazz alone. If you look for a place to spend an evening full of conversation with your friends or family, do not go here. Go here if you are a fan of jazz and of live performances. Which leads me to another point; The entrance fee is 20 bucks plus one drink minimum. This does not seem overpriced for a New York jazz club but you should really like the music if you go. One set is only one hour and afterwards you need to pay another 20 or go.But nevertheless, some great jazz in a very nice place, even my mate, a total jazz novice, enjoyed himself, therefore the four stars.",
2,,9/21/2018,27,,"New York, NY",Alessa F.,0,4.0,23,"This is a no frills, laid-back place (jeans and t-shirts) with a cool, artistic vibe. No food, one drink minimum (including non-alcoholic). You can see the stage just fine from the back of the club (again, small place) so it doesn't matter where you sit. The cover charge seems to vary, I've noticed.The musicians here are amazing. This is the type of place where the act--not the person you came here with--is the main attraction. People who talk during sets will be glared at or outright hushed. If you want a place where you have some more freedom to talk while enjoying a show, the Blue Note may be more appropriate. This place is all about the music.",
3,,10/14/2018,113,,"Bethel, CT",George H.,2841,5.0,426,"We came here at 12:30 am. At first we were told they were full up, so would have to wait until the set was over and we could get in for the open night at 1:00 am, so we decided to wait. A couple of minutes later, the bouncer at the door told us, we could get in for 10 dollars and if we didn't like it, we could get our money back. So we managed to catch the end of that set, and heard them play 3 pieces. The band wrapped up and we stayed for open night, and they were just as good if not better, so we stayed on until 3:00 am being uplifted by the music and the enjoyment of the people around us immersed in the music as much as us, bathing in the improvisations and all the notes and the great acoustics of this little jazz bar in the basement! What a gem of a place!!!",
4,,8/7/2018,584,,"Brooklyn, NY",Mary P.,2549,5.0,1502,"I hate to tell but this jazz club is the best. I'm always jamming out here at midnight and later and if you stay for more than one show, the $20 admission doesn't seem that bad. They won't make you leave either but you may need to drink more. It's only a one drink minimum probably per show but I don't think they keep track after your one.Down the stairs into the dingy basement is a charming space which always has a good act. There is an artist there that has painted most of the decorative wall art and makes and sells his work during the shows. I almost bought the artists work but he was charging over a hundred for a unique marker drawn NYC map and I just can afford to impulse buy something like that. Well, maybe next time since I'm still thinking about it...If you're looking for classy and clean this isn't quite that. It's more classic and suave.",1
5,,6/16/2018,92,,"Seattle, WA",Bryan B.,987,4.0,391,"A totally unique and different experience.On a Monday night when many of the bars were closing early we ended up here with a few friends. There was a $10 cover, and it seemed to be ""open mic"" night as the musicians rotated throughout the evening.The inside has seating and standing options and is very intimate/close to the performers. The bartenders will encourage you to find a place to watch away from the bar as it blocks the view of others. However, the bartender will find you in your seat and keep your drink full!",1
6,,5/15/2018,159,,"Brooklyn, NY",Kaley R.,317,4.0,237,"I REALLY like this jazz club. The vibe and service is awesome. I've read mixed reviews on service, but there's one waitress taking drink orders for EVERYONE seated and bringing everyone menus and drinks, so she's got a lot going on. She was still really quick and attentive with us.Things you need to know:The venue is small and there will be a line. Get there early if you can to make sure you get a good seat (a seat with a back and not the benches...). We saw a show at 7:30, got there around 6:45 and there was a line of about 10-15 people already. You can pay with cash or card, but you'll get through quicker if you have cash.There's a one drink minimum, but you can get nonalcoholic. They have sodas, coffee, beers for around $5-$8, wine, and cocktails ($12-$14, I believe). Cocktails are pretty strong.Cover is $20, but on Saturday's the cover is only for one set rather than the whole night (I think the $20 cover gets you in for the entire night during the week and on Sundays).",3
7,,11/3/2018,0,1,"Queens, NY",L A.,0,1.0,3,"Despite the inherent ""cool"" and ""chill"" vibe of this small and intimate jazz club, the underlying service is not cool at all. In fact, the customer service is very rude. The language on the website regarding the admission fees is elusive and the phrase used for student discounts, ""at the discretion of the doorman"" is giving unclear and unfair notice to customers. The doorman in fact did not reference the club's own website correctly and then proceeded to blame said customer that they did not read the website carefully enough. I do not understand how one could even read the website carefully when the language noted above is highly untrustworthy in how unclear it is. If you are at all uncomfortable in small places, I do not recommend this place. You will not have a nice listening experience since you are sitting right on top of people and crammed in. If you are okay with such an atmosphere, then perhaps you will enjoy. The club brings in top names and amazing players, but the club itself is pretty traditional so be prepared for the players you might want to see in their cutting edge moments to pull back and play more traditionally. As said in other reviews, there is a one drink minimum and the menu is by no means extensive or sophisticated. The price you pay for one set - which is basically 1 hour - and let's hope the musicians are not reading the charts on the spot - is not terribly steep, but it is not cheap and you are basically sitting in a basement.",

9,,11/3/2018,11,,"San Jose, CA",John D.,0,5.0,12,"Arrived about 30 minutes before the late show, waited in a small line and got right in. A few people ahead of me paid the cover with a card (I thought I had read cash only at the door). Once you get in, people sort of scurry around to find a good seat (it can fill up quickly). I was alone, so I found a spot at the bar with a nice elevated view (and quick access to the bartender). Though the bar/wait staff has it down and offers very quick service, so the bench seating is also a great option. Overall, a great place to relax with some top-notch live jazz.",
10,,12/18/2017,426,,"Minneapolis, MN",Peter S.,269,4.0,114,"Smalls lives up to the reputation of being the more down-to-earth newer, up-and-coming version of the Vanguard. It is located in West Village, and the door is so small and unassuming you WILL miss it walking by, if it weren't for the small wooden tent sign on the sidewalk with the show times and artists listed. While waiting for my friend to show up I witnessed no less than 4 groups of people wandering around trying to find the place. The cover is $20/person, but there is pretty much an unspoken 1 drink minimum, as the bar waitress is UNRELENTING and you will feel real bad not getting at least a cup of coffee for $3. Beers start at $5 and go up from there. We went to the 7:30p show for the Jochen Rueckert Quartet, it was not yet fully packed, but most of the seats were full at 7:30pm. We had to sit at the rear benches without backs, which was not friendly to people with old or weak backs. As the night went on into the second set the crowd thickened, and came many folks who must have mistaken a jazz venue for just another village bar...unfortunately. Many in the front kept trying to ""shish"" them up, but to no avail. The musicians just kept their heads down and did their thing.On to the music...Jochen Rueckert is a German native drummer who composes for his own quartet. The music was post-bop modern, what I call NY jazz. They started off the first set with a bossa that was more bebop, and for the rest of the night they never looked back. The musicianship is stellar, as is most of the programming at Smalls. The group was enjoyable, but the saxophonist looked like he was pissed off most of the night. I guess that's just his game face. I thought, man he needs a different game face badly, as the rest of the band did not look pissed. They all looked like they were having fun, especially Jochen. Oh well. I am thrilled that a place like Smalls exists, is successful, and has ""made"" it, in no small part due to their online streaming platform that develops an online audience of raving fans for the venue itself. It is a business model that needs to be duplicated 100x across the country. It give jazz lovers hope that jazz is still alive, and that a new Vanguard is still possible in the internet/Spotify age. Save the folks that were lost and should have ended up hitting on girls in Washington Square instead (they lost one star for that), Smalls is the place to be. If you're a jazz lover, this is a pilgrimage, after you go to the Vanguard if you've never been.",2

13,1,8/9/2018,90,4,"Newark, NJ",Yasmine S.,0,1.0,6,"Absolutely horrible and rude customer service. I had an incident with this very rude bartender (who happened to be a white girl) in which she grabbed my hand and physically attacked me. Only because I picked a garnish (an olive) by mistake, that was sitting on the table. Mind you, in the west coast, Mexican and Mediterranean bars, they put olives, crackers and nuts, for people as taste. Apparently something that shouldn't be touched in any bars in NYC. When I asked the owner, Spike Wilner, to confront the employee for her utterly rude behavior, he simply shamed me in front of everyone and asked me if I was in a bar before and that if I touched the garnish on the table and if it was ok. But that was not the point! The bartender should've given me a notice or at least verbally communicated with me before touching my hand. Spike a self absorbed douche, who grew up in New York (!!), a city that is known for its diversity, mocked and shamed me in front of everyone if I was ever in a bar before?! So sad and embarrassing.My simple question for him: what if I was coming from a Muslim country and the bar scene was not my usual scene, therefore simply didn't know. Or if I was coming from a Mediterranean country where in the bars, they put olives, cracker and nuts on the table for people as taste. It is unfortunate that I have to give this place ""a"" star despite having so much respect, admiration and love for the musicians performing there and the place itself. My humble suggestion to any patron who passes by: Forget about drinking, dining and supporting anything but the music. It's a waste of your energy and money. Certainly, no one wants to encounter bunch of neurotics who do not care about the people and instead, looking for their own pockets like most of the places in Manhattan. And if they have to shame you with their inappropriate comments, and behaviors, they have absolutely no problem to do so!",2
14,,11/12/2018,0,,"San Francisco, CA",Paul S.,0,2.0,1,"Saw The Flail at Smalls over the weekend. The tunes were great, but the venue was truly disappointing.

I was with two friends who were not big fans of jazz, but they had an amazing first time experience at Smalls Jazz Club. The venue is quite small and fills up real quick and there was only one waitress and bartender taking care of all the drinks, so I received my drink later than I expected. Other than this, this is definitely such a wonderful experience and if you appreciate good live music, I highly recommend it!",1
16,,5/31/2018,145,,"Pittsburgh, PA",Po La R.,74,5.0,28,"Who can complain about Smalls? Excellent live jazz bar. Cover fee varies (i think?) and sometimes they event accept student discount, so if you are a student, bring a student id. It does not matter if you are from other states. And they don't take reservation here. It you want to have a good seating, get there by 7pm and wait for the door to open. There might be a long line depending on what day you go. Many times I visited, and their drinks never disappointed me. But if you sit in the front row (right in front of musicians) servers don't come as often, so be mindful.",

18,3,1/20/2018,394,1,"New York, NY",Edward W.,2735,4.0,1456,"I came on a Friday night and the John Marshall Quintet show was actually only 1 hour long. Online shows it's from 730pm to 10pm, but it's actually 2 separate shows when we went. 730pm-830pm and 9pm-10pm. You aren't allowed to stay for the second showing unless you pay $20, which is the cover for the first show. There is a one drink minimum. After the show, your ticket gets you into Mezzrow which is one block over. This place was extremely intimate if you can make it to the front. We arrived 30 minutes early and snagged front row seats so we could see all the musicians up close! By the time the show was ending, the place was absolutely packed to the back, which has standing room only. I definitely would not pay $20 if I couldn't be close to the front. This was my first jazz show in NYC and I had a blast. If you like jazz music, this is definitely the place to go. It wasn't loud at all to sit in the front so don't be shy and step right up!",4

21,3,11/28/2017,792,2,"New York, NY",Liz S.,1568,5.0,706,"Small's is a New York gem. It's a one-room, no frills spot in the West Village with a lot of history. This isn't a scene-y kind of place; the focus is on the music. I wouldn't count on talking too much or moving around.$20 cover gets you in for the whole night (at least, it did on a Sunday-- Fridays and Saturdays, I believe, are just for the set). We showed up about 30 minutes before a 7:30 pm show and were able to get a whole block of second row seats. Sounds like it's longer lines on Fridays and Saturdays.Drink prices are mixed. They have $5 ale on draft, pricier craft beers, and glasses of wine starting at $8. My boyfriend's whiskey sour was $13. I didn't hear anything about a one drink minimum.We were there to see the Marion Cowings Quartet. The show started relatively promptly, and after a bit of a rocky start, they were fantastic. I'm not big on live music, but I actually enjoyed this. I fear being bored by experimental jazz, but these were all tight, quick love songs anchored by lyrics with a little bit of free styling from each of the performers. Some serious talent here. Great banter too. They played for an hour straight, and we ducked out when they took a break.Smalls has made a small dent in my wariness of jazz. I would recommend it for those looking to dip their toe into New York's live music scene.",6

I saw reviews mentioning there was a cover charge entering but I went when there was about 30mins left to the set so, maybe it's waved for that? Small has a lot of seating but it's a little awkward if you get there late and need to maneuver around people. I would suggest coming here early, getting your drinks, and finding a seat. The drinks are well made and strong and the music they provide is phenomenal. I don't know of that many places in the city where you can experience live jazz all the time.

25,4,8/19/2017,5000,4,"New York, NY",Scott L.,4006,4.0,2295,"Here's a guide on what to expect and what to do while visiting Smalls.What to expect 1. Smalls is an older dive-ish basement venue that holds about 75 people in close quarters.  It's a mixed crowd of old and young, tourists and locals.2. Good Jazz.  My set was mostly soft easy ballads, with bass, piano, and xylophone.I good energy cleanser.3. The venue is in the Village with lots of other bars and restaurants.  So Sardines might be good before for a burger, or check out a fun gay bar after, like the show tune sing along bar Marie's Crisis.What to do1. Arrive early for a seat.  I arrived at 7:15 for the 7:30 show and there were open seats at the small bar, but most of the floor seating was taken.   When I went to the bathroom during the set, someone took my seat.  If you come later, or leave and come back, expect standing room only.2. You have to order a drink.  I had a rioja and a rose, both of which weren't that good.   They just didn't have any depth, or tasted like much at all.   This isn't a place where you really go for the drinks.  They served Bass for beer for example, and the scotch menu is pretty simple.  It kind of reminded me of a college bar - basic, comfortable and not too expensive.3. Come and go and make a night of it.My $20 ticket included the 7:30-10pm show at smalls and the 11pm show at their sister club down the street.  The 7:30 show had an intermission at 8:45pm and it seemed the crowd completely changed/turned over at intermission.  I came after work just to have a drink and hear some jazz so I left around 915.",13
26,,8/12/2018,1,,"Jersey City, NJ",Namratha R.,2,3.0,11,"Let me start with the positive - the music was very good. You are allowed to stay through sets. Constructive criticism - please know that your ticket does not buy you a seat. They oversell each show - which means that you probably have to stand in the area designated by them. The most disappointing was that they decided to close early on a Saturday night (published close time is 4am, they herded everyone out at 3:30am) - the person there told us that they get to close whenever they choose to. That left a really bad taste in my mouth. I don't expect to be treated that way in an establishment. Neither do I want to down my drinks. All in all, while I enjoyed the music, I prefer to frequent more professional establishments such as Blue Note, as my overall experience is much better there.",

The other night I ran out on the spur of the moment to see a woman I'd barely heard of and her band, and they happened to be superb as well.There's a white cat--I'm saying there's a friendly feline whose fur is white--and if you're lucky you might get a chair to sit on.

I attempted to get a drink at the bar twenty minutes after placing my order with the waitress, and the bartender told me to sit back down and wait for the server.

Cover is a bit hefty at $20 per set, where each set lasts around half an hour. The musicians are really fantastic; you can tell they really love playing and in front of an intimate crowd. Be aware that the focus definitely lies on the band - a few whispers here and there are doable, but for the most part people are listening to the music instead of conversing.

Just the right amount of lighting and great music. The bartender mixed up a good drink and I sat and listened to the soulful sounds.I will say what I was mostly surprised about was the mix crowd that was there.

Make sure you get there early because seating is not guaranteed. There are various tables around the stage, and then some communal benches and seats at the bar. If you're not lucky to grab one of those, you have to stand. We were super lucky to get a nice bench seat fairly close to the stage, but I think my experience would've been very different if I had to stand for the entire performance (i.e. I would've been pissed). Because the space is super small and intimate, you feel very close to the musicians and right in the middle of the action. The acoustics are great and I loved watching the performance in this kind of space. However, because it's still west village, and the cover is relatively cheap, the crowd was rowdier and less respectful (i.e. lots of talking during the performance) than at some other jazz venues.

When I walked in I immediately noticed it was a basement establishment. I have never been to a basement jazz club before. Cover was $20 for Saturday night. After paying and turning the corner I immediately noticed how packed the house was that night. Smalls is not a huge place and there were plenty of seats but you are in very close proximity to others. I was able to locate a seat when another couple left. I sat down and watched the young musicians on the stage. They were getting down to some funky jazz. The atmosphere was filled with young people, and old people from different ethnic backgrounds.

I could drink it, but it wasn't something I would order again. I then listened to a jazz trio play for about an hour. Just piano, bass, and drums.

With drinks, a night here might get a little pricey, but there are way more expensive jazz options in the city, and the musical experience was superb.

Came here on a Saturday night around 11 pm and was told by the host at the door that seating for the next show would start at 11:45 pm. We went somewhere else to grab a late night snack and got back to Smalls promptly around 11:40 pm, where we saw that a long line had already formed (big mistake on our parts). It moved quickly though and we were soon in after paying up a $20 cover charge each. Inside, the room is packed: there is a small space in the front for the performers and then rows of chairs/benches set up. When we got in, we had to squeeze in the back, where there was standing room only. Much to our surprise, more and more people kept squeezing in-around the bar, near the back, by the bathrooms-basically where there was any inch of space. Throughout 90% of the performance (we were lucky later on and grabbed seats after some people left halfway through the show), we had to constantly deal with the waitresses/waiters as well as basically everyone in the establishment it seemed squeezing past us to go to the kitchen or bathroom. For a $20 cover an a 1 drink minimum policy, I expected to at least be able to get enough personal space to enjoy the show. The fact that I couldn't really took away from the experience. The music itself was definitely high quality and the ambiance kind of took you back to an earlier era/different world. I just really wish it hadn't been so claustrophobic. In addition, I thought that the musicians could have been a bit more lively (especially during the improv sections), but maybe the band that night was going for a more soothing vibe. It seems like there's a way for you to get tickets ahead of time and thus grab seats instead of having to cram at the back.

I can't even describe in words the tone he used. So demeaning. It was a sad occurrence. And I find out he's the boss/manager! I'm in complete disbelief and am so grossed out.

They may not be as high-profile as acts at the Vanguard or Blue Note but the product is no less magnificent. Not to mention, Smalls is affordable- the cover is under 30 bucks and the drinks are relatively cheap. My only complaint would be, sometime it gets a little noisy in the back of the club where many musicians converse and hang out. I would recommend to anyone to sit right in the middle, you can really hear the sound of the band with great clarity.

This is a great little place to listen to some really fantastic jazz music.Normally, I try to avoid cover charges. This general rule doesn't apply when there is live music, and certainly doesn't apply when there is awesome live jazz to be heard. It's one thing to pay high priced cover charges to listen to newbies practice sessions, but this was quite the opposite. There were clear set lists, and the saxophone player even discussed the songs (briefly) in between. The place does get really packed, which can get a little tricky in the winter time when everyone starts off wearing thick winter coats and then start stripping down layers the second that they walk into the room. There is a cat wandering the area during the sets. I love animals, but could see the annoyance factor if you're allergic. Especially since cats always seem to know, and to gravitate towards you if you're allergic or just don't like them in general. All in all, very cool little place.

The ambiance is cozy. The music is great.I came to see a friend and his band[1] playing here this Monday. They were great,keeping the audience always engaged. It was one of those evenings when the music just carries you, and you want it to keep going.A few practical things:- The cover fee is the same, independently of whether you will be able to get a seat or not. If you want to get a seat, come early.- If you come alone, sit at the bar. Otherwise, try to get in front: there is no stage, and although the acoustics is great everywhere, some seats offer only partial view.- The Smalls Brew is actually not bad at all, and just $4/pint.

It's not as large, expensive or famous as some others nearby, but you can hear good local talent here.  It only seats around 60 or 70 people, so expect a tight fit.  We caught an early show and open jam with no cover, and the music was quite fine (until one tourist from Canada got up with his sax and was unable to count to four, which was a little embarrassing for both the players and the crowd.)  The lone bartender was doing a fine job of keeping up with the early crowd, and the happy hour drinks were very affordable. Best part of the evening was the very young pianist who was really amazing. I'm planning to come back to see what other talent is waiting to be discovered.",

I can buy a liter of the stuff from my local wine shop in Ft. Green for $32. A knob creek sour is $15. We paid $60 for 3 drinks. That's one thing that's always been weird to me. Jazz is SO EXPENSIVE. Cover charge plus two drink minimum? That's at least $30-$50 per person. And it's not fancy or anythingThe jazz is OK; slightly pretentious. I'm sure it changes every night.,6

143,,7/22/2015,26,,"Portland, OR",Jim K.,7,4.0,287,"I like this small little basement club. It was a fun place to visit for a night of Jazz. Intimate and close quarters make you feel like you're inside the music. Grab a seat first when you get in and the server will come to you. This will ensure that you've got the best seat. Drinks will come later. If you sit at the bar, they will require you to buy at least one drink (not water, mm-kay), so be prepared for that. So go, and enjoy the Jazz. If you leave (or even just want to step out) you'll need to wait in line to get in again for the second set. So don't leave unless you really need to step out.",1
144,,3/15/2015,2,,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Jessica F.,1,3.0,29,I came here for a friend's birthday who loves jazz.  This review is really based on the space & not the performers (who were very very good).  In a nutshell it's beyond cramped.  If you aren't lucky enough to be in the front of the line to grab a few seats you are forced to stand in the back or get scolded by the waiters who tell you to not block the aisle.  I understand they need the aisle to pass but when you cramp as many people into a tiny space as possible there really isn't anywhere to stand other than the aisle.  Luckily about halfway through the set a few people got up & I was able to sit down with my friends to listen to the remaining 15 minutes of the set.    I feel like it would be better to come on a weekday night when less crowded to really appreciate & enjoy the music but I probably wouldn't seek it out as a weekend spot.  Overall I gave it 3 stars due to the great performers and my friendly bartender. Heads up there is a $20.00 cover (for the saturday night set at least) but they take credit cards if you didn't have time to visit an ATM before the set.,4

149,5,1/24/2013,79,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Robert S.,23,5.0,134,"One of my favorite jazz venues in the city.For the first time visitor, don't blink, or you'll miss this little club, tucked in the basement in the midst of the bustling Village. Once you head downstairs, and your eyes adjust to the lack of light, you'll probably feast your eyes upon some of the best jazz the city has to offer. What I truly enjoy about Smalls is that one night, a big name musician/group could bless you with their presence, and the next will be headlined by someone you've never heard of - but chances are, they will be soon. Most recently I saw Pete Bernstein play solo here, and it was absolutely incredible. They also have a full bar, with friendly bar staff (ask for something with St. Germain!)In regard to those who complain about the cost of drinks, or the entrance fee:a) it's New York, almost everything is expensive, get used to it; andb) those fees cover skyrocketing New York rent, and supply musicians with a living. Perhaps as a jazz musician myself, I'm a bit biased, but it's super frustrating to  me when people complain about shelling out $20 so a musician can eat, whilst texting on a $300 iPhone and sipping on a $6 Frappuccino in a $100 pair of jeans. If the venue was a consistant amateur hour, that'd be a different story.If big clubs aren't your thing, or the Brad Mehldau show at the Vanguard is sold out, consider stopping at Smalls.",12
150,,10/22/2015,9,,"New York City, NY",Gijs L.,0,5.0,3,I had a great time at Smalls. Visited 2 gigs in one night. Make sure you check the schedule on forehand to make sure you see a whole show.,
151,,3/8/2013,59,,"New York, NY",Jason A.,0,5.0,10,"This place is exactly what I want out of a Jazz venue in Manhattan. It's small and intimate, has a full bar with a great happy hour 6 days a week (the times vary, but during the work week it's usually from 4pm-7pm). Every bartender I've ever had there was sweet, accommodating, and quick. For some reason the two beers they have on tap (Yuengling and Stella) always taste incredible compared to other places I've gotten them on draft. They also have a full espresso/coffee station.The live music is the reason anyone comes to what is essentially a basement with a bar, stage, and seating for about 40 people. During the happy hours they have a band playing and after their first set they have a jam session open to any musicians in the audience. If you bring your instrument or want to use their piano or drum set, all you need to do is get in the line-up and jump in when it's your turn. I seriously recommend this place if you're into jazz, or love hidden divey yet intimate gems. The drinks are strong, the happy hour prices are very reasonable, and there is never a cover for happy hour. After 7 or 8pm-ish they do have a $20 cover fee which is good for the entire evening (They usually have 3 evening sets and a late night jam session which has been known to last until 4am). If you pay the cover, you can come and go as you please all night, and since they don't serve food many people grab dinner nearby between sets.",5
152,,9/24/2015,0,,"Middletown, NJ",Angelo R.,0,5.0,22,now this is real jazz! Improv at its finest. I have gone for the 4:30 early saturday show a few times and have always left in awe of all the talent there is in this great city. One musician after the next goes up on stage and plays flawlessly.

Also, a lot of people take smoke breaks, so expect strong second-hand/third-hand smoking...

We paid the $20 cover and got right in. The place was packed but the manager told us there were some seats down front and we squeezed our way to the very front row where we sat right behind the piano player. We had a great close-up view of the entire group , and they started their first set just as we got comfortable. In a few minutes the waitress came over and took our drink orders. She came back right away with my Manhattan and my friend's daiquiri. I gave her my credit card and said we would run a tab. ( she never pressed us to have a second, so the tab only came to $20. )The musicians were all excellent and a delight to hear individually as well as together. I recorded a little of it with my cell phone and nobody seemed to mind. We had only intended to stay an hour or so, but two and a half hours later, when the band finally took a break, we were still there. The music was mesmerizing. I'm not a late night person, but I was wide awake the whole time. A thoroughly delightful evening.",9

166,5,3/2/2012,87,18,"New York, NY",Leo K.,6,5.0,198,"I thought this place would piss me off. Based on outward appearances, I figured I was going to another wannabe speakeasy where the patrons are forced to utter stupid codewords like 'bunny' to gain entrance and I have to deal with cheeseball bouncers who finally found a use for their poorly cut and oversized Dick Tracy suits. I also figured there was a good chance they wouldn't let me in since my idea of your typical ""jazz crowd"" is a group of people who think Asians haven't discovered music yet and are also all Kim Jong Il.Not at all the case here except for perhaps the Dick Tracy suits. The live music/jam sessions at Smalls are legit. Both the crowd and performers are diverse which makes this one of those rare places where you feel like people aren't interested in the scene and really are here to just enjoy the music and no bullshit banter. Biggest surprise of the night? Some skinny Asian kid wearing a paperboy hat, some tee stolen straight from a Chinese-owned 'trade company' in the LES, and $500 selvedge skinnies comes up and begins stretching and acting as if he's going to jam on the piano.This is early on in the evening so I figure this chump is posturing, hoping someone recognizes him from his YouTube video where he did a classical piano rendition of Skrillex's ""First of the Year (Equinox)"" that got ""over seventy-five-THOUSAND views.""Totally wrong though...after about two more minutes of these weird zenmaster-like finger stretches, this kid taps a few keys before going into a full-on solo that had me thinking it was Yo Yo Ma gone 'rexic (because a cello and the piano are the same thing).Amazing. I'll be back.",7
167,2,1/5/2014,0,13,"New York, NY",Rob K.,1,1.0,23,"Never ever again.I bought two tickets to Smalls for New Year's Eve via PayPal.  We went to the show last New Year's and had a nice time, though last year it was only $50 and this year it was $100.  Ah, well, the owners Spike and Mitch seemed like good guys, the music was decent, and it felt like supporting a homespun jazz show in a community theater basement, which is basically what Smalls is.  So my wife and I headed to dinner at John's on 12th St. before the show. A real old school NYC evening!  But about 15 min into dinner, my wife looked pale and wasn't feeling well.  She said she didn't think she was gonna make it til 12am...she wanted to go home and skip Smalls.No prob I figured; I'd just call Smalls and tell them to sell my seats to anyone who walks in looking for a table.  They'd sold out the show.  Last year, WE were the couple looking to get in without reservations, and Mitch at the door told us, ""Just hang out, there are always no-shows and you can buy their seats"".  Sure enough, there was a no-show and we got in.  There were other people waiting outside to see if they could get in...pretty sure we saw a couple of them inside later too.This year, I figured the same scenario would play out.  So I googled Smalls' phone #.  Hmm.  Slight problem.  They don't seem to have a phone.  Fine, I'd just hop a cab over there and work it out. Time: 8:00pm.As I arrived, there were already 4 people outside. I asked if everyone had tickets, because my wife was sick and we weren't coming to the show.  They all had tickets, & they all expressed their condolences for my queasy wife.  The 1st guy in line said ""Mitch is right inside the door, just talk to him.""  So I told Mitch my situation. I asked him if I should just hang around and try to sell my tickets.  He said, ""Don't worry about it, there are always stragglers who will take your tickets, and I'm sure Spike will just mail you a refund check or something.""  I told him we were those very stragglers last year and he nodded.  I reiterated that I was happy to stay and make sure my seats were sold, and that I wanted to make sure I wouldn't be out $200.  He assured me ""We aren't that kind of place"".  I said I would email Spike, and that a PayPal refund would be all that was needed.  Mitch wrote something to the effect of ""Can't attend"" next to my name on the guest list, and I went home, to attend to my ill wife.On the way home in the cab, I emailed Spike and let him know what went down and that I had spoken to Mitch.  Time: 8:30pm, 12/31.By January 3rd, I had no reply from Spike via email.  So I forwarded my 12/31 email and said I'd look forward to his reply. 12 hrs later, he wrote back with a terse one line reply... ""Our policy was that there are no more refunds after the 27th of December.  I can offer you a 50% refund if you like.""Ok, I get it I thought...he just thinks I was a no-show. He hadn't talked to Mitch like I thought he might have by now.  I wrote back, detailing how I'd actually come to the bar and inquired as to reselling my seats, and was told (by his partner of 20 years) that it wouldn't be a problem, no need to stay, we aren't that kind of place, etc.7 hrs later, no reply.  Hmm.  Ok, I wonder what PayPal thinks about this.  I called them. They say, sorry, if the payment was for intangible goods (e.g. seats at a jazz show), I will most likely be out of luck.  But the PayPal guy says, ""Your argument is reasonable.  Let me call this guy and see what he says.""  He puts me on hold.  He comes back and says in so many words, ""The invoice you paid says no refunds, and the owner is sticking to that, but he will give you back 50%.  He says the Mitch person was not authorized to promise a refund.""Ok, this is officially getting frustrating. I emailed Spike again.  I asked him if he really thought this was a good way to start off the new year, given that I was told by his partner ""they weren't that kind of place"", and that if he didn't see it as wrong, then I would be forced to take it to the next level (a bank dispute).A few more emails went back and forth, with Spike getting ever uglier, calling me ""pathetic"" and a ""jackass"", at one point even saying ""F*CK YOU"" and banning me from Smalls for life (as if I would ever dream of setting foot back there..lol).  If the guy had been civil from the start, I would have accepted his offer, even though I had zero reason to believe that my seats weren't resold, despite his claims.  But his stance was cold and aggressive throughout our exchange.  Finally I called PayPal again and spoke to a supervisor who told me she couldn't change PayPal's policy on intangible goods, but that she was sorry I had to deal with this, and offered to match Spike's ""generous"" $100 refund with $100 of PayPal's own money. I have never dealt with anyone quite so obstinate and unreasonable as Spike Wilner, and fortunately I will never deal with him again.",25

I'm used to this sort of thing going to concerts, but I wasn't really expecting it for a jazz club (or for the steep cover charge of $20).Eventually I found a seat and was able to actually see the musicians, and after that it was great fun.

Small's was instrumental in me moving to NYC.Small's is named after a musician but it could easily be named after the size of the venue. Couldnt hold more than 50 people if they tried. It is very subtly marked. Drinks are expensive and nothing special. The music starts early and goes all night. There is a flat $20 cover for the whole night, with re-entry. For the best value, start your night off here, go to dinner, and end it at small's as well. This bar give a feeling of the heyday of jazz, before it became commonplace for acts to have huge concert shows. Even the people seem like they came out of the same period.My experience? Well, I'm glad you asked. It was a cold, February night when I made a mile walk to get here (this Cali boy had no idea that we could/should take a cab). We finally made it for the start of the late night session. After some real superstars jumped on stage (Victor Goines was the most notable) and played a few songs, Wynton (yes, of the Marsalis family) joined in. After playing 1.5 sets, the show was over. It was fantastic. Being such a small venue meant everything was intimate. I was even able to have a quick conversation with the artists!I have been back many a nights since that cold February night and I have never been dissapointed. It has yet to be as star studded but the acts are always lively and talented. You come here not to talk, but to experience and listen.

The first show was mediocre but the second show was AWESOME (10:30 set). Try to stay for the earlier set and the 10:30 set if you can! Oh also at the Vanguard they basically kick you out after the set you are there to see while you can stay all night at Smalls for the same cover.",5
179,4,8/7/2013,2,,"Ventura County, CA",Cheyenne C.,0,5.0,23,"My intent while visiting NYC for the first time was to visit a jazz club to hear jazz music played live by a cool band. I had intended to go to The Bluenote, Birdland and/or to the Village Vanguard.  The problem with these venues was that one would have to purchase tickets online, AHEAD of time if one wanted to see any of the bands. Of course, without a printer, one could not print the tickets. However, Small's Jazz Club is a jazz club where one can spontaneously go to listen to live jazz music without having to buy tickets.  This intimate venue is set up the way a true jazz club is set up...downstairs in the basement, without having to buy tickets and just paying the cover charge (plus a 1 drink minimum.) Of course, the place is small (hence the name) and literally, it is on a first come, first serve basis if you want to sit down.  Suffice to say, the music is fantastic (hard core jazz all the way - first a trio and then a brass band when I visited!) I highly recommend visiting this exciting place!  It is a must if you are a jazz lover!!  Be sure to pet the house cat ""Meeno"" (so cute,) when there and check out Robert Kendall's art work (he sketches all the jazz musicians that play there every night!)  Visiting Small's Jazz Club has been one of the highlights of my NYC trip!!",7

""$20 covers you for the night.""You then head to the next staircase that leads you into a basement lined with faded carpets covering many cables & dusty mirrors and paintings most likely covering damaged exposed brick walls.  People fill the uneven rows of sporadic creaking wooden chairs & old cafeteria folding seats, all facing the end of the room.  Each person trying to peer around basement support beams to catch a view of the action. Along your right as you squeeze past the crowd to find an open spot, the bartender greets you from her side of a poorly lit bar.  ""What can I get you?"" After making your selection of both drink & seat, your attention is grabbed by the grand piano, the classic stand up bass, the unspectacular drum kit, it's all there, waiting.The musicians take there place, and with the first strokes of the keys, the plucks of the base, the first time the brushes hit the drums, you know this is where Jazz was made to be played.Intimate isn't the word for this jazz club, perhaps the name fits it best, Smalls.  The 7:30 show was packed so tight we were nervous to head to the bathroom, thinking our seat would be gone when we returned.  And somehow they crammed even more people in for the 10pm show.For $20 we were treated to a nice show from the 3 piece plus a charismatic aging jazz singer, drink costs were average & not required.  They played 2 excellent sets & did meet & greets right after.  The next act was probably better as they replaced the vocals with the sultry sounds of the sax. The vibe was obviously cool & relaxed throughout the night as the band set the tone.Wrap Up;Easily one of my new favorite places.",1

If you're looking for a place to just come have a beer, move along. If you're looking for New York City's best Jazz, welcome home. Great atmosphere, great selection of scotch, superb musicians. I have never been disappointed. Very few Jazz venues in this city come close to hosting such and incredible blend of talent.",1
182,,11/18/2014,0,,"Alhambra, CA",Ralph R.,0,3.0,8,This place was ok. Went here in June 2013. I think it was Spike or Mitch's birthday so he had his friends playing all night. After the first hour the music all sounded repetitive. It was almost like they all learned the same song and took turns playing it. This bar is very hipster. It was small and crowded and there were PBR cans on every table. I don't remember paying $20 to get in. I think that would have been way too much for this place.,

The atmosphere is very friendly and artistic. It's always pleasure to be around those people. The place is very small and it's very good because you can feel like a part of the show. A good place to make a friends. My favorite thing is a jam sessions which happens every night after 1am. It's really cool! I highly recommend this place!,

It was Happy Hour Solo Piano with Spike Wilner, and he played some piano pieces from before the 50s. The space was cute, and everyone was quiet just listening to the piano. The bartender was very nice and the drinks were quite delicious as well.",

I'd recommend this to locals and visitors alike. If the music is good enough, you'll leave with a better outlook than with which you came.",

It feels like a secret magical cave. Nothing here changes. The manager is still a wonderful character, collecting money at the door, making wise cracks. You still meet tons of characters from another time. You still get into a lot of trouble if you're looking for it. I started coming here when I was a teenager because back then it was BYOB. They closed down for a while and then opened again with a full bar. In a way, we transformed together since I had my 21st birthday party here. I'll never forget that night, the bar tab from which is still the largest I've ever racked up! We closed the place down and then partied with the musicians and staff.",

The room was quickly packed and people continually streamed in to the wee hours. A lot of people had to stand for the whole night. And they didn't care.The musicians were  superb. I couldn't last through the whole evening, for there was too much to absorb.Drinks are normally priced. The cover of $20 is more than worth it. I will come back soon.",1

A very casual atmosphere, fantastic musicians - occasionally with some surprise players - We got to see Johnny O'neil play piano, it was fantastic.
