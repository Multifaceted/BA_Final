The space outside is really pretty. The food is OK, drinks are average too - not too much excitement here with food quality overall. I think this is a good spot for a drink but not for dinner or finger food. I'll be back to check out the space when it's less crowded to give a different assessment and at that time will update my review if I see any need for an adjustment to be made.",1,1,2
2,Tesi Z.,"Miami, FL",470,6,1,1.0,9/22/2018,This place was weird with service and the margaritas suck ass. There was like no lime juice in the margs and then we swamped them out for beer and they charged us the same price as the margs for the beers. Not a fun vibe.,1,1,
3,Zenda D.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",201,131,173,3.0,4/28/2018,Came here w/ my bestie and co workers for happy hour. The spot has two floors and the upstairs is cool. The happy hour is really good I loved the margarita's I stuck to on the rocks.  I think it has more of a kick to it than the frozen margarita.I didn't get to try the food it smelled like regular bar food wasn't too appealing. I might come back for happy hour but I might just go to calico jacks or mcfaddens has a cooler vibe.,1,,2

The bartender was really nice and thoughtful. One of our friends was getting pretty drunk, nothing reckless, just not being able to stand up straight. I kept asking the bartender to just keep giving him water and he was really helpful with it. Anyway, besides my drunk coworker, the drinks were only mediocre. I got a pitcher of red sangria and shared it with one of my friends. It tasted like flavored water so was kind of disappointed. Hopefully I can go back again and give it another try when it's not so packed!",,,

We have been large parties both times, think 80 the first time and 40 the second. The first time we were in the 2nd level and we had the whole floor to ourselves, the 2nd time we were in the garden area but it is winter so they have tented it off and it is heated. The service is amazing. Everyone we dealt with on both occasions was super friendly and accessible. The drinks were offered quickly and kept coming. They really took care of us. We ordered only appetizers for food but everything was excellent bar food. Not sure how amazing you can make a mozzarella stick or a baked potato skin but these were right up there with what you would hope for. Highly recommended!

The floppy and unsalted fries, not so much. My girlfriend had the OMG Wings, which she described as just ""O"" no MG. STAFF:The staff was great and friendly, but sparse.

There's a nice garden patio in the back with wooden picnic tables - which is the best part of this bar in my opinion. I've never seen it overly crowded. They have happy hours everyday ($5 beers $6 wines $5 shots) and $1 oysters. Drinks are $8-$12 normally. I enjoyed the Guinness - the waitress poured it the correct way like how they do in Ireland. However, their sangrias are watered down.Food is only okay - simple bar and brunch food. They have chips and dips, sandwiches, wings, and omelets for brunch.  I came once to get their $1 oysters - but they were completely out of oysters Saturday morning at 11am, even though they had a sign outside that says ""$1"". How deceiving.  Minus one star. Overall, a decent place to grab a drink and catch up with friends. The Garden Patio in the back is unique and a great space to get together.",1,1,
23,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,7/7/2017,"Tuttles is a no-frills, backyard-sporting, bar-focused spot in Midtown East. I don't know if I'd ever have went if it weren't for the nice weather and outdoor seating, though they do have a solid happy hour. I'm not sure if I would order $1 oysters from this place, but there are cheap beers and a few other discounted items.There are 3 parts to Tuttles - indoor, quasi-outdoor, and totally-outdoor. The indoor is nothing special at best. The quasi-outdoor area has an open-air feel and connects with the totally-outdoor part. It has a roof and is a bit dark so you're not going to enjoy some sun or feel a crisp summer-beating breeze. The totally-outdoor area is the place to be. There are a few long picnic tables providing a majority of the seating. It's definitely the place to be. The food menu contains your typical fare, but we only stayed for drinks.P.S.

24,Alexandra J.,"Ridgewood, NJ",46,4,0,1.0,6/30/2017,"Worst experience at a restaurant in my life. Went here for my sister in laws birthday. The venue itself is beautiful. Outdoor seating, hanging plants, and pretty lighting. However it took the waitress twenty minutes to even ask us for our drink options. The restaurant was barely crowded as it was 6pm and a little early for New York dinner rush. We ordered Sangria which took another 20 minutes to reach the table and when it did it was not accompanied by any glasses! We had to wait another ten minutes while our sangria sat on the table. Finally I had to get up and ASK for drinking glasses.We ordered appetizers and the appetizer plates were dirty. Once again had to get up and when I gave the plates back it took another twenty minutes to get clean ones. The waitress barely came around and her incompetence was unbearable at this point in the evening. The food was  reasonably good, typical seafood and bar food. However, make matters worse the owner and his friend were feeding drinks to a  much younger girl at an empty back room and many of us found this unsettling. When he noticed we noticed he bought us shots and started to scowl and tell us to mind our business. Needless to say it was disturbing and bizarre behavior for an owner to act this way. I wouldn't recommend this place for a variety of reasons, most of all the service and way customers are treated.",2,,

Otherwise, it was tasty and didn't need salt or ketchup.Also ordered calamari which was delicious. Not rubbery. However, cut into real thin rings. Guess it's good because batter covers more surface.

I do have to say my friends and I, a group of eight, we're disgusted by seeing the owner and an older gentleman(45+ at least) sticking their tongues down a young girl throat.  She is beyond drunk and it's really uncomfortable and really concerning to see this. Some of my friends confronted them and they just smiled in return, not seeing how sleazy they are. Other tables are clearly noticing that but don't know if they're in the position to say anything. We asked one a worker and he said if he approached them He would get punched in the face. It's a Saturday and a lot of people aren't in their best mindset, yet it's almost midnight and they all see how this is predator going after prey.

Recently had their larger strip steak -it was gristley and small, thin. I found it unreasonable to charge $10 for a Goose Island draft (owned by budweiser). The good points are cheap oysters and a brilliant garden during the warm months.

Our server said he we would be back to take our drink order, however he didn't return for 25 minutes, which is inexcusable. We were only a party of 4 however it seemed too much for this server who although took our drink orders okay, confused our food order even though we pretty much ordered all starters with the exception of 1 item.

Though, it's a bit pricey and I've found service to be abysmally slow across three distinct trips here. I don't know why, but getting refills on 3 beers/drinks often takes 5-10 minutes, regardless if it's at all busy. I'm left feeling that we are paying a premium strictly for the outdoor area. Without that piece, I would not ever come. There is a happy hour of $5 beers and $6 wines, but you're paying $5 for a bottle of watery beer. Big deal.Worth it if you work/live in midtown east and need variety from your normal places. Otherwise, pass on to Pod 39 or Rio Grande for some outdoor time.",1,,

Updated review","SO disappointing to come in to Tuttles after work and order a couple of brews (as I've down countless times before) and discover they've raised their beer prices to TEN DOLLARS upon receiving the check. Listen, they can get away with it. This place is always packed and has the best beer garden in midtown. But to raise your beer prices to $10 is an insult to anyone that routinely visits your bar.  I love this place. Came the first week it opened, and almost every week after that. Always push it for after work happy hours. Recommend it to everyone for dates, food, whatever. Sorry Tuttles... but you can get cheaper beers from nightclubs in meat packing. Will NOT be suggesting Tuttles as an after work happy hour spot anymore.",3,1,
49,Erin S.,"Manhattan, NY",62,108,5,4.0,6/27/2016,"What appears to be a standard dive bar from the outside morphs into a beautiful outdoor garden/patio once you come through the back. It's massive and a great spot to come for drinks/food with a group, and probably the lowest prices you will find at such a big outdoor space in New York. While the menu was pretty standard bar food, it was actually surprisingly good, particularly the fish tacos and the empanada of the day. Also recommend the sangria- a pitcher was only $33, and was enough for 2.5 glasses each for 3 people. Losing a star only because the service was pretty slow- the waitress was kind of just standing around waiting until a table would call out to her. But, I am pretty sure she was European so let's just blame that on the difference in restaurant cultures.",1,,
50,Flynn T.,"Washington, UT",0,1,0,1.0,9/20/2017,"This place is a total scam. The menu said $12.00 for a burger  that was supposed to include fries.  The place charges you for fries, cheese on your burger, and for every refill on your sodas.

51,Alexis C.,"San Francisco, CA",531,22,285,3.0,9/12/2015,"Came here for a girls night out of happy hour and dinner. The happy hour is great; $6 house wines and $5 beer on tap. They have an awesome outdoor courtyard, perfect for summer, where we were seated for dinner. Our service wasn't the best; our waitress didn't pay too much attention to detail so we had to flag her down a bunch of times (when we needed more water, when we were ready to order, needed the check, etc.) I definitely recommend the dollar oysters and the shared appetizer (it comes with calamari, guacamole, hummus, and skewers). You'll definitely get the most for your money with those two appetizers.Overall, we all loved the ambiance of the place, food was alright, but the service could have been better.

Expensive for what you get...the portions were kind of small and flavor so didn't really stand out as anything spectacular. Service was brusque, but at least it was quick and we could get out of there quickly.",,,
53,Mike L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,1,1.0,9/2/2017,They have a $20 minimum for their credit card payments so you can't just order 1 or 2 drinks there.

55,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,3.0,2/15/2015,"Quick poll for all of the gentleman readers out there: Have you ever ordered french toast at a restaurant? If you have, send me a note and show solidarity with my boyfriend, who ordered the Bailey's French Toast (Irish Cream Dipped French Bread, Mixed Berries, Apple-wood Smoked Bacon Strips & Maple Syrup) and got laughed at by the waitress. She also said, ""Awwww. I've never seen a man order french toast before."" ...I'm pretty sure guys order french toast all the time, right? And where's the line? Are they allowed to order waffles? Pancakes? How about if you call them flapjacks? What's an acceptable manly breakfast dish?Anyway, we thought it was a strange reaction. But I digress.We came in last weekend with a Living Social deal that was about to expire. We each got an entree and two adult beverages. I ordered the Eggs Benny (Two Poached Eggs with Scottish Salmon or Canadian Bacon served with Mixed Green Salad) with the salmon, along with a Bloody Mary and Vanilla Spiced Irish Coffee. The Eggs Benny was good-- about what you'd expect from the dish. The salmon tasted fresh enough, the poached eggs were cooked properly, and the Hollandaise was on point. The Bloody Mary was sub-par, however; they overdid it with the tomato juice. And the irish coffee was okay - a bunch of whipped cream on top followed by what just tasted like a blend of coffee and whiskey. I did have some of my bf's ""girly"" french toast and it was pretty good. Very sweet, though.The brunch atmosphere was also a bit uncomfortable. We were seated downstairs, and we were the only patrons in that room the entire time. There was a separate little enclave between the downstairs interior and the back patio where a few couples sat, and I gather that there were also people upstairs, but it was a bit awkward since it was just us and the staff hanging out in the room. I've been here for happy hour during the warmer months a few times, and it's a completely different vibe. The back patio is awesome and rather spacious, so under the right conditions, Tuttles can be an ideal place to visit if you happen to be in the Murry Hill neighborhood. But I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming here for brunch in the winter.",3,4,2

Then I ordered a cheeseburger and got a burger with bacon, onion ring and guacamole. I told the bartender it wasn't my order and he said that's how the burgers come so I ate it. When I got my check it was $16.50. I asked him why and he showed me the menu and I showed him the burger I ordered.

He went into the bathroom and came back out only to sit at the bar. Your bartender preceded to serve him more alcohol as me and my friend stared at her completely disturbed. We mentioned it her as we covered our noses from the vomit smell. Still no one did anything. Never have I experienced something like this. My friend and I were so disturbed we closed our checks to leave. Talk about ruining a night out.

I was actually glad it was quiet - everyone knows it's hard to find a peaceful, not too crowded place in the area!I had the Chef's burger, which was delicious and came perfectly cooked, topped with Guac, and an onion ring, along with crispy french fries, and a delicious German tap brew (the name of which escapes me).  The tap list has mostly the usual suspects, but was not bad.My waiter was very attentive, but not in any way obtrusive, which was nice for a single person taking their time, and I completely enjoyed my time there. I needed to relax after a stressful situation and this place hit it on the bulls eye.  What a great outdoor space!  And the inside areas are also a cut above the pubs in the area ambiance-wise with high ceilings, chandeliers, and open brick walls over a couple of levels.My waiter said M-F it's pretty packed, which I have seen, and believe, but happily, on the weekends, you get a smaller, local crowd.  That's when I would go.Recommended - good food, good service, good bar, and the best outdoor backyard in the area.",1,,

It's the main reason I would go back. This place has two levels and can get packed rather quickly. I have only been her on two different occasions. The first time I was with a small group of people, the benches where filled but not super crowded where we couldn't find a seat. The patio was beautifully lit and the chips with warm spinach dip was delicious. The second time I came here was on a Friday around 6pm and it was already so packed that it was hard finding a seat. My friend and I had to wait about 20minutes to even get a menu but when we finally did order, it was delicious. We just got potato skins which was cheesy goodness and a bacon filled delight. Then we had chips with guacamole which was addicting. Finally we had sliders which was was legendary. the bar selection was pretty decent and it's such a laid back atmosphere and a nice place to go on a date!",2,,2

Updated review","I came for lunch with a group. Literally there was only one other person in the place, but somehow the service was slower than I thought possible.  It took 15 minutes to seat us, 15 minutes for a menu, even longer for food.  We didn't even bother waiting for the check and instead walked up to the hostess and demanded it.  Plus, the waitress refused to believe that salads came with fries until we took a menu from another table and proved it to her.I would give this experience a single star, but I most admit that Tuttles servers great bar food.  I enjoyed a burger - cooked medium rare to perfection - as well as the sweet potato fries.  I'd consider coming back with a small group to sit at the bar again but definitely wouldn't recommend this place for a sit-down dinner.",2,,
109,Amber L.,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",47,114,8,4.0,8/28/2013,"I've been to Tuttles twice now, both times for brunch, and I can say that my time there has been both enjoyable and very strange. The first time I had brunch there, my boyfriend and I were looking at the brunch menu and we asked to see a drink menu. The waitress replied that they do not have a drink menu and we will have to go inside to look. She was super polite about it, it was just very bizarre. We ended up getting mimosas and she informed us later in the meal that one mimosa actually comes free with your brunch entree. Woo! Free drink!The second time, my boyfriend and I were waiting for the rest of our group to arrive and the waitress handed us a lunch menu. She said that they did not have a brunch menu but that they were serving brunch. She proceeded to recite all the brunch menu items. This was very odd. I felt bad that our group arrived in waves and she had to keep reciting the options so I tried to find their brunch menu online but to no avail. We later learned that all the brunch menus were in the manager's locked office and they could not get them out. WEIRD.ANYWAY. The service is definitely a bit strange. BUT I do keep coming back! The space is pretty incredible-- one of the nicest gardens I've found to eat at in Manhattan. The back garden has a bunch of picnic tables, some tucked away around the corner, and umbrellas for shade. The tables are surrounded by well tended plants (even some tomatoes!) so someone is definitely taking care of this place. The interior space seems very clean and modern as well and it's probably much busier at night. The area is always super quiet on Saturday mornings.Personally, I really like the food. Maybe I'm biased because their waffle dish comes with fresh berries and a scoop of ice cream. I'm a sucker for waffles that automatically come with ice cream. Naturally, that's the only dish I've gotten here. My boyfriend likes the pancakes. I will say that the menu is a bit limited (no eggs benedict!!). I basically have it memorized after last weekend and it's something to the effect of waffle, pancakes, steak and eggs, maybe a breakfast burrito or something like that, and a choose your own omelette option with some nice veggie choices. Their lunch menu actually looks really good too, it's much larger. They seem to have a great beer selection too but I'm not sure what this place is like in the evenings.The one really outstanding thing about this place is the value. Every brunch entree (except maybe the steak and eggs) is like $8-10 and comes with a free mimosa or bloody mary. Show me somewhere else in Manhattan where you can spend like $12 at brunch for an entree and cocktail (no, seriously, show me. I'd like to go).Long story short, Tuttles has an amazing garden, pretty good food, and great value but sometimes the service is a little weird. I think they only recently started serving brunch so that may be part of it. Definitely check it out if you like those food options and want to sit outside! Great for large groups!",3,1,
110,Morgan D.,"New York, NY",81,138,203,3.0,10/12/2015,"went here for brunch yesterday. couple of different thoughts:1) when i called to find out about tvs at the location (for sunday football) - the person on the phone said we could reserve a table and he would take care of us (which was awesome!) and we had a nice big table outside.2) when we sat down for brunch/lunch it was about 2pm. just as a heads up - they ONLY service brunch menus on Sunday and there's no negotiating for any of their lunch/dinner options. a bit of a bummer because i wasn't in the mood for eggs and wanted more of a lunch-based meal.3) the service was alright, our waitress was attentive and nice enough4) had a bloody mary - it was a little watery, ended up having mac and cheese - DELICIOUS and french fries, also pretty good.5) overall, food was good, service was OK, drinks were subpar.",,,

112,Shirley C.,"Queens, NY",66,60,161,3.0,9/19/2013,"This is a nice, cute bar with an outdoor garden that is great for the summer. They have bar food that is not exceptionally good or bad. We tried the fries, sliders and empanadas. The fries were huge potato wedges which I like but the sliders didn't leave much of an impression. They tasted like they just slapped some meat on the grill without any seasoning or spices. I guess that's fine if you're assuming your customers are going to be too drunk to appreciate a little salt and pepper. The drinks were tasty but they charge $11 for a draft beer. I know this is New York City but that is kind of steep for me. Maybe I'd enjoy this place more during their happy hour special which ends early at 7pm. Go if you work nearby and can get their happy hour specials because the environment is really cute and they'll have decent priced drinks.",2,,1

116,Jessica L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,6/21/2013,"I really want to love this place for the atmosphere BUT their service is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  I went for happy hour on a Friday.   It wasn't busy and there was an abundance of staff however no one came to our table for 10 minutes.   We had to ask for the menus, waited another 10 minutes to ask to have our orders taken.  The food came in a relatively decent time however the drinks never showed up.   We asked for the check twice, then was asked who our server was; to be honest it was a mystery because the person who took our order never came back to our table.   The bill included the drinks that were never served,  when asked about it the waiter asked do you want to take it off the bill. Yes I want it off my bill. I'm not going to pay for something I didn't have. Seriously wish the service was better because the atmosphere and decor is really nice.",3,1,1
117,Alice Z.,"Brookfield, WI",138,122,0,2.0,8/24/2014,"We came for the world cup final game and sat in their backyard garden. At the entrance, Tuttles seems pretty unassuming but once you walk to the back, it's actually very beautiful. We had a great view of the tv and started ordering food stat. We first had chips and gauc. The guac was good, very lime heavy. However the chips were your average bite sized round tostitos chips. Plus most of ours were all broken like the chips at the bottom of the bag. When the manager walked over to check on all the patrons, she saw our chips and told our waitress to get us more chips which was definitely appreciated. I ordered the salmon benedict. The egg wasn't runny like most eggs benedict are and the english muffin was barely toasted. The thick cut fries were the best thing on the plate. We then ordered a dozen oysters while watching the game since they were a dollar. I should've had lowered my standards for dollar oysters. When they came out I was very excited and to my surprise they were extremely large oysters. Our waitress didn't hand us any lemons which I thought just automatically came with oysters. Once we got our lemons, we slurped some down and all 4 of us said that they were shucked poorly. Some had parts of the shell. Others said that their oysters weren't cleaned well and were grainy/sandy. tl;dr The ambiance is great. The backyard garden is adorable. Go for the drinks and environment and not for their food.",,,

I offered him our napkins just to not have that happen. Food lacked any flavor. The worst part was the so called Pina Colada I was served. I have had Pina Coladas with no alcohol and with alcohol in my life. Bottom line they were all good. The bartenders must only know how to serve beer. What was given to me was a liquid mess. It had no alcohol in it and it was not sweet. I had to send it back and get a soda. In this day and age what bartender worth their salt does not know how to make a pina colada? That is a basic cocktail that all bartenders should know. I mean seriously? Bottom line it was not worth the price. I have no interest in ever eating or drinking there again. Ugh.",,,

We ordered the salmon wrap, chicken skewer, and cheese plate. The salmon wrap was the favorite - spicy and fresh. Only downside here was the service.

Beers are a bit pricey but its mostly craft beer, so you pay for what you get. The back garden is really cute. Set up like a beer garden, and it's aesthetically pleasing, for sure. They really put some time into making the small space feel cozy but you don't feel like you're sitting on top of your fellow communal table patrons. We had a bit of a hard time getting our drink order in, but afterwards, we were approached by a bunch of different servers asking if we needed anything else. The staff here were all really nice and accommodating. I looked at their brunch menu on my way out to see if it could become a potential spot on a nice day, but it's pretty basic.

This is when it got weird.A half hour later I had to get up and search the place for my waiter and he was no where to be found. He finally came by and asked if we were ready for our check. Um, I already gave you my card. Whoops he says! And he runs off to look for it. Another half hour goes by. Where is this guy? I walk around and find him. He apologizes and says the check and card have been lost. He offers to comp our meal. Offers? WHERE IS MY CARD. At this point it's humorous. I ask if he will please look for it. He agrees and says please give him a little more time. We wait ANOTHER HOUR. I have to go find him again. He says he can't find it. That's his final answer? I give him my name and number and say please call if you find it this evening, otherwise I have to cancel it in the morning.I get home, go to bed. Get a phone call saying I should come back that they found my card in the garbage.I get dressed and go BACK this this crazy place. Speak to the manager and he has no idea what I'm talking about and sends me to the bar where they run the cards. They have no idea what I'm talking about. Back to the manager who gives me the hand while he's on his cell phone. After a few mins he asks me again what I want. I say MY CREDIT CARD. Your waiter said you found it in the garbage. He says OH, you're THAT card. HOW MANY CARDS GO MISSING HERE THAT YOU ARE SO CASUAL ABOUT THEM?He runs off for about five minutes and then returns and hands me a receipt to sign. WTF. They charged my card after fishing it out of the garbage. I complain and he says they will void the charge and I should see the money in a few days when it clears. I had to ASK for them to comp me after this debacle? Total insanity. Everyone was nice but oddly comfortable with this happening like it happens all the time. They are either severely short staffed or under trained. Either way I hope they get their act together and someone else doesn't have to go through the same insane evening.YAYAYAYAY JUST FOUND OUT SOMEONE USED MY CARD TO BUY THEMSELVES A $50 STARBUCKS CARD!!!!",7,3,

They have a big outdoor patio and even a smoking area in the far back of the outdoor patio, their drinks are reasonably priced, they have dollar oysters, and their chicken wings are off the hook. The bartender was helpful in allowing me to have a separate tab because I didn't want mine to be mixed up with everyone else's, and the wait staff were friendly and fun.",,,
155,Christina C.,"Manhattan, NY",13,1,0,1.0,6/27/2013,"Beautiful establishment, good food, TERRIBLE service. I've tried giving this place a few chances, since it's literally down the block from my apartment, and unfortunately every time, they fail miserably. The servers take over an hour to come to your table, if they even do at all, then once you order food, you best ask everything you want right then and there, because you won't see another server in site for the rest of your visit. I've been here on a Sunday afternoon, when it was quiet, and still, slow/poor service. Get it together guys!",3,1,1
156,Donna C.,"Williston Park, NY",5,97,9,4.0,7/25/2014,"From the main entrance you would never know that past the narrow bar area is an outdoor dining space that spans three storefronts and so insulates you from most of the traffic noise. The food is good pub fare... I had the Tuttle burger which added cheddar and bacon over very good quality beef. We were a party of six and the service was very slow and bordered on inept. But if you're not in a rush and happy to bide your time in a casual outdoor setting by knocking a few back, this is the place to do it.",,,
157,Denise D.,"Bronx, NY",30,127,15,2.0,7/12/2013,"This place is too far out the way to return, especially considering lackluster the food. Don't get me wrong its' a great space--a bar upstairs and downstairs, a garden, and a balcony. However the garden was closed for a private event, the hostess was more concerned with doing her homework, and it was a fight to get a seat. I came with my single girlfriend, hoping she could meet a reasonably attractive guy to flirt with. No such luck. It was an older crowd, and honestly no one here was worth a second look. If you live in the area check it out, if not you can find another option.",2,1,1

160,Agnes F.,"Queens Village, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/21/2013,"So this is my first review because I just had to discuss how TERRIBLE the service was here. I had such high hopes for this place. Considering they were VERY well staffed, you would think one of them would have came to offer a menu or ask us what we wanted to drink. Nope. They were hanging out by the bar while we were looking right in their direction trying to get their attention. It took us many tries of yelling excuse me to whomever crossed our path to finally get a menu and order taken. My friend ordered a glass of wine that never showed up, which she was billed for. I must say the food was good but the service was so bad it's not worth coming back for.",2,1,1

163,My T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,2.0,7/10/2014,"Have been there over 3 times. Great space for the neighborhood. Tables and bar seating available on both floors. A few open balcony tables that have a great view of the garden area. Garden area has very tightly spaced communal benches.  The food is standard except the fresh oysters. They were super fresh even on a Wednesday evening. The noise level can be deafening at times. Especially when there is a ballgame on the large flat screens. The worst part of the experiences I would say is the  service. Water was never refilled.  All three times the server had to be flagged down. After going to the bar to tell the bartender that our server disappeared, she finally showed up another 10 minutes later to return another 10 minutes later with the check. If the service was improved the three times I had visited would've been perfect experiences.",,,
164,Seth B.,"Baltimore, MD",31,14,0,2.0,6/26/2013,"Went here for an after work dinner with Yelp reviews fresh in mind.

See myself like most New Yorkers my night probably would start after 11 pm but at this place once 11 pm hits you aren't allowed to drink outside anymore on the outdoor patio. Yes you read that right, my friends came here for a party and warned me that happened to them. I then was invited to a party midweek there the following week and the same thing happened to me. No drinks outside after 11 pm because ""they have neighbors"" was the reason, I asked them to elaborate and no one could give me a straight answer. This isn't high school you should probably get the problem solved if your biggest claim is to be an ""outdoor patio"" that serves alcoholic beverages. What a joke. Also it's Murray Hill so expect BROS to be over populating this bar like when I visited",1,1,1

175,Bade Nawaab N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,3.0,9/7/2015,"Perhaps only thing this place has going for it, is the patio/garden at the back.

Twice during that hour, a server came over and tried to plop down other peoples' orders in front of us.  Guess we should have just taken somebody else's food! We heard the same complaints from other people, too.  Just very, very disorganized and terrible service.  We ended up just getting up and leaving after waiting an hour.

180,HP J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,3,2.0,6/13/2013,"Second visit was...unimpressive.  The guac was unremarkable, made from ~1/2 an avacado at most, it had a nice kick, but was oddly textured (puree'd?) - one of our party thought it was premade/pre-packaged, & it can't hold a candle to El Rio Grande (~1 block away), Siniqual, or Dos Caminos.  The empanadas were all unremarkable.  The $16 scallops (plural, because there were 2, w/ 2 tiny shrimp) should've been called 'bowl of couscous'.  The grilled portobello panini ($11) was tasty, but small.  The mussels @ $10, was the only dish any of us was truly happy with.  We gave it 2-tries, but probably won't go back.First visit:Tuttles was tasty.  The garden is the big selling point - it's pretty nice (red brick walls, blooming morning glory vines, tomato plants, ~faux-antique ~european sconces, bierhaus-style thick wooden tables & benches).  Portions were modest.  I got a Caesar salad $8.  My friend had the Angus beef sliders ($2.50 ea., 2 minimum) & potato skins ($8).  Pint of Sam was $8 (steep for this area). Only had to wait ~10 mins to get the food (salad & apps, basically, tho).  We had our pick of the seating @ ~12:15, then the main patio filled-up, there is an additional outdoor overflow area.  The servers seemed a bit green/inexperienced, but were friendly & attentive enough.  We'll definitely go back to sample more of the menu.",1,,

189,Grace P.,"Alexandria, VA",3,20,0,2.0,9/8/2013,"We stopped by to get a beer on a Saturday night, and ended up getting food to go along with it. First of all, they didn't have a drink menu. Which was fine! The waiter was able to recite their draft beers. But it would have been nice to see the prices, rather than ask him the price of each beer. Anyway, he was very nice about it.The food was so-so: not too expensive, but tiny portions. Unfortunately, the waiter gave me the dinner menu and gave my friend the lunch menu, which had the same food but different prices. We figured this out when the bill came and my friend's burger was pricier than she thought it was supposed to be. When we pointed out the mistake, they apologized but refused to honor the price difference. If it had fantastic food or great prices, we might go back, but all in all, definitely not worth it. Too bad it's got such a cute courtyard; it could have been our go-to local place, which is hard to find in midtown.",,,

It took about 15 minutes before anyone even showed up to say hello or ask if we needed anything. Not only was the service slow, but the young woman who was serving us (we didn't catch her name but she had red hair, a tattoo on her back, and a piercing on her chest) could barely give us the time of day. She was clearly in the weeds and stressed. We tried to be friendly to ease the tension and make small talk for no more than 30 seconds. Nothing beyond the typical friendly social norms. She didn't like that at all... so she VERY RUDELY told us she didn't have time to talk. Fine. We said okay, and that we were ready to order. That seemed to annoy her as well, and without taking our order she disappeared for another 5 minutes. Once we were finally served, we didn't get any check backs and had to ask another server walking by for our check an hour later. We didn't get any sort of ""thanks"" or ""see you never time"" or any sort of pleasantries when they dropped the receipt back off. Clearly we (and everyone else seated on the back balcony as well) were a giant inconvenience to Tuttle's this evening. Sorry, guys. It's a Tuesday. No excuse.",1,,

But the food wasn't as special: we had dinner special with chef's burger and $1 oysters. The burger is a bit on the dry side although the fries came with it were well prepared; the $1 oysters were the biggest disappointment- bland and not as fresh.  So I'll suggest here for drink and small bites/ snack foods.,,,
