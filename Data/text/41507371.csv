It's the same you would get in any corner store for $3/$4 -- in a plastic cup with some granola and fruit. They ring it up and it comes to nearly $8!!!Ok fine, I'm starving and it's the only place nearby. Then I go to grab a spoon and there are none. I tell the cashier and she says they're behind me. I tell her there are none and she says sorry they must be out. Then looks away and ignores me, not bothering to offer a solution or even sympathy.So I try to take some forks and eat the yogurt with them. Obviously that doesn't work, so I come back to the store. One person recognizes me and pretends to check something in the fridge so he doesn't have to serve me. I have to track someone else down and ask them for a metal spoon I can borrow. She says she they don't do that. I tell her I'll bring it back. She says she has to ask the manager. We go back, and the manager is the cashier that ignored me in the first place! She says she can't give me one. I explain that for $8 yogurt, she should reconsider. Finally she relents.So I finally go to eat the yogurt. Of the 8 inch cup, there's only yogurt in 2 inches of it. I took like 4 bites before I got any yogurt. Now I realize, in hell the only food place is Le Pain Quotidien.",1

They have pastries & bread too. One day I came here to get my iced coffee & avocado toast to go. While waiting I seat on their chair outside. They have tables & chairs for customers that order through waitress. I seat since its empty outside. Then a waitress came up to me & ask if I order through a waitress. I said no & I order for a to go food. She told me that I can't seat their while waiting because its just for those customers who orders through them. I understand what she mean but its totally empty. No one is in their. She can kick me out if all the table is pack & thats the only table thats empty & customer is waiting for a table. Then you can kick me out. What a bad service! The avocado toast taste decent. It just look good on the picture. I'm still gonna come back for the iced coffee this summer but hopefully they work out on their customer service.

I hate to say it, but it didn't really hit the spot. The presentation was fabulous though. As was the presentation with everything honestly. We went for brunch, and I have to say all three entrees were very good and filling. If I lived here, this would definitely be a spot where I went to drown out noise and get some work done.

I do believe they also serve a full breakfast menu. The views and outdoor seating for the restaurant are very nice and close to battery park area so you can walk by the bay afterwards. The blueberry tart that I ordered was delicious. Felt very fresh and flakey on the outside which is exactly how I like it. The blueberries on top were also very crisp and juicy.

I have tried the following - quinoa taboule salad, six vegetable tart, and they used to have this hummus, avocado sandwich which they used to give me with gluten free crackers.The six vegetable tart is more of a vegan quiche made with tofu, vegetables and in a buckwheat crust. It is by far my favorite-est thing on the menu and oh, by the way its gluten free. I just think for a cafe / to go spot it is a little overprice at $14.

The croissants -- both the plain and the pain au chocolat -- were very similar to the ones I've had in Paris: crispy and flaky on the outside with a soft, airy interior. Regrettably, I did not try the coffee, but I did try the hot chocolate, which was incredibly rich. It was real hot chocolate though, with warm milk and solid chocolate. It wasn't too sweet, as is commonly the case.The meal was definitely worth the cost and I would recommend a stop by if you're ever near one of their many locations and looking for a simple, not too greasy meal.",

60,,10/21/2015,0,,"New York, NY",Tammy W.,0,2.0,3,Have been many times to several locations in the city. Usually for the soup and avocado toast but have gotten other bakery treats and breakfast items as well. This location specifically has very unprofessional servers who seem more worried about competing with each other for tables than making the customer happy. This would be tolerable if the food was consistently good. Today for example was a beautiful Wednesday where many were eating outside yet this restaurant seemed dead. Apparently all of the servers called out sick which was astounding first of all but you'd think that the food (take out only) would be fine. Soup was all broth and room temperature (gross) and avocado toast was half naked. After I spent $23 on lunch it was barely edible. Will not return.,
61,,10/17/2015,0,,"New York, NY",James M.,0,1.0,2,"Worst restaurant service I've experienced in NYC in years. We were seated at a table with the previous visitors' dirty dishes still on it, they took 10 minutes before bothering to clean it up, and another 10 minutes to give us menus. Then we had to wait another 40 minutes for them to make two fairly simple open-faced sandwiches. We also weren't offered silverware or tap water until we asked for it.",

I've been twice for lunch and everything looks good, but I've had the Tuscan White Bean & Prosciutto Salad both times because it is SO GOOD. Can't remember what my friends ordered each time, but I remember only great comments about taste and freshness!",
64,,2/9/2013,3,,"New York, NY",Stephanie L.,0,5.0,11,"Eating at this PQ is the closest it gets to eating at home. The wait staff is great and remembers me when I arrive, the atmosphere is homey with wooden tables in the back overlooking a courtyard, and did I mention that the food is delicious. And organic and healthy, so I actually feel nourished and energized instead of stuffed when I finish eating. I cannot say enough about the five-grain bread being the most delicious bread on the planet, especially with butter and a side of hot tea or coffee. If you slip in before noon you can order a perfectly cooked organic soft-boiled egg with bread for dipping. Rotating seasonal items keep the menu from getting boring,Even for take-out this place is great, although sometimes there's a bit of a wait when it's crowded. The counter staff go the extra mile to provide great service (like allowing me to order a side of bread even though it's technically not on the to-go menu), which has kept me coming back and bringing coworkers and friends here over and over again.",1

It would be fantastic if they made this one ""green""  in some way.For those in a hurry right by the door is a selection of popular to-go items.Initially seating seems limited  inside but has a generous outdoor area.Quite possibly THE most crowded of all the  lpq's, Plenty of loud strollers/mommies and business folk not much in between.",

69,,6/20/2011,1,1,"New York, NY",Alex O.,3,1.0,47,"1. Ate one of the worst sandwiches in my life in this place. 2. Service was surreal. It was Sunday around 5PM Fathers Day (maybe this has some importance, i don't know...) Ordered $11.95 sandwich with Parisian ham, aged Gruyere cheese on, I guess, artisan bread. One of my sons ordered ham with cheddar and the other one ordered turkey with cheddar both from kids menu. 20 min later my son asked me whether it is a hot sandwich, I said that it must be because what else can take 20 min ...and grilled Gruyere cheese sounded appropriate. 10 min later a lady who looked like a manager-in-traning apologized that it takes so long and that they were understaffed and that she was helping to make the sandwiches. Well, ok, I thought. The sandwiches - a piece of not fresh bread, dry ham and what looks like cheddar on all the sandwiches - supermarkets have this type of cheeses sliced and packaged. When I asked about my ""aged Gruyere"" the explanation that was given to me was so crazy I thought the waitress smoked some serious weed. She said ""all three sandwiches have Swiss cheese....maybe it is not the Gruyere you are used to... all three sandwiches have Gruyere on them"" (although there is no such choice for kids' sandwiches. Again, probably the reason for all these issues was Sunday - no fresh ingredients and tired staff. I don't care though - $11.95 sandwich was disgusting!",1

73,,7/10/2015,0,,"New York, NY",Oli S.,2,2.0,15,"I usually love Le Pain Quotiden, but this location has a real problem with the freshness of their breads.  After reading the reviews I'm glad I wasn't the only one to experience this here.  FIrst time there I ordered the Avocado Toast which I've had before at the Le Pain on the UES location.  But this time the bread was so tough and hard- like if it had been toasted and then left out for a few hours- that I had to tear the bread apart with my teeth because just biting into it wasn't getting me anywhere.  Then I went there a second time because I thought that was a fluke and the same thing happened.  Not only that, but my friend ordered a salad which came with a side of bread and my friend said she couldn't eat the bread because it was stale and hard.  There's no excuse for such poor quality. I'd stay away from anything that contains bread in this place.  Also I'm not sure how tolerable this place will be during the heat of summer as I could barely feel the air conditioner at all.  It was hot and humid opted to just dine outside so that I could at least get some sort of breeze.  I have no idea how customers will survive on a hot day with no breeze though.",
74,,10/28/2012,0,,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",Elle E.,0,3.0,128,The fact that it's located a bit further from WFC is a huge bonus in my opinion. It's great to grab a sandwich or drink here and walk along the waterfront in the summer. Their food is fine--nothing particularly special--but the ambiance is what makes coming here worthwhile. In the summer they have Lemonade Iced Tea which is fantastic.,
