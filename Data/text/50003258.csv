They also just added pizza on the menu and in a land where you can get pizza on every corner it's actually really good! The bar always plays great music, there are cheap drinks made even cheaper during happy hour. Outdoor seating during the summer is perfect for people watching down 2nd ave. Inside there are plenty of tables and booths if you have a big group of people!",1,1,1
1,Kayla C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",322,45,164,3.0,2/17/2018,I've always wanted to try this bar because I'm a big fan of the movie fight club... so the name and decor was intriguing... inside it's not so themed but was a great spot to hit up for a group happy hour!The back table is good of you are coming with a big group like we did and we actually were able to play som fun drinking games. The atmosphere is just like your typical sports bar but not as crowded- was a nice change up to others in the area. The food selection is typical bar food but I really enjoyed the burger and the fries were nice and crispy!The happy hour deal was great (buy one get one free) and they don't skimp on the liquor. Good beer selection I would probably go back!,,,

The under age NYU students were like ""you ruined the night"" and I told them that throwing water on me was not cool. One good thing, bartender didn't charge us for any drinks. Wouldn't go there again and the bartender took our picture like we did something wrong when we were having a good time. Hope she gets fired. Bartenders name was Barbara Rose from Bay Ridge Brooklyn.

The blonde chick was chill and gave my girl what ever cocktail she asked for. The place was a bit empty except for the drunk bunch in the back playing beer pong. My girl and I thought it was weird but we later found out that they work there. One off duty bartender named Magda was pretty drunk lol but it was kind of funny.

Durden is a bar with split personalities. When there's room to maneuver, you can chill at the bar, order up some solid bar food, chat it up with the friendly 'tenders and watch a ball game (plenty of TV's). Lots of taps, happy hour and daily specials make this a solid 'hood spot. There are nights, however, when this place is so bro'd out with young 20-somethings that it's best just to avoid entirely. Like when the crew moved into Tyler's pad on Paper Street, it's... a bit much (and Meatloaf is buried in the backyard). Bonus: outdoor seating in the warmer months",13,9,13

14,Jill F.,"Manorville, NY",209,255,194,3.0,11/29/2016,"Came here on Saturday evening 11/26, for drinks and food before going to a webster hall concert.DECOR: I was a bit surprised to realize the place was not as nice as it looked in pictures. But maybe it was supposed to have a grungier look due to the theme of fight club and tyler durden. I did like the music playing in background.FOOD/DRINK: The food was great. Ordered the jalapeno poppers and chicken cutlet sandwich with bacon and bbq sauce, side of fries. Jalapeno poppers were pretty standard but tasty. The sandwich (about $14) was huge and very tasty. I didn't even need the side of fries, could barely finish the sandwich let alone fries too. DRINK: This was the part that brought my review rating down. A captain and ginger was about $11 and was in the tiniest glass. Now this is fine because that's pretty normal for nyc. But the difference is usually the drinks at least have some alcohol in them. All i tasted was ginger ale. My friend at our table ordered cranberry and vodka and that glass was just dark red, you could tell just by looking that it was 98% juice. We got about 4 drinks each and all were this way.SERVICE: the service was not that great. Our waitress was very nice, but they brought out 3 out of 4 meals ordered and it took about another 10 min at least for the 4th meal to come out. Mind you, we all ordered the same sandwich too. That was a bit frustrating for us.Overall the place was okay. The location was good, food was delicious, but the drinks were super weak and the service was eh.",4,,1

The bartenders are really friendly, there is outdoor seating, drinks are reasonably priced and there are always great specials. The truffle fries are AMAZING too!

17,Sean O.,"Tucson, AZ",259,2,0,1.0,6/3/2017,"DO NOT GO HERE. First, the bar itself looks like it's trying too hard so there's that aspect when it's in a sea of awesome authentic bars in the east village. Second, the bouncers literally wouldn't let me into a what was essentially half full bar on the basis that my real Arizona ID and friend's US DAMN PASSPORT were fake. They proceeded to make homophobic remarks after I left and yelled them from across the street. Then a homeless man across the street cussed me out telling me that he owned that bar, which by the looks of it I wouldn't be surprised. Disgusting people working the front is enough of a reason for me to turn down an overpriced movie themed bar in the heart of the LES, but this experience made me resent the people of New York. Thank god St Marks is around the corner and has awesome people and good vibes. So I really recommend to anyone (especially people with out of state ids) just don't go here, it's really not worth the $15 fight club themed cocktail.",1,1,

21,Patty C.,"New York, NY",577,239,200,5.0,6/20/2015,"Shout out to our waitress Barbara and the help of Jenny! They made our night at Durden a 5 star!Walking on a friday night with a group a friends, we were in desperate search for a not so crowded bar with food and drinks. After stumbling onto many crowded loud areas, we decided to go to Durden. The girls ordered cider, and the boys ordered german beer. Affordable for a friday night ($7-8). But I wanted FOOD. I asked if they had a burger, unfortunately they didnt. Confused, since most bars would have burgers on their food menu, Jenny recommended the meatball sub and I agreed to it.After taking a few bites in my meatball sub, there was a big piece of clear plastic found in my sandwich. Usually I would be disgusted, but since we were greeted with friendly service, I told Barbara and she quickly took the dish away and also off our bill which was very kind of her. Plus they gave me a new meatball sub and fries on the house AND shots for all my friends. How sweet is that?!Overall my experience was great, minus the unexpected plastic found in my food. looking forward to going back there again!",3,,2
22,Joey G.,"New York, NY",218,1,0,5.0,6/10/2017,There are many divy-sports bars to choose from in the East village. Durden is certainly a unique experience from its fight club theme to a giant poster of Bernie sanders that management actually took the time to have printed. Worth it. The music reflects the mood of each bartender. You'll hear every throw back imaginable but no top 40. Never a dull moment at Durden. To be continued...,,,

24,Hannah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",293,13,4,1.0,5/5/2017,"Four people in my immediate friend group have had their phones stolen while they were at this bar. On four separate occasions. All of them were able to trace the location of their phone to the same address in Brooklyn. Since this bar is popular with NYU's under-21 crowd I think that thieves know that if they steal an underage student's phone they won't report it to the police because they can't say they were breaking the law by being at the bar in the first place. Anyway, if you go here late (~after 11) on weeknight, guard your valuables!Bar fights and gropey guys are not uncommon here. Also, $7 for a shot is heinous. Or so I've heard that's what they charge.",,,
25,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2412,5152,4.0,2/15/2016,"Whiskey with a kimchi chaser? Yes please.After many months of walking by Durden en route to my SF bar down the way (Finnerty's), last week was a ripe opportunity to finally see what this 2nd Avenue newcomer was all about. Their menu is influenced by the cuisine of New Orleans, but instead of a restaurant setting, you can have everything from muffaletta sandwiches to po'boys (even a brunch version with eggs and bacon on the weekends) to a creole style poutine dish. It's by no means going to earn accolades from your cardiologist, but hey - life is too short to have kale at every meal. Aside from the food, as teased in the beginning of this review, their take on the infamous pickle back is the whiskey + kimchi chaser. I don't foresee this de-throning New York's favorite party shot, but the spicy, fermented kick after a shot of Tennessee's finest is pretty interesting. If you're adventurous, give it a go. Good times all around and I'll certainly look for reasons to come back.",12,6,9
26,Taylor M.,"Pompton Lakes, NJ",221,1,0,4.0,6/6/2017,"This spot becomes absolutely crazy on weekend nights. If you want to party hard, go to Durden. The staff will join in with you and encourage the fun. They're great at what they do and they always want to make new friends. You'll wake up the next morning with a great story to tell or not remember what happened at all (in the good way!). For those who want a more chill bar experience, Durden's got that too. A sports bar, they have TV's tuned in to games all the time and weekdays/weeknights are perfect for hanging, ordering wings, and rooting for your team. Take a booth, a table or a bar seat - whatever suits you.",,,

Updated review","I used to work here, and it's a much better bar than it was when I did. It was a loud college bar back then, and now they've become a cool, casual sports bar with a nice crowd. If you were turned off by the youngsters in the past, you should give the place another try.The kitchen rotates every so often and the offering they have now is really good. They're pretty good at accommodating your sports needs, so if you don't see the game you want on TV then try asking.I'm biased, but I love the people that work here. Everybody enjoys their job, and they do their absolute best to make sure you have a good time. Also, the beer list is solid and they do a good happy hour.",,,
29,Rosalys M.,"New York, NY",241,3,0,4.0,8/28/2017,"Durden is a great sports bar and spot to watch Game Of Thrones. It's a nicer, updated dive bar with surround sound.

32,Mica A.,"Forest Grove, OR",2,1,0,1.0,7/30/2017,"The bouncers here are some of the worst I've seen. My friends and I are all legally 21. We went to Durdens based on a recommendation from a friend.  They asked for our Ids, and they literally looked at each of them for a solid 2 minutes each. BUT the worst part is that after looking at my friends REAL SC ID for a solid 2 minutes and verifying the information, the bouncer still snapped her ID in HALF. He then was just like ""oh"". We tried to speak t a manager and get some kind of compensation, but the bouncers just swore at us and threatened to call the police on us. We stormed off and went to a bouncer down the street, who looked at my friends BROKEN Id and could not believe that another bouncer thought it was fake.

34,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",200,210,32,3.0,8/15/2016,Came here for their happy hour special with a friend.  It was just okay.  The ambiance is more of a sport bar/dive bar rather than a cocktail bar.  It was definitely on the grimy side and their selection of beers weren't that many (they didn't have my favorite hoegaarden).  Didn't get a chance to try the food but the ones that I saw looked pretty good.  Probably won't go back though.,2,,1

38,Steele W.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/29/2016,"Durden is my favorite bar in the city. They always have great music, especially when the DJ is in. They also have great happy hour specials and other drink deals. The decor has a great counter-culture theme. The bar is perfectly mood lit and there are often some quieter corners where you can hang out with friends. If you get hungry the menu options have greatly improved since they hired the new kitchen. Service is fast and friendly.Every night I've gone I've had a good time, its great to go with groups or meet new people in the abnormally attractive crowd.Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights are the busiest in my experience but the bar handles it well. Dane is usually working behind the bar those nights dexterously slinging drinks like a better-looking version of young Tom Cruise in Cocktails.My recommendation: go if you like to have a good time-stay home if you don't.",,,1

40,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1048,236,5.0,7/9/2015,"Durden is an inviting and welcoming bar with lots of natural light flooding into the airy and open floorplan, unlike several of the other bro-y, divey bars in the area. During happy hour which is until 8 pm, drafts are $4, well drinks are $5 and sangria is $6. Given the season, I had to have the sangria, which was very well-made - not too sweet but just sweet enough that you'll realize you're a touch tipsy by the end of your second drink.The food menu comes from a separate entity called ""Nawlinz"", which supplies New Orleans-themed food. Po boys are all over the menu, as well as ingredients like pork jowls, bourbon and sausage gravy. I got the sausage gravy poutine, which is a sinful but delicious topping of savory sausage bits over fresh and crisply fried fries.I may be coming back!",1,,

The bouncer wouldn't let me in because I had a ""fake ID"", even after correctly answering all of his nonsense questions. I'm *30* yrs old. He said that my Georgia license was too ""bendable"". But, my husband's ID which was the *exact* same was apparently legit. I've never met a bigger idiot. The only difference between me and my friends is that I'm black...so, either you're a complete moron or racist as f***. Considering that my ""fake"" ID gets me through international customs, tsa and every and any other bar/club out there, I'm inclined to think that it had nothing to do with my ID at all. Why didn't he confiscate my ""fake"" ID? We asked two cops across the street to confirm my ID and they said there's no question it's real and he was just being a d***. Of course, they couldn't make him let me in but apparently this establishment encourages RACIAL SELECTIVITY. Happily, we just spent our money at a bar down the street and had a blast.

Angel, Natasha, and Cody are three of the most genuine bartenders I've ever encountered and they *actually* care about their customers which is *actually good*.

I came for my friend's birthday and the manager bought us a round of shots. She was very sweet to us. Play some beer pong on week nights.

57,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1372,384,370,3.0,5/12/2014,"I came here on a Wed night around 10PM to watch a Rangers playoff game and it was pretty dead inside. That made it perfect to watch the game and get speedy service so it was not necessarily a bad thing for us at that moment, but I probably wouldn't meet up with a group of friends here.I don't know if it was one of the patrons, the bartender or the bar itself, but somebody must have had a giant bag of pretty skunky weed that was stinking up the place.Drinks were reasonable prices and they have a decent selection of draft beers. I think I saw 16 between the 2 bar wells, but they may have more.Even with the thin crowd the bathrooms were pretty gross and the bartender kept asking me what my name was on every order. She also had her boyfriend or SO come in and they spent some time talking to one another, adding a little delay to the drink orders.After reading some of the other reviews I see that they offer HBO shows here! I have never considered going to a bar to watch Game of Thrones or Veep, but I may try it out at Durdens this week.",4,3,3

Easily accommodated my group of 15 when we came on a Saturday night.The music is top 50 playlist and was blasted way too loud during parts of the night, but I guess this depends on the DJ they had playing that night.Good for groups to get a few drinks if you're looking for a not-too-crowded bar in the area.",,,1
64,Allyssa K.,"Roanoke, VA",308,3,2,1.0,5/14/2017,"If you are female DO.NOT.GO.TO.THIS.BAR. We we're fully aware that this bar's scene was fratty underaged douchebags. They had two dollar drink specials so we accepted the ambiance. Tonight my friend and I went to grab a few drinks and hang out. While we were there this foul individual comes up and asks my friend about her tattoo just above her elbow. NOT that I should have to explains this but she was in jeans and a casual tank top.. We are in a deep conversation and explain that the tattoo is personal and just hope his intoxicated self would leave. About 20 minutes later he comes from the patio and as he walks past our table he grabs her thigh and brushes her shoulder with his arm. WHO THINKS THAT IS OKAY?!?! My friend immediately runs to the bartender to explain the situation and I am yelling at this disgusting predator that what he just did was sexual assault. The bartender explained that it was her first night but she went over to talk to the douchebag and explained to him that it was not okay and you cannot treat women like meat. As I am thankful for the bartender reiterating our issues, this bar attracts a low life crowd and I would never recommend/go here again.",1,,

When I asked for a manager, I was told no manager was there which is hard to believe on a Saturday night around 12am. I am now down an ID and have to order a new one without so much as a sorry. This place is absolutely not worth the rude bouncers, go somewhere else in the area. Will never return here again.",,,
66,Christie M.,"Chicago, IL",19,138,3,3.0,9/20/2015,"I have to say that this place is super cute, great ambiance and had great potential. Unfortunately, I was here on a packed football Sunday when the drinks, food, and service were moving very slowly. I don't necessarily blame the waiter, he was working his butt off, but he was the only server for 15+ tables and hordes of people standing around watching the games.The place seems like it's laid out well for brunch or casual game watching, but in a packed bar like today, those sitting at the tables/booths could barely see the tvs because of the number of people crowded near the bar. The game sound was on for the Bills- Patriots, but it was inaudible due to the crowds.The apple cider sangria was delicious, and the food menu looked super interesting and eclectic, with a New Orleans flair. Fortunately for me, I didn't order food, as it appeared from the tables near me that the food was on a 30-40 mins delay. Overall, this seems like a solid place, but it needs some definite tweaking to be a successful Sunday football spot.",1,,

68,Chris V.,"Mount Vernon, NY",239,3,0,4.0,7/18/2015,Barbara (our server) is the best! A couple friends and I walked in on a Friday night and were able to quickly get a booth to ourselves. We only ordered a few drinks but Barbara was very enthusiastic and we ended up taking a shot with her. Drinks were decently priced (~$7) but the shots were slightly pricey (~$8). Although I wasn't there for long it definitely seems like a more relaxed environment that I can get behind that's good for hanging out with friends. It's nice being able to sit down and not have to fight people at the bar for drinks.I'll have to come back for Barbara and to see what else this place has to offer!,2,,1
69,Courtney K.,"Ottawa, Canada",548,353,46,4.0,6/18/2015,"This place served as a solid venue to watch the blackhawks hockey game. They have large TVs, attentive bartenders, and most importantly, keep their TVs on full volume during an important match so everyone can hear. My friend ordered their absinthe cocktail which I tried and it was SO good, i want to return again just to get that. Also if you ""check in"" on yelp you get a free hug from the bartender...which is great because they are HOT! Apparently I was the second person ever to check in on Yelp for the hug!

70,Andy S.,"Manhattan, NY",70,16,2,3.0,10/26/2015,"I spend more time in Durden then I care to admit. Its owners are Pitt alums, so it's become the Pitt bar for football games. And because most 2nd ave bro bars were rather indistinguishable, why not support fellow alum when I'm in the hood not during a game?Let me be clear: the bar is definitely not perfect. The draft beer list is a bit too pedestrian for my taste. But service is always super friendly, even when the waitresses/bartenders are clearly swamped. I've seen the bartenders deal with rowdy patrons with utmost class, and they've always been responsive when I ask to put a certain game on one of the televisions. I did have a big issue last month with the toilet situation; they only have two, so when the women's was out, everyone was forced into the men's. It was highly unpleasant (smells, sticky floors, etc.), and no one bothered to come in and replace toilet paper or try to clean or anything (I had to go steal TP from the even grosser, toilet-clogged women's room). The line went so slowly that guys started going into the out of commission women's room and peeing in the sink. Ick.My other major gripe is with the sound situation: play sound during the games. The reason your bar is packed on Saturday, rather than any other bars with TVs, is for the Pitt game. So you should really play sound, instead of blasting the questionable DJ all evening during an 8:00pm kickoff. I guarantee everyone in the bar would have welcomed the change.So I know this wasn't the most glowing review, but I will still keep going back. H2P.",,,

82,Joe G.,"CANAL STREET, NY",58,138,16,4.0,3/31/2015,I have a bunch of friends that live in the surrounding neighborhood of Union Square East. There are a ton of bars in the area and I've been to most of them. They all offer the same sports bar atmosphere. They dont really differ much - with the same type of food and beverage served and the heavy influence of NYU college students that make up their crowds. Durden is different. And thats why i always choose to go. Its a lot more of a craft beer joint with a more mature clientele. Its appearance its not unique in any way other than the name (a Fight Club movie reference). Its never grossly packed or so loud that you cant enjoy a conversation. You dont have to worry abt the bar pulling out beer pong tables and ruining a hangout. They have 5 or 6 large tvs that always have the games on and Long bench seats and tables for large and small gatherings. This will always be a great bar as long as they continue keeping it simple and it doesnt get overrun by college students.,2,1,1

Also, they have a better selection of wine than most non-wine bars, and although I don't know shit about wine, I appreciate that they serve something better than Yellowtail.I host a weekly meetup here on Thursday nights for Couchsurfing, and the owner and the bartenders are very friendly and accommodating for the group.

100,Kevin N.,"New York, NY",668,12,12,5.0,6/25/2015,One of the first bars I've been to and I instantly became comfortable with the place. The establishment has a few outdoor seats with a bar inside. There are plenty of tv's if you want to watch any sports games. There are large tables inside the bar so you can eat or drink comfortably with groups of friends.I entered the bar with a group of friends and was seated by a wonderful person named Barbara and her trainee Jenny. We each ordered a beer that costed 7$ each was large enough to get two of my friends drunk. It was a little difficult hearing my friends talk but I suppose that's how many of the bars are like. I was still able to carry out an easy conversation with my friends though.Our relationship with the waitresses Barbara and Jenny was extremely positive. My group had fun talking to them and enjoyed their company a lot. One of my friends ordered food (forgot what) and found a very small problem with it. Barbara and the chef came out to apologize for the mistake which I felt was overboard. Barbara then proceeded to give us each free shots of fireball and joined us for a pickle back shot.

112,Hannibal S.,"Brooklyn, NY",543,22,1,4.0,2/5/2014,Went to this place for a couch surfing event. -Great bartenders (super attentive) and friendly staff. (They were super accommodating for the event)-Decent drink prices (especially at Happy Hour) and liquor selection(beer selection was average).-Clean bathrooms but there was an interesting smell to this place.-Decent screen placement (you can see the game from most seats even with a small crowd standing).Bottom line if your around the area and need a drink or want to watch the game in relative peace(not the mega sports bar scene) give this place a try.,2,,

I ordered Titos with pineapple juice.First sip and I knew the pineapple juice tasted a bit off. I drank it anyways. Instantly when I left the bar my stomach started hurting and even hours later I still feel very nauseous. At least the bartenders' titties were falling out off her shirt and into my face which was a nice compensation for getting the shits,2,2,
119,Milan P.,"New York, NY",24,36,68,5.0,12/14/2015,"Decided to visit this location not due to the name or ""Fight Club"" theme but rather the $4 any draft beer during happy hour which ends at 8pm. The menu isn't the largest but is extremely unique. I had tried the poutine balls which is served with a tasty mustard, and although they appeared burned and dry, they were fantastic. Will definitely come back here to try some other of their unique bar bites. The food is Louisiana-esque and the gumbo is next on my list.",,,
120,K R.,"Burlington, VT",0,3,0,5.0,10/26/2016,"Love this place! It's themed after the movie Fight Club, and attracts an eclectic group. It's not just your neighborhood sports bar with ample screens to watch the game. Here you can enjoy a wide assortment of ice cold draft beer with a New Orleans' style pub menu. The bartenders (Angel and Dane) make top notch cocktails if you just want to sway to the music or people watch. The bartenders were very friendly. I was comfortable right away, and felt like I'd known them for years. I'll definitely be back again. Durden gets pretty hopping on the weekend nights. Check it out!",,,

While it is more of a sports bar than I had expected they do a good job of pleasing all crowds. The weekends are pretty busy so seating fills up fast but there is more than enough standing room. I do wish they would move the tables in front of the dj booth so there would be more room to dance. My favorite night to go is Saturday for the dj who plays the best stuff.",2,,2

I ordered the philly cheese steak waffle and my boyfriend ordered the Durden burger. The article that inspired the visit to this undiscovered gem didn't do the place justice!!! Not only was the food remarkable for a pub, it rivaled a great restaurant. I had to ask the bartender how they did this and she told me the waffles are made from scratch daily.Great draft selection! How can you beat $3 Stella's!?!? 3 dollars!! It's like we were stealing, I don't think durdens will be undiscovered for long.",3,,

Besides Sunday night and when Game of Thrones isn't playing, it's a great bar to go to any day of the week. I always suggest it when I'm meeting up with friends to catch up.

The bartender was new, but he did a really good job of keeping everyone served. They don't serve food yet because they are still getting their kitchen built. However, they allow customers to bring food in or order delivery. The beer selection wasn't great, but good enough. The only thing that really tweaked me was the bartender who showed up for her 8:00 shift. She was one of these people who gets off on charging people 100% price on a 73% full beer. I watched her pour lame beers for hours, and she did it with no shame. She was terrible and probably still is. People like her are bad for business. I was successful in avoiding her anemic pours by going to the young-but-good bartender. All in all I had fun, and my bill was much less than I expected. Freebies, maybe? It was appreciated and I let them know. They accommodated us loud Patriots fans. The short beers need to stop, though. It was egregious.",,,

However, I was underwhelmed by their waffle chips that didn't have any seasoning and came with each topping on the side in small containers. I'd rather all the toppings piled on the chips, in real nacho form. BUT, This won't deter me from coming back for more drinks and to try the rest of the menu!",2,,

My friends and I ordered several of the drinks that were supposed to be $7 and some other drinks. After we paid I checked the bill and saw that we were charged double the price for the drinks! Absolutely ridiculous!! And to top it off we tipped VERY generously. Also, while inside a few girls said that the sign outside advertised one deal price and then once inside they advertised a different deal price. I will NEVER come back here and I would NEVER advise anyone else to come here. Now I know why they weren't the least bit crowded on a Friday night. Made a yelp account just for this review.

When we first got there we were skeptical about coming in because the place looked empty but I think it was just because of the time of day. The bartender was super friendly to us and recommended a great beer. Happy Hour prices were very affordable (5 bucks for some top quality beers). The chef happened to be passing by our table and he stopped to tell us about some of the menu items. Sounds like they have some great food options. I didn't order any food but had a bite of my friend's corned beef sandwich which was very large and tasty. My only complaint is that the chef uses a little too much mayo on the sandwich and slaw.

164,M M.,"New York, NY",0,69,2,1.0,1/27/2015,"I thought I would leave the bar this evening having calmed down, but instead I'm getting angrier and angrier. I stopped into Durden tonight for a quick blizzard beer before heading home. The music was good, and the people inside seemed to be in a good mood. Shortly after we got there, we noticed a woman, who was alone, passed out drunk. Several people at the bar were giving her water, but she was mostly, with the exception of coming to a few times, unconscious. A friend of mine stepped into see what was happening, as it was clear she had no friends at the bar. Thomas, the bartender, kept telling everyone she was fine. While unconscious, Thomas suggested that two guys (unclear if they worked at the bar or were just patrons) bring her home to her apartment, after they found her keys. When my friend suggested she accompany them. The two guys agreed this was a good idea -- they had never met this woman. Thomas, the bartender, told my friend to not worry about it, no big deal. I asked if he knew her, if she'd been in before. She hadn't. She had come buy to get the ID she had left the night before, and had ordered a martini. I suggested that sending (male) strangers to drop an unconscious woman into an apartment alone was not the best course of action, and that calling 911 was a much safer bet. No one listened. Thomas to me to back off, because ""homegirl"" was ""his problem."" When the randos + my friend tried to carry her out of the bar, she fell hard several times on the concrete. She was totally passed out and dead weight. Again, I suggested to Thomas that calling 911 was the best course of action here. I suggested that he consider his own liability, and the bar's liability, of either sending an unconscious woman home with strangers or leaving an unconscious woman in the corner to just ""sleep it off."" Again Thomas snapped at me, and announced several times to others at the bar that ""someone should get a wheel barrel for her"" as she was a larger woman. Finally, Thomas told everyone to back off, and that ""the best thing to do"" was to leave her passed out in the corner. He was a total asshole. My friend is sticking behind to make sure she is okay. She didn't feel comfortable leaving. I left, fuming. I'm still fuming. What happened at Durden tonight is just not okay.",1,,

Not only were drink orders overlooked, but meal orders took over an hour. On top of that, the bar didn't even have HBO to show the season 4 premier of GOT.

Originally we had intended to have dinner across the street at Momofuku but were told upon arrival that we wouldn't be able to get a table for two hours. We decided to have a few drinks at Durden and see how we felt closer to our reservation time. From the second we walked in we began to enjoy ourselves. Our bartender who I believe is also the manager greeted us as we walked in and made us feel right at home. I was immediately excited by the large variety of beer that they have as I'm a big beer drinker but was worried for my friend who is more fond of cocktails. While my friend was interested in the cocktail list they had available, he instead decided to play a game with the bartender. After picking a spirit and an adjective, the bartender proceeded to create a custom cocktail for him right there on the spot. We must have done this about 5 different times before we suddenly received our notification from Momofuku that our table was ready. We then made our best decision of the night and decided to just stay at Durden instead.  What a wonderfully knowledgable and personable staff. As a person entertaining a friend from out of town for the night I couldn't have been happier with this experience. Durden gave us a fantastic night that I know we'll be talking about for years!",2,,

But if you come on the weekdays you'll probably see one of the best bartenders in the east village. Jordan is attentive, makes great drinks, and the atmosphere is on point.",,,

178,Leah T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,19,0,4.0,11/16/2014,I had good drinks at decent prices with attentive bartenders. I liked the music and it wasn't super crowded. My only complaint is that the music was too loud. I was trying to talk to my friend and really ended up yelling in her ear.,,,

182,Anna H.,"Saint Paul, MN",143,1,0,1.0,6/14/2014,"The bartender was extremely rude to us. It was also not exactly the cheapest bar, and honestly, I feel like you could find a better atmosphere easily.",,,
183,Kristin M.,"Kensington, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/6/2014,"The female bartender was horrible and incredibly rude the night I was there. They were also under staffed for a night they should have been expecting a crowd. It took them 50 minutes to serve me a sandwich. The bar was advertising that they would be hosting the game of thrones premiere, however, it turned out the bar did not have an hbo subscription and were trying to play the show off hbo go from a cell phone. They were clearly ill prepared and doing false advertising. The atmosphere isn't anything special and the beers on tap list is lacking. Certainly a bar I will never return to.",,,
