0,Rafi S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0.0,5.0,10/28/2018,Great place to watch a game. Food is tasty and consistent and beer selection is awesome. Try the beer sampler - great option here. Love watching the NBA here in the fall/winter and hanging out outside in the summer!,,,
1,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,2.0,5/27/2018,"Disgraceful ripoff. Come here to be charged $14 for a pile of arugula. I've had this place bookmarked for over a year and was eager to try it. Despite wanting to like it, my experience affirmed why it has a mediocre rating. We came in at 11pm on a Friday night and were brusquely told that they are closing at 11:30 (weird since the hours say 1am but whatever). Order a beer and a glass of wine (both $9) which come out pretty fast. The rosé was so-so but the beer from Sugar Hill brewery was delicious. Boyfriend orders the sausage and pretzel ($12) and I get the arugula salad ($14). What a mistake to order any food here. When I received my salad, I actually laughed out loud. What was described on the menu as having goat cheese and toasted hazelnuts was an EXPENSIVE pile of greens with some lemon juice and a few shaved almonds. I let the waitress know, who seemed not to care less, and she said she'd bring me goat cheese. She comes back with a portion of what tasted like sour cream and capers. Let that sink in. This place charges $14 for a pile of arugula you pay $1 for at the grocery store with a few almonds and SOUR CREAM on it. Blech. The sausage was almost as disappointing. Tiny portion, dry pretzel roll. Sauce had a weird flavor. Tiny side of sauerkraut was fine but not enough to redeem the dish. NEVER AGAIN",3,3,

3,Dana C.,"Manhattan, NY",386,25,67,3.0,5/21/2018,"Only giving 3 stars instead of 4 because we had bad service. We waited far too long for our food. However, when the food did come it was very good. They have authentic German options, including ""German pizza"", which I thought was delicious. They have a good selection of beers on tap, happy hour prices on both beer and food. I suspect I just came on a day that was short staffed. I will certainly return.",,,
4,Jema T.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,7/29/2018,"They have a good selection of beer. We had the Marrakesh Merguez [lamb] sausage, with the truffle fries. The sausage was great! The menu says, ""All sausages are locally produced and preservative free."" The house made honey mustard was great as well! The truffle fries: a sham! Generic, crinkle cut fries, with tiny bits of truffle and shaved parmesan. There was literally no truffle and no truffle oil. Do not waste your money getting these fries. It's an extra $3 with a meal, or $11 as a side, $8 during HH. Speaking of happy hour... this was the main reason I wanted to try BI. On Sat & Sun, they have a HH from 4pm-6pm (select beer and food). Out of the 18 international drafts and 20 bottles, only 2 beers for HH? They need to add, a few more beers to the select beer HH. Or you'll end up spending over $70 on a few beers, some sausages, imitation truffle fries, and slow service.",,,

The place was airy, the vibe was nice..African tunes played in the background.The brunch menu is $13 and up which comes with a drink (Bellini, Mimosa, Beer, Soda, Juice) and nice options for meals. I believe they all come with salads and for that price, you can't beat it. I had the crab cake Benedict which came with the salad, bread and I ordered a side of truffle fries. I wasn't crazy about the fries but they were pretty basic fries.. not much flavor to it so be sure to ask for the chipotle mayo...The service was pretty darn good.. everyone was friendly.

14,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,8/21/2015,"German beer and eats up in Harlem? Sure! Solid choice if in the area. Good beer offerings and they mix in a selection of German, Czech, Belgium, and some local NY brews such as Six Point, Bronx Brewery, and Doc's cider.Sat at the bar last weekend during happy hour. The bartender here rocks, and she was super cool. Open and airy beergarden spot with some sidewalk seating in front.Did not sample the eats here so that will be a return trip for next time up in Harlem. Happy Hour Mon - Fri 4 - 6 p.m. and Sat & Sun from 4 - 5 p.m is kind of short though as it should be until 7 or 8pm. Stopping happy hour at 6pm is just not right. Many are just getting back from work at time. Good thing I had summer Friday half day!Get a flight and try a bunch!

19,Fazeela S.,"Brooklyn, NY",197,338,348,2.0,7/10/2015,I wish I didn't have to give Bier 2 stars but I have no choice. It would have been one star if their staff were not so *nice*. We were just there for a birthday party and the beer was fine. Not the best selection for my tastes. The service was horrendous. Seriously. Bad. We would order a second round and 30 min later would have to remind the server of our order. Now this would be ok if it were just us - but this was the experience of everyone in our party - about 30 people. We ordered the truffle fries to our chagrin. Worse than McDonalds. Don't do it. The DJ was spinning fresh tunes and we danced a bit. Plus the Honduras v. Panama soccer game was on - another reason for the 2 stars instead of 1. But I'll pass in the future (unless I happen to be in Harlem and need to watch a soccer game).,1,1,1

Not amazing, not bad, just fine. We also caught the end of some live traditional German music (I think that's what it was, accordion and bass).I had the currywurst with fries and my lady had a beef sausage with sauerkraut.

You can't walk to the corner bodega, this is Harlem.  Same odd german beer selection, big on Lion brand, which is Sri Lankan, go figure.  I don't mind drinking German style beer, but they better have something to wash it down with, like a german style pretzel.  I vaguely remember eating one after the beer drinking contest, but I was informed by the server, we do not have any pretzel's today.  All day they could not produce one pretzel, to be fair it was Taco Wednesday.  The servers, manager we're very cool, and they gave my friend a limited addition Bronx Brewery Pint Glass from deep in the cellar, just because he asked, which was beyond nice.  Bier International, I will be back, but I am calling first to confirm they are serving pretzel today.",,,

The berliner currywurst is actually a disgrace to its name. Not the right sausage, served with regular ketchup (not right) and curry sauce (why??!). Maybe some customers like it that way but just call it the ""Harlem style Wurst with Indian Curry Sauce on the side"".Either do it right, or don't do it at all! So disappointing...",,1,1

Unfortunately, the service turned out to be extremely slow and we just ordered canned/bottled beers! We had to flag down the waiters to get any service. They never approached us on their own accord. Also, be aware that this place is cash only and at the time we went here, the ATM was down so we had to walk 3 blocks down in order to get cash when we wanted to leave. The owner is German but seems to not really care about his business as he just walked around drinking wine, instead of supporting his staff (unlike the owner from HFB across the street whom you will sometimes see in the kitchen cooking).

I've had truffle fries in a lot of places and these are the saddest truffle fries ever. I think we had about five tiny pieces of truffles between the two of us. We had to ask for more and the waiter was not impressed with our request. The atmosphere was nice - a large crowd watching the soccer game. I don't think their beer selection was phenomenal but it was decent. I was a little surprised that a place in Manhattan in 2016 doesn't take credit cards but c'est la vie (there is an ATM).",,,

It's also great place to sit outside and soak up some sun during the summer. Beer: They have a solid beer selection, particularly if you're in the mood for German beer. Food: I highly recommend the Crab Cakes Benedict and Bier Steak Burger. I always opt for Gouda on the burger.Service: The service is sometimes a bit slow depending on how busy they are, but otherwise pretty good.Note: Bier International is CASH ONLY.

It seems like many people go there to watch soccer.Service: Staff is friendly and not hesitant to give you samples if you can't make up your mind. Drinks: I had the Fruli strawberry beer. It was sooo good. Unfortunately they were out of the cider of the day which I wanted to try. I also had the Erdinger Urweisse.Food: We had the guacamole which had pineapples chunks and was quite yummy. We also had the truffle and shaved parmesan fries and they were to die for.

Updated review","I've been here more than 5 times due to proximity. The service was bad at first but has gotten better, so I'm changing my review. The food is similar to baseball game food- pre-frozen hotdogs, fries, etc. The beer selection is fun. They decorate the place cute on the outside with seasonal lawn ornaments and things and I love the outdoor seating. There are big TVs inside. They don't play American football games, mainly tennis and soccer. Probably rugby. If you're looking for a beer garden with German sausage, this is your place. Don't expect fancy wine or food.",,,
35,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,3.0,7/27/2014,"3.5 stars. Came here for a birthday get-together last night. I'd recommend to try once. I was really into the atmosphere. It's a sports bar with TVs everywhere, but it's also fun and chill. There are small groups of people hanging out. There's available seating inside and outside. Music is funky in a good way.Food was way overpriced. I got guacamole, which is $8, with tax and tip, I paid $12. Um way too much for a side order, especially when it was such a small dish. Our group also got the truffle fries, the pretzels, the hummus platter, and other sides. The food was overall good, especially the fries. Service wasn't outstanding.

The mint yogurt that was served in the side was pretty good though. Honestly, I enjoyed the fries more than the burger. For 2 beers, a salad and a veggie burger, the bill was over $40.

40,Allison S.,"West New York, NJ",151,271,884,3.0,8/3/2013,"I will preface this by saying I'm a very hard critic because I have been to Oktoberfest in Munich and I frequented Germany in my snowboarding days, so I had high expectations.The best part of my meal were the truffle fries, but they aren't as amazing compared to some other places I have been in the city. The most interesting thing is the location of this place, Harlem of all places! But it just shows how this place is coming up and become trendy and the place to be. The place is a decent size with large communal tables like at OktoberFest and sitting outside. I don't know if it's the size or ceiling or the lack of decor or whatever that place has an echo. And it get super loud in there, I don't remember there being music, but I remember straining to take to my friend right beside me.I had the traditional German Weisswurst, I was excited because I remember trying my first wurst at OktoberFest in September 2010.... ah.... memories! I remember the Bavarian dressed waitress placing this bland looking sausage in from me with a pretzel and a lump of mustard and making a face like I just wasted 20 Euros but I was oooohhhh so wrong! The explosion of flavor and essences of the herbs over power the bland boring look of the two linked sausages. And when you paired it with the large grain mustard it was two little kids skipping in a field of flowers! And no the taste wasn't heighten by the fact that I had a large beer stein in front of me. It really was that good.I was expecting the same experience here but ooohhhh so disappointing. The wurst was bland, it was only one sausage and it didn't come with a pretzel... :( You need to pretzel to soak up the beer you're drinking!!! So it was a bit of a disappointment. The dessert was a dry disappointment of a red velvet cake.... save your money and buy another beer. The beer selection was great but I wish they had more, but all wonderful beers!

I love the open windows and the picnic table seating. I appreciate what they're trying to do. Unfortunately the food was ok - not particularly fresh or exciting - and the service was poor.I had the curry wurst - the sausage was ok. Not sure how fresh it was, but it was simple boil with curry mustard on the side. The fries were definitely old and reheated. The veggie burger also didn't taste fresh but had decent flavor to it.It took 20 minutes after getting seated to get waters and a drink order in. The place was not even half full on a Sunday afternoon. We had to consistently wave down servers to order food or drinks. We weren't seated with a beer menu.I also do wish they had more adventurous beer choices on tap, and more German varieties. They had your standard brands but that's it.TLDR; order a drink at the bar, sit where you like, enjoy the atmosphere",,,

Updated review","Ok, so I have to give credit where credit is most definitely due.  I last wrote a not so great review about this place, so I want to set the record straight.  This is still one of my favorite German places in NYC.  The last time I was there was clearly just a one off, bad night.First I have to commend the owners and staff of Bier International.  They had been contacting me vigorously for months, yes months, to get me to come back and try them again.  Folks, in NYC, you simply don't come across people that care that much anymore, so that says a hell of a lot about this place.I finally returned there over the last weekend, and Bier International met my every expectation, once again.  Actually, there was a surprise: a band playing Afro-Cuban music.  Not German, but who cares.  It was such a pleasant contrast, it made the meal that much more enjoyable.I recommend the Currywurst with a good Hefeweiss bier.  Also, be sure to get the Parmesan fries for an extra $1.  You'll know why when you do.This place still has it's original flavor, vibe, and good service.  Keep up the good work.",3,,2
49,Loida V.,"New York, NY",77,33,1,5.0,7/2/2013,"Bier International is one of my local staples. I remember coming on the opening night during my first summer in Harlem and have been coming ever since. The beer selection on draft (and bottled) is extensive and there is a a type of beer for everybody: dark beers, to pilsners and fruity types. Wine is available but no hard alcohol. The menu is straightforward and tasty:  I tend to lean on the truffle fries with parmesan or lamb burgers. There is also a large selection of sausages. The staff is excellent and deliver great service. The patrons vary to couples, people on dates, colleagues on after-work drinks, guys watching the game, or someone reading a book and drinking a beer. I have spent many pleasant times here and am looking forward to more. For example, right before Hurricane Irene hit, a group of us arrived at a packed bar to have a beer before buckling down in the apt. Another time we stopped by for New Years Eve and ended up staying. Tips: - it's cash only- there are some 2 tops, but it's mostly communal tables",,,

Frankly, we only end up here due to the lack of alternatives in this neighborhood, not because of any other factor.The draft beers are a great selection and they do have draft cider, which is excellent.  However...and in this place there's always a however/but...they take literally forever to get you your damn drink!  It is unbelievable how poor the service is here.  There are servers floating around all over the place at a ratio that should mean you don't have a problem.  And they are also quick to grab your glass while there's still beer in it.  It's very rude and a massive party foul.  The owner is always there so there is no excuse for the poor service.  But still, you'll see your drinks sitting on the counter to be picked up, servers chatting with each other...no beer coming to your table.The food is good depending on what you order and what day it is.  You'll order the same thing, truffle fries, for instance in the same week even and the difference is vast.  One day they will have lots of truffle and cheese and the next they will be overcooked with sparse pinches of toppings.  They perpetually seem to be out of the more popular sausages but when they have them, they're very tasty but not tremendously authentic. Steaks come out overcooked (two for two) and the waitress last time blamed the kitchen after we watched her stand at the bar and talk while the steak sat there to be picked up, overcooking.  Don't even try to order food when it's busy, the wait is unbelievable.The location is great.  Far too friendly to strollers and children are allowed to crawl all over the place.  Crying toddlers will kill your buzz.  But otherwise, this business will succeed largely due to their location that the fact that they got here first.  There is outdoor seating which is great now that they have an awning. And they only take cash.  We were told this is because ""drunk people can't do math"" on the receipts and end up cheating the place which seems like a true excuse.  The same owner has the cafe across the street and they run cards without a problem.  Bring some along because the beers are great when they make it to you, and you will want more.After rereading this, I wish I could give this place a 2.5.  We'll still go back for location and drafts, but the rest of it is a glaring error in Hospitality 101.",3,,

52,Don D.,"Jersey City, NJ",167,13,4,2.0,7/28/2014,"You'll have to drag me back here.So, first off the beers are decent- not great, which is what you expect (or much more) from a place called bier. I ordered a flight and my lady wanted the cider. They were out of the cider and didn't have anything comparable. The waitress came around to take my order. When I asked her (i.e., waitress at a beer garden) for her advice, she told me to go to the bar for help. Ok. So, then the bartender gives me her very disinterested and uninspired recommendations. Again, the beers were decent. I came for the convo so it worked for that, but I won't be coming back. Oh, they closed early with us inside @ 12:05 instead of 1:00am as advertised - they pulled gate down and everything. Apparently, they close early when it's slow. I suspect they will be closed for a long time soon.",1,1,

54,Shen B.,"Southampton, NY",12,24,2,3.0,1/31/2016,"My visit was well enough though somewhat lackluster. I had stopped in for a couple beers and dinner. I was surprised by the menu for two reasons, the first that it seemed a bit plain, and secondly the nickel and diming. Many dishes offer a side of either fries, kraut, and something else (I can't remember what). I was quite turned off at the thought of kraut as a side instead of a garnish or pairing. Which swung my choice to the sausage on a pretzel roll (one of the only options with kraut included). The sausage was decent. A highnote was the beer I tried that is one of the better ones I have tasted before.",,,
55,Steven C.,"Manhattan, NY",190,56,80,4.0,1/22/2016,"Service can be slow and it's cash only, but they serve the beer in the correct glasses, they don't push you to be in a hurry about anything and the sausage menu is better than your mom made if your mom made sausage.",,,

I've tried the fish tacos that were really good once, and the chicken quesadilla that was just ok. Also tasted the truffle fries which were well seasoned and flavored but a bit mushy.Try to get a sit outside, and remember it's cash only.",,,
57,D T.,"Manhattan, NY",3,31,0,5.0,5/14/2014,"We recently moved to South Harlem and this has definitely become one of our go-to places. There is an excellent selection of beers here, which I have appreciated because most of them are totally new to me. So, it's great to be able to try a beer that is out of the norm. Also, the service has always been impeccable---friendly and attentive. The servers have always been very generous about allowing us to sample any beers that we are not familiar with before committing to buying them.  The food we have always enjoyed---it is a bit on the pricy side considering the rather small portions, but we tend to stick to the happy hour time when a bunch of apps are discounted and the beer is as well.   Overall: a nice place to go and I think that we will come back quite often.",1,,
58,Dara D.,"New York, NY",4,1,0,3.0,8/20/2016,"What's up with not having sauerkraut available during brunch??? This is a German restaurant, right? Why not add it as a possible side? I asked for some and was told, ""It is only available during dinner."" You have it in the back and it comes in a jar. What's the big deal? Pop the top and give me some. The sausage I ordered would have been even better with some sauerkraut. Honestly, that was the whole point in me coming to the place, to have the full dining experience.",1,,
59,Mike O.,"Manhattan, NY",53,141,20,4.0,8/6/2012,"Drinking a nice cold beer on a hot summer afternoon, after work is always, in my opinion, a great way to finish off a long work week. We came here to temporarily escape the usual watered down drinks of other NY places with a taste of beers in the middle of Harlem.There was outdoor seating, but the nice cool breeze inside was a better feeling, and a great option.We both got the grand sampler. I ordered the Erdinger, Delirium Tremens, Jenlain Ambree, Krusovice, and Six Point Sweet Action;  All of which come in 5 oz glasses.A few notes on what I can remember:Krusovice has a champany sweet taste to it.The Six Point, has a dark, richer taste than the Erdinger, despite the lighter color which can be a bit deceiving.And the Delirium, Jenlain, and Erdinger were all my favorites for a light not so dense taste.As always when tasting different beers, start from lightest to darkest.Cheers",,,
60,Jenny M.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,221,87,4.0,2/12/2014,"Where has this kraut been all of my life?  The best tasting, creamy, tart kraut I've ever tasted, good enough to order as your meal, so I appreciate the huge portion that arrives with your sausage link.  For a buck, they add bacon, and it makes it that much more glorious.You get a magnum sized Hofbrauhaus for $7 if you order food (really, it's ginormous).  Great burgers, juicey and no nasties (hormone, antibiotics), great selection of beers, draft cider is ice cold.  Excellent truffle oil fries and manchego cheese as an option for your burger?  Yes, please.  Great staff.   Consistently good, and they have loyalty cards for some of the beers they serve.  Warm weather means you can sit outdoors...s",1,,1

62,Keith L.,"Seattle, WA",280,171,41,4.0,9/27/2013,"Bier International is one of my favourite bars in the City. I'll be honest - it is usually my second stop on a Sunday Funday. Start your day with a delicious brunch at Lido (only a few blocks north) and then meander your way down FDB to Bier International. The selection of beers is phenomenal, the food is great (as long as you don't order the guac with pineapple), and the staff is beyond accommodating. I've often spent many an afternoon here consuming a boot of beer. Yes, I said a boot.",4,3,3

But I can't.I have to be true to my heart and my belly.And both demand that I never come back here again.The service is spectacular.Your servers are prompt.My group's orders were all correct.And my water glass never went empty.Sadly, I came here for the food, not the service.The food is just blah.The chicken wings are the smallest order of chicken wings I've ever had in this lifetime. The ""blue cheese dressing"" they serve with the wings has the consistency of mayo.The Wieners & Kraut were the blandest wieners I've ever had in this lifetime and the ones before. And not even the bacon bits could have saved the kraut.The Truffle Parmesan fries are the saddest fries I've ever had, including from my past life as Guy Fieri.I tasted one ""truffle"" slice and I thought I mistakenly ate a Styrofoam peanut.It didn't taste like anything ='(Which makes it safe to assume that they just pour truffle oil on the fries.I've been to plenty of German bars and I usually like the food.I'm hoping that theirs improves with time.I'll give you another shot one day Bier International.But I can't come back just yet.xx",,1,1

Ordered a lamb burger with truffle fries...they instead bring regular fries. So what do they do? Throw some unmelted cheese and some oil on the same fries and give them to me! Not to mention the lamb burger was VERY bland. And what's with the rationing water? They serve you beer by the gallons, but when you ask for some water the bring it in a shot glass?!

68,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",153,353,60,3.0,6/12/2013,"It's noisy inside, but we had no trouble finding a tranquil seat on the sidewalk on a beautiful June evening and thoroughly enjoyed the international beer selection and late-setting sun. Beers are on the expensive side, but they are all interesting, unusual options. In a nice touch, they all seem to be served in the glasses from their respective breweries-- and we're not talking normal, interchangeable pint glasses stamped with a beer logo, either. This is fancy glassware in different shapes and sizes! I know that this is not an unheard of phenomenon, but I was surprised to see it here, in Harlem, with such obscure beers. I don't know; I just appreciated it. For the most part, the beers were either $7 or $8 for .3 liters, although there were half liters and .2 liters in there as well. I got the beer of the week, Aventinus, which was described as ""wheat doppelbock with a complex spicy chocolate-like aroma and a hint of banana."" It was very smooth and richly sweet, and just what I was looking for. My roommate got the strawberry Früli, which, despite being 4.1% abv, pretty much tasted like soda. The European version of Smirnoff Ice, perhaps? I like that sort of thing sometimes, but be aware that this is seriously sweet. Boyfriend stuck with a simple German lager, the HB Hofbräu Original, which didn't taste that interesting but benefits from being the cheapest and probably least intensely flavored beer on the menu.As for the food, to be honest nothing on the menu spoke to me. We got guacamole, because it's the kind of standard bar munchie that is hard to mess up. It was good. The chips had a weird sprinkling of orange, doritos-esque dust on them which added a very modest amount of heat. Fine, except that it came at the expense of salt, and god knows that a tortilla chip's insanely addictive native is derived nearly exclusively from salt. They were decent vehicles for the guacamole, but once we finished that, the excess chips sat untouched. Boyfriend also got the Euro platter, which I didn't sample, but it was the least appetizing plate of meats and cheeses I have ever seen. There was like liverwurst and jerky on there haha. He liked it, but you might not feel the same way!Service was spot on. It's not the best place in the world, but I would certainly go back. It's more interesting than Harlem Tavern, at the very least. Very solid uptown option.",3,1,2

70,Laksen R.,"New York, NY",312,392,24,4.0,9/7/2013,Bier is a great bar in Harlem. As the name suggests they specialize in Beer. Locals frequent this bar and it is a very popular place to hangout. I love the Truffle Fries. It's a great item to share with a party of 4 or less. The only drawback to the bar is that it is cash only which is why I am not a regular here.,1,,

The food is delicious, the truffle fries are lauded about enough in the reviews, they offer beer by the boot [das good!] and they have a yummy option for vegetarians (I'm a sucker for the mushroom quesadilla).The only real faux pas was our weird service we always get. It's a pretty lassiez-faire place and the servers are nice but seem completely out of touch. We were given menus after brunch had ended although we had sat down beforehand, then told we couldn't order over half the items on it AFTER trying to place our order (my excitement about the crab cake benedict shattered), and then when our bill came we had been charged a full $8 for a mimosa even though we weren't told they had gone back up to full price.

We had some of each. Hofbrauhaus was great, as expected, but our waitress delivered it showing a bit less cleavage than the Germans. We tried to eat as German as possible. We had two of the huge sausage plates ($30 each, but they took care of the 9 of us), and had the pretzel (a little soft, for my New York taste), But... some of us couldn't resist the nachos and wings. Ach du lieber! Our waitress and busboy continued the recent tradition of OUTSTANDING service. Right on the spot... with humor and friendliness. The place was not crowded on a Thursday (cold!) at 9:30... and the kitchen closed at midnight. But I gotta say, we enjoyed ourselves. --Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers.",,,

I power chugged a few Six Point Sweet Actions, and didn't even get my bartender's names. I did speak! I remember that. But the fraternal handshakes and slice of life conversations were elsewhere.

Out of the more than dozen times I've been to Bier International, I've maybe had a poor experience once. Otherwise, the service and food have always been excellent. The bartenders especially are great about giving recommendations (and tastings) of the ever-changing beer menu.Some tips: - The restaurant is cash only. There is an ATM inside, but I've been a few times where it has been broken.- Go for the HB Hofbräu Original if you're looking for a light, super drinkable beer.- The Euro platter is a lot more cheese, sausage and bread than you would expect for the price. It's good to share with people.- Large tables are awesome for groups. It might take some time to swipe one, but they can fit 8+ people.In a neighborhood where the quality of restaurants vary, I am grateful for Bier International.",1,,

The neighborhood is becoming a great area for inexpensive unique restaurants. I do not drink at all much less beer. But I wanted to try the truffle fries and pretzel!The prices are over priced for sure for what you get! But I was willing to pay it!The Pretzel was soft not like a street pretzel but not as good as a Philly pretzel! I am not into mustard and was hoping for hot butter or cheese! But it is way over priced for what you get! Not worth the uncomfortable seating that you have to endure! I do not get the prices in this neighborhood. It is an up and coming area and there seemed to be a gang meeting on the next block. Charging that much up here is not appropriate! Nothing blew us away!But for me the reason for the 2 stars is multi layered.The picture does not do the chair justice! It is like a Kindergartners chair! It was super uncomfortable! I am average sized. I am 5 foot 6 and weigh 125 pounds and I could barely fit into the chair! Though I do not drink for a bar it is designed to make people not want to stay too long or spend too much!The people both servers and customers are very pretentious and for no real reason! Now I understand the mixed reviews. I just did not before. Oh and there seemed to be no heat!It seemed to be popular but on a hurricane weekend there are not a lot of places open in other neighborhoods so they get 2 stars for being open.

I ordered it once and will not order it again. You're eating more sauerkraut then sausage. I think they need to either add more to the dish, make it a side order or just remove it from the menu.

Thankfully light on cheese and heavy on incredible mushrooms.  The BAKED empanada was light and served with a delicious salad. The chefs are geniuses. That is not an overstatement. I am being restrained. Believe me.The staff is incredibly friendly and courteous, as mentioned already below, the owner is almost always around   wonderfully friendly and very responsive to customer input, and THE CROWD! Now that it's been open a little over three weeks, the place was full  on a Sunday of the kind of mix of people (including a lot of very happy kids scarfing some serious amounts of lemonade) that reminds you how fantastic Harlem is and that NYC is the most ethnically diverse city in the world (all here bound together by a shared love of great beer, wine, food, and gemuetlichkeit). Even if you don't care for great beer, come for the food. This place is a blessing bestowed upon Harlem and NYC by the beer and cuisine gods (who are also apparently mindful of decent pricing in the current economy).***************************************************************************I have been tracking the opening date for this place for WEEKS and got here on its third day in business.  The kitchen is not up and running yet but the beer is AMAZING (Czech (Krusovice), German (the only dark wheat draft  (Erdinger) I've had since I was in Germany plus Hofbrau), Belgian, and English.The vibe is wonderful too--  you ain't not gonna find a mix o'people like this anywhere else in Manahattan.  Finally, the service is incredibly friendly and from the nabe.  I am going back TOMORROW but wanted to get this up for all the Harlemites and anyone who loves great beer to see. (They have wine too).",5,,
87,Edgar B.,"New York, NY",0,56,0,4.0,3/3/2014,"I'm pretty happy about this place and have been here a couple dozen times or so since it opened. I commend the owners and managers for going out of their way to make me feel welcome and my picky restarauteur neighbor frequents here.Obviously, you go here for the beer. They know what they're doing with brews and serve (mostly) European beers, including Hofbrauhaus by the liter which is kind of nice. It's saying something that I'm an American IPA guy, but still like to come here and drink German Lagers until I'm swimmingly buzzed.It's a great place to go with a group, however you'll need to be strategic about timing since it can get crowded. I've also noticed that there are quite a few children here (as you probably should expect at a beer garden). That's a little bit of a turnoff to me, but I can mitigate it by avoiding the earlier hours. It can be impossible to hear at times, even if you're sitting next to someone and they're screaming in your ear.The food is okay and serves mostly as something to munch on while you drink. If you do it right, you should be spending at least 3x as much on the beer anyway.",,,
88,Kelli J.,"New York, NY",16,71,72,4.0,7/20/2013,"The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5-stars... it's cash-only.  Seriously, who doesn't accept cards in this day and age?!  I would probably spend a lot more money here, but I never have enough cash to cover it, so...  The last time I visited (which, admittedly, was about a year ago), they had finally installed an ATM, which was helpful, but c'mon!  You can afford to install a wall-mounted ATM, but can't set up a credit card machine?  Boooo!I am not really a beer drinker, but I enjoy this place.  I usually get the Fruli (a strawberry-flavored beer), and also this other drink with beer and Sprite (I forget the name).  I once came here with a pregnant friend and she tried the non-alcoholic options and really liked them.Surprisingly, the food is also VERY good here.  The truffle parmesan fries are incredible, the catfish tacos are so yummy, and I once had some sort of special with shrimp that was very tasty.  The sausages are also good if you're into that sort of thing.  I am not sure that I like the bench seating.  Its really hard to accommodate groups of people.  I get that they're going for the authentic German beer garden feel, but tables would make more sense.  Also, it gets CROWDED and there's not a lot of room to stand around while you wait for a space at the table.  Keep that in mind.My only other complaint -- and this is true of a lot of Harlem restaurants -- are the people who bring their kids to a restaurant that is called Bier... as in BEER... as in NOT FOR KIDS.  WTH?!  I don't want to be swilling beer while watching some kid in a high chair alternately gulping formula from a bottle and wailing his head off.  Not every restaurant is meant to be family-friendly.",,,

90,Ronda R.,"Manhattan, NY",36,79,14,4.0,12/1/2012,"You can easily pass a fun evening at Bier International. From the staff to the menu and the food itself, almost everything you encounter is first-rate. The only pitfalls are the extremely uncomfortable seats and the prices that are slightly too high.The menu has great descriptions, so it is easy for someone who doesn't know beers well by name (like me) to pick one that sounds interesting. And if you can't decide, the bartenders are very good at making recommendations and helping you figure out what to get. Since I usually drink more hard cider than beer but wanted to try something new, I was torn between the cider and Frueli, so the bartender ended up offering me a sip of each, and I went with the Frueli. I tried quite a few beers as well and thought they were all pretty good, but I'm no beer connoisseur, so I'll leave those reviews to someone else. Speaking of beer, the beers listed for $7 are only $5 during Happy Hour (M-F, 4-7)!All the food I tried was delicious. The mussels ($14) had a tinge of spice to them, and no matter whether you choose fries or bread as your side, the broth makes a great dipping sauce. The bread itself is light and fluffy -- perhaps a brioche. The fries are good, but if you're going to get fries, spring for the truffle fries! Now those are GOOD. The bratwurst and accompanying sauerkraut are both mouth-wateringly delicious -- and I don't even usually like sauerkraut -- but for the price ($11), it's not much food. The burger ($13) is also good. The bun is brioche-like and very tasty although not what I would choose for a burger. The patty itself, however, is divine! It is incredibly juicy and very well seasoned -- very peppery. It comes with a large serving of fries, too. The fries are good but nothing exceptional. There are also some good vegetarian options, like the Mediterranean platter ($12).As I mentioned earlier, the seats are very uncomfortable. Somehow they seem even worse than most benches and wooden chairs. If I were a regular, I'd invest in a cushion, but even though the food is very good and a night at Bier International is enjoyable, I doubt I'll become a regular. Even for all you get, it's still just too expensive.",1,,
91,Samantha M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,7,0,1.0,1/7/2014,"We came here for dinner on a weeknight, just trying out a new place in the neighbourhood, and I was very underwhelmed. I would most likely not return here, or recommend it to anyone. For a place branding itself as a beer venue, it's beer selection was surprisingly slim. There's a lot of other bars in the area that have a much larger range of beers available.To begin with, after ordering beers and food, we were told that not only were they out of their most popular tap beer, but that they were also out of 3 of the 8 sausages/bratwursts available. Over the course of the night (fairly quiet, there were only 2 other tables filled with a couple people at the bar), I also overheard our waitress telling another table that a different beer was out.We ended up with a burger and the Marrakech sausage. Burger was decent, and the sausage was pretty good, but for $13 for 3 pretty small sausages it was a little pricey. Our check was brought as soon as our plates were cleared, without asking if we wanted more drinks (remember, it was a quiet night, they were not looking to clear tables). Not only were we double charged for one of the beers that we ordered, but it was the beer that they had run out of. The check was sent back, and had to be returned again, because the waitress had only taken off one of the beers, and not corrected that it was the wrong beer entirely. It seems like this place has been around for a while, so maybe its winter season is lacking if it's managed to pull through for so long, or it's a better day time place. But my overall impression was that the staff was sloppy, and the kitchen and bar are embarrassingly understocked.",,,
92,George M.,"Woodside, NY",3,21,0,3.0,3/18/2014,"I've been here on many occasions and I'm somewhat torn.  You can't go wrong with the beer selections since there are so many options and the sampling option is terrific.But everytime I go and order food, I find myself still being hungry.  I ordered a sausage dish and it was HALF of ONE sausage?  And the price was worth at least two sausages.  The taste of the meats left me wanting more, whereas the truffle fries are DELICIOUS!!",,,

He proceeds to say, ""No vegetables or meat?"" I say -- ""who needs that when you have Bier's truffle fries?""I read about Bier in TimeOut NY Magazine, as it was named one of 50 Best Spring Bars and I am so glad I went.  Bier impressed me with its selection of domestic and international beer. The food was OK, but the truffle fries were awesome. My friend and I ordered the following beers:Pauwel Kwak: A drinkable amber ale with a light body.St. Feuillien Triple: This one came in a BIG glass and so I was happy with it. The food menu had a nice selection of sobering, German inspired options such as weiners and kraut, and beef brochettes...just to name a few. A fun and upbeat place for groups, dates, and dinner. I like that the overall look is not intimidating for those who are not familiar with German fare. Cheers to Bier!",,,

This would have been 5 stars if it weren't for the following:- Cash only ...ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Just to cheat on taxes, no other reason for this sh_t.- Super loud. By the time you get out of here, you have a sore throat from having to yell for the last hour. And your ears are ringing.- Poor brunch. They don't even have coffee; they try to serve you coffee from a pathetic machine. Cold and tasteless. I mean, if you're serving brunch, invest in a drip coffee machine, right?- Servers tend to have attitudes and a tendency to ignore you for a while.HOWEVER:- Delicious beer, great selection- Delicious food. I've tried and loved the following: Shrimp tacos, steak burger, German potato salad (out of this world), fries, pretzel, most of their sausages. - Nice atmosphere if you can sit outside and be away from the loudness.",1,,
96,Jordan B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",2,18,0,2.0,4/25/2012,"This is my second review of this place. I was a fan of bier since soft open, so I have watched them grow. In the beginning, it was one of my favorite local spots. The menu is great, the atmosphere WAS quiet and relaxed. Sadly, once word got out about Bier, it was overrun and turned into a circus by the new Harlem gentry and their toddlers and babies in strollers. I don't understand restaurants/ bars that allow families to bring noisy, needy small children. It ruins the atmosphere and should have no place in a bar where I go to drink a beer and enjoy myself after a long day. After months and months of trying to enjoy the great menu and beer selection here, I have stopped going. It's impossible to even think when you are surrounded by entitled, wealthy, vapid young families with kids who demand everyone's constant attention. Including the wait staff. They are a cross section of all the bad service available throughout harlem. They aren't trained properly and it takes a half hour to place a drink order. I have been forgotten completely after asking to pay the bill - on several occasions. Why do I bother with this joint? Oh, because it had potential. My recommendation: get some control over your staff, and put your foot down about guests who ruin the atmosphere. Also, you might think of putting some wood or foam on the walls and ceiling because the joint is LOUD. The place can be enjoyable on a monday at 4PM if you manage to beat the yuppie families. But the kitchen won't be open.",3,2,1

I am not a beer drinker but I like that they also have a selection of wine for us non beer drinkers. I also like the fact that the staff was knowledgeable of the beer that the serve and was able to offer me a light beer that I enjoyed for me trying beer for the first time. Both times that I went it was crowded (but what do you expect when you go there right after work on a Friday) despite it being crowded the wait staff were personable and although may have been overwhelmed didn't show it. There were also helpful in accommodating  such a large group of people in the outside seating. Both times I also had a meal, once i had a lamb burger which was really good and the other time I had a steak fritata and it was also delicious and reasonably priced. I really enjoy the place and will def visit again.",3,,

99,Caroline O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/9/2015,"This place is not even worth 1 star! I just ordered the steak which was totally inedible-tough and chewy. I sent it back, explaining my issues with it and was told they would take care of it. The same piece of steak was returned to me, cooked even more - I'm not sure how that was supposed to help make it easier to eat. The wait staff were less than helpful and offered me a $4 reduction...not great given that the steak cost $22 and I couldn't eat ANY OF IT.  I was told that since I ordered it, and ate it (all 1 mouthful), I would have to pay for it.  The wait staff seemed to be ruled by the kitchen and couldn't offer any assistance without checking with them first. The final result was 30% off the cost of the steak....and I'm still hungry.I'd say go for the beer and outdoor tables- they are nice. Avoid the food!!!",,,

The truffle fries are decent, but not nearly as good as they smell (and they will leave your clothes smelling funky). My main complaints with this place are: 1) seating can be tight, 2) it's expensive for being in Harlem, 3) as a result of number two, and the attitude of the owner or manager that hangs out around the place, the place has a snooty feel that doesn't belong in the hood (even a heavily gentrified area), 4) it's hard to interact with anyone who isn't part of your group, so it's lacks a social atmosphere.

They were very accomodating and got my friends and I (a group of 10, and when you see the size of this place, you can appreciate this more) a table right away! While ordering, some issues started to pop up, one (or two? i forget) beer was not available, there were not enough boots (big glass boots with up to 1 liter of beer) at the establishment, but we all ordered, whether people chose American beers (like the Bronx Pale Ale, which is really good and not very easily found) or European beers (like Delirium Tremens, Duvel, Hoffsbrau, or others including a strawberry flavoured beer that my girlfriend loved).The food was good, but not fantastic, two of my friends' ordered brats that were bland, small portion, and not so memorable. I had the wieners and kraut, good, filling, and a very generous helping of Kraut. Word of advice, get the kraut with bacon, the thick pieces of bacon work perfectly with the kraut and give a deliciuos taste! Also, the truffle fries with shaved parmesan were AMAZING!! Some of the food items were not available, but overall it was great service and quite fast getting the food and beer to us, so we were very satisfied!And as a tip, go there for your birthday, they give you a bottle of wine as a gift when you're leaving! #winning!",,,

Updated review","Just read my very short review from a year ago, my oh my have times changed!UPDATED:I came here on a Friday after work and tried the Bier Grand Sampling with 5 5oz samples of beer. I think I had Erdinger Dunkle, Erdinger Urweisse, Duvel, Delirium and the Krusovice. So nice I had to try it twice.I came back Sunday afternoon and had the Bier Grand Sampling again had the Jenlain, Krusovice, Deirium, Erdinger Urweisse and the Erdinger Dunkle. I think the Dunkle is slowly but surely becoming my favorite. It was getting ate so my friend and I decided to get something to eat, I had the Krainerwurst sausage and it was to die for. I love spicy food and mustard, the absolute best. I ordered the pretzels thinking I would get sourdough pretzel bits but they were 2 full freshly made pretzels! Communal tables are a still a bit weird for me, you're either forced into someones creepy conversation or you have people budding into yours, like this man did to my friend and I. Other than that, Bier is definitely becoming one of my favorite places to hang in Harlem.",,,
111,Imke v.,"New York, NY",6,33,3,2.0,10/26/2011,"Being German, we were really excited about this place coming to the neighborhood, but were disappointed. Sitting on uncomfortable wood benches, in a crowded room with the most horrible acoustics does not mean your in a German beer hall - sorry.  The people are friendly, but the beer selection is at best average, and slightly overpriced. What put it over the top for me though is the way they treat their ""German specialty"" food. We different kinds of food at different occasions, and besides the often mentioned truffle fries (yummy!), it was memorable only in a bad way. We ordered Wiesswurst for example, which is a white herb wurst, that is cooked and served whole in water. We got it cut into slices that had been grilled to death. In Bavaria you would be stoned to death for that. There are other places around the neighborhood were you can get good beer, decent food and still be able to hear what the other person is saying......If you absolutely have to go, try to sit outside(on those comfy metal chairs...) and stick to the truffle fries.",3,3,2

Luckily, they had the Knicks game on.  They offer a free mimosa for brunch. The atmosphere reminded me of an indoor beer garden (probably because of the bench style seating). They have a good selection of beer but we got cocktails instead, which ended up being surprisingly good. I ordered the currywurst which was ok. The crab cake benedict was good as well.

Of course coffee turned into beer, which turned into snacks, which turned into more beer...which turned into a great Saturday.I had some hofbrau oktoberfest special, and we split the mediterranean platter, the euro platter, and the truffle fries. The food was good and the beer was good, but I think what I really like about this place is the menu. And by that I don't mean the selection, although I thought that was pretty good too. The sizable beer list thoroughly described each option, and items on the dinner menu were accompanied with beer pairing suggestions, most of which seemed spot on. And in case you don't want one of those, the waitstaff is very knowledgeable and eager to please. This is the perfect place to go if you're not really sure what you're in the mood for.Suffice it to say I am a fan, and I am pretty excited to go back and try the international sausage platter with the bier grand sampling.",,,

I really liked the menu, the food, and the general experience, though I wasn't as enamored of the place as I had hoped to be. I wound up getting the Merguez sausage, which was definitely superb, with truffle fries on the side for an extra dollar. They were good, but very meager on the truffle and oil. From what I hear, if you want to avoid getting jipped you should order the full side-dish of Truffle Fries, which comes with a generous topping of truffle and parmesan. We also got a pretzel side dish, and though the pretzel was soft, it was undersalted for my personal taste, and I wasn't a fan of the mustard that came with it.

Beer Chia Pet maybe. Basically, it's small. For the crowd this place attracts be prepared for some wait time for a table. That being said, this place has such a good vibe to it. It's a great mixture of people that visit this spot. The beer selection is pretty good. Any place that has Erdinger and Delirium on tap is win for me. Beer comes in all sizes. Flights, 20oz, and even 1 to 2 liter boots! Naturally I opted for a boot.The food here is some of the best beer garden food I've ever had. Their truffle fries aren't fries with truffle sprinkled on them. They're more like giant flakes of truffles bedded over the fries. I swear they have a truffle garden on their roof or something. Needless to say we ordered 3 plates of those. They have a big selection of different sausages which were all delicious.This is a great addition to the growing Harlem food scene.

The food was so so-- I had a burger.

They are definitely dedicated to the beer selection, with suggestions throughout the menu, and service always in the intended glassware (my Kwak came in a large vial-type glass supported by a custom wood handle).My partner had a veggie quesadilla with a bit of truffle oil on it, which it was very hard not to steal all of once I had tried a bite. The only thing that kept me away from her food was the delicious catfish that were the centerpiece of the tacos I ordered.Very relaxed atmosphere and definitely a great place to stop in.

I was pretty stoked walking down FD to find a bike shop (woo hoo!) and some more diverse fare, but I guess I've been living/working up-up-uptown to notice the insane change in this neighborhood in just a few years...But this is a review about Bier International. My friend had been several times, and myself a fan of Astoria Beer Garden, was thrilled to hear there was one that didn't require me to jump the M60 over to *gasp* Queens. I figured a Saturday evening, looking forward to some communal tables to perhaps meet some other folk, was going to be delightful. I love kids. Don't get me wrong. Call me a monster, but we were seated in between two different couples with toddlers under 2 years old and it... sucked. At 8pm on a Saturday night at a beer garden. I'd love to think when I am older and have kids that I'd still be able to go and grab a few pints with the friends here and there. And I'd hire a babysitter so that myself, and the people around me, would enjoy their Saturday evening. The kids weren't obnoxious, but it definitely taints the vibe here. Needless to say, I had a few bites to eat, two pints and was on my way out. I was not alone in feeling this way as I overheard several people outside chatting who had the same sentiments. Really? 8pm on a Saturday night out at a BEER garden ordering apple juice? Not good for business or those who want to chat about whatever without getting nasty looks.As mentioned earlier, parm fries with truffle oil a delight. Empanadas were... meh. But the beer in the individualized mugs were a nice touch and the waitstaff were friendly, though clearly annoyed by the high % of toddlers in the room, too. Doesn't have to be war, but can't the 20/30 somethings w/o kids claim this after 8pm? I mean US kids, not your kids.Not sure I'll be back. I've heard toddler sightings are not rare even past 10pm.",2,1,1

So we all ordered the burger. They only have one on the menu, but you can choose from many cheeses, which is nice. The waiter was pleasant and chatty, but he neglected us after taking our initial order. We had to ask several times for napkins, and one of my friends never got the water she asked for, despite bringing it up to the waiter four or five times. Also, they were out of the beer that was recommended to pair with the burger, so our waiter suggested a different, lighter beer that was terrible with the meal.The burgers themselves were pretty good, but of the five orders, three of them were messed up. That's not so good. I would have probably given the entire thing two stars, but after complaining to the manager, he gave us a 20% discount on our bill, which was very generous and we appreciated it.

Out of the ones I tried, I liked the Riessdorf Kolsch the best. It had a refreshing, clean taste, not too heavy or hoppy. Loved the selection of beer snacks, too - I had the currywurst with fries, and fries with parmesan and truffle oil, yum! So what if the food's not fancy? It goes well with the alcohol, and truth be told, that's what really counts after a hectic 7-hour day spent standing on your feet.

The hamburger could have been better- I like mine medium but it turned out to be well-done, which is a no-no. But, all is not lost, I mean, if you're there not to have a big meal, you're in good hands and if you're like me and love sauces, ask for their chipotle hot sauce and mustard sauce-- it makes eating fries all the more fun.  For newbies, check out their beer sampling.",,,

Seriously? I've never had that experience so far with any other establishment during the World Cup. If you are planning to go there to watch the finale this Sunday, keep that in mind. I could think of better ways to spend my money than to pay entry for an average establishment to watch a World Cup match.The staff is nice, but they are often confused. The bartender overcharged me twice for beers during Happy Hour. She then notified my friend that her beer - the particular size that she had ordered - did not apply for Happy Hour. This after she had said all beers are discounted on the menu. I found this a little deceitful. And unlike most places, the tax is not included in the prices, which I find weird since every other establishment in this city charges a flat price for the beers. So after two hours, change was piling up on the counter.Anyway, I've been here numerous times hoping to have a better experience but it's just not meant to be. They keep disappointing me.

There are some solid options (Kwak, Duvel Green, Dunkel) and I like that they have the appropriate glass for each beer.   The wine selection is slim and not great.  Is it too much to ask that a place have good beer selections AND good wine selections?  I have yet to find such a place.Food-wise, the yucca fries are really, really good  (Bonus, they pair nicely with beer.  Any beer).  The croque-monsieur is sinful, in the way that it is more like french toast with melty cheese and thick slabs of ham.  This can either be a good thing, or a very, very bad thing.  The bratwursts are pretty good, but the plate is heavy on the fries, light on the meat, which is less than satisfying.The communal tables offer plenty of opportunity to befriend your neighbor and the bartenders/waitstaff have been, for the most part, friendly and knowledgeable.  And yes, as other reviewers have noted, CASH ONLY (but there are ATMs within the block).",,2,

Try the Crab Cakes Benedict or the Pancakes with cornmeal at brunch and enjoy a free mimosa along with it--how incredible! The beer selection is large and impressive. The Hofbrau is a personal fave. If you are not a beer drinker, they offer wine and delicious champagne cocktails.I also love the customer service. Everyone there is very welcoming and accommodating. I especially like the server Jeff. He is always very friendly and professional.

169,Dale C.,"New York, NY",2,8,0,3.0,4/2/2011,"I want to give this place 5stars, but the noise level in here honestly had my ears ringing when I left.  I understand the feel the place is going for, but maybe get some fabric on the walls to cut the volume down.  I expect to have to yell to the person across from me in a dance club, not in a restaurant.   I was also surprised by the large amount of pretentious, self-righteous hipster families with infants in the place.  I know you shouldn't rate a place by it's clientele, but  here's an excerpt from the family next to us:  Mom: ""honey, could you move your beer away from the baby, I don't want him to see it.""  Um, hello, if you don't want your 10 month old baby to see a glass of beer, then don't bring him to a BEER GARDEN restaurant!I really, really want to like this place, but the noise and the clientele is unfortunately going to prevent me from returning.",,1,
170,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,4.0,10/2/2010,"Bier is a great addition to the neighborhood. I like the diversity of the clientele and the beer selections. Even when it's crowded, it's not too overwhelming, and you can actually hear your friends talk. The prices are on the higher side, and I'd say most of the beers you've probably heard of, but it's super sweet with super cute bartenders.",2,,1
171,Monique S.,"New York, NY",124,92,13,4.0,11/30/2010,"If you like bier and have a flair for things international, trust me, you are going to dig this bar.Since moving to New York, I seem to have developed this weird predisposition for bench seating. Perhaps its me clamoring for intimacy in this atomized city-- I like sitting on the subway too-- something about rubbing elbows with random people gives me a thrill. Bier International certainly does not disappoint in this regard and the elbows you rub up against seem to be pretty chill -- an obvi plus. Now I am no aficionado, but I enjoyed each of the Belgian beers I tried and was oh so very tempted by their appetizer menu (next time I'll make sure to work up an appetite beforehand). This is a great and desperately needed addition to the Harlem scene.When to visit: to meet friends, to hang out, to relax, and to discuss unimportant matters. CASH only.",1,,1
172,Jamal P.,"New York, NY",1,28,0,4.0,12/13/2012,"The beer and steak burger was great.  The bartender is friendly.  I'm glad this is in my neiborhood.  If your not sure what type of beer you want, just get the sampler.  You can thank me later.",1,,1
173,Monica C.,"Manhattan, NY",77,20,13,5.0,12/10/2013,The bartender was very nice and helpful when it came down to choosing a beer.  The food was so yummy.  The music was great and the crowd was mixed and laid back.,,,
174,Marilyn S.,"Manhattan, NY",20,78,2,3.0,12/17/2010,"Fun place in the summer when they have the doors open, but it's just too noisy otherwise.  They've got to do something about the acoustics.Great food and beers though and a nice change of scenery in the neighborhood.",1,,
175,Sarah W.,"Somerville, MA",12,9,0,4.0,9/1/2010,"I was so so excited when I heard this place was opening in my 'hood and have been more or less hanging around outside their door for weeks checking on the progress (it helps that it is practically on my corner). I went there last night for the first time around 7pm and it was packed and hoppin' with (I hope) local young'uns.  My friend and I were able to find the corner of a communal table with no problem and the help of the friendly and attentive waitress.  The high ceiling, white walls, and open front gave the place an authentic beer garden feel, despite being inside, although it did get a bit echo-y.The service was super friendly and neighborhoody, with the waitress and manager stopping to chat despite the crowd.   The beer selection was good; the waitress not only let me know that the beer I wanted had just been tapped and so would be warm, but suggested a comparable alternative.  The food was tasty and I loved that all of the menu items had suggested beer pairings. The catfish tacos with chipotle mayo were good, if a little small; the catfish was perfectly grilled, moist and flavorful and not breaded - hooray!  The truffle parmesan fries were crispy and tender with large curls of cheese and actual black truffle (rather than just truffle oil) sprinkled over top.  And, at $8 and $4 respectively, very reasonable.Overall Bier is a wonderful, chill, tasty, neighborhood spot in which I will now be living!",3,,1
176,Megan H.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",47,66,0,4.0,8/5/2011,"Many varieties of German beer and decent selection of wine. Really good food - traditional German wursts and sides as well as a surprising amount of vegetarian options (truffle fries and pineapple guac are both delish!). This is a cool place to get a drink on the weekend -very chill. Reminder, this place is cash only - kind of annoying.",,,
177,Zoraida C.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,51,28,3.0,1/31/2011,"Went hear on a date on a Saturday night. Cool place. Very loud, not from the music ; but the loud talking. We sat at the bar, the kitchen had just closed when we walked in ; 11:pm.The atmosphere is cool, decor cool, the service good. I will be going back to taste the food.",,,2
178,Stephanie W.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",4,22,0,3.0,7/21/2011,"I love seeing places like this uptown. Came here while I was living in Washington Heights with a group of six people on a Saturday night. Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. Got the Bier Flight with all light drafts, so good! My favourite was the draft that started with a ""K"" and sounded kind of like ""cheviche"". It tasted like flowers. Bayerische Bratwurst with sauerkraut was good, though my palette is not so familiar with German cuisine. Cash only and it's very loud. There's not any banks in plain sight, so plan ahead unless you want to pay ATM fees. Also the server was hard to find sometimes.",,,
179,Ken C.,"New York, NY",0,103,3,4.0,7/25/2015,Good beer place on the UWS/Harlem area.  Nice selection of beers and decent pretzels.  Friendly staff and atmosphere- nice place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon.,,,
180,Joey M.,"Manhattan, NY",11,112,0,5.0,9/2/2010,"You walk down Frederick Douglass Blvd. and you notice an unassuming and intriguing store front.  You peek in and you see the word 'bier' written on a wall that's majestically overlooking long and rustic wooden tables as well as a stone top bar a little off to the right.  You're rightfully intrigued and you decide to walk in.Maybe you'll take a seat at the bar and look over their draft and bottle list.  Most likely you were greeted by the friendly bartender who hands you the beer list and food menu.  You may smile a bit when you see that there are things like Six Point Sweet Action, HB Hofbrau Original, Fuller's London Pride and Duvel Green on tap.  Or, you may wonder what beer rock star came up with this handpicked beer selection as you peruse another well selected bottle list consisting of Leffe Blonde, Blue Point Toasted Lager and a Fuller Vintage Ale.So you grab a beer.  Then you notice the menu has things like bratwurst, beef kebabs and truffle fries and see the little annotations suggesting beer pairings with the food.  The bartender probably walks up to you and demonstrates his unpretentious knowledge regarding the beers by describing beers in a way that a beer geek and non-beer geek would enjoy.  He makes you feel at home.You order food, it comes, and you realize that you may be in one of the most awesome places in Harlem, let alone maybe in the whole City of New York.  You finish your meal, grab a few more beers and leave mesmerized.",2,,
181,Vince N.,"Scottsdale, AZ",486,84,2,4.0,4/15/2013,Pretty cool place in a cool neighborhood. I came her recently to meet up with my German side of the family and it was worth the trek. Had a beer that was mixed with soda. It was actually really refreshing! The decor inside is awesome as well.,,,
182,Valerie F.,"Jackson Heights, NY",231,144,0,4.0,7/16/2013,"Really liked this place!  Good beer selection, communal seating, breezy.  My team took this over after a big event.  The sangria was a bit weak but very tasty.  Music was provided by a DJ, really set the mood well.  I would totally come back.",,,
183,Mariam A.,"New York, NY",0,29,1,2.0,7/26/2012,"I'm not a beer drinker, nor did I try any of the beers, so take this review with that in mind.Food was just okay, and over-priced considering the small portions. Restaurant was incredibly loud and had trouble hearing my friends that were sitting right next to me. Cash only. Servers were very nice and accommodating, but I won't be going back.",1,1,1
184,Michael J.,"New York, NY",118,38,0,3.0,8/15/2013,"Good selection of beers and the food is good too. Delirium Tremens, Truffle/Parm fries and shrimp tacos were an excellent combo.

185,Alejandro N.,"Manhattan, NY",4,6,0,3.0,8/14/2013,"Their beer selection: Excellent! Different! Their bratwursts: Delicious. I give them only 3 stars because the music they play is so darn loud for such a small place. It becomes very annoying to have a conversation, and it's like that every night.",,,
186,Jonathan S.,"Manhattan, NY",620,9,11,4.0,9/7/2012,"My finacee and I are thrilled to have this modern, fun bar in our neighborhood.  They have an excellent selection of international beers on tap and the wait staff and bartenders are amazingly friendly and outgoing.  The bar food is also really excellent.  Only drawback is that they only take cash, but they do have an ATM in house.",1,,
187,Michael B.,"New York, NY",6,15,0,5.0,11/15/2010,Finally... South Harlem gets a bar/restaurant that actually has a great menu (food-wise AND price-wise) that's realistic than most of the newer joints along FDB (Eighth Avenue). Seriously people... If any of you are thinking of opening a restaurant/cafe/bar/etc. along FDB - PLEASE visit Bier International to see how it's done right.,,,1

189,Isabel G.,"New York, NY",71,29,0,4.0,4/24/2011,"First went to this place on a Friday night with my cousin and her friend. The place was packed, but the host kept us informed of how long for a table and helped us find a place to sit at the bar.The beer selection is vast, that's a given, but I was in the mood for wine. They had the basics and were very accommodating and let us taste a few wines before deciding on one.When we were seated, the waitress came over relatively quickly to take our order. I had the beef Brochettes Daharolse and the meat was super tender. The peanut butter sauce complemented the beef very well. The portions are large, so be ready to share.The one negative point is the loudness of the place. There's no sound dampening and every voice just reverberates. Not good for trying to catch up.This place is around the corner from my apartment and I know I'll come back because the food is good and the people that work there are nice, but I hope they do something about the noise.",,,
190,Brandon H.,"New York, NY",22,19,2,5.0,4/18/2011,"The brunch that they have is SOOOO good. The steak and eggs as well as the pancakes are as good as it gets. The bartender was awesome. Talking to us and joking around.  Making great beer suggestions.Now granted, kids are noisy and they suck, BUT, my suggestion is sit at the bar. It'll help with the noise level.",,,

193,Mark J.,"New York, NY",0,22,1,3.0,3/22/2013,"Nice but overpriced for the quality. The open air cafe (a la bier garden) is nice, the beer and brat selection is decent, but your plate is mostly filled with fries or potato salad. The prices are high for the area. Try ""Zum Schneider"" in the east village for a better deal.",,,
194,Madeline N.,"Cambridge, MA",42,279,26,4.0,11/13/2010,"Swung by for dinner with a friend on Friday night and had an awesome currywurst (bratwurst, fries, curry sauce) and Hefe-weiss. Why didn't someone else think of currywurst?! As a person who loves hot-dog/sausage products it was a wonderful combination. A little loud - it's more of a bar than restaurant at 10:30 PM - but we found a place to sit without too much trouble. Attentive servers, quick service, and inexpensive (total bill of 2 currywursts, 2 beers = $22). Really nice crowd of eclectic 20- and 30-somethings who all seemed to live in the neighborhood.",,,
195,Chuck B.,"Manhattan, NY",259,16,2,1.0,2/2/2013,Terrible service! Waiting 15 minutes to get a menu and be greeted by a server is unacceptable. Waiting 30 minutes for a glass of water is even worse.,,,

198,Brandi C.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",1,41,0,5.0,10/11/2010,"I finally got around to trying Bier and was not disappointed. We arrived just after brunch but before the kitchen opened for the in-between time. The waitress left a food menu and promised to let us know when the kitchen reopened. And she did.In the meanwhile, we ordered a sampler and Sugar Hill. The 5oz serving sizes are perfect to get an idea of what you like and what to avoid, since you won't find the usual suspects of Heineken and Stella on tap. Also, the draft beers come in a variety of sizes, so you aren't stuck with a pint when .3l is more than enough. Every beer comes in the appropriate glass, so you'll get to enjoy all of the notes and flavors as they were intended.The food far exceeded my expectations. The Truffle Parmesean cheese fries were stellar. I felt bad for the guy at bar eating his with ketchup! It truly didn't need it.The mushroom quesadilla was light and fluffy, not too cheesy, great variety of mushrooms, just amazing.The hummus platter was also fantastic. The hummus was spicy, the tabouli was light and not overdressed and the babaganoush was smoky.We agreed it was loud but it's a bier garden! I was also surprised by the number of kids present, lots of strollers but thankfully no crying babies! Also, the bathroom was spotless, thank goodness!Our waitress was patient, explained different options and offered suggestions.The only surprise came when the check arrived and we discovered it was cash only, so come prepared. But nothing is overpriced, the beer and food were lovely and they offer wine for the non-beer drinkers.I'm looking to try the strawberry beer next.",,,
199,Erin R.,"New York, NY",3,6,0,4.0,4/2/2011,"The food and beer were so great but it was so loud! Much louder than what should be comfortable for a beer garden. Also, it must have been family hour or something while we were there because there was an infant and it's hipster parents at each table. Hipster babies scare me. Seriously, we were practically pushed out of a table by this other party who kept having people show up and push everyone down the table and then the mother started freaking out when someone put a beer stein in front of the 8 month old, luckily we had finished eating and just left. I'm sorry I just hate it when parents bring babies into loud bars and then have them scream the whole time. DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS TO A BAR!But again, food and drink delicious! I guess I would say go really late when there is less likely a chance for there to be kids there.",,,
