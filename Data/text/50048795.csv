0,Yucca F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,62,44,4.0,11/7/2018,"MealPal: Roasted lemon chickenBowl with brown rice, kale, broccoli, mashed potato and this really big portion of chicken (one thigh and one drumstick).  Very nice cafe off 41 street; on the quieter side because it was around residential area and less the commercial side like 42 St can be. I love the chicken. It made my day. Date: November 7, 2018",,,
1,Tina M.,"Queens, NY",154,93,980,4.0,8/27/2018,"Ordered via Mealpal. Portion was good for lunch,  not too heavy but not teeny tiny. A little too much quinoa vs chicken ratio and there was ZERO harissa flavor, but the extra tzatziki on the side made up for it. Saw some other good meal options,  so may check it out again.",3,,1
2,Courtney P.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,8,0,1.0,10/31/2018,This place could be good but its not. They're very slow (give double the amount of time estimated for your order when picking up) and the food is just terrible. I have had better airplane food before.,,,
3,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,3.0,9/4/2017,"No perceptible difference between the old Blue Olive and its replacement, Mezze. Blue Olive was marketed as a Mediterranean ""market"" where you could get hot Greek food on an actual ceramic plate with real silverware, even with no waitservice. As Mezze, I think they just decided to rebrand. Prices and food are the same, but they rearranged the layout. You still get stations for sandwiches, salads, baked goods, coffee, etc. Curiously, there are separate display cases for bottled beer and fresh vegetables (actually for sale?).They're not too crowded at the height of lunchtime. The open seating is good for a casual work lunch, for days when going to any other spot without a tablecloth feels like slumming it. It's clean but not slick, with a bright, business-peer-appropriate atmosphere. The coffee is meh and no staff is ever friendly.This is my lazy salad spot - $10 after tax includes as many add-ins as you like. No BS about ""get 4 essentials and then 1 premium but if you do a cartwheel then you get one extra premium but only if you bring your own bowl."" The only thing that will increase your salad price is adding a meat item. I love when the world gives that rare nod to the vegetable-lovers among us.",3,2,3
4,Daniella L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,90,42,1.0,3/5/2018,"no, no, and no! I will never ever order from this place again. The food is horrible and service. They basically did not have what my coworker and I ordered. If you're going to advertise something on your website, make sure you have the items or ingredients. Ugh!",1,1,1
5,Antanina K.,"New York, NY",26,29,7,3.0,7/30/2018,"Just had my lunch at this place and it was nice, fresh and delicious (had a harissa chicken rice bowl). However, when I ordered an almond croissant, I was really disappointed. It was stale, hard as a stone. Took it back to the register but was told that it was fresh, that all their almond croissants were hard because of the cream filling inside (makes no sense, really). They did toast it for me instead of just giving me my money back, but that didn't help in any way. I really don't understand why old pastries are being served to customers in the first place, and why cashiers are lying about the freshness of the products. Things like this can really hurt business, especially in the oversaturated NYC food and restaurant market.",,,
6,Stella C.,"Brick, NJ",52,62,58,1.0,1/29/2018,"The food is okay, but the staff is crap. We asked for coffee w/ cream and sugar and we both got black coffees... whatever... find a dunkin...",,,
7,morgan a.,"New York, NY",3,28,2,1.0,10/16/2017,"I purchased a coffee at this cafe and sat in the back to do some reading (the place was dead) and the woman came over to me and asked me to move because I'm taking up a whole table. I said I was a paying customer and was just trying to enjoy my coffee. She rolled her eyes and asked me how long I'd be staying and I said I wasn't sure but could leave when it gets busy but it's empty right now and she said ""yes do that."" Worst customer service ever. Will never be coming back here I said. She said ""yes great."" It's clearly packed:",2,,
8,Ryan F.,"Manhattan, NY",1604,723,8116,4.0,2/22/2017,"Mezze recently opened in the space of Blue Olive and brought with it much of the bright space and open layout.  Here, you'll find a variety of food stations with general seating in the center of the space.  If you're looking for higher end Greek and more artisanal items, Mezze is a great spot, but are you seeking is a quick breakfast sandwich you might find their prices for little high compared to the regular convenient stores.",7,2,2
9,Kelly H.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,3.0,8/28/2018,Airport quality food with airplane prices. Falafel is hard and dry. So many better options in NYC.,,,
10,Alina B.,"New York, NY",4,70,13,4.0,11/16/2017,"Good lunch spot, plenty of variety and tucked away in the heart of midtown so the lines are not long and you can actually sit and eat your meal.",,,
11,Wendy R.,"Flemington, NJ",0,6,0,5.0,4/25/2018,"This place is awesome! The custom chopped salad is $8.75 and you choose a salad green and then unlimited toppings from about 50 choices (sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, artichokes, stuffed grape leaves, roasted red peppers, etc. and about 6 different cheeses.) Protein cost more. The place was hopping at lunch!",,,
12,Will P.,"New York, NY",7,137,1,4.0,3/26/2018,"I really like this place, I come here probably three or four times a week for lunch. Very consistent, good, authentic food. I typically get a soup and sandwich, but their burgers and salads are pretty good, too.",,,
13,Amol P.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,6/14/2017,I do not recommend Mezze. The food is terrible and the staff is rude. I was a regular customer there. The manager said they were receiving complaints from servers that I was staying for too long (i was mainly a user of wifi). They should be grateful they have somebody (anybody!) going to their empty restaurant! truly bizarre way to treat a regular! The owners and managers walk around and act like they don't need the business. And they probably don't. how is this place alive if they are empty all day every day? I would not be surprised if it were a mob front.,1,1,
14,Alison M.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,12/8/2017,I just walked in at 430 and they were basically closed and had like three platters of old sad looking food out. It says this place is open until 7 today. AVOID,,,
