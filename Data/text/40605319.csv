Their menu has a large selection of choices which included pizza, breakfast, sandwiches, salads, pastas, etc. The food that I ordered was okay- not the best, not the worst. I ordered a chicken souvlaki which came with fries, Greek salad and pita bread. They put the pita bread on the bottom of the chicken which made the bread soggy. Overall, an okay place to eat when you're hungry. The wide variety on the menu made me question what their specialty was. But anyways, the staff was nice and friendly and very accommodating. Food wasn't the best but that's okay.",1

In a sarcastic tone while holding my rejected pizza in his hands-- offering no other solution.  They also refused to serve tap water requiring me to purchase a bottle of water despite the fact that I had just purchased a soft drink.  THEN we go to check out (no credit on the check for uneaten, inedible pizza) and they required a cash payment stating they had no credit card machine-- but failed to tell us of this fact prior to ordering.  They had a sign taped to the register directing patrons to use THEIR ATM machine located in their store.  And THEN it began raining-- and while waiting for our uber to pick us up--the manager LOCKED THE DOOR to keep people from coming in to escape the rain--apparently because only 2/3rds of the clientele were ordering food.  I had to instruct him NOT to falsely imprison me in his yrestaurant.  Totally unbelievable behavior.  Rude management, poor food, desire to maximize profit without concern for their patron.  AVOID this place--it will ruin your day",

We were still considering if we wanted to eat here when she pressured us to order. We felt rushed to order and she seemed extremely irritated when we couldn't make a decision. We ordered a few slices which were about $4 each (what??). So we received our pizza and it was absolute trash. I ordered a combination pizza, which was literally just a pepperoni pizza with BOILED mushrooms placed on top and falling off. They didn't even bake it with mushrooms on, but just threw them on top of a pepperoni. Similarly, the buffalo chicken pizza was just a cheese pizza with tiny buffalo chicken bits thrown on top. You're better off getting a $1 slice somewhere else!",

The pizza was great, slices and the large pie we ordered were smaller than traditional New York slices. I had to remove a star for the bathroom experience. We were told that someone was on the bathroom and so my husband nor son could not use it. Truth was, they would only unlock it after we placed our full order. We all finally get to the bathroom and it was not worth the wait, the bathrooms unfortunately smelled badly and  were not clean, not to mention the weird setup on the ladies room. I'd go back if I was in the neighborhood, but would be sure to use the bathroom elsewhere before coming in.",

I was greeted with a warm, genuine smile and served quickly. I loved their Christmas decor/music, family photos on the walls, and the pizza was affordable and delicious.

From the taste to just the way it looks, it's a disappointment to all NYC pizza establishments everywhere. The other night I had gone to a friends place for pizza. From the first bite, I knew it was from 42 without even having to ask. The sauce is sweet and watery, the crust is limp and soggy. The area between the crust and the sauce is slimy.   Out of politeness I had a few bites and put it aside.There are a million other options out there, including Dominos. Try all of them!",3

She told us just tell her the number on the menu when we tried to order! The price was higher but fair, it's in the city and we get that.  However the quality of the food is very poor!  Pizza slice was smaller and burned on the bottom.  The green leaf vegetable inside the salad was super not fresh and no washed well!  We told the waitress about the salad but she seems didn't  understand English.  Well, we were just visitors and will never go back to that restaurant.  Another worse part is they do not accept credit card! Who doesn't accept credit card nowadays?  I was glad I had cash on me!  I told the cashier what if I didn't have cash? He said there's atm in the front! Who carries atm cards around ?  So, if you ever into the area for your chinese visa, passport, or visiting the pier 84, intrepid museum, make sure you do not go into this restaurant for your quick lunch!  Avoid this place!",

The dish too was unsavory.There are signs in the restaurant that the rest rooms are out of order, but they are open to customers. There are also signs that the machine accepting credit cards is out of order, so diners must pay in cash. We wasted about $60 on this sub-par fare. We would have done better at a restaurant further east during its restaurant week specials. This is no way to run an establishment.",

The Navy was very welcomed by many restaurants but this was not one of them. We were on duty (meaning we cant leave the ship) so we decided to order pizza from here for delivery. After an attempt at ordering I noticed that their hours stated that they werent open on Sunday and so I didnt think anything of it. I then received a phone call telling me that the delivery guy had been waiting for 30 minutes outside my door... 1. They didnt call me to tell me that they were there. 2. Someone went down to the pier immediately after they called to get the pizza amd no one was there. And 3. Ships dont have doors for you to knock on.... The delivery person stood outside of someone elses door for 30 minutes with our pizza after I gave the exact address to the pier, the pier number and the name of the ship. If you can miss a 844 foot ship, you dont need to have a job! During all of this, instead of picking up the phone to call me, they proceeded to email me and tell me I am to blame for the delivery guy missing many other orders and losing business for them. They never refunded my money, never responded back to my emails and I definitely didnt get my pizza. NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE. IT IS A HORRIBLY RAN BUSINESS.UPDATE: After I posted this review I was emailed and informed that I was unfair and that once again it was my fault that the pizza was never delivered to me. Never.

But when we saw the prices on the menu, everyone except me decided to only order a drink. The shop owner scolded my mother for lying and breaking their rules. They had a rule that people eating only pizza and having beverages need to sit at the front of the store. 1 of us had food from the menu but they were unhappy. If their prices weren't that high, we might've gotten more food. Not only was the food terrible, the way they talked to us was unacceptable. We are never coming back for sure",1

Neither of the foods were anything to write home about, but they hit the spot.The only main issue was the language barrier.

At 42nd Street Pizza the gyro meat is great with a good mix of spices. The fries are also very good. Not too crispy and not too soggy.While called 42nd Street Pizza the menu is actually closer to that of a NYC Diner, with dozens of different items on the menu. So if you go there with a group there should be an option for everyone. The prices are in line with most of the other diners in the area.As mentioned, this is a real family owned and operated restaurant and it shows. The place is spotlessly clean, and the owner and his wife are very friendly.My only negative is that I wish they had Coke Zero so I don't feel as guilty when eating the Gyro's and baklava!

As I got off the red beautiful boat me and my family decided to a long walk from Pier 83 towards the 42nd street area... As I passed by many fast food joints along the way in 42nd street area of New York and then by accident I discovered the 42nd Street Pizza Restaurant!!! I said to myself hey I wanna try this Pizza Joint... As I walked in for the first time to the 42nd Street Pizza Place... And then I said to myself once again this is it!!! I found a good pizza place of New York City to eat at!!! And now this is what I ordered it was a large sized sausage pizza and wooooooooow it tasted really good!!! 42nd Street has a good selection of pizza slices to choose from...

A friendly looking hostess was standing on the sidewalk so we decided to give it a try. We thought ""Hey, let's support a locally owned restaurant!"" The menu is very pricey for the casual, Greek diner atmosphere they provide. We decided to get a slice of pizza each, but she continued to try and up-sell us to salads and full meals. When we told the waitress we were sure we only wanted pizza, her attitude turned a bit sour towards us. Our pizza arrived and it wasn't bad - it was just very simple and generic, and not worth the $3.75 price tag for a plain slice. This place doesn't cater to New Yorkers. It's clear they are more interested in price-gouging the tourists. The $0.99 pizza places serve better slices. I would recommend you go there instead.

Then to realize that there was no debit or credit and then had to pay an extra $2.50 on top of our $36 for an ok slice pizza a piece and not so good salad, let alone with the baklava we needed a steak knife for, as it was Nuked in the microwave. We wont be coming back there ever! We will be going to little Italy for pizza next time we are in the city! Sorry just wasn't a good experience after a very long day of walking! Only because I have to give it a star to have this review visible it is getting a 1 star. :( :(",1

Somehow they even messed up garlic cheese bread. The prices are reasonable if the food had been edible, but I feel like I just threw away $20.",3

I paid $15 for that lasagna, which was small, and they give me a ""side"" salad! huge plate of ugly salad. I'm willing to pay $15 for a lasagna but not for a disgusting mix of flavorless pasta and marinara sauce without any good cheese, or just any cheese at all. Stay away!",2
58,2,5/20/2010,106,,"Manhattan, NY",Chetan P.,2,4.0,126,"I'm a fan.  4.5 stars.Food: I got the medium cheese + peperoni delivered. Pretty darn good pizza, but not the typical thin crust you see in the highly rated pizza joints.  Taste is very good, the sauce is sweet and there is something that makes you want to keep eating it.  The pie was cheesy, oily and loaded with pepperonis.  The crust has pretty good potential, but was soft by the time I got it delivered (just like most places).  I am definitely going back.Extra POINTS: 5 StarsWith my delivery, I got a hand written note saying that if I like the food to leave a review.  It also came with a soda, on the house.  On a day where the hustle and bustle of times square makes you disgusted with other human beings, the hand written note made my day.  The soda on-the-house was the point that made this go to 4.5 stars.I will be updating the review again.",7

62,32,9/8/2009,14,,"Palo Alto, CA",Dan G.,36,5.0,86,"I know it's kind of a faux pas to give a restaurant five stars without eating there; t's a place I doubt most Yelpers will ever go out of their way to eat. In any case, I did want to give credit to the owners and employees of this humble restaurant.Sometime ago, I either dropped my wallet or was pickpocketed while in Times Square. That was about the worst feeling I've had since I lived in New York, thinking about the $100 in cash that I had just withdrew and having to reapply for my drivers license and credit cards. Not to mention my Starbucks Gold card. And then it started to pour, and then I suddenly sympathized with all the people claiming just to need $0.50 more to get on the bus to home...I would've given them money if my wallet hadn't been stolen.Anyway, as I was walking home, I realized someone had been trying to call me for the last 20 min. I picked up and it was a man who said he worked at some place with ""42nd"" in the name and a flag in front of the door, and that he found my wallet with my business cards. I thought, ""Oh cool, someone on 42nd St. near Times Square dropped my wallet off at the nearest restaurant."" The man corrected me, saying that they were near 12th ave. I didn't even know 42nd st. went that far, but whatever, I was glad someone found my wallet.So about an hour later, I've walked to 42nd St., passed Times Square, and realized that 12th Ave. was way west, and for the restaurant to be near there, it would practically have to be on the water. Then I started to think it was some kind of set-up where someone would jump me as soon as I walked in, because how could my wallet end up a mile away from where I lost it? I thought maybe some tourists had picked it up, taken a tour bus all the way west, and dropped it off at the nearest restaurant...but 42nd Pizza was in the middle of nowhere...I can't imagine it does much business except for the police station nearby.Well, I go in and the owner enthusiastically shows off my wallet and pointing out that everything is still in there, the cards, the money, everything. I did a quick check and it looked like all the money, more than $120 was in there, plus all my cards. Of course I had to ask how they got the wallet in the first place, and one of the staff piped up, saying that some young men had come in with the wallet, sat down and ate, and left, forgetting my wallet behind. The waiter picked it up and the owner was wise enough to look for my business cards. In the meantime, from the hour it took me to walk all the way back, the men who had somehow gotten my wallet came back and demanded it back. But the owner, by his account, told them too bad, he already called the wallet's real owner.The only thing that made me happier about getting my wallet back was thinking about how dejected those bad Samaritans were, to think they had all that money in their hands and now were being shit-canned by a small restaurant owner with integrity. I didn't eat there, the pizza didn't look the best, but I bought a bottled drink and gave a big tip. I can't recommend the food without having tried it, but I can vouch at least for the honesty of the staff.",15

You are from Detroit and this New York Pizza will never be better? Any new york pizza is world class. It's the best pizza on earth and nothing beats it period. It's a fact and a pride to all New Yorkers. So, don't come here and try to make your absurd statement, comparing your shit Detroit pizza to a New York slice because that's the most retarded thing you could say. Anyway, I'm quite surprised that this place has so little reviews. I've ordered from here through seamlessweb.com and they were amazing. They deliver very quickly, and it's good quality pizza for the price. Of the delivery pizzas, I think this was by far the best I had in the city. Their toppings are always plentiful, sauces are semi sweet, which really makes you keep wanting it, cheese is good quality and the dough is soft. One thing I didn't like was the crust. It was too soft, but that didn't stop the pizza from being ridiculously good. I would definitely keep ordering from here and if you haven't tried, I suggest you should. And Deprina G. for the love of God, don't write shit comments like that ever again.",1

I can get 2 slices and a pop for 275 down the street Minus the greasy oil and more pepperoni.Yet here they want 4$ for a slice and 2.50 for all drinks. You can't even pee until you pay for your food first. I don't mind cashing out for good food but it pisses me off to pay a lot for horrible pizza. and its the closest place in walking distance from my Job.. Now we all just Call delivery from 8th ave.,2
68,1,7/22/2012,0,11,"New Orleans, LA",Beth L.,0,1.0,9,"In town for the Macy's Firework Display and this was the only place close that had a restroom (customers only). They stamp your hand to identify you as a customer. Waited in line for about 30 min to use the restroom. The girl said that there were two toilets available. She failed to mention that the two toilets were side by side in one room without a stall. Imagine having to share a room with a complete stranger while crapping on the toilet; no privacy. A customer is a customer regardless of what time you ate here. The line for the restroom was out the door. The menu that was available to us was limited in comparison to the one found here on the internet. The mozzarella sticks appeared to be the frozen type. My daughter took a bite but the rest was left untouched. The ""grilled"" chicken that the waitress served by husband was fried, tough and hard. My turkey sandwich was bland and dry. Service was SLOW but hey, it was the Fourth of July and the place was packed (mostly just to use the restroom) or to buy a drink just to use the restroom.
