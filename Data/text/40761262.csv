Out of all of the broadway theaters I've been to The circle in the Square is now my favorite. It's not that large of a theater so it was not the usual hassle of getting in. Security does a brief spot check of your bag and makes you open your coat. They don't touch you or make you go through a medal detector so I'm not sure how ""secure"" you should feel but, that's the process.Once inside you are directed downstairs ( use the stairs or escalator) to the theater area. The concession stand is strategically placed in between the entryway doors to the theater so you can spend an outrageous amount of money on a snack Lol. The theater itself reminds me of an arena. The stage is in the middle of the room and there is seating on all sides (a 360 view.) With this set up there is not one bad seat in the house. It really doesn't matter where you sit because the view of the stage will be clear. We sat in row H(aisle seat) and we were fine. Also, there is no to need to worry about whether the person in front of you will block your view or not because the rows of seats are perfectly placed you will not even notice the person in front of you. As a result of the seat placement you get a little more leg room than you would with your typical broadway theater. Additionally, this theater is well maintained!!",5

When we arrived we saw crazy long lines and thought it was for our show. Thankfully, it was for Wicked. It was fast and easy to pick up our tickets at Will Call. The only line was the giant one to use the restroom before the show, but it went fairly quickly. The theatre itself is intimate and doesn't appear that there's a bad seat. We did find, however, that it was quite hard to make out the lyrics. I'm not sure what that was about.",1

I love how there were seats on every side,  which really enhanced the experience. The when I was purchasing a ticket,  I was told to get there about thirty minutes before the showtime to watch the stage come to life. That was the most exciting part to me!  It was cool to see how the cast set the scene. The music is ON POINT. Everybody can sing and when you go you will not be disappointed! After the show,  they have an area in which some of the stars come out and give autographs and take pictures.  That was another added bonus!  ENJOY!!",1

The theater is very spacious and the seating is in a circle around the stage which makes the actors a interactive and close to the audience. The acoustics were on point.      I definitely recommend this particular show, it was incredible and I would see it again! The acting is spectacular. The theater was clean, not a long wait for restrooms at all. Super easy to exit the building as well.",

Unlike traditional theater, this place has the stage in the center and have seats all around it. As such, all of the seating is guaranteed to be close to the actors on stage.  For once on this island, the actors utilized this well and went up and down the entire theater making it an immersive experience.  There are seats in the back of the main stage which would have a different viewing experience but it does not deter from what one is seeing.  The theater itself is smaller than other ones in the area, and they also have the standing seats available at the top.",1

We came here last Friday 6/8 to watch ""Once On This Island"", as it was nominated for (and won!) a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical; also, my family and I are big fans of Lea Salonga. I also didn't know that Alex Newell was in this show. I remember watching him on Glee a few years ago and I was a fan.This theater is not like traditional theaters, as it is literally a circle. This means there really isn't a bad seat in the house, as the cast members move around and you can view the show from all angles. Acoustics were great. We had front row seats, which my sister was worried would be too close, but ended up being a really great experience.Would highly recommend watching a show here, if not ""Once on this Island"". :) Probably was the highlight of my whole trip!",

We had a great view of the stage when we saw Sweeney Todd.The Circle in the Square Theatre is a more modern theatre hall. It moved to its new Broadway home on 50th Street in 1972, it was the first new Broadway theatre in fifty years. Over the 40+ years in its new space, there has been some amazing actors performing here  such as Al Pacino, Mary-Louise Parker (love her), Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Robards, Mercedes Ruehl, George C. Scott, Martin Sheen, Gary Sinise, George Segal, Eli Wallach and Treat Williams. The seats were comfortable as for opulence, it was more technical. I was seeing more exposed stage lighting and props but that added to the theatre experience.",10
7,7,5/22/2017,163,2,"Edison, NJ",Brian L.,1894,3.0,267,"If you have trouble finding the Circle in the Square Theater, just look for the throngs of Wicked fans waiting outside the Gershwin Theater next door.The lobby has red carpeting and feels more spacious and better lit than some of the other lobbies in the Theater District. The lobby has nowhere to sit, but the covered patio outside has more than enough space, so there's no need to worry about waiting in the rain before a show or being crowded off the sidewalk into oncoming traffic like at some of the theaters on Broadway.The ticket booth operator seemed a bit less robotic than those in the cramped booths at other theaters. A seating chart is posted for reference. Credit cards are accepted. Seating begins half hour prior to showtime, preceded by a bag check in the lobby.The theater itself is two escalator rides below street level. The underground lobby has a small bar, and restrooms are another level down.As expected, the ushers are civil but rigid, and two of them flat-out ignored me when I asked for a Playbill, so I had to grab one myself from a pile in a corner.  The thrust stage creates a horseshoe seating arrangement that gives everyone a mostly unobstructed view of the action, but the tradeoff is that there are virtually no aisle seats. Luckily, recent shows like Fun Home and In Transit have been in a 90-minute format with no intermission (and no late seating!) so this is only a minor concern. The seats have at least 30'' of pitch, which is helpful for people with longer legs and makes it easier for others to pass.Seats are only about 7 or 8 rows deep, so you should be able to see most of the sweat and projectile saliva from wherever you're sitting. When I saw a Saturday evening showing of in Transit, the seats were only about 2/3 full. I noticed a handful of stragglers sneak in after the starting time, but it seemed that the show was delayed 10 minutes anyway.",22

9,4,2/11/2017,126,,"New York, NY",Cuiyu W.,378,5.0,61,Saw In Transit Friday night 2/10 at 8pm. We loved the show! The diverse cast was so super talented and the storylines were engaging. The theater is so small that honestly I wouldn't have minded sitting in the back. But of course sitting towards the front is always a lot of fun. The seating is a deep U-Shape so every seat is pretty much a good view. There are lockers downstairs near the restrooms that you could use for your coats for 2 quarters.,5

We had to walk to Grand Central Station, to a Wine & Cheese spot to pick up the tickets. Ok, fine a little exercise before the show.The theatre is small intimate with an oval shaped stage and seating. We had good seats. And the show started right on time. They had warn us that there will be no intermission. The show lasted about 2 hours.I loved the show. Since the story lines took place at a train station it became so relatable. My favorite storyline was about the jogger. I laughed, was mad & felt sad for her. I am so happy I was able to see this great play.I would definitely recommend any person or tourist to see this play.

Definitely recommend it more for New Yorkers since we can totally relate (although out of town folks can still get a good laugh).I'm not rating the show; I'm rating the theater.With the wraparound seating and relatively small theater, it's really hard to get a ""bad"" seat. However, no matter how the show may try to face each part of the audience, that's not always possible and some of the cast may have their back to you. The seats are particularly uncomfortable - the seat backs are really hard (moreso than at other theaters) and I kept shifting uncomfortably throughout.I wouldn't let the above deter anyone from seeing In Transit, though - I recommend the show itself 100%!",2

15,6,2/26/2016,3786,4,"Ann Arbor, MI",Annette J.,6335,5.0,1563,"We saw ""Fun Home"" here last week--what a theatre! It's tiny. Like the theatre is roughly 8-10 rows deep kind of tiny. And the show is performed in the round so every seat is amazing. To be so close, to see each facial twitch. It was remarkable. And how special it was to see this Tony award winning show with these Tony nominated and winning performers in such a close proximity. This is why people come to Broadway!I understand the bathrooms are hard to access but I am blessed with a bladder of a camel and did not have to go during our visit. My husband was gone for a hot second before the show started but had no complaints when he returned. I also understand the criticisms that Circle In the Square lacks the ""Broadway"" feel that some of the other theatres in the area do. And that's fair. It definitely does seem more regional than BROADWAY on the surface but once you're immersed in the show, and the talent in front of you, all that goes away. It's easier to feel a part of it when the surroundings are more discrete. I appreciate that it's a different kind of theatre experience. My biggest regret is not seeing Audra McDonald in ""Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill"" there when it was running a couple of years ago. Yep, biggest regret of all my NY theatre trips thus far. Alas, I guess we can catch it on HBO later this month.If you have the opportunity to see a show here--do it!",11

I got to the theater at 6:30 to pick up my tickets and there was a corkscrew line in the tiny lobby area. The theater goers and this San Diego gal were getting cranky as panic started to set in around 6:50 pm because of their ""No late seating"" policy. I think the staff was told to ""speed it up"" because the line started to move quickly when I was about 6 people from the front of the line. (I think they stopped checking photo ID and credit cards, which made the line go a lot of faster.)I grabbed my tickets, went through security quickly, and sprinted downstairs to use the restroom. They started the show about 5 minutes after 7pm. I didn't even have time to crack open my Playbill!I sat in seat 426, which is the front row near the orchestra. The show was fantastic and clearly deserving of all the accolades they received last year! (It was a bummer that Tony award winner Michael Cerveris was out though.)",5

The seats to the theater surround the stage in the middle allowing for a crazy 360 degree experience depending on where you are seated. We were lucky enough to get front row seats and we were practically on the stage. So cool.We had the pleasure and privilege of being able to see one of the final performances of ""Fun Home"" there and it was sooo good! Not knowing much about the show going in outside of the fact that it won the tony for best musical last year, we were just blown away by how great of a show it was.The staff here were very friendly and helpful in explaining the upcoming theater experience and what we needed to do as an audience for it to run smoothly. It was definitely an exciting theatrical experience and I cannot say enough good things about this theater!",

Then , tonight , for Yelp event's Fun Home. Each seat with the theater unique seating plan ( a round about theater)  has a good view of the center stage, down ward viewing .....way cool! It has  Small seating capacity but makes up for an intimate theater experience. Like the Roomy seats and the good legroom. Lighting is inadequate. Performers microphone volume is inconsistent . As shorter shows are showing here, plays are a continued no intermission show thus the theater doesn't allowed late seating. The theater stage area is located one plight down from the street level and comfort rooms are inconveniently  located one more  level down. Staff is helpful.",2

Saw Fun Home here last year and enjoyed this one more.  Perfect for this theater! It's setting is in the NYC subway! The set has a conveyor belt type strip down the center of the stage that works as a people mover! The actors move back and forth on this strip. AWESOME! I thought for SURE I was going to miss the orchestra as the entire show is a Capella! I did not! I was thoroughly entertained the entire time! The beat box guy (sorry I can't remember his name) was BRILLIANT!!! (not too bad on the eyes either, if you don't mind me saying so!) Not a bad seat in the house! I did agree with my friend who said it could of been 20 minutes shorter as it had no intermission OR they could of gone 20 minutes longer WITH an intermission.  Either way would of worked but it did seem to wrap up rather quickly. Really fun for a NYC show! I can't see this hitting the road for national tours but it really was a fun NYC experience!",2
21,4,1/17/2016,461,3,"New York, NY",Karen S.,851,4.0,423,"It's clearly a medium-sized venue. Not ""small and intimate"". What's my criteria? When I'm seated in Row K and it's taxing my brand new prescription in my glasses, it's not intimate. Seeing shows in the winter becomes a feat of where to put your warm yet ridiculous coat. Circle in the Square sadly does not have a coat check. And if I had an actual experience with the restrooms one more level down, this may have resulted in a 3 star review. But the seats are roomy enough to sit on your coat and I went before I came. Problem solved. There's good leg room as well, but you refuse to stand when people need to get by you to sit, don't get pissy if your feet get stepped on and your program gets knocked off your lap. But more on etiquette later. The sound was excellent and for a theater-in-the-round type experience, the sight lines were great. I was seated directly in front of the sound booth though, so your results may vary.The theater attendants were plentiful and helpful. You will get plenty of warning about the no intermission and no returning to your seat during the play policy. Plenty. Now... Why would an attendant need to tell people to not put their feet on the furniture???? Did you not just watch Fun Home? Did the stress of living in a highly polished home not impress itself upon you in the slightest? Were you in fact raised in a barn? Rule of thumb for civilized living... if other people sit there, your dirty shoes shouldn't be on it. Thanks.",6

This theatre is the opposite - I loved the actual theatre.It is a round theatre that was built when modern people with larger bodies roamed the earth. I was very comfortable, I was so happy I was all set to love the play even more.I came here by myself as my friends had already seen Fun Home. I was able to score a front row seat, one seat just for me. I had terrific leg room, the seat was ample and I could see the stage and everyone on it.The only thing wrong with this theatre is that for some bizarre reason they decided to build the bathrooms in the basement, down a long flight of stairs with scandalously few stalls.This theatre gets that people are no longer miniature. Maybe one day they will also realize we also drink liquids and the resulting anatomical reaction.",9
23,,2/9/2017,12,,"New York, NY",Lara J.,57,4.0,183,"I saw In Transit yesterday on a Wednesday afternoon, by my lonesome. This is my first time seeing a Broadway show on a stage like this one- I had low expectations. After all, you could see the other half of the audience across from you! And then I noticed the sign outside the theater that said this was a theater SCHOOL?? I didn't want to watch some third-rate show! Boy was I in for a surprise!Everyone else is saying it, so I will too- there is not a bad seat in the house! I was a little left of center stage, about four rows back. But even a few rows back you can really catch the detailed expressions on the actor's faces. The theater was more utilitarian than others I have been too- but very clean and comfortable. The show is done a Capella and all sound effects are done with human voices. I kept forgetting this during the show- they are that good!! There is a guy who remains on stage for much of the show- he's THAT guy peddling CDs in the subway - and he does a lot of the sound effects and offers advice to our characters. He's pretty incredible. This show is done in the same style as the movie,  Love Actually; there are a three different stories being told that sort of thread thorough each other. And they take place mainly in the subway. There are  plenty of subway jokes to keep the laughter going - and it does go! The character in yoga pants was my favorite. Or maybe the gay couple was. Or no- the other girl. Or is it that guy ... Ugh! Okay- it's hard to pick my favorite because I was really invested in the characters. The stage was pretty inventive. Set changes were handled via conveyer belt on going up the center of the stage. I never really noticed the audience on the other side of the stage. The show was too engaging! Others have said it and I'll repeat- absolutely NO late seating and no intermission. The theater is too small and the audience is so close to the actors that you coming in five minutes too late because you couldn't get that winged eyeliner just right would really ruin the experience for everyone. I REALLY enjoyed this show!!",1

Also, it gave us a lot to discuss afterwards such as relations between light-skinned and dark-skinned people as well as races, differences between the rich and the poor and analyse the difficult choice given to Ti Moune and what the pros and cons were of either decision she took as well as discuss whether Daniel could have gone against what was traditionally expected of him and his people or whether he had no choice but to go along with his parents wishes.",3

FUN Home was a moving dramatic biopic about one of my favorite lesbian cartoonists.The seats were made for real people of my size so I was so comfortable throughout the performance.  The sound was terrific. These was creative and dynamic and the action with the set was spellbinding.The bathrooms are on the lower level with no elevator and would be hard for people with disabilities, of which I saw a few in wheelchairs.

There's something to be said about theatre in the round; it doesn't always work, but when it does, it works really well. I saw Fun Home the other night, and it's definitely a show that works well in the round. What the other reviews have said is true; there isn't a bad seat in the house. However, if you can avoid sitting in the 400s, I would suggest it. You're sitting right behind the orchestra, and the majority of the songs are more focused on the opposite direction. (I was a little disappointed to watch Sydney Lucas' back perform Ring of Keys.) Even so, it's a great theatre, and you'll enjoy your experience regardless of where you sit. The ushers in this theatre seem to have seating down to a science, but I almost wonder if it's too much. I had to go through four different ushers just to get a playbill and sit down, even though I knew exactly where it was because I had looked it up in advance. I understand that a lot of people don't do that, but it did feel a little excessive. Just a warning, if you plan on using the bathroom, get there right when they open the lobby (half an hour before the show). I went down around 7:35 and had to wait behind maybe ten people, but by the time I came out the line was all the way up the stairs. Then you're trying to fight to get up the open half of the stairway while men are trying to get down to their shorter line. All in all, this was a nice theatre, and I hope I will be able to attend more shows here in the future.",3

It isn't so huge that theatergoers get a bad view or nosebleeds and it's small enough to feel intimate. A proper angle to the comfortable stadium seating ensures that you don't need the neck of a giraffe to see the action on stage easily. If you look at the ceiling, the lighting this theater has is incredible and the effects were well done for the production of Fun Home. Acoustics on the night I went was good, though if you sit directly behind the orchestra you might feel hearing impaired when it comes to dialogue. I didn't see a section for handicapped seating, so if you are, inquire. The ladies bathroom here thoughtfully has more stalls than many larger venues. The place is clean, with a nice bar and a small concession area.",9
30,,1/29/2015,417,,"New York, NY",Caitlin C.,8937,3.0,497,"Not my favorite Broadway theater.  It lacks the opulence of the theater-going experience at most of the other historic houses in the area.  Instead, you find yourself in a dim basement with an in-the-round setting that feels more akin to a regional theater. Of course, there are always exceptions to the typical Circle in the Square experience - but this is only when a production goes out of the way to prove there's a *reason* they're in the unorthodox venue.  The transformation of the space for ""Lady Day,"" for instance, was magical and totally fitting. Overall, a visit to Circle in the Square is worth it for a strong or compelling production, but don't expect the traditional ""Broadway"" vibe for your ticket price.",

If you ever are in a two-show day kind of mood, hit up Fun Home and Wicked. The fact that it's round is so cool. There are basically no obstructed seats. Every seat has a different perspective. There are ALWAYS at least 2 things going on at the same time. I sat in the 200 section, Row G, Seat 248. Great view, but the Standing Room people being right behind you is annoying. Also, I felt like the main action was normally was happening towards the other side. I mean, the grass IS always greener. My recommendation is the 200 odd section, opposite of where I sat.

The only thing is that I went with my mother in law who has a hard time walking and we had to go outside and around the corner to take the service elevator and then we had to walk some more to get to the lower level of the venue. Really not easy access for handicapped or people with limited walking capacities... There should be an handicapped access within the venue to facilitate the process.,1

I was amazed at how close I was to the stage (I was in the last 3 rows from the back!) and it seems even those sitting on the side of the stage can see very well ! The staff was also very friendly and efficient in directing us to our row and seats and I definitely would come back again and recommend it to friends and families. The lobby area was clean and if you have 2 quarters you can even get a locker :) I wish they would charge like 1 dollar and take credit card but I am not going to cry over that. Try it out!",1

Not one of my favorite things he has done, it was a bit slow and the story line was  bit odd and left a lot of '????' at the end....but like I say it's Hugh Jackman, the man could stand on stage and pick his nose & I would still go see him!

44,,2/8/2014,35,,"Long Island, NY",Joe M.,414,5.0,184,"I saw Bronx Bombers at this theater. It was a amazing show in a great theater. The seats go all the way around the stage so every seat is a good seat. It doesn't matter where you sit.  The play was really a great show. If you are a baseball fan, especially a Yankee fan this is a must see show. The writing was great and the actors were awesome. I would definitely come back to see Bronx Bombers again. They have a strict no camera policy, even before and after the show. They made it a point  to stop people from taking pictures. The show lasted about 2 hours with intermission at the 55 minute mark. The stage is below street level so I had no cell phone reception. The theater is a few blocks from Times Square and is in walking distance from subways.",
45,,1/7/2015,356,,"Manhattan, NY",Julia V.,74,4.0,143,"My husband and I came here to see the River and it was a very intimate experience. The seats form a U shape around the stage with most of the seating staged in the first five rows. We sat in row C and we felt very close to the stage, with the actors' faces clearly visible. The seats are also positioned so people's heads are never in your way, a huge plus since I always end up sitting behind a tall person with some ridiculous hat blocking my view. The only downside: the staff got upset when I took a picture of myself about 10 minutes before the show started. Wasn't aware this was frowned upon in the theatre scene and thought their reprimand was a bit over the top. Otherwise, this is an amazing place to see a straight play!",2
46,,9/17/2015,0,,"Thiells, NY",Mark B.,34,5.0,17,"I absolutely adore this theatre! It is certainly the most intimate theatre experience on Broadway and usually houses good productions. I have been here twice. The first time The River with Hugh Jackman and the second time the powerhouse musical Fun Home. Both times I had terrific views and good legroom. For The River I sat in the special ""Riverbank"" seats for the show in the 100s (second row) and it was an out of this world great view, and I sat center 200s Row G for Fun Home and that was also an amazing view. For Fun Home I would recommend the 200s due to some set pieces sometimes blocking views in the 100s and the actors backs look like they are turned to you a lot in the 400s. Can't wait to come again!",2

Budget was a little tight so I opted for the Row K special.. Last row in the house for $70 cheaper than a regular seat. Was i worried? Not at all. There are some seats that are better than others but every seat is decent if not great. There might be a chandelier or spotlight in the way but it's not that bad. I have seen a few shows here and all were interactive. Is that the nature of the theatre? Maybe. If you get the chance and there's a show that interests you - check the theater out... You won't regret it.,2

Currently you'll find Soul Doctor here, but I wrote a separate review of the show. This is a great intimate space for any small shows, and I would say there's probably no bad seats in the house, apart from maybe the extreme far corners. There's plenty of leg room and there's not very many seats, so it's a pretty easy theatre for a show to sell out.",3

This is what happened when I saw Lombardi at Circle in the Square. For the theatre itself, it's the same as what the other yelpers are saying: very intimate, comfortable seating, a good view wherever you are because, well, it's a circle.I would like to rave about the perfomance I saw, Lombardi. Being both a theatre AND football fanatic, I was excited to see that someone else was interested in both as well. I loved that there were several dudes in the audience that were there with their buddies and were clearly not dragged to the theatre by their girlfriends or mothers. What a great way to switch up the demographic! The performances by the entire cast, including Dan Lauria and Judith Light were fantastic. Their chemistry as an old married couple felt very real and humbling. Even the simple stage props and furniture were smartly blocked, and the rotating couch really let everyone in the audience feel like a part of each scene.I'd definitely recommend checking out this show before it goes!",1

66,,6/10/2012,0,,"San Francisco, CA",Cass C.,0,5.0,6,"Wonderful theatre that really spoiled me for other theatres. I saw Godspell here 4 times. As I understand it, productions here build their own stage. Godspell built its own stage and thus built it with trapdoors to store and conceal props and gags and even have the area for the piano in a somewhat recessed area of the stage. I believe they are one of very few shows that have fully taken advantage of the theatre in the round concept, allowing the audience to fully surround the stage, rather than blocking off part of the seating area to have a more traditional type of stage. Row K is the last row so no matter where you sit, you're no more than 11 (or 13 if you count the ""floor"" seats) rows away from the stage. It's also underground; no matter where you sit you take an escalator down to the actual theatre. I can't imagine anything with a large orchestra would play here. Members of the band are scattered throughout the audience.The Godspell stage is pretty low, about knee height so you're not going to get neck strain looking up if you're in the first row. If you end up with a seat behind the piano and are worrying that it might block your view, it's not a problem. Once I sat in the first row about 3 seats to the left of the piano and obsessed about not being able to see but once I got there, it wasn't an issue at all.",

Actually I'd probably prefer to have the seats at the top because your only maybe 30 feet from the stage and you get a better vantage point. If your a little on the big side, I'd recommend getting an isle seat, thats all. Lombardi was unbelievable. I don't think there is a person alive that could have done a better job than Dan Lauria. Yo literally feel like your getting to be in the same room as Vincent Lombardi although I think Judith Light from Who's the Boss stole the show.",

My only complaint: don't sell non-water drinks for a show without an intermission and then not let those drinks in the door. What's the point? There is no sign saying no soda in the theater so we bought the $3 soda for the show.

73,1,4/23/2009,122,,"New York, NY",Reshma B.,6,4.0,311,"As another reviewer mentioned, there really is not a bad seat in this theater.  We got seats for Norman Conquests (great show) in the ""orchestra"" section, which turned out to be halfway between the first row and the last.  But it didn't matter because it seemed that every seat was equidistant (or close enough) to the action.  The theater is set up as a square of seating around a circle stage (hence the name of the space) with various entrances at the corners leading to aisles towards the center.  The show I saw was made up of scenes in which there was no ""front"" or ""back"" of the stage so we saw the actors from all angles.  The stage is at ground level (and not raised like a typical stage) so those in the first row were on the same level as the actors, allowing the actors to get ""up close and personal"" to those lucky folks.  I like how there was a massive hanging platform over the stage which had an intricate model of a country-side, kind of setting the scene before the show started.  It was gradually raised when the show began so the actors could emerge.  The bathrooms are located on a floor below and yes you have to walk down some steps to get to them and likely will have to wait on a line.  The bottom floor is also contains lockers (like those you'd see in a High School), which I imagine are left over from the Putnam County Spelling Bee.  Overall I had a good experience in this theater - I really liked the set up and which more shows followed suit!",4
