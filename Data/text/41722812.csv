0,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",18,258,0.0,4.0,7/11/2018,"One of the better options on Seamless-- lots of options to mix and match while staying on the healthy (ish) side. The quinoa here is mixed with celery and onions as well as a dash of lemon and is perhaps some of the best quinoa I've had. For mains, I quite like the salmon and the chicken breast, both of which are tender and flavorful. The house sriracha is bomb, along with the rosemary vinaigrette. The garlic aioli is seriously garlicky and probably lethal for your coworkers/whoever is hanging out with you after. Definitely get the broccoli side; the roasted vegetables and sauteed kale are quite good as well, albeit a bit on the saltier side.Overall, filling and healthy options that don't leave you feeling too heavy afterwards.",1,1,1

Waited 10-15 minutes past the already 40 min delivery window and when I called to ask the eta, the counter server informed me that they didn't send the order bc they ran out of the chicken side and that it would be another 15 if I wanted the order. I would have waited but the woman on phone was rude so I had a refund. I was enjoying dig inn, but that experience totally turned me off and wished they would have called to even let me know rather about the delay rather than just not sending it and waiting for me to call.",1,,

I went with a complete vegetarian meal since I was in that kind of mood. The kale salad was delicious. It had all sorts of flavors going on. Love it. The broccolli and the mac & cheese were pretty good. This place isnt necessarily cheap but you pay for the quality. The potato salad was prob the only thing I thought was bland. My wife got the salmon and I had a try. It was awesome. It came with some sort of green sauce that adds flavor and a little acidity to the dish. The quinoa was also a good healthy accompaniment. Overall, this is a 4 star place. I would try it again and if I wanted a place with a lot of different options.  Is it actually healthy?! Idk... but does it make me feel like Im eating healthy... YES",13,3,9

The charred chicken is just awesome. Fatty thighs, well seasoned, and lightly charred. Perfect on its own, but well complimented by the tarragon mustard (which you will want extras of - three total should do the trick). The sautéed broccoli and roasted kale were both winners.

Obviously I gave her a dumbfounded look and she repeated it again, with a laugh this time because she clearly saw the distraught on my face.  I understand it was rush hour, there a line, however level up is accepted in all locations at Dig Inn and if it was a misunderstanding, there was no need to berate anyone.

I typically get the delicious herb roasted chicken, which I determined is the best of the protein options through trial and error. The salmon is reasonably priced, but the piece I got from this location tasted way too fishy and lacked moisture. I've had the salmon at other locations and enjoyed it, so not sure what was going on with the salmon here when I came. I've also ruled that the quinoa is too lemony for my taste and leaves an unpleasant sourness in my mouth. I've tried many of the sides and recommend the sweet potatoes and broccoli.",,,

But Dig Inn exceeded my expectation. Every bowl basically fulfills me for two meals. I typically order farm Greens w/ Mint or the Maine Farro w/ Butternut Squash as my base, charred brussels sprouts or roasted sweet potatoes, with herb roasted chicken. Boom. I was unsure with which salads are better (Dig Inn vs Sweetgreen) but I'm tempted to say Dig Inn. It gets busy during lunch hours on weekdays and seems intimidating, but seriously, the lines go by quicker than I'd expect (I installed the app and tried ordering from that, but the line went by just as quickly) Second time I ordered takeout via the app during the 2018 BOMB CYCLONE before the store opened and they amazingly had it ready for me as soon as they opened (11AM).

I don't even feel that guilty when I order the Mac n cheese as part of my meal (probably should, but I don't). The line works similar to Chipotle- you order what base you want your bowl to have, then two sides and a protein. I love the roasted sweet potatoes and the salmon is cooked very well.

Furthermore, first tried it during the summer and the hot dishes added to the hot weather were not a hit for me. The way this works is you follow the line of the food and basically point out what you want from the sections (the sections are something like: grains/greens; vegetables; protein; additional toppings).Since then, I have re-discovered it with the help of a friend, who absolutely loves it. Following that visit,​ I have completely fallen in love with the place. I usually spend around $12-$16, so I try to only go once or twice​ a week.",,,

Updated review","Update: The manager reached out to me & he was very concerned about my issues. I definitely got the feeling that he cares & that he was going to work to fix the issue. This Dig Inn is starting to fall off. The food still taste the same but the customer service has gone down and the amount of food they now give has declined as well. I literally just got 4 pieces of broccoli. But that's not the reason for this review. The Kale recipe has changed by adding onions, I don't mind onions but when the onions out weigh the Kale I have an issue. I was In the process of explaining this to the very nice lady when a rude male worker interrupted me, to tell me that it will still taste like onions. As if I'm not aware of what happens to the taste of things when you add onions. Since he was so interested in my conversation, I began to explain it to him. I got one sentence out, he said ok and began speaking with another customer. He was very rude and dismissive and as someone who frequents this place often, he makes me not want to go back",1,,

During lunch time (12-2pm) the lines can be insane, sometimes even out the door. The staff is pretty great and move you along very fast so even though it looks like it'll take forever, you're in and out before you know it. At the counter you get to choose 4 options for your bowl. You start with your base, which is usually rice or quinoa, followed by your cold and hot sides (you pick 2). For the sides, there are plenty of options, but I suggest the roasted sweet potatoes and mac & cheese. Then you pick your protein. They have a lot of options, such as meatballs, chicken, steak, etc. and they switch it up now and then. All the food I've had thus far has been great and totally priced well.",1,,

Don't the lines fool you; you will be in and out faster then that tinder date you went on last week.  Healthy options abound. The veggies are all very good and although the flavors are boring, sometimes boring is what you need, Mary. The roasted brussels sprouts (nicely charred and seasoned) are the fav for this folio followed by the broccoli and kale, which are equally simply cooked and tasty.   The combo meals are relatively cheap ($10ish and below for a small) for lunch considering it's one of the healthiest options around the area and ""healthier"" tends to come with a heavier price tag. I usually come here and when it's a ""veggie lunch"" kind of day, which means mid week and not only is it filling, it's under $9. If you need to cheat with an animal option that will cost a little more. Meat options might kill you eventually, but they are good here. The meatballs are my least favorite, due to it's odd flavor, but it's edible. The wild salmon is a nice option, but it's extra. Ditto for the avocado option, but you knew that already. The chicken and flank steak are both solid, with the steak the clear front runner for this wolf in sheeps clothing. I don't run here looking forward to an exciting lunch, but I do appreciate their speed, value and quality. It also makes me think I might live a little longer.

My go-to at Dig Inn are the Happy Valley Meatballs, quinoa, mac & cheese with an avocado. The meatballs are from dry, seasoned well and placed on top of your choice of quinoa or brown rice.

Most of the restaurants in this area are absurdly over-priced, but when I popped into Dig Inn the menu and prices were reasonable. I ordered the Wild Salmon plate with two sides. The salmon was served with pesto and was VERY VERY good - no fishy taste, even with the skin on! The sweet potatoes were tasty, especially since they serve them with the skin on (the only way I enjoy them). The one flaw was the curried kale - the cook was heavy-handed with that salt.

43,Jenna I.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,254,53,4.0,12/15/2016,"I always joke that the only time of the year when I eat an actually well-rounded meal is on Thanksgiving and when I order from Dig Inn. Sometimes Dig Inn can be too hipster-food-palate for my taste though... what does that mean? Well, it's like when they can't serve you a type of food without a 'surprise' flavor shoved in there. Like, sometimes all I want is carrots... not carrots rolled in ""pumpkin seed pesto."" Or like, sometimes all I want is meatballs without ""apricot chutney"" lousing it up. Am I super boring? Yes! Yes, sometimes I am goddamnit. I don't always want a damn flavor medley, sometimes I just want the food I'm ordering. BUT, at the end of the day, Dig Inn at least makes stuff that mostly tastes great and the best is they're always consistent. It's especially surprising to me how consistent they are considering they're using locally sourced food, but they rarely seem to run out of items. This location in particular gets crazy packed so I mostly order in or order for pick up. They're pretty accurate on their delivery times and easy enough to navigate for pick ups.I am a chicken + faro fan, I like the portion control on the chicken and I just do my best not to eat all of the faro because otherwise I feel painfully full... but dang, are they both good. Nice brown meat chicken piece with little to no gristle, cooked with some outside crunch. I adore the way they prepare their brussels sprouts - never bitter, always tasty. I'm also a big fan of the upstate mac & cheese which comes with a nice panko breadcrumb situation on top. Since the menu is seasonal my favs will come and go, but it kind of gives me something to look forward to the next time the season rolls around (ugh, is this what I've come to? Being an adult is lame).Good times, Dig Inn.",,1,

Updated review","Update: Management has reached out to me and has done more than enough to rectify this issue. Original:Hello, all. First things first- Dig Inn... absolutely my go-to for lunch. However, when trying to complete my online order, I was taken aback when Mac & Cheese was not available as one of the possible sides to order. I don't understand because Mac & Cheese is neither a seasonal fruit nor vegetable. If Dig Inn knows what's right, they will reinstate Mac and Cheese on the Fall menu. #MDIGA Make Dig Inn Great Again.Thank you,Decker 2020",,,

The idea of eating a lot of veggies is so awesome but with all that fat from oil and all the sodium from salt, are they all that healthy as we want them to be????  You can check their nutritional chart.  If you add up all the sodium from everything you get, you will easily go near the daily recommended amount just from one meal.  You can also tell when you eat.  Eveything is very generously seasoned.  To MGMT of Dig Inn - Please consider cutting down the amount of oil and salt.

There aren't many quick bites in the area, but this spot is part of a small block of lunch spots in hudson square, including pret a manger, gregory's, hale & hearty, as well as others.Lately i've been frequenting this spot less and less because their portions have gotten ridiculously small (they switched to a bowl from tray style cartons) while still being pretty pricey. A typical lunch would cost about $13-15. Also, some of their dishes have gotten much too salty, which is kind of paradoxical to their healthy/organic angle. Nonetheless, I still do have some favorites at this spot - I enjoy the salmon, which comes with a tasty pesto/cilantro-y sauce. Also, they always have fresh veggie options and their mac & cheese is amaaaazing. Highly recommend the latter. Despite the crazy lunch rush during the week, the service here is quick even though I do think they skimp on portions even more during busy hours.

Minus one star because they would not let me get my food in the salad bowl. I like to mix my food and eat it like a rice bowl and uptown they always allow me to get my food in the bowl, but for some reason I was not allowed to at this location. Definitely a bum",,,

Got the charred chicken with mac & cheese and roasted squash. The food was definitely flavorful. And if there was a healthy element to it, then even better. The chicken was tasty but kind of skimpy on the portion. The mac and cheese was gooey but the cheese flavor was mild and the mac was limp. The squash was seasoned well but there was a big pool of grease on the bottom when I finished. I think the master (health) plan with this place is to give small protein portions but large portions of really filling veggie-based sides (mac & cheese definitely not a veg but definitely filling). All in all, a very heavy meal for summer. So if the co-workers decide to go again, I might have to wait until I need something that hearty.",,,

These meatballs are covered in tomato sauce and were satisfying nevertheless. - sides - I liked the lemony Brussels sprouts, charred greens, kale and quince salad.I wasn't crazy about the sweet potatoes which were a bit bland and not sweet.  The line during lunch hour gets pretty long but it moves at a reasonable pace.  The price for a small plate is $8.04 which is fairly ""cheap"" for this neighborhood.  I have always finished my plate which tells you the potions are not large but it's just enough for me.

88,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,3.0,2/1/2014,"Dig Inn virgins, I've got two recommendations for you:- Spicy Cabo Caesar Salad- Ginger Mint LemonadeI think I ordered this exact lunch maybe seventeen consecutive times before opting for something else because I was so damn satisfied with it. Roasted corn and queso fresco is really all it takes to win me over salad-wise, and that chipotle lime dressing ain't hurtin' either. Plus, that lemonade just gives me life. This is the lunch you get the day after your calorie-counting may have gotten away from you during a steakhouse dinner or pasta gorgefest. Which, as you can see by my approximation of placing this exact order seventeen times, I don't exactly have the same discipline come nightfall as I might have mid-day.Anyway, when i tried to risk my satisfaction streak, it was met with mixed results. The Greek Salad was decent, while the Spicy Pork Banh Mi was forgettable. You can assemble a plate of sides (probably the most popular option here among the busy lunch crowd), but it took me a few orders to find out which ones I liked - red lentil and edamame, baby spinach and mandarin, and lemon chicken as a combo ain't half-bad. Still, each time I wish I had that damn Spicy Cabo Caesar instead. The Spicy Cabo is just my shit.*They do have a few seasonal items on rotation (hence the Seasonal Market moniker), so I can't rule out fancying something new. They've also got some shakes and pressed juices if that's your thing. The staff is way nicer than a lunch spot like this ever needs to be. And the woodsy decor is charming, but I always catch myself staring at that weird, re-worked cigarette ad with the smiling couple out on some hike or something, where the cig is replaced with a big-ass carrot. Seasonal market humor, I suppose.For me, the options here seem limited, and if it weren't for the two items I so sincerely enjoy, I don't know if Dig Inn would remain in the lunch rotation. That said, if you do happen to follow my lead with the Spicy Cabo pick, take this final pro tip and keep the salad vegetarian. At nearly $3 extra, don't bother adding any protein here - the amount of meat is so measly, it's a joke.*Even if, truth be told, its name is totally misleading because it's really not spicy at all.",2,2,2

That dressing and the mint really put that salad onto another level. It gave everything such an extra kick of flavor and made my taste bud in overdrive. Definitely would love to visit another branch and try the other items. One tip is to have a better explanation or pricing with regards to the menu items and the hot/cold buffet items.

I went with the meatballs and I chose the brown rice as my grains with the seasonal upstate mac and half an avocado as my two sides. The meatballs were surprisingly good! They were well seasoned, hearty but not too heavy. I was a fan.So.. the seasonal upstate mac is made with butternut squash which at first i was like -___- because I have a vendetta against sweet vegetables - I just do. But Dig Inn made me a believer because the mac and cheese was great and the butternut squash (dare I say it) enhanced the flavor giving it an addition subtle nutty flavor.Brown rice was as good as brown rice could be. The only qualm with the meal was that my avocado wasn't as ripe as I like it to be but they can't control when things do or do not ripen.The portion was great too, I felt full (which is an accomplishment) and I only paid $11 which is reasonable for lunch in the city.As a tip: I would order online and grab it to go as it can get full during typical lunch hours.

You can get a plate of one protein and three sides for $10. It sounds like it might be a lot of food, but the portion sizes given to you are actually pretty small.

While the food options are great and healthy, I feel their service is going down. Each time I come there seems to be a different process on what you can order, what costs extra. Not only that, the portions get smaller and smaller each time. Sometimes the server will scoop back if they think they scooped too much. They used to offer half avocados and now they cut it to a quarter. I just don't think it's worth the price  anymore.

Although routine defines my current relationship with Meatball Sandwich, don't think for one second that it implies routine-ness, mundane-ness, mediocre-ness or any average-ness for that matter. Meatball Sandwich is special- we know this, you should know this. The carefully toasted bun lightly saturated by the delicious meatballs blanketed with cheese makes my otherwise event-less day slightly better-full. I've never witnessed a sandwich have that effect on strangers around me, but these strangers aren't smart. Or at least not smart enough to embrace Meatball Sandwich.Understand this: Bring out your boot whips, extra napkins and fourth grade penpals...

110,Bailey C.,"New York, NY",0,15,1,5.0,5/15/2016,"Love this place. I typically eat very healthy and lean towards eating paleo most of the time. Sometimes that can be hard if I forgot to pack a lunch or I need to grab something quick. I love that this place delivers on all those needs. It's delicious, quick, and affordable. Feels like I'm getting a home cooked meal and I didn't have to do any work. Heck it's only like a dollar more expensive than getting a wrap (like I said I try to avoid) or a salad at the deli down the street which might seem like a quicker more affordable option when it actuality it's like $9. For exactly $10 at Dig Inn you chicken (some other meats more expensive, also tofu option or only sides option), either greens or a grain, and 2 sides. I love the chicken with greens, and sweet potatoes and kale on the side. The meatballs are also great. I know some reviewers thought they were weird but I loved them. Great lunch option, great price point. Go and you won't be disappointed.",,,
111,Melody C.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,325,42,5.0,4/25/2013,"Wow guys, harsh much?My experience with Dig Inn starts with this store. So no, I don't have anything to compare it to, so you can judge me for that if you want (because I'm totally judging the two two start comments before me). Hah. =)First off, I will say that yes, this location is new. And as with all new stores, even a franchise, it takes time to kick it up to the level you're used to at other places. Because that store hired new employees who are still learning and everyone is working out the kinks. It happens people. There's a learning curve, cut them some slack maybe?So I like that fact that yes, I'm new so I go in and not really know what to expect. My first time there, it was fairly empty so I like that I was asked if it was my first time there, was explained how it worked by a beautiful, smiling employee, and was not rushed when I went down the line eying everything.I like the many choices, I like the flavoring I like how healthy it is, I like how fresh it is, I like the prices, hell I even like the portions. No, they aren't heapfuls, but honestly a good-sized amount for lunch. I like more food for dinner, so not quite sure if it'd be as fulfilling for me.I like that they have pressed juice (bottled), about five different kinds of iced tea, coconut water (bottled), kale chips, chocolates, and other little in-between snacks to munch on.I will say that when I went today, there was a mad line during lunch. I heard they're getting more and more people everyday - also something they're getting used to. But we had a large order, talked to the manager about how we tried to put the order through online but couldn't, so he took our 16 orders and rushed them through. Yes, Andrew, the manager is great - smart, courteous, funny, clearly cares about the costumers, the food and the store. He was thinking the online ordering system would hit in May.Addressing the low reviews, I will say this. The store is still revving up, so until the yelp reviews catch up, look at the number of people waiting to get their meal rather than the reviews here as a sign of how good they are.",,,

I'm eating things that I normally wouldn't (braised pork, couscous, wheatberry, salmon, tofu, and so much more), and I love that they've expanded my lunch options away from just a burrito or a sandwich. My favorite side right now is the couscous, but all of the meats are really delicious as well. The service is always super fast, too.

113,Arthur A.,"Rego Park, NY",175,389,2,4.0,10/17/2014,"This is my go-to spot for lunch now.  Yes, you're going to pay a couple bucks more than you would for a Chipotle burrito (and almost double for street meat) or whatever else you'd get in this area called the ""South Village"" (ugh).  But the quality and selection make up for it.  Their slogan is ""from farm to counter"", which is not only clever but also probably true.  Everything tastes fresh.There's definitely a line during prime lunch hours, but the lines move fairly quickly.  Meaning, be prepared.The typical lunch plate gets you 2 sides and a meat portion (with a grain or bed or arugula).  The veggie sides are excellent.  I've recently started a low-carb/no-starch plan, so I was worried there wouldn't be many options, but my favorite cold sides are the quinoa, spinach salad, spaghetti squash & chickpea, broccoli, and tofu.  Hot sides are usually starchy (like corn pudding or sweet potato mash), but they do have cauliflower and now brussels sprouts which are very tasty.  I've tried their roast chicken and braised beef, but my fav is their spicy meatballs (though there's probably some bread crumbs in there, as almost all meatballs have).  The sauce goes well with the arugula.Checkout is quick, people are generally very friendly.  It's a take-out place (only a few tables).",1,,

Dig Inn's new compartmented trays caused the latest snafu, so you're now able to get only three vegetable sides versus four previously. Overall, Dig Inn seems entirely baffled by the idea that someone might not want to order meat and therefore they don't seem to feel the need to have any sort of consistent menu choice for all vegetable sides.",2,,

She put the top on then I checked out, put the side in my bag only to realize that the top was never secured and it popped right off in the bag. Forget it.

I've been to 3 other locations and love the easy ordering system and the value of 1 protein and 3 sides for ~$10. However, this location uses an a la carte model that increases the cost to over $13 for the same thing. The service and food quality is on par with the other locations. However, the staff was insistent they were better value than the other locations because ""they pile it on."" I completely disagree with that statement since they basically put the same amount in the ""large"" container that would've fit in the ""small"" container. They are being dishonest or are just plain oblivious to what the competition is doing. Also, I don't understand why they need 20 people behind the counter and another one handing out menus that are unnecessary since the writing is on the wall. Lastly, they don't do the frequent eater punch cards. Total disservice to loyal customers like myself. I will not be going back to this location until they correct their pricing structure, which is of greatest importance for a lunch spot.

I was wrong and am actually really disappointed.Okay -- here's the thing. I like all the food Dig Inn has to offer. It is good. However, the plates situation is incredibly misleading.Everyone is saying you get a protein (and rice) and 3 sides for $10 -- this is complete B.S. I just went there and looked at the menu, and trying to understand the deal, I asked a person who worked there how many sides I can order for a big plate and she completely didn't answer my question. She said ""You pick what you want. You'll see them up front."" So, when I finally got to the front and saw all of the options, I had to decide quickly what looked good. If you've ever been to a Manhattan Chiptole or something, you might understand how they just rush you through as if you're a daily patron. Also, you'd better be open-minded to ingredients (which I am) because who knows what is chopped up in those sides. It's not like anyone is there to explain the ingredients to you.Anywho, I did what I thought was right -- I ordered 3 vegetables, and a protein. They charged me $13.50. What the hell?  Did they charge me for the vegetables as a plate and then extra for the protein? They put my meatballs in a random cylinder cup. I was so confused. The line was going so fast that I didn't even get a receipt and was basically pushed out the door.Honestly, that is WAY to much money for me too spend on lunch!

This is just about the only place where you can get something ""healthy"", with adequate variety, quickly. With that said, some items are better than others...like the meatballs are good but the chicken is dry. I assure you that each and every one of those pieces in the pot is crying out for moisture. Also, the portions you get vary with whoever is serving you. Today I felt short changed on the grains.My main problem I would say is the price it's a tad too much considering they are VERY skimpy with the proteins. If they gave double the amount of proteins they typically serve I would have to problems with the price.",,,

Yesterday I finally managed to get there and upon entering, I was a little skeptical about the dishes, as nothing on the menu stood out to me. A gentleman who I presumed to be the manager greeted us immediately and allowed us time to browse the menu. When I inquired about a particular menu item, he asked if I had ever been to a Dig Inn before, When I told him no, he immediately began preparing samples for my friend and I. Of the five samples, there was only one which I thought was ""ok."" Everything else was packed with flavor! I finally decided on the braised beef over their specialty grain with roasted sweet potatoes and siracha string beans. The meal was amazing and, afterwards, I decided to get a dessert and drink. While at the counter, the same man attended to me and noticed a birthday button on my dress and he asked when my birthday was. I told him it was that day and as a result he gave me a free iced tea and cookies. I appreciated that so much. He was clearly a man committed to great customer service and I will certainly be returning to this particular establishment. I advise you do the same, if you're ever in the area.

It appears that Dig Inn has figured out how to make delicious, home-style meals with a healthy bent. No, this isn't sprouts & tofu nor is it fat-laden burgers and mac & cheese. It seems to be a healthy marriage between the two, making healthy food that is fresh & tastes good!Be warned, there is a small seating area for about 15 people - this isn't a great location to sit down and eat a full lunch. But if you are looking for a quick bite to eat, and want a great selection of salads or meals - which you build your own - this is the go-to place.There is a selection of 'cold' side dishes and 'hot' side dishes along with a protein (chicken, beef, etc) and I have to say that you basically can't go wrong on what you choose.

That's because when it comes to WAY overpriced, stuck up food places that think their food is better than it actually is, this place takes the cake. Yall, do not let them eat cake. (Getting Hungry, look out, you're probably next.)This place opened up a few weeks ago in the midst of increasingly frequent food trucks covering all KINDS of ground--waffle truck, kimchi taco truck, other exotic taco truck, lobster truck,  grilled cheese truck, straight up meat truck. If you're a new kid on the block you need to bring your A game. Dig Inn is comin at you with a solid C-.First time I went in, I was greeted by like 5 different people all telling me different stuff. Chill. The menu is about 6 feet tall on your wall and I'm not at Foot Locker. Let me live. I read through the menu and was like ok, I'm on my healthy tip so I'll get roast chicken with vegetables. Safe enough, right? Wrong. The roast chicken was chopped up in pieces and swimming in some brown sauce like a stew. What? Why? For what? So I went with the brisket. Which turned out to also be a stew. Suddenly I could hear Chipotle (my main man) whispering in my ear like, girl why are you even going around looking somewhere else when that good-good is right here?The sides. I got a salad the last time, but by the time I got back to work why did it even matter, because it was swimming in the beef stew masquerading as brisket. So I got a salad with beef stock dressing. But even then, I gave this place another chance, today. I knew to steer clear of the meat stews and got tofu with bok choy and brussel sprouts. Yo. WHY DOES EVERYTHING NEED TO BE CHOPPED UP? This is like a cafeteria for adult babies! The bok choy and brussel sprouts are both practically minced--I'm looking at my plate right now and literally cannot tell what's what. And both are swimming in an equally bitter...marinade? or something. The tofu is beyond bland--it's bitter too! But in this really mysterious way. Is it cumin? Too much garlic? Some kind of new age herb mix? I'm sittin here trying to figure out where this plate took a left turn and I just can't crack it. AND it's pricey.

Protip: when reviews are so crazy split between two extremes like this, the place has got to be new. It seems like the consensus here is:1-2 star = ""I had high hopes and they were ruined! RUINED!""4-5 star = ""This place is exactly what we needed in the area!""Obviously since I'm giving this place 4 stars I'm biased and maybe being a *little* mean to the 1-2 star people. But really, this is NOT a 1-2 star, it's at minimum a 3. The food is all fresh, good quality, and they stand by the idea of ""real"" ""healthy"" food - or at least they subscribe to my idea of real/healthy food, which includes basically anything that can be found in nature and served as a meal without too much lab science synthesis magic.I don't do big lunches, so 1- or 2-sides plus a main is generally enough for me, and I love them for making reasonable portions a real and easy option. My favorites from the sides I've tried are the broccoli & quinoa, strawberry & spinach salad, beets & goat cheese, and the orecchiette. Kale & apple salad is meh... not an inspired flavor combination in my opinion. All the meats I've tried so far (chicken, meatballs, braised beef) are good, but I almost always get the meatballs. They are reasonably spicy (for something you don't expect to be very spicy) and amazingly not heavy in your belly at all. They are probably the only meatballs I can eat regularly without any fear that I'll feel like crap later in the day as a result.It CAN get a bit pricey, but overall I think the food is worth it. The drinks maybe not so much - but the hot food platters, yes. I will say my one major disappointment here was the market veggie salad I got - it was DRENCHED in the balsamic dressing and there weren't very many veggies mixed in aside from the greens at all. I'll probably stick with the hot food bar.Lastly, the staff here are very nice and surprisingly efficient for how packed this place is. The line is always long, but moves pretty quickly even at peak lunch hours. If you don't want to wait at all, though, they strongly encourage online ordering. I've never done it, but I was given numerous fliers advertising it, and it seems like a good idea if you already know what you're going to want.",2,,
147,shanu v.,"Westchester, NY",57,120,17,2.0,8/8/2013,"Disappointing.  Went here on advice of a friend who is supposedly a food connoisseur.I got the spicy meatballs, not fried rice, and sweet potatoes.Meatballs were OK at best, a little dry b/c they are a beef+chicken combo.  A little spice, which was nice but not close to overpowering.  They did give me a good amt of meatballs..so that was good.Rice was severely undercooked and under seasoned Sweet potatoes were very plain and little to no flavor.OK amount of food for $9.50 total, but just not enough flavor",1,,

But whatever, I tried it.I got a plate with 3 sides - (I was feeling bold and hungry)...Sweet potatoes were great.Kale salad was great.Broccoli quinoa thing was dee$e.NOW I MUST WARN YOU!!!!!!!!! I thought it was going to be a nice grilled chicken addition. False.False.False.False.It was like a dark meat stew thing with weird chickpeas and chives.IDK. NOT MY THING. I personally don't like dark meat chicken and I felt it was false advertising. Or just not clear. I was really anxious and didn't want to hand it back because she already dumped it into the little cup thing. But I regret it. Please be warned that it's dark meat chunks. SINCE THEY DO NOT MAKE IT CLEAR.Sigh. Great for veggies and sides though. And that black ginger tea was good. Cool ice cubes.I would give it 2 stars for this scarring chicken experience, but I was happy with the rest of my meal. So I will not be that mean. Anyway, I'm going back to Westville for the extra money. Already threw 12.50 out the window and was unhappy with chicken. Might as well just spend the extra 2 dollars and be happy and know what I'm ordering.",2,2,1

150,Alli H.,"New York, NY",172,596,53,2.0,4/18/2013,"This review is only for the service.Dig Inn was supposed to open at 11 AM this morning, I walk in a little after 11 and they tell me that they need more time, this is fair, things happen when you open a new location. It was evident that all of their workers were eating.I try to go again at 11:30 AM and again, the business is still not opened. Finally, I show up at Noon and they are ready for business. I get the delayed opening, it's new, it happens.What happened next, shouldn't have happened, this isn't their first shop, in fact it's their 6th. First, I go in and they need to explain to me how to get food, that's all well and good, but it needs to be self explanatory. Second, I notice that the trays for the salads are out waiting for people to pick up to hand over to the food handlers. This doesn't seem super sanitary to me. Third and what I was most peeved about was that the staff didn't seem to know what they were doing, it was like they weren't trained properly. For instance, I ordered a sandwich and no one told me that I had to pay for the sandwich where I ordered it. There were no instructions, nothing that really told people where to go or what to do.This particular location is a VERY busy lunch spot, you need to make sure your people are well trained and ready to handle this. The final straw was when we ordered sandwiches and they took 15 minutes to make. I could have gone to the grocery store, bought the food and made the sandwich in that time.I will try Dig Inn again because the food is worth it but I hope they iron out their growing pains soon or I won't be back due to the service.",2,,

(quinoa, avocado, string beans, pumpkin, sauteed kale, beets, etc)people complain aboutt he portion size but it's a good amount of food for me. it's definitely not a heavy meal. depending on what you get, you'll be full if you get 2 portions of protein instead of 1, but they also have salads and sandwichesone downside, they don't have unsweetened ice tea so i have to run across the street to starbucks or pret next door for my drink.",,,

Sadly I don't have the same love for this store.A couple of things I don't like about this new store...This is my big beef with this location - They don't have the small plates here. I like having variety on my plate which means ordering 3 sides - but to get 3 sides, I have to fill up a large plate here which ends up being a huge meal.There's no turkey as a protein at this storeNo guacamole either, instead you have to order half an avocado as a side for $2.30I do like:the service is fabulous here - really pleasant great people working herethe new teas are yummy - loved the black ginger iced teaThere are sandwiches and fresh made salads - haven't tried these to comment, but I like that there's a bigger variety of healthy choices.The lack of smaller plate option, and turkey are deal breakers for me.

I wandered into this restaurant after shopping in Soho with my dad and my daughter today (Sunday) and was really impressed with their selection of hot and cold vegetable sides. I got the pork with the roasted carrots (which had delicious sour cherries mixed in), broccoli quinoa salad, and brussel sprouts. THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS WERE SO TASTY! My dad got the bahn mi sandwich, which he really liked, and my daughter got just 2 sides (tofu and green bean salad and red cabbage salad) and an avocado apple shake. The tofu was surprisingly flavorful and the avocado shake was perfect -- not too sweet but not overpowered by avocado either.The staff was friendly and we didn't wait long to get our food. The inside looks cool. I liked the area at the back selling local food products. They even had Rick's Picks (which are made in Brooklyn. I can only get them at the Whole Foods where I live in Princeton, NJ). Just found out they have other locations in the city. We'll be back to eat here when we come into the city!",,1,

As far as the food and the interior of the store goes, both are fantastic.  The space is airy yet homey, clean and service was friendly.  One star off for no lunch time delivery but I will definitely be back to try more dishes!",,,

Obviously it's less crowded on the weekends (this area is always packed during weekday lunchtimes), but such is life.The first time I ordered the Spicy Pork Banh Mi and was super excited for the ""healthy"" (or just ""natural"", really) carnal and carnivorous meal I was about to encounter. Five minutes after I ordered it however, I was told by a staff member that they were out of the baguettes since it was Sunday, and could replace it with bread. Straight up sliced bread. It was nice of them to come up with an alternative, but Vietnamese goodness on bread that was two steps away from Wonder was some kind of blasphemy, I was sure of it. So instead I ordered the Wild Salmon Salad (I regret the mayo) with two sides: Roasted Beets with Lentils (hearty), and Red Cabbage with Coconut (but where's the coconut?!).But I resolved to get the Banh Mi, which I did just the other day. I brought it back to work and created quite the mess on my desk. It was a good size (8"" or so), with tender and meaty pork. Jalapenos, pickles, cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon. And fresh, crusty, warmly toasted Balthazar bread! Is it really authentic? Not exactly, but I can see myself getting this once every couple of weeks. Worth the wait.",,,

I HATE that they list the sides on the wall but don't indicate the mac n cheese and other sides cost extra until you get on the line and they tell you after you asked for it (also no indication on their website which seems underhanded).
