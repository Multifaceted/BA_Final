Updated review","Simple, straightforward Italian classics!I came here with my cousins (3 adults and 2 kids) and we ended up sharing the calamari, Caesar salad, and ribs as appetizers. Tbh, calamari is my favorite dish but I was actually pretty disappointed by the calamari here. It was not super crispy and not very flavorful at all. The ribs were definitely my favorite. They were fall off the bone tender and reminded me a bit of char sui (the Asian red pork).We all got our own dishes (Parm chicken dinner, Parm chicken sub, shrimp scampi, and fusilli Bologna's). My chicken dinner was definitely big enough for two people to share (I just ended up taking half of it home). I got the option to do spicy pasta, red pasta, or salad as my side and I opted for the spicy which I would recommend! It's not spicy at all and it reminds me of penne alla vodka (one of my fav dishes). I didn't get try any of the others but my cousin did say the shrimp scampi was a bit bitter tonight. Great place for family style Italian classics!",2,,
1,Jessie B.,"Portage Park, Chicago, IL",2,14,7,3.0,10/26/2018,"Went here Wednesday night with my girlfriend. Our server wasn't the friendliest, didn't catch his name but he's a red head. The food took forever to come I mean we only got 2 sandwiches and it took over 42 minutes, and I was served room temperature water which was odd he didn't think to put ice. We ordered the chicken parmigiana hero sandwich and it was yummy. I wasn't a fan of the huge leaves of basil though. It was a little much. And the seasoning on the fries was annoying to eat after a while. Will definitely come back but probably at a different location and will definitely get something else. Cute dine in restaurant though! Pricey too, we paid nearly  $40 for 2 heroes one with fries, and one can of coke. Oh well",,,
2,Joe A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",45,108,0,1.0,9/4/2018,"No meatballs... No Italian combo... How could you be out of so many things? You are in the most densely populated area in the US with a bodega on nearly every corner selling cold cuts by the pound. There's probably a salumeria with one block of you. Thanks for wasting my wife's time in her attempt to get me some food after my 15 hour work day. I had worked in the food industry for 3 years and never once ran out of a single thing. We almost did one time and we borrowed some from another location.Had I ran out, then I would have comped the person, especially if I didn't have two or more things they ordered.",1,,
3,Monica A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",55,117,248,5.0,10/28/2018,Parm is now one of my favorite local places. The service is excellent and quick. With great options on the menu at reasonable prices. I recommend making a reservation on the weekends since it does get busy.,,,
4,Alvin L.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,5,3.0,8/20/2018,"After finally having a day to myself to eat at Parm for the first time, I have to say it was average at best.  Started with mozzarella sticks, and made my way to a chicken Parm hero.The sticks were made with fresh mozzarella cheese and a side a marinara. They were okay, but nothing to rave about. The chicken parm hero was more of a chicken parm on a club roll with sesame seeds. It had fresh mozzarella and basil leaves. I'm not sure about most, but I look for a good sauce, but was difficult to actually taste due to the basil/sesame seeds. Cost: 29.90!!!Final thoughts: While parm doesn't shy away from using fresh ingredients, I don't see myself visiting this establishment too often. The restaurant is cool inside and has an old school Italian feel, but the food (at least what I had) left me underwhelmed. If I'm spending $30 for a hero and sticks, I'd expect much better. You can get more bang for your buck and more flavors from a local pizza shop. Just my opinion.",,,1

Updated review","I don't know what's going on here.  My meal ended up being completely comped, and it still wasn't worth it.I think service is the problem.  Our waiter disappeared for over 30 minutes, meaning that we were not served our entrees and no one seemed to notice.  We called over the hostess to tell her, and she seemed non-reactive (and never again made eye contact).  The waiter finally appears and blames the kitchen (he says the order of spaghetti and meatballs caused the delay, which is nonsensical as spaghetti takes under 15 minutes to cook and the meatballs are premade).  The waiter never apologizes or even acknowledges the delay.  When the food still doesn't come we call over the manager, who seems like she was at least trying to accomodate us, telling us that she would have made our dinner if she could (I didn't understand her point).As a result of the manager's involvement, we are finally served.  At this point, the meatballs are cold and the spaghetti is gloppy.   We complain, the food gets brought back, and now the meatballs are lukewarm and the spaghetti is still gloppy.  At this point, we just gave up.Either the problem is that the kitchen is incompetent or the waiter's lack of care meant the food had been prepared and then just sat there.  No one offered any explanation, and I'm not inclined to go back to figure out which it is.",1,,
7,Bisera V.,"Secaucus, NJ",288,68,96,3.0,7/8/2018,I came here for a quick bite with my boyfriend and I felt like it was nothing special. We both had the chicken parm sandwich and calamari. The service and food were good but just nothing interesting or memorable. We came here because this place is hyped on instagram but I don't think I'll be coming back. I would prefer to get a chicken parm sandwich at a local Italian deli instead.,,,
8,Mary M.,"Manhattan, NY",202,2,0,1.0,11/4/2018,"If you are ordering delivery or pickup, BE WARNED! I don't write reviews, but my latest experience had me fuming. Horrible delivery and pickup service. Parm will not let you call to place an order for pick up (in fact you can't get through to any actual person if you try to call) and they only use Caviar for delivery. Pickup service is a circus. We had to repeatedly ask about our order, and then remind the cashier multiple times what our order was... no one seems to know what is going on. Order was then wrong and incomplete. Far too expensive, too. We were not alone... multiple customers were angrily waiting for pickup orders, that no server could confidently answer to. Love the food, but the poor service and lack of attention will keep us away. Not worth the trouble!",,,
9,Maria W.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,166,25,2.0,6/22/2018,"I've seen so many photos of Parm over the years, sandwiches dripping with mozzarella, the classic chicken parm, and of course, their famous ice cream cakes. I bookmarked Parm on my list of restaurants to try and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed.On a Wednesday night around 7:30 PM there are plenty of open tables. We opted to sit in the back and the place has a cute, Italian diner feel. While I looked at the menu I was surprised and how pricey everything was. $11 for a sandwich, $15 for a hero and $5 dollars for additional fries? Most of their pastas are in the $19-$22 range. And these pastas didn't have a fresh pasta look, they looked boxed.We ordered a meatball parm sandwich ($11) and chicken parm sandwich ($11) and a side of Italian fries ($5). The meatball sandwich was good, I think we both preferred it to the chicken parm sandwich. They were average-sized rolls with crusty bread, a bit of marinara, and a thick, melted slice of mozzarella. The fries were your average frozen shoestring fries, sprinkled with dried Italian herbs and a little bit of Parmesan. Honestly, nothing to write home about.Regardless of the meal, I really wanted the ice cream cake ($11) so we got the original slice, which has strawberry, chocolate, and pistachio cream. Instead of a bottom crust, they sprinkle a hefty amount of oreo dust around the plate with sprinkles, and a soft whipped cream frosting on top. I don't know, again, I wasn't entirely impressed, it felt generic, a little boring, and didn't wow me.Maybe I went in with too high of expectations, but we both left feeling a little poorer and not impressed. The service was fine, the decor is cute, but I wouldn't rate Parm high on my list.",,,
10,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,5.0,6/17/2018,"Personally I think the ice cream cake alone is worth the trip here, but I also really do enjoy the food. The housemade fresh mozzarella is excellent as is the garlic bread that accompanies it. Got a variety of dishes and all were hits. My favorites include the rigatoni fra diavola, eggplant Parm, and the grilled orata. And the meatballs!! Great for groups (in the upper west side).",,,
11,Jessica K.,"New York, NY",350,1086,683,3.0,5/22/2018,"the turkey hero is pretty good and very filling, the chicken Parm is also good. I recommend getting the side of Italian fries and a house salad.",1,,
12,Bill B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/30/2018,Been there and ordered in many times but was there this past Sunday for dinner and what a mess! Service was extremely slow and when the food finally arrived my chicken with bean dish which I've ordered before and is just baked arrived fried. I asked the server what happened and she was like wow I've never seen that before! This place is going downhill fast!,,,
13,David M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/2/2018,"Came in and ordered a chicken parm sandwich to go. It was $16, which seemed steep but I was willing to give it a try.Waited one hour and the parm never came. Everyone else was complaining about their orders too - I got a refund and went somewhere else. Oh well.",,,
14,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4793,5.0,9/21/2017,"As an Italian kid growing up in Brooklyn, no one compares to your moms Chicken Cutlet parm dinner!But, as time goes on mom makes this dish less and less. I miss those white meat covered breasts covered in sauce and good mozzarella cheese. If the sauce is good, when the chicken is baked under the broiler, the cheese melts but the sauce doesn't fade away. What I just described was my moms CCP and the dish I had with my son at Parm recently.My son and I are at a Yankee game. Its late, I'm tired and we both want to eat a good meal. I know theres a Parm in Yankee Stadium! I want to get out of the Bronx and get to the UWS as soon as possible. Traffic was brutal, I made a reservation based on my calculations and we arrived on time. Parm is a nice looking spot, very family orientated. This is not a fancy restaurant, its a place where you can still order a plate of Fusilli Bolognese with your family. Italian casual, are you feeling me Yelper?My son & I are Italian casual, the Yankees won (Go Yankees) and now I want to relax with a nice plate of Chicken Parm with Rotini and spicy sauce. Mmm....Our plates come out quickly. The food is hot and the mozzarella is of good quality. It melted properly over the molto sexy fried chicken breasts. I'd take a bite of chicken, then take of bite of Rotini with the spicy sauce. Man, that sauce had some kick! Oh baby... My son & I are in the zone. Perfectly cooked chicken and spaghetti. Nothing better. Our waiter comes over, dessert? I was about to say no but he mentioned Parm is known for their large ice cream cakes. My son said lets split a S'mores slice. Holy Moley! Now that alone is worth the price of admission. Yes, mom made CCP dinners with love. Wanna know something? These guys at Parm, they have it down and make a pretty good CCP. I like this place, if you're in the area and want good Italian-American food, Parm is what you're secretly craving.",17,9,14
15,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",388,497,41,3.0,4/4/2018,"Finally had dinner at Parm on the Upper West Side. The BF & I shared the chicken parmigiana with spicy rotini - it was pretty good but nothing to rave about. We finished the meal with a slice of their classic ice cream cake which again, was pretty good but nothing to rave about.I would maybe come back to try their eggplant parm sandwich.",2,1,2
16,Emily M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,72,36,3.0,5/14/2018,"I ordered delivery from here last week because I was really craving a meatball sub. The delivery took an hour which seemed a bit long--the mozzarella sticks I ordered were cold, cheese inside was completely hardened. The sandwich was lukewarm, so I heated everything up. The sandwich was ok, the meatballs weren't mixed that well but overall it was fine. The mozzarella sticks were extremely overpriced-$12 for five bland, cold sticks-definitely skip this if you go here. I thought their packaging was cute, but I wouldn't order from here again. Really overpriced for very average food.",1,,
17,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",976,190,913,5.0,9/12/2017,"We dropped by after a movie the other day. It looks very cool almost like a 50's diner. I love cheese and Italian food so this place was perfect!! They have a patio of sorts that unfortunately they had the sliding glass doors which I wished they were open but it's ok I lived. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, fried calamari, and buffalo style cucumbers. The mozzarella sticks were thick and breaded beautifully. The calamari was nice and tender with a crispy batter and the cucumbers were surprisingly delicious. Never had cucumbers served like this and I definitely am a true believer that they are amazing!! Bottom line: we will definitely be back!!",4,,3

19,telco h.,"Manhattan, NY",0,59,0,3.0,10/28/2018,"Completely mediocre.  Not good, not bad, nothing good, nothing bad, not worth crossing the street for.Weirdly administratively challenged.  Our child ordered a kid's plate, we ordered two adult plates.The kid's plate (pasta and red sauce) came.  It was hot, then it wasn't, then we ate it, then we sat around, then we waited, then we waited some more, then we asked about our food, then it came.Pasta sauce just wasn't that good, clearly canned or boxed, worse than Crave, Cotta, No. 28 or any local restaurants.  Bland, bland, bland.Asked to modify the spice on an adult dish, they clearly forgot, remade it and it's soul-less, every ingredient is there and there is nothing to the pasta dish.The chicken part was good, the hero roll tasted like sponge.  Made me nostalgic for the bread rolls in a school cafeteria.The one stand-out were the Italian fries, kid loved them.And back to administratively challenged... the bill included the amount $5, for the fries, but didn't list them on the bill... in short, adequate food in an area where there are any number of much better Italian joints, administratively messed up and... not coming back.The folks there were very nice, but really had nothing to work with.",,,
20,Alana R.,"New York, NY",235,50,34,4.0,4/29/2018,We've gotten Parm sandwiches for work lunch a few times now. They're so good and filling! You can pick and choose which sandwiches you want for the sandwich plater but my all time favorite is the chicken Parm followed by the house turkey. It also comes with sauces on the side. We've never received plates or utensils when we order.,,,2
21,Jenna C.,"Manhattan, NY",205,15,1,2.0,7/23/2018,"My fiancé and I decided to take my brother who's in town from Florida to Parm for dinner after an event tonight and were pretty excited to get Italian food. Parm is half a block from my apartment so it's a local spot that we frequent quite often, I'm a huge fan of their Sunday Salad. We ordered drinks after being seated in the back corner. There were maybe 4 other tables seated at this time, total, in the entire restaurant and a couple other servers on working the room. We ordered between the three of us a diet coke, a glass of red wine and a bottle of beer...pretty simple stuff. We were making conversation for awhile and noticed we still hadn't been brought our drinks...it had been about ten minutes. We asked if they'd be out soon and the server, Ryan, responded with ""when the bartender has them, they'll be ready."" All three of us found it pretty snarky. Obviously they're ready when the bartender makes them...but it was a bottle of beer which requires popping a bottle cap, cracking the can of diet coke and pour one glass of wine. It more so seemed like he forgot and shifted blame, then handled it poorly.At the end of the evening when the check came on a metal bill tray, he *dropped* it on the table. It was extremely nonchalant. Having worked in the service industry before, it was very 'I don't want to be here tonight' and to be honest, at Parm's prices, you can get great pasta down the road for half the price and without the attitude.Maybe get another job, Ryan.",1,,
22,Cyndi L.,"San Jose, CA",9,93,23,4.0,8/7/2018,"After a long morning of walking the city, we found Parm on Yelp was nearby and decided to try it out.The decor was more digitizes style which was cute and the place was clean.

I had my chicken parm with the spicy rotini and I expected spicy, but it didn't tickle me at all BUT it was super delicious ! I wanted to have my chicken parm with the baked ziti but they did not allow for that substitution. When I go back I will order it separately because I've heard good things.

We each ordered a chicken parm (because, what else would you get?) and split a bed of fries. The chicken parm was tasty enough, a solid chunk of juicy white meat that tasted freshly breaded. The mozzarella was not as flavorful as some of NYC's famous joints, but far exceeded your average corner Italian offering. Most notably to me, the roll that enveloped it was actually a fluffy bun, not the heavier and breadier roll most cheap sandwich shops use in the city.All-in-all, nothing incredible, but it's definitely among the better chicken parms I've had in the city.",,,

Go Roll! Super super yummy, was firm enough to deal with the saucy parm gooeyness - you could tell its an artisan-style roll and not some martin's potato roll knockoff.  The sandwich was delicious - sauce was great, with nice hints of basil, an appropriate amount of cheese and a nice sized portion of chicken.

46,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",825,720,1894,5.0,3/11/2017,"What an outstanding Italian gem of a restaurant! Parm was likely one of the top dinner destinations during our recent NYC trip. When we arrived with reservations on a Friday evening, Parm was absolutely buzzing with activity. Clearly a locals destination which is always a refreshing sign. My dining companion and I were both famished. I started with an appetizer order of their Meatballs, and I also started with the Chopped Salad. The meatball was outstanding. The chopped salad was huge, chock-full of fresh veggies, peanuts, and a lovely dressing. One could easily make a meal out of those things alone and leave content. However, I persisted and selected the Chicken Parm for my entree. Needless to say, it was a delicious dish that was masterfully prepared. My counterpart ordered the Baked Ziti dish. It was also a home run. In addition to great portions and quality, Parm has their service and kitchen operating like a well-oiled machine. The wait staff are completely on point, and the kitchen turns out food like clockwork. I am really impressed with this restaurant and won't hesitate to return again.",1,1,1

No. But it definitely is a good option near that neighborhood.",,1,

I make a better one myself with store bought Rao's sauce and Progresso Italian breadcrumbs.  Still I might come back in a pinch as I liked the salads and the pasta that comes with the Parm isn't bad. They don't over sauce which is nice.  Also tried the Eggplant Parm which again, is just ok. Two entrees and a salad are probably enough for three people.  Tip: Sit in the very back -- it's quieter and they don't blast the air conditioner.",,,

The food came out cold, there wasn't nearly as much food as you would think would come with a $30 plate, and the chicken was sub-par and disappointing. The pasta tastes like the cooked up a box of barilla and poured on a $2 jar of tomato sauce that I could have done at home. Walked out spending $40, we won't be back.

Needless to say the garlic bread was a great choice. The baked clams were good but not my favorite. The chicken parm was amazing. The pasta had delicious sauce on it, wish I could replicate that at home. The chicken parm was perfectly breaded and it had the perfect sauce and cheese ratio.

The idea of elevated American Italian food sounded insane, but I am sold.The food:House made Fresh Mozz with a side of Garlic Bread- The fresh Mozz was good and the nice drizzle of olive oil was great but $12 for a ball of cheese was on the pricey side. The cheese is worth getting, though. The garlic bread was nicely made and had good flavor with a pretty aggressive garlic kick but the garlic kick didn't bother me, but the $8 price tag did. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Chicken Parm Dinner- Spicy Rotini Pasta. I ordered this since the name of the restaurant is basically named after it. I am shocked to say that I was very happy with the quintessential Italian American dish and the leftovers heated up really well. I never order this dish since it is an American dish and I am usually not a fan of any food being Americanized but this totally worked. The chicken was done very nicely, it was fried really well and it was still juicy and tender especially for chicken breast. The pasta was overcooked for me but the flavor made up for it. I enjoyed the flavor of the pasta since it was a like a vodka sauce but with some chilies, the heat was nice a twist on the pasta dish. I would totally get this again. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Linguine Vongole- Clams, Oregano.

Don't get me wrong, it is a fine place to go for a meal in this otherwise pretty food-deficient area. The prices are crazy but that's honestly fine with me, it's just that the food isn't really up to snuff for what you are paying/hoping for. The chicken parm here is always passable, but things drop off pretty precipitously from there. I love the look of the ice cream cakes here but they are never quite as tasty as they look. The smores cake was in desperate need of some kind of crunchy element. Eggplant parm is exceptionally bland. The clams are good here so there's that. Three stars isn't supposed to be ""bad"" on yelp, and I don't think this place is bad. It's just kind of disconnected price/quality wise. Honestly though, we came here for dinner and all Parms are definitely better as lunch spots (ie the sandwiches and the turkey platter).

It wasn't even lukewarm - it was clearly straight out of the fridge.  I told the waiter, and he rolled his eyes again and then went back and got us a new one.  By that time, we'd finished the rigatoni.I wouldn't have minded this if the prices reflected the impatient, fast food nature of the restaurant, but they do not.

We were promptly seated by the door and handed our menus. It only took a matter of a minute for us to decide exactly what we wanted. A Caesar Salad with dressing on the side, the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and Garlic Broccoli.And while it all sounded great on the menu, what arrived was not what we expected. When you imagine Caesar Salad, you imagine romaine lettuce, croutons and the salad being covered in parmesan cheese. Not at Parm. When you imagine Chicken Parmesan, you imagine a cutlet of chicken with gooey mozzarella cheese served with lots of Marinara sauce, Spaghetti and LOTS of Parmesan cheese. Once again, not here. The Caesar Salad had bib lettuce, mozzarella cheese and, yes, it has croutons, yes it had dressing. But bib lettuce? Mozzarella? The Garlic Broccoli is as you'd assume, broccoli with garlic. The Chicken Parmesan was very... unique. It had spicy rotini pasta, which, I would've never expected to go with the dish. The pasta was cooked in the sauce, soaking it up, so there wasn't much on the plate. When I think of Chicken Parmesan, it is always Spaghetti and lots of sauce. And it had no parmesan. Nor were we offered any. Considering that's in the name and the name of the restaurant, I'm very confused.Ultimately, it isn't that the food was bad. We ate well, but it certainly wasn't what we anticipated.

I posted the review below about two hours after my meal...an hour later I was sick to my stomach with food poisoning so there goes my original 4-star review. Time to get that weight-loss resolution up and running, I guess.Original review read:A cross between old-school New York Italian restaurant, with a modern day vibe, and a touch of grandma's kitchen. Look, is it the best Italian I've ever had? No, but from the ambience, to the above-average food, to the excellent service, not to mention very decent prices, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Parm. My friend and I shared the meatball appetizer and it was great. The meatballs are big, flavorful, and juicy. I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was good as well. My friend had the chicken parmesan and though I didn't try the chicken, I tried the pasta it came with and it was good and spicy! Gotta love a little kick! We also shares the s'mores ice cream cake and even though I'm not the biggest ice cream lover, I enjoyed this massive dessert.

If you come, definitely make reservations since it can get crowded. Also, if it's cold outside, make sure to ask for a table in the back since the draft at the front tables is strong.Pros:-Their eggplant parm is delicious. 10 layers of alternating cheese, eggplant and sauce makes this dish flavorful and quite heavy. Two people can easily share it.-Service is sparse, but when the staff does come and check on you, they're super friendly. -Their dessert ice cream cake hits the spot (try their spumoni flavor!) after a big Italian meal and again, it's easy to share.Cons:-For what you get, it's pricey. The eggplant isn't served with any sort of side - no pasta, salad, nothing. And for almost $20 a plate, I was hoping for something more. Even some bread for the table would make it worth it.-Food is not served piping hot. My eggplant, while tasty, was barely warmer than lukewarm. And since the staff basically drops off your plate and leaves for an extended period of time, it's next to impossible to flag them down send it back. -Their spicy rotini is flavorful, but the pasta is definitely served softer than al dente. Not a complaint per se, just something to consider before you order. The salads are also served really cold, making them feel like they're sitting around in a fridge pre portioned and are just pulled out at the last second before serving.

If you are seated for dinner, the menu will only have the dinner entrées. Since we were looking forward to trying the sandwiches we asked and were able to order them without an issue. Though the waitress said this request may not be honored every time. Our server Cecilia was very helpful in explaining the options and was very attentive to our table.We ordered the chicken parm sandwich which was amazing. The bread was a soft sesame seed roll with slices of thick, juicy, and tender breaded chicken. The marina sauce was delicious and everything came together with the slices of fresh basel. My girlfriend ordered the eggplant parm which had layers upon layers of savory eggplant.The fast service really was excellent and allowed us to be able to catch our show with time to spare. I would highly recommend Parm and I'm looking forward to going back soon.",3,,1
89,Cristina H.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,30,13,4.0,9/28/2017,"Really good food. We had 2 meals:I had the chicken parm and spicy pasta which was delicious. Doesn't look like enough at first but definitely fills you up.The bolognese was a bit pricey for the amount given. It's a small bowl so if you're hungry, don't get this alone.Beers are a bit much for $8 but I guess that's standard for a sit down restaurant. We had Italian Fries which were good as well.The s'mores cake and Pistachio cake were alright, nothing special in my opinion. They were ice cream cake which tastes the same everywhere. NOTE: they also have chicken parm sandwiches which are amazing accordingly to my friends but it's not on the menu for some odd reason. Why not just add them?!Anyways, overall fun time with friends. Cool ambiance and not too fancy.",,,
90,Trafford J.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",37,17,1,5.0,4/1/2018,"Great twists on Italian classics at this neighborhood fave. Laid back and kid friendly (but not annoyingly so). The char sui sandwich is incredible and unexpected, the chicken parm a plate of reliable goodness. Swift and cheery service. Easy to get a table too; what's not to love!",,,
91,Miranda C.,"Manhattan, NY",374,47,1,4.0,7/17/2017,"Loved this place! I've been to a lot of fresh pasta places recently and was honestly surprised how well this held up against Village hotspots etc. My friend and I got soooo much food so I have lots to review! The homemade mozzarella and garlic bread were fantastic; the Caesar salad was okay. The rigatoni fra diavalo was excellent and had a nice burn to it but needed a lot of Parmesan to make it savory enough. My friend's bolognese with ricotta, which is not something that would necessarily jump out at me, was incredibly delicious--so savory and rich. I'd definitely go back just to order that! And we shared the smores ice cream cake for dessert which was fun and tasty. Guess I'll have to come back to try the park sandwiches which is what they're actually known for, but the pasta dishes are enough reason to go, really. Especially for the upper west side. The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is that when we got there, we were told that we either had to sit in the smoldering hot back room where the air conditioning was broken, or sit at the bar; otherwise we'd have to wait half an hour for a table, even though we had a reservation. The host was pretty rude about it too. Just seems like poor service, and given that we had just made the reservation right before coming in, they should have mentioned the problem to us. The bar ended up being okay (the back room was a veritable sauna and was not fine) but it was an unpleasant guest service moment.",1,,
92,Victor M.,"Ponce, Puerto Rico",30,23,11,1.0,5/21/2018,"Had a so-so experience... they will only seat u if u have reservation (no sign at the door stating this) and after the long walk I decided to stay and sat at the small bar the only option I was given. Funny thing is there were many empty tables, were visible and the Maitre just had a face of o well !! Sit at the bar if you want to eat... I was speaking spanish with my friend maybe we were not TABLE SEAT WORTHY. The food was not as fantastic as I thought. I had to seat at edge of the bar where they had the waiters filling the water bottles. It was a Huge disappointment, it was my last night at the city and  wanted it to be memorable (it was horrible)...I should have gone to chipotle instead for a mediocre experience!! NOt a memorable restaurant. Avoid speaking Spanish if you want a seat at a table.

It took awhile to get it water refilled when we were mostly all out. And the server pretty much purposely or accidentally skipped me for ordering food when I was just asking him to take other people's orders first. I had the rigatoni which was not good at all. There's nothing in the pasta other than the pink sauce and onions. Such a disappointment. And the arugula salad was s lot but there's also almost nothing in it. Maybe they are going for the minimal ingredient style, but def not to my liking. Feels a bit blend to me. However I would give props to their garlic bread.thaf was real good. Came crispy and very garlic-ky . And the great thing about it is that there's sesame seeds",,,1

Updated review","Today was my Daughters birthday celebration at PARM. What a wonderful festive experience they provided. I called for a reservation and said I wanted to make it a special birthday meal. We were greeted as we arrived. We arrived when they opened. The place fills up quickly. I had a reservation for 11:30 am. We left completely stuffed. Today we were waited on by Rebecca. She was such a professional juggling many tables at one time. She got our orders perfect. She checked on us periodically. We did not feel rushed. We enjoyed our meal in relaxation taking a couple hours to eat and talk about all the birthday celebrating my daughter has been doing with her friends. Then here comes the food! I had the fresh turkey sandwich. It was delicious just like my last visit. My daughter ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. She loved it. It was so huge she has enough for another meal. We had the bread and mozzarella as appetizer. Fresh and delicious sauce and olive oil to dip the fresh bread. I believe my daughter ate so much (since it was so good) when her food came she was full! My turkey was so tasty tender and juicy. The bread was soft and fresh as well as fresh lettuce. I could not ask for more. I had provolone cheese with the turkey and it added another dimension to the delicious taste. My daughter and I shared the Smore's Ice Cream Cake for desert. It had chocolate, toasted marshmallow, and graham cracker flavored ice creams with crumbles of graham and chocolate cookies on the plate. Also came topped with graham cracker, pieces of chocolate, and a warm toasted marshmallow. It was delicious beyond belief! I enjoyed it more than the sandwich naturally!  I asked for the General Manager Marcella. She was very helpful answering my questions our last visit. I was greeted by the new GM Nicole. Nichole said Marcella has been promoted to regional manager. She travels a lot and is working on their new location that will be opening in Williamsburg. Nichole was equally as professional. Everyone at PARM made sure my daughter had a happy memorable Birthday meal...I once again I highly recommend PARM on Upper West Side. Eating there turns into a special occasion.",31,23,29
99,Yanja B.,"Streamwood, IL",341,240,307,3.0,1/17/2016,"Ended up here randomly for an early dinner with a couple girlfriends. It's the cutest and cleanest old school diner I've been to. It's homey but yet it has the restaurant feel. The seating in the middle section is kinda tight but the back looked nice.Service was the killer, it was slow. Our server was not attentive. Took 15 minutes for us to get water and that's only bc the manager was walking around checking on tables. It was not busy enough to be forgotten. He went missing a number of times, when I finished my sandwich it literally sat there the whole time, no one came to pick up the plate. The basket was still there until after I signed for the check. He didn't come by to check on us, he was not attentive.The lack of service ruined the experience.The turkey sandwich was amazing though! I loved it :) turkey was well cooked, seasoned and the roll was delicious! The mayo and spicy sauce was a great touch.",,,1
100,Frank C.,"Hummelstown, PA",0,9,0,4.0,1/28/2018,"No, this isn't gourmet Italian, but it's a fun little place, with great service, very good food, and make sure you stop at the bar and say hello to Caitlin who will make you a great old-fashioned. Enjoy.",,,
101,Nicole L.,"Norwalk, CT",89,16,30,5.0,9/6/2017,"Went here with a friend on her recommendation, well I was NOT disappointed. All the mozzarella that I had there was super fresh and it totally makes a world of difference in what I ordered. I had the mozzarella sticks and they were fantastic and the cheese pull was on point. Next I had the chicken parm......everything about it was great! There was a ton of chicken with a mound of fresh mozzarella cheese on it. Last but certainly not least, the roll was SO soft and seemed to be made in house. Definitely go check this place out ASAP!",,,
102,Ellen M.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,12/13/2017,"What horrible service from Parm on Columbus Avenue via Seamless.  The first time I ordered from here they totally screwed up my order plus the food that did arrive was ice cold.  Tonight I was foolish enough to order again and after waiting an hour for the food I received a Seamless notification to say that my meal had been delivered - which it had not.  i called Seamless and after waiting on hold for 10 minutes I was told Parm was closed. They said sometimes the restaurant takes the order, notes it as delivered and never bothers to send the food.  NEVER ORDER FROM HERE",,1,
103,Valentina L.,"New York, NY",11,116,29,5.0,1/16/2016,"Came here today with my sister and roommate. We got seated right away since we had an appointment that we made a couple of minutes beforehand. We got seated in a booth and the waiter was nice and funny and most importantly quick. We ordered the fresh made mozzarella with garlic bread and it was delicious!! We also ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce and that was also to die for. Very fresh and perfect to taste. My roommate ordered the linguini vongole and she said it was the best she's ever had. To end our lunch, we ordered the smores ice cream cake and that was just mouth watering. It was simply amazing. We paid the check and the whole things was a good price. I highly recommend this restaurant for its delicious and original food, and also for its good service. Also, this place is good for 4-7 people groups and kids as well!",,,
104,Naomi C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,2/11/2018,"Overpriced and mediocre food, and that's enough to know I'll never go back to Parm again. When I ordered the ""fresh made mozz"" appetizer the waiter suggested adding garlic bread.....for an extra $8, meaning the $12 appetizer didn't even come with bread to begin with. In all honesty, I don't know that I believe it was fresh made as it tasted like the mozzarella you buy at the grocery store. I've had fresh made mozz and this was not it. Judging by the price of the chicken parm dinner, and having ordered chicken parm at other restaurants in the neighborhood, I was expecting the $25 entree to be a portion big enough for two. It came with 3 thick but small pieces of chicken and the plate of pasta. The pasta was called spicy rigatoni but had almost no flavor let alone spice. All in all was sorely disappointed with Parm.",,,
105,Ronnie J.,"New York, NY",1,17,0,2.0,6/17/2018,This review is not about the food at Parm.  I think the food is great.  I am very disappointed with the service that I just received for a takeout order.  I am hosting a dinner for 8 people this evening and just spent considerable time on the phone with a staff member at Parm trying to figure out how much food to order. I was ready to give her my credit card info when she told me that I would have to call back later this afternoon to place the order.   REALLY?!?!?!  They lost out on a sizable order and created a very unhappy customer.,,,
106,Fahmidha N.,"Boston, MA",2,4,145,5.0,3/13/2017,"Parm on west side is beautiful. When you enter the restaurant, it takes you back to another time. I enjoyed all the classics that were playing while we were having dessert. My friend and I came here specifically to try their Neapolitan ice cream cake and s'mores ice cream cake. Both are beautiful as well as satisfying. Personally I liked the s'mores ice cream more since the three flavors were more harmonious. The price of each cake is pretty steep at $12 a slice; however it's enough to split between two.",2,1,1
107,Amanda K.,"Wapakoneta, OH",0,1,0,5.0,6/23/2018,"We stopped by Parm for a quick dinner after a day of site seeing. I was expecting it to be just ok, but it was delicious!!!  I had the ziti with meat gravy. It was beyond my expectations!  It was one of my favorite meals in NYC.",,,
108,Melique W.,"Manhattan, NY",203,5,1,5.0,2/19/2017,"First, let me say the day was a special occasion. It was my grandmother's 91st birthday and all she wanted was some chicken parm. So with all the reviews and recommendations, I decided to give this place a shot. My group of 7 was seated promptly for a Saturday brunch. Our waitress who was from Kentucky connected instantly with my southern family that was visiting from out of town, making their iced tea into a sweet tea by offering a side of simple syrup. She catered directly to my grandmother checking in on us regularly. We got a selection of apps for the table, the buffalo cucumbers (really spicy, but pretty yummy), the crispy zucchini, and the calamari - all winners! We then all had an assortment of everything on the menu and pretty much turned it into family style, sharing each other's plates and getting a taste of the small but delicious menu. I had the baked ziti, some of the best I have ever had, it has a crispy sear on it that was so delicious. The chicken parm that my grandmother wanted was a hit. She loved every bite of it and for such a small woman she really put a dent in her portion of 3 cutlets and a half serving of pasta. The Chinese ribs were unexpected but awesome as well. The clams were small but packed with flavor, the pasta dishes, al dente. The food was delicious. Portions were average to generous, no one left hungry.The entire staff made us feel comfortable and at home, we laughed, joked, and stayed a while. The service was above and beyond. Several waitstaff and servers came to wish my grandmother Happy Birthday and when the time came they served her ice cream cake with a candle. She was overjoyed and overwhelmed by the family's love and the care of the staff. Even other customers came over to say hello! The environment of this place is casual and familial. Thank You, Parm NYC UWS!!!  For making the day amazing. My grandmother says she wants to come back again very soon. We'll do our best to make that happen.",3,1,2
109,RP M.,"Neptune City, NJ",0,3,3,5.0,6/26/2017,"I came to sample the much talked about meatball sandwich which may or may not be the most popular item on their menu... Cmon the place is called PARM...Anyway I noticed that they served CHINESE RIBS ...Huh?Wayment! Ain't this an Italian joint?! Nevertheless I took a chance based on the recommendation of the lovely Nicole to whom I dedicate this quote from Orison Swett Marsden found at the end of my rant and review....Sooooooo my friends and I had the ribs and a side of rigatoni (Nicole's recommendation) And to our surprise and DELIGHT this weird sounding combo was a symphony of sweet and savory DELICIOUSNESS ....BUT WAIT there's more .,Like I mentioned I came for the meatball sandwich and I must say BRAVO!!!  PARM you have a new fan/stalker..The meatball was juicy and tasty and at first I thought I needed more sauce (cause I'm a boss )  but with every bite I realized that it was NOT needed. The true star was shining through ..Yaaaaaaaaaaaaas Come through MEATBALL!! ....Thank you PARM for your exceptional employee Nicole and wonderful food "" Sweeter than the perfume of roses is a reputation for a kind, charitable, unselfish nature; a ready disposition to do to others any good turn in your power.""",,,

111,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,3.0,7/22/2015,"I had an OK experience at UWS Parm last night after wanting to try it for a while. We started with the delicious garlic bread they give you and a Sauvignon Blanc bottle ($45). The wine could have been a little colder for my taste but it was also 95 degrees out yesterday. Our party of 7 was sat right next to the kitchen's stairway and the heat rising from the kitchen so it was like sitting next to a furnace.The service could not have been warmer or friendlier. Our blonde, female server was professional and helpful. We started with the mozzarella, which is no longer served warm, but now room temperature. It lacked salt and creaminess. I asked for bread with it, which was stale.My entree was the Chicken Francaise with a salad. I'm watching my figure and would have preferred the spicy rigatoni, which I tried a bite of and it was DELICIOUS! The chicken was moist and lemony.This place has decent food and the service was on point last night. I wouldn't hate going again if I were in the neighborhood.",1,,
112,Bobby H.,"Spencerport, NY",115,6,1,5.0,7/6/2017,"Parm is an interest place..not what I was expecting, kind of a dinner like atmosphere. However the food was great. I got the chicken parm and it is a top 3 chicken parm I've ever had. Definitely recommend.",,,
113,Christina S.,"Huntington, NY",164,79,463,5.0,4/14/2016,"Ate at Parm two nights ago and it was awesome. I had the Meatball Parm Hero ($15), which consisted of the juiciest meatballs I've ever had. It was topped with their own homemade fresh mozzarella to boot. My friend had the chicken parm, which was good, but nothing special.The Spumoni Ice Cream Cake ($12) was beautiful to look at and was the perfect end to my meal. Layers of pistachio, strawberry, and chocolate ice cream were topped with a vanilla icing, and surrounded by oreo crumbles and rainbow sprinkles. In addition to the amazing food, our waiter was the best. He was super helpful, attentive and polite. The restaurant is physically beautiful, with a real old school Italian feel and skylights in the back room. I can't wait to go back!",3,,

115,Michelle W.,"New York, NY",520,1155,48,4.0,2/29/2016,"Came here for a big group dinner and the overall experience was pretty great. Food came out quick, hot and delicious and service was on point. What more can you ask for?We sampled a variety of the appetizers - meatballs, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, garlic bread and calamari. All were delicious, but the stand outs were the prosciutto and meatballs. The mozzarella was good, but I personally loved the prosciutto. It wasn't too salty and was a perfect combination with the garlic bread and mozzarella. The meatballs were super good as well, but they do cook them medium rare. I know you can eat beef rare (which I typically do), but something about rare meatballs kind of freak me out. Not like that stopped me though, I still inhaled a few and they were absolutely delicious. I suggest just requesting them to be fully cooked through if anything. For the entree, I had the penne scampi. So good, but very creamy and heavy. I eat a lot and I ended up taking half my entree home. It came in very handy when midnight rolled around. The menu itself is small, but you have great options and you'll definitely be able to find something that you want. The restaurant has an open kitchen which adds a pretty cool touch to the overall look and feel. The food was enjoyable, service was great and all in all, it was great. Definitely worth trying out!",6,1,4

One order is probably only enough for 2 people.  No bread given to the table, but I did see some being brought to other tables so you probably just have to ask for it.The Cavatelli Bolognese was tasty and cooked to my liking.  The Chicken Parm hero was outstanding and a great combination of flavors and textures.  I also loved the flavor of the String Beans Oreganata.  I would call the food here casual Italian gourmet but it is by no means rustic. Service was great and I highly recommend making a reservation on Open Table.  It was empty when we arrived just before 6 pm and completely packed within the hour.It's Manhattan; it's the Upper West Side.  Definitely on the pricier side, but honestly I expect that up here.  Was it delicious and filling?  Definitely.  That alone would lure me back again.",4,,1

Best choice ever. I'm very picky when it comes to pasta, and this is the best pasta dish for scampi ever. I think it's my new favorite. The penne they use for it has wonderful texture and their sauce is so perfectly balanced and seasoned. Ugh, I'm salivating thinking about it right now. The place is really cute and pretty easy to find. The waitstaff were very nice, but they didn't have enough staff during lunch time, so it took forever to try and get someone's attention.

Updated review","Sorry to say I have returned to Parm on the Upper  Westside on more then one occasion only to have negative experiences, both with the food and service! After speaking to a neighbor who had similar experiences I decided to mention this. I always try to give any establishment a pass for a negative experience. I really like this place, time to step up! I'm Goumba Johnny and I approved this message",,,
125,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1635,64753,5.0,12/17/2014,"I don't go to Parm that often. Not because the food isn't great, but because it's packed, there's always a wait, and it's kind of pricey.Now that there's a huge new location on the Upper West Side though, I could see myself coming here more often. It's still pricey, but I can look past that for what is now of the best choices for a great meal in this neighborhood.The menu is kind of confusing, with most stuff placed in well-defined categories, but then a bunch of items scattered randomly around (look carefully or you might miss the Warm Mozz, the Baked Ziti and the Italian Combo). I've tried most of the greatest hits before, but gave some of them another try as well as some great new stuff on my first visit here:- Mozz Sticks ($9 for 5)These were better when I had them at the other location only because they were served piping hot there. These were a little more on the lukewarm side, but were still excellent.- Warm Mozz ($12)Even more mozzarella, we tried this on the recommendation of our server, who mentioned how amazing the little ball was, which we should eat immediately while it was fresh. I enjoyed the crispy, butter garlic bread that it came with even more, so I would probably go with just the garlic bread itself, unless you happen to really love cheese.- Spicy Tuna Bruschetta ($14 for 2 pieces)This looked like a new menu item, which I never saw at the original location, and I'm glad we tried it. Two pieces of the great crispy bread were topped with plenty of chopped up spicy tuna. A little different from most of the stuff air, but excellent as well.- Chicken Parm Platter ($19)At Parm, you must obviously get the parm - the only question is whether to get it as a hero or as a platter. I would suggest getting the platter, as that gets you a big brick of the excellent Baked Ziti as an accompaniment, saving you from having to order it separately for $14 itself. The parm really is excellent, as is the ziti, which you should have them include the meat gravy on.- Orecchiette Classico ($16)This is a perfectly done rendition of the classic Orecchiette dish. The little chunks of sweet sausage are well seasoned and so tasty, and the bitter broccoli rabe adds to it to make a perfect bite.- House Turkey on a roll ($9, but I got charged $14)We went a little overboard with the ordering here, but I've always wanted to try this sandwich after hearing on several occasions how good it was. I always put off ordering it in favor of the Parm, so we finally went for it, and it was as good as I've heard. The soft seeded roll is perfect, as is the surprisingly moist turkey and the very simple shredded lettuce and tomato on top. Definitely try this sandwich.- Zeppoles ($8 for 6)Dessert isn't on the menu, but our server read us the options, which included what sounded like a few new ones. We stuck with the old zeppoles for one of them, which gets you 6 of the little fried balls, in 3 different flavors: 2 plain, 2 filled with jelly and 2 filled with chocolate. They are ok, but not nearly as good as the ice cream cakes. - Almond Joy Ice Cream Cake ($12)This is just incredible. I think they occasionally rotate in an additional flavor, as an alternative to the classic option of chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, and this one is really excellent. Topped with a little almond joy candy bar, this is an absolute must, and one of the best ice cream desserts you can find in a restaurant. It's like a fancy Carvel Ice Cream Cake, complete with those addictive chocolate crunchies.We passed on the much pricier Main Courses ($22 - $35 each), as the one that stood out the most to me, the San Gennaro Ribs, sounded like the ones we tried at the Chinese dinner from the Soho location, which weren't particularly good. There are so many good sandwich, pasta and platter options though that you don't even need an entree to make a really satisfying meal. I'll be back to try some of those other items from the menu that I might have missed.",22,12,17

It was a spot-on flashback, right down to the vinegary salad mom used to make. Anyway, the setting is just great, with oldies playing and a festive atmosphere full of warmth and smiles and liberally flowing red wine. Staff was super-nice, and everything came out really quick. We tried the baked clams (gorgeously plump and tender, traditional butter+bread crumbs preparation), chicken parm (crisp and juicy, with a lovely quilt of mozz and a vibrant sauce featuring top-quality tomatoes), Sunday salad (classic, simple) and turkey sandwich (absolutely incredible - moist meat, savory almost like it had pan drippings in it). It's definitely spendy for casual Italian food, but it's definitely more delicious than most casual Italian food, so there ya go.",3,1,2

Food came to the table in reasonable amount of time. Love all the appetizers i.e. Mozzarella, meat ball which were not Raw , The tomato sauce was fresh didn't taste acidic. The parm salad was terrific. We ate family style and it's the best way to taste many dishes. So we also had calamari. Nice garlic bread. Yum!!Veal with salad on top was great. I liked that it had the lemon on the side and chicken parm for me, I have had better but was ok, A bit dry and thick. Italian potatoes again yum and stuff artichoke amazing.

131,Mike N.,"New York, NY",131,266,48,2.0,2/2/2016,"To put it simply - disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away based on things I've heard, however, I actually just left feeling angry about how much money we paid for mediocre food. I'll start with appetizers, we got the mozzarella, hoping that it came with garlic bread. It didn't. Add on a side of garlic bread and you have a $18 dollar app, which was unremarkable at best. The garlic bread was great, but the mozz was less than ok. Had that sort of flavorless taste, and gluey consistency. Almost seemed like it was taken right from the fridge to our table. Now to the entrees. The chicken parm dinner is $25 dollars and comes with a side of pasta. I wanted to substitute pasta, however doing so would be an up-charge, so I stuck with the rotini it came with. The pasta wasn't very good, a little overcooked and the sauce was mildly spicy, but uninspiring. Some of the other pasta dishes people had around the restaurant looked good, but its unfortunate you can't substitute. The chicken parm itself was good, not great. Weirdly cold on the inside, but everything else was ok.  I will say that our server was great, very funny and attentive, and found the rest of the staff to be great as well.  Other than that, I was really disappointed. I have no problem spending money on good food, however I could have gotten a meal of similar quality for a quarter of the price at places throughout New York. I saw pictures on this website of the chicken parm hero, so I may try that, maybe for take-out, but overall I was unimpressed.",1,,1
132,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,11/1/2015,"Parm UWS takes reservations: a must when it's Friday night and everyone plus their grandmother is in the mood for chicken parm. The Columbus Ave location has a few more options on the menu than the Mulberry Street sister, like the Saratoga Club and Chinese ribs, so come here unless you really want to fight for a seat at Parm Nolita. Parm serves essentially Italian fast food at Manhattan prices. Five mozzarella sticks for $9? A platter of chicken parm plus salad for almost $20? A small chicken parm sandwich on a semolina roll for $10? Don't get me wrong, I loved the chicken parm hero, and I would like to see it take on David Chang's fried chicken sandwich in the ultimate battle of Manhattan's best sandwiches, but at bottom, this is something you could buy at a cornerstore bodega for much cheaper. My Italian combo came packed with spicy meats and cheeses, and I think the sesame hero holds up much better to drier fillings, whereas the marinara sauce on any of the parm versions causes the bread to sag. Sadly said no to the many renditions of the ice cream cake. NEXT TIME: Almond Joy ice cream cake; rigatoni; meatball parm",5,2,3

Definitely make a reservation. It seems like it would also be good for groups. Parm, where is your complimentary bread basket for the table?! That is my biggest complaint. How does an Italian place skip the bread? Oh well, more room for food. I ordered the eggplant parm and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. We both loved our dishes, but I think the chicken was the winner in my book. The pasta that came on the side was amazing and the mozzerella was so fresh!

Where it sounds like they're being super nice, but really they are just working through a script and you are just one of dozens of tables they will serve that night.The food was pretty good. I believe I had the pork milanese, which was well fried and seasoned, but not a life changing dish. A bit pricey.We shared a slice of the smores ice cream cake for dessert. This dish is so tailor made for adults who want to be kids again, getting a carvel cake for their birthdays.

Updated review","Went back a second time.  Ordered the Cesar salad with shrimp which was good. Split the chicks parm with a friend. For a second time, it was very dry and tough. I guess that's the way they come here.  Don't think I will be back a third time.Also,be warned they seem to consistently seat  large parties of 10 to 20 people which makes the back dining room extremely loud.",,,
143,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,356,4.0,8/5/2015,"The thing I remember most about my visit was how loud the space is.  I could barely hear my tablemate.  Granted, we were sat next to a table of ~15 people who were having themselves a wonderful time, and that contributed to the volume, but it felt like it'd have been an issue even without that group and, another time I popped in here, it also felt overwhelming enough that I didn't want to stay.  So maybe don't bring your UWS-based grannies here, their hearing-aids will short-circuit.Actually, no, there's something I remember even more than the volume: the ice cream cake.  This thing... this remarkable thing... I guess it amounts to only about four scoops of ice cream, but it feels like so much more, this towering wedge of frozen beauty, like the Flatiron Building brought to you on a plate and tasting like strawberry shortcake.  The flavors change regularly, but I can't imagine this cake would ever or could ever be bad.Volume and ice cream aside, the food here is as good as the food at the original Parm in Soho, but the space lacks the dim, cozy charm of that original space.  Up on the UWS you get a more functional, though bustling, eatery.  Not bad at all, and service was very friendly and attentive, but it made me miss the original.Some food notes:- The baked zitti topped with heavenly whipped ricotta -- I don't think I'd ever be able to come to Parm and not order this.  It's just baked zitti, in theory it shouldn't be special, but something about that whipped cheese on top elevates it.  (For some reason, this isn't offered on the takeout menu.  This briefly fouled my mood one hungry evening.) - There's a small menu of vegetable sides, all solid to good.- The parm sandwich itself is delicious, and I'd recommend it on a roll over a hero.  The roll is kind of a potato roll, while the hero is more of an Italian bread, heavy on the sesame.  The hero is good but something about the roll works wonders.3.5 stars. I'd round down for the space and the volume... but the memory of the service, the ziti, and the cake nudge my rating up instead.",3,1,1

Previously I ordered from them and although the chicken parm was delicious they forgot some items on my order. Weeks later on a lazy Sunday around 5pm I decided to go all out with a guest over and sample their half their appetizer menu and order one of the delicious chicken parms I have heard so much about. My order included the $7 Garlic Bread Deluxe, $14 Calamari, The famous  $9 Mozz Sticks,  and for the entree a  $14 Chicken Parm on a Sub-Roll. The order was not taken care of, the Garlic Bread Deluxe hardly had 4 pieces of bread, which were very small dry and burnt on the bottom. The hand full of calamari had sauce broken open and tossed all over it, by the time it arrived to me it was a soggy mess. The entree Chicken Parm on a Sub-Roll, the main dish and reason I was ordering from them was missing. I walked the order to the restaurant and received a full refund. However the time I ordered isn't a busy time for them, and this isn't the first time they have ruined my order.

The menu is simple.On our most recent visit, the two of us wanted to sit at the bar. There were three open stools, but none directly next to each other. We were hoping that the bartender or host might be able to ask one of the patrons already seated whether we could squeeze in. However, to our surprise, the hostess -- a red head, wearing glasses, who seemed to be working her last shift before quitting -- could not have been less helpful. When we asked about moving a stool, she remarked, ""it's first come, first serve."" I said, ""sure, I understand. However, I assume it is good for the bartender and the restaurant to fill the seats. How can we shift things around so that my girlfriend and I can get seated?"" She simply said, ""it's the bar, I don't care.""So, we moved the stools around ourselves and the bartender didn't seem happy. So, we ended up just sitting in a booth in the restaurant. And, per the usual, the food was fine and we left full. But, the takeaway for us is that this restaurant really doesn't care about its customers or pleasing patrons.

171,Laura I.,"New York, NY",138,140,90,5.0,6/17/2015,"I've been a big fan of Parm for a while but this was my first time visiting the UWS location which is much more spacious, meaning no wait this time! The food was just as good as downtown and the service was even better. I like that they give some fresh mozzarella and garlic bread to start. They also have tvs hidden under paneling if there is some sports event that is on. The bar was also impressive so I imagine it would be a good place to grab a drink if you are waiting for a table. I love their mozz so I still added on an order. I really love their traditional sandwiches like eggplant parm and meatball subs, but I have a soft spot for the Saratoga club which is unique to Parm. Anything that involves potato chips on a sandwich is meant to be for me. My husband had the turkey sandwich. The turkey is so flavorful and the bread has the perfect amount of crunch but isn't too hard to bite it to.Save some room for dessert and order the Spumoni ice cream cake. Parm leftovers the next day are always a treat anyway.",1,,

173,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,4.0,2/3/2016,"As much as I like this place and want it to stick around--especially since I'm moving to the neighborhood--I don't totally disagree with the negative sentiments express here.  First for the restaurant itself.  This is the maiden voyage of expanding the Parm concept that Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone started at the original Torrisi to multiple locations.  The UWS can be a culinary dead zone in certain ways so I completely understand why they picked this area.  The setup is just plain old strange though.  They have these huge windows in front that they need to get rid of.  Instead, they like to try and seat every damned person who comes in at some crappy tables they have set up there.  Don't let them seat you in front as I agree with other reviewers that this area sucks.  There is a draft which really sucks in the winter, the seats aren't comfortable and frankly it just feels cheap.  It's befitting a typically pizzeria, not a restaurant where you can easily spend $50 per person.  When you check in with the hostess, specifically ask for the back.  Service is friendly enough but every time the servers been very slow and without any real personality.  They don't make Parm feel like the old school, neighborhood atmosphere like it's intended to; they make it feel like just another random restaurant.The food measures up to the original Parm from what I've tried thus far.  The crispy zucchini is the best appetizer on the menu.  The slivers of zucchini are cooked just right and you'll get plenty of them.  I didn't ""get"" the buffalo cauliflower; not bad for what it is--it's exactly what it sounds like, some stalks of cauliflower tossed in buffalo sauce with blue cheese--but just not up my alley.  The fresh mozzarella was better than I remembered at the other Parm but I still wish they gave a bigger portion for the price.  I haven't had baked clams here as I hate how small the portion is, but I would expect them to get these right (as other reviewers seem to echo).  They don't give you bread by default but you can ask for it.  The meatballs are on point here.  Pricey, but great.  With both beef and pork used, they're crisp on the outside and moist on the inside with not too much seasoning.  On downside is that the tomato sauce is just ok here which is kind of disappointing.  The eggplant parm here is like eggplant lasagna in how it's stacked which is a good thing; on the other hand it needs sauce to be added to it.  The baked ziti is also well done in terms of both execution and cooking, with a dollop of ricotta on top.  They have the spicy pink sauce here that's so popular at Carbone, so if that's in your wheelhouse try it here for cheaper.  I wasn't blown away but it was a decent pink sauce with a little kick to it; it often comes as a pasta side with entrees, so be sure to ask your server if you're interested.  I haven't gotten around to trying their chicken parm at this location, but again I'd expect them to get it right.  Just wish that tomato sauce was a bit better like the original Torrisi.  As for drinks, their negronis are good but small; skip the gimmicky beet negroni they feature and just go for the classic.  I've only had 1 bottle of wine here but it was decent and priced well.  I suppose the wine is the way to go then if you have a group.I don't expect this Parm nor any other they open to match the magic that was present at the original Torrisi where Carbone and Torrisi were present in the kitchen.  Perhaps I was spoiled in that regard.  They've done a decent job with the food, although some reviews here point to valid inconsistencies.  My bigger issue is the atmosphere.  Hire some staff who will buy into the concept you're selling, either lower your prices or give people a little more for their money (because fresh mozzarella is not expensive to make), and demolish that awful front window with a sledgehammer.  Run the place like a family-run business, not a bland corporate entity.  It's more difficult to do things this way, but it's much more sustainable in the long run.  And it will successfully create the experience of an old school Italian restaurant that you're trying so diligently to recreate.  Rounding this up to 4 stars for now based on the quality of the food specifically (which is what I normally focus on) and looking the other way on the other stuff for now.  But I will be back.",6,2,3
174,Stacy A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,1/23/2017,I used to love this place but last night was a huge disappointment.  First they changed their menu and removed the warm mozz.  Second we were rushed to order and then our food arrived before or appetizer.  I was served by about 4 different wait staff and felt like I was being rushed out of the restaurant.   Let me sit and enjoy my expensive dinner please! Will be a long time before I revisit this place.  Disappointing because I love their chicken parm and spicy sauce...,2,,
175,Erica M.,"Manhattan, NY",16,66,0,2.0,5/9/2016,"I had a disappointing experience here on mothers day. The service was horrible and the food ""meh"". Our server was very rude and gave us condescending remarks when we asked questions about the menu. We initially ignored him and enjoyed our appetizers/ drinks (hence the 2 star review instead of 1) but realized 30 min after we finished that a. no one cleared our dirty plates and b. our entrees were no where in site. We asked the server for eta on the food and he replied ""about that....we are having a problem in the kitchen and ran out of eggplant. I was told 10 min ago it would be ready in 8, sooooo hopefully soon."" I understand things happen in the kitchen, but be transparent with your customers. We were sitting around at a dirty table starving, when if we had known we would have changed our orders to something w/o eggplant. We then asked for more bread and he responded ""Ill see what I can do."" Huh?!Once we asked to speak to the manager he was nice enough to bring us another round of drinks, but it did little to make me ever want to go back. No one came around to clear our table until we asked multiple times, which provided the ambiance of a dirty fast food place.No real highlight about the food, you can easily get better parm elsewhere.

178,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,173,132,3.0,12/31/2014,"I grew up eating Brooklyn-Italian food which is vastly different from Manhattan-hoity toity-Italian food. The former is the legitimate, real deal, stick to your ribs kind of cuisine. The latter is an overpriced imitation of the former. With that being said, Parm UWS made a valiant effort in trying to be the 'Brooklyn-Italian' joint it isn't.  On a Sunday evening [at 6:30PM] during the holidays, this location was extremely busy. There were only a few walk-in tables free and I'm sure there were no reservations available. Food:Mozz Sticks [$9]: The server told us that these would be the ""best mozzarella sticks of [our] lives."" Clearly, this guy has never been to the bar in my neighborhood that serves mozz sticks 100x better than these. These were luke warm at best, meaning the cheese wasn't molten and stringy when ripped apart. The ratio of stick to cheese filling was sub-par. At least the breading was flavorful. Calamari [$14]: The breading on the calamari was soggy. At this price point, they could surely do better. Made to Order Mozz [$12]: This was one dish that I was truly excited about. Nothing makes me happier than fresh mozzarella on warm garlic bread. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the mozzarella was fresh, but swimming in a pool of oil. There just wasn't enough to cover four large pieces of garlic bread. The garlic bread, if you could believe it, was lacking in flavor- almost like it was burnt. I would have liked to see more butter and garlic on it. Baked Ziti with Meat Sauce [$17]: I was fairly pleased with the baked ziti. It was a nice sized portion with a large dollop of ricotta on top. Also, there was A LOT of cheese, crispy cheesey goodness. Next time, I would probably forgo the meat sauce as I'm not typically a red sauce kind of person. The more cheese, the better. Dessert: Zeppole [??]: The kitchen was having some issues with getting the dessert out. They apparently ran out of paper for the baskets and this was why it took them so long to deliver our order.Let me tell you though, I'm glad we waited. There are three kinds of zeppole- regular without a filling, jam, and a type of nutella. All were coated with a dusting of warm sugar and it was absolutely delicious. I wanted to lick the paper. Because they had technical difficulties, they comped our dessert, which was very nice of them. Drink:Club Master [$12]: Meh, there was a very sad strawberry on top of my gin drink. There was too much ice which watered down the whole thing. The cocktail list doesn't really look worth it.Service:The service was very friendly. They kind of bend over backwards for their guests, which isn't necessarily a bad thing when it's genuine. I ended up spending in the ballpark of $80, which, I think is not really worth it.",7,4,4

I paid for my sandwich and when the bag was handed to me, I took it home and put it in the fridge for my train ride today. Imagine my horror when I opened the package on the train and, faint from hunger, discovered THAT THERE WAS NO CHICKEN CUTLET ON MY CHICKEN CUTLET SANDWICH.  And NO SPICY MAYO side either. I guess it's a fine mozzarella sandwich, if that's what someone who is NOT ME wanted, but I didn't pay $16.33 for a mozzarella sandwich.  I'm truly disappointed in PARM and this super-uber bad service.  I mean c'mon, people, THE NAME OF THE SANDWICH IS CHICKEN CUTLET SANDWICH.  I know, I know, first-world problems, but still.",,,
182,Arlene Y.,"New York, NY",535,276,287,1.0,12/20/2015,"where to begin? First off I had called ahead and changed the reservation time to an hour later. When I arrived, the restaurant could not find our reservation at all. The fact that they didn't have our reservation was already a red flag. We had a group of 6 (4 adults and 2 kids). Instead of placing us in the back where the booths were, they placed us at a table in the front. Sitting in the front was not enjoyable because it was freezing and the seats were not comfy. I assumed they placed us in the front because of our party size and that the place was filled up. I went to the back to use the bathroom and saw 4 empty booths that could have easily fit all of us, and it was warm!! Then comes the food. My sister raved on and on about the ""fresh mozzarella"" apparently it came with warm bread, melted mozzarella, and drizzled olive oil.  When it arrived, it was just a slab of mozzarella ( with no bread or olive oil) My sister was shocked and asked the waitress if this was the right order, and the waitress answered by saying the menu had changed. What a disappointment. Then comes the shrimp scampi pasta. The pasta was terrible, it tasted like hamburger helper- not something you eat at an italian restaurant.To top it off the service was slow and they kept forgetting our orders. My friend asked for a soda twice. I waited for my fried clams to come and they never arrived, so I decided to cancel.sorry never coming back here again.",6,1,

The meat is tender and moist (not to mention a generous serving), and the roll of bread doesn't fill you up with too much carb.I've also tried the garlic bread (crispy and delectable), the fresh mozzarella (creamy and smooth) and the fries (which are always dusted with Parmesan cheese and taste like perfection!).And the service is always really friendly.Thumbs up here!",,,

187,Shanique P.,"Yonkers, NY",7,16,5,4.0,1/25/2015,"I went out to Parm on a wendesday night and I was much more crowded than I would have expected for 6pm on a Wednesday night.  I went with two other people and they told us it would be 45min until we could be seated at a table. We sat at the bar to wait and had drinks and mozzarella sticks.  Those mozzarella sticks were delicious! Not too much breading and the cheese was so fresh and satisfying, I love mozzarella sticks and I would 100% of them again. We closed out our check when our table was ready (approx. 40min later). Once we were seated we were waiting for garlic bread that we had ordered at the bar and transferred to the table. This was the worst part of the experience because the lost our order ticket and the garlic bread didn't come out until the main course arrived. The chef apologized and sent out an order of fresh mozzarella on the house, that made me feel much better about the situation. The garlic bread was amazing and paired with the fresh mozzarella, I was in heaven. I had ordered chicken parmesan with a side of baked ziti and the portions were good. The chicken parm was  very good but the ziti wasn't my favorite, I must have gotten an end piece because a lot of it was too hard around the edges for me. Lastly we ordered dessert, the classic ice cream cake and the brownie a la mode. I could have done without the classic ice cream cake because it didn't taste that great and it was $12! Way over priced, but it was a large slice. The brownie a la mode was good but very coffee heavy. The ice cream was coffee and the sauce was expresso. It was warm, good sized and chocolate so I really can't complain. All in all I would come back to this restaurant. The service was good even though was a long wait and the mozzarella sticks and garlic bread were good enough to return even if the service was bad.

They give you a choice of spaghetti sauce on your pasta or spicy sauce. I was hesitant to order the spicy, but Toby the waiter convinced me.

We hadn't been to the other restaurants but have heard they were phenomenal, so decided to take advantage of the new one so close to the museum. It was a bit of a roller coaster. I know they're new, I know there is growing pains, but that doesn't exactly make a mediocre meal that costs almost 200 bucks OK. First off, the good:Friendly staff - everyone was very friendly even if they seemed confused about what to do sometimes Pretty good food - mozzarella and garlic, crispy zucchini, buffalo cucumber, the baked ziti and veal were all good, although not the most generous portions. Also very good zeppole that are worth ordering.  The Bad:Sides came out first - we ordered 3 veggie plates as sides (which was how our server recommended). They then came out quickly with our mozzarella appetizer. We said uh, why are we getting our sides before dinner? And they said because that way we don't have to wait! Er, ok... But needless to say, we had zero sides left by the time dinner got there. Served raw pork, and nothing was done to remedy it - our pork Milanese came out raw. Like very pink in the middle. Picture attached. Thank god my fiancé noticed it because we were all about to dig in. When telling our server, there was no apology, just ""I'll get a new one for you right away."" The new one came out when everyone was done eating, which was frustrating, but it was cooked through and tasted good. Parm roll - they had a personal sandwich option that was a roll. It was 9 bucks, and my nephew just really wanted chicken Parmesan. He ordered that roll, and when it came out it looked like something you get in a cheap cafeteria. It was small, and looked mushy. He was not impressed, and gave it 2 out of 5 stars. A drop of cappuccino - our cappuccinos came in tiny little cups that were half full. Not even consistently half full as mine was lower than my moms, who had MAYBE 75% full. Poor quality control all around. In and off itself this isn't a big deal, but it was frustrating after the other poor execution. Conclusion:You know how some new places open, be it a restaurant or a store, and you go in and think ""wow, they know what they're doing!""...this isn't the case at Parm. A bunch of uncertainty, some good food some not very good food, and just overall shaky execution made this a ""meh"" experience. I went from this place is pretty good at the beginning, to I probably won't come by the end of the meal. With so many options around, it's hard to go back to a meh place when there are plenty of better places!",2,,

The wait was long even though we had reserved.With that said and done, my rating is more solely on the food. Even though the food was good, it was not good enough for the price. A friend had the fish, and that I was terribly small. I could eat 10 of them and still be hungry.

Now not only is every sandwich off the dinner menu (so sad they were all so good!) but they only have 2 kinds of parm (chicken and eggplant). The portions have also gotten smaller. Do not get the baked clams as they are the size of steamers, smaller than any baked clam you've seen. The ziti portion is small as well which I don't remember from a few months ago when I raved about it to friends.

The service was ridiculous. The waiter blamed us for not insisting when we ordered that they bring the main dishes after we're finished with the first courses. What's wrong with him? In serving another table, he tipped the salad bowl and poured dressing all over the tile floor. No one cleaned it up. Fusilli that came with our chicken parm order was so spicy hot that we left it uneaten. It was awful. The chicken was not pounded. It was a small piece of chicken breast heavily breaded with cheese dumped and melted on it. Amateur hour for the chef du jour. Eggplant parm was soggy, not crisp.
