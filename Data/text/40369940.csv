1,Melissa L.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",147,14,23,4.0,10/30/2018,Food was on pointe. Coffee was standard. Service was quick and attentive. A total local dive with lots of character. Ate a spinach and feta omelette and it was delicious! Hubby had the French toast--also a hit. Looking for a local joint? This hits the mark!,1,,
2,Sarah W.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,1,0,5.0,11/11/2018,"This restaurant is by far the best restaurant I have been to in New York! The staff is friendly and very attentive!

21,Curtis H.,"Sparks, NV",138,297,508,2.0,2/22/2017,"Eh. So.Hmm....... How do I begin?  I can't say I really liked this place and I can't say I disliked it either.  It is located on the Upper East Side near the Metropolitan Museum and there are not a ton of dining options in the neighborhood.  What drew me in there was that it looked like an old school NYC place looks like.  Kind of a throwback to the 70s or earlier but very clean and super busy.  The place is small but I was seated right away and the service was quick.  Since the place is so small if you are sitting near the front you are likely to have people hovering over you while they wait for tables so if you don't like to be in close proximity go for the back of the room.  This is definitely a place for locals. The greeter called several of them by name as they came in so they must have a following in the area.  It took me a minute or two to realize that while the place is totally casual and many other folks were coming in wearing jeans and sweaters, that my jeans and sweater came Kohl's or Macys and these people were wearing Brooks Brothers and Burberry.  Par for the course in that neighborhood.  The biggest disappointment is the food for what you pay.  15.00 for a tuna melt is a bit steep.  Still since I was in NYC I knew that was not unusual.  But what I got was two pieces of toast served open face with a scoop of tuna on each and a melted slice of American cheese, a tiny spot of coleslaw and a pathetic pickle.  Head a few blocks east and find better food for the money.",6,,1

He looked stupid in it so I took it: you should be thanking me for saving the creep from himself.The New Amity is a great New York experience.

24,Charles B.,"San Diego, CA",42,4,0,1.0,9/24/2016,"Went here with my sister and caretaker, and I kid you not, their ""gyros"" had MAYONNAISE instead of yogurt and BREAKFAST SAUSAGE instead of shawarma.  Unbelievable.  Then our server was coughing all over our food and the entire restaurant, not even trying to cover his mouth.  Absolutely disgusting.  We were horrified.  This guy looked like he was stage 3 AIDs/bronchitis.  He was coughing on everything.  This was like biological terror, this guy should be locked up.Anyway, my sister's a total cookie monster so we bought a $3 cookie that was dipped in chocolate and we're thinking there's no way they can screw this up.  She took a bite and spit it out, and when I took a bite I realized I'm pretty sure they're using sand instead of flour.  And I think the chocolate may have been made of wax with a little brown food coloring, here ya go.My sister/caretaker walks me home after a good ol' fashioned chub 'n' tuck and we vape some phat clouds on the way there.  We get home and realize my blue beanie is missing.  I call the restaurant and the conversation went like this:Me: ""Hey, do you guys have a blue hat?  I was just there.""Him: ""I don't know, we got blue hats, what do you want?""Me: ""Well I was just there, can you look and see?""Him: ""It's on the other side of the room, if somebody comes and gets it, they get it.""Me: ""WTF dude?!?! I'm a paying customer!!  I was just there!!""WTF, is this real life?Him: ""Okay, okay, I'll go look for you.  It's a blue hat, it's a blue hat.""Me: ""Okay, can you hold it for me?""Him: ""No, I don't know, if someone come, they get it, we put it to the front of the store.""I'm gonna come tomorrow and I'm gonna leave with something.  You know what I mean?  I don't know if it's gonna be a hat, it might just be an omelette.  Dude freakin' jacked my hat.",21,37,16

The food is served quickly and hot. Your coffee cup and water glass is always full. Portions are decent size. What more can you ask for from an American diner. I have only gone for breakfast (fan of the #2 Two eggs, choice of meat, homefries, toast, coffee). But I saw someone order the soup of the day, and it looked good.

26,Joshua L.,"New Haven, CT",364,216,0,2.0,9/30/2015,"Stayed over a friend's house and she had to work in the morning so I wanted to get some breakfast somewhere. A local diner would be perfect. It had good Yelp reviews and I liked the vibe so I figured it'd be solid.However, I had to say I left pretty underwhelmed.First of all, the menu is pretty meh. Even by diner standards. I know it's NYC, but I felt like there just wasn't a lot going on there. A few pretty meh sounding omelettes. A few breakfast specials.The place is very affordable I'll say. I spent 10 bucks, but honestly, I would've spent more for a more interesting menu selection.I ordered two eggs, wheat toast, sausage, and home fries. It came out with bacon. Oops.So they made me the sausage and another few minutes later, I had my breakfast again. Except by now my toast isn't even close to hot. And the sausage was... yeah. Kinda gross.The home fries were also pretty bland. I had to add a bunch of salt.It was all pretty fast. And cheap. And the guys there seemed nice.But overall, I had a pretty meh experience. But if you want meh and you want it fast and cheap, this is your place!",2,1,3

It was a quick walk down some beautiful residential streets on the UES. There were four of us and they sat us in a booth. While the booth was a bit cramped, the seats were oh so comfortable!!  I could have sat there all afternoon! The service we had was spectacular, all due to our server Jesus! He made the restaurant for us! The food was awesome... good American food and not overly priced. We were all pleased with our selections. If you're looking for a classic NY diner, check it out!",,,

Updated review","I would like to back up a few fellows reviewers about that is an average diner, as traditional it can get, as old as the ""dinosaur"", there are really a few of them left in the neighborhood. However if you are just hungry, not looking for any delicacies / fine dinning, this place is it!Pasta in white clam source $16.00, tasted kinda bland, my 6 points of 10, but the servicing size made me speechless.Buffalo Wings $9.95, they looked simply fried chicken, and I mentioned that the buffalo wings shouldn't look like fired chicken, and they said this is the way they do it there!I believe I wasn't getting the actual Buffalo Wings, the kitchen made mistake!",4,2,2

34,Nicole T.,"Manhattan, NY",83,271,11,4.0,5/31/2016,"Mediocre diner food but FANTASTIC service. This place is awesome. The staff here is SUPER nice and seem to know all the locals and regulars by name (and nickname). They were so kind to us, even with our toddler, and made us feel like we were at home. If we lived in the area, we'd probably make this a regular place because the service is so good. The food is great, typical NYC diner food - nothing too spectacular but all the usual finds like tuna melts and 24 hour breakfast and terrible burnt coffee diner.  They will always make sure your coffee and water cup are full. Although this place always looks packed, because the service is so fast, they turn the tables over quickly so you're sure to get in and out pretty fast.",1,,

40,Karen A.,"Oneonta, NY",3,39,67,3.0,12/1/2015,"Looking for a place to eat before going to the Guggenheim and this place is close (by NY standards - 10 minute walk). The service is great to the point where I was surprised that I had to ask for a coffee refill. Fast and friendly. The menu is pretty standard diner with enough options for just about everyone, I think, unless you're looking for something fancy.The coffee was OK - strong and they serve real half and half. I had French toast with bacon and my husband had a Belgian waffle, also with bacon. My French toast was good, not great. The syrup is basic institutional, ok, not great. The bacon was lean and substantial (not super thick, but not thin either), but a few slices were overcooked to the point of being almost burnt. Not bad enough to send it back, but that, combined with cold butter for a Belgian waffle (it just doesn't melt) and just standard fare makes it a solid 3 stars. Prices are good for Museum Mile, I guess. With our two breakfasts, a coke and a cup of coffee, the bill was $35. The bacon took the meals up $4 each, but they brought 4 slices. For this area of town, we would definitely go back to this $$ solid three stars vs. trying some of the $$$ fancy places with limited menus. We're pretty basic people.",5,3,2

Well, when I got there and ordered my gyro, it looked like an ABOMINATION from hell! Instead of yogurt, they put mayonnaise and instead of good old shawarma, it was BREAKFAST SAUSAGE. So after that, my buddy and I quickly left in disgust, but only after we came home, we realized that I lost my blue hat! I called the restaurant up and asked the staff whether or not they have seen my blue hat. The person answering the phone was extremely rude and said that they had the hat but who ever takes it, takes it. What the heck? I was a paying customer and they treated me like DIRT. I bet you those guys are sniffing my blue hat in the backroom as we speak. So gross, NEVER coming back again.",27,25,10

Had a Philly cheesesteak wrap and avocado stuffed with chicken salad. Very tasty. The fries - meh. But what makes this such a great lunch experience is the staff and other diners. Greeted warmly by Host, escorted to tiny table and introduced to 5 of the nicest, most endearing waitstaff you could ever meet. Charming, genuinely interested in our comfort, satisfaction with our menu choices. Everyone was someone you whose company you enjoyed. The exact Opposite of the professional crabs that other restaurants train to make you feel small.No one is ever more than a couple of feet from the other diners. No loud voices. Normal conversations at normal volumes. Didn't hear one voice raised to be heard. And the place was packed. Go there. Eat hearty and enjoy a pleasant lunch in the city.",,,

59,Richard W.,"Harrison, NJ",72,248,90,4.0,3/5/2015,"The bottom line: the fastest service I have ever seen from the friendliest waitstaff I have ever seen in an area where all you see is pretentious eateries.  Hit up Amity for lunch if you're hungry and want to be satisfied in a jiffy.  It's more expensive than diners in Queens, but reasonable given competing prices in the area, especially for lunch.We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite in between appointments and this place bailed us out.  We quickly decided on a chicken salad wrap with fries and then later on ordered some melon with cottage cheese (yeah, I'm trying to lose weight).  I have to tell you, after we ordered I looked up for a moment to utter a word and the next thing I knew the food was in front of me before I could even speak (plus sides of cole slaw and pickle).  Even in light of the discovery of the Higgs Boson, physicists still lack the fundamental knowledge required to explain this phenomenon of ultra fast chicken salad wrap delivery.  What's more is that the food actually tasted good.  What more do you want from a quick lunch in the city?A lot of people complain about the price and it is somewhat pricy.  However, as with all diners, I think the trick is to realize that you don't go to a diner to order Fra Diavolo.  You go to a diner to order breakfast food, appetizers, hamburgers or sandwiches, greek specialties, and dessert.  All of those categories of food there are reasonably priced especially considering that the diner is in the Upper East Side.In any case, give this place a try if you'd like to grab something quick and you want it to be good.",4,2,3

Just keep in mind it's a diner, by no means is it anything close to a 5 star restaurant, but the food is ok and fast. It's basically a place to get a quick bite. They serve lunch and dinner, not sure if it's any good. I did notice there were lots of locals in this restaurant.",,,

65,Robin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,14,2,2.0,2/19/2016,"A very average dining experience (heavy emphasis on ""average""), served with a generous side of disappointment. This diner is conveniently located near my workplace and I decided to go for a late lunch one day. Upon entering, I was greeted by a kitschy interior; the walls are painted with tacky nautical scenes. I sat at one of the booths on the left and found the table fixated uncomfortably close to the bench. I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap, which was essentially a Caesar salad wrapped in a tortilla (not that I was expecting anything more). The menu stated that the wrap comes with sides of fries, pickles, and coleslaw, but it came only with the fries. I asked the waiter about the latter two sides, and in a rude tone he replied, ""Oh, you want pickles and coleslaw? Okay, I'll get them for you,"" as though he was doing me a huge favor. Not only was the meal very average, but service, or perhaps lack thereof, also went downhill throughout my meal. To top it all off, the meal was pricey given the mediocre quality.I will not be returning.",1,,

The meat was juicy and tender, the salad crisp, the bun the non-fancy kind that holds everything together so much better than brioche (I still love a good brioche bun though). I've subtracted a star though because the fries and coleslaw were just average. But the burger, oh, the burger. And the service is excellent, fast and friendly.

Solid Greek diner style fare -- breakfast, lunch or dinner...snacks or full courses until you roll out of there. The noise level varies widely with the number of people so if you want it quiet you just have to hit it at the right time. I have no idea when that is, but when I was there from 4:30 to 6:00 PM on a Tuesday evening, it was mellow and I got a bit of work done on my laptop.The wait staff is terrific, the kitchen is fast, consistent and delicious.

Everything you would expect on the menu of a full-service diner from good omelettes, to homemade chicken soup to moussaka. Ingredients are fresh and food is prepared with care. The coffee is much better than standard diner coffee. The ambiance is cozy, clean and welcoming and the service is prompt and attentive.

The food was really good: Eggs over Medium with FOUR pieces of link sausage. Nobody ever gives you four pieces anymore, hash browns done perfectly, freshly squeezed oj, and good buttery toast.

I also tried the chicken noodle soup because it was freezing out and it was VERY good. Having Italian and Spanish grandmothers I consider myself an expert on chicken noodle soup.

132,Ali G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,30,0,4.0,9/29/2012,"We go out of our way to grab breakfast here on the weekends. Quick, attentive service with above average diner food. A huge selection and enormous portions.",,,
133,Rachel S.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/10/2011,"Service was rude.  Seated us at 8:30pm, but didn't let us know that they were going to rush us out (giving us our check at the same time as the food, pulling trash through our aisle of the restaurant for closing, turning of the music and most of staff staring us down to hurry us along).  Additionally, some of food was just bad (dried out baked potato, burnt pita bread) and it took 15 minutes to get a drink after asking 2x...and we were the only 2 customers in the place.  This is a never-go-backer.",6,,
134,Kara P.,"EA FALMOUTH, MA",6,32,7,4.0,1/6/2009,"It's hard to find a good diner in the Upper East Side. This one is a gem. Cozy booths. Old-school wiaters, older guys mostky, in black pants and white shirts. They are ina  rush. They write nothing down and get the order right every time. Typical sandwiches, anchovies in the Greek saled, nice chocolate egg cream at a reasonable price. Busy but rarely overly crowded.",1,,1
135,Rachel R.,"Cool, CA",374,1067,12,2.0,1/16/2006,"I've only been here for breakfast and I find it to be mostly mediocre generic American fare.  However, my 90-year-old grandfather loves it.  I guess they make eggs the way he likes them.",2,1,1
136,Andrea H.,"Remsenburg-Speonk, NY",9,145,0,4.0,4/17/2009,Great place that I used to go to all the time in high school.  The last time I was there though the service was a bit rude.  Good overall though.,,,
137,Scott S.,"Reston, VA",1,36,0,3.0,10/3/2009,"Good food and good service, but nothing to go out of your way for.  We ended up here when we couldn't find anything else near the Met.  They had typical Greek fare, but we opted for the chicken sandwich.  Prices were high, but so was the quantity of food - one meal was just right for two of us.",,,
138,A K.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,4.0,1/23/2009,"Good food, good service, slightly expensive.The thing about this neighborhood is that it is sort of captive - you don't have a lot of choices.  This is a wonderful, family owned diner that has been here forever.  The booths are comfy, the service is speedy but accomodating, and most importantly, the food is savory and the portions are, to me, on the large side.  This is a belly filling joint.  The waiters are like family, the staff tries to accomodate everyone (old people who walk slowly? They'll put you in a booth and take your coat and hang it. Kids in strollers? They'll fold the stroller and store it or if it has to go outside, they watch it.  Big groups? They add tables to the booths and accomodate you.  They'll even move you if you wanted a booth and sat at a table instead.).  The prices are not low and they recently went up, but that's what it takes to pay the rent in this neighborhood.  They will deliver even just a cup of coffee (and frankly, sometimes, I just want a cup of diner coffee). We love this place and eat there and order from there regularly.  This is one of the last old style diners in this area and its a real treasure.",,,
139,Puneet C.,"Hicksville, NY",7,407,0,4.0,1/15/2006,"A friend of mine works at the met and took me here for lunch one day. We waited a while for a table, but it was totally worth it! The food was excellent (especially the burgers!) and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely go back there when I'm in the neighborhood.",,,
