1,,5/13/2018,4,,"New York, NY",Jessica S.,3,1.0,36,"THIS RESTAURANT IS A GIANT RIP-OFF. DO NOT GO HERE.This morning I ordered scrambled egg whites, 2 veggies, cheese with avocado and turkey along with one ice coffee and they charged me $27. I did not even get potatoes or toast with it! This price is insane to me! The server handed me the bill and I could not identify one word on it. He did this on purpose for the outrageous charge. When I asked him about the charge he said I ordered ""fancy"" things like avocado and turkey. WHAT?! I did not order fillet mignon! He said talk to the Manager, if I do not like it. THIS IS WHY DINERS ARE BECOMING EXTINCT IN NEW YORK.Go to a hip and trendy restaurant for $19 you can get a much bigger meal and most places even include a mimosa for that price.",
2,,4/29/2018,1,,"New York, NY",Susan F.,638,4.0,125,"This is a good UES diner. Good for families and large groups. Tons of families with strollers. Lots of high chairs.  There is one section along side the bar with several large booths if you want to eat away from the mayhem.  The food has always been good. Salads, sandwiches etc. typical diner fare. Friendly service",
3,,8/3/2017,18,,"Brooklyn, NY",Cliff H.,535,4.0,101,"Really good diner great food for breakfast and brunch, I haven't had lunch or dinner. Quick service, friendly and attentive staff. Definitely a high recommendation for a good diner meal. The prices are reasonable for the upper east side, especially considering the quality of food and service",
4,,8/27/2017,3,,"Manhattan, NY",Roberta C.,9,3.0,77,"Silver star is our go to for diner food.It is on our block so it could not be closer.The food is good but it really needs to be better.I have had so many things here and have never said "" wow that was delicious""Silver Star we love you -just make better food",
5,,2/18/2018,0,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Keith R.,0,1.0,3,Very over priced and inconsistent.  You can get a better meal 40% cheaper within 3 blocks.   It's very likely that you will not get exactly what you ordered - particularly with takeout and it will be a different price every time. Check your bill carefully if you can read it.,1
6,1,11/10/2017,0,,"New York, NY",Jean D.,0,5.0,5,I have been going to Silver Star for my entire life. It has a huge menu so everyone can find something they like here. The waiters and waitresses are really nice people. I feel as if I am family when I go here. You won't be disappointed if you dine here.,
7,1,12/19/2016,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Andrew L.,0,3.0,14,"This diner ALWAYS has great food.  The reasons I gave it three stars verses five are that the prices are significantly higher than other diners and they ALWAYS forget something when they deliver.  Again, the food is great.",
8,,8/9/2016,0,,"Beverly, MA",John N.,3,4.0,13,"These restaurants are slowly disappearing unfortunately. The Greek diner with good solid food and no atmosphere. Had three meals here recently and all had good cooking, good quality food, and waiters with lots of stories. I'll miss it when it gets replaced by another Chipotle.",
9,,2/12/2017,18,,"Astoria, New York, NY",Ryan B.,2,5.0,24,Great post hang over diner. Fast service. Love the key lime pie. The decor is diner style. A good place for a conversation. I had the wings and burger and it was delicious.,
10,,6/20/2014,64,,"Manhattan, NY",Samuel M.,54,2.0,416,"Diners have much more individuality than fast food chains; the structures, menus, and even owners and staff, while having a certain degree of similarity to each other, vary much more widely than the more rigidly standardized chain and franchise restaurants.Silver Star is a diner located in uptown Manhattan. What drew most my attention was the good vibe of the crew, the hostess, the waiters, really good attitude. For a simple lunch works. I had a greek salad, the anchovies were too strong, but the lettuce was crispy, fresh and clean. Sometimes nothing works better than the cheap sandwiches, fries, omelets and pancakes with honey and butter.",
11,,7/6/2012,200,,"Brooklyn, NY",Maeve C.,2,3.0,331,"Silver Star is an old timey diner, from the row of low stools lining a counter as you walk in, to the Melba toast they include in your bread baskets.  (Does anyone eat Melba toast?  I tend to think it just sits in the bottom of bread baskets patiently, hoping someone just gets SO HUNGRY that they need to fill their mouth with dry crumbs.)  It has a wide selection and some decent specials, and like any good NY diner it has Greek undertones.  I went with the chicken souvlaki wrap, which is essentially the ingredients from a Greek salad wrapped in a tortilla.  It was surprisingly good, and I enjoyed dipping every bite into the tzatziki on the side, mmm.  Although my mom liked her chicken caesar wrap and my dad enjoyed his fried chicken, my sisters who both got the Greek salad with chicken on top were borderline disgusted with their meal.  Old lettuce and weird chicken seemed to be the problem, both of which are kind of glaring.  I'm still giving Silver Star 3 stars because the offending food is hearsay to me, and like any good law student I'll wait until I experience it myself to deduct a star or two.",
