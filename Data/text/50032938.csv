0,Rachel N.,"Alpine, UT",0,1,1,5.0,11/11/2018,Wow we were very impressed and would definitely recommend! We called about an hour before and they got us a table for 12 which isn't easy to find in NYC on a Saturday night. The service was fantastic and got our food pretty quick. I got the French onion soup which was to die for on a cold day and the chicken apple 7 grain sandwich which was so good!,,,
1,Lauren N.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",46,124,357,4.0,9/20/2018,"Decided to check this place out for Sunday brunch and had a great experience. They have 90 minute bottomless brunch (drinks only) for $19 which is very reasonable.We opted to split a Caesar salad to start, and for our mains order the salmon club and brunch burger. The salmon club was so good, I loved everything about it! Crispy bacon, good bread, aioli- just a few of my favorite things. They accidentally sent us the wrong burger and were quick to bring out the correct order, which was delicious. Service was friendly and the kitchen prepared our food lightning fast, but we never felt rushed. I would definitely come back here for brunch again or to try dinner.",2,1,2
2,Kristi B.,"Winter Garden, FL",37,93,215,3.0,9/11/2018,"Late night bar that serves decent food. The bar portion is right when you walk in and the dining portion is at the back. It was a Friday night around 10:30pm when we went and there was loud music playing to celebrate the weekend. Even in the back where the dining was, the music was still loud. We basically ate in silence. It just wasn't our scene but we were really hungry. The service was a little slow but there only appeared to be one server for the seven-ten tables in the back. I got the chorizo-beef burger with fries and my husband got the chicken wings - medium sauce. The Burger was perfectly cooked to a nice medium interior and the chorizo gave spice to the burger. My only suggestion would be that the bun should be a heartier bun. By the time I was done with 1/2 of a burger the bottom of the bun was completely disintegrated. The flavor on the wings was good but the wings themselves were overdone.",1,,1

4,Lindsay C.,"Forest, VA",57,75,43,5.0,11/5/2018,"Delicious!! We had a great meal our last night in the city. We wanted something close to our hotel and one place we tried was closed for a private party. Someone at the door suggested this place. Had a good selection on their menu and specials. I had the buffalo calamari salad and it was delicious! When you walk in, you are in the bar area. Continue on to the back and there is a seating area. It was a bit noisy but not bad. The bar area was hopping the whole time we were there. We had our kiddos with us and I will say it's not really kid friendly. No kids menu. They enjoyed it though! Nice decor. If we hadn't had the kiddos with us, I would have loved to have stayed at the bar for a bit! Fun place!",,,
5,Narciso A.,"Northridge, CA",686,500,983,4.0,7/3/2018,"Summary: 4 stars, nice neighborhood bar...even though this wasn't a neighborhood. Forgo your hotel bar for this place to mingle with the locals and have a drink or a pint.Ambiance / Cleanliness: 4Place was super clean. Love the dark ambiance and the cool, basement-looking theme they have going. We came here several times since our hotel bar was non existent. Came when it was packed during a World Cup game and came when it was empty...both were very pleasant experiences with pleasant people to boot.Quality / Flavor: 4Going to review the drink selection since I didn't order any food. Do you want Lagavulin? Laphroig? Buffalo Trace? Diplomatico? Some other obscure quality liquor? Yep they got it! Value: 3.5Happy hour prices are great! Regular hour prices not bad at $8 a shot of the good stuff.Service: 4.5Good bartenders and servers who were both attentive and great people to talk to.Average score: 4 stars",2,1,2
6,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",316,454,6448,3.0,4/18/2018,"Love the location, the menu, and the service this visit was good. What kills me is the kitchen! My friend enjoyed his burger medium well) topped with avocado and a fried egg. The French Fries were on point as usual. I ordered the Tequila and Lime Mussels... Okay but needs tweaking. The broth lacked spices and lime but the pieces were plentiful and pretty medium bodied. I added some Chipotle Chola to give it more flavor but it barely helped.What keeps me returning is the pricing (lunch menu is reasonable) and the possibility that I will one of these days, find their signature dish. I also like the atmosphere and knowing it's two floors, you're bound to get a table with less wait time.To Management: kitchen needs a little more testing, needs more flavors. Menu is promising as are the options, just need to turn up the flavors. Sigh. I really hope for better for you, everything else works.",3,2,3
7,Alison D.,"Dallas, TX",95,165,74,3.0,10/15/2018,"Not bad, not great. But a solid choice in the neighborhood. They were nice and accommodating of my dietary restrictions.",,,
8,Joe T.,"San Diego, CA",3,19,5,5.0,10/7/2018,"All day $1 oysters and great happy hour drinks.  This was a great find after a long day of walking around Manhattan and the two dozen oysters sure hit the spot!  We came at 5pm and found seating easily. But shortly after 6pm, it got packed really quick.",,,
9,Thayne L.,"San Diego, CA",371,309,42,5.0,2/5/2018,"The fact this place is next door to our hotel was the win. The bartender (6'5 European) was bad ass. We had a great time shooting the stuff and I without a doubt left blacked out.  The location is on East 47th and has a warm feeling when you walk in. Few tables and a 15 seat bar. The music is always rocking and the drinks are strong, very strong. We went and she had Tito's Martinis and I went for Stella and Deleon Shots. Winning combos if you ask me, lol. What you'll get here is good drinks, solid food and an atmosphere where you can have fun and sing and dance if desired. I'll be back next trip to say what's up and cause more trouble. Cheers, mate.",2,,1
10,Jenna T.,"Huntington, WV",108,67,2,4.0,11/4/2018,"This is a very unique place. I loved the decor throughout the restaurant. I had a burger and fries. The fries were excellent, I felt like the burger was good but missing something. Not a bad place.",,,
11,Mabelle L.,"Queens, NY",280,284,1513,3.0,12/24/2017,"Came here for a lunch around 1:15pm. Wasn't super packed, plus they had a second floor. Love how spacious it was. Ordered soup of the day - cream of potato and leek. It was okay and helped warm me up on a cold day.Blackened fish tacos. I think they would have been good except I'm sensitive to spicy and I'm guessing the seasoning on the fish might have been Cajun spice or something similar so my mouth was on fire. Only ended up eating 1 out of the 2 tacos.Service was phenomenal. She kept coming back and my water was never empty.",1,1,1
12,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,12/5/2017,"It's hard to differentiate the Grand Central area pubs one from the other. It may be why I just can't push it to a 4 star even though everything I experienced here was really a 3.5 - 3.75. This one does stand out with having a more laid back and chill vibe atmosphere. They also do have a pretty fairly decent happy hour that apparently lasts all day and night. Or they just have drinks marked at the prices they really should always be priced at or lower ($5 pbr, rolling rock, tecate, budlight draft). 3-7pm happy hour on weekdays entails: $7 wells and select wines. Things they do excel at here: Their burgers. If you want a decent dinner for $15 or less, this is a pretty solid option for pub food. Black angus burgers, salmon, grilled chicken, veggie edamame, sirloin steak, etc etc. come fully loaded on puffy gloriously huge buns. Their fish tacos were also really nicely stuffed and fully loaded. Last I tried their flatbread with gooey cheese, chicken and funions. Which I had to explain to my friend that funions are delicious and not technically onions and you are depriving yourself as a citizen of the United States of America if you have never noshed on the little crunchy delights.They also do a boozey brunch here on weekends for $20 bottomless (unsure if this includes food or not) but most brunches in Manhattan are going up in price anyway these days. Definitely a spot worth checking out if you work in the area or live close by and want to catch a game but I also wouldn't go out of my way to seek the spot out.",6,3,5
13,Johnson J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,3,3.0,10/26/2018,"This place has a nice vibe and a cozy feel to it. But be extremely careful regarding what your order from the menu. The cold and hard rolls are unavoidable and helpful if you're starving. Stick to staples such as burgers, wraps or salads. I made the amateur mistake of ordering shrimp fra diavolo with pasta. The shrimp was what one would expect at a low key pub, the pasta came overcooked and the sauce was downright horrible with enough sodium to not just choke but probably immediately kill a decent-sized horse. Maybe I'm being unfair but be advised to order carefully when visiting this establishment.",,,
14,Phoebe Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",15,18,59,5.0,10/2/2018,"Very cute place next to the Bernic Hotel, the oyster was on promotion, $1 per piece, no where else in the world can compare.

15,Michael H.,"Baltimore, MD",20,110,125,3.0,6/3/2018,"Nice backroom for dinner, otherwise fairly typical sports bar.  Big TVs throughout, and a large party space with a balcony upstairs.  Food was ok.  Had the fish and chips; the fish looked like fancy fish sticks.  Wife had the shrimp linguine, which came in a delicious garlic and white wine sauce.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Nothing amazing here, but nothing terrible either.  Solidly average.  Sole complaint was the AC in the backroom.  Came on like a tornado blast, strong enough to blow away the paper napkin.  At least that was only for brief intervals.  Definitely a great spot to catch a game.",,,
16,L S.,"New York, NY",72,19,10,1.0,1/7/2018,"Don't not believe the ratings, I believe this place gets their employees, friends and family to make fake positive reviews.  ***I ordered takeout via the yelp app. Upon arriving, the cashier attempted to make me pay for the food again. I explained the charge went through on my credit card via the app. But to make things worst, I get back to my hotel room. Open the bag, only to find the Cobb salad I order had a rotten avocado on top. This is suppose to be a top seller, I can't believe the cook would put such a disgusting item on someone's plate. God knows what else is wrong with the salad, so I'm throwing it away.  If I could provide a negative star, I would!",4,,
17,Tj S.,"Sparta Township, NJ",628,14,9,5.0,8/13/2018,"Stopped in for a quick drink with my friend after a kind day of work. Their butterfly Margherita is the reason for this review. Our bartender Joseph sold us immediately on the acidic color twist from adding lemon juice to the blue butterfly cocktail, turning it purple. One of the best margs I've had in the city, at a completely unexpected location. Strong, and not too sweet or sour... well balanced. Glad we stopped in! Great drinks, great service, will definitely be back!",,,
18,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,5.0,6/17/2017,"This is my favorite bar to go to M-F in NYC! From the outside it looks like your average sports bar. Actually from the inside it looks very average as well. What makes me come back time and time again is Keith the manager and his staff. They are super friendly and extremely accommodating. There has been times where my group came and there were multiple parties with reserved tables, Keith would still accommodate and ensure we have a good time.I have been here multiple times for lunch as well and the food is fantastic. I would highly recommend the wings and fries. The sandwiches are great choices as well. Overall great experience, I will definitely continue to come here 2-3 times a week.",1,,
19,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",179,137,576,3.0,12/1/2017,Great spot for bar food and happy hours. I ordered salmon burger and chicken fingers they are all delicious! First floor has plenty of seats for lunch/dinner party and second floor has bar tables and good for happy hours. One downside is that there is a construction site next to the bar and it feels very dusty from the outside. Im sure it wont get into the bar but still.,1,1,1
20,Alyssa B.,"Manchester, NH",20,3,0,5.0,10/28/2018,Nice neighborhood bar. Came here because our hotel was around the corner. Ordered the wings and mozzerella sticks. Mozzarella sticks were good but the wings were some of the best we've ever had. Would look definitely come here again next time we are in town.,,,
21,Julie C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",196,194,40,4.0,5/18/2018,"We stopped here for a quick bite after getting to NYC. The service was fantastic. We got there about 10 min before they actually opened and they went ahead and seated us. We were really appreciative. I ordered the quinoa and avocado salad and it was good. Not great but good. It turns out that Foxy's is known for their burger, so I probably should have gotten that as opposed to a salad.",,,
22,Keila B.,"Nyack, NY",42,187,83,3.0,5/12/2018,"This place was a good choice for dinner and drinks after work. Nothing spectacular but also well above mediocre. I was interested in their drinks so I had the Foxy John which was Makers, hickory and oak smoked syrup, and bitters. It was awful. So bad that I sent it back. It was like drinking super sweet sugar water with lots a smoke and a little bourbon. I ordered the Fox Tail which was Bulleit, ginger syrup, pear purée, and lemon juice. This was much better. I also had a Moscow Mule and that was very good. For my meal I had the Foxy Johns burger and it was tasty. Came on a pretzel bun which I liked. It was served with French fries and those were adequate. My husband had the salmon club and he said it was excellent. This review is more like 3.5 stars. Probably won't be back because there are just so many more options.",,,
23,Brian C.,"Austin, TX",81,140,717,4.0,5/3/2017,"With so many bars to choose from in Midtown it can get hard to know where to go, but this place is beyond solid! Plenty of TVs on the inside if you're looking to catch multiple games, or a bunch of things are on. Staff is super chill too, our barkeep was really laid back and got us whatever we needed. There's an upstairs too, but didn't check it out, a nice balcony seating too, looked quaint.Food was great, had the clamari and wings. Calamari was more than generous and tasted great. They weren't huge pices per se, but the batter wasn't heavy either, so it was a good balance. But the real kicker was that it came a special curry aioli sauce that added in some good zest and changed things up from normal bar calimari! If you aren't a curry fan, be wary as it is a strong taste to it, but I thought it was great. Wings were so-so, but still solid, and standard per the bar scene. Got the lemonade cocktail with Grey Goose, it was refreshing and a little more on the sweet side than I'd like, but it was good none the less. The salmon club did not disappoint either! The whole grain bread was a nice touch, salmon was generous and juicy, and the aioli sauce complimented the tomato and greens very well. Bacon was a nice bonus, but I could have gone with just a pure salmon club too.If you're out on the east side in Midtown and are looking for a nice little spot to catch a game, or grab some drinks this place delivers. Not too crowded, away from the tourists, and a good all around vibe to the place.",,,
24,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",458,655,80,4.0,9/9/2017,"Not sure how you can get better than $1 oysters and $5 Narragansett's all day. This spot is conveniently located a few blocks away from Grand Central which makes meet ups here especially convenient if like me, you have friends that live all over town. There is a dining area in the back and a bar and high top in the front. There are some TVs behind the bar that show whatever game is on. The decor is decidedly sports bar chic, which is to say, just the right amount of cliche. It's a very clean bar. Nothing is sticky - disclaimer: my standards for sports bar cleanliness have dropped after living here for 7 years.The most surprising aspect of this bar, however, must be that it never really gets that packed. Unlike other sports bars around the area, I have never felt like this place was ass to elbows crowded, which for me, is a major plus. The food here is surprisingly good. The oysters are a ridiculous deal for $1. Although I will say that I wish they would cut the muscle so it was easier to eat. The wings are huge and really nicely fried and sauced. They are probably my favorite item to order here. The sliders are also very good with the burger patties being perfectly cooked rather than scorched into a hockey puck like most places.Prices of most items are par for Manhattan, although there are a few good deals to be had here if you are discriminating.Overall, this is definitely my favorite bar in the Grand Central area. Good place to watch the game, down a few brewskis, and most importantly for me, be able to have a conversation with your friends without having to scream in their ear. I am so old.",2,,
25,Yessica G.,"Houston, TX",9,9,0,5.0,7/22/2018,"This place was great! We came here after we arrived in NYC and our hotel was 2 doors down. Our hotel wasn't ready for us so we came here to pass time, and they didn't mind our luggage at all. Food -and drinks were tasty and waitress was friendly and attentive.",1,,
26,Ross P.,"Katy, TX",17,69,7,4.0,4/28/2018,Wow what a great place. Service is superb and couldn't ask for anything they couldn't do. They even asked the guy next to me if it was too cold and if it was they would raise the temp. He was a regular I later found out. They have the most amazing oysters and for only $1 each all day every day. Had to try them. The presentation is awesome and the oysters are large and very fresh.  It gets crowded but flows with the night. Highly recommend you try it out.,,,
27,Nasir D.,"Jamaica, NY",0,19,61,4.0,2/19/2018,They got $1/oyster. Good oysters for the price. The rest of the menu is good too. Good place for sit down lunch with coworkers.  Friendly waiter.,3,,1
28,Gatangalie S.,"Queens, New York, NY",429,286,2949,5.0,2/6/2017,"Awesome place for some delicious appetizers, pasta and happy hour special in midtown manhattan.I've came here with colleagues twice and enjoyed every moment of it. They have a good selection of wells drinks. I usually order their red wine or blue moon. Good prices.Totally addicted to their buffalo quesadilla, truffle fries, spicy mozzarella stick and crunchy buffalo wings.I also had their shrimp pasta, highly recommend to share with another individual if not super hungry.We went crazy one night and ordered a few different desserts to share with the group such  as vanilla ice cream, apple pie, chocolate lava cake and whip cream.Yummy! Trust me you would not be disappointed with the food or drinks. Most importantly the price is decent. Excellent services! Check the walls out in the facilities!",6,4,7
29,Samantha A.,"Columbia, SC",75,145,61,5.0,4/12/2018,"Saw this place walking back from Madison Avenue, decided to give it a try! We sat at the upstairs bar, there were four of us. The dollar oysters drew all of us in! I know some people are probably sketched out by the thought of dollar oysters, but they were so good. They were Blue Points and not too briny, which I prefer. I also ordered a Caesar salad that was pretty good. Another person in my entourage had a cheeseburger that looked amazing. The bar service was great, and the food came out quickly. They had tvs, but still had that ""you're in a cool bar in NYC"" feel. I enjoyed my experience there and would return.",,,
30,Erik F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,13,0,1.0,9/2/2018,"Says it's open until midnight, but they told us it was last call at 10:45. And they closed the kitchen at 10:00 Why? Because the bartender felt like closing early. (And there were plenty of people in the place.)After walking several blocks to be here, that is a disappointment and does not represent an establishment that is customer focused.",,,
31,Gauri P.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,37,5,2.0,2/11/2018,"Horrible food. I ordered the chicken penne pasta, and I can honestly say I can make a MUCH tastier version of that dish at home. And I'm no professional chef. The chicken was extremely gamy and didn't blend in well with the rest of the flavors. It was like they just boiled some chicken and threw it in at the last minute!The only thing good about this place is the location since it's in the heart of Manhattan. It was close to my hotel and one of my coworkers recommended this place (I have no idea why, but I now know this person doesn't have good taste in food in general). The service wasn't rude or unprofessional and that's the only reason I rated them higher than one star. But I would expect much better food quality considering they have tough competition from other excellent restaurants nearby. My money here was not well spent.",1,,1
32,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,4.0,8/6/2017,"One of many bar/pubs in the area, predominantly catering to the after work crowd. We live locally, so don't really fit into that crowd, but one thing that I did notice and can appreciate is that they had a screen with the latest metro north trains from grand central. We just came on a Friday evening for something low key and were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the quality of the food. There is the bar area at the front, which is as you would expect, plus a nice seating area at the back with English book end covered walls and adequately spaced out tables. It's not luxury or anything but as I said, low key. The service was quick and friendly, with no wait for a table. I had some buffalo wings to start and we both had a burger and fries as a main. It was all fine - again, as you would expect. The burgers come on pretzel buns - so that may sway your opinion depending on how you feel about that. This place is a good choice if you're in the immediate area. As before, there are plenty of alternatives and while this may be above average, it's priced about 15% above the rest as well",1,1,
33,Morgan B.,"Lawrence, KS",2,89,75,4.0,3/15/2018,"Good food! It's not a restaurant I would seek out, but if I were in the neighborhood and I wanted a quick burger, I would stop. I had the Foxy Burger. It had fried onion strings on top of a burger pattie with chipotle mayo and pepper jack cheese. I subbed blu cheese instead. It was pretty good! $16 price tag. The fries are also good.",,,
34,Brad B.,"Austin, TX",51,3,0,4.0,8/28/2018,"Overall a very hip and happening bar, wood paneling and very busy.  Food was good and drinks strong.

35,September M.,"Lakefront, Syracuse, NY",60,8,6,5.0,1/28/2018,Was leaving from my stay at The Bernic and decided to find a brunch spot before departing NYC. It only made sense to stop here! Didn't participate in the bottomless brunch ( drinks) but the food was very good. Atmosphere was dark and classic setting. The waitress and host were accommodating and gave great suggestions. I ordered the Steak & Eggs.. Absolutely GOOD!  The GLUTEN FREE Pancakes are out of this world!! I would so come back here for happy hours and drinks!,1,,
36,Faith B.,"Paducah, KY",0,2,0,4.0,8/18/2018,"Had a great dinner at Foxy John's.  Loved the cozy atmosphere and wonderful service.  I had shrimp fettuccini which was quite good, the white sauce was light and not overwhelming.  I didn't care for the ceasar salad as much because it wasn't a creamy ceasar.  My husband hamburger on a pretzel bun with pepper jack cheese. He enjoyed both that and the French fries. Overall a very good dinner",,,

The happy hour prices were also really good and the oysters were delicious.,,,

She was nice and didn't seem bothered that I came and left so once I was done with my call I came back to have lunch. But after I ordered I checked the time and realized I had to go back to the office so I told her once again I had to leave. Yes I was that annoying patron that required too much; but she packed my food to go and I was on my way. I ordered the blackened chicken wrap (~$14) and it was delicious. Ample of chicken and flavor.

Second time walked by and went to chat with a regular who was leaving. Again, didn't even glance my way. Wtf dude? So do people stand at the bar waiting with a menu in hand for fun? Baffling considering our group just got in and were seated right in front. Then we all gathered at the bar and said ""excuse me"" and he stopped talking to the guy and finally came over. We were there for over an hour with at least 4 rounds and the dude didn't smile once. Basically was grunting ""ok"" and ""yup"" whenever we asked for stuff. My friend gave him a small cash tip when we were leaving and still stone face. No, awkward spot, not coming here to chill after work. We weren't rude/bar hopping/drunk, nothing like that. Got off work and just looking drinks/food. It was like a Tuesday night at 8PM too.. I don't get it, I work in the customer service industry and being friendly doesn't cost anything.

Walked over to let waitress know (kitchen staff had brought out meal). She was apologetic but mentioned it happens frequently. Redone burger cooked perfectly and quite tasty. They also subbed a salad for my fries at no extra charge.

We knew the menu was pub fare but that was what we wanted.  I started with an app Caesar salad and it was quite good -fresh, crisp and Cardini's style Caesar dressing. We both had burgers. Me a simple Swiss cheese burger and my wife the Foxy John's burger. Both were cooked as we ordered them (medium) which is unusual these days. The beef was very tasty, the pretzel rolls yummy. One of us had fries and the other onion rings so we could share. Both were good. Very good IPA on draft. Service was very good; we ate through a shift change and the change from one waitress to the next was seamless. Lots of great places to eat in NYC but we really enjoyed Foxy John's.",4,,

I opted for the Foxy John Burger which came with chipotle aioli, frizzled onions and pepper jack cheese on a pretzel bun. It was cooked to my request and came with a nice basket of fries. There were plenty of condiments on the table, from A1, HP and malt vinegar. The wife ordered the Black Angus burger which she reported as also being very good. The beer list, between the tap, bottle and cans, was extensive and I went for a Belgian Whit Beer from a local brewery.Service was very good and the prices were reasonable considering its proximity to Grand Central.I agree with other reviewers that it is not a 'gastro pub' and the music is way too loud.",2,1,2

Service seemed pretty ok for a busy post happy hour transitioning into dinner time. But here's the deal- the three of us ordered 2 carafes of white sangria,$16ea, to share and while it was really good and fragrant, it was disappointing to see that it was majority ice and small. Talking probably 3/4 ice. Our 3 wine glasses also came filled with ice and these tiny carafes barely filled each glass for 3 of us. We even ordered a second carafe to see if it would be less ice and it actually came with more ice lol. You're probably better off ordering sangria by the glass instead of by the drop in carafes.

The TV was big but they volume was not on, there was music playing instead. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Cute holiday decorations too! I got the teriyaki chicken salad which was good but had a bit too much dressing on it for me.",,,

110,Sophia G.,"San Diego, CA",242,433,138,4.0,12/27/2016,"Yelp did not lead me wrong- this spot is awesome!  Came here for a burger and was pleasantly surprised to find a small, intimate bar/restaurant with great service and food.  There seemed to be a lot of regulars seated at the bar, which is always a good sign. Burger (with lots of add-on selections, including different cheeses, avocados, grilled onions, etc.), fries, and drinks were all excellent and the service is great, to match.  It's a bit shocking that this place is located in midtown- it definitely does not have the pretentious feel that most bars and restaurants in the area have, and the prices are reasonable for the quality.  The small dining area may limit their capacity and increase the wait times during peak hours, but overall we found it to be intimate and it definitely helps with the waitstaff/diner ratio.  I would definitely recommend this place and put it on my list for a repeat-visit.  However, on my next visit I will avoid to mulled wine/gluhwein- WAY too much cinnamon/cloves and not enough citrus for my taste!  I should have stuck to the safer beer options!",1,,1
111,Sonya K.,"Alpharetta, GA",168,18,5,5.0,3/29/2017,Excellent restaurant. Decided to give it a shot because of her $1 oysters. They turned out to be excellent blue point oysters! I had the lamb chops which were also tasty and the mango drink. We went earlier in the day so it wasn't very crowded. I could tell the after work crowd starts coming in around 5pm and the bar gets pretty full. Service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive.,,,

This place isn't particularly busy at any point of the day, so it's easy to jump in for a bite or a drink. Check the specials on the board before entering. I just wish they had a specials drink menu, which can only be seen from the bar. The foxy john burger was good, served on a pretzel bun, with shoe string onions, and some type of aoili. Personally, I would've preferred caramelized onions, the shoestring onions were a bit overpowering. They have huge oysters with all the fixings! Decent selection of bottled beers. Gonna come back and try some of their signature cocktails.",1,1,1

You got the sense most customers could probably afford to go most places after work, so why not Foxy John's! I also got the sense a few customers had been their previously.We all thought the music was just right, and we all could hear one another very well. We also think the newest member of our team was pleased in our choice of venue.Foxy John's also has flat screens, and we were able to watch some of the NCAA Tournament Basketball Tourney while we drank, ate and conversed.Foxy John's hit the spot, and we absolutely love the name too!Thank you Foxy John's!",,,

Apparently this place is less than a year old. It hasn't yet reached dive status and let's pray it stays that way.  The bar is FULL and meets my rum needs. The happy hour special was all night while I was there, so double fisting was necessary.  I ordered the salmon burger and it was devine.  It came with fries that were cooked to perfection.  Oh,  I forgot to mention the calamari,  which were ordered and arrived in 79 seconds. Yes,  I don't think the server finished writing the word calamari and they were on the table.  That was good,  but scary...you follow? I'll certainly be back,  Danielle the server was amazing.",1,1,

129,Nicole B.,"Canyon Lake, CA",355,113,75,4.0,10/16/2015,"Found this place on Yelp during a business trip to NYC. Stopped in for dinner on a solo mission around 6:30pm on a Friday night. I dined on the chicken tacos from the app menu, perfect for a small eater! Tacos were great, slightly spicy. Atmosphere was SUPER LOUD!! I sat in the far back room against a wall and still couldn't believe how loud it was, this would be a horrible place for a date night as it would be impossible to hear one another talk. However, I was (1) of (3) tables of solo people so if your sitting alone and not talking to anyone it's great!

131,Annette G.,"Newton Upper Falls, MA",3,17,6,2.0,1/19/2016,"I don't understand how this place has such great reviews. I usually do more thorough research on the restaurants near me, however we were in a time crunch and just went along with the 4.5 rating. The food here was mediocre at best. And the drink I had (pom martini), tasted like cheap, old vodka. Same with the beer that was on tap. We ordered the Mexican cheese sticks as an app, which weren't spicy at all and quite bland. As for meals, my boy friend ordered some grilled chicken, broccoli, and mashed potatoes. I opted for the kale and avocado salad. His meal was just okay, overcooked and salty/soggy broccoli, the chicken was at least moist w/ some spice, and the mashed was more decent. But very sub-par compared to all these rave reviews... Maybe we made the mistake of just not going with a plain burger. It took me a while to figure out how I felt about my salad...because I'm pretty sure my waitress forgot to put the order in or the kitchen forgot to make it. Halfway into my bf's meal and seeing a table that came after us get their course, I had to remind her that I haven't gotten my salad yet. She apologized, and gave me a complimentary drink. The salad wasn't that great either, and something about the dressing tasted off. TL;DR: Overall everything tasted cheaply made and poorly cooked. Would not go back here if given the chance.",,,
132,Joe C.,"Peabody, MA",51,57,37,4.0,10/29/2016,Loved our burgers and fries. Juicy and had great flavor. I would highly recommend them. Their fried calamari appetizer was average. Just the rings.

159,Kevin L.,"Miami, FL",413,79,196,4.0,2/24/2016,"I really liked this place and surprisingly you probably wouldn't notice much from the outside just passing by. I had just finished a long day at the office with coworkers and we were all at a loss for where to go eat after we grabbed a few cocktails at another nearby pub. We decided we wanted something American and easy to grab so we looked on Yelp and this place had pretty good reviews so we said why not! We walked into what is a darker environment lit by neon lights at the bar but then directed to the back room because of the size of our party which was fairly sized. The back is well lit and a little less crowded-at least when we went and our waitress was quick and attentive which surprised me for a bar like atmosphere, more kudos to her. We ordered quite a bit to start off with to share as a group-oysters, calamari and some spice mozzarella type sticks. They were all good but no take me to heaven moment but also perfect for the group setting and the oysters were really good considering the bar/restaurant concept so I was surprisingly delighted. Most of us orders the foxy burger and I added bacon as well as pickles. To my realization though, they only had spear pickles and if you're like me it just doesn't workout when I want it on my burger so that was a miss for me but the burger was good and juicy and not in an overly greasy way. My coworkers all loved it too and one even mentioned it was one of the best she had tried. I don't know if I can say the same but I'd certainly recommend it. My turn off was the pretzel bun-not because I don't like these buns but rather because it was a bit salty for my taste. Also I ordered mine medium and it was over cooked so I didn't have as much luck with mine but it was still good. I would certainly come back to this place and recommend it-it's a good environment where you can actually hear the people your with and I always appreciate that.",1,,1

174,Portia R.,"Manhattan, NY",33,54,0,3.0,8/23/2015,"Solid choice for Midtown when in a bit of a hurry. I had the onion soup and it was good but not great. I am a big French onion soup fan. I make my own so I love when I get a bowl that's 100% on point. My lunch partner had the hamburger and pronounced it good, I a little on the overdone side. Service was also fine and the décor is nice. The prices are a little on the high side for what you get.",,,
175,Michael S.,"Arcadia, CA",188,52,1,4.0,1/23/2015,"This place is pretty great.  I came here on two occasions, one for the happy hour and the other for lunch.Environment:This place is kind of hard to spot because of the construction next door.  However, once you come inside, it looks amazing.  They just renovated the whole place, and it looks very clean and roomy.Service:The bartenders/servers were very attentive.  It might be because this is a new establishment.  They would make sure your water would be refilled promptly, and all the other things that show they care about making your experience as enjoyable as possible.Food/Alcohol:The portion sizes for the entrees were of decent size and the food wasn't too bad (I don't have high expectations for a bar).  I had the Foxy Angus Burger, and the burger was juicy.  The fries came with a side of ketchup and chipotle aioli sauce.  They have a good selection of beers on tap.  They don't serve the usual types of beer, they have some unique imports compared to the irish establishment called ""Blackwells"".Recommendation:This is a great place for happy hour, especially after work.  The area has a few similar establishments, but I have liked this one the best.  The music isn't too loud, you can actually have a conversation, and you can bring large crowds to this place without feeling like someone is entering your personal bubble.",,,
176,Matthew C.,"Culpeper, VA",13,3,2,5.0,3/5/2015,"Loved this place!  Great service, great drinks.  We will certainly be back!!!!One of the best bar tenders we've met. Terrific atmosphere. Open late. Can't recommend enough.",,,
177,Jess P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/23/2017,"The amazing and smiley hostess walked us to the back where is quiet and romantic as we hoped for. It wasn't until a parade of mice crawled out of the ""harry potter themed books"", the waitress with the big arse apologized said it 'rarely happens"" other than that the food was fast and delicious my taste buds were dancing along with the hip music!! Btw its close to where we were staying, the Bernic hotel!",,,
178,michael d.,"San Francisco, CA",14,141,0,5.0,12/19/2015,"Fun little bar - great service, fantastic burger. The salmon w chutney was v good as well, ceasar was fine, not outstanding. For what it was and price, a good find. 4.5 stars!",,,
179,Alex G.,"Chicago, IL",22,158,37,4.0,12/7/2015,"Dollar oysters, and they were full meaty oysters, otherwise good bar food. When I went it wasn't too busy but not dead, the kind of place that the bartender isn't running back and forth trying to take care of everyone and he has a minute to check in with you make sure everything is to your liking and chat about the current sports game being played.  Decent drink specials and selection as well.",,,
180,Jamil P.,"Boston, MA",3,66,41,5.0,11/9/2015,The place is a great restaurant where the bartenders are nice and professional. My new wife and I is in the city enjoying our honeymoon and because of this place it added to our wonderful experience.  The bartender JJ is awesome!,,,
181,Thomas P.,"Essex, NJ",1,36,2,3.0,12/30/2015,I ordered my burger Medium Rare.   It arrived nearly raw.  I ate most of it and when done eating asked the waiter to let the cook know so he could do better for the next guest.  He never let him know.  My wife's dinner was quite good as was my daughter's.I am starting to believe no one really knows how to cook a hamburger.,,,

185,Jen T.,"Edwardsville, IL",2,10,1,5.0,7/17/2015,"Fantastic! Never had an empty glass. The $1 oysters were outstanding. I had the Chicken Penne but substituted shrimp for the chicken - perfect! Husband had fish and chips - loved  it. Son had Black Fettuccine, said it was great, and daughter had lemon grilled chicken - not dry and tasty!  A great stop! A step above pub food - in my opinion!",,,1

189,John S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,28,0,4.0,10/25/2015,Very interesting place. It's dark inside but beer selection is good. Food menu is really nice. Heard there are special discounts every 6 months. I somehow had issue with the host once. But I was drunk and he was busy. Maybe it was just the one time thing.,,,
190,Phillip C.,"Winston-Salem, NC",0,19,1,4.0,12/11/2015,Went here late on a Friday night. Was not busy. Menu was reasonable. Staff friendly. Had a crab cake and queso cheese sticks followed by some clam chowder. Everything was made in house. Food was good. Only complaint was the loud music playing. We even asked to move to a quieter area and it was blaring.,,,
191,Jaebi I.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,49,13,4.0,6/8/2015,"I've been to Foxy John's twice. Great Food, Happy Hour around the clock, a bar that has charging ports. You can't go wrong here for a bite or drink if you're in the area an need either of these. The decor is fancy enough to be intimate as well.",,,1

193,Malia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,19,2,5.0,10/4/2015,"Very impressed with this place. Fries were perfect. Burger very tasty. Even dessert was yummy. Came in here hoping to watching the UF game. Got great seats, wasn't too crowded on a Saturday night, food was awesome and the waitress was very kind, even though I wanted 15 glasses of water. ~$40/dinner for two, no booze. Better than I ever expected to pay for good food in New York, and even better service! Would definitely make this a regular spot if I lived nearby.",,,

197,Randolph W.,"Roswell, GA",35,102,47,4.0,6/25/2015,Went there while on a business trip to NYC and it was near my hotel and they were showing the women's World Cup soccer game at the bar - so I went there for dinner.  Friendly bar dude - service was very good.  Food was good - had the French onion soup and the burger with fries.  Burger was a little under cooked so deducted a star for that.  I ate most of it but left the middle alone.   Good place to hang out - will be back.,,,
198,Alyssa D.,"Oceanside, CA",9,12,4,5.0,4/24/2015,"We're here visiting, found this gem on yelp. Great little place. Food was excellent.  Service and drinks were great. Awesome little place. Can't wait to come back.",,,2
199,Celine C.,"Manchester, CT",15,25,7,5.0,10/25/2015,"This place definitely deserves far more than 5 stars but considering that's as many as Yelp will allow, 5 stars will have to do. My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and I can't say enough about how good my food was (seriously, I must have told the waitress about 10 times). I ordered a penne dish that happened to be the special for the weekend and I highly recommend it. Also, the drinks aren't too shabby either. I got the Paloma and it was a perfect mix of grapefruit juice and Patron (yum!). Oh and the atmosphere here is fun and everyone is super nice, helpful, and attentive. Thank you for a wonderful night, Foxy John's Bar and Kitchen!",,,
