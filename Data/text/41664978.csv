0,K K.,"Dallas, TX",142,103,0.0,5.0,11/19/2018,Have been here several times. Always the most lovely service. I don't do meat but every once in a while I'll eat fish. This is the pace to do it. Wine list here is killer and the desserts.....do not skip the desserts!!!,,,
1,Latoya R.,"Las Vegas, NV",759,251,1131,4.0,11/19/2018,"In the words of Phil Collins, ""I've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh Lord.""Gramercy Tavern has been on my foodie bucket list for nearly 20 years. Finally, I can check this one off my list.My friend and I had reservations in the main dining room for lunch. They offered an al a carte menu, but my server convinced me to go for the Vegetarian Tasting Menu. It actually didn't take that much convincing because 5 courses for $79 is a real bargain. (By the way, I count dessert as a course). My friend ordered The Daily for $48 which included 3 courses.Here's how I graded each dish:Angel biscuits AJalapeño corn biscuit A+Tomato soup C-Corn tortellini ARoasted eggplant B-Sea bass A-Caramel cheesecake BThis is a non-tipping establishment, but that did not impact their service. Our server was unpretentious and very attentive. The restaurant itself had a very cozy feel to it. I was not expecting that at all! There's not even an official dress code, although business casual is preferred during lunch. I'm looking forward to my next visit, where I'm definitely getting their famous $38 burger.",2,,2
2,Kathleen C.,"Chicago, IL",105,1087,46,5.0,11/18/2018,"I'm not sure if I can really add to the reviews here and make a difference in anyone's viewpoint, but I'll try...We were visiting for a very short trip and I had reservations at a few spots for Friday night dinner and couldn't decide which one to use.  I hadn't eaten at Gramercy Tavern before, and was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype.  I should not have been worried - Gramercy was a stand out!We were late to our reservation, so considering they give away your table if you haven't confirmed by noon day of, I was concerned.  I called and let them know, and they could not have been nicer.  Thankfully our very lost uber managed to regain his sense of direction and we were only 20 minutes late (an eternity in restaurant reservation times....).We quickly had our coats taken care of and were off to our table.  We had a perfect spot in a little corner, near the liveliness of the tavern area, but in a slightly more quiet and cozy spot.Warmly greeted, we spent forever contemplating the menu options...it was between the 3-course and the seasonal tasting menu.  We were debating if it was better to get the 3-course and get totally different items (to try more...) vs the larger menu.  In the end, the descriptions of the items not the seasonal menu sounded too good to pass up.  I also elected for the wine pairings.We started with marinated scallops.  Oh wow.  Fresh and lively...I wanted to eat it with a giant spoon and ask for 4 more servings...On to himachi and more scallops and lobster and steak...and a number of perfect things in between...Everything was wonderful.  You know how sometimes on tasting menus, there are a few flops?  Well, there weren't any flops here.  I wanted to order another round to get more tastes.  Each course was more delicious than the next!  Even the palate cleanser was amazing!For dessert, our server nicely chose two different desserts so we could try both.  The hazelnut one and the fruit vanilla mousse thing (I clearly remembered the descriptions well..haha) were wonderful.  The wine pairings were unique and different and complemented the food well.  I enjoyed the descriptions of each of them and I thought that the amount of wine and variety was perfect.  While I wouldn't mind more tastes of each, this was perfect to accompany the food and not be sooo much wine.  The atmosphere was both cozy and remarkable in that it was so approachable and fun, but also clearly fine dining.  Sometimes you lose the cozy with the fine dining, but Gramercy is able to do both well.  Also, the flower arrangement on the bar was a standout - wow!Service was impeccable and everyone there seemed so happy to be there!  There's nothing that puts a damper on dinner like crabby waitstaff...and this is a spot where everyone was pleasant and seemed happy.  Either they are or they are really good actors, but in any case, they made it a warm and pleasurable spot to eat.Everything was perfect!  It's expensive, but quality and taste are outstanding.  I can't say enough good things - we had an amazing time!",,,
3,Christina G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",158,512,3283,4.0,10/29/2018,"Given that Gramercy Tavern was pretty packed and we did not have a reservation, we appreciated the option they provided to call us when our table was ready. We didn't wait for long at a nearby Starbucks before getting the call.The bread was okay here, but the food and cocktails were solid. The fried rice was rich and crispy, the duck was done two ways - as a sausage and a breast with mixed greens, the fish was tasty and served with fried shallots over a bed of dressed vegetables, and the donuts were as you would hope them to be - light and fluffy. The chocolate pudding dessert, however, was out of this world. They didn't blow my mind enough to come back, but this struck me as one of those classic NYC restaurants that simply does good food well.",2,1,2
4,Jun L.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",106,33,129,4.0,10/7/2018,"There are essentially two parts of the restaurant - the front is a more casual dining hall and the back a more formal experience. We sat in the back and had the set 6 course non-vegetarian menu. The menu is seafood heavy. Our first two courses were fantastic - the scallops were well balanced by the acidity of the tomatoes and cherries. The shrimp and grits were amazing (the shrimp was cooked to perfection). Though the halibut was cooked perfectly tender, I was underwhelmed by the visual aspect and seasoning, both of which were one-toned. The lobster and squid ink lumache is decent - slightly lack luster for this category of restaurant. The duck was well seasoned but very tough. The dessert (vanilla yogurt mousse) was creamy and decadent. I was initially put off by the service, as there were several quirky comments made by our waitstaff. The food overall was satisfactory. I would recommend trying this in spite of the service, although given some deficiencies I would probably recommend ordering the a la carte rather than this specific seasonal menu.",2,,1

I was expecting to be blown away by the food and flavor profiles and presentation but I wasn't. First coarse smoked trout. The prettiest of the dishes, delicate tasty. Second coarse pork loin and belly, bland and sad presentation. Third coarse cookies and milk, 2 thick cookies with more of a cake consistency.. these did not work for me. This place is so hyped up as one of the top fine dining restaurants in nyc. I wasn't impressed.",2,1,
7,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1481,4351,5.0,9/7/2018,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner in the dining room here. My boyfriend and I did one seasonal and one vegetable tasting menu, so we got to try everything. I would recommend the seasonal menu out of the two. Each dish in our tasting menus was better than the last. Standouts for me were the bread, duck breast & confit, marinated tomato salad, corn tortellini, and tomato sorbet (the palate cleanser). They gave me a little coconut cake during dessert, which was a nice touch, and Chocolates at the end of the meal were perfect. Service was decent, though it did take a little while for our waiter to initially notice us and bring menus. I also thought the granola bar that they give you as a takeaway treat wasn't that great. It just had an odd flavor to it. Otherwise, no complaints!I definitely want to return for the a la carte menu, as those dishes also looked fantastic - especially the cheese plates.",,1,
8,Stephen D.,"Highland, United Kingdom",1,100,46,5.0,11/12/2018,"The problem with this review is I can only award 5 stars. Quite simply the best meal I've ever had and that is by no means an easy task given meals I've had at the French Laundry, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Le Manoir, Marcus Waring Petrus and The Square in London.I opted for the tasting menu with wine flight, not one single course could have had anything added to make it any better. The balance of flavours, portion size, weight of each course was perfect.Each course got better and better and a standing joke with my server, Lara,  was that there was no way the next course could beat the last, it did, for eight courses! The standout being the Agnolotti pasta, I'd eat that every day given the chance. Innovative ideas such as strawberry jam with goats cheese work yet you would never imagine it. A pre dessert of apple sorbet with olive oil and fennel sounded so wrong yet tasted so right and left me wondering how the hell they came up with such a brilliant creation.The wine flight was on point, interesting, exceptional well matched, perfect temperature and delicious. The sommelier is off the scale, his description of wines and reasoning why make this man worth his weight in goldThe world is a big place, with tens of thousands of restaurants, if there is one that is better I'll challenge you to try Gramercy Tavern and then give me your opinion, simply sensational.Point to note that the food was equally matched by the service, the delectable Lara was so hospitable, so many restaurants fail when the food is so good but Lara was the perfect host, well done Lara, you were outstanding and made the meal experience even better.",2,,
9,Andreas P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,5,5.0,11/17/2018,You can either enjoy an a la cart menu in the tavern or a tasting menu in the main dining room. I recommend coming in for lunch and sitting in the tavern at the bar and getting the delicious burger! One of my favorite burgers in NYC! If you are celebrating or want to treat yourself then sit in the dining room and experience the full tasting menu! The service is amazing! Also hospitality is included!,,,
10,Anna C.,"San Francisco, CA",197,75,348,5.0,7/30/2018,"Everything here was so freaking delicious!!Standouts: - the starter cheesy focaccia: so addicting, would've been even better if it were slightly warmer but that's okay. They will keep serving you more if you finish your piece, so I had like 3-4 pieces. - tomato lasagna like thing: I really wish I had the name for this but I can't remember what it was called. Pasta filled with ricotta baked in a tomato red pepper sauce and then topped with different kinds of sweet and ripe tomatoes - green, red, grape... every bite was such a succulent and rich experience, bursting with perfectly seasoned flavor.- cherry cheesecake pie: sadly my picture doesn't capture just how gorgeous it was but it looked and tasted so lovely. The cherries were huge and plump, sweet (but not cloyingly so), and retained a substantial bite to it before releasing a slightly tart juice that paired so perfectly with the rich, creamy texture of the cheesecake part. Service: literally the best service I've ever had here--friendly and prompt, and rushed us through our meal when we asked them to bc we had to make a show in Times Square (eeek I know, we shouldn't have done that). They're a gratuity-included restaurant which I didn't know until after the bill came, which made their impeccable service all the more impressive; they weren't just being nice to get an extra tip, it's literally baked into their MO as a restaurant.I'd love to return to try their tasting menu!",2,1,
11,Alex K.,"Greenville, SC",216,5,7,5.0,11/12/2018,"Such an amazing and memorable meal. The service rivals any I have ever had, and the food was incredible. The fall cocktail was also delicious, as was the bread and butter (could literally melt away in that), and the complimentary extras (truffles, appetizer). I had the pappardelle, lamb loin, and red wine pears for dessert (with Stilton ice cream that was to die for). Overall incredible impressed with my experience - this will definitely be my go-to fancy / celebration restaurant from now on.",1,,

Updated review","Decided to give Gramercy Tavern another chance for lunch and I had a much more memorable time this go around. The space is very nice and airy and the service was great.For my appetizer I ordered the lobster again. It was a warm salad with a delicious sauce and a decent amount of lobster. For my main course, I chose their special burger and it was awesome. The onion rings that came with it were perfectly crispy.For dessert we shared 1 cookie plate, which came with 2 giant cookies that were soft and very tasty. I preferred the chocolate/nutella one. They brought us 4 small glass of milk for us to dip in as well which was very cute.Overall, I think Gramercy Tavern is back on my list of places where I will choose to go again in the more near future.  They're also a no tipping restaurant now, so that was a nice surprise.",6,1,2
14,Damien K.,"Westborough, MA",91,75,112,5.0,7/28/2018,"Came here with a former co-worker for dinner the other day.  Food and service were absolutely on point for what I would expect from here.  I had ordered the sea bass while my friend ordered the roasted chicken that was on special.  Food was excellent and we split the cookie desert to close off.  Wonderful presentation and quality taste of all the items we ordered. We were joking at dinner the umbrella i came walking in with would be forgotten since staff pointed out the hanging hook under the table.  Walking out after our meal we had forgotten exactly that.  However our host quickly flagged us down before we were even able to get past the windows.  So they not only provided a memorable meal, they also saved a walk back for a forgotten item at the table.",,1,
15,Rishi S.,"Duluth, GA",172,15,14,5.0,9/16/2018,"If I could give infinite stars, I would! I decided to pick Gramercy Tavern for a very special 1 yr anniversary dinner. I contemplated on picking through the many NYC restaurants! I thought the menu, atmosphere, and attention to detail was everything I could imagine. To start, the restaurant called a few days ahead of time to ask whether about the  special occasion and any questions/clarifications about the menu . As we were seated, we were given complimentary and delicious champagne. We ordered the vegetarian tasting menu. Everything in this menu was delicious - even the palette cleansing tomato sorbet. We had a great salad with tomato broth with the perfect flavor, amazing tortellini tenderly cooked, and ending with the strawberry creme brûlée cheesecake (yum). We were completely stuffed, but they also provided us a coconut cake. Overall, Gramercy Tavern created an unforgettable meal and night! I will be back to celebrate the best occasions.",1,,1
16,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",202,1241,267,5.0,6/18/2018,"I was here with a large group of others several months ago for someone's birthday. I can't remember absolutely everything we ate and the seasonal menu doesn't help with this as much. We were sat in one of the side rooms and I remember some type of painting on the wall. The service was excellent as expected for a well known restaurant though not as stiff as some other fancy places. In terms of drinks, they surprisingly have an extensive craft beer menu and the prices aren't that egregious compared to stores/craft beer bars. I got a Goose Island Bourbon Barrel Stout (2015 or something similar) which was excellent as expected. Another person got a spritz which had some great grapefruit flavor.They served their Pullman's loaf with goat cheese infused butter which was buttery and very tasty. The bread was hot and easily pulled apart and it was a highlight. The amuse-bouche was an Organic carrot salad (roasted pieces as well as blanched) with curry cashew butter. It had a good mix of sweet and spice and served well as a pre-tasting.For my appetizer, I got the Squash Salad with Lobster, Farro, and Brussels Sprouts. The dish had a nice mix of sweetness from the lobster and nuttiness from the rest. I can't think of another way to properly describe it outside of fresh. I tried from someone else an (I believe) special of the night which was a smoked vegetable soup with hazelnuts. I believe it was parsnips or something similar. The dish was unique but quite tasty.I went with the Lamb Ravioli with English Peas, Green Garlic, and Pecorino as my main dish. As expected, the dish was rich from all of the earthiness but the sauce made it balanced and it was quite tasty also. It however paled in comparison to another dish I tried from someone's vegetarian menu. They had the Parsnip/Cheese Agnolotti with Charred Onion Broth, Maitake Mushrooms, and Grana Padano. This was easily one of the best vegetarian dishes I have tried. I tried some Sea Bass from someone else which was fine.Though the majority of us were pretty full, we ordered dessert. The majority of us got the famous Cookie Platter with Milk. I'd go into all the types but outside of remembering the flourless chocolate cookie, a rugelach of some type, and something that reminded me a bit of a spice cake, I don't remember much else though most of them were very good. Another person got a cake of some type though they were having cookies from someone else eventually. The wait staff also brought out a Coconut Meringue cake for a person's birthday which was a nice gesture though the cake itself was bit too sweet and rich. They also served some Mignardises for the table, a Orange/Calamansi jelly and a PBNJ Chocolate. The former was excellent with great sour flavors and the latter was pretty terrible, surprising after a long night of excellent dishes. The staff packed up the remaining cookies in the coat closet which was humorous and there was also granola bar which was good the next day.This was an expensive meal but the food here was overall excellent (in particular the vegetarian entrée and my appetizer) and worthy of it's acclaim. The service was some of the best I have had and I can see why it's been open so long. There is another 1 star Michelin restaurant I prefer (at least for lunch as I have not had dinner there yet) known as Gabriel Kreuther but this was very, very good.4.7.",2,,

Even after a couple delicious brioche between the courses, my wife and I were still hungry at the end of the six courses meal.  Good place for a date, as long as you don't come in starving...",1,,1

Updated review","I had dinner at Gramercy Tavern last month, and it was a pretty flawless experience. My one other meal here was a business lunch in 2009, and I remember liking it but not loving it. Well, I love it now.I went with my husband, my mom, and my cousin during a trip to New York. We chose Gramercy over trendier options because my husband is picky but wanted to go to a quintessential New York restaurant while he was in town. I might not have gone back otherwise, and am so glad his white boy palate came in handy for once.Our reservation was for 7:15 on a Sunday night. The dining room was busy and vibrant, pleasantly humming with activity. It was an attractive space, big and elegant with high ceilings and warm lighting, white tablecloths on every table. The atmosphere was as formal as it gets these days. You're probably fine as long as you look showered and dressed like a grown-up.Service was exceptional. Our server Aimee was warm and attentive and immaculately competent. Gramercy Tavern is a non-tipping restaurant, with hospitality included in the prices. Nice and stress-free for us, and I would assume the pay for staff is decent. I feel like Aimee could work anywhere.We shared a nice bottle of chardonnay with dinner, but we started with a round of cocktails, which were all great. The Little Bird was a bright, sophisticated tropical drink with Appleton Reserve rum, dry orange curaçao, Velvet Falernum, prosecco, mint, and lime juice. The Cool Hand was a smooth, spa-crisp gin cocktail with Forthave Blue gin, Skinos Mastiha, Dolin genepy, cucumber, and lemon juice. The Rocky Mountain High was a light, refreshing highball with Brekenridge gin, green chartreuse, elderflower, orange juice, lime juice, and tonic water.Gramercy offers a three-course prix-fixe menu as well as a couple of tasting menus. We went with the prix-fixe, which gave us plenty of room to choose--even Matt B. had multiple ways of avoiding icky foods like vegetables. I did have to eat his little welcome dish of romano bean salad. A happy chore, as the beans were superb, firm and tender, dressed in a nutty romesco sauce. I reluctantly gave him half of my whole wheat angel biscuit in return. Such a lovely bread plate, the biscuits fresh and beautifully browned, served with goat cheese butter.We dined more or less family style, and everything was fantastic. For our first course, we got the marinated fluke, the Forono beet salad, and two orders of the tagliarini. The fluke was a stellar crudo, thin, supple, silky slices of fish served with a cool combination of cucumber, basil, lime, and radish. The beets were earthy and toothsome, plated with blackberries, hazelnuts, and fatty strips of pancetta. The tagliarini was a rich pasta, I'd guess about twenty times the calories as the fluke, though who's counting. It came with summer squash, bacon, pecorino, and basil. The noodles were too thin to be quite al dente, but they were good, thickened with plenty of cheesy sauce. We got fish, pork, and chicken for our entrées, and it all felt very classic and just perfectly cooked. The sea bass was flaky and glisteningly buttery, a fat fillet served on a colorful bed of sweet corn, tiny tomatoes, and chiles, with a lush corn purée at its base. The pork was tremendous, tender loin and a slice of belly that was all lacquered skin and good fat. It came with fava beans, both whole and in a chunky purée, as well as strawberries and ramps. We doubled up on the chicken, and while I know you're not supposed to get chicken when it costs the same as the sea bass, this was a good decision. The chicken was phenomenal--I'm not sure how the breast was cooked, but the thigh was fried like karaage, and both were super juicy and flavorful. It came with tarragon, carrots, and snappy summer beans.We ordered four desserts, and Aimee threw in a fifth just for good measure. My favorite was the sweet corn cake, a moist, crumbly cake golden with corn and butter, served with corn ice cream, goat cheese whipped cream, blackberries, blueberry basil jam, and toffee popped sorghum. The Bakewell tart was a close second, the pastry crust dense and buttery, loaded with strawberries, white chocolate, and almonds. It came with a quenelle of strawberry sorbet. I also enjoyed the pavlova, an impressive igloo of meringue filled with mahleb ice cream, finished with sesame and sour cherry. The chocolate hazelnut custard was nice, too, with vanilla cream and apricot jam. The milk and cookie plate was on the house, and it was cute and deeply satisfying. There were two fresh, fat cookies, white almond fudge and chocolate hazelnut, and a tiny mason jar of sweet milk.We were sent off with luscious cherry basil bon bons and almond caramels, and house granola bars for breakfast. This was a grand meal, with top notch service and wonderful food. I get why Gramercy Tavern is so iconic. It has staying power--it was old when I went in 2009, and I expect it'll still be there nine years from now.",9,7,7
19,Dee P.,"Markham, Canada",19,106,229,4.0,6/1/2018,"We were in NYC for 5 days and went to Gramercy Tavern for our first meal. I wa sligjtly worried when we may not be served because we were in leggings and running shoes sightseeing. To our surprise our server was friendly, professional, and animated whose service really blew our minds.Interior was pretty to say the least  and the food delectable. I had a plate of duck meatballs that was just a tad bit salty, but the cocktail and house foccacia were amazing. We were disappointed it was a non- tipping restaurant, it was one of those situations where I felt injustice for our server because she really deserved that tip!",2,1,
20,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,4.0,6/9/2018,"Gramercy Tavern is a hybrid tavern/dining experience (mildly separated venues), that share a strong 1-star Michelin drink/food. I went to the Tavern, which is more casual and only supports al a carte; the other option, the Dining Room, is a more traditional Michelin dining experience  with several prefix menus and al a carte options in a sophisticated setting. Overall, the food craftsmanship was top notch, the portions were decent, and there wasn't much fru-fru stuff going on. Service is excellent, as is expected; the venue was extremely classy and beautifully decorated. A strong 1-star for sure.Ordered:Arctic shard - shard, very shroomy and earthyDuck liver spread - very weak liver taste, but very nice whipped texture. I thought it was good, but definitely others wanted the flavor explosionCheese potato bread - really enjoyed this bread. Had 3 piecesBurger - a solid burger, comes with sweet potato chips. Very basic though.Sea bass - comes with what I thought was a miso sauce, spring garlic sausage, mussels, and some sort of root (a radish i think), really tasty sauceDuck meat balls - nice tender meatballs, with a bread that was similar to naan, and a really good garlic almond sauce",1,1,
21,Jeff T.,"Roseville, CA",105,111,717,4.0,5/30/2018,"Second time eating here and this time it was to celebrate our wedding anniversary yay us! I'll say it was another fine dining experience with exceptional service from Lara. She was well versed with the menu and super knowledgeable on the wine pairings. Definitely worth splurging a bit to eat at a NYC staple. We had 9:30pm reservations and arrived on time however had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. To start us off I thought it was a nice touch with two glasses of champagne since they new prior we were celebrating our anniversary. We opted for the 6 course seasonal tasting menu and it was divine. I'll spare you and myself typing out each of the courses, but I'll post a pic of the menu. All of the dishes were excellent, but my fav was the lobster with asparagus, leeks, and tarragon. Also, the muffins with the goat cream cheese butter is straight crack. I knew I shouldn't have, but we got seconds on the bread and that straight put me over the top! The strawberries and cream desert with the angel food cake croutons was bomb!Anyway, definitely worth eating here and worth it to do the wine pairing to get the full experience.",1,,1
22,Selina C.,"Toronto, Canada",24,85,486,5.0,4/20/2018,"This review is just for the burger at the Gramercy Tavern. I arrived around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon was able to snag a seat at the bar within 10 minutes and there was a party just finishing up. I plopped myself down at the end of the bar a few minutes later and ordered the Gramercy Tavern Burger ($31) by chef Michael Anthony... Which might be the best burger I've ever had! It's made with simple ingredients without all the razzle - a beef burger topped with cheese and bacon - but it definitely dazzled my tastebuds. I could tell you about the light and airy bun that is freshly baked in house and made with Yukon Gold potatoes.Or I could talk about the generous layer of nutty molten Cabot Cheddar which is first emulsified in a skillet and then poured over the entire patty resulting in a cheese that holds together without being overly oily.Or I could even describe the strips of house cured bacon that are perfectly cut to the right thickness and then cured in a sugar and salt solution before being smoked and grilled so that it is crispy but still has a nice chew with just the right amount of fat.But what I really want to talk about is the smokey beef patty which is butchered and ground daily in-house. It is a lightly packed combination of top round (50%), brisket (25%), and short rib (25%) resulting an extremely sweet and beefy flavour while still having an incredibly moist, juicy and light texture. My first bite of the patty immediately released a burst of juices that began to spill out onto the plate. Jaw droppingly good.The burger also comes with crispy duck fat fried chips which are delicious on their own or if you want to up the flavours even more, you can dip them into the smoked onion aioli which have a nice kick of jalapeño.Apparently they only make a limited number a day (I've heard between 25-40) so try and get there early. $31 might seem expensive for a burger but I guarantee it is worth every bite.Oh! An added bonus... Gramercy Tavern is a NON-TIPPING restaurant! Hospitality is already included in the price! Love it! So European!",7,,

24,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",171,54,99,3.0,8/19/2018,"Decided to try this restaurant because of the hype but was disappointed. My friends and I had dinner here at 9:30PM and it was packed! It's a huge restaurant with a 'tavern' section and a 'dining room' section. We dined at the dining room but it was still a relatively casual setting; the dining room was tad more intimate but both settings were kind of loud. The place had really nice decor and was dimly lit.  Food: 3/5. Nothing spectacular. Very average food that I feel like could be found at any of the better restaurants in NY. Don't really see why it has a Michelin star. My friends and I got the 6 course tasting for $179.-Complimentary angel biscuits and goat cheese butter: 3/5. This was served warm which I really appreciate. Had evident layers, as well. However, I thought it was a little bland. Goat cheese butter that accompanied was good, though.-Forono beet salad: 4/5. Lovely salad with a nice balance of tartness from the blackberries and saltiness from the pancetta. The hazelnuts added an interesting component in terms of flavor and a good textural contrast. Could do with more pancetta though. Refreshing dish overall.-Soft shell crab: 5/5. Served warm and had a nice crunch. Crab was meaty enough. Good start to the savory dishes to come.-Halibut: 3/5. Didn't really wow me. Summer squash was a little sour and the cook on the halibut was just OK. I think they sous vide the fish so it was pretty juicy and had a soft texture.-Squid ink lumache: 4/5. Perfectly al dente pasta and classic flavor combinations with the squid ink pasta, lobster, and tomatoes. A tiny kick from the peppers. Overall, good, but again, nothing out of the ordinary.-Duck breast & confit: 3.5/5. Also a classic flavor combination of duck + some sweet sauce that can be found in nearly any restaurant. I feel like they also sous vide the duck before searing it here so it had a similar finish as the halibut. -Frozen sheep's milk yogurt: 5/5. My favourite dish of the night! Very light and creative with the chickpea crisp reminiscing a meringue. Yogurt with a twist due to the sheep's milk. -Sweet corn cake: 4.5/5. Also yum! Love the sweet and sour from this dessert. Toffee popped sorghum tasted a little like caramel popcorn and added a nice sweetness. The corn cake itself wasn't too sweet and the blackberries was perfectly tart. I would have liked more goat cheese though since didn't get much of a taste of it.Service: 4/5. Nothing out of the world. Our server didn't really check up on us throughout the meal. However, we were allowed to sub certain dishes from the a la carte menu to the seasonal tasting menu.",2,,

Updated review","Came back again, and this time for dinner. I was already hammered coming in, so I could barely read the menu, so I ordered the tasting menu since I didn't have to worry about ordering individual items. Wine pairing...sure, I'm already drunk, what's another 6 more drinks going to do to you.My favorites for this second visit were the mushroom tortellini, lobster salad and the dessert. Service was again outstanding.They also gave me some to go dessert too. Also just a block away is Craftbar which is also under the same ownership of Gramercy Tavern. Great cocktails and service there too.",5,4,3
26,Alexis M.,"Dallas, TX",26,86,25,3.0,8/15/2018,"I feel as though we must have hit Gramercy Tavern on an off night.  I was a huge disappointment that our food was not up to the standards of the other reviews.We both got the 6 course tasting menu, one seasonal and one vegetarian.Good:  The service here is outstanding, all of the waiter/waitresses are attentive and helpful.  We enjoyed that there was always somewhere there.The seasonal menu was well rounded menu.  Although the soft shelled crab course made us hesitate to try, it was one of the best courses.  If you are going to try a 6 course meal, I suggest the seasonal. 5/6 dishes where amazing.Vegetarian tasting menu- 3 courses stood out, the tomato salad, corn tortellini, and dessert.  All 3 courses left me wanting more, but the other 3 were hard to eat.Bad:  First off, it is summer in NYC.  So I understand some AC's are working overtime, but it was hot in the dining room.  How hot was it?  I had perspiration on my face and I was in a summer dress.  My poor date had a jacket on, can't imagine how hot he must have been.  We are from Texas and use to the heat, but that dining room was HOT.Also our 6 course tasting took about 3 hours, IDK if this is a con.  But be prepared.  We had a reservation at 8, thinking we would be out by 10.  At 10:30 we asked for our last course to go, because we were exhausted from our day.  Many other came and left so I do not think this is the norm.  Lastly, the vegetarian tasting menu was not great.  After reading a few reviews of people saying this was the best dishes they have ever eaten. The vegetarian menu was better than the seasonal.  In our experience this was not the case, not even close.  Nearly 3 of the dishes were inedible and I eat vegetarian majority of the time.  I would skip it altogether.All in all I think it was an off night for GT.  That was unfortunate for us.  I wouldn't go here again with so many other options when we come to the city.",1,,1

They were able to accommodate me to an earlier time so we can make it to a comedy show. We got seated right away and was served two glass of champagne. Then we got the 3 courses menu for dinner.

30,Angela L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2065,395,640,4.0,7/18/2018,"During my recent trip to New York City, our friends chose this restaurant to dine at on a Saturday evening. We had made reservations well in advance and we were seated in the middle of the main dining room. We were all dressed up and we noticed many of the other tables were wearing shorts and casual clothes. I wonder if this affects where you are sat. The restaurant has a long history in NYC, I believe they have been here for 25 years. The inside is refined and polished but yet relaxing and almost casual. There is a bar to the far left side when you walk in. Your main dining room options are simple, either the 3 course Prix Fixe side of the menu or the other side, which is their 5 course Tasting Menu. They do however require the whole table to decide on one option so no mixing and matching. We all agreed we would order from the Prix Fixe side.For my starter, I ordered the Beef Tartare, which was not in a tower style but served flat in a bowl. This was tasty and excellent. For my main dish, I ordered the Sea Bass, also tasty and fresh, not overly seasoned. I ordered the Triple Sorbet for my dessert, which was tart and tasted like it was made fresh in the back kitchen.Our waitress was very welcoming and quite professional. She was very clear in our options and more importantly, she was careful to work with us as the majority of our table had dietary restrictions. I would especially recommend Gramercy Tavern if you have such restrictions. They're more than accommodating here and it makes fine dining that much easier and relaxed.",18,8,16
31,Eric H.,"New York, NY",184,166,310,5.0,4/18/2018,"Gramercy Tavern is known for their fresh and seasonal ingredients and tasting menu. Everything on their menu is elegant, lovely, and detailed oriented. The service is immaculate and the food was excellent. I had the arctic char which was delicious but the star was the warm bread with goat butter that you start with, probably THE BEST BREAD I've had in my life. Gramercy Tavern is worthy of their Michelin Star and if this is your first Michelin Star dining experience, you're in for a treat! -@EricHoRaw",1,,1
32,Tzara P.,"New York, NY",0,9,22,4.0,9/3/2018,"We came for our anniversary and loved the experience! We sat in the main dining room with the white tablecloths and a serene atmosphere (quite different from the tavern near the street). The space had an aire of a moody napa winery, a nice change from the NYC scene-y restaurants.We were greeted at our table with a complimentary glass of bubbly (can't remember if it was champagne or prosecco). We each got the seasonal tasting menu with the wine pairings: I think the most inventive dish was first one: the cucumber soup served cold with shrimp was a taste I wasn't expecting and one I'll never forget...sooo good! Everything else was tasty and fresh but not boundary-breaking.The service was what you'd expect from a Michelin starred restaurant but without too many frills. We'd definitely come here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for an elevated food experience.",,,
33,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,326,593,5.0,2/19/2018,"Gramercy Tavern is a New York institution -  a restaurant you may have read and heard so much about, but you only know how amazing it is once you try it yourself. I had a birthday dinner here, and the entire experience was exceptional from start to finish.We came here a couple minutes after our reservation and waited for a bit at the bar while they got our table ready. The place was absolutely packed, with many patrons just waiting for their tables or eating at the bar. The restaurant is divided into a more casual 'tavern' near the bar, and a slightly more formal dining room. Both the spaces are really well done up, and the tavern is livelier though the dining room is more intimate. We were seated in the dining room, and our server was with us shortly. He was really polite, and had a bit of old-school formality about him. The dinner started off with a butternut squash puree amuse-bouche that was really tasty, and the softest bread rolls you'll ever taste which were paired with some delicious herbed butter. For appetizers we tried the smoked trout which was fresh and flavorful, and the ricotta cavatelli that had a hearty delicious beef bolognese. For mains, we did the lamb loin which was perfectly cooked and juicy, and the pork loin and belly - which was a pork dish done three ways, all of which were brilliant! For dessert we had the passion fruit tart which was fruity and sour, and the chocolate custard which was rich, smooth and tasty. I also got a complimentary coconut cake for my birthday, and some chocolate truffles and granola bars to take home at the end.This has to be one of the best, if not the best meal I've had in the city. A special occasion spot for sure, and well worth it.",2,,3

35,Alexandra K.,"Jersey City, NJ",222,148,538,5.0,1/21/2018,"My sister and I came to Gramercy Tavern on a particularly snowy Thursday evening for our annual holiday treat yo self dinner. We were worried the restaurant would close but luckily they did not and as a bonus they had a ""sNOw"" corkage fee special so we ended up BYOing our wine. Of course, that didn't stop us from enjoying one of their excellent cocktails. I opted for the seasonal tasting menu while my sister had the vegetable tasting menu. Honestly, there was not one thing that we disliked about our food and it's hard to pick my favorite dish of the night. The tortiglioni pasta was everything a decadent winter pasta should be with earthy mushrooms, specks of bacon, and perfectly crafted fresh pasta. My duck was cooked to absolute perfection with a crispy, well-seasoned skin and delicious accompaniments. Perhaps the surprise favorite of the night for me was the smoked Arctic char. The Arctic char was lightly seared and covered in a horseradish cream. Every bite of the dish left me wanting more!We indulged in a cheese course before dessert which was a fun addition to the tasting menu. We went with a chef's choice selection of 3 and our waiter expertly described each of the cheeses, breads, and garnishes to us. He recommended starting by pairing the cheese with the matching garnish and then having fun with the combinations. We did exactly as instructed and devoured it all. Coincidentally, my dessert came with a cheddar cheese ice cream and guess what - I could still have eaten more cheese and more cheese ice cream. Back to our waiter, he and the rest of the staff were absolutely superb. Everyone was friendly, attentive, and seemed to genuinely care if we were enjoying ourselves. The dining room decor could probably use an upgrade as the tavern decor really outshines that of the dining room which reminded me a bit of a hotel restaurant.",11,6,7

37,Sarah X.,"New York, NY",51,101,260,5.0,1/24/2018,"This review for Gramercy Tavern is long overdue. I've been here twice, once in the Dining Room and one in the Tavern and both experiences were amazing. Dining Room:Waitress came extremely frequently to check in on us and our water cups were frequently refilled. The waitress also provided excellent menu recommendations and all dishes had really nice flavor profiles and were presented beautifully. My favorite part of the meal was actually the dessert though I really love sweets (I got a raspberry themed dessert). At the end of the meal we also received truffles and a complimentary Gramercy Tavern granola type bar to take home.Tavern:Came on a Sunday to try their secret menu burger which did not disappoint. Didn't need to make a reservation although we came before 12pm. It is a huge burger and if not super hungry would suggest sharing it between two people so you can also try a few other things on the menu. Also got an cobbler/walnut/ice cream dessert which could have potentially been too sweet but the slight sour taste of the cobbler balanced it out nicely. They gave us complimentary bread which was also really fresh/tasty.I would recommend the dining room experience to anyone. It was one of the best experiences I've had. If I return I would probably just get dessert in the Tavern though since that was one of my favorite parts of the meal and many of the dining room dessert options are in the Tavern.",3,1,1
38,Jessica L.,"San Francisco, CA",107,140,52,4.0,7/30/2018,"Multiple people recommended this place to me so I felt obligated to try it.  I was able to get a reservation on a fairly short 2 weeks notice but it was super late at 9pm.The tasting menu was interesting as there were a 3 course one that you get to pick your own adventure, a seasonal no decision paralysis prix-fixe, and a vegetarian equivalent of it.My friend got the 3 course which was supposedly surprisingly filling, I got the seasonal tasting menu which was delicious but slightly more filling than I'd like.The cucumber soup was really good and the fish was super fresh, very well balanced taste.I'm usually not a huge fan of soft shell crab but omg this was delicious.  I don't know what they added in the batter but it was very flavorful without being overwhelming. The sauce and other veggie around it complimented it perfectlyThe Halibut was solid, perfectly prepare but nothing too extraordinary tbh.The beef was really just ok.  I didn't like whatever relish was on top, it was too salty and didn't really go with anything, it's like they gave up or something...  the meat was prepared well but not much flavor.  I must note that maybe I've been spoiled by the other beef in my life, the wagyu, the perfect steaks etc... The sheep milk yogurt was interesting, as in interesting experiment but could've been fine if it was just one bite.  Nothing exciting here..Overall solid fine dining experience, not a destination resturant, but not bad if you happen to be in town and wanted a good night out to somewhere nice.",,,

Updated review","Reliable, classy, beautiful, quintessential NYC restaurant. I've been to the Dining Room twice and went to the Tavern side, and both sections are equally great. Dining Room is perfect for special occasions, the Tavern was perfect for a nice lunch date and an especially good burger.The Tavern doesn't take reservations so you can expect to wait, but luckily we went on New Years and only waited 10 min. We started with a roasted broccoli salad (5/5) which was crisp and charred and had a lot of terrific components. Then a few vegetable sides including a miso sweet potato (4/5) that I wish was a little more savory and more miso-y, and also roasted cauliflower (5/5) which hit all the right notes of salty, sweet, and sour. The primary goal of this trip was to get our hands on the burger, which apparently sells out around 3pm daily. It's apparently one of the best burgers in NYC. Well I can tell you with confidence after my year-long burger quest, that the Gramercy Tavern Burger (5/5) is one of the best, if not THE best burger. The meat is juicy, rich, yet balanced in a way that's not as beefy as Minetta Tavern; a blanket of sharp cheddar adds enough funk, and the bacon actually doesn't overwhelm. Apply special sauce if you want (I did for half of mine). The chips are super crunchy and good, but I still kind of missed my fries. Ended on a sweet note with Pear Cobbler (3/5) which was the only disappointing part of the meal. Oddly it was very bitter, the stewed pear itself was not sweet and the crumble on top was more of a whole wheat muffin top - going for a healthy dessert? The madeira ice cream was amazing though, and definitely boozy. It is a little pricey at first glance, but the prices include gratuity. And the service is still awesome. They check up on you as needed, refill your water seamlessly, and are kind and gracious. I loved the holiday vibes inside the beautiful space, and it is one of my most highly-recommended restaurants in NYC.",6,,5

41,Marc R.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",3,70,7,4.0,8/5/2018,"We had the 6 course tasting menu again. The Halibut was perfectly cooked although we both thought they could have done something to make it a little more interesting. My wife's tortellini was outstanding. Their version of Carbonara was somewhat flat in flavor and disappointing. The cold soup of cucumbers and shrimp was fantastic. Not something we would have normally ordered but was memorable and the star of the show.  After the duck which was really good with a confit and relish we had a tomato sorbet as a palate cleanser which was really good. A little olive oil and sea salt on top was the perfect compliment to the sweet tomato sorbet. In that they were very lightly handed and allowed the flavor of tomatoes to really shine through. Service was excellent as usual. I love the all inclusive bill and wish more restaurants did this like in Europe. The reason for the 4 star this time is we both felt the food had been better in the past the this time but wouldn't stop us from coming back. We really love this place and it's whole feel. Staff r incredibly friendly and it's upscale yet laid back. The other reason for 4 stars is something we saw we felt was really uncalled for and needs to stop. Everyone is well dressed. Some in suits and ties or proper attire of some manner. We were on the main dining room in the back because we prefer a low noise level. There was one diner was was literally wearing a Camo T-shirt, shorts and flip flops. Now if he had been up front at the bar area that's fine. However, this is a nice place. We along with everyone one else are paying good money to eat here and enjoy a special evening in a special place. Times have changed and that's fine but a T-shirt and shorts? Perhaps Olive Garden is better choice for a diner with no manners or concern about others. The restaurant needs to stop this immediately. He should have been told he can eat in front but not in the main dining room like that. We were talking to a few other people near us and we all agreed. I don't want to looking at this guys feet and hairy legs when I'm in a beautiful place like this. It's insulting to the other patrons and the restaurant. What next bathing suits?Yes it was that annoying.",,,
42,Merisa H.,"Mineola, NY",102,68,60,4.0,7/5/2018,"I want to start by talking about the bread! OH MY GOSH. This is the best bread I have ever had, and I pride myself on being a bread expert! It had a goat cheese butter that was to die for! Wowza!Okay on to the meal. I tried the lobster appetizer, pea shoot salad, the bass, and the famed burger. I ordered the burger medium rare, and it was definitely black and blue, which is fine with some people, but I don't love that. I didn't think the burger was spectacular as everyone said, but maybe that's because the temp was not to my liking. The bass was outstanding! It had this green sauce that I could have eaten with a spoon! The pea salad was also great. Nice and light. The lobster was a little chewy for my taste, so I would pass on that. We also tried the cookie tray and baklava ice cream. WOW. The baklava ice cream was probably the best thing I've ever put into my mouth! I strongly recommend that! The cookies were also incredible! Props to the pastry chef! You are the real MVP!",1,,
43,Marissa S.,"Irvine, CA",273,813,3093,4.0,12/5/2017,"Service was top-notch. Having decided a little too late for reservations in the dining room, Tavern seating was our only option. That also meant being on the wait list. We happily imbibed on a few too many glasses of wine in the waiting area and while doing so, the receptionist kept us posted on the timeline until our table was ready. He was friendly yet professional and made us feel like truly valued guests. He even freed our hands from our half-filled glasses as he walked us to our table when it was ready. Just impeccable.In the midst of all the action, the energy was riveting in the tavern compared to the fine dining section in the adjacent room. The menu was simple and short as opposed to having the Tasting Menu option on the formal side. We started strong on the apps with the rich and luscious Duck Liver Mousse ($22), beautifully Grilled Octopus ($22) with a crunchy finish from the pine nuts, and my favorite out of the three - Brown Butter Cavatelli ($19) with smoked mushrooms, pecorino, and squash. If your goal is to be satiated, this dish will get you there (also available as a main entree).I saw rice on the menu and I let the Asian in me get swayed to pick it as my main. Smoked Pork Fried Rice ($34) it is. Sadly, it was more appealing on paper. The Wagyu Meatloaf ($36) was not my cup of tea and I may have to blame the poblano sauce or the meat texture for that. On a brighter note, the Sea Bass ($35) was a knockout. The mixture of clams and chorizo added outstanding flavors to the fish that was impressively cooked. This plate was my ultimate high but if you prefer red meat, I'll let you in on a secret. Their Bacon Burger ($29) is an off-menu item which is going to blow any burger aficionados' mind away. Even those potato chips on the side were killer. Michelin awarded them with 1 star while I give them 4 solid Yelp stars. I may have to return and try the Tasting Menu for that last star.",35,31,35

My wife's Seabass was also excellent, served on a bed of thin sliced leaks and potatoes with a heavenly rich creamy broth. We had an apetizer of the zucchini flatbread which was tasty and quite extra garlicky. I had their ""little bird"" cocktail, a mix of Appleton reserve rum, lime juice, falernum and proseco. I also asked for a mai tai made with Diplomatica reserva (one of our favorite rums), it was superb, mixed with their house made orgeat. Service was spectacular also.

47,David C.,"Rumson, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,11/10/2018,I had lunch here last week and was seated right next to the line cook working the grill. It was one of the worse experiences I've had. I ordered the tavern burger medium. It was delivered to the table bloody in the middle. The waiter asked how everything was and I mentioned it was under cooked. He said they would fix it. As he told the line cook she proceeded to tell him it was cooked perfectly and I didn't know what I was talking about. The worse part is I was within ear shot of her. The waiter then tells the head chef who comes out from the kitchen and tells the line cook the customer is wrong and it's medium. Again I'm sitting right there. No apologies My sons a chef and I eat out a lot. Not to mention it's an over priced $32.00 burger. I always thought the customer was always right. I guess it makes sense this is a no tip restaurant they forgot all about customer service,,,
48,Gina D.,"Cary, IL",82,14,4,4.0,8/2/2018,"I've got mixed emotions about this review.  I've wanted to visit one of Danny Meyers' restaurants for a long time and finally, last Friday, I traveled to NY and made this a must see.We ordered a few beers, a cocktail and a few entrees.  We ordered the burger, sausage plate and lettuce salad.  They were all very good, not earth shattering for $31 a burger, but presented and made well.I'm not sure how much the prices were before the decision was made to become a non-tipping restaurant, however I feel our meal ticket was double what it should've been.  Almost $300...The service was excellent.  The staff was on point, happy to be there and the gentleman who sat us could be overheard leaving several tables with a simple, and not forced, ""Have a wonderful time"".  They're genuine and get hospitality.  Well done.The restaurant needs an update.  I know it's been around for a while, however, I didn't expect it to be decor from the 90s.  I would've expected some updates here and there to keep it looking current.  In summary, they lived up to their reputation in service, the food was good, the decor outdated and the prices were up there.",,,
49,Mai Y.,"San Jose, CA",146,320,1663,5.0,12/5/2017,"Gramercy Tavern is definitely one my favorite restaurants in New York. The food is AAAAAmazing and service is great too. I found this restaurant listed on eater New York's list of recommended restaurants in New York and I had been dying to eat here for a few years now. I decided last minute to come here for lunch on a Sunday. I didn't have a reservation but we were seated immediately in the tavern, we just couldn't sit in the main dining room. Burger- This is a MUST! It's probably one of the best burgers I've ever had, albeit one of the most expensive too. The patty is perfectly grilled and super juicy and flavorful. I'm drooling just remembering how good the burger was. I'll definitely get this again when I return to New York.Halibut- the fish was cooked perfectly! Crispy on the outside and lightly fluffy on the inside. I took a peak at the dinner menu and the pre fixe menu is $179 per person. It's pretty expensive but based on how good the food was in the tavern I would definitely come here to try the dinner. Most of the dishes seem pricey but it's also because they don't charge tip. It's pretty much covered in the price of the dish.",2,,1

Had heard amazing things about the food and service but they still blew away our expectations. Every dish we had was amazing. My friend has a gluten sensitivity and they made sure all dishes would meet her needs. My favorite part was the mini Coconut cake they were serving for birthdays. I'm not sure if this is their standard bday cake but it was amazing. I was also surprised to find out that it was also dairy and gluten free. You'd think those ingredients would be necessary for the best cake you've ever had!! Other standouts were the Beef Tartare appetizer, Ricotta Cavatelli appetizer, and Chicken breast entree but everything was sooo good! They also end the meal with truffles & a homemade granola bar.

My lunch here, however, turned out to be just an average experience. Scallops were fresh and seasoned well, but then the sea bass was simply boring. The fish itself was pretty bland and the sauce a bit too salty. Would not recommend. Service was attentive though.",,,
54,Susan F.,"New York, NY",1,125,638,2.0,5/17/2018,"The staff at Grammercy Tavern is friendly and professional. The manager goes above and beyond to make his patrons happy. The dining room is filled with gorgeous floral arrangements. The bar/tavern area in front (no reservations accepted) is loud and very tight. We scored a last minute reservation for dinner in the dining room.  Our issue is with the chef's flavor profiles. The scallop was lost by the many components of the dish. Strawberry, celery, rhubarb.  Less is more. Lobster.  Cooked perfectly. The lobster was center stage with asparagus, tarragon and leeksSea bream also cooked perfectly but smothered with a sauce (could not understand what  the runner said it was) with spaghetti squash, pumpkin seeds and sherry (off of menu)Garganelli with fava beans, clams and guanciale.  When I ordered I told the waiter I do not eat meatyet they served me pork in the pasta dish. When I called someone over to say a component looked like pork I was assured it was clam when in fact it was pork (guanciale). Unaccepable. Almost certain duck followed for him which he said was oversalted. I had the bass which was cooked and seasoned wellWe were told we were being served a beet sorbet with feta cheese as a palate cleanser.  By no means was this a palate cleanser. . One taste and I put my spoon down.  I needed an ice cold lemon sorbet to cleanse my palate after that taste. Last course strawberries and cream.  Whipped vanilla cheesecake, crispy angel food cake and sorrel ice. Tasted like vanilla ice cream with sliced strawberries (wish it could have been strawberries from Malaga Spain) with some tasty crunchy nuggets at the bottomSurprisingly he did not have even one piece of crunchy deliciousness in his dessert.  Where is the consistency?We were given chocolates at the end of the meal. He said they were good.",3,,1

I had a 5:45pm reservation so it was a little earlier in the night, when we arrived we were seated promptly and immediately greeted by our waiter asking what kind of water we would like. We ordered 2 seasonal tasting menus and a bottle of sparkling wine. Service was attentive and checked up on us often and with each course that came out they gave a full explanation of what it was. The chilled cucumber soup was so much better than I had expected, soft shell crab was crispy and amazingly textured, halibut was absolutely perfectly cooked (though I feel like the flavor could have been more interesting it was still so good), the squid ink pasta and the beef were hands down the best courses of the menu!!!! We were given a pre-dessert ice cream which was an heirloom tomato sorbet with olive oil salt and pepper and I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The goats milk ice cream with the melon ice was even better and my favorite part of the meal. My boyfriend told them it was my birthday before we started our dinner and they brought out a complimentary coconut cake just before our dessert which was so cute. Everything was so amazing. I would 100% recommend coming here for dinner, especially for a special occasion.",1,2,1

59,Jennifer C.,"Flushing, NY",70,88,354,3.0,10/8/2017,"There was nothing inherently bad about my lunch, I just expected...more (especially when factoring price into the equation). When the dining staff dresses better than I can, I expect that every facet of the meal with live up to that same standard. The food was: good, the service was: good, overall: just good. This restaurant has the potential to be amazing, the type of place you would go to for a milestone celebration, but everything was just a smidge off.When I arrived, there were two hosts, one on the phone who completely did not acknowledge us (which is fine, she's on the phone), and a second one who just happened to be in the process of seating someone else. He returned after a couple of minutes, I provided him with the reservation information, and shortly after we were seated in the dining area.  I started with the mocktail ""N/A-GRONI"" which was comprised of San Bitters, Grapefruit & Club Soda, if you enjoy San Pellegrino flavored sodas, you'll definitely enjoy this.We started off with the complimentary ""Angel Bread"" with goat cheese butter.  The roll was delightful, warm, fluffy, sweet - a perfect foil for the earthiness of the goat cheese butter.First lunch course was Ruby Red Shrimp, Romano Beans, Almonds, Harissa - I enjoyed the crunchiness of the beans with the almonds and the spiciness of the harissa, but sadly, the shrimp, which should have been the highlight of the dish underwhelmed me, it was just a little more well done than I prefer my shrimp to be.Second course was pork loin, belly and sausage - nothing wrong with meat in this dish, I just wasn't inspired by this, each bite was again, just good.  The squash under the meat was a little over-ripe so the rind was a tad chewy.After the first course, there was an inordinately long wait for the second course, so long that while we had originally planned to order dessert, we had to pass in order to make it to our next function on time (we were seated for a little over two hours). When we had finished our first course, one server hovered while waiting for other servers to become available so that our empty plates could be removed at the same time. During the attempted synchronization, one server accidentally bumped my elbow while removing a dish, he apologized, and took my empty course plate, but left my bread dish, while some of the other guests' had their bread dishes removed. Nothing to be upset about, but these tiny inconsistencies almost make this feel like a new restaurant still working on their rhythm, rather than an established experience.Gramercy Tavern reminds me of a ballet, beautiful planned coordination and costumes, but the orchestra is just a few seconds off, rendering the entire experience palatable, but lackluster.",3,2,2

61,Billy S.,"London, United Kingdom",82,133,172,4.0,10/1/2017,"Gramercy Tavern deserves 5 stars, but I had to knock a star off because the host experience was a rough start for what was meant to be a special evening. We were celebrating an anniversary and very much looked forward to dining here. Upon arrival, we waited to check in with the host. There were four hosts crowding around a computer screen, busily sorting out tables, but not one person raised their head to greet us. We waited patiently and after a few minutes, one finally looked up and welcomed the older white couple behind us and invited them in. It was like we didn't even exist! Granted we're young, but we had a reservation too. We finally interrupted the hosts to ask if we could please be served. They did not apologize.The rest of the evening was uneventful and wonderful. Thea, our waitress, was incredible. Some of the best service I've ever had. So genuine, so happy, and so eager to help. She made our night. And of course the food was exceptional. Classically American, unpretentious, and of very highly quality. We'll definitely be back.",4,1,1

There is something for everyone. The atmosphere is relaxed yet upscale.  The service is cheerful, wholesome and engaging.We decided to go with the lunch tasting menu ($89) which included: marinated scallops, sea bream, tortellini, duck and dessert.  Each dish was masterfully prepared with fresh ingredients - showing off clean, clear and accessible flavours. The tasting menu is only available in the dining room. However, Gramercy Tavern also has a bar. The bar menu looks quite good and I would return to try the bar menu. If you are in New York and you are looking for restaurant that would not disappoint, Gramercy Tavern would be that restaurant. It is also the quintessential American restaurant.",,,1
63,Karmán M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,10,5.0,4/24/2018,"-- 2 amazing tasting menus with brave innovative spirit --The review will focus on the food (I won't bother you with the decor, the wine and the waiters. All you need to know is they are all decent)We booked our seats on opentable and ordered the usual tasting menu as well as the vegetarian tasting menu. The amuse bouche is a cabbage flavored chicken broth shot with cheese mousse. As a chef myself, I've nothing but respect to this first dish. The cabbage is well cooked to remove the earthy bitterness yet preserved it's unique sweetness which is well represented in the chicken broth. The cheese mousse added an additional layer of texture and salty flavor the the already-amazing dish, bringing it to the next level. 1st dish (non-veg) is a cold cut scallop. decent1st dish (veg) is a veg soup. refreshing and decent2nd dish (non-veg) is lobster with vegetable. The lobster meat is so tender and perky. The flavor is well contrasted by the hint of bitterness from the vegetables (asparagus, among others), highlighting the sweetness and savory of the meat. Respect!2nd dish (veg) is citrus topped with nuts and sauted vegetables. THE BEST citrus dish i've had among all the fine dining place and def one of the best veg dish.3rd dish (non-veg) is seared fish with daikon. The dish is extremely untraditional as it almost tastes like a Chinese dish, yet extremely well-done within the scope of New American cooking. 3rd dish (veg) is a salad highlighting the roast carrot. MY ABSOLUTE favourite. The dish is meticulously balanced to induce the sweetness and the sophisticate texture of the carot. It's always hard to cook a vegetarian dish cuz very few vegetable can be the backbone of a fine-dining-level dish. Tonight, I'm delight to see Gramercy taking a shot at it and give such amazing solution. I'd go back again just for this dish4th dish (non-veg) is cheese & bacon ravioli. Very decent dish, amazing flavor. In general, you could hardly go wrong with cheese and bacon. So this is almost like cheating :)4th dish (veg) is a vegetable raviolo. Frankly a disappointment. The vegetable is not fully cooked and hard to chew down. The raviolo is also not well cooked5th dish (non-veg) is duck breast. Well cooked, the flavor of the duck is well presented. If you've been to Hong Kong, you might find the flavor to be close to a Cantonese roast (in a good way).5th dish (veg) is brussels sprout salad. Frankly another disappointment. As the main dish, it fail to surpass the 3rd dish in it's flavor or it's texture, thus causing major disappointment. To be honest, I'd even say the SweetGreen salad is no worse than this.I'm no expert in dessert, so I'll leave that part to other reviewers.Overall, I'd say the non-veg tasting menus is super strong and well worth the price, while the veg tasting menus has a strong start but went down hill after 3rd dish. From the entire experience, you can definitely see the emphasis on vegetable in both menus and the innovative use of them. I salute such brave trials cuz I don't know how to structure a vegetable based main dish either. It's a world class problem in the culinary space.Will I come again?Yes +1,000 times. Dining here is like talking to the chef and constantly learn sth new. A restaurant with such long tradition yet being consistently innovative and forward looking deserves frequent visits.Big fan! Attaching my standard of 1-5:5 - so good that you should fly there just to try it. Innovative and delicious. Strong menu overall.4 - outstanding in its category locally. Would worth up to 1h drive. Strong dishes here and there.3.5 - great food here and there but unstable quality. Would be a good choice for take-out but definitely not constitute a good date night dinner.3 - if you come with expectation of 3-star food you won't feel disappointed. Mediocre at best.2 - subpar food / service. Something might come out to ruin your experience.1 - no, just no.",1,1,1

Thanks to Alessandra, our private event was organized well within the short period of time we had given her. The service was spectacular, and I honestly think that makes a huge difference. The portion sizes of our three course menu was large enough to make us all quite full. The bread was delicious and served warm. Each dish was presented very well and the timing of the dishes was spaced out perfectly, so that we didn't feel rushed whatsoever. And the flavors in each dish paired so well with each other - duck breast with strawberries and beets. I would say the appetizers and entrees tasted better than the desserts overall, but the chocolate custard dessert was very good.",,,
65,LaiSun K.,"Lexington, MA",49,165,241,5.0,9/3/2017,"As a special treat, my partner and I came here for dinner after attending the US Open tennis. We knew about the long wait for a table and reservation which required to be made far ahead so we decided to turn up anyway to try our luck. We have watched Youtube videos and read many reviews about this place and as we are fans of Tom Colicchio of Top Chef, and knowing his successor, Michael Anthony has taken this place to new heights, we knew we would not go wrong coming here.First impression - this place is beautiful, has an old style interior decor - leather & wood, fresh flowers everywhere but a little noisy as the seating is intimate. Put our name down for both the bar and a table and stood at the bar waiting for whichever became available first. Bar staff were friendly and attentive even though they had their hands full serving seated customers. We got our drinks about five minutes of being there. About 20 mins into our wait, we were approached by a sharply dressed gentleman to head to our table. What a pleasant surprise as we were told that it would be 45 min to an hour's wait. Immediately, we were given water and our wait staff Elizabeth came over to introduce herself and gave us the menu. While we were mulling over what to order, the Head Chef came over and offered his recommendations. What a treat! Michael Anthony was a super nice guy as we never would have expected someone this important and busy to wait on us. We even had a little conversation about food, tennis and Massachusetts oysters!We had the app of seafood tower, entrees of duck sausage and pork fried rice and dessert of berries and cream with Panna Cotta.  Drank Syrah from Vallin Santa Barbara and cocktail of sour whiskey. We had a great meal that night! The seafood tower was amazingly memorable - it consisted of Island Creek oysters, grilled shrimps, poke of some white fish, apple kimchi (the best!), lobster salad and several pickled dishes mushroom and veggies. The entire night was a delight and I would definitely return to have a meal here if I visit NYC again. I don't remember getting such great service in any high end restaurants anywhere in the world. They seemed to enjoy what they do and do it with great commitment to excellence.",4,,1
66,Katrina C.,"Norwalk, CT",64,8,1,2.0,9/8/2018,"Food: 3 starsService: 1 starThis review is mainly about their service and my experience ordering the restaurant's vegan options.The service is very friendly, but so, so, so slow. Yes, I ordered a tasting menu, which is expected to take a while. But we were at the restaurant for over 2.5 hours by the time I asked for the check. Between servings there was an incredible amount of downtime and by the end of the meal no one was coming to the table to check on us. I believe we were the last seating for lunch (2 PM) though we were actually seated by 1:45 PM, so it's possible they were tied up preparing for dinner service, but my service as a patron shouldn't suffer because of that. I'd be more forgiving of a non-Michelin starred restaurant. My boyfriend and I came here for the lunch service on a Saturday. I am vegan; he is not. I asked the waiter what on the menu can be made vegan and was directed to the vegetarian tasting menu with modifications; the only other choice was the tomato salad appetizer without cheese. It took a very long time for the waiter to get back to me to let me know what my substitutions would be. Well, one of the more filling dishes (a pasta dish with cheese) would be substituted with a melon salad, and the cheesecake substituted with sorbet (which is available on the regular menu). Seemed like a big tradeoff not worthy of an $80 pricetag but whatever, I went for it. Well, I was lucky that they were able to bring us unlimited bread.None of my food ""wowed"" me. Again, I'd be more forgiving of a non-Michelin star restaurant. I was particularly disappointed with my melon salad substitution (literally just chunks of cantaloupe with a sprinkle of mint and peppers) and the roasted eggplant. The eggplant was so salty that it made my mouth hurt, and I enjoy salty food. The sorbet was also very bland, and the cherry flavor was so sour it was practically inedible but maybe it just wasn't my particular cup of tea; I'm more upset about the blandness of the strawberry and blackberry flavors. Nothing was bad or gross, just overall uninteresting. For what it's worth, my boyfriend absolutely loved the burger he ordered and said it was probably the best burger he's ever had.",,,

Updated review","I made my third visit to Gramercy Tavern for lunch with my parents and it was a remarkable meal.  Both my mother and father left stunned by the nuanced, thoughtful recipes that Michael Anthony adds to classic American recipes. This restaurant is really one of best in the Country.For lunch, my father and I had one of the specials, which was a roasted corn soup with a waygo beef, roast beef sandwich. The soup was delicate with olive oil floating on the surface. Each spoonful was full of roasted, smoked corn. It was a lovely soup. The roast beef sandwich was on a crusty bun with cartelized onions and layers of rare Waygo beef. It was beautiful.My mother ordered the Cavatelli with squash and smoked mushrooms. It was topped with shaved pecorino cheese. I had one bite and it was beautiful dish of fresh pasta with Fall vegetables. We were too full for the dessert menu, but it look very good.Again, Gramercy Tavern delivered one of the most impressive meals I have had. I cannot wait for my fourth visit.",1,,1

69,Angie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,15,28,3.0,3/31/2018,"Ever see that movie Chef with Jon Favreau? If you've seen it you will FULLY understand my comments on the illustrious Gramercy Tavern. I experienced Gramercy Tavern way back when Tom Colicchio was at the helm, and many times after the hand off to the current chef Michael Anthony.  Gramercy Tavern was one of my favorite restaurants but tonight's experience left me puzzled. The service is still impeccable. We had a wonderful server and about five assistant servers who always kept our glasses filled, always asked if we needed anything, etc. The sommelier provided top notch wine suggestions. So why the 3 stars? The ambience, food and decor. It's been years since I last dined at Gramercy Tavern. Years ago it used to be chic, trendy and delicious. But tonight it was just plain tired.  I thought I was dining at a franchised hotel restaurant.  The food we ordered was fine but there was nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing refreshing about this meal.  It was so boring that only my dining companion prevented me from falling asleep while chewing. Instead of dessert we opted for the cheese course. That was a mistake. I didn't enjoy a single cheese or flavor pairing. How do you go wrong with cheese? Here's what I liked foodwise: the chef's amuse bouche was a cabbage broth with cheese foam -absolutely delicious, and the truffle chocolates they give you as a courtesy at the end of the meal are quite elegant. So, Gramercy Tavern, technically precise cooking and good service, but about as boring a menu as I've seen and a dining space that is so uninspiring I suppose I understand the menu now.",1,2,

No line, no wait so I thought closed but I had checked and the hours said open.  Come around closer to 2pm and the place is yours (well, sort of there's people but you can get a seat).I chose to sit at the bar which was filled with a great variety of people from all over - locals and travellers.The bartender was awesome. She knew her drinks and was very helpful. Really wish I remembered her name but she was professional and seemed to know the regulars.House made bread to start.

Ice cream), because even their simple options are great.  Our ice cream includes a green curry flavour (what!?) and tastes amazing.No tips are required as it is included in your meal price.",1,1,

It's Sancerre, it's good. Then came the best bread rolls with a creamy whipped goat cheese butter - we had to ask for seconds later on.My boyfriend went with the classic seasonal tasting menu and I went with the seasonal vegetable tasting menu. I'm not vegetarian, but for this meal, everything on the veg menu looked so enticing I had to go with it. I would recommend doing this so you can get.. literally the whole menu. Personally I much preferred the veg menu!!Amuse buche - shot of cabbage soup with pecorino foam, SO good. For him (made substitutions due to shellfish and nut allergy):FIRST - marinated amberjack, carrot, charred scallion, pumpkin seeds. Citrusy like ceviche. A refreshing and bright starter.SECOND - beef tartare, chiles, pickled grapes. Interesting the pieces were all diced up into perfect squares as I'm used to more roughly chopped up tartare, good but not great.THIRD - smoked Arctic char, sunchokes, horseradish. Melt in your mouth good, paired so well with the creamy horseradish sauce and crunchy pickled sunchokes.FOURTH - tortiglioni, black trumpet mushrooms, bacon, rutabaga. Good but I liked mine better ;)FIFTH -  filet mignon with cauliflower and grapes. Steak was perfectly done, paired so well with the sweet, salty, and creamy sauces!Palate cleanser for both - beet sorbet with feta cheese. We both weren't into it.SIXTH - caramel pears with cheddar ice cream and toffee sauce. Interesting first few bites but the cheddar ice cream was a little too adventurous in the endTo end: Calamansi fruit jellyFor her:FIRST - chestnut pudding, hazelnuts, sunchokes, pickled apple. This was one of the best things - it tasted like dessert!! Creamy pudding paired with crunchy bits of nuts and sour apple.SECOND - cauliflower & burrata, anchovy, capers, sunflower seeds. I loved this too!!! The anchovy was a great touch.THIRD - roasted delicata squash, chicories, pecans, pears. Loved this, but maybe there were too much nuts that it's very filling.~ just going to interject here and say I was already full at this point, don't underestimate the veg menu, it's very filling esp with all the nutrient and protein dense nuts and seeds ~FOURTH - parsnip agnolotti, charred onion broth, maitake mushrooms, grana padano. Another table favorite. Like I said, preferred mine over my boyfriends!FIFTH - forono beets, quinoa, black garlic, mustard greens. Probably the best beets dish I've ever had, due to its accompaniments (loved the quinoa mix). Generous portion and wasn't able to finish. Preferred my boyfriend's steak!Palate cleanser - because my main was beet central the palate cleanser was very unnecessary for me.SIXTH - goats milk cheesecake, sorghum cookie, fermented honey, mandarin sorbet. If it weren't for all the enticing veggie dishes that caught my eye then it definitely was this dessert that made me go with the veg menu HAH. The two of us just ended up eating my dessert because it reigned supreme.To end - pb&j chocolate bonbon and pecan ganache bonbon. Loved the pb one!Because it was my birthday they also came out with a coconut meringue cake - not great, really dense and way too coconutty! And I like coconuts. But it's alright, it was complimentary and a nice surprise :)As if we weren't already stuffed, they sent us home with a chocolate fruit and seeds granola bar.Had a really great time here, definitely a great place to celebrate something special! I was more than happy going with the vegetarian menu, would definitely recommend that if you want to eat some of the best veg dishes you'll ever have.",3,1,2
79,Ellen C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",180,145,925,5.0,2/8/2018,"Gramercy Tavern is my husband's favorite spot :) He wanted me to try his favorite restaurant so we came here for a celebratory lunch. I'm writing this review a little too late, but I really have to say the wonderful experience I had at Gramercy Tavern. The staff greeted us when we entered, and we got seated in the nice comfortable couch area. Ambiance was really comforting, cozy and warm. Everything on the menu  looked so good that I had hard time deciding what to get. I don't remember exact names of each entree, but I really enjoyed their grilled octopus which was cooked to perfection. They gave us a champagne and complimentary dessert at the end to celebrate our special day (how nice). Every single dish was perfect, and the service was also fantastic. I wish I was a little more eloquent to describe how good each dish was-- attaching pictures instead.Gratuity was all included. Writing this review makes me want to come back to this place soon!",3,,
80,Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",97,1542,40,5.0,4/15/2018,"The service at Gramercy tavern is the best I've experienced. The staff is incredibly courteous and polite. We felt like royalty dining here. Everyone was attentive and made sure that we didn't need to lift a finger.For starters, we shared the beet salad. It was simple, earthy, and flavorful. It was topped with nuts and small pieces of popcorn to add a little crunch as well as lonza adding some savoriness. For the main course, my girlfriend and I each ordered a burger. It was made with very high quality beef leading to a juicy and flavorful burger. It was exactly how I'd like - just a bit short of medium rare. It was topped with cheese which appeared to be melted down with steam as well as bacon. It was an outstanding burger!For dessert, they served me a complimentary toasted coconut treat for my birthday. I also had a cup of chamomile with my dessert. It was a perfect finish to a wonderful meal.The customer service here is exemplary and I'm eager to bring my friends from out of town here!",,,

Past the entrance is the bar area with lots of individual tables for small groups, and then the formal dining area for groups who wish for a more intimate meal. Part of the kitchen is open, with the grill blazing, and the remaining kitchen is closed off. They dabble with creative options but also make available staples such as their amazing burger. Everything is done well. The food is delicious. The drinks strong and tasty. The staff super professional, friendly and knowledgable.

88,Jay S.,"Bellevue, WA",0,4,6,5.0,1/7/2018,"This is the best meal I had in all of 2017. Everything was simply stunning, from the drinks to the service. Our course included some scallops for appetizer and lamb for entree and peach ice cream for dessert. You start tasting these fresh ingredients which you never get in any market or store whatsoever. They are handpicked to perfection. Even small things such as navy beans have such a great flavor to them. You can probably judge by looking at all the reviews that this is a fantastic place to eat but if you are ever in New York, make a reservation and try for yourself. Yes it will cost about $400 for a two person meal but it's a bargain considering the experience and taste.",3,,1

The beef tartare and lamb loin was good it was prepared well. The Lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare. Beef tartare sauce taste like a salsa I had a Mexican place before. The dessert was okay. I think I would come back to try their taste menu. Drinks were good.,1,,
90,Kenny L.,"Roslyn, NY",131,97,255,5.0,2/11/2018,One of the best meals. The amuse bouche was buttery and a great compliment to the bread they supplied. It's going to sound crazy but our amberjack appetizer tasted like fruit loops and it was amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly and was not chewy. The salmon was perfectly cooked as well and one of the best I've ever had. The mushroom tortiglioni was a bit on the salty aide but was still tasty. The duck breast was great and so were all the desserts. Highly recommend trying their tasting menu.,1,,
91,Rashmi G.,"Chandler, AZ",598,454,963,5.0,5/27/2017,"This was our first Michelin Star restaurant experience and it was a pretty great one! We were a bit indecisive as to which day we were going to go to Gramercy Tavern so we actually walked in without a reservation. The wait time at the bar was about 30-45 minutes and for a table was about 90 minutes. We opted to wait for a table because of all the rave reviews!They have their restaurant divided into the Tavern & the Dining room. At the Tavern (bar & some table space), patrons can order from the a la carte menu while there is a full multiple course menu in the Dining room.We started off with a couple of their Specialty Sodas (Strawberry & Basil / Vanilla & Passionfruit) & were offered some bread. All were enjoyable as we browsed through the menu. Per recommendation from our waiter, we decided on getting two appetizers & two main entrees. Everything was ordered at the beginning and the meal was paced by the kitchen.The appetizers we got were the Asparagus Salad & Cavetelli with Pesto. The Asparagus Salad was light & fresh, I was surprised by how good it tasted with the tarter sauce. The Cavatelli was as expected; the pesto was tasty & the pasta was cooked very well.For the entrees, I got the Grilled Shrimp & Carrot Stew and my husband got the Lasagna. The stew had a different kind of flavor & the broth was the most enjoyable part. I didn't realize there was going to be any fish in it along with the shrimp so that was a nice surprise! My husband enjoyed the lasagna and it was pretty flavorful but it was a bit on the heavy side.Overall, a very pleasant meal & the service was spot on! The kitchen paced the meal well and our server helped us by making good recommendations. We'd definitely suggest checking out Gramercy Tavern for a fancy dinner night out.",29,18,27
92,Jonathan K.,"Cerritos, CA",462,139,166,5.0,6/24/2017,"A restaurant in LA needs to learn how to make a burger like this venue here. Not even joking. I'm so happy my friend told me about this spot as I visited new york because I LOVE BURGERS. It's been a couple weeks since I had it, but man i still dream about this burger and want to experience the flavors of it again. Like how can you hate on a burger so simple, yet delivers flavors beyond ones imagination. Of course I'm over exaggerating, just a bit. But got damn, I want to eat this burger again ! Please to-go me one to LA lol.Anyhow, burger is about 30 bucks. I say it's worth every bite. Seriously, if you're thinking about what to eat and you're reading this. Don't hesitate and get your ass moving to this location and grab a burger. You could thank me later.Would I come back? I am back at heart  and i will eat here when I come back in the future.",2,,2
93,Kyle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,41,33,5.0,1/26/2018,"We visited Gramercy Tavern while in the city over Christmas. We had a reservation for the dinning room, after being seated and talking to our waitress we learned the GT burger is no longer served in the dinning room. We knew there was a long wait for the tavern but our waitress went and double checked, she was able to put us in the list for the bar which had a 15-20 minute wait. She told us we could stay at the table until the bar opened up. We told her we felt bad holding one of her tables and she told us not to worry about it. They gave us bread and drinks while we waited. Once our seats at the bar opened they came and got us in the dinning room.  While looking over the menu and waiting to order I noticed the bartender was serving wine in a glass to another person at the bar. She wiped the glass down after pouring the wine. This attention to detailed matched same as we saw in the dinning room. While we waited, all of the staff was super friendly, accommodating, and took pride in their job. Now to the food:For an appetizer I ordered a special the bartender told us about. It was bay scallops with clams and black truffle. All served in the clam shell (see attached photograph) the scallop clam mixture was amazing. I easily could have eaten another serving. I also for the Fall Classic cocktail  (Bourbon, Laird's Apple Brandy, Apple Cider, Thyme, Lemon Juice) which was also very good. For my main of course I got the GT Burger, since this was one of the main reason for coming in. When I ordered it the bartender asked how I'd like it cooked, I said rare at first but then asked how they recommend it, she said she had it black & blue so I decided to get it that way. WOW I have to say this is one of (if not) the best burger over every had. It was served with potato chips fired in duck fat. They were good but I spent my stomach room on the burger. I could not get enough of it, just writing this I'm wanting to have it again. Lol. I'll for sure visit the Tavern again when I am in the city. I'd love to try other items on the menu but I am not sure I could pass up ordering that burger again.",1,,
94,Sara L.,"Vancouver, Canada",18,7,10,5.0,7/28/2018,Delicious food - great service - not stuffy like some of the other spots we went to.

95,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,8900,4.0,5/19/2017,"Owned by Danny Meyer and often considered by various publications to be among the best restaurants in the city, Gramercy Tavern is legendary in the NYC dining world. It's where Tom Colicchio made his name, and although I'm a hair less attracted to him than I am to Padma Lakshmi, I'm a big fan of that Top Chef. The kitchen is now run by Tom's successor, Michael Anthony (remarkable consistency in only having two chefs during a lengthy run in such a transient city and industry). I've been hearing about this restaurant my entire life, and combining that with many stars from many critics, I must say I probably came in with almost unreasonably high expectations for my first visit. These expectations were met in various ways, and unfortunately not in others. Things That Made Me Believe The Hype:The squash tortellini with arugula, bone marrow, and crispy gremolata. This was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. It was head and shoulders above the rest of the tasting menu (and obviously better than everything on the vegetarian tasting menu that my wife opted for). The service. It was relaxed, but impeccable. I'm pretty sure the hordes of fine people scurrying around the dining room in uniform would've brought us anything we asked for. ""You want a toe? Hell, I can get you a toe by 3 o'clock this afternoon. WITH nail polish."" (I also appreciate that this excellent service is included in your meal. It really makes a massive difference when you spring for a meal like this, because 25% of a million dollars is...a lot of money. I'm not good at math.)The lagniappe. From the perfect bread and goat cheese butter you start with to the coffee and caramel petit fours at the end of the meal, not to mention the chocolate granola bar you are sent on your way with, and the beautiful dessert with a chocolate inscription they sent out for my wife's birthday...this is a restaurant that knows the vast majority of us can only afford to do this on a special occasion. And they treat you accordingly.Things That Made Me Flavor Flav:*The marinated sea scallops with blood orange, fennel, and pumpkin seeds. Although it was gorgeous to look at, the scallops were under-seasoned and dare I say it, downright slimy. This was also the first dish of the tasting menu, and such a disappointment. It wasn't the only flaw in the food, but luckily nothing else was as off. That said, it was a sad way to start a meal I had been looking forward to for years. If they were just trying to temper my expectations, it worked. Everything else we ate fell much closer to the squash tortellini than the scallops, but the meal overall wasn't quite the perfection I had envisioned. I realize that my expectations were probably unfairly lofty, but that's what prices and a reputation like this get you.Conclusion:Please believe me when I tell you that this is still an incredible restaurant. It is impossible to have a bad time here. Between the majority of the food, the service, and the people-watching, you have to hate deliciousness and fun and having your every whim catered to if you walk out of this restaurant in a bad mood. But I think I'm going to eat in the Tavern next time, because I can't afford to drop this much money on those scallops._____________*youtube.com/watch?v=9vQa…",19,6,6

The interior is such a mix of design elements but somehow they all work together to create a warm and inviting environment. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. The house made soda was delicious (passionfruit and vanilla) I wish I would have tried it with the recommended shot of rum. The burgers are far and away the best burger I've ever eaten. It was topped with cheese and bacon and came with their housemade sauce (similar to thousand island), but the star of the show is the beef! It's LOADED with flavor, juicy, perfectly cooked, and honestly just amazing. The housemade chips that came with it were also super thin and crunchy. All in all just a wonderful experience.

The food is close to divine: a wonderfully original beetroot, blackberries, hazelnuts and pancetta salad for starters, and a lamb loin cooked to perfection, accompanied by a fine merguez sausage, broccoli rabe and ricotta on grilled sourdough as the main course.

105,Andrew C.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,84,60,5.0,5/8/2017,"Review for the off-menu burger only. Will update when I return for a full meal!Overall (5 stars): The off-menu burger is a gift bestowed upon us. The meat falls apart in your mouth and the smoky flavor of the cheese and bacon complement the thick patty marvelously. The bun is somehow perfectly studded with sesame seeds throughout and toasted so that the outside is crispy but the bun itself still maintains chewiness. The chipotle aioli adds even more spice and smoky flavor to the burger. General: Upon stepping inside of Gramercy Tavern, one can feel that this is a world-renowned establishment. We arrived early before the restaurant opened on a Saturday afternoon, though I feel that we still would've gotten a seat if we arrived a little later. Service here is impeccable, from the time it takes to order drinks, order food, receive food, have all your plates cleared away at once, etc. You really receive top-notch treatment here. Food: I'm unsure if this is still true but I heard Gramercy Tavern only produces a limited number of these burgers each day. The restaurant grinds ribeye, filet, and other trims of the cow freshly each day. The wood-fire grill they use to smoke and grill the patty and bacon imparts that amazingly smoky flavor to the burger. The meat itself is so incredibly juicy and melts/falls apart in your mouth. The chipotle aioli and pickled fresno chiles are wonderful toppings to the burger for that extra kick of spice. Everything works together to deliver you one amazing burger experience. I can't wait to come back to the restaurant to try some of the items they have on their regular menu.Overall summary back up top!",6,3,3

We had reservations, bur were quite early.. as I love sitting at the bar, having a drink with my friends and watching the environment, seeing the people interact and living in the moment of the experience. This is what life is about... then, wondering what I will have for dinner...typically waiting to eat most of the day in anticipation of the food ahead. The service is impeccable. This is a non-tipping environment, so hospitality is included in the price of the meal. This concept is very new, but it makes sense when you have this kind of experience. We had the 3 course meal... Started with Beef Tartare, Pine Nuts, Chiles, Pickled Grapes & the Squash Salad, Lobster, Farro, Brussels Sprouts and both were lovely. 2nd: Sea bass and Pork loin... both were to die for... 3rd: We had some lovely chocolate pudding and ice cream to finish and were very satisfied. This is an ""experience"", not just dining... so it wouldn't be an every day occasion, but hope to return again to experience it again. It was one of the highlights of my dining adventures.

Gramercy Tavern is one of the top restaurants in NYC and completely lives up to the hype that surrounds it.Everything we tried on the menu was delicious. It was a home run. I highly recommend trying the tasting menu so you get a sense of what the chef is made of but visiting GT bar-side is still worth it. Overall, the cocktails may not be the most creative but they are made with quality alcohol that make them worth ordering.For me, the highlight was dessert. That chocolate pudding was easily the best dessert I've had in my life this far. It's a must if it's an option and you're visiting GT.The price tag may be high but I've found that GT is able to deliver on if you should pay for it.

112,Danielle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,32,1,5.0,7/2/2018,"First visit was this past weekend for my boyfriend's birthday and it was everything I'd hoped for! Ambience : We sat in the dining room versus the more casual tavern area. Classy but warm and without being overly formal. I wasn't sure about he dress code, but it was pretty relaxed on our visit. To be fair, it was 95+ degrees that evening so it may be a little dressier during normal temperature evenings. Service : Excellent service! Everyone was just the right amount of charming and helpful, without being overly intrusive. Food : I chose the seasonal tasting while my boyfriend did the vegetable tasting. The first course in the seasonal was a scallops dish; I asked if I could have anything else (because I think scallops are gross and terrible!!) and our waiter let me choose anything off of the appetizer section of the prix fixe! He suggested the beef tartare, and despite my unease, I went with it and loved it! Much better than other iterations of beef tartare I've had in the past, Gramercy tavern's version was delicious and its texture was on point. The Lobster was also a  standout! Online menu listed duck as the meat course, but on our visit, a beef dish was in its place. That was the only disappointing part of the night; the beef was good, but not amazing. Strawberry and cream dessert was also a 4 out of 5. I took a bite from all of the vegetarian courses and though I might be a little biased, I thought the seasonal tasting was better, except for the gnocchi dish in his tasting. I had mentioned we were celebrating a birthday on OpenTable and during the reservation confirmation call and so with dessert, they also brought out a complimentary mini coconut cake with a candle, which we enjoyed. As for price, it was definitely a splurge meal but if you're looking to celebrate and have money to spend, give it a shot. Overall, it was a delicious experience and had a welcoming atmosphere that still made you feel a little fancy and special.",,,

And then, GT surprisingly succeeded in topping off a perfect meal, w an unforgettable dessert.Matcha ""cheesecake.""They use the term ""cheesecake"" loosely here.  Just as the waiter explained beforehand, it is more like a mousse.  The lightest, silkiest, & creamiest mousse you've ever had in your life!  The first spoonful stopped my thoughts.  It's a showstopper...visually & gastronomically.This is one of the best desserts I have ever had.  A highlight of my NYC trip.I understand why everyone loves it here.A perfect meal.5 stars.",9,6,11

120,Jamie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,76,13,3.0,4/13/2018,"When I refer to myself as the greatest painter in America it's not because I think it true, but it's what I aim for. I imagine the Gramercy Tavern is just as defiant in their self-declaration, and what a bold undertaking it must have been to serve a smoked white fish meant to resemble a hot dog with sauerkraut. It's this type of whimsy that makes the Gramercy Tavern as fun as insufferable. How intentional is the pretension?I happen to think that intent in art or gastronomy matters as much as the final product. I come from a school that preaches intent to be everything. Post-modernism and white canvases, after-all, if not for their intended statements would be a heap of tangibly valued things. What is post-modernism but a bunch of mumbo jumbo...it's hardly impressive to suggest the subjectivity of life, to say that nothing is and everything is all at once. Of course that's true. That's elementary philosophy... And ahh, what is grossly scientific and convoluted, the Gramercy Tavern and their infinite forks...I sit here with my father from out of town. He'd prefer cheap Thai with generous portions. He says, ""Why so many forks?"" and I laugh. Perhaps we aren't the most aristocratic brand, but we are not necessarily plebes either. Dad reads the news sites every morning. We're having a Malbec. We bite into a delicate pastry filled with an olive tapenade. It's this dinner I tell my father about Leine. That she doesn't seem well, and that I don't really know how to help her. But I don't go into detail. Sometimes she shakes in bed and asks me to hold on to her. She's strong and I hold her with all my love and try to absorb her bad energy, as if it's transferable from flesh to flesh. I kiss her temples and hum some songs. We listen to a capella music, The Kings Singers, because once I was high on a bad trip and it soothed me, so I play it for Leine. I want her to be on a cloud with me. I float alongside her, but I feel her weight sinking through the packed moisture. She sweats through nightmares. I wish she was here now at The Gramercy Tavern, having dinner. ""Why Montreal?"" Dad says. ""She has family there. But I'm not totally sure,"" I say. By dessert, I have a light film of sweat that I can feel forming on my brow. I'm full. My large father, I can tell, is still hungry. He's making lewd jokes, unrelated to me and Leine of course, and looking around to see if anyone else appreciates him. He's one of those guys, never strictly business with the wait staff. He says, ""Don't be uptight, handsome."" Slaps my back. He says, ""There are many fish in the sea."" I ask him what he thinks of the hot dog fish and he calls it millennial stuff. But I look around and don't see many millennials. I do see a bunch of people who likely read the New Yorker and have convoluted ideas about simple things. They know how to use the many forks. This isn't a rare dinner for most. I can tell. Their shoes. Their watches. I'm well-versed in English, Italian, Swiss...I put on a custom blazer and wonder what Leine would be wearing here. She once showed up to a nice dinner in a Chinese silk blouse, her blonde hair in corn rows. I've never been more proud of walking into a room in my life. As for the Gramercy Tavern, I long to come back. I just don't want to do it again without her. It sucks, doing anything without her. It's as if I've forgotten the torment of hardship. Better times, good wine, and a corn-crab bisque. What does it mean when people vanish from your life like feathers off a too-fast bird.",2,2,3

124,Peggie Y.,"New York, NY",212,180,2469,3.0,4/8/2017,"Came here for dinner.  We had to wait 15 minutes even with a reservation.   The dining area is beautifully decorated.  The menu is simple, for dinner, it has a 3-course menu for about $125.  The dishes change seasonally.  We had the beef carpaccio and squid ink campanelle (squid ink pasta) as the first course.  The squid ink pasta was very tasty, it had bits of lobster, chorizo mixed in the sauce.  The beef carpaccio went well with the garnishes - peach and arugula leaves.  The appetizers were the best part of the meal. For entree, we both ordered the duck breast with sausage, the portion size was very small and honestly, the sausage didn't go well with the duck breast.  The combination was very strange.  The duck tasted okay but the meat was not tender.  I had better duck elsewhere. One thing to note, their rolls are very good. They are flaky and buttery, I believe they are called Angel biscuits/rolls. For desserts, we had the raspberry and chocolate desserts.  The raspberry dessert is a coconut milk cake, topped with apricot sorbet and raspberry.  The chocolate dessert has milk crisps, lavender and hazelnut brittles.  The ingredients, etc. are listed on the menu which would help the selection process.  For special occasions, they would present your table with a small cake on the house.  There was a couple sitting next to us, celebrating their wedding anniversary.  They were given glasses of champagne and a cake.  Great personal touches there.  At the conclusion of your visit, your server would give you some goodies from their bakery to take home, we were given 2 homemade granola bars.  Overall, I think the food at Gramercy Tavern is average.  Their menu also seems to carry very basic American dishes.  The taste of the food is not very tantalizing.   Their dining room is also very loud.  The restaurant does seem to be very popular as customers kept coming in during my visit.  However, I believe you can get better quality food in NYC with that price.",3,1,
125,Melora J.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,6,2,4.0,9/18/2018,"Had dinner here last night with two other couples.  In a business capacity.  In other words someone else was picking up the bill.  Thank goodness because this place is not cheap.  It's lovely inside - a bit quirky- not modern or trendy- lots of dried flowers and flowery country themed decor- but a nice feel.  Like you are in France The food was yummy.  Had a raw fish appetizer and then a roasted fish as a main. Both super delicious but definitely NOT big portions. The menu is a bit limiting in the sense that you either do the price fixed or the ""left page""from which you choose three things.  Does not seem to be an ala cart.  Starter, main, dessert. The service is a bit old fashioned and frankly I found it a bit aggressive in one way yet slow in another way  plus... service is always included apparently ...no incentive for them to be fab?Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food. My husband had the lamb which I tried and loved .Decent wine selection by glass and bottle. I would race back if someone else was paying but would be hard pressed to go on my own dime. Just too many other great choices.",,,
126,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,5.0,10/31/2017,"I had a total knockout dinner here nearly two months ago. Thank god everyone I was with went for the tasting menu so I could indulge fully. Also thank god I wasn't paying for it. Unfortunately, business meals mean pulling out a phone to take pictures is frowned upon and, coupled with the copious drinks, my memory of this is now hazy.I will say that Gramercy Tavern is no longer on the cutting edge-- many of the dishes I had here I've seen elsewhere. A couple different fish dishes (one decent, one stellar), an excellent duck breast, a gazpacho; it all looked and tasted a bit like the usual suspects. Only a couple of things were trying to show off, like the tomato-basil ice cream at the end. But the level of execution is so high, and everything so simply delicious, that I'll excuse it. Everything tasted like summer gently bridging into fall.What also pushes them over the top for me is an uncommonly good beverage program, with many by-the-glass wines, a wide selection of nightcaps, and fantastic pairings. Service is, as always, strong.I think if I looked back at what we paid and the reputation, I could split hairs about some of the dishes here; I don't know that it's ""best in the world."" But as it was, I practically floated out of the restaurant. An excellent experience with that hard-to-quantify feel-good factor.",1,1,

I recommend you try the roasted, they were delectable- Grilled Shrimp & Carrot Stew, Cumin, Mint and Sesame Flatbread ($30): deliciousness. The stew was like a cream soup, with hints of ginger. Very well finished flavors and super smooth texture.- Monkfish, Lobster, Celery Root and Mushrooms ($32): loved it, the sauces on it are light but flavorful. Lobster pieces are small, but I expected given it is not priced as a large lobster dish.- Caramelized Cheesecake, Tarragon Cookie, Pistachio Halva and Blood Orange Sorbet ($16)Service was great. Our server explained to us in detail the dishes we were interested in. She also brought a delicious birthday cake after I asked her in secret at the back to bring something with a candle. I knew it was a no-tipping restaurant, so it was a pleasant surprise to be treated so nicely.Wine selection is really good, organized by type of wine and then region.

129,Sarah G.,"Manhattan, NY",149,185,815,5.0,3/25/2017,"This place lives up to the hype!!!On Saturday around 2:30pm the four of us were lucky enough to snag a table at the tavern (which only accepts walk ins and is more casual than the formal dining room in the back).Like all Danny Myer restaurants, service is a key component to dining and you don't tip since hospitality is included in the price.To start.---Clam flatbread, celery root & salsa verde ($24)Shared between the 4 of us this was by far everyone's favorite dish. 6 small slices were plenty to start the meal. The flatbread was super thin with a thick, decadent and creamy sauce. The clams were a nice touch, not fishy or overpowering at all.Entrees ---Tavern Burger (I believe $30)This is actually not on the menu, is exclusively served at the tavern at lunch and if you look around it's a very popular dish. The burger comes with a thick layer of cheese which I believe is cheddar/gruyere mix and on the side: aioli, onion, lettuce and finely slices spicy pepper.---Brussels sprouts fried rice, Poached farm egg and sunchockes -$29Was able to try a bite of this as well and it was certainly interesting, a medley of flavors and very complex.We were ogling at the desserts around us (cookie plate & beignets) but just couldn't think of eating more. Well done Gramercy Tavern. Well done!!!",4,,
130,Sherica L.,"San Francisco, CA",236,73,222,4.0,4/26/2017,"Gramercy was hands down superb. We made reservations via open table and came during lunch on a weekday. The restaurant was not very packed and was very spacious. We ordered the ruby red shrimp and the beef tartare as the first course and the lamb (rare) and chicken and maitake mushrooms as the second course. Everything was superb! The chicken may have been the most perfectly executed chicken I've had in awhile. It was perfectly prepared, cooked through, but extremely tender. The juicy maitake mushrooms complimented well with the rest of the dish and the wine sauce that was drizzled over the entire dish was superb. We'll definitely be back for the chef tasting!If you are on a budget, I recommend choosing individual dishes from the menu. The lunch seasonal tasting was $98, but doing a two course meal from the menu was about the $60 per person. I love, love the fact that service is included in the price. There is no surprises at the end of the meal when we get the bill. The only thing you would have to account for is tax.",1,,1
131,Thomas V.,"Manhattan, NY",78,58,40,5.0,3/20/2018,"It may not be on many lists of best burgers in NYC, and they may be better known for their fine-dining experience, but their burger is my favorite in the city.A couple things to note right off the bat.  The burger is of limited supply everyday; I don't know how many they make a day but they reportedly run out by evening time (it's not as limited as Raoul's 10 burgers a day).  I've always been fortunate enough to always get one on each trip, and I always go a little after lunch time around 2-3pm.Another thing to note, their burger toppings are seasonal.  On the first visit, their toppings (from what I remember) were a combination of lettuce, soured green pickles and onions.  This is the burger that made me elevate them to the top of my list.  Though their toppings may change depending on the time of year,  the quality of the meat patty doesn't.  It's a thick piece of fresh, locally raised organic beef.  Have had several other variations with different toppings, some good to very good, but the patty is what makes it the best in my opinion.  I rate it a hair above Raouls as my personal favorite in the city, though I know it may not be as universally appealing to others (especially given what toppings they have that season), but Raouls doesn't top my first ever experience at Gramercy.  So I have to give it to Gramercy.How does it rate for me compared to other city's best?  I can't say it tops Fathers Office in LA or Au Cheval in Chicago, but I would put it over Spruce in San Francsico and Quinn's in Seattle.Yes, it is quite pricey but it is one of a kind in the city so by default it is worth it.FYI here is my own personal rating system and ranking list of some other burger places in NYC5=worth a trip, something you'll crave4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space1=the place should shut downThe places are listed as best/better first if they share the same rating (I.e.

It can be both CASUAL or FORMAL depending on how you feel like that day.So this place has two restaurants: The Tavern: (walk in only)Casual, a great place to bring your date to. They have great selections of wine and beer, most of them are available in half glass, so you can really taste a lot of different kinds of drinks without breaking your bank. They have some great burger that is not on the menu, and I especially like the apple tart dessertThe Dining Room: (Michelin one star)I've tried their dinner tasting menu. Just WOW! I am not sure if it's the wine (we ordered 4 bottles for the 6 of us), but everything tasted amazing. I have been to almost half of the Michelin one star restaurants in NYC and I will put Gramercy Tavern as #1. The service was amazing and the staffs are knowledgeable about the dishes. I will definitely come back again when the new tasting menu is up!Tips:+ the Tavern has some amazing desserts, good for people who just want to have an afternoon tea+ order half glasses (they are generous on their pour), try different things+ they have roasted oysters at the Tavern, amazing!",11,,2
134,Deb R.,"Great Barrington, MA",12,63,2,4.0,9/11/2018,"I realize that I mostly use Yelp to send bad reviews so I wanted to add a positive one.  This place is great - expensive but worth it.  The bar is pleasant, the dining room is large, and noisy (like most Manhattan restaurants) but not so noisy you can't hear your dinner companions.  It seems warm and welcoming.  They have a no-tipping philosophy, which is interesting, and they must reward the staff because all staff was friendly and helpful.  Our waiters were there when we needed something but not hovering.  Delightful.   The evening starts with a small amuse-Bouche.  Ours was a watermelon gazpacho, refreshing and delicious.  The rolls that came were light, fluffy and warm, served with goat cheese butter.  Yummy. We had the tagliatelle, it came bathed in a creamy sauce with just a hint of warm spices and small bits of bacon and summer squash.  The main course of flounder was cooked to flaky perfection with a crispy golden coat.   The fish was accompanied by fresh corn and tiny tomatoes, a delicious end-of-summer combination.  Dessert was a huge serving of fruit - tiny strawberrries, fresh peaches, a scoop of sorbet and a bit of rice pudding.  All was delicious.  The wine list seems expensive, but then we remember the no tipping, and it lines up with other fine dining restaurants in NYC.So - save up and go, it is worth the tab.. .",,,

Exquisite food, wonderful service, and a rustic ambiance make this one of my new favorite restaurants in NYC.We came to Gramercy Tavern as a party of 7. Originally I had made it for 6 people and added 7 at the last moment. I was worried that they would be unable to accommodate  our last minute change but they were able to increase our table size.I was also worried due to the fact that we were such a large party, and we had a special cake that we wanted to present at the end of the evening, that things might not go entirely as planned. Side note, the last time that I had a special ""surprise"" cake that I wanted to present at the end of the dinner, our waiter (at another restaurant) walked right up to the host of the evening (who the cake was for) and asked ""when would you like your cake to come out"" when uh...it was supposed to be a surprise. Yikes! We were nervous to say the least.We all started with cocktails and champagne and the entire table opted for the seasonal tasting menu which had several courses (6-8 perhaps). The wait staff was on point. They all assembled at the table together to remove dishes as well as to bring new items. They did not interrupt your conversation which I really liked as there's nothing I can't stand more than being in the middle of a story and someone butting in with ""would you like still or flat water?"" Just give everyone a minute to settle in and look at everything! That, they did. I was impressed. I would describe it as overly attentive without you even noticing.The food was just, you have to try it for yourself. Definitely opt for the larger tasting course menu as there are some real gems on there. I don't want to go into the food too much to ruin anything but honestly everything was out of this world. On par (or even better) than a lot of the 3-star Michelin restaurants in NYC.The cake event went on flawlessly as they brought the cake in its entirety on a beautiful raised plate so our guest could see it (as it actually had her photo on it) and then they cut the pieces up and brought everyone a piece (and the guest was given the ""face"" cut-out from her cake, it was very cute). There also was no cake fee which I was shocked by. Usually places charge around $8 a person to cut and serve the cake. I find that ridiculous and sometimes it deters us from certain restaurants.I really enjoyed our time at Gramercy Tavern and want to go back. I felt like for the price and the quality of food, it was well worth it.",23,7,18
137,Maggie L.,"New York, NY",281,84,199,5.0,2/23/2018,"Came for dinner on my birthday and had a wonderful experience. Dining experiences are formed by environment to service/small details and of course the food -- Gramercy Tavern hits all the spots in the best way possible. There is an interesting contrast between the tavern and dining room, making the setting less tense and more relaxed but still classy. Compared to other upscale restaurants, it is less pretentious and more inviting. Customer service was impeccable, informative without being condescending and engaging without being uncomfortable. Onto the food itself... there was nothing I did not like. Opted for the three course meal and it was surprisingly VERY filling. Everything had it's own unique flavor profile and made for an adventurous experience. First course of beef tartare and ruby red shrimps were light and made me eager to try more food from here. Beef was explosive with flavor, though raw meat is not my thing in general. Shrimps were so succulent and paired well with the potatoes. Second course of sea bass and pork loin/belly were filling and delicious. Sea bass was fresh and paired with clams/chorizo, but the pork was so, so good. Pork three ways ensured different flavors and textures, and the meat was juicy and tender. Dessert of baklava and cookie plate were presented beautifully and we couldn't even finish! Also the complimentary birthday cake was such a nice and sweet touch! Did I mention they also give you granola bars for breakfast? Such an amazing place and it made the night so much better.

138,Luciana C.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",148,23,115,5.0,1/1/2018,"Over this weekend, we visited Gramercy Tavern. It was Thursday night and we luckily got a 5:15 reservation the day of. On our way to the restaurant, we hit traffic and knew we were going to be late and when a Gramercy representative called to confirm our reservation, she immediately pushed our reservation back for us.Upon arrival we were immediately seated in the Dining Room. We both chose the seasonal Vegetable Tasting ($159). Having dined in the Dining Room once before, I had very high expectations for this meal as they were set this way from my previous experience. I ordered the Kombucha Flight which was an assortment of beet, apple, and pumpkin spiced kombuchas ($16). All were delicious and it was fun to see which paired with each course the best. The angel biscuits and goat cheese butter that is brought out to the table is mind blowing. The everything seasoning on the butter is next level and the biscuits are pillowy and extremely addictive.We were greeted with a shot of warm cabbage broth with a romano cheese foam. This may sound strange, but after coming inside from a 4 degree winter night this warm, savory soup was comforting and just what was needed. Our courses went as followed:1. Chestnut Pudding with Hazelnuts, Sunchokes, Pickled Apple - creamy, salty, and savory and was cut perfectly with the tart apple. (8/10)2. Cauliflower and Burrata with Anchovy, Capers, and Sunflower Seeds - one of the best bites all night. Fresh, creamy burrata paired with the crunchiness of the roasted cauliflower and briny capers that were cut by the sweetness of the raisins. (10/10)3. Roasted Delicata Squash with Chicories, Pecans, and Pears - Simple but still delicious. Tender squash and large, juicy pieces of pear. (8/10)4. Parsnip Agnolotti with Charred Onions, Maitake Mushrooms, and Grana Padano - Best pasta I have ever eaten. Hot broth is poured tableside. Umami flavors of the mushrooms, savory yet sweet taste of the onion, and the homemade pastas bursted with creamy, cheesy parsnip filling. (10/10)5. Forono Beets with Quinoa, Black Garlic, and Mustard Greens - Not the biggest beet fan but if you like beets you will love this. The beets went with a risotto-like quinoa that had a nice garlic flavor and was lightened by the greens. (7/10)Between courses, we were given another round of bread. We noticed a different, orange hued bread in the hands of a waiter and out of curiosity we asked to find out that it was their gluten free bread offering. They brought us our own warm, sweet and salty bread with pepitas. Both breads were delicious. A ""palette cleanser"" course was brought to the table in between our last course and dessert -- it was a tangerine sorbet with feta cheese. The strange combination worked very well and it was a refreshing bite to start the dessert. Since we both wanted the Vegetable Tasting, I requested the Gramercy Cookie Plate rather than the Goats Milk Cheesecake with Sorghum Cookie, Fermented Honey, and Concord Grape Sorbet so that we can sample both desserts. The Cookie Plate was filled with holiday cookies -- each was better than the next. My favorite is the warm chocolate chip sea salt cookie. The cheesecake was also delicious, it was sweet but not overpowering with the goat's milk flavor and the concord grape sorbet was a perfect addition. The dinner was finalized with petit fours of a spicy praline truffle and a peanut butter and jelly bonbon. The PB & J bonbon was one of the best chocolates I ever had. You are given a chocolate coated granola bar upon departure, just another little touch that makes this restaurant so special. The amount of flavors and tastes provided in one meal is uncomparable, and my expectations were blown away even after eating here before. The kind hospitality of the servers and the warm, welcoming ambience are a combination that makes Gramercy Tavern a restaurant like no other. If you are in NYC, this restaurant is worth the splurge!",,,
139,Natasha R.,"Montreal, Canada",29,43,2,3.0,9/7/2017,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed with my dining experience here. Our reservation was for 8:30pm in the dining room  and from the moment we arrived we felt rushed. E.g. the wait staff kept refilling our wine glasses so quickly I thought they must be trying to get us out quick so they could fit 3 services into a night. However,the food was good. I had tomato salad (which was the best part of the meal), lamb loin and chocolate dessert. All very yummy but nothing blew me away. Perhaps I ordered wrong? My husband loved the ravioli starter and his Raspberry dessert. The main (pork loin & belly) was good but not great. The ambiance is typical of a fast paced bistro. Nothing special. Perhaps because Montréal has such great bistros I expected more. If you are ever in Montréal check out Montreal Plaza, L'express or Lemeac for great ambiance for this style of restaurant.Overall the dining experience was over shadowed by the rushed service and average atmosphere.  Our bill was more than $450 USD for 2 prix fixe with cocktail and a bottle of wine. This is a no tipping restaurant.",3,,
140,Evan H.,"New York, NY",314,781,44,5.0,5/16/2018,"Danny Meyer's crown jewel still is inventive and delicious, nearly 25 years after it opened. We all know about his restaurant empire, and we all know he prides himself on offering great service, but of all his restaurants, and i've been to a lot, this was probably the best service of any of them.For those who don't know, GT has two sections. The tavern and bar area in front that doesn't take reservations. Then there is a fancy area in back, that requires a res, and they can be hard-ish to get for a prime time.I can only speak to the main dining area. I came here with my in-laws and wife to celebrate her graduation. I also informed them upon making my reservation about a dietary restriction, and even after we changed tables, they knew exactly what they were. The waitress was friendly, super knowledgeable about wines and answered every question we had for her. The two dining options are the tasting menu or the 3 course menu. If you are really going all out, do the tasting menu, you will not regret it. It comes in at about $180, tip included. So it's not cheap, but for what you get, it's a really incredible unforgettable meal. While you'll likely have a different menu when you come, it seems pointless to go through each dish. However, I will say that if you have the chance to get the Pork belly/loin or the duck, do it, they're subperb. While some tasting menus leave you either stuffed or still hungry, they struck the perfect balance. The wine list here is long, like War and Peace, though I suspect far more enjoyable. They have wines for the moderate buyer ($75-100 and the Wall Street broker ($500-$1,000).If you are worried or don't think that this place still has it, you'd be wrong. They still pump out excellent food, in a goregous restaurant setting with service that will make you smile.",,,
141,Erin G.,"El Cerrito, CA",516,624,2586,5.0,10/25/2017,"What I ate: Three course prix fixeVisit date: October 16, 2017First time? Yes. Gramery Tavern was definitely a highlight from my NY trip. The service was impeccable (you know you're at a legit classy restaurant when they fold your napkins if you leave your table for a minute), but also not stuffy. There is a coat check if you need it, and any leftover 'ok-to-package' desserts will be waiting for you wrapped up upon your exit from the restaurant. There is a three-course option and a seven course meal with optional wine pairings. Their only ask is that everyone at your table order either the three- or the seven- course meal because of the timing of the dishes. On this visit we enjoyed the three course prix fixe meal and the restaurant kept us on track so we would have plenty of time to head over to see a show. Our meal started with an amuse bouche of biscuits with goat milk butter and cabbage salad. I started with the ricotta cavatelli which had creamy noodles with a beef bolognese, black olives, and pickled peppers. It was a bit on the salty side, but I ate the whole thing because, mmm, salt. Also, I love beef bolognese! My main course was the arctic char served medium well with celery root, quince, and delicately-placed Brussels sprouts leaves. They give you a hearty portion of salmon; I would have liked more of the accompanying items on my plate. The star of the dish: the salmon skin. It was perfectly crisp and salty. For dessert I had a trio of sorbets - raspberry, strawberry, and concord grape. They were served on a bed of cookies. Each flavor was vibrant and refreshing, but also very sweet. I also had a ginger swizzle and hot mint tea to wash down all the good food. To finish, our meal came with petit fours - two kinds of chocolatey bon bons. One was reminiscent of a PB&J and the other had fantastic crisps inside. We also were given a special Gramercy Tavern granola bar for later. My friend had the butternut squash soup, pork loin & belly, and cookie plate. She loved everything and even got to take home the leftover cookies.  This is a great place to celebrate a milestone occasion or for a just-because night out. Let them know if you're celebrating a birthday, too - they give you a mini cake!",,1,1

The place was crowded as any other night and we were able to get a table with no reservations in 20 minutes.I ordered the Quiona Salad, followed by Smoked Artic Char, and finished with peach sorbet to try a multitude of flavors.

A week prior to our reservation I rec'd an email confirming the date and time, as well as requesting information on specific food allergies or special occasion. In addition, I was also contacted via phone two days prior, to see if I would like an earlier time in the instance a table opened up. The customer service both pre and post dining experience at Gramercy, has been top notch. The service during the meal was very good, but not great. There were a few times where our glasses were empty and we were searching for our waiter to order another round of cocktails. But the timing of the plates was perfect. We had the seasonal tasting menu and were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne. Each course was both aesthetically and palatably pleasing.This is one of the least pretentious Michelin restaurants I've been too. The decor is classy and the ambience created by the clientele is high-end, but not snooty. Come dine in your business casual attire and you'll fit right in. The crowd is diverse in every way and you can feel the light aura and energy in the air here.In addition to the very affordably priced tasting menu, the restaurant is also a non-tipping establishment; the tip is included in your menu pricing. Initially I would give Gramercy a solid 4.5 stars, but this added bonus pushed me over to the 5 star mark. I definitely recommend GT and I will definitely plan on coming back.",3,,2

The service is formal but not fuzzy, and they treat us like regular customers despite the fact that it was our first time dining there. We were directed to the bar to wait (we were early) and I enjoyed a perfect Manhattan in Manhattan. The bar staff obviously know their stuff.We sat in the dining room during lunch time and enjoyed dishes from both the tavern menu and the main menu, a la carte style. Standout dishes include the lamb tartare from the tavern menu, the pea shoot salad with arctic char, the lamb merguez and the pork schnitzel. The meal was not cheap, but imminently reasonable considering the location (NYC), the caliber of the food and service (this place deserves more than 1 Michelin star), and the pricing policy (service included to provide the staff a decent wage).Definitely a 5 star meal and deserves all the accolades.",,,

Updated review","As always, the team at Gramercy Tavern is magnificent.  I can't imagine how difficult it is to maintain such incredible standards for quality in your service, decor, food, cocktails and, most importantly, the overall quality of the experience for 25 years.From the moment we were greeted (acknowledged it was our anniversary) to be seated at the same table we magically get during each of our visits, the experience is perfect.  We come to Gramercy Tavern with enormously high expectations, and every time we leave somehow surprised that the team finds a way to raise the bar.My wife and I both had tasting menus.  The level of creativity and presentation that goes into these unique dishes wowed us.  The staff works in teams and it appeared that each of the close to 10 people that had a role in serving us knew what we had ordered and which of the seven courses we were about to receive.It's worth noting that I talked with a couple of other diners as I left the restaurant.  They too were repeat visitors and they felt similarly.  Can't wait to go back!",,,
149,Greg T.,"Kiefer, OK",2,6,14,5.0,4/11/2018,This place is elegant. The staff waits on you very well and the food is prepared with excellence. I recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a romantic spot or a quiet place to eat.,1,,
150,Benjamin F.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,16,33,5.0,11/15/2017,"Wow! Just wow. We got there early before our reservation and had a drink at the bar. I would definitely recommend getting there early and getting a drink beforehand. The bar gets crowded and the seats are usually reserved but was fun to hang and take in the aesthetic of the restaurant before our meal. The food was absolutely unreal and our waiter was super nice and on point. Got three course set meal. Definitely recommend going that route. Only thing was toward the end after our cheese plate before the dessert we waited 30min to be served dessert. Not sure what the hold up was but definitely was a little confused as to why we waited so long for the dessert after the flow of the rest of the meal was perfection. Regardless, don't let this steer you away. This place is a pure treat!!",,,
151,Liliana P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,0,5.0,11/15/2018,"In a roll-call of New York's most beloved restaurants of the last couple of decades, Gramercy Tavern would be high on many people's list. It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people. You'll probably leave happy whether you've come on a date or are here to impress the in-laws; whether you're closing a deal or simply lubricating the thought processes behind a deal. The ""Tavern"" side is the prized spot for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar--it doesn't take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up ""I'm not really queuing, I'm just standing here"" queue outside. The ""Dining Room"" is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is creative American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it the sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence and dexterity of this kitchen.",,,

It's one of those places that no matter when you come and no matter what you get, you're likely to be delighted by both the incredible food and the incredible service.The tasting menu in the main dining room mostly speaks for itself, but I do think it's somewhat underrated -- it's both cheaper and better than many of the other fine dining places in the city. The tavern is probably even more of a hidden gem though -- in my opinion, their burger is the best I've ever had, and their weekly soup & sandwich combo is always outstanding.Can't recommend this place enough.",2,,1

The tavern is smaller but you wont need a res to get a seat here. We waited about 20 minutes on a friday night :) You will need a res for the dining room and they were booked for the month when i called. The tavern and the dining room will have different menus.

Duck Andouille, Caraflex Cabbage, Apples and Hot Sauce 29-- My tastebuds ""apple-y"" enjoyed this dish.  This dish was actually my favorite dish. It was soo good. GET THIS. Grilled Lamb, Green Garlic Butter and Market Greens 35-- Oh my ""Lamb-ta!"" this was amazing. You need to get this. So tender and flavored perfectly. Sea Bass, Smoked Potatoes, Fennel Gremolata and Shell Beans 30-- this was one of the ""bass"" ive ever had. So flakey. Perfectly cooked. This place is so good. You need to come here.

I tried another restaurant first but they told us it was impossible to get a table, then we decided to go to Gramercy Tavern and try to get a table.As soon as we got there we saw it was a full house and we were expecting to be sent away. However, the maitre'D was extremely welcoming and told us very nicely that it would take a while for a table (about 40 min to a hour) but we could wait having a drink at the bar, and so we did. Even with a full house there was no shortage in hospitality. The staff was amazing and we got drinks fairly soon.After a while we got a table, and he gave us a really nice one close to the window. Our server was extremely nice and knowledgeable about wine and the menu.For our first course we got the seafood tower which has at least 6 samples of seafood dishes. The ceviche was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, delicate, and elegant. There was a lobster salad which was very flavorful, the oysters were super fresh, we loved it!For my second course I had the goat meatballs which were rich in flavor and was perfectly paired with a greek wine. And the apple crumble and vanilla ice-cream for dessert was the perfect ending. I would definitely go back!",,,

Five Guys, Fast food or some pub burger, it was going to happen. I saw Gramercy on my bookmarks and I remembered reading about this off-menu burger.. THE DILEMMAEvery morning, Gramercy inspects their wagyu and decides to make a burger or a philly. Today, they did a philly.. A bit disappointed, I said ok; however, my feeble mind was clearly not expecting this avalanche of flavorWAGYU PHILLYMy God. I looked, perplexed, at little strips of beef nestling an amusing cheese foam. This is going to let me down, I thought. Grabbed the tomato lettuce parts and did a Ford assembly line crafting this giant, sliced, took a bite. And screamed on the inside.HOLD ME BACK..I can't tell you HOW MUCH FLAVOR is in this. I could only taste it. The marbling and fat in the wagyu had such a real depth, umami, delicious, jaw-dropping, crazy good, someone give me a thesaurus, mind blowing FLAVOR. It was SO SATISFYING and I felt so content. A must for anyone who appreciates burgers ($26)In my top 10 burgers, Cannot WAIT to go back and try the regular Wagyu.

But more than anything, it's the people - and this was one of the best service experiences we have ever had.

The flavor combinations are out of this world and are balanced perfectly. I can honestly say 3 of the top 5 meals I have ever had were here at Gramercy. Also, the cocktails are complex and delicious, and are always made with such care.What stands out to me the most is the level of professionalism and knowledge of the staff. Any questions regarding the food or cocktails is answered with exquisite detail. On top of that, the staff here is so welcoming, engaging and friendly, and every time I visit, I feel as if I am at home. I can personally vouch for the services of the bartenders Siobhan, Ali, Victoria, and Mark, and the servers Christina and Rob.

There is no line to add a tip which would be ""respectfully declined"".On to the food:- Marinated Scallops with Riesling - excellent preparation, super fresh, even my wife who doesn't like raw food gobbled it down.-  Arctic Char with Fumin Blanc. The BOMB! Incredibly subtle in taste and perfectly poached (?), for me it was the best course. I never imagined it tasting like this. The texture was heaven.- Squid Ink Pasta with lobster and Chorizo, Nero d'Avola. Very hearty, satisfying savory dish. It has everything one could ask for.- Duck Breast with Tempranillo - very good, I wished the skin was crispy but still it was an excellent dish, wine pairing was spot on.- Frozen Chocolate Pudding with Porto - I'm not much of a dessert person but it certainly ended the feast well.Service was very professional, the wine pairings were superb and the setting was very nice, lots of beautiful space, bathroom was clean and modern.They went out of the way to accommodate my son, who is allergic to nuts by creating a dessert for him that was actually better than the rest of the table. No tip accepted at the coat check - all service is included. I like that, hopefully it means the staff is being paid a decent, living wage.Chatted with one of the managers about the menu, when it changes and he stated they are flexible, the kitchen can make smaller portions of the a la carte entries to substitute for the standard tasting menu.

I came here with no expectations but had heard nothing but raving reviews from friends. Came here on a weekday and put my name down - wait was about ~2hours but they will text you so you can grab drinks elsewhere then come. They also have a private room for special events. They have a tavern and living room area. The living room area is pre fix I believe and reservations are booked out for months. I got seated in the tavern and it was still really charming! I love love the ambiance, service, and FOOD.Okay now onto the best part- FOODOrdered the clam flatbread- AMAZING, seriously every single bite I was getting sad that it was disappearing. So crisp and flavorful but not like too salty or anything. Best app for sure!! The Radicchio & Grilled Bacon Salad, Apples and Red Eye Gravy was really fresh and delicious as well. You CANNOT go wrong with any dish honestly. Next time I would def try the cheese.For my entree I got the meatballs. Juicy and great sauce. The sea bass is also REALLY GOOD. I would recommend trying the sea bass. It doesn't look as tasty but once you bite into it- OMG! I really did not think the food could get better after eating the apps but then the entrees blew my mind. The service is excellent- they also keep your water full and ask if you want any drinks. For dessert I got the Cookies & Cream Sundae, Chocolate Cookie Crumble and Sherry Sauce - BEST ICE CREAM IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. SERIOUSLY! If they sold their own cookie and cream ice cream 10/10 I would buy. For drinks I recommend- JALISCO PEAR- pear alcohol drink- really tasty! The place is worth the $$$$. I'm coming back asap.

169,Nick L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,224,0,5.0,7/16/2017,"This review is strictly for the ""Tavern"" portion of this restaurant.After an early start and a ton of walking, Gramercy Tavern was all the lunch that we'd earned. We walked in around the time that they opened for lunch service, and within 30 minutes, the tables at the Tavern area were filled with people. I'd come here to try their burger, which is made in limited quantities for both lunch and dinner. Beside the fact that I was starving, I was looking to be blown away based on what I had read.They started us off with their cheese bread, which was actually very cheesy and soft. I would have preferred that it was warm, but I made an exception here because it was just so damn incredible. This really set the tone of our meal and I'm pleased to say that the meal got better and better from here on out (which can't be said for a lot of places).Gramercy Tavern Burger - Among the best burgers I've had to date. The fat content of that patty was oozing with juices and flavor, cooked to a perfected medium rare. The meat mix imparted just so much flavor, and the cheese, tomato and lettuce were perfect complements. An unreal bite of food. The accompanying chips were crunchy, tasty and above all, not greasy. After you order this burger I recommend that you google a video about how they prepare the burger-- it'll all make sense.Pork Belly Fried Rice - This was a very generous portion. The quality of the pork belly is top notch and it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The fried rice had a good body of flavor and was not overly greasy. The chili sauce that it was paired with provided a healthy amount of heat. The service here was nothing short of amazing and attentive. I'm always appreciative when I do not have to ask for my water to be refilled, or have to seek a waiter to ask a question. I also love the fact that Gramercy Tavern is a non-tipping restaurant. What you see on the bill is what you pay, and you don't have to fuss over calculating a tip of any kind. In my opinion, they overcome the negatives of being non-tipping: They may work gratuity into the price of the food (which itself is very good) and the service here is top notch. In short, I would have tipped them that amount anyway. Gramercy Tavern is a place to get a fantastic, no fuss meal.",2,,

172,Jay K.,"New York, NY",31,174,139,5.0,7/8/2017,"The decor, food, and servers was beyond exceptional. Had dinner here with two friends and everything was phenomenal. They only offer their original pre-fix or seasonal pre-fix menu; no a la carte here, unless you're at the tavern section. Our cocktails and champagne was spectacular(they have an extended wine/champagne list). All of us thought that the service was impeccable and super attentive without interrupting our conversations. We had two servers handling our table.Definitely an experience and highly recommend to anyone if you're looking for a classy night out to dress up and have an intimate friend gathering or a romantic dinner date.",2,,
173,Sharon L.,"Melbourne, FL",322,201,215,5.0,1/4/2017,"This dining experience was probably one of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to order from the tasting menu, since my group decided they didn't want to partake, but the 3 course entrees still blew me away.To start, I ordered the corn and crab salad. The crab was cooked perfectly and the corn was roasted to perfection. It had the perfect crunch and it was the perfect combination of flavors. Next, I ordered the sea bass with the red pepper sauce. The sauce was more of a soup-like consistency, but nevertheless, absolutely amazing. The shishito peppers as a garnish were the cherry on top. Lastly, I ended with the pavlova with mango sorbet. This was pretty good. I personally prefer a merengue that is crunchy on the outside, but a little softer on the inside, but this was a little hard all around, but the softness of the mango sorbet was able to balance out the textures. Overall, the dessert had great flavor components.",1,2,1

There was no pressure to order excessive amounts of food, like at other restaurants. Food was generally good- mom had the lamb and I had the sea bass. However, there was excessive time between courses with no food at times. My desert was also very bizarre- I got this corn cake with corn ice cream and blue berries.

178,James N.,"Westhampton, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/12/2018,Last night I was a guest at a table for 6 and came away very disappointed as I was from two prior visits. I can't help but compare it to a wonderful meal I had recently at the Union Square Cafe. The highlight last night was  the Sommelier who  was very helpful. We had a wonderful rose champagne and then a super tuscan that was delicious.The good news ends there. I find the staff abrupt and condescending from the waiter warning us that we all had to select the three  course or seven course menu in the most unfriendly way to the coat check person who refused my help with six umbrellas but then couldn't find them. The kale salad was too salty as was the lobster broth surrounding the fish entree. My smoked trout was flavorless. I think it was intended to be a presentation of subtle flavors but it didn't work as there was nothing to distinguish it. The papardelle ragu was tasty but too watery. The other dishes were fine and the desserts very well done. For $1500 I expected to be impressed,,,
179,Samatha T.,"Miami, FL",0,80,12,1.0,12/19/2017,"This was the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced in a restaurant. The only reason you don't see bad reviews is because at the hint of a complaint they comped my whole meal, wine and all. I debated leaving this review a thousand times but in the end, this dinner was not only on the kickoff of my NYC honeymoon it was our first time in the city period. Numerous awards and the recommendation of AMEX platinum services said that this was in the top 5 of NYC restaurants and my own research confirmed this. I'm pretty AMEX is the way they pack this restaurant because there is absolutely no way in our experience that this was any where near the expectation of the anticipated hype. The only thing that was decent was the actual service but for this price point you would expect that.Let's begin, the bread was served (1 each) Luke warm, not warm at all. It was a kind of sour dough variety that was missing any sort of flavor. For the first course we decided on the cavatelli  pasta. We found that this dish was also not served hot which really bothered us to start. It was overwhelmingly doused with truffle oil which ruined the dish completely making it almost inedible. For the main course I decided on the striped bass and my wife ordered the salmon. The salmon lacked any real flavor and honestly I have had better fish in chain restaurants. She reluctantly ate most of hers. I had the striped bass. When I stuck my fork in it I was expecting a flaky fish but instead found not get the piece by itself without the assistance of a knife. It was awful! Not only the worst tasting fish I had ever had but not well seasoned with hints of a fishy odor. I was pretty infuriated at this point and picked the whole fish up with my fork and tried to pry another part undone just to reconfirm I was not going crazy and sure enough, intact to the fork it stayed. At this point, I consulted with my wife and she agreed I should say something. I was embarrassed because I have not complained about a meal in years, especially a meal at a restaurant with such accolades. Infuriated I had informed the waitress that the fish was inedible and she offered me something else. It was so bad that all I wanted was to get the check and leave, I never asked for anything for free, I just wanted to get out of there and get on with our honeymoon and past this experience. A few moments later the General Manager STEPHANIE, I believe, came over and I explained what was wrong. She was professional and polite and apologized. She offered us our dessert and the meal and drinks on the house. She also offered us to come back and try again even though the only chance of this would be if he'll froze over. I almost refused the dessert but since we heard the pastry chef had received a James beard award we figured why not. I forgot exactly what me and my wife ordered but I can tell you it was absolutely disgusting! Mine had blue cheese flavored icing or whip cream and hers had a pear in it that was hard. No exaggeration, we both simultaneously spit out our first dessert bite back in to the dish. I was so relieved that my wife had such a bad experience to further prove I wasn't losing my mind. I know that sounds crazy but there are so many awards, history and good reviews here. Now like I said, customer service, service in general were great but I would not go back if Michael Anthony himself called me on the telephone to do a private tasting with he and his wife. The positive: aside from this experience in New York, the rest of my 10 day culinary experience in the big apple was a major success. So many great Italian restaurants, pizza, Asian, French and steakhouses were out of this world amazing.",1,2,1
180,Janet J.,"New York, NY",332,204,380,5.0,6/6/2017,"One of the best American style restaurants in NYC. Great place for dates, girls night outs, to get drinks at the bar. Gramercy Tavern is a no tipping restaurant. You like nice restaurants, but are turned off by the bougie-ness, then Gramercy Tavern is for you. Unassuming staff, memorable food, and beautiful interior design with super pretty flowers all around the restaurant. Check, check and check. Two areas to dine: tavern and main dining room. Tavern is more casual and has more bar-type food. I heard the burger is great. We got a la carte lunch at the main dining room. We were debating between a la carte vs. tasting menu but we opted to get individual dishes because we wanted to try the pork loin dish. *Pork loin and deckle: omg this was beyond great. The pork was super tender and flavorful. Usually, pork dishes can be very salty and the meat is firm. But Gramercy executed this dish perfectly. The rhubarb definitely upgrades this dish to the next level. Recommend this. *Black bass: pretty good, but our hearts were distracted by the pork loin. Fish was cooked perfectly, I wish the flavor was a bit stronger. A bit bland, but still very tasty. If you want to impress your lady friend, make reservations and she will love it, I promise!",2,1,1

My wife and my in-laws couldn't stop raving about this place before we went, and now I see why. It's top-notch, and one of the best places I've gone in NYC. The service was five-stars as well.

Updated review","Came here for the second time because the food is so good. Went for the lunch chefs tasting menu and it was probably the best meal I've ever had. Almost everything is amazing there. There was some sort of complimentary beet sorbet with goat cheese that was not good... but everything else was so divine. We asked to substitute the pear desert for the goats milk cheese cake (I had this last time and started crying it was so good) and it was amazing! The staff is so nice and professional, they really make you feel special. It was my boyfriends and I third year anniversary and they gave us complimentary champagne and a free desert. The tasting menu for lunch was amazing and I'd totally recommend  it!",,,

My favorite dish was sea bream with a lovely butter sauce finished with pumpkin seeds.  We also had a wonderful scallop ceviche with white balsamic vinagre and cilantro oil. This dish began the tasting menu and was Also spectacular. To accompany the wonderful food we had amazing service. Hands down a great experience for our anniversary dinner.,,,

195,Carle K.,"Fairfax, VA",0,20,33,5.0,2/24/2018,"Came here to dine at the Tavern bar so we could specifically have their famous burger. It was worth all the hype and more. The burger was incredibly juicy and cooked perfectly. The bun looked like it would be really dry but it had just the right amount of squeeze and moisture. The sauce they serve with the burger stole the show. It had a great acidity and savoriness to it which paired great with the fatty burger. In previous reviews people said the burger was huge and to share which I did with my husband but it wasn't too large at all and we probably could have each had one easily. The ginger swizzle mocktail was divine! Our $17 apple salad was tasty but nothing to rave about and overpriced for the 4 bites small portion, which is expected from a fine dining establishment.",,,

The restrooms were clean and pleasant. The restaurant is positioned through the bar and towards the back of the restaurant. The decor was interesting. I hear that the restaurant changes the decor often throughout the year. Should be pleasant to see what changes when I return in the spring. The food was wonderful, presented very beautifully. The flavors were ample and the meat was tender. The clearing of the table and the delivery of each course of our meal was done efficiently with a team of servers.

Somewhat decadent for my everyday taste, but with a homey sort of softness to it. Plus, it's that kind of an experience. You feel like you've gone somewhere special.I still remember our server David. He was really incredible- friendly, hospitable, knowledgable, attentive, efficient. He let us taste a few wines before we chose a bottle- an Austrian Gruner. Crisp and delicious, and he assured us it would go well with our meal.Which it certainly did. My entree was the bass- deliciously cooked, flaky and juicy. I loved the celery root and wild rice on the side. My boyfriend got the striped bass, which was also delicious. I particularly liked the clams and chorizo that it came with.After our meal, we enjoyed espresso and some sorbets which were so yummy. When we asked for our bill, we were shocked to see that Gramercy Tavern Gratuity Free. Crazy- just when you get a great server, have an amazing experience, and you want to reward him----- it's impossible.We took the time to thank David for his hospitality, and left very satisfied.",1,,
