Make sure to reserve a table/seating area because there is literally nowhere to sit if you dont have a reserved area.Saturday night entry as a birthday party guest included 2 free drink tickets for house liquor which were good for use until midnight. A Hennessy neat and a Captain Morgan with coca cola came to $35 with tip already included.No need to dress nicely. I saw both men and women wearing work boots, sneakers, and the most interesting outfits (body suit with a mesh skirt and keds!) all on a Saturday night.This is a great place to celebrate for someone in the 21-29 age range and the idea of popping bottles excites you. Or if you're in the 29-40 age bracket and you want a flashback to when you were 21-29, this is your spot.The wooden floor can be slippery at first if you're wearing stilettos or pumps, but after being doused in the alcohol that people will spill, you will be fine.  They did make an attempt to keep the floor clean though.Bathrooms are all the way to the rear by the exit sign. Great mirror is available in the ladies room, and the place itself was pretty clean considering.The staff was composed of some curt characters but overall everyone was nice. The table service was very accommodating and available. I cannot truly comment on the value of pricing as someone else was footing the bill.Hookahs were quoted at $40, if that is your thing. If you purchase a birthday package it ends up being a better price and does include a lot from what I observed. The DJ was pretty good and played a bit of everything in a way that kept everyone moving. The coat check at the end of the night was great. The young lady working the coat check was quick and efficient (she wanted to go home too).It's not my kind of party but it may do for you.",13
1,,11/18/2018,0,,"Bronx, NY",Sara R.,0,1.0,3,truth be told about this establishment is. if you are not flashy about your money and how you look I promise they will give you a hard time. I actually came here with my girls last night and heard that music here is good. which is true! we all looked amazing and once we got there. there was a line. I did rsvp for me and my ladies and told the security staff that I am waiting for the host of the night to arrive because I am apart of his crew. they honest to god thought I was bullshiting. they wanted me to pay 40$!!!!!!! to get inside. made me wait on the line anyways. idk how grown people think it's cute to wait on a line for more than 30 mins. it was such a beautiful feeling walking in with the host of the night and seeing their faces lol. do not waste your time. there's plenty of other places in new york city that are way cheaper with more space and play the same music. I don't ever write reviews but don't waste your time!!!!taj is worried about money clearly. never the clientel. but one positive thing I will say is that once I got in with my crew security definitely was nicer to me. haha,

One of the only clubs in the city that actually sells hookah.The only thing I may say they take a little overboard is the ID scanning, it apparently saves your photo in the device they scan it with and revert back to it if you step outside and try to re-enter. A little excessive for my liking.",1

I reserved 10 tickets. I received a phone call from a man at Taj and he asked if I was still attending Taj that night (10/27/18) and I said yes, I thought since I reserved the tickets on Event Brite that I was good to go, he said no I was supposed to call Taj and confirm everything. The man asked for my name and how many people I would like on my guest list, I told him 10, and then I called back a couple of minutes later and asked if I could bring 15, he said sure!I get to Taj at 12:00 am, there's a long line, I told my friend to say my name and they will let her in, because that is what the man told me on the phone earlier that day, and my friend tells me hey aren't letting her in. I got to the front of the line, and the bouncer told me that there is no way that a party is free the night of halloween in the city. I explain to him what the man who called me earlier that day told me, and he said they yelled at the man because he should not have told me that.  I was just extremely frustrated because it was my birthday and I was under the impression that everyone I invited would get into Taj for free. so the guys had to pay $25 and the women paid $20 and there was mandatory coat check for $5.I did enjoy myself, the music was good.. BUT I had heels on and my feet were killing me. I brought sandals with me because I knew this would happen, they made me check my sandals. I asked if I could change into my sandals and they said no, so I took my shoes off and bouncers constantly came up to me with flash lights telling me to put my shoes back on. I honestly just wanted to enjoy my 24th birthday, but there was literally too much going on. I just don't understand why there would even be an event on Event Brite advertising all of that information if it was all false, you have people thinking one thing and then once they arrive it's a whole different story.",3

Only thing that makes me give this 2 stars was the fact that we ordered vocka seltzer and it was $15 usd! I think the bartender raised the price for us, I know cocktails are more expensive in the city but $15 for vocka with water is insane. People were ordering 6-8 dollar drinks and I don't understand how vocka with water was $15! Do better! Also keep in mind it was on a MONDAY! No even the weekend. Not sure if I will come back that was a bit disappointing.",

This rude bitch of a bouncer told me that I could not get my sandals from coat check when I explained to her that I'd like to get my heels because my feet were hurting. This bitch told me that my friend and I should dance for her in order for us to retrieve our things. I ended up retrieving my things after a back and forth with her. The staff was trash and there was barely any one in there for a Friday night. Taj will definitely not be seeing my ass in their establishment ever again.

11,,10/5/2018,264,,"San Francisco, CA",Terrease A.,0,5.0,5,My family and I had the pleasure of working within the Taj lounge event space for my grandmother's surprise birthday. The 5 stars is definitely for the level of customer service I experience while working with Marilyn Castro the event coordinator. As with any event such as a surprise party there are always moments of worrying and concern but the entire team helped alleviate those concerns by always being positive and attentive. During the days leading up to the event they were available via text or email to answer any questions we had or make last minute adjustments. We had technical difficulties and schedule changes on our end but Daria and Marilyn made sure to help in any way they could. My grandmother as well as the guests enjoyed themselves so much that after a week they are still talking about it! We will always be grateful for the team at Taj for making this event one to remember!,

I LOVE HAPPY HOUR SERVICE BTW (But Maybe That's How It Goes On Thursday's & That Was 2 Yrs Ago). Anyway Last Night Was My Bestfriend 26 Birthday & Decided She Wanted To Spend Her Night Here (I Left Work Early Just For The Festivities But I Won't Get Into That). She Had Purchased Her Section A Week In Advance & Whomever The Person Was That Took Care Of Her Stated That The People In Her Party Were To Let The Bouncer At The Door Know Whom Party They're There For & There Will Be No Issues . HA , BULLSHIT ! I Arrived & Of Course I Wait My Turned To Speak To A Bouncer, I Advise Him I'm There For My Friend's Birthday & He Replies ""I'm Sorry I Don't Know That Person, You Mind Stepping To The Side Or Getting On The Line."" Imagine My Response. My Friend Then Comes Outside Disrupting Her Night To Help Me Get Inside. Another Bouncer Or Dude Holding The Clipboard States I Wasn't In Dresscode. Now Ladies, Gents & All Viewers Let Me Tell You Guys How I Made It My Business To Check The Website (Which Says Heels Are Mandatory On Saturday) & Also Their Instagram Hashtag & Location Just To See How Others Dressed On Saturday's To Ensure I Was In Dresscode. Lmao I Know I Did The Most But The Last Thing I Need Was To Arrive & They Send Me Back Home Because I'm Not In Dresscode . Needless To Say I Had On 6in Thigh High Boots , I Pair Of Jeans & A Shirt . Anyway After Going On To Him Bout Everything I Just Stated He Finally Gives In Scans My ID & Allows Me Inside. Now I Inside Ready To Get Another Hookah & Get My Drink On . I Ask A Service Person To Get Me Hookah & Drinks (The Hookah Never Came & She Stated You Have To Go To The Bar For Drinks). I Know I Know What's The Point Of Getting A Table. I Head Over To The Bar Area To Get My Drinks & When I Try To Pay Bartender Says I Need A Card With A Chip . BISH WHAT !? AT THIS POINT IM ANNOYED . I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE OR MAYBE IT WAS THE HYPE OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. Regardless She Invested Money Into This Establishment To Celebrate Her Day & The Customer Service Expected Was SHITTY ! I Recommend The DJ He Was GREAT . As For This Place & Birthdays .. I Wouldn't. There's Another Great Place Next Door (Wink)SN: Hookah ain't worth it .",5
14,6,8/10/2017,198,11,"Queens, NY",Monique M.,837,3.0,218,"Came here to celebrate my cousin's birthday on a Saturday night. Firstly, the decor is beautiful and very unique. From the entrance to the bathroom, you'll be in awe as to how beautiful it is. We did not have food or drinks as we only came here to party at their weekly event. The music is really good. The DJ played a mix of reggae, soca, old-school hip-hop/r&b and some recent tunes. There is also a mixed crowd of cultures and ages which blended really well. We booked a table for bottle service and hookah, the attendants were very nice and attentive, can't go wrong. The place wasn't too packed, a decent sized crowd.What I didn't like here was the fact that security, who should be protecting the premises, walked around with flashlights trying to find any women who didn't have shoes on. Seriously? Why? I get it, it's upscale, but let's be serious. There are other things to worry about in a club. Oh and don't think about bringing a pair of flats or sandals, no no. They will tell you (notice I didn't say ask) to check them in for $5. For the amount of money we were paying for our bottle service, we should've been able to run, jump, and flip in our bare feet as much as we wanted. Another thing, the dancers. There were maybe 1 or 2 dancers standing atop a small stage trying to rev up the crowd with horrible twerk moves and terrible tight clothing. Now if you're surveying people for their outfits, you sure as HELL should make sure your staff are on point too! Ok, that's all.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place. It's nice but it's not the best party spot I've been to in Manhattan. You can definitely find better.",17
15,1,10/10/2017,15,,"Brooklyn, NY",Adeline C.,144,5.0,99,"We just had our 30th high school reunion at Taj and it was a decision we were so happy to make!From the very beginning dealing with the admin side: Chris and Marylin and Angie they helped us with the whole event planning process.  Worked with our budget and made suggestions and responded to our questions promptly.  It was professional to say the least.  This whole process took about 7 months and during this time we had made several changes and everything was accommodated. The night of the event everything was done so nicely,  the bartenders were so courteous and friendly and everyone was happy with the drinks The food was great. We had passing hors d'oeuvres and it was great and not once odd people felt they didn't get any.  We had about 78 ppl and the place was intimate and spacious at the same time.  We were able to have our own photobooth person there and it was great  because there were enough room for a pop up LED booth.  Angie and Shaq the security added extra professionalism because they helped us the committee members enjoy our night after month of planning by greeting and checking in the guests at the door. It was a wonderful experience and everyone who attended all had great experience.  I will definitely look into this place and other places that they also manage for our future events!",1
16,,8/26/2018,196,,"New York, NY",Melissa O.,20,3.0,37,This place is a hit or miss some nights it's really good and other times it empty on Friday night. It's the same thing with the DJ sometimes he is doing his thing and other times he won't even leave the song on for more than 30 seconds.,
17,,5/1/2018,0,,"Mamaroneck, NY",Andres P.,2,4.0,9,"Salsa Mondays! The crowd is very diverse with people of all ages and varying levels of dancing experience. There's a mini lesson at 7pm then a live band usually begins to play at 9 or 10pm (I think that varies). $6 Coronas is the drink special I usually take advantage of on Mondays. Never had the food or a mixed drink here, this review is only for Salsa Mondays",
18,,4/2/2018,5,,"Long Island City, New York, NY",Jodan G.,8,4.0,9,I came to Taj II for brunch. There was a mix up with the seating but I can't fully blame them my party came late. Once we were seated and all that was situated the waitress was very attentive and served us fast and made sure we were well accommodated. I ordered the bourbon bbq chicken wings and red velvet waffles. The food was great and looked pleasing. They made sure our mimosa and Bellini pitchers were filled at all times so that was definitely appreciated!,
19,,5/13/2018,1,2,"Bronx, NY",Chantell A.,1,2.0,10,"Firstly I wanna start off by saying that his place is a complete RIP OFF! I had received an email about their 'Best Saturday Night Party', no cover for everyone & ladies get 2 complimentary drinks until 11:30. Sounded lit so I decided to check em out. 'Doors open at 10'. Fair enough. Me & my girlfriend arrived at 10:30 and were told we had to wait on line until 11 when they started letting people in. Was seriously annoying but, whatever. At this point my heels were killing my feet before I had even gotten into the place but I stuck it out because I knew they were strict about dress code & I wasn't trying to get turned away at the door. Finally get my tickets scanned and enter, only to find out there was a MANDATORY coat check, $5 per item, including the umbrella my gf was carrying! And I had a pair of sneakers in my bag (to change into later) and they made me check them also! I asked this bitchy female bouncer why I had to check my sneakers since they were in my bag out of sight (which I kept on me the entire night) and she rudely replied ""there's only 1 pair of shoes allowed in the showroom"". I was highly irritated and uncomfortable at this point having to spend a total of $20 on coat check ALONE. Thank God for the 2 free drinks because that's the only way we were able to unwind a little and try to enjoy the rest of our night. I also think they need to label the tables reserved for people who bought bottle service packages. I wanted somewhere to sit and rest through the night and constantly felt as if I was in someone's spot. They also need to have the hookah smoking in a separate area besides cramped up at a corner of the bar. They were blocking people from being able to easily order drinks. DJ was cool though, a variety of old & new music was played & he didn't interrupt too much.Also didn't appreciate their $20 minimum to use debit card at the bar, that is absolutely ridiculous as expensive as their drinks were! And the bouncers act like prison security scanning the dance floor with their little flashlights every 10 minutes. I had taken my shoes off at one point for a few minutes for relief and one of them stood there shining his light on my feet until I put them back on! I almost felt as if I was a criminal, lol. Mind you, I was dancing against a wall with my gf in the cut, barely even noticeable. I couldn't relax & enjoy myself as thoroughly as I had planned. I'd pass 100% on partying here ever again. Too many other lit spots in NYC that are more worth the hassle of going out.",7
20,1,7/7/2018,121,,"Brooklyn, NY",Leah S.,0,1.0,3,This a half way decent venue with a good mentality. Less than half way service and a hood response! Busboys act like they're entitled to what??? I'm not sure. All I wanted after spending $40 on food alone was a Togo container.. why a Togo container at a club?? Because the kitchen was open and the food smelled great but no one bothered to deliver silverware.. I'm not a caveman and refuse to eat salad with my hands !!!,
21,1,4/5/2018,114,,"New York, NY",Jani C.,1,1.0,3,Don't ever booked this place for an event unless you have a back up plan. I booked an event over 6 months in Advance only to have Christopher Collins call me to cancel weeks before the actual event because he decided to book another event on the same day.

The line was a bit long but the bouncer let us in once the birthday boy arrived. The music was great throughout the whole night and so was the ambiance. It wasn't too crowded when I went so I was able to walk around and explore the different sections. The bar also had a lot of options and the bartender was very attentive with her customers. I heard a few negative things about this place but everyone has their own experience.

24,2,3/25/2017,71,,"East Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",Marie T.,893,4.0,30,"Friday night at Taj was great. After reading the reviews I was a little apprehensive about going, but since it was my girls bday I had to go. Got there before 6pm and there was no door charge (I think after 6:30 they charge $15). Coat check was $3 and we had a reservation so we were taken directly to our table upstairs.  We ordered a series of appetizers from our knowledgeable and lovely waitress. Porcini Risotto  Balls, Taj barbecue wings, chicken fingers, catfish fritters and chicken quesadilla were all delicious and flavorful (that barbecue sauce is everything). The apps came out at a reasonable time. The music was good they played a lot of throwback hits that kept us moving and grooving. It was a nice older crowd which I appreciated. There was as  2 for one special on drinks until 8pm and you didn't need to go to the bar to get it, you could order it from your table and avoid the wait. I'm not too sure what night the other reviewers went to Taj but I must say Friday after work was great.",4

The promoter told us our section included 12 people but when we arrived, we were told we could only get 10 people in so we had to pay for the others (strike 1). Once we got in the club and to our section, we were not happy because they tried to put us in a corner upstairs by the bar that only had seating for 5/12 people and told us we would have to pay an additional $300 to sit downstairs in a better section (strike 2). The final strike was when we had to stand at ""our section"" for 10 minutes before the ""host"" was able to move the group sitting in our section. Luckily, for me and my friends, the credit card I gave them was declined about 5 minutes after this debacle due to fraud protection so we were able to leave and go to another club. We lost our $100 deposit but we didn't care and went to rooftop 760 and got a section with ease. Please do not waste your time here.",1

There are NO perks with guest list like a separate line, free admission after 11 or anything. The woman explicitly told me sneakers are fine for men. My guest was turned away because of his sneakers but after I fussed and showed the text from events staff the bouncer says he could enter if he paid $70 at the bar.

And I'm still not even tipsy from these wack drinks so I can't even say it's me being annoying. I will say however that there was one lovely lady security guard who helped us with our friend who got sick at the end of the night, brought her stuff out for us from coatcheck and got her water.

Why they think they can charge this much for a place like that is truly beyond me. They also had a mandatory coat check that was $5 *per* item.  As if all that wasn't already annoying, flash forward and I'm getting super patted down by this rude employee. Then my friend was lit and couldn't find her phone. We tracked it and turns out the people at the front had had it for a good hour. Of course the rude employee was at the forefront of all this, came up to me and started going off about how my friend never paid the cover so they were holding her phone. Ok cool - that's all I needed to know. This lady kept going on and on as if I had done something wrong. Long story short, this place is not worth any amount of money - especially not $30.

There is no organization at this place, and the bouncers are incredibly rude. Multiple times they moved us and scolded us for not standing in the correct line, but then once moved, another bouncer would come and tell us we weren't in the right line either. Also one of the bouncers kept telling us that we weren't even at the right club! He kept saying Slate (a swankier club) was down the street and asked us to move along.

Managed to find street parking a few blocks away- and it totally worked for me- since I was wearing high heel boots. Taj's music was popping and settled on cocktails as soon as we settled in. Drinks were nothing extravagant but knocked me a bit. Really can't compare Halloween night to any other night, but the music was nice and the crowd was somewhat ""mature"" when we first went in. Except- 2 hours in and I noticed the crowd went from like 40+ to like kids in their 20s and we felt out of place. At that point, I felt one of these kids could've been my kid and felt a bit juvenile for my taste.Don't get me wrong...

No AC, felt like a house party ;( the music wasn't very diverse until DJ took over 1 hour prior to the end of the party. They had a huge dinner table at our section we couldn't even move around and they were out of all the good liquor when we wanted to BUY more bottles. Hookah service sucks. We wanted new coal and it took for the promoter to go get it. Waitress was non existent after delivering the lights on the bottles. I won't ever go back honestly:",3

37,3,8/27/2016,241,2,"Bronx, NY",Latoya W.,410,4.0,160,Why am I given this establishment four stars. Well let me start by saying I've attended numerous events at this location. First Sunday Brunch which is the best event hands down. I've come for party's my least favorite event.  I've also come for  happy hour on a Thursday. First Sunday Brunch: $45 all you can't eat and drink for two hours. Buffet style and the food is great. The menu changes but my favorite items are the catfish bites and the macaroni and cheese. The music is great. The atmosphere  is dope and the party gets Crunk. Make reservations if you plan on eating and drinking.Party experience: it's pretty mixed experience. I've gone sometimes and have had a great time. Other times not so great. Things I hate. if you purchase  bottles  they sometimes ask you to get up if your done with your bottles. Like why if I got here early brought  three bottles why should we have to get up. Especially  when there other spots for ppl to sit. Also sometimes the crowded is a bit ratchet. No judgement  though.Happy hour  well  it can be good bad and wacky. But who cares it's freaking happy hour and you can get topshelf and that's all that matters. Lol. The food is pretty decent too get the wings I love the wings. Decor: simple not trendyCost: $$,4
38,,10/17/2017,545,1,"Hayward, CA",Jan M.,1,1.0,3,This was my first club out in NYC and was the worst experience ever. I sent a reservation through their website and spoke with one of their representatives. We spoke Bottle packages and agreed to a certain package which included bottles of Moët and a hookah. I come to the venue with my guys and paid for the table only to find out minutes into the club that they were servicing us some low end champagne and that we had to pay extra for the hookah because it's not included in the package..... I already spoke to the person Taj would contact me with and they assured me everything would be there. Idk if this is just this establishment or all establishments because I ended up going to a club in Harlem the next night spending $1500 and received the same type of service. I feel like NY is the city of scams. This typa stuff don't happen in Cali. If I'm spending big money in your establishment there needs to be some respect level for your clients. So far bad business practices in NY. I wouldn't go back here again.,2

The decor is ok but the layout for a brunch in a club environment seemed awfully awkward.

That is the number one rule of business and those fools at Taj don't get this.  It seems like they are applying street hustle tactics of get a quick buck.  So last night Was the worse club experience I've had in my life. My cousin got the vip section and I paid $55.  When I get to the club there was one line and the brain dead bouncer kept saying there was two lines. Anyways, I stood in line for 30 minutes and it didn't move at all. They do that on purpose so the club can charge the cover. But we paid $55 each for VIP and bottle service so I thought we were good. But they charged us $20 to get in like everyone else. Everybody that worked in that place were rude and unprofessional. I had to hold myself back from getting into a physical altercation with the bouncers. One of the bouncers told a group of white people that they were waiting for the wrong club and that they should go to Slate next door. If that was the other way around it would be called racist.",6

I just missed free before 12 AM last night and got on line after circling for a spot then settling on the garage on the block. It was perfect weather and my feet were comfortable so I didn't mind the super slowly moving line. I actually learned more about how they make money as I overheard the girl that sells bottles discussing adjusting their prices by reading the crowd. Of course I don't want to wait on a line but at the same time I would never ever buy a bottle especially when I could go on vacation or get a pair of Louboutins for the costs she quoted. So my bestie and I finally get in after passing a sign listing the mandatory dress code. Admission was $30 because of a ""celebrity DJ"" but $25 with a guest list and my friend who was already inside talked them down to $20 which must be paid in cash. We went in and there was clearly no enforcement of the dress code. The music was ok and the crowd left something to be desired. We only stayed for a little because my friends were tired and we weren't having much of a good time.

It's on the small side but I'm realizing as I frequent places I actually enjoy a smaller intimate setting. There's something to be said about a cool, sexy & mature crowd. That's what I experienced on Thursday. They were promoting their Happy Hour 2 for 1 special. Which was awesome because everything was top shelf liquor & not that watered down stuff. Anything you wanted was available for the price of 1 from 6pm-9pm. What a steal! The reason I am giving Taj 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was extremely hard to get the bartender's attention. I don't know if it was because I'm short & everyone else was towering over me. I felt like I needed to put in two drink orders at a time so that I was able to take full advantage of their Happy Hour.It may seem minor to others but for me that was major. In a not so crowded place where everyone's orders were fulfilled where I waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged is insane to say the least. Also I was disturbed that the bathroom attendant was a man that stood in the adjoining lobby for the bathrooms. The bathrooms were open where anyone can walk into it if the attendant wasn't looking or stepped away for a minute or two. I always feel uneasy about bathrooms setup like that.",10

We left ate somewhere else and came back because of the 2 for 1 drinks specials and mainly the music( good hip/hop & r&b) We finally got a spot at the bar after 7:30. It had died down since the happy hour was about to end. We did try their hookah a nice gentleman purchase one for us, it was fun. Made the night more relaxing. The bartenders were nice, the people were cool, meet some cool people. After a few drinks we did eat the cat fish fritters and Mac and cheese it was ok. Will order something else next time.

I also had to stand there and break my comb so I could get in with it. The lady claimed I could stab someone (come on seriously... I'm there for a party)As I was waiting to get overly searched by the female bouncer I also saw them making a girl check in her plastic hand cuffs (she was a cop) and a girls masquerade mask.I THOUGHT IT WAS A COSTUME PARTY!!

They slowly start letting people in at 11:30 and by the time 12am hits, they've only admitted 10 people. The rest are charged a ridiculous rate to enter. In addition, the mandatory $5 coat check is a fraud. If you bring a pair of flats when your feet start to hurt... you have to coat check your ""shoes"" for a separate $5 fee. I waited in line for 1hr and 30 min before 12am... still had to pay an absurd admission fee. I was denied to speak with management. There was no air flow and you could feel the sweat of the guests as you moved through the crowd. I was advised by security,  I was admitted late during my visit because the venue was clearing out an event for white people and the security referred to my delayed admission as ""white privilege"". I was apart of a VIP guest list with bottle service and still treated like crap. Right after our bottles were finished we were rudely asked by the bartender to get up from our reserved table. I was truly disgusted with management and this establishment doesn't deserve my hard earned money. If your not a person of color you might have a chance at decent service. P.S. A bottle of water is $5. With money hungry, unorganized and unprofessional management this place will soon be in shambles.

Just letting you know this beforehand because I didn't know that. That being said, it's buffet style food and you can go up and get food as many times as you want within the two hour time period you're allotted. The drinks you get are mimosas and bellinis, also for two hours. For my money, $47 for all you can eat for two hours and some mimosas is not a good deal. What ends up happening is you end up paying WAY too much for a brunch and then, because you spent a ton, you end up eating WAY too much (or you should) to try and compensate. It's just not a good idea.The DJ however, was rather fun. I must say that. He started the night off playing some classic 90s hip-hop and r&b and then worked his way into the newer stuff. He held a pretty good vibe. I will say he was fun, but definitely not worth my $47 or so dollars.",9

They specifically told me to come @ 10:30/10:45 so that we can get seated on time. I specifically asked, since I will be turning 21 that night can I still come ? The answer I was given was YES. I arrived with my party, they had the AUDACITY to deny me and say my friends & I must stand in heels in the COLD and wait an hr and a half until I turn 21. Oh, it doesn't stop there. They said since we weren't doing a $700 package we could not keep the table past 1am. So they made us wait again. Not only did they make us wait again but these dumb idiots don't even know of their own packages posted only. My $300 package included 10 free guests, 2 bottles of Moët, 1 hookah, and VIP skip the line. They had the audacity to say I was LYING & demanded me to stand there in the cold and pull up online the package I paid for. Which I didAnd you should've seen the stupid look on all their idiotic faces.  Now this is 12:30, then they had the audacity to say no flats and you have to check them in you can't carry them. Finally after the nonsense we get seated at 12:45, paid $300 to sit for ONLY 15 MINUTES. I complained and this dumb chick said ""I got you, trust me I will find another table for you guys"". Meanwhile our package included 1 hookah and we NEVER got the hookah. I had a reservation for 11 and they really made me sit there and wait for damn near 2 hours. Worst birthday of my life, to wrap the story up I brought in my birthday standing on line in heels in the cold. This place is completely mediocre ran by a dumb blonde that doesn't even know her own packages or treat her customers with respect. They're complete crooks and will steal your money. They'll tell you one thing online or via email EVEN THROUGH THE PHONE. But in person it's a different story. And when they say they'll accommodate you they definitely WONT.

If you can get a table, do it. It makes the experience so much better. If not, definitely congregate in the back dance floor area in front of the DJ. Every time that I've gone there's been a great DJ, playing everything from Hip Hop to R&B and also reggae and soca. Honestly, if it wasn't for the great reggae and soca segment that always happens, I might give Taj 2 stars. The drinks are typical NYC club prices and they also have some good hookah.

However, there a number of things that rub me the wrong way.  First is the pseudo red carpet / velvet rope facade. You're not an exclusive club in Meatpacking. Actually, you're not really a club at all. The crowd inside ranges from boring to grimey. Let's ditch the pretentiousness.They have a mandatory coat check, and to top it off they will charge you per item. Yes, they wanted to check both my coat and my work bag at the low rate of $5 each. Wtf? This is pretty irritating...it's like when bars automatically add a service charge + tip when you order a drink. Oh wait, this place does that too! To complete the trifecta, there are bathroom attendants in the back itching to take your cash in exchange for handing you a paper towel. Seriously, it's like the manager/owner of this place went to the library, checked out all the books on how to nickle and dime your clientele, and then implemented every single topic from the book.The saving grace is the fact that their happy hour features 2 for 1 drinks. The downside is that these 2 for 1 deals don't exactly attract the upper echelon of New York's partying crew. 2 stars...not the worst, but it's pretty far down there.",11

I had been there on a few prior occasions, and had enjoyed their Latin night event which takes place during the week.  Due to unforseen circumstances, i realized that i wouldnt be able to arrive at my 8p reservation time, instead about a half hour later. So I called and spoke with ""Simone"" who stated that that would be no problem.  As we drove into the Chelsea area and within just blocks from the establishment, we were met with stalled traffic, police sirens, taped off streets and crowds of standing people.  We had no idea what was happening.  Police were not allowing any entry for cars and limiting the number of pedestrians down  21st and 22nd streets between 5th and 6th avenues.  After finally finding our way out of the traffic jam, we ended up having to park several blocks away. We arrived minutes past 9pm.  By this time, we learned from onlookers that two bombs had been detonated in the area and that there had been injuries.  My invitees and i were very frightened.  However, i decided to make the most of it. Shortly after we were seated, we were informed by scantily clad waitress  that the kitchen would be closing soon and that we needed to place our dinner orders.    We were puzzled, since we had just arrived and were still waiting on invitees to arrive.  Further, she stated that the entire restaurant would be closing its doors and my party and i would have to wait outside and be reescorted inside when they reopen.  In addition, she asserted, that in order to keep our table we would have to agree to pay for a $700 bottle package!!  Further she exclaimed that there would be a another menu given with far less items and options.  When i inquired in astonishment as to why we couldnt keep our table since i had indeed had a reservation, the waitress said she would speak to the manager.  Minutes later the waitress returned and said ""Since you didnt call to say that you were going to be late, we cant let you keep the table.""  I couldnt believe what i was hearing!  This incompetent waitress had just assumed that I just had'nt called!  When i informed her that i had in fact spoken with Simone and that the explosions and chaos right outside her doors had made it impossible to get there any earlier, she continue to insist that there was nothing she could do.  As my family and I walked away in disgust, this waitress had the audasity to wish me a happy birthday!  There wasnt absolutely a reason to have been treated in such a deplorable manner, especially under the circumstances of that day and the fact that there were empty tables all around.  I did not however allow these pretentious folks to rain on my parade!  We had a fabulous meal and danced the night away at Iguanas!",16

If this was a problem then they should have said no to seating us and took payment first. The security guard Shek or Shak comes over and removes us like savages saying that we have to leave if we are not going to pay and flashing the flash lights in our faces very disrespectfully. He deserves to be fired for his manner in which he treated us unnecessarily and for removing us with force for no reason.

I understand that the crowd Taj brings in tend to hold onto their cash as if it were a limb on their body..

(So you literally have to pay to check your sandals at the door).The security inside harasses you with a flashlight to keep your heels on.The manager was very disrespectful when I politely asked for her corporate number. The bartenders service was terrible. Awful night to celebrate a birthday at a club that I've previously been to before.They definitely lost a valuable customer.,4

I'm usually not that into fashion stuff because people often seem a bit dejected and mean but this one had to be one of the most tolerable ones that I had ever seen. The drinks on behalf of Ciroc, were definitely on point and the dessert spread was straight up beast mode, with a lot of cupcakes and treats that a bunch of us took home since well...models don't always want to eat baked goods, lol.The only real problem was the entry situation was hella akward. I mean it has a red carpet entry but it was like 4 feet long, that also doubled as the coat check line, that also tripled as the step and repeat photo area, in like a 4 foot by 2 foot space. Mine as well just have a regular entryway but maybe that just so happened to be the setup for this particular night.",

From the moment I walked in I knew this wasn't going to be worth the $215 I paid  for my ticket. First off, the description for the ticket said that coat check was included, and the girls at the front very rudely told me that it was a ""misunderstanding"". When I asked to speak to the manager, they said that he had already gone down there like 10 times that night and didn't even bother to call him, they just handed me my coat back. I ended up having to pay. I walked in and it was EXTREMELY crowded. There was no space to move, and the ""VIP"" bar area had just ONE (very slow) bartender. How are they only going to have ONE bartender in a VIP section with open bar?? Then he was getting upset when people were complaining about their wait time. They gave me a wristband to access the mezz area, but there was noone checking them and everyone was just all over the ""VIP"" areas. If I would have know how unorganized they are at this venue, I would have just purchased the basic admission. None of the party ""goods"" mentioned in the ticket description were provided to me. They said Junebug was who ran the event that night, so I don't know if they are the ones to blame and not the venue. Either way, not at all worth what I paid for.

126,2,7/12/2012,276,6,"Bayside, NY",Peter S.,395,5.0,337,"My wife and I wanted to come here for Salsa Monday.  It was our first time.We arrived at 5:10 (the website said doors open at 5pm) but the doors were locked.  About 10 minutes later a woman unlocked the doors, so I suppose Salsa Monday doors really open ""sometime"" between 5 and 5:30.   At this point, the place was empty.  Our waitress / server was Dee Dee who was more than amazing.  She knew all the etiquette of serving, was attentive without hovering, made sure we were happy at all times, was very cute and somewhat flirty.  We loved her.Before 6:30, they play Downtempo / Lo-Fi music, very softly.  It's actually a very pleasant place to eat because the music is background ambiance, not in your face, and their choice of Downtempo / Lo-Fi is conversation-neutral (e.g. they played an extended soft remix of Moby's Porcelin).We ordered the Taj Sliders and Buffalo Wings with the Taj Bourbon sauce.The sliders were dry and over-cooked even though I ordered them medium rare.  Some sharp cheddar on those burgers would go a long, long way to making them better.  However, to Taj's credit, they were seasoned very nicely.  Had a nice little kick to them and a bit of an exotic flavor.  Cumin, perhaps.The wings were very good.  You get 3 choices of sauce: bourbon, bbq, and hot.   BBQ is the sweetest, so that's not for me.  Bourbon is ""slightly"" sweet, so we got that (besides, the name was intriguing).  It turns out the bourbon sauce is indeed, slightly sweet and not hot at all.  I think next time we go we'll order the hot wings instead of the bourbon wings.  One interesting note: the outside of the wings was pleasantly crunchy.  We were surprised.  I think they bread and lightly fry the wings to get that crunchiness.  Very nice!Ordering two appetizers gets you a (very small) complimentary carafe of Sangria.   The Sangria was a *tad* watery, but otherwise had good flavor.Our friend came at 6 (the place was still empty) and ordered a real carafe of sangria.  It was big and somewhat strong for sangria.   :)At 6:30 they started to play DJ Salsa and I started dancing alternately with my wife and our friend.  The place had very few patrons, and we were the only ones on the dance floor.We got a few good dances in before a woman started giving group Salsa lessons from the DJ area.  She went over the basic, regular right turn, and broken left turn.  It was very good On-2 instruction, and she was marvelous (and hot).   I would estimate the lessons began about 7?   7:30?   And lasted perhaps half an hour.After the lessons, there were people on the dance floor, but it was still pretty empty for a Salsa dance.  Lots and lots of room.   At 9pm the dance floor was about as full as I'm comfortable with.   At 10/10:30 I'd say the place was overfull (the way you normally think of Salsa clubs).   I heard that this night was a light night in terms of the number of people; we'll go again and see if there's any difference.  Personally, I love empty dance clubs!    We left at 11:30 when the number of people on the dance floor made Salsa dancing unenjoyable. The lounge itself is very pretty.  Well decorated in a muted / understated / tasteful kind of way.   Dark, but not too dark.  You can tell someone really put a lot of thought into the ambiance of this place.There are two kinds of seating.  Alcoves which sit 2-4 people and tables which seat about 5-6 (?) people.   Seating is limited, and it's first come first serve, so having a snack or dinner here before Salsa dancing is wise.   Alcove seating is someone uncomfortable because the backs of the alcoves are so far away.  They try to mitigate this by giving you lots of pillows, but the end result is that it's still hard to sit in the alcove without slouching unless you're conscious of your posture.The dance floor is good.  Nice hardwood floors.   I would say average for spinning and turning.  I was able to do many double turns and a few triple turns, so the floor is pretty good.The one bad thing about the dance floor is that there are these 3 large columns that kind of ""partition"" the dance floor.  I wish they weren't there, but they were more of an annoyance than a hindrance.  If there's a live band, they'd be a bummer (there was supposed to be a live band that night at 9pm, but I guess the band canceled).We will definitely be back!  Nice place to go Salsa dancing on Mondays.  Actually, it's the only place I know of in NYC to go Salsa dancing on Mondays....",8

The after-work thing was so-so. I'm not really into mingling with random people, when it's mostly people just looking for other attractive people to talk with. Meh. On Mondays, admission is reduced until 7pm but the dance lesson goes until at least 7:30pm and the real dancing doesn't start until 8:30pm or so. If you're going with friends to hang out, drink, or eat, it's worth getting their early because it's a beautiful lounge. However, if you're going to dance, go later and pay full admission unless you want to sit around for a couple hours.The big columns on the dance floor are a little annoying but otherwise, it's a nice space but it can get REALLY crowded on some nights if there's a special event.",5

Is it a restaurant? Is it a club? Is it Indian? Is it Spanish? Overall, the food is good, but overpriced, the music is great for a club, and the service is only okay. I came here two times (I will explain why below), had two completely different experiences, and will never come back again or recommend it to anyone.So I like trying out different restaurants with restaurant.com and this place was listed as an Indian restaurant near where I live. *Um why.* I'm honestly not sure if I should fault Taj 2 (""Taj Lounge""...yeah, um, is there a name?) or restaurant.com to be honest to be misleading innocent people who want to have a nice Indian meal. So I want to go try a new Indian restaurant with a couple of my friends on a Monday night and so I get a $25 off restaurant.com coupon for this place. We get to the door at 7:30pm....and there's a bouncer? He says that there is a $10 cover per person.WHOA...what?? We want to come to YOUR restaurant and we have to pay to eat a meal? Absolutely not. So just as we turn to leave with confused looks, the bouncer asks if we're there just to have dinner, we say yes, and he lets us in without a cover. Okay..... So we sit down....at one of two tables in the entire place....and see that sure enough, this is a club. We look at the menu and everything is regular American food....calamari, meatballs, chicken.....no real hint of Indian food. And everyone is salsa dancing to good music on a Monday night...which is cool....except everyone is twice our age. And that's not Indian music to go with the theme of the, um, name...... And we can't hear each other to talk during dinner. And this is not a normal restaurant. And this is not what we were expecting at all. So we left.Two weeks later, I'm still thinking about this $25 off restaurant.com coupon that I have and am curious to know about the food in this place...I mean, I don't want to waste it. But I can't dream of asking anyone to actually come to this place with me....so I plan to go alone and take it home with me. Mistake.This is a Wednesday night and thankfully there is no cover when I walk up. I walk up to the bar and place my order with the nice bartender, asking for it to go. I would've also ordered a drink while I was waiting, but I had been sick so decided against it...so I waited. For 40 minutes. I was most likely the youngest person there....everyone was dancing to the (really good honestly) music...but I was just hungry and wanted to go home. No one came up to me to ask if I needed anything or to give me a time check on my food...nothing. So after 40 minutes when I asked about my meal to the other bartender, I think there was some freaking out like I was mad (um no? I was just asking because you were ignoring me....) and so the nice bartender was overly apologetic when my food came out 5 minutes later.Oh really?

I stopped going once me and my friends went for a party and 2 of them couldn't get in. I then found out because they were overweight. It wasn't like they were dressed badly or anything so I was just done with that place. Plus the female security there is the worst.",3

They were really sweet, and one bouncer even carried me to the VIP section when he saw that my feet were killing me (result of too many drinks with 6 inch heels). I thought that was really sweet of him! Lol, okay maybe a little ""ratchet"" of me, but who cares, it's my birthday and everything I do shall be forgiven! The ambience is very beautiful, romantic, sultry feel to it, somewhat.  For a place like this, I would expect them to charge cover fee, but they were actually true to their word! Ladies free before 1am with a free drink, guys free before 12.  A beautiful place in the city that's not pretentious is wonderful. The drinks were delicious, completely made to your liking! And only $12, again, this is wonderful, especially being in the city.The music was EVERYTHING! I'm an old school junkie, the music was so good, couldn't stop dancing (hence having to be carried away by the brolic bouncer).Okay, so the crowd...like I said, staff was not pretentious, this place has the right to be selective given its tasteful decoration...but they let anybody in!  My crew was well dressed! And I don't really care, but it would be nice if the crowd was well dressed too. It doesn't matter though, we were dressed up for my occasion.I have to go back another night, with regular 4inch heels, maybe some flat boots or something, that way I can really get my full dance on! Listen, the music is right, give it a chance. I almost decided not to come here based on the recent bad reviews but I am super glad that a friend of mine and my cousin-in-law told me that this place was ""dope."" It really is!",8
143,1,6/23/2013,329,12,"New York, NY",Courtney L.,105,1.0,58,"So after this being my second visit here, I am convinced this place sucks.My friends and I had received a text message from a promoter specifying that ladies free before 12:30 and that you also receive two free drinks. So we opted for Taj that night. We arrive and we see that there is a line so we wait. Right before I approached the line I had begun to get the hiccups. So I wait in line (that's not moving) for about 15 minutes, with the hiccups until I can't take it anymore. I finally run over to the Halal Meat cart (only a few feet from where I was standing) and buy a bottle of water. The bottle barely hits my mouth before I am damn near charged buy the bouncer telling me I have to get off the line with my drink. Are you kidding me? Strike 1.We finally make it up to the door and we show the ""clipboard guy"" our text message and he lets us right in. Now, is it me but both times that I have been here I am searched more thoroughly at Taj than I am with TSA at the airport. Strike 2.We are now entering the venue and we go straight to the bar to redeem our free drinks. Call the bartender over show the message we got for drinks and the bartender says we were supposed to receive a ""ticket"" to get the free drinks. So we go back to the entrance to get this ""ticket"" they direct us back to ""clipboard guy"". Clipboard guy then said ""No, that party ended at 11"". We then show him the text message again and he's like ""I don't know anything about that"". Now, how are they going to honor one part of the promotion, letting us in free, and not the other. We obviously got in for free after 11, but now we can get our drinks that was promised to us. Lure tactics! Strike 3Now, what I have left out is everything, except for the hiccups, happened the first time we went to Taj. They send out these false promotions just to get foot traffic through the door but don't honor the drink part. Not cool. The rough security, the mean and rude bouncers. Therefore, my friends and I will not be returning to this venue. The staff isn't nice and crowd is ratchet. Yes, I said it. They are ratchet! There is also always one weird guy who takes up the entire dance floor with his crazy moves. Each time we were there it was a different guy but still, I didn't come to this spot to watch a guy take up an entire dance floor flailing his arms around.Taj, get yourself together.",15

145,,12/18/2016,74,,"Brooklyn, NY",Samantha D.,0,1.0,2,"Don't even bother coming to this place!!! THEY ARE RACIST! Me and my friends decided to come here for a friends birthday and we were standing in line which we had no problem doing until 3 white girls came behind us. ( this is an important factor) so these girls thought they were standing in for bounce which is across the street and I told them that this is for Taj. These girls asked me if this club was cool & I said yes I came before and had fun. While we were talking this WHITE employee comes out of nowhere and ask the girls how many they were and they said 3 and she was like ""come with me"". So I'm like wth and they were confused as well. They continued to say this is weird and felt uncomfortable the way the girl came at them so they asked me and my friends to tag along so we did. They went and told the lady it's now 7 so we're thinking we're good so we approach and they took forever to let us in. When we finally got in and checked our coats which was $5. The lady told me that my blazer needed to be checked because it had a zipper. I already checked my jacket so basically pay $10 to check them. I refused to. As we tried to go in they're talking about $20 meanwhile the white girls got in and didn't have to pay. So the lady bouncer told me to go back outside to ask the Asian guy to stamp us so we could get in. And I went and asked him and he looked confused. He was like "" ohh it wasn't me it was the other guy"". He was the ONLY guy outside besides the bouncer who doesn't give stamps. So we then realized that this was simply racism. We couldn't get in free like those girls because we weren't white. And probably thought we weren't going to spend any money. I had planned on surprising my friend with a bottle while in there and they ruined it. And don't get me wrong we didn't mean paying $20 but after all of this we weren't comfortable anymore. Who wants to go to a place like this? Not I. I will NEVER come back here again. They discriminate against people and I do not tolerate that. We proceeded and got our stuff and money back and went somewhere else. We had a BALL. And we didn't even have to pay to get in. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. They WILL HAVE YOU OUTSIDE WAITING JUST TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE NOT LETTING ANYONE ELSE IN. Do NOT GO!",

Seriously feeling himself!! He hassled and told these three girls who waited as long as I did to get off the line! Why??? Because he felt like it!! Those who were on the bottle service line went in with ease though. Hmmm!! There was hardly anyone in the club and instead of everyone forming a line there was a mob of people to get in. The management  is very unprofessional and had the nerve to tell people if they wanted to get in faster that they can pay $40! Give me a break! I would never return to this place even if you paid me.

This place gets extremely crowded though, and once that happens the bouncers tend to let in more females than males.If you come here to celebrate something special I suggest you make your life easier and order a package. There packages are the most reasonable that I have seen for the city, and come one, whenever someone can offer you food, reserved space and alcohol for under 1000 in the city you know you have a good deal. The only thing I didn't care for is after the person who ordered the package comes in, the bouncers act funny with letting other guest come.

They had lots of reggae music & as the night went on, more top 40's R&B and rap. The drinks definitely could have been less expensive. And the dress code was really lax :/Be prepared, if you use your credit card for the bar, they automatically add 20% gratuity, not 18%. Never heard of a bar/lounge doing that.

When I got there the table was TINY and they made us sit on 4 ottomans even though I booked a table for 10. I booked through a party planning company who gave me a certain price that included gratuity. When I spoke to the person running the event she acted as though she had no idea what I was talking about and tried to charge me 200$ more! I was furious! We stayed anyway because it was already late and we were waiting for people. I didn't want to change plans at the last minute.  The waitress barely even showed up to our table. For the amount that she made off of us you think she would have been a bit more attentive. When I received my cc bill they charged me for more than I signed for. I had to fight with my card company to have this charge corrected. I will never ever give this place my business again.,6

Walked around and came back to a line, whatever, Amy's inside waiting for us. For a not crowded place, they sure kept us on the line for a while. After we checked our jacket, doorway ppl asked us for tickets to enter. What tickets? We were given no such thing! They then asked us to go back outside to retrieve tickets from the clipboard dude, outside ppl said they don't give out tickets, directed us back in, door ppl still b like ""I gotta c tickets, guys!""... Get yo shiz straight, people!Get in, meets Aimez @ the bar, and she asked if I got my 2 drink tickets cuz they're supposta give 'em to the girls. Nope! Went back to the doorway to ask for drink tickets and those ppl were still asking US for their mysterious tickets!

None of us going had ever been here before so we weren't quite sure what type of scene to expect. Nonetheless, we dressed to impress and showed up around 12am.Walking up towards the door, there was a huge line outside. Most of the line consisted of black men. They looked to be about 25 + years of age. Suffice to say, it was not the ""diverse"" crowd I had read about on Taj.The bouncer plucked my friends and I out from the line and let us skip the black men ahead of us. I'm assuming it's for male-female ratio. Since we arrived after 12am, we had to pay a cover. $20 for girls after 12am is ridiculous! Luckily that door price was reduced since we claimed to be on some special guest list. Whatever. Under normal circumstances I would have left but my friends were already inside. The bouncer and the rest of the staff were very friendly, although we had our bags inspected before we came in. OH, and they pat you down. Inside it wasn't as crowded as it looked on the outside. There was ample room by the bar, and the dance area was pretty roomy as far those go. The drinks at the bar were overpriced! $12 for a shot of tequila. $9 for a gin and tonic that was sooooo watered down. There was a second level area that over looked the bar and dance floor. The music was mostly reggae and early hip hop. Since it's not really my type of music, I can't rate the DJ on how well he did. Although, he did keep screaming into the mic several annoying phrases, ""Where my single, independent ladies at?!"" ""Where my alcoholics at?!"" This was repeated every 10-15 minutes. Really annoying.I probably would not come back to this lounge. The crowd and the music were not to my taste. I prefer top 40 when I go to the clubs.

My go to have a great time place.  But recently I had the worst experience there! I tried to make reservations for my friends birthday. & do bottle service and I was in contact with someone name Simone for about a week. We spoke about the open bar package that they offered & I agreed with that for 15 people. This was stated via email. Simone replied with perfect until the day of I called to do the payment she then says Noo my boss won't allow 15 only 20 ppl for open bar. This angered me & I quickly had to find another deal. So we talked about the $600 bottle service package I told her ill call her back after I speak with the other members of the party. I called back  around 10pm & another lady I spoke with (who disclose her name) told me if you spoke to Simone prior you will be fine just come down. Me & my party reach Taj & a lady at the door quickly shut down the $600 bottle packages. Said that was only good until 11. Simone never told me there was a time I ask to speak to the manager (Dexter) & he was SUPER RUDE. He offered to give us the $600 package but him, the women at the door along with Chris at the door begin to talk about my party in front of our faces. So naturally someone from my party started defending us. & that's when they decide  not to let us in. Chris stated ""when adults are talking you don't interrupt"" I started to lash out because clearly I'm a grown women! To shorten the story they mad excuse for us not to get in we stayed outside did two hours until we resolved this & we had to pay $800 to get in because they claimed no sneakers (even though they let a number of people in with sneakers in front of us) to do bottle service. We mad rage best of it but the manager was very rude and so was the front door people that's not how you treat people who want to spend money in your establishment.

I'm not oposed to paying a cover charge--this is NY--but to get inside and it's relatively EMPTY!!? Strike ONE. Three of their bottle service banquets were unoccupied. The other booths had squatters. That's the antics of a whack ass club trying to hype themselves up. The drinks served by a bootleg V-Cakes are $11 a piece (typical) but were weak as I water. Strike TWO. The bouncers also are also wanna be TSA agents who searched and barked at the patrons in line. Strike THREE. They should just install metal detectors! Nonetheless we tried to make this a good night because we bought our own party. We ordered three rounds of bottle service and all was good until it felt like the AC was turned down 3-4 times during the night. Strike FOUR. The DJ thrn starts hyping the patrons up with an unannounced guest appearance. Who could it be? No offense but it was a Hot 97 dj Angie Martinez. Really?? NO celebrity. That's your hype? Are WE that thirsty? SMH.  Enough said for Taj Lounge. It will not be a repeat again.,6
179,,3/1/2015,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Walchade J.,0,1.0,3,Worst brunch party ever. The manger had the nervous to turn on the TV to watch a basketball game. All the guys were watching TV instead of enjoying the party. All the females were dancing by themselves. Never again. Food was ok. The manager is an idiot. He didnt accommodate us. Don't waste your time going. If so make sure there isn't a game going on.,1
