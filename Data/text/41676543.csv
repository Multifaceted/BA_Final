The staff was incredibly friendly no matter what time we strolled through the door. By our second visit they had already remembered us. We enjoyed Honey Lavender Lattes (both hot and cold), Ice Coffees galore, and those addictive chocolate chip cookies. It was such a great vibe that we'd end up chilling there and shooting the breeze with the staff.I was honestly a little sad when the trip came to an end and we bought our last coffees at the shop. It'll always have a special place for me, but hopefully my travels will bring me back into their orbit sometime soon.",,,

This shop is little sister to the original on chambers street. The training is not as intensive as  say you might find at intelligentsia, but, they are trained and management  does keep a close eye on the process.   Equally important the baristas all have an   cool attitude: not too stuffy, not that feeling like they are doing you a favor by serving you your coffee.My drink of choice, brevé cortado:)",3,,1

He secured one of the tiny tables, and we hung out for a while. The space was nice, cozy and bustling without an overwhelming crowd.I had an iced coffee and a croissant. The coffee was great, the pastry serviceable, if a bit dull. In another life, I'm sure I'd depend on Blue Spoon. In this one, I'm glad it was there when I needed it.

After ten minutes, the guy who makes the drinks finally asked if I was waiting for a drink. I said i'd ordered a chai latte. He made it pretty quickly after that, and it's fine (not worth a ten minute wait). As I was leaving, I mentioned to the guy at the cash register that it had taken ten minutes for a chai latte, and that I can't wait that long for a tea drink before work. He sorta just stared at me, and then got into a conversation with his co-worker. I wasn't gonna wait to see how that ended up. They seemed nice-ish, but clueless, and didn't even get an ""i'm sorry"". I've got to say, though, that the coffee/tea drink maker guy did apologize when he saw me waiting, and everybody else was getting their order. Maybe, will give them a try again sometime.",,,

What put me off was the response that I got when I absentmindedly specified my size as ""grande."" I apologize that Starbucks is the only option near my home and that they've conditioned me to order in fake Italian, but I did choose to make a purchase here and not there.

All of their sandwiches come on ciabatta bread from Balthazar Bakery, but you can request multigrain if you prefer it. The smoked turkey sandwich comes with Brie, apples, mixed greens, and honey mustard, and you can ask for it to be toasted (because warm brie...mmmmm!). The sandwich was good, but I will note that the Dijon kind of overpowered the honey in the mustard, which overpowered the sandwich just a bit. (Brie is delicate...can you tell I really like Brie?) I enjoyed it anyway. The superstar in this coffee shop is the honey lavender latte, which gives the coffee the perfect amount of sweetness. It's unique and I love it.

I've only had the honey lavender latte but it is absolutely delicious and worth the $5-6. My only gripe about this place is that it does tend to be on the pricier side for lunch.

However, I did not try any of the baked goods, they looked fresh.  I think it's ashame the location is not open on weekends, it would probably get a fair amount of business due to the high traffic location of being in a residential spot.  I'm sure since the other location has good reviews, this one will do well too.  Hoping to stop by and try some other treats soon.",1,,2

One star is too many for this place.As a first time visitor, I cannot attest for their coffee, but the service SUCKS. There are many places who overcharges for their coffee, but at least those places have acceptable customer service. This place falls short of that, your money is better spent somewhere else.However, if you want to see two yuppies cut you in line as you patiently wait while their equally pretentious cashier people happily lets them do so, this is your coffee shop. Heaven forbid that you say something after the third cut attempt, they will stare at you as if you have two heads.Me: ""So are you going to let everyone cut in front of me?""Cashier girl: ""Oh well, she already bought something so sorry."" Unapologetic of their uppity behavior, still sans caffeine, I brought myself and my wallet to Financier down the block. I was able to purchase a cafe au lait with ease--it was great! If you are seeking Intelligentsia Coffee, there is an outpost at Herald Square. If you want dessert coffee in general, Bluestone and FIKA are nearby. Blue Spoon is expendable. Next office party, I'll stress to my office manager to never order from Blue Spoon and give the business to Financier instead.",,,

Let's just say, I wasn't expecting a food mecca in this area, but there are a few great places to check out. I don't drink too much coffee, maybe one cup a day, but when I do drink it, I want the good stuff. Meaning, I'm looking for a hipster/trendy shop where I am most likely going to shell out around $4 for a cold brew. Not a Starbucks or Dunkin, and especially not the crappy java from the work cafeteria.As I ventured out this morning looking for a caffeine boost, I opened up Yelp to see what was around. Unfortunately, my phone service is absolutely terrible around my office so I went for a short walk hoping to run into a decent place. Luckily, I ran into Blue Spoon (which is literally steps away from my office). Their outdoor sign enticed me as I read that they brew Intelligentsia coffee and offer breads and pastries from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela. I was immediately greeted with a smile at the counter and surprisingly there was no line. It's summer so I went for a cold brew ($4) and picked up a fresh piece of fruit, although I was extremely tempted to try the delicious looking pastries and bread from Balthazar and Ceci-Cela. I'm happy to have this place right around the corner from my office. I'm glad I ran into it when I did, otherwise I would be still walking all the way to Hudson Eats at Brookfield Place to grab a Stumptown cold brew from Black Seed.",1,3,1

Blue Spoon could be grouped into this category, but this little cafe is certainly one of the best ones in the area.I went to the William St location after it was recommended to me by a coworker, and I am glad that I did. They have a wide selection of coffees and teas, and since the skies started dumping buckets of water down when I was about a block away, a hot drink was just what I needed. I had the Moroccan mint tea and it was just fantastic. It was hard to choose from all of the tasty lunch options on the menu but the pleasant guy behind the counter made some helpful suggestions and was patient while I stood around trying to decide. I got the goat cheese panini and was incredibly pleased with my decision. The bread was toasty and crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The balsamic vinegar was perfectly proportioned over the cheese, roasted peppers, and basil (rather than drenched in it like I've found at many other restaurants) so the bread didn't get soggy.The atmosphere of Blue Spoon added to my reasons to return. It's corner location and walls of windows provide the perfect venue to people watch. It's also quiet and cozy, and since the the sidewalks were pretty empty during the downpour I appreciated the peaceful surroundings to hang out and read for a bit while I waited for the rain to let up.

The espresso and plain iced coffee here is perfect, smooth and rich. I love their intelligentsia brew of regular coffee.  I know coffee-snobs don't believe in sweet flavored drinks, BUT I love how Blue Spoon realizes that is what the trend is, their flavored drinks are perfectly balanced. They use Monin syrups, which is the only kind of syrup I drink for flavored stuff. I love their flavor combinations, such as the Honey Lavender latte, raspberry mocha and all winter I was hooked on the peppermint mocha. Every drink is made with care and attention, and you can taste that in every sip.Love the pastries (Balthazars almond croissant!!) The workers have always been friendly and a pleasant part of my mornings. I like the location it is in a very cute area of FiDi and the inside décor is modern yet elegant....All in all, a perfect way to start my busy mornings, and my favorite coffee place in FiDi.",,,
