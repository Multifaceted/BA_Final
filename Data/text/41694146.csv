0,Terry B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,19,18,5.0,11/14/2018,"I asked some friends for healthy food places in New York and Hu Kitchen was recommended.   I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the food.  I've been to other ""healthy"" restaurants and have left feeling unsatisfied by the taste.  I ordered their Paleo Bacon Egg & Cheese sandwich.  Yes it tasted like a paleo biscuit, but it was pretty good overall.  But their Jordy Chocolate Pancakes, delicious.  The place is spacious and there is enough seating that you won't feel crammed.  Plenty of healthy and tasty options. I read some of the other reviews about the staff being rude.  I didn't encounter anyone rude to me at least.  They seemed to be helpful and efficient.  Plus I'm not usually coming to a place to meet the staff, I'm coming to EAAAAAATTT!   None the less, I don't think you'll be at all disappointed in this place for quality taste, clean, and healthy options.  You can even bring your laptop and do work or chill.",,,

Those meatballs are to die for!! when you are gluten,dairy and soy free and you finally find a place where you can eat almost everything it's just amazing. To add on this food in Hu Kitchen is just delicious! and the portions are big too!I know what i'm having for dinner tonight, you?",1,,1
2,Victor P.,"Arabi, LA",130,15,4,2.0,10/7/2018,"FIRE RUDE EMPLOYEES!!!!!!!! The food is good and fairly priced; however, the service here is absolutely TERRIBLE. Today, the person at the counter was on her phone chatting with another employee while I waited over TEN minutes for a tea that I had already paid for. She was gossiping and taking photos the entire time while I was just standing there! I then asked her to please make the tea and she gave me the WORST attitude! She was incredibly rude. She then questioned me and tried to say that I had never paid for the tea, when I had done so before at the counter. She had to verify with the cashier that I had actually paid before she actually made the tea. No apologies for the wait. This is not the first bad experience that I have had here with the employees. Some are nice, but most are extremely rude. Please train your staff better or get new employees (or perhaps BOTH).",5,,
3,J. Lawrence N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",936,82,660,1.0,9/25/2018,"This is my first one-star review. But, it's well-deserved. This may be one of the worst restaurants in New York.This also will not be a particularly long review, because even just writing these three lines is bringing back images and memories that I wish I could forget.On first impressions, Hu seems like it's going to be a good meal. When you walk in, it seems to be a cool place. On first glance at the menu, it looks like it'll be delicious and healthy. But, looks can be deceiving. My friend and I order lunch. He went for the eggs benedict and I ordered a large bowl of the white bean soup. So, far it seems to be okay, but that where it all goes the other way.Hu is kind of a self serve place. Seating is upstairs, and it is FILTHY. Dirty dishes piled up high every where, with left over food, and all kinds of garbage. And you can't escape it because it's right there when you get upstairs, and ... wait for it .. it's where you have to go to get your water filled. Tables weren't wiped down. It was so wrong.Then comes the food. I made it through one spoonful of my $8 soup. It was so vile, I thought I was going to vomit on the spot. My friend's eggs Benedict was cold and sad. It had no taste and he didn't even finish it, and we was starving too.I don't know how or why the city's health department has closed this place down.",4,,3
4,Matt L.,"New York, NY",113,544,548,2.0,8/9/2018,"Barely passable.I think coming to this place only makes sense if you plan on sitting in the upstairs area, using the internet, and plan on posting up for a couple hours. Otherwise, there isn't really any reason to come here: the food is super bland and expensive for what it is.Since it's close to my church, I came here a few minutes before service began for some breakfast. I ordered a quinoa and a chicken 'curry', which really wasn't curry at all but instead some kind of soup with chicken in it. I was really looking forward to eating something that actually resembled an indian style chicken curry, so you can imagine how disappointed I was. What makes this worse is that I paid like $12 before tax, so the end product was actually really expensive. I say that because I got an incredibly small amount of food for $13, which is weird because I thought I'd be getting a little more food for the price.This place has a lot of those phony health mantras plastered all over the store, but if they can't even offer good tasting products at a reasonable price, there's no point in trying to win people on marketing. I would come back if I wanted to use the upstairs space since it's sort of nice, but the food offerings here are atrocious.",6,3,3
5,Laura C.,"Hoboken, NJ",96,113,10,2.0,9/26/2018,"I come here when I have class.  They have decent food options and you can get a home cooked meal here.  It's also a good place to go if you wanna get some work done.But the service is not very good.  I tried to order a bowl and there was no one working at the station.  I had to flag someone down to get my order.  I tried to order a bowl with falafel or tofu, and they didn't have either.  They gave me raw veggies instead.  Not what I wanted.  Plus the pricing is awful. But if you're looking for a place to sit and study while you eat, this is a good choice.  Plus there's a student discount.",1,,
6,Katie C.,"Portland, OR",111,127,64,1.0,6/2/2018,"It breaks my heart to write this review, but I really did not enjoy my experience here. I've eaten paleo for 4 years and respect restaurants that serve healthy food made with whole ingredients. I really vibe with Hu's mission to bring back real food. Which is why I was so excited to finally visit NYC and dine with them! I came around lunch time and decided to get a hot meal. I chose the veggie lasagna with a side of pineapple. Unfortunately the lasagna was as dry as it looks in the photograph. I'm not sure if it had been sitting under the heating lamp for a long time, but it was not good. Even if it had been moist, there was a lack of flavor. It was unremarkable. The pineapple was good for the first few bites, but got to be too sweet after the third bite. And I was served such a large portion! I chose the stuffed mushroom and stuffed squash to take home with me. The squash was good! A solid choice. But I was very disappointed by the mushroom. The entire top layer had been burnt which imparted a burnt flavor to the rest of the filling, which included a disproportionate ratio of walnuts. It was basically a mushroom stuffed with burnt walnuts. The shining star was the curried sweet potato. SO delicious. I regret only getting a small cup's worth! The chocolate bar was also good! I spent nearly $50 on these items. I understand that quality food is expensive, but the taste wasn't there to support the price. If all items had been as good as the curried sweet potato, I'd have gladly paid that amount!",5,,
7,Dia Q.,"New York, NY",123,99,201,3.0,9/5/2018,"This is similar to your typical bowl place. You walk into this huge, spacious restaurant with a really good layout. They have the coffee/drinks counter right in front for faster service. The decor is rustic modern. It can be quite loud due to the high ceilings. Next to coffee, they have an additional grab and go refrigerated case. The service was inconsistent. The guy who took my food order was really friendly and patient having been my first time here. They only had one cashier available, who was training someone new. That's ok but they had morepeople available to take orders when it wasn't that busy. Cashier took her time with the customer before me, causing me to feel like my life being wasted. I didn't say anything and was patient. However, she was very short with me. A please and thank can go a long way but none of that from her. She was nicer to the man before me though. The food is good, nothing more spectacular than any other bowl place but more expensive. I do like that you can order just a protein with no sides, which I wish more places would do, but I could have had a more filling meal for the price I paid for just the meatloaf. The meatloaf I got was very enjoyable. Still hot, good texture and held on its own. The sauce was tasty, slight spice but reminded me more of a tomato sauce than a BBQ sauce. Still very good. I won't say I'd never come back here but perhaps would try other options in the area.",1,,
8,Silvia B.,"Boston, MA",48,1,0,1.0,11/17/2018,"The turkey sliders were dry and disgusting, they reminded me of airline food. The stuffed avocado looked nice but it was all brown inside, at more than $10/avocado, they could have put more care to make sure it was fresh when sold! I also bought some cashew snacks that I have not eaten yet, I'll update when I do. The girl at the cashier couldn't care less, she was talking to someone else while processing my payment. I won't be back.",,,

Updated review","Service is tough...had a recent experience where the restaurant was nearly empty and it took em 15 mins to make a bacon egg and cheese. The staff is quite friendly, but I get the sense they're overtasked and underpaid. And they use so much packaging...particularly plastic. You'd think given how they think and talk about their philosophy on food/eating, they'd also give a sh*t about the Earth. They kinda go hand in hand.",,,
10,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",18,258,0,2.0,6/30/2018,"I stopped by Hu Kitchen because I was craving something healthy and was tired of going to Whole Foods for the millionth time. Unfortunately, while the offerings sound and look delicious, the portions are laughably small and the menu is downright misleading at times. I got the bowl with root mash and green curry chicken, which I was disappointed to find far smaller than a standard entree size (despite the fact that it was $10.99). The curry lacked any sort of spice that is typical of green curry, the puree was borderline watery, and most frustratingly, there was literally one small chunk of chicken in the entire portion. I also got an avocado kale salad as a side. The container I received had listed the ingredients in the salad, with avocado as the FIRST line item, yet wasn't a single piece of avocado in the salad. The funniest part about the whole meal is that you get your food on a giant metal tray that almost looks like the prison trays they used in Orange is the New Black. I don't mind paying a little more for healthy food, but there was zero substance to the meal at Hu Kitchen-- it was lacking on the flavors, portions, presentation, and ingredients, and I couldn't help but leave the restaurant feeling frustrated and ripped off.",5,2,2
11,Kaitlyn O.,"Queens, NY",120,66,171,5.0,4/5/2018,I came here today for the first time and I was not disappointed.The store is immaculate. I ordered the mashed cauliflower with vegetarian bean chili on top. Absolutely delicious. $10.99 for a bowl but it is very filling. Next time I go I am going to try the chocolate and the coffee.,,,1
12,Laura B.,"New York, NY",298,78,85,5.0,1/7/2018,"Ooh, I'm itchin to tell you who's smitten with Hu Kitchen.Ok, it's me.Not really sure if I buy the whole Paleo trend (didn't our ancestors have a really low life-expectancy...?), but if you ignore the buzzy-ness (and the fake cave paintings on the wall), it seems like they have pretty solid ideas about health. No refined sugar, and veggies take center stage!I've tried almost everything here and have never been disappointed. All the hot sides are SO GOOD - the hot cauliflower puree is creamy and warm and out of this world (I really wonder where the cave-dwelling early humans plugged in the food processor? Do caves have outlets?). You also have to get the roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli! AND THEN. Get some brussels to go. Prepare for lots of compliments as you begin to glow from all the veggies you must eat here.With friends, it's a great place to bond over healthy food and cool vibes and tell life stories. I've done this many times. Something about the Grandmaster Veg is so warm and comforting that it makes people open up and spew their soul. Even alone, I come here to snack, sit, read, snack and use the wifi until I'm hungry enough to start snacking again. If my friends don't drag me out, I think I could spend the whole day here.Their coffee is amazing, and their housemade almond milk is AmAzInG, and their housemade coconut milk is AHHHMAZING! You have to stop in, get coffee, and pour that milk in there. Trust me.",5,3,2

Updated review","After a bad experience the first time (most likely because I had bad company), now Hu Kitchen is one of my favorite healthy places that I know I cannot go wrong with no matter what I order. I've tried so many of their desserts and hot meals. I don't have to worry about finding foods that fit within my dietary restrictions because everything is Paleo and refined-sugar free which I love. Dessert wise, Hu Kitchen sells my favorite dark chocolate, carrot cake, vanilla cupcake with blackberry frosting, and crack bar! The curry chicken, cauliflower ""fried rice,"" assorted market vegetables, and meatloaf are all amazing too. I can't wait to come back and try more menu options!!",1,1,
14,James R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,20,0,1.0,10/22/2018,Coming here always puts me in a bad mood. The food might be non-toxic but the atmosphere certainly isn't. What IS it that makes the staff here so unbelievably rude?I try to not let bad energy affect me but I've had one too many cashiers roll their eyes and disdain my very existence for absolutely no reason.Small portions. Cold food. Rude staff. Was a dedicated customers and now I'm done.,3,,

16,Sabrina S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",216,3,2,4.0,10/28/2018,"I eat here often, and I'm gonna be honest - because the food is paleo and everything has natural, ethical, basic ingredients, it can taste a bit bland or uber-healthy at times. HOWEVER, my stomach has never felt better. It's insane how great I feel after eating here. I usually get a coffee (organic, which is an absolute must) or hot matcha with one of their baked goods. It's a total of 8$ and I feel great for the rest of the day. You dont realize how terrible gluten and chemicals make you feel until you try this!",,,1
17,Rachael D.,"Merritt Island, FL",0,5,0,1.0,11/13/2018,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. This place is the worst. Terrible customer flow, TERRIBLE customer service.

They are farm to table dedicated to quality- even cooking oils(no soy or canola here, coconut is king). Wild Meatloaf: amazing. Super flavorful, hearty, warm, and comforting without being overly salty or fatty. They gave two pieces of the meatloaf. Paired with the caramelized cinnamon-y pineapple, it's a super satisfying savory-sweet meal. If you want a treat after, their cashew butter chocolate bars are divine.Made me feel energized despite waking at at 5:30AM for boot camp, so you know it's good. There is also tons of seating here, an upstairs area, and it's warm and cozy.",2,1,2

Updated review",I am gonna break up definitely  with Hu also. I am totally agree with the reviewer JudieThe food was excellent  few years ago. I was so pleased with employees and service was top notch. Now even the Barista -Delisha- an African American lady that like to gossip behind clients or other employees- has an attitude or hate towards me and felt bothered when I used to ask her to do a lemon ginger tea .Hu has only the honey lemon ginger available unfortunatelyI am also agree with the reviewer Judie. The portions are small and the quality  needs to be revised. After today I have decided to shop somewhere  else. I will not recommend  this place to anyone and will give my money to another business that value customer service.There is so many options out thereDelisha was the last straw tonight but also I was questioning my sponsorship last few months cause of the quality of the food. You need to listen to your  customers  or your business will go down.Very angry,1,2,
20,Brenda W.,"Manhattan, NY",12,56,0,5.0,9/11/2018,Food is great! Paleo friendly. The chef Brian is always making new and exciting dishes. We have been coming here for years. The only downfall is some of the staff has gone downhill especially the servers. You sort of feel like you are in the post office they don't really careHopefully they can remedy this..,,,
21,Paige H.,"New York, NY",14,183,17,4.0,3/19/2018,"Came here for dinner with a girlfriend and was very pleased. I'm on Whole30 and have been cooking at home, mostly, but this friend lives in pretty far from me. We decided to meet in the middle and I researched Whole30-friendly restaurants and this was the top result. It was delicious, everything was fresh, but not everything is Whole30 compliant... You definitely still have to read the ingredients. The almond crusted chicken was amazing, and the sweet potatoes. The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because two of the people behind the counter were rather rude, especially the short, smaller guy. I'll be back, even after Whole30 is over!",2,,
22,Jane K.,"New York, NY",20,25,1,2.0,10/7/2018,"I'm such a slut for vegan organic gluten free shit, and some stuff has been good that I have gotten here, but some stuff has been awful. No matter what, it's EXPENSIVE. Once I got the meatloaf and honestly, I couldn't finish it because it was GROSS. Just awful. Seriously. I got a super expensive trail mix here once that was good, but I cant afford to come here anymore.",1,,
23,Claudia C.,"Miller Place, NY",22,115,113,4.0,9/23/2017,"Okay so I'll start with the aesthetic because that's the first thing I noticed when I walked in. It's a really wonderful blend of earthy and urban and there is a great usage of space which I really liked!In fact the whole concept was really interesting and I liked the wide variety of food they had to offer as well as the prices (which were fair). It was nice to know that basically everything you're eating there is healthy and organic. Hi Kitchen really had everything, from food you can quickly grab and go, a selection of hot foods, a juice bar, and hot brunch! The one thing I didn't like too much was the order process, it was a little stressful/confusing for a first timer. There are three different check out areas and half the time we were there, no one was even manning them. Also they give you an illegible meal ticket and a buzzer when you order your food, you then pay and bring the ticket and buzzer back then get another copy of the ticket to keep (the receipt) and it was just a little hard to figure out where to go at first. Bonus points though because there is a 10% student discount! I'll definitely be back to try more of their food selection.",1,1,
24,Ashley V.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,140,390,4.0,8/19/2017,"Intrigued at the thought of a completely paleo restaurant, I made a special trip here after my workout to grab dinner. I follow keto rather than paleo, so while there are plentiful healthy options I was still somewhat limited in my choices -- I ended up going with a bowl: cauliflower puree as base with mushrooms & grass-fed beef on top and a small side of the summer slaw. I've gotta say, it was delicious! They also provide you with a small piece of faux-caccia (I'm not 100% sure on the ingredients so I'm not really sure if it's keto-friendly, but I was told it was made with almond flour so I went for it anyway. YOLO!)This place is an appropriately priced NYC establishment and it's nice to have a non-salad place where you can feel good about what you've just eaten. I'd definitely return to try a few other things, but I really wish they would put additional nutrition information for those of us tracking macros. The set up is sort of cafeteria style, where you first choose your food behind the bar, then take your tray to the cashier to pay. There's also an upstairs section with additional seating. I love that this place exists as an option and hope it sticks around awhile!",3,1,1
25,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",135,110,275,3.0,2/22/2018,"I use to come to Hu Kitchen all the time because it has a pretty selection for Whole30 compliant foods however the service and quality has gone down since I first started coming here in 2016. The service and quality of food is a hit or miss nowadays. Their meatloaf, root mash, and chicken wings were our favorites when it was good. Hopefully they will improve their quality control because when it was good, it was good.",2,1,1
26,Sunny X.,"Washington, DC",31,368,740,4.0,9/17/2017,"I checked out this place during my trip to NYC because I tried their chocolate and really like it. It has a cute front end with seating and a juice bar. If you go to the end, you will see prepared food, a bowl station, and food station to prepare your orders. There are so many choices and everything looks great! I only bought two chocolates because I am no very hungry but surely everything looks good. They only use real food as ingredients and I firmly believe in this philosophy. The cashier was not very welcoming or looked happy. No greetings and she seemed indifferent.

These are my portions? But as I'm typing this-I'm actually pretty full!Def say yes to the focaccia bread for satiety insurance. I believe stuff here is all paleo so its made of almond flour? Not bad. The flavoring was on point and texture came pretty close.I think the key to this place is to adjust expectations for a paleo / health conscious place.

I got the grandmaster veg, which tasted essentially like a piece of dry lasagna you'd get a school cafeteria. The sweet potatoes are alright, but certainly not mind blowing.

Then, they give me brown side of over-ripe inedible avo that they are so upset about re-serving. Okay, that's that. They were out of chicken sausage, so they gave me chicken that comes with the crepe, and it's more cartilage than chicken.

The side of green veggies with kale was not very good. I will not be getting that again. The root mash and the cauliflower mash were both alright. Their broccoli is pretty bad, too; it's super dry. They should do some like cauliflower fried rice or brussel sprouts or spaghetti squash or something. The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is mainly for the service. It really sucked. Example: My dad and I were waiting in line to pay for a few minutes. We would have called someone over, but everyone was busy. Then, I noticed one guy (white, short, and dark brown hair) looking at us, so I told him that we would like to pay please. And only then does he tell us that we need to go to the other register because that one is closed. Seriously? Why wouldn't he just say that before I told him we wanted to pay? He was rude. Then we had to wait in line for another 5 minutes to pay. Took forever. Then we didn't get any water cups, our table upstairs was dirty, and they didn't have any plates for us (we ate off of to-go containers). Overall, it just seemed very disorganized.",3,1,1
39,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",12,229,363,4.0,6/15/2018,"I really like this place-- it kind of reminds me of Whole Foods, but seems slightly more uppity due to the fact that it's literally ~everything free~.  They have a lot of awesome choices & even if you aren't paleo you'll be able to find something you're interested in.  The portions are also very fair & comparable to other fast casual healthy eateries in the area-- something I was surprised by given the quality of ingredients.  I ordered the plat with two sides: meatloaf, cauliflower ""no fry"" rice, and pineapple.  They give you two massive slices of really delicious meatloaf, and the ""no fry"" rice was kinda greasy seeming, but tasty overall.  The pineapple had an interesting cinnamon-y seasoning but I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.  The prices of some of the baked goods and desserts are a little ridiculous but items in the hot bar are pretty reasonable.The employees here are so rude though.  All the people I interacted with seemed like they were so annoyed that I was ordering food and the lady serving me got mad at me when I asked what one of the sides were.  Overall good food, but somewhat uncomfortable experience when it comes to customer service as it seems like all the employees really hate their jobs.",2,2,

I was in a rush and didn't have time to wait on line again and redo it, so I just ate it, though it was pretty bad ans I didn't finish it.My next time, I ordered a bacon avocado ""breakfast bowl."" They severely skimped on the materials and preparation - just a few pieces of spinach drenched in oil, a soft-boiled egg that wasn't even slice or prepared in anyway - it just sat on top - and some crumpled bacon bits. I could have made this on my own, and better, and far more substantially, for a fraction of the cost. I ended up having to get more food because it wasn't enough for a meal.I finally found a routine here I liked - getting chicken tenders, a small side of veggie Cobb salad, and one other side from the cold prepared food areas. Normally the woman is very nice and shows me the portion sizes, and I spend between $10-$13.Today, however, was my last straw and why I won't be returning to Hu Kitchen.I followed my usual cold bar routine, and this time when they rung me up, the bill was $20. How in the world do you charge somebody $20 for a cold lunch? I explained I ordered the same thing each day, and they said it's done by the weight. I explained that I knew that and it has never come out to this amount before, but they didn't offer to remedy that in anyway.I paid for it, which was a mistake, I should have had them throw it out and gone elsewhere.

Could totally stock up on dinners or lunch for the week here. I decided to make a bowl. Half root mash and half raw veggies as my base with curry chicken on top and almonds and parsley with a side of fauxacia bread. The bowl was pure flavor town. Definitely coming back here.

I'll call to ask about specials, and I get a tone of resentment like god forbid they had to find out. Last time I called I asked about the new chocolate bars. The girl on the phone had no idea what I was talking about. Yet they were just on Hu's instagram. She had no intention of finding out the answer to my question.

The staff was rude, we were told you can no longer have Taylor Hu as a side when you always been able to in the past, no buzzers so the counter said ""just check back in 10 mins"", only to actually be 25 mins until the eggs were ready (which is crazy!). And when we got our food, it was the wrong order. The almond truffle balls are delicious but the past few weekends they have run out by 4pm.

The staff is helpful, the ingredients are honest, and the flavors are heavenly. For someone looking for a Paleo/Whole 30/Non-Processed/Non-GMO spot to eat, I can give no greater recommendation than Hu Kitchen. There are also a large selection of drinks and take out items that are made in-house with labels of all ingredients in plain view. Be advised, this is the kind of place where you order at the counter, pick up your food, and take it to your table. If you're looking for a sit-down wait-service kind of shtick, this is not it.

At Hu Kitchen, the only thing I sacrifice is a couple extra dollars (yes, it is expensive, but unfortunately healthy food usually is a tad pricer). I rotate between the rotisserie chicken and the savory and flavorful meatloaf. My go-to side dish is unwaveringly the assorted market vegetables, which are leafy, crunchy, and a tad garlicky. I never have guilt whenever I leave Hu Kitchen, I on the other hand, feel reenergized and confident in what I ate. PS- Get extra hot sauce on ereeeethang. So good.",,,
60,Ariel S.,"New York, NY",394,107,57,4.0,9/5/2017,"First off I have to acknowledge the brand and design of this place. The concept is really tantalizing and drew me in while walking on 14th St. Their physical place is gorgeous--forest meets NYC chic (basically my aesthetic). They really drive home their philosophy of whole unprocessed foods with this branding and I have to say it works incredibly well.Aside from design their food is phenomenal. Its everything I imagined local and unprocessed food would taste like. The flavor profiles aren't necessarily creative but I guess their selling point is the quality--they already get creative points for branding and design. I had the Israeli Lentil and Quinoa salad and it was worthy of any authentic tabouli-like foods (or foods that taste similar to that).I couldn't resist their chocolate (which are all naturally plant-based) and I have to say its in my top 3 of all time favorite vegan chocolates. I had the banana crunch and almond butter flavors--crazy delicious. I highly recommend anyone try at least the chocolate if they visit Hu. I can't in good conscious give Hu 5 stars because of the ludicrous prices (one bar of chocolate was like $6 and the lentil dish $13). I assume the prices are sky high now because they're new, but I really hope they can bring it down in the near future.

I heard the bacon was to die for, so I got that and it wasn't as great as what I'd hoped for. The bacon had a very strange texture and the taste was a bit off. It was pretty thick though and you can't beat good quality bacon regardless! My one real complaint is that Hu Kitchen is very small. They're ready for another location! I wish it was the size of a whole block, really, but I know that's impossible in New York. The bathroom lines are super long and the lines to order food are super long. Bathrooms on both floors. Know what you're getting beforehand! They make a lot of amazing things in house. When we came, I stocked up on juice, snacks, etc.If you come here, I highly suggest getting in line early and taking the food right out of there. Since it's such a hot spot, it gets super crowded and it's a bit annoying to dine in. It's still nice though!

Overall I love the concept. They are really paleo friendly, which is the way I am eating now. They offer an array of grain, gluten and dairy free foods from baked goods to prepared items, I just wish it was all a little easier to navigate and there was a cleaner area to sit and enjoy the food. I ordered a hot bowl with a base of root vegetable mash and topped with with shredded chicken or what they call chicken pot pie. It was hearty and filling even though it was a smaller portion.

Jokes aside, Hu Kitchen is a great concept restaurant for organic, paleo ""healthy"" dining. They have a very contemporary decor design mixed with wood/earthy chairs, wall coverings, tables to add into that organic vibe. They're split into two levels with very crowded and limited seating in both upstairs and the main lobby area. My girlfriend and I came here as our second option for brunch as the Grey Dog a few min walk away had too long of a wait and we were starving. We ordered the T.H.A.C Hugel and the Breakfast Burrito along with one OJ and one coconut coffee blend they had. (Total bill was over $32!) both the food portions were very small and were bland tasting and not filling. I've never seen my girlfriend use so much hot sauce and she hates hot sauce lol. I wanted to enjoy this place but I found it very difficult with the unsatisfying food choices we ordered, the cramped space and high price. We were still very hungry after the meal. While I think the concept of Hu Kitchen is nice, it definitely feels like one of those places that is going with the ""healthy eating"" trends and taking advantage of those who want to eat ""healthier"" with high prices, nice decor and small portions.

They were out of kale so I subbed spinach in in the Wrath of Rosenberg smoothie and added collagen. The smoothie was far thinner than I'd like, but that's fine. Their food was what made it worth it though. Per my friend's recommendation, I got the two eggs two sides - 2 scrambled eggs with sweet potato hash and roasted broccoli with their house made bread subbed in for the biscuit. Also per her recommendation, I got a side of all the sauces. The sauces were amazing. Like actually, best sauces ever. From the hot sauce, to the cashew cream, to the BBQ sauce and ketchup, it was all flavorful and complemented the meal perfectly. Price-wise, the meal was very reasonable. It was a lot of food for about $10. They also have a mashbar, to go foods, paleo snacks, coffee and tea, and desserts. Next time, I'd skip the smoothie and just fill up on the food.

There is never anyone that can help you, especially at the cold food counter. I've gone to the hot food, the chicken soup is the BEST! And the people who work there are too busy to even turn around and when they do they act as if you're inconveniencing them. People at the registers are always super nice and available. I want to love this place for the fabulous place that it is but when I don't have the time or tolerance I sometimes have to choose somewhere else to eat unfortunately.",,,
82,Kerrie D.,"Portland, ME",273,431,965,4.0,5/7/2017,"I was in the area and looking for PROTEIN.  Read the Yelp reviews and while I don't eat Paleo exclusively, it is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.It was around 1:00 in the afternoon and Hu Kitchen was PACKED.  People streaming in and out of the entrance, lines inside waiting to order/pay and a completely packed eating area (cancel my plan of sitting for a minute).Realizing I would be getting take-out, I opted for easy street food and ordered an almond butter banana smoothie and a chia seed pudding.  Both were well made with fresh ingredients, but set me back close to $17!  I did check out the prepared food section and while everything looked great, the prices kept me from going further.On the other hand, this is NYC and I don't know of any other place catering so directly to the Paleo crowd.  I might suggest going at an off time if you want to spend more time looking around.",1,,

Everything was very tasty and pretty good portions. I would have liked a little more beef but overall they gave a good portion. The root mash was delish! We also had the almond butter cookie dough hazelnut bites (I think that's what they were called). They were soooo good and hit the spot. We will definitely be back!",,,

It was super light and flavorful. My only downfall is that a small bowl is $11 which I found to be kind of a rip.

I have been to Hu Kitchen a handful of times, because the food is worth going back for and I wanted to give a fair shake, in case I just hit them on an off-day. But good grief, every time I've gone back I have a similar experience. The staff is rude, uncommunicative, and unmotivated and I leave in a grumpy mood. Unfortunately, it's not worth it to deal with so I won't be coming back. I'll stick with Springbone, which provides similar type/quality of food but with great service and doesn't make me leave feeling like I inconvenienced them by supporting their business. If you do want to give it a shot, make sure you're allowing about 3x as long as you think it should take.",1,,

The name always threw me off, ""Is it a Chinese restaurant?"" and it wasn't until a friend brought me that I realized what was REALLY on the menu. Come for the rotisserie chicken and the heavenly grilled pineapple with cashew cream sauce. Also, the bowls - cauliflower mash, ground beef, root mash (mushrooms, I think?) and hot sauce, YUM. It's the perfect filling meal on a cold winter night. Oh, and don't leave without their dark chocolate bars.

Both were decent. I don't think I would come here for a sit-down dinner or group outing, but I'd come back here for a healthy to-go meal when I don't have time to cook.",,,
92,Maggie G.,"Manhattan, NY",214,10,0,3.0,8/7/2017,"Let me begin by saying I go to Hu every morning (yes - 7 days a week) for breakfast/coffee, and a few nights a week for dinner. Not only is it conveniently located between my apartment and subway, but the food is REALLY delicious and reasonably priced. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of the food and the mission to bring clean eating to the city, so food = 5 stars.However, I can't give Hu 5 stars because I give the service here 1-2 stars. This should tell you how good the food is, because there's no way I would put up with the service every day if it wasn't. First of all, the ordering system is really poorly run and inefficient. Generally, there are no less than 7-8 employees working the hot bar/kitchen. Yet, it is more often than not that I walk up to the counter and get ignored by every single one of them for 2+ minutes before someone walks over and decides to take my order. To be clear, employees can see I'm waiting, and there's never a friendly ""I'll be right with you"" or some other explanation as to why it takes so long to acknowledge customers. Either there isn't a clear division of responsibilities (AKA employee 1 takes orders, employee 2 prepares orders, etc.) or the staff needs serious customer service training. I'm not trying to be overly critical, but if you're in a hurry in the morning, they are not quick!Which brings me to my next point. Anything that is not already prepared, like eggs, can take an unnecessarily long amount of time to make. Considering the number of staff they have working the kitchen, you'd think they would be quicker. Not to mention, it is simple math that the more food they can get through, the more money they make! But alas, speed is not their strong point!! Note for patrons in a hurry, order only food already prepared. (I would highly recommend the pineapple.) Lastly, checking out and ordering coffee/smoothies (all one stop), is another place that needs work. The person checking you out also takes your coffee/smoothie/muffin order which usually means yelling it out to someone else as you order it. This leads to a long backlog and confusion over people's orders when there's a line. But the crack coffee is worth it! Seriously, try it!My last point, which shows how inefficient the check out process is, is that I order the exact same thing every day for breakfast. But somehow, my total can range anywhere from $11-17 dollars depending day - yes, for the exact same order. I don't know how it can fluctuate that drastically, and I figure since I go there so much, it all kind of evens out. But one of us is on the losing end of that deal! I have had to ask for an itemized receipt multiple times because of the inconsistency.To reiterate, I love the food, and I love the mission. I want Hu to succeed!! But they really need to improve their customer service and efficiency if they want to attract a larger customer base. The experience could be improved SO MUCH by making a few changes!!",6,1,

Updated review","My office ordered delivery from Hu Kitchen and had an OK experience with it. We ordered the baked chicken tenders, fish sticks, grain-free Caesar salad, Mediterranean salad, summer slaw, roasted cauliflower salad, roasted brussels sprouts, and stuffed squash. The chicken tenders were really mushy and not even slightly crispy, but we were pleasantly surprised by the fish sticks. We were fearful that we had underordered at first because it didn't appear to be a lot of food, but we ended up with plenty. I've dined in at Hu before and preferred it to the delivery experience, but that's almost always the case.",1,,
111,Kevin J.,"Union City, NJ",0,1,0,2.0,3/16/2018,"My girlfriend and I visited Hu Kitchen for lunch recently after I had ordered delivery multiple times in the past. This was our first time eating in the restaurant.  The good:Food is delicious and there are countless healthy options. It is the most paleo friendly eatery I have ever seen. We got a cauliflower mash bowl with green curry, the roasted sweet potato, caramelized pineapple, and the broccoli. The curry and caramelized pineapple stole the show. Both were delicious and the cashew cream on the pineapple is amazing. A large amount of seating as well. Their crack coffee was not bad either. However, be aware it is pricey and can add up fast. For two, with a beverage you can expect to spend between $30-$40.The bad:I may not return to Hu Kitchen purely for the rude manner that several employees exhibited towards us. While saying I wanted to get three sides, I was told ""talk to me"". My girlfriend stated that the person behind the counter was very inpatient as well. While walking up the stairs with a tray of food in my hands an employee moved aside at the top to let me go. A kind gesture yes, until he started rolling his hands in the air telling me to hurry up. I would prefer not to be rushed up the short steps while I am carrying a heavy tray. Upstairs the situation for the trays and garbage is odd. You must separate your plates, bowls, silverware, and trays. This is fine but the area needed to be cleared as it was too full. It is also slightly odd that you can not get any of the items from the cold bar heated up in the restaurant. Lastly, the space could be a little cleaner. Final thoughts:Hu Kitchen is a haven for those looking for a healthy choice or on the paleo diet. Food is delicious and you feel satisfied and energized after you eat it. However, the extremely rude service is the sole reason why I will not be back. Especially considering you are spending a premium. If you want to try their great food, and avoid the bad vibes, I would recommend their delivery.",,,

Also very honest, listing all the ingredients for all the meals, especially the ones for the takeout. They have lots of options for meals- can get it as a bowl, on a grain free wrap, deli section, etc. I decided to get a bowl with broccoli, carrot, and cauliflower cole slaw with Hu ground beef and onion & puffed quinoa. Looked small at 1st but very filling and the bowl was pretty deep. The slaw was not watery which I really appreciated. Also every meal comes with grain free bread that tasted like it had a zucchini base. It was so small but pretty good.The sweets are really awesome especially for a cuisine that is a bit limited. They are known for their mash bar but we got apple cinnamon bar and almond butter cookies. OMG the almond butter cookies are to die for, so smooth and creamy mmmmm. Definitely top priority.

Maybe Hu could combine both cafes like the city's 80/20 program...although I imagine a place like Hu demanding separate entrances for the less affluent.",2,,
122,Mary L.,"San Francisco, CA",317,150,163,3.0,12/4/2016,"My first encounter with Hu Kitchen was when a friend brought me some of their ""paleo"" chocolate after her trip to NYC. So when I was making a trip to NYC I knew I wanted to check it out for myself. A few other friends had talked it up as well, so I had high expectations.First, I went there for breakfast with a friend. We both ordered the dish that came with two eggs and two sides. I got two eggs over easy (they don't do poached eggs, which is my favorite style of eggs), and then sautéed greens and some roasted veggie medley. My friend got the sides, roasted pineapple with cashew cream, and sweet potato hashbrowns. The veggie sides were cold, which was a bit of a let down. The plate came with a paleo biscuit, which was nice to use to make a little egg sandwich with the eggs and veggie sides. Still, with the coldness of the veggies, I was disappointed.Later in my trip I went there for a late lunch. I got a bowl, with a base of mashed sweet potato, carrots, squash and parsnips, and cauliflower puree (think mashed potatoes, but with cauliflower), topped with grass-fed meat and tomato and roasted mushrooms. It was a healthy portion and definitely filling! And a bit warmer than the breakfast I had tried there earlier. I sat there and ate lunch while getting some work done - they do have free WiFi, but I struggled to find an outlet to power my laptop.A couple hours after my lunch I met up with a friend there and decided to try one of their chia pudding bowls. I chose the vanilla chia pudding as the base, and topped it with strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, toasted coconut, and almond butter. It was fun to get a dessert that didn't use refined sugar, and reflected something I would make at home for breakfast or a sweet treat. The chia pudding wasn't too sweet, which is good. It was sweetened with date, which I prefer to maple syrup. I'd even love to see an unsweetened chia pudding option, so that people can choose to add honey or sweetener to it if they prefer (the fruit topping and almond butter would've made it sweet enough for me). The almond butter had a weird flavor to me. Like the flavor of almond butter after it sits too long. My friend ordered the banana almond smoothie/milk shake, which he liked.Another point during my time in NYC I stopped in to grab an afternoon snack. I wanted some protein and vegetables, so I got one of the salmon cakes, a couple of the spicy chicken wings, and a small side of the roasted brussel sprouts. The salmon cakes were a bit dry and I didn't taste the salmon in them. The chicken wings had decent flavor, but I wouldn't get them again. The texture was mushy, maybe because they weren't fresh and had been sitting in the cold case for awhile. Maybe they'd be better if they were heated/crisped up in an oven. The brussel sprouts were simple, which I like (brussel sprouts don't need much when you're roasting them), and out of the three they are the only I would get again.Ambiance-wise, it's a big space with lots of seating. I did see it fill up, but never struggled to find a seat. The restroom was messy each time I used it. They change the lighting depending on the time of day. In the evenings it's a bit darker, which I guess is great if you are looking for a place that feels fancy and more intimate, even though it's still a more fast-casual dining experience. The customer service could use some improvement. I felt a general sense of ""don't bother me"" from the staff I interacted with. Everyone seems busy and distracted and not necessarily interested or willing to really care about the customer's needs. I even had to ask someone to fill up the water dispensers upstairs after him and other staff members passed it empty a couple of times (something I'd expect them to see and change without someone needing to ask).If you're looking for healthy, gluten-free, paleo, vegan, quick food options near Union Square, this is a great option! Get a mashbowl if you want something warm, and get a chia pudding concoction with toppings of your choice if you want something sweet. And if you're OK with cold food, grab something from their ""to-go"" case, or get their breakfast side options.",1,,

130,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2673,3521,16559,3.0,6/24/2015,"On name basis alone, it would have been to easy to dismiss Hu Kitchen as another Americanized Chinese takeout spot. Instead, the place is quite the opposite of a cheap-o Chinese takeout, but is instead a pricey haven for health nuts with a cause. Who knew? Hu knew.The concept might be a little too cerebral for most folks, but the crap we eat on a daily basis is so far and away from the organic, paleo, healthy concoctions that HK provides. The latter is the kind of food that would bring us closer to being ""human"" again, with an emphasis on minimally processed, non-GMO, and the whole responsible sourcing that comes with eating clean. From that perspective, I can give Hu Kitchen a high five.The place is deceivingly large. Two floors with a majority of the seating on the second level and hot/cold food stations that serve food up in fast casual fashion. I don't know if I'd come here with a group, but this is one of those places where it's perfect for dining alone. The place is clean and the funky furniture makes for a nice bonus.Too often ""healthy"" food is boring and lacks flavor, but HK has done a nice job in keeping things relatively tasty even if a lot of the items don't look all that appealing. The organic chicken is juicy, though the skin gets a tad thin / slimy at times. Another protein packed meat is their wild meatloaf, which contains organic beef and wild elk, also pretty solid but the portion leaves much to be desired (which is the case with most of their stuff).I also report good findings in the roasted brussel sprouts, kale salads, berkshire pork meatballs, cauliflower rice, and caramelized pineapple + cashew cream side. Soups are also an easy sell, especially the veggie chili and organic chicken + quinoa. If I were able to afford the wild salmon cakes (pricey at $26/Ib), I'd probably get them every time.  The food is good and deserves a chance from naysayers who are iffy about the whole Hu Kitchen experience. Hence, conceptually they'd be 5 stars. No place is truly perfect, and the pricing is doesn't always fit the fast casual mode. Soups are served in a one sized cup for $7, seafood gets into $20s range per pound, and set dinners range from $15-23. It's easy to come in and order a few items and ring up $25+ on the register. Whole Foods much? Budget seekers might be safe to steer clear.But pricing comes with the territory right? That's not the biggest beef. Instead, it boils down to the service and staff. Lackluster attitudes, wrongly prepared meals, and accidental overcharges make it very frustrating to come here at times. The attitudes don't reflect a place where everything is supposed to make one feel nice and healthy. I am guessing the busy lunch hours leave em jaded and unmotivated.",11,11,8

No phone call asking if they could offer me something else, no attempt to make it right. Even further, when I called the restaurant to ask them to initiate a refund through Caviar they basically told me that was my responsibility (aka problem). Yet, when I called the customer service at Caviar there was an option for restaurants who wanted to make edits to orders. Basically the manager on duty is improperly trained or just plain lazy.

They claim that all of  their food is free of GMOs, soy, canola oil, refined sugars and preservatives and they use a minimal amount of dairy and grain. Their poultry and eggs are organic.I typically come here and grab something from the fridge. I've tried their almond crusted chicken fingers, chocolate chia pudding, chocolate almond brownie and a few of their teas and juices. So far, everything has tasted fresh and delicious.Last week, I had some extra time to sit and enjoy a meal, so I decided to get some hot food and grab a seat upstairs. I ordered the root mash (a mix of root veggies and sweet potato puréed into a baby food consistency) and the chicken something or other (chicken in a creamy stew). You can get a few random things thrown on top like slivered almonds, onion or quinoa puff. I went for the almonds and quinoa puff. I went upstairs around 5pm. It was about half occupied. Some people were at tables eating solo or with company, some people on computers and 2 random women napping at opposite ends of the dining room. They also have a bunch of  seats that look like tree stumps. Since I always want to pretend I'm picnicking, I opted for a tree stump. My view was right over the entrance/front of the restaurant. I could see the employees making juices and smoothies and people watch at the same time. What could be better? Actually, the best part was the smell. The warm smell of ginger from the juices were wafting straight into my face. My dinner was delicious. I'm pretty fond of being able to shovel things into my face, so the fact that I could use a spoon to eat the entire meal was a huge positive. Good work Hu, you have passed my test.",6,3,6

However today, after calling to check in on the order around 1:15 and speaking with an entirely unapologetic representative who told us the order was ""out for delivery"", today the order finally showed up at 2:11PM, and it was consequently quite cold. In an unrelated but somehow deeply symbolic occurence, my coworker's faux-caccia bread had a piece of hard plastic in it, which he bit into and immediately spat out (see picture).

The Roasted Sweet Potatoes were good, too, but I don't personally like that many spices on sweet potatoes so it wasn't my favorite.Some of the other offerings may be a little pricey such that I don't often get them. Like the packages of gluten-free graham crackers or the chia puddings - they're delicious, but I can't justify paying that much for the small volume of food there.Nice amount of seating both downstairs and upstairs, and there's wi-fi, too.

I had one of their bowls with sweet potato mash, quinoa, and moroccan chicken, which was really flavorful. This place is super diet-friendly, particularly if you can't/don't eat gluten.The cons: small portions and big prices. After my $11 bowl, I still left hungry. I'm not someone who eats huge portions of food by any means, so this was pretty disappointing. If you think about it, you are getting what you paid for- really high quality food that's organic, healthy, and made without preservatives, unlike 99% of restaurants in NYC.

I got the grandmaster veg (dairy-free lasagna), which had carrots, cabbage, marinara, garlic. It tasted very...healthy, which I personally like. There wasn't a whole of bold flavors in this particular dish. I also ordered the assorted market veggies, which also tasted healthy--but good (total of $11.50). The caramelized pineapple was unexpected - tasted like brown sugar. The brisket dish was also tasty if you like barbecue sauce. Overall some people who want really tasty food might want to pass.They have seating upstairs and limited seating downstairs on tables that look like fake tree stumps. You bus yourself by stacking your dishes in a certain area. If you like healthy food, definitely come! It feels a bit trendy, but I don't mind. I'd like to try some of their baked goods.

Updated review","I used to love Hu Kitchen and would eat there at least once a week. I stopped going as often for the past couple of years. I find that the quality of food has gone down since returning. I felt sick both times after eating there in the past couple of weeks. Even though they are ""clean"" and paleo I think they put too much oil or something in the food. Most of the people who work there are as rude as can be. You feel as if you are in inconveniencing them when you order food. I don't know what they think they are there to do, that's their job. I had a matcha cupcake that was absolutely awful. The cake part as good but the frosting had way too much matcha to the point that it wasn't edible. I am a huge matcha fan, I put it in everything. I told them at the counter how it was so bitter and inedible but they did not care. You'd think they would offer an exchange for another flavor but they did not. Overall the food is mediocre and the service is terrible. It may be the only official paleo going in New York, but there are plenty of other eateries that have good paleo options. Don't waste your money here.",,,
168,Ali C.,"Manhattan, NY",167,64,82,4.0,4/16/2016,"Hu Kitchen is Dig Inn's paleo larger twin brother. I came here in search of Whole 30 approved food after I couldn't stand cooking another meal! It's so exciting to walk into a restaurant and be able to eat everything without reading the ingredient lists in search of sugar, grains, or dairy. The food is pre-prepared, and you walk up to the counter and pick what you want. They have hot and cold foods. Some are entree style where you get meat and 2 sides or you can order some of the salads/veggies and pay by the pound.The ambiance is casual -- trendy cafeteria style. There is plenty of seating downstairs and upstairs. The food was tasty and it was so amazing eating food that humans thousands of years ago could eat and knowing none of the ingredients were industrialized products. Good for the body and the soul!",1,,1
169,Molly S.,"New York, NY",38,30,3,2.0,10/21/2017,There is hardly any flavor to the food. Prices are crazy and the portions are European in side. The staff isn't the most friendly,,,
170,Zinnia M.,"Philadelphia, PA",178,115,21,5.0,6/21/2015,"My favorite place to eat in NYC! Stopped in today on my way out of town and tried The Parker Diesel. They gave me a great portion (thankfully since the price point here is a little high) so I was able to take half home. Also grabbed a slice of banana bread to go. I love that I can trust the food is paleo and chock full of nutritious goodies. Yum!Sat in the window and watched the people on 5th ave get trapped in a major thunderstorm, though I also would have enjoyed sitting upstairs and taking in the simple/soothing decor. Oh, and the employees here are nice, helpful, and professional.Check it out!",,,

172,Helen Z.,"Stanford, CA",304,235,536,4.0,2/9/2016,"Imagine Whole Foods mixed with ultimate paleo health nut mixed with New York hipster. Enter - Hu Kitchen. I came here on a whim after reading about the wide selection of healthy breakfast foods and I was not disappointed. Given their wide selection, there are quite a few decisions I had to make:-Cold or hot? Cold boasts various parfaits with ingredients like cashew cream, nut and seed granola, and fresh fruit. Hot offers either breakfast wraps on some non-flour tortilla or eggs with veggie sides of your choosing. I ended up going with the breakfast platter - two eggs, a grain free bun, and sides of sweet potatoes and broccoli slaw. -Coffee or juice? I opted for the crack coffee - satisfying both my craving for caffeine and desire to try something new. Crack coffee, also known as bulletproof coffee, is made with butter and coconut oil. I couldn't tell if it was the extra fat or the beans themselves that made the bigger difference but either way, it was yummy.-Dessert or no dessert? If I hadn't already spent $10+ on breakfast and coffee, I probably would have tried something in their prepared desserts section. No, not the cookies made of cricket flour. But maybe that key lime pie or paleo dessert bar...I'm no paleo/vegan/latest-food-trend-chasing fanatic, but I appreciate the option to enjoy delicious and healthy food!",2,1,2
173,Kellie N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",304,2,0,5.0,5/22/2018,Their specials are amazing- check their Instagram to see what its gonna be!!  Coffee is great too and good alternative to chains in union square area.,,,
174,Monica L.,"Queens, NY",0,11,0,3.0,8/16/2017,"This place is better in theory than execution. I have been coming here for several years because it is the only paleo option available near my office. I am finally throwing in the towel. The food is often heavy, uninspired and always too expensive for what you receive. They do have a wide variety of dishes, but strangely, much of it tastes the same. The only consistently good thing is the coffee--organic, tasty and fresh. Still, it's not enough to keep me coming back. It's disappointing because healthy options are not always easy to find.",1,,
175,Jeff V.,"Westchester County, NY",0,6,10,2.0,5/14/2018,"Tried this place a couple of times and it was OK. Third time is happening right now and it's not a charm. The side of ""non stir fry"" vegetables that came with my Diesel Parker has enough raw sodium in it to hospitalize a small child. So beware. I tried mixing it with the extra bland Hu Joe that sunk my Grandmaster Veg elsewhere on the plate, but i would still need an H2O intravenous hookup to finish. Making matters worse, we order two of these that totaled over $40! Forty dollar brick of salt with some vegetables wrapped around it for dinner.",,,
176,Kelly S.,"New York, NY",218,74,71,5.0,3/21/2017,Best restaurant I have ever been to. I am paleo and live in the south and this is the first place I have ever been able to eat absolutely everything at. Not only was it healthy and amazing but it was also delicious. I ate their twice on my short two day trip to NYC.,,,
177,Karina R.,"Bayside, NY",6,19,1,2.0,9/28/2017,"Kinda, sorta okay. Their menu stands out -- great for paleo/non-gluten/healthy eaters! -- even with the inflated prices, but when you step in, it's mostly self-service. Nothing wrong with that, but the cost should reflect that. More than that, the flavor is just lacking. The organic chicken and vegetables I had were prepared decently, but were really mediocre in the taste department.",,,
178,Gahee L.,"New York, NY",252,101,94,4.0,3/14/2016,"My first ever all-gluten free restaurant! It was so nice to be able to walk around and look at food items, knowing I could eat every single one of them. I got the paleo meat pizza with cauliflowers on the side. I loved the cauliflowers more than the pizza actually; the curry powder made it very flavorful and fun to eat. The pizza was pretty good, except the crust tasted a bit too gluten-free for me (very dry and crunchy) - they were very generous with the toppings though!",1,,
179,Joe M.,"Matawan, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,4/13/2017,"Great food and atmosphere, can be crowded at times. Everything is paleo inspired. What that means is everything is fresh and ""real"" food. Lots of meat and vegetable offerings, in both plate and bowl form. They also have great smoothies and coffee. Some people come here because it's so healthy, but I bring people who are happy just because it's delicious. Don't forget your homemade chocolate bars on the way out - they're amazing.",,,
180,Alexia G.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,422,137,2.0,11/10/2014,"I came here for breakfast for the first time today. They always have humorous signs outside on the chalk board! I love the idea they want to portray but the food is not so great for the price. I had a cup of coffee with coconut milk and a vegetarian breakfast wrap with sweet potato. I do not eat beef and had asked if the chili is made with meat (staff was unsure). I thought this was extremely disappointing. The wrap was a crepe (why didn't they say that?) CRACK COFFEE later that day with a friend was nice and worth a try ($3.50 for 12 oz.) For the $14 bill, no thank you. I would rather go visit JUICE PRESS any day.",4,1,1
181,Kristine F.,"Manhattan, NY",149,24,3,4.0,4/21/2017,"I wish there were more locations - this place is absolutely wonderful for Paleo. It's so nice to know that I can walk in and have ANYTHING here. It's not all Whole30, but much of it is. I could eat here breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The mash bowls in the morning are terrific - try the banana cashew cream. The lunch is awesome, and I go between the meals and the deli-style takeout. If you're going to get a special, be prepared for a wait. I've waited 30 minutes on a busy day... If you're not on Whole30 and want a treat, the dessert selections are v yummy, especially the chia puddings and the ""cookie dough"" almond butter and chocolate truffles.Please open one in Gramercy Park or Madison Square Park area!!",,,
182,Danielle A.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,17,0,5.0,8/15/2017,"I eat here multiple times a week and am so thankful they exist! I have celiacs disease and autoimmune thyroiditis so I follow a paleo diet. I can rest easy knowing that I can eat anything in Hu kitchen. The specials are my favorite! I never thought I would ever be able to enjoy eating a paleo Cuban or paleo pork sandwich. Also, their location is very convenient. It's right by my school! Thanks Hu!",,,

There's many items to choose from so you'll never get bored and because of this reason,  Hu kitchen is a good eatery to put in your rotation of casual spots to eat at.  I love their half chicken with two sides meal option. mmmmmm.  will be back.",2,2,2
184,Justin C.,"Manhattan, NY",5,3,0,1.0,9/22/2017,"This was not a pleasant experience. I ordered a bowl of green curry chicken quinoa that was not appetizing. They gave me two pieces of chicken in total and the bowl was around the size of a teacup. My other order was a Cesar salad and each piece was void of any taste whatsoever. For what the price is, you should not be serving baby sized food to customers. Absolutely unacceptable.",,,
185,Ted C.,"Chicago, IL",389,1691,1757,4.0,10/29/2014,"My first visit was just a quick stop in to check out what it was about. I figured a 'Paleo' restaurant was going to be super expensive and full of a bunch of jacked up Crossfit dudes who would look down on mere mortals for trying to eat like them.Instead, I got a shiny cafeteria type plates with normal and (mostly) nice staff that served up some really good food. I went a few weeks ago when they had a buffalo wing special, which I thought was a little on the pricey side but what it got me was over a dozen wings, and two massive helpings of their sides. The lady got the same thing and she couldn't finish her wings so I of course, proceeded to eat them all, not bad for a supposedly healthy restaurant and their veggie sides were piled high and delicious.We decided to go with dessert. How awesome is the dessert going to be without flour or sugar? Well, there's plenty to be had with the alternatives they use which were all terrific. We got the 'crack bar' which is kind of like baklava without the dough and the Paleo brownie which tasted just like a regular brownie-which may not seem like a big compliment but when you're faked out that well then it's a good thing.I actually can't wait to go back next time and try their meatloaf or splurge and try their beers/ciders which are all gluten free.",2,1,2

It's hard to find a place that actually executes what they preach, but HU kitchen is great! I read a lot of reviews regarding the delivery, but my delivery has always been prompt and faster than the estimated time. I also read the food portions are small for the price. I disagree. The dinner is definitely satisfying for one person. My go to is the 1/4 chicken with two sides. You can choose from different sides. I prefer the roasted sweet potato and veggie mash. Every single item I've tried has been tasty. The almond chicken nuggets are yummy too. No they don't have that fried chicken taste, but that's not what you are ordering here. The food truly hits the spot and doesn't make you feel guilty afterwards. Paleo brownie, granola, and cookies are superb for your sweet craving. I've tried so many times making home made Paleo desserts and always fail. All their options are great! If you don't want to cook or feel good after a workout this is the place for you!",1,,1
188,Alice R.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,4,0,1.0,8/23/2017,DONT order the special.  The staff don't tell you how long it will take.

190,Quinn H.,"Little Neck, NY",0,13,0,3.0,11/14/2016,"I really want to give Hu Kitchen 5 stars! I love that the quality of the food is so top notch and appreciate the time they put into making innovative new creations. My favorites are the roasted chicken and the grandmaster veg! The quality is pretty consistent and I always leave feeling satisfied.My main issue is the customer service. With the exception of maybe 2 employees, I have never encountered such RUDE people. They are impatient, unfriendly, and make multiple mistakes every time I go (whether it's busy or not). I would hate for the employees to be the downfall of this wonderful restaurant. I hope this problem can be solved soon.",2,,

It's for nourishing your body with great food. I love the roasted chicken and brocolli side. The matcha avocado smoothie is HEAVEN.",,,
192,Brittany M.,"New York, NY",2,67,155,3.0,9/4/2016,"For starters, this restaurant would get 5 stars if it weren't for the staff. In fact the only reason they received a 3 star is because of the food and Valerie who was the ONLY person that was kind to me when I went in to purchase my lunch. Okay, so for the food, its amazing. If  you're gluten free or just a little more health conscious than our fellow fast food eater you will love Hu Kitchen. The ingredients that they use taste fresh and the food is always so delicious. I normally order the bowl, with the bowl you can mix your base and protein. I get the quinoa, and cauliflower puree as my 2 base with the Moroccan chicken and mushrooms as my 2 proteins. Crack bar for dessert and an iced Chai with coconut milk. Or their organic coffee.I have also ordered their Mash bowl with almond butter / granola / kiwi and coconut - DELICIOUS.As amazing as this food is, the people aren't. It was as if the owners said "" Screw it hire whoever, our food will make up for their lack of customer service skill and poor attitudes."" The first time I ordered Hu Kitchen I received the food in less than a half hour, everything tasted fresh and it was still hot when I received it. But when I placed the order the man on the other end of the phone intentionally hung up on me because thought I asked him for no pork, when in fact I said I would like a fork. A common form of miscommunication, but was that a need to hang up the phone on a client? It honestly made me feel uncomfortable and like I shouldn't order from them in hopes that I don't get spit in my food or any unwanted guests. I ordered from them 2 more times.... Today I went in to purchase my lunch before heading over to work. The people and attitude I encountered were disgusting. I went to the bowl bar to order my lunch and the man did not at  all seem as though he wanted to help me, he rather stand and talk to his colleagues.  But after a few minutes of warming him up to me he started to become very helpful. Seems like that should not be up to me to do... since I am the customer. Non the less, I decided on my usual after sampling a few other dishes (YES YOU CAN SAMPLE mostly ANYTHING). After receiving my food, I went ahead to pay and order my usual Iced chai that is so good I had literally been craving it for days. Valerie put my order in, but another girl made my drink, I watched in excitement as she pour chai into a cup and heavily top it with coconut milk. Tasted it and, Unfortunately it was not good, way too milky not enough Chai at all. So I attempted to get her attention, she ignored my first 3 attempts, but I waited patiently although she was just replenishing the cup area. She then walked to me and just looked at me as to ask what the issue was, as I asked her to pour some out and add more chai. She poured a little out, as she went to add more Chai I informed her that she may have to pour out more. But instead of taking my advice she poured more chai over this cup of coconut milk. I took the chai, tasted it, but instead of attempting to get it remade, I went to Valerie for a refund. She understood and informed me that sometimes depending on who makes the drinks will determine how they taste.  Valerie called over her manager or supervisor on duty (Crystal) ... Crystal was not rude or mean but she could definitely use some training in customer service.When she approached me she didn't look at me, greet me, smile, ask the situation. Instead she took the original receipt from Valerie's hand and went to the computer to perform a void. Once that was complete she aggressively handed me a new receipt. Still with no words. I then asked her if the new receipt was my new receipt, she quickly said Yup and told me I could go....Hmm... all in all the food is great, the service however is disgusting. I told myself I could still order from here because I loved the food after the guy hung up the phone on me. But unfortunately no one deserves to be treated like their unimportant or irrelevant especially when they're looking to eat some great; good feeling food. Hu - Let's get back to humane ways as wellValerie (SUPER HELPFUL & also probably one of the youngest that works there)",4,1,1
193,Liana L.,"Manhattan, NY",120,28,37,5.0,9/14/2017,What a wonderful surprise! I was looking for healthy options are the union square area and found this restaurant. The place is divided into sections and you can make your own dish (you pick an entree and add sides if you wish). I paid around 13 dollars for grilled chicken entree and mashed cauliflower purée and I can say it was one of the bests of my life. I'm definitely going to be back. Oh! You don't need to tip either!!! :),,,
194,Christina W.,"New York, NY",573,168,1001,3.0,8/2/2016,"I pass this place while walking back and forth to school, and finally decided to give it a try. I picked up two dinner bowls for the price of $25. The food was good, so why only 3 stars?For $12 a bowl, I would've expected the portion to be bigger than what you would expect a medium soup cup to come in. It was TINY! And it's not as if I'm getting pure meat... it was all vegetarian. Quinoa. Mashed up roots. A very small roll (smaller than a garlic knot).It was good, but not $12 per small taste good. Wouldn't go back, as healthy as it makes itself out to be.",5,1,2

Basically if you are on any kind of diet, Hu is going to be your best friend.Atmosphere is super chill with a chatty noise level and pop music in the background. Overall a great place for a casual meal/smoothie/coffee. Bonus: free filtered water and prices are in the $10-18 range. Don't forget to flash your student ID for a discount!",,,
196,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,8900,3.0,2/12/2014,"I like their philosophy. Actually, I love their philosophy. I agree we should be eating real food, made with fewer, healthier ingredients. I think we eat too much sugar, especially sugar derived from artificial sources and/or corn syrup. I think we have a better chance to reduce our factory farming problems by voting with our wallets, and showing that there's a serious market for organic meat than we do through vegetarianism. And I don't mind paying more for it. Unfortunately, I think I like their philosophy better than I like their food. By all means, make your lasagna with turkey. It's leaner, I know. But please devise a method of making it less dry. Go ahead, ""bread"" your chicken fingers with almonds.* But figure out a way to make it a bit less mealy. Or serve them hot, which might help. (Don't do a thing to the BBQ sauce, that stuff is delicious.) The kale salad is good. Keep that coming. Overall, I really don't mind paying $13 for a tiny box of food at lunch, as long as it's food I love. Considering the chicken fingers and kale salad sounded the best AND are the most popular items (as per the guy behind the counter), I'm not sure I want to delve deeper into the menu.And I'm not just saying that because when the guy said, ""Nice tie,"" it sounded like he didn't think it was very nice and that he hated me for wearing it. ____________*I have no problem with you making everything gluten-free. Personally, I don't necessarily think everyone eating gluten-free is necessary or even desirable, but it's nice for all the celiacs to know that everything in the joint is fair game. I just might not like your substitutes.",15,5,7
197,Ariel D.,"Phoenix, AZ",128,6,0,4.0,10/3/2016,"Paleo Paradise is a fairly accurate description for this place. My wife and I went on a busy Saturday morning. We ordered the Banana Toast and Burrito. They were both very good. The food serving was small compared to their prices. Their drinks are overpriced. But, you're paying for the ingredients, honestly...and in comparison to other places in West Village, it's fair. Drawbacks: if it's busy, seating can be a pain. And, they have 1 bathroom for the entire restaurant, so there's always a line. And, lastly, as I mentioned before, it's a little overpriced for the serving size, but not the area it's located. But, if you're looking for good paleo/gluten free options, this is the place.",1,,2
198,Nick T.,"New York, NY",14,16,0,3.0,8/28/2016,"I was so excited by this menu, which was completely health-focused, plant-centered, only whole grain, mostly dairy-free, and mostly whole-food.PROS:  Food was pretty good, with one of the healthiest menus I've seen.CONS:  Overpriced.  My veggie ""bowl"" (basically a small soup cup) came out to $12.  I don't agree with their need to expunge gluten, GMOs, and non-organic foods from their menu.  For the average person, the current evidence points to these foods having no ill health effects (or even to the environment, so long as they are being cultivated responsibly).  They should at least have a ""non-organic"" section or options, that would be more affordable.  Although I think parts of their philosophy are falling prey to the appeal to nature fallacy and are making their food unnecessarily expensive, their menu takes nutrition seriously.  I hope when they finally break away from the 'unnatural food-aversion movement,' they recognize that there is a market of customers who are already way ahead of them, eagerly awaiting the price cuts.",2,,1
