0,Ramon R.,"Bronx, NY",1,24,36,5.0,10/28/2018,I was drunk on a Saturday night and this chicken parm sandwich saved my life. It's refreshing to find a bar with a wide beer variety and a kitchen that's open late with quality food!,,,

Updated review","Keep updating this place for many reasons do to the lack, of service. For some reason the many times I have came here I have gotten a chance to get serve by Jason. He's great every time we come here he serves us fast, very friendly comes around the bar to see if we are good on the drinks, can't complaint this guy makes this place look good.This bar is great to come after work or with some co workers, tv's all around for game nights it's a pretty cool spot. As far as the food can't complaint everything is done fresh and is worth ordering something different from the menu every time you come here.",5,2,3
3,Fitsum K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,14,0,4.0,10/23/2018,"Burger is amazing, the place needs tidy up but if you don't mind the bar atmosphere you are good. Service is slow, expect delays. But it's is worth the wait",,,
4,Abigail R.,"New York, NY",2437,274,963,4.0,3/6/2018,This bar is pretty cool i haven't been here in a while but i remember the grilled Brussels sprouts they were pretty darn good also the list of beer they have here is alot lol. I had one of there deliriums you can never go wrong with. This is not a place you would go to turn up unless is for pre-gaming. This is more of a chill spot and casual conversations and great laughs.  I find the price very reasonable and the food is quite decent . If you're looking for a great selection of beer they do have a lot compare to some of the other local bars. They also have a lot of IPAs which my loves i'm not a big fan of IPAs anymore but i wont say no to beer ^.^,6,,3
5,Catherine T.,"New York, NY",1391,204,624,4.0,6/12/2018,"This is probably one of my favorite bars in Washington heights because they actually cater to having good seasonal beers on tap. The place is spacious, and the food is decent being that the menu is bar food. The bartenders are really nice and friendly. They usually have promotions going on (atleast the times I've been there). I've been lucky to stop by during a Ketel one and a coors light promo, so I had the advantage of drinking for free :).",5,3,3
6,Sue C.,"Fox Point, Providence, RI",0,9,2,2.0,10/10/2018,Service could be a lot better. Even when empty they take a long time to acknowledge you. Seems like a result of poor management,,,
7,Gustavo D.,"New York, NY",0,9,4,4.0,6/26/2018,"Went on a date here, and am in love with the ""little Swiss sunshine"" burger. Unique & Amazing taste. The Cajun fries are to die for. Cool atmosphere with outdoor seating as well. The only reason i don't give 5 stars is because the service could have been a lot better. We were never given menus and had to get up to get the server's attention multiple times. The staff was nice once at the table but it would've been nice to have a server accesible. Definitely coming back, and have to try the blueberry wings!",1,,
8,Jerome T.,"New York, NY",99,372,3046,5.0,4/18/2017,"Basic necessities I need on game days:- lots of TV's- obligatory infuriating music that plays over the games that makes you want to stab yourself in the eyes. - alcohol - long bar- urination station- tots- multiple option wings, ditto dipping sauces & choice of fried or grilled. - fried brussel sprouts - burgers- the fine art of knowing when i need a drink and when to leave me the fuck alone, because I just lost another game, but more importantly, money that I was going to use to tip you. - tissue, for drying my tears - open late. like 4am late, because after another blow out loss, I need another 4-12 hours of heavy drinking to make the pain go away. This joint has what I need to enjoy/hate Saturdays and Sundays. I'm Jerome and I approve of this message.",9,12,12
9,Kelly R.,"New York, NY",364,37,26,5.0,11/7/2017,"Y'all, this food. Bless it. I recently moved to the area, and knew this was going to become my local beer joint. Last week, I was locked out of the apartment () so I headed down to BBB for dinner. HOLY COW OMG ZAMAZING. the chicken pesto sandwich was killer. The bread was delicious and perfect, the mozzarella was melty, the chicken was juicy, the French fries seasoned with the right amount. Pure perfection. It's a little pricey for my wallet (but not nyc standards) but I guarantee I'll be back. I didn't even take a minute to photograph this meal because I was so hungry, but trust me: it was delish.",1,,1
10,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,484,1951,4.0,12/30/2016,"This would have been a three star review because in all reality, this is a dive bar with kitsch. However, after having had the bees knees cocktail and trying their food (pepperoni pizza, mozzarella sticks and sweet potato fries) that rating gets knocked up a notch. Oh and did I mention how friendly the service is?? This sure beats the Dyckman strip of bars close by with all pomp and lacking substance. Walking in on a Wednesday night, we had the place mostly to ourselves. We were able to enjoy happy hour in all its glory which ran until 7pm. Keep in mind that Wednesday's are also game night and there are some specials associated with that. However, by the time 9pm rolled around the crowd was beginning to build and rolling.There are plenty of televisions to watch your choice of game from table or bar seating. My personal favorite was that the bar had hooks and the bar stools were comfortable. Music is at the bartender's discretion and I was happy with the eclectic selection. Definitely a must if you live in the area, and I'm sure that I'll be back.",13,8,9

Nice chill bar which provides another option for nightlife in Washington Heights. Drinks were reasonably priced, atmosphere is chill and relax. Good place to meet with a group of friends or to just have conversation over drinks.They have board games Connect Four, Jenga and others. They also have different events and specials on certain days. I will definitely come back here again when I want a chill place to have some drinks at or catch a sporting event.",,,1

This is your local sports bar, so as I stepped on I noticed well placed tvs all over the bar so at any time I can look up for a second and catch any game that's on right now.they have plenty of beer on tap from ciders to stouts, there's something for everyone here. The food is really tasty as well! They have burgers and wings and even tacos to name a few. Overall goodness for your tastebuds.""So what events do they do there?""During the weekday, they do events like game night on Wednesdays and trivia on Thursdays. They also do pay per views, so if you are looking for the upcoming UFC or Boxing match you know you will have a seat to watch with friends.""Overall""Come with friends, bring yourself and get to the bartenders and server, everyone will get to know and appreciate you.",17,7,18

I'm not much of a beer drinker but was pleasantly surprised with one of their sour beers (sorry can't remember the name). The options for beer was quite large. The food was fine but I mostly liked the space and vibe. Would come again for trivia night and to try out some more of their food/drink options for a chance to raise my star points.,,,
14,Walter W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/30/2018,"Nice beer selection, and decent food, but doesn't live up to the claim to be a sports bar.  I went there to watch the World Cup and they blasted music for the entire game, at a nigh club volume level. It was distracting and terrible.  On top of that the service was spotty.  Fine bar if they don't bombard you with you music, but the problem is that you'll never know when they might.  I'll be avoid it for now on.",,,
15,Amber P.,"Manhattan, NY",348,19,8,5.0,5/25/2018,Amazing--our favorite spot. Between the bartenders (Jade is THE BEST) and the food (burgers are PERFECT) this place is an all-around winner. Do it.,,,

He was very attentive and made sure we were well-cared for during our visit.Buddha Beer Bar is a favorite of my friend and me. They have a good draft beer selection and tasty foods. We shared the kimchi pulled pork nachos that were super tasty. We were both pretty satisfied food-wise by the end of our buddy.

Updated review","Great neighborhood bar. I enjoy coming here because everyone is so great. Especially Jayson, he's extremely joyful and always goes the extra mile while he's serving. When he is bartending he makes the best drinks so ask for anything, he's usually there for the unlimited brunch. There's one drink in particular called the Jayson Special (it's not on the menu), not sure what's in it but it's amazing!!! Ask for him if you can and tell em I sent ya!!!",1,1,1
19,Eugene K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,6,4.0,6/9/2017,"Let me start by saying this review is for their Cuban sandwich and Cuban sandwich only.That said, it's probably the best Cuban sandwich I've had to date and I ordered it every time I go there.  It's made with pulled pork, black Forrest ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, mojo (garlic butter sauce, can't get enough!) and served on toasted ciabatta bread with your choice of fries (they have many types) or salad just in case you're trying to watch our figure, haha! I have only 2 complaints;1. $14 is a lot for this sandwich, I've had many from all over and none of them have been close to that price. I've gotten ones that are comparable for less than half the price, some even twice the size. 2. It is inconsistent.  Don't get me wrong, this sandwich is good no matter what but I've gotten better ones depending on who's in the kitchen making my sandwich.  I prefer it being a giant pile of sloppy mess but the one I got was a bit too nice/clean this time around.  It was still delicious, just not as delicious as when I have to use 5 dinner napkins to get all the awesomeness off hands.I'd rate this one Cuban sandwich a solid 4.5.  I'd give it a perfect 5 if they could just make it messier/sloppier every time I ordered it.  As far as staff and service, they are always super nice when I go there, no attitudes or frowns in site.",,,
20,Brendan M.,"New York, NY",4,51,0,5.0,4/11/2018,"Best beer selection in the neighborhood, quality food that's willing to experiment, crowd's always friendly, place is never empty, nor too crowded. It's a good place to watch the game AND have a conversation, music's never too loud -- you know what? I was giving this four stars, but I just upgraded to five. You rock, Buddha Bar.

23,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,4/18/2016,"Always on the lookout for a bar serving up interesting craft brews. This place in particular has a large amount of seating, plenty of tvs, and a large menu to satisfy just about anyone.Ordered a craft beer ($8) and the nachos ($10) to start. The chips in the nachos are completely covered by all the ingredients layered on top of it: salsa, pico de gallo, cheddar, Monterrey jack, and a heap of guacamole. Even some sour cream to the side if you didn't have enough. Surprisingly the chips aren't soggy, and kept their composure throughout. Also ordered the Wings (10 for $10). You get to choose one of the many different sauces they have, so I settled on the unique Cider BBQ. A wonderful combination of sweet and tangy on top of slightly overcooked meaty wings.For a sports bar, this place really brings out lots of food/craft beer options. Will more than likely be back when in the area.",,,

Updated review",Food was amazing !  Their wings and curly fries! I have no words lolDrinks were good and they have fun board games for you to playIm giving it 3 stars because of the music.  I love alternative music but I also love many other genres. We made reservations because my cousin was celebrating her wedding.  We had a huge crew with us.  But the music was killing our vib. The bride asked the dj multiple times to add up beat music but they never did. So than what's eh. But everything else was on point,,,

It was empty which was great! Enough space to have a drink and enjoy a meal. I ordered the cheese quesadilla. It was good. Not hard to mess this up but somehow they made it taste super good.

Updated review","I found myself craving honey wings, but to lazy to wander down to BBQs for take out. My brother recommended I just go to Buddha and swore the wings would be as good as BBQs. That is the last conversation we are having. Christmas will be awkward. Now if I was drinking, these would have been ok. But I was sober, and started drinking because of these and they were not ok. The wings are basic bar food. But the sauce is what pissed me off. If you are basting wings, you baste with a sauce that can hold its own. This sauce was so watery that the wings tasted like plain wings. I tried separating the meat and dipping aggressively. I tried elevating the plate so the sauce would stay in one spot. I tried blue cheese. I tried ranch. It was (insert expletive) exhausting. I then got some Hawaiian sauce from trader joe's and accepted that I would not be enjoying honey wings before doing a liquid fast for 48 hours. I still have 16 hours to go and I am sitting at home thinking about what a waste of effort these wings were.If I die tonight I will haunt this place. They will know it is me because I will knock over that dam honey sauce until they change it. Then I will ascend to heaven. Where I am sure BBQs delivers.P.S. they don't answer the phone, so if you want take out you'll have to stand there and wait for it. See, that was probably God telling me to go elsewhere.",2,6,

I come here just for the Chicken Pesto Sandwich sometimes. This is a great bar with a variety of craft beers. They have craft beers plus a rotating list which changes every other day. My boyfriend loves the 'Summer Shandy' beer which is hard to find, and they had it here last week on the rotating beer list. Lots of TVs everywhere to catch a game. Tends to get a little crowded some nights but never overwhelmingly packed. The staff are all really nice! They remember their customers and def take care of you if you're nice. FYI, happy hour is until 8pm and Thursdays is ladies night. Discounted drinks all night for the chicks! Kitchen closes at 2am. I recommend the Quesadillas and Spicy Chilli Garlic wings. My favorite is the Chicken Pesto Sandwich w/ sweet potatoe fries. Excellent bar uptown and unique to the area.

I walked in on a football sunday, place wasn't even packed, sat down for 5 minutes while a server was standing right by the table and was completely ignored. Like, hello?????? Stop watching the game and attend to your guests! Got no menus, no water. So I moved to the bar. Bartenders were super inattentive, as always. As a server, I get it but cmon, there's a difference between being busy and not giving a damn. The service is so inconsistent it's not worth coming back.",,,

Decor is pretty random but everything is nice and clean. They have some interesting wing sauces like blueberry chipotle and 'Korean' but also a variety of standard flavors such as spicy chilly garlic. Spicy chili garlic and blueberry are both superb by the way. Music played is an ideal volume and conversations are audible but there won't be any awkward silences either. Music choice is another strong point as the playlist is varied, entertaining, and sets an appropriate vibe for a low key good beer and meal sort of place.

I ordered food twice because she forgot to put my order through the first time. By the time she came around I was beyond hangry .

I would definitely come for a second visit.I have now been here several times. The wings are incredible grilled, and I order sauce on the so the chipotle sauce is not overbearing. Can honestly say they are the best bar wings I have had. Soft, and flavorful. Nachos are also the best I have had at a bar. This is quickly becoming a regular go to spot for me.

Everyone below me has probably already mentioned the brussel sprouts but they are a must to try. My favorite however is their weekend brunch. A great and a affordable selection of omelettes and specialties like eggs Benedict is hard to pass up. I make it a weekly stop on the weekend.

87,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,3/14/2012,"Honestly, I'd have to give them more of a 3.5 stars just for the fact that the music in the bathroom is so loud, my ears started to hurt. However, I will round them up to the full four for a myriad of excellent reasons.Despite being a 10 minute walk from my apartment, I always forget what a nice stretch of eateries and bars there are along Broadway from 181st up towards Fort Tryon Park. Add Buddha Beer Bar to the list! My friend Ben and I (my usual partner in crime when it comes to eating and drinking in the WaHi / Inwood area) went there at about 8:30 on a Tuesday night, and things were certainly hopping! The beer menu is constantly rotating, much Pony Bar; our waitress, Shannon, told us to look at the board above the bar for what was most up to date at the time. Lucky me, they had Harpoon Hard Cider on tap (YAY!), and my friend was able to sample a couple of beers before ordering. Each was $6 a pop. Not too shabby.I fell in love with the menu, mostly the tacos in both Korean and Mexican styles! We each went with a Korean style: he got cod and kimchi, while I went with the steak and kimchi. Both delicious, but I could not manage to eat the second one! The first was too filling, and I was literally forcing my friend to eat it, too. (I hope it makes for good leftovers, because it might be my dinner tonight!)Also, backtracking, our waitress Shannon (well, I base that off of the name on our receipt) was such a delight. Attentive, genuinely friendly, and with each beer / cider she brought, she said, ""Cheers"". It was endearing! I'm so pleased to have Buddha Beer Bar in my 'hood. It's the type of place I want to tell my friends about and say, ""Yes, there ARE cool bars up in the Heights. So get your asses up here!""",5,1,4

Had a margarita as my second drink and it was well made. I ordered the chicken tenders with fries. The chicken tenders were almost burnt and weren't that good. I was pretty hungry which is why I ate them. They came with fries which is a good deal.

95,Andrew J.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,4.0,7/19/2014,"I live in Hamilton Heights and was hanging out with my friend who lives in Washington Heights when he suggested we stop up here on the way back to his place. Long story short we had a wonderful time and I've discovered my new go-to when I'm drinking closer to home. The Beer: A rock solid core list with 13 rotating drafts, some of which I haven't seen anywhere else around town. They live up to the ""beer bar"" name.The Food: We split cheese fries that were unfussy and exactly right with super-melty cheese and crispy fries. My friend got the pulled pork tacos ""korean style"" and while I only had a bite they were good, if a little messy and a little expensive for what you got (10 dollars for two, admittedly ENORMOUS, tacos).The Service: Despite what some of the other Yelpers have experienced, this was the real highlight for me. Upon arrival we stood at the bar for maybe ten seconds before a very kind bartender called both of us ""honey"" and took our orders. When we sat down a waitress almost instantly came up to us and asked if we wanted to see a menu. After more drinks and food we got the check and noticed they had charged us for the drinks we paid for at the bar. To make it up to us my friend and I each got a free shot of our choice, ALONG with the drinks being taken off the check. All in all a really nice place. It was only about half full at 11 on a friday night too which was a nice change from The Harlem public which is always packed and uncomfortable.",,,1

One bartender saw that  I didn't put a tip after paying with my card ( I was going to give her cash) and she said ""Uh-uh honey, i DO NOT work for free"" and gave me my receipt back to put a tip.....ugh - rude?

102,Mark E.,"Manhattan, NY",5,66,0,4.0,1/20/2014,"Went in here on a late Saturday afternoon. It was quiet, people at a couple tables, a couple of folks at the bar, college basketball on TV and 80s music playing. Chatted with the bartender a bit and got the lowdown on the beer selection--26 on tap. Most of the beers they will feature for one keg only, then they swap out for a new beer. For some of the popular styles of beer--hefeweizen for example-- they'll go through maybe three kegs before they change to another pretty well known brand. Guinness appeared to be the lone constant.I had a very nice Cuban sandwich, it was pulled pork rather than a sliced pork loin with sliced ham, house made, not cold cut meat. The fries were good too.I'd definitely come back.",1,,
103,Mark F.,"Manhattan, NY",5,10,0,3.0,10/4/2013,"This place gets five stars for the beer selection. It's fantastic. If you are looking for great craft beer, come here.Unfortunately, the rest is a mixed bag. First of all, the atmosphere is very ""sports bar"" - lots of loud music, a very modern type of aesthetic, pretty bro-y. Some people are very into that. I am not, and neither are my roommates. When we come here, we try to make it an afternoon or early evening trip, before they turn up the music and all the sports people come in. Otherwise, I'm happy just getting a growler and going back to my place.The food is inconsistent at best. The brunch menu is nothing to write home about, and other than the blueberry wings and the sweet potato fries, I've never had anything really good here. None of the food I've had is bad, per se, but not worth the price of eating out, IMO.It's too bad this place can't be a little more like the Bronx Ale House. They both have terrific craft beer on tap, but for food and atmosphere, I definitely recommend the Ale House.",2,,
104,tyler s.,"Manhattan, NY",23,32,0,1.0,8/17/2013,"I went once months ago and was pretty unimpressed with the crowd, the service, and the food. I wouldn't have gone back, but some friends were meeting there, so I gave it another chance.It was early evening, and the place was far from busy. There were only three other tables seated for most of the time we were there, but the waitress was pretty inattentive. There were eventually six of us there, but I was the only one who ordered dinner. Our glasses were empty far more often than they should have been. Bus boys would occasionally come to clear away empty glasses without asking if we'd like more.I ordered a banana split along with my second beer. The beer came out, I finished it, and now that about fifteen minutes had gone by, I said to the waitress, ""I did order that banana split, right?"" She seemed a bit testy and simply replied ""Yes"" before walking away again. It was another ten minutes before it actually came out. All I could see in the dish was whipped cream. I started eating, and all I was getting was whipped cream and banana. I eventually discovered one single scoop of ice cream. It says right on the menu that it comes with three scoops, not that any idiot doesn't know what a banana split is supposed to look like. They had just thrown two bananas in the dish with one small lopsided scoop of ice cream, then hidden it with whipped cream. I guess that was my punishment for asking why my dessert was taking more than 15 minutes. The banana split is $10.Our original waitress decided to take a break and sit down at the bar to eat. We were passed off to another surly waitress. Most of the staff seemed visibly uninterested in what they were doing. When I asked to see the manager, the waitress apparently went over and told him that I had a problem with the gratuity, though I hadn't told her why I wanted a manager. To his credit, he took off the banana split. And yes, they had awarded themselves a mandatory 18% gratuity because there were six of us, even though most of our party just had a couple of drinks and even though the staff did a poor job handling that much.",3,,

A sister-wife of Locksmith & Harlem Public. The food is affordable and portions are hungry-man sized. I learned my lesson, from ordering the nachos, thinking it would just be me eating it, but luckily my friend agreed to share it. The nachos are fantastic, easily shared between 2 people, topped with a hearty helping of great melted cheese, tomatoes, onions the works. They are currently my go-to nachos in a metro friendly area. The crowd is mixed, and happily sang along to ""I-will-walk-five-hundred-miles..."" when prompted by the live band. Sidenote: Apparently no-one seems to know any other lines in the song, and just seem to lapse into happy melodic grunts.  Service was friendly. Baseball games were on the TV - generous close-ups of Robinson Cano. I will be back.",4,2,2

Was initially excited to go there on the regular but my first drinks/dining experience there was crazy. Ordered the pulled pork burger. It came with a spread of LOX on the burger bun... I couldn't believe it. I complained about it to 2 servers and to the manager. After 3 complaints did I finally receive an apology. They still charged me for the burger. I asked it to be taken off the bill, which they did... after complaint number 4.C'mon guys. Really? Would you eat pulled pork with lox on it without expecting it then not comp it from the bill? You wouldn't provide better service with a comp drink and an apology for the lousy fish/pork taste?Not sure if I'll be returning to this spot. Draft beer menu was great.",,,

I ate it anyways since I was starving (wouldn't order it again)French Fries were good and my friend was satisfied with her Chicken Parm Sandwich.The atmosphere was pretty cool.I would stop by again to sit at the bar for some drinks but I think I would only order some wings since I heard they are worth a try.,,,

So you can't eat because it ""approaching"" 9pm? You get denied service even when trying to not buy drinks? As well, the manager decided to push back the time for the bar from 10pm to 9pm.

140,Amanda K.,"New York, NY",6,104,13,2.0,5/22/2012,"Not good. The food was terrible; it all tasted store bought and reheated. The bar tender seemed stressed and inexperienced; plus, she had an attitude. She was nice at the end and took two drinks off our tab. Early in the night, she started pouring a beer and left it sitting under the tap; then, she came back to it about 7 minutes later to finish pouring it. For a place that promotes its beer selection, you'd think the bar tender would at least know how to pour a beer. If she was really knowledgeable about beers it would have made up for her not knowing what amarettos they had, only to find out they had no amaretto at all.The decor is cheesey. It looks like if a bar at a Chili's had a baby with a tool box and ordered all its decorations from a bar tending catalog and bought the cheapest stuff. A place doesn't have to be fancy to have character. The place just looks prefabricated and unwelcoming.",5,4,2

The waiter apologized and then came to tell me they didn't have calamari after I had ordered. I don't think I will be back as I feel for a Friday night there should be more waiters.

You can also bring home any draught beer in a 64 oz. growler, starting at $18.The Buddha Bar also has have trivia nights, karaoke nights, and other events that keep this space lively and vibrant. Their bathrooms smell amazing. Skinny-Buddha statues protect the booze, and the menu features vegetarian options.The food is really tasty.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...24 beers on tap. Another 3 dozen on the bottle. Fantastic food. Right off the 1 and A trains. Large enough to handle a crowd, but definitely not enormous. Some TVs that are playing the game (be it soccer, hockey, or--oddly--the luge championships) but aren't the focus. My God, the Heights needed a place like this.I went last night (a Tuesday) and the place was decently filled without being crowded at all. The owner/manager was at the end of the bar, making small talk. The bartender was cute and on her game (though just a bit slow at keeping up with the frequent requests). The atmosphere--steel and glass, mixed crowd speaking in English/Russian/Spanish, low-key without being dive-y or boring--spoke of fun times to come. Really, my only complaint was that for the amount of time we spent there, we didn't get a buy-back. Oh well.I'd compare this place to Amity Hall or Blind Tiger in terms of price/selection, but with the benefit that it's right around the corner from my place. This neighborhood has been begging for a beer bar, and by the crowd that was there last night, it's here to stay.DRINKS: Full bar with lots of options, but the highlight is the beer. This would be an above-average beer bar anywhere else in the city, but the Heights? Tops.FOOD: Decently priced and tasty. Seriously, so many good options. Korean/Mexican Tacos, Fried Pizza, Honey-Roasted Brussel Sprouts, Wings... upscale pub food!SERVICE: The food was prompt, but it took just a little bit to flag down the only bartender.

We had the chicken nachos which were really good. A bit pricey for nachos but none the less still worth it. The bartender was on point with the mixed drinks. Drinks range between $6 to $8, which is fairly cheap for a bar in the heights. The drinks are not watered down or to icey, you get more for your dollar here.

I had honey glazed fried wings which some were uncooked and some were harder to bite into. The server never came around to us to check up on things. Overall a terrible place.,2,,

149,Will M.,"Manhattan, NY",24,65,0,4.0,7/31/2012,"A chief complaint of Inwooders (because 'Inwoodies' just sounds dirty) was the relatively poor selection of beer bars. It's an issue that is quickly becoming remedied. While nothing in the neighborhood rivals powerhouse establishments like the Ginger Man, Rattle N Hum or Blind Tiger we have enough to make you happy. Because let's be honest, sometimes after a long day at work you want a beer, but not if it's followed by a long train ride. As far as local places go, Buddha is doing a good service for beer drinkers. Their menu rotates fairly often and has a pretty wide range of offerings from relatively tame local options to more far-ranging and adventurous brews. The atmosphere is nothing to rave about. It's a bar devoid of theme, decorating scheme or particular intention. If this is a major turn-off for you, head to a swanky lounge downtown. I haven't had much of the food, but I can highly recommend the brussels sprouts. I'm a huge fan of these micro-cabbages and the chili caramel sauce they are doused in was pretty delicious. All in all, it's a good place to grab a beer.",1,,

My sister and I came in knowing exactly what we wanted to order: sliders, Brussels sprouts and Mac & cheese - our server told us there was no Mac & cheese so we ordered sweet potato fries instead, thinking they'd go well with the sliders.The sliders and Brussels sprouts came out together. There were 3 sliders in the dish. I'd highly recommend it! So tender, moist and flavorful with some nice melted cheese on top. The Brussels sprouts were gross. They seemed to have freezer burn and they tasted undercooked in the center. Our fries hadn't come out by the time we finished our other 2 plates. No word from our server, no check in. We decided to cancel our order and leave (fries don't take that long to make... They were just not made period).He finally appeared way later saying our fries were on their way and we let him know our new server had assisted us in canceling the fries and getting our check while he was snoozing.I think our bad experience at Buddha bar really just comes down to our server not being able to handle his tables. He didn't place our order on time and it was all just a mess with another server trying to pick up his slack and intervene.",3,,

They have a bunch of American craft brews (think Victory, Two Brothers, Founders, Dogfish Head) and a good selection of Belgian and Czech beers as well. Check in/follow on Twitter and get a free Blue Point (definitely took advantage of this deal)!The food was pretty good. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was pretty good. It came with very limp fries, which seems to be a thing when the fries are house-made. Double fry them guys! They will be crispy and delicious. The Brussels sprouts were pretty tasty, but a bit on the sweet side and a bit on the over-done side as well. Still, we didn't leave any on the plate. The wings were good too but I wish more came to an order. It's hard to share 10 small wings.The wait staff is super friendly but also super scattered. There were problems with the tab and problems getting someone's attention. But, it's only been a week since they've opened and they apologized for their shortcomings so I'm giving them a pass.The decor is somewhat lacking. There's lots and lots of metal, which isn't what I want from a bar. But really, with this many good beers on tap, who cares?I know I'll be back regularly.

Good selection of beers For a minute I thought my only chances of beer in the heights would be corona or presidente.This is a rookie bar going through growing pains at the moment. In a few years when the kinks are worked out, it could be a solid veteran contender. Right now they are running into some issues - we went for a friends bday, and they didnt have enough shot glasses to give us a round of pickleback shots. What? so instead they made some lame mix of pickle juice and whiskey that did not have the same effect, and was quite frankly reprehensible. The only positive was seeing peoples disgusted shot faces and joking afterward about how horrible the shots were.The bar cant handle more than a few people without becoming overwhelmed. the place wasnt packed to the point of becoming uncomfortable, yet I had to wait what felt like forever to get rounds of drinks. This was a friday after work, you would think that this is the the prime time for a place like this, yet it felt like they werent prepared for the occasion. Food is hit or miss, overall its pretty generic bar food. Special shout out to the most pathetic chicken fingers on the planet. These joints were straight malnourished. It literally looked like an actual burnt finger. We held them up for pictures and they were about the size of a human pinky. Maybe i misread and it said human fingers on the menu. Since this spot is one of the only in the immediate area that sells beer other than those in the 40 oz variety, Ill give it 3 stars. Really should be 2. If you want a similar beer selection with better food and service, hop on the 1 and go to bronx ale house. If youre in this area and lazy or only concerned with beer, give this a shot.",1,,

I haven't had anything super impressive yet. Its not bad by any means. Again, for the Heights, its better than most. The servers haven't really impressed me. I've had two that acted like I was cutting into their social lives, and one that was decent on my last trip.Open mic nights are fun. How many places can see hear a Scottish guy sing opera songs? Fantastic.Go for the beer and burgers.",,,

The worst wings I have ever tasted...DO NOT GET THE CIDER BBQ~you have been warned.  The wings were drenched in sauce and tasted old.  I was also not impressed with their burger.  Long wait for food.  Very disappointing experience.",,,

The staff are all friendly, the bartenders know their selection.  They are also happy to pour you a sample of anything to get your acquainted with their changing craft beer selections.  Also happy to find their Bourbon-centric cocktail menu.   It's about time area got some updated hangouts.  Hope this place inspires others to open as well!",1,,
163,Anya A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",85,173,62,4.0,10/19/2013,"I am still unsure how ""Buddha"", ""beer"" and the heights all go together, but it's a decent place to meet up with friends, have some bar food and beer.  For a vegetarian non-beer drinker, there's framboise beer, guacamole and sweet potato fries.   For everyone else there are huge pints of different kinds of beers, burgers, German food and lots of TVs with sports playing.  The place gets loud!",3,3,2
164,Linda C.,"Manhattan, NY",15,22,4,5.0,9/16/2012,"Worth the trek (although it's off the 1 train so it's easy to get to). Although the beer selection is obviously a reason to go by itself, the food is another reason. If you know me, you know I LOVE nachos. This place has the best nachos ever. They make the tortilla chips fresh which keeps every chip cruchy til the end, top it with guac, sour cream and cheese . None of these are at an additional cost which is def a bonus. I got mine with pulled pork - so good.Also tried the burrito, pulled pork sandwich, stuffed mushrooms and mashed potatoes. All seriously delicious. They mix the contents of the burrito which i appreciate since it lets you balance at the flavors. The mashed potatoes were made fresh and were SO effin tasty. Can't wait to go back and taste everything else! They also have some korean flavor mixed in some of the plates. The pulled pork sandwich had kimchi which was actually realy good. I saw they had tacos with kimchi - I'll try that next time and update my post with new comments.",,,

166,Laura K.,"Manhattan, NY",33,17,3,1.0,7/21/2013,"NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN.I can't imagine getting worse service than I got at this place. I came with three of my friends and we sat at a table. Our waitress would walk up every now and then, mutter ""you know what you want?"" and walk away around the time we were done speaking - we were never really sure if she processed what we'd said. At one point, she asked one of my friends if he wanted another beer - everything he'd ordered till that point, they'd been out of - so he was reading the beer list on the wall, and she just walked away. I guess she got tired of waiting. She actually laughed at me when I ordered the mozzarella sticks. LAUGHED.Some more of my friends showed up a little later, and there wasn't enough room at our table, so we wanted to move to the communal table next to us. There was a beer sitting at the end that had been there for a good ten minutes without anyone claiming it, so we assumed that it was abandoned, or if it wasn't, the single solitary beer wouldn't mind moving to a smaller table, and moved it to an empty table to so we could all move over. We weren't at the new table for 45 seconds, when a waitress - not our waitress, but someone she had apparently tattled to, because she was right behind this new waitress - came over and literally started scolding us for ""moving someone else's stuff."" We told her we didn't know where the people were that were drinking it and assumed they'd left, and she started wagging her fingers in our faces, saying they had gone out for a cigarette and ""you can't just move people's things, that's not allowed, if you want to sit somewhere and someone leaves a beer there, it means they're saving the seat"" blahblahblah. Every time we tried to say ""okay, well, we'll just move down one"" she would launch into her sermon again until I finally said ""just bring me the check."" My friends hadn't been putting up with the first pageant winner of a waitress quite as long as I had, and had a lot more patience, so they said ""can we just move these other tables together?"" Reverend Waitress said that was fine and delivered one more rendition of her ""Beer Movers Go To Hell"" tirade, while our original charmer announced, ""you want to move those tables? That would be IMPOSSIBLE."" I was so done at that point, we got the check and wrote a huge THANK YOU!!! across the tip line. I've never been treated so condescendingly at a place where I'm expected to pay (too much) for a service. It was more like a trip to the DMV than to the bar.A chalkboard on the wall said, ""Almost everything on the menu is made fresh, none of that frozen crap here."" Almost. That's great. I guess you get to play Russian roulette to see what the frozen thing on their oh-so-fresh menu is. I played and I think I won - it's the mozzarella sticks. Trust me.I'm a WaHi local, and I can tell you: if I live here for the rest of my life, I'll make my own bar in the mixers aisle of a grocery store before I go back to this place. Save yourself the shame and demoralization and do the same.",6,7,4

You will get a broader selection in many places downtown but not around here. The food is pretty darn good. Mexican and Korean style tacos, grass fed burgers and really tasty Brussels sprouts. Only complaint I have is the noise level during the evening. There's something about the acoustics of the place that make it impossible to have a conversation. My advice is: come here in the afternoon before it gets too crowded.",,,

184,Adam D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,1,2.0,4/22/2012,"This place gets an extra star because of the top notch beer selection and awesome TVs.  With a seating arrangement which capitalizes on space a little more productively, this place could become the perfect place to watch sports.  Before that happens, though, these issues need to be addressed:There is a picture of a voluptuous, decadent, cheeseburger on their website's menu with cheese oozing off of it.  Forgive me for not bothering to read the item description and noticing that cheese is not listed after looking at a picture of the item and seeing gobs of cheese.  The picture of that burger could not be farther from the burger which is actually served.  Exhibit A: buddhabeerbar.com/food-2  Caution: That is not the burger you will receive. I was pretty mad that I walked all the way here from 181st and Riverside for utter garbage.  The steak nachos came out cold with barely any cheese or steak on them.  The cheese which was present on the nachos had clearly been melted some time ago as it had completely re-hardened.  The burger was so small.  Maybe I would not have been so hungry after the tiny burger if the fries hadn't been undercooked and soggy to an inedible degree.  This is coming from someone who generally prefers fries on the softer side. They were so gross.       Service was friendly and attentive.  I really want this place to be good.  Hopefully, this experience was a snafu.  What will bring me to give this spot a chance at redemption is the excellent beer selection and great TV placement.",,,

I'm a dogfishhead fan and belgian beer fan. I will go there. But they are going to have to discount their beer to draw a following. There are few people in the neighborhood that drink high end beer. The orthodox Jewish neighborhood on Bennett street does not drink, and Dominicans drink Corona, Heineken, or Presidente. There is little foot traffic on Bwy and 192 at night, and there are not that many people either. On Broadway you've got Fort Tryon Park  for several blocks (No buildings=NO people). You have a Post office, a Goverment office,  and another 1 block park. Then there is a storage facility, a funeral home, a supermarket, a school, a social security office building, and a police station. That = 0 foot traffic.Attention Buddha Bar Management.Start looking at the neighborhood realistically and come up with plan B.You are not going to have many takers for DFH 90 ipa at $8",1,1,1
