0,,10/4/2017,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Guru F.,0.0,5.0,71,Great fresh juice bar with many veggie and fruit options should you wish to customize.I've also tried their baked goods and found them to be delicious.Nice staff and speedy service to boot!,
1,,4/10/2017,46,,"Cliffside Park, NJ",Mahmood S.,304,3.0,177,"Rating this place 3/5 due to price of the juice drinks they have available and the fact not everything is freshly juiced.For starters 8 bucks for carrot juice is pretty hefty, even if it is a 24 ounce cup of it. That and the fact the fresh vegetables and fruits are pretty limited doesn't help. Had a carrot and orange juice mix drink, carrot was fresh juiced, orange juice came straight out a bottle. I mean, it's not hard to grab an orange, slice it and throw it into the juicer, so why is my ""fresh drink"" coming from a brand name producer? In any case it wasn't bad but it didn't taste the way it should (orange juices fault). It's not a bad idea to drink juice in the morning, I'd stick to what they actually juice next time though.",1

The guy making the salad was super rude. Got up.to the register and was told my salad was $10.88. Why? Because it wasn't a small salad. WHERE IS THE SIGN THAT SAYS THAT??? Would be nice if this was disclosed somewhere. Salad was soggy too. Avoid this dump like the plague.",

5,4,12/14/2015,809,1,"Denver, CO",Maria E.,254,4.0,1585,JUICE REVIEW ONLY! Was looking for a juice spot on my way to the office since I felt a bit under the weather (I walk on 6th and couldn't find anything on Yelp along that route). Noticed a sign that said they offered juice and smoothies. Score! Juices/smoothies were reasonably priced. 5.00 for 12oz. 6.00 for 16oz. 7.00 for 24oz. Got a veggie juice (#4) and it was really good. They also have ginger shots (4.95) in the fridge area.,5
6,,7/19/2016,0,,"Bronx, NY",Jessica R.,11,1.0,13,"AVOID AT ALL COST. I use to order from this place a lot because it is literally one minute away from my job. Now it seems they have just gone down in quality of food and customer service. There was has a few instances where I've been less than pleased with this shop in particular. Shall we discuss? Once I ordered a custom salad with salad dressing on the side. The dressing did not come in the delivery which was fine because the shop is pretty close to my office but i expected for my delivery to come complete. Another time I had an order delivered and neglected to tip online. When I say the delivery guy was not happy about it, he was NOT HAPPY and made sure my whole office knew. Upon arrival he asked for me but someone else took the order then he requested to see me (alarming). I presented myself and he showed me the receipt and asked where his tip was. I was taken aback. How could you ask me for a tip, I think that is really rude. So I said there was none and he proceeded to yell in my office, ""TIP TIP NO TIP, WHY NOT"". I wanted to tell him off and say well you don't get a tip because you walked 5 steps from the store to my office (don't judge my tipping values) but my inner good heart said ""He may need it, give it to him"". So I did and vowed never to order for delivery again. My next unfortunate encounter comes today, when I visited this guy and gallard in hopes of having a delicious breakfast meal to jumpstart my day. I ask the man behind the counter if he could whip up a delicious Avocado Toast for me. He seemed confused so I explained, avocado on top of toasted wheat bread. He seemed to have understood that much. Once he began I let him know that I also wanted 1 hard boiled egg on top of the toast if possible. He pointed to the case across from me and let me know that I could do the eggs myself. (WOW) While he was making the toast I noticed the only open avocado was already browning (so unfortunate). Went out on faith and hoped that that wouldn't be on my toast. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS LET DOWN. It was the saddest Avocado Toast I had ever seen (see pictures for details). Sadder than a Trump rally (yep I went there). Welp. Hope you see this place and save yourself the trouble.",
7,1,2/1/2016,92,,"FOREST HILLS, NY",Edgar B.,3031,4.0,489,First off this place is ridiculously clean and the cooks display their work on the display case. I Had the chicken Marsala with bow tie pasta and roasted veggies. The chicken was made with the right wine reduction to bring out the flavor. Overall the taste was good. Looking forward to go back.,
8,,11/17/2016,2,,"New York, NY",Ingrid A.,4,1.0,5,"Will never be ordering from this place again! Ordered a large salad and I received a small salad in a large container! The salad wasn't even halfway filled. I even called and complained and all they said was that because it was chopped, it looked small. I would hate to see what a small chopped salad looks like then! Ridiculous!!",1

This location recently went through a makeover and looks  a lot nicer than before.

10,,10/16/2015,79,,"Marietta, GA",Cindy A.,209,3.0,209,We came here because we were hungry and the line at the new Chick-fil-a was insanely long. There was plenty of variety here from salads to burgers to sandwiches and make your own pita. I enjoyed my pita sandwich and was glad for was glad for some healthy options.,
11,,6/10/2015,451,,"Astoria, Queens, NY",Amanda H.,2,2.0,7,"This place is mediocre, at best. (And that's giving them more credit than I should). Overpriced, average-tasting food (like most NYC convenience food spots) but this one reigns supreme. It's conveniently located right next to my office, which is why I often visit there. However, after my most recent trip this afternoon, I will seek my food elsewhere. Fresh & Co and Pax Foods are two nearby alternatives that I have no problem walking a little bit further for.Why you ask? My bagel order: Scooped, Double toasted, Cream Cheese & Tomato - The toasters here are not efficient so I must ask for it done twice. And even then, the top of my bagel is still soft when I bite into it. While I do have a particular bagel order, it's one that requires 5 more extra seconds of effort. It's also pretty hard to mess a bagel order up, which they manage to do every time (not scooped, toasted once, etc).My most recent trip this afternoon included me ordering a SMALL cup of chili, chili that was lukewarm, if that, and a whopping SIX DOLLARS AND 50 CENTS. For a SMALL cup. Not to mention the saltine crackers that accompanied it were stale as all hell. I felt like I was eating dog food practically. I got a small cup of better-tasting chili at Fresh and Co a couple of weeks ago that was worth the extra walking distance, and was 1/3 of the price. I will commend this place for one thing: firing that horrid young girl at (or was at) the cash register. I will take my business elsewhere from now on. I've learned my lesson, if it took a couple of times.",1

Its never too busy (compared to other midtown lunch spots), has reasonable prices, lots of food options, and I am usually in and out in 5 min or less.The food is not life-changing, but they do a decent job with the basics, and I actually find the salads to be pretty good because they are less stingy with toppings like chicken than some other places (cough cough Chop't).",

15,,6/11/2016,83,,"New York, NY",Jingbo H.,0,1.0,3,Looks good yet terrible hygiene. Had bad stomach every time!!!! I ate hair several times in my salad...... Strongly not recommend,
16,,3/12/2013,316,,"New York, NY",Jia J.,422,3.0,470,"I even went on my bank statement to make sure of the exact location of this particular franchise, because it was my first exposure to this Midtown chain that first appears alternately too fussy and too pedestrian.And you know what, it wasn't half bad, and that's even without Midtown goggles on (you know, when most things in the area suck and so your standards get lower).How I ended up in the predicament of coming here is that I met up with a friend who really wanted some good tea (also diabolically hard to just stumble upon near Bryant Park) but didn't give a damn where we ate. As we aimlessly walked down 6th past shops bursting with useless non-edibles, we resorted to this Guy & Gallard, which, by the way, was about to close down.I've done food service before. So I know how it feels when some hungry jerk comes busting in right after you've cleaned everything and shut everything down. But you know what? It's fair game. They were still open, so I got the grill boy to fire it up and make me a mushroom and onion burger, rare, with Monterey Jack Cheese and some fries. Mind you, as I gave my order, he just stared blankly at me and kind of nodded after I said twice, ""Is that okay?"" He asked me if I wanted regular fries. I kind of wanted curly, but didn't want to complicate things further, and said, ""Sure, curly."" Meanwhile, I think my gal pal got another hot beverage, and I helped myself to pre-filled cups of Russian dressing, bleu cheese, and ranch in anticipation of all my fry-dipping needs. If these were supposed to be paid for, no one mentioned anything. Whether this was because these sauces are always free or because it was the end of the night and the staff was blinded by desire to get out of there remains unclear. But anyway, I did it in plain view and no one stopped me. Just over 10 buckaroos for the whole meal, which was set down in front of me with the rare parts rare, the hot parts hot, the juicy parts juicy, the crispy parts crispy and the soft parts soft. Not much more to demand at that point. It was a darn decent cheeseburger.Plus, being a naturally slow eater rendered more sluggish because of the fatigue of a particularly rough work week, I was slowwww to finish up. I even had to use the bathroom and get the code from the same cook, who told me what it was without a trace of impatience. At this point, the staff's boyfriends and girlfriends were patiently and quietly hanging out near the front, probably wishing us dead but not showing it.Given all this, even if I usually avoid these free for all deli/prepared foods/grills areas like the plague because of their crowds and noise and hard seating and lack of human touch, the 7th site of Guy & Gallard is a place I woudln't complain about if I ended up there again. In fact, I might TRY to accidentally end up here again on an uninspiring Friday evening for a cheap and satiating eat.",

Point being, I'm a pretty good customer...that they just lost. The girl who runs the cash register is completely snarky and rude for no reason at all. She is extremely inconsistent in what she charges. One day my breakfast wrap comes to 4.89, the next 5.39. We're talking change here, but today it irked me. So I said to her, ""This wrap is always under $5."" She just responds flatly ""the prices have gone up"". I said, ""No actually you change the prices every time I come in here."" She then puts a menu in my bag and says ""the prices have gone up, read the menu.""To this girl: I am sorry your life is SO miserable you feel the need to be SO rude to innocent customers. You aren't the owner, or even a manager. Get over yourself.To the restaurant: you should really have the guys making the sandwiches write the price on stuff so little miss self ego behind the register doesnt just get to make up prices as she goes.

I asked him if he had changed his gloves, to which he replied that he took 1 off- and was now using his 1 bare hand & 1 dirty gloved hand to do this.  He then discarded the old glove to put new ones on.  BIG health violation there!  Won't be back to this location.",
22,,3/7/2012,143,,"Manhattan, NY",Matthew R.,51,1.0,726,I have to say I do enjoy Guy & Gallard and visit a couple times a week. They generally have good muffins and granola and tons of options for breakfast and lunch. The reason for the one star is that yesterday I ordered a Chai with soy milk and was served one with regular milk. I was first suspicious when the employee pulled our a red carton I didn't recognize and filled the soy milk pitcher. I couldn't really read it so I just blew it off. The gas and gastronomic discomfort I've suffered since drinking my Chai leave no questing in my mind that what I received wasn't soy milk. While many might drink soy for it's purported health benefits I drink it so I don't have to run to the bathroom every 10 minutes.,2

I found out about this spot when I worked at Marchesa, my bosses would always come and pick up sandwiches for everyone. this location is closest to my new job. BUT every time I come, the woman at the register ALWAYS charges me a different price. I get the same EXACT sandwich every single time. Why is it that they make up prices? One day my sandwich is $7.75 then $8.59 then another $7.22 then today it was $9.26. Nonetheless the receipt always says something different. Today it says open coffee with tax. They are known for the sandwiches...so it seems they do not have a button on their computer system to put in SANDWICH. Bonkers. Absolutely bonkers. Last time I argued with the manager about it and he threw change at me as my ""refund"" since I said I was overcharged- he was pissed. It's not my fault your business is not consistent.

I was looking at the loaves of bread they had so I know they can make it. Anyway, instead of waiting another 5 minutes and potentially having my food tampered with, I took it after telling him it wasn't what I asked for.

The website advertises hot entrees as well, but apparently not at this one. I arrived about an hour before closing, it was empty and employees were cleaning up, clearly ready to go. I ordered a bacon mushroom and cheddar burger, wasn't sure if the guy heard me, but he nodded. I paid with my coupon, and was tempted to leave so they could finish closing down, but I am skittish around pigeons and squirrels, and the idea of eating my back-up burger outside gave me courage to ask if I could eat it there. The cashier was actually really nice, she said sure! So I sat and watched passersby as I enjoyed the most delicious of burgers! Maybe they were watching me inhale my food. Not gonna lie, it was perfection. Cheese was melted, bacon was crispy (and they didn't skimp on it), patty was iuicy. Yumm!
