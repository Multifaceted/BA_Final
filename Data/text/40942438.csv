0,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,10/1/2017,"Hidden gem near Columbus Circle. A little oasis in the sky atop (albeit 15th floor) the Hudson Hotel. Looks like a lush terrace with greenery and love the flower wall at entry. Seating needs improvement. All the nice seating in back (the comfy couch, etc) is reserved and there's not a whole lot of seats period in the front section. Just a bunch of metal chairs and stools. And no service in front either, you have to go to the bar in back to get your drink. Sauvignon blanc I got was awful.Didn't appreciate the snippy hostess as she saw me pass by twice and on third time still insisted on asking if my glass was from the bar up here or downstairs (plastic vs glass) - I was annoyed as she clearly saw me pass by her twice already. View is not the best I've seen from a rooftop (some buildings and a slight view of the Hudson River), but I like the fact that this place is not well known so it's a bit more tame and quiet and chill. There's also a beautiful patio on the lobby level of the hotel. Cute place I'd definitely come back to.",2,,4

Now, when you take the elevator up, signs point to a door at the end of the hall, where you'll be in a creepy staircase area, with dirty towels piled in the corner. Why? because the hotel is apparently for sale... and for some reason, they've closed up this stunning spot and view.Heads up, you've been warned.",6,,
2,Anna N.,"Manhattan, NY",61,199,240,4.0,6/4/2017,"This rooftop bar has a nice view of the Westside. It isn't as nice or big as Press Lounge, but it's good enough for a drink. If you don't like it, there's 4 beautiful bars/drinking areas downstairs in the Hudson  hotel. I was actually looking for their Library bar but found this upstairs. I was surprised how spacious their other bars were downstairs. It wasn't overcrowded.  I always hear about Press Lounge but never about this place. Hidden gem here.",3,1,3
3,William J.,"New York, NY",276,112,78,4.0,5/19/2018,"Solid rooftop bar with good food. View is obstructed though and it tends to get crowded and loud. It's attached to a hotel like most rooftop bars in the city and you have to go into the hotel like a regular guest and then just head to the top floor. I like their salads. The restaurant management company that runs it also does other hotel restaurants in NYC, so you may recognize some dishes on their menu from sister establishments. Watch out for sunburns at lunch time, if you sit in the uncovered section you get a LOT of direct sunlight.",,,

Well the guys serving drinks were.Not exactly good upstairs at this bar for a big crew but for a small group of 4-5 you can swing it. Ladies, there are two bathrooms towards the opposite if entrance. Just so you know. One is less visible than other.Are drinks expensive -yes of course. Lpl 18 dollar wines that are not terrible but not horrible either. Well, I know about the whites, not the reds. No teeth staining for me. LolIt's not mind blowing but it is nice. A decent place to finish off a long night if on a date. The whole hotel has a lot of offerings.

The patio winds around the roof, and offers lots of seating, including hammocks, but we still had to search for 2 spots together, as many people were enjoying the breezy summer weather. I didn't notice any servers so I meandered to the bar, which had a short line with only one bartender. She was quick, though, and made a great cocktail. Unfortunately, Sky Terrace closed at 10pm on this Sunday night & bouncer-type men went around repeatedly asking everyone to leave. Next time, we'll know to visit earlier.",1,1,2
10,Michelle O.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",59,126,184,5.0,9/16/2016,"I'm hesitant to leave a review because I want this place to remain an undiscovered gem. The Sky Terrace is hands down my favorite rooftop bar in the city. Sure, it doesn't have breathtaking views like the other one hundred rooftop bars in Manhattan, but the setting is just perfect. Because not many people know about this place, it's always peaceful and calming when I visit. There's a wide variety of seating options too - including a hammock, bed/couch, regular seats and more. They don't attract your typical rooftop bar crowd, but rather, people who want to relax, read a book or enjoy the breeze. Love it.Drinks are of course, on the pricier side, but you're mostly paying for the ambience. The watermelon sangria is TO DIE FOR. One of my favorite drinks of all time. Bartenders are friendly and approachable too. Next time you're sight-seeing around midtown and need a break, check this place out. Grab a drink, sit back and enjoy some peace and quiet in the middle of the city. But don't tell your friends  or else it's going to get crowded real quick.... Just kidding. Spread the love. Or not... Up to you.",6,2,1

Updated review","I should mention that I am a huge fan of the Hudson hotel. My friends and I love the bars downstairs (the library, commons, and club), and we were looking forward to visiting the rooftop once it opened this spring. Sadly, we had a comically terrible experience. The good:The rooftop offers striking views, with lush insta-worthy landscape and greenery. The not so good:Drinks are extremely over priced ($17+), and while delicious, they were not strong, and filled with ice. Our waitress delivered the water for our table in a 3/4 empty pitcher, and, I kid you not, had dirt particles and a dead bug inside (Frankly, I feel bad the bug had to die in such a dreadful setting). Shortly after, we received the incorrect drinks (a melted, iceless glass of what tasted like lychee and vodka), and politely asked for the correct order (3 frozen Roses). Rather than apologizing, she proceeded to tell us they were now ""out"" of the frozen rose ; ours was ""melted"" because we had the very end of the batch, but it WAS the right order. We were seated at a rickety table (aka that kind that dumps drinks on you). When we asked if this could be fixed, the hostess replied ""oh! Is that the broken top one?! I'll see what I can do"". Of course, nothing was done. The hostess stated there was table service only; meanwhile, the group sitting next to us ordered from the bar the entire time, never encountering the dreadful service. Overall, these issues need to be addressed ASAP; the space has so much potential and I hope to return once they're resolved.",1,,
12,Kyle B.,"Miami, FL",63,20,33,5.0,8/6/2017,"Great place to lounge and catch a sunset. On the 15th floor of the Hudson hotel. Not too crowded, usually there is a table or reclining chair to sit at. Real plants growing around you. Cocktails in the 15-20$ range.",,,
13,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",608,466,229,4.0,7/7/2015,"Summary: Slightly less interesting view.  Great drinks.  Well designed for private get together or for socializing.  Perfect refined, but chilled out rooftop vibe.Atmosphere: It's very refined and chilled out on this rooftop.   If I wanted to look nice on a roof, this would definitely be on the list. This is slightly nicer than the outdoor space downstairs in the same hotel.  You could definitely take a date here (meaning I have been on a date here).  There is no massively loud music, so great for a conversation.The Service:  This is one of few where I recall pretty good service. There is also a bar if you can't wait to get your drink on.  The crowd: This is more a professional late-20's to 50's crowd. I would recommend dressing up, though you could - technically go casual if you can carry it well.The Drinks: Delicious.  They do cocktails well here and have curated what makes sense given the weather.",3,1,3
14,Orinda K.,"Manhattan, NY",169,156,105,4.0,7/4/2016,"I like this place - mostly because so few people know of it so it's probably best not to even leave a review, but I will.This is a rooftop in a hotel that I think only those that actually know it exists go to. The ambience is very relaxing and peaceful. Music is low. You can see people with books just drinking and reading. It is a very relaxed atmosphere and you don't find that too often in NYC rooftops.Drinks are OK. I like this place more for the quiet and peace and seclusion. Also the views from the roof are very nice as well.I recommend it!!",3,1,1

16,Susan T.,"Astoria, NY",112,232,621,4.0,6/7/2015,Great views from the 15th floor rooftop. Drinks are about $16 but worth the price for the ambience and views. We came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was not too packed. Waiter was nice enough to let us sit in the reserved section. Definitely will come back on another night. Only thing that bothered me was the waitress didn't come back with my change $20 for $16 and assumed I'd just give her a $4 tip. All they did was pour a drink!,1,1,

I'm writing this review as a warning to all the other people who might get tricked by their social groups into coming here.Friends of friends chose this joint, so being the the affable fellow I am, I made the hike out from Brooklyn. I sauntered up to the bar and ordered up a glass of Merlot. Cost, you ask? $18.So I drank down the swill in a huff, and then I went downstairs to the corner drugstore, bought a tallboy of Coors Light, and chugged it on the street. With my anger slightly dulled, I went back up and ordered nothing else that night.The views are of buildings. The crowd is non-New Yorkers who think they're having a New York EXPERIENCE.I should open up a bar like this. Apparently, people love being gouged.",3,6,1

23,Jen F.,"Washington, DC",402,137,88,2.0,7/1/2015,"What a hidden gem! You don't even know the Hudson hotel had a Sky Terrace unless someone who knew someone knew of this place. The vibe of the rooftop could have been a lot more pleasant if the hostess was accommodating. We pulled a chair from another table (that was not being used) to our table and she came to our table and took it away to put it back at the other table. Why? We don't know. It was rude and uncomfortable to continue to be there. The actual waitresses at the Sky Terrace uniforms consist of bikinis and cover ups. Our waitress was sweet, but with the terrible Kim Kardashian-wannabe hostess, I could have gone to another rooftop and had a better time.",2,,
24,Rebel H.,"New York, NY",0,60,5,1.0,6/10/2017,"One star for this rooftop terrace.  The one star is because of the customer service (or lack thereof).  Arrived around 7:00 pm.  Was seated by the host and was provided a menu.  The space is beautiful and the menu selections looked good.  However, at no point did the one waitress who was working approach my table.  The woman was exceptionally busy as she seemed to be the only server present.  However, the issue is with the hostess, who spent most of the time standing around doing nothing while the waitress worked on attending to the customers.  At one point I called the hostess in the hope that she would take the order. She indicated that waitress would do this,not her.  So I continued to wait another fifteen minutes (during which the hostess could have taken the order for my party).  Ultimately after 30 minutes we got up and left without being attended to once.  Very disappointed.  It is such a beautiful space.  Too bad for the horrible management.",,,

Will definitely go back.",,,
27,E E.,"San Francisco, CA",4978,499,710,3.0,1/23/2013,"I love hammocks. There is a shortage of hammocks in the world but especially true in Manhattan. To my knowledge this is the only rooftop bar with a hammock so that's definitely a plus but there is only one hammock available and usually this tourists occupy it for hours on end (if the hotel needs help turning people over after 60 minutes, I am more than happy to help - just an fyi).The views here are not the great either blocked by other buildings or views of HK (not that great). But a rooftop bar is a rooftop bar and since there are hardly any near UWS, I am thankful for them being around. I will say that in most cases the rooftop bar is the most popular bar for establishments but in this case it's not true. The Library Bar downstairs is much better.Not sure how often they rotate beer selections but the last time I went here (Fall 2012) they were serving up a hometown beer of mine (Watermelon beer from 21st Amendment SF) which is a great summer beer to offer.As far as the crowds, it's more tourists / laid back guests. No fist-pumping, bro-hugs going on here (which is expected given the floor plan and the abundance of lawn chairs for lying down).",2,2,5

30,Lucy C.,"New York, NY",131,1173,43,4.0,3/27/2016,"Came here last night and absolutely loved it! Let me start off by saying that the lighting at night is kind of bad, which might be a good thing (if you think about it hard enough). Now on to the good stuff. If you come on a night with great weather, you won't find a better secluded spot. Designed like a garden, the place is covered in fines and large plants. If you look up at the sky, there are even botanical pieces there too. It's a bit more upscale and the crowd is a bit older, but the drinks are fantastic. Bartenders are beyond friendly (and cute!). One even named a drink after me. They specialize in Tequila drinks apparently, but definitely try the gin cocktails if you're a fan. I was also lucky enough to come on Burger Fest. About a dozen burger places were dishing our half-size burger samples all night, completely for free! Had I known, I would've skipped dinner because trust me you will not stop making rounds trying them all (again and again). There was a fried-pickle one on an English muffin. A spicy southern one. Classic burgers. Best Angus beef burgers ever. More... but burger coma made me forget what I exactly had... Seating might be hard to find but people move around a lot. A couple cute bars/lounges in the Hudson hotel for people to hop around so you'll get a cozy spot if you're patient. Will definitely be back!",,,
31,Risa D.,"Montreal, Canada",2494,1281,4385,4.0,6/7/2012,"When you walk past an inconspicuous doorman at a set of double doors and peep a set of glowing escalators leading upwards behind him, you're almost there. At the top of the escalators, gasp at the dim wood and lofty greenery of the hotel lobby, then hang a left and get in the elevators to the 15th floor. At the top, hang a left again in a small hallway, walk through the door that says Sky Terrace and you've arrived at an incredible manhattan view, hammocks and beds, trees and cabana chairs: a perfect day time drinks oasis for a certain mood to splurge. Reminds me of sky bar at the Mondrian in LA; i.e. lovely during the day, potentially douchey at night (just a guess?)The tables are small and rickety, but if you kick them over and spill your drinks the bartender will kindly give you new ones because I think this must happen all the time (me and the lady next to me both made a mess of this classy joint, but at least we were in it together.)",4,4,3

34,Alexandra S.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/2/2015,"If I could give the terrace 0 stars, I would. We booked what was supposed to be a fun birthday celebration at this location for 50 people, which the hotel was aware of before we arrived. Despite the size of the group, only one waitress was staffed and was not accommodating at all, even nasty at times. When drinks were ordered they did not come out for a minimum of 40 minutes, if at all. In two hours, I received one drink despite ordering five, which we were probably charged for.  The drink did not have any alcohol in it. The waitress told me they had no rum other than Captain or dark rum even though they were serving mojitos, which should have had light rum in them considering what we were charged.  It makes no sense to me how a bar could not be stocked with the basics. Aside from the absolutely horrible experience during the 1.5 hours in the terrace, a whole group of people not only got stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes but also dropped 3 floors in the broken elevator. When we complained of the issue the manager told me ""if you look at our reviews online that is a common complaint"" as if that is comforting. I would never ever go back to this location even if I was paid to. Beware and do not subject yourself to this terrace.",2,,

At least, I can benefit from the food and settings, right?Everything about this place was dark and seductive. The food was excellent and the portions were more than sufficient. The server was a gentleman and I regret channeling my disappointments at him instead of my perpetrator. The open view served as a wonderful distraction to words left unsaid.

Incredibly stupid setup.Giant trees take up a bunch of space along the edges where you would stand or peer from while your sitting making a lot of views very green. However the real problem lies in there is only one bar so you can wait a very long time for drinks and if you come up here make sure you had something to eat. Cause even if you come up for an event like 4th of july there is no food. you can't order from downstairs you cant go downstairs and bring any up so if you want to save your limited viewing angles get there early and stand in one spot until the show is over, maybe you can sneak some lifesavers in your gf purse",,,1

My friend and I were looking for the sky terrace and the bartenders happily directed us to where it would be located. Once you go up to the 15th floor, it's like a whole different serene environment (probably because it was also a Wednesday afternoon) where you can step away from the city's usual hustle and bustle just for the time being and just lay on a hammoch if you so desire.

The rooftop has tall pillars around the periphery with creepers growing on them, which makes for a rooftop garden feel.Incidentally the main floor of the hotel, has another open air restaurant which has great food and is VERY popular BUT it does not good views since it is more like a veranda on a lower level than a rooftop. Anyway I write this because you can get confused into thinking that is the rooftop because you see it as soon as you enter, and it is quite a popular place, and while worth visiting, it is different from the rooftop!",,,
50,Rosana L.,"New York, NY",0,4,3,3.0,7/6/2016,"I'm giving this three stars because although I had a fun night there, there wasn't anything outstanding which made me want to immediately return. The outside area is OK - its walled in so it's not as open as other rooftops in the city. It is sandwiched between the library bar (beautiful decor, pool table and chess to play with and decent cocktails despite the bartender rushing through them) and a sports style bar with louder music, lots of TV screens and a kitchen doing fast food. The drinks at the sports bar were pricier than I would have expected. We went on a Friday night around 10 - 1am and it never got crowded. they close off the outside section early so we finished up in the sports bar, which seemed to be dying out by the time we left",,,
51,Gabby D.,"San Jose, CA",49,83,129,4.0,1/20/2013,"Enjoy a glass of wine or cocktail at the Hudson Sky Terrance. Plan on going around sunset and sit towards the back passing the bar. Great view of the city. The bar has a warm, relaxing and inviting feel to it. The greenery of the plants and lights help you forget that you are in the middle of a bunch of buildings. About $15 a drink from what I remember.",1,,
52,David H.,"Boston College, MA",22,214,0,4.0,8/31/2012,"Great location UWS near Columbus Circle and Time Warner. Nice spacious roof terrace. Comfortable atmosphere with lounge seating. Good drinks and decent wines by the glass. Good for a casual drink, group, date, meeting",1,,
53,Greg K.,"Oxnard, CA",14,147,12,4.0,6/17/2012,"The Sky Terrace is an absolutely lovely NYC Midtown venue to have a casual drink at in an inviting outdoor setting with expansive southern views of the city and Hudson River from the exposed 15th floor of the Hudson Hotel. Airondack chairs, hammocks, bistro tables, benches and planters line a scalloped southern facing terrace with drink requests being serviced by both a small bar and attentive wait staff. The terrace is open to the public and doesn't have a cover charge for admittance so scoping it out can be done on the down low. Drinks are pricey even by NYC standards but really a bargain when you factor in the overall ambiance and savor the experience.",1,,1
54,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/8/2014,"Hostess is so rude!  Drinks are way overpriced.  Very touristy.  We accidentally sat at a reserved table, and she was so rude about asking us to move.  We then moved to another open table, and she rudely approached us again about moving.   She asked if we would like to speak to a manager about it, we said yes, and she never sent the manager over.   Don't waste your time.",2,1,
55,Isabelle R.,"New York, NY",74,116,74,5.0,7/31/2014,"I'm not much for your typical rooftop crowd but this place is very different. It's casual and relaxed, and the best part is that on the days the bar is closed (Sunday and Monday) you can still go up. On those days it's extra quiet and you can enjoy the hammock, the lounge chairs, the view, and your company. Get the drinks downstairs.",,,1
56,Lyala H.,"New York, NY",0,68,39,4.0,7/24/2014,Went here for a friends bday... LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This place is amazing. Awesome views and super cute. I took one star away because the line for the drinks was not long at all but with only one bar tender we waited 25 min before we could even put in an order. Almost missed the sunset.,,,1

58,Claire S.,"Sunderland, United Kingdom",0,1,0,2.0,9/26/2014,Had high hopes for the sky terrace but was quite let down. The atmosphere is lovely and the views are nice but had to wait ages for drinks even though we had booked a table and it wasn't busy. There were a few of us so we tried a selection of cocktails - they were all fairly average.,,,
59,Chris L.,"New York, NY",0,16,8,4.0,9/19/2013,Great atmosphere. Lost one star because there yelp info says this space is for hotel patrons only and it took me 15 min & 3 calls to find out that it is open to the public.,1,,1
60,Rob G.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",17,132,0,4.0,7/3/2014,This place is awesome. I never knew the rooftop was even here. The views are pretty decent and the drinks are great (slightly pricey). It wasn't too crowded either which is a plus if you want to just hang out at a place like this. The main downside is that they do not let you bring food onto the roof and don't serve either. Some food would've definitely made me stay longer but still a good spot regardless.,,,

62,Steven E.,"Manhattan, NY",28,81,0,5.0,10/19/2011,"I'm a huge fan of Sky Terrace.It's definitely one of the hottest spots, if not the hottest spot I've been to in nyc.  It's trendy to the max yet not tacky at all.  The lighting is very intimate, plants everywhere, tons of lounge chairs, beds, and even a hammock.  There are a few winding walk ways which lead you to a bar that looks like a little villa.  It's usually relatively quiet, has a good looking clientele, and provides an amazing view.  Waitresses walk around offering you drinks in case you and maybe that special someone are too comfortable on that hammock to go to the bar.Check this place out one night before winter.  It's sexy.",,,
63,Geraldine K.,"New York, NY",162,483,0,5.0,7/23/2010,"Fantastic space for a summer party. There are small tables and chairs, spread throughout the rooftop and even a hammock! There is even a small, but active bar - can't be without that! This place is for hot, attractive people, and they seem to know that! So service is good but a bit snobby.  However, it's a pain to get up to the 15th - literally took me 10 minutes.  Again, this place is fantabulous. Great venue in a great location!",3,,1

65,Sara W.,"New York, NY",129,107,0,1.0,5/16/2009,"Well, lah dee dah.We saw a landscaped terrace with people on it from the street, and thought ""why not?"" Here's why not:We emerged onto a crowded wraparound terrace with lounge chairs and a hammock. A short man with a faux mohawk wrinkled his nose, shoved a menu in my hand, and set us free to wander.We searched among the oxford-and-chino wearing, hair gelled, euro-wannabe crowd and their cigars for two seats together. It was rough, but we found a little table. The black-clad waitress took the orders of the people next to us. Long wait. The people across from us. Long wait. Then she went and talked to two jetsetters across the terrace. Still waiting.I sh*t you not, we waited for a half hour while the people around us were served, and all the newcomers orders were taken. The b*tch didn't look at us once. (Is now an appropriate time to say that we were perfectly well dressed and cute?)Good thing, too, because the drinks on the menu didn't have prices on them. Uh-oh. Wine by the glass was $15 and up, but drinks were priceless. There WAS a note that a 20% gratuity would be added to our check. If we ever got a drink. Which we didn't. We gave the waitress five more minutes, after which we decided we'd stroll the deck, take in the view, and leave. Nice view.  Money well not spent. Sky Terrace, you are not worthy.",7,8,2
66,Tim W.,"Manhattan, NY",119,528,359,4.0,9/7/2010,"Adirondack chairs, wisteria, panoramic sunset, and the hint of a fall breeze!  Perfect start to the evening.  The service can be a little lacking, but that is now why one heads to the terrace.",,,
67,Ange l.,"ASTORIA, NY",2,20,0,5.0,1/8/2012,"This was one of the first places I went to when I moved to NYC and thinking about it still warms the cockles of my heart. So peaceful and beautiful.

68,David M.,"New York, NY",0,12,1,3.0,10/2/2012,"Really cool, intimate setting.  A hidden gem on 57th and 9th.   Get there right after work for a bed or table.  Service was pretty good and the drinks were too. Wine only so-so and a bit overpriced.  NO FOOD.  And they close down at 9.  But it has an old new york charm you can't beat.  Great first date place i bet.",,,
69,Erika C.,"San Francisco, CA",266,929,3205,4.0,8/13/2011,"Came when there were people.  It was nice.  Came much later, after midnight, I think, and there was almost no one.  It was awesome.",1,,
70,Shannon M.,"San Francisco, CA",25,107,5,5.0,6/26/2007,"Way up upon the 15th floor of the Hudson, there is a little slice of the Bahamas.  Lounge chairs with rolled towels, beverage service, 360 degree sunshine...you can almost hear the waves crashing against the shore (if it wasn't for those honking taxi's, that is... ;-)  Really, the Sky Terrace almost makes The Hudson worth staying at.  It's fantastic.  If you're really lucky, you might score the oversized hammock or the day bed plush with fluffy throw pillows.  If you're just sorta lucky, you can park your bum next to a 6'4"" Nordic named Sven.The Sky Terrace is only opened seasonally so check beforehand on the dates/hours.  If you're feeling adventurous (and coincidentally smartly coiffed in Hudson-black), check it out on the DL.....without checking into the miniscule chambers they pretend to call hotel rooms.",4,,4
71,Casey T.,"Manhattan, NY",16,31,1,4.0,9/21/2011,"I'm definitely a fan!  This place is in my neighborhood (crazy-town) but Sky Terrace offers a bit of tranquility in the craziness that is midtown NYC.  The views are amazing.  The seating, though limited, is comfy and if you are lucky enough to snag the hammock, it's a wonderful spot to cuddle up with some arm-candy.  The service can be slow but with the view/atmosphere, I've never minded here.  The drinks are strong so the price is fine, again, considering the atmosphere.  I will definitely be returning time and time again weather-permitting.",,,
