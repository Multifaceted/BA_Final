0,My N.,"Tampa, FL",665,135,248,5.0,10/28/2018,A very fun speak-easy! I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a chill night out. You do have to make reservations earlier in the day since the place is pretty small. Not sure if I was hungry or the food items were surprisingly good given their names/descriptions. Our server was also a pro at taking instax pics *u*,1,,1
1,Gary L.,"New York, NY",113,41,16,3.0,10/12/2018,"Came here at 8pm on a Wednesday without a reservation, and was quoted a 45 minute wait. They took my number and told me they'd call me. My friend and I then went to another bar a couple of blocks away to wait. I turned my phone over so I wouldn't be distracted but accidentally missed their call, and I noticed about 3 minutes after they called. I tried calling back but they didn't answer.We decided to walk back to Please Don't Tell as we assumed our table was ready. We get there and they tell me that our table was given away because we didn't answer the phone, and it would be a 10-15 minute wait. My friend and I decided to wait, except 10 minutes turned into 40, and multiple follow-ups with the hostess. Finally we got seated at around 10. The speakeasy itself had a cool vibe, it wasn't just a young crowd or an old crowd, it was pretty mixed which was nice. The drink I had was quite good. Can't remember what it was called but it was the girliest one on the menu.",1,2,
2,Nancy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,502,1215,4.0,9/14/2018,This is a cool place to hang out. It's a speakeasy so calling to make reservations is highly suggested if you are with a group. You enter through a hot dog restaurant next door which is interesting.Their drinks are good. I had wine and my friends had cocktails. I also had their hot dog and it was delicious! I think they might work with their next door neighbors.Their hot dog had corn and beans and tasted like a burrito and a hot dog at the same time.,2,2,6
3,Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4699,2638,17919,5.0,9/7/2018,"My friend and I stood outside on the street, completely unable to find Please Don't Tell. We looked around dazed & confused, kept going over the number until we finally walked into Crif Dogs desperate to find the entrance. Legit, it took us about 10 minutes to figure out how the F to find the secret entrance to Please Don't Tell. Well played, speakeasy, well played.Please Don't Tell recommends making reservations and I'd concur even if off times & weekdays to be safe. When my friend and I went, we got in just be the skin of our teeth (#idiomsftw) because someone had seconds before cancelled their reservation. We snagged the last couple seats at the bar and were feeling like rockstars.  It's dark and romantic, I'm sure scoring big to impress dates with a secluded little speakeasy. You can also order some eats from Crif while you are sipping on your drinks. PDT is a mostly cocktail bar but they do have a selection of beer & wine, as well. While my friend and I were there we had the Peeking Duck and Katz' Meow both $16. I'm not going to pretend we ordered these drinks for any reason more than the ingredients sounded like incredibly unique creations. The Perkin Duck has a myriad of ingredients in it including ginger & soy sauce - pretty cool! We had one drink and found them both to be one-of-a-kind but perhaps a bit too interesting for our tastes. Really fun place to definitely hit up while doing a barhop in the area! You won't regret it!",17,13,18
4,Su C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,66,188,4.0,11/18/2018,"The infamous hidden bar in e. Village that I finally got to try. Although we knew it was hidden, it was still hard to find since the door was sort of hidden with an old phone inside of a fastfood take out shop which was pretty cool. I know there is usually waiting but we actually got here 15 minutes before the opening hour so we were one of the first ones to get in. The place is extremely small with only a couple of tables and a bar with about 10 stools. The drinks were super expensive but the vibe is built into it, so I was okay with it. Definitely worth a visit!",,,
5,Marietta C.,"New York, NY",49,130,2824,2.0,7/28/2018,"So we've been trying to get into PDT for MONTHS and we finally did! I was pleasantly disappointed.Ever since we moved to NY there's been a huge rave about PDT. I was so excited going through the ""hot dog"" place to find this cool, secluded, exclusive, mysterious, little phone booth where you call to try to get in. After multiple tries, phone calls, etc, we were never able to get in until now. We passed by on a Sunday afternoon at about 6pm and they told us they'd call us just make sure to stick around the area.After a good hour or two, we finally got the call! We rushed back and we were ecstatic. After finally making it past the little phone booth and mysterious door, we get in to the real deal, the real room. It's dark, exclusive, filled with taxidermy, woodsy, antique-y. We had just had dinner and drinks elsewhere so we thought of just sharing a drink, it was four of us so we would only order 3 drinks. Well, you had a minimum of one drink and one drink only. They were ""too busy"" to even let us order two. We were all forced to have one drink but that's all we could have. I asked for recommendations to their drinks and mentioned how much I love aperol so they recommended one of their drinks, Queen Crimson. Basically, once I got my drink it was an 8 oz cup filled not even fully by a HUGE ice cube. If I were to take it out my cup probably wouldn't even take up of one third of the drink which just tasted like a cheap rosè. I had no energy to complain about the drink since they were already complaining about us ordering one drink each and not having time to serve us two drinks. Truthfully, I was disappointed by the rave, the drinks. I tried all 3 drinks that our friends ordered and I wasn't impressed. Very watered down and weak. Nothing special.If mix going to have such an exclusive, elite, special spot where you can hardly get in, be rushed and pressured, where they only sell drinks, then it bette be the BEST drink of my life. Instead, it was meh. I've had better drinks in a chili's for happy hour. Well, not really, but you get the point! Bottom line, you gotta go at least once if you're in NY. Don't have high hopes. Don't order more than one drink.",7,3,1
6,Stuart G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",139,89,35,5.0,8/3/2018,"Made reservations here for a friends birthday and it is very cool. It's is a speakeasy, You go down into the hotdog front and there is a phone booth you go into and call. They then let you in through the phone booth.Bar has a very cool chilled vibe. It's a little dark but looks very cool and has a great setting. Cocktails are all $16 which is very reasonable for this area and experience. There is a great variety, I especially enjoyed the pacific crest and Benton's old fashioned.Staff and friendly and quick and keep up the speakeasy vibe, Santi was our server and she was awesome.The hot dogs are great too, we came out and got a selection of hotdogs recommended by Zoe the server out there. The bacon wrapped hotdogs are amazing with some awesome toppings.They also serve beer here, I got sip of sunshine which is an awesome beer and not many places serve it.",1,1,
7,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,2.0,6/18/2018,"If you're going to make a place exclusive and difficult to get in I would hope you meet at least half my expectation. On Friday at 3pm I was calling non-stop to get a reservation. By 3:30pm a woman finally picked up and said it's fully booked for the night. My friend and I dropped by at 8pm to put our names down. We were quoted 3 hours.In the past they always claimed to contact us via phone call when the table is ready. They never did. Most of the time I get impatient and just forget about it. I guess this would happen frequently when you tell your customers the wait is 3 hours. However, on this particular night I called to check the status of my wait after 1.5 hours. My table was ready! Great! Except she told me to be there within 5 mins. I ran like my life was on the line. We were seated by the bar. Ordered some drinks and food. The drinks came quickly but they were both underwhelming. On the bright side, the hotdogs and tater tots were very good! But that credit goes to Crif dogs. It's honestly not worth your time or money. I really thought I'd be missing out.",2,2,
8,Priscilla M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,8,5.0,11/5/2018,"We are visiting from San Antonio, Tx. I heard about PDT at a seminar about 5 years ago, which included word of mouth marketing. The facilitator was speaking about The Crif Dogs a hot dog stand with a phone booth that lead to the a separate bar. I told everyone when I get to NY this is on the list of places to see. The first visit was with family and kids, so we didn't make it! The next visit we made it to the location, we were early but there was already a line. When the host came out I asked; is there availability? She said ""no""! I asked, is there anyway we can at least have a drink? She said she can fit us in for an hour; so drinks only it is! It was worth it! It's not a party place, it's very laid back atmosphere! Thank you to the wonderful host mission accomplished!",,,
9,Joshua W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",89,112,56,4.0,8/21/2018,"Good, not quite legendary.I've been wanting to come to PDT for years, as it is arguably the most famous bar in NYC. Yes it's a speakeasy. However, that is honestly the most tired bar ""twist"" these days.More notable is the bar itself. It's fairly small, but offers very good cocktails and delicious food (honestly, the hot dogs, from the neighboring joint, but served at PDT, were the highlight of the night). We each had 2 cocktails, all of which were very good.Why the four stars, then? The experience was poor. Our servers were not amiable, and showed no interest in discussing the cocktails with us. Frankly, they were aloof.The 4 stars here are for the bartender and the next-door hot dog chef. PDT is worth going to for the drinks and its reputation alone! You'll have a very good time. That said, it is not quite at the top tier of cocktail bars.",1,,
10,Sasha H.,"Toronto, Canada",128,118,1256,5.0,3/27/2018,"The not so secret ""secret"" bar. Wobble into the hotdog place, walk into the telephone booth and dial one. Then You get a person open the door for you asking how they can help you. The interior is pretty small and the vibe is very different from the hotdog side. The wait was lengthy (approx 1.5 hours) but worth it. The cocktails are delicious and bartender can cater to your drinking needs. The drinks are about $15 on average but taste delicious and quiet strong. The waffle fries are delicious and come with melted cheese. The bathroom is cool looking as well with the broken mirror pieces.",3,2,3
11,Steph M.,"Lincoln, RI",94,41,0,5.0,10/13/2018,This place was so cool! My brother and I were in the city with friends that were visiting from out of town when my brother told us about the speak easy. We immediately wanted to go so he called to get us a reservation and they were able to accommodate us. We went into the hot dog place and did what we had to do. The decor was awesome I felt like I was taken to a different time and the drink menu was super cool! I could see myself coming back!,1,,
12,Chris P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",378,97,45,3.0,7/10/2018,"TL;DR: There are countless speakeasies for better $16 drinks, shorter waits, and more interesting decor.*** FINDING IT ***It's inside the Crif Dogs in the phone booth on the left. Go inside and dial 1 and wait. The host(ess) will greet you and tell you a wait time, ranging from 45 min - the day you turn 80. *** AMBIANCE ***It was nice, but it wasn't impressive. *** DRINKS ***I'm no connoisseur of mixology but I do know what I like. The more *subtle* drinks were a bit too bland for my taste. Yes, the key flavors--like fennel, thyme, maple syrup, etc--were barely detectable, but the overall drinks themselves felt uninspired. *** SERVICE ***Bartenders were both fantastic and explained every drink in detail that I asked about.",4,2,
13,Aveeda G.,"Parker, CO",199,364,1637,5.0,1/18/2018,"My younger brother recently turned 21 so we celebrated with a trip to NY and Please Don't Tell was at the top of our must-do list.Starting at 3pm on the dot, you have to give them a call to make same-day reservations. I set my alarm and at exactly 3 I called and it was busy- and it was exactly the same for the next 30 minutes. When someone finally picked up, I was able to make a reservation for 2 at midnight (the earliest available). You also have the option of going as a walk-in beginning at 6 or 6:30pm each night, but they won't allow for both. Supes exclusive huh? I dug it. It's not a speakeasy if they don't make you work for it,  right?Just look for Crif Dogs, a small, inconspicuous hot dog shop and once inside, go into the tiny phone booth to the left. We had some time to kill so we ate a little bit before going in - they do have a small menu of food for you to order from once you're in there, so it's okay if you go hungry.I picked up the red phone,  dialed 1 and let them know we had a reservation. After a few minutes, they opened the door and let us into a dark room with a small bar and a few booths. Intimate and speakeasy AF. We were seated at the bar which was perfect for the two of us. They have a good amount of drinks on the menu - all of them unique with ingredients that I guarantee will leave you confused. For example, the Peking Duck has a million ingredients including Aylesbury Duck Vodka, Lemon Juice, Ginger and SOY SAUCE - we weren't quite brave enough for this, but I am willing to bet it was good. I ordered a fairly familiar Mezcal Mule (mix anything with ginger beer and I'll drink it) and it was strong and delicious. The brother ended up ordering something that had coffee in it and that too was surprisingly good. They have some top notch mixologists here, no doubt. Our bartender (I wish I remembered his name) was friendly and super helpful. I think he even wrote a book? I've been meaning to google this. The drinks may seem a little scary at first, but definitely strong and yummy. Pricey? Yes, but what speakeasy isn't? We ordered two drinks each, took in the cool vibe and the mounted wildlife on the walls, and had a great time. Would definitely recommend for something different to do in the city.",13,1,1
14,Kate E.,"Cambridge, MA",181,71,11,5.0,6/26/2018,"One of the most memorable bars!We went as a group of four on a Sunday( some tips below on actually getting in) and were delighted with two rounds of cocktails. First round we ordered off the menu. On par with what I expect for a $16 craft cocktail- delicious with good presentation. I have had better/more innovative cocktails but there wasn't anything to complain about. For the second round we decided to get a little frisky! We all told the waitress things we liked and got surprise cocktails. She returned with cocktails- complete with one which had fire( no time here for pics of that as it has a speakeasy rather than showy feel). We all enjoyed round two as much as round one. We also had tater tots, fries, onion rings, and hot dogs( some during setting and some just as we exited). They were good- especially cheese tots. Honestly, skip the onion rings and waffle fries unless only like those as tots were crispier and better. Hot dogs were tasty as a dog could ever be and hit the spot and helps balance out the evening's expense. I have no issues paying the drink prices here ( which are really only slightly above NYC standards) because the experience is  top notch. If you are casual with some inner fanciness or vice versa this is your spot!Entering through phone booth is definitely fun but since so well known some of its quirkiness is lost. The inside of the bar is dark with taxidermy and feels like an escape from the city. I had a res but we were not sat until about 20 minutes after that- don't come if on a tight schedule. Now on the reservations:From what I can tell they have about 15-25 phone lines and just pick one to answer. I may be wrong but this was my observation of the phone and management. We went on a Sunday which is a little down from other weekend times but still very much in demand. We had four people calling for 15 minutes and no success- either phone call not completed or ring and eventually hang up. Then suddenly two people got through. Once we realized we both got through we tried to cancel but that was a hassle again to talk to them so ended up doing a couple of hours later.They only have a few tables. So for our group for four they said we could bring up to eight since it takes the whole booth. We did not but worth noting. A smaller party size may get you at the bar which would be fun I am sure. I saw some people get turned away and some people without a res get seated. Idk if it was regulars or timing of cancellations or what. If you can't get through and in the area it is worth popping in and seeing if you can get in or wait. I will say waiting appears to be waiting in the hot dog restaurant and they come out and call your name, and if not there you are passed over for someone else. However, the entire process once reaching them on the phone was much more chill than I expected. I agree they make the reservation process difficult- I suppose as part of the ""brand."" It is annoying, but I look past it since it was so fun!",5,1,3
15,Pooja M.,"Fremont, CA",528,258,1050,3.0,1/14/2018,"Please Don't Tell is a super trendy and hyped up bar in NYC and for good reason. I mean where else are you going to find a secret bar that you can only enter in through a red British telephone booth that is sitting inside of a hot dog restaurant?It's definitely a cool experience, but beyond going there once just to say that you did, I'm not sure it's worth the hype or hassle to get in. Please Don't Tell is virtually impossible to get into unless you make prior reservations. I've heard that if you show up at really odd times like at 6pm on a Tuesday you may be able to get in without a reservation -- but more than likely if you do show up without a reservation, expect to be quoted a wait time of at least 3 hours.That's what happened to me the first time I tried to get into Please Don't Tell and didn't think to make a prior reservation. When I was able to finally get in the second time around, it was for a friend's birthday celebration and she had made a prior reservation; although, from what she told me it was quite the struggle. Reservations can only be made the day of at exactly 3pm when you have to call their number and wait for ringing on the other end. She and another friend said they were dialing the number non-stop for nearly half an hour only to hear a dial tone on the other end and were about to give up when finally she called and heard ringing on the other end. What a stressful situation -- it reminds of the time I tried to get reservations for the famous French Laundry in Napa, CA and dialed the number at least 50-60 times, but that's a story for another time. So to the envy of many people waiting outside the phone booth in Crif Dogs, our party was able to make that magical walk through to the other side of the phone booth and finally see for ourselves what experience at Please Don't Tell awaits us. As you would expect from a bar that is hiding inside of a hot dog place, Please Don't Tell is tiny -- it can probably fit a max of 20 guests. The actual decor of Please Don't Tell is nothing to write home about; I was expecting gold dripping from the ceilings with how difficult it was to get into this place but hey that's just me. The decor actually consisted of taxidermied animals (?) which I found to be disturbing actually because I like my animals alive and well thank you, but some people are into it so to each their own. I actually found the bathrooms to be more aesthetic than the bar itself LOL because they had cool mirrored tiles everywhere from floor to ceiling. The drinks though were pretty unique and were stellar! I had a couple different drinks but the one that stood out to me was the Shark, which was a light blue milky drink that came with a little umbrella and had buttered liquor in it -- I don't think this is a drink everyone will like, and even I was unsure of it at first because of how unique it tasted but as I nursed it a bit, I began to enjoy it. The drinks at Please Don't Tell are unlike anything you will find anywhere else, but I wouldn't want to go through the nightmare of making a reservation or waiting 3 hours to be able to enjoy them again. I would say everyone should experience Please Don't Tell at least once, but I wouldn't recommend repeat visits.",6,,2
16,Tulshi P.,"Union City, NJ",70,203,215,3.0,2/3/2018,"I felt this place was okay. I was looking forward to coming here and thought it would be cool, but didn't really get the experience I wanted of  getting inside. There were a lot of people waiting to get inside, basically waiting to get inside the phone booth to call. While someone was on the phone, I saw the door to the entrance of bar open, which kinda ruined the experience for me. The door to the bar was kept ajar by the staff for some time, so there was no element of surprise. The cocktails are creative and very strong and service is great too. The place is pretty small and intimate, but it can be a bit stuffy. Overall, it was a good experience but not sure if I would come back here without reservations. Make sure you start calling at 3pm to make reservations, or else you will be waiting for 3 hours without them.",2,,3

Updated review","For years I've called PDT ""the best bar I never go to"". If I'm remembering correctly, the last time I went was sometime in 2013 or 2014, and I had avoided it for so long because1. Reservations are impossible to get.2. Trying to walk in in the middle of a night is a disaster, with quoted wait times being nowhere near an actual wait time--assuming you even get a call back in the first place.3. Waiting to get in 15-30 minutes early is just a slog and not fun whatsoever.Still, I had enjoyed the times I *had* gotten into PDT and had a friend recently say how much he had been dying to go. I agreed on the condition he would do the early waiting to make sure we got in. So we waited and then we got in and we sat at the bar to have our drinks.I'm not sure what happened in the 4-5 years since my last visit. Maybe I changed tastes, maybe options for great cocktails spread across the city like wildfire, or maybe PDT lost some of its magic--maybe all three. I found the cocktail list flat save for a few classics from the original iteration of PDT and, more disappointingly, I found bartender out of their element when I was asking for recommendations.None of the drinks were bad, per se, but they didn't have the same oomph they used to. Part way through the night I seriously considered ordering a simple whiskey soda instead because I was so apprehensive of the sweet-heavy ingredients on the menu and the bartender's fine-but-not-compelling recommendations.On top of that, it seemed both too bright and too air conditioned inside, making what should be a cozy den feel unwelcoming. My friend was blinded the entire night by a spotlight, his head constantly grazed by the taxidermied bear to his side. Next to us were a pair of tourists--nothing inherently wrong there--who were deep into their drinking evening and chatting with a solo at the bar. Again, no issue. But their drunkenness led them to try to interject in me and my friend's conversation several times, even after we had politely rebuffed them because we didn't feel like being someone else's entertainment. The same tourists asked the bartender about every single drink he made, at a harsh volume, and it made PDT feel more like a tourist trap in Times Square than an East Village cocktail bar.I took a look around and saw that the room was mostly full of tourists. It dawned on me then that the place had truly become a tourist trap, and that it was just a trendier version of Madam Tussauds or Hard Rock Cafe, and that much of the original soul and innovation of the place was long gone.PDT played a very important role in NYC cocktail culture and I'll always respect it for advancing beverage programs across the city and elsewhere. But, instead of evolving and becoming something as revolutionary as it once was, it's stagnated into a parody of itself. I'm sure the place still brings in oodles of money and I'm sure plenty of people still have a great time, but the bar past the phone booth in Crif Dog's on St. Marks is no longer ""Please Don't Tell"". But maybe the PDT moniker can still be used, refashioned to stand for something more appropriate of its current state.Maybe ""Prosaic Drinks for Tourists"" could work.P.S. God I wish the place would finally invest in a real reservation system already.",7,3,1
18,Adam G.,"New York, NY",29,430,171,3.0,7/3/2018,"Getting inside is the bad part. We arrived, put our names on the list, waited 90 minutes for the call, when they called we abandoned drinks at another bar to get there in the ten minutes allowed. Then told our table is almost ready, wait in the hot dog shop. Twenty minutes later we're still waiting, finally told them we're giving up and at the last minute they suddenly found our seats were free.Once inside the everything is great. The best old fashioned we've tried. And the other drinks are great. The bartenders were friendly too. And the host apologized for the wait.",,,1
19,Jackie H.,"Chicago, IL",264,67,29,5.0,11/13/2017,"I'm a sucker for this place. Total exclusivity, impossible to get in, and promises it's worth it. Ive tried hammer calling their line at 3 PM when they open for reservations. I've tried walking in before and gave up each time after 3 hours. I thought it was over. And then, this Friday, they picked up the phone. ""Hello this is please don't tell how may I help you?""Boom. Reservation for 6 pm. We arrived to find a line already by the phone booth in Criff Dogs, a bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog haven on St Marks. Someone said ""get in line if you don't have res--"" WE DO. we have one. We will wait right here, in the line of Reservations. At 6:05 pm it was our turn. Into the phone booth we went, dialed 1, and magically a man appeared. Took our names and said ""right this way"".This place is magical. Somewhat small, can accommodate no more than maybe 30. The staff were incredibly classy and calm, which balanced my adrenaline. There are cool taxidermy decorations, dimly lit space, lots of wood, all preserved from the actual speakeasy days. The menu is a book. All cocktails $16, four drinks never change, the rest rotate. The Paddington. Never had anything so wonderful in a beverage. Some drink expert would say something about its depth and orange marmalade aftertaste, but whatever it was so effing good and when I win the lotto I'll have a drinking fountain in my mansion with this drink. The old fashioned- bacon infused four roses. This will be the second drinking fountain. So cool, worth the pain. Go to there, if you can.",3,2,2
20,Jim M.,"Oakland, CA",123,219,120,5.0,5/22/2018,"This has got to be some of the best service that we've ever had in NYC. I have put off going here because it's hard to get a reservation and then usually it's an hours long wait. Then I'm usually too drunk somewhere else to go back when they finally have room for me. I got a reservation for 6 o'clock on a Monday. Don't fool yourself into thinking there won't be anyone here. That bar was completely full by 616 and only 2 people left by the time we left and hour and a half later. The waitstaff couldn't be nicer and the drinks came quickly asOpposed to other speakeasies where they take a half hour for each drink. If it was a little easier to get in ,I might turn into a regular but I'd go at least just to experience the novelty of the venue and the awesomeness of their staff.",3,1,1
21,Rob P.,"San Diego, CA",2035,2394,1070,4.0,5/7/2018,"As I describe it, Please Don't Tell is the place that make speakeasy's famous across the USA. Was it the first? I have no idea, and I'm too lazy to even try to Google it. But it was the first speakeasy I had heard of years and years ago.Last week fellow Yelper Tim K. did his homework and found the process to make a reservation. At 3pm we made 20 calls each and he finally got through and was able to get a 10:30pm reservation for our group. Definitely a fun little thing to go into the phone booth, but the inside bar layout was a less glamorous.We all enjoyed our drinks, which were a bit overpriced at $17. We did have excellent service from our server, and we broke a few of the bar's golden rules over the next hour or so. We were loud, we cursed, but it was all in good fun. We paid our tab and moved down the street to a cheaper bar.Would I do it again? Sure, I would, just to show someone an experience you don't get everyday.

PTD letting me know my seat was ready!  I was solo and had been told around midnight it may be 90+ minutes, but hey, it's a Speakeasy in NYC and there were Crif Dogs to eat!    Stepping in was reminded no hats, and made my way to the bar stool.  I missed that candles were around to read the menu (pretty dark inside) so I blasted my phone light and probably irritated my neighbors... sorry about that!)   More folks flowed in even past 2am, and did hear as I left about 2:30 that they were done seating for the night (3am close on Friday I believe)    Very cool experience watching all the unique drinks being shaken and stirred.  Worth a stop by, probably best to go late!

23,Alik W.,"Minneapolis, MN",46,315,3,3.0,5/10/2018,"Drinks are solid, and the menu contains a fair amount of explanation about how each arose. The entrance ritual, involving a telephone booth, is enjoyable. Atmosphere is true speakeasy, and your date looks pretty good: this light. Food is from Crif Dogs, making it booth inexpensive and very tasty. Excellent drinking snacks, esp the tater tots with plenty of jalapenos and cheese.Ok, so why three stars? Just plain lacking in the service department. Ring the entry phone and nobody might answer four minutes. Bartenders barely talk, because they're rushing to serve drinks. They've no time to chat about ingredients or the overall art of the cocktail. At this price point, that alcohol nerd experience is absolutely part of the bill, and they don't deliver.It's close enough to several other fancy places; try them instead.",2,,
24,Tiff L.,"Toronto, Canada",169,535,1983,5.0,12/17/2017,"This is a super cool speakeasy bar that's hidden within a hot dog joint. You enter a phone booth and pick up the phone, and the door opens into a cozy bar with completely different vibes. There are animals mounted on the walls and I was lucky enough to sit at the bar to converse with the bartender.They can pretty much customize any drink you like, and the selection of whiskey was vast! The bartenders were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. You can also order finger food, like fries, that came out of the kitchen of the hot dog place. They were amazing! When in NYC, this is definitely a bar to hit up!",,,1
25,Amy N.,"Bristol, PA",171,289,46,4.0,5/1/2018,"If you're visiting from out of town and want to grab drinks, here are a few things to know: -PDT starts taking reservation for the same night at 3PM for booth seating.-If you're traveling solo or as a duo and you haven't made reservations, you can potentially still get seating at the bar, but people *will* be starting to line up before they open at 6PM so get there a bit early. You can line up inside Criff's to use the phone booth but don't be a jerk - form a queue along the wall so people can still get by you to buy delicious hot dogs.My friend and I got there on a Thursday at 5:50 PM and we got a seat at the bar after being told there would be a 5 minute wait for some reason. A few other people were told various wait times - and had the right of it. They ordered hot dogs and took a seat in Criff's! The bartenders are super chill, happy to give suggestions, or interact as they wow you with their mixology skills. The drinks are so elaborate & delicious, the music eclectic, the lighting dark. Everything you could ask for in a 'speakeasy' environment. -The Shark or Paddington are awesome if you have a sweet tooth. -You can order from a limited food menu while there, but if you were thinking to get a specific hot dog, eat one while you wait outside!-Bathrooms are in the far back of the house. -Enjoy!",1,,2
26,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,146,0,4.0,4/8/2018,"In my quest to visit every ""speakeasy"" in NYC, I finally made it into PDT (which was at the top of my list). I suggest making a reservation if you have the time/can get in, as you'll have an upwards of 3 hour wait otherwise. They accept reservations starting at 3pm the day of. I called an embarrassing 154 times, but I made it through and snagged one of the last tables! Once we got there, we had to wait about 15 mins for our table to open up. We finally got seated and got right to the drink menu. They have pages and pages filled with fun drink options. If nothing tickles your fancy, they're happy to make you anything you want. I had the Shark and another (I forgot the name of) with chocolate, Guinness, and whiskey. They also have some food options from Crif Dogs, like tator tots and hot dogs. The drinks were amazing.Service is good. Considering how crazy it gets and how pushy people are, the staff is still welcoming and not pushy. The ambiance is excellent. It's hidden inside Crif Dog behind a phone booth. After dialing 1, you're transported into an old wooden room filled with taxidermy and dim lights. It's a small place and everyone must be seated (hence the long wait), but that makes it cozy and not loud by any means.   Overall, I'm so happy I was able to come in to PDT. Though expensive, the drinks are excellent and the experience makes it worth the trip!",2,1,1
27,Vivian K.,"Centreville, VA",491,8,13,2.0,7/30/2018,"NOT WORTH HYPE - Was super excited to get reservations, but post-going, really didn't find it worth the 215 calls my group collectively made for this. GETTING RESERVATIONS - Despite my warnings, still looking to get a reservation? Start calling at 3 PM. If you get a busy tone (which you generally will) hang up and call again, don't wait on the line. You'll know if you're getting through at the first ring because it'll have a more normal sounding ring tone. Don't stay on the busy line! You're wasting time.SERVICE IS CURT - Server was fine, kind, and knowledgeable. However we didn't find the hostess to be very friendly. They also reserve the right to make you leave around an hour or so after the last ordered drink. Feels like you're just being rolled in and out.DRINKS SUBPAR - Maybe we got the wrong ones, but we ordered the one in the coconut as well as cream of the crop, and didn't find them all that tasty.OVERALL - Not really worth it, coolest part about this bar was probably the part before you went into it. If you're looking for a cooler speakeasy check out Bathtub Gin. Service was kind and we loved taking pictures with their fun bronze tub there.",2,1,
28,Sarah K.,"Flushing, NY",135,121,298,5.0,9/3/2017,"On a Saturday night I was able to make a reservation at 9:20pm. I stopped by two times after, and the hostess wrote down the times I've stopped by. I finally get a call from her at 12:53am. We got there and the place is a small chic speakeasy bar. I loved it! Although I found the animal heads a bit creepy as a decor. The drinks were tasty and delicious! Not sweet but refreshing and smooth. All specialty drinks cost $16 each. Expensive but so worth it. And if you're hungry you can order food from the food menu which comes directly from Crif Dogs next door. The bartenders receive food through a small slot from Crif Dogs. So cute! I ordered Saint Rose and Mezcal Mule. Loved both drinks! They give you a lot of tater tots for $6. The Chang Dong wasn't bad but as a Korean it was a strange combo to eat a hot dog with kimchee on it. Overall prepare to enjoy yourself! Loved watching the bartender create the drinks. The restroom is cute too. Sliding door and glass pieces all over the wall.",3,,1

I'd recommend to go around 6 in the weekdays. So you can still discover the entrance yourself. They also have cruf hotdogs served in the bar, and I feel they deliberately designed different hotdogs for PDT(not sure, have to confirm). The cocktails are super special and the presentation is fun too. It's a place that I'll always take my friends too if they're first time visitors.",,,
30,Cynthia J.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,499,47,5.0,2/7/2018,"I don't venture out to bars very often as I would rather spend money on food rather than booze. Some friends in NY wanted to take us to PDT. I didn't even look this place up on Yelp, like I usually do. I just tagged along. My friend made reservations for 4 people. Otherwise, the wait would be an hour and a half plus (that's what I heard the server tell all the patrons)It's hidden inside Crif Dogs. You ring yourself in in the phone booth and are greeted by a staff member. You show your ID and then granted access.The vibe is so cool inside! I totally imagine this place to be a millionaire's secret man cave where he invites all his manly cool friends for drinks to look like. It's kind of dark and not too big. Anyways, I ordered the Pokpok dog (forgot what went in it, but I am a Andy Ricker fan so I got that). I also got their pear drink... argh I forgot the name... I think apeartif?... but our server recommended that when I told her I don't like alcohol flavor) We also shared tots and fries. First off, the drink -- the server knew what she was talking about! It was so good! Like a mild mellow hint of the alcohol with a nice pear taste. Yum! It's very rare that I like a cocktail. The dog was good too. Don't really remember anything special about it. I really loved the tater tots though. I'm not really big on tots (sorry Napoleon Dynamite) but these were so crisp and good! Dipped in the nacho cheese sauce... perfection.I am so glad I was able to try this place out. It definitely makes me wanna try out more places like this.Make reservations (apparently you have to make it the day of when they open at 3pm or something) and ask your server for recommendations! You will have a great experience then.",5,,1
31,Steph H.,"New York, NY",95,43,30,4.0,8/29/2018,"This is a solid 3/4 bar in comparison to all the other speakeasies in the city. It's has a fun entrance through the hot dog place but the drinks aren't really that exciting. They sound great but flavors are repeats of drinks you know and love. They're good, don't get me wrong but they're not mind blowing for someone who would consider themselves a regular at cocktail bars. We came as a party of 3 on a Wednesday early evening and only waited 30/40 min so it's possible!! I've tried to get in for the last three years (meaning I've thought about it for the last three years and only tried three or so times). Shining light was the cheesy tater tots with pickled jalapeños Overall it's everything you expect from a speakeasy - intimate, tasty cocktails, bougie, and fun.

We gave up, but then I randomly called at 5pm and someone picked up on the first ring. I got a reservation at 9:30pm (there was another one available at 10:30pm). We got there at our time and still had to wait around 15-20 min.RESERVATION PROCESS ASIDE...the drinks are GREAT. They are strong, unique, and two was enough for me.

We got seated in about 5 minutes and the hot dogs we were waiting on at Crif's just magically appeared at our seat. The cocktails are fantastic. You can taste the careful thought and the character of the bartender (and how much they like you) that goes into each drink.  We ended up just chatting with the bartender and he just whipped something up which I definitely love getting off the whim vs. something preset on the menu. Honestly, if you can get in and find a seat good on you, I definitely think it is a place that hasn't cheapened their brand as its popularity grewP.S. their ice cubes are so cool ( I was super fascinated with them and how well formed they were)",,,1
36,Tiffany L.,"Chicago, IL",291,532,432,4.0,2/7/2018,"My first experience with Jim Meehan drinks was when Prairie School opened up in Chicago. They make excellent drinks so we were really excited to try PDT. They are night and day, decor-wise. PDT is located in a tiny little spot in Crif Dogs, via a phone booth entrance. The decor is dark and gloomy, with taxidermy on the walls. Prairie School is connected to the Google building, is bright and open, with a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired build. What they do have in common is great drinks.  We tried the Shipshape (gin based) and the Mezcal Mule. They were both very good, very well-balanced, and very strong. The two of us came on a Sunday at 10pm and had no trouble getting in, but it was still packed. Definitely recommended, and if you love PDT, if you're ever in Chicago check out Prairie School.",1,,2
37,Melissa M.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,209,208,4.0,9/16/2017,"Please do tell. As an enjoyer of speakeasies, I wasn't particularly impressed with this nationally known establishment. I assumed because of the hype (I believe I first heard of this one when I lived in Oklahoma) there would be something extra special waiting inside. I was shuffled in only to discover a pretty standard speakeasy atmosphere. Perhaps it's the hype that let me down and perhaps it's the phone booth that brought the hype. All that aside, it's fun to fight for a reservation by calling 67 times till you get through. Quality, but expensive drinks. Thoughtful service. I might not be back because of the expense and effort but I did enjoy the experience.",,,
38,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,5.0,3/15/2018,"This is just one of those places in New York City that you must experience for yourself. No amount of characters and fancy words can possibly describe what this place is and can mean to you. Sure, experiences are subjective and I'm fully aware it won't be for everyone but the casual ambience and the mystique, alone, will certainly prove it's worth your time and curiosity. Personally, I found it to live up to its hype. Super exclusive. Super intimate. Super cool. A break from a snowy New York City night turned into a heart-to-heart with a friend over some drinks and waffle fries. We happened to luck out on a Wednesday night after making a reservation in person. We went to a neighboring bar anticipating our access through its phone booth, within Crif Dogs. The cocktails are $16 (the beer $7) but it's probably one of the best bars I've been in as a 5-year New Yorker.",,,
39,Lia M.,"Washington, DC",855,1925,2376,5.0,5/25/2017,"I never get to NYC, but I do have a long list of bookmarks for when I am in town. Please Don't Tell has been on this list forever, and I was beyond excited to be able to try it. And since Dev just went here in ""Master of None"", I remembered I had to write this review. I arrived at 4:35 on a Friday afternoon, and of course, people were already chillin' in Crif Dogs, waiting for PDT to open. Shout out to the cashier there though--she super sweet and super ready for this sort of thing. I was only a few back in line, and by myself, so I was in by 5:10 or so. I didn't think I would be excited over the whole dialing-a-rotary-phone-and-entering-through-a-secret-door thing, but I actually kind of was, though it's a bit trite.My bartender was Luis, and he makes great drinks. I tried two: the Peeking Duck and the Rapscallion. The Peeking Duck, a vodka-based cocktail with ginger and soy sauce, among other things, was bit too citrusy (thanks to lemon and orange juice) and lighter than I expected. I would have liked a bit more soy sauce, I think. It was good, though I wouldn't order it again. Granted, I was in desperate need of a drink and a bit overwhelmed by the menu, so I may not have chosen wisely. After that, Luis and I had a conversation about how I love smoky flavors, and he recommend the Rapscallion, which I don't believe is currently on the menu. I was blown away. Talk about smoky. This had to be the best cocktail I've ever had, and I don't even know what's in it, nor do I care. It was smoky and strong. Game over. I convinced the party next to me to order it, and they loved it as well. If you like smoke, order the Rapscallion. I don't think I could return to PDT and not order it. I wish I had been hungry enough to eat, but between crossing off other bucket list places, and downing a beer at Crif Dogs, I was not.I'm searching for cocktail that will beat PDT's Rapscallion, but I don't think I'll find it, and I almost hope I don't.

41,Mathias S.,"Hermitage, Nashville, TN",0,2,1,5.0,1/16/2018,I made a reservation here because that is the policy. When I showed up early the host politely said we'd have to wait about 10 min before our reservation was ready. In about 8 min we were sat. Professional and courteous. Bartender Jeff was very helpful selecting our drinks. He was also really dreamy. He had these beautiful blue eyes that when you looked into them it was like angels singing to you. I'd give six stars if I could. My only complaint was the couple next to us complaining about being sat at the bar because they were late to their reservation. They were rude to the staff and really loud. They complained about not having blackberry vodka. Must have been from Wisconsin. I'm not going to dock this establishment any stars because other people suck. I did snap a photo of the troublesome couple.,1,1,

When I was finally lucky enough to get inside, the drinks were great as expected.

Dial PDT from the phone booth and find out if the speakeasy on the other side of the phone booth has space for you. Then get on the waiting list and wait...a long time for a seat...like hours. It took a few hours for space to open up for us to get in. Once in we had drinks and Crif's hotdogs. This was mostly an average drink and food experience with the fun part being getting in through the phone booth and feeling like you're doing some illicit. The drinks were good. The hotdogs average. One of the hotdog's featured Pok Pok wing sauce from Pok Pok in Portland, Oregon! So we had an unexpected bit of Portland in New York City! Service was just ok.",1,,

When my friends and I (3 total) finished dinner, we stopped by PDT, whose entrance is in a gourmet hot dog shop. We got there around 8:30 and we waited for about 20 min, hoping to score three seats. This place gets filled up quickly, with only a few booths that seat 8 people total, bar seating, and a few intimate tables for 2.The entrance is in the telephone booth - you dial 1 to ring the bell and you can put your name down for a table.We made small talk with 4 older ladies who had gotten a reservation and they invited us to sit with them at their booth! SCORE!!! That was super sweet of them to let us join their reservation. Total wait time was about 45 min with that reservation.The place is VERY DARK and the decor was a bit interesting - taxidermy heads all over the place. But the drinks were great! They've got something for everybody - all different types of mixed drinks and all very well done! Drinks were a bit pricey at $15, but hey- it's NYC.

We came to NYC during a holiday weekend so we definitely lucked out getting into this place without a reservation. We had no idea what to expect, but that was half the fun! It was super cool finding the phone booth and getting escorted into the bar in the back. Who knew such a swanky place could be located inside a hot dog shop? My cocktail was mixed to perfection (I mean, you don't just get the notoriety they have if you pour crappy drinks!) and the service was impeccable. There isn't a ton of seating, but there's enough that you could go with a group of friends and feel comfy, or go with a date and feel intimate. The only thing we wished was that we would've ordered some food. We came directly after dinner so we were stuffed, but those dogs look de-lish! Please Don't Tell is a must-stop when in the city.

47,Richard F.,"Bakersfield, CA",490,252,286,4.0,1/2/2018,"Pretty cool speakeasy but it can be a major pain trying to get into this place. You can call the day of to get a reservation, which I highly recommend because you can end up waiting all night to get in. The great thing is that the place is nearby a bunch of other bars, so you have plenty of options to kill time before they give you a call.The entrance is in a hot dog/pizza place that is pretty family friendly. Probably not the best place to be located because the place got really packed when people started lining up to put their name on the list, while a bunch of kids were celebrating a birthday party. The speakeasy process is pretty easy, as you just pick up the phone, and the lady who arranges seating comes out and helps you out.The cocktails here are definitely worth trying if you're able to get in. Ordered the old fashioned and it was fantastic. Strong and tasty, without being overly sweet. Prices can be pretty steep at $16 per drink, but rest assured, these bartenders know what they're doing.Overall, drinks were fantastic, but I highly recommend that you set up a reservation to avoid the nightmare of getting in.",,,1
48,Christine W.,"San Francisco, CA",484,166,169,5.0,1/14/2018,"Although the outside of this world renowned speakeasy is oftentimes crowded and full of incredibly inebriated people, the inside is delightful, intimate, and home to some of the best drinks I've ever had. We made a reservation for midnight on a Saturday and when we showed up we waited a few minutes for people to clear out a little. The outside of the entrance was absolutely packed with people who had a bit too much to drink and were being quite rude to employees. (Hint: if you want a reassurance that you'll get in, make a reservation at 3pm the day of!)  Once we were in, we were sat at the bar as a group of 3. Our bartender was amazing at making our drinks and she was quick and evidently skilled. She dealt with drunk guests in a very polite yet upfront way and was incredibly helpful with suggestions for drinks that would fit our specific taste palettes. Our drinks were so so flavorful and efficiently made. My favorite was the Paddington, a fruity citrus drink named after their stuffed bear on the wall. Each cocktail is $16. Overall, I had a great experience once inside the bar. If you're in town, I'd make a reservation and check out what all the buzz is about. It's worth it.",,,

PDT has one heck of a reputation and we were ready to have our socks knocked off. But, that didn't happen. I think our cocktails were better at a place a couple blocks away we went since our wait was over two hours. The service was not what it should be for a place as well known as this. Aside from taking our order, the bartender didn't pay much attention to us which is unfortunate as we enjoy engaging in mixology talk. Oh well, we came, we saw, we tasted an average drink, and we'll likely not return. I'd give it 3 stars but because of the extra high expectations that fell so short, I've got to knock it to two. :(",4,,1
50,Rebecca Y.,"Manhattan, NY",92,108,86,4.0,1/3/2018,"Probably one of the most hyped up cocktail bars in Manhattan, and for good reason. This lil speakeasy bar is located inside a seemingly random hot dog shop (whose hot dogs are pretty good I hear), with entrance through a nondescript phone booth. You can and should make reservations in advance if you're like me and don't like to wait (or you can wait, like I did). Walk ins are seated at the bar (which has about 8-10 seats or so) so you can imagine how long the wait can be if you don't get there early. Since I was visiting for the weekend and my friend and I were determined to get in (as walk-ins), we actually came a whopping 45 min before opening time and were first in line, no shame. As for drinks, we ended up getting the Peeking Duck (which has soy sauce in it. That's new) and the King's Cup. I actually liked the King's Cup better, which had some floral undertones which I very much like. And lastly, for some tips: 1. A lot of reviews here are saying to come 15 min in advance if you don't want to wait. I would come about 20 min in advance if you want to beat the crowds of people who come 15 min in advance ;) But 45 min is totally unnecessary.2. If you're craving hot dogs, get them before entering the bar. They're actually more expensive in the bar. 3. The bathroom at PDT redefines the mirror selfie. Check it out.",,,

Rick and Adam the bartenders make amazing drinks. They will be happy to explain to you minor differences between drinks and even custom craft you anything you'd like. Currently the snake is really cool blue and pretty amazing but ill bite you if you done pay attention to how many you've had.

Once you're inside and seated, it's always a good time. Order yourself a killer cocktail (off the menu or ask the bartender for something bespoke), and definitely get yourself one of the specialty dogs (the 2Pok perhaps?) and some tater tots to share.

54,Lynnette V.,"New York, NY",2,31,21,4.0,1/22/2018,"Cute entrance, drinks were good but pricey, 30Min wait on a Sunday at 12am so we went across the street to another bar to wait it out. Hot dogs inside the location were good. Probably wouldn't go back. I liked angels speakeasy much better and it was only about a 10 min walk away. Try the mezcal mule.",,,
55,Samuel P.,"New York, NY",104,106,0,4.0,10/9/2017,"Finally made it to this hugely popular, no-longer-secret speakeasy. Tip: go 15 minutes before opening (i.e. 5.45pm) and stand in line. Ambience: decently quiet with no need to shout over the top of your voice. Moderately cosy and dark but not the extent you get with Nitecap. Drinks: extensive, reasonably priced (all cocktails are $16). Recommend the Shark drink (it has butter!!). But apparently their menu changes occasionally, so just and order and take a chance with whatever drink catches your eye - that's part of the fun! They serve food too. Try the funky variations of Crif Dogs -  like the Chang kimchi dog.",2,,
56,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,5.0,8/28/2017,"Been living in NYC for how many years and I finally managed to go to Please Don't Tell? Yeah, let's not talk about that. In my defense, I've had a number of friends from out of town who have tried and failed. So that wasn't much incentive for me.But amazingly on a random weeknight I got in and with a fairly minimal wait. Going through the phone booth bit is fun and I do love the ambiance and decor of the bar. The drinks are excellent. We sat at the bar so we got to watch them being made by the super friendly awesome bartender. She was great at giving suggestions and recommendations.  Also had to have an order of tater tots that came with a side of cheese and jalapenos and totally hit the spot. Yum!It's a great date place if you can get in. I wouldn't recommend it for larger groups since the place is pretty small, but there were several groups that certainly tried.",5,1,3
57,Sydney T.,"New York, NY",90,73,16,4.0,9/7/2017,"I've been wanting to go to this bar for a while. I've known about it for years but there's always some kind of a wait which I was always to impatient to wait for. I had some family visiting from overseas and wanted to show them a unique bar experience which they wouldn't be able to get outside of the states (did any other country go thru prohibition?).When I went to make the reservation from the phone, the host answered the door and told me there would be an hour and half wait for my group. So we went to another bar to kill some time before we finally came back. Once they were ready to seat us, we were able to go through the phone booth which made me feel like a wizard. We sat at the bar where we had a nice view of the bartenders making the drinks.Having been a bartender and a fan of high end cocktails, I had high expectations for this place (especially since it took me years before finally going in). I was slightly disappointed in the drinks that were made. They were all good in the sense that the drinks had a lot of character and it will not be like many or any drinks you've had in the past, but they weren't very balanced. Something was always off or one thing was missing or too present. One example is the old fashioned I had that was made with bacon infused bourbon but it was strange as you would smell the aroma of the orange, taste the slightly sweetened bourbon (which was nice), and then get a bacon aroma/aftertaste (strange). The drink made me crave a bloody mary more than what I was drinking.Besides my disappointment of the drinks, everything else was great. Ambience was great and some place I would consider taking a date. It wasn't too loud so it was easy to talk to each other which is a big thing for me. Bartender was very amicable and easy to talk to. Also gave some good recommendations and knew how to gauge what a customer might be interested in. Overall this place is a good place that you can take a date, have some decent cocktails, and enjoy a conversation in a nice cozy environment which feel like an adventure getting into. Just don't expect mind blowing drinks.P.S. One of the reasons my drink standards were so high may be because I went to one of the world's best bar in Athens a few days prior.",4,,
58,Lateefah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,138,171,5.0,4/23/2017,"I had no idea that Please Don't Tell was here and I'm not a big drinker but this was an experience. You have to make a reservation and I suggest calling at exactly 3:00 pm on the night you want to go, especially if it is a weekend. Someone in our party call about 100x just to get through and make the reservation. We arrived on time and only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. The individual working the door knows what they are doing and is very skilled at answering the door, seating people, adding people to the waitlist and answering the phone. Our server was really well informed about the menu and mixology in general. Although not a bartender herself (we asked), she was able to make recommendations on what types of drinks we would like and assisted customizing them to our taste. All the drinks were so good. This place has a waiting list for a reason. At $15 a drink, they are actually well worth it and I would say above NYC standard. You can also order food from the restaurant as you drink. The hamburger and waffle fries hit the spot.",1,,

You're probably wondering how we got in.... welp, we got in line (first in line) about 35 minutes before PDT opened. So yes, that meant standing in a hot dog shop until it was time to go in the phone booth and gain access to this hidden gem. We were seated at the bar. The bartender gave us menus and let us ponder. Interesting and different selection in cocktails. I had the mescal mule. It had a smoky, fresh, refreshing taste. I had never had anything like it before. We sat around for one drink and watched all the cool cocktails that were being made. It was relaxing and fun. The vibe was chill and calm. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and there was the option to eat hotdogs and tater tots if you desired. Overall I enjoyed my drink and would recommend coming if you've never been.",2,1,3

61,Jay K.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,333,590,4.0,1/7/2017,"It's a solid four and a half. My friend said it was a five, but I don't think I was completely blown away, still greatly enjoyed my experience! So a bit of a back story, I studied this bar in college for a marketing class and was super interested in visiting! For those looking for a very extensive explanation of how this place works, here ya go. Most of you know to call ""a number"" which you can easily find on Google. Continue to call it, we honestly only called about... 10-15 times between the two of us, it might sound ridiculous but it was only about 3-4 minutes. All you have to do is listen for the busy tone and then hang up and retry. We ended up getting a reservation right when they opened at 6 pm. Perfect! We gave the hostess our name and number and she informed us on what to do. If the line is long outside the hot dog joint you need to CUT in front. Don't be hesitant, most of the people in the line are attempting to get into the bar without a reservation. The bar will only hold your place for 15 minutes, so you can be nice for a little bit, but if you get within ten minutes of being late it's time to cut and let people know you have an actual reservation. The only sad thing was I didn't get to ring the phone! The hostess actually opened the door for us. Once we showed id and told her who we were she led us to our small table. There's about two small tables, three booths and then the rest is a bar. It's small, but honestly quaint. There's music, animal heads on the wall and it's dark. The atmosphere isn't super loud and we quite liked that. My friend ordered a cocktail from the front page, I asked for a mocktail and was given a lovely surprise and then we got the waffle fries with cheese dip and jalapeño. The cocktail was supposedly amazing, he loved it. My mocktail was nice! Ginger, lemon, passion fruit and pineapple. It was wonderful! I was so surprised because I love passion fruit and pineapple, and to have the two together was great. The waffle fries were decent. Nothing special, but the cheese was that goooood melty cheese you want. I liked it. Our server was nice, nothing overly friendly but attentive enough to refill water and to check us out pretty quickly. Once you're done you exit through the entrance, they'll let you out. It was a really nice experience and I'm happy to have experienced it. The exclusivity is why people love this place. It's not cheap, but I suppose most alcoholic drinks aren't? $15 for a drink, my mocktail was only 5 bucks though! And the waffle fries were 6. I don't think we'd come back, but I'm happy to be able to check this off my list. It was fun.",18,10,12
62,Mary K.,"Louisville, KY",2,30,3,5.0,8/26/2018,"The drinks are incredible, and the bartenders are very knowledgeable. If you swing by around 6/6:15 you can usually get seats at a reasonable time. I recommend the Shark and the drink with egg white and lemon (the name escapes me)!",,,
63,Cristal P.,"Plainview, NY",24,18,0,5.0,8/25/2018,"Amazing speakeasy, the wait was super long but worth it. My friend and I had the Mescal mule. Very strong and unique cocktails. Tater tots were amazing and not too greasy as in other bars. Pickled jalenpenos that came with the tater tots were a nice touch. Service was also great. Drinks came relatively quickly.",,,
64,Lillian T.,"San Francisco, CA",322,217,1088,4.0,1/8/2017,"Location: A solid gem located behind a vintage phone booth inside Crif Dogs. Once you enter the phone booth you have to dial 1 to ring the door bell, and the host will open the door.Reservation: The bar is really tiny and only has about 2-3 tables and a few seats at the bar. For this reason, I would recommend making a reservation rather than waiting for a spot to open up, which can take over 3 hours. To make a reservation, you have to call in the day of starting at 3pm. Since it is quite popular, you will likely have to dial multiple times until you bypass the busy tone. I think I must have dialed about 20 times (took ~5 minutes) before I was able to reach the host and reserve a booth for 4. I believe they do NOT take reservations on Friday and weekend nights.Atmosphere: Dark and intimate, the tables are separated from each other so you can have a private conversation within your group. There is not much to see inside the bar, and there is not really a fancy setup or cool furniture. The main appeal is really the drinks and the phone booth entrance concept.Food/Drink: What I love about this bar is they have a wide variety of ""wild"" drinks to choose from. Whether it's a raw egg, soy sauce, or chocolate in your drink; you will be pleasantly surprised by how well they can incorporate weird ingredients into their cocktails. PDT also serves hot dogs from the Crif Dogs kitchen except the selection inside the bar is different from what is offered outside in the restaurant. I had two helpings of their 2POK dog which tastes like a banh mi sandwich except the meat is a dog rather than your typical cha lua/grilled or roasted pork.",7,,1
65,Amy F.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",116,107,102,5.0,1/25/2018,During my first trip to NY a coworker recommended Please Don't Tell and after I checked out Yelp reviews I was excited to check it out. Came with a friend on a Friday around 6. We put our name in and had a drink across the street until they called us. We each had a cocktail that were great and loved the speak-easy vibe!,2,1,2
66,Tanya E.,"Norfolk, VA",6,30,6,4.0,10/2/2017,"My suggestion is that, if you plan to go to PDT, call when the phones turn on and make a reservation! Especially for their busier weekend nights. I began calling at 3PM sharp on Saturday afternoon to make a reservation for a group of 4 of us, it took me about 15-20 minutes to get someone on the line and the earliest reservation was for midnight (the establishment opens at 6PM). That is how quickly the reservations fill up. So do yourself a favor and call them before just showing up on the weekend, I saw a lot of people without reservations trying to get a table while we were waiting for ours and they were told there was approximately a 3 hour wait. Going forward - we made the reservation for 4 people for 12AM. We arrived at 12:05PM and rang the phone in the booth in order to talk with the hostess. Shortly after, she comes out and calls our name and seats us, and the 2 extra guests that joined us last minute - which I think was very kind of her! Shortly after being sat in a rather large booth we get a call and 2 other friends ask to join us. The hostess ok's it and brings up two stools for us to place at the end of our booth. I didn't catch her name, but thank you kind hostess for accommodating all of us! The bar itself is dimly lit, quaint and decorated with random taxidermied animals. The atmosphere was calm and intimate. Our waiter was super friendly and informative. He gave all of us drink suggestions based on our individual tastes. The drinks themselves were good, but not anything to rave about. All in all, we had good time and the staff was very friendly!",,,1

After three times trying to get in here (and giving up after 1hr + waits) we decided to go in early On a day during the week (6:30 on a Thursday) and finally got in after just a few minutes wait. I like the idea of a ""secret"" or exclusive spot as much as the next gal, but I think this one is overhyped. The hostess and bartenders were friendly, but our drinks were ...meh. I asked for the bartender to make me something (best practice at speakeasys...trust me, I'm a pro) and he agreed...but made me something from the menu (which I almost ordered initially but decided against). Sir...that's not how this (usually) works... any who, we'll charge this experience to the game.../to us maybe getting the ""weekday"" bartenders and not the top notch cocktail crafters we expected...

Even on a Monday night, they were all booked up on reservations so we popped in as a walk in and got on their waiting list. We actually stopped by another bar to wait and got the call a lot earlier than expected because other people on the list didn't return their calls. The space itself is nothing special, your typical small underground speakeasy style but we sat at the bar so we had a good view of the wall of drinks. I went with the tiki drink with matcha, which was delicious and not at all what I was expecting from PDT. We also shared a crif dog, which was one the special hot dogs that they only served in PDT and not in their regular store just outside. It was absolutely delicious and surprisingly went so well with our drinks!",2,,1

We left our name on the cancellation list but never received a call.Called the next day at 3pm until we were able to get through and got reservations for our group of 4 at 11:30pm. We arrived and had a lovely spacious booth.  The place is a little bit  louder than your regular speak easy but not bad at all. Just a general observation I made while we were there. All of our drinks were strong and well balanced and the fancy hot dogs and tater tots were delicious. The food quality was a nice surprise. I wish I remembered the exact drinks we had but their menu is so large, it's hard for me to remember.

Been wanting to go here for years and finally got a reservation at 10pm.Great looking bar once inside. Didn't see the animals on the wall coming either. I ordered the Benton's Old Fashioned which has bacon infused Four Roses bourbon, grade B maple syrup, and angostura bitters. This drink was just the right amount of sweetness and perfectly balanced. Great tasting cocktail. We also had to order some hot dogs that aren't included on the normal criff dogs menu. We ordered two of the 2pok dogs which was with pok pok sauce, crispy garlic, roasted chile mayo, pickled carrots ands daikon, lettuce, cucumber and cilantro. It was bomb tasty with flavors. We also ordered the tots with a side of cheese that no one could complain about.The hype was definitely worth it and I'm glad I finally got to visit PDT.

72,Brigitte S.,"Honolulu, HI",653,391,6244,5.0,12/16/2016,"Years ago when hidden bars and speakeasy's' first became big on the scene, I fell in love with PDT and needed to go. Every time I was back home in NY, my schedule didn't allow me to make a reservation & my heart sank as my dream fluttered. This September I was back in NY for a wedding and knew I needed to fulfill my dream, even if the craze is long gone.I called the day of and couldn't get a reservation but was told to come down and try to get on the waitlist. We made our way to Crif Dogs where we entered and found the phone booth to glorious cocktails. You dial 1 on the red phone and wait for the wall to open up. I swear I was high. The lady said that she could fit us in at the bar within the hour if that worked so we gave our number and she said she'd contact us ASAP. From there we would have 15 minutes to make it in or our seats would be given away. My stepbrother happened to know of another speakeasy like bar a few blocks away so we checked that out while we waited and as promised, 45 minutes later we got the call and ran back. Back into the phone booth & through the wall to wonderland we went. PDT is super small, dark & pure perfection. It's both intimate and busy all at once and the bartender was beyond spectacular making his way back and forth at the bar. We ordered a few cocktails from the menu [super on point but pricey], some waffle cheese fries with jalapeno and a Chang dog. The food is passed from Crif Dogs through this tiny door/compartment at the bar. It's kind of magical as you're getting drunk at the bar. The waffle fries were glorious, crispy and the cheese was obviously homemade nacho cheese. YUM! The Chang Dog is a bacon wrapped deep fried Crif Dog with Momofuko kimchi. Simple, gluttonous, perfection. Who doesn't love a good hot dog? Perfect bar food! Follow the etiquette rules, don't be that guy. Respect the old school style that comes with the fantastic drinks and just enjoy yourself. This place is a gem, I can't wait to come back! Definitely try to get in if you can... & if you can't at least go get a hot dog at Crif :)!",4,1,5

It's still a fun spot to bring someone who has never been, as it has a novelty aspect to it but in my opinion the cocktails and service aren't what they used to be.

The ambiance is also interesting but pretty typical of a speakeasy. The waiters were nice but it was obvious they had some people they knew at the bar so they kept on chatting with them and not really paying attention to other customers.

77,Lauren V.,"London, United Kingdom",288,674,138,3.0,6/1/2017,"I was inspired to finally write up my PDT experience after watching S2 of Master of None, when he takes a date there (to impress her with his classy and sophisticated taste of course).Please Don't Tell made it onto my massive foodie/posh cocktails list for my brief visit to NYC, and after a loooong day of walking around in the oppressive rain in Nov, getting lost and generally getting fed up with the city and its expensive prices, poor service and general antics we decided to show up to a massively popular, cool baby speakeasy without a reservation at 6:30p on a Thursday. Sounds like a disaster right?We were soaked and unkempt, but I picked up the pay phone receiver and politely explained I didn't have a reservation but was there any chance there was a small table available for two? The host opened the secret door and whispered that someone hadn't arrived for their call back and that he'd give them five more minutes then we were in. He delivered on his promise and we amazingly had seats! The interaction was so unexpectedly helpful and kind, when I expected to be scrutinized up and down and then smugly turned away, PDT earned a permanent place in my heart.We ordered a round (pretty expensive, $16-18 per drink) and eventually got a couple loaded chilli dogs and tater tots from next door (more reasonably priced and tasted excellent). We had a couple more rounds but feeling like we were breaking the bank, we moved on.I was impressed with the initial service and atmosphere and food; not so impressed with the drink prices or the cocktails themselves. Bartender was not super helpful by way of directing us to drinks we might like based on our tastes, a bit of a red flag for me in a spot that flouts its mixology expertise and charges such a high price for an experimental drink you may not like. But it was overall a really cool experience - def pop in and check it out.",4,2,2

It had well balanced flavor  despite my not being able to detect much of the bacon flavor in the bacon infused bourbon. I did like that it came with a nice big clear rock in it. The other cocktails around me looked tasty as well.I would definitely recommend getting reservations. I was going to meet a friend here, but when I was told there was a 5 minute wait for one person at the bar vs. a 2 1/2 hour wait for two people at the bar, the decision was easy for me to pop in for a drink and meet my friend somewhere else after. While I would enjoy coming here again, I would not say it's worth a wait like that. Just more reason to make a reservation.",13,7,13
79,Emily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,79,0,3.0,1/23/2018,"I thought this bar was just okay. I absolutely love clever/creative cocktails, so I thought I'd like it more than I actually did. The experience of actually getting inside is cheesy, but it's also kind of fun. I called immediately when the phone line opened, and I ended up having to dial the number 14 times before I finally got through. When I arrived at the bar that night, we had to wait for maybe 15 minutes before getting seated, which was fine, and the host was super polite. We ended up at the bar, and I didn't really find the ambience to be anything special. It was pretty forgettable, actually, except for a couple of cool taxidermied animals.The menu has a lot of options and some pretty unique combinations of ingredients, so I liked that. I had three drinks in total. Every single one of them was tasty, and they definitely had a little bit of flair compared to your average cocktail bar. Of the three, the Black Flip (rum, stout, and egg) was my favorite, and while I'd of course drink it again, it still didn't manage to really stick with me. The Sub Rosa was the most interesting, with tequila, Campari, and coffee.So I didn't get the vibe here that it was necessarily a place that you go to get drunk, especially since, if that's your primary goal, there are many, many places in the East Village where you can buy shots for like, $3. However, that being said, I was sober after my three drinks. On one hand, weak drinks are great for being able to try a lot of different cocktails! On the other hand, these drinks are super pricy, so I don't necessarily want to be feeling 100% sober after having three of them.Overall, there are way more bars in NYC that I'd go to for cocktails before ever going back to Please Don't Tell! I feel like I can get better quality drinks at a bar that doesn't require a whole process for making a reservation.",1,,

After 1 hour, I went to ask again. The host said that we need to wait longer. Fine. We wait. And after that, I went to ask the host every hour. I even double checked my phone number with her. And I told her that we would wait outside until her call. Then, I went to ask her at about 1AM, she told me that there were just two tables before us. So, we were so patient to wait until 1:40 AM. This time, when I knocked the door, nobody answered. About 5 mins after, a waitress came to tell us that they usually stop to accept new customers at 1:00 AM. Nobody would answer the door. Is that incredible?! About 4 hours waiting! The host knew that we were outside. And, she didn't remind us even I asked her at about 1 AM.I saw her in the end, inside the kitchen.

We told the receptionist our cell number and headed to the bar a few doors down while we waited for our secret text message which notified us when we were finally allowed to enter. We came on a weeknight and waited approximately 15-20 minutes to get in. The place was not crowded at all. We had just come for after dinner drinks. They were strong and creative, with a proper nod to the era they were replicating. Priced appropriately for Manhattan, perhaps a tad too much for St. Mark's however. We loved the exclusivity of it all. It was completely well hidden and definitely gave you the feeling you were doing something illegal. They did this so very right here.  This was a really fun experience, especially on a date night! I recommend you try a speakeasy if you haven't. It's a real hoot! Someone definitely didn't listen and did indeed 'tell' so it's a tad more popular than when we went, but still worth a visit, even if just for drinks.",6,4,6
86,Ben Z.,"San Francisco, CA",152,148,228,5.0,1/2/2018,"This is an awesome speakeasy bar and its hidden literally inside a hot dog place.  WE WERE AMAZED the second we picked up the phone on the phone booth and literally a door opens up and a guy greets you from within.  NEVER HAVE WE EVER EXPERIENCED something like that before!We literally put our name down at about 8pm and we didn't get our text until 11pm and they close a little after midnight.  Ordered some drinks and it was BOMB ass drinks, it was originally only 3 of us but since they were almost closing we told a few of our other friends to join us in this amazing bar.  I really wish they had more of these kinds of bars in our city and I believe you have to call in for reservations prior to coming.",1,,
87,Emma T.,"New Orleans, LA",370,161,251,5.0,4/14/2017,"Loved PDT! It isn't exactly secret anymore since it's gotten so popular but you still feel so cool going into that phone booth and it's tough to get in. I've tried to go before by calling and making a reservation and dialed 100 times with no success. Made it in by going on a Monday night around 9:30pm and putting my name on the list. The hostess said she'd have a table within an hour and would call. She didn't end up calling but we went back at 10:30 and she fit us in by 10:45.The hostess at this place deserves major credit for how many people are trying to go here. You go into the phone booth and ring once, and you wait for the hostess to come out. She peeks out and let's you know about availability. She will also come out and call your name off the list. Does a really good job balancing accommodating reservations while keeping the ""secretive"" nature of the place. Drinks were $15 but it's New York so I've begun to accept that reality. Drinks were both really good and different - a unique and seasonal drink menu. Highly recommend for the experience!",4,2,2
88,Melissa L.,"Silver Spring, MD",6,82,13,5.0,6/14/2018,"This place is different and I love everything about it. Famously known for its ""secret"" entrance. The phone booth inside the divey-looking CriffDog. The wait is usually a long one. I tend to come here with one other person if not just myself to enjoy it. The beverages are always delicious, they never fail me. The food, now this is a great idea. They serve CriffDogs food. Tater tots, hotdogs with different toppings. You would think a speakeasy would have a different menu from the greasey food next door. But heck no! This is a brilliant idea. I love the food and it comes through a little door in the wall of the bar. I love watching the bartenders make their drinks. They make upwards to 600 cocktail a night, has to be. The place itself is small but the volume they go through is crazy. There are people who get one drink and go to say they have been. This place has a great book as well. I have been here a few times and plan to keep coming back when I go on my speakeasy tours again!",,,
89,Stacey H.,"Rowlett, TX",54,87,25,4.0,1/14/2018,Really cool bar hidden beyond a phone booth within a hot dog restaurant.  I had a Mezcal Mule and it was really good.  It had a very smoky flavor and was different than your standard Moscow Mule.  The space is very small and the line to get in gets long so get there when it opens at 6 if you want to get in.,,,

There were customers blocking the entrance so we couldn't enter ( we had reservations and they didn't) and she came out to get us, and made sure we were taken care of.Once inside it was cozy and very inviting. Both of my friends ordered the shipshape and it was delicious and I ordered a local chocolate stout as I always love to try local brews and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were very attentive. It was a fantastic experience! Make sure to book by 3pm if you want to for sure have a seat!",,,
91,Joy W.,"San Jose, CA",215,495,3697,4.0,7/18/2016,"Mr. Joy called promptly at 3pm on a Monday. After 10 straight minutes of dialing and re-dialing, he got through the line and they granted us a 7:30pm reservation. We were about 10 minutes early when we rang the payphone. Around 7:35pm, we were led through the magical telephone booth and took our seats at the bar. Success! PDT is on the small side, but not surprisingly so judging by the size of Crif Dogs. Most of the space consists of a narrow bar. There are a couple of booth tables for slightly larger parties too. As for decor, the animals on the walls add an interesting vibe but I'm not a fan of the creepy taxidermy theme.Service was great straight from the beginning. The host led us to our seats and once we were firmly planted on our stools, he pushed our stools closer to the bar. I hung my bag on the hook under the bar and watched the bartenders skillfully create cocktail after cocktail.Cocktails are $15 each, pretty standard for most speakeasies.Mr. Joy ordered the Kiku, a sake drink that they mixed up in a sake glass. I got a fruity cocktail with some pear slices that they carefully and meticulously garnished atop of the glass. The chilled beverages were so satisfying and refreshing.Hot Dogs are about $7, very pricey.Hot dogs may seem a little strange to serve at a speakeasy, but they're kind of the quintessential bar food and being positioned in Crif Dogs, it only seems natural to serve hot dogs here. The 2Pok Dog - deep-fried with Pok Pok wing glaze, crispy garlic, roasted chile mayo, pickled daikon & carrot, lettuce, cucumber, cilantro, a banh mi take on hot dogs was not bad! There was a good snap to the deep-fried dog and the crunchy daikon, carrots, and cucumbers balanced out the heaviness. I just wish there was a little more Pok Pok glaze. Also, it was topped with a lot of cilantro, too much cilantro. Waffle Fries are about $6, also very pricey.These are the best waffle fries I have ever had (not that I've had many). The fried cross-hatched potatoes, served in an aluminum foil bowl, were cut pretty thick and very crunchy, not soggy at all. I dipped a fry into the pool of cheese, then lightly dipped it into the plastic container of chopped, pickled jalapenos. I'm not a huge fry lover, but crunchy potato, gooey cheese, and the tart, spicy jalapenos is a good combination.Even though there is not a lot of elbow room at PDT, it is definitely a relaxing place to enjoy a few cocktails. As popular as they are, I commend them on keeping crowd control a priority. If they didn't, their limited amount of space would be tough to enjoy. Now that I've tried it, I most likely won't be motivated to attempt a future reservation except maybe to share the experience with a first-timer.",5,2,2
92,Connie C.,"Bethesda, MD",729,59,115,4.0,6/23/2017,Coming on the weekend would be difficult to get spot and you may have to wait for a few hours. You can call in to get your name added to the list which is definitely something you would want to do if you have a party more than 2. I actually decided to come here by myself while my friend was in the process of getting a tattoo. I only waited for about 20 minutes before I was seated at the bar. The cocktails were amazing and very nicely decorated. I was a bit disappointed that the phone in the phone booth wasnt working which I felt did ruin part of the experience of the secret bar behind the door of a phone booth. I hope to come back again sometime soon and I hope they get that fixed by the time I return again.,,,
93,Kathryn T.,"Manhattan, NY",352,411,2622,4.0,7/20/2016,"PDT is the most renowned speakeasy in Manhattan. So the question is: is it worth the hype? Kinda. Here's the breakdown:1.  It's a wait. That's a fact. Be comfortable with exploring east village while you wait for someone to call you with an availability. 2. Sitting is the bar is the best way to go. Hands down. 3. Drinks have creativity but are on the average to above average spectrum of craft cocktails. 4. It's one of those things you have to do at some point. It's essentially a right of passage, a fun one at that, so just do it one time. Overall, it's fun but you are not missing out if you take a pass and go somewhere else.",4,1,2

97,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,4.0,6/13/2016,"Please Don't Tell is the most well-known Speak Easy in Manhattan. It is pretty hyped up, especially after being featured on Anthony Bourdain. If you haven't heard of it, it is basically a small prohibition-themed bar that's hidden behind a phone-booth in a hot dog restaurantThe speakeasy is small and packed so the only way to get in is through a reservation. I was able to make a reservation for a party of 2 on a Wednesday night by calling the number 46 times in a row right when the reservations open at 3pm. It took about 15 minutes but I was able to get through. The entrance in the phone booth to get inside seems to be the most unique part about Please Don't Tell. It has great drinks and atmosphere, but everything else was similar to all other nice speak easies in New York. Atmosphere is cozy and dimly lit. It's hard to differentiate the drinks between the various speakeasies, but the bartender was nice enough to offer drinks suggestions depending on our mood. I tried a sweet mango drink, and also a bacon style old-fashioned and both were great. One of the perks of Please Don't Tell is that you can also order the Crif Dogs (also featured on Anthony Bourdain). Me and my friend ordered two crif dogs (kimchi dog and Spicy redneck) - but it took a while to come out. It's a fun concept with awesome vibe and drinks. Although a little overhyped, you feel part of an exclusive club by going through a telephone booth and into a bar. I definitely recommend checking it out once in New York, as it is definitely a ""bucket list"" item, but don't waste your time waiting 1.5 - 2 hours in line because they are plenty of other speak easies in the area.",6,3,4

I came in on a Wednesday evening right at 6pm when they opened and there was already a line formed. The entrance is through Crif dog, the small hot dog place. Once you enter the hot dog place, there is a door on your left which has a small telephone booth and that's where you call the inside of this speakeasy by dialing 1.Luis, our bartender is the best bartender and recommended us all the drinks we bought and nothing was disappointing. You just need to tell him your preference and he has something for everyone. They have seasonal drinks menu so the drinks on the menu keeps changing but he can make anything from the cocktail book they have called the ""Please don't tell"". Definitely take a look at it.Some of my favorites are: Shark, Red Velvet, Jasmin (it has egg white in it but you can't taste it) and Benton (bacon infused bourbon).They have limited food option on the drinks menu but you can order any hot dogs from Crif Dog, just ask your bartender for the food menu. All the cocktails are $15, which is an average cost of a drink at a speakeasy.Definitely recommend this speakeasy for a good time and drinks. Cheers!",4,,
100,Katie S.,"New York, NY",252,257,382,5.0,4/10/2017,"One of the most talked-about speakeasies accessed through the back of a phone booth in a hot dog spot on St. Marks Place, PDT is a fun spot for a date, a solid cocktail, or to take out-of-towners.I'd recommend calling ahead to get a reservation, as the wait can get really long, especially on weekends. Their phone line opens at 3pm every day -- just keep calling until you get through, and be prepared to be flexible. They can seat about 40 people at a time, so there aren't too many reservations slots.I've only tried to walk in once, and it was on a Sunday evening around 9pm. They quoted us a wait time of an hour, but it was almost an hour and 45 minutes before we were seated. They took a cell phone number and we went to two other bars in the meantime, which was fine because this neighborhood has tons of cool bars.Once you do get inside, they don't rush you at all -- and in fact seem to make a point that they want you to enjoy your experience. Service is always notably kind and attentive. The last time I went, we tried the Mezcal Mule (be warned, the chili powder on top is strong!) and the Paddington. The menu lists ingredients and background information for each drink.I've never gotten food at PDT but they're connected to the Crif Dogs that they share the space with, so you can get hot dogs, cheeseburgers, etc.",2,,
101,Queen B.,"Alameda, CA",371,78,0,5.0,5/20/2018,"Great little place with wonderful cocktails! NY definitely beats SF ( my hometown) when it comes to speakeasys. Definitely get a reservation.

102,Ariel S.,"New York, NY",394,107,57,3.0,9/10/2017,"I get it. A speakeasy has incredibly pull and the fact that PDT requires you to enter a different establishment, use a rotary phone to enter, and wait makes it all the more enticing. However, I'm not convinced the 2-4 hour wait is worth it (and you can't reserve online / phone, only in person so you better have other plans in St Marks the day of).Aside from wait their decor is quite tasteful and sets the tone for a speakeasy: dark, mysterious, and exotic. Their space is tiny but they make up for it with rare collections of spirits (like their 20 year old Japanese whiskeys, some of my favorites). In terms of price, I can't blame them. Their small space lends to their air of exclusivity and this demand: hence low output but high price.This is probably a place you want to check out once, just to say that you did. Its slowly succumbing to tourists (as is most of St. Marks). If your willing to wait and pay $$$, then check this place out.",4,,

His luck has been pretty decent so far and we've been here a couple times over the past several months. Would I recommend coming here without a reservation? Probably not.The drinks are pretty good and I haven't encountered any snobbery from anyone working here, which is always a plus.Another plus is that you can order food from the hot dog joint next door.

And it's nice that they don't let it get too crowded. BUT it feels like a step back into 2010 - when dark speakeasies were all the rage. And by now, the only people falling for the silly gimmick of the telephone booth entryway are millennial bros, New Jersey visitors and Australian tourists looking to get very drunk. Advice: Keep the drinks and staff, lighten up a little and get rid of the gimmicks (and therefore, the stupid people). Cheers",1,1,
105,Julie T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",298,623,1257,3.0,8/14/2017,"So I didn't know how much of a secret this bar was until I arrived to get a seat. I think we passed it twice thinking that the signage would be obvious. We figured it out and approached the man behind the telephone booth doors. He was talking to a group of people that got there before us and it seemed like they were definitely denied a table or they didn't want to wait for a table. So we talked with him and got a one hour wait, but we weren't really sure if he was being honest or pulling our leg with the way that the conversation was with the people before hand. We came back and waited in the hot dog store while watching people come in and get denied, or say hell no to the wait time, or be given a wait time. We were close to thinking that we weren't going to get a table, but the text they sent to my phone never came through. So he gave us our little table inside this warm, dark room filled with taxidermy. It's a really cool ambiance, I loved the wooden ceiling, the taxidermy, the brick walls and warm lights.The menu has a very large variety of cocktails with some bites that you can order from the hot dog joint that the bar is hidden within. It was difficult to choose a cocktail, there were so many that sounded so great. I settled on the Benton's Old Fashioned and it was good. The cocktails were $16 a piece, so we kept it to the one drink.I have mixed feelings on the place because of how much of a hassle it was to get in, it made me feel stressed out and unwanted. Service was okay, they seemed to busy to even say much. So it wasn't the most pleasant experience. I'm sure it just seemed that way because it's just so damn busy, and most people don't want to wait for a table. Which you WILL have to wait, so be sure to make reservations to have a smoother visit. I do recommend that you check it out at least once if you can get in with no problems because it is a really intriguing bar with a huge variety of cocktails.",5,,4
106,Xiao Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",335,1004,1330,2.0,9/24/2017,"This may be the most exclusive speakeasy in NY, but in my opinion, maybe it should remain hidden to avoid trapping yelpers from overpriced drinks. I've heard about this mysterious phone-booth-entrance unique bar for quite some time now, and here are some of the facts: you have to call at 3pm (SHARP) each day to book a reservation and expect to be placed on hold for a very long time. You should show up promptly at your reserved time at the hot dog joint, pick up the red phone and dial 1. Then expect to enter a world of...well, legal alcoholic beverages for $16 a pop with some greasy hot dog and middle school tater tots to drown out the potent liquor. Part of the reason why I am a bit harsher in this review is even though we called at 3pm, we couldn't get a reservation until midnight, and once we got there, we had to wait outside for 25 minutes because of seating issues. The bar entrance is right next to a bathroom, in which the door doesn't really close all the way and it is super awkward for patrons of the hot dog joint to go in and out. As for the speakeasy itself, there are so cool features, like the stuffed animals on the wall, and the metal straws that accompany each unique beverage. While the menu does support a few cutely-named concoctions, I wasn't really blown away by their selection, except for the mescal mule (very spicy and colorful presentation). Due to the long wait, the patrons were kind enough to bring us a complementary chang dog (hot dog with kimchi) and I really didn't like the bland taste of the protein, nor the contrasting cold kimchi. At the end, it was a good experience...but for an exhaustive reservation, waiting outside at midnight, expensive drinks and subpar bar food, I think you can find other creative avenues to spend your hard earned cash.Food 2 starsDrinks 3 starsAmbiance 3 stars",1,,2

Updated review","They take phone reservations starting at 3pm, day of. If you don't have the foresight to call beforehand, do what we did and check in before dinner. It's usually a 1.5-2hr wait, so it works out well. Inside is super empty. They only allow as many people in as there are seats and there are very few seats. There's plenty of standing room, but nobody stands. It's really quiet and dark and the vibe is pretty sad. Drinks were strong but not incredibly unique. I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about.",4,,

Tables were booked and the girl told us there's a little to nothing chance that will get a table tonight. But we put our name down anyways. Then it turns out 2 of our friends can't make it out so we head over to see if we can snatch a table for 4. Side note: I think the girl said for a party of 4 or more, you can call and reserve a table. Anything less, you'll have to stop by the actual location to check availability. Waited in line, got to the front. Lucky for us, the hostess remembered my friend and told us to come back in 30min to get a table. We got a booth in the back and the ambience was awesome. Small dim lit place. We all got drinks (to be honest, I can't remember which I ordered) and the main event to the reason I wanted to try this place...the tater tots with caviar!

Ironically, it's one of the more ""famous"" speakeasies in the city. The place is super classy/intimate/small (as it should be) and they have a huge selection of beautifully unique, mixed-to-perfection cocktails to chose from.Our bartender was phenomenal. She didn't just make these drinks - she put every ounce of her being into these drinks. The service was the best, it is obvious that they all take pride in what they do. Furthermore, no one there was pretentious AT ALL which I was wary of considering all the hype and the fact that people apparently travel from all over and wait absurd amounts of time to come here.Getting into this place on a regular basis is crazy although I'm not sure if it was more insane because we went Saturday, the day before Valentine's Day. Reservations were full for the day when we called at 4pm (they start taking them at 3pm) so we went a little before they opened at 6 and there was already a line (they take walk ins at the bar). Thankfully, once we got to the telephone booth, we only had to wait 5 minutes or so before they were able to accommodate us. The host at the door taking names/reservations/seating people was excellent, efficient and although he was a smaller, younger guy, he was better at controlling the crowd than any other host/bouncer I've ever seen. EVER.As everyone already knows, the entrance is inside of Crif Dogs through a telephone booth which is obviously cool but the girl working at Crifs was ~constantly~ shouting that if you're waiting for PDT to form a line going out the door. Which makes sense because the space is ~extremely~ small and the line was blocking the walkway to the counter (aka fire hazard) BUT this also took away a lot of PDT's ""speakeasy"" appeal. There must be some connection between the two businesses because they serve Crif's food inside of PDT as well. I regretfully didn't try a hotdog but the tater tots with cheese and pickled jalapeños were MOUTHWATERING (and I am in no way a tater tots kinda person).After all the hassle, I did end up loving PDT and do hope I find myself here again. HOWEVER, I don't know if I genuinely enjoyed it solely because of what the place had to offer or if part of me was just caught up in the excitement of it all. I don't know if I would've been as happy if we had to wait longer than 5 minutes (which is normally the case, I think we just got lucky). The only truly unique aspect of PDT is the entrance, everything else is just like a normal NYC speakeasy/lounge/cocktail bar in terms of quality, pricing, service, and ambiance.

I got old fashioned bourborn and my husband got absinthe cocktail. Loved both our drinks. These guys are magicians. Quite skilled. You can get a hotdog in here as well but I wanted to look at the extended menu outside. We had the avocado veggie hotdog. Good. Overall great cocktails, worth a try def.Tips: Must try cocktails esp absinthe cocktail. Great place for friends to hang out with.",4,3,3

However, those pleasant memories are forever gone, as a dark, unpleasant shadow looms over. Earlier this evening I was harassed and disrespected by the very mean/Nasty door man. My friend and I were about to enjoy tasty leftover tater tots from our next door neighbour at the bar when all of a sudden they were snatched away in a very hostile and unpleasant way. I still don't understand why he snatched them away. It was very aggressive, unnecessary and I won't forget it. They just went in the trash!!! Will never return.",2,,3

Never again.Bartender named Adam, embarrassed my coworker. This never used to happen. Plus my drink was not good. I went with Bartender's Choice and he recommended an old fashioned. Really? Like someone who goes to PDT has never had an old fashioned? Can't recommend this place any more. Message to PDT: please fix this.It's sad when my old favorites deteriorate. I could've brought my coworker to attaboy, dear Irving, or death n co. Instead I recommended PDT and now I'm embarrassed. The golden age has ended and now PDT is just some tourist trap that bridge and tunnel people who saw it on a Bourdain episode go to experience. I am very sad.",2,1,

I came in at 7 pm at a saturday and the time allocated for my table was about 2 hours. After 2.5 hours, i checked again and she said that i was the next one in line. But i never got a call, not even once. Ultimately, i was really dissapointed about the level of service and courtesy of this place.

Our group of 4 spent 30 minutes repeatedly dialing the phone for a reservation and secured two. It was well worth it to experience such a fun bar and not deal with a long wait. The room is quirky, dark, and cozy. Not teeny tiny but also quite comfy if you're coming with a group. The drink list is plentiful and you're sure to find something up your alley.

Updated review","PDT is still nailing cocktails, but they hired a server who's about 95% Luna Lovegood and 5% Bellatrix LeStrange and it was real weird. She got our drink orders correct but delivered them to the wrong people (twice), kept touching our friend, came to our table about 3 times to ask about our first round of drinks within 5 minutes of getting them, and almost got our food order wrong (she repeated the order back 3 times and got 1/3 right). I like to be left alone when I'm hanging out with my friends and it was almost as if she was trying everything she could so that we didn't have a moment to ourselves. Sit at the bar!",6,4,4

125,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",752,1658,15153,4.0,4/25/2016,"Please Don't Tell has a very cool vibe. It's inside the famous hot dog joint, Crif Dog. There's a phone booth inside you call to make a reservation or you can call ahead to reserve your spot. Once you enter through the phone booth, you're in a different world. Crif Dog is very casual, but Please Don't Tell (PDT) is a dark, chic speakeasy. My friends and I were seated at a booth and our server instantly came over to welcome us. We each ordered a drink and enjoyed it. They have something for every palate. I couldn't decide so our server made me a sweeter drink off menu. All cocktails are $15.The best thing about PDT is that they serve Crif Dog's full menu granting you permission to enjoy a hot dog with your fancy cocktail. I ordered the 2Pak Dog and it was AMAZING! Order two to fill one person up.Also, be sure to use the restrooms while here and take a few photos of your reflection in the cracked wall mirror. It's very Instagram worthy!",1,,
126,Ben T.,"Roswell, GA",270,474,16,5.0,8/7/2017,"I will start off by saying two things: one, it feels wrong writing a review given how secretive PDT supposedly should be and it was the best experience in any bar I have had. PDT is a legend in the world of mixology and serves as a pilgrimage for many bartenders who take their craft seriously. To start I would recommend anyone whether professional or anybody who enjoys slinging drinks at home to pick up their cocktail book. This bible of sort is the authority on recipes, histories and tips for all things bar-tending. Also, any self-respecting bar will most likely have a copy of this book within a short grasp for reference which only adds to its influence. Coincidentally enough, they sell them here at the bar, got mine autographed! PDT somehow simultaneously started and perfected the modern day speakeasy. To get a reservation you must call at 3pm the day you wish to visit or else show up with the preparation of potentially waiting for a spot. I cannot stress enough how worthwhile a lengthy wait is and your patience will be rewarded. The entrance into the bar area is their pièce de résistance and describing in detail will only do one of two things: either spoil the experience for anyone not familiar or echo what so many others have already described in great detail. Therefore, I will leave this portion out of my review for you to discover hopefully on your own. Thoughtful preparation does not even begin to describe the immense amount of work that goes into their drinks. After reading the recipe book I learned just how much effort is invested in the ingredients, tools, technique and overall atmosphere created by simple variations of methodology. That does not even cover the layout, design and décor of the bar which has obviously been maximized for ultimate efficiency and enjoyment. Their low ceilings and lighting, coupled with some unique eye catching features makes the space incapacitating and enjoyable to be in.  PDT really is a bar to compare all others against and should stand in a class of its own. Bravo!",1,,
127,Angela Y.,"New York, NY",24,93,86,4.0,9/9/2017,"The concept is very interesting and there is always a wait if you are not there when it first opens. The drinks taste OK, nothing too special or amazing. The hot dogs taste good, and it goes well with cocktails surprise surprise",,,
128,Eva Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,4,5.0,4/24/2018,"Date night.Tiny, intimate spot with several bar seating and a couple of booths. Perfect for a date night (if you can secure a seat). I like to sit at the bar and watch the mixologists make drinks- they know what they are doing. Tell them what you like and they will make something for your taste-buds. Drinks are tasty and prices are what you would expect at a speakeasy.I've been here 2 times for date nights. Getting a reservation is not without effort. At 3pm, you have to call to make same day reservations. The first time going, kept redialing for about half an hour before getting through and was told reservations are full. Went with plan B, which was to arrive at the speakeasy 10 minutes before they open to guarantee a seat. Second time going, kept redialing for about 20 or so minutes, got through, and was able to secure a reservation! What I like about this place is that they have affordable delish food from the amazing Crif Dogs to go with the pricey drinks. Hearty food + fancy drink = perfect combo. And this makes it my favorite speakeasy, thus far.",,,
129,R J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,15,1,3.0,7/15/2017,"Fun to go just for the Speakeasy entrance. Food is from Crif Dogs next door. Yummy.

Also dig the 'House Rules' posted in the bathrooms.Recommendation: Make a reservation day of starting at 3pm. Seat up to parties of 8.",2,,
130,Mindy M.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,56,40,4.0,8/1/2017,This place was neat. The process of getting a reservation was a bit of a pain but also kind of made the experience too. We had to call 63 times at 3pm (reminded us of calling the radio station for a contest as kids LOL) the drinks were good but a bit higher priced even for NYC standards. The food from the hot dog place was AMAZING and totally worth a long wait. Honestly this place is a bit over hyped. It's neat but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again.,1,,
131,Gena L.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,33,57,4.0,3/18/2017,"If you want to take a visitor from out of town to a great speakeasy with amazing drinks, PDT is it. If you come here on a weeknight or weekend, chances are you'll have to wait a long, long time. However, there is a number you can call ahead of time to make a reservation. We came here after going to another speakeasy called Angel's Share. It was good, but PDT has better and more interesting drinks. It's a pretty comfortable size room with a handful of tables and seating at the bar. It's fun to watch the bartenders make the drinks. I prefer sweeter drinks--I don't like tasting too much of the alcohol. If you're like me, I highly recommend the Nuyorican flip. I don't remember everything that was in it, but I believe it was a rum based drink with hints of coconut. It came in a cute ceramic coconut shaped cup. My husband and his friend really enjoyed their drinks as well. I'm sure all drinks on their menu is amazing!",,,

It really makes me feel like I am in a secret club. AND the telephone booth is in a hot dog shop, what more could I ask for?The space is really cool. Small and that's why there can be a wait to get in. They have a few large booths for bigger groups. We had a party of 6 and were comfortably seated. The space is decorated with taxidermy. They have one bear hanging on the wall, Paddington, that is frozen in time in an action shot. Whoever sits next to him, looks like Paddington is going for the jugular. I think it is very clever. Our drinks were amazing! The bartenders are really fantastic and I judge based off of their ability to make an Old Fashioned. Kudos. Really. They have some really interesting twists on classic cocktails and also some innovative concoctions. We tried as many cocktails as we could and needless to say that led to my party being a little bit more rambunctious that I care to admit. Regardless, the service was amazing and the host had a great sense of humor. Definitely worth the experience.",,,

Truly.Yes, it's really exciting to step into the phone booth of Crif Dogs and the wall opens up and you feel like you're part of a special secret club. But that's certainly only the beginning!The decor with all the dark wood and wall pieces really helps to set the tone of the place. It's buzzing, but not too loud. It's cozy, but not too cramped. Really throws you back in time.I had PDT's version of a mule and ordered some tater tots & waffle fries to go with our drinks - we had a party of 8, mind you, but we fit! 8 is the largest size they'll accept. The cocktails are amazingly executed and the food really just goes with the late-night vibe.Make reservations ahead of time if it's not just a few of you who can sit at the bar - if not, they'll put your name on the list and give you a call when a booth opens up! That's what we did, but it was pretty late at night on a Thursday.Thank you, PDT, for an amazing experience.",6,1,3

I came here on a Tuesday for a party of two and apparently there wasn't too much of a wait (I didn't go inside the phone booth to make the call), but we must have waited about 20 min before entering Crif Dogs and into the phone booth to go to this dark and intimate place. Don't we all love to believe a little magic? It all felt very Whovian to me. The cocktails were delicious and very polished (only adjective I could think of describing them). They go down smooth, and they aren't too much of any particular flavor. I tasted about three, but ordered one: the Mezcal Mule. If I wanted more drinks I would have ordered the jasmine cocktail (forget the name), but basically you can't go wrong here judging by the drink menu (also I think the cocktail menu for drinks changes - so it might not be the same menu if you venture here). That hot dog was amazing! They are after all located inside of a hot dog place. I got the one the bartender recommended which was the Chang dog with the kimchi (I mean I wish I could have ordered them all!) Service was good. I think they got a bit antsy when we stopped ordering drinks and food - and sure enough as soon as we left, many more people came in to the phone booth",,1,
137,David G.,"San Diego, CA",1414,1078,2136,5.0,10/21/2016,"Please Don't Tell (PDT) is where the craft cocktail revolution of the last decade can trace its origins.  It was here -- through the secret phonebooth entrance inside Crif Dogs -- where mixologists had the bright idea of ditching artificial, neon-colored mixers in favor of fresh, top-quality ingredients served in classic style.It all seems so mundane now.  Every bar in town serves craft cocktails these days -- but PDT is still going strong.Why?  The ambiance.  There's still something mysterious about sneaking through a false-panel wall to enter a bar covered in hunting lodge-inspired decor.  Of course, PDT is the worst-kept secret in Manhattan, and crowds are routinely pushing past one another to enter.  I recommend dropping by at off hours and grabbing one of the first-come-first-served seats at the bar.  Don't even bother showing up without a reservation if you have a large group.PDT isn't nearly as pretentious as I'm making it sound.  Once you make your way inside, the cocktails are sublime.  I tasted an Aviation and a Corpse Reviver #2, and both were masterfully prepared and perfectly balanced.  The bartenders at PDT deserve all the acclaim they get.You can meet an interesting cross-section of humanity at PDT, with a mix of locals and tourists.  It's cozy inside, so prepare to eavesdrop on conversations, get into other people's business -- and possibly make some new friends.  A good time is guaranteed.",5,1,6
138,Bill M.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,0,1.0,12/14/2017,"Had high expectations heading to PDT. Wow, experience couldn't have been worse. The host has a few primary jobs to do: 1) answer the phone, 2) maintain a list (walk-ins and reservations), and most importantly, 3) communicate effectively with the customers.  The guy working on 12/8 was horrible. Just an outright tool. We called repeated before it opened and they never answer the phone (fail #1). We then show up at 5:30 to get in as walk-ins and wait in line for about 45mins before we are next in line to enter the phone booth and put our names on the list.  My wife watches the host write her name down and then he takes a call and turns away.  He does not tell her to hold on or wait in the phone booth, so she steps back into the neighboring restaurant to wait with everyone else.  The next person goes into the booth to put their name on the list and the process repeats with another 10+ people doing the same. After about another 45mins the couple behind us in line gets called. My wife goes back up to inquire why we were not called (both were parties of 2), and his response was that he crossed her name off the list because he didn't know where she went (fail #2). Now mind you everyone has been waiting together in a line inside the neighboring hot dog place just 3 feet away from this guy, but he couldn't be bothered to check where she might be?  WTF?  How lazy or clueless do you have to be?  Regardless, we said why did it matter that she walked away, she saw him write her name down and he took a call without asking her to wait. His response:  because he never got a chance to tell her how long the wait would be.  Seriously?  Even if he believes his own pretentious excuse, why wouldn't you at least call the person's name and see if she's been waiting? We then said fine, we should be next on the list, right?  It was his bad miscommunication after-all.  Nope. He said it would be upwards of 2 hours to get a table as others would be on the list ahead of us. The guy in line behind us even voluntarily said to the host that he vouched that we've been waiting in line like everyone else and deserved to go ahead of him. The host didn't care.  Fail #3.  Despite the time already invested, I concluded this place didn't deserve any more of our time and certainly not any of our money, so I told the host he could go penetrate himself.  We stand by that response and will never return to this pretentious over-hyped place again.",2,1,

Enter through Crif Dogs, and a phone booth is on your left.  Pick up the receiver, and give them your name.  There may be a small wait even if you do have a reservation, but expect multiple hours of waiting if you don't have one. The beauty of PDT is that you can order from next door Crif Dogs while you're downing $16 cocktails.  The cocktails are fantastic and delicious, as are the cheesy tater tots you can order from next door.

The entrance is very novelty and fun and makes the visit an experience. There is a large variety of cocktails on the menu and we also got some food for the table. I wasn't a huge fan of the food (it comes from the hotdog shop next door), it wasn't the best quality. They could definitely improve on the food, they need more sophisticated options to match the ambience of the bar and better quality. The bar is dimly lit and intimate and full of taxidermy, it has a classic speakeasy feel.I would recommend booking as groups are not allowed to sit at the bar as a walk-in and you have to reserve a table/booth. The place isn't huge and I assume they don't want it to feel packed. It isn't the sort of bar you would frequent regularly but it is great if you have visitors as a bit of surprise.

Yes this is probably the most overhyped speakeasy ever, but I still really enjoyed the experience. Got a reservation for 6 at midnight after I called starting at 3 pm same day. Took 15 minutes of intense redialing to get through-their telephone lines must never stop ringing once 3 pm rolls around. In classic overbooked fashion, they delayed our reservation by 20 minutes. When we finally got in though, they remedied this by offering us free tater tots and waffle fries, which were DELICIOUS. I really appreciated this gesture-restaurants/bars who do this win major points in my book. Getting into the place was fun but sooooo overly hyped up. Yes the telephone booth inside the hot dog shop is a fun concept, but it's definitely not super magical. In terms of the drinks themselves, they were very strong but tasty. I got the Paddington, which was fruity and smooth. I didn't really think it was super unique or anything though. Didn't really rise up to the standard of my all-time favorite speakeasy nearby: Angel's Share. Overall, really glad I finally tried this place. It was fun to come here with a group of 6 because we got to sit in a half oval type booth, which made it really easy to talk. I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once and then maybe bringing unsuspecting friends here from time to time.",3,,

I was a bit perplexed with the whole entering-through-a-phone-booth-in-a-hot-dog-shop thing, but could not have been happier once I was served my first beverage.

I'm not saying that the cocktails aren't delicious, they are. The ambiance is pretty cool, sitting next to taxidermy is fun until you keep getting scratched by the bear claws since the stool is seated right near the bar. The bartenders though were friendly and unpretentious which makes it easy to forget the hoops you go through. However, waiting two hours after being told 90 minutes but told to 'stay close' was more than a little annoying. I can say that I've been there and that it was fine but after the hassle of getting in it's okay. If you're going to entertain guests from out of town it will be fun and they'll talk about it for weeks so I guess that's a plus.",,1,1

First off, we both discovered we are not Old fashion heads. I liked the VSCO peach. Tried the Red Velvet which i disliked.

After waiting for about a half hour, we got a call that we'd be able to get in and have a table for about 45 minutes. Already feeling invested after we waited just to go to this place, our group of five obliged.The interior is dark and the walls are covered with various taxidermy. We opted for tots for the table and drinks all around. I got the Paddington which was named after the taxidermied bear with the driver's hat overlooking the bar. I enjoyed it, but didn't feel like it was worth my $15. I dug the shattered glass walls in the bathroom. Service was fine. We were told that the group who reserved our table cancelled also and we could stay longer but we chose not to.

153,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,7/6/2015,"Whenever I tell anyone that I'm a big speakeasy fan, more often than not one of the first questions I get is: omg do you know the one with the telephone booth?!? Yes, yes I do. It's called Please Don't Tell and the irony of its name is becoming infuriating. Why? Because I'm fairly certain that this is the most popular speakeasy in the city, thus getting in on the weekend is virtually impossible. It took coming here on 4th of July, an eerily dead night in the city, for me and a friend to finally experience this mysterious establishment. Is it worth the hype? No. Because the hype is absolutely ridiculous and the ""secrecy"" of this place is, at this point, more kitschy than cool. But is it a chill speakeasy with creative drinks, highly skilled bartenders and an odd fascination with taxidermy? Indeed, it is.I guess I should start with the taxidermy. I'm sure Google could tell me what it's about, but I'm okay just wondering. There are bears, raccoons, and a few other unidentifiable animals. My friend happened to be sitting inside a literal bear hug, which was both comical and creepy. Oh, and there's also a painting of a nude man (or was it woman? can't remember) posing...taking a page out of Angel's Share's book, I see. Such an odd assortment of decorations, but this place is anything but normal so I suppose it makes sense. Where else can you drink a $15 cocktail while noshing on Crif Dogs that slide surreptitiously through a little slot behind the bar? That part is pretty unique, I gotta say.As far as the actual drinks go, my only regret is not getting the Benton's old fashioned. If I ever make it here again (I would need a very good reason to come back), that will be first on my list. I ordered some derivation of a mule - base alcohols were Wild Turkey 101 / some kind of gin - and it was as refreshing and delicious as I had hoped. My friend ordered the Cherry Bomb with high hopes, though she was sadly less than thrilled with it as it turns out. I don't think she's at all familiar with cognac (I'm not either), so I'm guessing that type of drink is an acquired taste. Still, the menu here is impressive - much like Angel's Share,  you need to take a leap of faith with some of the cocktail ingredients - as are the bartenders. That multitasking is second to none.Final thoughts: Nice speakeasy. Pleasant, laid back, good vibes all around. More ""chill"" than the average NYC speakeasy. The raging popularity is not quite warranted and palpably overwhelming, but if you can snag a reservation, definitely check it out.",5,1,

And you cant have a first impression twice sadly. The ambiance was okkkkkk....... nothing too special its a bar. I would not come back here for a date night. The only reason i would come back would be to bring a tourist friend.  Again, those bragging rights.",1,,
155,Stacy J.,"Saratoga, CA",560,24,3,4.0,1/17/2018,"I'm still extremely confused about my first visit here. We walked in on Sunday night, with at least 20 people waiting inside of Crifs Dogs, without a reservation - and managed to get seated in 10 minutes. I don't know what kind of magic my friend pulled with the host but somehow the initial 2 hour wait he quoted us turned into 10 minutes. Not complaining though, but I'll really have to ask my friend how she managed to do that. This is a good place for small groups to catch up over some high quality drinks. I ordered the mezcal drink, which was strong but not over-powering, and we got some fries for the table. Once you're inside and seated, the service was great - our server was really sweet and cool, and we enjoyed being there so much that we ordered 3 rounds of drinks even though they were $16 each. I also like their policies for not getting rowdy, not hitting on people, etc. I do wish there was more variety on the drinks menu. Every time I've tried to walk in since then (even at odd hours) there's been at least an hour wait. It's not my favorite speakeasy so I don't think I'm willing to come back if I had to wait that long. I'll make a reservation next time.",,,

Like its counterpart on the outside please don't tell is a small spot with specialty drinks cooked up by their mixologists in a laid back intimate setting. To enter you must go in phone booth and ring for the hostess to to let you in to be seated or to give your wait time. This spot is quite popular still so most likely you will be waiting, but it is definitely worth it. Drinks are one of a kind and occasionally they have ones that are limited time.

158,Jenni W.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,78,203,5.0,6/6/2017,"I've been trying to come to this place for a while now, but it seems that whenever I plan on going, the wait is always at least 2 hours. This past Saturday, I decided to give my luck a try--two of my friends were visiting from Florida and had never been to a speakeasy before. With a party of 4 or more, you may have to make a reservation for one of their booths. After showing my friends how to get to the entrance (they were amazed at the phone booth), the host took a couple of minutes and asked for our IDs, and we were in! We got the personal table in the back right in front of the bathrooms, and couldn't believe our luck. The ambience was nice, with the music not too loud. In addition, the service was amazing! The waitress was very knowledgeable about the drinks and gave a great off-the-menu drinking recommendation (the French Maiden if you like ginger beer) and provided great service. The cocktails that we ordered were also delicious! I am not a huge fan of most brown liquor (whiskey, gin, and cognac), but the ingredients in each drink complemented each other well. Even though drinks tend to be on the pricey side ($16 per cocktail), it's what people gotta prepare for for speakeasys in the city. Would recommend their version of the Long Island iced tea (forgot the name) and the French Maiden! Try to make a reservation if you know you want have a fancy night out!",,,

Not sure if it's GOOD - but it's deff. interesting and worth experiencing. The bouncer made a rude/demeaning remark to my friend and I when we were leaving because we were a bit tipsy. Why make your clientele feel like shit when they come to buy drinks that are intended to make them tipsy?

160,Stephanie G.,"Kearny, NJ",154,100,106,4.0,12/3/2017,"Best piece of advice I could give anyone going to this place.....make sure you get a hot dog from criffs while you wait to get into PDT. The concept of the phone booth is epic. Walk in, dial 0 and then another door opens by the host who informs you what the wait time will be , takes your number and then will text you once there's space for you and your party.  We waited about 20 minutes on a Friday early night (7pm). We sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails.....they have a food menu and we realized they share their kitchen with criffs dogs who then slides the food into PDT  through a slit behind the bar....interesting. I didn't try their food so I can't comment on it, but criffs is awesome so I can't imagine it being bad. Our bartender was helpful and patient with my friends who are used to a typical vodka soda vs. the craft cocktails they offer. All in all, really enjoyed this place.",,,

Random, but okay. Went across the street to grab some beers at BUA and waited for the call to come over. Waited it out, walked back over, and ""sneak in"".The ambiance/vibe/decor is cool, but not really ""speakeasy"" or seemingly worth the hype. We landed the back round table which was pretty awesome.Cocktails were actually really good, my buddy and I got the VSOP Peach ($15) with VSOP cognac, Madeira, peach tea, and other fancy stuff. Delicious.The only downer here is the service, which is a combination of seemingly slightly indifferent and acting as though the guest is ""lucky"" to be there.

165,Leonard L.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",758,1415,4087,5.0,6/2/2015,"PDTNY Manhattan St. Marks1am Saturday Morning 30th May 2015Five StarsThis is the mythical unicorn of cocktail bars. We entered the vintage phone booth on the left hand side of crud dogs so many times throughout our five hour night of bar hopping. It felt impossible but it has been accomplished. The hostess was really nice. The place is small and sexy with a low ceiling and taxidermy. The cocktail menu was amazingly complex with cool back story behind each cocktail. Flowers in Her Hair takes its inspiration from Led Zeppelin's song ""Going to California"" off their fourth untitled album. The interesting part is that the cocktail uses white peony tea which a shop on St Marks called Physical Graffitea (which is where the cover of Zeppelin's Album Physical Graffiti was photographed). The Cocktail also incorporates White Armagnac, White Vermouth, and a clear citrus liquor called Nardini Acqua de Cedro.  The cocktail looks like cold ice water in a coupe but it packs quite an alcoholic punch. The Hiccup takes its name from the lead character in How to Train Your Dragon. It was composed of Genever, Mead, Beet, Lemon, Ginger, Pecan Bitters served in a highball and garnished with a lemon wheel and beet flower. We also had three types of specialty hotdogs. Chang Dog ($7): Bacon-wrapped, deep-fried crif dog, slathered in momofuku kimchi. The second was  the Wylie Dog, but I was a bit too sauced to remember the fried mayo. The specialty dog was spicy and we ordered another one for good measure. Overall, PDT was a great experience even though it took forever to get in.",3,5,3

He saw this place featured on Anthony Bourdain's show The Layover, and naturally, he was raring to go, as were lots of people too apparently.  Lucky for us, we got in without a reservation!  We purposely got to PDT at about 5:30 pm to get in line.    We wanted to see if we could snag seats at the bar. They don't open until 6 pm, but we found a couple of small groups in line already inside Crif Dogs.  As soon as 6 pm hit, the process started. You get into the phone booth, ring the door bell by dialing 1 on rotary phone, and the hostess opens the door and asks if you have a reservation. We did that and the hostess very nicely offered a table that was perfect for the 4 of us, but the catch was we have to finish by 7 pm, as that table's reserved for a group coming in at 7 pm. We happily agreed.The service that we received, the cocktails that we drank, and the hot dogs and tater tots that we ate were all excellent. Our server was so friendly and patient. Thanks to her excellent suggestions, we all enjoyed drinking our own drinks and tasting each other's. BTW, all cocktails are $15.  Here's what we enjoyed the hour we were there:Hanami--I wanted a less boozy drink, so our server suggested a drink from the first page of the cocktail menu. I had the Hanami (Sake, Plum Brandy, St. Germain and other stuff). Came together really well and was only a tad sweet. Pearacea--truly a panacea for those suffering from whiskey deprivation. The hubby wanted something with whiskey, so this was perfect. This one had Scotch, Brandy, Lemon juice, Ginger, Honey and bitters. A big cube of ice prevented quick dilution. A tad smokey, very smooth, a hint of sweet and nice acid. Very good drink and I'm not a Scotch drinker. Slices of pear for garnish.Shark--it has an umbrella, it's blue, and sweet. You'll be transported to a tropical island with this drink. Butter infused silver rum, pineapple, blue curaçao, frangelico, lemon, bitters. Stiff but delish. My sister was very happy with this one.2Pok Dog ($7)--this is the best hot dog I've ever had! It was so tasty! It had a deep fried hot dog, Pok Pok Wing Glaze (we've had PP wings in Portland and they are delish), Crispy Garlic, Roasted Chili Mayo, Pickled Daikon and Carrots and Lettuce. All this made for one flavorful bite--a little spicy, a little sour, a little sweet and a little salty.  We all had to share that one dog. It's too bad really 'cause it would have been nice to have had the whole thing by myself! Chang Dog ($7)--named after David Chang of Momofuku fame. It's a bacon wrapped deep fried dog with Momofuku kimchi. My sister's boyfriend ordered and enjoyed this. I didn't get to try it but he was very happy with it! We really enjoyed our experience here. Even though we had no reservations, we did not experience any rudeness from any of the staff members at all.  It's a tiny place and it's very popular, so I would suggest making a reservation. They only take same day reservations, so call at 3 pm when the phone line opens. Keep trying until you get through.  When we left PDT at 7 pm, Crif Dog was totally packed inside and there were people outside waiting, and this was on a Sunday evening! Cheers and good luck!",7,3,7

Find the hot dog shop between 2d Ave. and 1st.4. Enter the phone booth.5. Dial 1. Once.6. Wait for the hostess to open the secret door. She will seat you.Way fun. Nice place with good, well made drinks, friendly service. Small and packed, so you may wish to reserve a table for your party, but I've always managed to find a seat at the bar.

I'm trying to figure out how many stars to give and do so according to the absolute quality of the bar as opposed to the degree to which it failed to meet my expectations, but it's tough.As you may well know, this place has gotten famous for requiring patrons to enter through a clandestine phone booth inside of Crif Dogs in the East Village on St. Marks Place. Don't plan on getting a reservation of any sort and be prepared to wait an absolute minimum of 1.5 hours, with 2-2.5 being the norm.Entering through the phone booth is definitely cool and feels exclusive, but as far as cocktail bars and lounges go, the inside was extremely, extremely disappointing. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing bad about it, it just isn't worth the wait. It's small, dimly-lit, and interestingly-decorated which is fine, but the cocktails are in the $15-17 range (undeservedly) and I didn't think they were anything special. It's certainly no Dear Irving or Raines Law Room and I would strongly recommend going to either of those places before PDT.",1,,

We decided to wait and go to a nearby bar for a drink first. An hour later, we got a call that they have a table ready for us. Sweet! We told him we would close our tab and head on over. We managed to snag a booth table on the corner and had a great view of the rest of the lounge. My friends and I each ordered something different. I made the ordered their version of an old fashion which was infused with bacon. Although it was good and different, I preferred all the sweeter cocktail options they had available. There were definitely several pages worth of cocktails. If you have any questions, just ask the server as they were very knowledgeable about the cocktails and can try to cater to what you like.

The entrance was discretely attached to the infamous Crif Dogs. No line formation or standing allowed. Intimate atmosphere, packed with people on dates or small group gatherings. The bartender was professional, knowledgable and friendly. He even let us take a peek at their original cocktail bible, which featured recipes for every original beverage offered. Our favorites included the Shark, made indulgent with butter-infused rum, as well the Old Fashioned, one of the smoothest we've had. These cocktails are heavy on the alcohol, don't say I didn't warn you!As for the food, take a look at their extended, special Crif Dogs menu - it offers more gourmet options than the dogs you would normally receive at the regular place.

The bartender told us that we shouldn't be touching the materials so that made sense. Later, we asked the bartender for an umbrella for a new friend that didn't have one in her drink and were told that the umbrellas are expensive and only come with one particular drink. The bartender proceeded to remove the umbrellas from the bar too and hide them. We later looked the umbrellas up and you can purchase a pack of 144 for $5 which nets to $0.03 cents an umbrella. Wow.

I was lucky enough to jump in line and be the first on the list. AND YES THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS. i did not know that! Even on a sunday evening, the place was 95% packed by 6:30.So yeah, the place is small, narrow, dark, intimate and quiet for the most part. what youve heard is right, you go into a small wooden phone booth, press the #1 and wait to be brought in. Service was alright. However, i sat at the bar. Another thing--even if youre sitting at the bar, you dont pick your seat, you are seated in a specifc spot. The bathrooms are small but something in itself to look at. Love the decor and broken glass on the walls in there.Come here for a drink at least once, its worth it!",6,2,5

186,Tessie V.,"New York, NY",3,296,149,4.0,6/22/2016,"Went here for a pseudo-date. The date was awful. PDT was a riot. I've been dying to try it since I was a high schooler, 5 years later on a whim, I begged my date to bring me. It was around 8pm on a Friday. We had no reservations and the girl let us in! It was a good crowd, not too packed.We grabbed a seat at the end of the bar (right by the moose!) and the bartender was quick to greet up.Cocktails are expensive, not crazy expensive just NYC average expensive I don't remember them being exceptionally brilliant. But I'm a huge sucker for atmosphere and it's delightful. Very swank. I dropped I believe 70 dollars on four drinks for the two of us. You can also order from Crif Dog's menu, which is always a plus in my book.I would love to make PDT a regular place of mine, but experiencing it once or twice is probably enough for a lifetime.",1,1,1
187,Shauna A.,"New York, NY",31,92,81,3.0,3/7/2017,"I feel like PDT is a pretty kool pace to have a real adventure. I came here it was in search of absinthe. Lol I saw a buzzz feed video about absinthe and wanted to try it. The first time I came I was alone and the wait wasn't that bad. I got a seat at the bar and order a bacon bourbon and a bahn mi like hot dog, which was soon freakin good. I wouldn't mind coming back just for the hot dog. I didn't get the absinthe, because the bourbon was more that enough for me. This second go round I came with a friend!! Upon arrival it was PACKED. I didn't know this place was so popular. We stood in line to sign up for a table and it was a 3 hour wait. My mouth still of the floor. We went ahead and signed up because we didn't know where were would be in 3 hours...surprisingly were weren't that far. We make our way back after the hostess called my phone. I of course got my hot dog and some absinthe. Lol it was the nastiest think I've ever tasted. liquorices I found is not something I enjoy. I managed to drink almost half before I could no longer take the taste and realized I was drunk lol. Overall I'd return with some friends who aren't from the city to show them a pretty kool bar. I really wish its wasn't so small, but i guess that's how the speak easies were back in the day",1,1,1
188,Ena G.,"New Rochelle, NY",107,24,18,3.0,11/16/2017,"I was dying to see what this place was about since my friend and many others have Put the Red telephone on the wall on Snapchat. I Decided to take the right person with me, someone who enjoys the craft of cocktails & I'm not sure if it was the fact that it was a Monday night and we were just being spontaneous so not much was going on in this so hidden bar, but there's not much to It expect the drinks and a few cool ferrets on the wall.",,,
189,Colleen D.,"New York, NY",139,144,351,4.0,6/25/2016,"Cute speakeasy. Loved the telephone booth setup. Drinks were good. We didn't have a reservation, just took a chance walking in. It was during the week around 8 and we only had to wait 30 minutes. Not bad. Not as fancy inside as Raine's, Dear Irving, Employees Only but I still liked the atmosphere. Also much smaller than the above so may be harder to get into at busier hours. It's not my favorite speakeasy but it's a must try at least once to cross off your speakeasy bucket list. May be one of the more authentic speakeasy vibes (after the much missed Milk & Honey)",1,,1
190,Andrew G.,"Summit, NJ",543,498,315,4.0,1/8/2017,"I'd been anticipating PDT for years - and I must say: it definitely lived up to the hype. As everyone states, pop into CRIF DOGS, and then enter the phone booth to the left. We went at 6:15 pm on a Saturday night for a before-dinner drink - it was packed. We waited inside CRIF DOGS until we were called (~20 minutes). The ambiance is everything you'd want in a modern day speakeasy: small, intimate, dimly lit, and styled with an old-school, outdoorsman vibe. We were seated quickly and the cocktail menu was brought out: monstrous. About three PAGES of PDT originals and twists on classics. What I liked the most about the offerings were how original they all were. So many of the cocktails' ingredients I'd never heard of before, and I'm a pretty well-learned man of alcohol. I ended up going with the ""Double Crown,"" and the ""Foxtrot."" Both were fantastic, but the Double Crown stole the show. Perhaps one of the tastiest, smoked cocktails I've ever tasted, it really hit the spot. I'd highly recommend it as my go-to there. $15/cocktail for every drink. Not bad. Definitely one of my favorite mixology places that I may never get to go to again. I'd always recommend you stop here in your lifetime to try some really original drinks.",7,,4

Updated review","Made a 9 pm reservation. The incompetent door woman  lost our reservation first then told us to stay close by for a quick call from them , an hour later still no call . After I called her she said 15 min and then again there were another 20 min at their door! PDT I won't put up with this crap! We took our wallet to Dead and co instead and will never come back there!",1,,
192,Yy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",74,2,6,1.0,8/18/2017,"The guy who works there in front of the secret door wears a pair of glasses and blonde hair Asian face, me and my friends asked him how to get in? He ignored us totally and shut the door down! Very rude attitude! How is that attitude about?! Is it suppose to treat customers like that? This is a bar in the end no matter it's a secret or not, no matter it's hot or not!!! You should always have good customer service! I need an apologize for that!!!",2,,1
193,Athena N.,"Bellevue, WA",98,4,12,1.0,8/18/2017,"Poor customer service. The front desk guy (Blond skinny Asian guy with glasses) was super unfriendly and ignored my inquiry for the waiting time. He refused to apologize for his rudeness and shut the door without finishing our conversation. If you're owner of this place and reading this, please do give your employees a recep on customer service training. It is the most important thing operating a restaurant, and that's what make your place special. You get what you paid for.",2,,1
194,Sejal B.,"New York, NY",373,76,525,4.0,4/26/2016,This place is a really awesome speakeasy on St. Mark's Place. It actually is located in Grif dogs where you have to go through a payphone booth and pick up a phone and walk into the speakeasy that way.The atmosphere is really cool inside it is dark and intimate and a great spot for a date. They have a variety of different drinks to choose from. They also have a cocktail book that you can specifically ask for that lists so many more assortments of drinks. Not many people know about this book so if you're really interested in trying new and unique concoctions you should ask for it.The service is great and the waitstaff really knows what they're talking about when they're talking about the drinks. They also make great recommendations. The place never gets overly packed so they are attentive to your needs.The only thing about this place that I would complain about is the fact that it takes so long to get a reservation here. The first time I went here on a Friday night we I had to call at 3 PM on the dot as soon as they Open up the phone lines to take reservations to make a one for later that night. The other time I went was on a Monday night and we had to get there at 6 PM exactly when it opens to get in. It's just too much unnecessary effort. They also keep you waiting outside for quite a while even though you have reservations before letting you come inside. Other than that it's a really fun place and definitely worth trying,2,1,1
195,Denny S.,"Brooklyn, NY",216,355,1015,4.0,4/10/2016,"I'm not going to tell you to not go here, I am telling you to at least experience it once. There's at least one hour wait if you try to go here any day of the week, obviously Friday and Saturday night are the worst.You're best best is to limit your group size to a max of three so you can walk-in and leave your name since usually they will seat those with reservation first, then walk-in. If you have group more than three, highly recommend to make reservation by phone, after 3PM.Space is very limited and it's very small so if you're the type of person who doesn't like to wait, I don't think that you're going to enjoy the experience.The drinks are good, all of them are $15, however if you add the wait. it will make you feel it's not worth it and don't want to come back. It almost feels like, you can get better drinks with less wait, like Death & Co or NiteCap.Try it once and see for yourself..!",3,,
196,Dumond A.,"Manhattan, NY",7,87,5,4.0,9/3/2016,"Pretty awesome, cozy little place, but don't even THINK of heading over without a reservation.Me and a friend of mine from out of town read the reviews and really wanted to check out the secret entrance, enjoy the private atmosphere and some really fancy (pricey) cocktails.  The PDT deals all three of those things in spades.  We tried the ""Smoking Aces"" drink and loved it.If I had wandered into this place by chance, and been seated within a reasonable amount of time, it would have been the coolest thing to happen to me in years.  You literally walk in through a small, lively hotdog spot and into a cramped phone-booth, into a secret bar!  How cool is that?But what ACTUALLY happened was, we got there at around 9:30 PM on a Friday night without a reservation, and were told we had to wait anywhere between 2 to 3 hours just to get a table for two or a spot at the bar.  Fair enough, all things considered (really cool place + weeknight = holy ***** wait time), but it kinda killed the joy of discovering the secret spot etc.Fortunately the area around this place has a ton of other interesting restaurants and cozy bars, so we horsed around for a couple hours and got a phone call from the staff at PDT once a table was free.Will definitely go back here at some point, and maybe use my brains (i.e. make the damned reservation a day or two in advance).",,,
197,Karen B.,"Franklin, WI",0,3,0,1.0,3/28/2017,Can't really give a zero star but more than 1 star won't work either.  I was at this place on Thursday 3/23 with my son.  We showed up at 6:30 and no we didn't have reservations.  As visitors to the city we did not realize this was a high mistake.  The host said it would be 45 minutes.  We took him at his word and we waited.  We watched reservations enter.  We even saw a couple with out reservations name drop and get in within 15 minutes.  We asked again on the wait and told there were two parties ahead of us.  We sat and watched groups leave and after what ended up being two hours later we left.  Ended up at Employees Only and had outstanding drinks    So either make reservations or don't go (unless you've got some pull).  Either way skip it and have a great time at another place. New York is way to big to put up with this.  Nothing was worth the hassle.  I don't care what they serve.,1,,
198,Natasha H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",341,19,103,1.0,5/26/2017,"This place was super elitist for NO reason. We waited 2 hours for a beer and tater tots that cost me $16. We made a reservation for 3 and my friend had invited another person last minute, and instead of letting us have an extra seat they said we would need to wait another 2 hours!! Like, wtf?? If you're looking for a ""cool"" speakeasy to go to, definitely don't waste your time here.",,,
