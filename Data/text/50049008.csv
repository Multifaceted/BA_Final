I was in need of coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well sorted this store was.After checking out their offerings, I went with an iced coffee with almond milk, and a large bottled water. I considered getting a vaping pen, but decided that a nicotine addiction is not a good addition to a caffeine addiction.The cashier and I chatted a bit, while I sipped on my coffee and waited on my friend. It turns out the cashier is a co-owner of this place, and he's a pretty cool guy. The store is located on a busy street, on which Grand Central station also sits. The surrounding area is largely safe, and the people you see walking around here are consistent with the folks you'd find in Midtown or Chelsea.This is a great stop for food or drinks. Give them a try!",13,6,15
1,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,7/23/2018,"This place has one of the best salad bars in the area! A small ($8.66 with tax) comes with 1 protein, 2 premium and unlimited vegetables. But the unlimited topping selection is AMAZING!!! It includes stuff like tofu, roasted brussels sprouts, asparagus, portabello mushrooms, fruits, peppers, etc. Everything is already finely chopped so it's easy to eat. One star less cause I did feel like the guy was getting impatient with me ordering over 1000 toppings. He actually stopped me and asked what dressing I would like to move on. I've tried their hot/cold bar as well. It's more expensive but the quality is always good and consistent. My favorite is their teriyaki beef! Debit/Credit min is $5. Lots of seating upstairs.",1,,1

3,Erin K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,61,50,5.0,11/10/2018,"Stopped by for a bottle of sparkling water on a sunday evening. Lots and lots of drinks / snacks/ food options. Price seems to be reasonable. Most importantly, very clean space and friendly employees.There is also seating area upstairs which is pretty nice.",,,
4,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",153,765,9965,4.0,11/30/2017,"This is a popular lunch spot among my colleagues so I decided to come here today. Actually, Tabletime took over and renovated the space that used to be Cafe 42. Now the interior is much cleaner and brighter...all the food stations are on the same side and buffet by the pound is still located in the back of the house. I went straight to the buffet and damn $9.49lb (it's a bit pricey though). The hot buffet and salad bar...had different choices especially 4 kinds of rice. Oooo free complimentary garlic bread and rolls in a basket. There are only two registers towards the front which can be confusing with the lines for the food stations...just ask if they are on line or not. As I was walking up the stairs, I began reminiscing the times that I spent here during my college years with my classmates long, long, long time ago. I definitely will be back since it's less than a 5 mins walk from my building. Welcome the the Midtown East neighborhood =)",6,4,6
5,Amber B.,"Hudson County, NJ",713,309,861,5.0,1/17/2018,"Tabletime is a very good place whether you want to stop in for some morning breakfast or come in during lunch time. Conveniently located near the Grand Central Terminal, this place sure gets a lot of business. They offer a ton of variety on both food and drinks and this is a very clean establishment.",11,4,8
6,Wei Teresa C.,"New York, NY",82,107,189,5.0,9/16/2017,"Solid place to get lunch! I love their stir fry station - for about 10 dollars, you get a hefty portion of 5 veggies of your choice, rice, and one protein. You have the option of choosing brown rice or some other options for an additional charge. Im on a budget so for me, it's perfect to split into 2 meals, especially if you have some leftover rice that you bring to pair with this. I think it's a pretty decent portion size for the price in midtown, and it feeds my occasional Asian craving without breaking the bank. Comparable to buying a $10 bowl at chipotle and eating it for maybe 2-3 meals, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who gets tired of that. Tip: they load up on the protein! It's a pretty good portion and they definitely don't skimp out.",,,
7,Samantha W.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,69,26,4.0,2/19/2018,"I have a love- hate relationship with tabletime. I used to eat here for lunch all the time. They offered a great giant vegetarian tofu soup, or dumplings soup for $7.95. They have recently raised the price to $9.95 ( same price as seafood and beef) and I feel that the soup isn't as good- a bit watery. Sometimes the cooks are nice, but more recently they seem to be rushing. The salad bar is great - unlimited add ins , one meat and two premium toppings. The price of this hasn't changed - still $7.95.. and for an extra $1 you get a small soup. They have a good variety of snacks and breakfast bars- normal overpriced Manhattan prices, but good selection.  I hope the owner reads this and rethinks the new soup method- and considers pricing a vegetarian soup lower than seafood and meat!",,,
8,Ashley D.,"Tamarac, FL",46,70,15,5.0,4/30/2017,"This adorable restaurant offers a variety of diversed food in NYC. We were actually heading to McDonald's but THANKFULLY this restaurant had a sign outside to intercept our plans. You can get breakfast sandwiches here for less than 5 dollars. Lunch sandwiches are $9, but you get a big sandwich that you can save the other half for later. They also have a salad bar, Buffett line, and even Asian food (I NEED to go back to have a this beef on rice bowl they were offering). I enjoyed the Maximus on a toasted roll. This heavenly goodness was created with very well seasoned turkey, bacon, sun dried tomatoes paste and melted cheese. I took one bite and had to take a seat due to how good this sandwich was. Which is another cute addition to this restaurant. They have seating upstairs and 2 have-quick-bite tables in front of the cashier. Back to the food. My friends had the Philly steak and a customized Amazing. We all loved our sandwiches and had no regrets. The sandwiches and a Snapple came up to a $10.33. This restaurant also wears the hat of being a mini convenience store by the cashier. Offers allergy medicine, pills, gum, etc.Their bathrooms are clean, you have to be a customer to use them of course. I can't wait for my next NYC trip, it'll really be a trip revolving around eating at this restaurant.",1,1,1
9,John H.,"New York, NY",7,174,0,5.0,1/31/2018,Priced by the pound buffet selections are great and there's a lot of variety. I had to hold myself back from over-picking! There are also different stations where you can get food to order. Seating upstairs is limited but manageable. There are outlets if you need to charge your phone! I know this may be superficial but I like that their logo is printed on their floor mats and on the hot drink paper holders that adds a nice touch. Open 24 hours for late owls/early birds.,,,
10,Abram W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,10,0,1.0,7/25/2018,"Prices are different every single time, I order the same salad from there almost every other day and the price goes up for no reason!",,,
11,Courtney J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,25,3,5.0,9/17/2018,"Great food, very quick cashier service. I can be in and out of there in 5 minutes so its perfect if I'm in a rush.",,,
12,Tiffany P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",696,1,0,5.0,5/31/2018,"I went to this establishment for lunch this past week, and I had a great time there. The decor is clean, the food is delicious, and the ambience is perfect. This is honestly the best deli I've gone to in NYC. I can't wait to go back!",,,
13,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1266,914,4.0,4/27/2016,"Tabletime occupies the same space as a previous deli/steam table but I never went into the previous establishment.  To me it always looked like one of a hundred different steam table/delis that are littered all  over midtown Manhattan.  I generally find the food in them ""okay"" and overpriced.  However, when I passed by Tabletime and peeked inside (after seeing them renovate for weeks) I decided to take a look around.To my surprise, Tabletime looks like a modern eatery on the level of a Treehaus.  Sure there's still a steam table and deli section involved, but their presentation is strong.  Lots of wood, a bold ""Tabletime"" logo made up of retro looking light bulbs, a second floor seating area and an impressive array of drinks and ""grab to go"" options really made me take another look at this place.I have gone several times in the past week to get breakfast sandwiches.  Most of the time I get some type of vegetable with egg whites on whole wheat bread.  Sometimes I add turkey sausage or bacon.  Each time my sandwich was prepared quickly and came out very well.  The sandwich generally ranges in price from the $5-6+ range depending on how many veggies you add, but overall it's worth it for a fresh made sandwich.A quick note: the staff is very on point.  Each time I've gone there are people milling about, keeping things clean, organizing shelves and making sure no one is waiting too long to check out.  When a tourist couple was a bit confused, someone came out from behind the counter and talked them through all their options so customer service is clearly on their minds.If you need a quick bite and you want to have it in a comfortable, clean atmosphere, this isn't a bad place to check out.  The fact that I've gone back several times speaks to how much I've enjoyed it.",3,,
14,Rob M.,"New York, NY",394,17,4,4.0,4/24/2018,This is one of my favorites.  I work nearby and I can always count on a delicious breakfast sandwich made quickly or a great salad for lunch.,,,
15,Diana M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/27/2018,This place has a very good service and a very tasty buffet. I highly recommend it for lunch. The kale salad is the best I ever eaten. The people who work there are really nice too.,,,
16,Rebecca W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",152,64,71,4.0,10/31/2016,"Tabletime is my new go-to lunch place in the city. I was originally drawn to the place for its hot and cold buffet in the back, which has a better selection of cooked vegetables than most places in the area. I liked that I could get in and out very quickly - the staff is efficient.Then I discovered that the salad station has arugula, and I was really hooked.It is the best salad in the area for $8. You get a protein, four premium ingredients (think cheeses, eggs, avocado), and unlimited regular ingredients. The colors in the salad bar are popping because the ingredients are so fresh. Plus, it's a healthy-sized portion. I don't know why people would pay $10-12 for a salad at Chopt when you can get everything you want here.If you get a salad, it's only $1 extra to get a small soup, which is nice on a cold day, but nothing spectacular.The coffee here is also decent.",2,1,
17,N N.,"San Jose, CA",2,40,13,4.0,1/5/2018,"We were visiting New York and checking out all the touristy spots. While walking near Bryant Park on Christmas day, we found this place open. We walked in for lunch and ordered some hot sandwiches to go, which they made right in front of us. They have a decent list sandwich options. As we were about to leave, we noticed a hot food bar towards the inside of the shop. They served some hot noodles, fried rice, sesame chicken etc. These food options looked great. Wished we had seen this before we ordered the sandwiches. Maybe next time. Please do go inside and checkout all the food options before just reading their displayed menu and placing your order. They even had seating upstairs.",,,
18,Aeeza L.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",18,90,1976,5.0,12/1/2017,"Stopped by to check it out. Oh my! Haven't found this kind of high quality quick eat places much lately. The decor is modern and clean. Many varieties of food options- I decided to go to the salad and hot food bar. I got two piece of salmon sushi, one big piece of tuna sushi, kale salad, quinoa salad, roasted Brussels sprouts from the salad bar, and three pieces of coconut shrimps. All the food is delicious!! The salad is really fresh and cripsy, the flavors are great, and textures are just better than most restaurant food. The best, it's 9.99/lb and my lunch costs less than $8! With these tasty heathy food. Bonus, they sell many kinds of fine and healthy drinks from Korea, too.",,,
19,Emily S.,"Houston, TX",306,219,241,4.0,5/27/2016,"Pretty good place to grab a quick lunch. It's a hot bar so you pay for the weight of your food. They have sushi, salad, Italian, and fried rice. The mashed potatoes and fries were really good. But I would stay away from the baked ziti-Not good. The food is steaming hot so it would also be better to get a paper box instead of a plastic one. It's nice to eat your food at Bryant park right next door!",3,1,1
20,YonJee H.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",258,3,28,5.0,3/25/2017,"What I appreciate most about this deli is that everything is clean and the food LOOKS fresh/recently made. They really put a lot effort in maintaining the food quality and store cleanliness here, which a lot of delis/food places in the city stop doing or don't care enough to do. I think another selling point is that their food is msg-free, which again, I appreciate since pre-made food that you buy in the city can often be deceiving. The staff here are also really friendly and always  fast with service, so I would definitely recommend this place to others who are looking for consistent breakfast/lunch options.",2,,
21,TB B.,"Guttenberg, NJ",35,29,0,2.0,10/12/2017,"Highway robbery and poor customer service!!! I know it's midtown and it's expected but this place charges exorbitant prices for mediocre food, (at best), with a side of 'tude. I used to come here because of the convenience, (a short walk from my office), but I will not be returning. If you order a salad, the workers don't tell you your options, they get annoyed if you ask questions and rush you through the process. With the sandwiches, they charge an extra dollar if you order a wrap, even though it contains the same amount of ingredients and they've run out of rolls. Whole Foods is cheaper than this place and the quality is way better. With so many options in this area, there's no need to waste your money here. I gave this place many chances but they never quite redeemed themselves.",,,
22,stav P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,2.0,10/23/2017,"I ordered a salad - they mistaken the ingredients I asked for, then after putting them in told my I should ""speak louder"". They didn't try to correct the mistake but expected me to beat the salad with vegetables I didn't ask for. Then I asked for balsamic vinegar dressings. When I saw the dressing is only balsamic vinegar and nothing else I asked to add olive oil and salt and got scolded again that I had to say it earlier. It was an unpleasant experience. If they correct their costumer service it would be a decent lunch place.",,,
23,Michelle L.,"Queens, New York, NY",309,131,114,5.0,1/16/2017,"Great food, great service and open 24hrs! I always get my morning coffee here and lunch as well. They have a good selection of food in their buffet. Plus the food tastes really good.",2,,

25,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,4.0,11/28/2016,"Tabletime is a nice deli-steam table-grocery in Midtown, right next to the big public library. I've been three times for lunch dates and it has enough options inside to please just about anyone. The steamtable is definitely my favorite, as there are so many options, the price per pound is par with the area, and hot food is so much better than cold food. The food quality is excellent and the variety is really good. I love how many fruit and vegetable options they have. I also find that they aren't too crowded at noon, so I can be in and out within 10 minutes. The price per pound is reasonable for the area. The set up is clean and bright and the staff seem nice. Checkout is efficient.",2,,
26,Susan L.,"New York, NY",179,1921,0,4.0,11/7/2016,"I was passing by there early this evening and couldn't resist trying their food bar.  Apparently they have more of a selection earlier in the day, but it was sufficient and everything tasted o.k.  The price was the usual $8.99/pound for Midtown, but the place is spotless and the employees were pleasant.  There's a rather small (but attractive) eating area upstairs and it even has pitchers of water (the latter is a real rarity at these types of places).",2,,
27,Michael T.,"Montclair, NJ",53,107,16,4.0,8/10/2016,"I used to come here as a little kid when my dad would take us to his office on 41st street and get bacon and eggs on toast. Then one day I found out you could have that on a bagel and voila; I had my first BEC on a bagel here. Fast forward 20 years and I started working on 42nd a few years ago. I like to get breakfast/late night snacks/beer here. Service is prompt and the place has been cleaner then ever since the renovation. The menu has also expanded since the renovation/rename to include a variety of lunch and dinner options: sushi, bimbimbap, ramen, burritos, etc. If you're nearby and need something quick, give them a try.",3,1,1
28,Sabrina L.,"New York, NY",212,141,281,4.0,10/3/2016,"This is my new favorite go to lunch spot. Overall the place just looks cleaner, they have a pretty good selection of dishes at the buffet, the sandwich and salad stands are pretty good.

29,Emily K.,"New York, NY",4,28,0,4.0,8/5/2017,"Good service, good selection of hot and cold food, and pretty decent seating upstairs. Perfect for the type of food court you want to be in and out quick during work lunch.",,,
30,Chelsea B.,"Secaucus, NJ",325,332,187,4.0,4/22/2016,"I saw the balloons outside and made it a point to stop in for lunch the other day. I grabbed some sushi: a salmon avocado roll. I'm didn't see any mixed rolls, not even the typical tuna avocado and salmon avocado combo. I prefer getting those ones (with brown rice). I thought the pricing was pretty competitive for the area and I definitely enjoyed my lunch. They didn't have low sodium soy sauce, but they have different options. The packet I grabbed wasn't too bad. The place seems really clean and I like the light up name. I'll definitely be back again.",5,2,2
31,Chris S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,21,2,5.0,2/23/2017,"Great place for lunch in the Bryant Park area! Tons of options for food, frequent changes made to menu, and super quick service. You can be in and out in five minutes. Definitely a place to go once a week if you live in the area.",1,,
32,Shana H.,"Brooklyn, NY",263,249,218,3.0,4/17/2016,"This place is conveniently located and pretty dang new. That means that although it's similar to many of the quick-grab-a-bite-to-eat go-to lunch places that offer self-service in terms of food, it's clean. They offer the typical coffees, teas, sandwiches, wraps, and salads. They also have a wide selection of beverage options. There is a small section near the entrance that offers stand-up eating, and a larger seating section upstairs that has charging stations along the walls that hold up the tables. The music was rather solemn but nothing a quick station change couldn't fix.",1,,
33,Jackie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,40,10,5.0,1/24/2017,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the gus making the food. Not nasty rude guys like Essen on Madison and 41st. They smile, greet you and gget your order right.

I will definitely visit many more times! :),1,,1
36,Matthew A.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,1/2/2017,"Beware - they round prices up and nickle and dime you whenever they can. For example, if a sandwich is listed for $5.95 on the menu they round it up to $6.00. While it is only 5 cents it's just wrong.  Food however, it good.",1,,
