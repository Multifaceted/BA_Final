0,Yann M.,"Washington, DC",127,30,52,4.0,10/22/2018,"The burger was excellent. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. They have curly fries which everyone seems to love. I ordered the black burger which was about $6 with curly fries and a water. I spent a little over $11. These are like 5 Guys and Shake Shack burgers. The space is pretty small. It seats about 7 people comfortably. There is street parking. It is located in between the hardware store and poke bowl spot. Next time I am in Tribeca, I will definitely visit this location.",,,
1,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,4.0,10/5/2018,"I've been to this Black Burger a while back to only try their milkshakes and I thought they were delicious. I paid another visit back here after I was in the area tonight and I decided to order the black burger with cheese and everything (lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion), curly fries and a chocolate shake. Burger was nicely seasoned, fries were nice and crispy, and the milkshake, again, was delicious. I'd suggest however, that they toast the buns a little longer as my bun partially disintegrated as I was holding it. I had my burger done medium rare and it was pretty juicy and decent. Not the best burger I've ever had, but it'll do.",,,
2,Shell L.,"New York, NY",146,115,13,1.0,8/13/2018,"I GOT VERY SICK All I ate yesterday was a salad that I made in the morning, and a black burger with fries in the evening. Prior to yesterday I only had home cooked food from which no one else felt Ill. I have been miserable and bed ridden all day with food poisoning. I think that it is from this burger. I started feeling nauseous a few hours after eating here.  I have been very very sick all day. I almost went to the hospital. 12 hours later and I still feel like I'm going to die. I regret eating here. I have never gotten sick like this from a New York restaurant and I saw some other reviews that said they got food poisoning too, some had to be hospitalized and had a very high fever like me. Some got pushed to not recommended below. You have no idea how sick I am.",4,,
3,Jordan V.,"Port Moody, Canada",45,285,60,5.0,11/7/2018,"Ho man. What a solid choice for a well prepared, tasty burger in the late hours after a night out. The Jack Black, full of bacon, pepper jack, and onion rings, figuratively knocked my proverbial socks off. They cooked it medium per my request and the whole sandwich was a succulent indulgence. When can I go back to Tribeca!",,,1
4,Melissa D.,"Charlotte, NC",12,130,404,5.0,10/16/2018,I thought this place was really good. I ordered the jalapeno burger with pepper jack cheese. My burger was cooked exactly as I ordered. This was my first time at this restaurant and I recommend people give it a try. They have these really great curly fries and the portion is pretty big. I could not finish all of them. My order with a drink came to around $13 but for a freshly cooked burger and hot fries it's worth it lol.,,,
5,Glenn V.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3284,1380,2233,1.0,2/15/2018,"If I had dropped a tip in the jar after my order, I would have taken it back after my order arrived. The two guys that look exactly alike, brothers I'm told are about the most unprofessional pair of cackling hyenas I've ever endured, these two momo's are cooking and working directly in front of the customers behaving like that.Not one single word in English was used at any point during my time inside, I couldn't wait to get out of there and I should have -- right then and there. At no point did they stop the incessant and ear piercing offensive loudness of yelling and the counter girl and the box folder gladly joined in, modulating the other to sacrificial levels. Horrible behavior --- that is, anywhere in the civilized world.Now ---  I could care less about the certified beef you use and tracking the meat all the way to the moon and back or wherever it began.  Who really cares when your so poorly treated, why would I care? The beef in the Double Black Burger was far from special, or even average, indicating to me that what they sell may be different from what they promote. And the cast of misfits really puts an emphasis on even the smaller, seemingly inconsquential problems. Eg1: unclean floors, torn seat covers, cheap napkins, gummy floors, sticky counter, slimy sauce bottles, you get the point.The cheap bun fell apart in a moment upon any contact with any of the other parts, wet bun, wet lettuce wet burger, wet foil. This place is all wet and would never be a consideration again.Yet -- The title of Worst Burger and Worst Staff? Well --- that's too easy... Its this dump, and I can't wait to move that information down the Yelp line to all my buddies in forewarning.",31,20,22

Love that, esp. Since most people including myself get sick of eating the same thing all the time near the job.Come in with fast food expectations and not restaurant expectations and you won't be disappointed; it just costs more than your McDonalds and Burger Kings.Food:The burgers are freshly made on the spot and delicious and the size is smaller than a whopper. Their sodas are self service for refills and they cant seat much people if you are thinking about the dine in experience. I heard they're milkshakes are pretty good, esp the strawberry flavor and they give large portions for fries. So I will have to come back to try those and see for my self.",,,2

I usually order the black with cheese as a combo with all the free works lettuce, tomato, special sauce, pickles, & onions. The combo comes with seasoned curly fries & a refillable fountain drink. The burgers are not fancy but they are good. The space is minimal standing/sitting window counter space. I think the place seats 6-8 people semi comfortably. Pretty much eat and go or just to go place. The staff is friendly, the price point is reasonable for TriBeCa. Check it out if you need a quick burger and happen to be in the area.

Reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants back home, but better!I had my boyfriend pick it up for me while on his way home from work. I ordered a Philly burger with a side of curly fries. By the time he made it to Williamsburg (20 min) commute, the food was still warm and my curly fries were still crispy and crunchy! They gave me 5-6 packets of ketchup( I hate when I'm lacking extra condiments  with my Togo order). My burger was medium rare( perfectly cooked) and it was covered in melted cheese, mushrooms and sautéed veggies.I left no trace of deliciousness in that white box. All around wholesome greasy burger and best fries!",2,1,1

The order was placed easily online then we picked it up. I decided to have the Mexican burger with curly fries. The burger was cooked medium well as I wanted and seasoned to perfection. I love spicy food, so this burger did not disappoint. It was flavorful and spicy. The special sauce they use is amazing, I slathered my fries with it and it was so gooooooodd. I wish they had more locations! I will def come back to get a quick burger fix, and the meal is reasonable price!",,,

One black burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato $5.99 was perfectly cooked medium without any dryness but abundant flavor.  I desired red onions on my burger.  The bun was plain and boring supermarket mass produced and purchased cheaply.  My predilection is either brioche bread or sourdough bread.  One bottle water $2.49 was surely overpriced indeed.  Customer service is average but efficient without the ignore or apathetic cavalier attitude that I have grown so accustomed and intolerable.  I would like to try their curly fries as it is something that I highly covet.Extremely limited seating which does not meet the NYC law requirement of providing facilities to patrons.",7,4,7

Had the Chipotle Thursday special - includes drink and curly fries for $9.99 cannot be beat - worth hitting this place up if you're in the vicinity and wanting a sloppy burger. Curly fries were also very yummy crispy on the outside - balanced by the soft inside. Staff was pleasant, courteous and helpful. All in all a good experience. I'll be back.",,,1
14,Bree C.,"Manhattan, NY",374,88,90,4.0,4/18/2018,"Stopped by this place for a quick treat today while on a break from work. Already ate lunch, so decided to order a strawberry milkshake. While waiting, I noticed the aroma of juicy burgers cooking and fries sizzling.  My strawberry shake was done pretty quickly and looked like a dream. I opted not to have whipped cream, but the cashier made sure there was extra strawberry sauce in my shake. The shake itself had real strawberries and I loved that it also had the rich taste of ice cream. Perfect treat! One thing about the place that causes me to take off a star is that it is comically small in size. This is not a place where you can bring your friends for dinner, as there are only five seats scattered around the counter space.",1,,
15,Jessica R.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",26,77,102,4.0,8/2/2017,"Stopped at Black Burger to grab some dinner before my long evening class.  I ordered the regular cheeseburger combo which comes with curly fries and a fountain drink.  I did not have to wait very long for my food.  While I waited, I checked out the menu further and planned which burger I'm gonna have next!  They all sound so good.  They also serve shakes and a variety of bottled beverages here.  There is limited bar seating if you would like to eat your food there.I asked for my burger to be medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The curly fries were seasoned well also.  Black Burger is a great choice for a delicious burger without the crazy wait time or price like another place in the area.If you're ever in the area check this place out.  You will not be disappointed.",1,,2

18,Jasmine W.,"Silver Spring, MD",30,80,440,4.0,2/25/2018,I was in the area completing a continuing legal education course and had to grab a quick bite to-go before getting on the bus. Thanks to my handy dandy yelp app ;-)  I found this place right around the corner from the law school. I came on a Sunday night around 6 pm. It was mostly empty. I ordered the black burger with cheese.  It was a single patty and came with lettuce and tomato. I also added mushrooms and jalapeños. So good! The sauce was so flavorful i didn't even need ketchup. I also had the curly fries which were good also. The cashier was awesome. He was so friendly and personable. My food took about 10 minutes or so and was packed in a convenient box. Definitely a quality burger spot.,,,

I usually get a Black Burger with blue cheese, well done, with bacon. I ALWAYS get the milkshakes. The banana one is my fave because they actually use real bananas, milk and ice team to make them. Please can get very crowded around lunch time as this is the only ""good"" burger spot in the Canal street area. Unless you wanna go to Burger King or Mc Donald's lol. Fair pricing, free drink refills, limited seating. But still a great place to chow down. Plus there's a park nearby and benches out front so I don't mind taking my burger to go sometimes.",2,1,2

21,Joey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,5,2.0,5/15/2018,"This place is outstanding if you want the finest hockey pucks in the city. McDonald's burgers have more flavor then these things. The wait was unusually long for a fast food style place and the idea of putting my burger in a box isn't the brightest. It resulted in everything falling apart and being a mess. The entire burger tasted as if it wasn't fresh, they claim they don't use frozen burgers which might be true but this didn't look or taste like a fresh burger. The prices here are not fast food level but the quality of the food was lower then fast food quality.I don't have much to say about the fries other then ""meh"" because I lost my appetite way before I could eat enough of them to decide whether I liked them or not. Maybe it was just that one burger (or two since my girlfriend felt the same way) but black burger was definitely more like a bad burger during my visit.Free combos won't tempt me to try the food again eitherResponding to the owner: this is my review I am an individual person so if we both posted a review that's two separate people reviewing the business. The food simply wasn't good, and if I didn't like it the first time I won't like it a second time. I'll give you two stars since you seem upset, while it is true you have 4 stars at your establishments, you don't have 5 which means I am not the only one to give you a less then perfect review. Then again one review won't make a huge difference now will it. As for what was wrong with the food it was dry and tasteless and it made both of us feel sick to our stomachs perhaps it was bad meat or it wasn't cooked properly but I'm not the guy at the grill so I don't know what went wrong.",2,3,1

29,R D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,2,2.0,7/9/2018,"This review is solely for my experience today. BB is a block away from my work and I have been here several times in the past. I have the veggie burger and curly fries and they are hit and miss most of the times. But not too bad. To say that the service is okay... would be exaggerating. It depends on who you get behind the counter taking your order and / or what mood they are in.Today I walked in and ordered an Avocado milkshake, their 'new' milkshake as advertised outside the doors: a green looking cool drink! So I ordered that and waited for almost 10-15 minutes! Several people ordered after me and got their food while I waited for one drink. I had to remind the server behind the counter, who then sluggishly started putting the drink together. I asked him something and I am not sure if he mumbled or chose to ignore me completely as he just started talking to the next customer. When you offer an avocado milkshake, please teach your staff how to prepare it. He put the whole avocado, with skin in the blender! Half way through, I got so disgusted with pieces of the tough skin in my mouth that I had to throw my drink away.",1,,

Besides that lil craze happening outside, the flavors happening inside the store is just as craaazy!  The Hawaiian burger is pretty good, but the teriyaki sauce in the burger is a little too much.  I recommend you ask for it on the side of possible.  You can also say how you'd like your burger cooked which is cool.  The beef is nothing crazy, just regular beef -- decent quality. The curly fries(regular size) is good enough for 2 people.  And I ate a meal with free water, for just under $10.  This spot is nice, for a grub, and go.  Choose your time to visit wisely!  4 STARS!",4,,

They advertise they use fresh burgers but I question that after my experience with the food. I was in the area for mini golfing at Pier 25 and discovered this place on Yelp to grab a quick bite to eat. I just ordered a plain cheeseburger with fries and upon taking my first bite, I was disgusted. After eating a few bites of the burger, which I would not allow myself to finish, my stomach began to hurt. The burger did not taste fresh at all - it tasted like a frozen patty that was no better than McDonald's. It was basically a low quality fast food burger. If a frozen patty was what I was craving, I could go to McDonalds or Burger King for a fraction of the price for the same quality food. The fries were decent but very greasy. My boyfriend also had the same experience with his bacon burger and we agreed we will not be returning.",1,1,1

Fries & Strawberry Shake.  Your order comes packaged in small little neat box, in which they suggest you use as A plate, by folding diwn the sides. The shake was THICK & Tasty, fries very good and plentiful. The burger while Very G00D was on the small side. Speaking of small, the spot is very SMALL & seating is very cramped and limited.

I wasnt expecting much but it was quite good considering my only other option was $1 pizza and some lame fast food joint which shall not be named.I ordered the Texas burger combo with french fries and a fountain soda which came up to slightly over $10. Not bad at all.  The Texas burger comes with bacon,  cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce.  Their placard states that they only use top quality, never frozen angus beef.  It was pretty good and the fries were solid according to my equally ravenous company.  They only sell curly fries which is a Nice touch. Food was made to order--it seemed- so it did take a little bit of a wait.They have a small seating area consisting of about 8-10 outside facing stools and countertops.  It hit the spot and I would definitely return especially considering the options in the area at that time of the Night.

I understand making a profit but over a $1.50 (I think) for an egg on the burger? Cmon now.Seems like they started selling their drinks in cups instead of bottles which is pretty cool and I think the cups carries more liquid than the bottles, but the drinks taste a bit...weirder in the cups compared to the bottles.

Unlike the other hamburger close by with a name that also starts with ""black"", this place aims for the affordable, high volume output. The main problem I had with this burger was that they claim they're never frozen, but that's what the burger patty tasted like.  It was dense and not cumbly.  So kind of more like a fastfood burger.  The color was more grayish than anything.  And it hardly had any taste in my opinion.  There was nothing special about the bun either.  Overall, it reminded me almost of my elementary school lunch burger.  Not a pleasant memory.  Their fries (curly, seasoned) were good and there was a good amount.  I'm always pulling for the small, underdog places that put out solid, affordable food so I'll try this place again to see maybe if it were just an off day.  Note the place is really small (e.g., ~5 stools) and so much more suitable for takeaway (especially in the summer since it's all open air with no AC).",2,,1

Burgers werent fancy or anything, just normal burgers and we dug inProsProbably the closest thing to in-n-out you'll get (or i've found) so far in NYC.Fries are automatically curly fries (win in my book)ConsThe freaking wait. Whats going on 20 mins for a fast food like burger? I understand it was busy but they gotta speed that up somehowIf you're going to offer bacon, make sure the bacon is crispy. Not some tough, semi-soggy bacon. Isn't as good as in-n-out. Bread wasnt crispy enough and tomatoes and ingredients didnt gel as well. Not a fair point at all, but for someone who's from west coast, it tugs on my heartstrings so hard, its similar enough that it makes me homesick, yet not good enough.

I knew I need to get some food for myself since I had nothing in my fridge. What better way to get fed, than to wander around until you find something new! For almost all my life, I could always remember that this location used to be one of those electronic stores with a million cameras in the window. It's funny how now, it is a burger shop! Jon and I followed our noses and found ourselves walking into Black Burger. A very simple restaurant with bar like stools set up around the perimeter, the counter top is strategically covered with the special of the day/ week. The specials are usually some new burger with a side of fries and a drink. The day we walked in, it was the Hawaiian Burger special. We quickly ordered two specials and dived in. I don't know why I ordered the special, because I don't eat that much... I had the regular curly fries and Jon ordered the calamari fries. The fries weren't bad but obviously the burgers are the things to order here! Our Hawaiian Burgers were glazed with a sweet brown sauce and were topped off with a nice juicy slice of pineapple.

Cooked just the way I asked for it, flavorful patty, and just big enough. I did get the combo and the curly fries were also really good. The one bummer was that the way they pack the burger into the box is on the side (as many places do) and when I got to the hotel, the cheese had apparently slid to one side of the burger. Guess that tells me it's fresh!A couple of days after dining here I was craving another burger but a check of Yelp told me that this place wasn't open on the weekend.

Updated review","I went to the other one located on 362 Broadway. Well done. Friendly courteous staff they know their way around a burger even the bacon medium rare ones. ( they give us newbies a chance to decide what we want on our burgers ie:lettuce tomatoes onions, mayo (the standards). One note please bring back the calamari fries. At least once So at least us newcomers to your company can experience the crunchy ""squiddy"" goodness  of them at least once.",,,
147,Kevin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,117,86,1.0,8/1/2016,Ordered from uber eats and the burger was extremely dry. I had to drench it with ketchup to add some moisture to it. Absolutely terrible. Reminded me of school lunches,1,,
148,Ariah D.,"New York, NY",158,23,6,2.0,1/22/2016,"Ehh - not impressed. The burger was tasteless, literally could have been eating air. Which is surprising considering the burger I ordered what supposed to have blue cheese. I asked for medium-rare. It was medium, no pink so that was disappointing. The burgers are thin so I guess no matter how they cook them they are medium or well-done. I drenched it with their sauce, still not much help. The cashier who took my order was also not very nice. Had an attitude and looked pissed when I asked her for something as simple as ketchup. Maybe a smile and a thank you or 'you're welcome' is too much to ask for in the city.The fries, however, is the reason this review has as many stars as it does. They are their only saving grace. In my opinion, good fries are a dime a dozen, but good burgers are hard to come by. And this place ain't it!!!",,,
149,Cole M.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,4.0,1/5/2017,"When Shake Shack is packed and you aren't willing to pay $8 for a decent burger, Black Burger has you covered. A lot of people on Yelp have complained that the conditions are unsanitary but I saw the man cook it up. You can see the kitchen. It's simple but not dirty. As someone who has worked in a dirty kitchen or two, I know the difference. The staff was very nice to me even though I went during prime after school hours. When I asked for the burger medium rare, they had no problem making it that way. They even gave me a handy dandy box to go. The meat is never frozen so that's a plus. The bacon is also top notch and cooked well. Basically, for prices slightly higher than McDonalds, you are getting an above average burger. Great for take out.",,,

I ordered the bacon black with fries and a drink.I got everything they offered on the burger, including their special sauce. The signs say it was a fresh burger but it took a pretty long time to cook the burger up, especially since it was a pretty thin patty. The burger was all right, not the best fast-casual burger I've had but not the worst either. Their fries were good, crispy and cooked right during my visit.

I've never had anything less than or anything that I had to take back and j can't say that about too many restaurants.. The cashiers/cooks are always nice! If you come here please make sure you try the ""special sauce"" it's usually by the counter if someone isn't holding it hostage because it's so great! This restaurant's burgers and fries are veryyyyy tasty and it's hard to find that in the city! As an update.. If you come in and do a yelp review, you get a prize...

195,Russell B.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",298,199,415,3.0,11/9/2013,"Black Burger is a small burger shop located on a small island offline canal street. If you're ever on Canal and in the mood for a tasty burger this place will satisfy. They advertise 100% Angus meat, and although I'm not a fan of Angus, the meat was tasty nonetheless. They also have Calamari Fries, which seems a little odd but it wasn't bad at all. This place seems to have mystery items on the menu as I had no idea they had ""curly"" fries, but when I saw them making it in the back and asked about it, the lady behind the counter confirmed. So if I ever go again, i'll try to ask for something special.Black Burger has a humorous decor. On the walls you'll see ""Get 2 Burgers for the Price of 2 special!"" and ""Vladimir Puttins favorite burger place!"" Black Burger has a lot of variety, and is def worth a stop by if in need of a burger off Canal.",2,,
