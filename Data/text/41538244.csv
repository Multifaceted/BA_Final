0,Richard W.,"Ardsley, NY",6,123,92,4.0,11/3/2018,This unassuming bar is actually pretty nice. Kind of run-down however has a homey feel to it. I got basic for food. Hamburger brioche bun with perfectly cooked bacon. They gave me the choice of Chipotle ketchup or regular ketchup prize for season 2 perfection. I got a Craft Ale. Very affordable compared to the bars in the area,,,

4,Ally B.,"Manhattan, NY",13,210,482,4.0,2/5/2018,Solid local bar with great deals on food and drinks.  Their wings were among the best I've had in the area and were amazing enough that I'd go back just for that.  The service was a little spotty so that is why I can't call this a 5- star experience.  I will definitely bc back regardless to try their other food items.,,,

8,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,4.0,5/30/2017,"Cool little bar in Murray hill, I stopped in for happy hour on Friday, which is 4-7 PM. The ambiance is chill, a lot of locals based on the rapport with the bartenders. The music is a tab all over the place, but it doesn't really matter if you're in there you're mostly likely chatting with the people and/or person you're with or those around you. The bar itself is a rectangle with seating all around and there seemed to be 2-3 bartenders working the decent size crowd. I ordered chicken tenders and potato skins with my drinking buddy and they did not disappoint. The chicken tenders were super crunchy and the breading was not your typical seasoned breading, I thoroughly enjoy them. The skins were loaded and not like most bars who try to pass off microwaved apps, they were a bit more on the fresher side. A great little spot for HH and apps, not a party spot, but for some drinks it's a great starting point.",2,2,1

Updated review","Having been back to Bravest a few more times since this original Yelp, and having had such a nice time with friends and their offered up fare, I felt a quick update was in order.  Since that visit I have come back and tried a few different variations of their chicken wings, their fried pickles and a couple of different burgers.  Good stuff for sure and filling.  The staff remains friendly and the overall vibe is welcoming which is never a bad thing.  While it might seem out of the way if you are up closer to Broadway in our fair metropolis, this is a short enough wander from Grand Central Station if you are looking for a good place.  Thanks Bravest.  Keep it up.",,,

12,Doug K.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",9,12,3,1.0,4/7/2018,"The service was as bad as the food selection. My wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch and since it was fairly empty we let our waitress know when we needed to leave by. Our food was brought out 40 minutes after we ordered at the exact time we said we had to leave by. Not only did our waitress show no sense of urgency, she also brought out or appetizer after the main course. Other than the corny fireman theme, this place has zero charm or character.",1,1,
13,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,4.0,4/6/2016,"Like the country song that so seemingly fits Bravest, ""I love this bar"" should be their motto. Bravest has many great qualities of a local watering hole with a small town feel, located on Second Avenue.*Completely Without PretenseBravest is no frills all the way. It's super casual where people can come to just be themselves. Don't come here on a non-Tinder first date.*Great Happy HourRegular prices at Bravest are on the low end but their happy hour prices are even lower. Couple three bucks for beers and well, like your upstate college alma mata*Bar Food and Table ServiceTheir food and pretty good! Not healthy by any means, but tasty for sure. Nachos, tater tots wings etc, coupled with a wide variety of beer. That's my kind of Thursday night dinner, right there.Great spot!",3,1,3
14,Holly S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",110,160,116,2.0,1/18/2017,"I have some conflicting opinions about Bravest, but I can't in good conscience give it more than 2 stars. If you're looking for cheap beer and wings on Sundays during football and have low expectations of service, then by all means head over. Otherwise, definitely avoid it.On Sundays (at least during football season), draft beer is $4 and wings are 50 cents. The beer selection is decent and the wings are good. They have quite a few TVs and play most of the NFL games. There are two female bartenders who are awesome and do their best to make up for the poor service provided by some of the other staff. This is where my compliments end.I've tried both the veggie burger and the beef burger and they're both super bland and not good. Since, then I've just stuck to the wings. My biggest complaint is about the service. One crazy busy night I was sitting at the bar and two older male staff members were barely doing anything and were drinking behind the bar while one female bartender ran around and worked her butt off to serve everyone. I believe these guys may be managers or owners and it was absolutely inexcusable how lazy they were being on such a busy night. Other times I've been sitting at a table when the place wasn't very busy and the waitresses came by so infrequently that we started going up to the bar to get drinks. Again, really inexcusable. There are plenty of better sports bars in the area.",7,,
15,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1144,813,4.0,4/10/2016,"A no-frills, no-nonsense sports bar in the Murray Hills neighborhood.We stopped by for a fourth meal and some drinks since we were in the area. We'd walked past this place a couple of times, but were directed back thanks to our fellow Yelpers. At 8PM on a Wednesday night, the bar area was much fuller than the dining area, which was fine for us since we wanted a table.  The menu is typical bar fare. We ended up splitting the 'Bravest' burger because we wanted something a little more special than just a regular ol' beef patty but not too fancy either. With just a few extra toppings (mozzarella, carmelized onions, and mushrooms), the Bravest fit the bill. The bun was drier than I would have liked and the fries were a bit soggy (and we had mostly end bits), but I still ended up eating everything anyway. Noms. I also ordered a Kentucky Mule, which turned out to be light and refreshing!  Three stars for the food, and one additional star for the service. Our server was super sweet and personable. She definitely made our visit extra enjoyable!PS. Whoever made the executive decision to leave butcher paper and crayons out on the table in a bar (for the adults, I'm assuming) is a genius!

I didn't even realize it was a fireman's pub until I stepped inside. The theme is fluid and nice. I was interested in the background of the bar and even read about some of the history online. Very interesting given the name and how the meaning has only intensified and deepened since the 9/11 attacks.For food I ordered the Hot Dawg and it was spectacular . Just the right amount of weird and kick to create a wonderful meal. I also ordered the special which was potato egg rolls with a salsa-ish spread on top. This wasn't very good. It was bland and odd as an egg roll. I appreciated the idea, but it just didn't execute well.Either way, I wasn't overly impressed or unimpressed. I'd come back again. 3/5",2,,

30,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,1.0,7/18/2014,"Let me start off by saying save yourself the time, frustration, disappointment, and money by AVOIDing THIS PLACE altogether!I rarely hate a bar, and rarely give a place a single measly star. My girlfriend and I were roaming the streets of NYC in search of a drink and a bite to eat. Just wanted something to hold us over until dinner and didn't want to spend too much money. So we stopped into Bravest when we saw the menu. They had a decent draft list and an Ok menu so we ordered the Ground Pork Sliders and Turkey Arugula Wrap. The waitress was super nice. She took the order and that was that. 40 minutes later we still had no food. Now let me tell you we stopped into this place at 3 pm on a friday. There were a total of 4 other customers in the entire bar. So this should have been a 15 min wait max. There were 2 bartenders and 3 cooks in the kitchen. When we asked where our food was she said she had mistakenly put the order in the POS system but the printer was offline. Hence our food was never made. Finally, after 45 mon our food came out and it was gross. The sliders were 3 measly little burgers on a plate. No garnish. Nothing. They were supposed to be spicy ground pork sliders. They were frozen mini patties with some crappy sauce on them. Disgusting. The wrap was whatever. I could have made a better wrap in 5 min using the random things found in my kitchen. Overall the food was heinous. Me and my girlfriend both felt sick after eating it. To top the whole thing off, right after we got our food, one of the guys standing at the bar asked the bartender where his food was. It had been 30 min since he ordered so he asked for it to go since he had to leave in 5 min. The bartender/waitress said she would check on it. She came back a minute later and said it was going to take more than 5 min to finish the ordered. One order for one person was going to take over 35 min in an empty bar?!?!?! Absurd. He cancelled the order and walked out. Overall this is one of the worst bar experiences I have ever had! Period! This place should be demolished with a tractor. Its too bad too because the theme of the bar is really cool. But the food and service is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life!Stay far from this place!",11,1,

But I finally got my chance late one recent Friday evening and now I wanna come back ALL THE TIME.Some friends and I arrived around 11 p.m. hungry, in need of AC and down for a beer or two. All our needs were met immediately, as we got some cheap brews and apps from a super friendly waitress. Beers are well-priced, apps were tasty, and I'm gonna need to come back for that crack sandwich. The best part about this place though...was the night pie.What is night pie, you ask? Let me explain. According to our sweet server, the owner is an astounding baker and cooks up some treats for the menu every once in awhile. We were fortunate enough to score a few slices of pie (coconut custard and chocolate pecan) on this particular day...and every bite was a-maz-ing. Let me tell you, there are few better things than eating a $5 slice of pie with a cheap beer at midnight. The music/ambience are great as well, and if I am forced into this area again I'll just simply stay put at Bravest.",2,,1

Wasn't super impressed with the bartender (hubby was ignored a few times and he wasn't at all chatty or friendly), but he was working it all by himself and there were a lot of people he was trying to keep up with, so I won't be too hard on the place.

62,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25525,4.0,5/1/2013,"It's been awhile since I've last been here, location wise I'm not in this neighborhood often especially now that I don't work by Bryant Park - at least I was closer then than I am now smack in between the fuzziness that is Columbus Circle and Hell's Kitchen.The Bravest is a bar that pays vigorous tribute to the truly bravest of the brace - no, NOT cops (don't get me started on my feelings regarding corruption, racial profiling, stop & frisk and how they think they can hit on women and it's cool) - FIREMEN. It takes an insane amount of courage & dedication to go into situations where there are fires, flames, lots of smoke and keep levelheaded while saving people. Firemen can't discriminate, shoot, abuse or beat the sh*t out of a fire - fire don't play and firemen deserve more recognition then they generally get...This bar has a lot of NYC Fire Department paraphernalia, interesting pieces and relics that all tell a story of their own. Aside from being a super awesome theme'd bar, I fondly remember their happy hour which nearly took me aback as it's something more known to divvy joints on the LES or in the West Village - $2-3 well cocktails and $2-5 apps?! I've had their penne alfredo here - this isn't a 5-star Northern Italian restaurant (as if 'alfredo sauce' is even considered to be authentic Italian, lol) but for a bar it was DAMN GOOD. As are their wings, really great wings and I remember fries being pretty on point as well.I've definitely spent some time here for a few St. Patrick's Days with friends when it's had the misfortune of landing on a week day. I've never stayed too long because St. Pat's ends up becoming a ""bar hop"" type of night, but it's still fun and hopping for holidays like that and even when it's just a regular night. I would say that an overwhelming 80%+ of the people there are folks that are 'regulars' judging from their relationships with the bar and server staff.Bravest isn't the kind of place I think would be contusive to make an entire night of, but it's great for meeting up with friends before heading elsewhere or making a weekday 'after work' happy hour with someone to catch up with in a casual, no frills kind of setting. I mean what's not to like about cheap tasty booze and food?",1,1,

Most places have specials that end at 6 or 7pm, but Bravest has happy hour specials in addition to the cheap beers sold all the time. Its also a bit of an off-the-beaten path happy hour in relation to the other jam-packed/sloppy locations nearby like Turtle Bay or McFaddens.I've been here twice and never waited for a table although the bar area always looks crowded. The noise is at a decent level so you can have a good conversation with your table or get a little raucous...whichever you prefer. The crowd is a bit more mature than the college age which is nice when you're in the mood to relax and enjoy your beer without getting trampled.The bar menu is pretty standard with a good variety of choices (burgers, wings, wraps, appetizers) and inexpensive prices. I had the chicken fingers which were excellent. My friend also highly recommended the wrap.I'm not sure if I would give Bravest 4 stars without the $2.50 Bud Lights all the time, but its a nice neighborhood bar that I see myself frequenting when I just want to pop around the corner for a cheap drink.",2,,

But nachos shouldn't be a plate of circular, overly salty corn tortilla chips, with a layer of hardened cheese over the top, and two little plastic cups on the side.The fried food was fine, as it's *really* hard to screw up mozzarella sticks unless you're trying.

The caesar salad I ordered tasted fine but it was basically just lettuce tossed in dressing underneath grilled chicken.

It was probably 25-30 minutes wait for a chicken sandwich and some fries. The fries were cold and the spicy chicken sandwich was not tasty.

Still, I enjoy my time at Bravest.  They have a digital jukebox and people play random songs which make it fun.  There are lots of TVs around to catch sporting games.  And it's a good neutral spot to meet friends who live in the neighborhood for pre-drinks before heading out to the next spot.",,,

The bartender was very attentive and kept on checking up on us. There wasn't a DJ but there was a juke box that this group of girls kept a queue. There are 3 tvs that played all sports from what I remember and we sat at the bar. It wasn't quite divey but the people who were there gave off that vibe.

The bartender just straight ignored me and my other girlfriends at the table and flirted with our dates.

130,Patricia G.,"Orlando, FL",345,420,841,2.0,12/8/2014,"Well if you're looking for cheap drinks and some specials on football Sundays, then I guess this is your spot. It can get pretty rowdy to the point where sitting at the bar can be pretty frustrating to communicate with bartenders. It seems that the bartenders pay attention to the regulars only and it took me a couple minutes to be able to put in my drink order. Since the keg line had air in it and it took a while, the bartender was generous enough to give it to me on the house. He was so nice about it that I feel bad to ask for a new glass later since mine was really dirty. We wanted to order something to munch on and that took a couple more minutes just to get their attention. The mozzarella sticks were okay, nothing fancy. They were also offering a $.50 wings special because of the football games. In summary  what I'm trying to say is that if you're looking for a great fine dining experience you won't find it here. This is a typical locals drinking spot with okay cheap food for a New York City standard. I gave it a low star rating because of how long it took me to order things at the bar.",1,,

Hey don't have a juke box if you don't want to hear music! I put on the classics like Bob Seger and Starship. Everyone likes those songs. I felt like I was in hell, being forced to eat broccoli, listen to rick roll musics and getting a pineapple shoved up my you-know-what. I will never go to this place again, because guess what...

They hand write all their orders and drink orders still both at the bar and with table service. We went in and ordered dinner table service for the three of is. Perhaps the waitress was not listening but I ordered a soup and a salad and she even confirmed with me on what dressing I wanted. She then went on to take my husbands order and our friends. Our drinks came out, then followed by my soup. Then out came out friends entree which I thought was weird. My husband then decided to ask about his meal. She said he never ordered anything so he re-put his order back in. 10 minutes later his meal came out but my salad did not. It was just a salad. I kept staring at the waitress each time she walked by hoping she remembered to grab my salad out from the kitchen. 10 minutes after my husband and his friend finished their meals, I'm still salad less. She came over and said to me your salad is on its way (I wasn't even hungry by then). 10 minutes after she said that I just asked nicely if she could just take it off the check. I wasn't hungry, my table was already done eating and a big part of me felt like she didn't even get my order in originally and forgot. She told me they ran out of avocados and had to run up the street to get them at the store and that it was coming soon. After a few minutes she came back and said she would take it off the check and handed us the check. I was fine with that but since they hand write their orders on the check I noticed that she originally took all the orders down on every other line and then noticed my salad written back in between my soup and our friends entree. I'll come here for drinks again at the bar but the waitress didn't even take accountability for her mistake and blamed it on an avocado. Seriously?",2,,

155,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,28,0,4.0,4/11/2012,"So I have been walking by this bar for almost four years now and have always meant to stop in. The heavy smell of fried food that knocks Lu in the face as you pass by has always been a bit of a deterrent (don't get me wrong, I really love fried food). After finding out that they serve fried pickles, I knew I had to check them out, so we wandered in on a Saturday afternoon for a couple drinks and some snacks. Upon entering, it was a little shocking because the place was completely empty. I mean not a single person. There was a bartender standing off to the side looking at her phone and we actually asked her if they were open, just to confirm. Started off with some Bud Lights, and for $2.50, what a deal. I don't know where else in the city you can find something like that. We got some menus and I ordered the fried pickles. My boyfriend got the potato skins and we shared an order of chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were surprisingly good, very crispy with a nice breadcrumb coating, but not at all dried out. The fried pickles were truly awesome, probably my second favorite in the city by a pretty large margin. Not super greasy, light batter, still had that great pickle crunch - I loved them. Service was fine, although for most of the time we were literally the only other people in the bar. The decor is pretty cool as well, it's a ""fireman"" bar, so the walls and ceiling are covered in fireman patches and memorabilia. It had a real dive bar ambiance without feeling dirty or unclean. Overall, I wouldn't necessarily go there for a meal, but I thought they served nice bar food and the prices are practically unheard of in Manhattan. I have no idea why it was so empty, but I will defiantly be back.",,,

We weren't even sitting there that long honestly.  I would say, at most 15-20 minutes.  Anyhow, we still had the same beers, but that's because we had already been drinking earlier in the day, and I have a thimble bladder, so I can't just keep chuggin' beer and not have to get up and pee every 5 minutes.Overall, the bar is okay, it has cheap beers, friendly bar staff (with the exception of that lady), a jukebox, a tiny restroom and a good number of TVs to catch sports games on.  Interestingly decorated.  Other than yesterday though, this bar doesn't get too busy, it's very low-key.",2,3,2

They were mild, and I am not sure if you can order them any hotter because nobody asked.  The fries were good - more along the lines of steak fries.  They were crispy were a HUGE portion.I will definitely come back here for the wings.",1,,1
161,Jerrica J.,"New York, NY",963,1360,221,2.0,7/10/2010,"Bravest is right across the street to where I've been residing for the last few months. Its a small bar with a couple of TVs and a bunch of local neighborhood regulars. I've popped in a couple of times just to meet up with friends, or if I'm too lazy to go out and get a real drink somewhere. I would not call it a dive bar, but it does smell like one. The bartenders are OK, and I don't drink Bud Light, so I have no care for the $2.50 specials.",4,,
162,Amy M.,"New York, NY",50,30,0,3.0,9/18/2010,"This is not your typical midtown bar. Don't come expecting anything fancy. The Bravest is just a good, friendly neighborhood bar with cheap beers ($2 at happy hour, and Bud and Bud Lite are $2.50 after that). And what's not to like about that?",1,,
163,D. K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,4.0,11/10/2013,Great little neighborhood pub restaurant that never disappoints.  They have happy -hour drink specials that are inexpensive and the fried pickles are wonderful. Good wings and burgers.   It can get a bit noisy with the after work crowd but then that is the sign of a good pub!!,,,
164,Brian K.,"College Point, NY",73,33,0,4.0,6/27/2011,"Went on a Friday night with a bunch of Asians. Needless to say, it was packed...especially with white people, presumably Irish. I turned a few heads when I first entered to see if they could seat us. They couldn't initially, but for $2.50 beers, we decided to stay for at least a beer each before heading out to hop to a new bar. But within minutes, they brought over chairs from the OTHER side of the bar, past all the other people, so they could seat us between to tables. They brought us buckets of beer and treated us with respect, making sure to continuously check up on us. The only reason I don't give it a fifth star is because I wasn't wow-ed by the bar. It was average, cheap, but good service.",,,
165,Ray A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,9,0,2.0,10/16/2009,"I work not too far from the Bravest as it's called. I went there twice with a few co-workers had a few cheap drinks which is always a good reason to drink. I was blessed with social skills....I can walk into almost any establishment by myself and hold a decent converstaion.Respect to All Firemen and Policemen (non Azzholes/The Good Ones)...I'm smart enough to hangout ANYWHERE else but a Bar where Fire/Police men hang. They're ultra macho and way too ""tuff"" when they get thier drink on. - 9/11 - I walked into The Bravest with my Co-worker...The energy was so unwelcoming that we stood at the bar for about 10 mins, The Tall lanky Bartender walks from behind the bar not an aknowledgement.We both felt the negative energy and left. Pro's Cheap DrinksCon's Ultra Male Bravado atttitudes from the regularsI like bars where there's more attractive Women anyway....This bar has the usual barfly run down types....Out",,,
166,Tracy K.,"Charlotte, NC",26,97,8,5.0,3/22/2008,"I could spend hours singing my praises for this place!! I have been coming to this bar for the past two years and am what one may consider a regular, yes they know my name. The beer is cheap- $2 drafts (Bud, Bud Light, Bravest & Bud Ice) at happy hour and $2.50 ice cold Bud Light bottles all the time. The food here is more than above average bar food if you order something other than typical bar, fried greasy food. Look at the specials board, it is almost always worth it. If you are going for true bar food ten try the wings they are fantastic! They also offer an unlimited champagne brunch which I have yet to try but have seen people truly enjoying the champagne part of it. If you are around you should definitely give this place a chance, I love it!!",,,
167,Dana G.,"Lower East Side, Milwaukee, WI",0,3,0,5.0,9/6/2013,"As a visitor to NYC, this is such an amazing place. Cheap beer, amazing bartenders, and such a fantastic group of people here! Love this place!!!",,,
168,Anoop K.,"New York, NY",33,21,0,4.0,8/26/2008,"As far as dive bars go, this is quite entertaining.You can be sure on any weekday there will be a group of regulars who all know each other.  My favorite experience here was a couple months ago... A friend and I sat down and looked around and laughed cause it was the exact same people from 6 months prior.  This one man, who the other patrons call the professor, began yelling at us about how our generation is only interested in making money and not doing anything better for the world.  It was quite entertaining.The beers and drinks are pretty cheap, and once in a while you'll get a really attractive waitress.",,,
169,Babs S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,22,31,2.0,4/29/2013,"As a longtime Murray Hill resident, I have walked past this place billions of times and never went in.  Finally decided to pop my cherry and see what it was all about.  When I finally got the bartender kid to divert his attention from chatting with his co-workers, he just kind of gave me a nod to ask what I wanted to drink, got it for me, told me the price and walked away.  Um, friendly service?  No.  At least the drink was cheap because that's really the only thing this place has going for it.  I like the fireman theme, those guys deserve the respect, but I'm just surprised by the staff here.  They act like they don't get paid while they stand around gossiping which would be easy to forgive if they were cuter (and lost a few pounds).  This place seems to lack a manager or anyone who is in charge to run things smoothly.  I guess you need to be a ""regular"" or a friend of someone there to get treated nicely.  I walked out only a few dollars lighter but smelling like I had bathed in KFC.  Now I know why it took me so many years to go into this place.  And in the future I will remember to just keep walking by like I always used to.  I'll give them 2 stars for the cheap drinks and the fireman love.",3,1,2
170,John H.,"New Rochelle, NY",17,16,0,5.0,7/20/2011,"They say that Jelly don't jam like it used to, well at this place who gives a flyin F cause it is awesome. Best happy hour, good cheap wings. I love their wings, they have the perfect amount of crisp to them. Also at happy hour the wings are pretty cheap, along with the super cheap beer. This place will get you full and drunk in satisfying and sometimes uncomfortable ways. ROCK, FLAG AND EAGLE!!!!!",1,2,
171,Furyk C.,"Albuquerque, NM",328,246,50,2.0,8/18/2008,"In a time long long ago there was lightBefore the Blackness fell on Wanda'sBefore the Brightness of the Yellow exterior was coveredWhen there was happiness and joyBefore Wanda's Monlight was turned into the BravestThere were sweet bartendersand there where SWEET waitressesDeals on Wings and BeerAnd nary an A$$ho13 in sight...For some reason, since they changed the name of this place (in 2001) it has gotten worse and worse.  I went recently after a LONG hiatus, because i used to love the staff and the happy hour specials and it just plain SUCKED.  The bartenders where:    INEPT - did not know hogarden was a wheat beer (it's on tap)    IGNORANT- literally, i walked into a quiet bar and sat down at the end...made eye contact with the bartender and he talked to some patrons (fine) chatted with the waitress (OK) sat down on the ice cooler (not so cool) then proceeded to wash dishes (LAME) before deciding to ask if i wanted something      SLOW - it took the same guy 20 minutes for an order of wings that were out in 5 with another bartender     JUST MEAN - they are seriously lucky we tipped at all - no one bothered to tell us that the beer we ordered was NOT on the happy hour specials, they acted like we where peeing on their couch by being there, they ignored us on EVERY round walking away from empty glasses while doting on the regulars...LAME LAME LAMEthe great Juke box earns them one star",5,2,5
172,Nancy D.,"New York, NY",319,343,75,3.0,8/4/2009,Gotta love the dives! The crowd is...interesting. The atmosphere is whatever the hell you want to make of it. The bartenders even let some of the customers go behind the bar and pour their own drinks. A good place to pop in for a quick cheapo drink.,,,1
173,Kenan F.,"Guilford, CT",16,270,53,2.0,3/20/2009,"The only reason we went here was because we wanted to be able to get a table for 10 people and have a decent view of the NCAA games. Service was rushed and the waitresses kept dumping buckets of beer on our table without us ordering refills. The place was small and cramped, not nice at all. Food was ok. Prices were cheap but for a place like that you would not expect to pay a lot of money to hang out there. Will not be going back.",1,,
174,Meg P.,"New York, NY",29,176,0,4.0,2/11/2008,"the bartenders were great and they have my favorite song on thier jukebox. I was there 1:30 to almost 4 on a saturday night and it was a good time, not crowded, so if you're looking for a place to bring a bunch of friends and have a good time, this might be it.",1,,2
175,Nikki N.,"Raleigh, NC",40,4,0,5.0,2/26/2012,"One of my favorite spots in the city! Friendly staff, great burgers and sandwiches and cheap beers and drinks. I've had many get togethers here. My husband and I love this place so much we included it as one of our favorite nyc places for our table names at our wedding last year.",,,
176,Albert Y.,"Manhattan, NY",221,26,3,4.0,2/8/2009,"This is a cozy little corner dive/neighborhood bar that's a great value and is great for a beer or a burger at all hours of the day. You can't beat the beer prices ($2.50 Budweiser Bottles) and the food is above average for a bar. The crowd tends to be mixed but leans toward the young professional set on weekends. There are a few large tables in the dining area which can seat groups of 10+ though if it's busy it's tougher to land one. The bar staff is friendly and professional and pretty quick to respond. It's a great place to either start your night or end it before heading home (if you live in the area). It's probably not worth a special trip out of your way to go here but if you happen to be in the area, The Bravest is a solid bet.",,,
177,Danielle O.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,29,0,4.0,3/13/2009,"$2 beers during happy hour! whoo hooooooHad a few of ""the bravest"" an amber type beer that was yummy and only $2! Appetizers are nothing to rave about but chicken fingers, fries and wings are hard to beat while drinking beers with friends. The fries actually were above average but are listed on the menu as ""freedom fries."" Now, I know it's a FDNY bar and all, but seriously?",,,
178,John M.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,4.0,1/21/2008,"This place is no frills and more of a local hang-out than a NYC dive bar. At any given time you will find anyone from 20 something professionals to old bar fly drunks but it's all OK because beers range in price from $1 - $2.50 depending on when you go. Staff is very friendly and the juke box is what you would expect - 80/90s. Free WiFi? I don't know why, but they have it. And no, you don't need to be a firefighter. In fact, I have never seen one there despite the bar being loosely themed in this way. Make a stop at Bravest, you and your wallet (or money clip if you are from LI / SI) will be glad you did.",1,,2
179,Nicole H.,"Stockholm, Sweden",39,143,12,4.0,6/8/2008,"I can see how many people would like this bar. The staff is exceptionally friendly, the bartender was sipping on a corona while working behind the bar and this place is pretty much dedicated to those who served in 9/11.  The prices are cheap, the food is good, and this is a place where you don't have to plan your outfit beforehand... just come as you are. It's very dark in here, and the walls are covered with pictures and paraphernalia of firemen and various other things. They play great music and have just about every sporting event playing on their array of tv's as well. My only qualm about this place was the bitch who happened to get seated next to me.. Here's how it went down.. I was watching the Red Sox the game, and she came in here belligerently raving to the waitress that the Red Sox suck and blah blah blah. Ok, so I chalk it up as someone who is extremely opinionated in sports.. whatever. She then continues to babble that all the fans are idiots, and that the waitress should mess with Sox fans food if they come to Bravest to enjoy the game. WHAT?! The conclusion to this mess.? Red Sox won,my food was delicious and that girl is one crazy bitch.",,1,
180,M. B.,"New York, NY",71,24,0,4.0,12/14/2007,this place is great if you are looking for a wonderfully greasy bar meal and cold beer on tap.  their sweet potato fries are the best!,,,
