Didn't have to wait too long either. I did have issues a few times. I walked out once because they didn't have any tuna. On another day I wanted to try their Holiday Turkey sandwich but they didn't have some of the ingredients for it which was disappointing. One or two occasions where there were no lids for the cups and there was an instance where the soda machine wasn't on. But the food was good and the price was right so aside from those few issues its a good place to get lunch.",,,

Showboat in Atlantic City. I discovered this branch yesterday, and I think I now have a replacement for Hale & Hearty. I got the half-soup, half-sandwich combo with a half a chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and a cream of tomato soup. The sandwich at first looked super greasy, but turned out to be just right, and the tomato soup was surprisingly good. It was served already at a good temperature to eat, so I didn't instantly scald my mouth upon first bite.A pretty filling and potentially low-ish calorie meal for only $8 and change is hard to come by in Midtown, and hard to beat at Earl of Sandwich.They may not have literally invented the sandwich like their namesake, but they make a pretty damn good one.",2,,

The sandwich is delicious, moist, flavorful, and big enough to fill you up but small enough to not leave leftovers. I also had their mac & cheese, which was also fantastic. It was flavorful and rich tasting. It didn't taste like it came out of a box which is a huge plus for me. Customer service could be better but this is midtown, can't ask for too much.",2,,1

Updated review","My very last visit at Earl's was back in May and it was the first time I decided to try one of their chocolate chip cookies since I had such a craving for a good cookie.  I returned to my office and finally tore open the packaging and broke a chunk of the cookie and began to devour, when suddenly I see something long hanging out of the other half of the cookie.  Low and behold it was a long, black hair strand in the cookie..?!  I was so disgusted and too pissed to return.  It looked as though this hair was caught in the batter and was baked with the cookie as it was intertwined.  This was very sloppy and disgusting!  Earl has lost several cool points with me.  I had such great experiences with their sandwiches, never would I have believed this would happen.  Ugh.",,,
9,Karen Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,394,1571,3.0,11/2/2016,"I don't understand... what happened to the extensive menu?!?!  Or was it only in Cali that offers an endless list of sandwich options?  Well... I've been trying to complete their sandwich list for the last 3 years... and I totally did not complete this journey... bc... ""Aging"" happened! LOL I first fell in love with all the different ways they use avocado in their amazing sandwiches... then all the options of bacon, toasty vs. not toasty... all good till the last bite.  I also remember when Earl had a following... pretty sure all that carb took a toll on the digestive system.  Well... now it's no longer the new kid... it's the grand uncle... still trying to get us kids interested in its storytelling... sadly, poor Earl is no longer in its prime.  This location has definitely seen better days... but if you crave a hearty sandwich, swing by for their ""Holiday Turkey""!  It's basically Thanksgiving in a sandwich - toasted/roast turkey/stuffing/gravy & cranberry sauce! Price at $7.03 (tax included).... Service is a bit slow... so if you're a ""rush rush"" Manhattanite... skip it - save yourself the blood pressure spike! Tip: bring change or use card! Nobody likes 93 cents in change..!! Ugh! Happy ""Fast Food"" Feasting Yelpers!",3,1,1

I ordered the Holiday Sandwich.My only complaint is it took FOREVER to get my sandwich - the workers were very slow and the managers kept telling them to pick up the pace.The sandwich had turkey, cranberry, gravy, mayo, and stuffing on it. It was so good - but definitely not healthy. I had one half of the sandwich today and am going to toast the other half tomorrow.

I honestly thought they were only at Disneyland and Vegas but after a visit to their site, it appears they're in a bunch of other places.Before I go on, I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Earl of Sandwich! They were a must-visit on Vegas visits, and that only stopped when they opened at Disneyland. So, after I saw this, I decided that I must visit for lunch! I ordered my usual, the Original 1762 with extra horseradish. (Is that weird?) I brought it back to my apartment and chowed down on it. Quality is consistent with their other locations. And isn't that what matters?If I'm in the area, it's a tough call between this and Halal Guys. But I'm glad that I'm not too far from one if a craving hits me!",,,

Didn't know they had one in New York and once I found out, I went to go check it out. Of course it was the same exact earl I loved in Vegas. This is most def my favorite sandwich shop.",,,
20,Matthew K.,"Lynbrook, NY",303,238,1715,4.0,10/13/2016,"In the world of sandwiches, Earl of Sandwich is not exactly king but is perhaps the honorable duke. For those who have never been, Earl is perhaps best described as a better Quizno's. Having been to 4 separate locations, Earl in NYC maintains the level of quality and service I've come to expect but with slightly greater efficiency (this is NYC after all).Earl's claim to fame is the quality of its sandwiches. Growing up in NYC, however, where there is an abundance of outstanding delis, I would argue that Earl equates more to a high-quality Subway or Quizno's than a high-quality deli, so I choose to form an opinion about the place as a franchise rather than a local sandwich shop. That being said, Earl certainly delivers a stronger quality sandwich than your average Quizno's, but with less customization. Sandwiches are positioned more as menu items than as made-to-order sandwiches, which is perhaps the one way that Subway and Quizno's are better than Earl. Still, all sandwiches are toasted before final toppings are added, providing a more savory experience when digging into that first bite, and the portion sizes are somewhere between a Quizno's sub and a Subway foot-long. My favorite menu option here is the Earl's Club, which is essentially the equivalent of a turkey club. The Holiday Turkey sandwich is another excellent choice (an Earl classic) and can best be described as ""Thanksgiving on a sub"", complete with cornbread stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy. All sandwiches here are full of flavor and taste fairly fresh (better than Subway but not as fresh as a deli).What disappoints me about this Earl location as compared to others is the ambiance. The Earl in Walt Disney World is perhaps my favorite, making you feel like you're in an 18th century shop. This location is more functional than it is a tourist attraction, which is perhaps more appropriate for midtown. Nevertheless, the staff here is always friendly and efficient, and where this store lacks in ambiance, it makes up in efficiency. During the lunch rush, you can have your sandwich in about 5 minutes (compared to the location in Walt Disney World, where your total wait might be 4 times as great). If you're in a rush, you can also order ahead of time online, which I consider to be a terrific option!On separate occasions, I have also sampled some salads and sides here. The pre-packaged cookies here are delicious! The salads are also good if you consider the competition (Subway and Quizno's) - fairly fresh for pre-packaged quality, but not quite as good as running to your local salad place around the corner.For all of these reasons, I give Earl 4 stars but still find that the NYC location fits (or perhaps does not fit) a rather odd niche. If you're craving a high-quality deli sandwich or fresh salad, Earl won't exactly satisfy your taste buds, but if you're craving more of a Subway or Quizno's experience, I would encourage you to visit Earl of Sandwich instead. Still, I am glad to have Earl in NYC, as I love to visit when I'm craving one of their classic sandwiches!My order: Earl's Club, Holiday Turkey sandwich, Chocolate Chip CookieOther orders: Berry chicken almond saladQuality: 4Service: 4Ambiance: 3Cleanliness: 4Value: 4",1,,

I've ordered this for delivery a few times, and often the sandwich came cold - or not hot, it's obviously better when the sandwich is fresh and hot, i would recommend reheating. I've tried almost every sandwich and I love them all!Our favorite are: - Thanksgiving- The Full Montagu- Tuna Melt - Chipotle Chicken Avocado - The Earl Club - Caprese (great for vegetarians) The soups are also good. My favorite is the tomato bisque - comes with perfectly crispy croutons!There is limited seating at the actual place, but i think this is because they assume a lot of people get to go or delivery.  I think the price is very reasonable for what you get, but i can see how this isn't enough food for a big eater.  Personally, i can only finish a half sandwich, so its a very reasonable two meals for me :-) I always recommend this place to others, I've gotten a lot of my coworkers hooked, will most definitely be coming back soon!",1,,1

Aside from barking that they don't have the Caribbean jerk chicken anymore, the woman pointed out that I missed the pasta salad (which is in the fridge stand next to the door) and told me to ""go get it."" It's weird to order at the front counter and then immediately pay around the corner to the left. The seating area is pretty limited, so we ended up waiting by the register. All of the drinks with the exception of the lemonade and iced tea are bottled, but at least there is a water machine. We opted to take it to go and eat outside.

I decide to order the ham and Swiss-cheese and attempt to order a appetizer being macaroni and cheese-turns out there was no macaroni and cheese available via the female cashier. I decide to get a soup and ask what flavors were available as the top one displayed tomato flavor and the other one was not displayed-the cashier said that it should be chicken soup as she seemed unsure, I pick up the soup anyways.Once the transaction gets rang up, the female cashier takes her gloves off and balls it up to throw it in the trash can like a basketball. Then the male who is making my sandwich finalizes the toasting and then cuts in half to only to drop half of my sandwich on to the floor and says""That's the first time that happened"" as he giggles with his co-workers; It's probably not! He picks up the half and throws it away. I get infuriated when the imbecile proceeded to get a new bread with the same gloves, as I immediately insinuate and yell to use new gloves. He realizes and says ""Oh"" then rolls up his gloves to ball them up and throw them in trash as he missed and they got stuck on the order machine-disgusting. To conclude I received a mildly toasted sandwich where the cheese was not melted and the ham cold cuts was not hot and to add on, I received a warm to cold soup. I am never coming in here to eat and advise anyone to not either. It appears that this place is more a gym for practicing shots then serving great food and service.

Updated review","I've now tried EOS on three different occasions.  I'll give them a solid 3-star rating.  They have awesome customer service from the store level, right on up through Corporate.  The product is consistent, with little variation on quality/output one way or the other.  Wait time doesn't tend to be too long for in-house service.  They gluten-free soup options.  The Original (roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce) is actually my favorite of the sammies I tried.  I'd order it again, though I'm not sure I'd choose them for my work lunch option again without the incentive of a discount code/coupon, or co-worker influence.  Still, solid choice to try, especially if you're not the bodego/local deli type.",,,

I don't know how it is possible to f**k up a salad, but Earl of Sandwich, you did it! This is quite possibly the smallest, soggiest, sh!ttiest salad I've ever had. The only reason I'm even eating it right now is because it's the only thing I have and I don't feel like going out and dropping another $10 on lunch today.

They ask for your name when you order, and he noticed immediately that there was also someone named Michelle ahead of me. He put me in as Michelle 2 so there wouldn't be confusion when picking up orders. This was quite a smart move as I was really hungry that day and if my name was called and someone else were to come up, there would've been a bloodbath. And we don't want nor need that.",,1,

I have only tried 2 kinds of sandwiches so far and I like this place! The price is decent [i think 5.95-6.95] and I think it is a bang for your buck!I have tried the original and the full montague... both are practically similar with just a few switches here and there but nevertheless they are good sandwiches!I have also tried their brownies and they are pretty good too. a good lil snackaroo when i get hungry after lunch. Definitely a fan of this place now and I am glad it is just around the corner from me.Good job Earl!,1,,1

The sandwiches are great (can't go wrong with the Tuna Melt), but what sets this place apart is the price. For Midtown Manhattan, the sandwiches are very reasonably priced. The service isn't half bad either. FYI: the address says 6th Ave./Ave. of the Americas, but the storefront is on 52nd St. It took my buddy and I a long time to find this place for that reason.",,,

I got the Full Montagu and my boyfriend ordered the Italian. We both LOVED the sandwiches, but were left a little unsatisfied because of how small they were.

I had the Earl Club with turkey and bacon. This place is something of a Quiznos, making smaller-than-you're expecting sandwiches, heating them up until they just taste like hot, and throwing in buzzwords to their ingredient list like ""smoked"", ""aged"", and ""artisan"". I could probably have had a better sandwich as a midtown power deli. Oh well.

Pretty much all of the sandwiches are delicious--in particularly the Original and the Italian. If you work in the neighborhood (or are just passing by), this is a great spot. Not much room to sit, but I've almost always gotten a table--and there are plenty of outdoor places nearby. Friendly staff too.",1,,
107,Vincent G.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,49,0,4.0,7/30/2015,I have been here a few times and the sandwiches are awesome. The prices are extremely reasonable for NYC based on the size of the sandwich you get. I get the Hawaiian BBQ and the Chipotle Chicken and they're always good. Great place to go for lunch at work if you don't want to spend a lot but want to be full and have a great sandwich.,,,
108,Ben H.,"FLUSHING, NY",85,49,14,4.0,9/23/2011,"I've been here a couple times since it opened and overall, its been good and definitely a step up from Subway. I'm a relatively large eater, so this does leave me not quite as full as I could, but is probably enough for the general public. i've tried:1) the Earl's club and2) the full MotingueBoth were really good. What really makes it a standout, IMO, is the bread. I'm not sure what it is (could just be butter, cuz its greasy as heck), but its delicious. Tried the choco chip cookie as well, it was chewy, which is how i prefer it, but something about the taste was off. Its a decent cookie tho, but i'd still get my choco chip cookies from pret., or if i'm feeling rather ""splurgy"", Levain.Potbelly recently opened as well, and after trying both, I currently prefer the Earl!",,,
109,K D.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,2.0,8/10/2015,"If they had somewhat decent service, I would give this place at least 4 stars. The sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups are all very tasty. The bread is always tasty and fresh and they have a lot of options. So if you are able to walk in and pick up your order, that is the way to do it. Ordering for delivery is what takes this from a four+ review to a 2. The 2 is for the food only. The orders are never delivered on time and I have yet to receive an order that was completely right. An item will be missing, or  the sandwich is on the wrong wrap or tomatoes are left on when they are asked to be left off, or dressing is on the salad instead of on the side. It seems that they subscribe to the notion that they are in busy midtown, people will just take what they can get-especially when they have waited over an hour for for their sandwich to get there. Today I placed an order for 9 wraps. Knowing they get busy, I placed the order early-10.45am. I was given a delivery window or 11.40-11.50am. When the order was delivered at 12.15pm, it was missing three sandwiches. When I called they gave me the ""We are really busy today"" line. And this is after I hung up after being on hold for 10 minutes and then called back and asked to speak to a manager. If I was walking by, I would most definitely go and get a sandwich there but I will never order delivery from them again.",,,

I had the Italian and it was delicious. The potato chips were also very good. Now for the bad - service. Service was slow - there seemed to be alot of people working there but no one seemed to know what they were doing. Their system was down which slowed everything and I had to pay cash. While the sandwich was really good, most of the meat was in the middle so by the time you got to the edge of the sandwich it was just bread. They could do a better job of spreading out the meat. The bread is wonderful but it would be great if you could get it in whole wheat.If you like sandwiches then this is a great place to go!",,,

I ejoy their sandwiches very much but wish there would be more variety of sandwiches to choose from.  Also would like to see the ability to choose from a 6inch sandwich to a foot long as in subway.  I could definitely eat two of those sandwiches when I'm starving.  Great job guys keep up the good work",,,

115,Jane W.,"Fort Lee, NJ",5,42,3,3.0,12/18/2014,Just stopped here for lunch today. I placed my order online in order to avoid the lunch time rush. The place was a little tricky to get to because the address is the same as this big office building but it's actually on the side around the corner from TD bank. I called to get better directions and the person who answered was very helpful. I ordered the chicken bacon avocado wrap. It was ready when I arrived. I would say the portion size is decent but it wasn't that good. I ate at the Planet Hollywood branch in Vegas multiple times and always enjoyed it. This site didn't seem up to snuff. After tax and tip it ended up being $10 which seems like a lot for a wrap even in Midtown. Wouldn't go back.,,,

It is open on Sundays, which the better options around, are not. Sandwiches, at $5.99, are surprisingly reasonably priced (for midtown deli-esque food), and certainly a step up from someplace like Subway or the soul-crushing mediocrity of Bread Market or Global Kitchen. There, alas, are no fun sandwiches exploiting the supposed awesome English heritage. No rocket & prawn concoctions or other wackiness, just your standard issue tuna melts, ham & cheese, and the like.It's not the fastest place in the world, though, although this might be skewed because I'm usually here on a weekend (Sundays, when nothing else is open), and so there are not lines of office drones ahead of me.  There was one other person waiting, and it took a bit of time (5 minutes? I don't know, I'm not bored enough to time these things).  Anyway. These are not the sandwiches dreams are made of, but if you want a savory fillings between bread, are in the immediate area of MoMA, on a Sunday, and don't want to spend more than $8, the Earl of Sandwich is perfectly fine.",1,,
