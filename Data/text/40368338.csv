No regulars vibe, but everyone who came thru seemed polite. Not packed, but definitely not empty. The age range varied. I didn't game in on the pool table or darts board but I liked the choice. They have a few TVs with news & football, nothing too fancy. They have those choose your own music jukeboxes so genres changed every couple minutes. The bartender was both ""hard"" if you know what I mean & a funny guy. My friend's first time in NY & we decided on Whiskey. DON'T JUDGE US lol we wanted to appear older than we looked, which in turn didn't work out lol we had a good time! Friendly chats, even a ""makeup artist"" decided to pull out his Bare Minerals & MAC to give her a makeover (or practice hahah). We'll be back!",,,
1,Clyde Erwin B.,"Astoria, NY",348,109,28,2.0,10/6/2018,"Only came here once (for a UFC event), so if locals/regulars say it's a great bar for drinks and watching sports - maybe it is. But to have that pool table so damn close to the bar and have the people playing pool to RUDELY keep telling patrons TO MOVE, not even ask nicely - is annoying and irritating. They should move that pool table further away from the bar. It ruined most of my night to have people playing pool to expect to move when I am not even facing the pool table and not knowing when they have to use that corner closer to the bar.Otherwise the bartender was nice. Drinks were meh.",,,

It is almost becoming a unique gem in the Upper East Side as more and more dive bars are disappearing here. I can tell from coming here multiple times over the past few years that there are die-hard regulars here. It really is a great spot for some casual beers and sports watching. The bartenders and owners are super nice and friendly. Drinks are inexpensive. They don't sell food which is kind of great because you are then free to bring in food from elsewhere (like the burger joint down the block or some good New York pizza)! For entertainment outside of sports watching, they have a pool table in the back and some darts. They also sell Brady's shirts in which proceeds go to charity which is super awesome. I definitely have great respect for this place and hope that this place stays as the neighborhood dive bar.",1,,1

Really fun, lively atmosphere most nights and they have some good happy hour deals and pretty average prices. They have a dart board that is free to play which is fun and the tables are giant barrels which adds to the fun atmosphere. Kind of grimy, but again, adds to the charm/feel of the dive-y ness of it! It is a dive bar, after all! The bar tenders are all really friendly, and the crowd tends to be too! It's a pretty small space though. Pretty sure they don't offer food or anything like that. Also not wheelchair accessible! There's a small step to get in.",,,

Updated review","Chill casual neighborhood bar - divey but clean with tables and a decent sized bar area that has a pool table, dart board and  a jukebox. Bartenders have always been friendly.When I've come here it's usually been later when we want to play a game of pool. There is always  a list and it can take a while to play. Sometimes when I've come the pool players love their game and take it very, (way too) seriously - I can usually diffuse competitiveness by making it clear I'm a rookie but there are some who definitely are regulars and take their game seriously here. A typical scenario: I approach the pool table to write my name. See some friendly faces and some guys very clearly into the game giving ""the look"" as I approach their competitive arena - you know, like ""who's taking me on..."" Recognizing ""the look,"" my thought: ""ey - chillax - it is just a bar game and lives will not be lost; can't we all just get along."" My typical approach is to ask who's playing next and then ask that person if it's going to be a friendly game if we play because I'm a rookie and just there to have fun. "" It has ALWAYS  been a fun friendly game, never any drama, and usually among the best regular players are coaching me on and cheering in their cool tough way when I make awesome IPA inspired  (lucky) shots . All good - not there to steal anyone's game or thunder . They also have IPAs I like.Added bonus: one of the only bars open Christmas night.",2,1,1

13,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2242,478,4.0,7/11/2017,"a dive bar on the upper east side in the yorkville section that looks old and worn out but it has the character that i find appealing . a mix of young and old with locals mixed in the crowd .i came with my buddy who was meeting a gal and wanted me to tag along just in case she was a wacko or dude in drag . it's not really a big place but the old wooden bar is where mostly the crowd is leaving the back area which is spacious to roam with a bunch of tvs showing espn and mls soccer with a pool table , dart board and junk box filling unwanted space. i had the back area  all to myself while shooting pool and watching soccer while nursing a amstel lite beer for almost two hours while my buddy the player was trying to score with a chick he met via twitter or some other useless site. no food served but you can order from one of the many around 2nd ave and have it delivered with no hassle. listen if you are not into the loud bar scene and rather not have to deal with the bridge and tunnel dolts or the fratty bros morons like myself then bradys is your cup of tea . full bar , drinks are priced right and bartenders are friendly with the patrons . the set up inside is perfect for someone like me who does not like hanging around the main bar area and has his elbow room space  in the back with a bunch of tvs to pass the time. overall a decent irish bar which gets 4 5 stars .  p s. my buddy told me his date looked like a young sandra bullock , i don't know if it was the booze or his  fuzzy drunk vision but miss looked like a semi old barbara bush to me.",3,3,3

15,Crystal C.,"Manhattan, NY",180,137,292,1.0,10/27/2014,"Brady's Bar is a huge no no, unless you're into outdated music and watching sports games alone. My family came to town to visit so one of my cousins thought it would be cool to bar hop on the Upper East Side, more so on Second Avenue. I am more of an East Village kind of person, and I knew the bar scene here would not be as lively as my fave neighborhood.  Boy was I right. The crowd here is older, which means music from 2000, which they probably thought was ""hip."" Singles at the bar watching the game and sipping their beers. I think I saw an empty pool table toward the rear end of the bar. Bartenders eating fro-yo and serving customers. The only thing I enjoyed was my $6.50 tequila cranberry, because it was $6.50. After one drink, we decided to head over to East Village.This is just not my type of scene.",2,1,1

The patrons are truly a motley crew, plumbers, mailmen, low level petty want to be mobsters, drunks, reformed drunks off the wagon, investment bankers, traders, hedge fund managers, retired bankers and lawyers and a garden variety weirdos. A great place to catch 'the game' and not be surrounded by screaming frat morons. They don't make $15 martinis or Mojitos, but they do have the basic stuff. It fills up with the 'Bridge and Tunnel' crowd on Friday and Saturday nights, plenty of regulars on other nights. The men's room is a freakin swamp.

The margaritas are from a margarita machine (not fresh-made), but they definitely get the trick done. The sizes are good for the price, and since it was pretty much empty at the bar, we were able to get our drinks rather quickly. They don't serve food here, but allow for food deliveries. The margaritas come in ~5-7 different flavors.They also have a lot of TVs and they pretty much air every possible game that is on at the moment.

Not to mention, a chick. She was amazing. I mean, Brady's must be incredible, because she REALLY wanted to stay.. grabbing onto the bar stools, clawing at the rug, even forcing the bouncer to hold the door shut as she rammed into it and pounded on the glass to get back in. For over a half hour!This girl was incredible. The bouncer also earned the bar 5 stars in my book for actually fending this girl off without having to kick her teeth in- although a bystander attempted to round-house-kick her to the face after she kicked him in the balls for trying to help her up. (Mind you, this was after her head was slammed as the door was trying to be forced closed, and after she rolled around outside on the sidewalk screaming like a drugged up homeless person).

55,Kendra M.,"New York, NY",7,21,0,4.0,9/20/2009,"Had no idea how much fun I could have.  Usually wouldn't be my scene, but damn!- the performance was non stop and so good.  Had a blast.  Seating was limited ...but hell... we squeezed em in... and ""the more the merrier"" stood true.  Great night! Great performers!  Random song selection that brought back some great memories!  That place has not seen the last of me!",,,
56,Jon M.,"Charlotte, VT",27,379,4,4.0,10/5/2007,"As much as it's possible to really enjoy a dive bar, I really enjoy Brady's.  It's small but not tiny, never too loud or too crowded, not a bit pretentious and it's got a pool table, dart board, and big buck hunter.  I often find myself ending up here for a nitecap when i'm out on the upper east side.  Usually that ""nitecap"" turns into 3 games of cricket and 4 beers, but hey who's counting.  The bathroom is a bad as advertised but at 2am do you really care all that much?  I enjoy seeing people in a suit as well as people in torn jeans and stained t-shirts all in one place.  Not a big beer selection but, again, how much do you care when it's your last stop of the night?",,,
57,Puneet C.,"Hicksville, NY",7,407,0,3.0,1/13/2006,Good old fashioned standard Irish style bar that has bartenders who are professionals and customer who like to have a few drinks w/out too much atmosphere. Place to hangout if you want to enjoy the cool atmosphere and stay away from the loud music,,,
