0,Mitch C.,"New York, NY",3,75,1,4.0,11/8/2018,"Had a great evening At Hearth. Probably one of the few tasting menus/wine pairings that are actually worth it in the city (78pp for food and 56pp for wine). A little different than traditional tastings, my wife and I shared all 12 items instead of single portions which was more intimate. The items are direct from the menu to if there are any items you would not be happy having make sure to make it known! Don't leave it for chance Dinner was served as four tasting courses. Wine was great throughout and the pours were generous for the wine pairing. 1st CourseBeef Tartare: 6/5 by far the best steak tartare we have ever had. The addition of the raw cheddar took it to another level Market Root Vegetables: 4/5 nice and fresh Japanese Sweet Potato: 3/5 just didn't do it for me2nd Course:unfortunately it took forever for the second course to come. Our amazing host had a ton of tables and it seemed like our pasta courses got left for a while as they came out coldPotato Gnocchi: 4/5 Maccheroni w Pork Ragu: 5/5 if it was hotWe ordered garlic bread for the entire meal as an extra side and the sauces were made for dipping 3rd CourseChicken: 4/5Market Greens: 5/5 and a nice complementPolenta: 5/5 amazing and great for garlic bread dippingMackerel: 0/5. Not sure if we just don't like mackerel but it was very fishy and couldn't eat it4th Desert CourseDonuts: apple cider and regular 5/5. Hit the spotPudding: for the super chocolate fan 4/5. My wife would go 5/5",,,1
1,Mary T.,"Knoxville, TN",1144,477,6890,4.0,10/6/2018,"On a nice cool fall/winter day, go check this place out and try their bone broth. It will warm you up and your tummy will feel satisfied from the nutrients you literally just had.  Cozy up to the bar seats by the window and watch the city keep on moving. If you dine in they always give you a tasty amuse-bouche before your main course.  It has a cozy, rustic romantic feel, and you leave feeling satisfied not just because of the food, its because of the service and because of the atmosphere.Go check it out and warm yourself up with some bone broth!  Cheers & Enjoy!",2,1,2
2,Charity S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,19,3,2.0,8/20/2018,"Oh Hearth, what happened to you? Hadn't been back in a few years but we were in the neighborhood and stopped in for dinner. The hostess was lovely  and waitress very nice (or I wouldn't have added another star). I had remembered their meatballs were a signature dish and my boyfriend typically loves steak tartare. Our food came out almost too quickly (barely had a sip of my drink). My meatballs were slightly burned and unbelievably salty (and I'm a salt lover). Not to mention, it's 3 average size meatballs for $24 (no side included and bread is an additional cost). I'm willing to pay for something really good...these were barely edible but I hadn't eaten for hours so I muscled through. Then, my boyfriend's $18 steak tartare came out and was served in a small cereal bowl with potato chips on top. My boyfriend, like me, ate the tiny mess begrudgingly. In sum, 2x drinks and 2x small barely edible dishes cost us $75...$90 with tip (we didn't want to punish the server). Won't be back unfortunately, ever.",,,
3,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",104,185,771,2.0,8/8/2018,"Came here on a Friday night as a party of five with a reservation. The restaurant had several diners inside already, and it was prime dinner hour. One of the servers came immediately and gave us all water and copies of the menu, then left us for some time. We decided on a couple of appetizers to share, including radishes with strawberries, and some vegetable appetizers. The vegetable appetizers were mediocre, and the strawberries with radishes were particularly bad. The combination just didn't go together. The pasta looked like it was good but on tasting, there seemed like something was missing to make it really great. All of our party agreed that the food was not great. It was a shame about the food, because the service was good and restaurant overall had a nice ambience. There are a lot of better Italian restaurants in the surrounding area.",1,1,1
4,Kovi K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",77,36,134,4.0,7/28/2018,"This was our second time going to Hearth for restaurant week. Some of the menu items were new, and some were Hearth staples we were happy to taste again.Starting off, they offer a complimentary smoothie shooter, which is always refreshing and pleasantly delicious. They put some sort of yogurt in the middle and it's a great way to start the meal.Since I went with 2 other people this time, we were able to try one of everything on the restaurant week menu.First course:Everything in the first course was amazing. The fennel salad was so flavorful and large. The calamari was cooked in a yummy pesto type sauce (not fried!) Lastly, the gazpacho was incredible. It was more like a soup, but it was my favorite out of all three.Main course:2 out of 3 of these were good. The meatballs we had at last year's restaurant week, and it's amazing. The ricotta cheese mixes so well and it tastes like quality meat. The gnocchi was also very tasty, but it didn't taste like gnocchi. It was more firm, without cheese in the middle. Dessert:Again, 2 out of 3. Stella's Pudding was rich with a chocolate coffee flavor and a crispy top. Loved it. The Peach Shortcake too was amazing, and it was not what I expected! It was so light, SO good. The Providence Pecorino, however, was NOT good. The bread was completely burned, and tasted almost old. Plus, it only comes with a bit of jam and some cheese: a lackluster dish.All in all, definitely give this restaurant a try. Most of their stuff is darn good, and the service is great.",2,1,1
5,Steve L.,"New York, NY",131,269,1043,2.0,8/4/2018,"Restaurant Week (Summer 2018) Review:I wanted to like Hearth - it's been on my 'to-dine' list and all, but at least far as their Restaurant Week offerings went...well, I was looking for a bit more.The service was generally fine, and I felt like myself and my dining partner\were we attended to.  I opted to start pre-gaming elsewhere given the  pricey, elevated cocktail prices ($15 per, or you could opt for the $24 wine tasting menu...which is more expensive than some of the more ritzy venues charging $15-$20. For the appetizer/1st course, I opted for the marinated calamari with summer vegetables, pickled red onion, potato, basil. This was probably my favorite dish of the night, decent amount of calamari and was well-dressed.Mains:  Opted to split  the Halibut and the Meatball entrees. The halibut was increeeeedibly incredibly salty. And I like my seasoning...but this was jarringly salty. I contemplated sending it back, but for expediency's sake, just suffered in lip-smacking silence.  The meatballs were tasty, but the polenta was rather bland for being built up as ""cacio e pepe"" style. We also ordered a side of their signature potato gnocchi with sage and brown butter - I mean, fine...but for $16 as a side, like the rest of the meal...disappointing.For dessert, we split the Stella's Pudding and the Peaches & Cream. The pudding was rich and flavorful  for sure, and the difference in texture between all the layers made this rather surprisingly yummy. I only tasted a bit of the peaches & creamed, but seemed light and delightful.I've wanted to hit up Hearth for a while. I'm not sure if it was an off night, or maybe the signature dishes weren't featured during Restaurant Week, and I really wanted to like Hearth after all the acclaim and build-up...but , at least after this first visit, I'm left a bit miffed, underwhelming, wanting, and rather disappointed in my restaurant week outing.",,1,
6,Ellen C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",180,145,925,2.0,10/12/2018,"My friends and I made a reservation on a Saturday dinner. When you walk further in, it is actually pretty spacious with bar area and more tables. The waitress was nice to answer some of the questions we had about the menu. She was courteous and helpful. she told us the portion is rather small so we should order at least two per person. We ordered bunch of entrees and appetizers and a bottle of wine. We ordered dessert later too. I couldn't take pictures of all the food that we ordered but I've attached some pictures. The two stars in giving all come from the service. I was really disappointed at the food. I can't say too much about the portion because we were warned about it, but the price really doesn't justify the taste and quality of the dishes. The gnocchi which had the best review out of the yelp reviews I can find... was mediocre at best. Meatball, pasta, tartare, garlic bread, donut, some kind of peach cake, etc. all subpar. Wine was okay. I think this dinner costed about $70 per person, and we all went to a second restaurant/bar to eat more.",2,,1
7,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,7/28/2018,"Went here with some friends to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Friday night. We made a reservation and the place was pretty crowded, but it never quite hit capacity.We were all very hungry, so we decided to split a few dishes:Garlic bread (3 stars): I was hoping this would be super garlicky and hit high flavor marks, but it was a bit underwhelming.Fava bean salad (4 stars): This was actually one of my favorite dishes of the night as the salad was super fresh and quite tasty on top of the grilled bread.Smashes cucumbers (4 stars): This was one of the specials of the night and was a quite refreshing and flavorful starter.Monkfish (4 stars): This was a well-cooked dish that was a decent size. The black garlic and broth really came together well with the fish.Pork milanese (4 stars): This was another one of my favorite dishes of the night as it was cooked perfectly and had a nice texture and flavor with the garlic breadcrumbs. Whole grain maccheroni (3.5 stars): The ragu was very good--but the dish seemed pretty one-dimensional overall.Old-fashioned donuts (3.5 stars): This dessert was decent, but nothing to write home about. A decent size to split, but nothing you definitely have to order.Overall, this place served up some super fresh and tasty food. While nothing really blew us away flavor-wise, everything was quite solid and was well-balanced. The service was friendly and attentive and the chilled pinot that we shared at the table was quite pleasant. Definitely a bit on the pricier side for East Village, but it's easy to see why it has been such a mainstay.",2,,2
8,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",961,976,2710,4.0,2/6/2018,"I have to admit, dinner was great and for a restaurant to be opened for as long as Hearth has and to still produce a quality product really amazed me. They could have easily become complacent and the quality would have suffered but not here, it was like a well oiled machine from the food to the service. I would highly recommend Hearth for a bday dinner to a romantic evening to just a casual night out. The restaurant was dimly lit and I really enjoyed the comfy and relaxed atmosphere. Chef Canora, I have heard of you for a long time and I am glad that the restaurant was crowded on the Thursday night that my group went and I am glad that the dinner was as fantastic as it was.The food: Potato Gnocchi- Sage butter, parm. Oh my goodness was this dish good! This was one of the favs of the table and it was so damn good. It was a homemade gnocchi and it was so perfectly light and cheesy. Drool. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Chicken Liver Pate- Shallot & cranberry agrodolce, grilled bread. I enjoyed the pate, the pate itself had good flavor but I really loved the super smooth texture of the pate and the bread that they used, I think it was made in house, was excellent. The bread paired so incredibly well with the pate. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Mushroom Trifolati- Gremolata. The mushroom dish does come off a bit simple but wow, were these mushrooms cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed the mushroom combination that they used. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Grass-Fed Beef Tartare- Pecorino, salsa verde, potato chips. I really enjoyed the flavor of the tartare but I did find the dish to run a bit salty. I also thought the big hunks of pecorino were a bit too intense in flavor, they kinda felt like cheese bombs going off in my mouth. The idea of using potato chips is something I have never seen in a beef tartare before and honestly, I am not sure if the potato chips were a good choice. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Whole Roasted Fish of the Day- Roasted potatoes, fennel, red onions. This was a large portion dish and the fish of the day was Black Cod. The Black Cod was cooked perfectly, the cod came out super moist and flavorful. I really loved the roasted potatoes since the potatoes had a nice crunch, the fennel was cooked really well to the point that they came sweet. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Garlic Bread- Grass-fed butter, garlic, lemon, parsley. This was the only dish I didn't care for, and it was the one that I thought was going to be a easy homerun. My friend Liz L, thought it was a good idea to order it since she likes to over order and the dish came out weird. The homemade bread was nice but the dish came off very lemony without a good garlic flavor. You could smell the garlic but the flavor was not there. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Apple Cider Doughnuts- Apple butter, crème fraîche. The doughnuts were heaven!. They were the perfect dessert, they were not too sweet and I loved the exterior crunch and the really moist interior. For me, the warm doughnut by itself was perfect, I preferred it without the crème fraîche. Order a whole order for yourself, thank me later. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",16,9,12

We tried a number of dishes including Garlic Bread, Potato Gnocchi, Pate, Beef Tartare, Mushrooms, Black Bass - Fish of the Day, and Apple Cider Donuts for dessert. I really enjoyed all the dishes especially the Potato Gnocchi and the Pate both were my favorites of the night and I would totally order them again! Apple Cider Donuts was delicious!

10,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",144,243,151,3.0,1/4/2018,Came here to end 2017 with a delicious meal and this place didn't really meet up to expectations. We ordered from their New Years Eve menu since that was the only option. It was $88 for 4 courses and on a regular day it's usually $80 for 7 courses.The first course was the best course of the 4 and it was the soup and the beef tartare. Everything was well seasoned and balanced. As the next two courses arrived we were disappointed to find that the food was overly salty from the risotto to the scallops and chicken. I did appreciate that there were 5 scallops in the 3rd course since most places will only have 3 scallops in their dish. The last dish was dessert and I got the apple tart which i didn't even finish. The puff pastry was not flaky and seemed stale like it's been sitting out for over a day. Although the ambiance and service was amazing and deserves a star on its own the food fell short and was only 2 stars for me.,2,,
11,Crystal Z.,"Elmhurst, NY",329,175,332,3.0,1/3/2018,"Came to Hearth as a party of three to have the NYE prix fixe 4 course dinner. After researching a few locations with NYE prix fixe dinner, we decided on this $88/pp farm to table menu with a little bit of everything we liked. We really thought we would love Hearth, but the food was disappointing and not worth the price. The food is probably a 2.5 stars but the service from our lovely waitress is a plus. For starters, we ordered the Japanese Sweet Potato Soup and Grass-Fed Beef Tartare. We all agreed this was probably the best out of all the food we had that night. The sweet potato soup was rich and creamy paired with a dollop of labneh, and sprinkled with some pickled cauliflower and horseradish (I enjoyed the acidity though my friend was not a big fan). The flavors worked well together and was very satisfying for a cold night. My friend ordered the beef tartare with raw cheddar, salsa verde, topped with some potato chips. It was plated in sort of a loose salad-style instead of the usual packed-together presentation. No complaints for our appetizers!For our mid course, the three of us got all the options. I chose the Whole Grain Tagliatelle with wild mushrooms and fontina fonduta. This pasta dish is heavy and filling. Very delicious on the first bite but the saltiness of the cheese sauce is just too much after three bites. I found it difficult to finish the dish. We also knew it was a problem when we had to chase our food with water constantly. Yikes.For my main course, I decided to get the Smoked Chicken Breast with sunchoke, kale and cranberry. I liked the smokiness and tenderness of the chicken breast, which was well seasoned on its own. The kale, sunchoke and the juices at the bottom of my plate was very salty. I had to leave all the kale behind because they were just soaked and super salty. The pieces of potato chips on top added a nice touch of crunchiness and helped with the overall salty dish. My friends got the Roasted Sea Scallops, which I preferred over my smoked chicken breast. There was a generous portion of sea scallops and all 5 of them were well-seared and meaty. However, it was still too salty for our taste. These would have been great dishes if not for the over seasoning.Last but not least, dessert. We got the Apple Tarte Tatin and Stella's Pudding. The Apple Tarte Tatin's rum raisin caramel flavor was delicious, but the pastry was a letdown. My friend and I both struggled so much with the pastry which was chewy and hard to cut into with our spoons and forks. The candied cocoa nibs on top of the pudding was difficult to eat and rock solid. Really not satisfied with the meal we had that night and expected more considering the price. It's a shame because the restaurant is beautiful and has great ambiance for dinner.",1,,
12,Rene B.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,342,798,4.0,1/26/2018,"Loved this place.  Very intimate and inviting atmosphere- perfect for a date or cozy gathering of friends.  While it gets crowded you never feel rushed.  Went here during restaurant week and the food was fantastic.  We almost didn't order the pasta until the waitress said they were known for it.  It was delicious!Roasted Pork belly- good portion and melts in your mouth.Escarole Salad with walnut and pear - light and flavorful. Cod Fish with chickpeas and kale- beautifully presented and tasty.Fusilli Pasta-this was amazing!  And that surprise crunch from the bread crumbs was a reason to come back here again!!!For dessert we tried all 3 - cheese plate (more crackers please), toffee cake (yum) and Stella's pudding which was amazing!!!",,,
13,Christina B.,"New York, NY",284,257,760,4.0,1/14/2018,"Hearth boasts market-driven cuisine and items are small and meant to be shared. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday but the bill still rang up a bit higher than planned with the quantity of items we got. I also noted in my reservation to put a candle on dessert as it was his birthday and they forgot, despite ordering dessert. They called me about 20 minutes after to apologize but it was too late at that point. Would definitely come back here for the pastas - the gnocchi was our favorite.",,,
14,Gregorio C.,"Bronx, NY",91,78,57,5.0,1/3/2018,I love the level of sophistication at this place. Came here for a New Years Eve dinner where they offered a 4-course prixe fixe menu that didn't disappoint. Our waitress was really upbeat and responsive and the rest of the wait staff were so cohesive filling in each other's gaps when they popped up. The food was delectable with my favorite being the scallops.Left tender and seasoned so well making the most of the buttery texture the scallops already possessed. Dessert was so fine.  A chocolate parfait with cocoa nibs that were a perfect blend to the already high quality and delicious chocolate already in the dish. See a return in the future for brunch.,,,
15,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,4.0,4/8/2018,"Love the vibe and the food is pretty great too. Hearth is great for group dinners as well as dates - it's very dimly lit and romantic. Not too loud, not too scene-y, just good food and good service.The menu here has tons of options and having tried quite a few dishes, I think the veggies here trump the meats. Favorites include the buckwheat gemelli with mushrooms (so rich and flavorful), the gnocchi, the garlic bread (sooooo buttery), and the purple kale sprouts (describing it wouldn't do it justice, it's such a lovely vegetable preparation you just have to try it). On the meat side, the calamari and broth are solid, and the ricotta meatballs are only okay. The service is really good here. The waitresses are super knowledgeable about the menu and helpful, and not too pushy. The dining style is more sharing-oriented and the food comes at a good pace so you can enjoy every dish. This is definitely going to become a go to spot for comforting but unique Italian food.",1,1,1
16,Gina S.,"New York, NY",9,14,10,5.0,8/29/2018,My friend and I were taking a nice staycation and decided to try out the Chef's tasting menu at Hearth as part of the adventure. We sat in the chairs basically in the kitchen and it was an amazing experience. Everything from the appetizers to dessert was delicious. Wouldn't trade anything but I could for sure eat the beef tartar and donuts everyday. The chef was really cool and provided a great experience. Will definitely be back!,,,
17,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,7/31/2017,"3.5 stars. Man, I really wanted to love Hearth. Healthy menu, emphasis on vegetables, lots of good sharing options. But it was just okay. Considering its popularity and its prices, I expected a bit more. Some dishes hit the mark, but most were just a little off in some way. Nothing egregiously bad, but nothing standout. As expected, the vegetables--though kind of sloppily done at times--were the highlight of the night. Proteins were decent but fell short of expectations. Definitely still good enough to give it a second chance, though.Came here at 8:30 on a Friday night with my parents. The space itself is beautiful. Fairly spacious but still warm and intimate. Lighting was bordering on too dim. Pretty versatile spot--viable for a meal with family, a group of friends or date. If you're health-conscious like I am, this worthy of looking into. Hearth makes a point of using local, seasonal and fresh ingredients with high-quality meats (from farms that treat their animals WELL) and sources of fat. Definitely a philosophy I can get behind. Sadly, I'm not drinking alcohol these days. It's temporary, but still upsetting. That said, I can still highly suggest ordering some drinks while you're here, if my parents' experience is anything to go by. My dad with cocktails for the evening. They had a special cocktail this night with some kind of cutesy name, which enjoyed very much. My mom went with the Riesling flight that Hearth offers (the only flight available here), which she also enjoyed. Serious bang for your buck here--pours here are very generous. Most wine I've ever seen distributed in a flight. My dad also ordered a glass of red as our food started arriving, which was also filled graciously. Take note of this!Our waiter, though friendly, was a bit off-putting. He roasted me for not ordering alcohol and he roasted us for not getting dessert. A little humor/banter is usually fun and I totally take part in that kind of thing most of the time, but he was making it uncomfortable most of the time. We knew what we wanted and didn't need to be shamed for wanting something else. It made me a bit squirmy. Personality is better than no personality but only to a certain degree.Food-wise, we went the sharing route. Most of the dishes on the menu are geared toward sharing--even the entrees are on the smaller side (other than the dishes specifically label as being for multiple people). As I mentioned before, Hearth is vegetable-forward and the largest section of its menu is dedicated to them. Though a bit sloppily done, they were still the highlight of the meal for us. Eats, below:Beet salad w/ seaweed, amaranth, yogurt: B+Kind of discordant, though everything kind of bled into each other. Flavors were good but execution was just okay. Amaranth and seaweed didn't really serve a purpose. Seemed like the proportions were off.Smashed cucumbers w/ turmeric yogurt, garlic, poppy seeds: A-One of the better dishes of the night. Again, sloppily prepared (though ""smashed"" might allude to that), but the cucumbers were fresh and yummy. Poppy seeds added some nice extra crunch. Yogurt and cucumber are a great combo so nothing to scoff at there. Warm summer vegetables w/ pickled onion, potato, basil: B+/A-These came highly recommended and though the flavors were good, I wasn't too impressed. The portion was quite small and I honestly felt like I could've sauteed up some veggies to make this exact dish (if you look at the picture you'll see what I mean). A little too much oil for my liking, overpowered the veggies which were themselves tasty. Smoked Bluefish w/ corn, potato, clam: BMy parents enjoyed the bluefish but it was flavorless to me. I'm not sure what was happening with my tastebuds here. I had the highest hopes for this dish so perhaps that was part of it. The corn/potato portion was decent but that's not the star I was looking for.Roasted chicken for 2: A-Chimichurri was delicious, as was the jus. The chicken itself, similar to the fish, was lacking seasoning. I know that's what the chimichurri is supposed to help with (the lemons served on the side helped too) but when you get a solid serving of roasted chicken, I expected some flavor on its own. That said, the sauces/accompaniments were delicious and hit the mark the most as far as flavor profiles were concerned for the night.Overall, a few adjustments could've pushed this over the threshold into four-star territory. Perhaps next time!",9,3,4
18,Ian M.,"Manhattan, NY",287,38,1,5.0,4/27/2018,"5/5 this restaurant is EXCELLENT !I've come twice for dinner and will certainly be back soon. On both occasions my friends and I ordered a number of dishes to share and enjoyed all of them. Some of the dishes I've tried include:-Potato Gnocchi (SO good)-Fusili-Lamb tartare-Calamari-CauliflowerAlthough some of the dishes may read as a bit bare bones, they're all expertly prepared and rich in flavor. Hearth also offers an extensive wine list including large magnums of wine which are well suited for groups on a price-per-person basis.My first time having dinner here we were presented with a box full of artisan chocolates to choose from (on the house) as a dessert.

22,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,4.0,7/26/2017,"To kick off restaurant week for Summer 2017 in NYC, my girlfriend and I decided to dine at Hearth. We have heard great things about them and have been dying to try it. Restaurant week makes the perfect opportunities for the amazing deals that it offers. Hearth is a sizable restaurant located in the LES. They offer seating options for both inside and outside. I decided on dining outside as it was a little cold last night. The decor of the restaurant is very rustic but minimalistic and their minimalistic menu aligns with that vibe.During restaurant week, diners get an opportunity to try 1 appetizer, 1 main, and 1 dessert.Appetizer- For the appetizer I went with the marinated calamari. The calamari comes grilled and stacked on top of whipped pole beans and chick peas. The dish itself was very tasty. The beans and chick peas had a texture similar to grits and when combined with the calamari made it absolutely to die for. The calamari also tasted very fresh and delicious.Main- For the main I went with the Beef and Ricotta Meatballs. The meatball comes with 2 and is served on top of house milled polenta. The polenta reminds me a lot of grits as well. I was not a huge fan of the polenta but the meatballs were absolutely delicious. The beef was very well seasoned and every bite had me coming back for more.Dessert- For dessert I went with Stella's Pudding and holy smokes was it good. The pudding is a combination of chocolate pudding, devil's food cake, mascarpone, and hazelnut crunch. Each bite was so heavenly and had me coming back for more again and again. I told myself to stop but when I looked down it was all gone.Overall, I had a great dining experience. Hearth was a perfect spot to kick off the summer restaurant week. I will definitely be back in the future to dine with their regular menu.",3,,
23,Naill B.,"Mineola, NY",68,91,7,5.0,7/29/2017,"My only regret was not having come here earlier! If you are looking for ways to eat healthy and hearty then Hearth is your answer.I came here with a friend for Restaurant week. The restaurant week menu was a good deal for the meal. The prices here are moderate and the $42 prix fixe probably only saves you about $5-7, but I could be wrong. Still it's a very good value for the money spent. Some restaurant week menus give shitty Restaurant Week portions, Hearth is using Restaurant Week as an opportunity to entice voyeurs to become repeat customers. I will be joining the ranks of the regulars here.First off the service was great. Our server Jacqy was fantastic. We started with fermented Hearth bread with whipped lard, butter and EVOO. It is a very good ""appetizer"". The whipped lard had roasted rosemary and was very flavorful. I had the Calamari over a white bean puree. The purée was substantial and served as the perfect starchy base for the calamari sauce. I then had the ricotta meatballs with the Polenta. Polenta was fantastic. Finally had the chocolate pudding, which was layered with a thick fresh whipped cream and crispy devil's food cake. The cake was not too sweet and it was delicious. I left feeling VERY full. What stood out for me at the restaurant was the fact that every ingredient seemed to stand on its own as each ingredient was of exceedingly high quality. High recommend!",2,,1
24,Charles B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,223,42,3.0,2/17/2018,"Beautiful decor. Probably a decent date spot. Comprehensive wine list.Service was good and attentive, but too pushy on the drinks.I had the bone broth to start which was quite good, but also not special. It was what it was supposed to be, nothing more or less.I then had the scallops which were underwhelming. The portion was tiny - 3 medium sized scallops, some green apple shavings and some mushroom pieces that were the most flavorful part of the dish.I tasted the garlic bread which was delicious and presented very nicely. I also tasted the cheese stuffed meatball and found that to be much tastier than my dish and somewhat more reasonably portioned.It was not a standout experience by any measure. The value was not there for me.",1,,1
25,Kevin N.,"West Hartford, CT",58,136,67,4.0,3/18/2018,"4.5 stars.  We love tastings and a family friend got us a gift card for the holidays to try this spot.  We are from out of town and decided to come into the city to dine here and spend the weekend.  Made a reservation on OpenTable and that was easy.  I really wanted to sit at the ""chefs counter"" only 4 seats and they do not take reservations for those seats. (Not sure why, I've been to plenty of restaurants with chefs tables and can always reserve these fun seats that overlooks the kitchen) That was my only disappointment in booking a seat.  They could have easily become complacent and the quality would have suffered but not here, it was like a well oiled machine from the food to the service. I would highly recommend Hearth for a nice dinner to a romantic evening to just a casual night out. The restaurant was dimly lit and I really enjoyed the comfy and relaxed atmosphere.We did the tasting which is 12 dishes for $78 per person. 4 apps, 2 pastas, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts.  It felt more like a tapas style when they bring you all the courses together.  The food was delicious. I'm not going to go into detail about the taste, or ingredients because it could change, but the food was fantastic.  Flavorful, the meats were cooked to perfection.  Go for yourself and check it out.",,,

The gnocchi, macaroni with pork ragu, beef tartar and doughnuts to finish were favorites of the whole table. The server was very attentive and friendly and answered all our questions about the food and wine pairings. The restaurant itself is cozy and rustic, so it's great for dates and special occasions.

The music was at the perfect volume, not too loud, so I was able to have a full conversation with my mother without having to yell. Also A+ for adorably illustrated menus!!!For dinner, we had the fusilli and the gnocchi. We also ordered a side of the garlic bread, which was made in house. I found the main dishes to be a bit expensive for quite small portions, but they truly were delicious. The service was incredibly friendly and attentive. I will definitely be returning soon!",,,
30,Jenny W.,"Washington, DC",182,9,0,2.0,10/7/2018,"Only popped in for a drink and appetizer, and we were very disappointed. Ordered the chicken liver pâté and the rabbit rillettes. The pâté came covered in a really sweet jelly that made for a nauseating blend with the umami of the pâté. It was barely edible. The rabbit rillettes was a bit better, but it was very oily and we found several bones. Our service was inconsistent and one of our several waiters was brusque with us. The wine was mediocre and this whole disappointing experience cost the two of us just shy of $100. Maybe my palette is not sophisticated enough for a place like this, but would not recommend.",,,

But I also have other issues that always keeps me looking for healthier way to eat. While in NYC for the MLK holiday we discovered Hearth as a restaurant that follows Weston Price and Sally Fallon.  This approach is very clean eating with minimal additives, good fats, nothing artificial, locally grown where possible. We of course decided to try it and really had a wonderful experience. I had a great broth and some fantastic meatballs. For desert, I had 100% dark chocolate with an amazing after dinner drink that paired perfectly. The staff was great and the recommendations spot on. Will be back on our next visit to NYC.",,,
32,Dinis P.,"New York, NY",364,29,0,3.0,10/28/2018,"Hearth was okay. My girlfriend and I visited on a Saturday. We started off with drinks. Waiter was nice but didn't seem interested in educating us on the menu (storytelling). I asked for a cocktail and it was okay. Nothing amazing. My girlfriend ordered wine. Didn't like her Pinot Gris because it was too sweet. Waiter promptly brought something else over.For food, we shared. Started off with soups. Ribollita and bone broth. Ribollita was a hearty bean/bread soup. Was okay. Didn't blow me away. Flavors overall were good but it was on the verge of being too salty. Then came the bone broth. Man, that was SUPER salty and way overpriced for what it is. Definitely stay away if you are watching your sodium intake! After we went with the japanese sweet potato on what looked like sour cream (and sort of tasted like it). The waiter didn't seem interested in educating us either. Finally, the last course, was the sea bream. The fish was the star of the evening. Very crispy skin, moist interior, good accompaniments. We finished off with chocolate tasting (5). Would be nice to have a little tag/reference so we know brand to reference back if we wanted to buy. Overall, would not return. Needs to improve service and experience. Menu has this weird overdrawn story told on the back that reminded me of a fast food chain. It mentions something about their frying fat being changed frequently and not having oxidized oils. That statement evokes weird thoughts and is unnecessary. Just serve good food and people will get it!",,,
33,Mike N.,"Hinsdale, IL",26,214,215,4.0,5/3/2017,"Came to Hearth with a party of 5 with a reservation and were promptly seated. Cool understated atmosphere in the East Village and not overly loud so we easily heard each other. We were enticed with getting the 12 course but the server steered us to selecting our own dishes and then she organized them into courses. This way we got what we want rather than the kitchen deciding and it was less expensive. Wine list is heavy with French wines and lacking California varietals. My favorite two dishes were the puréed cauliflower plate and the ricotta gnocchi. Most of the table agreed. The gnocchi may have been the best I have ever had. For dessert, we shared two. The ricotta cheesecake and the doughnuts. The cheesecake was very different, basically deconstructed. The ricotta was closer to a pudding than a cheesecake. There were a few pieces of crust and a couple of berries. Not exactly what I was expecting. The donuts were like little cakes with whip cream and a compote and were delicious. Service was good.  Unfortunately, the chef wasn't there that night as he was coming back from Chicago where he won Outstanding Chef in NYC at the James Beard Awards.",1,,1
34,Mike G.,"Manhattan, NY",111,28,82,5.0,12/1/2017,"Amazing place! Ordered the tasting menu and it did not disappoint. It was great that we were able to tell them specific foods we don't eat and they were able to tailor the tasting menu to us.

36,Caroline P.,"ASTORIA, NY",90,7,13,5.0,8/12/2018,"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt taken care of. I got there a little earlier and waited at the cozy bar. As a Gin lover, I was really surprised to see ""Eden is on Earth"". The cocktail did encompass the feeling of seating at the that bar, drink my Eden and smelling goodness. The host came over to seat us at the table but we saw they had open seats by kitchen bar, where all the action was happening. If you enjoy cooking like me and my boyfriend that's where you should be. The smell is overwhelmingly amazing. It just  make you want to eat whatever they are cooking. And as a bonus you learn a thing or two.We ordered a good montepulciano to start and we were all set to rock on our order. Sea bass crudo, steak tartare, macaroni with pork ragu, potato gnocchi. Ah we saw the polenta coming out, so we had to get one of those as well. All was fantastic but I have to give 5 stars to the gnocchi. It was the lightest gnocchi I have had, it felt like I was eating clouds that melts in your mouth. Service was on point, attentive but gave us enough space to enjoy the night.Highly recommended!",1,,
37,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",418,354,3232,4.0,3/4/2017,"We walked in at 8:30 PM on a Friday night without a reservation... you should make a reservation ;) The short: we waited a while, but the wait was worth it. The ambiance is warm, the staff are super friendly, the wine list is high-end, broken down by region and gigantic & the food was delicious. The longer: we waited for a while, but ordered a delicious bottle of Rioja and sipped by the front bar. Eventually they gave the three of us a really nice table in an intimate back room (dimly lit, books on shelves). We started with the bread. I would like all the butter I ever consume to be as good as their homemade butter. Then we shared the mushroom appetizer (which was probably my favorite part of the meal), the warm cabbage salad, the meatballs (good, nothing wildly memorable) & the whole grain rigatoni in the veal ragu. The pasta is served al dente. Their red sauce and ragu were both very good. We ended with a ganache tart, which I wouldn't recommend. Overall- pricier meal, but food, wine & overall experience were awesome. There are so many things on this menu I want to try... we will be back! :)",4,3,2
38,Alina A.,"New York, NY",446,2,2,5.0,1/21/2018,"My boyfriend and I spontaneously walked into Hearth for a Friday date-night dinner and have to admit that this may be our new favorite place on the lower east side. The restaurant was perfectly filled enough to be able to have a conversation with out yelling across the table. The ambiance is full of warmth and the bar when you walk in still has a trendy feel.  There are also convenient high top tables on the side if you weren't able to snag a table.If you haven't discovered orange wine yet, I highly recommend you try it here. Hearth has a passionate sommelier who will give you her honest opinion and not just sell you the most expensive bottle. They have a large selection of orange wines which is difficult to come by. We tried a bottle of the Catarratto 2014 Sicily which fell on the lighter side of a spectrum between blood orange and lightly pigmented orange. It had a bit of a tropical hint and went down smoothly with the meal.Our meal began with a complimentary winter squash + lentil soup that had light lemon yogurt drizzle. The portions are meant to serve two or more so my boyfriend and I chose to order the braised short rib with sliced carrots and red wine, the potato gnocchi with sage butter and parm, and of course the garlic bread. My only complaint is that the braised short rib is too good to be shared! The flavor is so insanely good that if you share it, make sure you get the larger piece.Will definitely be coming back to this LES gem!",,,
39,Sophie S.,"San Francisco, CA",335,104,58,3.0,10/9/2017,"The pros: Very diverse menu with options everyone will like. Some of the standouts for me were the roasted shrimp and the potato gnocchi. Everything was cooked really well and was light and fresh. I love that they source their meats and vegetables from local vendors whenever possible. The atmosphere is also really great. I'd recommend it for a date night Needs Improvement: The food was good, but I'm not racing back. I found the texture of the meatballs to be too soft, the cucumber melon salad was covered in poppy seeds that didn't add flavor, and the menu is so large, it can be a little overwhelming.",,1,

So I came for brunch this weekend with the BF and was super excited to finally give it a try.We ordered and shared the Zucchini Bruschetta appetizer, which was by far the best part of our meal. So creamy and flavorful, I definitely recommend. However the entrees weren't impressive. I got the Grilled Ham and Cheese, which was okay but the rye bread was overly toasted. There was also no condiments on the sandwich aside from Dijon mustard on the side, so would have been nice to have some sort of sauce on there. My BF got the Beef Hash, which was decent but nothing special. Overall, it's a cute spot but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",3,1,1

They have a large selection of vegetarian plates (all were incredible, particularly the mushrooms!). I had the bluefish and a few others had the bone marrow. The restaurant is also centered around sustainability. It's a very intimate, dimly lit restaurant. Great place for a date! If you eat meat, it's a great place to take someone who is vegetarian since they'll have plenty of options and you can still have the steak, chicken, etc. The meal is not too heavy- good place for a light and fresh meal!",1,,

46,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,4.0,5/13/2017,"I have been wanting to come to Hearth for a while now given their reputation for high quality ingredients and refreshing comfort food.I came here for brunch with one friend. She was a little on the hungover side so we unexpectedly made this a little boozy and got their bloody marys. I guess they have beef broth from Brodo (the broth shop located next door) which was a little unappealing at first, but it ended up being extremely refreshing, and I think all of the vitamins and minerals from the broth were rejuvenating for my friend. For food, I got the mash which was a braised beef, assorted vegetables, and potatoes topped with fried eggs, and a green sauce. I sometimes get nervous about braised beef because it can be really heavy but this one was fresh and juicy. My friend got the scrambled eggs and greens. I always love when restaurants are able to make eggs seem creamy and fluffy without adding any cheese to them, and they were certainly successful with this. I definitely want to come back and check out their dinner and also stop next door for the Zadies oyster bar.Pro-Tip: Apparently if you get here early enough, you can get a spot at the counter next to the kitchen and watch the chefs work their magic!",4,1,2

Really enjoyed my grilled cod and bone marrow; and very interesting to have a piece of lettuce wrapping the bone marrow with the fried garlic flakes.Towards the end, our waitress was kind enough to bring us an extra piece of chocolate as they originally messed up with our pork sausage order - how considerate!

We got the bone broth, cauliflower, and mushrooms to start, the skate fish for an entree, and the chocolate board for dessert. Every bit was incredible. The bone broth was soul-melting: it was so simple, yet had a rich and peppery flavor to it (almost gravy-esque, but broth consistency). The cauliflower was in a light and salty olive oil, white wine and lemon, and the mushrooms were rich and hearty - both delicious! The skate was definitely a small portion, but the fish had a perfect crisp around the edges, and was buttery and flaky. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale that came with it, but can't complain.

56,Marcie B.,"Islamorada, FL",8,37,0,5.0,12/27/2017,"After reviewing the menu, four of us decided to make our own tasting menu for dinner. We started with the Ribollita and Hearth broth. (After all, as my friend pointed out-it is the Hearth broth-so it must be good!). And it all was.  To call the Ribollita a white bean soup is an injustice. It was an amazing combination of flavors.  It was so thick it was barely soup.  The Hearth broth was delicate and incredibly flavorful.  My favorite was the Ribollita.We went on to have the mushroom trifolati,  the purple sweet potatoes and the garlic bread. I didn't know garlic bread could be do good. The touch of lemon with the garlic was over the top good.  The purple sweet potatoes were also a surprising burst of flavors.  Each dish was as good, if not better, then the last. We also shared the meatballs and the roasted black bass. The food was all so outstanding, that if I had to pick one dish to pass on, it would have been the meatballs.  While very good, the other dishes outshined then. The roasted black bass was another over the top dish.  It was the perfect blend of flavors with little apple balls (which looked like pasta,) that were the perfect burst of flavor to compliment the fish and the sauce without overpowering them.  If I had to pick a favorite (as difficult as it is), the gnocchi was heavenly. I don't know that I have ever felt like gnocchi was melting in my mouth. The sage butter was amazing and I could have eaten it all night.  Yum!We had wine with dinner- was so focused on food, I don't remember what was drank, although we did have two bottles. Topped off dinner with the apple cider donuts.  OMG!  We had to try because the presentation was so great. Tasted as good as it looked.  Again the combination of flavors was masterful. Waitstaff was very attentive and love when they remember that I don't like ice in my water. Just shows they pay attention to details. I love this  place and will definitely come back the next time I am in NYC.",,,

58,L W.,"Seattle, WA",3,21,0,3.0,1/4/2018,"We did the prefix 12-course dinner as a our splurge night in the Big Apple. The restaurant was highly recommended and we are always up for checking out a James Beard winner (Chef was voted best NYC chef in 2017). For dinner, it was fun to enjoy seasonal produce (winter). So lots of root vegetables, cabbage, pears, and apples. We had 3 vegetable dishes to start, followed by two pasta dishes, followed by two protein dishes (one fish, one chicken), and finished off with two delicious desserts (and best dishes of the night!). The bread was considered a course which we thought was interesting. The food was good but wasn't amazing. The stars of the night were definitely the chicken and two desserts (apple cider donuts and chocolate layered mousse). Personally, I think the dinner was a bit expensive for what it was but the nice thing about prefix dinners is that you don't have to make any decisions and are always excited to see what comes out next from the kitchen. Come with an open mind and hungry! It's a lot of food!Service was sub-par but not sure if it was east coast hospitality (a little cool and passive aggressive).

A plate of mushroom was like $18 and it came with no sides. No rice or other veggies.literally just mishrooms. The meatballs were $18 and it was 3 meatballs with no pasta or potatoes or rice. Just meatballs. The menu is expensive and the portion is terrible for the price. But the food tastes really good. The servers work together. Random servers walking by us  would clear our table. Everything came out at an efficient time. We decided to go to venieros for dessert and grabbed some food from a food truck because we were still hungry. It's like a hipster place. New and cool concept. Health concious. But there isn't anything that would bring me back to this place mostly because I'm an eater and I don't mind paying more for good quality but when you're paying more than $15 for one tiny meal and it's literally just mushrooms thats a little but more than pricey, for me because I needed a little more food.

It was so close. But every, single, dish, was way too salty. Our whole table of 6 agreed. With less salt, I think the food here would really shine, but from a family that loves salty food to have this feedback, it was a bit disappointing. The chicken, mushrooms, and gnocchi in particular had a lot of potential if they weren't salt-bombs.",1,,

I was very disappointed with the quality of drinks, food, and service. I ordered a double espresso and they sent a coffee. They still charged me for double espresso. The over priced meatballs were no better than you'd get at a local Sbarros pizza. Bone marrow was less than average. The $28 Black Sea bass was actually very good. Wish there was more of it. Gnocchi and steak tartare was pretty amateur. They basically tossed salted potato chips from a bag on top of the tartare. Spent $235 total for two and feel like I was ripped off.

I feel like I've become accustomed to paying a good amount of money for pretty good food in NYC, but hearth is a different story. You must get the pork Ragu dish as well as the roasted lamb. These dishes alone were enough to seal the deal. Some honorable mentions include the polenta, tartar, and the bread (they had run out of garlic bread by the time we arrived but I assume that means it's probably Even better than the bread... ridiculous!).

Had the skate wing Milanese as my main. I really enjoyed the caper vinaigrette and cherry tomatoes that were on top of it but wasn't a huge fan of the skate. Still very good. For dessert I had the cookies. It was a journey of its own. Probably one of my favorite desserts in a long while. Take your time and truly indulge!

The ambiance was nice and cozy and the server was very nice and charming. The soup was hearty and delicious. The pasta was good, nothing mind blowing, but made with love and good quality ingredients. Great sauce.  I added the gnocchi and regretted it. I had expected the pasta dish portion to be smaller so it was way too much food. Don't get me wrong, I ate it all, but it wasn't necessary and it wasn't great. The sauce was too watery and the gnocchi was almost too mushy. But I can't not eat gnocchi that is in front of me, even only okay gnocchi.  I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars because I had sticky toffee cake twice this month and Cookshop's blew Hearth's out of the water. Hearth's was borderline dry for my taste. I expect my sticky toffee cake to melt in my mouth. (That being said it was still good, just not amazing.) The gnocchi didn't wow me and none of the flavor combinations really surprised me.  They were well executed though.

We broke it a bit last night but kept it in mind as we ordered.Last night was a pretty enjoyable experience. We had a 6pm reservation, and the food came out quickly -- we had five dishes and dessert and were out by 7:15. Note that the menus change monthly, so I'm not sure what we had were seasonal dishes or their regular offerings. Portions are small -- 5 dishes were enough for us, though, and we were stuffed when we left.We ordered the mushrooms with gremolata, the bone marrow, the beef and ricotta meatballs, the long-fermented bread, and the beef broth. The mushooms, meatballs, and bone marrow were absolutely delicious. The bread was ok, but a bit dry and not worth the cheat. The bone broth was good, but could've used more flavor. We had the dark chocolate sampler for dessert. The chocolate was good, but I was a little disappointed that it was basically chunks from a dark chocolate bar.Overall, if the idea of eating locally sourced and seasonal food resonates with you, then you will like this restaurant. i wasn't wowed, but the food was prepared well, and the dishes were smart.

83,Amanda Z.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",7,11,4,5.0,12/27/2017,"Marco, oh how I love thy.This is the FAVORITE place to snuggle up for a late dinner. The food is all farm to table, locally sourced and when a menu item is out, it is OUT! Personally, this reviewer loves that they support zero-waste in the kitchen. All staff is joyful and behave like a family with good vibes and sassy jokes being thrown 'round- All the whilst staying absolutely professional and providing the highest level of table service. The ambiance is magnetic, dimly lit to create privacy but with enough low-hanging antique lights to read the delightfully decorated menu. It would be fitting that Hear would be a loud restaurant, however as this yelper is quite sensitive to such things, I noticed that was a fine balance between the chatter of other patrons, the clink of silverware on plates and the piped in house music playing.Be prepared for a meal landing a bit on the long end, however, you will never feel forgotten about or unattended. Merely the staff at Hearth understands the delicate nature of timing, not too rushed but allowing space. Granted this is all if one makes a reservation 48 hours in advance. Otherwise, the walk-in wait time can be upwards of 2 hours, making it feasible for walk-in patrons to catch one of the many independent- plays, all while waiting for a table for 2 at Hearth. Marco, the owner of this decade-plus neighborhood gem makes you feel as warm as his restaurants' signature bone broth soup, being positively a warm teddy bear himself! On the nights that he pops, he will make you feel as comfortable as being in his own dining room, home food, and all.Infrequent visitors to NYC wouldn't appreciate how much of a treasure this place is, but I have and would bring my parents here.Couldn't recommend this place more, but seriously, make reservations.",,,

87,Ang S.,"West Hollywood, CA",201,173,307,3.0,8/21/2016,"Hearth has a great ambience and distinctive market-driven menu. Yet there are some things at this restaurant that are not quite fitting with its reputation and price range. First, with a reservation at 1:30pm on Sunday and the restaurant being 1/3 empty, there should be no excuse for nearly an hour wait for our table. The hostess said it was because we changed the number of people from 5 to 6. Really? I could find 5 different ways to arranged the non-occupied tables to sit a party of six. It's not rocket science. After we finally sat down at a table after an hour, our waiter was very nice to present the menu. By presenting, I mean he literally named and described every single brunch item on the menu with great enthusiasm. I loved his energy and help, but honestly, after an hour staring at this one page menu, I could pretty much recite the items. I would've totally appreciated it if he had mentioned something that I wasn't able to read from the menu. Then there was the wait for our food. With 5 orders of Kale & Eggs ( the dish includes exactly what it sounds like), the time it took seemed like eternity, or enough time for someone to run to the farm and pick up some fresh kale. The food itself actually wasn't too bad. The portion isn't much, but it's good for your own health. The summer squash bruschetta was the bomb.",1,,
88,Pearl K.,"Saddle River, NJ",546,164,128,4.0,10/14/2016,"I made a reservation at Hearth for a midweek dinner. The place was slowly filling up by 7 and within the next 30 minutes, was completely packed. The interior is really beautiful and romantic, with touches of rustic charm and knick knacks for you to observe while you wait for your food.Service was a little on the slow side; we waited quite a bit for water and for someone to take our order, but the waiters were all extremely friendly and sociable.Entrees run on the smaller side, unless you get a pasta and fill up on the carbs. I got the Rigatoni, which was a little salty for my taste. I also tasted the tagliatelle which was salty, as well. The gnocchi, however, tasted like a fluffy, soft dream. Definitely one of the best gnocchi I've ever had!Prices were not too insane, but if you're getting a meat dish, you may need to pick up a snack on the way home to fill up the rest of your stomach.",,,

Plates came out quickly were ok until the fish. It smelt bad- both of us agreed. But it's summer in NY and we were both willing to be understanding.

It looked cute when we got there but boy was I disappointed with the food.The Ambiance is quite cozy, lots of wood and candlelight ....the usual for restaurants these days. I call it Brooklyn-chiq. The food. The menu was quite unique the waitress came over and explained to us that everything was meant to be family style there's no set appetizer or entree portions it's just all ""food"". The menu is broken up into a few sections what I recall is looking through ""the bread section"" and ""the meat section"". We ordered the garlic bread which was just a sliced piece of baguette with garlic spread on it. My husband ordered the lamb chops and I got the steak. Sounds like it would be a hearty meal right?! Wrong. We were both hungry when we left but didn't really feel like ordering anything else off that menu so I came home and had some noodles.I think this was a combination of the restaurant trying too hard to be unique and in the process depriving patrons with decent flavors coming out of the kitchen. And, us ordering the wrong things or too few dishes. I just didn't feel like having anything from the vegetable or the grains section but I imagine if we had ordered more we would have atleast left full.The menu didn't have any poultry dishes which is odd. The meats were just beef and possibly pork. They had a chicken liver pate which actually looked nice, somebody from the table next to us ordered that. Kinda a bummer since we rarely venture so far for a restaurant and it ended up being a dud. Also agree with the other Yelp reviewers this place is very overpriced for the East Village! If you order enough to get full by you'll end up spending $200 for two people easily.",,,

94,Samer H.,"Manhattan, NY",138,168,2,4.0,2/8/2017,"I had a very great brunch here last weekend. The restaurant itself is rustic and decorated well, and they were accommodating to me changing my reservation time. We started with the cinnamon bun. It was really good and very much an ""adult"" version of the saran-wrap deli cinnamon bun we all grew up having. My only reason to rate it a 4 and not a 5 is that it wasn't warm. I ordered the traditional breakfast - Two eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. I ordered poached eggs and they were cooked perfectly. The bacon was different in a good way. It is paper thing, but they give you quite a bit of it. The flavor was that of bacon, but the texture was quite intriguing. The sausage wasn't traditional sausage, but rather, a sausage patty. It wasn't my favorite thing in the world on its own, but mixed in with the egg, it was really good!Lastly, the MVP, the potatoes. I'm not that much of a fan of breakfast potatoes. They're usually just a filler and are rather cubed french-fries or under-cooked boring potatoes. NOT HERE! The parmesan potatoes were cooked perfectly, and seasoned like crazy. Nothing bland about them. I especially love it when restaurants use parmesan as a seasoning more so than a cheese. They weren't cheesy but wreaked of good cheese in terms of flavor. Overall, this place is at a great price, and does simple food very well. In the era of bastardizing recipes and focusing on ""instagramability"" and not the food, it's refreshing to have a great, down to earth breakfast place in the area. Side note: Those coffee prices are extremely BS and slightly infuriating. $5 for a cup of coffee? Come caffeinated - that's absurd.",2,,1
95,Emily G.,"Hoboken, NJ",9,55,0,2.0,2/5/2017,"I'd reached out to a friend to grab some broth and she'd recommended this spot, so I made a brunch reservation for a Sunday afternoon. I was not exactly blown away when I first walked in, and in fact it took me a moment to figure out where to check in for my table -- the bar is the first thing you see when you enter, with the hostess stand further to the left. I was asked to wait a moment before being seated, so I awkwardly stood there for a minute while other guests walked in and were equally as confused about where they were supposed to go.I was finally seated, and took in the atmosphere while waiting for my friend to arrive. Obviously it was crowded, but did the food look good? After a cursory glance at the tables nearby, I felt optimistic. My friend arrived a moment later and we waited about five minutes for someone to acknowledge us; I made a mental note of it although I wasn't exactly bothered by it since I was in the middle of a conversation anyway. When our waitress arrived, we finally ordered -- a kombucha for myself (only later did I realize that it was *10 DOLLARS* for the one bottle), two broths, and the meatballs to share.Everything arrived quickly enough, and being as hungry as I was, I dug right in. The broth itself was tasty, though admittedly I didn't enjoy the greens and everything else that was floating around in it. I probably would've been better off just going to Brodo next door and grabbing it to go. The meatballs were also tasty, but not enlightening in any way, and not anything I'd want to spend $15 for. All in all, with tip including I ended up spending $32 which is really too much for how underwhelmed I was.I'd stopped by the restroom prior to leaving, and was a bit turned off by how dark and messy it was. Therefore, I had to politely disagree with my friend, who claimed ""this place is so adorable!"" as we were on our way out...",1,1,1
96,Jeff D.,"Cleveland, OH",28,261,21,5.0,5/16/2016,"Hearth was not my first choice for dinner this evening. I foolishly forgot to make reservations then needed to scramble to find a place. For some reason, they had a late night option available. My tardiness turned out to be fortuitous.I split two vegetable dishes with a guest and both were excellent. The Fava Bean Salad was laced with Pecorino and served over crunchy toast. The Roasted Vegetables were pea pods, peas and a beautiful seed humus tinted with lemon. People have died for baked polenta this good. Buttery, cheesy, rich, with the only side note the excessive Rosemary on the top. I'd suggest taking the spice off, dice it and toss a bit back in.Hominy-crusted pork chop! Who thinks of such creative combos? The chop was served with sausage and carrots an melted in my mouth. My guest also enjoyed the cod.For dessert, we elected to try the ""Chocolate Tasting"" which consisted of a flight of dessert wines (wide interpretation here, please) and chocolates with a variety of cocoa percentages. This was a fun, fun option that promoted lots of conversation revolving around opinions and reasons.I could not be more pleased and fascinated by dinner at Hearth. Even though we were the last people to leave on that late night, the staff was still helpful and energized. They could have understandably rushed us out and plugged in the sweeper while we finished, but did not. That made a world of difference.

98,Nick H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",346,306,751,3.0,6/21/2016,"Our waiter was very effusive in introducing us to the restaurant and described Hearth as a ""cult classic."" I understand the feel, I get the concept, but between the execution (excellent here, okay there) and price (fairly high across the board), I give hearth 4 stars (7/10 in my book).HIGHLIGHTS:-their vegetable dishes are great!-their in house bread is fantastic as well-the beef meatballs are forgettable-lamb was executed very well Charred Spring Vegetables: ""sunflower seed hummus, lemon ... 15""Pea shoots, fresh peas, beans, and some asparagus. Flavors were great, hummus was ethereally smooth and cream. Shoots were a little stringy, the char on the asparagus and beans really amped up the flavor. (8.5/10)Fava Bean Salad: ""pecorino toscano, spring onion, grilled bread... 16""The dish was about 55% grilled bread, 45% actual salad. The beans were very fresh and tender, the spring onion and red wine vinegar was very bright and zingy. The parsley flavor here is quite strong. Bread was their in house, long-fermented bread I think. Nice heft, chew, and crust. The cheese comes in little dice actually. The balance was on point and great textural contrast overall. (8/10)Garlic Bread: ...6In house bread, generously buttered and garlicked. No complaints here, same good things to say about their bread as I said earlier. Probably the best deal on the menu. (8/10)Gemelli: ""spring peas, pesto, lemon...23""This is one of the largest portions on the menu (therefore it's about moderately sized). The pesto and lemon are really the dominant flavors here, the plate has a nice mix of mellow pastel green and bring green. However, I really was unimpressed by the gemelli itself. It wasn't tender, it was just dense. It didn't feel like the nice bouncy chew of fresh pasta. I understand what al dente was, and technically this may have been al dente but it just felt very dense to me. (6/10)Beef and Ricotta Meatballs: ""house tomato sauce...22""This is apparently a Hearth classic and has never been removed from the menu. I was expecting something incredible but was mostly disappointed. The texture was fairly light and fluffy but it did hold together. That said, the flavor wasn't very beefy, yet I couldn't taste any milkiness from the ricotta either. I think the ricotta mostly contributed to the whipped texture and the beef's initial flavor wasn't strong enough to withstand dilution by the ricotta. I didn't think the sauce was anything special either, not much freshness to it, feels more like a long and slow boiled tomato sauce (which doesn't go well with not so flavorful meatballs). Also, there are 3 large balls to a serving, but would I have paid 7.50 for a single one of those meatballs? Heck no. (6/10)Roasted Spring Lamb: ""fregola, peas, oregano... 30""Tbh, I didn't notice the oregano taste at all. I don't like lamb generally but this lamb loin was superbly cooked. It may have been a little bit more done than most people would like, ours was mostly medium-well around the edges and medium rare only in the center. But I thought the texture was great, great seared flavor and the flavor really permeated the fregola and peas as well. (8/10)",,,1

I can confidently say that we didn't waste a New York meal here; the drinks were something else, and the food was truly superb. It's a little pricey, but if you're complaining about the price of an upscale restaurant in NYC, you need to get a new hobby. The cocktail I had was excellent, and all of the dishes we ordered were superb. The standouts were the mushrooms, the gnocchi, and the Japanese sweet potato. Our waitress was extremely helpful in guiding our selection of the food; she recommended the mushrooms as a sort of pairing dish for the gnocchi (she wasn't wrong; the combination worked beautifully). I also greatly appreciated the ambiance of the restaurant. It was on the darker side, but in a cozy way. The noise level was moderate, and we didn't feel rushed, even given the popularity of the place.",,,

Had the sampling menu which is 12 dishes total. They had very delicious polenta, steak, kale... everything was healthy and tasty and left you full and satisfied.

We brought an out-of-town visitor here so we were really trying to find a place that was pretty, had the correct ambiance, and most of all, produced strong and interesting brunch cocktails and excellent food.Hearth was the perfect combination. If I had to pick one thing I'd say the overall look and presentation of the food and drinks were what surprised us. Everything was gorgeous (our guest was snapping pictures left and right). An added bonus was that everything we ate tasted absolutely wonderful.If I had any complaints it would be that the staff, overall, wasn't the friendliest. But to each his own. It was a little dark inside the space, but we sat by the window so it was perfect for us.In any case, we'll definitely be back...",3,1,1

The atmosphere is lovely and the service is consistently excellent and very professional. This has everything to do with management, so bravo! to whomever is in charge of training employees and making things run. So many comparably priced New York restaurants could learn a few things about service and quality from Hearth!The food, however, is really what Hearth is all about and what makes it so unique. It is always fresh, imaginatively prepared, and deliciously flavored. The care and thoughtfulness of its preparation is so evident in every dish. Tonight we ordered and shared the following:""Cacio e Pepe"" PolentaFava Bean SaladSmoked MackerelRoasted Wild CodPork ChopSautéed GreensAll were outstanding. Truly, as good as it gets. Our introduction to Hearth took place three years ago when we tried their Feast of Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve. We have gone back each year since. Thank you, Hearth, for another wonderful dinner!",,,
103,Michael J.,"Manhattan, NY",26,1,0,2.0,10/21/2017,"we are Europeans who have lived in the US and particularly in NYC for about 20 years. I seldom write reviews but we have eaten in simple restaurants and the best around the world we have spent 100s and thousands in all kinds and despite many favorable reviews and some not I give this place a C . While the service  here was friendly and excellent the food was average at best - not Italian not American. Too complicated, pretentious  and not enjoyable, Not a single green salad type starter, very few Italian style platies, a steak that tasted like  it had been marinated in salt and overall highly overrated. The same problem as in  the fashion world - trying to be original  rather than tastefully delicious. The chef needs a wake up call",,,
104,Yan C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,1.0,7/13/2017,"My husband took me to this place for my birthday. He chose this place based on the good reviews. We ordered the tasting menu that's $75 per person. The ingredients looked fresh so we are not sure why they had to pickle all the vegetables. We had pickled cucumber salad, pickled Swiss chard, and pickled cauliflower. We couldn't really taste the natural sweetness or flavor of the vegetables.The pasta dishes and polenta were good. The protein dishes were ok. The steak was nicely cooked but it was extremely salty. It was not a good cut so they plated the steak under mixed vegetables. The cod was good but it was served with a puree or vegetables that also tasted sour.We are not professional food critics and we don't eat out a lot. We just prefer food with more balanced flavors. All we remember from this dinner was that almost everything tasted unbearably sour or salty.",1,,
105,Elizabeth C.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,144,1080,4.0,11/19/2015,"I had a lovely brunch here back in September, when it was still warm enough to sit outside. They have a nice little sidewalk seating area, which is great for East Village people watching! Plus, the interior was not appealing to me.Positives:-my beef hash was AWESOME ****(this, and the doughnuts, are the main reason why they get 4 stars)****-apple cider doughnut holes were absolutely delicious-sidewalk seating was greatNegatives:-service was slow-my boyfriend's vegetable frittata wasn't that good -his coffee and my iced coffee were WAY too expensive (we should have checked the menu first, but the iced coffee was close to $5)",3,,

It's not you, it's me. But mostly you. I've come here with the same friend three times over the past two years. The first time the A/C was broken in the dead of summer, and the second time resulted in a bout of food poisoning. Yet, we decided to make a third and final trip to see if this place could finally convince us why this place is such a big deal among our friends and the Yelp community.Unfortunately, the third time wasn't the charm. Mind you, it was our best experience here among the three, but in my mind, there were just too many cons versus pros to warrant anything more than 3.5 stars (rounded down because of our prior visits).. So let's get to it. Pros-Prime location in the East Village. Perfect if you want hit up a bar for post-dinner drinks.-Cool space. Chic, but not pretentious. -Friendly, down to earth servers. Very knowledgeable about the menu.-If you have to order two dishes make it (1) the warm autumn vegetables and (2) the gnocchi. The vegetables are autumn in a bowl. The pumpkin and squash pair perfectly with the maple vinaigrette. Comfort food at its finest. And the gnocchi are absolute pillows of heaven. Probably the best I've ever had. Cons-Arrived on time for 8pm reservation. Still waited 15 minutes for our table to be prepped.-Food took about 45 minutes to get to our table from the time we ordered.-While the fluke dish was tasty, the fish itself was just way too overcooked and dried out.-Everyone seems to swoon over the veal and ricotta meatballs. Not sure why. Fairly muted flavors. It was okay, not great. And the ""cacio e pepe"" polenta the meatballs were served on was nothing to write home about. Honestly, I feel like I could make a comparable dish at home.-The food is just too expensive for what it is. This is really my biggest gripe with this place. I'm more than willing to shell out $60+ for a meal if the food is worth it, but the quality and the flavors of the food have to be there, for the entire meal, and not for just a couple of dishes.",5,3,3
107,Kyle S.,"Manhattan, NY",18,86,563,5.0,6/3/2016,"I have been to Hearth twice now (for dinner) and had a great experience both times. The restaurant completely reflects the name: it is extremely warm and inviting. Last night I was lucky enough to try several different things on the menu: garlic bread, fava bean salad, charred spring vegetables, meatballs, chicken liver pate, gnocchi, gemelli-- and I had the beef tartare the first time I went a few weeks ago.Both the fava bean salad and charred spring vegetables are great options from the ""Vegetable"" section. I would happily order both again. If you like beef tartare, order it here-- It's excellent. Onto the pastas- I ordered the gemelli both times I have eaten at Hearth. The pasta is fresh, soft,delicious and the peas are bright and refreshing. Last night I also tried the gnocchi for the first time- It was great: soft, doughy in a sage butter sauce.What I love about this restaurant is how fresh and seasonal the ingredients are. You feel like you are eating clean even if you are eating a hunk of bread. Come to mention, the bread at Hearth is great too. The servers I have had here were both friendly, informative and knowledgeable about the menu. I had read another review stating that the service is great when you have their attention, but you don't necessarily always have their attention. I somewhat agree with that-- And that is really the only flaw of my experience. We sat waiting for the check for a little while last night before our waiter came back around-- drinks and dessert were both finished, but that is really the only (bad) thing I can think of.OH, the dessert-- The chocolate pudding is great-- cocoa nibs, sea salt, whipped cream. We also got the apple cider donuts last night as well. As soon as the plate hits the table, you can smell the apple cider and the donuts were just delicious. Overall, I would highly recommend Hearth: Great ambiance and simple, delicious, fresh food.",,,

Delicious dinner this evening.   They cook well here not overdoing things and with excellent products.  Flavorful chicory salad; tasty pasta with pork ragu and ricotta.  Also excellent polenta and sautéed mushrooms.  Helpful servers. Nice lighting. Lovely place with truly satisfying food.   The servers said that the staff meals are excellent, too.",,,
109,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",23,6,3,5.0,7/6/2017,"The short version: Happened upon it by accident, super glad I did. Sweetest server ever, ambiance is perfectly moody, and the food was on point (roasted cod, charred snap peas, peach tart, glass of aboriño). It gets harder and harder for me to be impressed by good food, but this place killed it. Did I mention they're incredibly committed to ethically sourcing their food? And they actually seem to know what they're talking about (aka they know ""organic"" does not automatically mean it's good to go). 10/10 would recommend.The long version: Randomly craved seafood so badly that I didn't care if I ate alone. The other place I wanted to go to was packed, so I just started walking home when I passed Hearth. Roasted cod was on the menu, so bingo! Good enough for me. Stepping in was the best decision I've made all week. The short list:1. I was given a small glass (think ""double shot"") of really interesting soup to whet my appetite. They do this with different soups year-round, apparently = +1 cool points.2. Tara (?) was incredibly sweet and patient and recommended an excellent wine for me. (I've definitely had servers just recommend the two or three most expensive wines on the list before at other places so I tend to take things with a grain of salt, but the one she recommended most highly was at the second to lowest price point, so I knew she was being genuine--it's the little things, you know?).3. I had no idea, but turns out their head chef, Marco Canora won the James Beard award this year for Best Chef in NYC (!)4. Not only was their food very tasty, it was very creative, as well. The cilantro-pea-and-some-other-things puree was a really pleasant surprise party in my mouth. 5. Usually, something like a peach tart might come out with a scoop of ice cream or whipped cream, but theirs was balanced excellently with a creme fraiche, making the whole dish not too sweet or heavy.On the whole, I'll DEFINITELY be coming back with a friend or two. Looking forward to how the team at Hearth welcomes and surprises me next.",,,2

Recently went back cuz I heard they are offal strong :) But at the end I opted for something light and closer to my heart - #fish. This grilled romanesco salad with smoked bluefish and sunflower seeds are light, flavorful and perfect for sharing. For strong flavor, salty as bluefish, you need a light red wine that offers medium acidity such as Pinot . For that you can always count on Hearth's extensive wine list.I also got the chicories salad with bangs cauda - some sort of anchovies dip and Parmesan . Also good tho it was less memorable. Service was friendly and prompt even when the restraint was packed. Bonus point, Shall def return to try the bone marrow and other meaty offerings.",1,,
112,Katie S.,"Alexandria, VA",186,5,0,5.0,5/18/2017,"I want to give Hearth the warmest warmest thanks for accommodating my family and my boyfriends family (for the first fam-fam meeting!) on the evening of both of our graduations from masters programs. I chose Hearth because it looked delicious, reasonable and I really really deeply wanted to try their inventive sounding tasting menu/drink tasting!I called /emailed the restaurant to set up reservations a few weeks before and let them know of dietary restrictions ahead of time for my aunt (vegetarian and sososososo picky she does NOT usually agree to tasting menus) and my foodie sister who is deathly allergic to tree nuts, peanuts, sesame seeds-- such a restriction usually makes eating out nightmarish for her. We figured they could make sure a few dishes were nut free to order a la carted apart from the tasting menu. My sister never EVER thought she would be so lucky to eat an entire 12 course meal worry-free! They crafted? Adapted? An entire nut free menu. And the staff was so patient when she still needed piece of mind and felt to ask again, even when it got busier in the restaurant. The fact that we didn't realize where nuts might have ""been missing"" too is a testimony to the skills of the chef. And maybe it helped it was the earliest reservation on a Wednesday night? A time when the staff may not have been stretched to their limit. But maybe it didn't matter?My picky Aunt is buying their cookbook, along with my sister and my boyfriends mom. She was raving about how pleased she was. Honestly, the best grad gift I could have asked for was a lovely dinner with family, stress free and delicious! Hearth went above and beyond.

113,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",162,257,919,5.0,9/22/2015,"The great thing about living in NYC is that there are so many restaurants to try, that you could live here for years and still not get to everything. The bad thing about living in NYC is that there are so many restaurants to try, that you could live here for years and still not get to everything. So, you feel really lucky when a restaurant has been operating for years, so that you can still get a chance to dine there. Thankfully, Hearth in the East Village is one of these places, so, I finally got to check it out.This Italian inspired restaurant focuses on seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, served in a casual, yet sophisticated, environment. All of the aesthetic elements give you the feeling of warmth and comfort, paying homage to the restaurant's namesake. I went in for brunch, and while the menu sounded great, I opted to go for my own build-a-brunch and ordered a couple starters as my main. First, I had their Smoked Salmon Deviled Eggs. Now, I'm not a huge deviled egg person, but I love smoked salmon, so, that trumped the former. I really loved these, and if you enjoy smoked salmon, you're not going to want to eat a regular deviled egg again. They have a really nice balance of the smoked salmon flavor mixed in the creamy and smooth yolk filling. Then, they're topped with a little piece of crispy fried fish skin, adding a touch of crunch and texture.Then, I had the Balsamic Marinated Eggplant Toast with Ricotta and Basil. These little toast bites were amazing. They might look small, but they're pretty mighty, topped with delicious and hearty ingredients, they make for an excellent part of your meal, or, as an appetizer to share. The eggplant has a fantastic sweet and slightly smokey flavor, completely tender, and a touch of tang from the balsamic. Then, the creamy ricotta adds a nice richness to the toasts, topped with basil for some fresh herb flavor.",5,1,2
114,Craig S.,"Park Ridge, IL",8,78,0,5.0,8/13/2017,"Fantastic food, drinks, and great atmosphere! Highly recommended. They have spots in the bar and outside for walk ins and it worked out great for us on Friday night.",,,
115,A H.,"New York, NY",1,12,4,1.0,10/31/2016,"Ordered pork chop ($29 before tax&tip) since the waitress sold it as being extremely juicy and tender you don't even need a steak knife to cut it. Alas, it came out very dry & tough, on top of overcooked kale that was very salty and drenched with oil. Portion was extremely small (5 pre-sliced small strips - not sure why they pre-sliced a chop..). Also ordered the Japanese sweet potato ($15 before tax & tip). It was nothing to write home about & the plate came with one potato on top of yogurt that they strained themselves. The yogurt was unfortunately also not tasty and certainly a poor pairing choice  for the potato (mushy potato and mushy yogurt - why?). Left restaurant hungry & highly disappointed. Have had much better home cooked meals than this. Will not return or recommend. Cute decor though!",2,,
116,Susan L.,"Dix Hills, NY",163,431,507,5.0,9/8/2015,Love this restaurant.

117,Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",532,652,1577,4.0,5/11/2014,"Hearth serves a lot of traditional Italian style brunch dishes that can be a hit or miss, depending on your palate. If you're looking to enjoy something a bit different from your traditional Eggs Benedict, Blueberry pancakes or 3 cheese omelets, Hearth is worth a try. To start we ordered the grilled bread with wild mushrooms and ricotta. This was damn good. The taste of the sautéed mushrooms with creamy ricotta worked so well. Gf had the poached eggs with kale and pork sausage. She didn't like it but it didn't bother me too much. I like the earthy taste of kale and pork. Pig Trotter with fried eggs were great. Incredibly hearty and heavy. If you're looking for something light, I'd stick with the yogurt or pancakes. However, the side potatoes with rosemary and herbs were ehhhhh not so good. Sausages were also on the sweet side. Weren't a fan of both.",3,,1

119,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,2/26/2014,"Hearth has been a staple in New York City's dining scene for over a decade, but it was only in the past year that they rolled out their weekend brunch service. In all honesty, I was surprised that it had taken them so long to implement, but after a quick skim of the menu, I immediately made a reservation for two for brunch. Nestled on a busy street in East Village, Hearth has a fairly nondescript exterior and it took me a few tries until I found the entrance. Nonetheless, I was greeted by a perfect brunch setting on this Saturday afternoon; an open dining area, plenty of floor to ceiling windows that let in an abundance of sunlight, and a simplistic array of furniture that blended in with the wood-themed interior.Once we were seated at our table, we were pleasantly surprised with a greeting from Chef Marco Canora. He had stepped out of the kitchen to personally hand us a small amuse bouche for the day, a tiny glass filled with a sweet, frothy orange-based drink. It was a nice touch to see him in the dining room throughout the day, greeting diners and asking them about their meal. We did, however, have to decide on our plates and turned our attention to the menu. Hearth's brunch menu isn't too off the cuff, but there are some interesting interpretations and modifications to traditional items that make these dishes unique. Their Florentina, for example, is paired with pig trotters and it was the first time that I had seen kale in the same dish as baked eggs. The latter caught my eye, though, and with a nod of approval from our waitress, I decided on my meal.The Baked Eggs are, at first glance, a fairly simple plate: two lightly baked eggs are plated a top a melange of tuscan kale and shredded pork sausage. Two slices of toasted sourdough slices drizzled in olive oil are served on the side to finish off the dish. The kale and shredded pork was surprisingly delicious; the kale had been generously braised and seasoned and the pork added a savory meatiness to the combination. It was with no small amount of delight that I cut into the eggs, and the resulting combination of the runny yolk, kale, and pork was heavenly. The portion was just right - filling, but not too substantial.We decided to finish our meal on a sweeter note and ordered the Apple Cider Donut Holes. A small plate of them arrived quickly afterwards, consisting of 7 lightly glazed donut holes that were topped off with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar. They were surprisingly dense, sweet, and with a significant apple flavor in each bite.In sum, it was a satisfying, peaceful brunch that we had here. Professional staff, well-prepared and unfussy food, and a delightful dining ambiance ensured a solid experience. At the very least, I can vouch for Hearth during its earlier hours and I'd definitely look forward to their dinner service, where the offerings seem even more delicious.",8,4,9

121,Marshall L.,"Brooklyn, NY",263,63,90,5.0,8/31/2017,"One of the best Italian restaurant ever. The top chef Marco is the sweetest, passion and detail about his restaurant.

The food is very tasty and get to the point Even I hate lasagna ( I had the bad childhood lasagna experience, NYC Highschool made the most disgusting Lasagna ever). But the lasagna I had was clean and sweet. Perfect balance with the layer. We had the best time there. Even I think Michelin star is BS but they worth at least 1 star.

122,Jessica A.,"New York, NY",12,21,3,3.0,12/28/2016,"Came here for the 6-course tasting for $78 as a work team outing. The ambience is on-point given its dim-lighting and overall cozy vibe. It's definitely a restaurant you'd imagine yourself being in when the weather is crazy cold and you just want a nice sit-down dinner with your significant other or close friends, so A for ambience and decor! The only letdown here was that it was an extremely cold day, and the curtains around the front door wasn't as helpful. I was lucky to have sat all the way in the back, but I still experienced a draft by the windows, and felt even more bad for the parties that had tables much closer to the door. We got there at 6:30 when it wasn't busy at all, but didn't start our tasting until 7:15 since we were waiting for our full party to arrive. Luckily, we had a reservation and the resto sat us anyway to order drinks. I ordered The Witch of Blackbird Pond, which boasts both gin and earl grey - two of my favorite ingredients in an early night cocktail. It was good, but nothing much to remember about it. I did enjoy the cocktail list in general, since the names and combination of liquors were interesting!The restaurant quickly filled up from the time we were there at 6:30-8:30PM, which made service really slow. Don't get me wrong, the staff was definitely nice and accommodating, but each of our courses were probably a 20-25 min. wait in between each other. We were getting so hungry in between that we had to ASK for bread! Kind of a bummer that they didn't serve that in the first place. Additionally, one of the courses wasn't explained at all, which was likely just a forgetful mistake by the server, but this was also the first time I've ever experienced that at a tasting. Other than that, the food was great. I especially enjoyed the Cauliflower 3-ways (?) and pork chop, which was very tender and tasty. The dessert course was also really good given that it was an apple cider donut with ice cream on the side. It was the perfect sweetness.Overall, I had a great dinner with my party, but I do need need to knock off some stars for lack of customer service (biggie in my book) and the cocktails not being as great. I probably wouldn't come back here for a tasting, but definitely for a la carte, and maybe in the warmer weather so I can comfortably sit without wearing my jacket.",,,
123,Mary L.,"San Francisco, CA",317,150,163,5.0,12/11/2016,"My friend recommended Hearth when I asked where she and her husband wanted to go for dinner. I am so glad she recommended Hearth! We didn't have reservations, so I got there right when they open at 6 pm to grab a table in the open environment near the bar. The waitress was so friendly and so helpful in answering all our questions and support our decision making process. And while I was waiting for my friends she brought out a sample of a carrot soup, which was delicious!We ended up getting several dishes to share and when we ordered them the waitresses recommended an order for the plating and ordering of bringing out and enjoying the dishes. She was thoughtful not only about helping us choose menu items, but also conscientious about timing the dishes, so they didn't all come out at once. We ordered:1. Roasted honeynut squash, filled with broth, served with watercress2. Gnocchi with sage3. Autumn fish stew4. Braised grass fed beef5. Side of braised greens with red wine and herbs6. Apple cider doughnuts7. Mint tea and Lemon Verbena teaGreat options for paleo, gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian. You can even get organ meats here - they have a burger that combines organ meats (this was our runner up option to the braised grass-fed beef).I also really like their philosophy on food. The coasters for our teas shared their version of food rules: 1. buy it with thought2. cook it with care3. serve just enough4. store what will keep5. eat what would spoil6. home-grown is bestDon't waste it!^ I love this and truly felt they encompassed this philosophy when I ate their food. It was incredibly flavorful, tasteful, thoughtful, with simple, real ingredients. The ambiance is dark, intimate, and classy. It would make a great date-night spot, or good for celebrating or enjoying time with a friend or two. I definitely recommend!",,,

The restaurant has a cozy, warm feeling; there's ample  space and huge windows to let in sunlight. They gave us a sample of black tea with chai spices at the start... It was perfect after coming in from the frigid wind, so much so that I ordered a cup. My friends and I shared 3 apps and 3 mains. I liked all the dishes and would  order the exact same thing next time. Apps: Vegetables on toast, anchovy on toast*, and apple cider donut holes Mains: Vegetable frittata, veal and ricotta meatball*, roasted chicken salad sandwich. * Favorite Hearth was also very reasonable.

We had the meatballs which were good, and the gnocchi which was completely average. The wine selection is good though and they give a pretty heavy pour which is nice. We had some chocolate dessert that was a complete waste and nothing else had looked good so I would say definitely skip on that. Probably won't be going back here.",,,
127,Judith J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,4.0,2/4/2018,"At 6pm Friday night of Restaurant Week Hearth was already bustling.  We were there to celebrate a family birthday but didn't make mention of it except for quiet chatter among our party of 5, including our 11-yr. old foodie grandson.  The night was bitter cold and it was wonderful to feel the warmth of Hearth immediately.  Our round table was generous and comfortable and our server, Laura, was the essence of balance .... professional and efficient, yet warm and caring.  In fact she noticed us giving a birthday toast when our wine arrived and at the end of dinner she placed a  candle in our birthday gal's outstanding dark chocolate pudding dessert.   Food here has a touch of simple elegance and bold freshness that again implies balance.  My lentil soup starter erased any thoughts of the frosty weather outside.  The lentils and vegetables  were perfectly cooked with a sturdy yet creamy texture.  It  was perfect.  We ordered garlic bread for the table and then put in for a second order of the same.  Yes it was that good!  We all ordered the Restaurant Week menu and were pleased by its offerings.  Those who ordered the pork bellies with fennel appetizer swooned over it!  We all enjoyed our main courses also.  I went for Skate Wing served with creamy potatoes and delicious vegetables.  Others ordered the beef with ricotta meatballs and loved it. The very complex chocolate pudding dessert I mentioned above was something  to go back to Hearth for again and again. Layers of pudding and toffee and salted nuts gave texture and surprises to each delicious taste.  I look forward to another visit to Hearth as soon as it gets a little lighter outside so that the restaurant will be a little brighter inside.  I am finding a trend in many restaurants lately to go dark,.  I like to be able to see the art and beauty of the food on the plate before I taste it and at many restaurants I am having a little difficulty with lighting.  Oh and by the way may I suggest you take a look at the wine menu before going to Hearth as it is quite long and all encompassing.  I found 4 wines on the list that I thought we would enjoy and I gave my list to our server who in turn went to the wine steward and within minutes an excellent Bottle of Bardolino arrived.  Cheers to Hearth!",,,

Updated review","I've been to Hearth a couple of times now. I love the ambiance of the restaurant and I think the staff works hard and are very knowledgable of the menu. I just don't like the food menu. There isn't much that jumps out at me and I feel like I have to pick food that I normally wouldn't order. I had the octopus to start and the bass for the entree. Both were good, just not too exciting. The donuts are always the highlight of the evening. Not sure I will be returning to Hearth.",2,,

The carrot with parsley soup shots to start were average.",2,1,1
130,M P.,"Richmond, VA",42,5,0,1.0,1/24/2017,"Hearth was terrible, don't waste your time or money. I recently had dinner with a large group of friends and had the Rigatoni with Pork Ragu. My husband ordered the Meatballs. What struck us as ridiculous was that he couldn't get pasta with the meatballs. Our plan was to share our dinners and both end up with meatballs and rigatoni.However, the Rigatoni was so undercooked, it was reminiscent of a dog's recently chewed piece of rawhide and sent it back. My husband, whose seat was facing the kitchen, watched the server bring my plate in and hand it to the chef or sous chef, who just shrugged their shoulders. No surprise when the ""new"" rigatoni were equally inedible. I also think it's important to say that no one at our table finished their meal. Yes, the food was that bad.Yes, the atmosphere is cozy, but come on, with so many excellent places to eat in Soho and NYC, don't waste your time or money at Hearth. Unless you enjoy spending $$$$ for dim lighting.",,,
131,Julie P.,"Farmingdale, NY",7,24,1,2.0,12/17/2015,"Grabbed something to eat on the way home and decided to order the snapper $32, taste was bland and subpar. I've paid half for 3x portion size that was much tastier too somewhere else. I added pepper and hot sauce to make it more flavorful. Very disappointing. The staff was very nice though and it's has a cozy vibe that I would have liked. Wish I got a larger portion size and that it wasn't as bland. Had to go elsewhere to get more food -this portion size was like if I was on a diet ;( debating on whether it's worth it to come back not likely but the nice staff and cute atmosphere might make me reconsider.Also tried the Nancy Reagans war on drugs drink didn't like it at first thought it tasted like Chinese medicine but it kind of grew on me so I did enjoy it",,,
132,Nina K.,"Manhattan, NY",246,73,29,4.0,6/18/2016,"Great (and surprisingly huge) spot in the East Village that's perfect for a slightly unconventional date or dinner with friends. While not super out of the ordinary, the menu consists mainly of small, fairly minimalist plates. Think: meat without any starchy sides, e.g. burger & toppings without a bun. The food itself is very good though, and the modest portions are actually pretty perfect if you like trying different things and not feeling disgusting later. A bit on the pricey side, but genuinely good and fresh-tasting food. Apparently it's responsibly farmed, so that's a bonus. I'd recommend the Variety Burger (made with heart, liver, and chuck) and the ricotta meatballs. Both full of flavor and meaty & delicious without being overwhelming. Also dying to try the chocolate flights for dessert, paired with wine!",2,,

135,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",550,836,2196,4.0,12/4/2013,"Last month, my boyfriend and I had brunch with a friend at Hearth. Hearth is different and unique from other restaurants I have had brunch at. The food, the menu, the decor - simple and rustic. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, she shared with us the most popular menu items and how they were made.We started off with the apple cider doughnuts. I had read reviews prior to our brunch and found out that the apple cider doughnuts were a popular item to order at Hearth. The doughnuts were lightly glazed and topped off with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar. I'm not huge fan of doughnuts, but these were surprisingly good. They were sweet, dense, and each bit had apple flavoring in it.Our friend had the Veal and Ricotta meatballs which was a dish recommended by our waitress. Our friend gave us a meatball and some polenta to try and it was fantastic! I really enjoyed the veal and ricotta meatballs. The sauce from the meaballs mixed with the polenta was like the perfect marriage. I've never had polenta before, but the taste and texture is identical to grits.Our waitress also recommended the Pig Trotter ""Fiorentina"" with Fried Eggs and my boyfriend ended up ordering this. The Pig Trotter ""Fiorentina"" is really just braised pig feet. I was a little bit jealous that my boyfriend ordered this because his dish tasted a lot better compared to mine and I love pig feet. The pig feet was cooked just right, soft, velvety.I ordered the Poached Eggs with Tuscan Kale and Pork Sausage. I found out about this menu item on Yelp. I like kale and I like poached eggs, so that's another reason why I ordered this dish. Unfortunately, I wasn't too thrilled with my dish. It came with two slices of toasted sourdough bread that was drizzled with olive oil and served on the side of the dish. The kale and shredded pork was a little too salty for me. Our brunch experience was pleasant at Hearth. I would recommend coming here for brunch because the brunch and style of cooking is different from most brunch spots.",2,,1

The private dining room albeit small, allowed for a bit of pre-dinner greetings before we sat down.  The room felt cozy and festive, and although described as ""semi-private"" felt private and ""ours.""

143,Caitlin B.,"Greenwich, CT",357,23,0,4.0,9/29/2016,"I had a wonderful dinner at Hearth last night and here's why:Atmosphere: As this restaurant is in NYC, I am usually wary that the vibe will be be ""very New York"" and ""scene"" however, upon entering, I was pleasantly satisfied with the vibe.  Of course, one would expect in East Village that the restaurants be more ""burb-like"" and causual vs. one located in Midtown or Meatpacking.  The place reminded me of a few restaurants I frequent in Fairfield County with a rustic look, very homey and not too crowded.  Every patron seemed to be having an enjoyable experience.  All good signs.Service: The service was fantastic.  Our server was Laura and the exuded her passion for fine cuisine and the hard work that goes in the the plate selections.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions.  The speed of service was on point - they made sure water was always filled and checking in, but not too aggressive or hovering. They were respectful about when we were finished with a course or not but still efficient.Food: The food was superb! We started with the late summer beans, sycamore farms corn, and chicken liver paté.  A great mix and variety.  For the main, we shared the smoked bluefish and hake milanese.  When dining out, I like to try as many things on the menu, so if you venture to this lovely little spot, go with people who are down to share and explore with you!Recap: If you make it this far down in the city, I'd recommend stopping in to this little gem.  Nothing like a great farm-to-table restaurant with a friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable staff!  When everything flows from atmosphere to service to food, you're guaranteed a delightful experience.  Will definitely visit again!",,,

146,Elise P.,"New York, NY",231,111,61,4.0,6/10/2016,"Hearth is an adorable restaurant, dimly lit, and perfect for a relaxing night after work, date night .. you name it! Make a reservation at least a day or two before because spots fill up even during the week. The service is excellent, you are fully attended to throughout the course of your meal, with top ups of water/wine without even asking. The food is meant to be ""family style"" where you share a whole bunch of things, but the portions are pretty big, so if you're watching your budget you don't need to go over board on the food! The charred veggies and the smashed cucumbers were amazing, I highly recommend them. My friend got the burger and enjoyed it (no bun burger = great) and I had the meat balls, which only come with three, but they're pretty big - I couldn't even finish it! The bill definitely adds up, maybe skip that 48 dollar bottle of wine! Enjoy.",1,,

149,Kristine H.,"New York, NY",60,57,74,4.0,5/21/2016,"I really wanted to love this place, but the experience was a little strange. The interior is lovely, with dimly lit lights and an eclectic mix of thoughtful pieces that make it a great for a date night or a friendly get-together. The food was great - we had the meatballs, gnocchi (which got rave reviews all around), the ""variety"" burger, some mushrooms, garlic bread, and the pork chop (which my dad described as the best he's ever had). The dishes are great but small. They actually recommend 3 dishes per person, and with protein dishes costing close to $30, that can get steep. But that's not why I knocked off a star. The service, while very friendly and courteous, is only so when you do have their attention, and I can't stress that enough. Upon being seated it took a good 10-15 min for anyone to offer us water, and it took another 15-20 for anyone to take our order. We literally had to stop someone in their tracks to get their attention, and while incredibly friendly, all they said was they'll get our server for us, which didn't happen for another 10 min or so. Our server was super sweet, but pretty much MIA. I want to say that maybe they were having an exceptionally busy day, but it didn't really seem like it.",1,,
150,Tricia R.,"Washington, DC",1,14,3,4.0,5/3/2017,"The atmosphere and service were wonderful. Would have been 5 stars if the desserts were better. I had the farro with ramps and pecorino (which was amazing), the bone marrow (also amazing) and the steak tartar (absolutely delish). However, the rhubarb tart was so tart as to be unenjoyable, which was a real shame bc the crust was fantastic and the prosecco zabaglione that came with it was TO DIE FOR. Unfortunately the rhubarb was cooked to a mush and needed some more sugar to cut the tart. I also ordered the almond cake, hoping to at least make up for the rhubarb tart. While the cake itself was flawless, it was paired with a confit orange and tart cream that completely offset the cake itself. I don't necessarily lean towards sweet desserts at all but these were both too tart for my liking and the balance was way, way off, which was a really disappointing end to the meal.  That said I very much look forward to going back to sample the rest of the menu. The food and service was good enough to overlook the dessert bungle.",,,

153,Michele P.,"San Jose, CA",66,138,1072,5.0,2/2/2016,"Great place for brunch. I'd been for dinner before which was good but had been wanting to try brunch since there seemed to be so many great reviews about it. The restaurant is a good sized restaurant for new york and you don't feel like you're being cramped into a tiny space. I really enjoyed the food. I started off with Brunch Punch which was a nice alternative to the usual mimosa for brunch. It had flavors of bourbon and blood orange which are both great flavors in my opinion. My only complaint about the Brunch Punch was the tiny little teacup that it comes in. I would have liked more but maybe that's just my boozy self speaking. If you like blood marys, then you'll be happy to know they have a couple versions that you can choose from. Our table started off with sharing the apple cider dougnut holes. Totally worth the $5. Get them. Tasted like they were freshly made, and were the perfect little snack while we waited for our meal. Our table had the Chestnut pancakes, beef and ricotta meatballs, tomato and eggs, and the tuscan kale and pork sausage. My absolute favorite were the beef and ricotta meatballs. They were flavorful and quite satisfying and sitting in a delicious savory red sauce. The Chestnut pancakes were huge. I kind of feel the portion size is meant for 2. The pancakes were good if you're looking for a sweet breakfast option. The guy who ordered the tomato and eggs was a bit disappointed when he saw the item, he thought it was a bit simple but as the meal went on he found it tastier and tastier. I had a bite and it was very flavorful version of a shashuka but it could have used something to dip up all that tasty sauce. It only came w a small toasted slice of bread but that's it. Overall a great meal and experience. Would definitely recommend going for brunch.",3,,

Toasted fennel and citrus amuse was very nice. The chicory salad was very good. The cauliflower and blue fish was good but I would have made the bluefish cold for juxtaposition with the cauliflower. The mushrooms were extremely good. The rabbit was not good and the polenta it came with bland although I don't care for polenta. The gnocchi disappointing, mushy and no flavor.

The service is top notch.  We had kids in tow and needed a booth so they could fall asleep while old friends caught up and they provided one no problem even though the place was at capacity.  Its not cheap but compared to what other places are charging now its actually not that more if at all more expensive and so worth it.   Every nice dinner or celebration this is the place we go.  Make reservations.  At time you can call just an hour in advance they they'll give you a good estimation of exactly when to arrive.  Drinks and wine are awesome.  Food is great.  Service, ambiance, top notch.

I knew my no brainier choice would be the meatballs with polenta. I absolutely love polenta and I like to try meatballs everywhere I go. So far these don't even crack the top 40. The meatballs were not juicy and delicious like meatballs are supposed to be. They were kind of dry and flavorless to be honest. The polenta wasn't bad at all but there should have been more of it. They majorly skimped on the ratio of polenta to meatball. I was super disappointed. I ate it anyway and took my extra meatball and a half home. I tried my friends pancakes and those were pretty delicious. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or maybe it was an off day. I don't know but the I was sad. I would come back to try their dinner.

Everything about it was just plain horrible. Because I have to give one star, the atmosphere was nice. We made a reservation and the table agreed on the $78 tasting menu. It was flat out gross. Thoughts below. Fennel soup- served in a shot glass. Was fine. Very strong fennel taste. Not delicate. Cauliflower- cold cauliflower on a large glob warm, tasteless hummus. Very weird. Gross. Didn't eat. Beer tartar - the only really edible part of the meal. Shrimp on toast - shrimp on soggy bread with gross tomato sauce. We didn't touch it. Pasta - very soggy pasta with basic tomato sauce. Chef boyardee at best. Minute steak - a friend described this as ""had steak teriyaki."" At least we have a sense of humor. Donut - fine. A small donut. Edible.The portions came out in very uneven paces. We waited over 30 mins a few times and at other times they came out inappropriately quickly. Very odd.

165,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245,3.0,12/15/2015,"IN SHORT: Warm, exceptionally hearty dishes with rustic Italian influences fill this East Village restaurant. While there is nothing new to eat at Hearth, there is plenty to enjoy.THE STORY: In reviewing restaurants, a thin, nebulous line inevitably forms dividing good restaurants from great restaurants. While certain parameters like technical dexterity and execution are more clear, other criterion like creativity and originality are inherently vague and imprecise, and seem to often change with the direction of the wind on any given day.I thought about this line a lot while dining at Hearth recently. I asked what made Hearth good, but not great, and more specifically, I asked if there was merit in a restaurant that lacked originality but succeeded executing a technically flawless dish. Because unfortunately at Hearth, I had the distinct feeling that I had already tried everything on the menu somewhere else, and ultimately somewhere better.I'm going to wax philosophical for a minute. In architecture school, I took an entire semester-long studio on ""Uncreative Architecture."" Its thesis was that there is no such thing as originality in architecture, and that today's students of the discipline should steal ideas from anywhere and anyone, as long as those ideas fuel inspiration and resonate with one's imagination. The caveat, however, was that this thievery must not be concealed, but rather must be actively confronted and engaged in the uncreative production in order to create great architecture.Using this framework, I'll now get back to Hearth. The chef Marco Canora opened Hearth after cooking at Gramercy Tavern and Craft under the influential guidance of Tom Colicchio. He billed Hearth as Tuscan-American fine dining with an emphasis on farm-to-table fare. Hm, sounds eerily similar to the concepts pioneered by those original 3-star restaurants.While the imitative concept could be forgiven, this familiarity continues right into the dishes themselves. Hearth's Gnocchi, sitting in a pool of luxuriously rich melted butter and sprinkled with salt, pepper and a bit of dried herbs is clearly the counterfeit version of the gnocchi at Craft, which stands up texturally much better than Hearth's occasionally soft and grainy bites.The Roasted Cauliflower with sunflower seeds and greens was more compelling, if a little bland, but was made more unsettling by its weak imitation of the same vegetable found at the stronger restaurants on Chef Canora's past resume.Main courses like the Beef & Ricotta Meatballs over a heaping mound of cacio e pepe polenta are the most enjoyable, though at $31, surprisingly expensive for a rustic, red-sauce kind of dish. The meatballs, however, were perfectly juicy and tender, and the polenta as creamy and salty as everyone raves. Chef Canora also handles his pastas well, and the Rigatoni with pork ragu, rosemary, and ricotta hits all the pleasure sensors on a chilly winter evening.Despite many well executed and enjoyable plates, the service often struggles. At my first dinner at Hearth, I was seated for 30 minutes without seeing my waiter, a shocking amount of time during which I would have loved to at least order a glass of wine. The trend continued throughout the meal, with the staff appearing rushed, inattentive, and clumsy. For an amuse-bouche at one meal, I was given a warm chickpea soup in a shot glass, a deeply unsettling way to drink soup. I wondered if this was just the restaurant's misguided attempt at creativity, but when I looked at a neighboring table, I noticed with disappointment that the same soup was served there in a much larger vessel.There is skill, fidelity, and pleasure in Hearth's cooking, to be sure. But true creativity takes courage, and Hearth's inability to creatively borrow or honestly address or transform its familiar cuisine is what ultimately defines it as a good restaurant, but not a great one.",2,1,

167,Mike L.,"Long Island City, NY",11,123,25,5.0,4/24/2016,"I loved everything about this place. The entire back of the menu preached everything I agree with when it comes to food - eating quality, antibiotic-free meats, plenty of healthy fats, and local produce. I trusted in this place to deliver food I would feel good about eating but I did not expect it to be as delicious as it was! I started with the fava bean salad which was loaded onto an olive oil soaked piece of toast. Flavorful, bright, delicious. For the main course, I got the lamb bolognese with perfectly al dente whole grain pasta and big chunks of lamb. For dessert, my friend and I split the almond cake and the apple cider donuts which were both 100% worth the calories. In addition, the atmosphere itself is dimly lit, lively, perfect both for big groups and dates, with great service to top it all off.-Vicki",,,

From the second we sat down we were very interested in getting a bottle of wine. Our server was far from helpful  in choosing one. Not only the wine,but our full course as well.  I dined with 3 other girls and everything we ordered came all at once. We felt as if we were being rushed out of the restaurant. Not only did everything come out at once, but NEVER ONCE did the server ask us how anything was nor did he ever come around to give us more water or see if we wanted anything else. We very displeased with our evening and our experience at Hearth. It was on our list of places to go and now after doing so, easily removed",,,

171,James K.,"Bethesda, MD",0,2,0,2.0,3/9/2018,"I visited this place today for dinner. The service was very good and we had a very caring and attentive waitress. The food was fairly tasty, however the chef had a heavy hand with the salt. The mushrooms were so salty that they had to be taken away and refunded. However, they compensated by giving us wine. Next came the horror. I went to go to the bathroom on the first floor and it was occupied. So I waited for 5 mins until some lady approached me. She was homeless and very jittery. We continued waiting until I was informed about the downstairs bathroom. I knocked and heard, ""ONE MINUTE!!!"" It was the homeless woman's husband. After waiting for 2-3 mins, she came down and yelled at him to leave. After another 5 mins, they left leaving a long line at the bathroom and a bathroom smelling a homeless man and feces. Afterwards, we were given chocolates but this might be normal. Overall, this place needs to buff up their security and be less heavy handed. However the service was great.",,,

Updated review","I have to add that I have been coming here since my last review and not only is the food & wine unmatched in the city, but the service is, as well. You will not find better service anywhere in the city, period. I go there for a solo bite, just drinks, bring folks after work, sometimes clients, etc. If I ever need to impress or simply want a special night, solo or with a party, this is the spot. I""m not even sure how they are able to maintain the highest level of product and service on a consistent basis. Their staff stay there, which says something, but I no longer hesitate is there is a new staff person because they still are just as knowledgable, professional and attentive as the rest of the staff. And while I have spoken of the high prices before, I have never once felt it wasn't worth it, where I have felt this way at other spots. It's hard to venture out when this place is so amazing!",,,

By 12-12:30, the restaurant filled up a bit.I got the eggs with Tuscan Kale and Sausage. They grind up the sausage and oil it up with the kale. And for someone who doesn't normally eat kale, it was oiled and salty enough to make it pretty good.Had a bite of my sister-in-law's meatballs. I wasn't a huge fan of that.I would pass on the $5 doughnut holes. Those were a bit underwhelming. Coffee was good and refillable. Filled up on that.",1,,

181,Lily Y.,"Woodside, NY",66,5,20,2.0,2/5/2018,"I was looking forward to eating here - been wanting to go here for years - unfortunately, I was disappointed with the food - too salty !!  - the soup was too salty  - my entree was the skate which I enjoyed but, once again too salty. Does the young kitchen staff ever taste the food they produce ? Just a little less salt & the soup & entree would have been okay. Instead, I needed more water because of the salt intake. Seasoning is so basic & fundamental  - yet so difficult to execute well ! So frustrating because I wanted to like my dinner more. The dessert course took so long to be served - our waitress apologized. The table next to us got their desserts in a timely manner but, I guess because it was Restaurant Week - the kitchen couldn't handle it (that was what the waitress was implying). But, I don't think this is the first year this place has participated in Restaurant Week - hope they improve their food & their kitchen needs to be more organized & efficient - can't thrive on last glories Hearth !  I want to give this place another try - perhaps, for brunch in the future (& not during Restaurant Week !).",,,

I started with the chicories salad and was less than impressed- I should've gotten the ribollita, I had a little nibble of my friend's and it was a great cold weather comfort soup. I got the meatballs for my entree and they were good, but I wish they came out warmer. I got the cheese for dessert because nothing else really jumped out at me and hey, when in doubt- eat cheese, right? I came on a Thursday night and the restaurant wasn't packed and I thought the service was rather slow. I sat by where people are constantly coming in and out of the kitchen/close to where the receptionist desk is so I was surprised when it took so long for each of our courses to come out once our plates were cleared and how long it took to get the check. I'm sure there are plenty more promising items on the menu, but I'm not dying to go back to find out anytime soon.",,,
184,Maggie M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",109,25,0,1.0,1/12/2016,"So sad, this place used to be a gem in the neighborhood.  After a friend told me about her bad experience with service a few weeks prior, I decided to take it upon myself to go back and tell her it must have been a one off.  Well, I was there this past weekend and the place was empty for brunch.  They staffed accordingly with only on server on the floor, and with the 4 tables she had she was overwhelmed...she was fortunate to have the bartender step in to help.With good food, bad service can sometimes be overlooked. Well, the food was bland and lacked creativity.  Unless new management,  knowledgeable staff , AND a new menu is rolled out I will not be back.When you can't please people in the industry the word spreads very quickly.EDIT:  I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, open it up all teeny fatty chicken chunks.  Could have been a cheese sandwich.  We ordered the bread with goat cheese I believe, the server could have said ""that's the same bread we use with your sandwich may I recommend...."" Instead I ended up with almost a loaf of the stuff.  Pancakes we dry, not enough syrup in the world could cure the dryness.",,,
185,Michelle C.,"New York, NY",35,65,40,3.0,12/16/2012,"Had my christmas dinner here with the ladies last night and i really wanted to LOVE this place, but maybe my expectations are too high and so was somewhat disappointed.   I do love the atmosphere in there, however we had a party of 5 and was seated at the round table which was really meant for 7 people, and hence it was hard to shout over the table and have a conversation together which is not expected with a group of 5.  Just something to note if you have the same number of people. The food was overall good, however i didn't leave the restaurant telling myself i have to go back.  I was more impressed with the appetizers than the entrees itself.  We had:1.  Arugula Fennel Anchovy salad - really yummy and fresh2.  carpaccio octopus with palm of hearts- i really liked this dish since octopus can be a bit chewy sometimes so having it thinly sliced out was much easier to eat3.  Grilled Quail - this was the best of the 3 appies!  a bit salty but when sharing amongst 5 people, everyone got a good chunk of it.  As for entrees, the meatball was the standout dish!  Hearty flavoured and great for a cold winter's night out.  The venison was on the smaller portion side and the Cobia fish was simple/fresh (if you don't mind a bit of fishiness to your dish).Service was great and a good selection of wines!",,,
186,Matt D.,"Loudoun, VA",47,116,9,3.0,12/28/2016,"Based on what I'd read in Eater, I was super excited to try this restaurant. While certain aspects were very good, most were simply good. The service was outstanding--knowledgeable, helpful, attentive and attuned to our needs. The bone broth, which is part of what has driven a lot of excitement about Hearth, was simply good. It had none of the gelatinous mouthfeel I expected and was only mildly beefy and very simply seasoned. My family of five shared several dishes. The standout was probably the rigatoni with pork ragu or maybe the meatballs. The gnocchi was pillowy soft but eating more than a couple was too much and they lacked really any flavor. Desserts were just okay. I appreciate the concept and mission of Hearth more than I do the food.",,,

They were an interesting crumbly texture which I liked but they really just came with a small pat of pumpkin butter (which was good) and  sliced pumpkin(?) the server gave me more butter when I asked but it just needed something else... some fruit on the plate or maybe smaller kind of crispier pancakes.. or more spices in the batter itself... I'm not sure. It was good but underwhelming. My boyfriend got the beef hash which he said had barely any beef at all (I could taste the flavor but didn't get any actual beef in my bite) and for $19 he was very disappointed with that. Overall a good experience but not what I was expecting and wouldn't come back for brunch. Maybe we will try dinner instead. Brunch may just not be their speciality.",,,
188,Scrumphsus B.,"New York, NY",1,21,71,3.0,2/4/2014,"I recently had the fortune of enjoying a delicious brunch with two of my favorite people at Hearth, a restaurant I read about in Timothy Ferriss's book, the 4-Hour Chef. In the book, Timothy emphatically describes the culinary prowess of Marco Canora, the chef-owner of Hearth and Terroir. After seeing many positive reviews about their brunch, I booked a table shortly after the new year.There was still snow on the ground when Anna and I stepped out of the cab. We were running 10 minutes late and Miho had already texted that she was close by. We gingerly stepped over newly formed slush puddles, a result of New York's bipolar weather.  The entrance to Hearth isn't where you think it is. The correct entrance can be found around the corner on 12th street. The first thing I noticed was a beautiful bookshelf filled with cookbooks, memoirs, and Marco's book, Salt to Taste. Miho arrived late after getting confused with the wrong door. Pretty standard. After the three of us settled down and placed our orders, I looked around and saw many menus from famous restaurants around the world hanging on the wall. Naturally, the menu next to me was from Sukiyabashi Jiro. Below is an accompanying letter.After my fanboy moment passed, we were treated to a delicious chai latte drink that filled the area with a spiced aroma and warmed our bodies.The first course was apple cider donut holes which were recommended by yelpers. The dish didn't disappoint - the aroma of caramelized apples made me swallow hard as I brought the first donut to my mouth. Warm flecks of apple greeted me as the donut flaked apart. The dusting of sugar was a nice touch that made us hungry for more.The veal and ricotta meatballs were satisfyingly juicy and the cheesy polenta was creamy. Simple, rustic, what more could you ask for.I was glad when Miho selected a healthy vegetable frittata since my resolution was to refrain from meat twice a week for the month of January. Miho wrote an inspiring article that was published on HuffPo which focused on monthly resolutions and keeping your friends accountable. We continued talking about resolutions and goals for 2014 but were distracted a few times by the fluffy buckwheat ricotta pancakes with banana, walnuts, and maple syrup. The service and brunch was great and definitely warrants a trip back to check out their dinner menu.(For the full entry, visit scrumphsus.com/blog/2014…)",2,1,1
