0,Dan S.,"Seattle, WA",0,26,0.0,4.0,7/21/2018,"Stayed here twice, last month (June 2018) and in 2017. Whether the location is good depends on where you are going. Good for midtown corporate business, like Third Avenue or Midtown East, if you're taking the subway from LaGuardia or JFK airports (the first stop in Manhattan on the E train), or maybe even visiting the UN. For tourists, not within a block or two of anything but centrally located as far as not that long a ride to many things. Not unsafe as nearby housing on Second Avenue is expensive and reasonably high cost office space is on Third Avenue. The British Consulate is a block away.Pro -1. smaller hotel (about 8 rooms per floor) so the staff may feel they are not anonymous. Also not much foot traffic per floor. My experience is that the staff is reasonable nice, not rude.2. Qatar Airways staff stay there so that's a stable bunch of hotel guests not making trouble or noise. When they arrive, the lobby is wall to wall of flight attendants and pilots, none of which are from Qatar, ha ha.3. newer hotel. The fixtures, doors, furniture are not old.4. microwave and refrigerator, common to the Hilton Garden Inn brand. Good for saving money for snacks and even breakfast. (Hilton Garden Inn seems to be Hilton's slightly budget brand that has free breakfasts for Gold and Diamond level Hilton Honors guests, but not regular guests.  Hilton Honors is a frequent guest program, like an airline frequent flyer program, except for Hilton brands of hotels. In contrast, Hilton's dumpier budget brand, Hampton Inn, does have free breakfast but not as tasty). Note: during my first stay in 2017, when I was entitled to free breakfast because of being Gold level, they gave me a green coupon so if you don't have a green coupon, don't think your breakfast will be free. There are grocery stores within walking distance, unlike Times Square or Wall Street hotels.5. There is some security in that you need a hotel key to use the elevator.6. They use paper cups. I like that. Really luxurious hotel brands, like the regular Hilton or Hyatt, use glasses, but the sanitary level with paper is constant, not variable as with glass.7. The place is quiet. E. 52nd Street has little vehicular traffic. There are a few rooms above the restaurant which have a potential for noise but are usually quiet. This is because the restaurant usually doesn't play music except for the very rare evening party. The restaurant is small so it's unlikely that any wedding would want to go there. (During my 2017 stay, I got one of those rooms. The room vibrated but it stopped at 10 pm and was only one night). That room is also by the elevator but has no elevator noise.8. The windows open, which is great if you need some fresh air, like if your husband or wife passed gas...boo. They don't open wide, which is safe for kids.9. Made to order breakfast (eggs, omelets, etc.) are tasty. I got that free in 2017 when I was Gold level Hilton Honors but this year, I am cattle level (moo), which means no free breakfast.10. They have regular bars of Neutrogena white soap, unlike Marriott, which is transitioning to cheapo pump containers on the wall.11. During rain, they put out umbrellas to borrow for the day, which is handy. No need to buy one or bring one on the plane.Con - 1. The hotel only has two elevators. The hotel could use a 3rd elevator to speed things up that would probably mean major architectural changes. Potentially slow.2. I like showers with a hand held wand. The Hilton Garden Inn brand doesn't have these, as far as I know.3. See #7 under Pro.Neither pro or con1. The rooms are typical NYC size, which is small. No room for a sofa. There appears to be balconies way up but probably 95% or more of rooms don't have them. 2. Room rates. They are all over the place. I've seen them just over $100 in the middle of winter to over $400 during peak periods. That kind of variation is common in NYC.Overall, I like the place.",3,,
1,Lilu M.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,2,3.0,7/4/2018,"Eh, for the price it is okay - I have seen better.Cons :-The hotel is so tiny. I have never seen such a tiny hotel room.  -The lounge is so small and gets crowded, hardly any space to sit down.-The elevators take forever to come and usually crowded.-No free breakfast (that's a first hotel that doesn't provide free breakfast)-Water is provided only to honors members haha okay...- I saw a strand of hair and the coffee machine was equally dirty so you loose a star for that.Pros :-No bedbugs. I was so worried about staying at NYC hotels because of bedbug horror stories. (you get a star for that! otherwise it would have been a two star hotel)-Nice views -Extremely nice staff-We arrived early and they were nice enough to hold our luggage for us so I am so thankful for that.-FUCKING GREAT LOCATION.Will I book next time? Nope. Why? No free breakfast and the rooms are so tiny and not cleaned well. Do I blame the staff for not cleaning? No. They are probably not compensated well. No blame on the staff.",,,1
2,Andy J.,"Orlando, FL",101,412,3347,5.0,7/15/2017,I arrived in NYC early Friday morning and got to the hotel by 10:30am - way earlier than their 3pm check-in time.  They were more than happy to hold my luggage for me.  They also had complimentary umbrellas by the front door which was perfect given the rainy weather.  I came back at 1pm and they offered to upgrade me to another room that was ready since the room I picked online was not ready yet.  The room was pretty big for NYC and had a nice view of the city.  The AC kept the room cool.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.  The walk-in shower was large and had good water pressure.  The lobby was not big but had enough seating for the people there.  They had ice water with fruit in it available which was nice after coming back from a walk.  There is a subway station one street away which was very convenient for me.  There is also a great bagel shop right around the corner and a couple of craft beer places within a 10 minute walk.The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  I always felt welcomed when I got greeted after being out and about.  If I am back in the area I would definitely stay here again.,4,4,5
3,Melanie M.,"Commack, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/12/2018,"i come here with my 3 kids and i expect them to have an amazing breakfast considering the fact that it was free but NOOOOO I DIDNT GET A GOOD BREAKFAST. WE ASK FOR BANANAS. THEIR SOLD OUT. my 2 year old daughter started screaming because there were no bananas. that's all she wanted. my 9 year old son with my 12 year old daughter were running down the stairs to catch their ""fine"" morning breakfast and they both fell down the stairs hurting themselves. not only am i pissed at how steep the steps are, but it was the emergency exit, so if there was an emergency, they'd have to run BUT THEY WOULD ALL FALL. My free morning breakfast is ridiculously terrible. we asked for a banana with a panini. took 20 minutes for panini and served others after us before us...and didn't even tell us we should get the fruit from the table. ridiculous. never coming here again. my kids were so unsatisfied and so were me and my husband.",,,
4,Melineh H.,"Glendale, CA",140,230,334,5.0,1/30/2017,"I can't type long enough to express my happiness and relief choosing this hotel during my almost ONE Month long business trip in January here.Staff: Liz , Inzhira and Margaret are the perfect front desk Advisers. Each morning and night we chatted and whatever help I needed, they went above and beyond with. Smart, informative and Swift. Most of all, after staying there for so long, I considered them friends. Hilton is so lucky to have them on their team!Management: Miguel is on top of it! Along with above Ladies, he was willing to assist me with any issues I had and was *always* so patient and helpful. He is a true leader for his team and consistently kind and again, patient! I stay at many hotels and can confidently say that hotel staff is normally always on edge and tired and they let you know it. Not Miguel or the staff.Food: the restaurant and their staff are beyond amazing and hospitable. I had breakfast and dinner there 90 percent of the time and was never disappointed! They have breakfast special every so often to switch it up and family style buffets. I'd normally eat dinner in room but restaurant has great energy and I'd highly recommend. Yaoquin, Latrice, Yanita (my amazing access to fabulous wine and cocktails) and the entire team always greeted me so warmly; I can't thank them enough.  Rooms: Clean and comfortable. It is on small side but that's cause it's NY. I had a wonderful new, fabulous bed and room was cleaned whenever I asked. Towels and linens changed seamlessly. Lobby: comfortable with fireplace and ample seating. They have tea/coffee service daily, Wine tasting weekly and various other events. Location: so many fabulous shops and restaurants around! I loved walking to my new fave french bistro (around corner) called Le Bateau Ivre. Grea Irish pub near by too. Locals are very sweet. I'm returning soon for another business trip and look forward to seeing the gang!Xo melineh",3,1,3
5,Ashley C.,"Charlottesville, VA",232,1,0,5.0,6/28/2018,"My coworkers and I spent almost 2 weeks here on a business trip. We have never had more fun and it was largely due to the excellent staff at this hotel. We felt that by the end they really knew us on a more personal level and made us feel at home, especially Violetta! They also have great lost and found service and they definitely accept American Express. Also, there are no banging sounds at night. Highly recommend to anyone!",1,,2
6,Rebecca S.,"New Providence, NJ",14,10,1,2.0,3/24/2018,"I probably won't book another room here.  I'm told it's new but the beds were so uncomfortable so not sure what happened there.I am a Honors member and I'm supposed to be entitled to ""Complimentary Hot Cooked-to-Order Breakfast for you and one guest  throughout your stay""  at all Hilton Garden Inns but they told us after we took cold scrambled eggs from the buffet that we would have to pay for it.  I actually stormed out and told them their food sucks which I normally wouldn't be so rude but the fact they tried to charge us for something that should have been ""cooked to order"" and FREE I was angry..Great location is pretty much all they have to offer.",,,
7,Kathryn D.,"Arlington, MA",1,38,88,4.0,12/27/2017,"I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Manhattan Midtown East with my husband and a friend for three nights at Christmas, and overall was quite happy with the experience. Here's what I liked and didn't like: Pros: - The location was excellent. Most of the sites and museums we were visited were in Midtown or on the Upper East Side, so it was perfectly walkable. - We were pleased with the quality of the room. When looking for a hotel, it was unexpectedly difficult to find a room in New York with two queen beds (rather than a king and a sofa bed), so I was glad to find it here! While not exactly spacious, the room size was acceptable and what I expected in the city. The room includes a microwave, small refrigerator, and a much-appreciated Keurig. We were on the 15th floor so didn't notice much noise from the street, and didn't hear anything from guests in the adjoining rooms. - Although it's not an inexpensive hotel, for New York City, it's reasonably priced. - The housekeeping staff was extremely courteous and professional. Cons: - My friend arrived several hours before me and my husband, and wasn't allowed to check in. I called the desk, gave my reservation number and personal information, and asked that she be added to the reservation, and the concierge said it was all set. However, when my friend returned to the hotel, she was told that they had never received a call from me, and she ended up having to wait a number of hours until we arrived. Throughout our visit, we did not find the desk staff to be especially helpful or friendly (although, as I mentioned above, the housekeeping staff was excellent). - It might sound ridiculous, but the elevator is just abnormally slow. We often waited three to five minutes for the elevator to arrive. - The bed sloped somewhat and could have been more comfortable than it was. While it wouldn't be my absolute first choice in New York, I would certainly feel comfortable recommending this hotel.",,,
8,Anna B.,"New York, NY",4,100,22,5.0,10/25/2017,"Better of the NYC Garden Inns I stayed at. I'm a Gold member, so I asked for a quiet room on a higher floor, and it was everything I needed: simple, quiet, functional. I don't love the Midtown East location, but would stay here for the quality: I stayed in at least 5 hotels of the Hilton brand in Manhattan, and this one is the winner so far. Again it's a Garden Inn, so don't expect luxury, but for NYC budget hotels - clean, comfy and quiet is already kind of a luxury!",,,
9,Susie A.,"Minneapolis, MN",98,327,423,4.0,3/29/2017,"Great location for exploring Manhattan. We walked to many things that were fairly close: Times Square, Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue shopping.  Central Park and the Met are a little farther, but still walkable. The subway is right on the corner to take to farther locations.Our room was clean. We were on the 11th floor and had a view of the Empire State Building! What a fabulous surprise!!!  You have to use your room key to get the elevator to move. A pain when your hands are full, but I appreciated the security.The exercise room under the lobby was very nice and well equipped.  The bar in the lobby was not appealing.  (I would head literally next door to the Monarch Rooftop bar instead.)  They set out tea and coffee in the morning on the bar that you could help yourself to.The desk staff was super friendly. The hotel also has a luggage room where you can store your things until your room is ready or your flight is departing. They give you a numbered ticket and the room is monitored, so no worries.What would make this hotel even more of a score would be if they included breakfast in the cost!  I can't eat $20 worth of breakfast food at their restaurant buffet.  That's ok. We had the best bagels at Best Bagel and Coffee down the street.",,,1
10,Amber M.,"Portland, OR",407,28,15,1.0,7/14/2017,Worst hotel I've ever stayed at in my life.This place completely treated myself and my boyfriend like shit. I am a white German woman and my boyfriend is African American/Hispanic. This hotel is racist. If you are ethnic or if your s/o is ethnic avoid this place. The rooms are mediocre and they smell. They accused us of smoking in the room when we don't even smoke then asked us to leave after we had already paid for 4 days. This place is a joke. Luckily we found a much nicer hotel with better amenities and friendlier staff. I've never been so disgusted.,4,,
11,B E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,37,1,1.0,8/16/2017,"I honestly hated this place. The biggest problem was the shower that did not drain. It was filled past my ankles by the time I was finished. Really disgusting shower experience (not to mention ripped shower curtain, etc.)The physical hotel makes so much noise, you will be woken up many times throughout the night by loud banging sounds. Sounds like a nail gun being shot every 10-15 seconds. There are two elevators, which the staff also uses. So you wait at least 3-4 minutes to get on the elevator, and then it stops about 10 times on the way down. You are lucky to get to the lobby in less than 5 minutes. This doesn't sound like a big deal when you read it, but it really is a bigger issue when you're constantly standing there waiting for what feels like an eternity. This hotel has made me rethink my loyalty to the Hilton brand.",1,,

14,Peter F.,"Portland, OR",0,12,0,1.0,10/14/2017,"At $1400 for two people, four nights, it's no bargain. The room is tiny, barely large enough for the bed and one small chair. We were on the 12th floor, and the elevators stopped working. I waited 15 minutes, gave up and used the stairs. They knew about the problem, but did they post signs? No. Too much trouble I guess.The front desk said ""yes, we know, we're working on it."" No apology, no offer to do anything to make up for it. No timeline on repair.Restaurant wants $14 for a continental breakfast, $22 for hot food. Comp me because of elevators? ""No, it's not my fault."" OK.

15,Carrie C.,"Collegeville, PA",0,5,0,1.0,10/10/2017,"I travel weekly for work and often make reservations through my travel agency.  For my stay at this hotel I had the unfortunate situation of my trip being cancelled at the very last second (the evening before my scheduled departure day).  I called the hotel the minute I knew and asked them very kindly for a cancellation due to my last minute work change.  They were completely unhelpful and refused to cancel my room.  I know for a fact - as told to me by Hilton Honors Corporate - that last minute cancellations are at the discretion of the property.  When I called, I was nothing but nice and apologetic to the front desk and eventually manager with whom I spoke.To add insult to injury, the room cost that night was well over $500 and, looking at options for the following week, I saw the same hotel for $272!!!  On top of that, I was not awarded my Hilton Honors points (long time, very loyal Honors customer) because I didn't actually stay at the hotel!!!!  So, they charged me $578, wouldn't help me out and do a favor to cancel and then didn't award me the points I deserve.  Terrible, terrible hotel customer service.  I will never stay here again - not that I stayed this time!!",,,1

AND they had a microwave, a refrigerator, and a Keurig coffee maker!I loved the fireplace in the lobby, and enjoyed the afternoon snacks and water that were always available.  The location is perfect!  It's quiet, but within walking distance to so many great restaurants and bars!  And I was even able to walk comfortably to the theater district and Grand Central Terminal.  I could've walked to Rockerfeller Center and Central Park, but I wasn't in town long enough to see everything.  Everyone was always so kind whenever I left or arrived back.  The Customer Service alone would bring me back, and I will be back, and I'll likely stay at this hotel again.",,,

18,Ron F.,"Summit, NJ",19,5,0,1.0,8/3/2017,"I'd like to preface this review by stating that I stayed here one year ago to the day.I had a pleasant experience, despite the physical limitations of the property, as noted by other reviewers.What I experienced during this stay left me so angry and humiliated, that I cant imagine wanting to give a Hilton anywhere 1 cent of my hard earned money, and I'm a silver Hilton Honors member. My wife booked my reservation using her credit card. I choose not to carry credit cards for short stays, carrying only a debit card.When checking in, my wife's card was declined. I then gave them my debit card which was also declined. The desk clerk told me that they were having problems with their cc terminal, not to worry, that they would straighten it out the following morning.The next morning when I left the room, I discovered a bill under my door, which was an unspecified partial charge for my stay.I left the hotel to get breakfast, and returned 30 mins. later to find that my room key was no longer working.I tried to dismiss the idea that this was somehow related, not wanting to believe that anyone in a service industry could be so heavy handed as to hold my room and belongings hostage.I went to front desk, and before I could even say good morning, I was told by the clerk that there was a problem with my card, and that it needed to be resolved.When I asked if this had anything to do with my now non functioning room card, the clerk became evasive and refused to give me a direct answer. At that point, she took my card, re-scanned it and handed back to me saying that it should be fine now.Not allowing her to sweep this under the rug, I once again demanded to know if in fact they had deliberately locked me out of my room,At this point, two other clerks, sensing a problem, and coming off equally defensive, backed her up, giving the impression that that I was being unreasonable. No attempt by anyone to reassure me, and no manager or supervisor in evidence.The issue with the deposit centered around the fact that they couldn't process the card on file, without my wife's authorization, since the card wasn't present. They then emailed her a consent form, which she promptly authorized and returned.Pretty simple solution to a simple problem, right?Now if only they had done this BEFORE making me feel like a 12 year old petty thief, by keeping me from my assets, and being dishonest, defensive, evasive and condescending, everything would have been business as usual, and we'd have a problem free stay.The manager arrived late to the show, apologizing for what occurred, but I dismissed his attempt, saying that the damage was already done, words being hollow at this point, and that the hotel staff's actions spoke volumes about a broken service culture that apologies couldn't possibly fix.No further attempts were made by anyone to amend this incident. Maybe they felt that if they did nothing, time would pass, I'd get over it, check out, and it would be like the tree that fell in the forest with no one to hear it fall.This location does a large airline staff layover business. It's their bread and butter. I get it. I really do. I don't begrudge them, so at the very least they could put up a better front, and act as though my business was really important to them.My encounter was a textbook example of the ramifications of poor treatment.Notice I didn't say ""poor customer service"". That would be beyond ironic, since there was no service, and I in no way was treated or made to feel like a customer.Disrespected, marginalized and violated is all I felt.My one hope is that someone reading this review, will take it as a heads up, and be able to avoid having to experience anything as demeaning as what I experienced.If insanity is doing the same thing twice, expecting different results, then being of relatively sound mind, rest assured I won't come within spitting distance of this place, at least in this lifetime.",1,,
19,Kiera M.,"Red Bank, NJ",0,6,0,1.0,11/8/2017,"I wish I could NOT give them a star. The worst customer service.

It is not as expensive as other hotels a little bit closer to central park but your also not getting the view, shucks. Manhattan New York is a great place to visit and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on the hotel since the Taxi's are so expensive. Remember to save extra if your bringing your family as the food in the city is not cheap especially when you multiply by many mouths! It isn't the top rated hotel but also not like staying at one of those gross Hostels that you hear about the college kids staying in or the homeless.

21,Stacey R.,"Londonderry, NH",55,66,42,4.0,3/8/2017,"Spent just one night at the Hilton Garden Inn in Midtown East and had a pleasurable experience. All the staff members were very warm, personable and helpful.The lobby is very welcoming and there is a nice area where you can grab some homemade infused fruit water. There's also a restaurant/bar in the hotel, but our stay was less than 24 hours and never made it in. The menu looked pricey for the kind of food. $19 burger?! If you were to get room service there are extra fees on top of the already hefty prices.The location is great. On the same road are tons of great restaurants like Totto Ramen and a few sushi places and an Irish Pub.Staff was very nice. On the elevator a young gentleman who was doing the last rounds of room service asked us how we were enjoying our stay and made conversation with us. He genuinely had an interest for his job and the guests.Water pressure in the hotel is amazing. Room (two queen beds) was small, but clean. Always nice to see a clean bathroom and carpets that aren't disgusting. Nice view of the city on the 13th floor. Room also included a microwave, mini fridge and HDTV flatscreen.The only downfall is the check-in and check-out process. We arrived an hour early, around 2 pm, and was told the room would be ready around 4. We didn't mind since we wanted to venture out into the city, but it's a little misleading because everywhere on the website it states the check-in time is at 3 pm. They were nice and let us at least check-in our bags so that we didn't have to lug them around with us. Checking out was easy, but it took over 30 minutes for the car to arrive. I suggest letting them know 45 minutes to an hour before you plan on leaving that you need your car.We will definitely stay here again. Prices are great! $126 for the night WITH taxes and fees included. That's VERY hard to find, especially since we were right in the city and only a 5-minute walk to Fifth Ave. $70 to park the car for 24 hours. Could be worse.",,,

You should especially say yes if said hotel is a Hilton.From the outside, this looks like a typical Hilton. The inside, however, offers a beautiful lobby with music playing, the Hilton pantry, the front desk, and a small business center. The staff was friendly and welcoming and they had the temperature set to just right on a warm NYC day. The hallways are small but this is Manhattan so that's to be expected. There are only a handful of rooms on each floor but that keeps things from being loud and rowdy.The room was also on the smaller side but New Yorkers don't expect huge rooms. I liked how the TV was built into the desk area and there was also a Keurig machine, a mini-fridge, and a microwave. The AC was powerful albeit a bit loud at times but nothing too distracting. The bathroom was gorgeous! The glass enclosed shower was awesome with a good amount of water pressure. Overall, this is a sold hotel if you're in town to see a show but don't want to be on the side where all the craziness aka Times Square is.

In that bag, I had placed a set of vintage cufflinks - an Xmas gift from my partner. I was heartsick. But within 48 hours my bag was identified in their lost & found. Today, the bag and all contents arrived complete & intact. I needed to drive on this trip to NYC, and chose the hotel largely because of available parking. That said, I was concerned about what might happen to my brand new car in the hands of the valet. No worries: 3 days of valet service and there's not a scratch on it. Add to this their accommodation of my delayed/ midnight check-in, the tidy room, friendly and helpful staff, and a Manhattan location that's convenient but not jam-packed with tourists...

39,Lindy P.,"Raleigh, NC",258,366,614,2.0,10/2/2014,"It pains me to give what looks to be a great hotel only 2 stars..... but 2 stars is actually more than I'd honestly like to give them :(  The location is great- it's at the corner of 52nd & 2nd Ave in the heart of Midtown East.  Very walkable to many nearby restaurants, bars, & grocery stores.  That's about the only good thing about this hotel.When I arrived to the hotel at 10am, they checked me into my room & I was super grateful to have a room so soon!  Upon arriving to my room, there were greasy pizza stains on the clean white duvet cover, which indicates they don't launder the duvet covers after use.... YUCK.  I used the bathroom and saw a gooey/sticky mess all over the bathroom counter.  The room was allegedly cleaned, but I'm confident it wasn't. I called down & they said they'd find another room for me, and I waited an hour before calling them. They had no clue that they were supposed to be looking, so I left for work and came back at 7pm with hopes to have a new room... but again, the front desk had no clue they were supposed to find another room. The water in my hotel room smelled like 200 year old pipes, and when I told the front desk staff about it on Tuesday, they said they'd have maintenance up to look at it.  They never came when I checked out on Friday.  Again, they had no clue they were supposed to do that.This hotel needs to get it together.  They have zero communication and the housekeeping sucks.  Do yourself a favor & support the local boutique hotels instead of this HGI.",3,,

41,MJ A.,"Oakland, CA",173,426,23,3.0,9/15/2014,"This is a brand new hotel, equating to the rooms being very clean and updated.  The rooms are fairly standard size for NYC and the location is excellent, within walking distance to the 4, 5, 6 and N, Q lines.  Customer service is also quite friendly despite what I am used to on the East Coast. Three major qualms for any traveler considering this HGI:1.  The rebranded ""Garden"" restaurant which is a rehash of the older HGI American Grill boasts a new menu touted as fresh though is anything but.  I came in for breakfast, had one bite of the stale and watery oatmeal, and then decided to head somewhere else.2.  Be cautious with the front desk offering to have a cab ready for your return trip to the airport.  The front desk woman made it clear that it would be $65.00 flat rate, including all tolls etc.  Sure I said, as long as I can pay credit card.  The front desk woman confirmed, so I took the bait.  I wasn't surprised once at the airport that the driver insisted on charging an additional amount if I used a credit card.  A very nice hustle between the hotel and car service, but one that I did not appreciate to say the least.  3.  Prices for hotels have been steadily increasing in NYC and your wallet will feel it here as well.  In summary, I would definitely return to this HGI.  The clean and updated rooms and friendly staff outweigh the costs and other negatives... so long as you are not a mark.",1,,
42,Lucy W.,"Atlanta, GA",19,1029,651,4.0,7/5/2014,"Love the convenient location, and the fact that the hotel is brand new (since I visited about 3 weeks after their opening). The Lexington/52nd street station with access to the E & M lines is diagonally across the street from the hotel entrance.  Other lines are short walks away, or you can also connect from the E or M.  Travelers- Both E & M give you access to Grand Central and Penn Stations...the stop at 52nd near the hotel has an up escalator to access the street if you have rolling suitcases.  I actually walked from Grand Central station (easier & cheaper to take shuttle bus from Laguardia to Grand Central then to take a cab) with my suitcase, since it was nice outside.  I have taken to staying in east Midtown...it is a little calmer than the touristy areas toward the west, but it is still close enough to be convenient to Times Square and the Broadway theaters, for those who always plan to attend shows like I usually do on every NYC trip. The standard king room was sized by typical New York standards- small, but well designed so that it could also fit a king bed,  desk, small cabinet closet with in-room safe, mini fridge and microwave, TV, armchair and ottoman.  There's also a Keurig machine in the room, and free coffee and water in the small lobby, so if you are thirsty in the hotel, you really aren't trying that hard to quench it.  There are plugs and outlets galore at the base of all the lamps, along with USB charging plugs at bedside.  Bathroom is pretty small, but has pretty sizable countertop space, along with a fairly good sized stand up shower stall with adjustable water pressure.  Air conditioning in the room worked well out of the unit below the window, though it was a little bit loud.  Bed and pillows were very comfortable, though I probably would have fallen asleep in a chair since I was tired from roaming around the city for two days.  Wifi is free throughout the hotel.  This hotel does not offer free breakfast, but given that it is New York, there are plenty of places around for cheap breakfast options...Ess-a-Bagel is a couple blocks down on 3rd (though there are long lines...worth it) and an independent coffee shop on 52nd if you head west and don't want to order from one of the many chain options.  Lots of restaurant options in the neighborhood as well...it is also a short walk from one of my favorite food options in NYC- Plaza Food Hall.Lobby is small but has quite a few lounge seats and sofas to hang out on, a business center with free access to Internet and if you want to print your boarding pass.  There are a few outdoor patio seats as well, which was great for the nice weather days when I was visiting NYC.  The front desk staff is very friendly and accommodating...shoutout to the weekend day shift for letting me check in early (since I had called earlier in the week with the request, if rooms were available).  They also store luggage so it would not have been a big deal if early check in was not available.New hotel hiccups- the shower stall mainly...did not have a ledge to put the soap, shampoo, conditioner...and its door does not seal correctly so water gets all over the bathroom floor. SLOW and small elevators- one morning I was fed up after waiting for an elevator after two completely packed elevators went by, so I took the stairs down ten flights. That is fine since I'm able bodied and I wasn't carrying my luggage that day, but yeah, tack on extra time just to wait for the elevator.",2,,1
43,Jen B.,"Sierra Ridge, CO",2,72,7,4.0,9/13/2015,"Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. It was the best price I could find in Manhattan and the location turned out to be perfect. It is about three blocks from the 51st and Lexington subway station and within walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, Empire State Building and Grand Central Station. Just about everything we wanted to do we could walk to or hop on a quick subway trip. The room was pretty small, there wasn't much room to have suitcases on the floor and not a closet to tuck them away in. Pretty typical for Manhattan I guess. The lobby had complimentary fruit infused water and fruity candy every afternoon and coffee/tea in the mornings. DO NOT go to the hotel bar. Just don't. My boyfriend and I went in just to grab a drink and ordered one double vodka tonic and one double vodka seven, both with well vodka. The total for these two drinks was $44 before tip! That is simply nuts! We paid more for these then we did for craft cocktails at dinner. There is a pub two doors down that is open later, has a better vibe and cheaper prices. Going to the hotel bar was a big mistake. One we will never make again. Also, if you are on a higher floor, plan extra time to be able to catch an elevator. There are only two and often you have to let a couple full elevators go by before there is enough room to squeeze in.",2,,1

Echoing Mike L's review, this HGI's location is blocks from the subway, not super hustle-bustle, close to Essa Bagel and great row of restaurants along 2nd Ave on 51st. PROSA friend and I shared a double for four days. The hotel was celebrating their one year anniversary since the refurbishments and we got to enjoy some extra treats and candies laid out in the lobby area. In the mornings, my friend and I would come down for complimentary coffee and teas. At night, we'd return and fill up on some fruit-infused water. While I was hoping to run outside, the torrential downpour that weekend meant otherwise. Their gym (in the basement) was a bit small but had all the essentials. The staff was friendly and housekeeping was prompt with providing extra towels after we got caught in the aforementioned downpours. Especially during an extended stay, it was nice to actually use our microwave-fridge. While too many hotels fill precious mini-fridge space with overpriced bevs, it was nice that we had all the real estate to store leftovers and familiar favorites.CONSAs an asthmatic who's sensitive to scents, I was a bit irked that they had a fragrance mister spewing continously in the gym. Albeit, the gym's in the basement and people don't necessarily smell the best during workouts-- but maybe install some extra fans? The air conditioning unit in our room kept emitting a musty smell which couldn't be remedied even after we tried blasting the fan for a couple of hours. This wasn't too big of a deal since both of us preferred to sleep in the natural air. For the remainder of our stay, we turned the A/C off and kept the windows open. Our room was relatively clean, but the duvet covers were ostensibly worn and needed replacing. Overall, this Hilton Garden Inn was super convenient. Besides some tiny bumps, I'd recommend it to value travelers.",4,2,2

He had to put his card down, and the hotel placed a pending charge on his account because he only had a debit card on him. I call, speak to 4 different people, and was told a new form would be sent to me to complete via email. I received the email but nothing was attached. Mistakes happen, so I call again and eventually send over a new form, wait four hours with no confirmation, and then call again to make sure they had received it. The gentleman helping me was a manager and hung up on me when I expressed his frustrating this process was, and the importance of switching cards. Despite being assured that the old cards would not be charged, I called back to confirm on the day of checkout. Apparently the representative assisting me forgot to attach the form again and the original cards were charged at check out. I call AGAIN and eventually get transferred to the billing department who straightened it out. I ask for an emailed confirmation and updated folio.

When we returned at 1:30, our room was ready, and by the time I finished checking in, Eddie had our bags ready for us.The room was a city view on the 23rd floor, it's not the most spectacular view, but it was definitely nice. Room was extremely clean, and about the size you expect for the price in midtown Manhattan.Sunday night, we had dinner reservations and it was a monsoon. The bellman, Andrew, saw we were heading out, and immediately said, ""Let me get an umbrella and I will get you guys a cab."" Well, if you know what Manhattan is during afternoon rush hour, in the rain, you know it is next to impossible to get a cab. Andrew ran up and down 3rd street for a good 20 minutes in the horizontal rain to get us a cab, then helped us stay dry while we got in.

71,Andrew V.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,1,1.0,6/1/2016,"We had a family emergency that caused us to travel to NYC last minute. We booked this hotel for 4 nights. We booked over the phone and the person did not tell us that there were two different valet prices regular size, and over sized (which is $10 more per night). The person over the phone quoted $55/night and when we arrived in our small crossover the valet service marked it for $65 oversized pricing. After finally accepting responsibility for the misquote (originally was not willing to honor the error), we checked in to our room and they credited the difference to our nightly rate. Please keep in mind we were tired from a 13 hour drive for an emergency brain surgery on our family. We get into our rooms and it was a nice room except the shower leaked onto the floor in multiple rooms. Our two other family members that had a similar room also complained of the same exact issue. You are at hazard to slip and fall with our much it was leaking. We then switched rooms for the final two nights and the bathroom door squeaked so loud it would wake everyone up for anyone that had to use the restroom at night. After a terrible nights rest they fixed it and slept peacefully the final night. We are then checking out, and gave our ticket to the valet  team. We waited over an hour and a half to have our car brought to us. Meanwhile, standing in the lobby the hotel worker kept saying ""about 5 more minutes."" I have seen people come in and give their tickets before us and have had their cars brought. They brought the wrong car which caused a backup and put other cars ahead of ours. This is absolutely ridiculous. By far my worst hotel experience ever. To top it off, there is a sign in the lobby that says ""The Hilton Garden Inn Satisfaction Guarantee- We promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you're satisfied, or you don't pay. You can count on us. GUARANTEED."" I will absolutely never recommend this hotel to anyone. We had a total of 3 rooms and everyone had their own issues with this hotel. They promised to switch a one bed room to a two bed room and they ""lost it in the system."" Try dealing with an incompetent staff on top of a family emergency. I sure hope that the Hilton Garden Inn will look into this horrific experience and make necessary changes to prevent future guests from having to deal with the same levels of stress.",2,,

The rooms are very modern and spacious.  The fitness center is very nice and they even have laundry onsite which is a huge plus!  I like the fact that they have microwaves in the rooms, so that I can heat up my food since I eat every few hours.  Location is great!

74,Michelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",322,53,0,3.0,5/29/2016,"This review is only for the restaurant as I only experienced their open buffet on Saturday afternoon. food was good not great as expected from a 3 star hotel kitchen. it was for $26+tax+tip. My favorite was salad -which is nothing special obviously- lettuce leaves, store bought Parmesan and tasting like store bought dressing, that's all. Steamed/grilled vegetables were also good. Salmon was very dry and tasteless, tilapia to much batter, too much oil again tasteless, pasta appropriately cooked but with a so so sauce. My waiter was super friendly, always kindly smiling, a 5 star wonderful young man with a lot of positive energy. Definitely an asset for the hotel. The pasta cook, a young African American female was so rude, so out of line arrogant and abusive to cancel him out and make the experience neutral. Too bad!! Hilton, please take notice: that woman is enough for any client not to ever want to come back neither to your hotel or to your restaurant and I am sure you don't want that to happen.",,1,
75,Ronald R.,"Haymarket, VA",0,12,0,1.0,4/19/2015,"Beware of the parking trap!!!   I Paid 55.00 for an additional day of parking because they said I stayed an additional 40 minutes or so after a 24 hour period of time with the car. It was nothing to do with check out time. I was upset that I was told there would be no additional charges of I checked out at 130 pm by the front desk staff which was nice! Late check out. But when I checked out around noon 1 1/2 hours plus before that time I was charged an additional day of parking at 55.00 and told because I dropped my car at 11 something and it was about an hour after that I would have to pay for an additional day. This was not right because I specifically asked about additional charges so I could avoid them. Place looks nice in the lobby but it's so very small. So be prepared for no place to sit or wait when your checking in or waiting for your room to be ready. They had a large group of kids in the hotel when I was there that kept the small lobby full and noisy.  the decorative water dispenser for everyone to take in the lobby looks nice and was a nice touch.When checking in I asked to use the bathroom and they only have one unisex bathroom in the lobby for everyone to use and there is always a line for people to use it which  was weird and icky especially since it's right threw a door by the front desk in the area people are eating their food from the restaurant so just outside the bathroom doors are people's tables they are eating at and with all the people using the restroom and waiting the area smells and seems weird.The rooms looked nice inside only issues I had was I could hear my neighbors threw the walls tv, coughing and such.Avoid the coffee maker I say this because I think they leave that stuff there and never replace it and there is no telling what someone has done to it. I went to use the disposable cups that are wrapped in plastic and there was water in the bags and cups???? Are they washing them and reusing them or did someone put them in water or wash them off or put them in the toilet as a nasty thing to do and the maid not put out new ones after she cleaned the room not sure but it was strange.Well the experience here wasn't the greatest and was upsetting. I expected better from this chain of hotels.",1,,

Few days later  i called hotels.com and i asked to be refunded because that horrible experience, they said they talked to the hotel manager and they both agreed to refundo my money. after 2 months, i got the night charged in the credit card left by incidentals straight from hilton, not hotels.com. i called the hotel and they said that they could not help me out. very unprofessional and bad attitude staff.

For dinner we headed around the corner two blocks and found numerous restaurants.  Rooms are small but it is NYC after all and you don't spend much time on it anyway.  There really is no closet so with 2 suitcases it was a little tight.  The coffee machine and fridge came in handy too.

81,Cari L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",1,2,0,1.0,12/5/2016,"When we landed in NYC I got an alert from my bank that I had been overdrawn due to a charge from the hotel. I booked my room on Bookings.com and was not to be charged  till we arrived at the hotel. I was charged before we even arrived!! I called the hotel in a panic and spoke with Liz, the ""manager"". She was rude and arrogant and simply told me there was nothing she could do about it. When we arrived at the hotel, I showed the other ""manager"" Miguel my booking confirmation stating that there would be no charges till check in (we were planning to pay in cash). Again, I was told how sorry he was, but nothing was done. I was also charged a $50 a day fee that I was unaware of. Again, all the apologies but nothing to rectify the situation. When we finally arrived in our room, I was told we would have early check in- but nothing was available, the toilet was clogged. I called the front desk and asked them to please come fix the toilet. This was at 12:30 in the afternoon. When we returned to the room, 12 HOURS LATER, the toilet had not been fixed. It then took another hour to get someone to come fix it. The manager on duty gave us breakfast vouchers for our trouble. Insert eye roll. Overall, the hotel was clean and in a great location, but that's where it ends. The staff was condescending, one manager told me ""it's a new day, lets move on"" when I mentioned an issue from the the before. I would not recommend this hotel. With all the options that are available in NYC, don't waste your time on this place. I give this place a big thumbs down!!!",1,,

My stay included a room on the 20th floor with a great view and a great location. This hotel is surrounded by bars, restaurants and a metro station. The staff was very professional, friendly and extremely helpful, so helpful that after checkout, they watched our bags allowing my wife and I to go sight seeing until our departure to the airport.

The rooms are not very spacious but the layout maximizes the space. There was only a standing shower (no bathtub) and the water never got hot; very warm, but not hot. I like to unwind with a really hot shower so this was disappointing and a bit frustrating. I am guessing the temperature is regulated both for safety and environmental reasons but it was annoying nonetheless. In the grand scheme of things this was a minor annoyance.

This place overcharges for wi-fi, has a rarely / poorly staffed business center that overcharged me by $20 for a print job and refused to reimburse me (in addition to the exorbitant $1 / page for black and white prints). This place also scrimps on even the basics, such as coffee makers in the rooms. Service was decent or I'd give it only one star. Even so, I stayed for a major national conference and the check-in line was nearly out the door. Midtown Hilton also might have the slowest elevators in the nation.

88,Christina F.,"Seattle, WA",47,3,0,1.0,1/3/2016,"This hotel single handedly managed to put a massive damper on an otherwise amazing trip to New York for us. We checked in on new years eve and showed up around 5pm. Check in says it is guaranteed at 3 but we were told that no rooms would be available for 2 or 3 hours. Normally this wouldn't be the end of the world but we had plans for the night, as did every other person who travels for this night! The reason for the delay was completely the hotels fault as they allowed a huge group to check out around 7pm even though they charged us $300 for the night! Im sure they charged the group for that late check out so they just racked in the money for leaving us out of our room for 5 hours past check in time. The manager offered us a $50 credit at the hotel bar and we had no other choice since we didn't have a place to get ready for the night that we planned. But a $50 credit on a night that I am charged $300 hardly seems right. Then the next night a false fire alarm causes us to go down 22 flights of stairs and we don't recieve any sort of explanation, just sitting out in the freezing cold. We tried to have the hotel refund our last few nights since we prepaid for the entire reservation for all of the inconveniences that occurred but the manager Brian thought that would be too kind. We just wanted our money back for the nights that hadn't yet occurred but apparently Brian thought it would be better for us to be forced to stay here or pay for an additional hotel elsewhere. Not to mention that the beds here are as hard as sleeping in the floor. At 28 I don't experience much back pain and I have never complained about a bed at any hotel until now. This is the worst hotel with the most nonchalant and dismissive staff I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. Great location but there is hardly a shortage of hotels in this area. Stick to the Marriott or Double Tree, I'm sure this sort of experience is exclusive to this hotel only. Enjoy your trip to New York!",,,

The hotel itself is either new or very recently remodeled and the decor is nice.  It is a little on the small side but the multistory reception area is airy and open. The corridors are a little tight, but the rooms are nice.  There were only two negatives:  the housekeeping staff seemed to park their cart on my floor near the elevators and it was a little difficult to navigate with your suitcase around it to get to your room. Second,  my room had a small wardrobe type set up instead of a closet.  If you are over 5'5"", I'd ask for a closet as a dress will not hang full length.On the very positive side, the room and common areas were nice and fresh feeling.  The staff were incredibly helpful in providing local support and directions to some off beat places.  They went out of their way to be friendly and go the extra mile.  I will definitely stay here again.",1,,
