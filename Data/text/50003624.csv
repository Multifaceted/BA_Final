0,Melissa O.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,0.0,5.0,10/25/2018,Their Breakroom burger has got to be the best burger i've ever eaten. I'd recommend it to everyone. Just be warned it's a pretty tall burger and for sure get messy. And i love how they have Mexican Coca Cola which totally taste different from the Coca Cola here.The place is also small but i'm sure it seats more than 10 people. So try to get a seat if your gonna eat inside first then order. I think it's also insta worthy to take a pic inside for its brick wall and drawings. Overall i'm definitely coming back!!,,,
1,Nazish C.,"Chicago, IL",35,158,55,2.0,11/1/2018,"Painfully average. I got the fish sandwich and my husband got the chicken sandwich. My fish on my sandwich was well fried but very bland. The actual fish was also about 2xs bigger than the bun so everything was spilling out of the sides. My husband also wasn't a huge fan of chicken sandwich he got. He said it was straight up gross. We shared some onion rings with it and those were actually great with a delicious sauce.The other redeeming quality of this place is the prices. The sandwiches were around 7 bucks which is crazy for a city. So I'll give them that. However, with all the restaurants NYC has to offer, I'd never choose this place.",,,
2,Alexander S.,"Santa Clara, CA",197,16,11,4.0,10/12/2018,"Right when I walked in there is a planet express sticker. This made me smile from the get go.  The staff is professional (notice how I didn't say friendly). I had to get their self named burger, ""the Breakroom burger"". I got a nice seat by the window. They dropped of my plate to my table which is nice.  My first impression is this burger is a skinny gal, but dang she is tall with some flavor. I had to squeeze is baby down and watched the juices drip.  It's cool I had gator tots to catch the flavors, no worries.  I'm not finishing up my tots with some habanero hot sauce ""black label"". Yes black label, hella fancy!! I also, got the mint lemonade which is very refreshing on this beautiful fall ny day. If you are a bro foodie, you would love this joint.",,,1
3,Melissa D.,"Charlotte, NC",12,130,404,5.0,11/16/2018,I really enjoyed this place. I came in for lunch while visiting the area and I'm glad I did. The people ate nice and the food is great. It's a small spot but that usually means the food is good lol. If you're in the area give them a try. You won't be disappointed.,,,
4,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3648,951,2085,3.0,8/31/2018,This is a solid 3 star burger joint. I would call it a joint since it is a very small place with only a couple tables. Not sure they even have ac because it was hot in there. It was a solid burger but nothing earth shattering. 4.5 star rating is too high.  They have a lot of choices here between burgers and tacos. Maybe I didnt choose the right item but the breakroom burger is what I went with. Also tried the fries which were average. Nothing stood out about them. We also tried the tempura taco which was pretty good though. But with all the hype this place didnt live up to it. I would come back but wouldn't consider it a destination spot.,15,3,9

Updated review","You've got to be kidding me with this fish taco. As a Californian I don't expect to find delicious fish tacos in NYC. But breakroom gets it right with the crispy crunchy texture, refreshing pickled onions and creamy aioli. Skip the pork belly tacos (nice and smoky but a bit dry) and go for just the fish tacos. That and any burger with an egg on it. Throw in the affordable prices and the fact that this is a little foodie oasis that you can retreat to during lunch break for jury duty and they definitely deserve the five stars.I can still leave the fries and the drier chicken in the breakroom burger, but all in all, I can trust that I will walk out of this spot happy.",6,3,5
6,Hue H.,"Queens, New York, NY",8,21,70,5.0,11/12/2018,BEST TACOS EVER. I came here with my cousin after a long day of both of us not eating much and damn was the food worth the wait. I got the roast pork burger which has a fried egg topped between the meat and the bun and it was pretty small but stacked so I guess I can't complain. My cousin got their taco platter so for that you choose 3 tacos and they were all good too. The ingredients taste fresh and they season everything pretty well too. We also got the onion rings which I liked but my cousin said was too starchy. The onion rings are big but an order only has like 7 rings so I felt a little let down by the fact that it was over $5. They were topped with sauce and I don't remember what sauce it was but all I know is I didn't feel the need to use any of the sauces they had available. I will definitely be coming back and I want to try pretty much everything on the menu.,,,
7,Ashley S.,"Sheepshead Bay, NY",344,85,94,3.0,7/2/2018,"I've been here a few times since it's opened and the quality has certainly gone down. When they first opened the food was great, now the food is just good. I got the mint lemonade and fish tacos. I usually love their mint lemonade but today it was pretty watered down and really just tasted like sugar water even though there was a big piece of lemon in there. It's still decently good because it's refreshing on a hot day like today. The fish tacos were pretty disappointing to me though. There was a pretty big piece of fish that was fried perfectly. It wasn't too oily or over-battered which I really appreciated. What disappointed me was the tiny piece of lime and the thinnest slice of avocado you can imagine on the taco. The lime was literally a 1/4 of a lime slice which left the taco more on the bland side. The avocado was also paper thin honestly. It was as if it wasn't even there. Taste wise, it was actually quite good I just really question some of the portions of the sides. If you do come here, I suggest asking for extra limes for the taco. Also, some other really good dishes are the breakroom fries and the burgers.",,,
8,Dumond A.,"Manhattan, NY",7,87,5,4.0,9/4/2018,"Just left the area and only NOW do I discover this place.  Figures.Cozy little burger joint stuffed next to the Whiskey Tavern and a few other establishments on Baxter Street, near Columbus Park.They make a fairly mouth-watering assortment of burgers, all made with great ingredients and cooked to your liking.  I got the Breakroom burger and a pork belly sandwich, along with some fries and tater tots.  Was not disappointed in the slightest.Prices were totally fine and the service was prompt and friendly.  Definitely will pop in here if I'm in the area and need something more filling than what the nearby watering holes can provide.",1,,
9,Sam K.,"San Francisco, CA",559,291,700,5.0,5/11/2018,"I would like to thank Yelp for leading me to Breakroom. It was super neat to find Breakroom on Baxter which had multiple Vietnamese restaurants next to it. I accidentally walked by the restaurant on my first pass getting here.Breakroom's high rating is definitely warranted and justified - Best bang for your buck. Glen was holding down the fort and made us felt at home; was nice to get the local NY vibe instead of the chic-trendy millennial ambiance. Just from trying out the tacos and burger here, you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Unfortunately I was unable to try everything here with the limited stomach space. The tacos here were super solid - not your typical taqueria taco with diced ingredients. Fish tacos and steak tacos recommended for sure.",9,6,8
10,James R.,"Jamaica, NY",110,53,79,5.0,5/5/2018,"This place defines the ""Find Me In"" section on my profile, ""Hole Im The Wall Gem"". What's New York Without places like this.

11,Darwin G.,"New York, NY",277,966,67,4.0,8/25/2018,"I went with the mix of 3 tacos, pork, steak, and fish tempura. Some of the best ""modern"" cheap eats tacos I've had, as in not exactly your traditional hole in the wall taqueria/foodtruck. All were great. Great large tacos with flour tortillas, though the dish could have come a bit hotter. Despite the praise of the fish taco, the tempura dominated the taco a bit much, but the fish tasted incredibly fresh and flaky, and again, no issue with portions. The Arnold Palmer and it's sweetness did a decent job with the dish, but the heavy amount of seeds in the lemons the stuffed into the cup became troublesome when drinking from a straw. Imagine every few sips with a lemon in your mouth.I came in surprised this place had such a high rating. Small joint, order at the counter, a couple cables and high bar stool chairs. Turned out to be a great, quick, and cheap meal.",,,

13,Jada G.,"Upper Darby, PA",68,188,295,5.0,4/14/2018,"This is such a little hidden gem at the edge of Chinatown! My boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and needed to eat after a long morning of travel and stumbled upon Breakroom. It's a very tiny spot with only a couple of long tables and window-facing bar-style seating. We split some fries and each got burgers (Breakroom and Classic). The burgers had a nice crispy edge and the bun was stable enough to handle the abuse that comes with eating. The fries were the really good kind, you know with the batter-like outside.It is cash only, but for NYC it's a pretty good deal! Definitely one of my new go-to places if I'm ever around.",1,,
14,Yasir A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",156,57,79,5.0,3/17/2018,"This place is soooo good. If you're looking for a very filling and tasty burger that's worth your buck, this is it.There's so much happening in the food and all the different tastes and spicy make the food just mouth watering.I'm not a huge fan of the tacos, though they're delicious, but the burgers hands down here are definitely worth having. This is also a spot you can visit occasionally. It's not expansive; if you want something in a good budget; breakroom is the way to go!",2,,2

Very small place keep that in mind. Lots & lots of different hot sauces. Food:Breakroom Burger: A def must try if your a first timer. Burger is made with two hands in mind. Its a mess but its a blended mess of greatness. Breakroom Fries: Damn these fries are good and with a kick of spicy & cheese.

It's absolutely insane how I haven't done so yet.First of all--try their Breakroom fries. Whether you want crispy pork belly with it or not, that's up to you. I would say without though. Their crispy pork belly was kind of hard when I got it with the fries, so it was meh. But please do get the Breakfroom fires. I really love it. Second, their burgers are the perfect portions to fill you up and it's also very good. UGH. Please do try one. But most of all, make sure you try their tacos first if this is your first time here. Personally, I am allergic to avocados so I always order my tacos without avocados (I know, sad life).I like their fish taco a lot. I would recommend that. Their pork taco is also really good so that would be my second recommendation to you. Actually, all of their tacos are really good. Go have fun and try them all! I would just say that the crispy pork belly in the taco is kind of hard, it's crunchy so meh. Not my favorite.It's not very expensive either so I think this place is pretty amazing. I also really like the seating and decors even though the place is so small. Check it out please, let me know your thoughts! I think you will like it. I personally was pretty obsessed with this place when I used to work around here. I would go pretty often hehe.",2,2,5
19,Jessie L.,"Manhattan, NY",7,32,11,1.0,10/10/2018,"Honestly this was my favorite place to order on seamless if I want some tempura fish tacos. But after today, no more. 1) i preordered food on seamless for pickup at 12:30. I got here at 12:35 and then the cashier rudely told me ""were not open yet."" So I told her, ""okay but I ordered for pick up."" Then she said they hadn't made the food yet and I asked how long it would take, she said 5-10 minutes. So I said okay I don't mind waiting 2) Two delivery guys came in and got their order and left to yknow deliver to people. A customer came in after me and ordered 3 tacos which is pretty much what I placed an order for and she got hers before me, mind you, she didn't place an order beforehand, she ordered in person. 3) if I ordered food for pickup, it's clear I have places to be but yeah this is ridiculous. If you don't open until god knows when, why make those your hours on seamless. I'm pissed.",,,

21,Tayron A.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,4,1.0,7/10/2018,"I was raving about this place. Until they served my takeout order with a staple in my tots, and a burger patty that was seemingly cut out? Weird.

23,Cherrilyn B.,"New York, NY",467,125,304,3.0,7/20/2018,"This place is very small (no bathroom). The decor is spunky- a hand painted lady on the wall, a few colorful paintings, stickers, and etc. you walk in, have a bunch of choices between burgers and tacos and fries and onion rings... basically all drunchie food. The onion rings (3.95) were super oily but tasty and had an orange sauce drizzled on top. The break room burger was also exactly what it said...onion ring, fried egg, pork belly, thick burger patty. Not the best place for a health freak (but they do have vegetarian options). I'd recommend if you're in the mood for fast-cas greasy food!",,,
24,Bridgette S.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",254,133,287,3.0,1/24/2018,"Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good. But I have to say it was a lil less than my expectations. I ordered the Breakroom fries & they were interesting and heavy and fattening and all that good stuff, but I just expected...more. There was maybe 4 little tiny bites of what I think was supposed to be the pork belly but it was dry and kinda blended in with the bacon. The fries got kinda soggy at bottom bc of the cheese and sauce but that's expected you know. Overall it was decent I was just expecting more.

This Breakroom's own version of tacos. I'm not a flour tortilla person, but even still I REALLY enjoyed my meal. They had two vegetarian options: tempura avocado and a veggie with mushroom and avocado. It was filling and tasty. I love sauces and condiments, so it was nice to get to try so many different flavors. They have 'em lined up on the wall and take your pick! Including one called 100% PAIN. Loved their plain fries. Crispy and seasoned really well! Bae tried the pork belly, steak, and chicken tacos. He liked em and then added on a chili cheese dog on top of that! Follow their Instagram account - breakroomnyc and drool and then go there. Lots of other options, like crispy fried chicken.

Updated review","I decided to give breakroom another try and I'm glad I did. I ordered the breakroom burger and the mexican corn. Let me tell you. The breakroom burger was delicious!! It tastes 10 times better if you add barbecue sauce and cholula green pepper hot sauce. Seriously guys... you need to try that combo. It's BOMB.  The corn was pretty okay, i think the mayo threw everything off but it was still quite enjoyable. If I didn't live so far, I'd be coming here everyday.",,,
28,Candace H.,"Brooklyn, NY",296,246,516,4.0,12/27/2017,"The name of this place it truly fitting as it is probably the size of a lot of ""breakrooms"". With that being said their is seating for about 12 people. Nonetheless my friend and I came in around 5pm. We wanted to get a bite to eat before getting ice cream at nearby Taiyaki. As a true Yelper, I already had a sense of what I wanted to order. After taking a few minutes to glance at the menu we stepped to the counter and placed our orders. I ordered the 3 tacos: tempura fish, spicy pork, and cheesesteak then an iced sweet tea to wash it all down. All the tacos were fantastic! The cheesesteak was my favorite followed by the spicy pork. The spicy pork is truly spicy with a lot of heat behind it(at l say for my pallet but it was delicious). The fish taco was good but it could have used a tad more sauce on it. The sweet tea was also delicious. The kind of delicious that you get kind of sad when you reach the bottom of the cup. My friend ordered 3 tacos as well and an order of tater tots. I snagged a few and they were also very tasty. Overall, I enjoyed the food at Breakroom and would definitely return if I'm in the area. Next time I'm there I want to try the chopped cheese! I'd also recommend the place to anyone who is shopping or hanging around the Chinatown area.",9,5,8

I want to say 3 years and it hasn't changed, which causes the foodie in to rejoice because CONSISTENCY. So this is a Mexican fusion spot that is quite literally a hole in the wall. there are maybe 12 seats and not much room. But what it lacks in space, it makes up for in flavor. They serve tacos, burgers, fries and more but as a course of habit-- it's tacos for me. When I brought my best friend all those years ago, he got the a burger and loved it. Okay, on to foodage. I got the 3 for 10.95 deal, and chose carnitas, steak, and pork. All so well seasoned, filled with pico de gallo-- though I'm not a huge fan of onions and they were a cut a bit larger than expected. But that's not reason to drop a star. My friend also had tacos, but he switched in a chicken one and he loved them all as well. We also ordered loaded fries. Guys. It had tater tots, cheese, pork, egg, jalapeños. I'm still in shock. Oh! I should mention-- no alcohol. But it's BYOB, so that's works. Also, 15$ credit card minimum. Slight deterrent, but as most people spend that much for a meal anyway, not an issue. As always, happy eating and drinking. MMG",1,,

The food will be piping hot (especially the tacos!) and will taste better because there are less being churned out by the second. The place is tiny (2 shared tables and bar stool seating at the counter and at the windows), so I recommend getting your order to-go and eating at Columbus Park or Collect Pond Park, weather permitting.If you're eyeing the items with super fatty ingredients (e.g., tempura fried fish, pork belly), try to order conservatively because they're extremely greasy. Unless you're OK with walking around with what feels like a pound of fat clogging up your arteries and congealing in your stomach... It's also why I don't recommend the Breakroom Burger, a towering ode to excess that's so greasy I don't think it'll taste good even if you're drunk.I knocked a star off because the wait times are always long (at least 10 minutes) but the food isn't consistently well-prepared. Some Yelpers have complained about the dip in quality over the years, and this certainly seems to be true during peak hours.",,,
40,Brian C.,"Elmhurst, NY",326,342,39,3.0,6/23/2018,"The team behind the counter was friendly, but the food is really only worthy of 2 stars. I ordered their ""chopped cheese"" and maybe I'm responsible for the poor decision of ordering one in Chinatown, but it came highly recommended and it was just a total failure in my book. The Breakroom chopped cheese was not reminiscent of anything I've had uptown -- the meat was dry and in big chunks (might as well have stayed a burger patty, the cheese didn't seem all melted, and the overall sandwich was bland. No matter my efforts of drowning it in ketchup to add flavor and help the dry meat, it couldn't be saved and I didn't even want to finish the entire sandwich. Not a fan, wont be returning.",,,
41,Janet J.,"New York, NY",332,204,380,5.0,10/30/2017,"FISH TACOS!! So yummy, it is hard for me to live so far away from the Breakroom. It's always a dilemma for me when I go to Chinatown. Soup dumplings or tacos/burgers? It was a tough call but so glad I chose breakroom - the burgers and tacos are delicious! *Taco Platter: you get to pick three of your fav tacos for $10.95, theyre $3.95 each otherwise. Dinosaur and I got the tempura fish, pork belly and steak taco and enjoyed all. Fish taco was our fav. Comes with a hefty slice of avo and the fish was battered and fried to crisp perfection. Can't get better than this. The pork belly wasn't the best, but was still ok. Good bang for the buck because these three babies are filling. *Breakroom burger: comes with fried egg, yay! It is a bit difficult to each because it is STUFFED with toppings. I like the jalepeno peppers that add the extra spice. The patty is cooked really well and the burger is very juicy. I love the toasted brioche bun. UGH it's just good - get it, you wont regret it. *Tatertots: I know, who gets these at restaurants? BUT THESE WERE SO GOOD. Crispy and just adds that extra umph to the tacos and burgers. Limited seating, communal high top tables. You'll be elbow to elbow with your fellow breakroom diners.",8,2,4

Very fresh not heavy. The bun resembled a potato bun which was the perfect pairing. I definitely recommend this sandwich and will order it in the future.

44,Krizia A.,"Miami, FL",226,6,16,5.0,6/25/2018,"While visiting New York, I found this place via Yelp and I figured I'd give it a try after looking at the photos. Wow I was so impressed with the food. All the food was came out pretty quickly and was very fresh. My boyfriend and I ordered catfish tacos, tater tots, a burger, and 2 Mexican cokes. The catfish tacos and tater tots were delicious! The catfish pieces were perfectly fried and crispy and the sauce was so tasty. Also, the employees were very kind and helpful. The one issue with this restaurant is the limited spacing. This is not a good place for big parties. My boyfriend and I had trouble finding seating but luckily a group left as we finished ordering our food. I would say that it's better to order take out if you're staying nearby - in our case we had a long way back to our hotel. I highly recommend Breakroom for lunch or dinner. I can't wait to go to New York to eat there again.",,,

You seriously cannot go wrong with anything on the menu here.I had the Breakroom Burger which easily hit my top 5 fav. burgers ever. The onion rings are just as amazing and I'm not embarrassed to say I also had a Tempura Fish Taco and glad I did!

I was near Breakroom which had been on my list for a while so decided to check it out. I came in late afternoon on a Saturday and there were only a couple of other people in there. I got the Breakroom Fries, which I had expected to be smaller given what the staff indicated, but it was actually a pretty big portion. Prices are great for the amount of food you get here. About 1/4 of the way through, I realized these fries were my Everest. But, not wanting to waste it and unable to take it to go, I powered through and finished nearly all of it (I don't recommend this; much better to share). Really good flavor and I like the mix of tots and fries. I'd like to try more here to really get an accurate picture of what it's like, but just based on the fries, I'm impressed.",2,1,2

Once I saw some pleasant reviews from some of my trusty Yelp friends, I figured I'd go give it a chance. The place is small, like really small. Like only 2 picnic style tables small. So don't plan on bringing a group because you might have to wait on a table. And if you come alone, you'll have to share some personal space with other ppl, which I'm fine with. I went with the tacos and ordered a fish, cheesesteak,  and a chipotle chicken. The fish taco was amazing. I really love  crispy fish tacos in general and it lived up to all my expectations. The chipotle chicken wasn't good to me, at all. I didn't even finish it. The cheeseteak had potential but wayyy too much  cheese. It too away from the flavor. Next time I'll order all fish or try a steak. I also had a passionfruit lemonade which was pretty good",2,2,2

Tacos were solid, brownie points for an extra crispy fish, but the fish flavor was lost amongst the other toppings. The fries were just alright - your usual mush of potatoes, nacho cheese, and bacon bits. Unfortunate not a crisp tater to be found, and the meat was strangely tough. I will definitely have to revisit this place to get a burger and perhaps a revised review.",1,1,

The place isn't big so seating might be hard at times. We ordered the 3 taco deal and we ordered the steak, chicken, and fish.The food came out quick and was very fresh. The fish was very tasty and very flavorful. And with the hint of lemon they give you, makes the tacos even better. I would definitely recommend to get the fish.The steak and chicken was good but might have been slightly over cooked as it was abit dry. However it was still amazing and the toppings on the tacos definitely helped the slight dryness. Don't get it twisted, the chicken and steak is still very delicious",,,

The fish was super crispy, but I felt the fish was almost overwhelmed by all the toppings on the taco. The fries were also superb, but I wasn't a fan of all the nacho cheese that ended up making the fries and tots kinda mushy.if I hadn't been bursting at the seams already, I would've tried some of those fantastic looking burgers, and this rating probably would've been much higher. I'm excited to go back for a second time!",,,
52,Shawn W.,"Queens, NY",10,11,7,4.0,8/4/2018,"Ladies and gentleman be warned, everything on this menu looks delicious. But don't worry, I'm here to kind of help. The first thing that caught my eyes was the cheesesteak sandwich, however I had other lunch items/plans lined up with a friend that I dragged along, so we chose tacos. Why?!? Because they had cheesesteak tacos!!!  soooooo my friend and I ordered the following, fish tacos, grilled steak tacos, cheesesteak tacos, chicken tacos and break's nachos (ran into a slight issue with this one, our fault though).First up!! The tempura/fried fish tacos are sooooooo gooooood!! The crunchy flaky fish with a combination of cool pickled veggies and smokey hot sauce (it's literally Smokey grayish black sauce bottle on the side) really hits the spot on my summer afternoon lunch visit. Then came the cheesesteak taco or errrrr, grilled taco... they looked exactly the same except that mine had cheese on it. It was chunks of steak, I thought cheesesteak would be sliced ribeye like how they served the cheesesteak sandwich. Oh wells, looks delish but unfortunately it wasn't and the same can be said about the grilled steak since it was the same thing plus pickled veggies so it kind of made it taste like the fish tacos, except it was steak and the steak was rubbery so  and we doused it in that smokey gray sauce (after!!) so it didn't taste too , but still . And then the chicken taco, it was good, however with the same pickled veggies and a side of red hot sauce to change up the flavor a bit since the first bite without the sauce kind of tasted a bit similar to the first two, however the chicken was nicely season!! And last but not least, the break nachos!! The pork and bean sauce was awesome!! Unfortunately, we either didn't read it on the menu or it wasn't on the menu, it's pork and beans!! Too bad for my friend who can't eat pork... apparently it's only a sin if you tell people who can't eat pork and they continue to eat it. So I decided not to tell her so she can continue to eat it and not knowingly sin  see, a good friend! And the other awesome part about the nacho was that it stayed crunchy, how many places do you know serve up loaded nachos and after an hour it's still crunchy?!? Not many!! Anyway, I will be coming back for that cheesesteak!! They promised sliced!!! Not cubed steak!! And I heard the burger is amazingly good too! And tater tots!! With cheese!! See what I mean? Everything looks so good!! But I had other plans after this spot, which is down the block, Japanese ice cream with a fish Not a big deal, but the place gets a bit hot/stuffy so get there right before lunch or during winter.",,1,

I'm sure if the fries were warm it would've tasted better, but the fries were alright. It was still crunchy surprisingly. I ordered the Breakroom burger since it's highly raved. It has a lot of flavor I'll admit I enjoyed the sunny side up and the pork belly. It was drenched when I picked it up, as much as I wanted to enjoy the juices, my fingers were soaked and I felt like I was rubbing oil and sauce into my food. The bun on the bottom seemed to be getting harder the more bites I took. On the bright side, the meat was cooked medium rare like I asked. I think the food deserves more stars, but since I probably wouldn't come back it's just average. Still, I'd try it. May be your type of burger and you might get some warm fries!",,,

The philly cheese (to my surprise) was my least fav because the sauce they put was overpoweringly spicy and drowned other flavors. Other two were top notch!!! I'm literally drooling thinking about them.Also ordered the guac and chips which gave me and my friend an enormous portion of guac with what seemed to be homemade chips perfectly salted! My friend ordered there special taco of the day which was tempura avocado as well as the chicken one, and she enjoyed them both.Bonus - not a huge lemonade fan, but when my food didn't reach $15 credit card minimum I gave it a shot. The lemonade was sooooo good not too sweet and not too bitter just perfect! Ambience :As others have noted it's very small, three long tables with 6 stools all together on each. No bathroom.

65,Kim Y.,"New York, NY",312,95,777,5.0,7/15/2017,"The best fish tacos in NYC! Hands down!A cute joint nearby my home with the best fish tacos. They offer a great taco platter on the menu that allows you to choose 3 tacos on the list for a total of $10.95. A taco would set you back about $3.95, depending which taco you choose. The taco platter is a great value and always my go-to lunch or simply just Taco Tuesdays.I always get two fish tacos (because you cannot stop at just one) and I alternate between steak, carnitas, and chicken. The reason I say you cannot have just one is because the fish is lightly battered and deep fried, almost like a tempera batter that allows the fish to be very light and airy, without being oily at all. They keep the toppings simple with avocado, pickled onions, and a spicy aioli. Amazing to say the least, but you will be hooked!In addition, they make the most amazing Mint Lemonades. The syrup that they use for their lemonades is housemade and a secret recipe (if only I can get my hands on it). A small will cost $3.45 and a large is $4.45. They cut the lemons and muddle with mint for each order, which allows for the best lemonades to go down with your tacos. A unique feature in this store is the array of hot sauces (over 10 different varieties). My SO favorite is the green habanero sauce. The shop offers little containers for you to pour your favorite sauces if you had a to-go. Don't be afraid to ask.What I love about Breakroom is how they keep everything simple. Simple fish tacos with simple mint lemonades!",1,1,2

The Chinatown location is a little different for a restaurant serving this type of fare, however the prices match the location which is great to see. Onto the food, the tater tots were the real winner. Smothered in cheese, bacon, pork belly, jalapeños and topped off with an egg, they were the real deal. What's not to love about that combination, although your stomach certainly won't be thanking you later. The hotdogs and burgers were also excellent, although I found the tacos to be average. If you leave this place anything less than stuffed, you're definitely doing it wrong!This isn't a place I'd visit regularly purely due to health reasons, however it's definitely entered the cheat day rotation.",2,,1

Glad to say this statement changed over the weekend. We decided to pop in for a quick snack. Location is very small- two tables that seat around 5-6 each. The menu offered just enough to cater to all of our tastes. We ordered 2 taco trio plates (3 pork belly and 3 tempura fish) as it was cheaper than individually buying one at $4. Pork belly was delicious but my favorite hands down is the fried fish!!! It came drizzled with a slightly spicy aoili on top of slices of avocado and what I imagine to be cole slaw?? If I didn't had dinner plans that night I would've stuffed my face in more tacos. I also washed it down with passion fruit lemonade which was the perfect complement and refreshing.Can't wait to stop by again and order the breakroom fries.

Updated review","I was shopping in soho and I worked up a appetite. I decided to come back to this place for tacos. It was a whole different experience!!! The chinese girl that was taking orders was busy talking to someone at a table so I had to wait, when she realizes that I was waiting she makes her way back to the register and asks me if I'm ready lol. I placed my order 2 grilled steak tacos and I wanted to order onions rings and fries but was told that the fryer wasn't working mind you it's like 4pm. When I go to pay for my tacos she tells me it's a 15 dollar limit for credit card lmaooo maybe if your fryer was working my total would of been more then 8 dollars. I was so annoyed I just walked out she didn't care so why should I ?! Haha  definitely won't be returning here. So many other taco spots with great service no need to stress this place.",1,,
73,Nancy N.,"Irvine, CA",609,93,93,4.0,7/29/2017,"Went here for some tacos and we were not disappointed! We had the sampler platter and breakroom fries. For the sampler platter, you get to order 3 tacos. We ordered the chicken, steak, and fish. All of them were super delicious! A bit overpriced, but it is New York. The french fries were also delicious! Definitely unique and seasoned well! I loved that the restaurant had a wall full of hot sauces of many variety. As for the place, it was super small. A literal hole in the wall. We were walking up and down the street looking for the restaurant because it was squeezed right in the middle of other stores. The restaurant is a bit dark and there isn't much space to eat if it's crowded.Overall, I recommend trying this place! If you don't know which tacos to get, definitely try the platter!

76,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",212,130,1433,3.0,5/25/2017,"Breakroom is okay. After a disappointing meal at Set L.E.S., I looked around for some bougie ass tacos that would finally impress me. Enter breakroom, which serves essentially the same type of tacos and fries, but at a slightly (and I mean slightly) lower price point. It's a hole in the wall almost, with 3 tables with bar-style seats.My friend and I both decided on the taco platter, which is 3 tacos for 10.95. Of course, I also opted for the breakroom fries, to compare it to the fries at SET L.E.S.I chose the fish taco, carnitas, and steak. The fish taco was hands down the best one. A lightly fried piece of fish with an airy breaking, along with a slice of avocado and a refreshing slaw. There was a good mix of flavors and textures, and I really enjoyed this one. It comes wrapped in a freshly made tortilla (thought there would be 2 for a more authentic touch). Compared to the nasty tortilla at SET L.E.S. (Which I suspect is store bought), this tortilla was much better without that raw flour taste. The carnitas was a bit tough, and paled in comparison to the carnitas at chipotle for example. The steak was similarly chewy, and both tacos fell flat for me. If I were to get tacos here again I might just stick to the fish. The fries coke topped with a fried egg, some crispy pork belly, and cheese. This is where SET L.E.S. wins. The pork belly here was small chewy pieces, and the fried egg was kinda sad. The cheese was just cheese, and I felt overall disappointed by these fries, whereas the fries at SET were unbelievably good and generous with the toppings.Overall I probably wouldn't return there. The tacos are still quite expensive at almost $3.50 for each one, and they weren't even that good. Also the hand sanitizer machine didn't work, which sucked because tacos are super messy.",3,1,1

The patty was an average beef patty, but adding the pork belly made the meat side fattier, more chewy, and more flavorful. The onion ring and the well-done fried egg also made the burger more interesting.The jalapenos were the main things that differentiated this burger from others. These peppers added a nice hot and sour taste.Plus, the buns were firm and not soggy at all towards the end.The restaurant was quite empty at around 2:30 PM on a Saturday. Kinda hidden.

80,Sharon X.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,86,225,4.0,6/1/2017,"I always go for the Taco Platter when I'm here. During my most recent visit I chose Tempura Fish, Grilled Steak, and Chipotle Chicken. I also got a Breakroom Fries that I shared with my friends. Taco Platter: I love that they weren't stingy and were very generous in filling the tacos with a LOT of meat. Because of that, the single flour tortilla barely held everything together for each taco, which made them a little messy to eat. By no means am I complaining (because how can one even complaining about being given MORE meat), but I think going forward, doubling up on the tortilla would probably help. Breakroom Fries: It's a lot of fried goodies all in one aluminum foil pan! There are tater tots, fries, bacon, and a fried egg. I love the jalepeno slices; they give a slight kick. There aren't many seeds, so you don't have to worry about burning your tongue off.There's an array of hot sauces to choose from. However, my friends and I found that there were many bottles that were nearly/completely empty, especially the more popular ones (i.e. original Cholula and the green El Yucateco were harder to spot).",1,1,2
81,Mathangi D.,"Queens, New York, NY",63,95,124,5.0,5/8/2017,"Officially the best burger in NYC !! After guilty spree at Glossier near by, I was looking for a good cheap eat near by and found this amazing spot. The place is tiny, could seat 16. We got a sliced/chopped cheese chicken burger & teriyaki chicken taco with Milk tea. First bite into my perfectly barbecued & charred yet succulent chicken, I was lost. Paired with cheddar and other flavors, it was Christmas in my mouth. I strongly encourage that order. We actually switched the beef for chicken in that burger. Moving on to tacos, very good and flavorful as well but my adjective list still roots for the burger. Milk tea was okay. Only complaint was that our table (communal) was occupied by two, who seemed like friends of the cashier and was eating outside food which threw me off a bit but I can never complain because of the burger.",2,4,6

I'm sad to report this is just another underwhelming spot with overinflated Yelp reviews. The good:1. The tempura fish taco is pretty tasty and they don't skimp on the avocado. 2. Their milk tea is seriously refreshing on a hot day. 3. Very little wait for our food, yay! The Bad: 1. At almost $4 a taco I'm expecting some double tortilla action. Not a flimsy flour tortilla. And what's up with those tiny lime wedges? 2. All of my tacos were covered in pico de gallo, which I'm a fan of, but I felt like it took away from the individual flavors of each. 3. Don't order their cheesesteak. After living in Philly for 5 years, I was pretty pumped to see whiz in a NYC dive spot. What we got was a three day old bread and whiz cheese sandwich with a bite or two of steak. If you're gonna skimp on the meat, make sure the bread is fresh.I gotta admit I expected a bit more out of a spot with 4 1/2 stars and almost 1,200 reviews.",,,

The breakroom burger is rather messy, but that fried egg on top gives it such a great flavor.  the fries pair perfectly with any burger, and what's cool about this place is that the entire store is lined with different hot sauces from all over the world.

I got the chicken and carnitas. Both were so flavorful, with very tender meat. They don't skimp on the pico and there's 1 tortilla (versus the normal 2 around here). I've had a lot of tacos in the city, but these have to be some of my favorites. Also, it was really hard to contain my excitement when I saw the hot sauce wall.

Make sure to check the specials board, because you don't wanna miss the mac n' cheese burger or chicken bacon ranch sandwich.

Ordered the breakroom fries and their famous mint lemonade. The breakroom fries consisted of fries, tater tots, topped with egg, bits and pieces of bacon, melted cheese and jalapeños on top. Honestly, it was good however, not overly satisfied with how hyped people said it was. Mint lemonade was fairly great, had great amount of mint favor unlike other places that just place the mints inside, they squeeze the lemon juice and place the lemon inside afterwards.The place is utterly small so be ready to wait for seats but if you get it to go it doesn't take fairly long.",,,

They have high tables with tall stools. I like how they have so many different kinds of hot sauce you can try. We ordered the original burger, steak taco, pork belly taco, breakroom fries and passion fruit lemonade. My favorite is the steak taco. It has good flavors. I would recommend the breakroom fries but it is spicy. It has tater tots, fries, bacons, jalapeños and a egg. I asked for the jalapeño to be on the side but they threw it in the fries anyways. My boyfriend liked the burger. He said it was pretty good. Overall this place is a good place to stop by to grab a quick bite/snack. The prices were reasonable and the food came out fast.",1,,1

Don't overlook this little gem that spits out fire tacos, and apparently burgers as well although I have not dabbled in one yet. I had the fish tacos and a pork belly taco. Both were fantastic. The pork belly was crispy and flavorful and the fish was fresh and cooked perfectly (crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside). They top it off with what I believe is spicy mayo and picked relish along with some avocado and scallions. I washed it all down with a Mexican coke. The seating is limited but it's just enough to seat all patrons comfortably during my Monday lunchtime visit here.

Also, the owner was super sweet and kind, let us try the mint lemonade which was just as great as the tacos. He made sure we were satisfied with our food and gave us amazing service.

Believe the hype, and go here!They do have a credit/debit card limit of $15, so unless you are really hungry, bring some cash. That said, the value here is great!It was a good thing that I didn't have the cash, because to reach the $15, I bought some of their wonderful mint lemonade in addition to the taco platter.While drinking a large cup of lemonade may not have been a great idea before a five-hour long bus ride, this stuff was still pretty amazing! It had the perfect level of sweetness, was very crisp and refreshing, and the mint added a wonderful hint of a mint! (Rhyme is not intentional) They also have hot sauces galore! As a lover of hot sauces, there is a whole wall of these things!  You are bound to find a sauce that caters to your tastes. As a lover of spicy stuff, I am going to dream about this! However, I would have liked them to have their own number system that indicates how spicy a sauce is (even though there is a section for super spicy ones) As for the tacos, I had the Pork Belly, Pulled Pork, and Cheese Steak. Tacos were of a good size, while they weren't the largest I've had, they didn't fall apart from being overloaded as some tacos tend to do. Pork belly tacos were one of the best kinds of tacos I have ever had. The pork belly was so soft, tender and flavorful, I lack the words to properly describe it. There was also enough of it (they weren't skimpy with this ingredient, there was enough of it in the taco to be properly enjoyed) I will say this: when (not if) I am in NYC again, I will go back for them time and time again. Pulled pork tacos were not the greatest thing in the world, unfortunately. I found that the pulled pork was cold (second taco I ate) and it could have had slightly more flavor/seasoning. Cheese Steak was interesting. While the steak was flavorful, and cheese sauce (even though it was more like sauce) was great too, I found that these could have used just a little more steakOther fillings were good!Location is small, and you will likely share the very large table with someone. Service is polite and relatively fast!",2,1,3

Burger, cheese, jalapeño and tots. What's not to love? BF had the sesame chicken burger - disappointingly small but tasty at the same time. Looked more impressive on IG. The collection of hot sauces is very impressive so if you're a hot sauce lover it's a good place to sample some different sauces that's for sure.Service was quick and price wise it's pretty decent.

Tempura Fish Taco: So good.  Battered fish, yummy pickled onions, and a slice of avocado.  2. Breakroom nachos: LOVE these.  Ground beef and all sorts of toppings.  Breakroom is also REALLY good about substituting out the things you don't like, and the extras don't cost a whole lot.  3. Breakroom burger: Pretty sure even eating just one of these causes your arteries to turn on you.  Pork belly, egg, burger, onion ring - it's actually hard to get everything in one bite because it's so gigantic.  One of my favorite guilty pleasures. 4. Ribeye cheesesteak sandwich: Not my favorite Breakroom item but good nonetheless.  5. Breakroom fries: Every time.Normally food this indulgent doesn't turn me into Shakespeare, but Breakroom has me quoting Romeo & Juliet.  Caloric & certainly not health food, but can't be missed for a once-in-a-while meal.",,,1

I've probably been back at least a dozen or so times since that fateful day and let me tell you, every time has been as good as the first. Breakroom, I don't know what magic you put in your Tempura Fish Tacos but boy, oh, boy have you got me addicted. Seriously, guys, these are the best. damn. fish. tacos in the entire city. And anyone who knows me knows that I take my taco game v seriously, so I'd never make a statement like that without having done a lot of research (read: scarfing down random 4 am drunk tacos all over NYC like it's my job). Not only are the tacos fan-freaking-tastic, the prices are equally as appetizing. You can get 3 tacos--3 v decently-sized tacos that even a fatass like me feels sated from, for all those wondering--in a Taco Platter for under 10 bucks. Like, c'monnnn, game over. Breakroom, you win. ALSO, for all those hot sauce loving fiends like myself, you will find a whole WALL of hot sauces at your disposable at Breakroom.

The chicken was juicy not dry and the sauce was great. The fries were standard hot and delicious. Washed it all down with a sweet Mexican coke. I was stuffed after my meal and my wallet was happy at around 15$ plus tip. This was a bargain in NYC. Can't wait to try their burgers and tacos.,,,1

However there is a minimum for credit card transactions so bring some cash just incase. Had breakroom fries from some social media suggestion so had to come give it a go. Just a very simple plate of tots, fries, bacon, cheese, some garnish and jalapeños.  If you love spicy food you gotta come here just to pick out of their wall of hot sauces ranging from almost any brand you can think of. Just hope you have patience seeing as the workers there are very laid back and nonchalantly chatting or on their phone without the customers regard. There are probably better options available.",4,3,4

I ordered the breakroom fries, breakroom burger, and the tempura fish tacos. MY FAVORITE were the fish tacos hands down. A must! And the fries were super heavy but delicious (make sure you share). And I'd probably pass on the burger next time, it was alright. Not a fan of the bun. Side note: Seating can be limited so go early or at an awkward time. I also didn't see a bathroom but never bothered to ask - this place is tiny but it surprisingly had a decent amount of seats. And yes, they have hand sanitizer at the cashier area.",,,
128,Alyssa W.,"Boston, MA",443,162,791,5.0,1/12/2017,"I could always go for a taco night and this small little place on Baxter Street in Chinatown is my go-to for tacos. They're made fresh to order, inexpensive and delicious. I always go for the classic grilled steak and chipotle chicken, which go amazing with the variety of hot sauce bottles that Breakroom has (and when I say variety, I mean there are a lot of flavors and many bottles of each flavor - it's a neat display). The tempura fish taco is also really good. It comes with avocado and spicy mayo, making the taco a little healthier tasting but still so tasty - I prefer not to put hot sauce on this taco. Breakroom has a dimmer, very hip kinda sociable atmosphere, great for chilling with friends (or eating with your mom - that's what I did today).On a side note, they sell Coke in the glass bottles only, which is cute but they don't have a recycle bin for all those glass bottles.",2,,

Order in front and they'll call your name once your food is ready. Friend and I both came here on a Tuesday last month and ordered 2-3 tacos each - #TacoTuesday! I got the taco platter, which is any 3 tacos for $10.95. $3.95 per taco otherwise so you save $0.90. They give you lime wedges for your tacos. I chose to get the Tempura Fish, the Grilled Steak, and the Chipotle Chicken. Friend and I both agreed that the fish taco was the best out of the ones we tried. I enjoyed the other tacos also. I will be sure to order more fish tacos the next time I come here though!I liked the array of hot sauces they had here. One side of the wall is filled with hot sauces from left to right. Not a lot of seats here so I wouldn't really recommend for large groups to eat in. Free delivery for $15 minimum. They open at 11 AM. Did not try the fries, burgers, or drinks. I have to say that I was really tempted to get the Breakroom Fries though since a group sitting by me ordered that and it looked really good! Will definitely come back to try it.",1,,1

I was shocked to leave this place underwhelmed and disappointed. I've had this spot bookmarked for the longest time as a taco and burger lover. So the amount of positive reviews had me eager and curious. I went with a few friends and my bf and I ordered the taco platter- carne asada, pork belly, tempura fish, the breakroom burger, the chili cheese dog and the breakroom fries. I wanted to order the most popular items to get a good representation of this spot. The tacos were below average and did not compare to my favorite taco joint in the city- Los No. 1 Tacos. But fine, the place is known for their burgers right? To be the best burger in NYC? Nope... this burger lacked flavor, was dry and most definitely not the best burger in NYC. The hot dog was the better of the three and the chili was yummy. Breakroom fries were also good with cheese, a fried egg, pork belly, and jalapenos. Overall, I was definitely disappointed and still remain confused on the reviews this place has on yelp. The venue itself is super small seating max 15 people.",3,4,
133,Kylie W.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",82,23,10,5.0,1/16/2018,"One generally does not specifically go to Chinatown to get burgers and tacos, but one should definitely visit the Breakroom if you happen to be in the area and want these things.I've been twice in the past month, and I'd say it's a good bang for buck.The first time I went, I had the Breakroom burger and the Breakroom fries. While I'm not a huge fan of the bun and thought the outside of the burger could have a bit more crust, all the ingredients that went into this burger were delicious. The Breakroom fries are heart-stopper paradise, but they're also a LOT - I mean, there's fries, tater tots, jalapeños, cheese, bacon, and all the works. If I lived nearby, I would easily order a tray of these to take home and feast upon while binging some show.During my next visit, I got a taco platter (tempura fish, carnitas, and steak), and the Breakroom nachos. Out of the three tacos I had, fish is easily the winner. The fish portion is generous (you almost can't wrap the fish in its entirety with the taco tortilla but I'm not complaining), and the toppings go so nicely with it. It's a refreshing and filling taco. The steak taco was just average, and the carnitas was kinda dry in my opinion. I definitely will triple-fish-taco next time I visit. Compared to the fries, the nachos were underwhelming.tldr - get fish tacos and the breakroom fries, you won't regret itAlso, if you like spice, there are so many hot sauces to choose from that just make each visit a (sometimes painful) adventure.",1,1,

They have a minimum on the card which is understandable but I purchased $30 beforehand and forgot to buy drinks and he told me that ""the machine can't accept anything lower than that,"" which was an obvious lie (hence the 4 stars). The line was short yet he would constantly take phone calls & etc and it took us about 15 minutes to put our order in when there was only 3 people in front of us. I think they definitely are short of staff. The place is quite small. They have lots of condiments, mostly hot sauces. Breakroom Fries ($5.95)-  5/5 Runny egg, bacon, onions, cheese, jalapeños & pork belly. This is probably the best thing on the menu that is really worth trying & probably why I decided to come back again. Nachos- 4/5 This was good but I think I liked the fries better. Not the best nachos I've had but far from the worst.  Tempura Fish Sandwich ($6.95)- 3.5/5 This sandwich was okay- nothing memorable about it but it was messy.

It's wonderful to dig in and share with a friend; runs about $10. Eating here is super cheap compared to other locations and the food is really good too.

Yum! The rest of the food is great too but I definitely found myself reaching for the array of hot sauces they had available to add a tad bit more flavor. I also really liked their selection of drinks (mint lemonade, lemonade, etc) and found myself pleased with the fact that the drinks were not overwhelmingly sweet. It's a tiny place and the service was not the best but definitely not bad. You order up front and then someone brings the food to you which is always nice.

That novelty alone sets Breakroom apart from all the other neighboring Chinese restaurants that normally crowd this neighborhood. The second and most important reason is of course that they make really delicious tacos!! They also offer burgers, sandwiches and fries but TRUST ME you want to get the tacos when you come here.I ordered their special 3 taco platter, where you can pick any combination of meat taco you want out of the 3. I decided that I wanted all 3 of them to be fish tacos, since I've seen the rave reviews for them here from my fellow Yelpers. I also ordered a large side of guacamole.One shortcoming of Breakroom is that they only have one person behind the counter, and just a handful of cooks. This of course leads to somewhat slow service and orders getting backed up.Nonetheless, when my fish tacos finally came my mouth was watering! The fish is generously fried to a light crispy crust, and they add tomatoes, onions and shredded lettuce to the rest of the taco. I of course needed to request a large side of guacamole, because no taco is completely with a large dollop of avocado goodness!",10,4,6

I had the Passionfruit Lemonade which was very refreshing. Although i didn't taste a hint of passionfruit in it was still very good. The restaurant itself is very small and hard to get around when it's very packed. I went during lunch hour and by the time i left it was less packed and easier to get around.

We ordered the classic burger (+$1) for caramelized onions, breakroom fries, taco platter with carne asada, pork belly and fish, and a passion fruit lemonade. The burger was dry and not at all flavorful. The bun was over-toasted to the point where it was hard and the caramelized onions were not caramelized. Now I know a lot of burger places don't actually caramelize their onions to the point where it's soft and sweet but these onions were UNDER cooked. I should have saved my dollar. The tacos were just alright. The beef was slightly dry and the pork belly was underwhelming. The fish taco was fried well and was probably the best of the three. The break room fries was probably my favorite. It was unique with the fried egg and the mixture of fries and tater tots. This was the best part of our meal. The passionfruit lemonade was nothing special -- tasted exactly like the Tazo passion tea you can find at any supermarket. =[",,,

I had such high expectations for Breakroom after hearing awesome things about it but found myself so disappointed with the Chinatown dive.Here is what you need to know:1. It's a small spot and quite affordable. If you're looking for burgers/tacos/fries in this area, this is the go-to spot.2. It's larger than other spots like LES Kitchen. I'd say you can have a group of up to six friends fit comfortably depending on the flow of people.3. Be ready for the grease. It's one of the reasons that Breakroom lost a star. Everything was so heavy. While there is some grease expected with these foods, it was too much to a point that we weren't feeling well afterward.4. Tater tots are standard but you can also go somewhere else go get them.5. Flour tortillas for the tacos. It's just wrong. While the filling is good for what it is... FLOUR TORTILLAS. NO. NEVER. (Sorry, I'm very particular about tortillas and believe that corn is king.)6. The highlight of Breakroom is the assortment of hot sauces. They have everything and it's great.7. Food is overall pretty basic. I used a variety of hot sauces to elevate my food.Breakroom is worth checking if you're in the area and craving these foods but otherwise, I'd head somewhere else. It fulfills cravings but isn't a standout that I would trek to.",5,6,4

175,Yanni C.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,74,128,5.0,3/20/2017,"With over 1k reviews, I'm pretty sure that everything that needs to be said about Breakroom has already been said. My views about this place is pretty much in line with what everyone else has been saying. Get the tacos, get the fish taco especially. The mint lemonade is awesome, refreshing and perfect for cutting through the hearty Breakroom fries. That's all you really need to know.I lied, they have a wall of hot sauces, which is pretty cool and important at the same time. It's a small space so there's limited seating. The main reason I'm writing this review is the Breakroom fries. I love the Breakroom fries. Consider the rest of this review to be an ode to Breakroom fries because it's not just fries, it's more than that. There's a beautiful sunny side up egg on top of layers of fries AND tatter tots (because why would you ever want to choose between both). It's bits of bacon and pork belly with every bite and it's also covered in their special sauce. There's jalapenos and onions to give it a kick and this all just comes together so beautifully when you break open that egg yolk and let it spill over everything.That's it, I'm done. Get the Breakroom fries.",4,2,2

Updated review","Got some tacos and the chili cheese bacon wrapped jalapeno hotdog. As always, the tacos were delicious, but the lime pieces were smaller than ever, so didn't really get that lime zing that goes so well with their tacos.The chili cheese bacon wrapped jalapeno hotdog came with beans, which I wasn't expecting because according to Chili Appreciation Society International and Sheldon cooper, ""real chili has no beans in it."" Also, this time there were like no jalapenos in between the bacon and hotdog. Not sure if they wrap the hotdogs themselves or not, but the inconsistency is not cool. Sometimes the bacon wrapped jalapeno hotdog is so hot my mouth feels like its on fire, and other times, nothing.",1,,1
177,Ashley K.,"Paramus, NJ",164,29,16,3.0,7/11/2018,I ordered the fish tacos and the classic burger with the mint lemonade and fries. The taco was better than most places however the burger when it was delivered was cold and the bun was hard and disappointing considering I spent $11 for a burger. Would order the tacos and mint lemonade again but probably go somewhere else for a burger.,,,
178,Se C.,"Annandale, VA",238,402,702,5.0,8/11/2016,"I've been here two times and both times, the tacos were fantastic. It may be a little pricey for 1 small taco, but they pack a lot of flavors. Seats very limited number of people. Go here for tacos!",2,,1
179,Dawn H.,"Queens, NY",19,91,340,4.0,10/31/2016,"It's a tiny cozy place when you walk in, has like 4 tables for seating. Ordered the break room burger, tater tots, fish taco, tempura avocado burger and lemonade. The break room burger was layered with a juicy patty, pork belly, runny egg and other toppings. The burger was layered so well and intact. Burger was a good size.Tater tots came with this spicy mayo sauce, lightly drizzled on. Was very crispy on the outside and soft but has textured on the inside, PERFECTLY made! Wasn't super greasy, I liked mine with ketchup and sriracha.Fish toco was amazing! Fish was fresh and deep fried in tempura. Was a good amount of toppings and sauce, would go back for this.The avocado burger was a disappointment, it looked nice but the avocado was so bland! Wasn't much sauce in it. Careful when u eat it, I ate the burger last and the tempura avocado was still very hot. Bread was very soft.The lemonade was very refreshing and wasn't overly sweet, had a lot of lemon wedges in it Overall this place is worth the try. Oh! Did I mention they have a variety of hot sauces to choose from?",,,
180,Ruth K.,"Newtown Square, PA",80,132,491,4.0,3/10/2017,"With all of the great ratings it received, I had to try this place for myself! Because we already had plans to eat elsewhere, my boyfriend and I stopped by to get an ""appetizer."" We both got a single taco- carnitas taco and the pork belly taco. It was so fresh and delicious, I seriously wanted to get a couple more! I had to control my appetite and save room for dinner, so we ended up leaving with a taste of their tacos. I honestly can't wait to go back and try their tater tots and other tacos. They've got limited seating, and and it seems like a hipster-ish place in Chinatown. It's kind of random but I like that it's within reach. The price here isn't too bad either, so it's a win-win! You'll notice they have a whole stand of hot sauces too which is a plus. Must have hot sauces for tacos- duh! I also want to try their homemade drinks. They sounded pretty good! I am definitely coming back to try other things on their menu!",3,4,1
181,Olivia K.,"Queens, NY",80,151,359,4.0,8/11/2016,"Breakroom specializes in burgers & tacos. [One of the non-asian food places in Chinatown]Menu: They have quite a few options to choose from. It seems like their breakroom burger & taco platter are the most popular. I deviated from that and got myself a tempura avocado sandwich. This is a vegetarian option. Although I myself am not a vegetarian, it seemed pretty good. It's basically a sandwich with fried avocado (with lettuce/tomato). For me, I wasn't totally full after eating this. But, it was enough not to feel hungry. They do have the option to add toppings for $1 if anything (mac n' cheese is a good add-in).I also got to try the breakroom fries. Decent amount of fries/tater tots inside. It also has a sunny side up egg with a medium (?) spicy sauce. Very filling. You can probably get pretty full off of this. It's a decent food option around the area. Not to mention, the prices ranges from roughly $5-10. The only downside is that the place is quite small. However, I had no issues with seating. Found seats right away when I walked in with friends around 1:45-2pm.",1,1,
182,Jean Claire G.,"Queens, NY",775,429,1999,4.0,6/4/2016,"I finally had a chance to try this place. I randomly came here for dinner. The place is small with a few long tables & chairs. Drink:sweet lemon tea large for drinks $3.95- they use the real lemon & its refreshing!Food:Fries $6.95- big platter of fries with cheese, bacon & egg. Can definitely share with 2 people. Yummy!Tacos plater(pick any 3 flavors) $9.95- fish, steak & pork. For that price its delicious & totally worth it.Burger $9.95- it was huge, meat is tender & juicy. Workers are really nice. You order it in the counter & they bring the food to you. I'm glad I went! I enjoyed my meal. I'll definitely go back when I'm around the area!",10,7,12

I love this place. It's so good and filling and fattening lol. The owner is cool. He was there one day and I didn't even realize who he was until I noticed he was the man in all the pictures. You can't go wrong and definitely try the different hot sauces.,,,

It was Cinco de Mayo and I had gotten off at Canal St to walk home. Yelp search showed this place within a few hundred feet. Done. Casual, good vibes in here with a nice playlist. Pretty small place but looked like half the patrons who stopped in worked in the area and took their orders to go. I ordered the 3 taco platter that was $9 something -- 3 fish plz.My tray was brought to me timely. Loved the larger than usual soft taco shell that encompassed all the ingredients without leakage. The fish was a nice size and had a light and crisp batter. The fixings included slaw, avocado and chipotle mayo, all in the appropriate amounts for an excellent bite. I enjoyed the taco immensely, x3.Will definitely be back when in the mood for tacos -- often.",8,3,10
187,Andrew R.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,10,6,5.0,6/2/2018,We went there with my friend after a gym. Yelp showed us a burger place. I thought it's fast food but it wasn't! Amazing Breakroom Burger!

188,Kelly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",286,165,249,4.0,9/12/2016,I was looking for a good burger spot for my trip to NY and came across this place on Yelp! I ordered the break room burger and breakroom fries. The burger was good. It had a good balance of flavors. That jalapeño pepper is definitely spicy. I liked the addition of the crispy pork belly. The fries were alright. I liked the crispy tater tots but the fries themselves were too soggy for my liking. The cheese overpowered! I don't think the egg adds anything to the taste. It just looks super delic in pictures when there's an egg on top.,,,

Got a fish tempura, grilled steak, and pork belly. Couldn't tell which one was my favorite. Loved them all. Definitely come to this place especially if you like hot sauce. They have all these different sauces which are unique and have a different type of kick ass to it. Seating is very difficult since it's a small place. Must try for foodies.",3,2,4

[YOU DA REAL MVP MIKE D.!] #too #ble$$ed #way #upNow onto the review! My foodie buddy and I ordered a Pork Belly Burger, Breakroom Fries, and $10 for 3tacos(Grilled Steak, Cheese Steak, & Fish Tempura). Everything, like I stated before, was amazing. Regardless of whether you're drunk, high, or neither, a fulfilling in-house eating experience is guaranteed. The food came out pretty fast, btw.The Pork Belly Burger was juicy, and flavorful. The ingredients went very well with each other. Loved the vibrant yellow color of the runny egg yolk. The juices of the burger did not drip with a sudden rush, but steadily. Uplifting. Decided to take the recommendation of fellow Yelpers and ordered the well liked Breakroom Fries! Share this with your friend! For ~$7, you get a sexy aluminum tray of fries, and tater tots topped with a runny egg, drizzled with chipotle sauce, and garnished with Jalapeños. This, my friends, is what I like to call a work of art. Lmao what am I saying. #tryingtosoundlikeanartist #i #use #too #many #hashtags Tacos($10 for 3): Got the Fish Tempura, Cheese Steak, & Pork Belly. All were delicious and each were well worth the $10/3, which comes out to... I'm not even going to calculate it. Just no. I highly, highly recommend the Fish Tempura Taco(fish filet deep tried in batter topped with an avocado) no matter what. I promise that I'm not doing you wrong and you're doing your foodie self a favor. (; Don't forget to buy yourself a drink, or else you'll get thirsty. My foodie buddy took ages to finish her Pork Belly Burger because she was thirsty as hell from all the overwhelming goodness. Breakroom does give free water, so just ask. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Prices are pretty decent and affordable, especially during Happy Hour($2 select tacos, $3 select beer--f*ck yeah!). Foodgasm guaranteed!",10,10,7

Fries got a little soggy because they're so loaded but that's to be expected. Definitely get a fork.

I order them with the Breakroom tots (Breakroom fries but with tater tots instead) and mmmm my tummy is happy. Definitely get the mint lemonade too. It's a dollar cheaper during happy hour from 4-6 Monday through Thursdays.Wish it was a bigger space because sometimes it can get packed, but the last few times I've been there, it was fine. Probably gonna become one of my regular spots since I'm always in the area",3,1,
