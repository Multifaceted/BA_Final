0,Justin R.,"Hoboken, NJ",315,6,3,5.0,3/30/2018,"Avi was great! I got locked out of my car (first time in my life I forgot my key inside) and called a friend- he recommended Artist locksmith services. Avi responded to the call quickly, the service was also quick and efficient! Felt like I had to leave a good review, will be recommending to my friends as well. Thanks Avi!",,,
1,Fabrice E.,"New York, NY",2,13,0,4.0,6/17/2018,"Fast and efficient locksmith. According to what I've found online (but haven't tried others quote), they are on the expensive side :Service Call 35$ - OKPrice new mechanism 240$ - that was the expensive part, I'm finding mechanism for half the priceLabor ( remove and install) 195$ - rather expensive but the change was important.= 450$However they did a good job and were courteous.Next time, I will learn how to change a lock :)",,,
2,Lauren D.,"West Islip, NY",180,2,0,3.0,3/17/2018,Was locked out (wasn't turning the key correctly) and the guy fixed it immediately and was clearly annoyed. Asked me for $20 and told me he deserves a good review. So here it is!,,1,

4,Renisha R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,5.0,3/28/2018,"I contacted Artist Locksmith and Security (ALS) to install new locks and repair a faulty strike plate. Avi responded within an hour, and provided an estimate and same day service. Simply stated, Avi is knowledgeable, prompt and reasonably priced, so save yourself time by contacting ALS for your security needs.",,,

Updated review",Was in need of fixing a malfunctioning security camera at my parents' house last week and got a recommendation for this company. My parents are elders and they didn't want to fix the camera because it seemed too complex for them- but Avi was nice enough to make sure they understood every step of the way and he also gave them a few tips on how to handle these issues again in the future! I was very satisfied with Avi's quick service and especially the prices!!,,,
7,Jennifer A.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",131,1,1,5.0,7/23/2017,"Avi was awesome! We just moved to a new apartment 3 weeks ago and decided to change the lock.My cousin recommended artist locksmith, Avi arrived with everything in his bag pack! the prices were reasonable and affordable and the service was amazing less than 30 minutes and we already had a new lock on the door with a new set of keys!",,,
8,Cici M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,4.0,8/10/2017,"I used these guys twice, for modifying my security window bars (first floor apartment) to accommodate window air conditioners. Avi is super responsive and the work got done fast. They did exactly what I needed, for a fair and reasonable price! Only reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is that the second time I worked with them, the welder was hard to get ahold of over the phone and it delayed the work a bit, but once Avi took over communication, things got figured out quickly. Overall, high quality of work, efficiency and great value! Definitely recommend.",,,
