Updated review","Thank you to the brothers and the sister (all owners) for always being so kind and respectful towards me.  They do treat you like family here once they know you as a regular and you have conversated many times with the owners.  I love you Brothers Bakery and as of October 2018 you have gotten even better!       Please let's support this wonderful addition that was much needed here in Spanish Harlem presisely at that corner where it now stands.  Trust me, I was born and raised one block from here on East 112th Street between 2nd & 1st Avenues and I know how bad this area WAS!!! If you don't like this place it's most likely because you are an ENTITLED outsider yuppy.    A los dueños de Brother's Bakery, muchas gracias por siempre ser tan servicial, y tratar al cliente como primordial.  -Noel.",2,1,2

2,Dimitri M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",58,11,8,5.0,7/1/2018,"I love this place! I order DELIVERY Usually from here and it's always been great. I get a Cobb salad , fruit bowl, breakfast burrito, chicken nuggets, and omelettes...usually. It all comes delivered neatly packaged and always ahead of time. It is my go-to spot for delivery in the morning. I've never been let down. The Cobb salad always has the perfect amount of bacon and blue cheese. Love this place for AM delivery. I went to the actual place and saw that they are usually very busy yet somehow they are able pump out food like pro's. This place is super busy and for the that I have to give them 5 stars. Definitely going to be ordering from them again and again. This is the breakfast/lunch spot.Also if the food isn't seasoned the way you want it...use the handy salt and pepper packets they give you on the side ;)",1,,1

Both times I called, I was told that they were running a little behind because of the rain. Their business is not far from my home nor was the rain terrible today. The woman I spoke with did not seem to be interested in speaking with me or to hear what I had to say. I then stated I wanted a refund. I get that things happen, but if you truly cared for your customers you would have made a call to me and stated that you were running behind- maybe then I would have been a bit more understanding.",,,

I ordered a banana walnut muffin, the farm (egg wrap with chicken and mozzarella) and a coffeePros:- Quick service. I ordered and was served immediately. Did not experience a wait.- Inexpensive. Everything is reasonably priced. The egg wrap was $7, coffee was $2, can't remember how much the muffin was- Clean establishment- Good tasting food! Cons:- Some staff are friendly, some aren't.Overall, I would come back out of convenience. Wouldn't go out of my way for this place",1,,1

They ALWAYS take EXTREMELY long when preparing food (although it's good). Unfortunately today was the last purchase for me I purchased a chilli. The menu price is $5.59 & the registrar price was $6.45.At first she tried to tell me it was the taxes then she said the price points POSTED ""we're old"" u have got to be kidding. (she was suppose to be the owner btw).Once a place starts to change prices it's time for me to move on you can't cheated ppl out of there money because You Don't wanna update ur signage.

Updated review","I never had a issue with this place until recent. My order was a whole hour late and everything was cold, I had to reheat everything. Then I ordered a berry fruit bowl and it was half full yet I was charged almost $6 for it. I hope this wont be a on going issue if so I will never order from here again. The only thing that was perfect was my mango pineapple smoothie. Not sure if I'll be returning.",,,1

The lady that took my order said 7 minutes and I waited 10 minutes before arriving and still had to wait an additional 10 minutes just for someone to charge my order. Then I come home to this moldy dessert... never again ordering from this place,1,,

Of course we both got bagels and coffee. You order at the counter and there is bar and booth seating. Our order came out momentarily and the coffee was nice and hot.I chose the everything bagel and it did not disappoint. It had a generous schmear of cream cheese and toasted to perfection. The coffee was fine and got the job done right. While we were eating at the window bar, we noticed many people meeting for breakfast. Overall, we had a good experience!",2,1,1

20,Eleanor S.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",147,9,0,2.0,5/20/2018,"Definitely need a place *like* Brother's in the neighborhood but I don't know how a place can be so slow, continuously get orders wrong, and still stay in business.

21,Sasha G.,"New York, NY",601,553,333,4.0,12/11/2015,"This is a great place to have in El Barrio. Located two avenue blocks away from my job, it's a great spot to grab a chai and salad whenever I need an escape from teacher work room sugary snacks. The chai is a pre-made concoction that contains too much sugar & not enough chai but it's definitely the best (if not only) chai in the neighborhood. The salad I had here (Cobb) was pretty phenomenal. It had actual bacon (rather than sad bacon bits), real slices of avocado (so real that the guy making it camouflaged a piece of the avocado skin in my salad blending perfectly well with the lettuce hence -1 star), mostly fresh lettuce, hard boiled egg, grilled chicken (tasty & seasoned), and a generous amount of blue cheese. Served up with a light vinaigrette. Overall I was super pleased with this salad considering I've paid the same elsewhere for a far worse salad. Their croissants (& other breakfast pastries) tend to be on the greasy side. Sometimes I grab one of their croissants at Uptown Roasters, a freshly roasted coffee cafe I frequent in the mornings. A decent croissant but nothing to drool over. This cafe deserves a solid 3/4 stars for being the only one like it in this hood and although their prices are a bit high for this neighborhood they do offer MUCH better quality than the standard corner bodega you're likely to see around here.",4,,

Choosing the pie is probably the hardest task, but almost all of them have been amazing so far. Apart from the food, which is great, this is also a particularly comfortable place to eat, and I fear that once it is discovered it is going to be swamped by people just hanging out. Also the people running it are as pleasant as can be.",1,,1
24,Aaron G.,"North Myrtle Beach, SC",0,294,1,5.0,1/21/2017,"A great Manhattan cafe, in my experience.I happened upon Brother's on a chilly January afternoon, in search of some good espresso to go with my lunch (and a warm, comfortable place to consume both). As it were, this shop was exactly what I wanted: fresh, especially delicious coffee served by fast, professional folks, along with a dining room that was clean and homey (and rather spacious by Manhattan standards -- there were booths, even!). Once I got my Americano, I nestled down at a table and proceeded to eat and drink and read, feeling at peace with the world -- success! It was truly a cut above your typical inner-city Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts, and I liked it so much, I returned a couple days later, repeating the fun.My sincere thanks goes out to all associated with this business. I am grateful for, and have benefited from, your work and service. Keep it up, guys and gals!",1,,1
25,Doran B.,"Manhattan, NY",15,20,1,2.0,9/4/2017,"I order from here often, so I know that quality is usually great. Not the case the other day. The two omelettes I ordered were unusually tiny (two eggs only!), but they still charge $8+ for them. Also, my omelette had eggshell in it. I also ordered two hot coffees and got iced instead. I called and was sent two new coffees, but I was unable to get the other half of either omelette. I added a star because the woman on the phone at Brother's was very professional and accommodating. However, the food was very sub-par and expensive, and the incorrect coffee, though fixed, was inconvenient. I don't think I'll be ordering from here again.",,,

If you are on your way to work and you're in the area, Brother's is a good choice for hot coffee, iced coffee, teas or juice. Whatever you crave, Brother's probably has it. The owner/manager is very nice and helpful and Jazmine, the girl at the counter is very friendly and kind.

Updated review",Never order delivery from this restaurant. They will cancel your order instead of actually delivering to your apartment- never mind if it's prepaid or tipped. That is terrible customer service. I gave them a second try. Last time.,1,,
32,Cindy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,13,2,1.0,11/5/2017,"When this bakery first opened up in east Harlem, it was great. However after being open for some time, they really started to lack in time management and organization. I've ordered from here many times since I work nearby and they continuously get orders wrong. How hard is it to follow instructions that are written in grubhub?! And they get pissy whenever you call them back and told them they've made a mistake. They ask, are you sure? Yes, I ordered a sandwich without meat and you gave me one with meat. And they charge you extra to get what you actually wanted in the first place. Today was the absolute last draw. I put in an order for pick up and got there a little earlier to pick up. I even told the lady behind the counter I was there so she knew. I waited 40 minutes for my food. 40 minutes!! People who ordered in store got their good quicker than I did! What's the point in putting in an order early if it's quicker to order in store? They didn't even apologize and just told me it was really busy. I understand if you're busy, but at least check in with me and say you're sorry or something, and that you're working on my order. I would've been more content if there was at least some communication with me. I've been a frequent customer since Brother's has opened, but I'm never coming here ever again.",,,

Finally one of their staff members says oh we are busy... I'm like busy?! There was a line and EVERYONE got their food and left and the place was empty and I STILL didn't have my food. I Had to cancel a class I paid for because I was now running late and wouldn't make it on time. Trust me when I say DO NOT GO HERE EVER! Food itself is overpriced and sub par ingredients.

First, it's worth mentioning just how friendly the staff is. The girl who works the counter in the morning is simply delightful and brightens your day. She knows everything about the menu and how they make their baked goods - I love talking to her! Coffee is great - I've been starting my day with a red eye, packing in the punch! All of their baked goods are made onsite, fresh every day. There are tons of unique options to choose from like red velvet cake and carrot cake muffins to mini cheesecakes. The brunch menu is robust - everything from omelets to breakfast burritos to pancakes - and there's tons of seating to actually sit and enjoy your meal.

Updated review",There are more than a few times when I go in and have to wait 15 minutes for my order because they make as the orders come. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and bacon and it took over 10 minutes for my order. I missed 3 busses thinking it was going to take no more than 5 minutes. It doesn't take long to slap on some cream cheese in a bagel and add the precooked bacon. I'll be coming here less.,,,

48,Abhi D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,2.0,2/17/2016,"I work from home 2 days a week so I always order a late-morning bagel/lox/coffee from this place via Seamless. The food's not amazing but it is decent and reasonably reliable so I figure why not. Establish a loyalty-based relationship. Apparently they don't feel quite the same way. Seamless' website is down today so I called in my order and was told that the *exact* same order I've been making 2-3 times a week for the last four or five months is 50 cents short of the minimum for delivery. The person on the phone told me that it's OK via Seamless but somehow when the order is being made using one's voice, it's totally different. I get minimum delivery requirements. I really do. What I don't get is the same order I've been making for months somehow being inadequate when it's over the phone. And when I asked to speak to the owner/manager about the policy (intending little more than a firm but entirely polite suggestion), I clearly heard the phone person speak to said owner/manager in the background and then she comes back to say that he's not in. When I just heard her speak to him. So, hey, unreasonable stubbornness merits unreasonable stubbornness in return. Brother's, you just lost my 2-3 orders a week over 50 cents. Congratulations. Coffee and bagels aren't that hard to find in New York City.",3,,1

58,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/13/2015,Great addition to the neighborhood. I've stopped in several times and it has always been a pleasant experience. The staff is wonderful and the food is delicious.,1,,1
59,Lena P.,"Manhattan, NY",11,52,94,1.0,8/24/2015,"This place is cute and looks clean.. And that's why I kept coming here for my pick up lunches. It's just 2 blocks away from us and I could be eating here everyday since I eat out a lot. But many things here don't make sense and never have I gotten a right order from them. It feels like they are ''playing restaurant'' in here and when there is an issue there is never a manager to talk to, even his/hers NAME is a very private information.I usually get an egg whites wrap which it's supposed to come with cheese and vegetables. I get home and it's missing my vegetables. Funny thing I was trying to eat healthy, and this was just full of melted bland cheese in a wrap with very little egg whites in it. And because it's so small I usually get a salad too. Everything comes in small sizes. You look at their menu and you think wow !! food is not very expensive here, but then you get it and it's the smallest sandwich or salad you will see. With the price you pay for the few pieces of veggies to put on your salad it adds up and it's not so cheap anymore. Not to mention the tiny container with dressing for salad that only covers three of my spinach leaves. When I asked for extra dressing I was charged for it, and when I got home there was no dressing whatsoever in my to go order. Not even the one I PAID for. One star for the wi-fi. The staff in the front are nice but that doesn't fix my order. ''Sorry'' it's all you will get and another messed up tiny wrap or salad with missing ingredients that they charge extra for.This was my last attempt of another chance given to this place. Since all I end up with every time I come here is a major frustration in the middle of my day off, I will avoid this place and check out the new ones in the neighborhood. There are plenty other options around to waste your money on nonsense !!",,,
60,Rebecca R.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,10,0,4.0,9/22/2015,I always order from this place the food is good and I especially like their fries. The only thing annoying is sometimes the delivery guy comes straight to my door and others he makes me come downstairs to get it. But overall the food is great and offers a nice selection.,,,
61,Venessa F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,3.0,9/26/2016,"I've been a fan of this establishment since it opened, however lately the quality of the food and the workers has decreased. Chicken burrito barely has chicken, chicken soup is mostly broth and vegetables, pancakes are undercooked and bacon is so burnt it's not edible.  Gave an order to one of the young ladies, my order was very clear and specific. It was still given to me wrong- not once but twice. If I do continue to make purchases at this bakery, I'll keep it to the simple stuff.",,,
62,Gabriela A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,3,1.0,7/23/2015,BEWARE EVERYONE! The baked goods from this place was absolutely disgusting. It tastes as if it was really old and the cheesecake was really hard. I almost vomited from how gross it was. I am never ordering from this place again!,,,
63,A B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,3.0,4/28/2016,"It's great to finally have a clean, decent cafe in this area, but I really wish they had ready made sandwiches and other things that you can just pay for and leave. They have some ready made items, but it's only things like yogurt/fruit. If you want a sandwich or salad you have to order it, and they can be very slow. Kind of annoying when you just want to quickly grab some lunch on your way to work in the morning.",,,
64,R W.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,7/4/2015,"I ordered delivery. The salad was fresh and delicious, the panini was great, and the desserts were amazing.",1,,1
65,M C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,6/21/2015,"Fresh made cookies are delicious! I've had several different items, salad, sandwich, bagel, and the food is consistently yummy? Great addition to the neighbor.",1,,1
