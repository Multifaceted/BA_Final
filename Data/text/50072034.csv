The second band was Meg Farrel & Friends, the lead singer reminded me of Loretta and Linda very classic country it was such a great treat!Recommend this place for sure and I'll be back a few times for sure!",1,,1
1,Adam B.,"Newport News, VA",444,520,22,4.0,6/6/2018,"I'm so glad NYC has a venue like this in the heart of Manhattan. I had tickets to see Lee Roy Parnell, and I was surprised the upstairs venue was only about a third full. I took a seat by myself and drank a couple of Blue Point toasted lagers. Credit to them for having this beer on draft. I also had smoked wings for an appetizer, and I could really sense the strong smoke flavor. These are some messy wings, with a bold, heavy BBQ sauce. But they are still really good. If you're going to eat here, I'd recommend getting some kind of smoked meat, whether it's wings, ribs, etc. After the show was over, I went downstairs to Floors 2/3. They had a cover band called Nashville Attitude who would play 3-4 songs live, then they'd take a break and a few country videos from past and present would play on the monitors. I drank the Broadway to Broadway, which is basically sweet tea vodka and lemon vodka with regular iced tea and lemon. And folks, these aren't cheap cocktails, everything is $16. Thankfully, because I had purchased a ticket for the upstairs show, I got a 20 percent discount.The merchandise is pretty good, nothing that really knocked me out, but the management is doing a good job at making the OCS feel as authentic as possible.",1,1,1
2,Joe R.,"Chatham, NJ",0,25,0,2.0,5/30/2018,The only real positive about our experience at Opry City Stage was the decor and overall vibe of the restaurant.  The two stars is for the food.  We would've had a better meal at Pret a Manger for 1/3 of the price.  The chicken fingers and pulled pork tasted like shop rite brands.  Very disappointing.,,,
3,Corinne B.,"Hoboken, NJ",314,123,196,5.0,9/27/2018,"This is an excellent venue/restaurant/bar! I recently went here for a birthday party and it was such a great time. There was plenty of room for us to have a large table as the restaurant is many floors. It was a Tuesday night, and there was live country music to listen to, sing-along, and even dance! I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket entrée, the sweet tea drink with alcohol, and I would definitely definitely recommend the monkey bread for dessert. They brought the monkey bread out at the end of the meal with sparklers for our friends birthday, it was an excellent surprise and fun all around. The Opry is true to theme. We actually dressed up in Western attire for this party, though that would not be necessary for us to eat there. As the location is in Time Square, it is very easily accessible from public transportation such as port authority, and Grand Central, and the subways.",,,1
4,FakeFoodBabyNY C.,"Brooklyn, NY",402,515,1149,4.0,9/16/2018,$4 beers during #happy hour. Good free live music. It's a good place to drink if you're stuck in Times Square for some reason during the hours of 4-7pm. The place feels a lot like a Hard Rock Cafe. I was expecting it to look old school country. I don't think this place is going to last long. #Come while it still exists ...but only during the hours of 4-7pm.,1,1,2
5,Trevor M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,176,260,4.0,2/11/2018,"Definitely the place to try if you're into southern comfort food and country music.The fried chicken sandwich, pulled pork, cheese spread on a biscuit, sausage gumbo, sausage on a biscuit, and mini salmon toast were all delicious. The fried chicken sandwich particularly was my favorite and had quite a spicy kick as well. The way the venue is set up gives every table a great view of the stage no matter which floor you're sitting on and the live country band was solid. The only real downside is that the place is located outside Times Square and the prices certainly reflect it.",2,,
6,Alina V.,"New York, NY",237,246,591,4.0,2/17/2018,"I had a chance to come here for a yelp event to check out the space and sample their food and I had a really great time. The space is quite large with multiple floors overlooking a stage. They have country singers performing every now and then and in between performances they play country music with the music videos accompanying them on large projector screens. We had the chance to sample their house wines, the gumbo, the pulled pork sandwiches, the crispy chicken sandwiches, biscuits with sausage cheese and gravy, small bites of salmon and cream cheese on toasted bread, as well as a selection of their desserts. Everything was very good and overall I had a really good time. The service also was very friendly and great explaining what each dish was! I had a chance to glance at their sit down dinner menu and it's definitely on the pricy side but I guess your paying for the performance with that. Definitely a spot to check out nonetheless and enjoy a night of country music!",1,,
7,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,4.0,12/22/2017,"Popped in here to check it out last Saturday and as figured it was crowded! I was pleasantly surprised with the venue it has a full kitchen and bar, two levels of seating, bar seats, a stage for performances, and TVs playing well country of course! The main room isn't big but the high ceiling makes it look huge, but to be honest, the setup isn't good. There were a ton of people waiting to be seated standing outside the main room and on the steps and since there is no standing room at the bar. They packed the room with tables which gives you no room to stand and drink at the bar, I was constantly bumping into the tables, servers, and people. They either need to get rid of the tables where the bar is or push some of them down further so people can have a drink while they wait like most restaurants allow. There was a live band playing classics like Geoge Jones, but there were tables on what looked like a dance floor so if you wanted to get up and share a dance with your cowboy you couldn't, not sure if those tables get moved after a certain time, since it was around 7:30 when I was there. Overall I think it's a cool place very different for NYC, so I hope it works out, especially if they start bringing in some known singers/bands. Can't wait to see how this place does, just be prepared for a wait if you want to eat!",2,,
8,Jason G.,"Astoria, New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,10/3/2018,"I had so much fun at Opry City Stage. My wife and I left the kids behind for a date night and it was Tuesday Two-Step Night. We had dance lessons during the band's break and then would go back and eat and drink. After we were done eating, we danced to the band. It was an experience that we couldn't have anywhere else in NYC. The food was also great and the staff was friendly. Here is a review I wrote about the restaurant: thejasongreene.com/2018/…",,,
9,Joseph S.,"Chicago, IL",172,182,235,5.0,2/9/2018,"If you want a feel of the south, that's your spot!Located in midtown, Huge space, multiple levels, Great music, live bands, Great drinks and some really good food.For 2 or 3 hours, you'll feel like you're in Nashville, enjoying some country music and eating southern food.The staff is very friendly, and provide a quick service.I really recommend this spot for a fun date night or fun night out with a bunch of friends who really want to enjoy some good music and good food.",,,
10,Terry H.,"Deltona, FL",2,58,30,5.0,5/28/2018,"Stopped in for lunch and decided to try the bbq and grits. Living in the South, it's rare to find great grits up north but figured I would live dangerously. Lol.  Great place. Great service and wow the grits! Best i have ever had. Simply amazing. The BBQ you ask? Not bad. It was pretty good for northern bbq, lol.For dessert the banana pudd is ng (with rum) is a MUST TRY! WOWZA.Ask for Stephanie as your server. Great service!",1,,1
11,Christina S.,"Huntington, NY",164,79,463,5.0,5/12/2018,"I went into Opry City Stage with hopeful, yet low expectations mainly due to its location. This is most definitely not your typical Times Square Restaurant. The experience from start to finish, and the food, was absolutely incredible. Excellent service, live country music, and delicious southern cooking. I tried the Mac and Cheese ($12.50), Brisket Burnt Ends with Grits ($23), and the Corn Pudding ($8.50). The portions were generous, and we had dinner with a wonderful show featuring a country cover band called The Nashville Attitude. I was dancing in my seat all through dinner. Can't wait to come back to Opry City Stage and try more items on the menu!",1,,
12,renje g.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,1038,4,4.0,3/15/2018,"- A few more visits here, I might actually like country music- The environment is infectious- Kind of expensive but what do you expect in Times Square- Gumbo was good, but I was sitting next to a guy actually from Nashville and he said it wasn't spicy enough- Fun part is, live concerts at any moment",3,1,2
13,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",1547,761,1732,4.0,3/27/2018,"Country music always has a fan base in any city you are in so it's great to see the opry city stage in nyc. Great 4 level space with a live stage on the 2nd floor and 4th floor. It's great for private events but also a wonderful place for some grub and wonderful live music playing throughout the day.Food is provided by Blue Ribbon so you know it will be good. Highlights at our table were the fried chicken sliders, pimento sausage on biscuits, pulled pork sliders, hummingbird cake, and monkey bread. Definitely a great space for happy hour, grabbing some eats, and listening to country music throughout the day.",1,,2
14,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",362,209,333,4.0,3/22/2018,"This is a good place depending on what you are looking for. I'm not a mid-town kind of person myself, so I'm pretty off put by most places in that area. THAT BEING SAID- this venue is gorgeous.Plenty of space, and very clean. Not my style of music, but that's the beauty of music and art.The food was pretty good. I don't know if I'll make a special trip to come eat here but dinner and a show is a nice luxury.Drinks are moderately expensive here (food ain't cheap either) but if this is your type of crowd- go for it.",1,,1
15,Bernice M.,"New York, NY",2,14,56,4.0,4/20/2018,"I gave Opry City Stage four stars because the venue is awesome, most of the food was good, but the service was subpar.I went with 12 friends for brunch at 12:30 on a Sunday. We expected to still do a breakfast/lunch option, but only got the lunch menu. There were not many people there and we got seated right next to the stage. *Note: you can only be seated when everyone in your party was there, even if the restaurant is basically empty.They have a live band that played multiple sets for the two hours that we were there.As an appetizer, it came with biscuits/delicious butter and we ordered monkey bread for the table, which was soooooo good!I ordered a cocktail, the harmonica. $16 and was basically the size of a double shot glass... it was good, but I don't believe it was worth the price.I ordered the brisket ""burnt ends"" from the lunch menu, I liked the grits. I would suggest asking for the barbecue sauce on the side as it was too much. If you order the pulled pork, my friend suggests the same.My problem with the service was minor at first, but little things like our server's lack of ""southern hospitality,"" clearing dishes and handing out steak knives across the table, having a blade too close to our faces for comfort, when the restaurant was empty, were things I frown upon, but was willing to let go. We were likely done in a little over an hour but the waitress, Valentina, never came back to check in on us.  We waited another 45 minutes or so, enjoying our time with our friends before realizing how ridiculous it was, so we finally had to ask another waitress/manager to get her. She sent our check and an excuse with the other waitress. I couldn't even get someone to help me wrap up my leftovers. Gratuity was included, otherwise I wouldn't have given her nearly as much.Regardless, I would still return for maybe a beer and enjoy the live music/atmosphere. I appreciate how country music is building in this awesome city and I want to support it!",1,,
16,Christian R.,"Miramar, FL",458,214,1123,4.0,1/16/2018,A few blocks away from Times Square you will find the Opry City Stage. Far enough that there isn't immense foot traffic but close enough that it is still convenient.I ordered the meatloaf dinner which was pretty good. It came with a side of potatoes and green beans. The green beans were delicious they were definitely cooked in bacon fat because it had a hearty flavor.The best part of this place is the live country music being played the whole time you are there. The band named CC and the Boys were very entertaining and she has a lovely voice. Between sets they play music videos around the restaurant of popular country songs.If you're looking for something a little different and you enjoy country music this is a great spot. The food was above average but the entertainment is worth the pricing of the meals. This place seems to be new and not packed yet so enjoy it while you can!,9,3,5

Updated review","Came back after a month or so to give it another try.  Same feelings as before.  And a bad sign.  Middle of happy hour, yet entire bar area empty but for ten people on entire floor.  Don't think will make it longterm here.  Biggest issue is food is way overpriced even for area and the promised live music only shows up once every 30-40 mins, plays a 10 minute set, and leaves.",1,,
18,Michiru K.,"New York, NY",105,68,104,5.0,2/15/2018,"Came here for a yelp event.Pros:- Great live music! They play a good mix of current and old country music- Huge Place! Three stories, lots of seats to go around. They also have elevators so it's handicap friendly.- Good food! I had an array of appetizers and desserts: jumbo, fried chicken sliders, deviled eggs, cookies, cakes, monkey bread, and lots more! Honestly all were hits. No complaints- Cute decor, definitely playing up the country vibes- Convenient location, right by the QRW- Friendly staff, very warm and hospitable!Cons:- Can get pretty loud.

But when there is a dinner w/ a show, the dinner quality tends to suffer... however, the foods that we tried here were pretty great!fried chicken sliders - AMAZING. best item of the night. the chicken was fried perfectly between tender/juicy and crispy. yum.Pulled pork sliders- good stuff. typical pulled pork sliderChicken and Sausage Gumbo- also tasty Good had a nice kick to itdesserts - Monkey Bread w/ Ice cream dayum that was THICC but good. kinda a bit sweet for me but still good.  they also had several types of cake which were all pretty good!overall, if you appreciate country music and even if u don't, this place seems like a fun place to eat some good food with fun vibes",1,1,
20,Michelle M.,"New York, NY",46,26,10,5.0,12/23/2017,"My favorite new spot in the city for live music, great food/drinks, incredible service, (shout out to our amazing server Brian), in a truly ""feel-good"" atmosphere. I LOVE Nashville and am so happy an extension of Music City finally made its way to NYC!Typically, I'm not a huge fan of Southern food, but this place was an exception:APPS: Buffalo cauliflower was unreal and I highly recommend. It's not fried, yet extremely delicious.   MAIN: I had the Veggie Burger which was very flavorful, (not bland or too greasy), cooked perfectly and fulfilling. My cousin said the Opry Classic Burger was ""the best burger she's ever had"" and my friend (a NYC transplant from Alabama) ordered the Chicken & Waffles which she gave a credible 5stars.DESSERT: We were celebrating a bday, so of course had to order the Apple crumb. Def not a low caloric option, but SO worth it. Take it to go if you're full from dinner like we did, you'll be thankful late night/next morning.DRINKS: Loved the Bluegrass cucumber infused cocktail, which was very refreshing. Quality of the food exceeded expectations, portions are generous, and we couldn't have asked for a better server! (who is actually a musician formerly from Nashville). The live music makes the dining experience even better, and at times they switch to live stream at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville which was really cool. We heard they're going to have some bigger names playing there for ticketed events in the future which we're looking forward to. I live in the city and typically avoid the craziness of Times Square like the plague. However, the restaurant is a little further up from the chaotic center and definitely worthwhile for dinner/drinks!",10,,1
21,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",41,182,98,5.0,3/24/2018,"I attended an event here and it was a lot of fun! I got to try lots of appetizers and small plates and everything was great. Oddly enough, I really don't see many of the things we had on the menu, but some of my favorites were the fried chicken sliders, spicy deviled eggs, and these biscuits with pimento cheese and sausage. The gumbo was also good and that one is on the menu. Though I ate a lot I made sure to save room in case they brought out desserts, and I'm glad I did! Their monkey bread is delicious! The desserts kept coming and coming so I tried a few more things. The cookies and brownies were great, I tried a pie which was just okay, and unfortunately I was stuffed by the time the hummingbird cake came around but it looked really good. A friend tried and raved about the sweet potato pie.Though everything was good, I wouldn't come here just for the food, I'd come for the atmosphere. It's a really cool place and it makes you feel like you're somewhere else, so if you're getting sick of the city but can't really afford a weekend trip to Nashville, coming to Opry Stage will make you forget that you're in Times Square. I'm not crazy about country music but it was still really cool to have performers on the stage during our meal. Overall I'd recommend it.",,,
22,Chloe G.,"Wexford, PA",353,86,50,3.0,2/12/2018,"This place has potential but definitely has some things that need worked out. We stopped in on Saturday night. It wasn't very busy. We waited for about 5 minutes at the hostess stand because there was only one host but apparently she needed a second one to seat us. Finally once the girl arrived she stood there and chatted away for a few more minutes with the other host and totally disregarded us. It was strange. So many open tables just take us somewhere! Our server was Bentley and he was very nice and attentive! The food was okay. We got the 2 step which says it is shared between 2 to 3 people for $74. The portion was very small especially for bbq!! If there was 3 of us we absolutely would of needed to order more food. The ribs were pretty good, nice and smokey. The burnt ends couldn't of been further from ""burnt"". The side of coleslaw was funny. Such a cheap side and they give you a tiny bit! I love the concept of listening to live country music so it really drew us here. Unfortunately the singer on Saturday was awful. Everything she sang was botched covers. I would of loved to hear some of her own music. I wish I could give have stars because I'd say it was closer to a 2.5.",1,,

Updated review","9/28/18 PERMANENTLY CLOSED!  Announced yesterday.6/24/18 update on review below:It appears the tip scam is pervasive and not an accident.  They purposely mark a party of two as five to trigger the automatic 20% tip on each and every bill.  Like the Saturday night house band but won't come back till I know the tip scam has been eradicated from the system and staff.   The band plays at other venues.  If you still come hear WATCH YOUR BILL VERY CAREFULLY!  There is systematic abuse of the billing systemFirst reviewFriendly staff, good live music, food a little overpriced but good and the price does cover the live music.  One major problem was the bill: for a party of two they charged an automatic 20% tip, THEN when they come back with the credit card receipt to sign,they charged not ONLY the initial 20% tip but AN ADDITIONAL 20% tip.  All of a sudden a 55 dollar tab is $86.  They apologized profusely and fixed the mistake but you have to wonder how often this happens.  I hope it was an honest mistake BUT YOU BETTER CHECK YOUR BILL SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE SIGNING JUST TO MAKE SURE.",,,
24,Jason F.,"Greenlawn, NY",91,40,1,5.0,4/19/2018,"Tonight we went to Opry City Stage to celebrate Curtis' birthday. I mean Curtis and Cathy are always buying me dinner, so it was only right that I paid for tonight. Being the big country music fan that he is, Curtis mentioned this place and said we should try it out. Turns out he picked a winner! Right in the middle of chaotic Times Square comes a taste of Nashville. Who would think it could work? But it does!We had a great table very close to the stage. We got to enjoy live music, Brian Clayton and the Green River Band (they were really great). It's a 4 story palace of a country fan's kinda place. Very nice decor, lots of pictures of many famous Country Music singers and bands. The staff was very friendly, and our server Elyssa was amazing! She was so cool and super attentive. Do you know, Curtis got 4 birthday shout-outs, including a Happy Birthday from the band, and once again when Elyssa brought out the dessert. I mean, that's really making people feel special. The food was excellent. We had the deviled eggs and some biscuits with cinnamon butter and honey to get things started. Curtis likes himself a nice steak, so he had the ribeye. I talked Cathy Jean into trying Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was a little spicy for her, so Elyssa had the kitchen re-fire it. We didn't ask her to do that. That was Elyssa being attentive and awesome. Cathy loved the dish. I tasted the chicken, it was everything you would hope for in Southern Fried Chicken. As for me, I also went the Southern route and ordered Shrimp and Grits. I got extra andouille sausage in mine. The food was delectable and mouth-watering good. I saw some people on Yelp complaining about prices, but to stay in business in Times Square, you have to charge accordingly. We knew that going in, so we didn't get sticker shock like some folks from Iowa or elsewhere. The food was really good, the atmosphere was great, the company was even better, and our server Elyssa was really great. Tonight was worth every penny I spent!We couldn't have been happier with Opry City Stage and out experience there. We will definitely be back!!! Thank you again Elyssa! You rock!!",6,,

To start at the beginning though, I generally hate Times Square, and upon walking in you feel like you are immediately transported to a gigantic version of a Nashville venue. (We love Nashville) The pictures and quotes lining the wall are museum quality and the staff was fairly friendly!I sat at the bar for a bit to wait for a friend, and they did have some happy hour specials even on a Friday. When we went upstairs to the Bluebird, we found a table and our waitress came right over. The space is awesome and the room is quite soundproof with great acoustics. They did a songwriter in the round format which was absolutely wonderful and so intimate. It reminded me of an episode of VH1 storytellers. We ordered the chicken fingers and fries (sooo good tasted like homemade not super breaded frozen crap) the Mac and cheese (delish but VERY rich) and the nachos (ok but I wouldn't get again) then downstairs we had the fried green tomatoes (the tomatoes themselves were some of the best I've had but the sauce was eh)Overall our experience was absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to go again and again.",,,

The relaxed atmosphere and regular music were so good we stayed for dinner.  I had never heard of the band (Two Thirds Goat?), but the quality of their sound was so good it was impossible not to appreciate.  I also like the way the venue spaces out the sets because you are able to enjoy a few songs, have a conversation during the breaks, and enjoy the music again.  As for the food, I recommend the fried green tomatoes, cornbread pudding, and smoked half chicken (which is perfectly cooked - moist and delicious).  The Bluegrass Breakdown is an awesome, refreshing cocktail.I am giving Opry City Stage five stars because it is so hard (read: nearly impossible) to find a relaxed venue that allows you to enjoy a balance between live music and pleasant conversation.  It is clear they are committed to quality music, whatever the genre or the date (I went on a Tuesday!).  I look forward to returning for the full experience.",,,

Great ambience if you want to feel like you are not even in NYC anymore! Great live music while you eat in a soaring dining area. I had the buffalo cauliflower which I'd have again. The salmon plate was pretty good too! MONKEY BREAD NOT TO BE MISSED! I went back again just to have it! A huge portion, can feed a party of 4 though this party of 2 is not alimentarily challenged! Hope more locals catch on to this place as we want it to stay! Perhaps having an open mic night or scheduled lesser knowns and locals perform on the smaller stage would add that community neighborhood involvement as there is a lot of talent awaiting in hell's kitchen.",,,
41,Daniel G.,"Hamlin, PA",260,3,5,5.0,12/19/2017,"Let me just start with the atmosphere, as you walk through the doors you truly feel like you stepped out of NYC and into Nashville! The food, the music, and the staff (especially our awesome waiter Brain who gave a us recommendations of places to go on our upcoming trip to nashville) truly make the experience so one of a kind!! Those who love country music the city stage is a must stop!! Price wise compared to other restaurants in the area it actually comes in about equal to or below cost with entrees around $20-$30 and drinks around $8-$15 plus no cover or minimum and they have a happy hour from 4-7! Foodies: A must try is the Nashville Hot Chicken and Waffles! ...Only things as of now that could be worked on is perfecting online reservation notes as we had put a note on our reservation for unobstructed view and then we're seating obstructed but were able to be moved! Also, as we mentioned to our amazing waiter they should sell everything they use in the restaurant. They had these neat water jugs and I'm sure many ppl would buy plateware even with the opry logo! Finally, apparel wise the cloths are amazing but there could be some expansion in not design style but shirt style! Also maybe diversify the price points of some of the apparel as $40 seemed much for a T-shirt compared to the sweatshirt which was $60! Overall this is a must stop!",3,1,1

Food was horrible. One good thing about as the chef came out to talk to us because things were really bad. Chef deon. But the food wasn't good. My friends and I came back the next day to talk to him and the manager told me she didn't know who I was talking about. I told her the one that was here last night and she walked away from us. So rude. When she did come back she came with a guy who looked like he was on drugs. He tried to talk to us but I couldn't make out what he was saying and we left. I wanted to give two stars but she took that away. I suggest if you do come here, you come early to get a table in front of the stage. Or just don't go.",,,

I had called to increase our party to six and there was no mention of being overbooked. They offered no apology, no solution. Inexperienced hosts with no clue on how to handle.

48,John B.,"Staten Island, NY",0,84,24,3.0,1/13/2018,"Atmosphere at the Opry City Stage is unique to the Times Square scene, especially when there is live music being played. The food is decent. Some portions are small, especially the Mac and cheese, which was the best part of the meal. The biscuit appetizer was dry and luke warm at best.They love to push the BBQ menu. The rib portion was filling for $20 plus but they are more chewy than tender. No fries included with this item. Think of this place as the Hard Rock Cafe for country music.",,,

Why don't you go mock the patrons of Bubba Gump?

55,Fran S.,"Stratford, CT",0,3,0,5.0,8/22/2018,"My son and went here after seeing a Wednesday matinee show. He had seen it a few months before and was anxious to eat there and listen to country music. We made reservations and arrived at 5:15. The place was pretty empty. Since my son uses a wheelchair the hostess made sure that we had no problem getting to our table. We were seated at a table right infant of the stage just where we wanted to be. Our server was Brian. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and the restaurant itself. We told him we were not in a rush and we planned to stay, listen to the music, eat dinner and just hang out. He said no ;emblem we can stay as long as we wanted. I ordered the Broadway on Broadway. It was really good but expensive. It was hard to decide what to eat because almost  everything to me sounded good. Brian made some suggestions and I chose the meatloaf platter. My son wanted a bowl of grits for an appetizer but it wasn't on the menu. When he asked Brian if he can get some, Brian said yes he could do that. After a short period of time, a soup size cut bowl of grits came out. They were very good. My son also ordered his go to favorite chicken tenders and fries. Both were also very good. My meatloaf was wonderful. It had 2 large slices of meat, green beans and mash potatoes that still had some lumps in them (my favorite). The 4 piece band, Citigrass, started to play about 5:30. They played various types of music. We really liked the fiddle player. When they took short brakes there was videos playing on the screens.  We stayed for about 3 hours. At no time were we asked to leave or given our check even though the place was filling up and we had finished our meal and not ordered any more drinks. Yes we will definitely come back. Yes the prices were on the higher side but this was a theme restaurant in Times Square NYC. The food, service and decor were wonderful.",,,

I took 2 bites and had them take it away.  My expectation was hoping the manager would come by and apologize and offer us something else in replacement.  The waiter just said ok that Sucks and left it at that.  I feel the customer service is not to par here.  I wont be coming back anytime soon.",2,,

Yes you'll need to shout to be heard over the music, but there are breaks between sets, and the back of the room is quieter. Possibly quieter upstairs as well, but we didn't stay there long.  We went on a Saturday night and it was super busy, but they were able to accommodate our reservation after a bit of a wait when we didn't want to sit at a high top. It was worth it. Food was quite good. Not quite great, but at least as good as you would expect from a music hall. Service was good and all the staff were very friendly.

Our waitress only came to our table to take our order. She didn't deliver our food, ask how our food was, offer us drink refills or dessert or give us our bill. I had to get up and ask for the bill. This restaurant is way under-staffed. The ambiance is great including live music, and the food although very overpriced ($18.50 just for a hamburger with lettuce and tomato) was at least yummy.

77,Robert B.,"Staten Island, NY",4,12,2,2.0,4/29/2018,"First off, I made a reservation and pointed out that it was my birthday on it. No one acknowledged it in any way. The tables are too close together and we are put at a table where I had to disturb other diners to get to my table, I am a big guy. There were tables that were more accessible.  The waitress came over quickly and offered us water but it too more than 10 minutes to get. Upon looking at the menu, I was disappointed by the choices of cocktails and the lack of a more southern, country menu. Yes, there was shrimp and grits, catfish, and Nashville Hot Chicken, barbecue, and Nashville Pork Stew but I was looking for more. Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken Fried Pork Chop and Country Ham were among the missing I would have liked to see. I ended up ordering a barbecue half chicken which comes with a small cup of coleslaw. some pickles and a few sliced pickled onions, that's it. I had to order a side of smothered green beans which was almost $7! I would have liked a potato but I didn't want to add another $7 to my bill. When I received my half chicken, it looked more like a half pigeon than half a chicken. The drumstick was about 4 inches long and and not very meaty, it looked like half a pigeon which I have had before.  Considering how much my half chicken cost, I am positive it must have been squab (pigeon) which is usually pricey. Meanwhile, we finally got our water but it took another 15 minutes to get our sodas which we ordered while waiting for our water when we were lucky enough to have the waitress come by. She was MIA most of the time we were there. We ordered some biscuits which were excellent but the cinnamon butter was disgusting, made with margarine would be my guess. I used to make cinnamon butter at Texas Roadhouse so I know what it should taste like. We decided to skip dessert and not give the restaurant more of our money. The atmosphere was nice and the live music was great but I would never go there to eat again.",1,,

82,Chris C.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",0,6,0,2.0,4/22/2018,"This two star review should be taken as an average.  The service and food are nothing to write home about.  The management is pitiful.  The show however was great.  The food here is naturally overpriced and just OK. It's a limited menu of mostly fried comfort foods.  There is a twenty dollar per person minimum on the fourth floor where we had tickets, so we decided to eat there. The music is great. My daughters and I went to a ticketed performance by Maggie Rose. We enjoyed her show very much once we got in the door. We bought tickets online ahead of time and the tickets as well as the website clearly stated that the doors would open at 6 PM. Although there is live music playing on the second floor, the fourth floor is a ticketed venue. We arrived upstairs at 6:05. There was already a line of about 25 people in front of us as we got off the elevator. Then the wait began. We had no information. We had only a closed door and a slightly confused hostess. Eventually we were told there were technical difficulties.  The crowd grew, the temperature rose and at one point the line was redirected so that we were now waiting on the stairs.  This not only created an unsafe situation but it allowed the line to be fed from two different places. The result of this was that there were people joining the line and finding their place ahead of those who had arrived earlier. It made for a very stressful situation. The doors finally opened at 6:50 PM. By this time, we were hungry, thirsty, and pretty miserable.  We entered the room to find that there were 5 or 6 reserved tables already.  The message was clear.  We did not matter. Our business was unappreciated.  We had a difficult time getting a waiter because these poor servers who missed out on an hour's worth of orders and  tips were now inundated by everyone sitting at once.  It was ridiculous. It's probably advisable to eat before you get there and just hit your twenty dollar minimum with drinks which is easy to do.  I think that in spite of my love of country music, it will be a while before I return to Opry City Stage.  This place has a great concept but without a change in management it doesn't stand a chance at long term survival.",,,

The food!  There is something here for everyone.  I love the feel, I loved the bartenders, the servers!  You're missing out if you don't go and they even take reservations!",,,
91,Vanessa V.,"Whittier, CA",107,1,0,1.0,2/11/2018,"If I could give zero stars I would. It's sad to say that my sister & her bf had  just gotten engaged & we decided to have dinner here& it ended horrible. To start off the waitress looked and acted miserable, she did not even say hi to us she went straight to ask us what we wanted to drink. I understand we got there at 11:15 PM and they closed at 12 but that is no reason to give us shitty customer service. Not once did she smile, or ask how our day was going. The bare minimum of what is expected for customer service was not met. She never notified us it was last call, and when my brother in law tried to order a beer they they wouldn't let him. Mind you before we entered the restaurant we were told we could continue drinking after midnight & that they wouldn't kick us out. We called the manager over, was not much of a help. He ended up going to yell at the poor girl in the front and to top it off he yelled ""so they are lying"". Horrible horrible experience over all. The food was great, the wine was great, customer service was horrible. We did get 1 free beer but that doesn't make up for the experience.",2,,
92,Leslie S.,"South Burlington, VT",0,18,0,3.0,1/28/2018,"This place is a country music version of the Hard Rock Cafe. So if you like dining at touristy chain restaurants...this place fits the bill. Our server Brian was great but unfortunately this place is still finding its footing a month after opening. We went on Saturday at 7:30 and they were out of olives (we ordered martinis), they ran out of the salmon (the only fish entree on the menu), drinks took a long time to be delivered and the bartender didn't know how to make a chocolate martini (we had to tell them). When we got the bill there were two different prices for the martinis, which was corrected. The food was pretty good...especially the monkey bread! As far as the entertainment...a band was playing and it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation. However in between the band and the live streaming from Nashville, a person with a microphone was mingling with patrons and attempting to be funny and engage everyone else, but frankly it was annoying. Hopefully this place will get its act together soon.",,,
