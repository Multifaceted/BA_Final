0,Jacob L.,"New York, NY",0,13,8,5.0,5/15/2018,They have great food 24/7 with Gino in the morning and a few Latin American guys holding down the night/early AM shifts. The night/morning guy makes the best quesadillas I've ever had and now they offer amazing burritos as well. The gyros they make are just as good as Gyro World's except half the price! Also have to say that their coffee is excellent and cheap too.,,,
1,Amanda P.,"New York, NY",1,19,1,1.0,8/1/2016,Always find expired food items and their workers skip their regulars before the average customer. I've come a few times to this store when taking my son to the doctors and luckily I read the expiration date on stuff. Poor customer service too,1,,1
2,C A.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,3/12/2016,"Best Burger on Fresh Pond road... period... Gino is the man cooking... breakfast, lunch dinner... they are open 24hrs.. so you can get that late night mozzarella sticks craving fixed... 2 seats in the back no other seating... but food and prices are great... huge Burger deluxe for 6.00??? Big hero sandwiches 5 to 7 bucks... 4.00 for a stack of French toast? Â Trust me... this place rocks and they are always clean... try them out.",1,,1
3,D M.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,5.0,4/15/2016,"For a 24-hour joint, you can't do better than this. Every sandwich I've had from the deli is top-notch. I'd recommend The Madison, subbing ham for the suggested turkey.",1,,1
4,Eva J.,"Manhattan, NY",3,38,20,4.0,8/11/2016,"I keep coming back here because of how personable the staff is. This is my go-to deli for a quick breakfast of bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll. They let me top it off with guacamole, usually at a discount because I'm a regular. Though the deli is quite small, they are incredibly efficient at catering to several customers at once.",1,,
5,Jackie W.,"OAKLAND GARDENS, NY",17,41,12,4.0,2/15/2014,"Regular deli, nothing special. Sometimes they have a flower shop on the side. The flowers are pretty. They don't look like they're about to die either. But be careful they like to charge a bit extra..",2,2,1
