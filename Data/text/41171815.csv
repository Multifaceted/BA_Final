0,R David R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",87,14,0.0,5.0,9/6/2018,Neighborhood family-owned deli. The kinda place where they remember you and remind you you like your steak fries crispy. Good place. Good people. Super affordable!,,,
1,Ivan G.,"New York, NY",139,4,5,5.0,8/12/2018,Nice Spot. been there this morning for the first time ordering some black coffee & pancakes. Cooked to perfection. was all good! Staff is friendly and I'll be back for sure. So I definitely recommend this place.,,,
2,Melanie H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,13,7,5.0,8/26/2018,Amazing!!!! This is like a real nyc bodega that also caters to their affluent residents. Food is delicious. There's a dinner counter to eat at. Small but cozy. I really like it here! Def try if you're in the neighborhood and want delicious food for low cost.,,,
3,William S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/6/2018,Wish I could give 6 stars. Love the staff and food. Get the breakfast burrito with chorizo.,,,
4,Michelle P.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,5.0,9/29/2018,"As other reviewers have noted, the breakfast burrito with chorizo is amazing, it's so good that I am finding it hard to branch out and try other stuff at G's because I just want to have the delicious breakfast burrito. But eventually I will and I am sure I won't be disappointed. Very glad this place is in Inwood.",,,
5,Kelisiah H.,"Bronx, NY",40,111,78,5.0,11/20/2017,"I usually have brunch in Harlem on Sundays (after church), but yesterday I wasn't in the mood to sine out. I've been eyeing this place on yelp for a minute, yesterday I decided to give it a try. SO glad that I did. I ordered french toast with cheese eggs & bacon and a side of avocado. I looked up on the wall menu and saw ""bacon, egg, scallions, & cheese on a roll"" so I asked for scallions to be added to my eggs...no problem, we're going to hook it up for you"" was the response I got. Can you say SUPERB customer service??! Food was very good. I was grateful for the texas toast style french toast. The bacon was excellent...wish there was more. The avocado was fresh...unlike a place I used to go to for bfast in midtown near my job. Will I go back?? I just placed an order for delivery right before typing this review...2 days in a row?? I think we've got a keeper:)",2,,1
6,Nicole R.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,7,0,5.0,8/18/2018,"Great mom and pop shop that I hope will be there forever! Good people, good food. Don't forget to order an egg cream!",,,
7,Samantha F.,"Hayward, CA",1,14,16,5.0,3/14/2018,Their breakfast and sandwiches are so good here. I've ordered food through the phone for delivery and I've gone in person to order. They're very quick and the food is great!,,,
8,Howard B.,"Bronx, NY",1,29,2,5.0,11/4/2017,"G's is the best diner around. They can make everything and never mess up an order while never writing anything down. That's talent! The cook is amazing and the staff is always friendly. When you go, I recommend any of their breakfast combinations - breakfast burrito, home fries, pancakes (they make banana). Literally anything!",2,,
9,Darrenn W.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,2/21/2017,"Hands down best place for breakfast in Inwood. Amazing place for a quick lunch.Not really a coffee shop...more of a lunch counter. Humble, unassuming and inexpensive. Holes in the wall don't exist like this anymore in Manhattan. The staff behind the lunch counter is super friendly and the food is top notch. Highly recommend!Youll be hard-pressed to find a place that can even compete on quality of food vs value.",2,,2
10,Kayla G.,"Kew Gardens, NY",3,36,0,5.0,8/1/2017,"G's is my favorite neighborhood coffee spot! Inexpensive, great food and coffee, very quick and the staff are very friendly. I love that not only do they know my usual order when I go in, but my boyfriend's too - even when he's not with me, they will start to make it!",1,,
11,Joe M.,"Vienna, Austria",1,4,0,5.0,2/2/2017,"Love this place! Get breakfast, coffee or egg and cheese on a roll and you're in heaven! Awesome neighborhood spot. I wish I'd still live in Inwood. Really miss this little gem!",1,,
12,Allison C.,"New York, NY",208,1624,449,4.0,7/27/2015,"There isn't much to say about G's other than YOU NEED TO GO. Cheap breakfast food, an amazing fresh menu of Mexican dishes (along with the best chicken tacos, loaded with cilantro and avocado), and SO. MUCH. CANDY. It epitomizes that perfect ""hole in the wall"" kind of place that you want to tell all of your friends about; conversely, you still want to keep that secret all to yourself.Inwood is BLESSED by G's.",3,3,3
13,Lew W.,"Manhattan, NY",203,51,3,4.0,7/29/2016,"This little hole in the wall is a gem. I had two chicken tacos tonight, dressed appropriately with onion, salsa verde, cilantro and a huge hunk of avocado for $5. I can't make them for that. Messican coke is in the coolers, as well as ice cream. The owners are very kind and attentive. I'll go back for burritos and breakfast! $10 min for credit cards.",1,1,
14,Tony L.,"Manhattan, NY",617,635,594,4.0,2/7/2015,"Inwood is lucky to have G's Coffee Shop. It took me almost 4 years of living here to find out about this place. Don't make my mistake in waiting that long. This oddly-named Mexican/diner/bodega/deli is far more than just a cup of coffee. From thick milk shakes to the best tacos and tortas north of SoHo, this neighborhood joint is the real deal. It's great for saddling up to the bar on one of the few stools or taking your order to go. Breakfast is good, but your best bet is grabbing a few authentically Mexican tacos for lunch. Whatever your taste is, you'll love the ingredients. Everything on the menu is perfectly made to order by the friendly guys behind the counter.When in Inwood, don't miss G's.",4,1,1
15,Adriana E.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",18,16,24,5.0,9/14/2014,"Wow! I am so happy Yelp led me here. It was so nice to have some authentic Mexican tacos. Having recently left Texas I was having withdrawals from Mexican food and this place definitely helped me get my fix. I sat at the counter to order/eat. The staff was very friendly. I love being able to see my food being prepared on the grill, as it heightens my anticipation. It was prepared very quickly. I ordered one chorizo and egg taco and one lengua taco. For anyone who doesn't know: lengua is cow tongue. Do not be afraid. It is delicious. I promise. All the tacos came garnished with cilantro, onion, avocado, and salsa verde. If you don't want any of those things, be sure to ask ahead of time. The salsa is great, not too spicy. Reminded me of grandmas. I will absolutely be back.. Again and again and again.",4,,1
16,Rebecca M.,"Manhattan, NY",43,20,41,5.0,10/17/2015,"Best spot for breakfast in the neighborhood! If you don't see something you want on the menu(s) just let the helpful and friendly staff know what you'd like and watch them make it fresh on the griddle! The multigrain spinach breakfast sandwich is my favorite, but the breakfast tacos are also delish. They're totally cool about making sandwiches with turkey bacon and egg whites, too, so if you're looking to customize and make a meal slightly healthier, look no further than G's. Just be sure to save me a seat at the counter!",3,1,2
17,Amanda L.,"Beachwood, OH",9,135,215,5.0,1/26/2016,"This little place has great service, tacos and good prices! I often come here for lunch to get 2 tacos for $5 they are hot, the avocado is fresh and probably the best I've had in the city!",,,
18,Bruce W.,"New York, NY",1,18,1,5.0,8/9/2016,Love this place. Everything is good here and the staff is extremely nice and welcoming. Fast deliveries too which is a plus,2,,
19,Duane S.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,238,1402,5.0,7/24/2015,"Great family owned, neighborhood coffee shop for breakfast and lunch. I've gotten food here many times over the years, dine in, and to go. Pretty much everything is made fresh right in front of you. They make a Mexican breakfast burrito that is awesome.",1,1,1
20,Ell C.,"New York, NY",47,190,26,4.0,8/3/2015,"A family owned business - this eatery has Mexican delectables and typical America meals. Always busy, always friendly chatter from the workers speedy business and they no longer use styrofoam. Prices are hard to beat too! Bring a container for leftovers and refuse the plastic bags!!!!",1,,
21,Tony T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,5.0,8/11/2016,Welcome back to real NYC. The right prices for the right stuff. Long live G's. Breakfast burrito competes with any you've ever had.,1,,
22,Rosie D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,0,5.0,1/17/2015,"One of my favorite places in Inwood.  What is there not to love?  Their coffee is so good - a heck of a lot better and way cheaper than that nasty Starbucks or anything that you'll find downtown or in midtown.  I always buy my morning coffee here before I take the A train downtown in the mornings.  The staff here will know you by name.  At some point, if you become a regular, they'll be able to look at you, call you by name and know what you want.  Overall, their food and staff are great, and I find the place very clean - typical case book study of a very successful small business!  Hello, Steve, Ana and Angel! :)",4,1,
23,Amy C.,"Bronx, NY",68,8,0,5.0,10/8/2016,"Has to be, by FAR, the most consistently great place for breakfast. Honestly, everything I have gotten from there has been amazing.",,,
24,Karissa B.,"New York, NY",363,37,33,5.0,6/19/2016,Best burrito I have EVER had. Hands down. Comes with chips and spicy salsa. The staff is accommodating and kind to customers. I will always support this awesome local joint!,,,
25,Petey F.,"San Francisco, CA",4,70,5,5.0,5/22/2016,"This really is the best burrito in nyc. If you need something better than chipotle and more authentic, here it is. They can also make bagels and quesadillas, philly cheese steak and its all good.",,,
26,Katherine B.,"New York, NY",34,6,2,5.0,6/29/2014,"I have been here twice already although I've only been living in the neighborhood for a week now. Their bagel egg/cheese/bacon sandwiches are superb and made to order as long as you're quick on your feet! What was more striking was the service, the owner is eager to know you got everything you needed and the food is good. When my roommate and I were checking out we mentioned that we had just moved in up the street and he waved to his store and told us ""This is your home now. I know what it is like to move away from where you live, this can be your home."" I will definitely be returning to my new second home.",5,,3
27,Craig F.,"Harrisburg, PA",25,240,61,4.0,4/9/2012,"This place is close to our son's apt and it always smells great when we walk by.  Finally we decided to give it a try and I'm glad we did. We tried the chicken and pork empanadas. They were very good with the right amount of filling, seasoning and crust.   We will eat here again and definitely try the tortas and tacos which looked delicious!   I can't wait to go back!",5,2,
28,Gina M.,"New York, NY",18,22,5,5.0,1/19/2014,"Are you craving some tortas, tacos, tostadas or burritos and you live in Inwood? Here's your place! It is a coffee shop, so there's only some stools for you to sit down and enjoy your food, but you can always order in. The perfect place to eat some tacos the day after a long night out!",4,,
29,Sarah L.,"New York, NY",129,27,8,5.0,9/26/2014,"We have lived across the street for just over a year but have only recently discovered this gem! The constant stream of people (often the same regulars!) in and out should have clued me in sooner. I admit that I was a wee skeptical of G's at first and just kept walking by the crowds and dark interior. EVERY. DAY. However I am so glad we finally stopped by! The service is fast, staff are so friendly and the food is hearty, cheap and delicious. It is our go-to spot for breakfast these days. Oh, and unlike most places, when you pay $1 extra for avocado, they don't skimp! We are all too happy to frequent this neighborhood haunt.",,,
30,Caro H.,"New York, NY",9,32,0,5.0,8/30/2015,"This is a hole in the wall with delicious, authentic Mexican food for a cheap price. It's a family owned business that makes their own food fresh. There are a few stools to sit down on if you don't have a place to go, but my friends and I ordered food and took food to the park to enjoy. I had a chicken taco and beef taco, which was a $5 deal. They were generous on the meat, cilantro, and avocado. So good. A friend ordered 2 beef and 2 cheese empanadas for $1.25 each. The beef had some vegetables included like string bean and carrot. I had a taste and it was also mouth-watering. We will definitely be coming back. As a plus, the staff are very friendly and really appreciate your business. But pro-tip: the bathroom's cramped and worn down. Good enough if nature calls, but otherwise, try to avoid the bathroom if you can",,,
31,YT B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,2.0,8/8/2016,I had the burrito which was a gut filler but that's about it . Could have should have made better at home . There are plenty better places in the neighborhood for the money that are better . Cuter soda shop counter though with the fried foods menu and cream sodas .,,,
32,Marie M.,"New York, NY",11,9,0,5.0,6/20/2015,"A great place for coffee, inexpensive breakfast and pretty much the best tacos in Inwood. The staff is always friendly -- you won't be disappointed.",,,
33,Powers B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,2,5.0,6/17/2015,"Cheap breakfast spot in Inwood right near the A train with amazing breakfast burritos and delicious coffee. It has that old time family owned feel, and instead of gouging prices to offer nonsense they stick to the basics and do it really well. There is a shorter counter to eat at but I normally get it to go for my commute.",,,
34,Just A.,"New York, NY",0,79,0,5.0,3/27/2013,"Good Mexican food, burgers, breakfast, etc. Very tasty. Good food.The people who run it are really nice too. Neighborhood gem!",2,,
35,Andrea B.,"New York, NY",8,12,3,5.0,3/17/2015,"Best breakfast, coffee, cold beverages in Inwood. Tiny but cute diner style. The mexicans even sell authentic Mexican Soda, Jarritos. Local friendly spot.",1,,
36,Cherie R.,"New York, NY",11,14,6,5.0,6/8/2016,really great casual place with yummy tacos and many other great foods. definitely  recommend to give it a try.,,,
37,Tim N.,"New York, NY",44,69,5,4.0,10/7/2012,"I mistakenly reviewed this as ""TMV Luncheonette"" at the same address, but now I realize it is G's.I've purchased two tortas from here and both were excellent.",3,2,
38,Mary O.,"New York, NY",82,24,7,5.0,2/17/2014,"O.M.G. A beef burrito the size of two softballs, with spicy shredded beef, and a side of the freshest guac anywhere--for $8.50. If you are near an A train stop, come here now.",5,1,
39,Alison K.,"New York, NY",279,1,0,5.0,8/31/2014,I had that this place had delicious Mexican food so the day we moved to Inwood I tried it out. Soo good. Best Mexican I've had in NYC. The spicy pork is out of this world and the tortas are delicious. Great guac that they made right in front of me. Definitely my go to neighborhood spot.,2,,
40,Hannah B.,"New York, NY",90,8,10,5.0,9/11/2011,"If you're like me, you've never heard of a torta before. That is, until you've been introduced to one by your Mexican friend who used to enjoy many a torta during her days in Mexico. A torta is like Mexico's national sandwich. And it's got a little bit of everything squeezed into it perfectly. It's got avocado, jalapeno, lettuce, tomato, refried beans, and your choice of meat. Soo good. And only $5.50! I challenge you to order one.I feel like the coffee shop used to be a hopping soda shoppe back in its day. It's set up like an old-school diner and you can even have yourself an egg-cream with your burgers and fries- all of which I have yet to try. And until I'm off this torta kick, I refuse to.",4,2,2
41,Gabrielle C.,"Greensboro, NC",49,152,0,5.0,6/21/2013,"Huge, delicious burrito, only seven bucks. Super friendly owner. We mentioned we'd just moved to the neighborhood. He said this place is our house now...felt really welcomed. Can't wait to come back for breakfast. Right by the park. The beat up stools just add to the charm.",6,3,3
42,fridah l.,"Baltimore, MD",2,129,11,3.0,6/19/2015,"because of other reviewers i gave the mexican food a shot. it's good. it's fine. it's fresh. but it's not AMAZING. the service is stellar and I appreciate that it is a local spot. the beans were pretty mediocre. the fish tacos good, but i'd prefer not breaded (and probably frozen breaded?)... veggie quesadilla ok. but when ordering to go i'd rather the cold salad garnishments be separate from the hot food. I also expected the quesadilla to hold up better.",1,,
43,Can E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,5.0,4/12/2013,"Excellent food, one of the tastiest tacos you can get. Try the breakfast burrito after a long night out and you will know what bliss is. Don't let the storefront intimidate you, they prepare everything in front of you and the friendly staff is glad to prepare anything according to your wishes. -even happy to come up with items that is not on the menu-Considering that Inwood is being flooded with overpriced mediocre restaurants G's is a neighborhood gem among all the pretentious joints.",5,,
44,Francisco D.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,8/13/2014,Thanks to yelp I found a great hole in the wall that makes a fantastic breakfast burrito. I can't wait to come back and try the lunch burritos.,,,
45,David C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,6/25/2015,"Best in inwood, staple of the neighborhood since i was a kid. Food is always made with love and the home grown feel is always welcoming to anyone. The ppl that run the place have been here for years",,,2
46,Rebecca P.,"New York, NY",6,8,3,5.0,12/11/2012,Yummy breakfasts and the best Mexican take out food in Inwood. Great chicken tacos and burritos.,3,,
47,Matthew H.,"Waxhaw, NC",77,459,97,3.0,5/31/2012,"Greasy spoon, and that is not meant in a bad way. Have stopped in a couple of times now. Egg sandwiches are done right. Coffee prepared as requested. Given the opportunity, I'd try some of their Latin-inspired fare.",5,,
48,Lemonade C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,10/9/2011,"This place is stellar! As a San Diego native, I am consistently dying to eat some Mexican food that tastes anything like the taco shops I grew up with. This place does it! The tacos are amazing, tortas great, and so are the burritos. I haven't had any of the other 600 items on their menu, but I am sure they are delicious. It is a cute place with their little counter with stools and their regular patrons eating their sandwiches on ceramic plates. They are cash only though! Don't forget because you will be so sad you don't get to taste their deliciousness because you forgot to take cash out before!",6,1,1
49,Eddie P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,1,5.0,3/25/2014,"I was skeptical of this place at first because it doesn't look like much, but after getting food there a few times, I'm sold.  The food is fantastic, very fast, and cheap.  The guy who runs the register is extremely pleasant and friendly, which is pretty hard to find around here.  I highly recommend this place.  For Mexican food it beats la piñata hands down.",4,,
50,Krel C.,"Inwood, Manhattan, NY",0,26,0,5.0,3/16/2013,"This is my spot! Hot coffee, good food, great prices, and a friendly staff.",,,
51,Doctor M.,"New York, NY",1,8,1,4.0,9/27/2014,"Just moved back to Inwood after 8 years in California, I figured that I'd have to content myself with mofongo and chicharrones and just try to forget that Mexican food existed. Imagine my shock to find an anonymous-looking lunch counter deli serving completely legit tacos, even offering tongue!  At $5 for two _generous_ tacos, this is probably the best lunch deal north of 180th St. A treasure.",,,
52,Michael S.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,4.0,7/6/2013,"This is an all around awesome spot, has its classic charm, great staff.. friendly, inviting and accommodating. The offerings are simple and what you would expect from a spot like this. The constant smell of bacon that radiates from here compels you to go in and at least see whats cooking, especially in the mornings. So dont sell them short on just being a mexican food spot, their deli fan fare definitely hits the spot as well.",2,1,
53,Jerise F.,"New York, NY",4,21,7,5.0,1/31/2013,"It's absolutely the best breakfast in Inwood! Inexpensive, and cute counter--often crowded, but really in this atmosphere it's a plus!--and the cooking is amazing! Basically, homestyle Mexican cooking, lots of love and friendliness. I go here whenever I am taking a morning walk in the Ft. Tryon and Inwood Hill Park area!",1,,
