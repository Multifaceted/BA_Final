0,Frank M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",198,144,1360,5.0,7/18/2018,"I remember growing up listening to Donna Summer, I have almost all her albums and now CD's and digital recordings. So when I heard there was a Donna Summer Musical I got tickets for me and my wife who is also a big fan. The play was fantastic, awesome, great, just a few words to describe this amazing performance. They had three actresses portraying Donna Summer through different stages in her life. A very entertaining and informative portrayal of Donna Summer's life. I was never aware of all the struggles, adversities and abuse she had to endure. Her perseverance paid off and helped paved the way for others to make this world a better place. I'm glad her story is coming out because it's about time. My hat goes off to her.Everyone in the cast was fantastic, especially the three who portrayed Donna Summer and Jared Zirilli who played her husband. Very believable performance, he portrayed his character flawlessly. The theater itself was nice, we had 6th row so we were very close which just enhanced the experience, like being part of the performance. After the play we were able to meet and get autographs from Storm Lever, the young Donna Summer and Jared Zirilli, Donna Summer's husband, Bruce Sudano. Both were very personable and authentic, a  pleasure to meet and speak briefly with. There aren't many plays I would see a second time but this would be one of them. The cast did an excellent job.",14,7,14
1,Anita W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",24,172,568,3.0,11/1/2018,"I came here to see Summer and the theatre itself was OK (this review is only about my experience with the theatre). People started lining up about 40 minutes before show time and disappointingly, the lines were very disorganized compared to the 4 other theatres I've been to. The line to get in (for those with tickets already in hand) and the line to pick up tickets (the will call line) was both forming in the same direction (so basically two lines running parallel along another). This created unnecessary crowds of people not knowing which line they should get on. Despite the ushers' and staff's best efforts to help manage the lines, confusion continued among the crowd. Also there was a break in the line to get in so it doesn't an entrance door on the side and some guests who just arrived and just picked up their tickets just cut right through the break instead of going to the back of the line which was VERY annoying since I was already in line before them and was continuously asked to wait behind the stanchion. Secondly I think there was only one bathroom (not sure) but there were only about 6 or so stalls (3 on each side with 2? sinks in the center) for the women's room. Luckily I went when the line was short. There was a staff member helping to manage the lines by diving people up on both sides which was helpful. The seats itself were quite comfy. The leg room was a bit tight in the front mezzanine area. I received my tickets from a lottery online so I didn't have much say as to where I sat. I also tend to avoid mezzanine seats as there's no place to stretch my legs in front of me because of the tiered seating. Luckily all the seats to my right were empty so I was able to move down a seat or two and stretch diagonally. Another complaint was that a woman in front of me wore a hat and kept it on through the entire performance. It looked like the person in front of me asked her to take it off but she just moved to another seat and blocked another person's. I wish there was some rule against hats (had a similar experience at a different theatre a few weeks ago too).",1,,1
2,Angela L.,"New York, NY",289,221,186,4.0,10/5/2018,"I have now seen 2 broadway shows at this theater: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Summer: the Donna Summer Musical. Donna Summer was way better. But to comment on the theater itself, it's not the hugest theater ever but it's accommodating. The spaces between the rows are the same in every theater it seems, enough to keep you comfortable for maybe 45mins, after that, you're gonna start getting fidgety. Also just like every other theater, the concession stand prices are stupid. Like really freaking stupid. Don't waste your money please. Unless you really want a souvenir cup for the show you are seeing, don't buy the drinks. They taste fine, that's not the problem. The problem is they cost the same as a cocktail at a rooftop bar with a view of the Chrysler. Sheesh.",,1,1
3,Caroline R.,"Manhattan, NY",133,194,246,5.0,5/8/2018,I saw the Donna Summer Musical and it was absolutely fabulous! Completely enjoyed the singing and learning about the struggles Donna Summer went through in her life. The three actresses portraying her were amazing. The Lunt-Fontanne Theatre was a really nice venue and made for a perfect show.,1,,1
4,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,3.0,5/30/2017,"I was here on Saturday afternoon for a 2 PM showing of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This was my first time at this theatre it seemed bigger to me than the other ones I've been too. My party and I were all the way in the nosebleeds, a bit hard to see, if you have glasses I suggest wearing them. The sound was good, I was able to hear everything clearly, which is very important since we were far away. The play itself was excellent, I was surprised at how good it was. It's a modern take on the original, with a few character changes, I wasn't bummed or questioned what I was watching at all. The cast has great chemistry, the music was both new and old, and the adult innuendo was spot on! I wasn't looking at the clock at all, I was engaged the whole time and so were the kids in the audience. This show is great for adults and kids alike. I give this this theatre 3 stars because they did not check bags, which really ticked me off. Given the state we are in, security is imperative at this types of events where large crowds are gathering. Please update your security measures!",2,1,1
5,Serena W.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",228,118,403,4.0,9/11/2017,"I attended a Sunday evening performance of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with 4 children that belong to my sisters and best friend. I will try not to let my stress level affect my review, lol. Aunty Serena did have a lovely time! We arrived at the theater miraculously because the GPS on my phone was freaking out in this area of Manhattan! Luckily they have all of the bright lights of Broadway to guide us on our way. I was able to get right into the will call line to pick up our tickets and then kind of do a round about out of the theater and back in to enter for the show. This was a bit weird but it gave us an opportunity to take a photo with some of the cool decorations adorning the building. I do recall that the gentlemen whom I picked up my tickets from was quite funny! We entered the theater and I tried to keep order but there was so much to see and the kids were off like racehorses but I corralled them to the bathroom on the lowest level. I believe this is the only one but there are plenty of stalls. I wish there more on the other levels but it's probably an old building and we don't need to redesign the wheel if it rolls. After the bathroom, I had to calmly whisper shout at the kids to not excitedly run up the stairs and we some how made it to the mezzanine level. Of course there was no line for the concession stand so I was forced into buying $30 of candy. My nephew snuck two candy bars not one, right under my nose! $5 per candy item is standard and okay in my book. Welcome to Times Square! We were seated in the center of Row H, and I should mention we got the tickets thru the Broadway Week promotion; they were priced 2 for 1! There was some whisper shouting and danger eyes throughout the show but the kids were totally engaged in the production. They were a little hopped up on the excitement and probably the giant lollipops and chocolate so I had to tell them not to bop around in their chairs and annoy the people behind or in front of them. The leg room is tight between the rows, but manageable if people stand when passing in and out. After the show we went outside and the kids got photos and autographs from the actors. They asked a lot of pointed questions which showed how much they were digging the performance.All of the staff working at the theater were helpful, friendly and sometimes funny. I would definitely attend another show or even the same one at the Lunt Fontanne Theater.",3,2,3
6,Annie Y.,"New York, NY",591,113,157,4.0,9/24/2017,"I sat on the left side of Orchestra and found that this theatre had more leg room than others. I had enough space to put my large Michael Kors work purse on the floor, to cross my legs, and to sink down into my seat. People next to me also had room to put their bags and snacks under their seats as well. Maybe I just got lucky but leg room was not a problem. My view of the show was good too. The seats don't extend too far wide so I pretty much had an almost center/straight view even though I was sitting on the last seat of my row on the far left side of Orchestra. Feel free to take a look at my pic for a visual reference!",3,,
7,Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",171,1237,2115,4.0,1/9/2018,I saw Charlie & The Chocolate Factory at The Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Tuesday 1/2/18. I believe the show is ending 1/14/18 so if you get the chance to see it before it ends just GO! I love the Roald Dahl book. I love the 1971 movie Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. It's a story that is close to my heart so it was a given that I would love this show. It's clever and entertaining. Nice theatre and the attendants in the theatre and at the concession stands were all friendly and lovely. Very nice experience!,,,
8,Vickie M.,"South Orange, NJ",108,41,82,5.0,7/28/2018,What a beautiful theatre in which to see the play Summer. We sat in the mezzanine level which had its own bathroom. (I only wished I had known that before going to the bathroom in the basement upon my arrival).,1,,1
9,Mike Y.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,140,519,1.0,4/7/2018,"The leg room is very tight. Seats are not offset, means the guy in front of you is in front of you, literally.And do not choose mezzanine seating.You see nothing.Will not come back for sure ....",1,,

11,Aly R.,"West Orange, NJ",208,202,197,3.0,6/18/2017,The Lunt-Fontanne is a well-appointed theatre. Decor is intricate and beautiful. Seats are cramped (as are most theaters) so an aisle seat significantly helps with any room issues. There's a small area for concessions and merchandise that becomes very crowded pre-show and during intermission.,1,,
12,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4794,4.0,5/15/2016,"Thank God there was amble leg room at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre as compared to a place where my knees could have touched my chin like at Carnegie Hall.We were here to see ""Finding Neverland"" and I bought tickets based on the seating chart. I mean we were front mezzanine, dead center. Great seats! To get to these seats? We had to walk up a few flights of stairs. Whew!Once inside, the theatre is beautifully appointed with lavish carpets and thick, rich curtains. And the Chandeliers! I'm thinking, who the heck is dusting these things? If it were me, at night I'd use a leaf blower and let it rip. There are pictures everywhere of people dressed up to the 9s, like they did back in the day. Seeing the pictures reminds me of a time when people ""went"" to the theatre. It was an event where everyone would get dressed up. Very fan-say in my NYC back in the day.Once the performance started, you could really hear the amazing acoustics.  The orchestra as well as the actors, everything sounded crisp and on point. It really made the performance truly magical.I bought my tickets on Broadway.com. There is a seating chart, I highly recommend front mezzanine.",16,9,10
13,Sabrina S.,"Clifton, NJ",35,32,52,4.0,12/17/2017,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a must see in this theatre. With comfortable seats, Shakespeare theme decor and beautiful chandeliers, this intimate theatre is where you want to be when reminiscing and singing along to Willy Wonka's classics.

18,Sondra L.,"Boston, Philippines",83,180,223,5.0,9/4/2016,This was an amazing place to watch a Broadway show. I had such a great time watching Finding Neverland here. Even if it had a lot of people watching in there - it still felt intimate. The acoustics were great and the theater was well-maintained. There were only limited toilets but that's expected in every theater in NY. The queue was long but when I got to the booth - it was still clean. There was an attendant there to maintain and clean as soon as a person comes out. Love Broadway! Love this theater!,2,,

20,Jeff B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",15,1,0,1.0,12/27/2017,"If I could give this theater a negative number I would.  My family and I purchased tickets to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory there for Saturday November 11th.  An early birthday present for my 7 year old daughter.   We had a plan to drive down from our home in Massachusetts, stay in a nice hotel and go see the show.  Unfortunately I had a medical issue and was hospitalized and we were unable to attend.  Numerous calls back and forth with the theater and my wife and mother in law the theater said that we can bring our tickets and exchange them for day of show whenever we could get there.  We get to the theater today and they would not honor that promise, nor would they give a refund for our tickets.  Bringing proof that I was in the hospital didn't change their minds.  They wanted us to purchase new tickets.  I will never come to this theater again.",,,
21,Jessica W.,"Lovettsville, VA",208,226,334,4.0,3/22/2015,"This theater is beautiful and the show we saw (Finding Neverland) was AMAZING. I concur with other posters: NO leg room whatsoever. It's not a very large theater compared to some of the other Broadway theaters I've been which is nice because every seat is a great seat. The chandeliers are gorgeous. Just as a quick note, as with most Broadway theaters, there are MANY stairs! I want to post a quick review about Finding Neverland. I know it has nothing really to do with the theater, but it was incredible! The kids were AMAZING! They were on stage for so much of the show and their lines, singing, choreography, and blocking during their scenes was AMAZING. Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer were a perfect duo. Why did no one think to put them together before now?? This is an absolute must-see show!",5,,1
22,Lyn L.,"New York, NY",0,258,2,2.0,4/27/2018,"This theater has a great lobby but that's the only good thing about it. The bathroom is comically small and the view from the mezzanine isn't even worth the price of the ticket. If you're seeing a show here, you might want to save up to get a closer seat",1,,
23,Dez H.,"Bloomfield, NJ",84,140,88,5.0,5/21/2017,"Went here to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Great cast, amazing backdrop and special effects. Lots of twists and turns. Definitely a must see!",,,
24,Albert H.,"Berkeley, CA",252,549,325,4.0,2/17/2016,"I want to write the review for the theater itself, but overall, I found it to be quite nice. Lunt-Fontanne is a smaller theater out of what is available in NYC, but I do like the intimacy of it because even if you are on the orchestra or mezzanine, you are still close to the theater. I got a seat in the side mezzanine, and found it to be sufficient in terms of view and audio. Yes, the seats are a bit cramped, but what small theater is not? If you are taller than 6' tall, it'll be a bit of a struggle. The man behind me in the theater was like and his knees were pretty close to my head, but I could not complain for the price I got for the tickets to see Finding Neverland! I would say that getting a mezzanine seat is perfectly fine as I could even still see the performer's microphone (to give you an idea). My view was not obstructed or anything like that! I will say that even up here in the mezzanine, the view is fantastic!",5,,
25,Joel H.,"Mineola, NY",357,382,2759,4.0,3/29/2016,"As far as theater's go, I was happy with the Lunt-Fontaine for our performance of ""Finding Neverland.""  We went on an EXTREMELY COLD day and they let the people come in and wait upstairs..  Not all theaters were doing that...  I was impressedThe staff was very friendly and directed the people very well.  The restrooms were clean and easily accessible by all and I was very surprised that the normal bathroom lines never got too long.When they opened the house they were able to get most people to their seats in a quick and orderly fashion.  Again, the theater staff was very courteous and pleasant.The seats were fine (as theater seats go) and I was able to enjoy the show for the two hours I remained seated.  One thing that stuck out in my mind was the slope of the theater.  It made it very easy to watch the show with people sitting in front of you.   This theater was extremely clean and during the intermission there were plenty of people to help you to  one of the bars and souvenir stands.",2,,1
26,Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",850,486,9147,5.0,11/11/2014,"Motown on Broadway - Run, jump, steal or borrow money to watch this show! One word ""AWESOME!"" The show leads you on a musical journey on the birth of Motown! Berry Gordy literally was a visionary of his time, his story and struggles to bring Motown into fruition was inspiring! Growing up as a kid, my big sister got me into listening to songs like  ""My girl"", ""Super Freak"", ""Mercy, mercy me"" and we enjoyed watching American Bandstand on TV hosted by the late great Dick Clark and watched the Commodores and the Jackson Five perform.  We had the radio playing music by Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. The musical brought back many fond memories. I was so impressed at the cast and the ensemble, high energy dancing, jumping and singing! These guys and gals were amazing! You couldn't help but get into every song and musical number. The roles played by Josh Tower (Berry Gordy) Krystal Joy Brown (Diana Ross) were AWESOME!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!If you want to catch the show you better hurry! The show ends on January 18, 2015.

27,Kirsty P.,"Toronto, Canada",9,50,83,2.0,11/29/2015,"**This review mostly pertains to my experience at the theatre. I showed up about 10 minutes before 2 to see my afternoon show of Finding Neverland. There was a crowd of kids trailing through the entire front of the theatre. One of the ushers signalled to me and I walked towards them. After they saw my ticket they told me to go in with the kids. Fine. The line wasn't moving amidst some confusion over tickets so the usher let me skip ahead. Upstairs I go. I use the washroom. But a $7 slushie. Get seated and take an obligatory photo of my program. It's Broadway, I was excited! Anyways the show starts. The crowd goes crazy for the teacher from Glee. About 20 minutes in, I realize I am shivering. I wrapped my scarf around myself on top of my spring jacket. I honestly thought it was me because I'm always cold but a few reviews below I see someone else clearly had the same experience. The most annoying part of my experience here was an usher who for the entire first act spent her time taking apart programs, counting them, stacking them together, etc. It was non-stop. Also she kept pulling back the curtain leading to the hallway which spilled in massive amounts of light.At the end of the first act I ran to the washroom (theatre washroom lines for women are hell on earth). When I returned I moved down a few rows as the theatre was pretty empty and the usher wasn't about to ruin the entire show for me. When I get to the new row I find the lady I was sitting beside in the first act there and she shakes her head at me and starts complaining about the usher. The usher approaches me and demands I answer whether I was distracted, I say yes I was and she storms off saying that she wasn't doing anything. Whatever.In the second act the usher strolls from empty seat to empty seat sitting down getting up, generally being ridiculously annoying. The show was great, I would give it 4 stars. It brought me to tears, really fantastic. But the unprofessional usher and the freezing temperature really ruined this for me.",4,,1

Updated review","Was just here to see motown- the show was great! This review is for the theater itself. The place was big and the bathrooms were clean. I'm giving it one star because there's no escalators and if you're sitting at the mezzanine like we did, you're going to be out of breath just getting to your seats. Also, there is not enough room in between rows. I'm short and my knees were literally touching the seat in front of me- Very uncomfortable!!!",1,,
46,Thalia T.,"Hightstown, NJ",109,16,5,5.0,8/28/2014,"Came here to see Motown The Musical.  This by far was one of the BEST shows Broadway.  Prepare to sing and dance to all the wonderful classic Motown songs.  From the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder!  I Got a history lesson of how music is truly a soundtrack to the historical events that have transpired in our country.  The assassination of JFK and MLK. I loved learning about how Berry Gordy had a dream and pursued it.  You will also the audience participation.  I had a great crowd in the attendance.  Sat in the orchestra section. . Row X. . Excellent view!",2,,

It was a full house that night but it did not seem as chaotic as other theaters when there is a full house. The wait was not too long. I had to pick up my tickets at the ""Will Call"" window. There were people outside directing everyone on where to go and they did a great job. We found our seats with very little hassle. I must say the line for the bar was a bit outrageous. I will never understand drinking and eating at the theater. It's so over-priced. I also thought the acoustic was a bit off. At some points it was a little hard to hear the actually words the performers were singing. But overall, great theater.",8,,1

The theatre is very large so it may not be the most intimate if you are sitting far back, but if you have a great seat it will be fine. The interior is very classical and has a grandeur and charm of older Broadway musical houses that really works. I most recently sat in center orchestra which was great, but avoid the front extreme sides as I sat there once and the view was subpar. Overall this is a very nice theatre!",,1,
51,Anthony B.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,22,9,4.0,11/3/2013,"I went to this theater to see motown the musical, and I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance. It had an old classy feel to it. The seating is unfortunately pretty tight with not a lot of leg room. However the way the theater was designed, even if you're sitting in the mezzanine area, you still will be able to see what's going on pretty well. Perhaps because the theater itself isn't that big.",5,,

No sweat, staff were accommodating & helpful none the less. After walking up a million stairs (As expected), I was shocked to see our seats! Everyone was on top of each other! I am just hitting 5ft and my knees were pressed against the chair in front of me. I thought my legs were going to cramp. For over $100 per ticket, I would expect to have more space. This was absurd. I feel that patrons should be comfortable when viewing a show, not feel like packed sardines. Smh. Would I watch MOTOWN again....Heck Yeah! Would I want the experienced of being stuffed in the theatre like a cockroach....No Thank You. I think some remodeling should be in the works. Happy Yelping!",,,

I had no issue with leg room although I'm a rather short guy. The only issue with the theater was the access to bathrooms.

70,Jan R.,"Lafayette, CA",63,30,3,5.0,1/21/2013,"I absolutely adore this theater.  It is an historic theater, built in 1910 I believe, and although updated and remodeled, they kept the original atmosphere of that era.  It is a plush and beautiful representation of a time gone by, complete with massive bright red velvet curtains throughout.  We had amazing seats in main section in the 5th row, although because of the slant of the theater seating, I believe you would be able to enjoy the show from any seat in the house without having to look through someone's hair.   One could sense the indelible presence of the likes of Garbo and Crawford watching a play from the same seats we were in.  Amazing nostalgia....loved every minute of the experience here.",4,1,4
71,Matty G.,"Weehawken, NJ",30,79,49,4.0,10/11/2011,"My friend and I decided to go and see the Adams Family, which was playing in the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. The show was excellent and I would highly recommend it, but that is not what this review is about. This review is just about the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre.The theater is located in the famous Theater District of Manhattan and is a easy walk from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The theater itself is very clean and beautiful inside. Once inside, you either head to your seats on the lower floor or head up the stairs to the upper levels. If you have no idea where to go, there are plenty of ushers around to help you find your seats. Once you finally get to your seats, you will find that they are pleasantly comfortable.It does not have stadium seating but the height ratios in between rows are better than some other theater's I have been to. But unfortunately being towards the short side of the spectrum means that it does not take much for a person in front of me to obstruct my view. So when the taller gentleman sat in the seat in front of me, I became frustrated that I would have to deal with this. However after the play started we were able to move down the row and find some better seats.The staff there is very friendly and helpful when you need help finding your seats or have a question. You can either find them in the back when the play is going on or shooting the breeze with each other in the underground level where the bathrooms are located. Either way they will help you out.Overall I gave this place four stars because of the nice atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the ease of getting to and finding the place.  The height difference between each row is kind of a problem, but not by any means is it a deal breaker. I would suggest going to a show here.",1,,1
72,Helena K.,"Durham, NC",305,331,195,4.0,4/22/2011,"I feel sad when I read the terrible reviews for Addams Family; I enjoyed the show.  Some jokes fell flat, sure, I don't think they used Bebe Neuwirth's talents like they could have, the plot could have been more exciting, but I thought the costumes were spectacular, the set blew my mind, and there were a lot of laughs to be had, particularly those generated by Gomez, portrayed by Merwin Foard (otherwise known as ""the guy who isn't Nathan Lane""), and I had a great time.As far as theaters go, I'm from North Carolina, so I'm used to having my space.  That said, I also know how tight and squeezy everything in New York City is, so I never have trouble adapting.  I'm just shy of six feet, so having enough legroom is a problem I face with some regularity: on the plane, in the backseat of a car, at the ball game and, of course, at the theater.  But, having read these reviews before my visit to the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, the legroom wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be.  Also, the entire row I sat in in the mezzanine was empty, so I was able to spread out.  I don't know how ticket sales are to the show, but was there on a Wednesday, though, so I imagine it's natural that attendance would be down.I think the theater is quite beautiful and well maintained.  It's so easy for things to get raggedy in a big, old city like New York, and that's not the impression I got here.  The ushers were sweet, helpful, and I enjoyed hearing them tawk.  And, being a sweet Southern gal, I come to New York expecting brusqueness, so I was pleasantly surprised by how amenable the employees are at the theater.I'd see another show here, for sure!  You should give Addams Family a shot, though, it's cute and silly and fun.",2,,

The play was hysterical! Nathan Lane is comedic genius so of course I had to by my wife some souvenirs. I bought her a Charles Addams print and a Wednesday Addams t-shirt plus a key chain which came out to $130, the print itself was $90. To anyone complaining about the seats in the mezzanine, you need to understand that the pricing teir in this theater reflects the quality of the seat, so you get what you pay for. The theater is small and they wanted to get more seats in the theater. The character in the play actually makes fun of the mezzanine at one point!Here's a hint if you do not want to spend alot of mony but would like a souvenir...just buy a soda! For 5 bucks you get the soda in a collectible cup which is real nice and included a thermos-like top. I recommend both the venue and the play, if you can sit orchestra you will have a great time, avoid the back of the mezzanine unless you are looking to save money.",5,1,1

It was rather intimate so I guess that gives off a good vibe for a broadway show- all the more better for the performers to hear the audience for action-reaction.I made the mistake of going to buy a program during intermission. You have to squeeze through everyone just to get by. So annoying. Then for the second half of the production, I had to sit all cramped because of my purchase was taking more leg room than I was.

(although i can see this show ROCKING the community theatre and high school theatre circuits) jerry zaks is a god when it comes to being a show doctor and i can only imagine how bad it was BEFORE he came into the picture. i saw an interview of him and all he had to say was ""you should have seen it in chicago.'*oh and shout out to PAUL who was in charge of the student rush-- LOVED that the box office forgot about us and we waited an additional hour for upper mezzanine seats....so thoughtful.",1,2,1
