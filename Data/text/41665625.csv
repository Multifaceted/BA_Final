My friends were catching a bus and they wanted a place which was close to the bus pick up location, and they wanted to be outside. We had about an hour to catch up and eat, and Forgetmenot was the perfect place to do so. Great fast service, delicious food especially the wings, and fun cocktails. Our server was also super friendly. I'd recommend this place for somewhere to take friends who are visiting and want a great experience.",,,
1,Juliya G.,"Washington, DC",299,92,166,3.0,11/16/2018,"This is a cute little neighborhood spot with lots of character.  We had the Greek Fries, which were decent.  They could stand to have a bit more crunch to them though.  We also tried the San Francisco Shrimp, definitely the winner of the two. It had a lot of great flavor!For my drink, I had my first Irish Coffee.  Although I have nothing to compare it to, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was warm and satisfying, not sweet, just like I like it.The waitstaff was great too. Marcelo, thanks for the memories.",,,

3,Jerome T.,"New York, NY",99,372,3046,3.0,9/30/2017,"I don't get it. Maybe, it's because I'm not a hipster. Maybe, it's because I consider fish tacos, a quinoa bowl & red stripe, blah. Maybe, I don't like the cheesy decor that's meant in jest, but is just over the top corny. There's nothing more corny to me then a bar that's 'dive bar' themed. ""Chinese"" decor meets LA taco stand/surf shop bars in NYC anyone? We should have a rule that these type of bars can only exist in California or... Bushwick/whatever's the new Williamsburg. After all, isn't that the type of transplant it's trying to cater to ? My bad, I forgot they've infested Chinatown, too.",7,8,6

5,Selina L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,71,24,4.0,4/21/2018,"I have to admit, I didn't want to like this place. I pass by it all the time and it is just so unapologetically hipster and crawling with the same likes of people. Yet I somehow found myself seated in a cozy little nook in the middle of the restaurant on some random Saturday afternoon, the only quiet spot in the whole place. I ordered the lamb pita - generously sized and perfectly grilled pita stuffed with the perfect portion of lamb and cucumbers and sauce. Came with a side of half salad/half fries too, which were actually quite tasty on their own. My friends ordered the greek pasta (loved how uncomplicated it was but still delicious), and the chicken avocado BLT (that sourdough bread is A++). A surprising hit was our side of BBQ chicken wings. The sound level and crowd can get pretty rowdy inside, so be warned if you're not into eating around noisy soccer fans (""football"", SORRY).",1,1,1

We placed our drink order and it was served right away. Later that evening we ordered nachos and they came hot and cheesy. I have nothing to complain about!,,,
8,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,3.0,6/18/2017,"3.5 stars.I came here to check out their fish tacos and the watermelon margarita. The fish tacos were decent. The batter was light and served on a bed of lettuce and radish, with two sauces on the side for you to build your flavors. I thought the fish could have been fried a minute or two longer, as the color was not quite golden brown for that flavor and textural contrasts. It also needed some sriracha to help it along as the sauces were both creamy. The margarita tasted a bit watered down for my liking, but perhaps I like stiffer drinks. But I did like the chill, SoCal vibe here, and the staff was quite friendly as well. I think good bar food overall - I was just on a mission for amazing fish tacos.",4,1,2

We found Forgtmenot on Yelp and they were one of the only local bars open. What a gem! Seriously, we weren't expecting this place to be so awesome! The decor is so cool and the service is great...and they make some MEAN DRINKS! Anything from their cocktail menu is going to be good. Personally, I became a fan of their spicy margarita. It's huge, strong, and not too badly priced considering its size. I may have had more than three...and less than ten. Yolo.Alcoholics need food, right? So we ordered nachos with steak and the hummus with veggies. Both were good. Also...I remember none of this but apparently we ordered the cornflake cookies. Why do I know this? There's a picture of them in my phone and in my Snapchat story...so I guess they were good too? Kudos to the staff that had to deal with my rowdy bunch.",5,4,2

The decor is trendy and the menu has a number of delicious items I was excited to try. I got the watermelon margarita for $11 which was delicious! Definitely recommend as it's a generous portion for a more than fair price. However, our server wasn't too friendly. Perhaps it was the stress from working a Saturday with a large crowd? Whatever it was, it was difficult to get more than a few words out her and she did not look pleased to be there. Words of wisdom: sometimes a smile goes a long way!",,,

Let's move on. Food: Nachos- under a layer of jalapeños our sad stale nachos sit w/ blah pieces of chicken. Whatever they were ok.Steak frites-charged to death w/ chimichurri that tasted nothing like chimichurri. Fries were lame as well and nothing could drown out the taste of char.

19,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",874,1242,25,4.0,4/15/2017,"Quirky and eclectic?  Divey? Yes.  But the food is good and it's cheap. This restaurant is related to Kiki's next door, which is a Greek place that I adore. Came here with a girlfriend for brunch - no reservation, we just walked in around 1230 brunch time and sat in the middle of the restaurant.  There weren't any outdoor tables available but they do have nice outdoor seating.  Think they can even seat larger parties, and might be fitting since the food is relatively inexpensive - $12-15!Service... they are a little spacey (slow, forgetting things). but if you call out their attention, they'll ensure your satisfaction... they have a decent amount of drinks (those of which aren't cheap and kinda eh, $9-11 range).  At brunch, they also have a lot of options for boozy coffee. I ordered a Mutticcano which was basically OJ, vodka, club soda (a screwdriver), and my friend had a grapefruit margarita (which she said was not very grapefruit-y) and another drink which I forget (there are plenty!).  For food, we shared the delicious and filling french toast bites, and the large, well-charred shrimps (incredible portion!). She had the steak and eggs - skirt steak, eggs your style, toast.  I had the avocado toast, with a side of bacon (2 pieces - but $2).  The portions are perfect for the sides.  We ordered off the brunch menu, but the lunch menu also has a lot of small and large plates - burgers, sandwiches, salads- many of which are Greek inspired, and some of the menu is even FROM Kiki's. Pre tip it was about $80. Which isn't bad including alcohol.",4,2,4

22,Lindsey S.,"New York, NY",317,231,155,4.0,4/20/2017,"Forgetmenot is at the corner of Division & Ludlow, just a few blocks from the East Broadway (F) station. The atmosphere is unique and quirky, with dive bar vibes. I could tell that our waitress didn't want to be there. She wasn't rude, but definitely seemed uninterested. I ordered the Watermelon (seasonal) Margarita and OH MY. Okay, so I ordered three... It was so yummy. For food, I got the Chicken Avocado BLT, which comes with shoestring fries. It was pretty good! Note: The menu I see online is different from what was in store, so just an FYI. My friend ordered the Pan-Seared Chicken Plate and golfed it down in about 5 minutes, so I'm guessing he enjoyed it.

I like mine spicy, personally, but I'm sure the mild version is delicious as well. This juicy little libation is summer in a glass, and Forgtmenot is a great place to tumble into when you're on the lower-lower east side. The vibe is cozy -- more divey than polished, which makes it a great place for a casual group dinner with a group of good buds, or a final stop after dinner at the slightly more elevated Kiki's, which I should mention is owned by the same crew. If you're in it for the long haul, the food at Forgtmenot is simple and filling -- the fish tacos are a huge portion, so I'd suggest sharing, especially because you'll want to save room for the delicious Greek fries.",2,2,1

The food is good but what's great are the prices!! It's just nice to find an establishment that's not ripping you off and over charging you for things. What's even better is that there are so many options to choose from. What I LOVE is how generous their staff are. They have this splendid jalapeño yogurt dip and you can honestly dip anything with it. We had grilled shrimp, sweet potato fries, grilled chicken and steak and we lathered everything up with that sauce. So when I mean they were generous..they gave us cups after cups of them without charging us!! You know every other place in NYC would have charged you! Ugh. You'll find this generosity consistent among all of their restaurants...Kikis, Monroe and Little Chair. We love all their restaurants but we may have found the winner of the 4. The vibe, the food, the service, the prices...it all checks off. Bravo!! P.S there's always a wait at Kikis so I love that they serve 3 items from that restaurant over here at Forgtmenot.

35,Victoria S.,"Flushing, NY",272,29,48,4.0,8/15/2016,"I came here on a Friday, around 1:30PM, to get brunch with two friends. This place is small and would probably suit smaller groups (3-4 people). One of our friends was late so my friend and I decided to just wait for her in the restaurant because it was scorching hot. They were really nice and didn't rush us to order or anything. We just sipped on our waters and talked for a while before deciding to order Greek fries because our friend was taking so long and we were starving. The plate of Greek fries was big. The fries were thin and were just crispy enough. Paired with the feta cheese, it was delicious. I devoured the fries and by the time our friend came, there was only a couple of fries left on the plate.I ordered the Egg Avocado Toast and my friends ordered the Travis Bowl and the Breakfast Burrito. I didn't try their dishes but both looked really good and the portions were generous. My order was good and the egg was bigger than the toast itself! I loved how fresh the avocado was and the seasoning was good. However, if you're bad at handling spiciness, you should let your waitress know because my lips were tingling after eating from the pepper flakes! This place has a really hip and cozy vibe and I can see myself coming back to try other dishes for brunch :).",1,,

In a quiet oasis of closed buildings I found this haven open and welcoming to my kind. As I wandered into this bar you could tell by the decor that whoever decorated it had a great passion for the style and culture a bar needs. The man behind the bar was welcoming offering anything we needed from coffee to something stronger. He was as handsome as he was charming working the bar while finding time to sneak a peek at the match. If this was the type of bar to be so welcoming to us at the crack of dawn.

I ordered a chicken quesadilla and was scared it'll come back looking like a disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure if it was because I was already a mojito in (on an empty stomach, and oh, that baby was strong) , but it was wonderfully delicious.The Bathroom was interesting..

The truth of the matter is this might not have been the right spot for me, who prefers order and zen to crowds, loud fun, and the potential for nachos. It's a pleasant spot. We were seated in the front room quite close to the door which on a cold night meant a retreat back into our hats and jackets. Sitting in one of the quirky rooms further back may have been a little more my speed. We were in the scrum, people floating in and out for a look see, some standing near the bar.The SERVICE was affable and attentive. My companion had a nice Malbec, I had a ginger ale which I think was served in a jar (shudder). But about that jar - it was refilled by a few other servers and they all knew I was drinking ginger ale. Attention to detail noted with appreciation. The FOOD WAS FINE. The lamb meatballs needed a bit of salt which the waiter was happy to provide. The Moussaka (from the beloved sister restaurant Kiki's) was heaven although I'm not sure if it should have been sizzling hot when it came out. Instead of being just above warm. I haven't been to Greece, it's true. So I don't know. THE PRICES WERE IMPRESSIVELY LOW. So really I shouldn't be griping.",,1,

Luckily on a night I was desperate for a change, I gave this place a shot and it was wonderful. It's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside, the decor is kitschy/ inviting and the music was decent (they kept it neutral with 1980s hip hop).

You don't know what to talk about. You forget which questions you've already asked. Luckily, you're at Forgtmenot where the cocktails are creative, strong and reasonably priced. After a few rounds of watermelon margaritas the conversation is still strained. You go in for a kiss, since that's easier than talking. You make-out for 10 minutes. Everyone around you is uncomfortable. You come up for air. Despite the cool atmosphere and dim lighting, you both feel nothing. You awkwardly explain why you need to leave and both head your separate ways. Another date bites the dust.",,3,

There's stuff all over the walls, especially the bathroom, intimate colored lighting, and a DVD collection. The space is cozy, with only a few tables and a small bar. The menu is similarly limited. I disagree with Yelp categorizing this place as ""burgers/fast food"". It's definitely not fast food, just American with some hints of Latin, though they do have a burger on the menu. I got the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce and fries for $16. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious, though the cut itself wasn't the best, it was on the fatty side. There's an outdoor area that in the winter they outfit with space heaters and blankets. Our server was really friendly and nice. Check out their special cocktail menu. I got a dark and stormy for $11. Dark rum with ginger and lemon and something else, pretty good.

I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the waitress. I ordered the brunch nachos and it was fantastic, the menu says enough for two and they told no lies, I ate less than half and was full as a tick. I also downed 2 well prepared margaritas, apple cider & peach. There was a movie on the tv and music playing, not sure the station but I heard lots of Britney Spears and that made me happy. I will definitely be back to try more food. I saw some other orders come out and they all looked great. Please don't change!!",,,1

I remembered how large of a portion the nachos were from the last time I had been here, so the waitress offered to split the portion in half as well as the cost. It still ended up being more than enough for me and my friend :) You absolutely have to try the Dark & Stormy cocktail, it's a drink that both light-weights and moderates can appreciate. Quesadillas and lamb pita were amazing and so moist! Will definitely be back!Tip: The bathroom is quite an attraction!

We tried to ask for salt and pepper but couldn't get her attention. I was this close to just going to grab it myself. The limeade and orangeade virtually had no flavor. Tasted like seltzer with a slice of citrus. I wasn't expecting juice or anything sweet but at least something that tasted not like water. Very cute for pictures, but If I wanted water I would've just stuck without ordering a drink. Pretty underwhelmed by this place considering all the good reviews.",4,2,1

You want to tell everyone about it, but you can't, the wife will be heartbroken, the husband devastated. This is what I feel when I think about this place. A neighborly place where everybody knows each other, which is cool since we live in a city of 9 million strangers. Excellent fish tacos, and pretty kickass nachos. They have 2 draft beers which include UFO and Harpoon's IPA. Do not miss the spicy watermelon margaritas. Overall, a great night with great friends, and awesome Jane Fonda as Barbarella on-screen.

83,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, NY",117,327,83,4.0,3/29/2015,"I like this place. It's cute and fun and eclectic and just awesome. The servers are awesome (even if they yell right above you on hectic nights) and that one Australian server is a total cutie. Plus, where else are you going to find an Arsenal scarf draped next to a Chelsea flag and jersey... with the England flag and the Wales flag all in the mix? Like I said - very eclectic.The margaritas were pretty much our favorite cocktails of the night. They didn't have spicy watermelon (boo), but the cranberry orange one was absolutely delicious. The rosebud was very strong as was the other cocktail I had... next time, R & I decided to just stick with the margaritas.I had the fish tacos (amazing), R had the cheeseburger (she was obsessed), and we shared the pizzetta. For some reason, half the pizzetta was fine, and the other half was so spicy I drained the rest of my margarita in one go. I wish the place was a bit bigger, or the tables were further apart so I'd have somewhere to hang my coat whilst I ate but I don't think anybody at the bar ended up stepping on it (I draped it on the back of my chair). Plus, those nachos at the table next to us looked so good I almost reached over and grabbed a chip. Thank goodness for self control... and for my friend kicking me under the table when I was tempted.We also ended up getting the chocolate mousse - pretty much the perfect way to end the meal. It was exactly as our waitress described - a mix between pudding and fudge. Topped with whipped cream and strawberries? Absolute heaven.I'm definitely coming back again. Hopefully next time, they'll have the spicy watermelon margarita I keep hearing about. And I'll also grab a plate of nachos... and now I really want nachos.--Notes:- The prices on their website are a bit lower than the prices on their menu at their restaurant.- Those margaritas were really really good.- They didn't have that mushroom polenta on their printed menu... which is why I got the fish tacos.- Definitely don't skip that chocolate mousse. Especially if you like chocolate.",1,1,

93,Fred P.,"New York, NY",18,3,0,5.0,9/17/2014,"""A classic case for Bar Rescue""Let's just say that if you don't have a designer skate board, rolled up jeans, an outfit with at least 3 accessories, partially shaved hair, 3,000 instagram followers, an accent, a tattoo, a reputation, your own logo, an imported velour jumper, a business card that lists multiple talents, or a story of how you ripped through a 6-foot tube at Rockaway 2 hours ago you might feel out of place at this surf & skate, bar & restaurant in Chinatown. Just when you thought you could slink up to a bar and down a triple bourbon or do some day drinking with a couple of pals without playing keg soccer in the street, hatching up plans for your own magazine or doing body shots with an otter, think again. You might get free drinks, yes, but that usually comes at a price, and it's in the form of a couple of your fries and having to chat with an attractive and interesting staff member who is stubbornly set on making your day a good one. Some people might think that FMN is where ""hipsters go to die,"" but with all the revelry that takes place every day and night, it's actually where eccentrics go to fit in.Most regulars swear that it's a perfect sanctuary, but until they add ice cream sundaes, hot sake and quinoa, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.

103,Kenny L.,"New York, NY",2,3,9,4.0,4/7/2015,"Went there on a weekday in the afternoon. No wait at all and the server was very attentive. The food was delicious, ordered the nachos, pulled pork sliders, chorizo tacos and a Greek fries for appetizers. Everything was pretty good with the exception of the fries. I would have liked the feta to be melted on the fries and it could really use some other seasoning. Had the lamb pita for entree and it was pretty decent. I wish there was just a bit more sauce on it. My fellow diner had the eggs with pulled pork and baked beans. From what I sampled, the beans were very flavorful and soft. The pulled pork was tender and tasty. Only real downside of the store is the location. It is located on a block that isn't very popular and if I was walking by I wouldn't think to go in. It is only after reading yelp and looking at the pictures that made me plan to go here. The decor is a bit boring but not offensive. The outside could really use some sprucing up to attract more customers. Also there really wasn't a prominent sign out front so I wasn't sure if I was at the right place at first.

Forgetmenot is a cozy little space on Division Street that seemingly always has surf flicks or 90s movies playing on their television screen. In the summer, the windows open up and you can enjoy the breeze while you sip on your Harpoon IPA. In the winter time, they set up a little vestibule area so you don't freeze your pachuquilla (totally a word) off while you drink a margarita and dream of summer. The best part of being here is the greek fries with crumbled feta. Yummm. The ""worst"" would be that it's a really small spot - not ideal for groups or smelly people, but ideal for hanging with a few close homies (who've showered that day and/or use breath mints).",2,5,6

Decor and atmosphere is cute, very shabby chic, with heated outdoor seating that's always a bonus. We had margs (delicious) and a just few nibbles off the menu. The chilli was my favorit. Just the right amount of spice to ward off my cold and the perfect choice with chips and guac. The fries were pretty spectacular too - as far as fries go. Looking forward to going back for brunch. Love this neighborhood.",1,,2

120,Anil B.,"West Chester, PA",7,9,0,5.0,5/10/2013,"OK.. the fries here are the best in the lower east side. This is a fun, laid back place..

121,Elena D.,"New York, NY",28,99,360,5.0,4/30/2015,"I love this place so much, it's my go to spot. It has a very ""LES"" vibe, feels welcoming and home-y. My favorite spot to sit is by the window with the Mexican blankets when it's cold out, otherwise I enjoy sitting outside while my roommate's pooch is ogling at our food. And rightfully so because the food is bomb. It's so dank, I've literally never hD a bad experience with the food here. And it may say that I've checked in 8times but I know I've been here more than that. The only thing on the menu I guess I don't find that greAt is the halumi cheese, tastes like nothing, but so do most cheeses in the U.S. The Boston breakfast is great, the egg nachos are one of my favorite brunch meals and I'm waiting for the spicy watermelon margarita to make a comeback, because those were incredible. Pita dippers is a great appetizers and now they even have veggie dippers, plenty of healthy choices you can make here. The Only thing i noticed that could be improved is service. When they are busy everything runs smoothly and they turn tables pretty quick, but when no ones really there and the restaurant is slow I feel like the servers automatically assume that the patrons want to take it easy as well, but that's not always the case. They should just try to speed it up a bit even when it's a slow day. Otherwise love this place, one of my favorites in the city.",,1,
122,Red Y.,"Manhattan, NY",2,39,4,4.0,7/3/2015,"Such a fun little place! Went for drinks with friends and had some nachos and fries.

Kept walking....slowed down...said...""hey, should we check it out? it looks like our kind of place?""...answered ""yes"" and spent a good part of the rest of the afternoon enjoying the laid back, fun, creative, and SUNDAY FUNDAY perfect atmosphere. Decently priced drinks (think, $7 glasses of wine, $5 beers, $10 cocktails) and fun food with a Med flair: greek fries with feta and oregano! grilled holumni cheese salad...

During the summer this place is sooo much fun.. the watermelon and cucumber margaritas are amazing!!!!!! The Prisini salad is DELICIOUS!!

They act as if they ""OWN"" this hole- joint.

My friends and I were just chatting quietly minding our own business when the owner/manager decided to act like a bully out of the blue.

142,Gina C.,"New York, NY",0,9,1,4.0,10/5/2015,"I came here for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night, and there was a little bit of a wait. The space is very small and tight, but very eccentrically decorated and the atmosphere is perfect for a laidback night for great drinks and delicious food. We ordered the lamb meatballs, nachos, and Greek fries, and everything was delicious! The nachos come with a generous serving of guacamole on the side which was amazing. Portions are extremely generous -- we ordered these three plates off the ""shared/small plates"" menu for two girls and we could barely finish half of them! I ordered the dark and stormy(?) drink, which was made with rum, apple cider, and something else I'm forgetting, but it was absolutely delicious. The only downer for me was the slightly demanding demeanor from a woman who looked like she was maybe the owner or manager. My friend and I were initially seated at a 4 seater table with another party of 2. This was fine with us, but the owner/manager didn't actually ask us if this was okay before seating us -- she came up to us and told us ""you guys are sitting here,"" which I was a little taken aback by. The other two people at the table ended up leaving, so we had the table to ourselves. After our food and drinks had come out, the owner/manager came by our table and told us we might need to move because they were very busy. She saw the food on our table, though, and seemed to rethink it, and I heard her mutter to herself that it was unfortunate that she couldn't move us since we already had our food, and then looked at us and told us that she usually doesn't seat just two people at a 4 seater. She wasn't extremely rude about it, but just the way she went about this was slightly off-putting and made us feel like we needed to rush or that we were really inconveniencing them (but we had left the two remaining seats at our table open if they wanted to seat 2 other people with us!). This won't stop me from coming back because the food and drinks were really great, but just a small thing that made me feel a little unwelcome/rushed. Otherwise everything else was great! I particularly love the eclectic mixture of the variety of food and drinks they have here, and I want to come back for brunch!",,,

What a shame.  I came back just to have those grilled fish tacos again.  So sorry that they're off the menu.
