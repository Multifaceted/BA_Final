0,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,324,577,4.0,9/16/2018,"Nice laid back place to get a drink or a bite to eat on the banks of the Hudson River. It's the self serve, counter service type where you get a buzzer that goes off when your food is ready to be picked up. They have a decent drink selection: 4-5 beers on tap, wines and cocktails, and really good white wine sangria! Food here is not too bad either, I've had the burger and it was fairly good. Seems like they have a decent seafood selection as well, so will probably give that a shot the next time I'm here.This is definitely a very kid-and-pet friendly spot, so expect to see your fair share of dogs and strollers. Overall a good place with reasonably priced fare, ideal to spend a relaxed summer afternoon or early evening.",,,

Updated review","Wow, Pier I will always have a special place in my heart!Pier I came back strong this year, after disappointing last year! It, now, has an updated menu with delicious and affordable items! You can finally add bacon to your burgers! The drink menu is also on a new level!Please find a way of keeping this business open ALL YEAR LONG! :(",,,
2,Michelle L.,"Melbourne, FL",165,19,2,1.0,8/29/2018,"I came here while on vacation and was covering a large portion of my family's tab. I get a random $40.29 charge additional to my tab that I notice after leaving. I called for a simple explanation thinking maybe it's a holding charge which would be weird but let's see. They said it was because of the first round of drinks I ordered when starting the tab but then when I added that up that was $52.00 so that's not right. Eric the manager or owner just looked at me and came up with the response ""well that always happens I can assure you it will be taken off"" with an ugly smile at me like I'm an idiot. He told me to call him when the pending goes away to say he was right. All I wanted was a solid reason behind this charge. The poor server was getting so flustered trying to explain the charge but they really had no solid answer for me but to just wait. Obviously there was a mistake for that specific amount.So I wait a few days right and guess what :) the $40 charge came off, but now I have an additional charge of my whole original tab!!!!!! What a mess. Sorry Eric I didn't call you, I called my bank to file a claim and remove that. Disgusting I will never go back and I warn all of you not to ever talk to crooked Eric.",,,
3,Amber B.,"Hudson County, NJ",713,309,861,5.0,7/11/2018,"Thanks to Yelp for connecting me with this gem as it's easily become one of my favs for the summertime. If you're looking to get away from a lot of the city bars, noise, and same ole city things, this is your place. I like to come here to enjoy a nice drink, view and their food. Nothing on the money will break the bank as this is merely a chill spot to come to relax, hang out and enjoy. Good for both large groups and smaller groups, I would recommend Pier i Cafe on a nice day/night.",14,4,13
4,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,4.0,7/22/2018,"I stumbled on this gem on a bikeride, and it seems that it's somewhat hidden and forgotten about, as everyone I have mentioned it to has never heard of it. Since finding it a few weeks ago, I have come back twice and I am obsessed. It's off the bike path of the Hudson, overlooking a long pier that often has live music, outdoor movies and exercise classes. It is remote from the city, has amazing views, and is the perfect outdoor bar/restaurant. The drinks are very reasonable priced and delicious. The fish tacos were okay, and the fries were okay. Neither were as impressive as I wanted, but I think this is a place you go for the views and drinks. Gsters chicken sandwich and salad however was delicious, so I think it's just a matter of trying different food options.",2,,1
5,Tulsa H.,"New York, NY",626,253,82,3.0,6/26/2018,"Been coming here 2-3 times a week ever since the weather got warmer. food is average, price is high. however, the scenery is great and very convenient.Although this place is self-service, neither the diners clean-up after themselves nor it is obvious where they should throw away the trashes. management might want to consider making sure tables get clean up way more frequently.also, since this is self-service, do ensure that the DEFAULT for credit card payment is other than requiring tips.",11,1,4

7,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,3.0,6/7/2018,"Tucked away on the Upper West Side is Pier i Cafe, a nearly hidden outdoor cafe that sits on the pier looking out to New Jersey and beautiful sunsets. I first came to this venue about a year ago with some friends. Just this evening I came here and the experience was the same as last year except I got to experience some pretty solid customer service!First of all, if you come here and aren't a local you need to enter on W68th Street and Riverside Blvd. If you are a local, you can walk from wherever it is you're coming from along Hudson River Park. Either way, this place may be tucked away behind towering condominiums and underneath the West Side Highway but it's easy to spot all of the lime green umbrellas. At the entrance, it's usually best if you hop on line and review one of their menus kept on the side of the wall. By the time it's your turn, you can place your order. The menu isn't too bad, there's a small assortment of small plates, mains, desserts and even some side dishes and alcoholic beverages. If you're having food, whether it be a lobster roll, salad or hamburger, you receive a little buzzer that goes nuts when it's time for you to pick up your food at the counter. Since this is an outside and uber casual venue, your best bet is to divide and conquer with friends meaning one of you saves a table and the other picks up the food. Which by the way isn't anything outstanding but it gets the job done! Want a frozé and lobster roll or beer and ice cream sandwich? Done. In terms of customer service, you won't get much except a smile and cashiers who get you in and out the line quickly. Tonight one of them accidentally charged me for a pitcher of beer ($28) instead of one glass ($7). I raised this issue to the manager who was very apologetic and polite and promptly took back my card to give me back the difference (which he said would be given to me in cash but they somehow made the card work). As the night went on, the same manager went around the tables and tidied everything up and worked alongside the servers who were floating around to clear up tables. Last year I don't remember staff being so attentive to customers or the space itself so it's nice to see the turnaround. Even if you're not crazy about the food, I'd say this place is more about the views of the river and sunset along that allows you to escape from the day-to-day bustle of the city. Will definitely come back another time!",2,,
8,Jess C.,"New York, NY",61,95,266,4.0,6/17/2018,Good place to relax and hang out in the Riverside Park. Food is decent. Liked the crispy calamari a lot.,1,,
9,Fabe F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0,3.0,11/8/2018,"Good neighborhood diner. Good standard dishes. Salads, sandwiches, burgers. Friendly atmosphere and good service. Very good spot for lunch in the neighborhood. A few celebrities eat there.",,,
10,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,165,3.0,5/16/2018,"I enjoy this café. I live pretty much behind it so it is very convenient. They're a bit pricey for what it is, but I'm sure they have to survive somehow in that location.  I've gone a couple times.  They have a very good cucumber margarita. However, my last experience there left a bad taste in my mouth. When ordering the girl was new and being trained.  She ended up missing some of the order and I noticed when going to pick up the food from the window. The first girl tried to argue with me, the second one pulled the receipt and said our missing calamari wasn't on the order. That's fine, I know for a fact I said calamari, no need for the staff to be rude about it. They didn't try to remedy the situation at all, but told me the kitchen was still open if I wanted to order something else. I feel like every other restaurant in the entire world would have offered to comp the calamari, seeing how we had already spent around 60$, it's not like I was trying to get something for free.",,,
11,Dare M.,"Manhattan, NY",294,81,100,5.0,5/12/2018,"This is the perfect place to dine when there's nice weather. The view of the river is so calming and people watching is fun too. I really enjoyed the menu, I had the grilled chicken sandwich, which I pretty much scoffed down in one bite. It was tender, juicy, delicious  Favorite part about spring is the cocktails and here the special was jalapeño watermelon margarita. It's a dangerous drink because it's so good you could drink 3 and not realize it's all going to your head. Lastly I finished my meal with an espresso chocolate chip ice cream sandwich!! Omg it was delightful !!!! I'd highly recommended this place for families, co-workers, or just a group of friends. It's a chill place and the food is good. - @agirlsgottaeatt",,,

13,D N.,"New York, NY",2,73,36,4.0,8/28/2018,This is a nice outdoor cafe where you can bring your dogs and have a drink :) pitchers of sangria are good as well as a few appetizers. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area. Great place to relax by the water.,,,
14,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,4.0,6/21/2017,"Did you know there is a bike and running path that goes all the way up the west side of Manhattan along the river?   Riverside Park is long, and miles away from the blurry rush of buildings, rats, cabs, and halal stands. Along the path, which I take regularly from the 130s down to TriBeCa, there is a variety of activities from sunning on the lawn, reading a book on a bench, to basketball courts and tennis courts.Ideally, there are two pitstops uptown, the Boat Basin at 79th, and Pier 1 cafe at 70th.Both feel a bit tangential to the park experience, and perhaps even city sponsored, with Boat Basin more of a place to drink beer with a grown up frat party atmosphere, to Pier 1 cafe a more family friendly parkside food court.The table area is fairly new with outdoor lawn chair seating that you might find at a water park.  The sea air is fresh, a mix of salty wind and hot garbage.Order at the counter from a simple menu of things like quinoa salad $12, fries $5, calamari and burgers.  The food looked a step above your average amusement/ ball park.  At 2pm on a Tuesday in June the place felt surprisingly relaxing, even tho the hum of cars overhead from the freeway is non stop, and the random scavenger request from a pigeon is inevitable.The view of New Jersey isn't exactly breathtaking, but it is a nicer outdoor patio with trees and plants. Access to the cafe is right off the path, so coming from the street will require a good walk with plenty of stairs.My cup of coffee was $2 and while not super strong, wasn't weak, and had decent flavor.",8,1,7
15,Linda C.,"Livingston, CA",44,3,28,4.0,7/31/2018,"Cute place by the water, great drinks and good.  I had the steak & it was perfect! My friend had the shrimp skewers and we both left nothing on the plate!",,,
16,Stephanie C.,"Princeton Junction, West Windsor Township, NJ",7,94,89,5.0,8/5/2018,"Great food and great scenery. This place is an outdoor cafe that serves American food. It's right next to the park that extends out to the Hudson River. I came here late at night around 8am on a summer night, and you can see sunset. It's a place with not a lot of tourists, so it is very relaxing. This isn't your typical city-like New York. Instead, it's less crowded, and you see a lot more nature.",,,
17,Tinesi P.,"Manhattan, NY",118,48,178,4.0,7/20/2018,The burger was yummy! It hit all the right gingery spots. The fries were good too just not like the burger. Service was was quick despite the crowd.,,,
18,Othelia J.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2,94,78,5.0,6/10/2018,"I think this outdoor cafe is nice. 2nd time we stop in here for lunch after hiking down from on the west side from the George Washington Bridge. Great burgers, real good and lean beef. Salads great to. For Manhattan prices not to bad. Full bar but we are more interested in the coffee. Free water for all. I really like that touch. Real friendly staff as well. We will go back again anytime Hugs",1,,
19,Neha P.,"Manhattan, NY",45,143,201,4.0,11/30/2017,"I have frequented this cafe on many midsummer afternoons and nights. During the lunch/afternoon hours the lines are relatively long, so be prepared for a 5-10 minute wait to order, and then another solid 15-20 minutes for your food to arrive, obviously depending on what you ordered. To state the obvious, you pay a premium for the location, and for the convenience of the cafe in the heart of a bustling part of Riverside park. But I have always been surprised that the quality of the food is still pretty decent. Maybe it is because I had low expectations for a seemingly small shop on the river, but we are always satisfied with our orders. The menu itself is smartly designed to be simple and offer 1-2 solid options for vegetarians, pescatarians, omnivores, etc. That allows them to serve pretty good food.As mentioned in other reviews, the fries are a solid bet. Hummus as well is good for starters. We've gotten the burgers as well which are ok, but good to pair with a bucket of beers on a summer day. The area is beautiful and the pier juts out into the Hudson to get great views of Jersey and the Riverside high rises.The few negatives are the congested space, great difficulty finding seats on weekends, and sometimes having to guard your fries from the pigeons!",1,1,1
20,Joyful D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,54,213,5.0,9/19/2018,I love this cafe! They're only open during the summer but it's a great spot for light drinking or hangout with friends. They have an awesome view and love their fries.,,,
21,Hege M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,121,289,3.0,6/24/2018,"The outdoor cafe on 70th Street and Riverside Park South is conveniently open every day weather permitted. They even have a bike rack for those of us on two wheels. You'll be able to see it from a distance, glowing bright green. Plenty of tables and chairs, abundantly adorned in greenery. A nice place to make a rest stop and get a cold beverage or so I thought. I tried the skinny piña and boy do they need to train their bar tenders. I had to go back and adjust it several times to no avail. I left it mostly untouched. On the menu they boasts high quality ingredients. I'm not holding my breath. Regardless the food and drinks it's a lovely informal setting on the pier where one can relax and observe the activity on the river.",,,
22,Meg S.,"Rockaway Park, New York, NY",1,28,13,3.0,9/12/2018,"I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars. The scenery being right on the Hudson River is beautiful and the food is amazing. The only problems I had were being outside the birds were flying around constantly as I ate and the kitchen despite being told it opens at 11:30, it opened more about 11:45. I would be willing to give this place another shot because the workers were all so friendly as well!",,,
23,Kat T.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,1.0,5/23/2018,"This is a review about the service because it was tremendously appalling - I hope management can correct this system because it is extremely disheartening. We were very eager to try Pier I Cafe. We came here for dinner and a drink. We both went up to the front of house to determine what to get, I then go to snag a seat while my partner orders. He's carded after ordering the beer (this isn't the issue)... the issue is begins here: once he gives his NY STATE ID, he is called to question - ""What's your name?"" ""What's your address"" assuming it's fake.1. if your job is to serve alcohol in the city, you should know what a real New York state ID looks like. 2. It's ONLY his job to check if we are of age and if the ID is real. We don't have to disclose any personal information. But if you want to invade our privacy, it's right there on the card so don't be smart. But my partner goes along with it only to have his time wasted and get denied (the first of five times) for this reason: in case I (who had sat down) was underage. But we give them the benefit of the doubt. I give my ID to my partner since I had to watch my bike - he is denied a second time for this reason: I need to be there.So we both get up, at this point stressed. The charades continued because after handing him my card myself, I was fact checked AS WELL with the same dumb question.... We were denied a third time BC I don't want to play this game anymore. You refuse to serve us because I won't tell you info that is right in front of you? Cmon bud. I am of age BUT the fact that the only thing that can prove whether it's real is my 'memorization skills' and not his skills as someone who's job includes checking IDs is pretty outrageous. Plus I have a NJ ID... Pier I Cafe is right on the Hudson River AKA he literally faces NJ at work! He SHOULD ALSO know what this ID looks like since it's probably the second most common one given!!  This part is the worst: he refused to give me my card back. I had to demand for it multiple times!! How on earth is that an OK way to treat people? Not at any point did he consult for a second opinion from a more knowledgeable coworker. This was 100% a power trip.I brought up my frustration. It became so achingly clear that he just didn't want to serve us; he sees hundreds of IDs at this job and he must have known in reality. A coworker came by, took one glance at the ID, and knew for certain. But even after being told that, he denied us a fourth time - still putting his foot down and insisting to badger us with more questions.By then we were so appalled that we didn'twant to support this type of treatment by staying, we just wanted out. We told this man all of our points above and he said, assuming just so he could have the final word, that he would refuse to serve us for ""being irate"". The fifth time, but at this point we were as good as gone.Look, we've previously worked in the service industry, including serving alcohol. We know rules are rules but there was no acceptable reason as to why were treated like that. ""Just doing your job"" is not the excuse - get someone who is actually capable if you are unsure. We've been carded at numerous places and never had this happen. We turned to walk away while this guy shooed us saying ""go catch the next train home"".",,,
24,Erika D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",15,37,2,5.0,8/10/2018,"Cool place to enjoy summer nights just by the river. Amazing view. Food is standard, good fried potatoes. Kind service and you won't smell street garbage!! (Which is great for outside seating)",,,
25,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,134,290,4.0,7/16/2017,"I love this place for lunch/dinner in the summertime.  A great place to meet up with friends, to impress a date, or to show off the city to guests from out of town.  My only criticisms are that it's always packed, and also that there are aggressive french-fry-grabbing birds all around (watch your back). My favorites are the Blackened Salmon, and the Pier I Burger, but I don't think you can really go wrong. Grilled skirt steak was good, but slightly over-seasoned. Sangria is crisp and refreshing, there's a great selection of summery beer/wine, and the frozen rose specialty cocktail is a lot stronger than it looks.",1,,

27,Taryn C.,"New York, NY",274,729,37,3.0,7/8/2017,"**more like 3 1/2 stars**Despite the fact that I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 9 years, I've only been here twice. The first time was a weekday afternoon so it was pretty dead.  The second time was a Sunday almost close to dusk. WAY busier that time! I came here on the recommendation of several friends. Most of them said: you MUST have the burger.  I'm a mediumRare kind of girl with my burgs, but I ordered medium (some places have it mooing and I wanted to try it safe first). And it was very dry. Also the fries were touted as ""old bay"" but they're really truffle. I like truffle fries, don't get me wrong. But when a gal wants old bay, you best not disappoint. The second time, hubs got the burger. He, too, had the same complaint. We've had great experiences with the Pat Lafrieda burger joints around but this was one disappointing.This is a great place to get a pitcher of sangria or a frozen drink and people watch. The pier itself had live music on Sunday nights. The ""just OK"" burger experience wasn't enough to keep me away. I'll definitely be back. But maybe not at a busy or dead time. I'm kinda like Goldilocks -  looking for a time that's ""just right!""",,,
28,Emilie B.,"Midtown - Downtown, Columbia, SC",335,20,15,3.0,7/7/2018,"Great atmosphere but average food. The views by the pier are well worth the experience all together, especially on a summer evening the sunset was amazing. You order at the counter and pick up your food at the window, and so it is a little overpriced considering there is no table service anything. The lobster roll was good but not noteworthy, but we loved the thin crispy fries! The calamari and ceasar salad were also both good but not the best I've ever had. There were also a lot of birds picking at leftover food on the tables which created a lot of mess, and there aren't really any employees who walk around to clean or maintain the area. Would be nicer if they either 1) made it more of a sit down restaurant with service, or 2) made it more like open public tables where you can bring your own food and drinks if you want",,,
29,Reva R.,"New York, NY",391,162,2424,4.0,8/26/2016,"Wonderful location! Overlooking /On the water. Nice staff. Great Old Bay fries. Very nice menu.You order at the food service area, & you bring the food to your table. I like that! There is a utensil/condiments & cold water urn area just a few steps away from where you pick up your food. I had a hotdog ($3) & Old Bay fries ($4 .My friend had a hotdog with corn on the cob, cut in 2pcs.My friend said her hotdog was delicious & so was her corn.  Earlier in the day, my friend discovered this place--after visiting the Dr. Oz TV Studio to be in the audience--she walked around & found this gem of a place, & she had a lobster roll, which came with small salad & Old Bay fries.  She said she enjoyed it. It was $22.Now, it is allergy season, so  that could be why my hotdog had no flavor at all, ZERO--it tasted like it had been boiled, & I really think it was--however, I tasted every other flavor on my plate--sauerkraut, mustard, bun.. The wonderful fries--ketchup--All fine. So, I just think that I got a tasteless hot dog. So, that's why I gave 4 stars, instead of 5. REALLY GREAT FRIES! I had the fries that are called ""Old Bay"". I will definitely go back because it's a nice menu with something for everyone....salads & much more.  It's so nice to be able to enjoy outdoor seating with a water view. AN INSTANT VACATION! I definitely recommend this place, but, I would selfishly like to keep it under the radar, because it's really, really a treat!! I want to explore other items on the menu. I asked a staff person & he said they closed sometime in September--he didn't have a definite idea of WHEN. IF PIER I should happen to read this, I would urge you to try Hebrew National Hotdogs, there's lots of flavor & no filler-junk in 'em. And even if you boiled them, there would still be flavor. But grilling AFTER you boil would really help WITH ANY HOT DOG. Nice place, nice menu. Next time perhaps I'll try one of their PAT LA FRIDA HAMBURGERS, or a lovely salad.  And, those fries....mmmmm.",6,1,4

41,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,4.0,9/21/2015,"Peaceful and scenic views of the Hudson River, quality food, friendly service and dog-friendly outdoor seating area - what more could you ask for? Pier i Cafe is a bit hidden, tucked under the highway overpass right along the Hudson River...I would've never ventured this way if I didn't know about this place. Best way to get here is through the park entrance on 68th Street, go down the long incline pathway and you'll see the green umbrellas. You order your food at the counter and pick up at the end of the counter, no servers, which is a plus! Friendly service at the counter. There are plenty of things to choose from like burgers and hot dogs, but I went with the lobster roll, which was good - could've used a bit more seasoning - but it was a good portion of lobster. I was pleased with the quality, wasn't expecting it from an outdoor cafe. It came with a side salad and fries, both good. Love their selection of draft beers, got an Ommegang white, seems to be my favorite brand lately. You can get something for cheap, like a hot dog and beer and spend very little or you can splurge on the more expensive items like the $22 lobster roll. My favorite part about this place is that it's dog friendly - yay!!! That means you don't have to leave you pooch at home, you can bring them and they can enjoy the outdoor time too :)",5,3,3

43,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,5.0,8/3/2016,"Ahhh perfect place for a summer night in the city- incredible view of the Hudson and beautiful sunset at this casual but very nice lively feeling cafe/ restaurant with great food and drinks. Great for a date, friends, families (kids menu), cyclists who can park off the west side path to eat, and even following a class along the Hudson- as women near us had just come from a Pilates class on the river before having dinner watching the sunset.The view the view the view. Amazing.  Everything was fantastic and a walk along the river, down the pier just outside, a fantastic follow up after drinks or dinner and at night romantic with the pretty views.Atmosphere: plenty of seating, cozy with pretty potted flowers surrounding much of the dining area.  Casual: You order food and drinks from the counter, a buzzer lets you know your food is ready, and food/ drinks are served on paper plates/ plastic cups.  Drinks: I had the fruity tequila drink topped with a handful of fresh blueberries (Blue Rita) - delicious and strong. The food. Wonderful. We had:- Kale salad with a mildly sweet curry dressing - super.- Maine lobster roll. Sooo good. Mayo based, generous amount of lobster and could be a little messy with delicious mayo drip, so keep the napkins handy and quick  - Special fish entree (snapper)- wow, this was mouth watering incredible, topped with tomatoes and a light sauce.- Open faced mahi taco with avocado, pineapple chutney and creamy cilantro. Spicy but also very good. Only minor negative:  While I do not mind casual, and the views and lively vibe are absolutely worth it, table service would be great, and possibly a small bar closer to all the tables/ dining area as opposed to the counter so people do not need to leave their company repeatedly and wait in lines to order and pick up food and drinks. Absolutely recommend for a perfect summer lunch, dinner or drinks with a date, friends, families.",5,2,5

Really nothing beats coming here on a summer night, getting a corona bucket or a pitcher of sangria, and watching the sunset. Their menu is typical bar food (burgers (veggie burgers too!), fries, chicken nuggets, sandwiches), and their drinks come in individual glasses, buckets, or pitchers. You order your food and drinks at the front counter, and then take your buzzer back with you to your seat and wait for your food to be ready for pickup.

I got a burger ($12) - the patty itself was cooked a lot more than I had asked for, and was too bland and totally lacking in flavor. Old Bay fries were pretty good, however, so no complaints there! I also split a calamari app (~$14) - plentiful for 2 people, not bad at all, but not the best I've had.I wouldn't mind coming back here, but I'll definitely skip the food and opt in for happy hour instead!",3,2,1

Moving tables and chairs so people could sit down...4 stars are for 2 reasons 1) it's not a huge deal but the tables are too high for the chairs so it's awkward eating you have to sit at the front of ur chair but it's fine2) for $10 glass of rosé they could give you a bit more than that small plastic cup.

Ordered a burger with a side of old bay fries, along with a beer. It was a great combination to have on a warm spring day. Old bay fries may be a little salty for some people, but I personally enjoyed the extra flavoring. The burger was nothing fancy, but was pretty decent.

Updated review",the new bkfst menu was disappointing.  the burrito seemed to have been made from a mix and tasted like wet dog food.  the french toast came as sticks and was like bad airport food.  coffee was ok and of course the view is nice but they need to get on AM point.,,,
54,J S.,"New York, NY",27,15,0,1.0,5/15/2018,"It's early in the ""season"" May 15, 2018, but so far, this is the absolute worst place in NYC. The setting is lovely, which should have been warning enough. The design of the space is excellent, another warning. The people working there pleasant. The grilled chicken sandwich I attempted to eat was the worst chicken sandwich, for that moment, on the planet. Not ""cooked to order"", unless cooking means drying out the chicken, drying out the ""brioche bun"" and then putting it on a paper plate and surrounding it with surprisingly edible greens drenched in a sugar based dressing - the only thing worth eating. The chicken was impossible to cut with the plastic knife available. The bun disintegrated when picked up. The chicken is too thick to pre-cook it more than 30 minutes before serving it. There is no excuse for the bun, unless it's a subtle hint to feed the seagulls. Probably best to stick with bottled beer, packaged chips and maybe a hot dog if you bring your own bun.",,,

You can get cheap food, like a $3 hot dog, or you can spend $22 on a lobster roll.  Your call. Easy system where you order at the counter and take a buzzer.  Come back up when your food is ready, which gives you time to stake out a table.  If you're buying wine, you might as well get a bottle, because a ""glass"" of wine is actually just a tiny plastic cup.So nice to sit and relax on the pier, in NYC and looking at Jersey over the Hudson, with something to eat and drink.",3,2,3

The salad has too much dressing (dripping in oil), and the burgers are all well done regardless of how you order them.  The burger patties appear to be frozen pre-made patties, and taste that way too.  The crab cake was decent, but they are skimpy on the amount of crab (doesn't measure up to a good Maryland crab cake).  Come here for the atmosphere and view, go elsewhere for a great meal.",1,,

Updated review","I last reviewed this spot in 2008 and things have changed a lot.  It's still a lovely spot.  It's still got my five stars.  But it's not the same.  Pier I Cafe is an open air eatery in Riverside Park South, under the West Side Highway and beside the Hudson. Its seventy-or-so tables are shaded by lime-green umbrellas swaying in the breeze, and depending on time and day, it is either a place to chill in silence, or a bustling outdoor cafeteria.  Its food is simple but not bad--a solid burger, excellent fries, a few salads of the kale-and-quinoa variety, chicken nuggets for picky toddlers--if you're familiar with the Boat Basin on 79th, or the Frying Pan by Chelsea, it's a similar menu.  For drinks, there's a small list of simple cocktails, sangria pitchers, and some absurdly sweet lemonade, but the beer's your best bet--they recently switched to a local, all-New York State beer list for their drafts--Coney Island ale, Bronx IPA, Kelso lager, Ommegang witte, for example--good stuff.  You can opt for a bucket of Coronas too, which kind of never loses its novelty.  Back in 2008 this place was less developed, and more charming for it.  It had only port-a-potties, and felt more like a shack, its permanence seemingly in doubt, like it might not be there the following summer, or like a strong river gale might blow it away.  It was less known and felt like a secret.  You could come here on a weekend and not be crowded, on a weekday evening and feel the stillness of the water and hear only murmurs from the folks at neighboring tables.  And they served actual pints, if memory serves me right, and the veggie burger was some kinda perfection.Now it's more developed.  It gets packed in the evenings, and it's overfull with families and strollers on weekends.  None of this is a bad thing, it's a sign of success, but it makes the place less relaxing.  I hesitate coming here on weekday evenings and on weekends, for fear of not finding a seat and of being surrounded by more people and energy than I'd like.  And I can't convince Brooklyn friends to hike up to my neighborhood for the Pier any longer, for those same reasons.  I've discovered a different, perfect time to come here, though: weekday mornings.  For various reasons, I've had the pleasure of spending many weekday mornings here for two summers.  Before it opens for lunchtime, Pier I Cafe is a tea and coffee stand, with muffins and scones from Corner Bakery.  Nothing wildly special here, but the setting makes up for it.  At 10am or even 1pm, the place is near empty--you might share it with ten people and a few dogs, and those people are as likely to be quietly reading a paper or painting as anything else.  The overhead highway's white noise isolates you, the river smells of the sea, the ants on the retaining wall are ceaseless.  You can come here to read, to zone out, to work.  I've written some published fiction here.  I'm writing this Yelp review here.  I've read most of several books here and tons of news.  There's no Wifi, but I suspect this is a benefit--it keeps the place emptier.  On weekday mornings and occasionally even afternoons, Pier I Cafe doesn't feel like a part of the city.  It feels like it used to, a sleepy open secret at the edge of things, where the city ends.",10,3,6

62,Julia L.,"Queens, NY",1318,174,325,4.0,8/8/2014,"My suggestion is wear pants at night before you go here, especially in the summer months. The mosquitoes are vicious and really thirst for your blood. ANYWAYS, I was brought to this place by my significant other and I was glad he stumbled upon this place on Yelp (especially after doing extensive research in fear of my wrath). The mahi taco (which honestly was just a big burrito) and the Pier I burger were delicious. The prices aren't exactly a great deal, but the view is spectacular. I love that it's low key, unpretentious and cafeteria style (reminiscent of middle school days with a better setting). Plus they have alcohol there.

65,Mirza M B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,2.0,8/20/2017,"I went to this place and order the humus and a burger.  I have to say the humus was terrible - I would just call it ""mashed chickpeas"" which is what it is.  Has no flavor - nothing to do with humus. They either never had humus, don't know how to make it or don't care.  On top of that  they add orange marmalade which doesn't add anything to it. - Very odd combination!!! The chips are fried - a plain pita would be better. The burger was ok - This is a nice place to sit but the staff really should go around and ask people who are sleeping on the tables to move - it is a restaurant and not someone private living room.  people sit there with no drinks or food for hours.",,,
66,Tom B.,"Round Rock, TX",75,247,11,4.0,9/2/2015,"I'm giving this place 4 stars more for how it used to be than how it is today.

I still love coming here but now its always busy and full of strollers/families from the UWS.They have a great selection of beers and cocktails and a pretty good, if over priced (especially the lobster roll) menu. I recommend the burger as its the best value, delicious and comes with amazing seasoned fries too.I like the fact that this place is seasonal and only open in the summer to leave you wanting more. If you're on the Westside looking for a great place to hangout and kick back with a bucket of Corona, but don't want to deal with the obnoxious bro's and ho's who now frequent the Frying Pan, then check this place out.",1,,2

Then you grab a table and hang out till sunset, which you will have an awesome view of.The 45-65 dollar pitchers have generous pours in them and should be enough for about 6 people.  Finding a table could be challenging, so figure out what you want in advance and send some of your friends on a scavenger hunt while you are waiting for the food.This place was extremely clean and the crowd had a good vibe.

We had breakfast here once -chocolate croissant- their pastries are from Balthazar, and it was excellent.Great fries. Today we had a lobster roll that was above average in the amount and comes with fries and salad. They have a nice selection of beer, our favorite is the Captain Lawrence on tap. Also, if you prefer drinks, they have an excellent cocktail menu, which is available in pitchers  and blueberry lemonade for non drinkers, but still thirsty.",,,

96,Sil A.,"Bronx, NY",1,72,8,5.0,6/28/2016,"The view makes this place 5 stars. So my bf and I decided to stop by this place on a Saturday around 6 pm. Its first come first serve & in order to grab a table quick you have to be ACTIVE! after like 20 mins we found a table because I came up to the person to ask them if they were leaving. Once you have your table you are all good to send someone to order. Beers are pricey, we paid $28 for a double IPA pitcher and about 9 bucks for fries and chicken tenders which wasn't bad and they were freshly fried. *More tables become more available after 8 pm!!That ambiance is worth everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",,,

There are lots of tables which is great for groups, but don't be fooled, on a beautiful summer's day you might have to fight some people to get a place to sit. Totally worth it though - great view, great pier, great neighborhood. The food is pretty good actually, especially the fries and corn on the cob. Do not get the onion dip, that shit was nasty. The sangria is delicious and while 38 bucks feels like the a lot, the pitcher is HUGE. Much bigger than the average restaurant pitcher. Dogs are welcome! I fed a fry to a random corgi when I was here, it was great.",3,3,1

Luckily, there are plenty of corners and seats to tuck away, making it easy to relax under the warmth of the sun and the sangria.Noshing on lobster rolls and Old Bay fries, the crowd, which runs the gamut from 30-something couples, sometimes with young kids, to cheerful retirees, seems pleasantly at ease in the clean and vibrant space. The better than average bar food just adds to the splendidness of the spectacular views of the Hudson, and gives anyone the excuse to come back every weekend.",1,1,1

Blueberry lemonade was wonderful as always. But the veggie burgers were seriously undercooked and totally tasteless. We believe that frozen patties may have been microwaved, when they should have been browned on the grill like a hamburger. And my friend said the apples in her Waldorf salad were mealy.

The location is spot on - beautiful view and a very cool chill out atmosphere. I like that you order and get your own seat here - there were plenty of spaces so we had no problem getting a table on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. Plenty of umbrellas for shading.I only had the sparkling rose (which is why I didn't give it higher) which was pretty good. I appreciate  that the cashier let me taste the still and sparkling before paying. He was extremely friendly even though the place was packed. I didn't have food but my friends had a salad and sandwich and the potions looked big - prices weren't bad either considering the location.The only negative was that we saw a giant RAT walking among the tables. GROSS! BUT we were on a pier on the Hudson River outside, not necessarily the fault of the cafe since we weren't near the kitchen. It's just NYC on the river for ya.",,1,
109,Nicolas B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,3.0,7/21/2017,"Great location and beautiful scenery by the water. But that's all. The food is extremely disappointing, highly priced and there is no service, as this is really a take out place. You order your food, you pick it up at the counter and you find a table to sit down. Paper plates and plastic cuttlefish complete the set. I had the bracketed salmon and my wife had the swordfish tacos. The salmon was tasteless, you could not really taste the blackened fish.The tacos had raisins...which we found rather strange. Extremely disappointing. We also had the humus, I never had humus before covered under a kind of jam. Accompanied by oily chips. I hated it, my wife liked it. Overall, what a pity. To have such a unique spot and really downgrade it with terrible food and no service. I hope sometime another operator can put there a better restaurant. Will I go again? Yes, probably, because of the location.",,,
110,Anna T.,"New York, NY",227,155,177,5.0,6/1/2016,I give pier I cafe 5 stars for location and ambiance. I'm a huge fan of summers in New York. I especially like either brunching on the roof tops or views by the water. This location is truly breath taking. This place is what summers in New York is all about. You walk down this boardwalk to a spacious outdoor venue with plenty of seatings by the water. The food menu is not extensive and it's no 5 star menu. It's pretty basic with the burgers and fries Etc.. The old bay French fries were pretty good though. Drinks are basic as well. You don't have a server as you have to order food and drinks at the vendor however there are busboys to clean your section. The bathroom is a portable trailer along the side. It's really tight but super clean. I definitely will be coming here all summer.,2,,1

I wasn't a fan- didn't feel as if there was much vodka in it. It was too sweet to drink an entire pitcher worth.

But that's the beauty, that's New York, gems hidden in unlikely corners. The American menu offers your typically choices at fair prices and is tasty enough. But it's open abeyance and availability to the public is what gives this place it's 5 stars. We went on day where live music was playing during a warm summer afternoon.

All three were terrific.As for the drinks, we're sticklers for good cocktails so we were a little skeptical of the blueberry margaritas, but boy were we pleasantly surprised!! There are some other specialty cocktails we'd like to try but we got a little hung up on the blueberry margaritas and didn't want to pull away from a good thing. We'll have to try the others next time.Overall, I was kind of surprised that a cafe in a somewhat secluded spot underneath the Westside Highway could have good food and drinks, but they do. And of course the ambiance is amazing. After our meal we sauntered out onto the pier and watched boats motoring on the Hudson in front of the setting sun. It was actually kind of magical.",3,,2

Mahi Taco w/ avocado, pineapple chutney, cabbage, flour tortilla & creamy cilantro - this was tastyyyyyyyyyyyyy, but it was more like a burrito than a taco, as it came in one big burrito shell.

However, I threw most of it out because it was tough and chewy, and the seasoning/flavor was pretty bad too. Just bland, tough, chewy lobster. The fries were very good and the blueberry lemonade was fantastic. Next time I'll try a burger as I see those get good reviews.As far as service there isn't any. You place your order and bring a little buzzing pager thingy to your table. So it's essentially a serve yourself establishment which I was fine with.

But our group ended up ordering a pizza and sitting at one of their tables and eating - they definitely saw us, and had no problem with it, so that was pretty cool (but hopefully the menu will be expanded soon!)Beers were pricey.  A bucket of 6 Coronas was 40 bucks, so that was a bummer.All in all, finding Pier i Cafe made for a great afternoon - it's pricey and has a few kinks to work out, but it's the perfect outdoor spot.",1,1,

Plus, I love that this place is dog friendly. They serve a great seasonal beer and I also go for the white sangria. You can get either by the glass or by the pitcher.My only suggestion for Pier i is to establish a happy hour or some type of summer day/night deals. Beers are $6/$7 with pitchers at $26/$27 and sangria pitchers go for almost $40. The food at Pier i is not just some snack shack food, its really quite tasty! Starters - I love to munch on the Old Bay fries with drinks; I've also tried the bean dip which is like hummus and a nice healthy alternative to fries.Plates - I really liked the quinoa salad, the veggies burger, my boyfriend said the regular burgers are good too, and the lobster roll. Dessert - Ben and Jerry's ice cream bars!!!!!They even has decent bathrooms in the back, as long as you can navigate through the cyclists and runners on the path. Watch out they're pretentious (sometimes I am of them, sorry). I miss it already! Closed for the fall/winter.",4,,1

Order it with cheese, please, and don't look at me funny when I devour every last french fry.Play with the dogs eyeing you hungrily at the nearby tables, try not to crash into too many chairs while wending your way back to your seat, and try to snag a spot as close to the pier as possible.

The burgers are soooooo juicy and delicious, although you definitely pay a pretty penny for them. The garlic fries are ridiculously addicting. I found myself finishing mine, then picking more off of my friend's plate. Maybe, I'm just a glutton for fries. There's plenty of tables, but it quickly fills up.

Each time, Pier i Cafe has delivered.Since I've only been here on rides, my experience has tended to focus on things like the fact that they have a bathroom, many places to lock up a bike, and a place to guzzle water. But the only items I've had, the grilled chicken wrap and grilled salmon, were both delicious and easy to put down mid-workout. Of course, I always see bunches of their huge burgers and fries pass me by, and I fantasize about coming back under less strenuous circumstances. But I'm happy to just leave this as a bike stop.

Mostly plastic (plates, cups, utensils, bottles, straws) mindlessly dispensed and not of the compostable variety. You can ask for paper cups and some food items are served in paper containers.Haven't tried the food this year but last year...it was pretty good.

Take a beer garden. Now rip the roof and walls away and replace it with a park, a pier, and a river and you've got Pier i Cafe. I can't really complain. The staff was friendly and accommodating, even though we came rather late in the evening. The food didn't take long, and when it arrived it was pretty tasty, to say the least. I had the burger with blue cheese and bacon, and an order of fries that was very well seasoned. I can imagine that, like most beer garden-type places, this place would be swarming with people, so I think that my ease of finding a table for 8 is probably not an experience on which you should base your visit.

The proximity to the west side path and views of the Hudson are wonderful on a nice day.HOWEVER, don't come here with any expectation of good food. It's simply not going to happen. I've tried many different items from the menu over a few years, including the specials. Maybe once I have had something yummy. I don't quite get it- they use decent ingredients and the thought is there, not to mention they charge quite enough. I just had the white bean tuna salad ($16)- absolutely bland.  I'm pretty sure they dumped a can of beans and tuna in bowl and piled it on plain, dry lettuce. I cook a lot and that's my honest appraisal. I had to ask for lemon just to make it palatable. I just think they're missing talent when it comes to the kitchen. Don't bother getting anything other than a drink. Maybe a fried food item (but I had calamari there once that wasn't good either- breading not crisp, bland, and rubbery) Too bad. Maybe someday they'll get a chef. Who knows. I'll still go there, but I'll never be tempted to get food there again. I've been burned too many times.",,,

The Pat LeFrieda burgers are quite good but are one of the only fairly priced things on the menu. The rest of the food and (especially) the drinks are painfully overpriced. And this place gets packed with douchey and annoying nouveau-Upper West Siders quite quickly on nice summer evenings.But there are a couple fail-proof solutions to the few problems that plague this paradise: Arrive early (5pm-ish) and stake out a table. Order a burger. And accept the fact that any alcohol you purchase includes the price of relaxing on the Hudson and watching the sunset in one of the greatest cities on earth.

My hubby had the skirt steak - at $20 he was asking for disappointment. The highlight was the side salad which had this bomb dressing. yum! The steak portion was quite small. The best part for both of our meals was the seasoned fries. SOOO GOOD! Not the worst food, but a little pricey. So why am I still giving 3.5 stars?

All-in-all, it really wasn't bad.  Room for improvement, but not too bad.",,,

193,Lauren J.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,66,2,4.0,8/14/2012,"Had such a good experience here the other day. There was a group of us and we should have called ahead of time and didnt. But the owner, Eric, personally helped us out getting enough empty tables and chairs together. So nice. The food is better than 79th St Boat Basin. Get the blue cheese burger and fries. Drink service includes liquor and there's white wine sangria, a crowd favorite. The food is counter service but you get a beeper for when its ready and it came pretty fast considering the amount of people there. We all had a great time. Highly recommended.Of note: this is located along side the west side greenway and in this section the bikes-only path is in between the restaurant and the bathrooms. For your safety and the bicyclists PLEASE look both ways before your cross it, even if you have several blueberry-lemonade-vodkas in you. Thanks!",2,1,
194,samantha b.,"Manhattan, NY",55,25,8,2.0,7/19/2014,Can you please change the sangria recipe back to the original? It was much better. Also please stop making spaghetti you are bad at it.,1,5,
195,Alyvia M.,"New York, NY",483,770,48,4.0,5/2/2010,"I didn't eat there today, but cannot wait to go back for food/drinks. They really did an amazing job with the pier. It is stunning. I can tell that it will be MUCH better than the boat basin uptown! The walk out by the water is designed beautifully, not like your usual plank walk in a straight line.I'd say it's a great spot for a date, and on a nice night, would be great for drinks with friends. I saw the menu- it's awesome, and well priced!",3,3,3
196,Brittany S.,"New Haven, CT",64,31,19,4.0,6/4/2014,This place is an amazing outdoor dining experience. The beer selection is impressive considering it being a cafe type dining. The food is great but the view and atmosphere is really what will make you fall in love.,2,1,1
197,Nick O.,"New York, NY",5,52,0,5.0,4/19/2015,A Hidden Gem! Perfect spot in the summer to get dinner and a/or a few drinks.  The staff is fun and their location is great.  Excellent people-watching opportunities as their tables are right next to the biking/jogging trail along the river.,,,
198,Mako G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/27/2016,"Do not eat there!  This piea I cafe damp all trash and garbage into Hudson River.  You see many trash, garbage flouting on ther river.  Many wild lives are threathed.",,,
199,SherryAnn D.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/11/2014,"Wanted to put a warning out there:I paid with a debit card and didn't leave a tip on the receipt. I forgot to put a score through it like I usually do, and an employee there FILLED IN A $1 TIP assuming I wouldn't notice the small amount. I did, because I had put exactly enough money in my account to cover the charge, and my account went overdrawn by $1.Do this to enough unsuspecting peoples' receipts over the course of a busy Sunday, and you end up with a pretty hefty tip.I'll be reporting it to the manager, but BE AWARE when you use a card there.Too bad, because it's a pretty sweet spot with good food, but I won't be going back if the staff is stealing.",1,2,
