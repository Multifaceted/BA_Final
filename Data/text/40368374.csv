I am not a huge boxing fan but, I can enjoy looking at a bunch of handsome legends. The people in the bar are always friendly. The bartenders are great here. I forgot to get the bartender with the dreads name but he was awesome. He makes a delicious drink. Let's not forget about the prices they are great it is happy hour all of the time and I love it here! They even have a music box which is swell because you hardly see those anymore. Beware they do not serve food here so you have to eat before you have a great night at this establishment. I will definitely be back to indulge soon.",1,,
1,Vojtech V.,"Orlando, FL",79,67,188,1.0,5/28/2018,"Dive in bar that I found through Yelp as a place that offers happy hour. Upon arriving to the murky environment, we were notified that we need to take our bags down (which I get due to the picture). The server asked us for orders, I asked him about the happy hour and him and some ""regular"" what seemed like, laughed at me and told me theyre always happy and that they don't offer any happy hour drinks. Ok, I am straight forward and get it. Asked for a menu to pick a beer or what I wanted to drink (it was me, my mom, and my brother). Server told us they dont have a menu (hint hint, it's 2018), and that he can tell us what they have, upon which she started reciting the list of beers in bottles and on tap. I just asked for IPA, by brother did the same and when we told him our mom didn't want anything to drink, their ""one drink minimum"" rule was brought to our attention and we had to order he a juice. Besides the fact that the way the bar tender spoke to new customers was nothing short of disrespectful, I would not recommend a business where you're made fun of, makes you buy drinks, and doesn't even have a menu. It could be as simple as printing out a page of paper or writing something up on a blackboard. A little addition - I never judged the restaurants based on their bathrooms but this places restroom was disgusting. I am no ""touchy feely"", but come on, dirty, bathroom doesn close, etc. Unless you want to go to a 1920's bar in 2018 and get treated without respect and with confusion - go ahead, give Jimmys corner a try. Next time I am going somewhere where the owners value customers cash for their products. Not recommended.",6,4,
2,Sasha V.,"Chicago, IL",30,64,91,5.0,11/9/2018,Cool NY bar in Times Square with a ton of character and an old school vibe. Enjoyed my Hennessy here visiting with locals and really feeling a part of the NY scene. Chill vibe and laid back atmosphere makes this a great spot to have a drink after and before strolling through Times Square at night.,,,
3,Nicole F.,"Tampa, FL",132,470,1691,5.0,6/28/2018,We were told by another bartender to come to this place because the locals like to come here. It's a very small joint...an old boxing club we were told. The bartenders were attentive and kept the drinks flowing. SUPER great prices on the drinks considering it's NYC. We were pleasantly surprised and it was nice not having to pay high end prices for the drinks. Play some music on the jukebox...$5 gets you 15 songs!!,2,,1
4,Mark D.,"Miami, FL",42,315,872,5.0,11/2/2018,"After greasing down on Mexican at Los Tacos No. 1, I needed to wash it all down with some beer. Once again, daughter's boyfriend has found us another great inexpensive place to drink...Jimmy's Corner.  On a early Thursday evening, we had to practically shoehorn ourselves in the door. Even though the place was packed like a sardine can, we were quickly served by perhaps the most-cool-under-pressure bartender I've ever seen. She was getting slammed with orders, but was still managing a smile. My 5 star rating is given because of the fact that 3 craft IPA's and a Patron on the rocks was only $19!! In the Theater District. Wuuuut?? I was so happy! Additionally, I liked the place because you couldn't help but be nice and co-mingle with the crowd. I don't even recall there being a TV or music....just convos. I also liked several signs posted ""please don't talk politics ""...sage advice in a crowded bar on the eve of November elections! I would definitely visit Jimmy's on future visits to Midtown Manhattan.",,,

6,Patrick S.,"Frederick, MD",10,53,1,3.0,11/14/2018,"Stopped in for a beer based on the unique atmosphere described in an online review. It's a  narrow, dingy, cheap watering hole with boxing memorabilia covering the walls. The patrons were mostly locals who were served their usual drinks before saying a word. The bartender was a somewhat disgruntled but friendly guy. There is nothing special about the drink selection, but there is something to be said about a bar that feels like it was plucked from a working-class neighborhood in Queens and dropped in the middle of Time Square.",,,
7,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",201,203,582,4.0,2/5/2018,"If you're looking for a dive bar with character, grit, and an interesting history, look no further then Jimmy's Corner.Situated In Times Square, this bar is definitely situated to become one of my favorites due solely to the lack of tourists that are literally never here! If you're confined to finding a spot in the Theater District, but don't want to be gutted and packed where you end up grabbing a drink, this is the spot for you.Apparently owned by a legendary boxing coach, the venue is adorned with photo's of famous boxers and other notable individuals posing with the owner, appropriate known as ""Jimmy"". I've only seen him once when visiting this bar, but by the looks of it he's an extremely personable guy who really knows his most loyal patrons. Maybe one day I can hope to be one of them too...Overall great service and accommodating staff. My friend and I were able to find seats in the back of the bar and almost immediately one of the servers came and took our drink orders. Even before we were done with one drink they would be back to ask us if we'd like another. Smart and consistent service like this is something to be coveted in the Times Square area. This just reinforces that fact that Jimmy's Corner is definitely a diamond in the rough.Go here for affordable drinks and good service if you're in Times Square! It's a dive bar FOR SURE. So know that you'll be with like minded people looking to have a great time while basking in the history of this awesome spot.",2,1,4

I was apprehensive about going, since it gets crazy during the work week, but I sat right at the bar on a Saturday night. Jimmy's is an old dive bar covered in boxing memorabilia with a decent selection for the prices. It's always happy hour at Jimmy's so it's a good way to get a buzz without breaking the bank. Eat before or after because they don't serve food. The bartenders were attentive and it gets crowded but there's always lots of movement so you can get your order in. I would definitely return when in the city.",,1,
10,Jessica K.,"Oakland, CA",15,76,108,5.0,7/23/2018,A little dive bar gem just a block away from time square. I think this was one of our favorite spots we tumbled upon. We were walking for hours in the heat and we weren't ready to go back to our hotel but we needed to grab a nice chilled drink and relax. The best part was the drinks were no more than $4 and the retro juke box was perfect. The juke box has some of the most popular oldies.

I don't think you will find that anywhere in the city especially near Times SquareCons: I honestly came in and it was a little too quiet for me.

14,Stuart G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",139,89,35,4.0,2/1/2018,Small bar a bit of a dive but it's easily the cheapest beer in midtown! It's also a lot of fun always busy although at times can be a bit cramped. Great atmosphere and some cool pictures on the walls.,1,,
15,Amanda V.,"New York, NY",149,35,176,5.0,1/7/2018,This place is just a couple blocks from the hell of Times Square yet it has managed to retain the 1970's kitsch that is now very rare. Very inexpensive drinks that could compete with small town prices are accompanied with retro framed boxing fan-boy photos. I don't recommend coming to this neighborhood but if you want yourself here and want a cheap drink....get it here.,1,1,
16,Anne C.,"Framingham, MA",1,20,11,4.0,12/1/2017,"Dive Bar and I loved it!  That's what this place is... no more, no less.  This place is a hole in the wall amongst all the craziness of Times Square that surrounds it.

Updated review","Cozy bar near Times Square with very reasonable prices. It's not the most modern bar, but the 2 Times i went it was super packed. The walls are filled with pictures and memorabilia that reflect Jimmys life. Which from the looks of it was very interesting. The second night there me and my friends had the pleasure to meet him. We really liked this bar a lot and that's why we returned a second time. If i ever go back to NY i will definitely return here loved the prices and loved the ambience. Just keep in mind it's not a very upscale bar it's more of a relaxed local bar.",3,1,1

20,Mark C.,"Fraser, MI",21,288,2049,5.0,11/8/2017,My favorite place for drinks in the city. Cheap drinks  great place to go shoot the breeze with your friends. The owner Jimmy a former boxing man is the nicest guy you will ever meet. In the past I always enjoyed sitting and talking boxing and other things with him. Today when I was there I didn't see him but the bartender we had was very friendly and a very nice guy. I came up to a a send off drink with a good friend who works in the city. We met here for drinks we had two shots and two beers each. It was the perfect place to go for my send off back home to the mitten. I recommend anyone hanging in Times Square stop in and have one before heading back to your hotel. It's an old piece of the city you may want to see.,2,,1
21,Katy A.,"Powerhouse Arts District, Jersey City, NJ",3,1,0,1.0,11/4/2018,This place was recommended to us as good value for money near Times Square. I would say the fact the drinks were cheap was about the only positive. The staff were rude the toilets were vile. It just proves that's cheap drink results in a cheap service. Won't be recommending.,,,
22,Michael H.,"Chicago, IL",473,643,393,5.0,9/22/2017,"Great bar that's literally 3 blocks from Times Square, it's like you walked into 1982.. if you can walk in the door!  Inside, it's tiny with a large bar on the east wall and some seating in the back....boxing memorabilia all over the joint!  $3 domestics at Happy Hour simply can't be beat and the clientele ranges from regulars to tourists as well as tinder dates gone BAD.  Always packed to the rafters but you can usually manage to snag a seat after standing against the wall for a bit.  Service is good/ you got one low key bartender and one totally high strung bartender who doesn't really like people; you'll figure it out! Must stop in Times Squirrel area or before a show/ talk later PS- Great Coasters!",5,3,5
23,David A.,"Buford, GA",145,200,255,3.0,2/17/2017,"Jimmy was a professional boxer and then trainer who decided to hang 'em up himself after fighting Floyd Patterson (I believe twice), former heavyweight champion. No shame there. Popping in here at 3 am after other bars have closed is always a solid choice when you are with your buddies and not trying to impress anybody. The memorabilia is cool and the stories legendary, but seriously do not talk smack. The staff here does not like douchebag tourists or douchebag locals for that matter. Get a beer sit down and relax, or leave. Also, there is not much room between the barstools and the wall, so if you are going to be annoyed by someone accidentally bumping you, please do not come here.Another reason not to bring the ladies to this establishment is that the bathroom is pretty nasty, so if you need to drop a deuce or have a pregnant wife, girlfriend, friend, or someone with you who acts pregnant, do not bring he or she to this place. And lastly but perhaps most important, the sign on the wall says ""no politics"" and trust me, I made that mistake once. Never again ...",4,3,3

27,Carly L.,"New York, NY",171,239,229,2.0,3/18/2018,"The good thing is that it's probably the cheapest you're going to get in Times Square. However, the drinks are tiny. The place is super cramped, smells like urine, and the tables are all sticky, so this is definitely not a spot for people who aren't looking for a dive bar. The boxing theme is unique.

I wasn't drinking as I was literally stopping by for min so I said I'm good. She tells me they have a one drink minimum and I couldn't stay if I didn't order something. So I got a f*cking beer and didn't drink it. I'm a NYC bartender as well so I get it.

The theme of the bar is BOXING and it's very Old School and rustic.. just so you know, if you're here You Must order a drink (anything!) - that's the policy.They live by their rules and you have a good natural experience ..but hey..it's manhattan...if you want a place to just let loose and enjoy with friends ..this is it!FYI- This place is open till 1 or 2 AM everyday (I think). I don't know why yelp shows it as closed.",4,1,2
53,Duncan W.,United Kingdom,8,3,0,4.0,4/30/2017,"Was here on my first night in NYC. Compared to the other bars in the area it's cheap as chips. The bar itself is long and thin with tables at far end. Boxing memorabilia is all over the walls. It's definitely dated and in need of a little TLC but don't let that put you off. The bar staff were friendly and quick to take the order given how busy they were. Being a little cramped where we were we headed towards the back of the premises and met I believe jimmy himself. He has his own unique style, but we just went with it. Despite the bar being busy we then got table service. That would not happen in Scotland. Go enjoy the experience soak it in.",2,,

Jimmy's was a perfect stop. The drinks were CHEAP and the atmosphere was eclectic and one-of-a-kind. It is most definitely a dive bar with a lot of character, good people, and nice service. If you are looking for a well lit, classy establishment to enjoy a cocktail, this is not for you. If you want a laid back, original experience with good and CHEAP drinks, this is a great place to visit. It is only about a block from Times Square and the fact that their drinks are so CHEAP still blows my mind. For those that may be interested, the owner was a boxer and trainer, so the name Jimmy's Corner references the boxing ring. The bar is full of pictures, newspaper clippings, and memorabilia.",1,,

This is the ultimate dive bar and it's a hidden jem in Times Square.  You would never be able to tell but the blue entrance hides a bar that's been around for decades.  Themed in boxing photos and memorabilia of the past. First thing you'll notice is the bar and how small the entrance is. If you can sit the bar or side front great. If not make your way straight to the back and try and get a table. The bartender hits the tables in the back pretty regularly.  Another thing you may notice is Jimmy.  The owner enjoys his and being around it. He may even help you get settled at a table. The most surprising thing you may notice are the prices. Draft beer and full liquor.  Was just there with some coworkers.  2 drafts and a Whiskey/coke, $12.50!!!! Where else can you get that in New York City let alone Time Square!!!Now this isn't the Ritz. It may seem a little dab but what dive bar isn't.  This is the ultimate dive bar.

Normally, I avoid Times Square due to the crowds, but I checked out this place for St. Patty's Day and I had fun!It's a tiny and narrow bar and my Magner's was $4.50, which is super cheap for the Theatre District. It would be a great place to go before or after a Broadway show. When I went, it was pretty packed and it took us a while to find a table for the four of us. But eventually we did find one and we spent an hour there relaxing and had a great time.The decoration is old school and is plastered all over the walls.

In the early 80's I was a sailor over in the shipyard in Brooklyn. I came to Jimmy's maybe 4 times total (quiet weekday nights, nothing of note) with shipmates who were there more often, I think one of them was dating a bartender. These guys weren't close friends of mine, and I lost touch with them after our ship left NY. 7 years later, I'm back in NYC, beautiful sunny summer Tuesday, walk in maybe 1pm. I'm the only customer, the female bartender serves me a beer, maybe 10 minutes in, she says ""so how is your buddy doing""? I'm like ""excuse me""? But after some back & forth it's clear she recognizes me. It's 7 years just off Times Square, crossroads of the world, she saw me maybe twice, I don't even remember the guy's name and she picks out my average mug from memory. I told her she missed her calling as a detective.I grab a beer every time I'm in town.",3,4,7

I am all for a Dive bar as long as the Greeting is proper and the beer is cold . Now in regards to the Greeting initially the bartender was dull x dull =dullest , He acknowledged 0% of my small talk , poured me a beer , and stared at me until I gave him my credit card to start a tab. However after that the environment lent itself to good vibes, I chit chatted with a couple out of towners , loosened up, and my male companion came to meet me  the bartender also loosened up so ""All was well"".The beer was cold and in total we had 3 Samuel Adams Pints and 1 shot each ( Hennessy and Jose Cuervo ) So thats 5 drinks and the bill was $21 !!!! Whoop Whoop ! Now where in NYC can you find that kind of deal ???? ( And not at happy hour)Now granted it is not a pretty place but I have payed more in places that don't offer as much charm. And when I say charm I mean Boxing memorabilia on the wall and dollar bills that have been signed strung up behind the bar . You say messy I say charm lol. Overall I will be back with friend's maybe not too many if the plan is to belly up at the bar because it's pretty tight. Ps.They do have a few tables in rear for a group of four to hang out card table style. Pss.

As we were deciding to order I asked for a specific drink and they said they do no make any of those drinks. Which was fine so I ordered something else. As my party started to order, someone in our party wanted to wait to get a drink. At that given moment the bartender said she will not serve us until he orders. She basically made him ordered a drink. The drinks were very small but they were cheap. Didn't taste very good and the liquor was cheap.

The music was oldies and great for the vibe! One of the bartenders wasn't really friendly - didn't smile, wasn't great with suggestions, wasn't really making that many drinks.

You need a drink, and you need to get out of there. Here's your play; lose them at Bubba Gump, run over to Jimmy's Corner, and never look back.One of the few real old school NYC dive bars left, Jimmy's Corner is a great place to go with your friends for one too many drinks. The space is tight, the service is good, and the entire place is full of history--with photographs of bygone days adorning the walls as far as the eye can see. The drinks here are cheap. Really cheap. Like how can they afford to stay in business this close to Times Square cheap. And quite frankly by the second drink in, you don't really care.

Between us we ordered fried chicken, steak tips, the portobello mushroom sandwich, Mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. The portobello sandwich and Mac and cheese was mine. I'm not a vegetarian, I just love mushrooms and it sounded interesting so I had to try it. The mushroom sandwich was phenomenal. Their chipotle BBQ sauce with melted mozzarella really made it so savory. The added onion rings really made the taste pop. The Mac and cheese was a bit bland for my taste, but decent nonetheless. I tried my bfs mashed potatoes and steak tips which were also really good. Everyone else said their meals were great. Overall the food was good and I would return. At the end of our meal, the waitress apologized for having us wait so long for our meal and took a decent amount off of our bill due to it. Honestly, we were on a double date and having such good company we didn't even notice nor were expecting anything out of it. Also, we were literally the last dining table and we weren't rushed out or reminded of that either; so we definitely tipped well. The customer service was excellent.

Lots of history in this place, you can tell. Boxing memorabilia all over the walls, guessing Jimmy used too have something to do with the sport obviously. Not to mention my blue moons pints were only $3... Not bad for a beer literally a block from times square.

They have a bar in the front and a couple of tables in the back. So if there's more than four in your group I don't think this would be the place for you if you want to sit together. Also it's right in the middle of midtown so it's perfect for us because we come from New Jersey.

There were just New Yorker - so it's very american! When I was there it was packed, but I love this in that kind of bar. :)The drinks were incredibly cheap - I don't know how that works at all... Paid 3,50 $ for Gin Tonic - I'm mean it's not a big glas, but at all it's gin!!!^^ and the price was totally fine for that. Inside of the bar, there where a bunch of boxing pictures. It's super quaint and I think of going there again today! :D So my result: If you are looking for a typical american bar, cheap and in the heart of New York! You HAVE TO go to Jimmy's Corner!

One night I missed the last train to CT and was so sick. I went with my friend and Jimmy was there. He said there was a 2 drink minimum because of the time (never been there that late and haven't heard that before). He looked at me and could tell I was sick and he said to me don't worry about that.

Jimmy's Corner is a dark lounge where you go to drink, avoid trendy crowds and drink some more. This review is based on price, ambience and drink quality. There's absolutely no food here, so don't come hungry. The drinks are not fancy and I didn't see a cocktail or specialty drink menu, but they have all you need to make a good stiff drink. I had four cocktails and each was $4.50. Seriously, where are you going to find a good drink for that price anywhere, let alone NYC. It is super packed with limited tables in the back and the bar is not terribly long and the space between your stool and the wall behind you is about 1 foot, so be prepared to be jostled every once in a while.  No space for a live band, but there is an awesome jukebox with amazing sound quality. The bartender wasn't super friendly, but I don't think she needed to be. There are lots of friendly peeps in the place and the owner came out to mingle, too.",,,

I was insanely excited when this place popped up on Yelp just around the corner from where we were, and we were looking for dive bars. The description was right up our alley and it certainly didn't disappoint! Total dive bar you wouldn't even THINK to go into, but it seriously looked like it had made the trek up from Philly with us. The place was decked out in boxing memorabilia so we were feeling right at home. The place itself is small - long and very narrow. Maybe about 30 people in the place when we were there and I guess that was the breaking point... service was awful. I don't totally blame the bartender though because he was the only guy working! He was handling both the bar and the back room. It took me a half hour from when my drink was empty to get a second drink - the bartender ignored us the entire time. The prices were well worth it though and I can't believe we found a place this cheap smack in the middle of Times Square. I guess the trade off must be between pricing and service? We would've gladly stayed longer but couldn't justify waiting so long to get drinks and since we had limited time, we moved on elsewhere. I would recommend stopping in here for a drink if you want a nice local place with decent prices!",3,,1

I said, it is just water, ""Even it is"". It was the first time in NY when someone had a problem with my own water. All right, we started to order and one of us decided to order a little later, to take a breath after work, but the bartender was unstoppable - ""everyone have to get drink!"". It was enough, we went outside and only heard ""Don't waste my time!"" in ours backs. So rude! Is a bartender's duties include to be an asshole at this place?!",,,

In the past 6 years since I've been away, A LOT has changed, several times over and then some. My favorite thing about stumbling on to Jimmy's Corner was how I'm pretty sure this place has remained the same since it opened.The walls here are like a museum of boxing. Moving the past few of decades, you can see photos and programs of the famous and not-so former stars of the boxing scene. And somewhere among the memorabilia, you'll find Jimmy himself hanging out and watching the patrons moving in and out of his bar during the evening. My boyfriend and I came here after watching NPH rock the house in ""Hedwig And The Angry Inch"" and needed some time to recuperate before heading back to our hotel in Brooklyn. I love that this was not only the closest bar to the theatre, but this was absolutely the bar I wanted to be hanging out in. The drinks were probably the cheapest I have ever had in NYC that wasn't at a happy hour in Williamsburg.I'm with my namesake, Lauren L. about almost not wanting to give Jimmy's Corner any high marks only so that this place doesn't become overrun with tourists from Times Square. But I want this place to be around for my next trip to NYC so please go and patronize Jimmy's Corner, and make sure to say ""Hello"" to Jimmy who I have no doubt will be happy to see you there. (And I'll give you warning before I come back to the city, so you can pretend you don't go there and I can feel okay about my high rating.)",3,1,4

This is the cheap, narrow dive bar with 4 basic beers on draft and scribbled-on dollar bills taped to the walls. ""Pay as you go"" so each drink is a separate transaction unless you give your card. Must buy a drink to get a glass of water. Enjoyed the music selections by jimmy himself on the jukebox, but neither the jukebox nor the people were too loud to have a conversation. I think that's the biggest selling point. There's something that becomes likeable about the very basic atmosphere.",1,,1

It's a small bar without food or any extra stuff to do but that's part of it's charm. I love being served a beer that's under $5 by a sweet old lady who could probably kick my ass if it came down to it.

There is tons of boxing stuff hung on the walls and lots of pictures to look at while you have a drink. There are also lots of dollar bills on display behind the bar (not yet sure why...). It's a dive bar, in every sense of the words, but it's awesome. I will say that it is SMALL, well... cozy, and if you are not lucky enough to grab a seat then standing could present an issue. Almost forgot to mention the juke box - great music selection, something for everybody.Bathroom: I didn't use it, but my coworker siad it is pretty dank and grim, and VERY cozy...Staff: Our waitress is super friendly and fast with our drinks.Food/Drinks: We just had beers (not sure of their full selection but they have some key ones on tap) but they are a full service bar and, I'm sure, could make you anything you'd prefer.

Yup, Jimmy hangs here too and still has the stamina to kick it with us crazy kids while watching boxing on TV. I mean, why wouldn't he? His pictures line the walls and he's spent his life rolling with some really famous people. The most notable picture hanging at this tiny Times Square haunt would have to be the one with Jimmy and Muhammad Ali hanging above the bar - impressive.Drinks are cheap here, kiddos. I took full advantage of the $3.50 vodka/sodas, which were small but you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal anywhere nearby.

We then sat down and had a few friends come to join us, who were also told that they were not allowed past the bar without a drink. Everyone had to give their ID over and our Australian friend was given such a rude look when he gave his over.

The minimum to start a tab is $10 which is even better. It's a hole in the wall with a nice seating space towards the back. The female bartender wouldn't let my boyfriend grab a chair to add to the bar for a seat because there was no space. (Very limited indeed but he's a regular so I was a little sympathetic.)

155,Steve S.,"Fishers, IN",6,17,13,4.0,9/2/2014,"Has all the quintessential dive bar offerings:  character, inexpensive drinks, locals, great music and no frills. This place was a giant contrast to the surrounding Times Square atmosphere and I loved it!We were here late afternoon/ early evening which seemed to be a great time to go. The place is tiny so our group of 4 barely managed to get a table that seated us all. To me, that's part of the charm but if you're with a group, this might not be a great place if you're looking to sit down. Highly recommend giving Jimmy's Corner Bar a try!",1,,

Updated review","Owner was present and on a Friday nite. What a guy! Super friendly and engaging. True gentleman! You would think, based on the location of the bar, beers and drinks would be expen$ive.....not the case at Jimmy'sGreat vibe. Great bar. Great staff. Dollar on the wall!",,,
159,Brenna B.,"New York, NY",128,133,39,4.0,10/29/2015,This place is definitely the cheapest place to get a drink in all of time square. It is a super tiny space though so it's not somewhere you could stay and hang out all night. My boyfriend and I stopped here before going to a Broadway play and had a couple $3 drinks. It did the job I just wish it was a lot bigger. Cheers!,,,
160,Camilo H.,"Williamsburg, NY",81,2,0,5.0,3/3/2016,Great dive bar in the area. Prices are good and jimmy's selection of music in the jukebox sets a great atmosphere!,,,

162,Diondra H.,"West Babylon, NY",9,96,66,5.0,5/27/2016,Definitely my go to bar in the city now. I visited this place  two days ago during a trip to the city. Kareem and serene are great bartenders and the place is nice and laid back. Mainly ppl coming in after work to grab a drink and chat. Did I mention the Jameson and ginger for 5$ can't beat that!!,2,,2
163,S E.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,35,74,4.0,1/25/2016,"Jimmy's Corner is a nice Old School NYC bar tucked away on 44th just a few minutes from the chaos that is time square. It is full of character and history. The drinks are amazing! If you're looking for cheap but quality drinks this is the place! One long island ice tea is enough to get you on a roll! If you have to come to NY, please take is this gem!",,,
164,Joanne C.,"San Jose, CA",343,355,657,5.0,4/26/2015,"I will come back here again and again whenever I'm in the area! The bar is very narrow and cannot accommodate very many people. It's intimate and I like that. The walls are filled with people who have visited Jimmy throughout the bar's lifetime. Like I said, it has a very homey feel.Our group ordered about 14(?) drinks, and the total was only $46 before tip! Yes, the drinks are probably half the size they actually should be, but even then, I still think it was relatively inexpensive for Times Square.Jimmy and maybe his son(?) were the nicest people I've ever met on the face of this earth... the other woman that they hired on the other hand.... not so friendly. Jimmy even took a picture with my group and I!",3,2,3
165,M B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",24,14,1,5.0,12/1/2015,Ever since I came to New York this has been my favorite bar! All the bartenders are friendly and remember your face if you are a regular. The vibe is very warm and you feel good getting a drink here.I recommend it 100%!!!,,,
166,Travis W.,"Orange, CA",231,576,376,4.0,12/2/2013,"My friends and I were trying to get away from Times Square and super expensive drink prices and found Jimmy's. Man I am glad we did, this place had a great vibe running through it. Great gritty & grime feel to it and not in a bad way. Place had history and you could tell. Growing up my Grandfather was and still is a huge boxing fan. I wish he was with me to check this place out as Jimmy is a famous boxer/trainer/cutman. My gramps would of talked his ear off had he been with us. Seriously if your looking to get off of the hustle of Times Square check this place out. Place is small and can get crowded but don't let that turn you off. If your a boxing fan then I think this is a must visit spot just to check out the place. Thanks Jimmy for not having a good bar with great people. CHEERS!!",2,,1
167,Kirby W.,"Oak Cliff, Dallas, TX",9,62,26,5.0,9/16/2015,"Well, we were staying in Manhattan and did a Yelp app search for the nearest ""dive bar"" at midnight on a Friday and Jimmy's did not disappoint. When you first walk in, you are reminded of that old Yogi Berra axiom, ""Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded,"" because the place was packed. We soon found out why: $4 pints on tap, and that's the brand names (not Busch Light). Didn't find beer that cheap the rest of the weekend in NYC. The walls are decorated with old boxing posters, hence the name (""go to a neutral corner"") and photos of famous fighters, including Ali, and Boom Boom Mancini. Noisy, crowded and fun. You can get your buzz on here cheap, plus it FEELS like a dive bar, not an Applebee's. When I get to New York again, I'm coming here. IMPORTANT: Do NOT take a photo of the bartender. She will get pissed.",,1,
168,JM H.,"Manhattan, NY",18,67,14,5.0,6/19/2015,"This is easily the cheapest bar anywhere near midtown. $3.50 for a well drink.While a dive, it is a good place to go and have a relaxed, cheap drink.

171,Dorothy G.,"Brentwood, CA",96,105,19,5.0,10/9/2016,"One of our favorite spots.  This place is always packed and full of fun people.  It always amazes me how even when packed, people pile in.  We always meet great people here.  Drinks are good price and the bartenders are very friendly.  Great spot.  Check it out!",,,
172,Aaron L.,"Manhattan, NY",20,94,51,5.0,10/15/2013,"What an amazing little bar.  The patina of old boxing pictures is a starch contrast to the flashing lights of Time Square and the theater district.  The biggest blast from the past in this places it the prices! I ordered a pint of Stella  and a Sam Adams, and it was only $8 for both if them! That's crazy cheap!This is a great place to duck in for a break of the glitz of the area.  It's definitely closer to a dive bar in the bar continuum in cause you are sensitive to that. Very cool place.",2,,1

177,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",342,242,298,4.0,11/2/2013,"This is a weird quaint bar. It's located off Times Square and is nothing like what you would expect. The bar itself is pretty narrow, and so if there aren't enough seats for you in there, they will have to ask you to leave. There are some tables in the back and a bar in the front. That's it. Things are pretty cheap in there. The bartender wouldn't really elaborate on prices, but I can tell that some beers (bud light and rolling rock) are $3 and some are $4 (I think Sam Adams). I'm pretty sure well drinks are $4 as well. Also they do not have happy hour, these are the regular prices! WHAT THE WHAT! crazy! The bartender is an old lady. She's like the sweetest old lady ever. I loved her. Definitely do not come here with more than four people. You won't fit.",1,1,1

182,Melissa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,76,8,5.0,3/3/2015,"The quintessential dive bar, Jimmy's Corner is always at the top of my list when I travel to NYC. If you're looking for an upscale city bar to drink cosmos in, you best look elsewhere. Jimmy's is dark, narrow, and offers limited seating. That said, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, the jukebox provides just the right amount of music to keep the bar lively, and the drinks are cheap. Locals mix with the (well-informed) tourists in this Times Square institution that's just a stone's throw from many of the Broadway theaters making it perfect for drinks before or after a show. I've been going here for a few years now and every time I'm shocked at the communal nature of the bar. More times than not, I've gotten to chat it up with other patrons, most of them locals, and more than once an exuberant guest has bought the bar a round - something you don't see often these days. Jimmy's is a nod to the past in more ways than one. In addition to the old school atmosphere they've cultivated, despite their location amidst the throngs of tourists, Jimmy's pays homage to it's namesake, Jimmy Glenn of professional boxing fame. The walls are papered with nostalgic pictures of his boxing glory days and Jimmy himself is often on hand, chatting up guests or feeding the jukebox with tunes. I was torn on reviewing Jimmy's because I don't want tourists to overrun this gem, but I think that most tourists will probably prefer something trendier. Jimmy's is about as trendy as a burlap sack, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",3,1,3

This is absolutely your place! A word of caution: you get exactly what you pay for. I'm not convinced the glasses my cocktails were served in were 100% clean. And, awkwardly, there's no music if nobody is playing a retro jam off the jukebox.. so expect an eerily quiet bar if it's not super crowded. Definitely a fun spot all in all.

It's pretty small, one long bar with a narrow path to get through the place with some tables in the back.

I was visiting NY with some girlfriends and we wanted to grab a couple of drinks before we saw Phantom of the Opera. Since it was our first time in NY, we pretty much just yelped a place and found this bar, which was such a pleasant surprise! With the $ on yelp and being classified as a dive bar, we didn't have high expectations for it, however upon entry, it was nice and cozy and definitely not rundown or dirty like I'd expect it to be for the price. We found a table in the back and the bartenders were friendly, nothing exceptional. I guess what really got me was the steal of the beers on tap and the environment! For 3 beers, I paid $13 without tip, and coming from LA where that's pretty much unheard of, you can bet that I'd visit this place again when I'm NY again (: it's definitely a charming place and I'm glad we stumbled upon it amongst the masses of plenty of other bars !",4,2,3

I said ok I will order but can I please get a water first. She said ""NO!"". The only reason I stayed is because all places around were closed and it was the only option.
