0,Jessica M.,"Atlanta, GA",142,114,126,4.0,6/14/2018,"This store is not your average convenience store.  They offer so much, and from what I have seen, it is quality items (which equals higher prices).  It is located on 37th Street between 5th and 6th avenue. I had a smoothie.  They have so many different options. The fruit and veggies are fresh.  I got a small for about $8. I had mangoes, pineapples, bananas, spinach and almond milk.  The next time I will add protein. I went another day and got food.  I got 2lbs of food, unknowingly.  I had macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, and fried rice.  Everything was good, but it is best to eat it while it is hot. The food is 10.99/lb. The amount of food I got did not seem to be worth $21. Next time I go I will get a smaller plate :) They are open until midnight, which is a plus. Of course all of food the options/buffets aren't open that late.",,,
1,Augustina S.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/2/2018,"The owner and his employees stand outside of this store and hit on women as they walk or run by,Today as I ran by the store they yelled, run female runThey are pigs",,,
2,Pattie L.,"Queens, NY",35,321,3873,5.0,5/10/2018,Decent variety of foods made to order or buffet style.  On the morning from ordering to getting your food the timing is efficient.  When you go to a place on 5th ave the wait is usually longer. Pricing is comparable to other NYC deli type places but so far this place hasn't tried to up charge me for random things like all the others. If you pass by on your commute it's a good place to stop in to get breakfast. Or somewhere to get lunch too.,,,2
3,Valerie R.,"Downtown, Buffalo, NY",0,1,0,4.0,11/9/2018,I had a chicken parmigiana hero.Enjoyed it so much I went back next day for breakfast,,,
4,Kimberly C.,"Clovis, CA",197,147,454,4.0,6/16/2017,"This Green Apple is located across the street from Springhill Suites by Marriott. My husband and I were looking for cheesecake, possibly ice cream for dessert. The Green Apple has both! If you are looking for a cool spot for healthy soup and salad made just for you this is your place. There are individually wrapped muffins, cookies, and pastries available. There are custards and rice pudding in the refrigerated section. Lots of choices for bottles water, tea, smoothies, and coffee.The three employees working were friendly and attentive. The place was clean, bright and inviting. 4/5 stars because there are not prices on many items. That makes me crazy. I don't want to have to keep asking, ""How much is this?...""",1,,
5,Emily H.,"New York, NY",262,81,295,3.0,5/24/2017,"Good place to go to for lunch if you don't know what you want to eat. They have an array of salads, veggie, and meat dishes. They have sushi, dumplings as well as southern fried chicken. You can get a little of everything. My order came to just over $12 and I got a decent amount of food.Only thing I would mention is that even though the food is under heat lamps, the food is rather cold. So just heat it up a bit in the microwave.",,,
6,Anthony H.,"Queens, NY",46,74,59,3.0,9/29/2017,You won't find a larger selection at any deli... anywhere. The food is high quality but gadddddam you pay for it. Double the price of any other deli in the city.,1,,
7,Chris K.,"Edison, NJ",0,2,36,5.0,4/17/2018,The Nicest buffet place I ever seen in Manhattan. The staff went over and beyond to make me very welcomed when I stepped in the front door.,,,
8,Thomas N.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",400,2,0,5.0,4/11/2018,I used Green Apple Catering for a Huge event last Month and the guest are still talking about how good the food was. Gail is a pleasure to work with always helpful for whatever I needed.Will definitely keep using them in the future,,,
9,Patrick R.,"Suffern, NY",139,151,2,3.0,6/27/2017,"Meh. There are much better places in the area than this where the quality and price is better. I ordered spicy pork, it was a little spicy, not overdone. Great overall flavor. But lacks anything unique. Others in my group ordered other made-to-order dishes and were very sub-par. Overall, the only reason this place gets 3 star is because it seems to be very clean inside.",,,
10,Timi S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/11/2018,"I had an amazing experience. We hired Green Apple for our party. The food was delicious, they have a huge selection of menus. The staff was so great, helpful and friendly. Tom was great to work with. I highly recommend Green Apple Catering.",1,,
11,Paul C.,"Manhattan, NY",322,748,206,4.0,1/12/2017,"Green Apple is a reboot of a previous deli--I believe it was Blackstone. It's a major, major improvement.The new space is brighter, more clearly laid out and has a much more helpful staff.Their fruit bar is filled with a ton of fresh berries--it almost reminds me of Essen. The guys working behind the counter for hot breakfast food were helpful and fast, and my omelet was very reasonably priced.There's a good amount of space to sit toward the back of the deli, and I think they open the upstairs during busy lunch time.",5,1,2
12,Fame M.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/12/2018,Fooood is amazingggg!! I go here at least 5 times a week!   Nice and clean and the workers are so friendly. One of my favorite places of all times the hardest thing is choosing what to eat because everything looks and smell so good!!,,,
13,Jane A.,"New Haven, CT",1,40,152,5.0,3/3/2017,"This morning, I had the chance to grab lunch at Green Apple.  The place has a great variety of foods and drinks to choose from.   The place has a very kind staff, delicious food and fresh drinks.  It's also very clean and plenty of space to eat and enjoy.  I highly recommend this place!    :)",,,
14,Cristina M.,"Santa Fe, NM",49,2,0,5.0,5/25/2017,Mmmmmmm stopped in and got a hot bowl of Ramen! Delicious and great service. A must for New York!!!!!!!,,,
15,Danny Y.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",2,16,20,5.0,2/24/2017,This place is so legit. Quality meets reasonable pricing. There's no way I can find a cheaper place AND have the quality of food they have here. Workers are friendly and the owner is mad chill. Found my everyday lunch spot. You won't be disappointed.,2,,
16,Alessandra M.,"New York, NY",107,14,19,2.0,4/17/2017,"I was really happy when Blacksmith re opened as ""Green Apple"" - it looks way better than Blacksmith used too. the food is great and it's very conveniently close when in need for quick food. my only complaint is that when they first opened they had eco friendly and compostable containers which i was really happy about. after a few days they moved to the plastic ones which unfortunately just adds up in landfills. it would be nice if they switched back to the sustainable containers. until then i will continue to use the paper soup cups",,,
17,Anthony J.,"Shrub Oak, NY",0,3,1,1.0,11/10/2017,I've been violently puking and shitting nonstop for 12 hours from this shithole. I will never go back here ever. I've never had food poisoning before and this was just god awful. Do not make the same mistake I did. Shut this place down.,,,
18,Zoni S.,"New York, NY",29,8,0,2.0,4/14/2017,"The variety is great for vegan/ vegetarians. I loved it up until yesterday. I usually go there on my lunch break but yesterday I had a very bad experience. I felt uncomfortable and no one was friendly to me at all. I felt like I wasn't supposed to be there which is odd because I always go there. Overall, good choices but nasty service. Yesterday was a first and last. They lost a good and loyal customer.",,,
19,John L.,"Broomfield, CO",0,3,0,5.0,8/23/2017,"They have everything!!! Fantastic selection, reasonable, very trendy options and  I'm on corporate expense account and I still go here!",,,
20,Matthew G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/27/2017,"This is the worst place I have ever been to in NYC. The staff is the most UNFRIENDLY staff on the planet. From the chefs to the cashiers, all rude. Multiple times I have gone in here and there credit card machines and ATM have been down. You would think they would have someone telling you this as you walk in to order. But no, they only have a small sign at the cash register. At that point it is too late, you have already ordered your food.  All three times his happened I did not have cash on my. My options were to walk to a bank to get cash or leave without the food. It would be fine if someone told me this BEFORE I ordered, but they try to scam you. I once asked for arugula on my omelet. It was sitting right in front of me and they said they only used that for sandwiches. I said I was willing to pay extra and they flat out wouldn't do it. Terrible customer service. Terrible food. Hot food is always cold. Nasty place, nasty people. Stay far away.",1,,
21,Steve C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,12/27/2016,Ridiculously over priced and not worth that much $$...example..$2.49 for a bottle of soda...absolutely sinful got sick 2x already from buffet- never again,,,
