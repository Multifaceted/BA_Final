2,Jay G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",49,125,423,3.0,3/31/2018,"Good venue for striving artists. Lights and sound are pretty official. Quite a different experience for the audience. Super nasty about the 4+ ppl at a table, 2 drink minimum, per show specifics. Like chill out, we got money AND a party of 5. Mixed drinks are horrendously watered down and small. Rude bartender service when we mentioned how weak they were. Can't expect much more from Bleeker st area establishments, unfortunately.",1,,1

Great night!",1,,2
4,Lindsey D.,"New York, NY",357,159,87,4.0,8/14/2018,Fun bar with awesome music system. We saw a band and paid a $10 cover but it was totally worth it! Wine was good - 2 drink minimum during shows. Servers were very friendly.,,,
5,Michael A.,"Brooklyn, NY",266,52,54,4.0,6/14/2018,"We saw Don Randi & Quest. The sound system they have implemented was fantastic. We knew the band so we were in the list and saved the $20 cover, which in my opinion is a bit excessive due to the 2 drink minimum per show. Yes per show meaning per band.... Besides that the place is hi and quaint and I will definitely go back to see another intimate show! P.S. didn't see food and didn't drink alcohol so I don't know what the prices were. So sorry about that!",,,
6,Cam E.,"New York, NY",601,196,1223,4.0,2/4/2017,It's a legendary music venue in the Village.  Appropriately divey-esque. Great musicians.  The normal drill: $10.00 fee at the door.  Two drinks minimum.  Close friendly seating. Enjoy the show! The staff is friendly and efficient. No qualms. Tonight:  Funk Shui brass band were fabulous!!,12,7,12
7,Ashley R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,1,0,1.0,7/13/2018,"This might be the worst customer experience I've ever experienced. I went to close my tab at the end of the night. When they handed me my card, I did not look at the name on the card as it was dark and looked like mine. I left the tip and went back to join my group. Shortly after I heard my name yelled out and was scolded by the bartenders for taking the wrong card. They had given me the incorrect card and caught their mistake when the other person went to pay. The staff was SO rude at something that was obviously their mistake, and scolded me for both accepting the incorrect card and not keeping the receipt. I am honestly appalled at the way they handled a situation that clearly had nothing to do with my actions - I have never been treated so rudely in my life.",1,2,
8,Sasha B.,"New York, NY",109,46,46,2.0,7/13/2018,I love the performances. I hate the service. I hate the 2 drink min policy.

I would still come back for the performances though.,,1,

I really like that they don't use a stamp at the front door. They provide bracelets. No one likes to have a weird mark on their hand for days after showering. Just one thing I don't agree with is not receiving an itemized bill. I suppose when you ask for the bill, ask for an itemized bill. This is the only place I've ever been and they just write a total and circle. If you have a table, a service charge is applied and the bar will not let you know. Solution? Ask staff all the questions.",5,2,2

The place smelled like straight up MOLD. Okay. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay, and it tasted super old. Like it was fermenting. Not okay. Just drank my Jameson instead with a water back, and asked for the check. She took the wine off the bill, which I expected. But, be aware everyone! THEY CHARGE A 15% gratuity on ALL CHECKS. It's not posted anywhere, it's not defined on the check, and they do it at the bar! We were a party of 2 for one round of drinks! WTF. NOT OKAY.",3,,

The problem: THE RUDEST BOUNCERS I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED. I played a show there and the bouncers were not only rude to me but to my girlfriend. They mocked her South Asian accent and insulted her culture, and at one point refused to let her into the club after we went outside for a smoke (they said they didn't believe that she was on the guest list - even though I walked out with her and specifically told the bouncer that she was my guest). The bouncers also called a few of my friends ""rich kid pricks"" when they checked their IDs and saw they were from a town in Connecticut. It's a bummer that this venue is poisoned by these scummy guys, patrons beware.",5,,
19,Harue J.,"Manhattan, NY",12,269,32,3.0,4/19/2016,"Pretty fun place to listen to some music.  I like going there on the ""music maker NYC"" nights.  While the music CAN be super loud, the crowd is more low key and fun music scene.  You pay admission and are required to order 2 drinks minimum, but they're mostly $7, which is cheap in NYC.NOTE:  What I noticed for the first time last weekend, was that they add 15% tip on the tab, which is totally fine.  BUT when I give my credit card, the card tab to sign has the total w/ the tip amount already INCLUDED but the line for tip is blank.  I've been tipping well over 30% on all my previous visits?!  Lesson learned.",6,,
20,Adrian D.,"New York, NY",144,68,0,2.0,3/5/2017,"It's okay. Great sound quality, great bands, standard $10 cover at the door. The waitresses are rather pushy with the drinks. I can totally understand a one drink minimum + cover but two?! Per set?! I know it's a great location and all but that seems a little excessive. Also, the bathroom situation is nuts. 2 single occupancy bathrooms for a place that gets this crowded?! Have fun standing in line forever. The place itself though has great music and the drinks aren't terribly overpriced considering it is a music venue.That bathroom situation really needs to get taken care of though, and stop being so pushy with the drinks!! It's obvious that you're just trying to fill seats and make money. I get that you're a business, but at least try and have some class..",1,,

I mean if youre into going to places that offend all 5 of your senses go here, catch an infectious disease and be robbed. If youre not, stay away. I actually witnessed a homeless man deficating behind the bar, no joke. Not in an alley either, legitmately behind the bar while the bar tenders were making watered down urinal drinks. Oh by the way 3 drinks run around $100. Furthermore, if you like drinking glass which im assuming came from the ice you should give this place a try ! In a nut shell what I am saying is avoid this place, at all costs.",,,
23,Jordan M.,"New York, NY",8,16,0,1.0,7/13/2016,"The Bitter End - A fitting name for a venue that is a hollow shell of it's former self. Do you like being treated like complete garbage? How about being harassed by waitresses to buy more drinks, or having the bartender refuse to give your friend back his credit card after accidentally leaving it at the bar? Then this is the place for you!If I had to imagine what hell is like, and the type of people I might encounter there, The Bitter End is pretty close. What's astounding is the sheer amount of MEAN, unhappy people one establishment has managed to employ. From the waitresses to the sound guy to the owner, you are guaranteed to be treated like a worthless piece of crap.Furthermore, if you're a band, expect to be harassed by a pompous, arrogant sound guy who has no problem shouting at you through the PA system as 30 of your closest friends and paying customers watch on. Here just to hang out? Hope you like cover charges AND 2-drink minimums, PER SET. This place is more reminiscent of a factory farm, in which customers are herded like cattle, required to buy drinks, then escorted out of their seats the moment they stop drinking. Don't want another drink? Get out.If you enjoy being harassed, verbally abused and treated like garbage, go here, and bask in the palpable negativity that fills this once legendary venue. Or if you have a morsel of self-worth and want to enjoy yourself, do not go here. The legends who once graced this stage would never step foot in here, and as the lineup shows, they still don't.",13,1,

If this keeps up this will be the downfall of the Bitter End. The waitress spoke to me with complete distaste and even came off racist as she gave a Caucasian guy the same 4 seat table she ordered me to get up from, by the end of it I didn't feel like buying my drink much less staying for the rest of the show.

That'll really get you to come back. Also - they charge a service fee on top of a cover to get in. Do they really attract that many douche bags who won't tip? It's nyc for Christ's sake.",5,1,

I don't remember a two drink minimum (on top of a cover), but like I said, I haven't been here in years.  The set up is sort of annoying, the tables are super crowded in - I think it would be smarter to have little booths, because it's essentially the same thing, except you don't have the girl behind you shoving her chair into you trying to get out, and she clearly can not shove the chair anywhere. Because you are practically sitting on top of the stage, it's super loud at the tables. Forgot hearing if you are sitting in the front row. We ordered our mandatory drinks... our entire table got their drinks, the table next to ours got theirs... and my drink is MIA... she forgot to put my drink order in? Our waitress was quite pushy on making sure we ordered our second mandatory round. Now we are ready for round three, which was not mandatory, and the waitress is MIA. Finally flag her down, get our orders in and ask to cash out. As we didn't need to order the drinks, our drinks took a long time to get to us, and our checks even longer. Wouldn't it have been smart to bring it all at once? Less trips?We were all a couple of drinks in, luckily our DD managed to point out to us that the tip was already calculated in, because I didn't notice it at first, and it was on the written bill, but wasn't broke down on the receipt. Unless you are paying in cash, I'd keep a eye on the tip.",5,1,1
30,Jane A.,"Greenwich, CT",0,10,2,3.0,3/8/2017,"Cool place. Guys are the door are wonderful and cover to get in was super reasonable. A truly decent place to see great musicians in an intimate setting. The only bad part (and it was super bad for my bf and a super polite friend of ours new to NYC) was the rude lady bartender obnoxiously hawking for tips before drinks could even be set down! Our friend (who informed her that he had already had more than the 2 drink minimum) was rudely told that he couldn't sit at the bar without ordering more drinks. That flies in a crowded club, but not when there are stools to spare at 11pm on a Monday night. I will probably return, but not so sure about the rest of my party. Ms. Bartender needs to lighten up.",2,,
31,Courtney K.,"Ottawa, Canada",548,353,46,1.0,3/10/2016,"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I came here for my friends show (Anchorlot) and the service was awful. After paying $10 cover, they insisted that we buy drinks if we are sitting at a table. I am currently doing a 30 day detox where I am not permitted to drink alcohol, and tried to explain that to the waiter who says ""you'll have a soda"" and then brings me a coke before I can even tell her that I'm not allowed to have caffeine either. I love anchorlot and the space was nice to watch a band, but the service here is absolutely abysmal. I will never ever ever come back here and I suggest you don't either, unless you want to be treated like trash for trying to do a healthy detox in your life once in a while.",8,2,1

Have been here several times over the past three years to see performances by various friends who sing or write music. That is about the ONLY reason I would go to this bar. They really seem to be holding on to this image of what they were in the past. Now the crowd is touristy and old and the drinks are annoyingly expensive. They also require a two drink minimum and a cover. The cover is just unnecessary. As far as the minimum, I would likely have two drinks regardless so it just seems stingy and like they are micromanaging your table. I do think they have a lot of talented artists come through and the decorations are neat but overall wouldn't recommend.",4,,
33,Elliott F.,"21st/Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN",0,9,0,1.0,12/31/2016,The bartenders at the Bitter End mimic the bar's own name: they're tremendously rude and bitter towards the patrons.

Karan charged me two drinks and added the tip in for me which she claims is what every bar in NYC does. Who does that?! Until they hire real staff STAY AWAY!,8,,
34,Anita G.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,3,3,2.0,1/6/2017,"Came here with a friend on New Years. Firstly, as soon as we sat down the waitress was already waiting for us to order the drinks. Since my friend is underage, and since there is a 2 drink minimum -- I was going to order myself two drinks and asked if that would be ok, but the waitress didn't allow that. Ok, whatever, so I went to speak with the bartender and got myself one drink (and kept the tab open so I can get the second one after I would finish the first) and so I placed the drink at our table. I didn't even drink the drink and the waitress came up to us quickly and assumed that my underage friend was drinking it and told us, in the exact words, ""get out,"" giving us a dirty look. Sorry to say but that is no person to represent someone's bar/venue. We then went to speak with the nice owner I believe that was by the entrance and he refunded us our money.",5,,

I have been here several times when my boyfriend or his friends happened to be performing there. However, I think the acoustics could be slightly more subtle and the box office people need a serious lesson on social skills. I brought a friend who seemed shy and wary of the guy sitting in the box office back in January, and she was right to be because he assumed that because she was quiet and reserved she didn't talk, when in fact she did, and stereotyped her because of her culture. Though the bitter end usually makes a strong effort to distribute positive vibes (literally and figuratively) it does NOT in the box office 'department'.",,,

We're told there are live bands and the cover charge is $10. That's it. When we get to the place, a very nice man greets us and tells us about the $10 and that it covers all the live bands. After we pay and sit, there's a sign on the table that says ""minimum 2 drinks per show"".   How come nobody told us that before we already paid? The service was bad too.

So one of the bartenders kept asking me to order another drink even before I finished mine. Then when I finished my drink, I continually was harassed to order another. Instead I ordered water and they tried giving me a bottle of water (money grab) and I asked for tap instead. Then they asked me to stand at the back of the club instead of sitting so I asked to close my tab. They tried charging me $10 for my one drink. I made them void it and charge me correctly (still charged me $8 for a bottle which apparently included gratuity which was never disclosed) then one of the bartenders called me a dick for not tipping on the receipt.

42,Michelle C.,"Lima, OH",0,9,3,2.0,9/10/2016,"Scam alert! Cool venue but any place that hands you a credit card slip to sign with a total that UNKNOWINGLY includes gratuity (but also a space to add gratuity) is sketchy as hell. After checking out a handwritten, FOLDED tab (hidden details?!) we noticed that the service had been included. Not only is this illegal (I don't overly have a problem with this-I'm in the industry, some people don't tip) but the fact that the credit card slip doesn't indicate that gratuity is included is extremely misleading. Folding up this fact and hiding it at the bottom of the tray is merely covering their asses. Any other credit card slip I've ever been handed highlights the fact that the grat is included, if indeed, it has. This method in the BitterEnd all but ensures that people are double tipping constantly on their tabs. Pretty much stealing from customers as far as I can see. If the bartenders are concerned they won't get their dollar-a-drink tip, then maybe just improve their service and don't steal from people. The fact the other reviews going back months have mentioned this before means the owner is aware of this deception and obviously doesn't give a shit.

From the minute you step inside, you can just feel all the history. So many iconic acts have started out here so it was an honor just to be invited to perform.The space was small which was to be expected. It's more of an acoustic venue. Technically, you could fit a full band on stage but it would be cramped and I wouldn't recommend it. The club owner couldn't have been nicer. He catered to us the entire time, making sure we had everything we needed. And as far s sound quality goes, this venue was outstanding.

Everyone is recovering  from the weekend, but yesterday was awesome. The bar had an entrance fee of 10$ per person because an artist was performing. It was worth the $20 I paid. The drinks were cool.

A lot of people in the Yelp reviews complain about the cover charge and two drink minimum, but that's how a lot of jazz clubs and comedy clubs work. It cant be such a bad business model, considering the place has been in operation since 1961. Two drinks on a Friday night after work is not a terrible idea...

The group after their's wasn't too shabby, so with a sample size of 3 groups, I would say the Bitter End books some pretty good talent. The drink selection is unimpressive and the prices are on the high side. There is a 2 drinks minimum per person per show (in addition to the cover charge) if you sit at the tables, but if you stand or are at the bar, there is no minimum for drinks.

53,Jerry L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,35,0,2.0,3/9/2017,"Came down to see a friend's band. Box office was polite and efficient. Evening flowed well as far as performers' start times being close to stated times. Band sound was excellent, and the soundperson was clearly paying attention every minute and doing a great job.  I don't understand the complaining about the $10 cover and/or the 2 drink minimum, which was clearly stated on a sign at the table.  The two of us had three drafts each over the course of the set and evrything was good.  Until I asked for the check. I'm a NYCer. I'm nearly impervious to sticker shock in anything, but especially music clubs, having played in plenty and also having spent many evenings supporting friends' bands and having to spend far more than one would like to in order to do so.  It comes with this territory. But something was clearly bananas with this total, which the waitress told me but did not give me a check for.  I gave her large bills which necessitated a fair chunk comng back to me, and I politely asked her to check our bill because there was probably an error. She first asked if I wanted the change, which I thought was pretty damn cheeky given I had just asked her to verify my total. I said yes, and as she was about to slip back away I broached the subject again to which she replied, refusing to make eye contact, that it was the tax, which wouldn't account for it.  I politely asked to see the check and she said, avoiding me and acting shifty, ""it's the service charge"" and ran off.  Does The Bitter End actually include the gratuity on two person checks? If they do (and that's no big deal) do they need to be reminded that their waitresses add it on and then imply that they don't, so the patron owes a gratuity on this bogus total?  In my case I was intimately aware of The Bottom Line's waitress handbook of check scams, which seems to live on with this staff.   5 stars for everything except my 0 star waitress.  I get that it's not a great situation and we're all trying to get by.

I went here last night to see my cousin play in his band and of course they were great and I'm very happy I went for that reason, but I will never give them a penny of my money IF I ever come here again (unlikely). When I first tried to order a drink I finally got the attention of a tall masculine girl with a dark brown ponytail. She looked at me, said, and I quote..""What?"" That was the first turn off.During the show we sat down and ordered a drink from a nice waitress. She asked if I had a tab opened up at the bar and I said no, and she asked if I would like too so I said sure. She came back once during the show asking if we needed anything else, and we said no. I should have asked for the check but I presumed we might drink more after a cigarette and I could close it out at the bar. Once we were about to leave I went up to the only space I could find at the bar to close it out and rudely was told I couldn't stand there, ""this is the waitress serving area."" I said I'm sorry and that I wasn't trying to hang out there just wanted the bartenders attention so I could close out my tab. I got an impolite response that I needed to ""move."" Finally got an older woman's attention who was working behind the bar. I told her I wanted to close out my tab and I gave her my name. She said bluntly that she didn't have my card. I said I ordered with a waitress and she told me I was opening a BAR tab. She said ""well then you're gonna have to go find your waitress."" I said I thought I could easily close it at the bar seeming how it was a bar tab. She had such an attitude for no reason. I finally said ""what's your problem?"" And clearly menopause hit her at that very moment and she started yelling at me telling me she ""ain't doing this with me."" I said I simply want my credit card back and that I wasn't aware of the fact that I as the customer had to go on a goose hunt trying to find a waitress that I wasn't positively sure looked like. I told her that her customer service was horrendous and I was going to call tomorrow to complain about it and she responded with ""go ahead, i ain't going anywhere."" I just don't understand why some people just naturally want to be nasty out of the blue and almost pick a fight. Life is too short why can't we all just get along and respect each other?After waiting a good 15 minutes a medium length blonde haired girl who wasn't the waitress came up to me and gave me my check and apologized. I managed to get the old bartenders name ((((KAREN))))). Of course that could be a fake name, but whatever.

56,Nina P.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,214,53,2.0,6/23/2013,"I looked at a few reviews below and found them to be incredibly accurate, rude waiting staff is the biggest problem at this location. I went to this venue to listen to the live music (which undoubtly is the best part of this place). My friend and I immediately purchased beers and sat next to the stage. The waitress was incredibly pushy, insisting that we buy another drink, even when we weren't ready for another one. It became very clear to me that she was getting frustrated with me because I drink my beers very slowly. But since purchasing anything in NYC is substantially more expensive, I like to savor my beers. The worst part about this venue is that if everybody in your party doesn't have a drink, then you have to leave the table you are sitting at if you are close to the stage. I find this rule to be incredibly offputting. What if somebody in our group is the DD? I feel that if I have purchased a drink at all, I should have the freedom to sit anywhere. I also find it unsettling how much the waitresses would pressure people to have another drink. I understand that this is a business tryin to make money, but that is also a risky way to get people to go overboard and drink part their limit. I am not sure if The Bitter End reads these reviews, but if they do, PLEASE please please stop hiring waitors/waitresses that are pushy and please stop forcing people to leave their seats close to the stage if they do not have drinks. It will just lead to a better experience for all involved, and better Yelp reviews!",1,2,

There is a two drink minimum for these types of shows in order to secure a table, which I think is fair. It was very crowded, thanks to my friends' group's popularity, along with the popularity of the comedians. I found the service fine, and heard that it is a pretty respected venue where a lot of now famous and popular singers and songwriters got there start.I would come back to see other performances, even if the acts don't include any of my friends; however I was pretty annoyed with the over-eager service charge that was automatically added to our bill. This 15 percent service charge (automatically assuming we want to tip that much) always irks me. I really don't like establishments like this, so if I go back, I would avoid the table service and just stand at the bar.

The bracelet that signifies I paid the $10 cover was put on my hand very well. No overlap on the sticky bit at all.Now onto the meat of it. Never have I felt so unwelcome, harassed, and hated at a bar. I went in to see one band in a seven act show and what should have been a fun time getting drunk with my friends was just a constant harassment by the wait staff. The selection is terrible but God forbid you take more than a second to decide what you want, that's strike one. If you don't down your drink and immediately order the next one, that's strike two. If you take a seat in the back braise you have a giant bag and don't want to block the aisle but the rest of your party isn't there yet that's strike three. Get ready for some god awful treatment.The real glory of the waitstaff though is insisting not that the two drink minimum per person per show is a per act minimum. I'm a small person. Two drinks every half hour is more than I can physically hold. There's only two bathrooms and a long line down a narrow hallway. Now, my groups stubborn refusal to drink ourselves to death at the table had the waitstaff angrier than normal. In addition o haranguing and harassing us, one of them seemed to be trying to fight me. Physically. Pushing drinks I didn't order into my hand and telling me I'm going to pay after I closed out my tab.There was an automatic 15% gratuity. So while the waitresses were very doting in breathing down our necks, I did not feel gratitude. I told the waitress as much because at that point, she'd already threatened to kick us out for not drinking enough. But I paid it because my friends band still had not gone on stage.4 drinks, $30. I don't care about NYC prices, I live in NYC. Fuck your dumb shit prices. The waitresses wouldn't let me sit down without ordering more drinks, yelled at me to get up. Tried to force a drink into my hand. We waited outside with the high school kids from Long Island (my literal nightmare) and then went back into to see my friends band.

Where else can you see Alfa, Magnetic North, Taiyo Na on one satge?The venue is odd. There is a low raised stage with tables that face the center of the stage. It is great if you score a seat. Not so great if you are standing. The place got really packed and the waitresses had a hard time maneuvering between tables and bodies swarming around. Just make the place all standing already. And despite the venue failing, I couldn't help but still enjoy myself. Alpha has an amazing sultry voice and she reminds me a bit of Rachael Yamagata. It is great break-up suicide music. After a couple of her songs, I was ready to heat up the night with something more fast-paced. A singer from Cali named Scooter came up next and he reminded me of Rage Against the Machine. Now we're talking. But what really made me grin from ear to ear was Magnetic North and Taiyo Na. Magnetic North is a duo Asian hip hop group. One is a girl and although tiny, she packs a major punch. That girl can rap. ""She is like an Asian MC Lyte,"" as per RT.  I have to agree. Taiyo Na is hip hop and soul rolled into one cute Asian face.

The band and the singer were actually quite good.  I was not a fan that we had to pay a cover and then once inside, signs on the table announced a two drink minimum per set.

We got up only to realize we could not sit at a table either because there is a two drink minimum if you sit at a table. OK, because paying to enter the crappy venue and the fact that my husband was in one of the bands wasn't enough. Often times when he plays shows he gets free drinks but this place just kept kicking us down and wanting more of our money. I also helped the band move equipment in and out of the bar. Upon leaving, the bouncer yelled at me to shut the door because I was letting the AC out.

The 2nd time was last night, we had the worse customer service ever. The waitress a short skinny blonde came to us straight after we sat at the table to take our order, she didn't even greet us. She came back several times to ask us if we wanted more drinks. I hadn't touch my 2nd drink when she brought us the bill, we didn't ask for it, we'd been here for about 1 hour, we were still sitting enjoying the music and definitely would have ordered more drinks later. For 3 $7 beers ""served"" without a smile, the service charge was $5! We then decided that we would not order more drinks but the horrible waitress kept coming back to take order. Just after the 2nd show, she came and told us to order more drinks or we would have to stand by the bar because there is a minimum of 2 drinks/person/show. I told her that I still had a full beer and I would decide later if I wanted to drink more. She came back less than 10 minutes after looking mad and she was very aggressive, she told us to order now or to leave our table (the bar was empty so no one was waiting to get a table!). I told her that we didn't want more drinks, we just wanted to enjoy the music, the reason we came in the first place and we paid the $5 entrance fee for that. But all she would do was showing us the sign that say 2 drinks per show/person, like an idiot saying ""you have to drink or you stand by the bar or I call the bouncer"". I was so angry, I told her that we were leaving and she stood by our table waiting for us to get up and leave, I told her to go and that we didn't need her to assist us and eventually she left to return to her spot by the bar. We left 5 minutes later before the 3rd band started, all the waitresses/bartenders and the bouncer were looking at us like we had stolen or broken something!

There's a cover, its too loud, drinks aren't cheap, bathrooms suck, rock and roll, the whole deal.People who said its a college crowd are smoking something. (Maybe pass it?) I've been here 5 or 6 times and the average age is about 40. Still, they book a lot of has-beens and up-and-comers who really rock out. It is ALL about the music. 110%.

112,roderick A.,"Jersey City, NY",188,768,308,4.0,5/7/2008,"Tonight was my first time coming to The Bitter End, and what a first time it was. Talk about losing your virginity, I'm glad I went all the way!Tonight's show was one of the best shows I have ever been to.  And apparently it was a historic show, because he had first played there 40 years ago and tonight was his homecoming. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to mention who I saw: NEIL DIAMOND. Yes, THE Neil Diamond. ""Love on the Rocks"" Neil Diamond. ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"" Neil Diamond. ""Song Sung Blue"" Neil Diamond. I know i'm forgetting a song or two but these i remember him doing:- Solitary Man- Don't go There- Pretty Amazing Gracehe then talked about how he first appeared at the bitter end 40 years ago and how glad he was to be back home. Then he said, ""let's do some oldies"" and launched into:- Kentucky Woman- Cherry Cherry- Sweet Carolineplayed just under 40 minutes but what an amazing 40 minutes of bliss. As you can see from the picture, he was thatclosetome. As for the place itself, like everyone says its where you go see up and coming bands and singers. People who've played there include Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, Woody Allen and others. So coming here, you may just be seeing a future legend. And since its an old place, don't expect classic, A-1 furniture or service. Yes, the waitresses were pretty good, considering they had to keep maneuvering around the excessive crowd. But they were good, and the drinks were cheap. I think I paid $4 for a Pabst, I don't remember because the dude next to me bought my drink.The tables are small, and can fit 4-6 people, and there are a few tables right in front of the stage. There is a little back area with a raised floor where you can still see the stage rather easily. All in all, it's a divey place but with alot of history. I'm glad that I came during one of those historic nights. And apparently, the owners also knew it was a big deal, so they installed speakers outside on the sidewalk, and they kept the windows open so people could peer inside to watch as well. Only in New York.",9,,12
113,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,4.0,11/27/2012,"This is one of those places where you can get a Seattle-y show, whether it's from a punk or '90s or acid jazz or grrrl rock band from a buxom 40-year-old front woman wearing all red velvet and black Doc Marten boots. And it'll all happen in the same night, ensuring that you can stay and enjoy the trip from the quiet beginning through the raucous or distracted middle to the quiet end of the night. Most interesting of all, it'll all happen in a classic Lower East Side space (aka dankish den half a story below street level), and the effect won't be altogether incongruous. You notice that this place is all right as you approach it and notice that there are douchebags, scenesters, hipsters, and miscellaneous assholes lining up or clusterfucking or smoking outside all the neighboring business NOT plaguing the immediate radius of The Bitter End. Outside The Bitter End, you will find modestly dressed regular folks in their 20s through 80s, and you will not be pissed off by the mere sight of them.When you walk in through the doors, there's a tiny foyer with a bouncer who checks your ID and a box office with someone who takes your money and offers you entry into the venue. After coming here several times, I've learned that the people at the door are regulars, and they're not dicks, unlike all the other bouncers and guards in the entire LES/NYUV-Vill/SOHO trifecta. This is a noteworthy thing, and has a greater positive impact on the night than I knew before (having so rarely experienced a welcoming, ""you're in"" kind of feeling when entering any NYC establishment requiring a door fee).The rickety tables, hard chairs, high-chair countertops, and decent sized wooden bar absorb more people than one would think possible. While waiting outside to watch a couple StorySLAMS by The Moth, I'd feel disheartened by the lines wrapping around the block, only to find a seat inside amongst the leagues of people who'd also found a seat. Even those standing don't look as uncomfortable as standing people are wont to look, because there surfaces to lean on or isolated nooks from which to peer at the elevated stage.The carpeted, elevated stage is the best part of this place, I think. It's only about 1.5 feet off the ground, but ensures that virtually everyone will see something. It's best if you can squeeze in at one of the front tables abutting the stage because then you can even dare to perch your feet on the stages edge as bands rock and storytellers flow on. There are often a few seats available this close up, because most people feel uncomfortable with the intimacy of being inches from performers. I love it, though.The Bitter End is also one of the only places in the world in which the line for the male restroom is as long as the line for the female restroom. There's only one of each, strictly enforced by Men and Women signs, and the social enforcement by the ladies and gents mingling in the bottleneck of a hallway that houses the pissers. The close quarters actually make for opportunities with the opposite (or same) sex, because people end up chatting each other up while waiting in agony. I've found, though, that this is also one of the only places in the world in which the line for the female restroom moves as fast as the line for the male restroom, validating my impatient suspicion that women don't need THAT much more time with the toilet than men do. Haven't been in the guys' room, but the ladies' room is a stickered, graffiti'ed, dank, small place, but show-goers seem to treat it with a level of respect not befitting the underground scene, which in itself seems counterculture in a COOL way. What I'm saying is that for once, thank Jesus, there isn't fucking piss on on the seat or shit on the walls or barf in the sink.The single most glaring complaint to temper an otherwise fawning review is anything involving drinks at this place. Drinks suck, the cups are hideous, and even a Rolling Rock is $6. That's like charging $10 for a quarter pounder at McD's. None of this wouldn't be a problem in a place that encouraged freedom of will, allowing for abstinence from the purchase of these shoddy liquid products. But here, they have a 2 drink minimum for all shows. And believe it or not, this minimum IS enforced with gestapo-grade efficiency, lightly veiled by the desperate kind of sweetness by the artsy looking (think Basquiat, not Warhol) female servers.What a shame that a place where you could actually enjoy a pretty rocking environment completely sober if you wanted to forces you to have craphouse drinks. Yah, I get it, this is how they make their money. But is this the ONLY way to make their money? But come on, guys, if you reduced the price of Rolling Rock to $4 a pop, I'd have five instead of the required two, thereby spending more and bitching less. Consider it, because I certainly want nothing to do with your mixed drinks unless some serious changes are made.",9,5,5

123,Lori K.,"Orange County, CA",283,985,141,3.0,5/9/2008,"Was in NY for a week and made my way down to the Village to see a show. I arrived well into a performer's set and since all the tables/seats around the stage were taken I sat at the bar. This wouldn't have been an issue but all the bar stools were broken and the bartender was making a lot of noise. At one point during one of the quieter acoustic songs, the bartender decided to load and unload the ice buckets. Not sure why that couldn't have been done between songs.When the set was over, the performer was hanging around the bar so most of the fans abandoned their seats to talk to each other, get drinks, visit the restroom etc while the stage was set up for the next act. Since these were acoustic acts the switchover didn't take too long and before we knew it the next set has begun. The probelm was new people had arrived to see the next set which left a bunch of people seatless, standing around unable to see the stage or socialize since that would disturb other people's ability to hear the performer so people had no choice but to migrate outside and leave. It seemed like too many people were let in for that night's show. I love live music shows and I love bars, but this place doesn't blend the two elements well.

Updated review","It's so sad to see these famous venues be taken over by dirty scumbags and greedy promoters. They have a two drink minimum per person per show so if you're there for 4 or more bands, plan on getting alcohol poisoning otherwise they will physically and quite literally throwing you out as they did to me and my friends. The bands are terrible, the promoter is a Foul, heartless human being. I watched the managers as well as promoters on separate occasions Kurasawa bands and scream at them in front of customers for not bringing enough heads. That's money to the layman. They screamed at the bands for not bringing them money. I repeat and please read this and think about what I'm saying, they screamed at the bands, who are bringing them their heart and soul and with their hearts on their sleeve, For not bringing them enough cash money. What a dirty horrible American indicative cesspool. Please boycott this venue.",1,,

The place had a very friendly vibe with nice people. There were also performers, which made the place more chill.The only I issue I had of the place though was that they wanted customers to buy a minimum of two drinks per show performer if you want to sit at a table. This forced us having to buy drinks, which I didn't mind, but if I had the option not to then that would have been good. Their beer selection wasn't bad though so I wasn't complaining.

Very sad how such a great legendary club with a reputation of being artist friendly as well as a great spot to see new undiscovered great talent has fallen so low to be barely recognizable, except of course for the club decor and sound system which seems to have not been updated in many many many years or for that matter has not been even cleaned in many years if you happen to need to use the bathroom facility or use a light in this very dimly lit room to actually look at the table or chair you are sitting on or the floor underneath you.",1,,

First you have to pay a $10 cover which is alright, but when i walked in i thought the stage was too big for such a small place. Me and my boyfriend had to stand next to the bar for the first half hour or so and it was annoying to have people passing by your side and pushing, since it was our first time we didnt know that you had to request a bartender for seating...once we got our seats we found out there was a two drink minimum and the drinks were fairly priced.one thing that i found annoying is that since the place is so small and you are so close to the stage, its so intimate, you cannot get up in the middle of a performance because it would be too noticeable and rude. when i drink beer, i constantly need to go to the restroom and i felt bad get it up everytime i needed to go, i guess youll just have to wait until the breaks. then there is only one restroom and thats annoying because everyone gets up during the breaks, i guess they were holding it just like me, and it gets crowded back there, it gets uncomfortable. but other than that the place was pretty cool, the music is the focus, the music and the performers are likeable even they're not playing your preferred genre.",,,

We were standing outside, about to catch a cab when a guy driving a nice town car came up and asked us if we wanted to ride with him instead.... We headed out and tried to find some jazz venue, but upon arrival found out there was a private party inside. not sure of where to go next, the driver said he knew of a great place that had a live band that night we would enjoy.... So off we went to destination unknown. He pulled up the bitter end and I knew from first impressions it wasn't my typical sort of hang out, but I was good and drunk by this time and could care less. Our new driver friend ""Max"" was so nice, he gave us his cell and told us to call him when we were ready to leave, and he would pick us up. Inside it reminded me of a bar that I used to frequent in college... the smell of stale beer in the air, big and loud, boring-looking, bad lighting, all wooden tables and uncomfortable wobbly chairs. The band hadn't started yet so it was not packed yet, but that changed quickly. We ended up sitting towards the back because I wasn't sure I wanted to stay.... When the band started, I changed my mind. Sorry I don't remember the bands name.... but I liked their music. So did the crowd, because it got crazy in there fast!We sat at this huge table for 10 and as it filled up, I invited this timid looking group of girls to sit with us. Turns out they were all 21 and 22 yrs old..... and they acted like it was their first time in a bar. as the night progressed I ended up making friends with all the girls. They were all single and the matchmaker that I am, I started to invite ""cute boys"" to our table for their entertainment. The girls were all nice, shy and innocent-looking and thought it was absolutely hilarious I was just waving guys over.... by the end of the night we had about 20 people crowded around our creaky beer stained table. Success!The night flew by and next thing I knew the show was over and I was waaaaaay drunk..... we called our driver friend Max and he rushed over to get us, then drove us back to the Westin.

152,Emma S.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,222,85,4.0,4/28/2008,"The Bitter End has a great setup for small shows. Seating is tiered, so that you can sit right at the stage for an intimate experience or farther back & higher up if you want to sit back and sip a drink with friends while watching bands play. Tables are big enough for 4 or 6 people to easily sit together. There's also a small dance floor area off to the back of the club (left of the stage) if you want to get down without getting in the way of the hardworking waitstaff. There are some harsh reviews of employees here, but I generally find that I get back what I give. The staff here have always been very nice to me and my friends. Even the burly bouncer guy greeted us with a smile when we came back here last time!Cover is generally $8-10 for shows. The selection of liquors is pretty bottom-shelf (about what I'd expect in a dive bar) so we tend to stick with beer. It's a fun place to go for a low-key night. If you're in a band and booking a show here, I don't know what the minimum draw you have to have is (a dozen people?) but after that, bands get about 30% of cover. Meh.

I really liked the vibe of this place and, though it was small, I really liked how accessible the stage was to the audience. Since my friend and I were sitting at a table, we didn't have to deal with getting through the crowd at the bar for drinks, but instead had a server. They did have a ""2 drink per person per performer"" rule, which I didn't mind too much because I would've had the same amount either way, but just FYI in case you aren't interested in drinking too much when you go. Drink prices were pretty standard for NYC, though I would have liked to know the price of the beer I was ordering. Probably wouldn't have made a difference in how many I had, but I just like knowing. In any case, I had a great time and would definitely come back to see another show here. One thing that did bother me ever so slightly, though not about the venue itself, was their website. I went to check it out before going, as I had never been to the venue before, and I was left unimpressed. It seemed to be lacking info, current pics, and mainly the kind of pizazz I would have expected, what with the rock history I'd heard this place had.

There is a traditional bar area and plenty of tables in front and along the stage.

If you agree with this and live in NYC - Bitter End is hopefully a staple in your live show venue rotation.Putting all of the rich history aside, Bitter End still stands strong as a great place to hear legends that are not yet born and aspiring artists who are on the rough make it or break it musical journey.The 2 drink table minimum is highly reasonable and only sets you back about $15. With most shows costing $7-$10 - the Bitter End makes for a fun, affordable and often inspirational evening.I love this place.",1,,
165,ITtv N.,"Manhattan, NY",103,9,2,4.0,12/27/2013,"This is a historical music venue where quite a few major artists got their start & played regularly. When in attendance you will see sketches of Stevie Wonder & Bill Cosby on a painted wall along with other celebrities who once performed at The Bitter End. I can see why the venue is a preferred place for artists to perform. IT is a very cozy place with pretty good customer service. The atmosphere is warm & when the musicians are on stage you can almost reach out & touch them because the stage is quite large for a venue that is not that big in size. What the venue lacks in size IT makes up for in character & great sound. The sound system is another great reason why I'm sure so many musicians & singers play The Bitter End. I usually only visit the location when Olamide Faison is performing but every time I go I'm impressed with how good the sound always is. FYI, Olamide is one of the best singers I have seen live so if you don't know you better ask somebody & you definitely need to see his next show! So check The Bitter End website calendar & remember to go down to The Bitter End. IT is one of those places you have to visit when in New York City!",,,

Expect to pay about $10 to get in and overpay for drinks by a little ($6 Bass, but there's a discount if you're in one of the bands). If you can, try to get a table, else it's hard to see much of the bands, but try to get it in the back. It's a small space so your ears will most likely be ringing at the end of the night.",,1,

I realize it, and I understand that the first step is acceptance of how powerless I may be in the face of all this snobbery. (mmm...snob-berries) That being said, I've been to my share of and performed at my share of open mic nights with a mixed bag of results. Kind of like karaoke. Some good, some less so. I was completely struck by this open mic night that I (quite literally) stumbled into. The set up was like so:  full band on stage, MC would get on the mic and call someone from his list. The aforementioned called up individual would get on stage and replace someone, be that the drummer, guitarist, whoever shared the same bag. You follow me so far? Good. New guy would tell every one on stage what he or she planned to play. Every musician would follow along and play the song like they'd been playing it together for years. It was awesome. Then, after another song or two they would call someone else up, change out a different band member and play the newest guy's song. I had never seen this level of musicianship at any open mic night before. One of the waitresses even went up to sing a couple of songs and she was f-ing on fire. Great night of live music adventures.

I understand the merits of the place: great history, great atmosphere, great table space, and great back area for a good view of the stage in a couple of bleacher-esque rows.But I came to see a co-worker of a friend's show, and let me tell you, the sound system was killing me. That and how packed it was. The bar area was absolutely impossible, and nobody was moving, and I got stuck in the walkway, and believe me I didn't stay after the show. Paying 7 to block people's views and have people for no reason just come in and out of the bar area while the show was going on was not my idea of a good time. I may go back on a quieter night, say a Tuesday, and see how it is then. Maybe I'll update my review. But the staff wasn't happy, there were too many people.Maybe I'm biased because I really prefer to keep my drinking and live music separate. I don't really like watching musical performances at bars unless it's cabaret or something showy. Maybe I also have a distrust for singer/songwriters. Because there are so many of them.

We will never return as one of your bar staff (skinny, long blondish/fair hair) was so rude to various members of our group that it ruined our night.

The walls are plagued with posters, photos and lists of some very heavy hitters in the past forty plus years. On this night I saw: Megan Light, Chip Greene, The Josh Dion Band ($7), Downtown Harvest and Sunday Morning Chameleon. As a very talented friend of mine said about the music industry, it is ""not about talent but good luck when a performer makes it"" All of the acts I saw this night were fun, exciting and had stage presence. Each could be a next ""big act"" but as it is, you will only catch some of them in places like ""the bitter end"".The place is essentially a big room, bar and stage with tables: the kind of place you see as a smoked filled room in the days when this neighborhood was for the avant-garde. The price of everything, admission, beer, drinks all very average. They do not serve any food but you can bring in anything you want to eat: no problem. I actually ran up the street for a couple of slices in between acts. The place was busy until the last band.
