Updated review",10,,"Massapequa, NY",Patrick G.,208,5.0,107,"The Tap Room has become a regular stop for the Mrs. and I. Killer beer selection and very very good food (more specials would make it perfect).We really love places where the service rocks, and the Tap Room is great on that... especially when Gina has our table (we look for her when we get there). Please give her a raise!The latest visit was a spinach/artichoke/bacon dip with awesome pita chips. (Damn... crispy outside and pillowey soft inside!) It was perfect. We both had the chicken tenders, and it as great... and the leftovers will end up (as there's a TON of chicken) in jambalaya this week!We dig the live music, the happy hour and just about everything about the Tap Room!",
1,1,8/3/2018,725,,"Bellmore, NY",Michelle D.,75,1.0,44,"!!!DOES NOT ALLOW ENTRY WITH ENHANCED LICENSE!!!Unfortunately the tap room has uneducated security working. If you decide to visit this establishment you might not be able to get into the door because I was denied entry for having an enhanced New York State license and the security never heard of one before. The situation escalated with in the 30 seconds It took me to walked in and hand my ID to security he had to put a hand on me to try to escort me out for trying to explain to him what an enhanced license was.  He would not allow me to show him another form of valid Identification and did not ask me any questions pertaining to my license so beware as they will give you a hard time.Personally, I would recommend spending your well earned money at another bar that can provide you the same without having to argue with security. Also, the Tap Room is well known for all the underage drinking to begin with so after a long days work and you go out to grab a few drinks it can be extremely agitating to get treated like that with valid form of ID. The best thing about this experience was that I got extremely good drinks and food at another local bar I probably would have not tried if it wasn't for this!",2
2,,6/10/2018,95,,"Lagrangeville, NY",Victoria W.,2,4.0,3,"Stopped into The Tap Room originally just for drinks and to watch a game on a Sunday night around 8. For a Sunday, it was pretty crowded and the bar seating was filled so we settled for a table for 2; however, there are plenty of TVs within view so we didn't mind. We chose a flight of 6 beers from their beer list which included several local brews as well as others. Sundays are $5 mussels so we decided to play it safe and try out the white. They also had drunken german, red, white, buffalo and bleu cheese, potato and bacon, and an asian style. The mussels came with 4 slices of garlic bread. The portion was large and the size of the mussels themselves were large as well. The white sauce was tasty and the bread, although nothing to write home about itself, was good dipped in the sauce. For $5 they were definitely worth it, and I would pay full price as well. The atmosphere is laid back but loud and fun. Our server was kind and attentive and the food and drinks arrived in a timely manner. Definitely plan on returning!",

4,,11/15/2018,0,,"East Meadow, NY",Bethann S.,7,4.0,30,It's a pubs atmosphere and pub food with a twist. Not much to pick from. But they have a lot of different beers. Loud but good. Would go back,
5,,4/1/2018,249,,"Massapequa Park, NY",Matt G.,265,4.0,186,"Tap room offers a cool atmosphere with a large beer and food selection. I'm never disappointed anytime I go here.Food wise I highly recommend any of their  mussels, the fried pickles, the short rib grilled cheese, and basically any of their sandwiches lol. Drink wise they have a large tap selection along with a decent drink menu. They also always have some type of deal or weekly special going on. My two favorites are Thursday night $14 all you can eat buffalo wings and .50 can't pbr cans(don't hate on the pbr ppl), and Friday $5 mussels. Only down side to a good bar is the wait. Tap room gets packed so prepare to wait.",1
6,,7/31/2018,5,,"Seaford, NY",Eric G.,16,1.0,117,"The food is good, the beers are cold but this boggles my head. My friends and went here for taps and apps night on Monday night. All the other nights that have deals show a specific time on the menu. We got there at 5 and we're told ""oh that deal starts at 7"". That's total crap because it doesn't say it on the menu. Happy hour is usually from 4-6. Super disappointed with that, we won't be back.",
7,,11/2/2018,33,,"Massapequa, NY",Kim D.,0,5.0,5,"We recently had dinner at The Tap Room with our three children, one with a milk allergy. It was Friday night so it was crowded but the waitress and kitchen staff were so attentive to our daughters allergy. The waitress returned to our table several times to provide information and offer ideas to replace the typical children's menu items. We were so appreciative! Must also mention the short rib sliders are delicious! All the food I've tried there has been very good.",

Updated review",24,,"Valley Stream, NY",Michael G.,1,4.0,7,Mussels mussels mussels!!!! My friend had the dry rub wings and said they were really good. I'm going back to try more food.1/15 - went back for more.,
9,2,3/12/2018,150,,"Seaford, NY",James L.,160,5.0,36,"Since this is where Lahna and I met on our first date, it has a special place in our hearts. Plus we go here almost every Friday night for drinks and we love the bartenders, especially Brian and Jesse. It's a given that we'd give it 5 stars. But even if this wasn't our spot, we'd still give it 5 stars for many other reasons. The food is always excellent. Some of our favorite apps are the wings, the quesadilla and definitely the white mussels. As far as entrees, I always go with the short rib sliders with the strawberry salad. I love it and could eat it everyday!! Lahna usually gets the chicken avocado wrap.Amazing selection of craft beers. I usually go with a Blue Point Toasted Lager, but sometimes I'll get a Great South Bay Blonde. After a few beers I'll switch to their Old Fashioned because I love a good bourbon cocktail.And the best thing about the Tap Room is the live music. Whether it's Fred the Human iPod, Bad Sandwich or DJ Frankie, there's always something to sing along to.The Tap Room is a great pub and we look forward to many more fun-filled Friday night date nights there!",2
10,,12/23/2017,22,1,"Long Beach, NY",Kevin V.,127,1.0,71,"Place has seriously gone downhill from its opening, which is a shame considering they have always had a pretty solid rotating tap menu and the bar bites have been yummy. I have a major problem with an establishment that turns customers away for arbitrary, non-sensical reasons. Case in point: my brothers are in town for the holidays and we wanted to grab a drink and catch up. Got to the door and...turned away (my three brothers are 23, 27 and 31). Reason? We were told this was a local-only bar and no out-of-staters were allowed in. Are you kidding me? Way to put on an ill-justified air of exclusivity and offend your patrons. We have been here dozens of times in the past (surprise surprise my brothers living out of state did not present an issue then). This is not the way to solve what I must assume is a problem identifying underage drinkers. Invest in a scanner or get some bouncers sufficiently competent to recognize legitimate IDs. Clearly the Tap Room thinks it does not need/ does not want your business around the holiday season. This is one ""local"" that will not be stopping by anytime soon. Save the frustration this holiday and walk down the block to the Good Life. The rotating taps rival Tap Room's in quality and the food is better anyway.",10
11,1,5/7/2017,319,,"Long Island, NY",Ann L.,217,5.0,198,"This place is great!! They have a great selection of wings- more than just your regular BBQ sauced wings! The dry Cajun rubbed wings are out of this world amazing. Wish I could have them every day!Beer selection is great too- not sure why other reviews hate on the local selection of blue point, but if you don't like those, they have SO many others from all over- from Germany, Czech, to Ballast Point (San Diego) to sweetwater (Atlanta I believe)...there's so much! Try something new :)We had $4 drafts and $5 mussels during happy hour and also wings which are $12 and so worth it. Been here for dinner a different time, too, and burgers and salad are both great. Definitely a great atmosphere for a fun time or a quick bite- fills up on weekends and even on a casual Wednesday, especially if there's a game on.",4
12,2,4/28/2018,51,1,"Hicksville, NY",Nikki L.,85,4.0,59,"I've heard about this place, but its not quite in my neck of the words. I met up with some coworkers for happy hour and I was pretty happy!Inside is really nice with a big bar with so many great beers on tap. Theres a bunch of tvs and even a small spot for live music! Love it! The table next to us ordered some really good looking food so I cant wait to come back to try it and update this review. Did try that big pretzel though! Buttery, hot, with 2 types of dipping cheeses. Mmm.Most of the place has wood panels. As beautiful as it is, once it gets a little crowded and the live music starts, its gets difficult to hear the person next to you. Cant wait to come back though! Stay tuned for update.",2
13,,7/14/2018,0,,"Farmingdale, NY",Heidi T.,0,1.0,3,Over rated.  Charged extra for mayo for a burger.   Not worth it. Poor management.Not going back.,
14,,10/27/2017,167,,"Merrick, NY",Corey M.,158,4.0,150,"Yum. I met a friend at the tap room for some food and beer. The tap room has about 40 different beers on tap and a whole lot of cans to choose from too. The food is pretty varied too. My friend chose mahi mahi tacos, which he thought were really nice. I went with a burger. Cooked the way I ordered and very tasty. The fries were good, not great. The only disappointment was the appetizer. We shared the sampler. The mozzarella sticks weren't hot enough so the cheese was still solid and we couldn't tell the difference between the Mac and cheese balls and the fried broccoli bites. The shining star were the jalapeño poppers. Not you typical fries jalapeño. This tastes freshly made, unlike the rest of the items. Next time, I would order them on their own. Definitely worth another try and a chance at another star.",

16,,8/15/2018,205,,"Bellmore, NY",Marc B.,2,5.0,50,"My favorite place in the area for one simple reason MUSSELS!!! The mussels are ridiculously amazing, delicious, fresh and incredible flavors like Buffalo and German!!! Best of all $5 for pig bowl for happy hour!!! Go now!",
17,,7/22/2018,186,,"Bethpage, NY",Alexia S.,10,3.0,51,"*Must Read!!!* Came here for the $5 mussels on Sunday, which is a great deal and they're very good. I also got the carne asada tacos & they were okay, a lot of the steak inside was fatty and not edible but everything else inside the taco was nicely seasoned so I was able to eat them without the steak. My friend got the wings and thought they were pretty dry & I tried them & I would agree but the fries were delicious so it made up for that. The service was horrible. The waitress basically ignored our table & I had to ask multiple times for a glass of water & we waited about 20 minutes before she even came to take our order. She didn't smile once or come to our table at any point asking how the food was or if we needed anything, we constantly had to flag her down. When it came time to pay we ended up not leaving a tip. Regretfully we should of said something to the management about how we didn't like our waitstaff service. She wasn't a pleasant server and what happened afterwards proved that even more. My party had left the resturant and had been discussing something outside a few stores down and ten minutes after we left, out comes our server. She asked what she did wrong not to deserve a tip and I exaplined to her why and she stood there demanding a tip. We gave her $10 and she said ""I will never serve any of you again"". Extremely rude and uncalled for, of course after she got the tip. I was heated so I called the tap room and asked to speak to a manager and the manager came out and apologized about what happened. She agreed the waitresses response was uncalled for, and said that in NY state it's not manditory to tip a waiter/waitress. I've never been to a resturant where I haven't tipped so for my whole party to agree that the service was horrible and to not tip says something. I applaud how the manager handled the situation (she said the waitress didn't normally work there and was just filling in for someone). Me or my party had no plans to return there after the situation, but after speaking to the manager I would go there again. Every other waitress I saw working had a smile on their face and was helping their tables in a timely fashion, so for our waitress to be the way she was explains why we did not have good feedback for her. I'm giving the tap room a three star review mainly for how the manager handled the situation and how yummy the mussels were. I learned from this experience that if I'm not happy with my service, contact a manager before the situation gets out of hand.",
18,,2/28/2018,95,,"Seaford, NY",Sarah C.,2,3.0,7,"Came to the tap room to celebrate a family members birthday. Had a party of about 15. We arrived early on a Wednesday night around 5:30/6. The manager/hostess was extremely rude to us. Saying she couldn't accommodate a party that large or put tables together (or only tables of 4 not all next to each other) and even told us to go down the street to the Good Life not once but TWICE she mentioned it. Not sure why you would turn away the business of 15 people but my family and I felt very disrespected. After my aunt spoke with her, suddenly we were able to get two tables of 8. (that wouldn't have been so hard to start with) everyone ordered appetizers, entrees, (I had the shrimp tacos which were delicious and Bells Hopslam which was also a great beer on tap) and dessert. No complaints about the food, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. They always have a pretty good beer selection. The start of the night really put a bad taste in my mouth about ever coming back with a group of people to sit and eat a meal. I will most likely only visit for a drink at the bar if I don't go to The Good Life first.",
19,18,10/17/2016,127,12,"Wellington, FL",Krista C.,1316,5.0,275,"Came to The Tap Room for the first time to grab some lunch after seeing a few of my yelp friends check in and had a great experience. For starters it was very very hard to decide what to order everything sounded so great. We ended up getting fried pickles, shrimp tacos and a fried fish sandwich. All of which were yum!  The fried fish sandwich was soaked with Blue Point blueberry ale which gave it a little something extra. Of course I had to get dessert, I mean who can resist ordering smores? They were like pop tarts on steroids and come on who doesn't love those. Service was great as well! Always a plus.Although I wasn't drinking this time around I did take a look at their extensive tap menu. They have tons of local craft beers on tap. Even a few from Blue Point,  one of my favorite brewery's. It's so nice that they support local businesses. I'll definitely be back for some beer, grub and football! Next time I'm going for the Mac n cheese burger but only if I have time for a nap afterwards.",21
20,1,10/5/2016,399,2,"Long Island, NY",Steph M.,632,3.0,514,"Was looking for a decent happy hour and decided to wander in to the Tap Room on a warm fall evening. Long Island beers were $4, with a good selection to accompany the great price. It seems like blue point brewery is definitely in cahoots with the Tap Room as they're offering up almost every seasonal beer of theirs. Protip: The Blue Point pumpkin beer is pretty weak this year so if you're feeling seasonal opt for the Greenport leaf pile (My personal favorite fall beer). I attempt to avoid fried food, however the buffalo wings were so perfectly cooked they blow every local place completely out of the water. You hear that, Croxleys and B-dubs? They use quality white meat and comprehensively coat the chicken with sauce. They weren't overfriend, under cooked or chewy -- They were just right. Goldilocks would approve. I consumed so many boneless wings I couldn't finish my dinner, which was equally as delicious. Perhaps my exceptions were low, but this goofy grin that I get when I'm lovin' my food quickly spread across my face. The spicy shrimp tacos were well seasoned and cooked right. The cabbage slaw and the mango in the warm soft taco shells were like a well orchestrated food-tango in my mouth. If I could haven given the chef a high five, I would have. It was Monday night, therefore at 8pm the TVs went on and the volume went up to the Giants game. I have general disdain towards most sports, and sports bars for that matter so it was clearly my cue to make like a baby and head ouuuuuttt...... Unfortunately, service was more spotty than a dalmatian. Either we were being rushed or ignored the entire time. It seemed like there were only two waitresses working the room and doing double duty as hostess.What was most confusing is that we got our check before well before finished our beers, and then our waitress vanished. Eh? Bueller?...Bueller..? Anyone?I'll be back for more food, $4 LI craft beers don't hurt the wallet either :)",5
21,1,4/24/2018,255,1,"New York, NY",Cara B.,932,3.0,382,"I came here a few Thursdays ago for the first time with my fiance. By 8:15 PM it was pretty packed and all the tables were full. We waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated. We were seated in the back section at a two person table. Our waitress took about 15 minutes to come over which was a little irritating since my fiance came for the wing deal and it ends at 10 PM so time was wasting away. When she finally came over we ordered drinks and food that way we wouldn't have to wait again. Both took a decently long time to come out. After about 10 minutes, a runner came over to our table we a dish of wings but there were only 4 or 5 on the plate he put them down in front of my fiance and walked away. About a minute later he came back after my fiance had eaten one already and took the dish back because it was for a different table (I hope he did not bring that to the original table). Finally by 9 PM we got our food but at this point my fiance was a little annoyed because he only had an hour of endless wings. I ordered the strawberry fields salad and the lettuce was pretty wilted. Overall, the wings were okay, the salad was not impressive, and the service stunk. I think I will try this place again because it is in my neighborhood and the atmosphere is good but I will stick to a burger and a cocktail next time.",2

23,2,4/15/2017,169,2,"Long Island, NY",Tran T.,98,3.0,173,"Meh? I was here on a Friday night and it was pretty busy around 7pm. Wait was 30 min and we were sent a text when our table was ready--convenient! Live music plus a Rangers game increased the noise level at a max, but it is a bar so you can't truly complain about it being loud...though we were all screaming over the table to each other and it was exhausting. Craft beer menu is dominated by Blue Point which probably means they might be sponsored by Budweiser in some part. My husband and our friend got the Finback Intertidal and I stuck with a Delerium Tremens. They suspected the lines or glasses weren't clean because the Finback tasted funky. We started with medium wings which were decent and the jalapeño poppers which were beyond lame. They were bland and tasteless; I'm not sure how a cheese stuffed hot pepper achieves this, but it did. Moving on to entrees: my drunken German mussels were as expected...good! I've ordered them before so I knew it would be a safe choice. Husband got the grilled cheese, which he said fell short without the accompanying honey maple syrup. Our friend, who I should mention is a burger critic, ordered the whiskey burger which looked like a haphazard patty and he was not impressed. Food was disappointingly lackluster. Service was friendly, but our waiter joked and said he was here to get us drunk. Sort of funny if you know your audience, but he might be tripping that fine line if he ever ran into the wrong crowd. The verdict is that we probably won't come back to dine based on all of the above factors. However, it does have the appeal for game watching if you want to keep it casual with a mixed crowd.",2

27,,9/11/2018,0,,"North Massapequa, NY",Jen B.,0,1.0,2,Attempted to go there on a Tuesday night for dinner. However when we tried to get a table we were told that there were none available and would have to wait about 30 minutes despite the fact that I could see several empty tables. Figured we would wait. After 45 minutes and a growing amount of empty tables I inquired about getting a seat at one of the tables to which I was told they can't seat anybody because the kitchen needs to catch up and we came at a bad time. Bad time? You mean dinner? Pretty bad when your staff can't handle dinner on a Tuesday when it is not even filled to capacity. After waiting a little over an hour we gave up and told the lady at the front we were leaving. Unbelievably she gives me and my wife an attitude and says she was just about to seat us. Told her we were no longer interested in spending our money there. Never going back to this place. Restaurants like this seem to forget they are not the only place in town to get an overpriced meal.,
28,1,3/4/2017,97,,"Merrick, NY",Joseph T.,40,3.0,1542,The beer selection is mixed between macro and craft options. They do have a lot of taps - approximately three dozen including about a half a dozen options from blue point. They might have an affiliation with blue point considering there is a large blue point mural at the front.Reservations are recommended.,2

30,4,4/23/2016,353,1,"Massapequa Park, NY",Thomas C.,3807,4.0,296,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED          4.5 STARSOne of my flaws as a human being, and an interesting fact about a very uninteresting life, is that, with a few glaring exceptions(Ephesus!!, Greek Street), I seldom patronize the restaurants in walking distance from my home.That may change now.On Saturday, 4/23, I lunched at The Tap Room, a craft beer oriented sports bar which promises good food as well.Today, at least, it delivered on both promises.The interior is sparkling clean, paneled and visually pleasing. The tables are not set too close to each other.I walked into an empty restaurant at 12:00 p.m., which half filled up within an hour. My server, Kim, greeted me politely and urged me to sit anywhere. Since my folks taught me manners, I chose a two seater. It took several minutes to peruse the wonderful craft beer menu which features more than 30 options.I chose a 16 ounce Dogfish IPA ($7.00). I knew before entering the restaurant that I wanted a Three Sausage Platter ($16.00). Regarding the sausage platter, you may choose from five selections. I chose a Guinness Bratwurst, a Veal & Broccoli Rabe and a Boar Cranberry.Three sliced sausages were accompanied by brown bread, olives, potato salad and sauerkraut.The Dogfish IPA arrived promptly. It was cold, refreshing, complex and delicious. The Three Sausage Platter was ""off the charts"" outstanding.Each of the sausages were so good I could not say which one I preferred.All were spiced and filled perfectly, with each of the interior ingredients playing off each other with the effect of creating a sausage tastier than the sum of its parts.Do yourself a favor and order the sausages. It was the best entree I tasted in a week of eating out.The potato salad was also excellent. It was well seasoned and I could taste some chunks of great complementary hard boiled eggs therein.Based upon my first impression, The Tap Room serves great craft beer as well as excellent and reasonably priced food.",6
31,,4/23/2018,2,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ed Z.,0,2.0,47,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while after following their nice beer list on line. Finally got the check it out finding myself out in the Island the other day. What I found is this place is a true under achiever. After being seated at a tiny table for two in the back with a splenid view of the mens room door,  the waitress informed us that four of the great local Long Island beers (Greenport Harbor, Barrier, and Fire Island) that were on the beer list had kicked. Of course it just so happened that we wanted to order three of those after seeing them listed on Beer Menus. What she never did bother to tell us is that other similar beers had replaced them on the list. I only discovered this after checking out the taps on the way out. This was extremely careless and unprofessional. They did have a few Blue Points on the list but I do not do business with ab inbev so we ordered some ""okay"" alternate choices from Cigar City and Stone.We shared the broccolli balls appetizer which was very good but pricey at $9. The bleu burger was not great, I ordered it medium rare and got it medium well and too dry. The boring excuse for a brioche was too dry as well and the pink tomato slice was nearly white in the center. The onion rings tasted like they were processed and frozen from a food service and were served with a completely uninspired ranch dressing on the side.  The cinnamon pretzel dessert which was served with what looked and tasted like a small cup of thin jelly intended for use in a jelly donut was outright bad and not worth anywhere near the absurd $8. price.  The cinnamon pretzels from that corporate chain in the mall completely blow this one away. Four 2nd string beers, one good app, two not so good burgers, and one bad pretzel for $90?  Never again. This place is typical of what has happened since craft beer has crossed over to the general population. A joint like this in business five or ten years ago  would have had 8 taps of Janitor In A Drum along with loaded potato skins, frozen pizza, wings and hot dogs and did just fine with the type of patrons they would typically attract. Now everyone is on the mad rush to cash in on the ""craft"" beer and ""craft food"" thing and many do not have a clue how to treat craft culture with proper care and respect.  That is the exact vibe I got from The Tap Room.",
32,3,1/31/2016,268,3,"Wantagh, NY",Diana M.,554,2.0,231,"I was here last night hoping to check this place out because it's been all over my Yelp feed. It was a busy Saturday night, maybe due to the fact that they had a band playing. It was around 9:30 when my friend and I got to the door. The bouncer was talking to the guy ahead of me saying that they had reached capacity and that his boss was standing right behind the bar and that he couldn't let him in. He then told him ""just go to the door around the back and get in that way"". So the guy left and we were about to walk out too when the bouncer said  ""oh you ladies can come right in"". I was thinking ""score one for the ladies!"" as we walked up to the bar to get some Strongbow. The Strongbow tasted a little funny but I continued to drink it as we waited for one of my friends to arrive with her boyfriend. I got a frantic phone call from her 5 minutes into drinking my cider saying that the bouncer wouldn't let her in. I walked over to the door and told the bouncer that my two friends were here and that I just ordered a drink and we would leave as soon as we were finished if they let my friends in. He refused. So we closed out our tab, placed our quarter-drunk ciders on the bar, and walked out. As we were walking through the door to outside the bouncer proceeded to let in 5 more girls. I was furious. So we walked down the block to The Good Life instead. That's not how you do things. If you're at capacity, you're at capacity, I understand that. But don't go and be specific about who you're letting in to a SPORTS BAR! I was very disappointed.",7

We ordered boneless chicken wings which were dry and burn, jalapeno poppers which was cold and fried pickles which were cut too thick and also cold. I told the waiter about the chicken wings and he took them off the bill. I ordered a basic cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. The burger comes out one side burnt, no lettuce and tomatoes and I got regular fries. At this point I was done. Before I left I told the waiter what had happened and he apologized stating he put the order in wrong. So I left there to go and eat some place else.

We waited at the bar to grab a drink, but before we could even order one, the hostess came up to us and said our seat was ready. We sat down and our waiter, Mike, instantly came over, greeted us, and took our order. He was very attentive and prompt with his service.

They have a really good guacamole chicken wrap and although it's not that healthy I am obsessed with their broccoli cheddar balls oh my god they're to die for.

When my friend went to get a drink, she denied her service but granted service to a guy that walked in 15 minutes later. My friend called her out on this and wondered why there was a discrimination in service. The bartender said that he was ""only having a beer"" and later told her to not come back (after we said it was ridiculous she didn't give us a drink 15 minutes ago).

Updated review",6,,"Massapequa, NY",Danielle M.,0,3.0,56,"Unfortunately, there isn't much consistency with this restaurant, so I am dropping down a star rating...We dined in on Monday night and again the experience was mediocre at best... The place was VERY busy (which is great for them), but I'm not sure if they could handle the volume... The floors and table was sticky (gross), had to ask for utensils multiple times, had to remind the waitress about my son's water at least 3 times... The server I'm sure was probably overwhelmed because it was busy and that possibly shined through her attitude... Not friendly and seemed pretty annoyed with everything.. Again, I will give the benefit of the doubt because it was crowded... The apps came out pretty fast and were good, but that was pretty much the only good thing during this visit.. Service was VERY slow.. The waitress didn't come check in on the table, we had to keep flagging her down until we just started asking other staff members for things.. My salad was pretty terrible, hubs loved his meal, and the couple we were with weren't really crazy about their meal.. Took forever the check where at that point I just wanted to leave...My gripe is the lack of consistency... My husband had gone to lunch there two days prior with his parents and had a great experience.. Even my mother in law liked it and that speaks volume.. My take out salad was great...I really wish this place could keep up with consistent good visits verses the unknown.. I know for sure I will never go there on a Monday night ever again... I'm sure it had to do with football and/or their $5.00 specials... No thanks, I would rather spend more money for a better experience..",1

So when we had to pick a place for dinner last night that wasn't the Outback I thought maybe the Tap Room would be a good choice. I'd been in before for a beer and noticed they are family friendly despite the sports bar atmosphere. We sat toward the back our server came up right away.Their beer selection is awesome,I ordered the Dupont Saison right off the bat and Grandma was debating getting her vodka but decided against it because ""in Florida you can get 2 vodkas for 7 dollaas."" We ordered the disco fries to start, you can't really go wrong with fries  gravy and melted cheese. It was awesome and everything came out on square block boards instead of plates which I found nifty af. We all shared our mains: the fire house burger, mac and cheese burger, short-rib sliders and Caesar salad. Everything came out perfectly cooked. My medium rare burger was in fact medium rare. The short rib was moist. The jam on the fire house burger was fuego. Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the dressing on the Caesar. I felt it was a bit heavier and lacking flavor. We ordered the Guinness churro to end the meal. Such a great move. All through the experience our server was super friendly and sweet and even cracked a few jokes to my grandma and got her to chuckle. Can't wait to come back!",6

Our party of 6 arrived after 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was a 1/3rd full. There were only 2 waitresses around and they seemed to be tending bar as well. We ordered 3 flights and 2 beers and they came relatively quickly which was nice. The flight was such a good value and it was nice to be able to choose whatever we wanted from their extensive beer list (I think there were only 2 on the list you can't choose.) It was $11 and you get 6 5oz pours. I loved it. As for food, we all decided we'd just split a bunch of appetizers. We ordered 2 of the appetizer samplers which had mac and cheese balls, broccoli cheddar balls, mozzarella sticks, and jalapeño poppers. Everything on the platter was delicious. We also ordered bone-in sesame garlic wings that everyone loved and my boneless BBQ wings were okay. They were pretty tough and over fried but they were tolerable. Here's where it takes a turn. We sent back 2 appetizers. The pretzel came out and it was burnt to a crisp. It was hard as rock. We also sent back the bacon candy. It was horrible. For $9 there were 3 pieces of cold greasy bacon with an unrecognizable sauce and it was just awful. We decided to keep the fried pickles but they were under-fried and soggy and pretty unappealing. Service was average at best, but I did feel for the two waitresses who had to do everything without a busboy or backer in sight. I'd come back for a drink or wings but that's about it. I'd rather walk across the street and be able to have dinner and a drink without leaving disappointed.",4

Not the answer I was looking for. I was looking for more like is there anything I can do to make your night more enjoyable. Absolutely nothing.

I was standing grabbing a drink, after waiting 5 minutes, because the bartenders were taking shots behind the bar, a bartender served us (short young girl with blonde hair) She was incredibly rude and began cursing and talking about us because we seemed bothered about waiting. After that she gave the same attitude to two other customers, and walked away cursing and saying extremely rude things about these two young girls. A fight ended up breaking out due to her commentary, which was completely uncalled for and immature. Anyone that works understands there are struggles during a job and things that will get you angry, but as an employee you need to learn to hold your tongue. This bartender refused to hold back her commentary and ended up causing a drink to be thrown. She cursed multiple times and called both the girls, fat after they were walked out.

Updated review",5,,"West Babylon, NY",Stephen E.,5,4.0,29,"Glad to see the owner responds to reviews! Long story short: I have been there two of the last three Sundays and the bartenders there are insanely slow.  And  it isn't  because it's absurdly busy, but because they spend most of their time talking to each other or just staring into space. I don't mind waiting my turn as they go in order, but there's no method to their service.  I hate having to make a hand motion to grab a bartender's attention but that's what's been necessary the last few times I have gone.  Beer selection is good and the food is excellent, but there are plenty of other draft spots that people can go to with good, quick service. Fix the bartending situation, especially during the games.Updated Review: The bartending situation is much better and the same bartenders are extremely great now.

76,,3/13/2016,47,,"Massapequa Park, NY",Shannon P.,1,1.0,58,"We live in MP and really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, we had the worst service I have had in a long time. We were seated and our server Rivienne walked past us about 5-10 times to the large table right behind us. Probably because they were a bigger party. We were sitting for 10 minutes before she came over.  Finally she came over and took our order. We ordered a bunch of apps and a meal and asked if we could have it come out as it was ready as to not have everything on the small table at once.   25 min goes by...we are never asked if we needed a refill. At this point my water was almost empty. I finally got her attention as she walked by us again every 2 min to the take behind us and asked how much longer. She said the kitchen was busy but our order was put in before other people's. Ok fine I can understand the kitchen being busy but not to check in on us ONCE during that whole time? Especially when she was going to the table behind us legit every 2 min. And chatting it up with another table? Finally our food comes - of course all at once. We aren't checked on until we were pretty much finished. My husbands plate fell onto the floor bc the table was so crowded. Our server did not come over to give us another plate. Overall, the food was ok and we would have given another chance but the service was just THAT terrible. We are always on Park eating at different restaurants and thought we could add this to our rotation but I guess not. Also when we left we asked for the owner bc of The bad service but was told he wasn't there.",

Updated review",30,,"Freeport, NY",Alison S.,0,1.0,4,"If I could give zero stars I would. I decided to try this new place in Massapequa park for a friends birthday dinner. First the beers and sodas were flat. Seriously? The place is called the Tap Room! The beer should be the main attraction! Then we waited over an hour for hamburgers. When they finally came to the table, they had obviously been sitting there for some time. The burgers were cold, and the nuns were petrified. And the waitress was absolutely clueless. Do they not train their staff? She should have known what she had on tap or in bottles instead of just handing us the beer menu.James ... Per your request, we were there Saturday June 25th at 7pm",

79,,4/1/2016,25,,"Massapequa Park, NY",Bob C.,2,4.0,51,"First stop at this newly established eatery bar.  It was a Friday night early happy hour still on and the place was busy  My visit found the staff handling the crowd very well and the staff were friendly.  A large selection of beers on tap great to see. My favorites Bass Ale or New Castle were not a choice. I am hoping to see one in future visits;  I opted for what everyone should ask at a bar and that was the Tap Room Burger which I found to be very good and the bun to be abundant but not overwhelming  The fries were good and again the staff attentive.Great to see such a fine establishment back in Massapequa Park.   Additionally the decorating is inviting and a old reclaimed use of wood, multiple flat screens. I wish the owners luck and will return .",

The bacon on it had a great taste but some parts were TOO crispy to the point I thought I cracked my tooth and was unable to bite it and had to eat around it which means I ate it separate from my burger. The buffalo mussels were delicious but barely had any blue cheese, the patchogue location stacks it with blue cheese crumbles. Good selection of craft beers.

I think they need to retrain everyone at this place. They never check on you to see if you need anything and when you need something the waitress is never around! They got my order wrong once (it happens i understand) but I literally had to wait 20mins to actually find the waitress to tell her she was no where to be found! And this isn't the first time I couldn't find the waitress. It's so annoying because the food and atmosphere is good. It's just the staff that sucks. They always seem like they never wanna be there!,

Came for dinner and drinks and couldn't even hear the person sitting next to me.  The first two beers we asked for we were told they were out. Not good when you market your place for its beer on tap.  Ordered the braised bbq beef tacos, had potential but very dry. Chicken sandwiches were also dry. Cool atmosphere but doesn't have much going for it.  Service was below par.  Waitress was MIA most of our meals. Our beers ran dry and took some time to get the check after we asked. Took forever for them to pick up the payment. Has potential but very disappointed. Ps. Please show your bartenders how to pour a proper Guinness.",2

I'm in the business so I understand Long days and having servers/bartenders who aren't necessarily thrilled to be there and are just over their long shift. Thats fine but on multiple occasions I've encountered extremely rude servers and bartenders. I will never return after tonight! The   nasty blonde bartender on tus night rolled her eyes at me and my friends who came in when we ordered drinks, ignored my other friend who waited 15 min for a bottles beer with a fairly empty bar after she helped multiple young attractive men who came in after my friend then when I went to the bar for a drink minutes after she had severed another c customer she claims she called last call...... fine....   never heard that i guess must have been a silent last call but not gonna fight you on it you want to go home I get (keep in mind we tip extremely generously) but where i draw the line  is when 30 min  after you supposedly called last call the less than delightful  bartender will serve another young male and tells me its just a beer when i asked about last call. then continues to fight  me on it and yell dont come back across the room. Lmao tap room hope you like bartenders that yell at your customers to never come back great for business.  Hahahah never in my life have i encountered service like the tap room staff. Guys get your shit together and fire these girls if you want to keep your customers!

93,,2/6/2016,78,,"Patchogue, NY",Rick B.,2,4.0,34,"My fiancé and I wanted to try the new location that opened up so tonight was the night. Great atmosphere and decor. Got there a little after 6pm on a Saturday and the place was packed. We had a 20 minute wait for a table so we went to the bar and managed to find a couple of stools. The beer selection is amazing. A little too heavy on IPA selections in my opinion, but we were able to find enough that we liked to do a beer flight while we waited. More variety of beer styles would be nice. I'd guess half the taps have some sort of IPA coming out of them. Once we were seated, our waitress was attentive and fast. We ordered a couple of appetizers to start. The Thick Cut Bacon was awesome and the Disco Fries were good. There wasn't enough gravy for the disco fries though. Ask for a second cup of gravy. For dinner we ordered the BBQ Shortrib Grilled Cheese and a Bratwurst platter. Both were excellent. There are a lot of options on the menu, so I'm sure we'll be back to try others. One not so minor nitpick- as I mentioned, the place was packed. When we were seated for dinner it was in a back room that I would assume was a dining room. However, right after we were seated a group of 15 (I counted. That's not an exaggeration) people came and proceeded to surround the 4-top next to us. It became so crowded in our corner of the room that these people were practically in our laps. Not the most comfortable way to eat dinner. So- while I said we'd be back... We'd probably choose off hours to come back. Or opt to go someplace where they manage the seating area better.",1

I asked If I could sit until 5pm and Drink and was told no. So I went to the Bar where a bartender took my drink and food order....

It came out fast so I was impressed until I bit into it and it started bleeding.  When I asked to settle up it turned out my drinks were on someone else's tab who I only just met.

When it's busy this places food and service go in the toilet. I've had warm bottled beer, switched to tap beer and that was warm too... You are called the ""tap room"" and your beer situation is not on point ?..Most waiters and bartenders are not friendly and walk right past you. If I have to beg for service I'm not coming back. One bartender put $25 worth of drinks from the guys next to me on my tab. When I asked to have it taken off so I can pay my tab she replied"" you had good service all night, now you have to wait so other people can have good service""..screwing up my bill is not good service and what kind of disrespectful answer is that ? You are a new business but I've seen no improvement.. I also see the ""manager"" always retorts to negative comments.. Instead of responding on Yelp why don't you walk around your business and see if the customers are happy?? I've never been asked "" is everything ok"" ...

I could also see the staff dealing with some difficult guests and they were patient and polite with them. The food was not my favorite. It seemed to be a good menu and concept but it was poorly executed. The sausage platter was a perfect example. The it would have been a wonderful dish but the sausages were grilled after being sliced.they had great flavor but instead of getting a succulent moist sausage I got curled up slices that were dry and chewy. Also, the short rib sliders were not what I had hoped. The meat was somehow dry even though it was drenched in jus. To be honest, I doubt it was short rib also. The texture was different and there was no richness like you would find in short rib. Now that that is said I can go back to what I liked. The ambiance was nice. It wasn't fussy but it was clean and comfortable. I will try this place again. The pros out way the cons and the missteps are easy fixes.",

Updated review",38,,"Massapequa Park, NY",Jackie D.,6,5.0,53,"And once again, I applaud this establishment for thier service. This time, I had Bonnie as my waitress. We were a group of three. I wanted the white sangria but when I tried it, it had too much seltzer in it. Bonnie came right over and went to the bar to put a little more mix in it; it tasted AMAZING. Then about five minutes into our meal, a ramdom group decided to sit at our table. Bonnie came over and asked if I knew them; I said no and told her I was uncomfortable. She addressed the situation to Derek and Bonnie politely asked the group to sit at the bar due to the tables are waitress service only. Derek came over and addressed the situation and was happy to take care of it. Once again, this is the way an establishment should be run. Tap Room, you're going to do so well here in Massapequa Park. I, as well as others, will continue to be loyal patrons because of how amazing your staff is. Thank you! See you Thursday!",

There are plenty of bartenders working when it's busy but quite a few of them look completely lost/ overwhelmed, and spend a lot of time checking their phones or chatting. I've had to wave my hand around to get someone's attention. They could definitely use some more training and supervision. The live music is great (More j haus please!) The food I've had has been fresh and tasty, and fast service even on a crowded night. They definitely got things right in the kitchen. The designer in me wishes the beer menu was a little bit easier to read. Good selection though. Can't wait til the warmer months when they can open up the front. It's really a great looking place. Please please please fix the bar service. The Tap Room is really a great addition to the town.*added note on the food. The drunken mussels are a must try and the chicken quesadillas are a great quick snack. I wasn't a fan of the steak tacos, I think it was the marinade. Fresh lime might have been better. Also, the night we were there there was no hot sauce so the waitress gave us buffalo sauce.",

I own a few places on Long Island and know what its like opening a place of that size.  With that said, I've been here twice in two weeks.  If there was something that was wrong they fixed it rather immediately.  I read a few of the other comments and there rather petty things.  If they have been open for a year or 6 months or even a month maybe I would comment on what these inconsiderate people have wrote.  Everything  from operating hours to staff size, to food portion size, to food prep procedure, to interior decor is always changing with in the first month or two.  I can't say much more besides, thanks for opening a second place.  We need more places like this on the island.  Great employees, great beer selection, great food!!  From the wood work, to the brick, to the tables, to the floors, to the bathrooms, to that beautifully desgined tap system.  You guys nailed it...maybe next location is smithtown??.....I could only pray!!",
