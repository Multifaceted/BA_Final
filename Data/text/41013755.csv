2,S. C.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",1,4,0,2.0,10/28/2018,"The bartender was rude. The bar back was rude. It took five minutes to get served and the bar was maybe 25% full. When I did get a drink it was essentially thrown at me. My food did come out quickly but I wasn't offered any utensils or napkins, maybe because it was an appetizer. It was chicken fingers and they were probably the best part of the whole experience. I'd go here if you don't want a crowded place and don't really mind how you're treated. And the bartender comped a drink for a guy who she didn't even know - trust I heard the convo - because he was Irish like she was.",,,

4,Sophia D.,"Santa Barbara, CA",505,118,183,3.0,7/24/2017,"Nice spot near Central Park with a decently sized location. Unlike other bars I've been to in NYC , it didn't feel claustrophobic. It had a nice little crowd going Sunday around 4pm and still had a lot of seating. Sadly, there isn't any happy hour on Sundays so we ordered 3 well drinks for $8 each. They were decent drinks.We also ordered the sampler which was good for $13.",1,,1

6,Leslie I.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",46,33,15,3.0,7/11/2018,Typical pub food. I had a veggie burger and added grilled onions and Swiss cheese. The burger was great. I asked for onion rings but got fries- bummer. My friend got the pork tenderloin- it was dry and tough. She had a very hard time cutting it with her butter knife they gave her.  Maybe stick to beers and apps for this place.,,,

The kitchen was open so we ordered the Garlic Shrimp appetizer which was really delicious.  Jumbo shrimp rested on top of garlic butter sauce served with garlic bread. A good late night snack. I washed it down with a pint of Guinness and you can't go wrong with a Guinness. Served in the proper Guinness glass, this pub does it right.

10,Crystal M.,"Queens, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/11/2018,"TERRIBLE SERVICE, RUDE EMPLOYEESMe and my two girlfriends went here for a girls night out Sunday, February 11, 2018.  We have been to this place multiple times before and have always had a great experience except for today. When we first got there the waitress whose name on the receipt was ""Bridgy"" came to take our order and everything seemed fine at first. My friend ordered a regular cheeseburger and instead got a pizza burger. It's not a huge mistake but my friend was nice enough to not say anything and eat it anyway. We were there for a total of 3 hours and no lie, my friend must have waited over an hour just to order a DRINK! It was completely impossible to get out waitress to come back to us. She was either in the back of the bar on her phone or talking to the bartender. When we finally got her attention to order more drinks, I had ordered a shot of Absolut and my friend had ordered a shot of Patron. When it arrived at our table, she mixed up the 2 shots, mind you I had been drinking Absolut since we arrived and I did not want to mix two different liquors. My friend drank hers first but didn't notice it wasn't patron. When I took a sip (I mixed it with seltzer) I noticed right away that it wasn't what I wanted. It took another 10 minutes to try and locate our waitress. When our waitress finally showed up, she started chasing the bartender around the bar and outaide of the bar. BOTH of them left the bar unattended to chase snd play with each other. When they decided to get back to work, my third friend who was also with us took it upon herself to get up and go to the bartender to ask for our waitress. He had said that the waitress was ""unavailable"" and asked what the problem was. My friend explained that she had mixed up me and my other friends drinks and that we would like to be compensated for one since it was not drank.  My friend was very nice in explaining what had happened and the bartender at the moment was nice enough to give us 2 extra shots on the house.  The waitress still had not come to the table at all to see how we were. My friend who talked to the bartender went to the bathroom and as she came out she noticed the bartender was talking SHIT about her to the waitress and how my friend complained about the drink mix-up. My friend then asked for the check and when she did, the waitress tried to charge us for the shots that the bartender had claimed were on the house. I also had asked the waitress for separate checks being that what we bought varied drastically in the amounts to be paid. The waitress started mumbling under her breath and said that they don't so separate checks at that hour, mind you when my friends and I had gone before, during the same time there was no issue of getting separate checks. I went to the bartender and asked him what was going on since the waitress kept talking to him. I told him why the waitress was saying she was going to charge us and why she couldn't give separate checks. They both then proceeded to THREATEN me saying ""do you want to be charged for the drinks"" When all I asked for was separate checks. When we got our receipts back from paying, the bartender comes up to our table with the waitress asking if we enjoyed our service. We were all honest and said no, each of us explained why and the bartender got very nasty with us and would not let us speak , he kept cutting us off and he demanded that we tip the waitress!! He walked away and then when I started telling the waitress how terrible we are being treated he then proceeded to kick us out !! In total my friends and I paid 120 dollars to be treated like SHIT and to receive the worst service I ever had in my life!!! And I work in the restaurant industry and always tip 25% however this was completely unacceptable !!!!! It was the worst treatment we have ever received and will not be coming back ever again !! Not all of the servers are bad only these 2 people. Unfortunately I do not know the bartenders name but I will be making a phone call to talk to the owner and to the Better Business Bureau.",4,,
11,Anthony S.,"Chicago, IL",6,22,7,1.0,4/3/2018,"Won't be back...to just put that out there. Not only because there are so many other bars out there, but because the service was terrible. Waitress messed up my order twice and had to come back to me to verify what I wanted when I only asked for a bowl of French onion soup. I didn't send my food back because I'm not that picky, but no cheese and sub fries for a salad isn't that difficult.",1,,
12,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,3.0,4/18/2017,"Stopped in here for a quick drink on the way to a show, we were served quickly but then the waitress disappeared and it was a bit difficult to get our check from the guy behind the bar as it had gotten pretty busy since we had sat down.

Positively my post-Caroline's stop for food and a nite-cap (as was the case once again tonight)!  The food, atmosphere, and music have never disappointed! I love grabbing one of the 2 window tables for great people watching along 8th ave, and catching a breeze on a nice night (like tonight). The food is pub fare and really good especially: Rumours Burger------really good cheddar/mushroom/onion burger!! Also, the cheesesteaks, French dip, potato skins, basically everything we have tried over the years, I think!! Tonight, I went for a dinner special of roast loin of pork which was really nice as well-served with mashed and veggie and onion gravy.  Highly recommend as a repeat-guest! Very consistent, casual, Irish pub.",,,

The bartender that waited on me just came to  the US from Ireland eight weeks ago. He was very polite and attentive and one of the main reasons that I'm giving this place a four. Shortly after I finished my perfectly cooked medium rare burger and fresh steak cut fries my bartenders relief came in. This dude was exactly what you'd expect from a NYC bartender. Rude, to the point and couldn't have cared less about the customer. Luckily I was done and ready to go but I may have stayed for another round if the second bartender wasn't such a tool haha Either way, I'd recommend trying this place out for the burger. Hopefully you'll get the kid from Ireland to wait on you...",,,
18,Shawn B.,"Toms River, NJ",1,89,1,3.0,12/22/2017,Look it is what it is. It's a dive bar. I have worked in the area for 5 years and they still have a lot of the same bar staff which is nice. The bartenders are nice and take care of you. They don't really have anything exciting going on as far as beer selection. The food is standard pub grub and I have tried most of it. My coworkers like the food here especially the burger but I am never that impressed. The only thing I usually eat is the fries which are delicious steak fries lol. I would suggest coming here if you want a relaxed environment and are not expecting great food. The prices are pretty good.,,,

20,Dominique H.,"Queens, NY",0,101,35,2.0,4/21/2017,"Stopped here for lunch and drinks with co workers. I had the Philly cheese steak burger with fries. Please be advised that this is nothing like a Philly cheesesteak it's basically a burger with onions and peppers. There was nothing special about my meal, it was something quick to eat before going back to work. The burger could have used some more flavor. My drinks were definitely overpriced I had a vodka soda and it was $14 and there was barely any vodka which was disappointing. So don't order drinks from here unless you have a special relationship with the bartender.",,,

22,Jennifer P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/11/2018,"Very upset. Rude employees took over this location tonight, is my first time coming to this bar on a Sunday. Usually there on weekdays. The waitress had vibes that just makes you want to stand up and leave the BAR,  but because I have enjoyed this location before I decided to stay. Got my order WRONG, got my drink WRONG! And on top of that got treated poorly and rudely by the bartender and waitress just because I refuse to give tip to a AWFUL SERVICE!, literally got kicked out. Is a nice BAR with great music and great food selection but would not be returning due to them. Only reason why I did not TIP was because I wasn't taken care of 90% of the time I was there. The bartender had the AUDACITY to tell me ""Take care of your waitress"" after asking if there's a problem with our waitress and then, rudely getting kicked out. TO BE HONEST IS NYC THERES BARS ON EVERY BLOCK, I review and Video VLOG bars in the city and trust me you don't need rude employees kicking you out for being honest about the service. I'm only giving it ONE STAR because it needs a RATE, It literally deserves NO STARS what so ever.",1,,

27,Michelle B.,"Queens, NY",97,134,400,1.0,11/16/2016,Went here for St Patrick's Day and was disappointed with the food. Not much flavor and the prices were crazy. $19.95 for Corned beef and cabbage that shouldn't have been more than $15 at the most and my fiancé got a burger for $15 that wasn't great or worth the price.

For a Thursday night in NYC the place wasn't too packed and we were seated right away.The Bloody Mary was fantastic! Happy hour specials were legit and for the price this place is worth the money! We had the French onion soup, French dip and Shepard pie. The soup was fantastic! The French dip was a little dry but using the leftover soup broth made it a winner.

31,Adriana D.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,32,1,1.0,1/7/2017,"prob this review will make me look like a garbage clown but i don't care, here goes (especially since theres similar reviews). walking by, this place was empty on a holiday weekend night, and my instincts said the food would be horrid but my dude loves burgers and sh8 so i consented to this ""rumours"". the sportsball couple who came in right after us got service first cause they were wearing sportsball jerseys, ok fine, or it would have been fine except the waitress didnt put lemon or lime in my glass of club soda, which would have been fine except the food took forever, which would have been fine except my onion soup was so terrible i couldnt even eat it. it was like chicken broth with sliced white onions and some brown sponge cubes under tasteless mozzarella with black pepper. in my mind's eye i became gordon ramsay going ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. so i said listen i dont want to pay for this, its barely onion soup so i cant even eat it so will you take it off the bill. she said she had to ask the manager. meanwhile the chicken wings were flubbery and impotent but i picked through them cuz i was starving. she came back and asked did we want to get something else. only when i looked nonplussed did she agree to taking the soup off the bill. apparently the burger also was so bad my dude only took one bite. so that was frustrating. after that we got 0 service. the waitress served the people next to us multiple times, but ignored us so bad we couldnt ask for the check. we were like stuck there waiting to pay for food we didnt eat. how can i explain what i did next. it is seriously irrational and very out of character. i am the type to throw money at problems to avoid potential awkwardness; i am the type to eat the cost of something rather than raise a stink. i am generous to a fault; i think cheapness is abhorrent. but i was incensed and when i'm worked up i'm a beast of impulsivity. i was like, we shouldnt even have to pay, i feel like ditching. ive never done that before and knew it was irrational and illegal. my dude said no dont do it thats irrational and illegal. then he said he felt really hot and was gonna go outside. i said take my bag with you cause if this waitress keeps ignoring me ima make a run for it. he basically said no bitch and went out. so i sat there alone a few more minutes and then just grabbed my bag and bounced. theyd been ignoring us so long it would surprise me if they noticed we left. but sure enough a few minutes later the waitress ran up on us, got in our face and tried to lasso us with her arms huffing like EXCUSE ME. i was like oh NOW they get attentive. she told me to go back and pay the bill or she'd call the cops etc. mad gay. i pointed out i ate next to no food and got next to no service so why should i pay them. and tried to give her a 20 to buzz off but she said the bill was twice that much then called 911 and gave them our description, it was nottttt heterosexual. my dude was like lets just go back and pay it, its not worth going to jail for. so i said fucking fine and she 'escorted' us back to the shite sportsbar and we yelled at eachother while she printed the check and more waitresses came over to cluck and tsk and join the exciting drama and i said give me back my 20 cuz it was still in her hand and this other waitress gave me the check going NOT TILL YOU TIP AND SIGN THE BILL and i was like fucking fine jesus fuck!!! and she goes SIGN IT!!! and i go YOU DIDNT GIVE ME A FUCKING PEN!!!!!!so she gave me a stupid pen and i wrote stupid six dollars on the stupid 43 dollar bill, effectively paying 50 bucks for a rum and coke two spoonfuls of soup, three chicken wings and a bite of bad burger. cool.",2,1,

Six times exactly, someone in our group had to get up and speak while she was eating HER SNACKS at the bar. The second worst service in my life.

37,Robert C.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",443,814,2702,1.0,12/31/2013,"While we all understand that food issues occur in even the finest establishments from time to time, the reaction that such an issue receives tells much about the quality of management and restaurant operations.A serving of Rumours fries sickened a dining companion - immediately and severely so. The restaurant was contacted about this a few hours later - but no management rep was in last night.The call back today from Kerry confirmed only one serving (the one that sickened the diner) of this dish left the kitchen last night. What was most disturbing was (a) the lack of an apology and (b) the argument that it ""could not have been from our fries"" and ""must have been something eaten earlier in the day"". So badly handled.",13,6,3

I ordered the shrimp quesadilla which on the menu looks like it is $11.95 instead of the $9.95 cheese quesadilla but I was charged $21.90. I really don't think they should've been added together.

But she chose to chit chat with the bartender instead of ask us if we'd like another round.  After being treated like crap and ignored for so long, my brother had to get up again and ask her for the check.  We paid and walked over to another Irish pup a couple blocks away, where we had 2 more rounds of drinks.  The server at the other bar was tipped very well.  That's what happens when you're greeted with a smile and you check on your customers occasionally to see if they'd like another round.  The woman working Saturday should get a clue.  She got a crappy tip and the bar owner lost the sale of 10 - 12 drinks.This was my first and last time at Rumor's.",1,,

Anyways, I enjoyed my time here very much! The food was amazing. I ordered the Rumours Cheeseburger. The burger was well cooked with mushrooms and onions, with the biggest French fries I've ever seen! Plus, it came with coleslaw that filled me up nicely! And my older brother ordered Macaroni and Cheese. We both had beers, and great selections to choose from. I had a Stella Artois and my brother had Guiness. We were greeted by  a lovely waitress and the service was excellent. Also, music was okay. Mainly mainstream music from the radio or something like that. I was hoping for a different outlook on the music but after all it's an Irish pub. No worries.Overall, I highly recommend this place for a nice time with friends and family! :D",,,

First, I love the food at Rumours and could live on the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and fries. Second, each and every person who works there is fantastic (well, the waitresses and bartenders -- probably the kitchen staff too, but I can't confirm).  Honestly, they all are friendly and attentive.  Plus, it's always a clean and comfortable atmosphere and never smells like a gross bar.  And they have a ton of TVs.  I can keep going...  Bottom line: it's seriously an underrated place.",,,

64,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,3.0,11/20/2010,"I came here to grab dinner and drinks with a group of friends after playing a night game of softball in the neighborhood. There was a decent crowd when we arrived around 10:30, but there were a couple of big tables, so getting a table wasn't too hard. The cleanliness left a little to be desired - there was fresh vomit (despite the relatively early hour) right behind where we initially sat, so we moved to another table to get away from the stench. The service was decent enough, although nothing to write home about. Plenty of TVs around, so I had my choice of watching college football or the NBA without having to turn my head or get in better position to watch.As I'd been previously informed, the wings were very solid. I'm not sure if this is how they're usually prepared, but they were definitely spicier and just plain hotter, temperature-wise, than most wings I've had before. But the meat was perfectly cooked - not too tender, but not overcooked. I ordered the shepherd's pie for my main meal on a recommendation as well. The size was good - usually, I'm worried about the pie being too large and getting me absolutely stuffed - but the flavor was definitely wanting. Although there was HP sauce that helped give it a dash on the side, the dish itself wasn't terribly inspiring. It's not gourmet food, so perhaps that's expecting too much.All in all, it was a good experience. The noise level is acceptable, and it's a nice laid-back atmosphere to have a good time, even on a Friday night. I wouldn't mind stopping by again if I was in the neighborhood.",,,

Food was basic, the phrase ""you get what you pay for comes to mind."" The atmosphere was interesting, granted my coworkers and I are not Irish, or anywhere close to it. So definitely different. The music was loud and depressing. So that wasn't too good. Finally, Paula the waitress was very apathetic with her service. 30/70 chance that I'll go back.",1,,

The bartender at Rumours is as nice as can be and is originally from Ireland. (kinda adds some authenticity) He keeps the drinks flowing, and is willing to accommodate your game requests if you ask him nicely. There's even a DJ some nights - music was euro-centric. I shazam'd some new stuff while I was there.If you live in Hell's Kitchen/Midtown west area, and are into sports and beer, this place is worth checking out.

Their beer is not that expensive though, at $6 for a Sam Adams. Else where in the neighborhood this is $8-$10 and more around Time square. A lot of TVs including a big screen in the back.

Music playing while a thurday night nfl game is on, though the music is not horrible (top 40 rock, i.e. Not katy perry or lady gaga.  Bigger place with a huge bar an numerous tables (high and low). Bar top is very traditional, wood with a classic wood rail. Brass pole foot rest and stool that have a thin red padding and wooden seat back. Maybe 20 stools total. Numerous hdtvs, so except for the audio, a great place to watch the game. The bar back is gorgeous. Blue accented bottes and classic woodwork oaround the mirrors (which they should lower) and above.

Oddly a beautiful downstairs where the toilets are.  Great bartender that actually has a bell to ring (though I haven't heard uit ring once and have seen people sitting at the bar cash out.).  Loses a star since the bartender is watched like a hawk (has to approve a beer being given to someone sitting at the bar and standard pours), so it strikes you as a corporate place. At least he doesn't have to swipe my card before handing me a beer or shot.  Crowd is ""upper"" feeling.  The food is above average *recommend the philly steak or french dip).Other reviews nail rumours, very average, not a place that is a destination.",,,

79,Nina P.,"Manhattan, NY",47,278,4,4.0,7/22/2013,"This is your typical Irish pub with standard pub fare. Prices are reasonable. Crowd seems to be mostly older (30-40). I rate this place so highly because of an experience I had here on my cousin's birthday. We were trying to meet up some friends here before going to a lounge in Midtown. However, we'd stopped at Barcelona Bar (which is literally a street away) right before coming here, and she probably had one too many shots...There was no throwing up on the bar, or causing a scene, or screaming wildly, or anything of that sort. She was just flat-out sick and was in the bathroom for 30 minutes. Luckily it wasn't that crowded and they have another restroom downstairs, so we weren't preventing other people from using the restroom. However, I think a lot of bars would have kicked our group of like 7 out immediately, which is pretty understandable. However, the bartender here (Rory - hope he still works there!) was such a sweetheart about the entire thing. He even had the kitchen bring her some plain bread rolls so she could eat something solid. He was super concerned about how she was doing and kept the rest of the group entertained outside while I was taking care of her in the bathroom. She also lost her purse at the bar (with her keys, credit cards, camera, etc!). He grabbed a flashlight and helped us look for it for at least 10 minutes, and the next day he or someone else at the bar contacted her and let her know that someone else had turned it in.I can think of very few bars that have bartenders this nice that would go out of their way to ensure that one of their customers was doing okay. He could have easily asked us to leave immediately and I would have understood, given the state my cousin was in. I'd definitely recommend this bar to anyone wanting a quick drink in the area. Rory and the rest of the people who work at this place are true gems - some of the kindest people in NYC!",,,
80,Hannah E.,"Harwich Port, MA",55,268,57,1.0,8/4/2012,"When you run a pub at a location like Rumours you basically have two choices: you can either be aware that you are surrounded by competition and do your best to make your crappy Irish bar stand out among all the other crappy Irish bars, OR you can be like, ""eff it, 90% of our customers are tourists who will never be back. what do we care if they're miserable as long as we get their money?"" Rumours clearly chose the latter option. We picked this place because we were seeing Harvey at the Roundabout Theater and had about 45 minutes before the show. The outside looked nice, and I really liked the sign. Plus, I don't mind the plasticy Irish bars... they're like Greek diners but Celtic. At first it didn't seem bad. The waitress was pleasant enough and we took a table at the bar. We both ordered the veggie wrap, which has the following description (yes, I went on their website to confirm this): ""Grilled seasonal vegetables with avocado, sundried tomatoes, and avocado."" Ok, ignoring the ridiculous avocado-happy description, it sounded pretty good. Imagine our mutual disappointment when the ""seasonal vegetables"" included about a bushel of asparagus, a few slimy pieces of portabella, and one limp slice of squash. No dressing, no seasoning, and no sundried tomatoes (even though their in the description!). And (nitpicking alert!) considering asparagus and mushrooms are high on the list of ""foods people don't care for,"" I feel like they should be included in the description. The quality of the vegetables made it clear that these wraps are made with the dregs of whatever the vegetable side-dish of the day is. When my friend lifted hers to take a bite, greenish water flowed (not dripped.... flowed) out of the wrap and all over her. I looked at mine, and saw it was practically floating on the plate in the same liquid.Meanwhile, I don't know what we did to offend our waitress. Neither of us complained about the food or anything like that (I mean, not like she came by to check on us or anything.) Maybe she was mad because we only drank water. Maybe she stubbed her toe on the way back from dropping off our plates. Maybe she suddenly realized that I kind of look like her arch nemesis from back in Ireland. I have no idea. She  gave us our food, then vanished. We literally had 10 minutes before the show started and had not seen hide nor hair of her for the last 15 minutes. When she finally came by, I asked for the check (again, not bothering to mention the food or the fact that we had to get out the door), and she practically threw it on our table without a word. We put in our cards and she rudely snapped that they wouldn't split the check. Seriously? When she brought the receipt for me to sign, again she slapped it on the table with furious force. First time in a long time that I've tipped less than 20%. (Ok, by, like 50 cents, but still!)If you're in the area, avoid Rumours at all cost. If you want dinner, there are plenty of places to choose from. And if you're really craving that ""Irish"" pub fare, there are STILL plenty of places to choose from! Rumours should not be one of them.PS: Two wraps came to about $25.",2,1,

It's was within walking distance of our hotel and not too far from Midtown. No doorman or bouncer. It wasn't too busy, just a few other patrons. We seated ourselves - plenty of options and a waitress promptly came by to take our order. We all got some type of mixed drink. One of my friends even asked for a recommendation of something sweet. That drink turned out to taste like rubbing alcohol so yeah I'm sticking to what I know. Anyways drinks came out quickly. The atmosphere was nice - dark and had music but it wasn't so loud that we couldn't talk to each other normally, and also a few TVs showing sports in the background. My vodka soda was strong and we only stayed a little bit for one before hitting the next bar.

On the other hand, it was far from crowded, so you'll actually get decent service and won't risk getting a beer accidentally spilled all over you. I was desperately craving a Bloody Mary -- which was decently strong and a commendable effort, if nothing special -- and the wings -- which are among the best I've had! Seriously, I could write a whole piece on the art of buffalo wings -- how they need to be crispy enough, yet not dry, how the sauce needs to coat them, but not overwhelm... anyway, this place got it just right. Awesome wings! It was a blustery day, so I also ordered some French onion soup, not knowing what to expect, especially at an Irish pub. It was awesome. Strong wine flavor, excellent cheese... My date had a Philly cheese wrap, which he apparently enjoyed as I crunched on his fries -- crispy and excellent. We left warm, full, mildly tipsy, and happy :)",,,

Updated review","This is an update to my previous review. I happened to be in the neighborhood on Thanksgiving night and needed a beer. Since it was freezing and all the other places nearby were closed I decided to stop in. The prominently displayed drink listings behind the bar told me that it was happy hour. I asked for a beer listed on the board and was told arrogantly by the bar woman, ""oh, we're not doing that today"". Um...it's the day and time listed on the big sign behind your bar....So beware the bait and switch here.",,,
91,Jess K.,"Pelham, NY",168,1243,167,3.0,7/6/2009,I went here with friends to grab a drink and to catch up with each other one night after work.  The drinks aren't too expensive (like $5 for a Blue Moon which I am getting used to as standard in this city).  We each only had one drink and sat and talked for a bit after finishing them.  The bar was fairly empty so we didn't feel rushed or anything.  This is a good location for people who work at firms (or whatever) or live in the area but a little off the beaten path otherwise.  I would definitely return here for a drink another time and to try out some pub food.,1,,

93,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",2,19,0,3.0,9/11/2007,"I'm going to break from the (two person) crowd and say that this was a fairly average Irish Pub.  Don't get me wrong; that shouldn't read ""bad.""  Merely unremarkable.In fairness, I was there late-ish on a Tuesday and while I do love sports (which I was able to catch on the many large screen televisions), I didn't feel like the environs was of any particular note.  Perhaps that's what I wanted and perhaps there's a psychology thesis waiting to be written here, but I didn't feel like Rumours had that ineffable energy that draws people like me into its thrall.Let me clarify, if it isn't clear, that this isn't a bad place by any means.  In fact, I could see myself stopping in with some regularity should circumstances permit.  However, there's nothing that struck me as remarkable or especially compelling that should make one go out of their way from any of the many other Irish pubs that one might find in Manhattan.Some may differ and, certainly for those set on checking out bars in Midtown or Irish pubs in the city at large, I think Rumours is worth visiting.  And not just because there was a Fleetwood Mac album of the same name.  I just expected something more and I think my expectations were raised higher than perhaps warranted by my honorable colleagues.",2,,1
94,Elsy B.,"Covina, CA",26,28,3,5.0,5/2/2007,"Oh I love this place. Rumour's was the first bar I visited upon my first trip to New York City.  My friend and I started drinking promptly at eleven in the morning and it was a most enjoyable day. It was very empty when we were in there, which I always love, but started to fill up as the hours passed.  Great beer selection and not half way bad food, keep in mind it is an Irish bar. And the nicest bartender of the year goes to John. He was super friendly, keep us entertained, and even shared his story of getting to meet  Mick Jagger, Neil Young, Bette Midler, Stevie Nicks, and a bunch of big names the night before.  So if you see John tell him the California girls say hello. Or rather ello!",2,,1
95,John S.,"Stanhope, NJ",3,40,0,3.0,1/7/2012,"We went the day 1/2/2012- one day after New Year's Day.  Slow, quiet, plenty of football and soccer on the tv screens.  Friendly and efficient bartendress (no, that's not a real word) from Limerick.  Decent selection of beer on tap (my preference).  A nice quiet afternoon before going to a hockey game, but that's a review for another day.",,,
96,Kathy L.,"Antwerp, OH",0,3,3,4.0,7/19/2014,"Great shepherd's pie, and we enjoyed talking to the Irish waiter. Clean restrooms and great music. Food prices were good, but drinks were expensive.",,,
97,Ika C.,"Dallas, TX",125,36,2,3.0,12/10/2008,"Alas, what can I say. It's an irish bar. Can't expect too much.The night that my friend and I went, about a month ago, there was live music. Ummm dude, turn down the MIC a little, I can't hear a fuckin' thing.We were pretty hungry, so we ordered the combo appetizer platter, which includes the mozza sticks, jalepeno poppers, and hot wings, among other things.Now, when I say hot wings, I mean HOT wings! At least in the opinion of my friend. I thought they were pretty tasty and not THAT hot, but she almost went into cardiac arrest and downed her beer in about 2.5 seconds. It was quite literally one of the funniest moments of our friendship! She thought the hot wings came from the devil, and vows never to eat them again, whereas I think they were pretty good, and I'd have me a piece of that if I was there again.The crowd is pretty middle-aged. Not the best place to meet a guy, if that's what you're looking for. We were approached by a very inebriated gentleman who asked if we were staying for another round, and if we were, he'd join us. I mean, we were PLANNING on staying, but after he came and slobbered everywhere, we decided to take it somewhere else.All in all, it's a fun place. Try the hot wings. My friend dare's you :)",1,1,1
98,Matthew G.,"Queens, NY",1,9,0,2.0,11/9/2009,"The food is pricey, but not bad overall.The  main problem is that the waitresses are rude and unwilling to accommodate, in one instance we had a party of 5 and our waitress was unwilling to split the bill, or even let us pay on separate cards.Good bars are a dime a dozen in Hell's Kitchen, I would recommend you stay away from this place.",,,
99,Bells H.,"San Diego, CA",43,98,0,4.0,12/31/2011,"I like this place especially the lemon drops we all had. It was fun and there was a good atmosphere, Lots of TV's, restrooms clean. Food looked good and pricing seemed fair....really cool touches like behind the bar is amazing.",,,
100,H H.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,227,0,3.0,5/25/2011,"This place falls squarely in the fine, whatever category. Nothing to go out of your way for, but if you happen to be in the neighborhood, and decide that you'd like a beverage, whatever, good enough.  My gin & tonic was, well, a gin & tonic. Standard prices. Happy hour only applies to beer, it seems, and they've got a decent range of choices.  There were lots of middle-aged Irish guys there when I was, which is maybe useful for you, if that's your thing.The most entertaining part of my visit, though, was that there was a Law & Order rerun on one of the TVs (no sound). But then I recognized that the guest star was the dude who plays the evil vampire king of Mississippi on True Blood. And considering the ridiculous explosion in the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies genre, I got to thinking that it'd be kind of awesome if there was Law and Order and Zombies. Or Vampires. (Which might be a bit like Angel, since he was a private investigator and occasionally had run-ins with the cops).  Anyway. Considering that was the take-away from this bar-- musing over how to further dilute the Law and Order brand with ever crappier spinoffs-- that gives a pretty good indication of the bar's ability to wow.",,,
101,Steve M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,200,0,2.0,10/11/2010,"Clean your beer taps.  My Sam Adams Seasonal beer tasted like Spring morning dew - mildew to be precise.  The pipes from keg to tap need to be cleaned once a week.  If not, skunk and funk will override the hops and malt.  Until then, beer-drinkers beware. Order bottles.  Good food but not great.  Appetizers are standard pub fare: wings, rings, and jalepeno poppers.  Entrees include Shephard's pie, Irish beef stew, chicken pot pie and a decent range of burgers.  It's a great place to watch all your sport games.   Many flatscreens and a large projection tv towards the back. No complaints on service.  I will give 3 stars once the draught beer tastes like beer.",1,,
102,Karen D.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,5.0,5/15/2013,"Loved this bar. Friendly staff, great beer selection, I had a cheeseburger which was juicy and cooked as I had ordered. Will definitly be back.",,,
103,Becky R.,"New York, NY",42,136,12,3.0,8/17/2009,"This part of 8th Ave has its fair share of pubs so a stop at Rumours occurs typically just because I happen to be in the area.  And on that side of the street.  The boy & I stopped in for lunch one afternoon and the food was fine.  Oddly enough though it took quite a long time...for soup and salad?  Good thing we started out with some wings.  Those I'd go back for.  Drinks are your ave NYC prices.  Overall nothing special, but I wouldn't be surprised if I end up back there again.  Because I'm in the area of course.",2,1,2
104,Dan R.,"Manhattan, NY",129,2,0,1.0,3/21/2013,Alright bar decent music horrible wait staff may have been a rogue witness but her name was Charlene BAD SERVICE words can't explain,,,
105,Jane E.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/18/2011,"Avoid this place like the plague!!! The bartender needs to be institutionalized. Last night, I went with a few friends and someone else in my party had a dispute over her bill because she was overcharged. The price of her drink was listed but he refused to refund her and became extremely nasty and insulting. To top it off, the bartender THREW a drink at me and another person who had nothing to do with the situation (and we had paid and tipped for our drinks). Unbelievable! Definitely don't go here unless you want to be cheated/dripping in someone else's drink for no reason!",1,,
106,David B.,"Downtown Brooklyn, NY",91,66,10,2.0,1/14/2010,"last night I think the bartender was still drunk from the night before, or just drunk from drinking behind the bar. He wasn't really on top of his game. Food was fine - had 3 drafts and the beer taps seem to be cleaned regularly. my biggest problem was the music. I looked around the place at 7pm on a Wednesday and it was all men in between the ages 30 to 50. but the bar was BLASTING some awful Sirius XM station playing Puddle of Mud type crap. can't you go into an Irish Pub and have a Guinness in peace?",,,
107,Barrett S.,"New York, NY",43,69,0,3.0,10/9/2008,"I agree with Andrew M. There's nothing wrong with Rumours, but there's nothing remarkable about it either. Okay beer selection, okay service. Its big pluses a plethora of TVs and an enormous space that rarely fills up. It's not a bad place to end up at, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.",,,1
108,Ashley T.,"San Francisco, CA",34,83,9,5.0,3/27/2007,"this is one of my favorite local places.  its never too packed, and the bartenders are great.  there's a big screen tv in the back, and tvs scattered throughout to watch any game.",1,,1
