0,Osvaldo N.,"Wayne, NJ",0,16,2,4.0,8/5/2018,"As stated in other reviews, above your typical Holiday Inn We were in the area shopping and wanted to try something different. I found this restaurant on Groupon. The food was fine, good portions although as mentioned earlier, the croutons on the salads were a bit stale. The best part was Annette ,our waitress , who was very pleasant, attentive and accommodative .So if in the area, and with Groupon give it a try..",,,
1,Marco L.,"Cranford, NJ",7,9,2,3.0,5/21/2018,"Price friendly, and average light fare.  Salad lettuce was crisp, tomatoes ripe and we would rate higher, but for the  soggy salad croutons and industrial, packaged dressing.The Sriracha Steak was tender, well-seasoned and served with Tavern Fries. Superb, overall, and we highly recommend.   Penne was a tad over cooked, but can easily be over looked, as the seasoned chicken and perfectly steamed side of broccoli could not have been better. Perhaps specifically requesting pasta al dente would solve the minor setback. Overall, a solid 3.5 Stars.",,,
2,Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",101,313,854,3.0,1/7/2018,"Not a terrible option to eat in if you're staying at this hotel and don't feel like venturing out. Given there aren't a lot of options in Clark, it wouldn't be terrible to eat in one of your nights staying here. Or perhaps a small bite and drink before heading out to town/neighboring towns. They have happy hour specials during the week and even have a little spread out during the week open to guests and visitors during happy hour. I've come for food and was surprised, the appetizers are pretty good for hotel bar food. Each appetizer plate came with good serving size and there were plenty of bar classics on the menu. Easy to order some drinks here as well. I've come for drinks with out of towners visiting and the staff is very friendly and there are plenty of options to choose from. Wine list is pretty decent here as well. Lots of parking, very easy to find parking here.",1,,1
3,Virginia B.,"Manassas, VA",9,185,8,4.0,4/6/2018,"I travel a lot for work, and I have eaten in a lot of hotel restaurants (majority are Marriott properties) and I have to say that this place gets good marks from me.  As for prices, I felt they were very fair for a hotel restaurant.This was not a work trip, so I paid for two of the three dinner meals here myself. I did not eat breakfast here.First meal was at the bar.  I ordered the made to order burger and fries and an iced tea.  My burger was exactly as I ordered it and could not have been happier with my meal (which is why I ordered the same thing again the  next night ;o)Second meal was with a party of 10.  I ordered the same thing and again it was wonderful.  My order was the last to come out, but it was the right temperature and they appeared to give me a LOT of extra bacon for some reason and everyone at the table was jealous.  Ha!  Third meal was at a table by myself.  I ordered the steak just to mix it up a bit.  My steak was cooked perfectly.  The bar was hopping at 8 pm on a weeknight, but my food came out quickly and exactly as I ordered it.  My salad was fresh and the dressing was very good.Service was excellent every time.  Especially with our party of 10 (which included one royal pita in our party who is the princess of princesses when it comes to eating out).There are many chain restaurant choices in every price point within a mile of the hotel, so it's not necessary to eat here.  But if you are tired and don't feel like venturing out, this will work for you.",1,,
4,Brendan C.,"Newark, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,3/3/2018,"Don't care about their customers, will do anything for profit- up price drinks by over 100% within the same hour.If you step out for a bite to eat or for a cigarette they will not let you back in.",1,2,1
5,Eric G.,"Huntington Station, NY",72,73,14,3.0,6/11/2017,"Really good restaurant, for a Holiday Inn. Breakfast buffet in the morning is $12 plus tax. Always eggs, potatoes, a meat and something else (like pancakes or french toast) plus a station where you can get mini-waffles or an omelet. Lunch and dinner, they have good burgers, chicken sandwiches, even the steak is decent. The service can be so-so at times, but this is not a high-end restaurant in a 5-star hotel. If you don't want to leave the hotel to eat at a local Clark NJ restaurant, you'll get a good meal at a decent price at The HUB.",1,,
6,Larry S.,"Frederick, MD",9,69,78,3.0,9/11/2016,"I have been here a few times and unless the food and service are horrible unusual give it a visit or two. If it's mind blowingly great I will review immediately. So let's kick this off with SERVICE:I am in town for business and decided to grab a bite and catch the game. Didn't want to venture out. I sat myself and was approached by Patti. I could tell this was not going to be pleasant by the scowl on her face. Then I asked for water to start, well that went over as well as a screen door on a submarine. She dropped off the water and a menu with out looking at me once. Then when I was ready to order she took (what looks to be locals and regulars who just arrived, by how friendly she was with them all smiles and giggles) three others orders before coming out to my table.   I can't tell you what it was like to place the order with her as she was short and the attitude was ""Oh god do I have to take his order""!The food:Ordered simple BBQ cheddar bacon burger with fries. So the burger was over done and not medium, the bacon was black and burnt. Now I like crispy bacon but this was a bit over what I would consider crispy and more like charcoal to match the burger. Then there was no BBQ sauce on the burger as advertised. At this point a asked for a manager and she came over to address the issues and was displeased that I had issues out of the gate. So for that reason (the manager) and that reason alone, I gave this review 3 stars.",,1,
7,Lora K.,"Westfield, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,4/28/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to go to The Hub at the Holiday Inn in Clark after purchasing a Groupon.  We went on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was fairly empty (maybe 10-12 other patrons).  We were seated at a booth with a TV mounted into the wall with Fox News playing.  We both ordered a beer and a burger.  My Stella glass still had someone's lipstick on it, ew!The wait for our burgers was substantial, especially given the lack of patrons.  Both burgers were ordered medium rare and were delivered well done.  The meat was flavorless and the top of the bun was either slightly toasted or stale, while the bottom was soggy from the meat.  The wait for our check was also lengthy.I would NOT recommend spending any money on this restaurant and was glad I only wasted $16 on a Groupon deal.",3,3,1
8,John M.,"Derry, NH",6,15,208,4.0,4/23/2015,Nice property with interesting bar and restaurant.Very professional staff.Above average for Holiday Inn.,1,,
9,Thomas L.,"Union, NJ",38,196,577,3.0,4/4/2015,"It's quiet. Not too many people eating. Some people are just there to watch TVs that they had. I saw some people drinking and enjoying the basketball game. Waitresses are few and they are very busy, we hardly got any attention. We ordered Appetizer which was firecracker shrimp. it was nice, it had some hot spice sauce.  We had for main course of Taiipia, fries came with it was good since there was no/slight salt on it. and Chicken Parm, both were decent (average). service overall was slow. It was just okay place. Nothing to recommend.",1,,
10,Liz S.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",4,2,0,4.0,4/20/2017,Their food is delicious. I've already tried half the stuff they make and I have not been disappointed yet.,,,
11,Derek L.,"Bridgewater, NJ",1,18,0,4.0,4/27/2016,"Food and service was excellent. We had the salmon blt sandwich and the grilled vegetable sandwich and they were both fantastic. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful, we will definitely be going back!",,,
12,L R.,"Fanwood, NJ",0,20,1,3.0,9/27/2015,"Purchased a Groupon and decided to give it a try.  The bar/dining room decor is nice. Lots of tv's, great for watching sports.Prices average. As others have stated, it's not very crowded and surprisingly, wait time a little long. We enjoyed our meals.We ordered a shrimp appetizer had just enough heat. The hummus & pita appetizer also included celery, carrots, olives and some feta cheese chunks -yummy with a nice presentation. For main courses bacon cheese burger, chicken strips, grilled veggie pesto sandwich and a pizza.  All were tasty.  This place needs a street sign, it might increase business. Restaurant/bar has it's own entrance door. No need to walk-thru the hotel lobby.  Just an idea?",1,,
13,Joyce B.,"Madison, WI",0,15,6,4.0,10/19/2015,"Really surprising find inside of a Holiday Inn - my food was fabulous!  I ordered the skirt steak with sides of roasted red potatoes & green beans w/red peppers, and enjoyed every bite.  The service was somewhat unpolished but not indifferent.  All in all, a great place to stop for dinner.",1,,
14,Tom S.,"Belleville, NJ",12,66,0,2.0,9/8/2015,"I couldn't have been more frustrated. The Holiday Inn's website says ""kids eat free"".  My wife asked the front desk when we checked in and the man at the front desk said to just order an adult entree and the kid's meal will be free.  Sounds great. We get our bill later at dinner and we're charged full price. I raise the issue and the waitress claims she's never heard of that promotion. Fine.  I go to the front desk and there's a woman who also claims she has no idea, but that I should ask the woman behind the bar back in the restaurant. No problem,  not even aggravated yet.  Woman behind the bar says she'll ask the food and beverage manager. Thanks kindly.  Manager says to ask the woman at the front desk. Here is where I got frustrated and explained that I was just there. I follow the manager who grabs a single coupon from behind the front desk where the other woman was standing. ""Did I do something wrong?""  I asked the woman at the front desk.  ""Wha? What? Excuse me??""  she snapped back as if I threatened her.  I explained I wanted to know the rules on the promotion for kids eating free.  She snaps again ""what? You got your bill changed. I have no idea what you want""  I started getting visibly frustrated and another woman came over telling me that ""its OK..""  I'm here all week and no one could explain the rules. I give 2 stars for the decor. Even without the absurd service, the food was lousy and very overpriced. Burgers were chewy. Fries tasted like high school cafeteria.",,2,
15,Jessica H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",205,384,1,4.0,3/2/2013,"I found a certificate for The Hub on restaurant.com and decided to go for dinner and drinks on a Friday night with my boyfriend.  At first we thought it was an appetizers only place because both opentable.com and restaurant.com only display the first page of the menus, but they do have full size entrees.There was another group there to eat and a few people at the bar when we arrived.  My boyfriend ordered the peppercorn blue burger (covered in crumbled blue cheese) and served with fries.  He really enjoyed it (practically inhaled it) and the shoe string fries.  I ordered the steak salad and thought it was pretty good.  The staff were really friendly and attentive.  I also liked the atmosphere here and there were a few tvs for the games.  I'd go back!  (The hotel looks nice and modern too!)",4,,
16,Ann B.,"Cambridge, MA",0,6,2,2.0,3/1/2015,I love the Holiday Inn brand and its always my first choice for overnights when traveling. This location met my expectations with the exception of the onsite restaurant where we decided to have breakfast the morning following our stay. After being told to seat ourselves and waiting 15 minutes without menus we finally left- very disappointing!!,,1,
17,Kei T.,"Cranford, NJ",0,8,0,5.0,3/13/2016,Great food and service.  Remember this is hotel food so youbsho I ld only compare to dinner.  And for that the food is great and the portion  is large with very friendly service.  Ps the place is quite and since I have a 1 yr old this is wonderful and I can sit down for a meal,,,
18,Sherri M.,"Union, NJ",0,28,0,4.0,12/11/2015,"Bought a group on and am glad I did!  Excellent hamburger, great atmosphere and an especially friendly waitress Elizabeth who was very knowledgeable about the menu and had answers to all of our questions.Very satisfied with my experience here.  Will be returning.",1,,
19,Ramona R.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,16,1,4.0,8/12/2014,I too got a gift certificate off of restaurant.com. The restaurant is located inside of the holiday inn hotel. I had the slider appetizer (both buffalo chicken and cheeseburger) and they were great. Also had the cream of vegetable soup and it too was delicious. Finally I had the red velvet cake for dessert and it was great!Overall great experience. Our waitress Annette was an angel! If you have the opportunity to have her as your server consider yourself lucky!,1,,
