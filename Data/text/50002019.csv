0,Chrissy B.,"Queens, NY",16,113,189,4.0,8/29/2018,"I rallied up my coworkers for a birthday brunch based on the great reviews of this place. We were a party of 12 and I made reservations with William; he was super helpful. The day of, we were seated pretty quickly and William made sure that we were all very well accommodated. There were a few off moments like since we were a big party it took a while to get our drinks and we were told that there's one chef in the kitchen. However, our food case out pretty quickly and everyone enjoyed it. I truly liked they start the hour of bottomless mimosas when the last person gets their drink. If I'm in area I'll come back.",,,
1,Ty T.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,15,36,1.0,8/28/2018,"18% Service charge is INCLUDED for every table no matter the number of people that are seated! You are not verbally informed that there's a service charge. There was no service !I should have left when I saw another table leaving without ordering. Service - I was unsure if I was at a school ground for friends to congregate or a place of business. They all seemed to go outside chatting it up and forgetting to place your order or even inform their own waitress that she/he has a table. There's lemonade on the written menu - but no lemonade. We only had 3 orders in total and still I got potatoes instead of grits. There was no spring water.... I can go on!Food & Drinks - Health hazard - the cup with the coffee was chipped. You could use the biscuit as a weapon it was so hard. The salmon cakes were burnt and they offered KETCHUP of all things with the salmon cakes. Needless to say I had to eat it dry. The portions are small. Two dime size biscuits and the salmon cakes are okay in size. The farmer omelette was just ok. Facilities - so I'm not sure what men go to the bathroom for, but for females it primarily to check their make up or to do a quick selfie. Forget that the bathroom ain't clean, the bathroom is dark. The star was only for accommodating moving tables, twice.",5,1,
2,Suz H.,"New York, NY",0,30,2,2.0,8/22/2018,"I finally got there! Sad to report I didn't have a good time. My drink, my main focus, pineapple ginger, mint was just so-so. It just wasn't properly blended all the ginger and mint pieces stayed on top of the ice cubes, in the drink was just pineapple juice. Only a breakfast menu was available even though it was already 12 noon. There's more but I need not go on. We got our two drinks, paid our bill and left. Pout, I really wanted to love the place. 2 stars for Service. He was very apologetic that they were not ready to serve lunch.",2,,
3,Josh F.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,11/18/2018,"Just came here for brunch with my toddler daughter and in-laws. Delicious food, generous portions, attentive service and very kids friendly. Great coffee too! It's hard to find that combination, so I'll definitely be coming back.I recommend the shrimp and grits with the salmon cake. Really hit the spot.Be warned though, it's cash only!",,,
4,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",90,757,5502,4.0,6/2/2018,"Right between my daughter's two graduations and a 2 hour gap... we were just downright hungry. She suggested coming here for a bite to eat since it's right across from City College.We didn't make reservations as we were caught in the middle of excitement, but once in, the Manager? Owner? told us right from the get-go, that we needed to wait a bit and clear a table for us. Excellent. Home Sweet drips with down home food with a little flair. Fast and pleasant service, an interesting Southern but eclectic Menu and a really nice looking design- all made the afternoon stand out. Large wooden counter with chairs and a couple of café tables to your right. Exposed brick wall and lots more seating- on the left with this round, fabric covered seating sofa booth in the back. Brunch Menu was substantial with a good price. My Mom and my husband enjoyed their Croissant Sandwiches with turkey sausages, my daughter managed with a side of Roasted Potatoes as her only vegan option. And my Feta & Spinach Frittata, was very good with a side of Roasted Yams. Before I forget- love how Home Sweet uses fresh Yams and not canned! Our server really kept us in the loop and mentioned- that because there was a larger party before us, Home Sweet needed to service them first. Excellent. I rather hear that- than nothing at all! This is another return for me......if I'm in the area. Lots of pluses here and also liked how Home Sweet explicitly details on their menu and receipt- there's no tipping but a service charge is added! Excellent again. Oh and by the way- Home Sweet doesn't serve Beef or Pork. And just for that and so many other reasons...this place is Rocking!",26,10,20
5,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,484,1951,4.0,5/24/2018,"Solid four stars! This place is a haven for home cooked meals that warm your heart.  The dishes are served very much like the portions your favorite grandma/auntie would give you. Large, piping hot dishes of love that you really shouldn't finish but you do because you don't want to disappoint (millions of gluttons were born this way). The owner can often be found cooking in the back. A warm slice of sweet potato pie is almost always offered as dessert because it's house made and a true delight. If you've lived in Harlem long enough you'd remember that there was an incarnation of this resto on 135th between 7th & 8th Avenues. This pie and this owner cling to ones memory like the food will cling to your heart, in a good way of course.By the way, this is a non-tipping establishment. This didn't stop me from leaving a tip because the hospitality is like nowhere else. Be warned, this is not a place to hop in and out of for a quick meal. If you come here, you're welcome to linger and get comfortable whether at a booth or at the counter. There is a sign that will subtly let you know that fresh pressed/squeezed juice is also made here. Oh the juiciest of oranges and strawberries and sweet bananas and crisp-green kale (!!) can be assuredly found here. Settle in and feed your body. You will surely enjoy all that is to be found here. The decor is rustic, homey and somewhat kitsch-y, but it works.Don't be fooled by the humble, simple decor and feel at home in Home Sweet Harlem.",25,11,30
6,Lex T.,"Queens, NY",120,177,284,1.0,7/22/2018,"Awww... its hurts to write this cause I wanted this place to be good. Maybe it was just my experience or the menu item, or bad timing but I'm kinda one and done, in & out with this place. My friend and I ordered the Chicken & Waffles along with unlimited mimosas/bellinis after an enthusiastic suggestion was made by a manager only to be super disappointed by the outcome. The crazy thing is I had no intentions of getting Chicken & Waffles cause the menu along with other people's food looked pretty descent ... So this place must take the concept of Chicken & Waffles literally cuz I was in fact served only One Piece of Chicken with my waffle... (YES only 1 piece!!) I ain't never been to a spot where I've only gotten ONE Piece of Chicken wit my waffle!?! ... insult to injury, it was some indecipherable part of the chicken; the back maybe? ... and it wasn't even good or flavorful... super greasy and all crisp... Super Super disappointing to say the least. I asked the waiter bout the one piece of chicken after being served, he told me it would be $4 for an extra piece! I'll pass. The waffle? Blah at best. The mimosas & bellinis? Descent at best. The Check? Ridiculous. Not enough heart to give Home Sweet Harlem a second chance...  And ain't it might not be such a bad idea if nevaaaa, never went home again (Gil Scott-Heron voice)",1,6,

8,Aaron W.,"Waxhaw, NC",1,20,63,3.0,8/5/2018,"On my second day in NY, I stopped here because it had some good reviews and it seemed like a cool place! Hahaha I've never been to Harlem before so I wanted to try something here.Right away from entering, I got this hip, 20-something crowd vibe, so this is probably a popular spot for them. The server sat us down but she had to clean the table because it was dirty... she did a few huge swipes with this wet towel and then it dried up. I kind of.... didn't want to see that. I have them the better judgment that someone just left and they didn't have time to clean it up- not a big deal to me!I ordered the home skillet with a salmon cake and a side of sweet potatoes. The food look 40 minutes to get to our table, probably a little longer ban that! Server told us that she never put the order in with the cook so she just ended up taking our orders again. Super unprofessional, I was so disappointed. She brought us out biscuits while we waited again and one of them HAD A HAIR baked into it... I should have just walked out at that point but I was hungry! Food was delicious though, was very hot and tasty. Probably the only reason why I gave them 3 stars and not one.Server insisted she would discount order and only took 2 dollars off. I was fed up, I definitely won't be back.",,,
9,Alex S.,"Dallas, TX",44,20,4,5.0,6/10/2018,"I've had shrimp and grits all over the south. It's a rather wonderful mix of creamy, briny, and succulent. Some places over do it with one part or another. It's a difficult balance to maintain. But not Home Sweet Harlem. It's the perfect plate of shrimp and grits. The balance is only second to that of the most highly trained ninjas. You'd be better off punching your self in the junk than pass up this, of what really can only be described as, sex on a plate.",4,,
10,Anthony R.,"Leander, TX",80,1,2,1.0,10/20/2018,Th oh s vfc is OP laxecis so unprofessional. We waited a whole hour and 30 minutes for our food for one of the waitresses to tell us that our order was never placed! As if she never walked up to our table and asked us for our orders!! Pure TRASHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!,1,,
11,Ariana P.,"Philadelphia, PA",88,35,12,4.0,5/27/2018,"Food was popppiinnn.. Server was kinda stank. I did have a complicated order but it didn't need to set the tone for our service. Minus that, everything that came out of the kitchen looked so good and the food we had taste good as well.",,,
12,Christopher F.,"Pflugerville, TX",110,17,4,1.0,7/19/2018,"Went here based on yelp. Place was empty when I got there. Was given water with no ice. Waitress seemed annoyed to be at work. When inquiring about specials of the day as it specifies to do on their menu the waitress simply said ""no"". When I inquired about whether the sandwiches came with anything again simply ""no"". I wasn't told they had no lemonade until I inquired about it was after ordered and waiting for food to arrive. The sandwich wasn't bad but it was nothing special and didn't even have all the ingredients listed. I didn't inquire as I assumed all I'd get was were out of it since I wasn't informed I wouldn't get what I ordered when I ordered it. Maybe brunch is better but doubt I'll give them another shot after today's poor showing. For the record the guy waiting on everyone else seemed pleasant with those guests and the lady at the register before my shitty waitress came scowling over was pleasant. They also have a tipping included policy which I assume accounts for the waitresses poor attitude",3,,
13,Christina P.,"Bethlehem, PA",69,4,0,2.0,10/7/2018,"Overpriced and gratuity is charged automatically even in takeout. The food itself isn't of the greatest quality either. Ordered the challah toast and the crust was tough and dry. I won't be eating here again. $20 for 4 slices of challah toast, nothing on it, and a small plastic container of pancake syrup.",1,,
14,Sarah Q.,"New York, NY",0,6,3,4.0,9/3/2018,The food was really tasty and our waitress was very nice and attentive. I had the French toast and my daughter had the salmon cakes and chicken. We both loved the food. The only complaint I have is that halfway through my meal I was alerted that they were only going to accept cash. I was unprepared for that. I really didn't have much cash in my account so I planned to pay with a credit card. Then I had to walk over to the next door bodega to the ATM. They took $5 off my bill to compensate for fees but I was still turned off by the inconvenience. I would go back but with cash ;),,,
15,Robert H.,"New Windsor, NY",1,1,1,5.0,9/2/2018,"Great service! The food was bomb! The food tasted fresh and came out in perfect time, the place itself was cozy and welcoming! Definitely can't wait to go back",,,
16,Kristina V.,"New York, NY",61,162,33,5.0,2/9/2018,"The food here is amazing. One Saturday morning we ordered via Seamless bc the Yelp reviews were great. He got the turkey burger with the roasted potatoes and I wanted the fish and grits BUT they MADE you buy an ""optional"" salad with the order for $4. I knew it would go to waste and I didn't want to buy an ""optional"" salad that I was not going to eat that morning so I opted for chicken wings. We get a call from the owner to inform us abt an issue with the order via Seamless. I let her know that I really wanted the fish and grits BUT I think if things were optional, they should be optional. She agreed and while on the phone she fixed the option on Seamless. It was a small mistake with the platform that she was able to fix. She sent over the fish and grits breakfast instead of my wings! I offered to pay the difference and she told em not to worry about it.Okay, so BOOM - excellent customer service. She was so helpful and accommodating. Now, the food:I turn around and he scarfed down that burger and those potatoes SO FAST! He said he couldn't help it bc they were so good. The grits I had were SOOOOOO creamy! The fish was perfect. I was so happy she sent it over. She definitely made me a customer for life. I want to try more items on the menu.",1,1,
17,Miles G.,"Pikesville, MD",0,1,0,5.0,7/8/2018,"Went here with a friend for Sunday brunch. The restaurant was pretty empty, but it had a great vibe: a lot of natural light, excellent decor (old pictures of all over Harlem and NYC), friendly and attentive waitstaff.They have two tiers of brunch items: $15 gets you a basic meal, $23 dollars gets you the meal, a choice between turkey bacon/turkey sausage/salmon cake, a choice of alcoholic beverage (the mimosas are excellent), and a coffee/tea. Certainly worth the extra $8, especially considering they ask you not to tip.I had the fish and grits. The grits were incredible - I would put them up against any grits I've had in the south. The fish (fried cod, I believe) was very good as well. The dish also came with 2 eggs and a mini salad, both of which were perfectly fine. My friend had the frittata with spinach, peppers, onions, and Swiss cheese with a side of yams and salad. She got the salmon cake and raved about it as well.Overall, this place is a gem. Great price for brunch, and a great way to start a perfect New York City day.",1,,
18,Tenisha D.,"Queens, NY",74,51,212,4.0,12/25/2017,"This place was a great choice! My friend Melissa and I stopped by for brunch before looking at apartments to buy. It was rainy and cold out so it was pretty empty. The menu was pretty straightforward they had a $14 option and $20 platter option which included fresh orange juice or mimosas. We chose the latter. I ordered a turkey and cheddar omelette with turkey sausage and grits, it came with a biscuit and a small side salad. It was very tasty. My friend ordered the spinach, onion and garlic frittata with potatoes and turkey bacon. Our server was cool and we spoke to the manager/owner on the way out. It was a nice spot to go to in Harlem with good food. I recommend.",3,,
19,Edgar A.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",1,2,0,1.0,10/25/2018,"So...... as I'm sitting here looking at the price of this bill and the under cooked ""yummy"" challah French toast ice cold turkey bacon and the fresh squeezed orange juice that was handled with bare hands that was served. My stomach is bubbling with the shits. If it wasn't enough that my first clue should have the fact that it is Friday 12noon and the place completely empty and the server with the audacity to complain about how busy it is and how his orders are backed. Smgdh. Pretty funny. Yes... if you're wondering what the cost of this ""dog food"" which is actually a compliment it was $60. Yes. I feel as if an ulcer had a stomach it would have an ulcer and had torn through my stomach lining like the blood of the alien in the movies alien. Yeah that bad. Would not recommend. Also. Any good reviews were probably from friends and family. Do not be deceived. They are liars. Thanks.... I mean... No thanks. Seems that I unfortunately had to give it one star in order to post this.",2,1,

22,June L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,41,60,4.0,2/1/2018,"This is a cozy, sunny spot for brunch! I had the Farmer's Skillet, which was so full and flavorful of sausage, potatoes, peppers, and onions. The roasted potatoes on the side were delicious. Also had the Fish and Grits, which was the best on the menu! The grits are real, so they were creamy and had the perfect bite. The fish was flaky, moist, and well-seasoned. The Salmon Cakes didn't stand out too much. Definitely would like to come back for the griddle cakes next time!",,,1
23,Rajaa N.,"Kansas City, MO",0,3,6,2.0,6/20/2018,"As we entered Home Sweet Harlem we noticed (via a sign) that they were a cash only establishment for the time being due to technological issues, which was not a problem and I went to the corner store at the end of block to retrieve money. Upon returning our experience went downhill from there. My husband was interested in looking at the brunch menu, as many of the reviews have raved about their options and we were wondering if we could get a couple of the items. As soon as he picked up the menu to look at it, Jennifer, our waitress immediately says ""You can't just pick stuff up without asking"" muttered under her breath, but loud enough for me to hear her. It is a common practice for patrons to take a look at a menu while they are waiting to be seated, and mind you it was not busy and were not running out of menus. He returned the menu to its stand.As we were being seated I noticed that Jennifer was wearing a sheer skin tight black dress in which her areolas were completely visible. I do not have a problem with waitresses not wearing a bra or being able to see their nipples through the material, but being able to see your complete areolas through your dress is not appropriate for a ""family friendly"" restaurant. On top of her distracting apparel her attitude left much to be desired. She was rude, and could not or did not want to answer our simple question about the ingredients in one of the dishes. Aside being related to the owner I have no idea how she managed to get a job with her horrid attitude.Our food was decent, but both dishes ordered were missing turkey bacon, we ate it anyways because we did not want to  offend the hostile waitress once more. At the end of the meal we asked if they were out of turkey bacon (a logical conclusion) and she swore up and down it was in deed sprinkled on top of both our dishes. This was not true. My potatoes were either a day old and had been reheated, or had been sitting under the heat lamp for entirely too long as some pieces were really tough. From the time we ordered our food to the time it was delivered to our table it was  about 30-35 min and it took 15 min to get our check. Even then we still had to walk the check up to the bar instead of being taken care of at our table. It was clear that they only had one cook in the back and only two waitresses working that day, an inappropriate amount of servers and cooks for a day. As we walked the check up, the lady (different from our waitress) who was behind the bar making coffee and other assorted drinks was apparently on her break and taking a personal phone call in front of customers rather than going to the back or outside. She refused to acknowledge our presence and we had to wait for our rude waitress to come and close out the bill. A little bit of decency and politeness would have gone a long way to ensure that we would come back again. I understand that waitressing can be hard especially when you are one of two on the floor, but your attitude is what ensures customers have a good experience regardless of what else may be going on. FYI gratuity is included on the bill, and this may be why the service is so piss poor at this establishment.I really wanted to like this place and I am so disappointed.",1,,
24,Rick L.,"Levittown, NY",37,2,2,5.0,8/3/2018,"We came here with our families for brunch and had an amazing time! The brunch menu is really diverse and we've tried a lot of items from it.

My husband was working on the ""Antigone in Ferguson"" performance at the beautiful Harlem Stage, my daughter and I came to see the matinee. My husband had less than two hours before he had to go do the evening show, and so we tried Home Sweet Harlem, which I'd spotted from the M101. Firstly - everyone in the place was so lovely. We came at the very end of brunch (around 5 PM) and had truly delicious salmon cakes, fish and grits, scrambled eggs, biscuits, fresh squeezed orange juice and a pineapple ginger mint drink... SO GOOD. The room is pleasant & spacious, and apparently there's live music sometimes too. We live on the east side, but we will be back! YUM!!",,,

I love French Toast, but I didn't enjoy this one. It was pretty undercooked so I ended up just eating the crust and pushing around the soggy middle. The turkey bacon tasted straight out of the freezer. The mimosa was alright, though. I'm definitely in no hurry to come back.",,,

I came in last Sunday and had another great experience. The place wasn't overcrowded and the music playlist was perfect for a Sunday morning in Harlem. My friend and I chose the unlimited drinks option and our waitress kept the peach bellinis flowing. I wish I remembered her name but her nails were super cute lol.  I ordered the shrimp and grits (which, I'm serious, will make you say AMEN). After trying a few other items on the menu during previous visits, my girlfriends and I agree that the savory items are more flavorful and are a better deal than the sweet breakfast foods. Overall, the service and food was amazing! I'll definitely be back soon!",2,1,1
37,Maria M.,"Manhattan, NY",28,19,26,1.0,2/25/2018,"I did want to give this place a second chance but now reading the reviews from even back to 12 mos ago I know this place probably won't get any better if they haven't improved yet. I think their BIGGEST issue is not having enough staff, they need at least two more waiters and a bus boy. They are very disorganized the waiters aren't assigned to certain tables I was sitting there watching both waiters go all over the place serving every table. We sat for about 25 mins before getting service I had to stop both waiters and tell them we were ready to order, we were there for an hour or more before we even got our food. And they lied to me and told me that ran out of girts. The service here is very frustrating most of the time I was just observing how these only two waiters were attempting to take care of 7 tables and honestly everyone in that place looked very disappointed. I almost felt bad for the one boy he was really trying and being nice and hustling to service everyone. Its really not the waiters fault when management should have staff in place. The only two waiters had 7 tables with parties of 4 or more was also bussing tables. I heard them saying ""were out of glasses"" ppl complaining about not having silver wear when the food was already on their table. Ppl complaining about the wait. It's so sad that's these complaints I witnessed today I see reviews from 6mos to a year ago with the same complaints. I most likely won't go back the food was amazing but I'm not exactly sure it was worth it at all. There's a ton of places in Harlem to eat with better service.Place is a hot ass mess get help! Hire a hostess, hire more waiters, hire a buss boy. So many ppl need jobs!",,,
38,Kelly-Ann S.,"Edenwald, Bronx, NY",15,4,0,2.0,6/17/2018,"Came here for brunch this afternoon. Very cute, chill place however, the service and food definitely needs work. After my party and I (just the 2 of us) seated ourselves, it took someone at least 15 minutes to acknowledge us and take our order. The place was not super busy either. Maybe they were understaffed.  The food was okay. The bananas for my french toast was served in a small Tupperware container. That was a first. The kitchen staff may need more training because both me and my party found bits of paper in our food while we were eating, the wrapping was not properly taken off the waffle or French toast bread before cooking it? It was a weird experience and I made sure to let our waitress know.

42,Brian H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,50,10,4.0,4/27/2018,"I love this place. Home Sweet Harlem feels like one of those restaurants that has been around for years and has stuck to its roots. You can tell that they really stick to traditions, and usually I gear away from restaurants like that, but it just works for this place.It has classic soul foods like mac and cheese and chicken. They have different specials each week, and their food is amazing. If I could, I would order their bbq fried chicken everyday. This place accepts large crowds, but it usually is never crowded itself. The staff is very nice and friendly, and they will cater to your requests. One downside to this restaurant is that they don't have some of the key foods that I love. Their pasta and fried chicken dishes are definitely limited. Also, the prices of the food can sometimes be an issue. Overall I would recommend you visit this place, it is great!",,,
43,Christine K.,"New York, NY",11,27,6,5.0,1/27/2018,"This place does simple food *so well*!  I keep coming back for basic eggs and sautéed spinach (or kale), but I've tasted much of the menu as I frequently bring guests from out of town, land here when meeting a friend, or spring an impromptu date with my hubs.Savory: The shrimp grits is the best I've ever tasted, sautéed spinach/kale is perfectly seasoned (not overly salty, and dynamite with the hot sauce they have on hand). Eggs are made exactly to order (I like them over-medium, which is probably the hardest type to get right), and the different omelette options are probably the most creative flavor-bombs you can find this part of town. The salmon croquettes are *not* to be missed--I never would have ordered these on my own, but I got to taste them recently when a friend ordered them--lucky me!Sweet: Also have tasted others' sweet breakfast/brunch choices; the greek yogurt with fruit or maple syrup is a creamy, tangy option, but the challah french toast really stands alone.  Thick slices have ultra-crunchy crusts, rich succulent fluffy centers.Service pace is leisurely and food is made to order, so this is a perfect place to catch up with a friend, or conduct a working lunch. There is plenty of table space for laptops or notebooks, and the atmosphere is quiet enough that you can easily hear each other.  The friendly staff really rounds out the experience. The manager/owner (?) was so sweet, as was our waitress!  I briefly spoke with the cook on my way out, thanking him for all the good food I've had there over the years, and he was super friendly as well.",,,
44,C. E.,"Manhattan, NY",1,50,34,2.0,5/22/2017,"Review is based on a Sunday brunch and reg breakfast menu. Nice spacious locations and art work on the wall. Waitress was very nice, and mildly attentive, not so much her fault, as she was the only one aside from the owner. I ordered the farmers skillet and was not impressed...with all of the combined ingredients, it still lacked flavor. The turkey bacon was good. My grits were delicious and creamy. I also had a Bellini, had to remind the waitress twice, the drink  was just ok. I also had peppermint tea which was good.My husband ordered the shrimp n grits and didn't care for it.  He also ordered two sunny-side eggs and they somehow came with their shells crumbled in smh.  He didn't like that his grits were layered with a sauce, tomato and onions. He did not complete his meal. He thought the mimosa was ok, and did enjoy the fresh OJ. My dad has griddle cakes and strangely did not enjoy them. He left most of them on his plate. I believe he stated they were very dry. He wasn't a fan of the house coffee but he drank it.This is a spot that you can try at least once, hopefully they will make improvements to their food.",2,,

Updated review","Had a decent brunch here, though our waitress was terrible. I had a frittata (forget the exact name) with grits, and my friend had the Farmer's Skillet with potatoes and an orange juice. I liked hers a little better - the eggs had a better flavor and the potatoes trumped the grits. Overall, the food was tasty and filling. My favorite part was the biscuit!It's too bad about our waiter, who was super inattentive though it wasn't busy. She also didn't tell us it was cash only (that day) until it was time to pay.

I love the vibe in here, it has a very cozy relaxed mom & pop feel although it's actually a pretty big space. My husband was a little disappointed when he realized that the bacon on the menu was turkey bacon, but he loved his ""bacon"" egg and cheese biscuit sandwich with roast potatoes on the side. I ordered the skillet which was really good, it was my first time having a frittata and I'd definitely order it again. The little biscuit that came with my meal was so good I was tempted to order a bag of them to go. We asked for hot sauce and they brought out a little cup of Valentina which means that they have great taste :)The unlimited drinks are $20 for an hour, one person at our table ordered that and the waiter was definitely not stingy with refills. You'll get your money's worth, if not more!Highly recommended neighborhood gem, I'll definitely be back to try their french toast and smoothies.",,,
51,Nicolet D.,"Cupertino, CA",187,32,3,2.0,3/3/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. It wasn't crowded, but there were a handful of other patrons in the restaurant. The table they waitress sat us at was sticky, she wiped it down promptly when we asked her to. She misquoted our meal prices and mixed up how many and which sides we got with our meals, because of this we each got $2 off our check. We got our order of pancakes and french toast after a bit of a wait. The food on its own was delicious. But the food was served without the requested maple syrup and whipped cream. It took about 5 minutes for those to arrive at the table, so by the time we actually started eating the food was already getting a little cold. The only reason this place isn't getting three stars, is because they automatically add a 15% tip, regardless of how big your party is. A 15% tip seemed very generous for the experience we had, and I did not like that they added this tip automatically when waiters, waitress and chefs were gossiping in the restaurant, openly on their phones and not checking in on their customers.",4,,

Our whole breakfast was delicious-eggs, omelettes,  potatoes and coffee. The restaurant is easy to miss from the street and could do with some sprucing up of the front. Some color on the windows, doors, signage and awning would go a long way to making the restaurant more noticeable.

Updated review","The worst all around--food & service. My friend and I arrived around 11am on a Thursday morning. The place was empty save for a woman and her young daughter. The cook/chef was sitting upfront as well as two other women (one apparently the owner, the other, who took our order, said she wasn't a waitress. When we walked in we were told to take any seat except for the booths.  We grabbed some menus & sat.  We sat for awhile before any approached us.  The woman who took our order knew nothing about the menu, she had to keep running in the back to find out things. Then it was determined that we had Sunday brunch menus. (Why were they out in the first place?). I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese on a croissant with a side of turkey sausage and home fries.  (I wanted biscuits but apparently you can only get them on the weekends.)The eggs were not scrambled--it was an omelette.  The cheese was nonexistent. The turkey sausage was like none other I've ever had. It was very, very pale and after I bit into a piece of gristle, I questioned whether or not if it was truly turkey sausage. The potatoes didn't not taste as if they were made recently, they were tough and funny tasting. My friend's food fared no better; she ordered an order of salmon croquettes but only one came . When she asked about it, the chef/cook who was once again up front had to go back and make another. When it came time for the check, that was another issue. Apparently the registers did not work, so the non-waitress had to rewrite our bill that a whole lot of time. By the way, they only accept cash and a service charge is included on all checks even though they don't say how much it is (18%}. The one restroom is unisex. It was clean, however they had a broken bottle of hand soap that had to be picked up and turned over to get some soap, Yuck! I would not go",,,

Updated review","This place has potential. But we had a bad time in here. First we ordered vegetable juices, 5 minutes later the guy comes and tell us there's no kale. We were like okay we'll have it with no kale. 5 minutes after he comes and he is like sorry there's no fruits! Mind you is before 12PM, why aren't you guys stocked with everything you need in order to run an appropriate service. As a business owner you should make sure you have every ingredient in order to provide a good service. My meal was supposed to come with potatoes and It didn't. Personally I wouldn't visit again. And to top it all off!!! We we tried to pay the credit card machine wasn't working and they didn't let us know ahead! Oh nah I'm out",1,,
72,Katherine N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/1/2017,"I have been to Home Sweet Harlem on several occasions, but today's brunch is my last. The service has always been sketchy -- hit or miss. Mostly I tolerated it because the food was good and the restaurant is walking distance from my apartment. However, today was the last straw. The service hasn't improved and the food is no longer good. I ordered my usual and was very disappointed. The biscuit which used to be my favorite part of the meal was lukewarm at best and stale.It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to get to our table. When she finally arrived, she seemed flustered and upset. We were served water with no ice and there were no utensils on the table. When we requested ice, the waitress brought a hunk of ice that could've sunk the Titanic in a big cup. After a couple of attempts to break the ice with my knife, I took the iceberg to the bar and requested chips. The owner was standing there when I made the request and was very disinterested.More about that owner... On one of my previous visits, my friend and I told her that the service could be better. Our server was nice, but things were a bit disorganized. So what did the owner do? She sat down with us and gave us a whole song and dance of excuses. Our reason for talking to her was because we wanted the place to succeed. We didn't want to see it close prematurely due to bad service. That was a total waste of time. There was a large group there celebrating a birthday. As we were leaving, we overheard some of them complaining about menu items that were no longer available. That same waitress who seemed overwhelmed before was there with the group by herself. The owner stood nearby and did not do anything to address the problem or give a hand with the large group. She seems to be disconnected to people. Whatever the owner's issues are, she is in need of a hands-on manager to organize that place.As for me, I'm out. Moving on to places with better service and owners who actively seek to improve the experience at their establishment.P.S. The restaurant only accepts cash now. Interpret that as you will.",1,,

We didn't order anything fancy just brunch stuff like pancakes and french toast. When our food finally arrived it was missing many of the side pieces that we had to reorder.

We also opted for the unlimited bellini/mimosa/mechilada for one hour. It seemed like a good deal (additional $10 with a main entree). The bellini and mechilada were good. The mechilada wasn't quite like what I know it to be (nothing on the rim, less limey) but it wasn't bad. Service for us was a little spotty at first and then Daisy took over. She was amazing. Due to a snafu of some sort (us? waitress?) fish and grits came out instead of shrimp. We were ok with it but Daisy insisted that they at least correct one. Not never but appreciated.

We made the walk over to Home Sweet Harlem just behind City College but were surprised to see virtually no one inside (Thursday around 11 am). Tentatively we crept in and asked for a table.The menu contains a variety of affordable, Southern-inspired dishes; my friend got the Farmer's Skillet ($14) (sans cheese so I could try it) and I ordered the Fish and Grits ($14). The waiter kept coming back to clarify details with our order but we appreciated his honesty.The food came out promptly and we scarfed down the generous portions. The fish was battered nicely and the ingredients in the skillet frittata were fresh and high quality. Grits were thick and well-seasoned (a great compliment coming from a Southern boy!) Yams seemed a little over-caramelized (read: burnt) but were edible.I see that a lot of negative reviews for this place deal with the service.

And hearing a bunch of waiter keep apologizing to every customer for the long wait doesn't make it better... even worse, because instead of going back to work they are standing there and apologizing which makes us wait even longer. I'm not saying it was bad, because the service was still friendly.The brunch is $12 for simply eggs and bread and that kind of things. And if you add a little you can get the $20 menu including a drink. I think both is not cheap and will still make you leaving this place with an empty stomach.Overall it's a nice, cozy place with friendly service and decent food.

I like them better than regular potatoes. I didn't like the skin too much. There were some too chewy for me and i peeled them off.  Some were soft enough to eat. Prefer the farmer skillet over the home skillet. It must be because I'm not use to having shrimp in my eggs. Still good. We ordered the fruit and vege smoothie. Great if you like kale. I don't like kale but i still liked it. I had the fruit smoothie and liked that better. You can taste the yogurt in the smoothie. I'm more fruit over vegetables. Service was awesome.

90,Nella T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,5.0,4/3/2018,"This is my favorite place for breakfast. Never been for any other meals besides breakfast but their menu for lunch and dinner also look great. Reminds me of the good local places you find in New Orleans. Food is good stick to your bones kind of home cooking. You get so much for your money here. Me and my wife always get the egg combos which come with a ton of food and side of griddle cakes for good measure.The biscuits and the sides (yams, grits, etc) are the icing on the cake of a great meal. The people who work here are so nice and always super accommodating to me and my wife even when we bring our 7 month son. I would eat here everyday if I could. Can't recommended it more. Every neighborhood in NYC should be so lucky to have a place like this.",,,
91,Alisa R.,"Manhattan, NY",102,86,0,5.0,1/28/2018,"What wonderful people run this neighborhood eatery.  We had a party of 3 adults and 3 kids between 1 and 2 years of age.  One of our party was having a bad day, and the chef came out from the kitchen: ""What's the matter? I can hear you in the kitchen. Do you want some fruit?"" Then he went and made a special plate of fruit for the kids (which he didn't even charge us for).  Then, about half an hour later, the kid started crying again, well the chef came out again, and he took the kid on a ride through the restaurant!  Then he picked up another kid and bounced him a bit.  At no point did he seem upset or irritated--just loving and kind.  What a gem of a man!  (I should note that they only have 2 high chairs, so if you are looking for a place that can accommodate 3 kids, one will have to sit in a lap.)",,,

I've had the frittata, the yoghurt bowl, turkey bacon and eggs, and the breakfast burrito - my favorite was definitely the frittata. The morning yoghurt bowl is not a lot of food and you are paying quite a fair bit for it - especially compared to what you get in the frittata. I was definitely still hungry after finishing it. The turkey bacon and eggs AND the breakfast burrito is exactly what you would expect. I wasn't widely impressed and craved a little bit more creativity. To get : - frittata To skip:- yoghurt bowl",,,1

99,Laverne W.,"Jersey City, NJ",56,68,118,4.0,7/26/2015,"Worth the trek & patience! Came here for a pre-birthday brunch.  A friend & I wanted to get a bite to eat after church, which is located in the financial district.  Although, I offered a closer dinning option; I thought it can't hurt to see if she was willing to venture beyond our current zip code.  She agreed to go uptown for authentic comfort food.  Now commuting on MTA during the wkn'd can unnerve the most mellowed commuter.  So 2 trains w/transit changes & quarter mile in we arrived.  We were relived to see emptied tables & no massive crowd pouring out the door.  (Yes tad self-centered).  Upon entrance was a little bumpy.  As there was no host/greeter; so we spoke to the 1st pair of eye contact.  Which was a young man behind a counter. We asked ""can we sit anyway?"" The young man suggested a high table, by the window. I declined. Shared there were emptied tables but not cleaned in the main dinning area; which was a little off putting because it was not crowded.   My replied was ""I pointed at a table..."" He responded  ""...was for a party of four. At which point I looked around as there were several emptied tables & there were no other customers bustling at the door. Resigned he got from behind the counter & cleaned a table that seated 2.  Finally seated. Approximately 6-10mins in no one came to our table, no water, flatware or menus.  The one person who worked the area surveillance the area  & appeared to overlook our table; at which point my friend said ""maybe we should say something!""  So we did.  Waitstaff apologized & took our order.   After the ordered was placed, we were informed by the owner, Donna, that they ran out of shrimp to make one of the entrée.  My friend made another selection & Donna offered us complementary Bellinis - this small gesture upscaled the yelp review. Food arrived; it looked & tasted like Grams & Auntie cooked it.  The grits were perfect, eggs fluffy, biscuit soft & firm in the right bites. We later learned our waitstaff, Daisy, is an inspiring RN, Ms. Donna & my friend, Makeba, goes back someways... Home Sweet Harlem merits the Harlem travel for grits & better-late-than-never-mindset customer service.",5,,1

Having a degree in Hospitality Management and working in the industry for 12+ yrs I'm very skeptical of new restaurants especially ""mom and pop"" places but Home Sweet Harlem exceeded my expectations. The chef Khalif was AMAZING. Not only did he make an exceptional meal, he also came out to the table, greeted and talked to me and my guest and told us of the different events the restaurant holds.

On top of that, our water for the table didn't arrive until 15 minutes after sitting, menus didn't reach our hands until an extra five minutes after that and we didn't get to truly put in our order until another 10 minutes after that...

103,Sasha G.,"New York, NY",600,553,333,2.0,8/10/2015,"Review for take-out only:: The Cobb salad to go was NOT good. Not even a little bit. It was Overly watery (from the washing of the lettuce) which was just plain gross, sloppily placed in a to-go container with mostly brown avocado. I took two bites and lost my appetite. $10 completely wasted. Although the lady that was half-assedly making my salad was nice, this place was in complete disarray and just a plain mess! Even if the salad was good the place was such a mess and dirty that I wouldn't dare return. I feel bad because it's obvious this place is family owned and run but cleanliness and timeliness is important in a restaurant, especially one that offers take out and is so close to a college campus!",2,2,
104,S S.,"Bronx, NY",125,221,1657,3.0,7/19/2015,"So this was a pleasant random selection that also plays into my vow to eat my way through a the new eateries in harlem. The location is convenient and unassuming and a clean layout......the staff needs a little work (they're young so I get it), but they make up for their inexperience and slowness with pleasantries and willingness to please. The food was amazing and just the right amount in terms if servings. The quaintness of the restaurant doubled with the owner Donna and some of the cooks coming over and conversing with us as if friends over in her kitchen for a quiet Sunday.Overall I highly recommend Home Sweet Harlem.....as it gives a good down home feeling of my childhood spent in my grandmother's and great grandfather's kitchen picking up the love that is cooking with a southern twist. I would otherwise give 4 but for the young inexperienced servers.",2,1,2

My friend and I waited for at least 15 mins to get someone's attention to get us seated. It was around 2 pm so it was pretty full in there but not packed like other brunch spots. The waitress finally sat us.. then we waited. We tried to get someone's attention to at least get us water and nothing. We gave it more time and tried to be patient 25 mins later without anyone coming to us we decided to just leave, if it is this slow to get water, I can't imagine how long it would take to get our orders taken and get our food.",5,,

110,Jacqueline G.,"New York, NY",66,139,162,2.0,6/6/2015,Disappointing. I read the good reviews and decided to give this place a try. Ordered the challah french toast which wasn't too good. It tasted and looked like it wasn't soaked enough in the batter. Boyfriend had omlette which was luke warm. Server was sweet and friendly but took a few tries before she got our order correct. Cappuccino lacked froth. Nice decor but wouldn't come back because food was mediocre.,2,,
111,Malinda W.,"New York, NY",56,67,78,2.0,3/28/2016,"I wanted to like this place, I really did because the food is DELICIOUS BUT it is so disorganized :( . I've been here twice. The first time was okay...even though we waited about 20-25 minutes for our food in an empty restaurant. The second was not so great. My friend and I went on a Sunday for brunch. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, which wasn't a big deal. We were given a different waitress this time (Short, White girl with glasses). She was very nice, but she did not know much about anything restaurant related.I asked about the wifi since I had read a tip on Yelp and she said she didn't have the code. I asked what was in the Michelada, and she said she didn't know except that it was similar to a Bloody Mary. I then asked if  turkey sausage or chopped up turkey bacon was in the frittata because it just said turkey, and she also did not know. She did go to find out though, but I think waitresses should know the menu. We placed our order at 1:45pm. We both ordered the brunch special (shrimp & grits for my friend, fish & grits for me) with unlimited 1 hour mimosas/bellinis ($10 extra). She came back to check on us at 2:00pm and asked if we needed anything...we needed everything because we weren't served our food or drinks. She came back at 2:06pm to give us our drinks and wrote down our time. It was a bit troubling that she started our time without the food almost 20 mins later and did not indicate when it would be available. I noticed the waitresses and bartender near the bar scrambling to figure out if the drinks prepared were either mimosas or bellinis. One of the waitresses sniffed the glass to be sure. At this moment I am holding my breath because I thought she was going to serve it, but she threw it out (thank goodness). They were so preoccupied with drinks, I started to get annoyed without my food. My friend's mimosa was gone, and she said they ran out of ""pitchers"" (they looked like cream dispensers actually) and she would bring him one as soon as it became available. She also said they were running out glasses...all of this information without filling his glass. SmhAt 2:24pm...39 mins later, (not exaggerating because I actually timed it) our food finally came out. The waitressed asked if we needed anything, and went to go and get ketchup, when she came back she asked if we needed anything else. I stated we needed silverware. They did not place any on our table since seating. She came back with a fork and knife and explained how they were out of napkins.... OKAY?! My friend looks at me and says ""Are they out or she doesn't know where they are?"" . A few moments later she came back with napkins for us...wow. I overhear the other waitress serving the table behind us informing them that they are only accepting cash at the moment, she says they will refund the atm fee...but the bank charges a fee as well.  Our waitress did not tell us anything so when the bill came we handed her our card. She asked if we had cash and we simply said ""No"". Do you know what she did? She made a card transaction! Idk if it was miscommunication on their behalf, but they were definitely able to swipe cards. The food is delicious and well seasoned, but the organization of the place if just terrible .:sigh:. it sucks because I knew when I saw the Black cook with the bonnet that the grits would be phenomenal and they were...just like my grandmothers! Smh, back to making my own.",8,3,1

I googled Breakfast in NY and Home Sweet Harlem was one of the top 5 choices. I based my decision on the menu alone as I knew we both wanted grits. It was easy to find,  great atmosphere, excellent customer service, and most importantly the food was PHENOMENAL. I had the shrimp and grits and he had the fish and grits. Hands down the best we have ever had and we travel frequently and I'm so happy that we stumbled  upon Home Sweet Harlem. I will definitely be back and highly recommend. The coffee was great as well as the bellini mimosa. They offer Breakfast, lunch and diner. I would love to try lunch and diner and most likely will in the near future.

113,Djinou J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,61,26,5.0,6/7/2016,"I had brunch here on my birthday (a Tuesday at 12pm) with a total of 4 people and overall it was a great experience. I chose this place because I go to school nearby and I had class later that day lol. I did not make a reservation because it was a weekday and i figured it would be a quick brunch. When I arrived, I was told there was no brunch option (with champagne), so my party was about to leave and go to a nearby restaurant that offers champagne brunch on weekdays. As we were walking out, the owner actually stopped us and told us that we can do the champagne brunch. It turns out that Mother's Day was a huge business day for them (of course) and they pretty much had very limited options as far as the menu goes. They went above and beyond to please us given the limited menu and that deserves 5 stars. I had the farmer's omelet with catfish, grits, and toast. It was delicious! It sounds like a weird combination but the waitress recommended it and it was great. My friends loved their food as well. We had unlimited mimosas for 1 hour (kind of a bummer but better than nothing). The service was great and the food is all organic btw.  I would definitely go back.",1,,1

My friends were running late--so we arrived early and grabbed a table. The service was great, and we were able to sit and wait until our friends arrived. I ordered the Farmer's Skillet: egg frittata with shrimp, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, bacon--and no cheese for me because I'm lactose intolerant. (It was very easy to inquire about the menu for my dietary needs--and I was really grateful for this.) It was well-seasoned and delicious!My boyfriend got the Challah French Toast--so delicious! I had a bite, and he cleaned off the plate. My friends got frittatas and grits. (I heard that the grits were amazing).I also tried the salmon cake. (An order is 1 cake for $4). I thought I would get more than one when I ordered, but it was crispy, filling, and delicious. For the amount of salmon, I would say it is decently priced.Afterwards, we stuck around and studied on our laptops. Great wifi, and they are open 9 to 9. Great background music. Very chill and relaxing. The whole place has a cozy feel, with fresh flowers on the tables, framed art on the walls. I recommend!",4,1,1

I went around brunch time on a Friday.  I consider myself a French Toast connisueer.  The organic  challah french toast with organic maple syrup was amazing. Great flavor and cooked perfectly. The menu they had was very diverse which definitely makes me want to make another visit VERY SOON. Everything from sandwiches to soups to salads to delicious entrées.  The staff and service was very personable and that is something I value just as much as great food.  The staff made me feel at home .

The owner is a woman of color and their entire staff, from what I've seen, is very diverse. I am shocked that anyone would say that. It is NOT accurate at all. Ok the food is great. It's the only place in the immediate area that has good food. My boyfriend lives on the next block and it's the only place we'll eat without going on the train up/down town. I am a huge fan of the cholla bread french toast. The orange juice and lemonade are both homemade and so great. I ate half of my french toast and my boyfriend finished it because I was full. The owner was sitting nearby and came over and asked if I didn't like it and if I wanted something else. Explained that I loved it but was just very full. It's very quiet in the morning (never been there at night) and it's a great place to just relax. The food takes a little bit to come out but once it does it's super fresh and delicious.

I was able to get the potatoes substituted with toast and the sausage substituted with a fruit cup. My friend got the egg and cheese croissant and was very happy with it. The salmon cakes were also received positively. Ambience is overall enjoyable and chill. The music was generally Top 40 from about 5 years ago. My friend and I ordered micheladas and they actually came out a few minutes after we received our meal, which we were not happy about. Generally drinks are nice to have before the meal arrives.

125,Jessica M.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",0,6,0,5.0,3/30/2018,"If real home cooking is your thing, this is your place.  The food is all home cooking (by Donna, the owner) and utterly delicious. We stopped in for breakfast, and both ended up ordering the Home Skillet, which gives new meaning to mouth watering.  Home cooking takes a little longer, so if you are in a rush or the impatient type, save this place for when you have time. Be prepared to linger over your meal. Everything here, however, is worth the wait.  Before ordering, we were served water automatically, and offered a cup of good, hot coffee, which arrived at the table along with ketchup and hot sauce for our meal, served elegantly in small cups.  Our dishes came with a choice of two kinds of roasted potatoes (herbed russets or yams), or 4 kinds of grits, and a small green salad, and homemade biscuit.  I ordered the yams, and by accident ended up with both potato varieties, both of which turned out to be melt in your mouth wonderful.  My other half ordered the grits and gravy, which he pronounced lip smacking.  The ambiance in the restaurant is charming and warm, made warmer for us by the happy advent of an extended conversation with the owner.  There is live music on several evenings, and a ladies night in their schedule.  We loved the whole thing, and plan to come back for other things, and check out the dinner menu!",,,

Throughout our meal, the waitress was inattentive, rude, and uncaring.Food-wise, the omelette/frittata was delicious. The yams weren't fully cooked, biscuits and crab cakes were so-so.

131,Rachel F.,"Seattle, WA",39,20,0,5.0,5/23/2016,"I visited this restaurant on a recent rip to NYC with my travel companion. It was our last meal before we were bound for JFK Airport. Surprisingly, this was one of the few brunch places that was open at 10am on a Sunday morning. LUCKY US! The restaurant was homely decorated and on a Sunday morning was staffed by one waitress and one cook. We ordered the farmers skillet and french toast challah (with greek yogurt) to share along with two coffees. The food was decently priced and sized and the food tasted wonderful. They even added hot frothy milk to the coffee, which truly upped the taste. So glad our last meal in NYC happened to be here and we will be sure to return when we are back in town!",,,

I feel like I'm visiting relatives on a warm summer's day, cool fall night, or holiday gathering! The chef is amazing and Sade the waitress is awesome! Brunch is especially great, getting an hour of unlimited Mimosas or Bellini's for an extra $10.00!This is a must visit, stay, eat, laugh & enjoy!!!",,,
133,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,2.0,8/20/2014,"Went on a Saturday for Brunch.Atmosphere: Simple and inviting. Crowd was mostly people in their 20s. Service: It took the waiter over 5 minutes to come talk to us. The food took a while to come and the place wasn't even busy. We also didn't get water till after being there for 10 minutes and our coffee came at the same time as our food.  We had to ask our waiter to bring us ketchup and salt for our food and sugar and milk for our coffee. I understand the ketchup, but bringing sugar for the coffee should be common sense. What made it even worse is that he took the sugar from the table next to us and the people were still eating. One of the ladies from that table later asked for sugar for her coffee and the waiter then took the sugar from our table and gave it back to the other table. Do they only have one sugar container? The waiter wasn't rude but just slow and maybe a little lost.Food: We had the frittata and the griddle cakes. The food was really good and flavorful. No complaints here. If I had to rate just the food they would get 4 stars but the service brought it down to 2.Overall this place has potential as long as they train their staff.",6,1,1

Definitely a nice calm family or friend get together spot - not for the turn up. Had the turkey and cheese omelette.,,,

Updated review","I have recently visited this location again as i have been many times before even celebrated a birthday here. However things have changed Daisy isn't there anymore (Sad). My waitress was not so pleasant and had a bit lack luster service. She spent more time just looking around instead of serving and keeping up with her tables. We ordered unlimited mimosas and if it weren't for the only delightful person that day Mavelin we would've probably only got 1 or 2 refills. When she seen we were in need of anything she gracefully came from the bar to assist us as our waitress was no where around for 15 min at a time. Mavelin was such a delight that she was the only reason that made our experience positive great energy,great service and great conversation. The unfortunate pat was after our meal and drinks was completely done our original waitress decided to come over and explain that she had a long day or she would've been better.... someone teach Jennifer that in the service business the ""The Time is Now"" not next time. As we were wrapping up we could see and hear the bus boy and waitress cursing and yelling at Mavelin instead of focusing on the guests like professionals. Four stars just for Mavelin and the food!",,,
137,Candra B.,"Gibsonville, NC",0,4,2,5.0,3/20/2017,The food was absolutely delish...I went on a Sunday for brunch and got one complimentary Bellini. My server was really nice and made a great suggestion. I had the home skillet with grits and salmon patty. It was plenty of food. They also have bottomless mimosas and bellinis but I didn't have time to stay and enjoy.,,,

139,Jeffrey L.,"New Rochelle, NY",3,11,11,2.0,9/27/2015,"Terrible service, was extremely slow amd they forgot part of our order. This might be excused if the place was busy, but it was practically empty. The food was extremely over priced.  Something like 9 dollars for a side of bacon, and it came with 2 slices!!! The food was mediocre, not even close to make up for the issues listed above. I live in the area and was excited for a place like this to pop up. This pisses me off everytime i pass the block. It could be so much better.",3,1,
140,Brittani R.,"Largo, FL",196,1,0,5.0,3/17/2018,"Omg....where do is START! This place is absolutely incredible! From the food, to the service, to the Vibe. I came here not knowing what to expect. I was visiting Harlem, staying in an Airbnb, debating on whether or not I wanted to move to the area. I found the restaurant on yelp and the reviews were good. So decided to go for brunch. The staff was overwhelmingly gracious and welcoming. It was an unexpectedly amazing way to start my morning. The owner literally personally grilled me up the best shrimp and grits to ever grace my taste buds!!! I'm talking overwhelmingly delicious. I was eating alone and she witnessed my enthusiasm while eating the food, and asked to join me for a few minutes. Now, me not being from the area and thinking of moving to the area was completely enthused at the fact that owner of this establishment with such excellent food wanted to sit with me and chat me up over her cooking. She joined and I got to know her a bit. And what a GEM! She is super passionate about her business and the impact that she wants to have with her clientele. Her passion was inspiring. I decided in that moment that Harlem was the place for me!! Thank you Home Sweet Harlem for keeping the true spirit of Harlem and hospitality alive in your establishment. I suggest that anyone in the area who wants to have some good home cooking at amazing prices to come here. You won't regret it!!!!",,,

I can't speak to lunch or dinner, but the menu looked tasty, so I would definitely give it a go.Good sized portions at an affordable price - I got a croissant with egg and cheese (?) although I didn't see any cheese at all. The croissant was still flaky and good, and didn't make you feel totally crappy after eating it.We also got the salmon cakes, which were just okay. The salmon definitely tasted like canned fish, which is sort of what I was expecting, but was hoping I was wrong.The coffee is fairly good and comes with refills. If you order the fruit bowl, you won't be disappointed - really large portions compared to what you would expect!A fairly solid brunch option in Harlem.",4,1,1
146,Val A.,"Morristown, NJ",2,1,0,1.0,4/8/2017,"Service is slooow on a packed Saturday brunch day. 15 min to get coffee. Another 45 min to get food. I ordered a Farmer's Skillet that was dried up and over salted (and isn't it supposed to be served in a skillet?). The salad was old and limp. My boyfriend ordered the muesli, not warm like we expected, but COLD! Dry oats in a bowl with fruits took 45 min to make? Menu doesn't even specify that it's not cooked. Anything with oatmeal, people will assume is hot. And we weren't given a disclaimer by the server. The waitress (owner?) was unapologetic and made it seem like we were in the wrong, pushing us to order something else when the meal should've been comped after making us wait for so long. Also, the waiter never followed through on getting me ketchup and hot sauce. Furthermore, the same waitress asked us if were leaving when we just got in. Like, you don't even know your own customers? Not even that huge of a restaurant. The bathroom is disgusting and if it was in that state I don't even want to see the kitchen!",3,,
147,Hil S.,"New York, NY",258,15,6,4.0,8/4/2015,"This lovely breakfast/brunch place is a delight! The atmosphere is very classic and homey--just like grammy's house with a little bit of funk. The coffee wasn't great... Although decent as far as espressos go. The food--wowza! No flashiness but darn tasty. If you're looking for a cute spot to take your family, definitely check this out! The prices for the area are unreal. $6 for an amazing, filling breakfast burrito. As I write I just took a sip of the green juice and it is...  Incredible!!! The service was a little here and there at first but the staff was just so darn friendly that none of our party minded. It sounded like unusual circumstances let to this--the waiter even discounted our meal because of the wait on the juices! Bottom line: if you're not in a huge rush and you're a little patient, you can get an incredible meal in a great atmosphere for an even better price.",2,2,2

149,Kelley J.,"New Rochelle, NY",4,12,12,4.0,9/18/2014,I came on a Thursday afternoon and it was empty except for one other girl drinking a beer by the door. I walked straight to the counter and looked at the menu. I got the half salad and half sandwich and was directed to sit anywhere I wanted. I was brought utensils and water immediately which was efficient. My food came quickly and it was surprisingly pretty good. I wouldn't say it was the freshest lettuce I've ever had in a salad but it was definitely good. The Caesar dressing wasn't over powering and the turkey wasn't dry. It was good for what it was. I would come back again for the quiet atmosphere which is nice to study since it is right across the street from City College. There is also free wifi and the waiter provided me with the password before I even asked.,1,,

151,Simon P.,"New York, NY",103,182,37,5.0,3/8/2014,"Compadres wanted to try a new brunch spot so we trekked half a mile from our friend's apartment to come here. The walk up the hill was more physical activity than should ever be allowed on a Saturday morning but Home Sweet Harlem's comfy interior, great music and smiling faces made it all better. I believe we were waited on by the owner who was a joy! Friendly, provided great, honest recommendations and kindly answered all of our questions about the menu. The rest of the staff were great too. I can't say enough about the service. Attentive without being intrusive if that makes sense?Their $12 brunch menu gets you coffee or tea and an entree. Coffee was a tad heavy on the grinds but fresh and good quality beans made up for it. And I was happy to have little pitchers of steamed milk offered to us instead of cream. Take one look at the menu and you can see this place prides themselves on healthy, fresh, quality ingredients. My sausage egg biscuit was delicious with a side of sweet potatoes. Biscuit tasted perfectly light and buttery and even my turkey sausage (which I'm typically not a fan of) was tasty.Initially I thought my gripe was I'd have liked more in the way of portion size. But hours later when I didn't feel bloated and sleepy, I appreciated not starting my day with a greasy, food-coma inducing meal. The place wasn't packed so the friends and I stuck around after our meal chatting and the staff didn't rush us out at all. True to its name, this place has a homey feel. I asked my friends what they would rate this place and most of them agreed 5-stars. A few of them disagreed and felt it wasn't a great value because of the small portions. But I thought about it and when I considered the ingredients, the service and the environment, this place definitely provided me with a 5-star experience. Probably won't have the opportunity to return anytime soon, but I definitely hope to be back!",3,1,1

The staff was incredibly nice and they were very attentive to things like bringing out more water, clearing plates very quickly, etc. Honestly, the place didn't make much of an impression, and I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but if I found myself in need of breakfast in the area, I'd go back.",,,

158,Christopher J.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,21,253,4.0,6/5/2016,"So this is probably my first review ever so here it goes.After trenching through the hill and steps of the park coming from the 135 C train station after work (Cipriani), first thing I thought was I need that Bellini now. So I get to Amsterdam and see the huge awning ""Home Sweet Harlem."" I get to the front door and I take one step in and everyone who was working there welcomed me like I literally came home to a good wife lol. So let's start talking about the consumption of foods. I started with sitting at the bar. The music though had me feeling nostalgic. I mean it was like being back in the New Jack Swing era. So I ordered the Bellini (they use a mango nectar and I forgot the champagne they use) and it was wonderful. I believe the person who served me said his name is Ben Frankenstein lol idk if he was telling the truth or not but he was funny and knowledgable of all types of Bellinis, mimosas, wines and beers (wish they had a full bar). I ordered the griddle cakes and maaaaaaaan let me tell you. Something good happened, patience came over me and said ""dress these babies up well."" Moist in the center, caramelized crunchy goodness on the outside...and they serve it with real maple syrup. So after I cleared that plate, my friend shows up finally and orders the fish and grits with a crab cake. Yoooooo it was wonderfully seasoned......everything maintained its natural flavor without being over powered by extra added seasonings. I got hungry again and ordered the cheese and fruit plate. Now I'm not gonna lie, you can't serve me like 7 cheeses and one slice of toast (different server at this time since Ben had to run some errands). Ben eventually came back and I asked him if I can have some more bread, homie gave me two slices of whole wheat toast and just thought, ""my man Sideshow Dynamite hooked me up"" (you'll get it when you visit the place). So yeah I'm definitely going back.",2,2,1

So two thumbs up for being family friendly while still preserving the ambiance of the restaurant! I took off one star because the service was a little slow and inconsistent, but the food itself was delicious. I highly recommend the shrimp and grits. If I am in the neighborhood during breakfast/brunch hours I would definitely stop in again.",,,

181,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,1.0,1/13/2015,"I waited a long time to write this review, because I wanted to make sure I calmed down enough to write fairly.My boyfriend and I stopped in at Home Sweet Harlem, hoping to have a late breakfast. Yelp reviews were stellar, and there were a couple full tables, so we were looking forward to a solid, comforting meal. Here is how our experience played out:- We walked in and no one greeted us. The three employees milling about behind the bar argued with each other over who would seat us. - Finally, one guy got up (he had been sitting down near the kitchen, playing with his hair) and brought us to a table. Someone else then dropped off menus and glasses of water.- We asked some questions about dishes on the menu. The waiter knew nothing, and had to go to the kitchen to ask about each inquiry.- We placed our orders. I ordered a sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered some sort of breakfast item. The waiter took our menus and left.- After several minutes, we overheard two employees arguing about who should tell us that they can't make one of our dishes. Our waiter finally, awkwardly, came over to tell us that they didn't have the ingredients for one of our meals.- Fed up with the horrible service we had received since walking in, we left, and wandered home hungry.How on earth does this place have such a good review on Yelp? I don't understand. I've never encountered such inept service at a restaurant in all my years of dining out in New York. Never. It was rude, uncaring, and oblivious. I will not return.",5,,
182,Jessica S.,"Washington, DC",187,15,137,4.0,7/19/2015,"Awesome place for brunch! It was my first time here and our waitress was awesome. I'm an avid foodie and Evens (our waiter) was able to answer all my questions efficiently and politely. Food was awesome.  I had the sundried tomato, basil, mozzarella omelette with salmon cake and mimosa. It was awesome. I highly recommend this spot for brunch and ask for Eyvens to be your waiter. Stand u guy!!",,,

Friend ordered the shrimp and grits which she liked and i got the croissant sandwich, which was good. Lots of organic options and worth going to.",,,
184,carlie m.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,5/15/2017,Why did I not know about this place sooner??? Went for brunch...The food...amazing!! The service... amazing!! This place offers beautifully prepared food that is fresh and delicious. Kudos to Kalif the chef and his associate whose name I can't remember and our server Daisy who was always right there when giving us free wine and Bellini refills! Going back for Thursday night karaoke! This is a true neighborhood gem and people should definitely go there and see for yourself.,,,
185,Kelly W.,"Daly City, CA",156,19,0,5.0,6/6/2015,"Our server, Donna, was just the sweetest lady ever. She made sure we had everything we needed and just made this such a beautiful dining experience. The food was just amazing. Grits are extremely creamy and delectable. The biscuits were buttery and flaky. The omelette was fresh and was made with high quality ingredients. I also ordered the fruit smoothie which was SO GOOD. So many textures and flavors. Overall, it's safe to say that this is one of the best places I've eaten at during my stay in New York. Definitely a must have!",,,

187,Lisa M.,"Dorchester Center, Boston, MA",15,1,0,4.0,5/12/2017,"If you're looking for a cheap, decent sized meal this place is great. Cosy restaurant and great comfort food after a big day of exploring the city. Waiter was lovely as well.",,,
188,Brittney H.,"Bronx, NY",1,2,0,5.0,8/28/2016,"Another hidden gem with amazing food and a great atmosphere, nice and cozy for a Sunday brunch. Music not to loud, you can actual hear the person across from you & the unlimited brunch is very reasonable. Will most definitely come back!",,,
189,Nevena R.,"Manhattan, NY",35,129,2,4.0,4/26/2016,"I liked it, but I didn't love it. The place is very quaint, and the waitresses are really nice. Between my friend and I, we got two different frittatas with grits and potatoes. I really liked the rosemary potatoes and her sundried tomato frittata. The grits were okay. The orange juice is to die for. I messed up my order (accidentally said to add mushrooms when I meant to say peppers), and they were nice about changing it.",,,
190,Chelsey J.,"New York, NY",254,14,0,4.0,3/6/2016,"I went around 1:45 on a Sunday afternoon and had no wait. While the wait staff was packing, the food is great and the price is even better. They offer a prix fixe menu for 20 dollars that includes either French toast, pancakes, or a frittata with a side of potatoes or grits and your choice of turkey bacon, turkey sausage, and a salmon cake. The price also includes your choice of a mimosa, Bellini, michelada or fresh squeezed orange juice. You can't beat a price like that in the city- especially considering the quality of the food. Will definitely be coming back",1,,
191,Shanna B.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,44,5,4.0,4/30/2016,"Very, very good food. I'd actually rate it at a 4.5 came in early on a Saturday morning, there were only 3 other tables occupied. We were warmly greyed and seated by our server. French toast and Frittata were delicious! Freshly squeezed OJ was wonderful. All the food tasted fresh. I loved the ambiance with unique art, fresh flowers on the table, a nice mix of R&B playing overhead. Easy to access by train... What more can you ask for?",,,
192,Natalia G.,"Dorchester Center, Boston, MA",0,10,1,5.0,4/24/2017,"Went here for breakfast while I was visiting NY and it was really good. The French toast was delicious, especially with whipped cream. I also got potatoes and eggs; the portions were bigger than I expected. It's $4 per side which is a little pricey but seeing as how it's a small business I didn't mind. Went at about 10-11am Saturday morning and I was seated as soon as I walked in, however it did start to fill up after that. The atmosphere was really nice for a calm Saturday morning. If I ever went back to Harlem I would definitely visit here again.",,,
193,Erica B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0,5.0,4/22/2017,"The food is delicious, the drinks are flowing and the team is so welcoming. I come for frittatas, yes, but I leave with a smile because of Jennifer and Daisy. See you every weekend, Home Sweet Harlem.",,,
