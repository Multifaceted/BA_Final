0,Stacy K.,"Oceanside, NY",288,181,186,4.0,9/23/2018,"Fun in the heart of NYC, Planet Hollywood is a trendy location for food, drinks and nostalgia. It is September 23rd and they have added a Halloween theme to the mix. Ghosts and goblins decorate the already happening  restaurant filled with memorabilia, tv screens of show clips, and videos and of course a gift shop. The food was fun, apps and comfort foods. We had nachos, skins, tostitos, fajitas, burgers, pizza, turkey blt, and salad, in our group of 10. Food was fresh and delicious.  Definitely fun and a hot spot in nyc.",,,
1,Shannon D.,"Gainesville, VA",3,5,1,1.0,11/6/2018,"The food was OK and the waitress was friendly but the service was unbelievably slow. We had a sight seeing pass that provided us with a discount that the manager needed to scan. Though he walked by our table numerous times, it took him more than 20 min to stop by (overall we waited more than a half hour just to get the bill). When he finally graced us with his presence, he was rude and and snapped at me when I said we were in a hurry. ""Do you want the discount or not""During our wait we watched a couple get sat next to us, wait for about 15 min and leave because they hadn't be acknowledged...",1,,
2,Roney L.,"Warrington Township, PA",0,3,12,3.0,9/21/2018,"My best friend had the veggie burger meanwhile I had the pasta. The customer service was decent, we sat around for a little bit but then our waiter finally came to get our drinks. We would come back again",,,
3,Diana U.,"Long Island, NY",371,207,321,3.0,6/18/2018,"Menu was extremely limited, in comparison to other planet Hollywood restuarants. Prices are expected, for the area, but taste wise bland. The tables are really close together. The whole time, the table behind me kept pushing my chair, just because they were tight on space as well.",,,
4,Estralda T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",18,65,97,3.0,8/15/2018,The food was ok. For the price I expected more and better. Nothing special other than the decor.,,,
5,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",37,235,1745,3.0,3/25/2018,"A nearby pub was packed for happy hour and was loud so my friends decided to go here. If you didn't know, each location has memorabilia from famous movies serving American food.  This location is located on the second floor.  The first thing that catches your eye is the rotating airplanes hanging from the ceiling.The music was so loud that I could barely hear without shouting what everyone wants.  After the server checked with his manager, the restaurant lowered the music a tad at our request (we finally can hear our server and each other without shouting).The server and trainee were great.  The food is alright...we had appetizer: high roller sampler which contains 5 smalls samplers - chicken crunch, tostados, buffalo wings, five cheese (thought it was spinach) dip and jumbo shrimps   The entree was bbq ribs on a picnic table (ribs were good and very cute presentation!) and chicken parmesan with spaghetti (was good).  Forewarning: the american portions are huge so might want to split or share.Didn't have enough room for desserts.The restrooms are decent.",,,
6,Laura R.,"Warwick, RI",17,85,200,2.0,6/15/2018,Just don't do it. Is the best advice I can give you. The staff was pleasant enough but for the size/turnover there isn't enough of them -and there's a lot of them. The food was nothing special at all. In fact our potato wedges were burnt and my burger wasn't cooked to the way I asked. I rarely send things back but I wish I had. And let's no go into the bar. It's all sugary and over priced. Wish we had spent the money and time somewhere else. The bathrooms we not well kept at all either.,1,,

8,Natalie M.,"Channahon, IL",100,103,438,4.0,4/9/2018,"Planet Hollywood is located just around the corner from Times Square and is very convenient and easy to get to. I went on their website and booked a reservation very easily and quickly. When we got there, we had to go upstairs to get to the restaurant itself. Once up there we checked in at the reservations booth and they told us it would be just one moment. While waiting the guy at the gift shop, Michael, began to tell us all about all of the Hollywood props and memorabilia around the restaurant! We were so impressed and enjoyed talking with Michael that the gal seating us waited patiently for us to finish talking with him.The good was pretty great. Decently priced for a restaurant in Times Square. Our waiter was a little inattentive but all in all not bad. I ordered the blackened chicken pasta, my husband had the chicken Parmesan, and my daughter had the kids chicken fingers and it was all delicious.We would definitely eat here again next time we come back to the city. The Hollywood memorabilia was pretty awesome too!",,,
9,Preston S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",195,35,13,1.0,1/6/2018,"I guess it's ok to put your apron on the floor while using the restroom.  I will give him credit though, I saw him come out and he at least washed his hands.  Definitely won't be ever eating or drinking here ever. Sorry planet Hollywood, you guys can do better.",3,,
10,Lara T.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",336,295,789,3.0,1/3/2018,"Our experience started out with having to wait about 15 minutes for a table on the day after Christmas. We had two adults and 3 children in our party. Once we were seated the waitress took about 5 minutes to get to us because she had another large party. She started out attentive and then things went downhill from there, she seem to have a bit of an attitude with us towards the end as well when we asked for couple more things. The food was decent but nothing too fantastic, I had the chicken parmesan, kids had chicken fingers and pizza. As with most places in New York it was very expensive. It is in a convenient location, only one block off Times Square so it does get very busy. I've been to other Planet Hollywoods before and have had better experiences and people know what they're going to get with a chain restaurant so that's probably why it was so busy and it was the day after Christmas.",3,,
11,Karl A.,"Deer Park, NY",70,128,289,3.0,2/24/2018,"Bear in mind that this location is in the middle of Times Square Manhattan. Food was typical Planet Hollywood. Good but nothing out of this world. We ordered the chips/cheese dip which was tasty. I tried the chicken ceaser salad which wasn't bad either. To drink I tried one of their margaritas (drink order number 2). Be careful, there are two sizes of which the larger is 30 bucks. Ok margarita...strong but far from the best one I've ever had. Tried one of their fancy malt shakes for dessert. Almost like the picture (no Reese's). Not bad. With tip meal was about 130 for 2 adults 2 kids. About average for the area.",,,
12,Michael A.,"Germantown, MD",14,231,243,4.0,2/9/2018,"Let me say that I visited this particular restaurant years ago when I went to NY.  Was with some friends at that time.  I recall we had to wait over 30 minutes just to get a table.  Our service was slow, I must say.  But isn't all of NY busy almost 24/7?  People should already be used to the hustle and bustle, so the workers should adapt to it, no?  In any case, besides the slow service, it was frickin' loud!The food we ordered were fine, though.  Really enjoyed the ones we got and the drinks we ordered, but the wait was indeed slow.  Menu options were enough...",,,
13,Rebecca A.,"Wethersfield, CT",123,112,238,2.0,12/4/2017,"Dirty, run down, slow wait staff (although very nice)...this place needs either a power wash or a lighted match to be taken out of its misery.I was in the city with a foreign exchange student..brought her to a Broadway play and we were trying to find a solid meal that would not break the bank.  The food delivered but it wasn't anything over the top spectacular..I mean..it fed us, filled our bellies, but I do not think my student was happy with her meal because even thought she was really hungry she barely touched it..later on before we boarded the train she almost bought out the snacks at Grand Central..poor kid.  All in all your money is better spent elsewhere.",3,,

15,Eddie T.,"Queens, NY",2,61,0,5.0,4/21/2018,"Obviously this place is gonna have all types of reviews.   I bet in 1980 the atmosphere was really cool lol. But on a serious not they nailed it food wise for me.  I got a margarita on the rocks with salt.  It was awesome.  I kept it simple with my food and drink choices. WINGS......they are really good and the blue cheese dressing is incredible.  Potato Skins were really good (how could they not be), my kids spaghetti and meatballs was decent, awesome fajitas and awesome burger.  Shout out to Jayson our waiter he was really good.  I was totally going there for my kids amusement but everything was good this place really exceeded my expectations.",2,3,2
16,Grace A.,"Queens, NY",60,15,56,3.0,9/10/2018,"The place was amazing! Everything you want to see in Hollywood, they have a unique restaurant design with costumes and trivia's from the movies. Our server was very attentive to our needs and she will suggest what to order. We ordered the jumbo shrimp and NY steak but she said the steak had shrimp on it so we saved money by not buying the additional jumbo shrimp. The food was very salty to my taste and would have been better if they did not add too much salt. We also ordered their supernova shake and it was very delicious and fun to eat. One of the things i noticed is they have this lady going around taking pictures for souvenirs. She gave us a free one and asked if we wanted to take all 3 she will give us a discount. So all in all its 20 dollars, it was fine and the pictures looks nice with a free paper frame but the lady should smile more she looked irritated when we didn't want to take the 3 pictures. Anyway, experience was good but it can be better!",,,

19,Leanne B.,"Gilroy, CA",0,2,1,1.0,4/6/2018,"Waiter completely ignored my friend when she tried to get his attention. Other friend did not get his food for a long time. Lowered his confidence, it was very depressing. Was not offered a water refill. People were screaming the whole time and they were tone deaf. I did not pay to listen to a middle school choir screech my ears out while I'm eating slightly under mediocre food. Get better at kicking people out please for the sake of my remaining sanity.",1,1,
20,Frank M.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,97,22,3.0,3/26/2018,"Tourist trap central. Sensory overload right off the elevator. Loud music, overpriced gift shop, authentic film items, flying objects orbiting. Everything upstages the food. But at least patrons have fun. Timing is everything. As I was leaving, the post theater crowd had formed a heavy line outside. Only a five minute wait, before I was seated right in front of the kitchen path. I asked for another table, so add four minutes. Once I escaped heavy traffic, I could enjoy the experience. I had the expensive strip steak with bean blend and potato wedges. The herb butter is a nice touch. No cheap fatty fries. Steak was a bit dry and really needed the butter. Friendly staff, dour greeter excluded. Bathrooms lack heavy duty air dryers. The low end paper towels are terrible. I got sick right after leaving the restaurant. But I would give them another chance because the venue is entertaining.",1,1,
21,Erica S.,"Houston, TX",154,163,175,4.0,10/3/2017,"Typical chain with overpriced merchandise and food alike. However, we were happy to see the dinner menu still being served at 10:30pm as we weren't in the mood for food truck fare. Our server was friendly and checked on us often. We ordered appetizers and sandwiches. Everything tasted great and came in large portions. Our cocktails were tasty and perfectly poured. They do have a nice sound system with lots of base. Not really a family atmosphere although we noticed families with kids on the night my husband and I stopped in. The bathroom smelled funky and seemed dirty but it could've been the time of night and the fact they were closing soon. We would probably grab drinks here again when in Times Square. Our server was awesome!",,,

23,Jason G.,"Fort Lee, VA",0,17,7,3.0,7/9/2018,I love eating at Planet Hollywood but this was our first trip to the NYC location. The atmosphere was very welcoming and created the perfect setting that you would expect from Planet Hollywood. I had the BBQ bacon burger and it was a good dish. The only complaint is that the burger was not cooked to my liking. I asked for medium but received well done. The only other con is the price. I don't feel that the price is worth the dish. I guess your paying for the location and atmosphere. Overall we had a great time and will go back again.,1,,
24,Luna K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,6,3.0,8/19/2018,"You get what you expect here, mediocre food, mediocre service. Asked for a burger cooked medium, received a very well done burger. Visit with low expectations and you'll have an OK experience.",,,
25,Murali V.,"Ann Arbor, MI",83,333,756,1.0,12/7/2017,"I visited Planet Hollywood with my girlfriend and a couple of friends who play Pokemon Go with us, and we had a pretty poor experience. Having never visited Planet Hollywood before, I had high expectations about the ambiance and food quality; unfortunately this location was a miss on all fronts. To start, we ended up waiting roughly 45 minutes to be seated during an off-peak time, which makes me wonder about how long it must take during a rush. After being seated, I looked around at the props they had and was a little disappointed with the selection (from my perspective most weren't from memorable movies). My friend told me to order the chicken crunch independent of the price, and I ended up caving. My girlfriend ordered the mac 'n cheese, which was similarly high-priced. When I received my chicken crunch, I was immediately disappointed by the amount of strips; it  was an appetizer with the price of an entree! That being said, the taste was much better than expected. In contrast, I tried some of my girlfriend's mac 'n cheese, and found it almost too rich to eat. The one bright spot in this experience was our server, who joked around with us and seemed to have a genuine interest in our day. Overall, I'd recommend avoiding this restaurant if possible based on their atmosphere and price points.",2,1,
26,Vanessa R.,"New York, NY",1,9,6,4.0,8/6/2018,My son loves this restaurant so once we are in NY we have to eat here at least once. The service is on point and the food is great,,,
27,Gina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",202,40,71,3.0,1/25/2018,"There's so many other burger spots to choose from (especially in NYC), that it makes this restaurant average and not worth its price. I ordered a medium rare burger and it was medium well. I would've returned it, but I was hungry and had already waited about half an hour for the food so I didn't want to wait any longer. The burger was seasoned well, but it was just missing the right temperature. All in all, the price you're paying for is the location in Times Square and the nice space. If you don't care for that and just want a good burger, then this is not the best option for you.",,,
28,Tim G.,"Leonardtown, MD",0,7,2,1.0,7/5/2018,"We had tickets to see a 7:00 show so timing was important. I called to make a reservation for 5:30 and the woman who answered told me it wouldn't be necessary so I didn't make one. We got there at 5:30 and got in line for ""a 5 minute wait"".  25 minutes later we were seated. All during that time groups were coming in and being seated who had reservations! Infuriating! When we finally got seated the waiter didn't show up at our table for another 10-15 minutes. We told him our situation. We now had only about 30 minutes to eat in order to catch our showtime. With a great deal of attitude (like it was our fault) he took our order of apps only (to speed things along). It took another 15-20 minutes to finally get our food. All the while tables who were seated after us were getting their entrees. We wolfed down our food, paid, and left. Food was fine. No big deal.",,,
29,Anthony K.,"Milwaukee, WI",7,90,0,3.0,4/21/2017,"Long, long wait on a Tuesday night for sub-decent food that was WAY overpriced.  We undoubtedly paid for the location more than anything else.On a positive note, our server was very attentive and brought the rating from 1-star to 3-stars just for his effort.",1,,
30,Valecia N.,"Houston, TX",0,2,0,1.0,6/26/2018,"My family and I were visiting NYC over the weekend and made reservations to go to Planet Hollywood. It was a busy Saturday night. We ordered the high roller sampler for our table of 4. When it came out it was awful! The lettuce was brown and one of the shrimp was missing. The carrots that went with the wings were white and dried up. The wings were not fresh. We asked to see a manager who did immediately correct the problem, but by this time we were highly disappointed at the presentation of our food. Our waitress had an attitude and avoided dealing with us which also made this restaurant visit an unpleasant one. There are so many other restaurants that are smaller and food is better in NYC. Be willing to explore!",,,
31,Erin H.,"Bordentown, NJ",27,25,25,4.0,3/12/2018,"This is a really cool place to bring your kids. There are so many cool things to take in while you're eating AND if you have room for dessert, they are ginormous!!!

32,Vane K.,"Ossining, NY",12,64,161,5.0,4/23/2017,"This place was very intriguing from the moment you walk in. It is upstairs. So as your walking, you look around and see all the pictures/items on the walls, for example comic book strips and a Spiderman on the wall. Then you start to see outfits actors wore from the titanic, the Adams family, and ghostbusters. It's very cool to look around. The hostess was very friendly and pointed out a couple of props up on the wall from classic movies like Ace Ventura and the original King Kong. The ambiance was very upbeat and busy, the music played at this restaurants was good, music that everyone knows and you can sing along to like Usher ""OMG"". Very family friendly, the menu is large and has a wide variety. We got a margarita pie it was great!",,,

35,Organic M.,"Conshohocken, PA",4,29,19,1.0,4/1/2018,This place is horrible. I took my children here yesterday against my better judgement and it was a disaster.

Haha...it was delicious and we got a complimentary glass to take home as well as a discounted refill-which we could not finish after our meal! He ordered a mushroom Swiss burger while I got the avocado and Swiss grilled chicken sandwich...the fries were absolutely amazing! Crispy but not greasy!

When I placed my order for ""blackened chicken on linguine"" which it is exactly described on the menu, it came on Penne instead.  Instead of admitting to the mistake he tried to make some strange excuse!  It's wrong, why are you making excuses??  I sent that back and 15 minutes went by and I still had no food.  My family's food orders came out fine.  Another waiter who seemed to have his act together was rushing by and we alerted him and he sent the manager over.  The manager apologized and got the meal to me ASAP and comped my meal but he could have done a little more like  reassigned our table to another waiter.  That would have been a good move on his part and perhaps this would have gotten more than a 1 star review.  The waiter was also very touchy/feely which was annoying as hell.  I did not use the restroom myself but my sister said it was nasty.  They were also having problems with their sound system because when we first got there they just kept playing the theme to Fresh Prince over and over.  Great Christmas decorations but the music should have been better and was a little loud for my taste.Over all this place needs a major deep clean and overhaul on staff, staffing levels and/or management.  My food when it finally arrived was VERY good.  Would have been nice had the manager offered free dessert to my family while I ate my main meal.  This was a one-off for us but I had to share to help others avoid a similar experience.",3,,
42,Lisa R.,"Middle Island, NY",1,7,0,2.0,1/22/2018,Okay so let's first state the glaringly obvious: this place is smack dab in the middle of Times Square with the sole purpose of being a tourist destination. So leave any and all expectations of it being a culinary wonderland at the door. Now that we've got that out of the way...here's the good. First of all the memorabilia is fun. Kill some time while you wait to be seated by taking a look around. Also they have a small store selling (what else?) Planet Hollywood merch. Also they have a large drink selection.The not so good. The menu is small and not much variety. Food was barely decent. I mean how can pasta that is  drowning in that much sauce be so bland? Overpriced mediocre food. Also got suckered into buying a photo they took of our party. Skip it and find a pizza place.,1,,

45,Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",62,495,841,4.0,11/19/2015,"Worth going to at least once.I live close to the city, so I don't do the touristy stuff. I was in the area today and decided to finally try this place. There's good and bad in here and certainly a lot of room for improvements. Upon entering, we were almost forced to take pics in front of a green screen. I felt like I was in a theme park and already knew the gimmick they were pulling. How about ASKING people if they want the picture. The kid taking the pictures wasn't the best either. They found us later and showed us the pictures with the different backgrounds and corny captions, but I had no intentions of buying. Wonder what actually happens to the pictures of us that they should have ASKED us for. I'm not sure how many people actually pay for these or not, but it's a waste to print and frame pictures unless it's requested. Kind of poor to do it in the way that they do.The hostess took her time and eventually seated us next to other patrons instead of spacing us out which would have been preferred. It wasn't overly crowded during the time I was in and was largely empty, so I'm sure she could have spaced us better. The food itself is pricey, but it's Planet Hollywood in Times Square in NYC so it's going to be pricey like anything in the area.....or in Manhattan in general. I considered it a novelty to try it once, so I was ok this time with the price. I got the NY Strip which was $35 (over my norm of a bacon cheeseburger, $18+ in it's own right). That dish was certainly not worth $35. While the steak was made the way I requested and the sides were there, it was a tad salty and I could get the same or better, cheaper at any Outback Steakhouse. But it's Planet Hollywood, so it's ok for today. They have the option of drinking from $9.99 souvenir cups that you can take home, but I passed on that. There's also a small gift shop inside if that's your thing. The waitress, Nicole, was excellent and was one of the better waitresses I've had in a restaurant in a long time. Very friendly and courteous. They had screens playing and music. As another reviewer said, they really ought to have movie videos playing - whether it's clips, scenes, or just a movie. I can't stand One Direction as it is, but seeing a music video and hearing their song was something that wasn't needed in a movie themed restaurant. Really, only movie themes and clips should be seen and heard at all times. There is a small movie prop gallery in the front and of course all throughout the restaurant. Aside from the large props or pictures on the wall, most of the galleries should be in the front. Yes, we can walk around and take pics, but between the glare of the glass (not making for great pictures) and walking right next to people eating, it's not the best for doing that. I took some pictures and just scanned over the rest. It's too bad. Maybe one day I'll build up the nerve to stand directly next to someone while they're eating just to look at a prop. I do think they need to redo things, but it's ok for what it is, The overall look of the restaurant is fairly unique though and fun for someone like me (who's a huge movie buff). If you have a weak camera, the pictures won't turn up the greatest. My iPhone camera, the glare from the cases, and the dimmer lighting = not good pictures for me. They probably change out some of the props at times, but there should be at least something for mostly anyone. From Titanic to Terminator, from Wayne's World to Planet of the Apes...there's at least something that should strike your fancy, There is no list I can find of all the props as a whole in this location, so it's best to look around because there's something almost everywhere inside. So whether you're a tourist or not, it's a decent place to visit at least once just for the novelty of it. Just be cautious of the price tag - but if you're already in Manhattan and in Times Square, I'm pretty sure you know what to expect in here already.",2,,1

52,Saubia L.,"Flatlands, Brooklyn, NY",99,4,0,1.0,3/23/2017,"I used to go to this restaurant all the time when I was in highschool.  12 years later I wanted to take my cousins new to New York to dinner. When we got their we realized they moved from the corner inward. The entrance that was pretty nice changed. My first hunch was to get up and leave for another restaurant. For some reason I had a feeling it wouldn't be good but I tried to get myself to settle down and stop feeling so negative. Also I think in the move they lost a lot of the essence they had in the other location. Bathrooms used to be so well maintained when I went years ago with well stock toiletries including perfumes. It was pretty classy back then. Now the bathrooms were barely clean and run down looking. The lighting around the  restaurant made me nauseous and it reminded of a cheap motel room. The food completely sucked. It was mediocre and seems like a kid put it together. Pasta was overlooked, veggie burger was overcooked and dry. The fried rice for a missing this and of a cheap Chinese fast food take out where you can taste the oil and our shrimp fajitas the shrimp taste it so fishy it was unusual. The only thing we liked were the nachos we ordered. I would say skip this place and opt for the dollar pizzas all over. They taste much better.  I regret spending over $100 on the nasty meal. Service was not the best either. I actually saw one of the kitchen staff use the toilet and not wash her hands when she left the bathroom. I was so disgusted.",3,2,

Loved the titanic props and outfits, that's are from the actual movie. Planes hanging from the ceiling, old school cars, photos and posters of anything Hollywood. The menu selection was lovely, many options to satisfy anyone. We are here twice, since it was so great the first time, so we tried a few things. An avocado and Swiss chicken sandwich, a BBQ bacon cheddar chicken sandwich, and the Chicken Parmesan. The avocado was fresh, along with the lettuce and tomato making the sandwich tasty. Only downfall of the sandwich was the chicken was slightly burnt. Next the BBQ bacon cheddar sandwich was good, just flavorful BBQ sauce and bacon giving it kinda salty and sweet thing going on. Finally the best thing was the chicken parmesan. It was wonderful. The crispy piece of chicken was cooked so well and the actual breading was full of flavor while the chicken was still juicy! The cheese on top was melted all over it perfectly. The spaghetti was amazing, it wasn't bland at all. Put it all together and it was delicious!

Food took a while even when the place was half empty.  Also, the atmosphere was very loud due to the rambunctious music that kept cutting on and off. Lighting was very dim. I had to yell so that the person I was with could hear me. Everyone in the restaurant just kept looking at one another like what the hell is going on here.

The chicken salad was creamy and I think it had some almonds or something slightly crunchy in it. If I ever had to go back, I would get the chicken salad again.The service was just okay. When we first entered, I felt like they were trying to push us off to sit at the bar. The bar area was bar seating and some high top tables which was completely full.

We took the elevator upstairs and yikes, it was loud! I guess that should be expected, since they're always playing pop music from ""Todays Top 40"" or something to that extent, but it was kind of jarring to see that it was quieter on the streets of Manhattan than in the restaurant...Fortunately, the wait wasn't very long, but I attribute that to it being early in the evening (roughly 6pm) rather than later around dinner time. But we were able to get a seat and look over the menu. Oy vey! The prices were pretty high, considering it was just your typical American food (burgers, pastas, pizzas, salads, the norm) so we only ordered two dishes and split them amongst ourselves. The food was surprisingly good, we ordered the four cheese mac n cheese and a plain pizza. Very good, especially since we didn't really come here for the food, but rather the convenience. But I would not recommend coming here if you just need a quick, cheap meal. The service was a bit slow, and our waiter kept disappearing!

The food was good...but came out cold-ish...as if it was sitting and waiting. Our waiter was horrible. There were literally less than 10 tables with people and multiple waiters. We literally saw our waiter 2-3 times. First we were waiting for about 15 minutes before even greeting us or getting our drink order. He got that (2 waters and a root beer). He got our order. When that came out cold, i asked for ketchup. That was another 5 minutes. I was worried he had to make it himself and i almost walked to the kitchen myself to get it. Eventually he came back after we started eating. All glasses were empty and he refilled the root beer only. He literally dropped it off and left so abruptly that we couldn't even ask for refill on the waters although it was very evident we didn't have any at the time he got the one refill. After we were done with the food...we literally waited 15-20 min for the check. He was hardly on the floor to find. It's like he would help a table and run in the back to avoid checking on his tables. He really seemed not to care about his job and would hate to see him working on a busy day. My boyfriend is the GM of a restaurant down here in Richmond, VA and this type of service would be completely unacceptable. There was no management presence on the floor.

Upon closer inspection we found that our glasses where immensely dirty! One was even covered in lint and fuzz but by the time we did notice it was too late. Service was slow. God awfully slow. A different server had to come over to ask us if we needed drinks. Thank god those glasses where clean. Next we got the chicken crunch as an app and what can I say it was what resembled a fast food chain pretending to be a 5 star restaurant--terrible. Next our entrees took and eternity and a half to arrive only to be disappointed yet again with a fajita dish worth $22.00--yes $22 damn dollars--which contained 5 small strips of chicken and a little side of rice.

Since then, I take every chance to check out a new location when I am in an area that has one. For years, I have done bus trips to New York with friends and family a couple times a year, and every time I do, we start with drinks and appetizers at Planet Hollywood. Some of the stuff in the Lobby was the best part. The Star Wars stuff and the nightmare on elm street stuff were my favorites. Earlier in 2015 I visited, only to find that the lobby doesn't even exist any more. Where Planet Hollywood's lobby once existed, was now a Sunglass Store. I finally found the new entrance to planet hollywood, which is a tiny and un-inviting stairwell on the side of the building. Once inside, the space is much smaller, and the number of items have significantly shrunk. It really feels like this tiny location with minimal memorabilia should be considered an ""express"" location. Sadly, the prices are just as high, despite how much has been taken away.

96,Summer A.,"Manhattan, NY",61,77,89,1.0,11/21/2016,"I visited here on Saturday evening for a birthday dinner for a friend. Ambiance is cool and trendy. However thats where it stops.Service- We were a pretty large group approximately 15 ppl the waitresses seemed pretty stressed out and a bit all over the place. The restaurant was not overcrowded but pretty busy. We rceieved silverware on our table that was not clean and glasses that were even worse. Because of the size of our party we were served from a pre fixed menu. when I mentioned to the waitress that the glasses were incredibly filthy she debated with me and told me they were not dirty that they were hard water stains. i then pointed out a clear lipstick stain on one glass she still continued to inform me of water stains when you could clearly see imprint of a lip. the thing is the menu included unlimited soft drinks and for whatever reason the server only wanted to refill the existing glasses multiple times instead of replacing them. when the other members of our dinner party started to voice complaints about the filthy glasses and flatware she then offered us childrens sized ""to-go"" cups which is what we drank out of for the night. Mind you the youngest guest in attendance was 18.Food- The food left much to be desired. the menu we had included ribs, salmon and chicken all were mediocre. My dish was salmon I asked for it to be well done the salmon was charred on the outside and practically raw inside I called over the manager who apologized and agreed that it was not cooked and offered a replacement. the replacement came out shortly after and still was not cooked after i sent this back i was then given my first course of salad ughh! most of the guest at the table did not eat or ate very minimal portions of the meal. the last course was dessert. they proceeded to bring out chocolate cake and the cake was stale. At that point i was done. What was really displeasing is the guest of honor was given a piece of this stale cake with an unlit birthday candle and not even told happy birthday by the team serving us like we saw other patrons get that evening they didn't even wait for the other guest to acknowledge that he was being given his stale cake with an unlit candle so we could at least serenade him on his special day. This was quite disappointing since he requested this restaurant thinking it would be amazing as they advertise it to be after all it is times square.Long story short it was really dissappointing.......",3,1,1

The resturant was not busy at all but still everything took four times longer than it should have.Food: My wifes steak was cooked to her liking but the flavor of the meat was bland and not mouth watering like you think a 33$ steak should be.( If you like eating a big peice of char off the grill then your at the right place) I will say the bbq chedder chicken sandwich I ordered was tastey but the fries were luke warm.Comfort: overall vibe of this place was very gimmicky and money hungry.

They have gotten rid of amazing movie memorabilia such as the death star in the lobby (there is no loby anymore, just a staircase), the wall of guns, and their stuff on the staircase. Since most of the fun is based on the ambience, it is sad that a lot of it is gone (the foods good, but come on, it's planet hollywood).

I was expecting the show to be held in the main dining room and was disappointed when we were pointed towards the back of the restaurant upon our arrival. The room itself was pretty small and had tables enough to hold about 40 ppl. It felt pretty gloomy (with black wallpaper and curtain) along with the lack of decoration which I found it surprising since it is Planet Hollywood - where are all the movie posters? and prop displays?  My fiance and I sat at our reserved table which was right by the exit door - which allowed us to hear all the behind the scene operational orders/screams at each other.  I wasn't expecting a buffet lunch since thehowaboutwe date listed the food option as 3 courses. But I can't complain since they kept replenishing the food and I was able to get multiple servings. We were second in line to a couple who stood by the door way before they had the food ready - second dip wasn't so bad! I was able to pile and bring back a hearty plate of house salad, fettuccine Alfredo, spaghetti marinara, and chicken parm to my table. The food was your generic American/Italian big portion food coma inducing meal- nothing special and yet nothing to complain about. I actually really liked the chicken parm sauce which I went back to grab the leftover sauces once they ran out of the chicken to pour it over my salad (yep i'm weird like that). I kept scraping and scraping the bottom of the pan to a point the server came back to persoanlly update me about the chicken ""more is coming!"". After half an hr into the self served buffet, they brought out plates of cookies and brownies to each table (why can't this part be buffet style?) They portioned each plate for either 2 or for 4 ppl. So the table next to ours had 3 ppl and I couldn't help but kept eye-ing their plentiful (leftover) sweets. The show itself was more forgettable than the meal itself. My fiance who usually loves stand up comedy/live shows couldn't help but acknowledge the fact that he was bored during the show. If we weren't fed, I would have felt terrible dragging him out on this date. Overall a nice try but a meh experience.",5,1,

I know Planet Hollywood isn't a chinese restaurant, but then the chefs were confused on how I wanted my lo mein served without the chicken or vegetables and gave me the wrong dish. Eventually, I did get food, but I'd give it a 4 because it was too much soy sauce, even after I mixed it with some white rice. I still had an amazing waitress who was super patient and funny. I had tons of fun looking at all the posters and memorabilia which really makes this place unique. P e r f e c t for tourists overall. I'm always satisfied with service.

We got seated close the stage they had presented there.  We waited about 15 to 20 mins for someone to even acknowledge us. My sister had to get up and ask for a Mgr.

He took care of us and made sure our food was on the fly. Meaning out on the table quickly.  He was charming,  funny and attentive. Now, what I give this place a 1 star is because they have no organization there. There are servers standing around doing nothing and the fact that we waited for one was beyond ridiculous. The mangers aren't around as they should. If they are they are too busy gossiping.  Not one Mgr approach us regarding our delay of service . The food is not that great.

The entrees we ordered were the salmon and a burger. Salmon was fine and the burger was not. It lacked flavor. The cleanliness of the restaurant was poor. We probably should have left but I stuck it out for the kids. The dishes that came out looked dirty but as it turns out they are just old, overused dishes that have not been replaced. The bathrooms had an awful smell that you could smell outside the bathrooms. Disgusting. The only reason this place got a star from me is because the server was very attentive. Refilled drinks without having to be asked and promptly took our order. Although he did bring the check out in one the black folders and it was wet and intuitive looking. That dirty folder was consistent with the lack of cleanliness of the place. As we walked down the stairs to leave the restaurant we noticed their checkerboard carpeting was absolutely nasty looking.

When the bill comes they charged me for fries on the side and more money for chicken tenders then the kids menu. Waitress says 10 and younger & manager says 12 and younger.  Which is it???

I would say overall mediocre and DEFINITELY not as good as the Planet Hollywood in Orlando...Service was ok... We had to frequently get our waitress's attention rather than her coming to us... It wasn't even that crowded ...only a five minute wait at the door... Then again, I always give the servers the benefit of the doubt knowing they are probably dealing with difficult people.... The food runner was obnoxious and his attitude was not a positive reflection of this restaurant... The food was mediocre for their high prices... We are familiar with this chain, therefore, the somewhat high prices  were of no surprise to us...With that said, the food was still mediocre... The potstickers were lukewarm rather than hot..The egg rolls were pretty good...The spinach and artichoke dip was salty...The wings were lukewarm, but the flavor was pretty good... The Mac & Cheese dinner my husband ordered was tasty.... My friend enjoyed the burger and my other friend enjoyed her chicken and avocado sandwich... I ordered the turkey burger very very well done and it certainly was not even close to being cooked... It was nasty how undercooked it was, so I sent it back, and asked for them to cook it longer... I was told they don't like to cook things ""too well""... I assured them I would not send it back  for being too well.... In my world there is nothing ""too well"" when it comes to turkey burgers (this is the only form of meat I eat so I like it like charcoal and I ALWAYS specify that when ordering)... Needless to say, it still wasn't well when I got it and the flavor was terrible..... However, I must say the fries were AWESOME though....Overall, I would not visit this location again...I would go back to the Orlando one...they seem to have their act together.... If I were to go back to a chain in Manhattan again, it would be Hard Rock over this place!!!",3,1,1

You know it's gonna be average and overpriced, so let's get to the real nitty-gritty: movie memorabilia.First off, this Planet Hollywood must have a mad hook-up cuz they have not one, not two, but THREE different things from the Ace Ventura movies!!  I don't know how they got their hands on those rare gems, but someone's gotta be doing something right.There were some notable set pieces from King Kong, Terminator duh, and a little alien guy from ID4 (who was stuffed way up high, in the dark, in the corner, where you could barely even tell what the hell it is). They did have the Mirth-Mobile from Wayne's World though, and that was totally cool to see.The rest were mostly just dresses or dress replicas. So, like, in case you're a big Marilyn Monroe fan and you wanna see a REPLICA of that dumb white dress, Planet Hollywood NYC is where you want to be!Everything was pretty much what can be expected. Except, I didn't understand why the hell they were playing music videos on all the TVs instead of, I dunno, MOVIES... or movie clips... or something movie related. Maybe Hard Rock Cafe plays movies or something. I'll check it out.Best part: Spider-Man's balls, clearly visible as you walk up the stairs to the dining area. Nice super power.",,3,1

The food was a little lackluster, my grilled chicken sandwich was a bit burned yet was doable. As for the fries they were delicious and their chocolate chip cookies are to die for.

I had to walk up 4 flights of stairs to get there. you'd want that to be worth it.2. They had music videos (thats a plus) but did they tell me who they were by? like artist and track listing? nahhh. Also they had a cheesey 20% off shit in their store add under whatever was on the tv. (ALL of the TV's.) thats a joke right? classy.3. They advertised this cool blue drink witha  shark in it. but I guess they ""ran out of sharks"" wtf. really?4. The service was HORRIBLE, I mean the food before the drinks? (I only ordered a smoothie?) It took forever for us to get waited on, and he was beyond disinterested in us. 5. The food was good, I'll give them that. I ordered a chicken sandwich that came with mayo on the side (thanks!) and a wheat roll. I appreciate the healthiness of this. All in all, if you like totally cheesed out, themed, chain restaurants with mediocre service this is SO your place.

If you need a place to bring students on a school trip, go to the Hard Rock Cafe.  You get better food and a little more up-scale atmosphere plus better memorabilia.  Don't go to Mars either, another one that is certain to disappoint.  If you are in NYC on vacation, try to avoid restaurants you can find other places.  There are too many great restaurants in NYC, even touristy ones, to waste time and money on Planet Hollywood.",5,,

The food was... subpar at best. The cocktail was pretty bad though. Only thing I remember that was 'a ok' was their burgers and fries which is... hard to mess up. The recent visit of last week, I came here with 2 of my friends who were visiting from Korea. They also liked how interesting this place looks at first sight. We went here late lunch/early dinner time, so there was no waiting for us. About 30minutes after us, the line started to pile, I guess we were lucky to be ahead of the curb. Their interior have changed tho from 2 years ago. I liked the old one better. New one seems a little out of place. The food... Well they are here for the experience, not for the quality of what they eat. Bottom line, I'd take someone here for experience but won't take same person twice since they will also agree that food here is pretty bad. Just fun for the eyes.",2,,
