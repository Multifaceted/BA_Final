0,Stefan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,0.0,5.0,9/22/2018,"When I travel to NYC, this is my GO TO for breakfast. I came here with my wife on Saturday morning at 10:30 and waited 10 minutes for seating. The wait was worth it. We both ordered the lumber jack, with sausage and bacon. Eggs and meat were on point. The jackpot were the pancakes! Once smothered in butter and topped with syrup, you can't find any other place better than here. Food came out quick under 10 minutes despite the heavy order load and staff displayed great hospitality. If you are exploring the city for gems that serve high quality food for a low price, this is the place to be.",2,,1
1,Mandi W.,"San Francisco, CA",198,576,1087,4.0,10/23/2018,"Got the NY diner feel here. And apparently they're called 'luncheonettes'... Who knew....The place is small and narrow with counter seats. We ordered the egg, sausage, cheese on a bagel... Like $4 - amazing prices. So many places in San Francisco charge like $12 for the same meal... Is this $4 meal better or worse than my city's $12 version? *Cue drum roll* It's better... In taste it's prob the same, but knowing I'm pocketing $8 on that meal makes it that much better!That aside, give this spot a try. It's yummy and cheap and your stomach and wallet will thank you.",5,1,1
2,Carly M.,"Toronto, Canada",106,55,102,4.0,9/29/2018,"Great little breakfast spot for casual, fast, inexpensive dining. We showed up around 11 am on Saturday and waited in line for about 20 minutes. At first my sister and I sat alone at a table for 2 and my mom sat on her own, but then we finally were able to sit next to each other.I ordered the farmer's omelette that comes with 2 pieces of toast and home fries for about $8. My sister order over easy eggs with salami (also about $8). My omelette was very fluffy and super tasty. I was very impressed - now I get the rave reviews! The staff were also friendly. It's a very small, narrow restaurant with minimal seating - I suggest coming if you are solo or in a group no longer than 4. It's very old and run down but adds to its character. But it's very cool sitting along the long counter, watching the chef work his magic (I have never seen someone cook or cut bread so fast!)",1,,1
3,Hammy H.,"Queens, NY",127,73,146,5.0,8/27/2018,"I came in hungry and seeing if the restaurant meets the quality of the reviews... and it absolutely does!While I like all kinds of food- I have a deep affinity for street eats- quality food that doesn't break the bank.Sometimes you just want to sit down, feel homely, and eat for the nostalgia feeling- to get away from the huddle and bustle of the city life surrounding this restaurant. I got just that.I came in at 4:25- 5 minutes to closing- and I felt bad when I saw the cook appeared as if he was wrapping up- ready to make my exit is gastronomic defeat I began to make my way out the door- the owner and the chef stopped me and welcomed me in- ""order what you like,don't worry!"" They exclaimed and said they needed to clean up anyways.I ordered the lumberjack pancakes- comes with pancakes 2 eggs, bacon strips and coffee. The eggs and bacon were cooked how i like it- crispy and runny!The highlight of this jewel of a restaurant is their pancakes! SO DELICIOUS! You watch him cook it right in front of you(see picture) and time it goes from grill to your mouth- 5 seconds. My pancakes were Slightly crispy on the outside and moist and creamy on the inside. Loved every bite. The owner and the chef were nice enough to take a picture at the end with me.Cleanliness- yesBathroom- present out back- usableHappy? YesLove it or dump it?Absolutely love it! I recommend this restaurant for a homely meal that is under $10",2,,1
4,Krizia C.,"Manhattan, NY",318,311,190,5.0,8/4/2018,"Little gem in the heart of Chelsea. If you want straight up good diner food come here!! I just discovered it by walking by and saw a line out the door. When I asked the people waiting they said it was to get inside. I decided to wait and it was well worth it. The spot is small I imagine about 15 people at one time. One grill station and prep station right behind the counter so, if you're a big party be prepared to wait. There is no seating area to wait so you just stand outside, but it goes by fast. Once inside or pure  diner  setup and style. Service is good, portions are big, and most importantly food is amazing. I got the three  egg white omelette, which I served with coffee, bread, and house potatoes . Carb overload, but WHO CARES!!  The coffee is yummy, eggs cooked perfectly, and potatoes were perfect. Not overly fried or seasoned. We also tried the pancakes, which come in a stack of three with a side of butter.  So so good. Def new spot for my Saturday's brunch fix!",2,,
5,Lucy W. H.,"Glendale, CA",631,873,2247,4.0,10/20/2018,Super crowded and narrow. We ordered takeout. You can order online and save 10%.  People wait on the sidewalk. Reasonable food at reasonable prices. My egg on a roll with cheese and bacon hit the spot. It was my daily breakfast when I was a bond trader on Wall Street so each bite brought back memories.,,,
6,Creighton R.,"Omaha, NE",178,71,84,3.0,9/12/2018,What a great little diner on the lower east side of NYC! The staff was fun and entertaining. They cook the food right in front of you at the grill as 90% of the seating is at the bar. I think I might have gone overboard with what I ordered (see image). The sodas come in cans. Enjoy!,,1,
7,Daisy K.,"San Francisco, CA",380,34,12,5.0,10/27/2018,"Man. What a perfect hole in the wall. For $12 you can get one of the most filling, perfect diner breakfasts - the hungry man: 2 eggs, pancakes, home fries, sausage, bacon and toast. Literal perfection. The guy cooking was even more fascinating to watch - super fast. Ever played those time management games like Bush's hot dog stand? He must have WRECKED those games as a kid. All in all, this place kills and makes NY a better place.",,,
8,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,4.0,3/15/2018,"This little diner squeezed in a glassy sea of midtown skyscrapers looks sorta 1930s.It's clean, it's tiny, it's off the grid and not a tourist in site.There's a take out window since space is limited inside. The Chinese cook took my order with few words and suggested I waited outside.  It was around 45 degrees and it was sunny so I went along with it. The inside is basically a long bar top with chrome fixed stools with a wall behind it giving you just enough room to walk down the counter to sit down. An old school tolken man in his early 40s graciously took my money - he could've been a friend or relative of Joe Pesci or Andrew Dice Clay. My egg on a roll with bacon was around &4.50 - a fairly normal price. The sandwich was good, and iconic nyc breakfast staple, with a well cooked egg, a slightly toasted bun and not greasy.  It's sort of like an old school unhealthy meal your grandfather might make you that you love.The food might be basic, but the atmosphere is keen.  I'd plan on coming back to eat at the counter even tho I'm guessing the coffee is weak.Atmosphere - old school shot gun diner on 25th Food - basic diner food at fairly low prices.",14,8,12
9,Ken Y.,"Baltimore, MD",37,211,302,3.0,7/31/2018,"Standard breakfast diner food like I like it - tasty, cheap and fast.  The Florentine omelette was pretty good, with just the right amount of tomato, spinach and feta.  My dining friend had pancakes, potatoes and some kind of meat.  No complaints on either meal.",2,,
10,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,170,469,5.0,3/18/2018,"A small diner that serves great food that you'd expect from a homey diner. Came here on a weekday afternoon, it's a little cramped but service is fairly quick (for a staff of all of 3 people, they do a good job). There's mostly a counterspace, and then 2 small tables in the back. Not recommended for large parties unless you want to split up and wait.All the food on the menu looked amazing and was affordable. I ordered the king kong breakfast, which was a hero that was made like french toast, topped with eggs bacon bananas and cinnamon. The combination was surprisingly tasty and very delicious.The big man breakfast is also famous - and you definitely get a ton of food. The pancakes are quite good for that. Also most meals come with a coffee or tea. There was only one cook when I was there, and you can watch him make each party's food. This is also not a place where you can be picky about your order - as I overheard from another table, no they do not carry avocados, and there are onions in the home fries that cannot be taken out.Nevertheless, good food for the price. Would definitely recommend.",2,1,2
11,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",195,145,221,5.0,3/12/2018,"If you're here for great service, you're in the wrong place. But if you want good tasting food at an incredibly affordable price, you've come to the right place! Located on west 26th st, it's a small quaint place. They have 2 tables in the back (1 for parties of 3-4, the other for 2) and bar seating. We were lucky to get a table.Lured here by the promise of the ""big man breakfast"", I came and ordered that. For $11.50, you get 2 eggs, 2 pancakes or French toast (I opted for pancakes), home fries, 2 strips of bacon, sausage, toast and coffee or tea.At first, i thought it wasn't much food. I ate some and the pancakes were actually huge, I asked for chocolate chip pancakes ($1 extra) and they came out great. The eggs were scrambled as I asked, the bacon wasn't extremely crispy and the sausage was cut in half. The pancake was the highlight of the meal. While they're not Clinton st bakery pancakes, they're still quite good. The chocolate was enough that you could taste but not to the point where it was too sweet. Overall, I think it's a fantastic value and everyone should definitely try it if you're in the area.",1,,
12,Deborah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,77,54,4.0,11/7/2018,Quick greasy spoon in such a good old fashion way.  You will wait but not long. If you want a NYC old school breakfast come here!,,,
13,Yaran S.,"Pittsfield, MA",152,277,1366,5.0,1/1/2018,"When talking about good restaurants, it is always just about food. But this place has something more than tasty food to us. My parents and I enjoyed our brunch at this tiny hole-in-the-wall when I first moved to the city. My mom fell in love with their potatoes and bacon and kept talking about it over the year so I took her back a year later. We went quite late so they were out of potatoes, which made my mom really upset. Then the amazing cook(still don't know his name) decided to make a new batch of potatoes just for my mom! He even invited her to take photos with him behind the counter! Needless to say that we enjoyed the afternoon brunch again.Our second visit was such a sweet memory in the city where everyone is busy and in a rush. Thank you for your kindness and hospitality :)",2,,4
14,Keisha H.,"Elmont, NY",31,3,1,5.0,11/6/2018,Amazing!!!! Love the banana pancakes! The bacon came exactly the way I asked & the lemonade is actually homemade! What?! Lol Great service!,,,
15,Lexy D.,"Cleveland, OH",3,25,3,4.0,9/8/2018,"This is diner food. Good diner food, but not fancy food so if you're coming here expecting that you'll be disappointed. I had an egg sandwich which was fine, but the pancakes were amazing (in my opinion). They were just what I like in pancakes - not cakey, just the right thickness and fluffiness. Definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for a filling, affordable breakfast. But prepare yourself, it's really small. Mostly just a counter that seats about 10 people and two small high top tables that seats 3 max, each.",1,,
16,Abby S.,"Denver, CO",3821,2159,6353,5.0,5/11/2018,"Oh so good and oh so nice. Even before nabbing two seats at the counter, a construction worker outside said to us, ""you gotta eat here"" and whistled through the takeout window to let them know there were two people outside who wanted to eat.Most folks include ""greasy"" along with the word ""diner"" but Johnny's is clean as a whistle inside. Breakfast food like eggs and pancakes are prepared on a flat top grill and they surely use butter. But it's not gross or greasy at all. Patrons are a mix of tourists and local regular, all of us looking for a filling and affordable meal to start (or maybe end) their day. Had we more time in Manhattan I would have gone back for lunch or another round of breakfast for sure.",11,6,11
17,Leena S.,"Princeton, NJ",223,471,1727,4.0,10/25/2017,"Johny's is a quintessential New York city hole in the wall!  Perfect for some inexpensive (not always easy to find in the city) breakfast and brunch fare.   It's a small, long and narrow place; 8 stools along a counter and two small tables in the back.  Our party of 4 saddled up to the counter on the stools. I would imagine this would not have been easy to do on a weekend, but was conducive on a Tuesday mid-morning.The service was very friendly and engaging and our food was made on the griddle right in front of us.  We ordered some eggs, omelets, banana pancakes, and pastrami on rye (a New York City classic).  Everything was tasty.  My banana pancakes were really good and I vowed not to eat all 3 to avoid a carbo overload, but sadly I broke my own vow!",8,2,2
18,Gloria C.,"Laurel, MD",10,39,144,5.0,9/11/2018,"This place is realllly good! We got the breakfast burrito and the big mans breakfast. The breakfast burrito was amazing!

19,Bryant M.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",68,2,1,4.0,11/4/2018,"This is a great place to go when on the run and looking for that meal like you were at home.  Friendly and fast service, great selection, good eats and reasonable prices for NYC.  I'll go back.",,,
20,Kim Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",104,2,0,3.0,10/30/2018,"The food was amazing! However, one of the servers scammed me and charged me extra. So we ordered the Big Mans breakfast which comes to 11.95$. The server informs us that if I share my food they would charge me $2 extra. This policy makes no sense. We hesitantly obliged and devoured our overpriced meal. When we paid for our bill the total came out to be $16.33 with tax. 13.95$ plus tax does not equal $16.33 without tip included. We ended up tipping $2. So in total we paid $18.33 for a single meal. I dont know how the server calculated tax but he definitely overcharged us.",,,
21,Tomas C.,"Chicago, IL",27,108,39,5.0,4/25/2018,"I like this place. Good spot to pick up a sandwich at the window.  It's tiny, but it turns over fast. It's been here  the sandwiches are simple, and very fresh.  Terrible onion rings. But, Good tuna.  They heat the bread and cheese on a tuna melt, and put the tuna in cold.  Nice touch.  I like the staff.  Neighborhood is over grown.  This place will be gone before you know it..",1,,1
22,Jocelyn J.,"Garden Grove, CA",6,21,3,5.0,8/31/2018,"Breakfast and service was amazing! My friends and I were visiting New York and stumbled upon this hidden jem. It was about 7am, and we were half asleep (literally just landed from a 5 hour flight) and starving. We were greeted with a friendly ""Good morning"" and the gentleman promptly took our order . My friends ordered the 2 eggs on a roll, French toast, eggs and bacon. I ordered potatoes , scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and a English muffin with butter and jelly. Everything was delicious! It tasted just like a homemade breakfast. Also, the prices were great . We will definitely be back!",,,
23,Christian C.,"Waterford Township, MI",294,74,171,4.0,10/1/2017,"Now I get it. New York City is the most populous city in the US, so it's safe to assume that some of their restaurants and Diners would be small or cramped. Well say hello to Johnny's Luncheonette. I've seen bathrooms with more space than this place. I could stand up and tap at least 5 people on their shoulder if I wanted. To make matters worse,  we were sharing a table with another couple, and the table felt like it was made for two, while the 4 of us tried to make due with the situation. However, while this place is clearly made for an entry of 10 at a time. The food was great. I believe that's why it seems to stay busy because not only was there a line of customers waiting to get in, the carry out line was growing by the minutes as well. I ate the lumberjack special and everything tasted awesome. I didn't finish because it was so much food. So if you can get over the tiny environment I'd say definitely check this place out.",1,1,1
24,Brittney R.,"Valencia, Santa Clarita, CA",0,6,5,5.0,10/29/2018,I live in California but this is better than California's breakfast! When I travel to NYC this is the first breakfast place I go to! The staff is so nice ! Food is great & also very clean. If your debating to go to eat at this place just go! You won't regret it! Missing there chocolate chip pancakes already can't wait to go back again!,,,
25,Anthony M.,"Jacksonville, FL",789,43,129,4.0,9/5/2017,"The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because I practically had to sit on top of the Coke machine for the lack of space. But this food was AMAZING! I ordered the King Kong and left feeling like I could climb every building in New York myself. It was frenh toast made on a hoagie, topped with a hard fried egg, bananas and bacon. It was a colossal pile of deliciousness!! I really wanted sausage but the delivery didn't make it today so I had to choose the bacon but it still worked for me. I poured syrup over this delicious treat and was in pure bliss. There's nothing like coming to New York and stumbling upon precious gems like this. Stop by and tell Johny Hi!! He runs the whole operation and takes every order. Make this happen next time you're in NYC! See ya next bite!!",2,1,1

When I asked for an extra clean plate, I was given a plate with melted butter on it. I was thoroughly dissatisfied with this place. I only came because of the great reviews.Business Owner please don't do that. I rightfully posted my honest, factual review. Instead of responding with an apology followed by defense and insult just take your customer's experience and use that to provide better service. No water was taken out of your refrigerator. I take a bottle of water with me everywhere I go and I came into your restaurant with that water sir. I hope you do better!",1,1,
34,Fatima L.,"New York, NY",20,173,1340,5.0,6/25/2017,"One of the best diners I've ever been to. A mom and pop shop with AMAZING food and unbeatable prices. I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes since it seems to be the house special. I'm not normally a pancake fan but these pancakes made me change my mind. The chocolate chips were gooey in the pancakes and the bananas were deliciously sweet. I was able to eat the pancakes with no syrup and tiny tiny dashes of butter, THAT'S how good they were. My friend got the big man special and it was HUGE. 2 pancakes, bacon, eggs, and French toast. He normally has a huge appetite that one meal can't cure. His meal was so good and big he could barely finish it.I also went previously with my boyfriend who had the Greek gyro and he said it was absolutely amazing. I previously had the eggs and bacon, super simple meal that was somehow shockingly good because the ingredients were so fresh.The place is usually packed but the cooks are so fast (you see them cooking in front of you which is really cool- no concerns about roaches in this diner!). The wait is 5-10 minutes even if the place is packed (it usually is because it only seats like 15). Do your taste buds and wallet a favor and stop in.",1,,

I love breakfast food and I can't rave enough about the blueberry pancakes. The service was good and quick. Johny's made me feel nostalgic of a time when I probably wasn't even born, but I could just imagine the comfort New Yorkers felt going into a small eatery in which you could meet the owner and see their pride on their face to be serving you the best food they could make that day.

Sure, your banana pancakes are still unstoppable, but the eggs and French toast are just mediocre, and all the ingredients are super low-quality. On my way back from the bathroom, I caught sight of a box of frozen waffles thrown away (why are they using frozen waffles?).

We walked right in and sat but soon saw a line form. It's fast paced and we could soon tell they were down a man. It got backed up quick and the men taking our order were attentive and friendly but a little lost. we later learned from the cook that the real cook called in sick and everyone was just pitching in. So, I didn't even have to know that cause the food was delish! A tad over priced but huge portions. I got the banana choc chip pancakes, side of bacon and OJ. My husband got the king Kong French toast (pretty much hero bread made onto French toast with the works on top) and coffee and our bill was $28.

Counter seating with fresh greasy food being cooked right in front of you.  When my husband and I arrived there were 2 individual seats at the counter- so the staff asked a couple people to move over to accommodate both of us together. Food came out quick and was fresh and tasty.  Prices were very reasonable.Be aware there is very limited seating in here so if you come at peak time, expect to wait.  However there is also a to-go window off the street which is great if you want to order and eat somewhere else.

We got lucky and there was room in the counter. Well, after the cook asked ever so nicely to another customer at the bar to move down. Anyway, We sat at the counter and I felt like a NYC local. We watched the cook on the grill and it was a form of entertainment and beauty. He was so quick and graceful flipping French toast, cooking eggs, making pancakes. The food was filing for breakfast and it gave us the energy to keep going. My husband got something called King Kong. I kept it simple with eggs, bacon and toast.

It's the perfect no frills, quick service, good food diner experience. Maybe because it was early, it was sort of quiet with just a soft murmur of chatter, and sizzles from the flat top.

Counter seats about 10 and there's a table for four in back. People kindly shift to make room for couples etc. even after they've started eating. Owner and other coworkers are very serious about what they do and they have a system down. Price is okay for NYC but expensive for those who live elsewhere. It's a good breakfast and you get it quick tho.  It's simple inside and could use some sprucing up and perhaps a deep clean.  Orders were being faxed in when we were there. It's just that there's not a lot of room.I would go back.,1,,1

I ordered a Cheese Omelette with bacon, homefries, and toast. They cook it right infront of you because the countertop is across from the stove, so you get to see your food being made.

We didn't have to wait too long though as I think people are aware that people were waiting. Once seated, didn't have to wait too long for service. Place runs like a well oiled machine with the few staff that they have. Place is divey and not fancy. Come in with that expectation and you are good to go. I had the western omelette (came with buttered toast and potatoes). Hubby had the breakfast burrito. Surprisingly both were the right sized portions (we are used to gigantic portions served up in diners in California) and real eggs were used instead of egg liquid stuff that comes out of a bag/carton. Food was tasty. A few things to note:- No bathroom- After meal, pay at register at front- It's pretty quiet - not a lot of talking or silverware clanking or anything. - Read the menu closely and order quickly. Staff seemed a little bit annoyed by someone asking a ton of questions. The menu is pretty straight forward and asking questions is slowing down The Machine!",2,,
79,Cris V.,"Madrid, Spain",4,2,0,3.0,12/3/2017,"I've been twice in this restaurant. The first time everything was ok except for the bad manners of the waiter (seem to be the manager too) with the cook. Food was great so I decided to go again. In this second time the waiter was even more disrespectful with the cook, telling him off that he was cooking too slow. I saw the cook and I can assure that there was no way to go faster than he did.  When the food was ready to be served it remained for 5 minutes until we got it on our table. The pancakes arrived cold and one of them was burned so we asked the waiter to please change it. When we were about to finish the waiter insisted on leaving the table fast because there were people wating outside. He did it for two times so this way of discharge wasn't nice. The first time we were there, we waited for 20 minutes to get a seat but didn't see him hurrying people to leave so I didn't understand this attitude this second time. All this tiny things made the experience not as good as it could have been. This complaint is mainly against the waiter who didn't have good manners and made our sunday breakfast sweet and sour. He estado dos veces en este lugar. La primera vez todo estuvo bien excepto la forma en la que el camarero trataba al cocinero.  La comida genial por lo que decidí ir una segunda vez. En esta ocasión el camarero todavía fue más desagradable e irrespetuoso pues le habló muy mal al cocinero diciendo que estaba siendo lento cuando él no podía ir más rapido de lo que iba. Los platos estaban listos para ser servidos y tardó  5 minutos en traerlos por lo que la comida llegó fría. Además la tortita estaba quemada. Finalmente cuando casi todavía no habíamos terminado el camarero vino a decirnos dos veces  en cuestión de un minuto que liberaramos la mesa y pagásemos ya porque había gente esperando. La primera vez tuve que esperar 20 minutos para sentarme y no pasó nada por lo que no entiendo por qué nos despachó de esta forma. Esta queja es para el camarero del local porque en general el sitio está bien pero te deja mal sabor de boca las malas formas de esta persona haciendo que la experiencia no sea del todo agradable.",2,2,

Watch the chef lather up generous heaps of butter on everything you order and you will be canceling your dinner plans as you wait. No way a human can intake that many calories in a day. Can state the obvious, sandwiches etc are great. I'll just offer a personal preference instead. Order a side of coleslaw with any sandwich you order, then proceed to stuff the coleslaw into said sandwich. All of the coleslaw, all of it. Compliments the grease of the sandwich, no doesn't mask it, you want the greasy goodness here. The big man breakfast is another American standard. Offered here in all its original goodness, no fussy new age interpretation of a classic. Eggs, any style, potatoes, sausage, bacon, pancakes or French toast, and some toast. Pour on the hot sauce, mustard and ketchup and enjoy.",3,,2

That was my good deed for the day.You sit there, get to see one guy cook all your food, and just look around this place. The food was good. I had a spinach and feta omelet which was tasty cuz, hello, feta. The toast was standard white bread with butter (yum, carbs), and the potatoes were good enough. The bacon was good but not as crisp as I usually like mine. Props for the pancakes - my fave thing (again, yummy carbs). The pancakes were SO fluffy, cooked perfectly, and were slightly chewy.

I didn't even know you could find such deals in the city and especially in Chelsea. When you walk in, it's a narrow version of a old school diner, a long counter and one booth in the back. It appeared to be a lot of regulars. The waiter/chef/cashier knew their orders and names. The chef was really funny and laid back but also thorough in cranking out the breakfast orders. My food didn't take too long to come out. I did have to ask for waiter and for hot sauce. My eggs came out just right. my toast perfectly toasted and buttered and the potatoes were just right.

The staff was very attentive and made sure to get the orders out super fast. I will be having breakfast here when I'm in the city again!

109,Brian S.,"New York, NY",4,38,0,3.0,3/22/2017,"Small place that throws hot breakfast platters in your face within minutes of ordering.  The food is pretty solid, but portions are pretty small.  The breakfast potatoes very tasty.  Space is definitely not good for large groups, as there is just one booth that seats about 8 people and two tables that can maybe squish together 4.  Prices are pretty standard, but definitely not egregious.Why the 3 stars?  Well, I'm all for the classic ""NYC hustle and hastiness"" and I love that service here is a hare to the rest of the world's tortoise, but this place just seemed to overdo it.  When you have one server behind the counter trying to push customers out ASAP, literally throwing food in to-go bags, moving and flailing his arms at the speed of light, and putting every phone call on-hold for several minutes with a nearly unintelligible ""jon-ee-ho-don""...what can I say other than that it just doesn't give off that classic American diner love!

Cheap prices and filling portion sizes. Interesting combinations but still a classic diner breakfast.They seemed extremely busy with not only sit-in diners but also people coming in and out for take-out, so service wasn't the quickest.

Updated review","I ordered the big man Orders pancakes, I got French toast Orders fries, I got boiled potatoes Orders cheese on toast, I got 1 slice of toast not 2 with no cheese Asks for extra syrup and butter No butter!! I called, and the guy hung up on me with no apology Can you please listen? Write things down? If you only had rye toast when I ordered how did you make whole wheat French toast? Looks like you were caught being pretty dishonest in addition to not caring about your customers orders at all! Really annoyed, I had a terrible meal.  It's an awful start to the day.Update: To the owner who responded asking me if I'm schizophrenic.  No I am not.  Are you a competent human being? Are you a decent one? Who speaks like this? A person who uses mental illness as an insult is truly a despicable person.  You should be ashamed with yourself.  Shameful behavior! You're a business owner?! Tsk tsk!",4,6,1

Seats are first come first serve. So, if you have a party of more than 1 or 2 people. expect to wait a little bit for a seat. The food is made quickly and is exactly what breakfast/diner food should be like. The price is cheaper than most diners I've been to in Manhattan. You definitely get what you pay for.

129,Matt C.,"Wilmington, DE",11,23,0,5.0,8/25/2016,"I'll keep this brief: Johny's is everything you want in a little counter-top diner. And nothing you don't.If you're lucky enough to get a seat (they seat 14 at one time at the VERY most), you'll be treated to some of the finest diner food in New York (which means it's some of the best diner food anywhere).The breakfast offerings are top-notch. Everything I've had there, from the eggs to the pancakes to the fantastic potatoes, has been on-point. Highly recommended are any of his ""big-breakfast"" entries, if only because you'll want to sample it all. But We haven't gone wrong yet - everything, from breakfast burritos to French toast, is fantastic.And the sandwiches! I have no idea why his chicken breasts are so friggin tasty, but they're some of the best I've ever tasted - simple and delicious, and the perfect base for his awesome sandwiches (his Cubano is insanely good). But I've never seen anyone unhappy with their food - the portions are large without being oppressive, and everything is fresh and tasty.But it's the ambiance that keeps me coming back every time I hit NY. It's a tiny place, a countertop, so you get to watch them make your hot food in a tiny griddle. And watching the staff bicker while Johny jokes with the customers (and gives you a fist-bump, which makes you feel like king of the universe - Johny is a cool cat) is pretty much the only entertainment you'll need (the TV in the corner is largely ignored).If you like a diner, you'll love Johny's.",6,,1

Ive had better French toast, but it was good nonetheless. I loved the scrambled eggs with cheese, it was not watery and you can tell they used the good cheese lol. Location- They were very generous with the bacon, and potatoes.It's located in the Chelsea area, it's super small but it wasn't bad because it was only 2 of us. I would recommend this place if you have a group of people with you. I like the fact that you can see them making the food right in front of you, and the place is clean. (Think of it as a 10x nicer spot than Waffle House).The price- Omg it is suuupppper cheap, me and my sister in law had a whole meal ( eggs and cheese, bacon toast, potatoes, waffles and or pancake and juice) for $22 for the both of us. And you will be full! The main guy would took our order was super friendly and attentive. But once he kind of went to the back, I had to ask the other 2 cook 2x for butter.

As soon as you walk into Johny's, I was taken back to those early memories. Seating in the place is limited but somehow it's a plus knowing that it's the size of a regular dining room. To see the food cooking on the grill was the winner for me. The food is super traditional, so I don't have to worry about anyone sneaking any vegan, new age flavor into my pancakes. Mr. and I got the lumberjack plate with pancakes and cheddar scrambled eggs. Little one got the French toast but wasn't a fan. The French toast looked soooooo good but it was tasteless which shocked me. Great price for everything and everything else minus the French toast makes it worth coming here again and again.",2,,1

167,Murad A.,"Gainesville, FL",0,30,5,4.0,4/30/2017,Classic American breakfast spot. Enjoyed every bit of it. Nothing fancy and everything was fresh and decent. -1 star for 30 min wait time.,,,
168,Lucinda C.,"Central Business District, New Orleans, LA",12,1,0,4.0,11/19/2017,A very little diner but absolutely worth the wait! We ordered the big man each - great start to the day! Choc chip pancakes are to die for. Great service - they are extremely busy but quick to get what you need. A good NYC experience.,,,
169,Jake T.,"New York, NY",159,14,0,5.0,3/4/2017,"Tourist. First time time to NYC. Took a bus while traveling east coast and it dropped me a few blocks from Johnny's. Had no itinerary and just stumbled upon it. Super small space, but offered that intimacy with the staff that makes places feel hospitable. I'm pretty sure Johnny, the owner was our waiter and he was a very down to earth cat. Felt like a real NYC experience. The food was everything I could ask for for my first NYC diner experience at 8 AM. Classic, fresh breakfast food.",1,,
170,Mary P.,"Saint Louis, MO",3,45,0,4.0,4/26/2016,"I love a good breakfast burrito, so understand what I mean when I say this is the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. So good you might slap your grandmother. I don't know how they manage to cram so much good stuff into it without it falling apart. Witchcraft? Whatever, not asking or complaining. Very cute and very friendly place, too.",,1,2
171,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,4.0,12/26/2015,"I came to Johnny's Luncheonette after my swim at the local gym. I was ravenous and needed fast cheap food. Barely looking at the menu, I pretty much knew I wanted a grilled cheese with scrambled eggs added. Service here is fast and efficient............its a small shop where the kitchen is right in front, so you can actually see the cook make your food right in front of you. Within 5 or 6 minutes I had my sandwich, and it hit the spot. The two slices of bread were nicely grilled, and warm cheddar melted over fluffy eggs. It was simple, but it was very good, so I ordered a second grilled cheese again with eggs. The only slight inconvenience I suppose is that the place is small and cramped, when a new patron walks in you might feel them unintentionally brush against your back. Other than that no complaints at all. On a final note, I decided to try the new hipster trend of adding butter to my coffee to see what all the fuss is about. It really didn't taste all that different at all, I think the only difference is the extra 2 pounds I gained LOL.",6,,3
172,Liz C.,"Manhattan, NY",230,519,35,3.0,4/7/2015,"*** Quick breakfast spot, Small Space ***I would recommend this place if you live in the area. There is not a lot of seating and it's mainly bar stool seating. However, the food is pretty delicious; it isn't anything fancy. Great selection of options and quick to serve.",1,,

174,Thomas R.,"San Francisco, CA",10,34,607,4.0,5/26/2016,"Great value for breakfast, with fast, friendly service. I think I was waited on by Johny himself? The seating is limited- just the counter and a couple tables in back, but I liked the old-school charm. I had a basic eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast plate, with decent coffee. Looks like they have a takeout window that lets you get to-go orders without having to come into the cramped entry, which is nice.",,,1
175,Truc T.,"Houston, TX",84,213,334,3.0,5/31/2015,"let me start off by saying how TINY this restaurant is! Like seriously, seriously small. You can probably squeeze 10 customers in that space. Order the King Kong! It's different but really good! Their banana pancakes are amazing too! There are REAl banana chunks stuffed inside! The owner (or maybe the manager) has a sense of humor and tries to crack a few jokes with his customers. Some of the customers didn't find his jokes funny but I did! If you're on a time crunch then you probably should go somewhere else or order to go because you will most likely have to wait for a seat.",,,
176,Justin C.,"New York, NY",117,451,87,4.0,1/15/2015,"I'm torn, this probably would get a solid 3.5.  Came here with three friends, and, I knew this place was small, but, forgot how small.  They have about 8 stools at the counter, a table for 2, and a table that can manage 4, although not more.  If you have more then 4, don't come here, seriously, haha.We all ordered something a little different, nothing was 'amazing', but it was all pretty good.  The pancakes were the best part of my hodgepodge of food, and wish I ate them when they were warmer.  I'll go back, but so many in the places to try..",2,,1
177,Ariel C.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",14,106,52,2.0,12/10/2015,Ordered the tuna melt on pita and it was terrible. Runny with a ton of celery and very little tuna fish. When I asked the owner if I can have more tuna fish to make it less filled with celery and mayo he was extremely dismissive and told me to spread it out more evenly on the bread. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but his demeanor will not having me coming back.,3,4,1
178,Susie A.,"New York, NY",0,10,4,5.0,10/26/2016,Ok this is a diner. Two little tables and everyone sits at the counter. I love it. I'm from the UK and searched for a proper American diner and this place is great. I had pancakes with bacon and a tea. It's busy and atmospheric and friendly.

You're at a diner don't bother going for healthy options ---Jersey shore: (healthy option) came with 1 banana pancake, turkey bacon, & egg whites... really lacking flavor but the pancake was not bad!---Delcious doug: much tastier & a good portionif I came back.

180,D S.,"Louisville, KY",26,6,4,4.0,1/29/2016,My first time going to New York included breakfast at Johny's and we were not disappointed. Banana pancakes! YUM!! We sat at the counter and watched as our breakfast was being made. The only thing I am disappointed in is that we found this place the day before we were leaving. I would have gone back for another meal. I guess I have to go back to New York and to Johny's! The owners could not have been any nicer. Thanks guys!,2,,
181,Mike H.,"Simi Valley, CA",64,39,2,5.0,1/26/2016,"If you are in the Midtown Manhattan-area and need a good breakfast, head to Johny's Luncheonette. The food is great, with a setting of that old school greasy spoon you know and love. Myself, wife and my brother & sister-in-law got seated pretty quickly in the back area of the place (it's first come, first serve, no reservations). Everything we ordered was great: pancakes, egg sandwich, bacon, eggs and hash browns. Best of all, everything is reasonably priced, about what I would pay at home. Very hard to find that in New York. I'll definitely be back.",2,,
182,Lorenzo P.,"Florence, Italy",85,243,48,5.0,6/29/2015,"Wow. That's all I can say about Johnny's Luncheonette place... It's a typical diner-like breakfast establishment, 10 seats, a long bar, behind it Johnny and two helpers fix breakfasts for anyone who enter. The menu has a lot of choices, the service is quick and good, they make everything on the spot so you can't really say that things were made the night before. Banana pancakes are great, but so many other items on the list. Great place, I love ""local"" eateries and this is one of them.",,,
183,Brittany A.,"New York, NY",73,661,13,4.0,4/13/2015,"For what Johny's is, this place is perfect.  Cheap and greasy food served in a hole-in-the-wall joint.  This is a restaurant I would expect to see in Divers, Drive-Ins and Dives.  Guy - you should check out this joint!   This 10 seat restaurant is not glamorous, but authentic and grungy- as well as a bang-for-your-buck in a neighborhood of $15+ brunch specials.  The restaurant has not changed since it first opened its doors, which is perhaps why it is so wonderful.  To eat I had the breakfast burrito and my friend had the Moses sandwich.  We both left full and fully satisfied.  If you are in a rush you can also pick up something to go out of the front window without even setting foot into the restaurant.",,,
184,Sevann H.,"Minneapolis, MN",288,635,2186,3.0,9/21/2014,"Got breakfast to go from here.  Had to wait 30 min before even being able to order, then waited another 20 min for our food. Service was rushed, poor, a and hectic. This place is best suited for a single or couple. There isn't enough seating for a large group. This place is ok if it's on your way, but I wouldn't go out of my way. The food was descent, but nothing to write home about. Best thing we got was the home fries.",5,1,2
185,Cheri C.,"Brandon, MS",8,64,112,4.0,5/31/2015,"First warning- the place is tiny. But the staff is fast and efficient moving people through quickly. There were 4 in our party- 2 ordered breakfast, 2 lunch. The banana pancakes were wonderful as was the ham & cheese omelet. The Delicious Doug lives up to its name, the French fries were frozen not fresh, but good. The burger was ok- started out as a frozen patty.It was an easy 20 minute walk from Time Square. We arrived at noon and waited 5 minutes for a seat at the counter, but it's all about timing as there are 2 small tables in the back and about 10 seats at the counter.",,,

188,Asia H.,"Nashville, TN",91,57,31,5.0,12/13/2015,"My favorite part of visiting NY is always Johny's. Hands down the best banana chocolate chip pancakes in the whole freakin world, and I consider myself an expert on banana chocolate chip pancakes. Make it a part of your trip, or a part of your routine if you live here. It's pretty hole in the wall. It only seats about 10-15 people at a time. Most of the seating is at the bar where you can see the grill action go down. Don't be put off by the sites of it, it's anything but mediocre. The staff is great too. Awesome service and they are always working faster and harder than any other place I've been too. It's impressive really. Anyways, 5 stars for sure.",1,1,1
189,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,78,10,5.0,5/2/2016,"The place is rather small and can only hold about a dozen or so people, but I think it's worth the wait, given that the food is made quickly, and as everyone is sitting at the counter, it's not really meant to be a meal where people dilly-dally but rather one where people eat their food and go.As for the food, everything at Johny's is delicious and fresh off the grill, but I have to remark on their pancakes - they are large, fluffy, and always perfectly cooked! And you can add chocolate chips, blueberries, or bananas to them. Everything else is also good, but the pancakes are exceptional!",,,
190,Jay R.,"Long Island, NY",1,7,7,4.0,3/6/2016,"Fast paced place but the food is absolutely excellent I will be back for sure. Me and my girlfriend both ordered the ""big man breakfast"" which comes with two pancakes (or French toast) toast, two eggs, bacon& sausage, and home fries. Good amount of food for the money only paid $26 for both plates. Only not getting 5 stars because for first timers here, it was a little difficult to catch up to the fast pace at first in which the workers were moving. But I am sure the next time I am back being more familiar with place, it will be getting 5 stars. Unfortunately forgot to get a picture of our plates because we jumped right into it, but trust me the food is great!",,,1

195,Mike H.,"Maple Park, IL",0,7,3,5.0,7/6/2016,"I came to NY for restaurants like this - an old school diner which serves food right off the grill. We had the Famous Sloppy Johny, Do Me An Ava, and Pastrami Rueben. All of these selections were amazing, although I favored the Famous Sloppy.The service can improve a little - if you are not sitting at the counter you have to go out of your way to be served. This did not happen to us, but I saw it happen to the people sitting next to us.All in all, I loved the place. I will be coming back.",,,
196,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",1547,761,1732,4.0,11/21/2014,Nice small neighborhood work spot for my lunch break. They serve early breakfast and lunch throughout the day in this small spot that provides only bar counter service with one cook behind the counter. It's diner style but super small. You'll get your usual diner fare but the standouts are the special hero sandwiches. The munchie i ordered was roast beef cheese onions on a toasted hero. Ample portion at a cheap price. Great for a lunch but nothing outstanding which wows ya. Fries were good though. It's cheap eats with basic service.,1,1,

198,tryptophan n.,"New York, NY",0,77,0,5.0,2/9/2017,"Great, satisfying food, quick service, affordable prices.The 5th star is secured by the feeling of supporting an individual business, not a company.That sounds ridiculously trite, but it's all the things you'd want from a lunch counter.It looks like the sort of place that could go either way.  Plenty of diners sling bad food.Munchie - delicious.  While a little less original than offerings at No7 Sub and feeling less healthy (relatively) than Num Pang, it's a better and more satisfying value.Sloppy Johny - very good, lives up to the name.Could you eat there every day?  Probably not, the heavier stuff will kill you.Do you want to eat a salad every day?  Probably not, you'd kill yourself.",,,
199,Shakiyla R.,"Charlotte, NC",23,14,14,5.0,3/30/2016,So far my favorite place to eat here in the city. Very small and tight but the food is amazing. Not to mention the prices are unbeatable.
