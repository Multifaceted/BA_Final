0,Kirk S.,"Washington, DC",226,748,24,5.0,10/29/2018,"Way better than you'd expect, though the portions are indeed small.This is a Mexican restaurant attached to the Museum of the City of NY.  Strange, but not awful.  The space is large and pretty simple, kinda like an upmarket Chipotle.  The service is absolutely excellent.The food here is superb, though the portions are small.  The tacos are great, and the various appetizers (especially a melted cheese dish) really hit the spot.  None of it is particularly authentic or special, but it's all executed quite well.  You're left wanting more - something of a result of the portion sizes, but nonetheless something of a good sign.If you ever find yourself in the area, this isn't a bad choice!",,,1
1,Justin D.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",18,23,2,2.0,8/31/2018,"The long and short of it is: the portions are too small and the prices are too high. The food was delicious and seemed like high quality, but for $14.50 ($18.00 + tax and tip) for what amounts to a half cup of rice, a half cup of chicken, and a tortilla and a half cup of soup, I could do a lot better and I'm talking NYC prices. I still feel hungry. That shouldnt happen after spending 18 dollars. It's a big place and they were nearly empty and this was in the heat of the lunch rush. Not a good sign.My advice: lower your prices or increase your portions. Keep up the good work with the quality of food however. That was legitimately good.  Let me know once you've done one of those and I'll come back for more. Until then I'll be spending my lunch hour elsewhere.",,,
2,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",428,651,2820,3.0,4/15/2018,"My colleagues and I stopped at Side Park for lunch after a symposium a few blocks away at the New York Academy of Medicine. We weren't necessarily looking to eat here but the menu looked good so we decided to try it out.Side Park is located inside El Museo del Barrio. The inside is super open with lots of windows and a combination of regular tables and chairs along with a couple of high-tops. The kitchen is semi-open and almost has the look of a walk-up quick service spot. It kind of looks like the space used to be a cafeteria-type place that had counter-service options but now it has been converted to a table-service eatery. The menu is Mexican inspired with quesadillas, tacos, guac, etc. We were there on a Sunday during brunch time and as such they advertised their bottomless brunch - the price was right so we went for it. I decided to get chicken tacos; these were pretty good - two generously sized tacos with some sauce to go on top. They didn't have the biggest flavor but weren't awful either - though they were a bit on the greasy side. The chips and guac were pretty good - again not amazing (chips from a bag) but just fine. I enjoyed the drinks - the bellini and mimosa were as good as any other brunch place I'd been to and their white sangria was quite tasty. Service was good, all the staff we interacted with were friendly - overall not the best place I've been to for brunch but it wasn't awful. You kind of have to take it as it is; they're inside a museum so I don't know if going all out and being super on-trend is what they're trying to convey. Either way, there aren't too many sit-down places in the vicinity so if you're museum hopping this is a good option to stop and grab some food.",7,1,6
3,j p.,"Santa Cruz, CA",57,4,0,1.0,11/18/2018,"Avoid this place if you can. Two mediocre tacos, no beans or rice= $14. The calculation of the bill included a generous 20% tip for two people. My fellow patron had the eggs  enchiladas thing - hardly looked like two eggs were used. Sauce was bland, no rice or beans. Maybe the most disappointing meal I encountered on my 1st visit to NYC.",,,
4,Teon H.,"Los Angeles, FL",0,6,8,4.0,9/8/2018,"Nice and Clean Restaurant with great food options. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla which was loaded with shrimp and cheese. However, it needed some type of seasoning or salt. The chef should work on that. Other than that everything was great! They also have bottomless mimosas on the weekends!!!",,,
5,Elle S.,"Brooklyn, NY",298,20,0,3.0,9/23/2018,"The only reason why this is 3 stars is because of that queso fundido! Pretty bangin'. Everything else, not worth it. The shrimp & tortilla strips in the Caesar salad, were stale, old, overcooked. I asked for extra dressing on the side and got the smallest little container. Not to mention the delivery was over 20 minutes late so it was ice cold. Yuck!",,,
6,Ivelisse M.,"West Bronx, NY",60,103,233,2.0,4/6/2017,"So this place has been here, just now with a new name. It's in the museum but also has a entrance from outside. There's also a Starbucks but they don't sell all the drinks. The staff are super friendly and kind. The food is ok. I got baked Calamari and it just didn't taste all that well. It was really dried and you can taste I believe it was bread crumbs. We also got the Side Park Fajitas. The fajita was to crispy, steak was a bit salty but had taste. Maybe the menu should be reduced. Might come back to try their drinks just because that's how nice their staff were.",1,,
7,Daphane L.,"Spring Valley, NY",1,7,13,4.0,7/28/2017,"This is a great spot for authentic Mexican food. However, if it weren't for dessert I would definitely give it three stars. My group of three made it for the lunch time special which is $12.95. I got the Enchiladas which includes a drink, soup or salad, and your meal. It wasn't really a meal though. Just two Enchiladas which were delicious but not very filing. The dessert was well worth the wait. I had the Tres Leches cake and churros. If you come here for anything at all, come for the Tres Leches. It was absolutely AMAZING. Sooooo good. Come for that, for sure.",,,
8,Tj S.,"Manhattan, NY",212,7,1,5.0,9/12/2017,Excellent spot. Stopped in for an evening snack. Authentic Mexican and Latin American cuisine. Very friendly staff. Churros . and Starbucks coffee.,2,,
9,Luis A.,"Watsonville, CA",49,36,22,5.0,3/18/2018,Stopped in here for brunch to escape the cold! The Latino brunch was excellent (huevos rancheros) & service was top notch. Bottomless mimosas w 6 different flavors? Can't beat that!,1,,
10,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,150,3.0,6/29/2017,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a weekday. The place was pretty empty, so we were able to be seated right away. I go the mexican burger and my friend got the chicken fajitas. Both dishes were pretty small, especially considering the price. The burger was decent and the fajitas were alright, but not worth the overall price. Not much to write home about here.",4,1,2
11,Nikki C.,"Rye, NY",0,4,1,2.0,8/16/2017,"Lunchtime 2:55pm Asked for soup, got salad. Server didn't ask if I wanted a beverage. Asked for margarita after eating my salad, it sat at the bar for a while, went to get myself, server said he'd bring it.  Classic margarita is ok, not worth making a beeline here for. Asked for more salsa for my bland chicken burrito, after 10 minutes sever brings sour cream..sigh. He realizes his mistake right away and hurries for the pico de gillo. Overall, it's mediocre, luckily for them there's no real stiff competition in the immediate area.",,,
12,Claudia D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,4.0,7/16/2018,Great service and even better margaritas! The food was delicious as well! I really enjoyed the frozen hibiscus margarita.,,,
13,Laura H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,0,4.0,3/25/2017,2 weeks open. Stopped by for great choice margaritas after a visit to museum of city of ny.  Guacamole fair to partly cloudy but margaritas outstanding.  Great space. Setting up for jazz band and dinner prices fair. Overlooks Park so you really can't go wrong.,2,,
14,Jn D.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,0,3.0,8/2/2017,The wait was eternal for everything. The tortilla soup tasted like ketchup. The food was mediocre at best. And the place looks like a library. Don't recommend,1,,
15,Sasha F.,"New York, NY",87,2,0,2.0,4/23/2017,"This was my first time coming here with my best friend(who loved it the first time he came) and I was completely disappointed. Here are the events that followed. First, we were told that we can have a seat where ever we pleased. We choose a table by the window but the waitress made us move because it was a four person table. But later on, two people choose that same table and she said nothing to them. Second, there was a sign out front saying that there was a lunch special consisting of 3-courses for $10.95 and a brunch special of unlimited drink. We get inside and the waitress tells us that it is untrue. Third, the waitress took a over 15min to take our order and even longer to bring the food. While I was eating I asked for water FIVE times. She bought it at the end when we criticized her service. But I must say, the food was delicious and she only charged us for one dish. That's why the two stars. Moral of the story, service sucks but food was amazing.",,,
16,Rachel R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,22,1,5.0,6/4/2017,"Such a great addition to the neighborhood! Perfect for locals, like me and visitors to the park and museums.It's a cafe attached to the museum, but the space is big and bright and the food is delicious and fantastic drink specials.There is a full coffee bar and light breakfast, as well as lunch and dinner.We hosted a party of 30 for my Abuelita's 95th birthday and everyone couldn't stop raving about the food, especially the Conchinita Pibil. Staff was beyond accommodating.I'm also a fan of their lunch specials!",3,1,1
17,Melanie B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/7/2018,Just delicious!  Food is freshly prepared and presented beautifully. A great find!  Comfortable and casual atmosphere with very attentive service.,,,
18,Eduard O.,"Orlando, FL",26,25,27,4.0,7/27/2017,"Stopped in in the evening around seven for a quick bite with the kids. Staff was super nice and attentive. Guacamole  was solid, with just the right amount of kick. The kids shared the chicken fingers with a side of fries. Some of the best chicken nuggets/strips I've had in a long time. They have a decent beer/cocktail selection.",,,
19,Sno N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,78,30,5.0,9/17/2017,"I was at the gardens in Central Park and happened upon this restaurant when I was looking for a place to charge my phone in what I thought was a school.  To my surprise there was this fun looking Mexican cafe so I decided to have a bite to eat.  The food was amazing. Great portions, very authentic tasting, very homemade and fantastic prices. When I got home I told everyone about it. This restaurant  is hidden in the el bario museum which I thought it was a school at first. It's a shame the museum doesn't let them put up a sign outside or decorate the windows so more people would know about it otherwise you walk right by thinking it's a school cafeteria or something like that. I highly recommend this place.",,,
20,Lynn S.,"Floral Park, NY",3,19,15,5.0,5/12/2017,"The perfect late evening find on 5th Avenue. After a lecture at NYAM , we stopped here for a light dinner. We were six eclectic diners and each left satisfied and pleased. The margaritas were a big hit.The guacamole exceptional. Our entrees were each delicious.....the queso was tasty.  Enchiladas disappeared as they were devoured quickly. The pork tacos were savory. The staff was helpful and efficient.We almost hate to review this place because we are sure it will soon be packed every night.Plan to eat here if you are in the neighborhood or heading to the museums. Note:: the hours are different ( much longer) than the hours of the museum.",1,,
21,Angel M.,"West Jordan, UT",0,1,0,2.0,9/10/2017,"All food was wrong. Took for ever. Appetizers were brought out after our entrees. Not the best experience for what hey charge. What we did eat was tasty though. Moral of the story good food, service not so much.  Won't be back.",,,
22,Ross H.,"Staten Island, NY",0,8,0,5.0,4/23/2017,"When I review an establishment food quality and presentation is most important to me and the basis for my review. This establishment specializes in Authentic Mexican cuisine.   I have been here three times and I am quite pleased with their improvement each time.I was there when they first opened- The food was good, as I expected  (we had the tortilla soup and Enchiladas).  The second time we had sampled their Empanadas, Margaritas and Churasco Side Park- in a word , OUTRAGEOUS, this was a home run! We were pleased.  The third time we were equally wowed , this time we opted for simpler fare and tried their Burritos and Mexican Burger.I would describe this eatery as hidden gem that would not disappoint you.  As my wife stated to me- great food, great prices and good value- This is a keeper!She is nudging me to get there for brunch.One word of advice for management,  be careful of your outdoor signs cause some folks can be uptight if the messages are meant for different days and or the time of day.Otherwise,  great food and great experience!!!Bravo - we look forward to coming back!!!",,,
