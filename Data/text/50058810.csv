0,Adriana C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0.0,5.0,7/17/2018,"I have been a loyal customer to Bronx Location of the Grand Slam since 2012. I recently needed to hold a very important event and opted to go with the Manhattan location. I am so glad that I did.This location is steps away from the 1 train and a number of buses go down Broadway so it makes is really easy to travel to.The outside of the building so from the outside you don't get a feel of the beauty that awaits once you come off the elevator.When the elevator opens up, you are greeted with a beautiful chandelier and an open area. The rooms are GORGEOUS, the bathroom is GORGEOUS and the Suite for the guest of honor is extremely comfortable!I booked the Emerald room and was able to fit 12 tables, the buffet style set up, the dj and still had room for my guests to dance the night away.The decorations were stunning and the lighting made the colors vibrant. My guests were unbelievably pleased and are looking forward to attending the upcoming events I will be having with the Grand Slam.In regards to customer service, the staff here are extremely friendly and accommodate ALL of your requests with a smile. This family really knows what they are doing!! I am honored to say that I have had 4 events with the Grand Slam and I will remain a loyal customer as long as they will have me :)I highly recommend this location. Banquet Halls / Catering Halls can run sometimes as high as 10k, you won't pay that much with the Grand Slam, but they will make your event look as if you did.I have never had an issue with their staff or security team, all of the people who work here are friendly and supportive. I appreciate your venue being affordable and beautiful.There's a coat check, handicap bathroom facilities, spacious rooms, amazing decor, wonderful staff, and an overall great experience!Thank you for having us!",1,,
1,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,3.0,1/20/2018,"Nice looking space once you get inside. They have well-manicured flooring and it is very clean inside. There were lovely chandeliers hanging throughout the room. There was even a coat check booth in the hall which I thought was a nice touch. We visited for a friend's baby shower. The room they booked was big enough for eleven guest tables, a beautiful dessert/gift table, a huge tufted throne, DJ table and a set up for buffet-style service. There was even an allotted space for a bar. The acoustics was great for the music. The table decorations were also very nice.I'm taking off a star for the parking situation out front which is not their problem, per se, but was an inconvenience. Also, the elevator was broken and the staircase to get to the actual party space was serious...especially with sore legs. But seriously, if you're having a family event, you would want to make sure the elevator is working for the elderly guests and guests with strollers and children.I still consider this a nice venue that is easy to get to.",18,8,19
2,Dario R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",112,2,1,2.0,10/27/2018,Rude staff! Especially the security . Kicked a kid out of a family wedding for thinking he was drinking . So the kid came to our table (known friend of my family ) sat with us and my family had already been drinking and had drinks at our table and the security starts harassing him to leave when they could have easy checked or talk to any of the adults at the table . Feel bad for the bride since they basically ruined the party and threatened to cut the bar Â . Hopefully this place would change but for now I wouldnt rent the ballroom !,1,,
3,Gizelle V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,1,1.0,10/27/2018,"The ""security"" are the worst kind of people I have ever encountered. Incredibly disrespectful knowing they're working for my family. One of the ""bouncers"" kicked out one of our family members because they claim he was underage drinking. As they were kicking him out one of the ""bouncers"" tells us if he would have apologized from the beginning they would have dismissed what they claim they saw and let him stay. He was degrading my family as if he was superior. They kept on saying that it was my family members fault for not apologizing for something he didn't do. The bouncer who was going illegally going to let a minor drink was a heavy set bald male with a beard and his ""boss"" with dreadlocks was laughing about the whole situation. If you want to be laughed at, disrespected, and try to get degraded , please be my guest to this so called ""luxurious ballroom"" I will never again rent out this ballroom.",1,,
4,Victor A.,"New York, NY",35,203,24,3.0,10/2/2017,"I was lucky enough to be invited to a royal wedding here, a relative of an African King so I was excited enough to be attending a royal wedding and to meet the King. Like any banquet hall a lot depends on your budget and how you want things to proceed. Personally I thought the space was fine, bathrooms were clean though I noticed two of the basins in the men's room had broken taps. Only issue is the entrance is not grand, a narrow doorway and a basic sign. Plus a lack of parking at the front makes it difficult to make a grand entrance. Not sure how much they charge and if they are more reasonably priced then other establishments in Manhattan but overall it was A-OK.",3,2,2
5,Ethan V.,"Bronx, NY",78,2,0,1.0,7/15/2017,This place has horrible service. The security are are very disrespectful. They are known for kicking people out for no appreciate reason.I will never come here again.,1,1,
