0,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",58,192,104,5.0,7/16/2018,"My partner and I walked into a half-empty bar during happy hour. The tunes were gay-fab and we were the youngest people in there by probably three decades. Grabbing the first round of gin and sodas we agree that the well drinks (served in beer glasses) were effin' strong.During our first round we hear someone softly humming to a song playing on the jukebox. The bar tender yells ""DON'T F*** UP MY SONG HENRY"". Henry, a younger man, quiets down. I approach the bar and ask for another gin and soda and whatever beer they have going for happy hour. Henry leans over to me and says, ""you want a bud light."" That's when the bartender snaps at Henry: ""WILL YOU LET ME DO MY F***ING JOB, HENRY."" While he's busy giving Henry a piece of his mind he starts pouring the gin for my drink, and keeps pouring. Eventually he finishes the bottle of gin and cracks another bottle- he fills my glass full of gin with about a quarter inch to spare (naturally for the soda).Now, I can generally hold my liquor pretty alright. But when the drunk queen at the bar who kept hollering ""I DONT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, I LOVE LESBIANS IN HERE"" at us sent us a third round I was getting a little concerned. I haven't staggered out of a place like that in a long time.If there could more ladies in here I'd swear I would just move right in. Bless this mess.",3,4,2

I was with 2 out of town friends and he ruined their impression of our city. This bartender holds no candle to the kindness of our community. He's 100% asshole. After letting him know he turned away 3 regulars, he told us ""fuck you"". His words, not mine. That's the kind legacy 9th Ave saloon gives their regulars.",2,,1

3,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,4.0,3/2/2018,"This no-nonsense, unpretentious gay bar is one of my go to places in Manhattan for happy hour. The well drinks are dirt cheap, the bartenders are friendly and attentive, and (at least most times I've stopped in) you can find a seat at the bar. Note that later at night on the weekends, it can be crowded... and, of course during special events (Rupaul Drag Race viewing night, Will & Grace viewing night... well you get where I'm going).This place touts itself as the oldest gay bar in Hell's Kitchen, and the décor inside certainly supports this statement. In other words, this is not a fancy place. It is, however, a fun place to go, and I recommend stopping by when you're in the hood and looking for some drinks and socializing!",5,3,3

14,Raymond S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,8/2/2017,"I have been going to Saloon for years.  Tonight was different. The bartender whom is not very Nice in general had taken my order after I had been at saloon for a good half hour to my utter shock when I went to the bar area to order another drink under my credit card was a skip that had on word written on it ""STUPID"". All the other cards had the persons name written on the slip. When I asked the server Don what the STUPID was all about, he explained that I had taken forever to order because I was socializing and that I would probably not leave a good tip.  I have a message for you Don and the owners of 9th Ave Saloon.  I have many friend that meet me the for drinks and I have never been disrespected in any way accept for tonight. I have dear friends who work at Saloon and I feel, it felt comfortable there.  This was humiliating and he acted like I was a pest and not really welcomed there.  Don is never really nice to patrons and has never been at all nice to me but tonight he crossed a line.  If I am in your establishment and order one drink or 20 I should be treated with respect for supporting your establishment.  I will not go to saloon while Don is working and will advise my friends no to go either. There are so many choices in NYC it is not a need to go to Saloon but a choice. This guy Don is bad for business.  You never degrade your customers especially in front of their face and to the detriment of the establishment you are representing. Don is simply thinking about his own financial interests.  This is the first time in my life I didn't tip a person.  He is petty and I don't think that he should have a job serving the public with that attitude. I brought over the bouncer to verify what I saw on my bill slip and he encouraged me to call management.  I will be doing just that. I highly do not recommend saloon when Don is working which would be Tuesday night.  One side note: despite the fact that I could plainly see my own card with the note under it, I could also see the cards of 3 other people the names and numbers on the cards, not a smart thing to do Don in this day and age of CREDIT CARD IDENTITY THEFT.",8,,

Updated review","Absolutely terrible place. Several years ago, I thought it was great. I now consider it a public menace, a detriment to the community, and I believe it should have its liquor license revoked.I have witnessed and experienced direct, physical assault and subsequent slander by employees of this establishment. After some staff turnover, I was hoping it had improved, but it has not, and that indicates there is a much more serious problem here than one dangerous employee. Over the course of the past couple years, I have collected video of their staff physically attacking several customers, jumping over the bar, attacking people on the street in front of the establishment, and lying to police. Customers have had their heads bashed against the sidewalk, glasses thrown at them, phones grabbed and thrown to stop video recordings, clothing torn, and more. Apparently none of these acts are considered worthy of termination by the nearly-impossible-to-reach management, and the staff appears to circle the wagons to protect one another from prosecution or termination. I cannot urge you more strongly to avoid this place. However, if you do not steer clear and you are attacked or abused here--or if you witness an attack or abusive behavior--file a complaint with the state liquor board at tran.sla.ny.gov/JSP/comp… and with Community Board #4 (follow protocol here: (nyc.gov/html/mancb4/down…). File a police report for any violent acts. Take video and note the identity of the perpetrator. If you are in immediate danger, remove yourself but call 911 and be prepared to return and meet the NYPD at the establishment or they will not be inclined to investigate further. Expect the staff to lie about you to the police and/or investigators, to whatever management exists, and to other customers (this is why a video record is essential to any complaint). If your property is damaged or you are harmed, here is information on how to file a suit in small-claims court: nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/….If you have been a victim of this establishment's pattern of endangering the public, the important thing to know is that you are not alone and you have recourse to seek a just outcome.",7,,

Then you'll give him $7.  Then you'll stop noticing the passage of time and dissolve into the red lights and big gay jukebox. Then at 3:30, when you have a wicked buzz and a pocket full of photo booth pictures, they'll kick you lovingly out into the night.   Then the next day, if you go back, they'll remember your name and help fill in the blanks from the night before.",7,11,4
41,Eduardo R.,"Dallas, TX",2,10,1,1.0,7/19/2016,"This bar reminded me of the one at home.  The average age before 8 PM is probably 60 and then after eight drops to probably 35. Which I thought was great. The bartender at the front bar was a white guy with a baseball cap and a little bit heavy.  I went to order a drink with him and he was interested in chatting with everyone else but me. I asked him if he was single and he said yes which pretty much explained why he couldn't focus on one individual, he was busy checking  out everyone else. So I went down to the other bartender in the bar who was very friendly. He remembered my name, and I had a good time with them. I went back to the first bartender, ordered a beer and chatted with him and asked him if he was open to some feedback. Half way through my feedback to the front bartender, he walks away not listening to my entire feedback. So he told the back bartender, who ended becoming  belligerent with me...  I thought the back bartender was excellent. But he felt he had to support his co-worker and at that time it was time to go. I signed my tab and the bar tender seriously wondered why I zero tipped him. The way I was treated was worthy of a zero tip. He said he felt like he had to ""support"" the other bartender. Support? All I asked him was that it would be nice if could look me in the eye when serving me and not try cruise everyone else. Make me feel like the customer. Needless to say the second bartender who I thought was a great bartender was very subordinate to the front bartender and started treating me like crap. And I never said a word to him about the other bartender. So the bottom line is if you go, just order a drink and never give the bartenders any constructive feedback. Even if you ask them if it's ok. I think it's a good bar but very very bad service.",6,8,2

I was supposed to meet up with Scott (and I think Sam?) about two weeks ago to sort of pre-game there, then go out to a more suitable homosexual drinking establishment. The night I ended up going to the saloon, I was also seeing a play around the corner in times square. It ended up being the right place at the right time.I don't know what to really say about this place. There were a lot of old men here on a Saturday afternoon. As we approached the evening, they pretty much all left. The bartender was friendly and even lesbian-friendly (which you don't find in many gay dive bars). Rose, Jen, and I had a blast here. But it was kind of the saddest bar in the world, playing '80s music over and over and refusing to decorate the place past that decade. I think it's a good place to go for an hour, meet up with some friends at, or possibly dip in for a quick drink. But don't spend your life here, kids.

We were nearing the theater and decided to hop into the next bar we saw. The first thing I noticed was how clean this ""dive bar"" was. And then how well decorated it was. And then how friendly all the guys were. And then how interesting the clientele seemed - especially the guy with the awesome mustache wearing denim from head to toe, as well as the bartender in the cut-off tee.But I came here with one objective: Get my drink on. And so we all did! Shots were ordered, extra rounds were requested, liquors were generously poured...And eventually I began to notice the flirtatious remarks between the all-male patrons and bartenders, the lack of a TV in the bar, and the rainbow colored flags...It was at this point I thought to myself, ""There are a lot of people at a bar for 1:00 PM on a Saturday!""But I can see why. Our lone bartender was very friendly and paid much attention to his regulars. However, that resulted in spotty service here and there, but when he comes to take care of you, he makes it up by sticking around to chat for a while.The patrons are all very quirky. Couples and singles-but all parties co-mingling in conversations. The bartender also notified us that the jukebox was free as he handed us a basket of free popcorn while we hung out at the bar! The jukebox selections were made by Jarrett B and he proved that there was a good selection of songs on the jukebox. The audio was at a level that added to the ambiance without forcing any extra effort to hear and hold conversations.When it was time to leave the bar, some patrons were making efforts to insure we reached the theater on time, and the bartender extended one last bit of generosity-drinks on the house should we return after the musical!",10,5,5
52,Evan G.,"San Francisco, CA",222,730,362,3.0,3/28/2011,"Three visits here have uncovered an unusually comfortable place to have a cocktail.  The bartenders are nice, and the patrons mildly sleazy, usually sloppy, and delightfully talkative.  It's a friendly neighborhood bar, really, and you can actually hold a conversation there.  It's not fancy or frilly, and there was much discussion over whether the ""boys of leather"" flag was really legit, but this is a solid place to have a drink when you're tired of all the youth and flash in HK.  (Did I just say tired of youth?  OY!  I'm getting bitter.)",1,5,1

Cheapish drinks. Smiling pot-bellied men standing around the stools on either side of you, trying to catch the bartender's eye, trying to cruise a little, trying not to eat too much popcorn.",4,5,5

56,Kevin C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,9/26/2012,"How does one begin to describe how bad I was treated.  Kinda like the 47% that Mitt doesn't care about!  THIS  has got to be the worst gay bar/establishment in NYC ..heck the entire continent. I was greeted by Paul (5'9"" beer gut guy) who asked what I was drinking. When I said I was ok and wasn't ready to order a drink just yet.....I was told to leave the bar. They informed me that they were in business to sell drinks. I spoke to another bar tender who apologized and said he was sorry and would buy me a drink .... but since the Paul the hippo said I was not welcome I could not be served a drink no matter what. One would think that with all the hate in the world that the local bar would be a bit more kind to their gay clientele. I wil never cross that threshold of that sorry bar again. I have never been so mistreated for someone who just moved to NYC and am trying to find my way. SO UNFRIENDLY AND UNWELCOMINGSorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry bar! DO NOT support this hateful establishment",6,,2

58,Dorian D.,"Washington, DC",305,28,1,4.0,2/4/2013,This is a great dive bar and one of the few HK spots where I can hear people talking over the din of the music. So A+ for that.,1,,
59,Sara G.,"Denver, CO",79,81,3,5.0,2/18/2010,"Obsessed doesn't even begin to describe the way I feel about this place. I first discovered it by accident, as the best things usually happen. The place is a small, wonderful, divey gay bar with an older crowd. The draw for me was the photo booth - I like to seek them out. The next plus was the drinks. I am a lightweight, but these put even my heavily drinking friends to shame!  The bartenders are certainly not stingy! The free popcorn doesn't even help block the buzz. It's a great place to meet friends, especially since mine span three boroughs, so it's an easy middle-ground meeting spot.Since discovering the bar in 2008, I have been back consistently, and even had my birthday party there. We are usually the youngest ones at the bar  by a good twenty years, and the only girls, but that makes it even better, I think.And look out for karaoke on Wednesdays!",4,2,1
60,Paul L.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,86,9,4.0,3/26/2013,"Friendly staff, great place to grab a drink before dinner and chat with some locals. The very cute bartender informed us that some of the guys from the musical we just saw come in after for a drink, didn't have much luck stalking them down, but maybe better luck next time :)",,,
61,Aaron W.,"San Leandro, CA",23,29,0,4.0,5/3/2013,"A hole in the wall dive bar in between yum yum 1 and yum yum 3 where you can trade barbs with drag queens in between stiff drinks.

We intend to make this a regular stop every time we visit the city!",1,1,
66,Taylor C.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",0,31,0,1.0,1/23/2014,"I love this bar. I do. I have recommended it to so many people who went and said how much they loved it. So I was absolutely heartbroken the last time I came in and had some of the worst service from a bartender I've ever had. Even worse, I brought a friend who had never been, and now talks about how bad it is from one experience. I've been a few times, so I was surprised to learn the bartender has been there a while, since I've never seen him behind the bar before. He was short, dark hair, kind of latino looking, he went to go smoke, and while he was gone, my friend came to join me at the bar. We waited at least 5 or 6 minutes for him to come back. The other skinny bartender at the other end never even came near our side of the bar nor even looked that way.  The guy finally returns, and comes behind the bar. He sets his stuff down behind the bar and I say ""hey! can my friend get a drink when you have a second,"" and he  flipped out. He had this horrible attitude and began YELLING at my friend about how he'd been sitting there for 10 minutes before he went to smoke and couldn't order a drink then, and now wanted to be all demanding. I was flabbergasted. I said ""no he just came, and we waited for the other bartender at the other end to come over here..."" and he interrupted and said ""yeah fat chance on that happening, and no he's been sitting here for a while, I saw him,"" and other completely rude and flat out wrong and accusatory things I've since blocked out. So my friend left, and so did I. I tried calling the bar to speak with a manager, and then tried to find an email, because I work in the service industry and didn't want to be one of those people who uses this as a means to vent, but now I see I have no choice, and won't be returning until I know he is gone.",3,1,1
67,David B.,"New York, NY",129,36,25,4.0,2/23/2010,"I've past by this bar several times throughout the last few years, but only went in once last year on a late night in between bars. When I visited this first time I had fun but can't remember much of it as I was already tipsy.  A week or so ago I was having dinner with friends at Pio Pio on 10th Ave between 43rd & 44th and after we were done a group of us went out searching for a bar. We ended up at 9th Ave Saloon & didn't leave until 3:30 AM. We had such a good time! It was packed but not overwhelming, the jukebox had a great selection (I spent at least $15 on it) and the drinks were good & strong!The bartender  (John?) noticed us looking for a spot to rest our coats on and instantly advised us of a group that was leaving. From there we ordered some cocktails and beers, the bartender joked around with us, offered us free shots of Patron and made the experience even more enjoyable.  This Sunday when I had a friend in from Long Island we started at Tom & Jerry in the lower east side, and after a few drinks there ended up back at 9th Ave Saloon. We arrived at the bar at around 6:45 PM right before John started his shift and ended up staying there until 12:30 - 1 AM! Another great time. We could have gone around the corner to The Ritz for more drinks but preferred to stay at 9th Ave Saloon. I feel the patrons are more ""down to earth"" here... Great local gay dive bar.",2,,1
68,Karl P.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",1,5,1,4.0,1/28/2010,"This bar has always been very welcoming. But ""John"" makes you feel right at home.  Friendly bar tenders mostly.  Great place to meet with a group of friends, cheap drinks, low-lights, and the JukeBox is notorious for what people above have commented.  I do like to sit near the front door/ window and gawk at the passing flavor of 9th Ave. One of everything and kind passes by.  Hope you all take the time to visit this clean and friendly dive.  You'll come diving in for more!",1,,
69,P J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,5.0,5/1/2012,"This is my local standby, and the bar I go to when I'm sick of always being on point and being assessed by fashion hounds. It's the gay bar for guys who hate the New York gay bar scene. There's always a huge mix of people at this slightly run-down wooden space, from young and cute to older and whiskey-worn. It's the type of place where douchebags look in the door, say, ""Let's not go here,"" and leave -- which is why it's fun to hang out here. It's so rare in Manhattan to find a gay bar where a guy will come up and talk to you because (gasp!) he's being friendly, and not because he's sizing you up to sleep with him. Cash only, and the pours are VERY strong. Popcorn is too salty, bathroom is too tiny -- and I love it. It even has hooks under the bar for your coat. Because it's not off-putting and I don't have to comb every hair in place when I go, I feel comfortable here. I pray it stays forever, flaws and all.",,,
70,Austin A.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,30,0,4.0,2/11/2009,"finally, a proper big, gay, dive. eclectic (perhaps eccentric) crowd, very friendly staff, cheap drinks, and completely unconvenient to anyone living in brooklyn.why, oh why must you be located in hell's kitchen?i'm usually such a hater, but i can't find a reason to not like 9th avenue saloon.",1,1,2

72,Phillip L.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,269,50,4.0,2/3/2008,"This place feels like a very low-key neighborhood bar.  There was a wide array of people (age, size, etc) and felt welcoming with some cheap drinks served in glass mugs.It would be a good place to meet a friend or two for some cheap booze before heading elsewhere.  If you end up having to wait for your friend, you can peruse one of the few travel guide books near the front in their ""mini-library.""",,,1
73,McSolo M.,"Easton, PA",0,4,13,5.0,10/3/2010,"Quintessential ""dive"" i prefer working class bar in the heart of Hell's Kitchen which was a moon ago the citadel for working class Irish in manhatten and alot of rough folks. I digress...I always visit this place in part due to its proximity to Port Authority and in part as it is like any bar in PA so it is comfortable. Last friday i had my first initially awful time saved by the rich assortment of characters who march in and out. There is the dude who dances and asks for a buck. The bag man who smells but seemingly is sane. After asking permission to sit at a seat in the regulars' owned real estate, it was granted by the out-going bartender. Throw me to the queens will ya? Yes I was immediately the object of a vicious old slurring drunk queen who desired another occupant of the seat. I told him to F-off and if the person asked me to sit down I would move as I am an ouslander. Needless to say this old hag continued and not one to back down, i continued to sit. A wonderful Wendy winked as I was verbally assaulted by ""i am going to ruin u' ""ur on my shit list"" and ""do u know whom i am"" to which i retorted ""an ugly drunken slurring vicious impolite ass?"" I think that is when Wendy winked. Her wink made me think I didnt fall through the tunnel to Wonderland. I moved one seat over after asking a fine fellow if he wanted to sit there. I continued to be stared at by the hag and remarks. I simply opened my wallet and put a 20 on the bar which goes a long way at this former Cleo's. Perhaps this sign of steeled determination was enough as he left threatening his family's undertaker empire upon me.Was it a full moon? The drinks continued. An Angie Stone tune. Wendy, Paul and Mark all wonderful. More drama followed of course as different peeps entered and left. Regretably I had to catch the last bus at 11:30 when I am sure the real drama just begins.Alas, I recommend the place because it's truly odd in a comfortable, familar way. Beware, however, though the average age of most are older (its great when ur in ur 40s and there are significantly older gents abound) it does feel like 17 again...thanks annie lennox. I promise to play u angie stone and sade next stop at the 9th street.",,1,
