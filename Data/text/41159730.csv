0,,5/25/2018,107,,"Jersey City, NJ",Sarah G.,26,3.0,142,"This place was a random option that my date and I went to while we were searching for a bar that wasn't too crowded but also wasn't too empty (on a Tuesday; it was a challenge). The bartender was nice enough and she left us alone for most of the evening. The bar itself was super empty for 99% of the time my date and I were there. It wasn't really until the end of the evening that a group came in celebrating a birthday. That made the bar lively. The problem with Shades of Green is not really anything except that...I'm unsure how it can compete in an area where there are so many other bars and nicer places to go. It's an OKAY place to grab a drink... but the entire inside can be described in no other word than ""blegh"". Honestly, the worst part of it, was the fact that the bathroom didn't actually lock. It looked like it did--but I realized quickly that the door lock was broken and anyone could barge right in. This is a problem for a bar where everyone drunkingly walks around not knowing what is going on. I can only imagine that others have had issues with it themselves. Or no one has noticed that the door lock is broken (FYI I did test it too, to make sure I wasn't being crazy about the lock not seeming right. the slider goes in, but it doesn't hold the door in place.)I don't know if I would ever come back here, but it was decent enough for a Tuesday night drink.",

The woman sitting next to me said it was the worst she'd ever experienced, didn't finish her food, and left.It was not the worst I'd ever experienced, but the server was really really rude, and even though I'd purchased food and alcohol, and intended to purchase more, he was not happy with my rate of consumption. I am a small framed woman, and did not appreciate the drink pushing. Especially when there were only four people in the place. He also refused to give me water and told me I had to drink faster or leave. It was creepy AF.(Make sure to check out the Google reviews, there are too many that say ""worst service of my life."" Yeah, it's hyperbole, but most people don't throw that phrase around completely willy nilly. I wonder if it's one horrible bartender or all of them.)",1

Sometimes it's slightly less than okay, but in a way that's pretty benign.Last time I came on a quiet night and took a table. The server (table service? really?) kept coming over because he was very concerned that I didn't really have friends who were coming. He seemed pretty angry about it, even though the bar was fairly empty. My friends were not late. Then he reversed course and forced us to split into two tables. Because it was pretty empty.That pretty much sums up my experiences at this place. The service is...weird. But you could do worse. Or better. Try for better.",2

When we called the next day, the bartender told us there were no cards there even before asking when I had been in. He sounded really sketchy on the phone so we decided to go back and confront him in person. When we got there, he said he remembered us from the night before but our card wasn't there. He then proceeded to pull about 50 cards out from the register and told us ""I have all of these cards. Why would I need yours?"" I have worked at several restaurants and bars and I've never seen that many cards kept in the register. People always come back for their cards and if they have so many, it's probably because he lies to people who call and ask. He got super defensive when we asked him to look again and we eventually decided it wasn't worth it. Even though this probably won't happen to you, the service here is terrible. We came in at 2:00 am on a Saturday night and it was completely empty. The bartender was very rude, demanding our order before we had even figured out what we wanted. After we finished our drinks and made it clear we didn't want another, he shoved our checks at us and made us leave.",

15,,5/24/2017,0,,"Fayetteville, PA",Willow L.,154,4.0,157,"During the last hour of our trip to NYC, we were dropped in Union Square prior to departure.  We'd kind of had enough of crowds and expensive food for one weekend, so we went into Shades of Green to have a pint.  It was empty since they'd just opened for the day and it was also Mother's Day.The owner was the only one working, and he was on the phone when we walked in.  Even though the door was hanging open on the nice day, the emptiness of the inside made us feel like it was closed.  But, the owner let us know we could have a drink, but the kitchen didn't open until 4pm.  No problem, a drink was great.We ordered a couple of beers.  The owner meandered around, finished his phone call, and searched for sports to put on his TVs.  We sat at the empty bar, enjoying the quiet and calm. The bar looks well worn, appears to have had a lot of drinks served over the years.  The bar seats had nice cushion, and weren't worn out.  Possibly newer.  Tables were high pub tables and even though the place was on the smaller size, it could fit a good number of people.After a bit, Mr. Irish owner chatted with us a bit, and we ordered a Guinness.  He then gave us a couple of his business cards, offering up the room and board upstairs for next time we were in town.  He was a very laid back seeming person, at least at that time of day.  At one point he went into the back for a bit.  We could have easily left without paying if we were that type of people, but I guess he could tell we wouldn't do such a thing.I'm sure when it's busy and prime time, this place is entirely different.  But if you're in or near Union Square in early afternoon and want a beer, I highly recommend coming here.  You won't get food, but sometimes just a beer is perfect.",
16,,7/17/2017,269,,"New York, NY",Liz S.,0,1.0,2,"This is easily my least favorite bar in the city. I wish zero stars were an option.We came here with a group of people before heading out to a party in union square. We had arranged the large group weeks in advance to be sure not to inconvenience the bar when we got there. When we arrived the place was completely empty, obviously for good reason. The waiter was EXTREMELY pushy about getting people to order drinks before they had settled in, or the rest of the group got there. They were even refusing people water as they waited for their friends. This, unfortunately, was not even the worst of it...At the bar there is a tiny sign written in chalk that says $20 dollar minimum on credit cards. Because we were not ordering at the bar, but rather from tables in the back, we did not see the sign. Additionally, the waiter did not advise anyone about this policy as people were opening tabs. As we went to close our tabs, he told us he would not give us our cards back until we each met the $20 minimum which, until that point, we had no idea about. I would like to add that it is only legal to have a minimum of up to $10 on credit card purchases in New York City. Their practice is entirely illegal.My boyfriend and I tried to calmly explain that we weren't aware of the policy as it had not been made clear to us. Our tab was $9 and he insisted we either reach the minimum or give him cash. We had no cash and didn't want to spend another $11 on weak well drinks that we didn't even want. Nevertheless, he flat out refused to return our card. This went on for almost 15 minutes until we were able to borrow some cash from another bar patron. This also happened to a number of people in our group. This behavior is completely unacceptable. We were responsible for the majority of their business that night, and without our group the bar would have been effectively empty.This was a terrible experience. I'm honestly in awe that they are even still in business. People go to bars and happy hours to enjoy time with friends after a long week, not to be berated, tricked and milked for money on a policy that is ENTIRELY unnecessary, unclear and illegal.The bar is unpleasant, the floors are dirty and the ambiance is gross even for a dive bar.

I was meeting friends there, so I didn't choose this place. When I got there I found two of my friends sitting at a tiny table just inside the door. They had been told to sit there even though they informed the person who told them where to sit there would be others. This became a real problem when the other 5 people showed up and we were all crowded around a table meant for 3 at the most. It was happy ""hour"" (runs about 6 hours) and there were specials. $5 draft beer and $8 appetizers. I ordered chicken tenders and potato skins. The $5 draft was good. The appetizers, another story. The potato skins consisted of what appeared to be one normally sized skin cut into 4 pieces. There were 4 ""chicken tenders"" which were not chicken tenders at all, but were small cut up pieces of chicken that were over fried. Quality wise, the potato skins were almost ok. The chicken ""tenders"" we're dry, but tasted ok.The service was slow, but not so much because of the server. It was because one server was very overwhelmed.Be warned that there is a $20 credit card minimum. Crazy, for a dive bar, huh?I'm giving the place 2 stars because of the location.",

He happened to just be bartending for the first time and I went to wait at the bar for my group. I sat on the side with no people at it, since people would be joining me and he said ""why are you sitting there, I can't work down there, everyone is here!"" I ended up just leaving. My group will be spending our money elsewhere moving forward. I used to love this bar because everyone was so nice and it was never crowded and affordable.

My buddy and I stopped in last night - there are maybe 8 other people at the bar.  We order drinks and dinner.   25 minutes go by and I cannot get another beer for the life of me.   The bartender completely ignored us.  Each time I would try to get his attention he would turn the other way.  The guys to the right of me apparently knew the bartender and were laughing at this.   Finally I had to raise my voice (as we were waiting 40+ minutes for a salad too) and he comes over and slams two bottles of beer down at me.  My buddy didn't want one but whatever, I'll drink both.  A short while later our food comes out.  I requested a dressing for my salad and was strictly told, ""NO.""   We thought he was kidding but the bartender never came back again except to give us our check.   Yes, he really did say NO.   Not ""I'm sorry we do not have balsamic vinaigrette even though it's listed on the menu.""  Instead just a stern NO.   We then get our check and notice we were overcharged for our beers.  The sign outside said 5 dollars but he charged us 5.50 and then proceeded to make up his own tax on the bill!   Absolutely ridiculous!  Lucas, if that is your name, I hope I never have you as a bartender again.   Shades of Green, don't count on us ever stepping foot in there again!",

I went in tonight and asked to see the drink menu, and there was no menu for cocktails, so I went for a safe choice and asked for an old-fashioned. The bartender gave me a drink with whiskey and cranberry juice - it was pink. There is no version of an old fashioned I've ever had with juice of any kind - it's usually whiskey, bitters, water, a sugar cube, and an orange peel or a cherry. I double-checked on google, and the internet confirmed that that is the recipe. When I politely asked for an old fashioned without cranberry juice, he was really to fight - he gave me a speech about how he had given a generous whiskey pour, had done nothing wrong, the fault was mine for not asking what he would put in it ahead of time, and would charge me for both. My friend and I couldn't believe it. This would have been an easy problem to avoid or fix. I will never be back.",

AMBIANCE: looks small from the outside, but there is a fairly large bar area as well as smaller tables on the side and a large area with bigger tables at the back.

Managed to catch the tail end of their happy hour. Bar was empty except for one other patron, so we had our choice of seats. We were served by a really friendly, very accomadating waitress who suggested the chili. We also got the shepherd's pie and chicken fingers. FOOD: Chili was the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.

The little quirks of a bar I can deal with - a server being rude to customers, nope.  (Not that I think the owners would bother to check Yelp or care).  I try to be chill and respectful of anyone serving the public, but this guy clearly didn't care, so no wonder people are avoiding this place.One star because of the $4 drinks and one for the nice bartender - and it was large enough for a group, but run unless you want extra hostility served with your fries.  Should be renamed to 'Shades of Red'.",

It's set up long way so the bar portion is towards the front as you walk in and the restaurant seating is in the back. Besides the stools at the bar, which is to your left once you enter, there are some high top tables and stools along the wall on the right side. There are a few TV's behind the bar usually showing sports.There's plenty of seating towards the back. They usually have specials on the menu. The burgers are really good here.

Our server was so inattentive and only had a few tables - we never got glasses of water that we ordered and he brought a wrong drink order to our table, and then acted like we should be thankful when he offered we could keep it on the house. One person in our party ordered a burger that came out missing toppings and with unmelted cheese, and an appetizer was not brought until after the meal.

He says he has had some dissapointing customers today as well (wth!) then states how busy they are to finally apologizing.

Not something I have been used to in this place on previous occasion. Anyway just as we were about to leave a guy who was taking over from her behind the bar started to scream and shout and her for what seemed like no reason. The whole place could hear and it was extremely uncomfortable. The poor girl was mortified and the bartender who has never been very friendly any time I have been there, continued his rant! When I thought things couldn't get any worse another guy who I later found out to be the manager of this so called bar then began to scream at her! So so unprofessional and a disgrace how they treat there few decent employees. Especially when the place isn't that great to begin with.
