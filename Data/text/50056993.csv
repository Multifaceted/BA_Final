Updated review","This place is crawling with lawyers and police officers (so be on your best behavior! jk). A typical hot-bar and salad restaurant, what Civic has that really puts itself above the rest are: 1) the free drinks with $7 purchase, 2) super fast lines, and 3) delicious hot sandwiches. I normally don't come here for the hot bar food, which usually runs dry and tough by around 1:15 when I arrive. Their selection is also pretty repetitive and doesn't change. I would recommend the sushi, the pastas, and their fish, but stay away from their calamari and fried ""shrimp"" as those are either really tough or a bit funky. My usual order is the small bowl of salad with bacon, fried chicken, sweet corn, avocados, and low fat ranch (muy delicioso!) and even if the lines look a little daunting, it's all pretty quick. The Chicken Colby, the Roast Beef, and the House Special sandwiches are all great too, but those usually take a little bit longer to make. The meatball is also pretty filling. All of these sandwiches are massive and an intelligent man would split it into two meals but... yah... I'm as smart as a fish and if I see food, I eat that shizz. If your order is over $7, which it almost always is, you get to grab a soda or a water on your way out. Sweet! A way better deal than you will get at most places.",1,,

The inverted roll was better than the regular futomaki. Not all selections are always available, but there is a good variety to choose from.  If you buy 6.00 worth of salad bar food or sandwich over $5.00, you get a free soda or small water.  There is also a counter for sandwiches and create your own tossed salads. Lining one wall are several refrigerators for drinks and an open refrigerator for popular beverages like coconut water, flavored teas and waters.  In the back, there are shelves of chips.  Dependable and convenient, I find the food tastier here than the other 2 salad bars located a block or two away.  They make sure the wait to pay is almost non-existent with their speedy efficiency.",2,,1

Civic salad bar is usually cheaper anyway- they are pay per topping toppings range from 50 cents (most veggies) to 1.50 (meats).  Spending $7 on salad gets you a free drink. The paninis and sandwiches are good too. Paninis come with chips (can substitute pickles). They're very generous with the cold cut sandwiches. Spending a certain amount ($6-8?) gets you a free drink too. I find the burgers and hot buffet food here to be less greasy than other delis.,,,
18,Gary D.,"Queens, NY",2,25,10,3.0,3/14/2016,"I come here pretty much every day for breakfast.  I always get two bagels and cream cheese.  They charge $2.00 for a bagel with cream cheese, which is a good deal.  The only thing I don't like about the breakfast service is that when the man behind the counter sees me on the line he starts preparing the bagels right away, so they're ready for me almost immediately - sometimes, they're ready before I get to the front of the line, I can just walk right up and take 'em to the register.(I know most of you would consider that excellent service.  And you're right.  But what if I wanted something else instead?  I'd rather have the guy ask me if I want the usual, even if means I have to wait another minute or two.  But that's just me.)Lunch sandwiches are good.  I've had bologna and cheese, ham and cheese, and tuna with mayo.  Be aware that if you ask for mustard on your sandwich you're going to get the spicy kind - this seems to be standard at all delis, the mustard the deli men use is spicy .  Even if you ask for just ""a little bit"" you're at their mercy as far as their interpretation of ""a little bit.""  (This is true at any place where someone else is applying the condiments.)  If you like spicy mustard, no big deal.  If you like plain yellow mustard, as I do, they sometimes have packets available - but check the packet to make sure it's not spicy.The free can of soda or water deal is good.  You have to spend at least $6 on a sandwich or $7 on the salad bar to get the deal, but it helps to increase the overall value.  I once ordered a bologna and cheese sandwich from another deli (a place on Duane Street), and was shocked to find that they wanted $6 for it - with no free soda!  I walked right out of there and left the sandwich on the counter.  At Civic it's $5.50, but with, uh, ""tax"" it comes to $6, making it eligible for the free drink.Seating area, as others have pointed out, is virtually non-existent.  This is not the place to go if you're looking for a sit-down meal - a few seatls alongside the window with a head-on view of Worth Street is all they offer.  Most people get their orders to go.",,,

30,Monique R.,"Brooklyn, NY",899,909,538,3.0,4/11/2011,"With the many generic deli's in the neighborhood, this one is no different from the rest. If you have been to one hot/cold buffet by the pound, then you have been to them all. But I have to say that aside from their prices being borderline high,  the set up is really nice. There is a decent sized buffet table setup when you first enter the store. My advice is to come early because this stuff can sit out for a while. Sure, the changeover is high during lunch but there is that lull between 2 and 5 where the food sits there waiting for comsumption and that can easily turn into a no bueno situation. But this place has everything from salads, soups, snacks and coffee- not including the offerings at the buffet. The ladies that work the register are quick and the line that usually wraps around the back of the store goes really quickly. They have mastered multi-tasking but do pay attention because sometimes they are too fast and over charge.

I haven't had the courage to try the salad bar, but it looks as if it's passable as well.

45,Emily M.,"New York, NY",136,285,45,4.0,3/26/2010,"I've put off writing this review, because i was so embarrassed that people may find out how often I've been eating at a deli salad bar. i have to street that this is no ordinary salad bar. the vegetables are very fresh, and everything I've tried has been well cooked and well seasoned... really not what you'd expect from a salad bar. All stations of this place are absolute chaos during lunch time. Another reviewer wrote that point as a negative, but i think its evidence of how good the food is considering how many options there are down here. the cashiers are superhuman speedy; they literally begin ringing you up before you reach the counter and hustle you right out the door. its quite amazing. also, they don't really publicize this, but there is a big bucket of soda and bottled water by the door, and every customer can take one on their way out as a free gift. how great is that?",1,,
46,S R.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,4.0,10/12/2012,"Yesterday, we were at 100 Centre Street courthouse all day and at lunch, we asked a court officer for a place to eat and where we could sit (love food vendors, but we needed to sit).  He could only recommend Civic Deli because it was close by and reasonable.  I wanted to spend less than $10 per person.  Friend and I went there at 12:30 PM and saw the bustling little place with a large, clean salad bar and sandwich counters.  I ended up spending $21.81 for the two of us (two ample salads and two cans of soda) and frankly, I have no regrets though above my preferred range.  Of course, if we didn't EACH have a ginormous 1 1/2 lbs. salad each, it could have been much cheaper.  But we were hungry having each skipped breakfast and we were greedy when we showed up.  Both the hot and cold sections were very fresh and good quality.  The hot section had a better selection in my opinion, but the variety in the cold section is still decent.  Each of our salads were a good 1.5 lbs. each, LOL, and we were happily stuffed.  The food quality is very good quality.  Mine was a hodgepodge of things and overall good; a pleasant surprise was a dark green seaweed stuff (I thought it was kale for some reason, LOL) and it was great.  My friend went nuts over the large battered fried shrimp and she went for a lot of pasta mostly.  Seating is limited to two sets of four stools at the window.  We had to wait less than five minutes and usually people move reasonably quickly (eat and run).  We were both slow eaters and tired (worn out from a long morning at court), but great.  If we come downtown again, I plan to eat here again though smaller (if still delicious and fresh) salads each.",,,
47,Undercova A.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",0,402,202,4.0,3/24/2009,"Clean, busy and competively priced.  Very much a business crowd.  Avoid the 12:45 -2:30 p.m. lunch crowd.  Sandwiches are stacked, salad bar is kept cootie-free.  Some sushi, half sandwiches and soups.  My ""go to"" lunch place.",1,1,
48,Tricia S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0,4.0,11/16/2007,"The financial district lunch options can be dismal, but bravo to Civic Deli for their excellent hot and cold bar.  I am continually delighted by the cold salads (the avocado salad, the bean salads, all are wonderful), and the hot entres are consistent and offer considerable variety.  The place is also tidy and clean.  Sometimes you get tired of having deli sandwiches.  Thank you, Civic Deli, for offering me a genuine meal at lunchtime.",2,,2
49,T L.,"New York, NY",5,94,74,1.0,12/11/2011,"Gave the sandwiches here a second chance and no luck: yuck.  Messy, dripping sauce all over, cheap paper wrapper saturated and adhered to the melted cheese leaving me to wonder if it was cheese or bits of the wrapper I was eating.  Pretty sure it was both...yum.    The turkey-something sandwich smelled odd and the eating surfaces were all dirty.  By the time I finished this sandwich it was a sloppy, soggy, indiscernible mess that left me dirty and sad.  And just as I thought I'd blocked the whole experience out, later in the day I was mocked by sauce stains I discovered on my jacket.  Crap.  Maybe the other offerings are ok, but when it comes to restaurants I'll patronize, it's two strikes and you're out.  I do recommend the Tylenol behind the counter, though.  It works and tastes fine, too.  Next time I'll go hungry though.  That was 5 hours ago and I still have the heebie jeebies.   Ugh...",,,
50,Chris F.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,246,13,4.0,6/27/2005,"A reliable lunch place accessible to the courthouse district, Civic Deli offers pick-your-own-ingredient salads, a wide array of hot and cold sandwiches, and a pretty good hot bar.  The food's of reasonably high quality, especially in comparison to other delis just uptown.  Civic offers a free can of soda or bottle of water with sandwiches or 1 lb of hot bar food, although if you forget to get it or don't see the sign, no one's going to remind you.  The sandwich and salad lines can be a bit slow when waiting for your food, but the insanely efficient checkout process smoothly streams dozens of people through the line in mere minutes.",1,,
