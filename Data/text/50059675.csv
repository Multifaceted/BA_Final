0,Seth S.,"Chicago, IL",2,11,0.0,5.0,3/30/2017,Great service and excellent food and drinks. We ordered the lamb and ox cheek and both were fantastic. For a Thursday night very busy and a nice overall ambiance. Highly recommend!,1,,1
1,Jade B.,"Brooklyn, NY",251,147,460,1.0,4/15/2017,"I was starving and didn't eat anything all day so when I came here to meet up with my friend for happy hour, I had to get something in my stomach before downing a couple drinks. I figured the scallops would be filling but when it came out I was shocked at how small the dish was (for an entree!). And even more crazy was that the plate cost $27!3 scallops, 3 thin carrots and some peas doesn't really fill anyone.  I was still left hungry and had to find another spot to eat.  Besides that, the rooftop view was beautiful. It's a must see especially at sunset.",2,1,

3,Jessie G.,"Nashua, NH",39,21,12,5.0,5/18/2017,"We were hosting a business dinner here and did the chefs tasting, our server BRADLEY WAS AMAZINGLY attentive and thorough.  We started with a cold corn and jalapeno soup, followed by a tuna tartare, followed by a roasted chicken breast(WHICH THE SKIN WAS UNREAL), finished by two different desserts a lemon miranguey thing and some sort of stacked cookieish desert.  The drinks paired with each course were amazing, some were wine, others were cocktails.  They were in the process of setting up outside dining when we arrived, I think it will be amazing when finished, it's in the back of the restaurant so you get a bit of privacy from the street.  If you go I recommend requesting Bradley- he is an actor and full of FUN knowledge.  ENJOY!",,,
4,Frannie R.,"New York, NY",4,25,1,5.0,3/11/2017,"OMG, who knew that this place existed? Tucked in the double tree hotel (they don't deserve a restaurant of this caliber)The octopus and scallops were DeeeVINE! The place is gorgeous! Luvs it",1,,
5,Sam C.,"Southlake, TX",69,214,131,5.0,4/18/2017,"Hotel restaurants are usually designed for traveler convenience more than fine dining.  This is probably more so in NYC where there are literally thousands of restaurants within a few miles of wherever you might be staying.   I stopped into Magnolia Restaurant for just such a convenient meal when I was shocked to discover how good the food is.    Artisanal breads with the best butter I've seen outside of Europe and an Octopus tapas-style dish that was as good as anything I've ever had.  All this tucked in the back of the lobby of the Doubletree Times Square West.  If the rest of the menu is as good as my late afternoon snack, I would certainly go out of my way to come to this fine dining establishment even with all the other options nearby.",4,1,
6,Tifenn S.,"Laurel, MD",0,1,0,1.0,5/28/2017,"Just an awful management : we went there to eat, a waiter just drop a plate  full of ketchup on my husband coat, the manager came to apologize and promise us to pay for the cleaner bill, we sent it asap and now we are still waiting for more than 3 months!! I sent emails, I called they still promise they will see it and nothing !!don't go there it's a waste of time,  the food is no good either!!!",1,,
7,Wanda S.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",2,27,6,1.0,11/25/2017,CLOSED! We walked and walked trying to find it. Finally realized we had passed it twice because no signage was out. It is closed,,,
