0,Qurat K.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",340,177,580,5.0,8/13/2018,"D.B.A. is a dog friendly bar that has a variety of local beers and a range of liquors. It's a bar with a dive vibe without the smells or low quality. Don't want to be trapped in a dive bar vibe? Head out to the backyard area that has more of a California vibe with it's lighting, structures, and seating. Having a double date with you and some dog owners? Reserve a space out back. There a few arcade games spread out through the bar if you don't want to actually spend too much time talking to your date. Actually want to talk to your date? There is some secluded seating near the booth type areas and corner area of the bar. A bar for all types of occasions!  Oh yeah and the bartenders are fun to talk to here, as well!",1,2,1
1,Lisa M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",295,52,70,1.0,8/4/2018,"Well I had quite the awkward encounter here. After waiting 30 plus minutes at the bar, being consistently ignored by the bar tender, I was finally able to order 4 beers and 4 shots. I'm not gonna lie, I didn't leave an amazing tip, but what happened next was totally bizarre. The bar was packed but the bar tender still had the audacity to literally run after me as I was walking away, waving the bill in my face, shouting asking me if there was a problem with the service. I was so embarrassed!!  I didn't want spit in my drinks so I waited until I left to tell Brian what a dick move he pulled.",4,2,1
2,JJ V.,"New York, NY",209,9,2,5.0,7/20/2018,"Went today with my pup Frank, the French​ Bulldog. Great place to bring your pup! No food, but you are welcome to bring your own. Will 100% be back, very few places in NYC that allow you to have your pup!",1,,
3,Joe P.,"NOTTINGHAM, MD",308,17,13,5.0,11/13/2018,"Came here for happy hour just for drinks and I had a very chill time. A huge plus I noticed was the backyard and dog friendly rule. The backyard was nice because of the way it was set up and the lights. Definitely a date spot, but got no time for dates so I sit at the bar...What really disappointed me was that the bar didn't have any basic beers like blue moon...jk..wasn't disappointing. I really loved that they only sold crafted beers, and had a huge selection of them. I love beer, so having the opportunity to try out new beers is a plus. The bartenders were mad chill and nice so it made our visit comfortable and easy going. Good HH place!",,,
4,Nick W.,"New York, NY",358,5,1,1.0,11/8/2018,Absolutely horrible service. Good deals and specials but understaffed and then blame customers who get frustrated with poor service. One bartender was clearly drunk and informing other customers that I was upset with her for being so unprofessional. Would not go back!,,,
5,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,5/7/2018,"I've passed this bar for years, and am a huge fan of their sister bar in New Orleans, but never had a real reason to go. I needed somewhere low-key to meet a friend, so we headed here to take advantage of the warm weather on their back patio. Unfortunately, they close off the backyard at 10 pm on weeknights, so we only had a few minutes to savor the night air before being shuffled inside.Inside wasn't too bad-- dim lighting, a late twenties crowd, a couple TVs with sports but more of a dive-y atmosphere. There's a photo booth in the back. Bathrooms are a little grungy. Dog friendly.The beer list is massive and a little bit geeky (no mass market brands, though you'll see the usual craft beer suspects). They have BeerAdvocate ratings and ABV clearly displayed. Prices are typical NYC, with most pints and bottles around $8 and up. I did a gose which ended up having a nice raspberry taste. My friend ordered an IPA but the bartender must have misheard her as what she received was clearly a stout. It's a chill bar so I'll try to make it back for a summer night on the patio.",4,2,1
6,connie c.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,113,20,4.0,10/27/2018,Love this dive bar with a mix of rock music and hip hop. The bartenders are so fun and took care of our bachelorette party. Got the whole bar to sing for our bride.,,,
7,Andrea G.,"Manhattan, NY",16,70,80,5.0,4/29/2018,"I don't want to forget this bar!! So many adorable dogs . Came here on a Sunday afternoon for the first time and was surprised right away by the beer selection. Nothing basic about it. A few TVs to watch sports, but not somewhere I'd do for a big game. All the dogs made me so happy! Come here alone or with a puppy and they have an open outdoor seating place.You can also order food from seamless and have it delivered here which I thought was cool.Highly recommend.",1,,
8,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/29/2018,"If I could give a zero I would!!! Went in with a group of friends for a drink on the way to dinner. They singled out our Hispanic friend and threw him out of the bar, and gave no actual reason for doing so. Our friend bought  a round, PAID THE TAB, and then they decided to kick him out. We are about five years older than the typical demographic of this bar and about five times more sober yet he, the I only non white person around got kick out. As a white female I have never been in this situation personally and this honestly disgusted me. Will never in my life set foot into this racist bar. Disgusting!!",1,2,
9,Kara M.,"Raleigh, NC",384,1072,9837,5.0,7/5/2017,"***400th Review***We were in here 3 different nights on our trip to NYC at the end of March!  This was about a 10 minute walk from our lodging.  This spot had two things I wanted:1. Happy Hour2. Dog FriendlyYes, a pet friendly bar!  Apparently since they do not sell food, this bar allows dogs.  There is a nice outdoor space in the back, it's covered and heated.  A couple of the dogs were running around on the patio and making new friends.  I was traveling with my five pound Shih Tzu, he was happy to sit on my lap, but I appreciate that I could bring him in.The happy hour was pretty good for NYC.  The hours for the discounted drinks were fairly long on the weekdays that we were in the city.  There was a limited selection of pints of beer and well drinks for $5, not bad for Manhattan.  I believe I had some Abita Light, which was not too bad. I liked the casual vibe in this establishment, this isn't a pretentious bar where you need to worry about dressing to the nines.  We had some nice chats with various customers on two of the visits and I would say it was a friendly crowd.  The youngsters were all very polite to us 30 somethings! One of the girls I was chatting with mentioned that people use the back patio of d.b.a for dog birthdays, which is cool since this was also a popular event to have in Los Angeles (where we used to live).  I would definitely come back if I was in the area!  There is another pet friendly bar in Brooklyn, but we didn't make it over there.",4,3,5

13,Elizabeth K.,"New York, NY",297,141,53,4.0,1/13/2018,"Such a solid bar in the east village. Thought it was pretty funny that they had a sign on the wall that they dont sell Corona/bud/miller etc. Good thing they have such amazing beers on tap! Bartender was super nice and let me try a couple before deciding.It was pretty crowded for a Friday night around 8 pm. They have happy hour monday through friday until 9 pm with 5 dollar well/draft/wine. SCORE! They don't serve food, but it looks like you can bring food in. Plenty of pizza spots nearby that you can grab a slice at.I like that they have a patio to the back...that was actually way more packed. Seemed like a huge group of friends were hanging back there. A few tables up front at the bar that my friend and I sat at.Did I mention it is dog friendly? :)",,,
14,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,1/3/2018,"This is a great go to bar in the area. My sister hosted a going away party in the back patio area, and it was a perfect space for the occasion. They allow you to bring whatever food you want, which made it an inexpensive way to come together to drink and eat with only having to purchase drinks. Friends were also able to bring dogs which is always a plus in my book. Given how crowded the bar was inside, I was pleasantly surprised how fast I was able to get the bartenders attention each time I went in to order a drink.I'd definitely recommend this bar, especially if you want to organize any sort of event and use the back patio!",,,
15,Steve M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,10/24/2018,DBA is an incredible bar with the best looking bartenders i've ever  seen. They also have a regular that looks and sounds like Ray Ramano,,1,
16,Marisa S.,"Queens, NY",325,14,3,1.0,10/27/2018,"The 45 year old dashboard confessional bartender probably used to get beat up when he was younger because he's a miserable C U Next Tuesday. He is so rude, unprofessional and is a person that contributes to a society that's full of hate and discrimination. I have a friend who happens to be homeless and he has a super friendly dog so I wanted to take him and the pup out for some afternoon drinks during happy hour. (Keep in mind my friend actively showers, washes his clothing and doesn't walk around with 90bags but even if he did it would matter) anyway, we walk into the bar and there are no customers cause it's 3pm on a Friday and we sit down at the bar and as our behinds touch the chair, the rude bartender who should not be a bartender or simply go work in a hate state where he belongs walks over to my friend and says you can't have that backpack in here!! ""We have a policy against people bringing in houses on their backs"" and we both look at this dude like what? My friend said I have one backpack and it's 35 pounds. He's like no this is our policy and u don't have to like the policy but that's what it is and I said to the d-bag bartender what if we just put down my credit card and open a tag and he said no. Then my friend said to me let's just go and my friend said to the b-bag you're really an a**hole and the dude said now I know I made the right decision cause you're cursing at me. All I can say is WOW. That experience was so rude, so hurtful and sooooo uncalled for. There was no policy against his backpack in an empty bar this bartender just decided he didn't like my friend and treated him like garbage.",,,

19,Marian W.,"Manhattan, NY",109,83,244,3.0,12/30/2017,"This place has so much potential. The extensive beer selection, the large space, the happy hour specials are all great. What is very disappointing is the service and the crowd it attracts.We came before the happy hour crowd burst onto the scene. We said ""what a find!"" We said, ""what great beers!"" They have a large selection of beers separated by type. What was nice was they also included each beer rating on the board. We were happy with our drinks but will probably not be back unless it's a quiet day. The tiny crowd was loud and obnoxious. The service was slow and full of attitude.",2,,
20,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10944,4.0,11/10/2016,"Solid low-key place for happy hour that has a fairly large backyard and an excellent rotating selection of craft beers. I've come in here only a few times but I like it enough that I'm almost willing to make it a regular spot when people want to hang out downtown. They also allow dogs inside and last time I went there was a great dane large enough to eat all of your babies. He was majestic. Photobooth as well is situated in the back. They keep the backyard covered in the fall and winter with an atrium greenhouse like setting but there is still a small area uncovered for smokers or if you like getting fresh brisk air. Geeky cocktails are usually listed. Haven't tried one yet: Princess Toadstool, the Return of the Deter, and Kylo Ren which is 1/3 daddy issues with bitters and grenadine and a little pilsner. I can't express how much joy their creativity gives me. Happy hour is $5 beers but they're usually solid beers marked down from $7-8. $5 wines/wells. Picklebacks I think are usually $5. All in all its a chill friendly place with a number of neighborhood pups that I could watch for hours.",4,,6

While it might seem like a small venue at first, there's more in the rear: a patio with both an indoor and outdoor area, with the latter being particularly nice in the warmer months.Prices are reasonable, and service is prompt and efficient if it isn't too crowded. A good venue to have in the neighborhood.",1,1,1

28,Deborah C.,"Manhattan, NY",20,12,0,5.0,9/22/2017,"I hosted a happy hour for ~50 people at d.b.a. in their indoor patio. It was a PHENOMENAL experience. As an event space, it was ideal because we could rearrange the furniture, request that the volume of music in the indoor patio be turned down, and reserve tables close to each other. Our happy hour was fairly casual, so we did not need to reserve the entire room, but for those of you who are curious, that is an option Mon.-Fri. and includes a minimum purchase.But most importantly, we received fantastic customer service. The team at d.b.a. answered all my questions leading up to the event and during the event itself, was very accommodating and responsive.Thank you d.b.a.! I'll be recommending you to other people organizing events and hope to host another event with you again.",4,,1

The young bartender doesn't know how to make Irish car bombs but but some guy bought meat pies and it was the most satisfying thing ever. And it was for free but I don't think the meat pies are a regular thing and this was a Wednesday night. So I think I got pretty lucky.,,,
30,Jennifer S.,"Brooklyn, NY",497,810,99,4.0,3/3/2017,"There was one bartender on an extremely busy Saturday and the service was painfully slow. It wasn't because HE was slow, it just was impossible to serve that many people, collect and clean glasses and cash people out in a timely fashion. It was one of those super warm, sunny winter days where people rejoice at the weather and come out in droves. I am still giving four stars because 1)he was doing his best 2)there were so many dogs in the bar that I almost screamed out of cute overload 3)the outdoor space is great 4)great beer selection.This is a great place to go on a sunny weekend day drinking extravaganza, and I assume they will have more staff when the weather is nicer.",2,,1

Dogs? Check. Beer? Check. Awesome divey feel with an open back yard and good tunes? Check.What more does a man need?Aside from the pile of dog crap I stepped on the experience was awesome. This is a cool hangout to kill time and grab some good beer. Their selection was awesome and typical NYC prices for craft brews and full bar drinks. They do have some specials but having just come back from Ireland, I was in the mood for some dark lager and my appetite was satiated.

Prices are what you'd expect, not cheap. Again, not cheap/crappy beer here. Bartenders here know what to recommend so don't be shy about asking for some help.Another plus: outdoor patio.Another plus: dogs allowed!Seriously who doesn't like dogs?!?!Came here with a co-worker and enjoyed some good beers and good times.

We all ordered multiple drinks and tipped appropriately. When one of my friends went to close out her tab, the bartender accused her of sneaking in wine to the bar. He then proceeded to come outside and accuse our entire group of ""stealing money out of the bar's pocket."" When prompted, he couldn't say where this mysterious wine bottle was found. This ""wine"" was by no means brought in by anyone in our group. And after giving you so much business tonight, it's flat-out insulting. We're all in our mid to late 20s, we're not children who sneak in booze to bars and none of us were drunk at all. No one in our group will ever be visiting your establishment again.",3,,

Drinking with dogs is always a good idea.Cons: the customer service was deplorable. I went last Sunday (9/24) and the bartender working was pleasant enough. However, it was the woman sitting on her computer off to the side that was awful.... I grabbed a few beers for my friends and with full hands I put my little dog on the ground to walk back to our table. My 5 lbs dog was following right behind me unleashed. When the woman saw this she yelled at me ""your dog has to be on a leash!"" and then went on a rant that I didn't really follow. Of course I apologized right away, told her it was my first time there and had no idea about this rule. My friend grabbed one of the beers from my hand so I could pick my dog up right away. Once I got back to my table and was sitting with my friends she came outside and said again ""your dog can never not be on the leash!""... okay dude, I heard you the first time... I obviously would have never not have followed that rule had I KNOWN about it. And once I was told the rule I was clearly going to abide by it. You don't need to come try and condemn me again in front of my friends. Wasn't screaming at me in front of people in the bar enough? Side note, it it's THAT big of a deal it should be posted throughout the restaurant more clearly for people to see. As I spent 15 minutes waiting for my beer I read signs in 25 different languages behind the bar that said ""In America we tip bro"" but never read anything about the leash policy. Whatever. When I went to close out my tab the bartender was outside unloading beer from a delivery truck. I waited about 3 minutes all the while the woman was sitting 15 feet away completely ignoring the fact that customers at the bar needed to be helped. Finally, I went up and told her I needed to close out my tab. She acted like I had just asked her to move a mountain and the disdain on her face was very clear. She begrudgingly closed my tab and turned around and yelled my last name  ""MU*****!"".

There are other reasons to love this bar, I'm sure--I hear tell of a great selection of beers and whiskeys and all that.  I'm sure that's true.  I didn't notice, I was too busy enjoying being outside.  I'm not in this neighborhood that often, but I'd like to come back to d.b.a, and if it's somehow consistently this chill, I'll update my review, bump it up to five stars and throw in some all-caps enthusiasm.",6,4,5

54,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,6/27/2015,"So I've been here twice. First time was around 8pm on Friday. Grabbing a beer before dinner at a place close by. The second time was around 10pm on Friday. The only upside--if there is one--of remembering that you left your credit card at a bar is that you can just go back and close out your tab. Noooobody needs to know, right? Anyway--in two hours, the vibe completely changed. When I came around 8, it was laid back and ordering one of many many beers dba offers was a breeze. I chatted with the bartender about the beers that I tend to like (Belgian and/or dark), and he recommended La Chouffe, which is as much fun to say as it is to drink. Flavorful, full-bodied, etc. etc. I don't have any sort of beer lexicon, sorry. But I know that when I like something, I finish it a bit too quickly, and when I don't, I really really don't. I tasted another beer while I was there, which tasted like a mulled beer, if there is such a thing. Drastically different from what I ordered, but still great. My point: the selection here is fantastic and diverse. They have way too many options to choose from, hence me needing to enlist the bartender's help. Beer selection alone, 4 stars. But the other factors here fall short for me.When I say the vibe changed, I mean that when I returned to abashedly retrieve my credit card, this place was a madhouse. Closing out my tab became an ordeal (""just the one beer?"" ""yes yes, I was drinking one beer over the course of two hours...that's not strange at all...""). When I first came, I remember thinking that the space was quite small given that it seems like the type of place that beer lovers would flock to. And flock they did. If you're going to offer such a stellar selection of beer, you need to be better equipped for the volume of people that will want to show up. This is New York, people. That said, I didn't make it out back, so I can't speak to the space there. I'd definitely come back, but definitely not at peak hours.",2,2,2

A couple times a week I head over with my puppy Tigg to visit the great crew of bartenders that work there. Everyone took the time to learn and remember my name, my dog's name, and the names of any friends I've brought along more than once. The entire staff is great, but if I can, I'd like to single out Dougie, their barback/porter (???). He's kind to a fault, funny, and has made a point of making me and guests feel very welcome.Additionally they have a great drink selection (particularly beer), and a great patio space.

When the bar called last call, the bouncer walked up to everyone and said, ""We're closing up. Finish your drinks quickly.""  When we didn't drink our drinks quickly enough, the bouncer walked up again and said, ""Didn't I tell you to finish your drinks? I want to go home."" We told the guy we were going to finish our drinks shortly. We had literally just ordered them. Our friend had gone to the restroom and the bouncer, a third time now, walked up to us and said, ""You didn't even take a sip of your drink since I last told you to finish. Are you going to finish?"" We were still waiting for our friend. At one moment, he even said, ""Do you want attitude? I can kick you out right now."" Not sure what we did to warrant such hostility. The bartenders were nice and the bar seemed cool, but going to grab a drink, though late, and being faced with aggression didn't seem to make much sense in terms of hospitality. Ultimately, I paid for a drink I nearly half finished. Wish I kept walking past the bar instead of wasting my money. Will surely never return.

We were greeted by a bartender who had just started; she was extremely green, I couldn't believe she was basically covering the bar herself. Ordering drinks was like a game of charades. If you asked her a question about something on their beer or liquor menu, she didn't know hide nor hair about it. I don't know why they didn't have someone more seasoned actually supervising her. Another patron a few seats over was concerned the new bartender jacked up her tab and based on what we saw and experienced, odds are she was right. Eventually another bartender appeared, but he wasn't much better. Less clueless, but far more apathetic.They were out of a number of things when we were there.

OK, not quite 100% true, but a bathroom truly in the top 10% of gross bathrooms in the city. The bottoms of my shoes wouldn't lie to you.That said, the drink menu here is pretty remarkable, the reason I came. Specifically I was relying on a recommendation from Jeffrey Steingarten's now 16 yr. old book The Man Who Ate Everything. I'd stayed in this neighborhood many times, walked right by this watering hole and never noticed it. Happy to say all these years after he's still right. Good selection, although I came really for single malts and found them to be pretty much what everyone else offers.So here's the thing. This is your classic dark, dark, kind of watering hole. If you want to disappear and relax during the day, it can be accomplished here. There's also a covered outdoor patio in the back but on a 30 degree night I opted for a seat at the bar with Mr. Semi-Surly, unfriendly bartender. Pint of Old Speckled Hen from England, why yes, that'll do just fine. If you're looking for engagement with staff, move on. It's not here. If you're looking for a wide selection of beers from all over on tap, good choice, as it is for the spirits. Can't say I'd stop in again but it was an interesting experience.

The bartenders were quick and attentive. I was unsure between two beers and the bartender gave me samples of them. Happy he offered because I definitely preferred one over the other!

Unfortunately, just about every beer that I asked for, was out of stock. It was comedic how much beer they were out of.-Slow Service: Every time I went to order another beer, the bartender was painfully slow to walk over to my direction. And by the way, we are not talking about a busy night here. This was around 5-7pm, and the bar could have been labeled as ""mildly occupied"" at best. Mostly, the bartenders were just doing about everything they could to not serve us.-Rude Service: After being told ""sorry, we're out"" for half the beers I wanted to try, I found it odd to receive an attitude from the bartenders that were peeved by my pondering of which beer should be my sixth alternate choice. They were even annoyed if I would simply ask, ""do you have any of that Hefeweizen?""

There was more seating outside the greenhouse, but we stayed in side. We basically watched several people line up to get their hair cut. Yes, you get a free hair cut with the purchase of a beverage. Now, don't get me wrong, I think this is a great idea for an east village hipster. But they cut people's hair right in the walkway when you walk from the inside bar to the outside.

First, the bartender seemed to not want to serve us, even though we were just sitting there being patient. I'm pretty sure we were seen, yet she kept attending to others who would just walk up to the center of the bar. I might understand, if we were being rude, obnoxious customers, but we weren't. Nor was the bar completely slammed - comfortably full, but by no means jam-packed. It's difficult to put my finger on exactly what was going on, but it was a weird vibe.The beer menu....hey, on the surface, it appears that they are trying to put together an interesting selection. Unfortunately, I don't think their chalkboard has been updated in quite some time, because when Ms. Uninterested finally did come to us, every beer I'd choose, they didn't have. This is a HUGE pet peeve of mine with beer bars. Update your damned menu. I've seen bars that feature hundreds of beers constantly updating their lists, with the owners themselves sitting there at a laptop every week adding and crossing out beers, printing new menu pages, etc., so there's no excuse. Lastly, after exhausting 3 options that the bartender sheepishly informed me that they didn't have, I settled on an IPA from Abita, on cask. OK, cool, cask ale, surely they'd score some points here, right? Wrong. My beer wasn't lightly chilled....it was slightly warm. There's a common misconception about ""real ale"" served on the hand pump - apparently, some believe it should be warm. This is not the case. The serving temperature should be warmER, but not WARM. I quote, from the American Brewers' Guild Guide to Cask Conditioning, ""Temperature Control"" - ""The ideal serving temperature is 'cellar temperature,' or around 55 degrees F."" This was probably closer to around 75 degrees F, possibly even higher...slightly below the temperature of bath water. The IPA was nice, but no IPA will be presented in its best light at that temperature. That makes three strikes. Worst beer bar I've experienced in some time, possibly ever.",11,6,9

Then they trotted out tab after tab with other women's names on them to show me - nope, that's not me. After about 20 minutes of being told to ""hold on"" while they served other customers, the bartender returned, requesting that I come back to dba a week later to give them a chance to do a more comprehensive search for my card. No way in hell am I leaving my credit card floating out there - lost - for a week, while they ""look"". After being interrupted multiple times while explaining my rationale, and being told that ""I know I took your card, but I didn't lose it; it must have been someone else"", I just said to forget it: I would cancel my card.

I immediately liked the atmosphere - nice big bar to the left, a few tables, a father and young son playing on what looked like a pinball machine to the right, and a cat wandering about. The inside of the bar was kind of dark as bars tend to be, but it was a sunny day, so the sun filtered in through the front window and the back where there was an outdoor patio and some kind of bridal shower going on at the time. The chalkboards behind the bar were filled with lists of beers I've never tried before, plus whiskeys and other drinks like hot cider that looked delicious. For happy hour, there was a small discount on select beers and wines, so we each went with a few beers. We sat at the bar for some time and watched as the place grew more crowded. Before we left, I stopped in the bathroom, which was a little cramped, but clean. On our way out, I was able to pet a corgi puppy that had just come in with a couple that sat at a front table. A nice afternoon stop.",1,,

On the divey side, d.b.a. has always been my favorite for a good pint (always good stuff on tap) or for whiskey (wide selection). There's also a cool back patio, which is awesome during summer.

Too bad we never got the chance to go in since the ignorant bouncer assumed both of our IDs were fake because we just moved here from out-of-state and still carry our Florida IDs. I offered to show him my voters registration as a secondary source of verification, but he was demeaning and rude. I have a blank space at a portion of my ID because I am not an organ donor. I feel like my personal choice regarding what to do with my body has been belittled. He didn't use a flashlight, black light, or any other device to verify his opinion.

Barstools had backs, which is nice.  Did I mention it has lots of beers?Wasn't too crowded on a Sunday afternoon as I sat with a friend and caught up on things.The Fuller ESB I was drinking went down smooth, maybe too smooth based on how I felt Monday morning.   His cider looked like Sprite. Or maybe 7-Up...the Uncola.  Do they still make that?While I was there, a steady stream of regulars and tourists came in and everyone got served with no problem.This place seems pretty nice, but I like the one in Brooklyn a little better, probably because I had a really good time there.  If you like beer and you're not wearing your good clothes, you should have no issues with this place._______________________________________________* She was the singer from Heart, he was the lead singer from Loverboy.

As far as taps go, I thought it was a pretty conservative selection (then again, my most recent visit was St. Patrick's Day so there were more obligatory stouts than you'd normally see). But they are an older beer bar in a city replete with stiff competition from serious upstarts like Rattle 'N' Hum, The Pony Bar, Stout, and even smaller places like Marshall Stack on the LES.The bottle and single malt list stacks up against bars like Ginger man, but be prepared to pay the price for quality libations (the $1 Happy Hour could be a lot happier). I'm not crazy about how crowded this place gets, and not yet sold on the quality of this crowd. More trips are warranted, so I'm leaving this with a somewhat tentative 3 stars.PS: There's a cool back patio if you can actually find a seat.",2,1,1

First of all 100+ degrees in the place and it smelled like a sewer. I haven't been there for a few years but seriously what happened? Two bartenders behind the stick, about 7pm on a Thursday night and they  just don't look up..i was there probably 15 minutes, maybe one deep at the bar and they never made eye contact, they were too busy rifling down pizza behind the bar. The beer? I was shocked to see Stella on draft and a sign that said ""$5 Stellas during footy""...really, you were arguably the best beer bar in NYC long before the craft beer craze........whew, what a disappointment...This place has fallen faster than Lance Armstrong....",3,2,
99,Margaret T.,"Brooklyn, NY",531,357,59,1.0,9/6/2011,"So the first time I came here, I absolutely despised the place. It was one of the hottest nights of the summer and the unofficial Yelp event was being held in the backyard area. Fine. I assumed it would be a normal backyard, not a greenhouse with a single, pathetic fan lazily spinning above our heads. After sweating out all of my natural juices, I sought refuge indoors where the A/C was thankfully pumping. Beer me please. The selection is great. Tons of beer and whiskey to choose from. Problem is, the bartenders spend more time with their backs to you and seem more interested in fiddling around with the cash registers. I understand it's busy but I'm pretty sure most bartenders can take more than a single order at a time. The ones here cannot. They take one order, pour one beer, take your money, go make change (very slowly), and come back. Repeat for the 40 people, 2 deep at the bar. I almost pulled my hair out watching this process.   How the hell am I supposed to get a buzz when I sober up waiting for my next beer?I returned another night (definitely not my choice) and it was much less crowded and it was not an epic wait to get a drink. However, even with the smaller crowd, I found the service to be intolerable as the bartender was still suffering from ITMT (Inability To Multitask) Syndrome. Honestly, my impatience makes this place completely unbearable -- come if you are a yogi or are sleeping with the servers. -----------------(I've also heard the men's room is the worst in the city.)",12,4,5

I even broke out the cooking utensils to whip up a batch of brownies and cookies. I was warned not to cook up any of those ""funny brownies"" so I just went with a double dark chocolate blend.Man, there was some serious baking going on here by my fellow Yelpers. Some of the stuff these people baked just blew me away. Of course, by the end of the night we all grabbed a bit of everything to take home. Yes, we are all piggies! What was cool is that there was a free bourbon tasting going at the same time sponsored by Free Angel's Bourbon - good stuff. This UYE was also thrown for a good charity cause - The Greater Kansas City Community Foundation/Joplin Missouri Disaster Relief Fund, which distributes funds to those most affected by the recent devastating tornados in Joplin, MO - and over $200 was collected. Every little bit helps! I was able to see some old faces and meet many new Yelpers that I have only communicated with through the website. All nice people and a good time. Great job by Lisa and Cara.  ----- Now for my opinion on d.b.a. which is more like 2 stars -----Probably one of the worst bartenders I have ever encountered worked here last night. Not only was this guy super slow, but he never really paid attention to who was waiting the longest for drinks, and just seemed to have a crappy attitude. I tended bar for many years so I know what I am talking about. The backyard patio area is covered by what is basically a beat up greenhouse with a few dinky fans so with the humidity last night it was sweltering in there. Then, they kick us all out at 10PM. The outside was pretty full of patrons too. Why close it so early? The bathrooms are pretty disgusting, smell like urine, and are also about 100 degrees in them. Seriously, a much needed renovation is in order of this whole bar. I do have say the saving grace is that d.b.a. has a terrific selection of single malt whiskeys, and craft beers on tap and in bottle. Really a super amount of options to choose from. Happy hour is really nothing to write home about - only get a dollar off until 7:30 PM. Really? Why even bother. How about two-fers or half off? They were playing a lot of 80's rock and classic rock which was a plus. All in all, good for a one time visit in this part of town, but not a bar I would recommend going back to.",8,3,8

Delightful Bartenders Aplenty: Shout-out to Morgan, the awesome bartender who made me a Bloody Mary from scratch on a Thursday night. (She busted out celery salt, Worcestershire, horseradish... the whole shebang, and with a smile. Bloody awesome.) She also doubled as a photographer for a proposal happening in the rear garden!

Dark Bar Atmosphere: Dim lighting, high ceilings, wood paneling. Comfortable and not a dive.Deals Basically Absent: The ""$1 off"" until 7:30 makes for one Crappy Hour deal.Don't Bring Appetite: There's no menu, but they rock about letting you bring in outside food. Burritos seem to be the bring-along bite of choice here.Don't Be Antisocial: The tables in the rear garden are practically communal, so make friends with your neighbors!Drink Beside Adults: It's a young crowd, but it's no frat bar. I found it to be a nice change-up from some of the spots over on 2nd Ave.d.b.a has definite potential to become a neighborhood spot for me.

We chugged our beer and left.  This happened to be the one time the bartender was super nice, helpful and offered a well thought-out recommendation.  Where was this bartender the last few times I went when it wasn't smelling like a really nasty pet store.

The bars main wall is plastered in chalkboards with its beer offerings all beautifully organized by style and origin. Almost all of the beers have a price next to them so you will not run into any surprises if you happen to pick a significantly more expensive beer. The bartender was very knowledgable in what the bar offered and was courteous enough to make suggestions and offer samples. While the space may be a bit tight, it does offer an additional seating area in the back leading to open air seating. If you get here a bit earlier in the night it would be best to grab an open seat at the bar. The only downside, particularly for the women, are the bathrooms. They are small and slightly skeevy.  There is also no food served at this establishment. Quick overview:-Come earlier, grab a seat at the bar-Eat beforehand or gran something from one of the places next door.

His demeanor was so disdainful and nasty, we told him to forget about and left. I will literally never step into this place ever again.

127,Line B.,"Manhattan, NY",113,291,18,4.0,10/26/2012,I have been here a few times and I am a fan of both their space and their beer selection. They were one of the first to have a really good beer selection in the city and they keep having a great craft beer selection. Their prices are standard prices so not great but not atrocious either.What I do like about this bar is their backyard space which is both open and enclosed. I love that you can have big events there and bring in food from outside as they do not offer food and that gives a whole other array of options than the usual eating out. I have been here mostly for the Yelp Cookies and Booze events and those events are delicious. If you want an upscale dive bar experience with a mix of romanticism thrown in there with good beer this is the place to go.,1,,1
128,Annie S.,"New York, NY",58,20,0,2.0,5/23/2014,"I wish I could give four stars for the great beer selection (while taking off one star for the nasty bathroom). But they are getting only two stars due to the horrible, rude, despicable service--which is the reason I won't be back, despite prior good experiences. And the reason I felt compelled to write my first Yelp review in 2 years...Last week, I came here to grab a few beers after work with a friend from out of town. I suggested it because of its good selection and because the 4 or 5 times I've been before, I enjoyed myself. The service was never something to write home about, but it at least met a minimum standard. Until now... We only had an hour or two to hang and when I got here, the place was almost empty. That didn't seem to matter to the bartender, who took her sweet time making eye contact or coming over (though I know she saw us), so I literally had to flag her down. When I asked about ambers on draft, she said, gesturing vaguely behind her and seeming annoyed, ""Uhh, there's our draft list."" Then she reluctantly told me yes she had something, mumbled a name, then bitchily corrected me when I said, ""Ok I'll take the Peak."" ""It's ABITA."" ""Even better, I'll take the Abita."" I was already kicking myself for coming here and having to give this woman money.Then my friend, who is the sweetest, nicest, most LOVELY person in the world, but is not exactly a beer connoisseur, asked if she had any beers ""like Blue Moon."" (Okay, I get it, this is a BEER BAR. God forbid someone utter the words Blue Moon! But don't a bitch about it.) So the bartender rolls her eyes and goes in her most patronizing voice, ""Those are Belgian STYLE ales. We have BELGIAN ales."" And then proceeds to stand there as if this insulting piece of information will magically help someone who doesn't know a lot about beer to make a decision. So my poor friend feels super awkward and eventually settles on some random beer. I was LIVID and had to bite my tongue not to say something. Wish I had...As it happens, one of the only other two (count 'em, TWO) customers in the bar actually worked for the brewery that made my friend's beer, so he bought her the drink. I was THRILLED about this because then I didn't have tip the bitchy bartender for more than just my drink! Because you know what? You can be bitchy to me all you want. Go ahead. As a former bartender, I will still tip you the obligatory dollar per drink even after crappy service, because I know what it's like to be in your shoes. And then I will leave and never give you any money again. But DO NOT be rude to my friend, who is a gem of a person. I wish we could have walked out then, but we had to stay until my boyfriend arrived and when he did, we were only half done our beers so he wanted to get one... Uggghh...Of course, when he tried to get a drink, it took about 10 minutes to get the bartender's attention, and then she was once again RUDE AS HELL. And the whole time we were there, I saw her blatantly ignore every other customer who tried to get a drink in favor of chatting with her friends, playing on her phone, etc. and then act super annoyed and bitchy to everyone whose order she finally found the time to serve. Seriously?!?After I was forced to use their absolutely horrible, disgusting, smelly bathroom, we FINALLY finished our beers. And even though we had more time to hang out, I was determined not to give that nasty woman another goddamn dime. So we left... Never to return. I can find great beer selections in lots of places, and those beers don't come with a side of bitch.",3,,1

When I first arrived, two of my friends had already made a diligent effort to get a drink but the middle aged (Irish?) bartender couldn't be bothered. Okay, they seemed to have an explosion issue with their tap, but still... she was so disgruntled and annoyed to be serving ANYBODY. Apparently she was also ""changing shifts"" but to whom, it was unclear.We finally managed to get our draught beers and take them back to the garden with us just to discover that they were totally flat.

The bar itself was pretty empty for 7pm on a Saturday, which I found surprising as it had a great atmosphere and ample seating, as well as a wide offering of craft beers and drinks. We settled on two of the beers which were roughly $5 apiece with the happy hour special and decided to check out the outdoor space in the back. All of the tables were filled when we ventured out there, which was 100% understandable. This was one of the nicest beer gardens I've seen in the city, which is a rarity to come by. They had a glass indoor/outdoor area that opened up to several tables that were strictly outdoor. We were able to snag a table when a group was leaving, and we slowly sipped on a beer for a solid hour taking in beautiful weather.I enjoyed both the indoor and outdoor space, and I'll venture back when I'm in the area!",1,,1
136,Mike Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,190,62,2.0,4/23/2012,"What makes or breaks a bar is the service and the decor.Unless you''re employing a great mixologist - liquor is liquor and beer is beer. I hardly order cocktails unless I'm going to a place that specializes in cocktails. That being said it wouldn't matter if it's a monkey or man that pours my drink because why would it? The drink itself would come out no different. What does make the difference - and requires a person rather than some kind of primate is the customer service. First, some context and a bit on decor. We arrived at DBA on a saturday. It was around 6 PM. The place was busy as it was a nice day out. The bar was packed and the garden out back was full. Beautiful east village people abound. The interior was nothing special. It was dark, there was wood. The garden had a tree or two and the ground was covered in gravel. The seating was all plastic chairs and lawn furniture. The 'fun' area seemed to be the greenhouse which you had to go through to get to the garden. The 'greenhouse' was a glass encased out door area which had a couple of long bench/tables and people there celebrating and being merry. There were two dogs running about - so yay for being dog friendly!Now everything seems perfect and nice so here is why i bitch. There was only one bartender at this huge bar full of people. Its great that this bartender will make tons of money because shes the only one serving but its shit for the patrons of the bar. It's shit because you stand there waiting to get a pint on a saturday afternoon for 15 minutes or so because they're understaffed. its shit because you dont get the attention of your bartender because its packed all the way up and down the bar. its shit because the bartender who's working their brains out stressed is not offering a high level of customer service due to the fact that shes the only one attending to everyones needs. and its shit because you have three bar backs restocking the bar and only one bartender actually putting drinks in peoples hands.I will not say our bartender was not nice. She was a professional and did her job. Am I happy that it took us 15 minutes before the bartender could come over and ask us our drinks? No. Not at all.

From that perspective, I do have to gave d.b.a. above-average marks, since their list has some solid draft offerings including some rare local varieties, and I always love finding some new ones to try. On the everything else chart, however, this place doesn't really stand out from the pack. It's your average NYC dive bar, dingy environs packed with the usual assortment of hipsters and punk rockers ordering from an indifferent bartender. I was here once in warmer weather and recall the patio being a pleasant place to sit, but the bar space really has nothing to recommend it over other venues.

You wont find a kitchen here, but the BYOF policy means that you can pair your beer with nourishment of your choice.

The draft menu consisted of the following ales on tap:  Red Hook IPA (Bud owned), Red Hook Pale (also Bud owned), Widmer (ditto), Stella Abattoir (you guessed it), Hoegaarden (yuuuup) and to my great surprise, SHOCK TOP!!!  Wow!  I thought I had walked into the wrong bar.  There were two or three taps with beer not owned by A/B, but the Julius Echter Hefe was being poured warm and flat from a pitcher.  It was nasty.  They had Anchor Bock.  Whoopie!  You'll notice that there wasn't a single draft line with a remotely locally brewed ale.  There was a stout from Ireland, tho!  This place is now just a sports bar without sports and wings.If you're new to d.b.a. and not expecting anything interesting, great.  Have fun.  Bring a sandwich from Katz's and enjoy their patio.  But if you remember when this was the place to get great beers, keep walking.  Head to Blind Tiger, Torst, DBGB, Barcade, etc.  This place is a huge disappointment.On the plus side, at least you can now enjoy a similar d.b.a. drinking experience at your local Chili's!!  Cheers!",9,3,

I'm sorry, but bar gardens are prime real estate. So once I heard the news, I B-lined it to the only big table inside. It was large enough for the entire party, so most had to stand.

165,Allison S.,"New York, NY",25,69,2,1.0,8/10/2013,"I went here last night for a birthday thing (for me). My friend recommended it because she'd been there a couple of years ago and remembered it being good.Here's why I gave it any stars at all: good beer selection, decent pours, awesome patio--really good for large casual gatherings. (But don't try to reserve it, because even if you do, they won't.)Here's why I'd like to give it no stars: service. Holy crap, guys. The blonde, tattooed bartender was a HUGE [insert expletive of choice here]. She seemed OK at first, but when she told me they had to switch over the kegs of the beer I ordered, she gave me crap for trying to read the menu from where I was standing, which I can only assumed she thought was acceptable bartender snark. Honey, I am the Queen of Snark, and snark, that ain't. She also gave my friend attitude when he mispronounced ""Omegang."" Did you see that season of America's Next Top Model with that obnoxious chick Melrose? That's this bartender to a tee. Your tips depend on my not thinking you're a huge [insert expletive of choice here], so slow your roll and dial back the attitude, dude.The manager also seemed cool at first, at least when I asked him about their food policy (bring in whatever you want; just make sure you take it out with you when you leave--fair enough). But then I went to the bathroom--yes, it was pretty gross, especially since the stall doors are saloon doors and don't lock--and someone informed me there was no toilet paper. No biggie, I'll tell the bartender. For five minutes I was ignored by both the manager and the dude bartender (hipster to the max, oh my GOD), at which point the manager noticed me and told the bartender to take my order. He reluctantly sauntered over and nodded to me, I told them there was no toilet paper, he went to the register, grabbed a couple of bills out, and told the manager, who then, exasperated, looked in the cabinets above the bar for a roll. I went back to the bathroom to wait, where the other girl said she found a roll on the wall above the toilet. The manager came back to the bathroom with a couple of rolls, and when I told him we didn't see the other roll, he said, ""Awesome,"" rolled his eyes, shook his head, and tossed a couple of rolls into the light fixture above the sink. Then the blonde bartender, who'd been in the stall this whole time, came out, scoffed when I tried to let her by me (no, in case you're wondering, she didn't wash her hands, but I don't really think she was going to the bathroom in there anyway...), and went outside to smoke. Or something. I don't know. She just seemed to hate her job, as did everyone working there, including the bar manager.They apparently have a free brunch deal on the weekends. I'm pretty sure it's to reel in customers, because that place was only about 1/3 full on a Friday night, and with a beer selection like that, it should be packed to fire code violation level. But since the bad attitudes are apparently a prerequisite to work here, it's no wonder so few people are willing to put up with it.
