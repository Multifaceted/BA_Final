0,Sherwin S.,"New Hyde Park, NY",0,5,39,5.0,11/11/2018,"The good: Food: I ordered the breakfast burger and a mimosa (very strong ). The burger was a perfect medium rare, topped with melted cheese, tomatoes, and a fried egg. The burger was delicious and oh so cheesy. The meal came with fries as well (average fries).Service: Our server was also awesome. She was able to handle our large group (6 people) very easily and was extremely friendly. The Bad: nothing Note:When with a large group, they can only split the bill 5 ways. I don't mean max of 5, I mean only 5. You either put everything on one person's card or you split it 5 ways.",,,
1,Greg W.,"New York, NY",45,123,41,4.0,11/4/2018,"Very very accommodating they were. That alone gave them the better star. The service was a plus. The water never was empty and our server Sabrina was never to far away.I had the 1/4 wedge iceberg lettuce and buffalo wings. I am a tradition buffalo wing guy and these are not. They were spicy, filling and enjoyed but not traditional. But the pint of Guinness was not served frozen which I hate and I faced the TVs to watch football as I ate with the family. So it worked for me. My wife went with a grilled fish. They had a couple choices and she was able to make a ton of alterations and adjustments. In the end she was pleased. My son hunkered down to a plate of lamb chops. There was 4 on the plate. We got rid of the mash doubled down and the Brussels sprouts and side of sweet potato fries. He was happy to. His only wish was they carried some type of healthy soda in a bottle. Like the ones made with real sugar. The burgers looked good and place worked for everyone at the table. Sure I wish the wings were traditional but the whole group was happy and I had my perfect pint. I consider tonight a victory.Thanks",,,
2,Max M.,"Wyckoff, NJ",4,166,26,5.0,10/22/2018,"Awesome pub/bar vibe. Really delicious food, the chipotle chicken wrap is incredible. Tender chicken with a nice, creamy sauce. The brunch special is a really good deal (entree + free drink). The only complaint I had was that it was quite crowded on a Sunday (but that's expected with any kind of bar during a Sunday football day). Highly recommended.",,,
3,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",382,334,637,2.0,10/17/2018,I came on a Sunday to watch football with a friend. They have a brunch menu but I just missed it! I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were kind of soggy and a lot of it stuck together. I guess I should've had low expectations for bar food. For watching sports it's a good bar because there's a bunch of screens everywhere. But for a dining experience not so much. My mimosa was the saving grace of my meal. After I finished my mimosa I was kind of craving a margarita. I know. I'm not at a Mexican place why would they make a margarita? The women behind the bar however told me they have margaritas. This margarita was so sweet and watered down it was such a disappointment. It tasted like she used margarita mix which is probably the case because it's a sports bar. They do have a check in for a free whiskey shot. I would probably pass on this because it's really overly sweet. Not to mention it was so difficult flagging down staff to other drinks or get food.,2,,

They have many options here and even the appetizers are large portions. It is fairly priced and the service is attentive. It's casual, and also has an upstairs and downstairs area. It would be a good place for a larger party as well. It's an easy low key place to go that's clean, has good food, and will probably result in some leftovers.",,,1
7,Kemi O.,"Manhattan, NY",52,312,312,4.0,8/6/2018,"Had a nice late lunch here with my little one after her doctor's appointment. She had the kids slider, no bun with French fries. The portion size was nice, which allowed for her to have some leftovers for dinner. It was homemade fries (which is always a plus).On Mondays they have a 1.5lb lobster special served with a baked potato and corn on the cob. I opted for the steamed version and it was very tasty! They also start their happy hour fairly early at 11a!  A little too early for me on a weekday but hey, different strokes for different folks....I found the happy hour options for mix drinks limited but they had a nice selection beers and wines.The staff were very accommodating and attentive to their customers and checked up on us at ever turn.  That's what I call good customer service. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely stop by for another meal (hopefully on their Taco Tuesdays).",2,,3

Updated review","Decent spot for a quick beer or if you want to stay local on a Saturday night.  Have eaten here a few times, we tried brunch and dinner.  The food isn't amazing but it's not half bad either.  Decent beer selection.  Prices are a few dollars more than they should be but so is most of NYC.  They don't have a good happy hour either and they should.  This place is the definition of a three star bar/restaurant, nothing great to say, but nothing terrible to say either.  Usually have a DJ on Saturday nights with pretty good turnout.  Go here if you're looking to get out of the house but I wouldnt expect to be blown away by anything about it.",,,

10,Cheryl N.,"Manhattan, NY",165,292,1038,3.0,1/21/2018,"My review is for brunch. A reservation is not needed, but we made a res online and were seated right away as this place can get busy.Brunch entrée includes a free Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or Bellini. An entrée ranges from $12-18, and there are loads of options. I had the breakfast burrito and I was full. My friends had the omelette and the eggs Benedict. Although we weren't wowed by the food, we thought it was decent. My friend was picking out the spinach stems from the omelette which would have been better sans stems. Our server was friendly and all of the staff seem to exude positive vibes. I love the decor of this place. It was fun to sit upstairs and have a view off of the balcony. So for ambiance I give it 5 stars.Oh and blue point oysters were $1 each! Minimum of 6.***For $16 more you can have unlimited brunch cocktails over 90 minutes if you want a boozier brunch",1,1,1
11,Joseph G.,"New York, NY",259,248,1271,4.0,6/10/2018,"It's too bad I can't eat like I used to. This place appears to have a great menu. I ordered the mahi mahi and it was quite good. A few of the potatoes were undercooked, but that was due to the size. I can let that slide. The first server was horrible, she brought water and never returned. They may have been short staffed, but that's no excuse. We grabbed another server and he made it happen for us. My drink choices were poor. I ordered an orange crush, sent it back. Tried the frozé, sent it back, settled on a mojito, kept it. This place is LOUD! I thought coming early in the evening would be different. Not a chance. I'll come back, but not during the Belmont Stakes or any major sporting event. Apparently justify won... So what, who cares. I'm hungry and thirsty.",5,2,4

Was attracted to the two story out door second level to do brunch and people watch.  They offer a complementary brunch drink, just nice.  The only negative I would give is on the greeter/hostess.  I walked in and stood in front of her, just zoned out.  When she turned to me just bland no smile and actually I expected an apology since she was so checked out.  When I asked about the sit out upstairs, she finally got around to a yes... then ran off. I am not kidding, she just left me ran up the stairs, I figured it out-including my seat but it wasn't because she was an even average hostess.  The servers and following service made up for it. However, thats the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.",,,

We sort of stumbled on Five Mile Stone while looking for something else. Yet again, a quick glance at Yelp changed where we were going. This place had a great brunch menu and offered free mimosa with a brunch entry. I had the Five Mile Omelet. Five Mile gives you a pretty good portion size with a side of the potatoes.

Day 2 of me relocating from TX, I wandered myself into this place, My soul cried yes when I saw ""Austin Eastsider Cider"" on draft!!! It was a familiar love at first sip! Happy hour specials / they got it and I love it! From 4-7 $5 draft beers, well drinks and house wines!  I didn't order any food here but the folks around me food smelled AhhhhMaaazzzing! I thoroughly enjoyed the customer service here, servers were prompt and attentive and nice. Place was swanky and clean, it appears there's and upstairs area as well; I didn't investigate!

I had their avocado toast w/ eggs and it was really good from a taste standpoint. I thought it could have been more food though...but I might have just been super hungry. The really, really good part though was the unlimited mimosas. Well actually you could do like 4 different types of drinks for their $19 unlimited option for 1.5 hours. I just ended up doing mimosas. That. Was. Awesome. The mimosas were good and the servers kept them coming. The ambiance is pretty awesome too. We never felt rushed and the servers were attentive. We really just hung out for like an hour after our meal watching March Madness. They have an upstairs too that opens onto a little standing balcony so I can't wait to come back when it gets warm.",,,1

20,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",32,64,159,3.0,9/4/2017,"Five Mile Stone is a respectable choice for a low key evening on the UES.  I wouldn't step foot in the establishment on say... a Thursday through Saturday from the hours of 8 pm onwards... but for a late afternoon bite and a good selection of craft beer on tap... this place checks the box.We started our evening with a dozen dollar oysters.  The quality of the oysters were just okay - not terrible - but not great either.The primary draw is the quality of their burger.  The meat is well seasoned.  The patties are juicy.  The burger menu selection is inventive (although in my opinion the burger menu was a bit more creative several years ago).  I would put their burger to a taste test vs. many of the conventionally known burger establishments in the City and bet Five Mile Stone has better odds than a fair coin toss.Service is standard.  Again, a good option if you know what you're signing up for.",,,

Overlooking second avenue, it's nice to sit outside while not having to be on the busy sidewalk. Happy hour specials are also good with $6 wines and well drinks. The bar does get busy if the weather is nice, so be prepared with back up options if all the seats are taken. Bondurants around the corner is a good back up option!",,,
23,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,4.0,12/29/2017,"I love Five Mile Stone. It's always a great choice in the neighborhood for drinks. You can't beat their happy hour with $5 wine/beer from 4-7 and the brunch where you get a drink included. The fish and chips are hands down the best, but they have a few other gems like the lobster roll. I wish they'd kept their old menu with the Cajun influences that they started with, but I think they changed chefs or something, so some of the menu changed for the worse. Stay away from the spinach dip... it's not what you're thinking. Otherwise, the beer selection is fabulous and they offer Downeast Cider on tap, which is a game changer and will have me returning again and again.",1,,

We all ordered drinks and an entrée. We sat on the first floor but Id like to try out the second floor on a nicer day because it has some outside spots. We got Moscow mules and my one friend ordered a beer. (the two first she ordered were not available). The Moscow mules didn't taste like a traditional Moscow mule and had a lot of lime juice in them. They didn't taste bad but they didn't taste like what we ordered. I shared an appetizer of jalapeno mac n cheese balls with my friend. They were absolutely delicious and just had the right amount of heat to them. For dinner I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap it was good! My other friend ordered a burger which looked amazing. If I come back I would probably try a burger.Overall the place was nice, not too crowded where we were and the food was pretty tasty. I haven't been here at night with drinks and dancing but I would like to try it! Overall I'd come back for a burger and a beer and skipped the mixed drinks. Also there is an offer of a shot when you check in but me and my friends forgot. Hopefully next time!",4,,

Updated review","This place is pretty low key to go grab a drink and just hang.  There's nothing that particularly stands out in terms of appearance or libations.The food options are fairly limited and everything is pretty pricey for what you receive.  All the burgers are around 15$ and come with fries which is expensive in my book.  The one good thing about this place is that they have dollar oysters but I've been other places that have the same deal.  The service here is always awesome and the staff is friendly. if you're looking to kill time, might not be a bad place to sit down and grab a Guinness and oysters.",,,

Perhaps I'm too old for this, or was there on an off night. This review is for dinner. I was here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. I'll start with the positive - food. Decent pub food here, it satisfied my hunger. Service - left a lot to be desired - very rude waiter; we were patient even though service took a long time, and when the bill came the automatic gratuity that was added (6+ people) was over 20%. The standard added is 18% usually , and you can add more at your discretion. Needless to say, we were taken aback. We paid it, but first we pointed it out to the waiter, who insisted it was 18%.  Atmosphere - Chaotic. Many people were filtering down from upstairs, most routed out of the bar. I witnessed a few people falling down the stairs. There were a few belligerently drunk people hanging around our table and would not leave. I got spilled on while eating dinner. I will say, there was a nice patron who witnessed this and grabbed napkins from the bar for me. That was very nice of him, probably the most pleasant interaction outside of my friends there.",,,
35,Jimmy M.,"Rochester, NY",0,7,0,3.0,6/4/2018,"Went here while in town over Memorial Day weekend.  It was not too crowded which was nice so we didn't have to wait for a table.  We went upstairs as we decided we wanted it a little quieter so we could talk.  It was still a little loud upstairs with the music but not terrible.  Wouldn't have expected it to be very quiet since it is a bar.This is kind of where the up and down started.  First it took someone a few minutes to seat us.  There were a lot of empty tables but we didnt want to just sit down because we didnt know if there were certain tables we should or should not sit at.After that we ordered out drinks and food.  We ended getting the truffled spinach dip which was excellent.  So at this point I figured if that was good the rest of the meal would be as well.  We both got the same Jack Daniels burger.   When it came it looked really good.  It was ok, but it was fairly standard and to me it didn't really stand out.  It was cooked right but it just didnt seem to have a lot of flavor (plus the cheese just kind of fell off).  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either.  The last part was the waitress was just standing at the bar, I had to get her to come over and get us the check.  Not to mention she only checked once on drinks.  However there was a guy who came around multiple times and ended up filling out water for us.  He didnt have to, they give you a large bottle, but he did anyway.  Which was nice.  All in all, my impression was just kind of your run of the mill bar food.  The atmosphere could be cool in the right setting.  But I felt everything was so so. Some good, some not great.  Nothing completely glaringly wrong.",,,

50,Matt N.,"New York, NY",120,8,2,3.0,9/18/2018,"I want to just start off by saying that Five Mike is my absolute favorite bar on the Upper East Side. They play great music, have awesome drinks and the staff are super friendly and amazing. However, I was a little disappointed in their brunch when I went on Sunday. I got the brunch burger and my friend got the baked eggs. When we got there it was packed, which was understandable as it was 11 am on football Sunday. We put our orders in for drinks and food. I ordered the brunch burger and my friend ordered the baked eggs  we also put in an order of wings to split. The waitress came back and told us they were all out of wings, which really didn't bother us. When she came back with our complementary brunch cocktails I was shocked. My glass was about half full with mimosa and my friend looked like it a splash of mimosa. I understand that they were complimentary and that the glasses were small but at least fill it up correctly. The burger was great, just how I wanted it to be. My friends baked eggs were extremely sad looking. It was 2 fried eggs over a thin layer on tomato sauce. It then took us about 20 minutes after we finished our meals to get our plates cleaned up and another 20 waiting on the bill. I understand it was busy, but you can't really leave customers waiting that long.",,,

Updated review","I would definitely be back if I'm in the area.I took my family out to eat here for dinner after trying to make it work next door at Bondurant. Bondurant was just too loud. Very happy-hour vibe there -- loud music and loud people.But Five Mile Stone was noticeably more relaxed and serene. It's still designed with young professionals in mind, but it's also OK to go with family (including a baby).I'm docking off one star because our waitress wasn't totally helpful. We had a baby with us and she noticed we were kind of struggling keeping the baby comfortable, but neglected to offer a child's chair. Eventually we got one after asking. I'm not totally shocked about that though, and I almost don't hold it against them, because they are probably not totally used to having babies in the venue :) Our waitress also didn't ask half our party what they wanted to drink, which was odd and awkward. But again, not the worst :)",,,
53,Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",322,1,0,1.0,7/4/2018,"Can't really review. We waited for 16 minutes without anybody taking our order, so we left. Waitress didn't care, hostess didn't care - here's that one star you wanted.",,,

It can be a mixed bunch  with a lot of guests being in their mid 30s and up. I don't think I'll ever forget the night I saw two people in their 40s eat make out at the bar for an hour. Didn't make the first date I was on awkward at all. I'll stick to going here for lunch and drink on the weekends elsewhere where I can find a younger crowd.",,,

We asked for a Black and Tan and got a black, asked for a woodford reserve and instead received the double cask and charged for the more expensive even though it was an error, ordered carlsberg and it was too warm to give it its intended flavor.  The warm warmness gave it a sour taste and just didn't taste right; seemed like the temperature was higher than what is should have been.  Food: Oysters: definitely the highlight of the meal. 4/5. $1 oysters were definitely good; was fresh horseradish (really good), cocktail sauce (standard), malt vinegar and lemon Turkey burger: 4/5 surprisingly really good without being dry.  My only complaint was the waitress asked if we wanted cheese and I said yes but was charged an extra $2 Caesar salad:  homemade croutons made it unique but not above average Service: 4.  Whats keeping from a 5 is the mess up on the all 3 drinks-- we were seated right away on a Friday night though so that was good.

60,Brittany R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/19/2018,"The management of a company, is as important as its product. I have had two, absolutely terrible experiences here. The first: I went for after work drinks and a bite. I ordered the lobster roll and instead received shrimp. Familiar with the difference between lobster and shrimp, I asked the waiter about it. He told me that the item is actually a mix of shrimp and lobster. The menu indicates 100% lobster roll, which is more expensive, and also fraudulent advertising. I had to then speak to a manager, to have the item removed from my bill. They didn't offer any substitution and were hesitant to make me pay. The second: I attended around July 4th for drinks with friends that came in from out of town, and it was a good spot for pre-gaming, close to my apartment. Under the high-rise tables, there are hooks to hang bags. One way or another, my bag was left hanging there. I returned the next morning as it was a very expensive purse, as was the content inside. The management was hesitant saying that they saw no purse. They claimed they would check with staff there that night and update me. I returned a second time after no update, and the manager allowed me to walk upstairs and speak to the bartender. The bartender almost ignored me entirely, oddly suspicious looking. A third time I went back, I requested to see the footage from that night. The manager showed me only up until before the hour I left the bar, claiming the rest of the footage did not exist. I then went to the police to file a formal complaint, and the police indicated that this place has ""a ton of problems"" and ""a ton of theft"". The next day later I let the manager know that I filed a formal case with the local police. The manager then told me that there are ""a bunch of poor Mexicans"" that work in the restaurant, and that they are near a subway so ""immigrants from poor countries"" are here. I was with three people of Latin descent/ from Spanish speaking countries during all of my conversations with the manager, and he still made blatantly racist remarks. The next day, my purse magically appeared, and the manager claimed that the cleaning service took it. The contents of my purse were missing entirely, including jewelry and cash. Later discovery through his stories indicates that his own bartending staff were the thieves. A manger is responsible for who they hire, and he was the first willing to blame anyone not white or English speaking by first language.  I will never return to this establishment.",,,

None the less went to the bar to order a drink, the first bartender is on the house phone and the 2nd is staring at his cell phone.

This review is really more for Taco Tuesday - I found the deal yesterday, 2 tacos + a marg for $12. Pretty killer deal and was excited to give it a whirl. Since yesterday was 95 degrees, no one was sitting outside but there was enough of a breeze and it's finally summer in the city people! The staff was cool with seating us outside on their patio upstairs. Happy Hour is until 7 - Beer and Wine mostly. The beer menu isn't up to date so don't get too excited over some things. As for the Taco Tuesday margs - even though the sign advertises either a regular marg or blood orange, yesterday they were only serving up regular margs. It was good, strong enough for what the deal was, on the rocks only. Tacos - they were only doin' chicken yesterday. Not sure if that is the norm but they were fresh. Teeny tiny, so great place for an app and then go grab dinner somewhere else. Fresh off the grill chicken, lettuce, tomoato and salsa verde on what we were thinkin' was a corn tortilla.

It's a good time although at times it can get busy and drink times can get high. DJs are pretty good for the most part. Now for the food, which was not great. Food is over priced for what it is. It's just bar food so you can't expect much but your expectations are really met low, which they should try to change. It's kind of a college like bar atmosphere, which I think they should revamp and make it a little nicer and with new food. Would really bring in a more diverse customer base who would buy more food and make them more money. It's such a great location with an awesome second floor and big balcony seating as well as ground floor outdoor seating. Can't go wrong with outdoor seating!",,,

We had a back corner before it became a dance floor, with access to the balcony before it was closed for the night. Wish that didn't close at 9, but too many neighbors complained. The staff is all very knowledgeable and friendly. The manager, Rory, came over to make sure we were all happy and even offered me a free shot. Drinks are great- normal rail cocktails or specialty cocktails. Great (rotating) beer selection. Food is always excellent and fresh. I'd recommend the nachos or spinach dip, and the salmon caesar salad. Can't wait to return to Five Mile for a dinner or drinks. Good for any type of occasion.",,,

85,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,2.0,4/7/2017,"I did not have a positive experience at Five Mile Stone, but I'll provide a disclaimer that it may have been due to my fairly unique situation. Allow me to elaborate..I was there for an engagement party that included both friends and family. There was a section upstairs that was allegedly reserved for our party and it seemed like we had a few tables that food was being brought to for the first hour or two. As far as noise is concerned, there was some light background music and a few basketball games on in addition to the typical buzz you hear from a crowd, nothing crazy. However, around 10:30-11, the lights were turned off, the disco ball on, and the loud house music flared (it was hard to carry a conversation).My friend pleaded with the owner/manager to give them at least a little more time without this music so they could enjoy the company of those celebrating with them. This was to no avail. It was still a fun occasion and I think my friend and his fiance had a great time, but this attempt to propagate a wannabe-bottle-service-club vibe was a major drawback for us.I'm not sure to what extent my friend and his family made their intentions and desires clear to the manager when planning the event, so I hasten to give them one star and put all the blame on them. Still, once transformed, it wasn't my kind of place regardless of this situation. Tbh, I didn't see anyone dancing or enjoying the music so I'm not sure what their goal was. I think it was a bit discourteous for them to not be accommodating at all and I can't imagine coming back any time soon.",1,3,1
86,Marissa M.,"New York, NY",261,30,23,2.0,4/12/2017,"Went there with a group of friends for dinner and drinks. The food was mediocre at best; the drinks were fine. We got a mix of wine and margaritas. However, the entire meal, we felt like we were getting scammed. Food. First, one of our friends orders the wedge salad. After taking a few bites, she asked for a side of blue cheese as it didn't seem like there was much in there; she was informed that they ran out of blue cheese earlier in the day and so they didn't have any. This is an integral part of the dish (and there is a grocery store a block away!!). Nothing was mentioned to her about the fact they had run out when placing her order. Two other people ordered the market salad with goat cheese; feta was put on the salad. Again, no mention was made of this. Drinks: The bottle of rose wine we ordered came warm, not chilled. 4 people at our table were drinking jalapeno margaritas; almost immediately after the blue cheese incident, we ordered another round and was informed that there are no more jalapenos. How have you not run to the store yet if there are so many items missing from the kitchen and its early into a somewhat busy night?At the end of our meal, one of our group went to the bathroom and saw a sign that Tuesday is ""Taco Tuesday"", which is an order of tacos and a margarita for $15 or something. While placing our order, we asked the waiter about the tacos (but not until after we ordered a round of margaritas). Even with that prompting, nothing was mentioned about the special! So instead we paid $70 each for a sub-par meal (that wasn't even what we ordered with all the missing / changed items) and 2-3 drinks a person. Additionally, when we get the bill, five of us ate and were charged automatic gratuity on the bill. Summary: Extremely overpriced with poor communication that left a really bad taste. Only redeeming factor are a couple of outdoor areas, which are few and far between in the area.",1,,

Note, the beer selections are constantly changing; however, the staff are very willing to suggest brews. There are two bars one upstairs and one downstairs. I believe the one upstairs is open after 5pm. But, you can still drink (as long as you use a red/orange solo cup) on the balcony upstairs. Depending on how many people are on the balcony and at the tables will determine if you are allowed to smoke. I do have to say the UES is really stepping up its craft beer gastropub game.

It's never been packed either on a Sunday afternoon or Saturday night. The drinks aren't strong and they focus more on being creative. Came for brunch once and our waitress straight up peace'ed out in the middle of our meal. No joke we saw her walk out the door and never came back and then spent almost an hour waiting for our check. The food was decent, the eggs florentine was a bit over seasoned. The mimosa was good and the garden Mary tasted like liquid green salsa with vodka. There are better options in the UES.",3,,

Their wines during happy hour, even though promoted as the same as cocktail list, smelled and tasted like garbage. I then ordered a non happy hour rose and it still smelled because obviously they don't wash their glasses well enough. They reek! The avocado toast used to be straight avocado with eggs and is now guacamole and eggs, where the guac was clearly made 2 days ago. We would have stayed longer, but left because the wine stunk and food was gross. Idk what happened but darn..it's obvious that some major shortcuts are now being taken.",,,

When I opened the door, I was greeted by the host who helped me get balloons I brought upstairs. Even though we didn't really have much room because the balloons were so big, the friendly waitress Samantha offered to put some of the balloons in the back room while we ate. We were able to have a great time with a large party (about seven people) and most of us did bottomless brunch. If you're in for a challenge, decide on bottomless brunch and you only have 90 minutes to finish as much as you can! I ordered the crabcake eggs benedict and it was perfect. Also enjoyed the side salad that came with it. The mimosas come in a cute glass and there's also a large pitcher for the table so you can pass it around. We brought a birthday cake and Samantha was kind enough to not only set up the cake with candles we had, but brought a large knife so we could cut it up. At the end of our meal we were able to split the bill with cards. Samantha also had the balloons from the back ready to go by the time we wrapped up. She really did a great job and was very attentive to everyone's needs. The manager of the bar even offered my sister a shot for her birthday on the house. They have a balcony outside which is probably really great when the weather is nice. Overall, a great experience. I'll definitely be coming here again! Thank you!",,,

I've heard that the crowd that gathers here consists of a lot of douchebags, but I was pleasantly surprised with my experience because all of the people I met were very friendly. I had Guinness here, so I cannot really critique the drinks because, well, Guinness tastes the same everywhere but Ireland.

It's a two-story restaurant serving up nifty cocktails, about 25 craft type beers on tap, large whiskey list, and neau American fare. Welcome to the hood!It's a great looking place. Kind of like a do-it-by-numbers Irish pub with a New Orleans plantation home vibe, but compared to many of the older existing bars in the hood it's quite an upgrade. Terrific decor and spacious. Plenty of seating. It's not a total frat boy bar, but more of an adult like spot to have a good drink and bite to eat. They serve brunch too. With enough flat screens around it's also a nice spot to catch a game. Friendly and attentive service too. I've only sampled some small bar bites and appetizers here so far and they were decent. Also, I give them big props for taking a chance on a spot still hidden from view because of the 2nd Ave subway construction. Just hold on guys and hopefully it will pay off when it's all finished. Heck, any place where I can score an Innis & Gunn Toasted Oak IPA brew along with a highly potent Corpse Reviver cocktail is a winning propostion by me! What I really love about this place is the upstairs balcony area. It's a great place to perch yourself with a cold brew on a nice day and watch the world walk by.

First I brought my parents for lunch with my boyfriend, and the waitress completely forgot my mom's order so it came 20 minutes late and she didn't apologize or even offer anything comped. Then I came for happy hour with my boyfriend last week and we were overcharged for our wine. Then the bartender completely disappeared from 6:30 to 7 (aka when happy hour ends) and gave us a hard time about asking for happy hour prices since he was nowhere to be found. Again, no apology.

Updated review","2017: came into NYC for a Bachelor Party. Decided to head to the Five Mile Stone. The waitstaff, bartender, and even the owner ensured everyone in our group had a great experience! Great drinks, great food, two dance floors...couldn't have asked for a better venue! Highly recommend checking it out!2016: Came in here on a whim while visiting friends in the UES. The atmosphere was great, with a fun upbeat vibe throughout. While I did have a short wait to get my drink it was completely understandable based on the crowd (the big crowd was a good sign to me coming here for the first time). There was a great selection of beer and the bartender was very helpful in providing me some suggestions based on my usual go-tos. If you are lucky enough to have good weather be sure to grab a spot on the balcony and enjoy the view!",,,

Two levels, with outside table seating on the ground level and an outside patio where you can stand and people watch onto second avenue while chatting with friends on the upper level. (The 2nd avenue construction does not make this a pretty view - but still, it is cool.The first time here a while ago the live music was the attraction as we walked by looking for a place to have dinner - sitting outside hearing the music was wonderful, and while I don't remember what we ate, we were pleased.The most recent time I passed and noticed people  standing on the upper level patio and wanted to check it out, so came here later on a Saturday. Definitely a fun time, though pretty crowded both upstairs and downstairs around 11, crowd downstairs thinning a couple hours later. Both levels had loud music, and definitely a fun upbeat energy.Drinks, basic. I had an extra dirty martini last night, and it was decent enough, though I don't think any drink served in plastic (required on the patio) could be exceptional.Neither time disappointed and definitely recommend as a fun bar to go with a fun date or  with friends.",3,,3

Lots of 20 and 30 yr olds, great for a loud party like atmosphere so events such as bday parties might work or a blind date where one might need make a quick escape over the 2nd floor balcony but anything in between such as nice relaxing dinner with decent food for the price, definitely forgettable",,,

The draft beer was only mediocre as was the maple whiskey shot (thank Yelp!). The shot was like drinking maple syrup that burned on the way down. Very strange.The ambiance of the place was cool and it looks like it would be busy during football season. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, getting our drinks, bill, and to-go back quickly.

It's pretty low-key but with a great craft beer and cocktail menu. On this particular visit I had some kind of Cherry Ale from Gun Hill Brewery. LOVE in a cup. They also gave us Yelpers numerous shots of complimentary maple syrup whiskey. It was so tasty and is also a regular complimentary gift when you hop in and check in again. Their food I've never had the pleasure of trying but they have a lot of tasty options involving southern cooking (gumbo, deviled eggs, lousiana style chicken) and then numerous items with lobstah on their menu.

Tasty maple whiskey shot complementary when you check on with yelp. A great start for even those who don't drink whiskey! It's like drinking what I imagine 'breakfast in Ireland' to be! And If I had some pancakes and sausage, I would have poured that whiskey all over it and gobble it up!So I was fortunate to try their new menu before launch day, and everything was amazing! Interesting salads that were filling and beautifully made. Yummy sliders that maintained perfection in every bite. Great gameday snacks like their house made pork-skin rinds with chili salt and house made beef jerky; here the only problem was that the portion was so small that I craved for more!Now, onto their House burger which can definitely stand up with pride against the NYC Battle of the Burgers- thick, juicy, well cooked, and nicely seasoned burger patty on a warm sesame bun will make you wonder why you will ever return back to Shakeshack. Although on the pricer side, just splurge with the $1 added cheese and $2 added bacon! And to absolutely blow your taste buds off the charts, just go for the PBJ&B burger! Same tender beef patty with.... wait for it.... call your mother and tell her you found a better version of her.... wait for it.... Cuz this is gonna be legend- wait for it.... PEANUT BUTTER JELLY & BACON- dary! Legendary! Yes, a burger with peanut butter, red onion jam, and candied bacon is nothing like you tried before! Don't be afraid, just go for it!This is a well appointment pub with all the bells and whistles.

Lots of two-person high-top tables that are perfect for a date. They have a nice beer selection but I'd definitely recommend trying something from their cocktail menu (I'm partial to the Fitzgerald), as well as their bar snacks (the homemade pork rinds are addicting)! I've been pleased with the sandwiches I've had there, as well as the salads. In the summer you can't beat a plastic cup of beer on their balcony, overlooking Second Ave. I also attended the New Years Eve event this past year and it was nice to see a place not charge a cover while still passing out hats and noisemakers!

To be honest, there are two main reasons we stop by: first, the convenient location (to our apartment), and second, the free shot you receive for checking in on Yelp. Those are probably the only major perks of this establishment.Service is rather slow and prices are too high for the food quality/experience; we actually sat down here for brunch, and ended up leaving after ~20 minutes because our server still hadn't checked on us and the menu wasn't worth waiting for. I would definitely not recommend coming for food, and am ambiguous about whether I would recommend going out of your way for drinks. The only potentially redeeming quality would be their second floor patio, perfect for warm evenings. However, they told us they won't be letting people out there anymore due to ""neighborhood complaints about the noise.""",,,

Only 7 of our drinks came out and we had to wait another 10 for the other 2 before we could 'cheers'! We ordered a bunch of apps for the table and everyone ordered an entree. Apps were mediocre at best, entrees were not good at all. They even forgot one entree and by the time it arrived, everyone else was finished eating. Getting refills on our drinks was painfully slow too. I was only asked once if I would like another drink, despite having an empty glass in front of me for 20 mins.

167,Joe G.,"Manhattan, NY",10,41,0,2.0,11/17/2016,"Came here yesterday for football/marathon Sunday . We were sat right away but told we needed to leave by 5, which was no big deal considering it was a 1:00 game. We were served by a very friendly server, ordering a few oysters and a round of drinks to start (not in a rush). Everything was decent, so far so good. Then we ordered our mains, which took over an hour to come out, while we watched other people who sat down 30, 45 minutes after us finish their meals. Our server, who was swamped, couldn't do anything, and then we saw a manager and asked what was going on, and his ""answer"" was that the kitchen got a lot of tickets at once so things were slow. Now coming from over 10 years of hospitality experience, this means that the kitchen was swamped because there was no expeditor, and not enough people to pick up plates because these genius managers decided it was a brilliant idea to understaff on a football/marathon Sunday.  Our food finally arrived and was less than spectacular. I got a breakfast burger - the egg was over hard (advertized as sunny side up) and the burger practically raw (ordered medium). Our wings were just cooked - should be crispy, not chewy. We didn't send it back since we wanted to ead Sunday, not Tuesday, and judging by how poorly the management staffs the place, we'd be lucky if we got it.The service was phenomenal - our server, even though swamped, was attentive, friendly, and working his rear off. The bartenders were friendly as well. The problem with this place lies with the management - how bad are you at your job if you can't properly staff a place on a day you know will be super busy, also, when an order gets lost by the kitchen, and you ask them to make it on the fly (which I'm 100% confident that's what happened as I've done it before) please check to make sure the food is prepared properly?",1,,1

This was no exception - our bartender was really great. He kept a close eye on us and made sure our glasses were never empty! He also took down our food order quickly and the kitchen is obviously extremely efficient, because our food was out in remarkable time. We had the fries, brussel sprout salad and pork tacos. All three small plates were delicious and the portion sizes were very generous! This was more than enough food for 2 people (granted, girls - but still). I will definitely be back.

The buscuit it was all served on was a bit dry and crumbly but let's face it the proteins were more important anyway. And then there was the potatoes! Oh goodness those potatoes were awesome! As an Indian I appreciate spices and these potatoes were fantastic! Just then write balance of salty and spicy! Thrown on just few more sauteed onions and it will go from awesome to heavenly. There are few details that left me a bit confounded. For instance... Get waiters who know what gluten is and make sure all the menus have all the items you are serving (one of our menus didn't have all the items listed). Great atmosphere! Out door seating was awesome and if your sitting on the upper deck you have a nice breeze to keep you cool! Great stop. Great food!,,,

I had a the crab cake appetizer with a side of poached eggs and hollandaise (because they were out of smoked salmon). Their hollandaise was great and the eggs were poached perfectly. The crab cake was great with the eggs but it bit underwhelming on its own. The fried tomato tasted like, well, fried. My friends both got the pork eggs benedict which was beyond salty. There's dishes that are a bit over salted and then there's food so salty it's inedible, that pork was the later. I'm thankful we got the fried artichokes as an appetizer because it was truly the highlight of the meal. They were fantastically cooked and the lemon, butter dipping sauce was delicious(ly deadly).

196,Jack G.,"Athens, GA",316,48,2,5.0,10/15/2016,Awesome place to go for a well priced meal on the UES. 1$ Oysters are delicious. Good drinks. I've had the salmon and roasted chicken which were both delicious. Definitely recommend.,,,

Updated review",Went there today with family and all enjoyed it. Disappointed they no longer have the PB&J burger. They need to bring that back been craving it since last year when I had it. I like the brunch menu better now than when I last went last year. More good non breakfast stuff. Had their smoked old fashioned which was pretty awesome. It gets served in a corked bottle with the smoke in the bottle. I'd definitely recommend that.,,,
