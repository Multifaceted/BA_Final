0,Sandy D.,"New York, NY",260,136,496,4.0,6/6/2018,"Man, the last time I had Red Mango here was around 6 years ago, in middle school. Back when I used to obsess over the Rewards program.A lot has changed since then. Their space used to stretch up to the chairs along the right wall when walking in. Now, I almost missed seeing it as they only have a small stand squished between Sweet Churros and Kung Fu Tea. Because of this, there's actually very few toppings and flavors offered. It's self-serve now, which I actually don't like, as it takes away from the customer interaction. But it also allows me to take as many mochis as I pleased! My go-to yogurt flavors are White Peach and Mango. Fruity and tart, just the way I like my froyo. Although it melted pretty quick! With so many different dessert options in the food court, it's now easy to just glide over Red Mango as one of the choices. I fell victim to that, especially now that its popularity has gone downhill. But when I crave the occasional froyo, I know to go here. Like today.",1,,1
1,Kimberly J.,"Chantilly, VA",857,1772,24831,3.0,6/24/2018,"I like Red Mango.After eating around Koreatown, it's nice to be able to get a cool froyo treat. This location is self serve, which includes regular and seasonal flavors. Toppings are within reach and you help yourself. Pricing is according to the weight of your froyo creation and can really add up. It's on the pricier side. Employees are quick and friendly. This place can get packed, depending on the time you come. I wouldn't say this is my favorite frozen yogurt place, but it's still quite tasty. I appreciate the creamy and slightly sour flavor of their yogurt. Their fruits have always been fresh, whenever we've visited. Overall, a nice place to grab a cool treat on a hot (or in my case, also cold) day.",7,2,7
2,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,5.0,11/11/2018,"I wasn't going to get frozen yogurt but the flavors just looked too good to pass. I mean white peach and taro?!? Yes, please!! They're probably one of the best flavors I've had and plus I haven't seen them before. I really recommend the taro flavor! They don't have a tons of flavors and toppings like a lot of frozen yogurt places, but it was enough for me- I usually get gummy bears and popping boba.",14,9,16

It was a good amount of yogurt for the $4 something I paid, and service was super quick. The white peach one was honestly like drinking a calico drink, it was so sweet. But it's the only other yogurt option other than Pinkberry in the area, so grateful for that at least.",1,,
4,Grace W.,"Burns Park, Ann Arbor, MI",172,72,168,3.0,6/23/2018,"Enjoyed the choice of Asian-inspired flavors. I got taro, mango, and white peach, and they all tasted exactly like what they were labeled as (for some reason, I sometimes have this problem with froyo where they don't really turn out right). Their fruit toppings were all really fresh, which I enjoyed. Be warned that the toppings at this location are limited (it's in a food court), but sometimes it's nice to be forced to actually enjoy the yogurt itself instead of all the miscellaneous sugary products on top. Personally, I like Red Mango better than Pinkberry which is next door because I enjoy having the ability to control what's up with my froyo, but I doubt the flavor profiles are very different between the two.",2,2,1

6,Sue S.,"Newark, NJ",975,251,361,2.0,2/8/2018,"So I came here to use my $5 birthday reward. I came here once before back in high school but dang, this place was PACKED! Because Red Mango is clustered with all the other pop-up stands and restaurants, I almost missed it while walking into the store. It was very loud and hard to find seats to eat the frozen yogurt. I guess that's expected for a stand up Red mango store in New York with other food courts nearby.What I did like about this location however, was the cashier. She was very sweet and helpful. I didn't have my red mango card with me but she in put my email and was able to retrieve my coupon. The fro-yo wasn't too bad. I love the white peach from here and the fruit was fresh. Although I did have to pay an extra $1.50, I think it was well worth it. The wifi here sucks though.",,,

She gave me the same total.   When I pointed it out, she was very surprised. That tells me she is not even paying attention to what she's doing.  She then told me the offer is ONLY for smoothie. I showed her the screen in the phone and said ""it doesn't say that.""  She then nonchalantly said she'll try to put in the $2.  Of course it worked.  I'm very surprise at the incompetence of the worker.

9,Raymond H.,"Los Angeles, CA",118,280,176,3.0,1/22/2017,"Decent froyo at a decent price. Because of it's small size in the food court, it has a smaller selection than most places and that's why I'm giving it 3 stars. They have like 6 flavors to choose from, you can't ever go wrong with Taro or Vanilla bean froyo. I always go with mochi and mangos, but their mangos were obviously not ripe so I deferred in this situation. Seating is always a pain, but if you go to the third floor, there usually is some seating. Overall, its okay froyo.",,,

11,Jay K.,"New York, NY",31,174,139,5.0,9/10/2016,"This is my favorite go-to for fro-yo around Penn Station. First off, it's self serve, so you can put as much or as little as you want. They have various flavors. I usually mix about 2-3 flavors in a cup. The most recent and most delicious one I have tasted was the Taro flavor. I definitely recommend it. The cashiers are very friendly too.",,,
12,Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",109,702,905,3.0,8/6/2015,"A Red Mango among a bunch of other food places right in Koreatown. Red Mango is Red Mango -- sweet, but good yogurt, perfect for a hot day, and yummy toppings. The service was good here. We had a young girl as our cashier, and my friend kept saying she had some kind of rewards bday coupon. The girl kept trying to interrupt and explain something, which I thought was really cute. I mean, I appreciated she didn't get snappy at my friend, who wasn't really listening Lol. And customer service/cashier jobs aren't the easiest. In the end, she helped us, very pleasant and polite. They get busy at times because of the great location, and only have two registers  so maybe a teensy bit frazzled. There's a bench to sit across the way, and tables throughout, plus two additional levels. We managed to find a bench on the second level right when you walk up the first flight of stairs. But it can get crowded.",,,
13,Pauline F.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",100,29,41,1.0,6/16/2017,Their yogurt tasted like crapped. The original tasted like churn ice and sugar and the vanilla flavor was nowhere close. We wasted $12 here. Ask for a sample before you even buy it.,,,
14,Ellie L.,"Manhattan, NY",166,220,4,3.0,7/29/2016,"For fro-yo at an affordable price, this is a good place. The real question is whether or not you prefer to save money coming here, or go next door to Pinkberry and get arguably better quality fro yo. The cons of Red Mango (this location specifically) are:1. No AC in the summer time2. Limited seating (shared with all the other shops)3. Limited toppings as compared to other fro yo shops4. VERY limited flavor selection - like 4-55. Icy fro yo6. Chocolate chip topping is bizarrely ""chewy""",,,
15,Irene M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",104,202,656,5.0,1/9/2016,"I love Red Mango and Pinkberry! Even though they are right next to each other, I usually get Red Mango instead because it's conveniently located in Food Gallery 32 where I grab a small dinner AND it's cheaper than Pinkberry. I usually get the traditional yogurt flavor with different types of berries (unlike Pinkberry where you choose up to 3 toppings and pay for each additional topping, Red Mango charges by the content's weight), and fruity pebbles, it's a lovely way to finish the dinner meal. Yes to $3.50 healthy dessert!!!",1,,

18,Lily H.,"Edison, NJ",542,459,819,4.0,10/13/2013,"I just realized that the self serve froyo trend is like a reincarnation of the Asian shaved ice dessert... it is just something with a bunch of random crap on it. It appeals to the desire to create a mess. A colorful, edible mess. This may be why I am more likely to go to Red Mango or 16 Handles over Pinkberry (even though Pinkberry has great customer service): I like going through and putting my own sundae together. It's never very photo-worthy, but it means I can put two froyo flavors in one cup and different toppings on each. Or a dab of one flavor and more of another. etc. This Red Mango is just a stand in a food court. However it is near Penn Station so I wind up there now and again. There is also a Red Mango IN Penn Station now, by the Zaro's that is near the up escalator to get out on 7th and 32nd. But it's not self-serve.",2,2,3

Updated review","The taro (smooth and sweet) version of the froyo is a tasty version (not as sour as the original).And at 59¢/oz., still reasonable when feeding the little one!  Downside: the mochi was a stale.",,,
20,Faith C.,"Toledo, OH",65,305,433,3.0,7/14/2012,Red Mango in the states has never been one of my favorite froyo places but I decided to try it again.  I was surprised to see that RM is now self-serve (the last time I'd gotten RM was a LONG time ago when they sold the froyo by the sizes.) The price was 59 cents per ounce which seemed a bit expensive! I'm not sure if the price was because we were in NY and everything is more expensive in NY or what. The froyo was ok. It was more creamy than tarty. Definitely still not one of my favorite froyo places but it was decent.,,,
21,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,4.0,8/8/2011,"Food trends, like any other trend, can sometimes fade just as quickly as they cropped up. But frozen yogurt evidently managed to stick around. These days, thanks to shows like Gossip Girl, it's as ubiquitous in Manhattan as it was in California several years ago. Frozen yogurt is tarter than ice cream and lower in fat as it is made from milk instead of cream. Currently there are 2 major players in New York's fro-yo arena. Red Mango started out in Los Angeles in 2007. There are over 100 stores worldwide but only 7 in Manhattan. 2 of those are self-service stores. The self-service store in W. 32nd street has about 10 different flavors daily and various toppings to choose from. It is 59 cents an ounce for both frozen yogurt and toppings so this set-up gives you leeway to try different kinds of flavor combinations and control your own portions. The summer melon flavor is particularly refreshing for the hot weather. And pomegranate and the original flavor are all time favorites.",,,1
22,Sally C.,"San Francisco, CA",1053,413,245,3.0,3/25/2013,"So the reason I'm giving this Red Mango 3 stars is because it is self-serve (which can be both a good or bad thing for my waistline, depending on how aggressive I feel that day). Try their green tea, nutty potion (nutella flavor), original. I think these are the best. A lot of their flavors are way too sweet. Most of the time I prefer Pinkberry next door, but it is nice that you can switch up the flavors and load up on whichever toppings you feel like.",1,1,
23,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7750,14306,3.0,9/30/2016,"Apparently they downsized/changed for the worse, no longer accepting Club Mango and somehow serving worse product than other locations.",,,

Anyways, the service there was fast but hopefully they would consider adding taro.",,,
25,Annie Y.,"San Jose, CA",39,125,287,3.0,12/8/2013,I like the Red Mango here compared to some other locations that I have been to because of the variety of flavors that they offer.  From taro to green tea they are bound to have something that will suit your taste buds!  I like my froyo on the creamier side but this is definitely better than Pinkberry.The flavors are not as creative as 16 Handles though.,,,
26,Priti K.,"Jersey City, NJ",582,536,706,5.0,4/26/2013,"I was a Pinkberry snob for years until I discovered Red Mango. There's nothing more to say besides that the original yogurt (that's all I'm about) simply tastes better. They have more topping options and it's all pay per ounce. If you just need a quick fix, you don't need to pay a bajillion dollars for a full one. This is my jam.Also, at this particular location you kind of feel like you've crossed oceans and borders to South Korea! It's part of a huge cafeteria style set up that's trendy and fun. Looks like there are a lot of great Korean fast food options. I'll have to come back to end that meal with another Red Mango.",,,

I like it. I got the white peach flavor with mochi which was pretty solid. It was on the expensive side--cost about $5 for a really not that large portion. I should have looked at what the rate per ounce was. Anyways the white peach was really yummy! Not much else to say, just your typical Red Mango",,,

But if I tasted their yogurt blindfolded, I would not be able to tell the difference between Red Mango and the ""regular stuff"". There are two things that define quality frozen yogurt for me: thickness and tartness. My yogurt at Red Mango was thin, runny, and too sweet. The green tea flavor didn't taste any different from the blueberry, and within the next 10 minutes, all the flavors were kind of mushing together in that gross, unappetizing way. With every bite, I was crying a bit harder inside for not going to Pinkberry instead.I don't know if the other reviewers are BFFs with the staff, but I didn't find them helpful or friendly. In fact, they were too busy flirting with their girl friends who visited, leaving me--the customer--to the side. Whatever, I guess that's the point of ""self-serve.""",,,

The self service is definitely a competitive step up to compared to Pinkberry next door. The spacious area makes it easy for groups to come in and just serve themselves well. Good selection of flavors, they even provide a clear parfait cup for those who are into layering and seeing your product the way you want.

It's like any other typical red mango but self serve and definitely have a bigger assortment of ice creams/froyo. What made this amazing - they had taro froyo. TAROOO!!!! O.OOriginal is my favorite but mixed in with the taro was absolutely heavenly. However they don't always carry it so it's something to kind of just pop in and check out for dessert. I also prefer this more than spot because spot can take forever to make their desserts. I'm definitely coming back to try their other flavors but more so I can have more of that taro froyo. It literally tastes like soft taro candy puree - add mochi to it and it's the best dessert combination ever. Definitely go try it out!~happy eatings!,,,1
43,Buggy Z.,"Cambridge, MA",245,307,748,5.0,8/21/2011,"This is my favorite yogurt in New York, and comparable to Berryline in Cambridge.  Located within a food court within Koreatown, this Red Mango is self serve and contains many flavors, both regular and seasonal.  Maybe because I am Asian, and Red Mango is from Korea, but the flavors always taste so rich and pure.  Pineapple fro-yo really tasted like pineapple froyo; the white peach (so heavenly) really resembled the fruit.  The only flavor that I thought tasted a bit weird was the Ghirardelli Chocolate Fro-yo, but chocolate and froyo to me don't click anyway.I especially love how you are allowed to sample as many flavors as you want before filling your cup with a variety of flavors and delectable toppings.  Just be sure not to go overboard with what you fill the cup, as the price can add up quickly (it is sold by weight). Also, the food at the rest of the food court is just as amazing (especially Green Monster Crepe on the third floor), so be sure to save some room in both your stomach and wallet for them!",3,,

51,Deoroop M.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,220,317,4.0,7/19/2013,"On a hot, sweltering day, why gorge yourself with unhealthy foods infused with MSG and other unnatural goodies when you can have cool, refreshing, delicious frozen yogurt? For years, Red Mango has been my preference over Pinkberry. My usual fix is the peanut butter and strawberry smoothie with an extra helping of peanut butter. However, today I had no idea what to eat for lunch and decided to take the healthy alternative and have a large helping of yogurt topped with chopped strawberries and pineapples. The ingredients that are offered here are very fresh and ripe. The last thing you need is tart and tangy yogurt with sour fruit. If you are feeling adventurous, there are also many flavors that are available and in rotation all year round. Frozen yogurt is very healthy and it's the perfect substitute for a lunch/dinner/dessert or just when you want a small snack, especially on an unbearable humid day in NYC.",,1,

The place is self serve and goes by the oz. It could easily get expensive if you are not too careful of how much froyo and toppings you are placing within the provided cups, especially considering this is not the cheapest of the froyo places that is priced by weight.Located inside a 3 story food court within Korean Town, it's usually not too much of a hassle to find a available table someone on one of the floors.",,,

Fourth, Proceed to the toppings counter. I like to get a pinch of everything: mochi, most of the fruits, coconut flakes, chocolate chips, graham crackers, oreos, granola, rainbow & chocolate sprinkles, and more.

Funny thing is they rented out their space to other restaurants which means they pay less as far as rent is concerned yet they made us pay more. Red Mango is winning.

I'm really not sure if my memory is failing me or if this self-serve style Red Mango has always been priced this high, but $0.59/ounce is absolutely crazy!

I like making my own without the other person on the other side of the counter weighing my cup. The place is clean and the staff is cheerful. There are also a big variety of flavors of froyo for you to choose. Not to mention, the unlimited amount of toppings you can add on. Another reason why I like this place, my boyfriend and I accidentally drop our cup of froyo on their toppings counter. Extremely embarassing but the staff was totally nice and said it was ok. They told us to go ahead and get another cup. I felt so bad but good thing they didn't charge us. Good service indeed! This place get infinite props for that.",,,

I used to come here all the time a couple of years ago, and i came to this one about a month ago (even though there was a red mango closer to me) since they had a great variety of flavors and toppings. Imagine my disappointment to find out that they had made the stand smaller, which limited the flavors and toppings significantly. There was barely any variety to choose from and the fruit toppings they did have, were gross and not fresh. So disappointing that red mango doesn't even use real fruit for their smoothies also, since the price is so high. So from my last visit, which resulted in me feeling sick, i never will return here again.",,,

It was ashy like wayyyy too much protein add-in.The prices were fine and so was the flavor of my mango smoothie. The only real complaint I have was that the menu was super far away on a wall and difficult to read.

71,H K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,5,0,1.0,4/13/2015,"I usually prefer Red Mango to other companies offering similar types of frozen yogurt.  And I've liked this location in the past because it offers flavors that aren't always available at the other locations (like Taro and Green Tea).  But the last few times I've been here, I've noticed that the Taro flavor hasn't been available, the yogurt consistency/temperature was off, and the service was distinctly lacking.Yesterday's experience finally did the trick of convincing me that I need not revisit this location.  The frozen yogurt was already melting a bit as it came out of the dispenser.  After my companions and I prepared our yogurt and got in line to pay, we noticed that there was a long holdup with the customers in front of us.  One customer was handing over a lot of change to the person working at the register.  In the process, some coins dropped into the spoon dispenser.  The two people working at the register proceeded to dig among the spoons with their bare hands to find the coins.  After they finally extricated the coins, they returned the dispenser full of spoons back to the stand so that the next customers could use these spoons that had just kept company with loose change and fingers that have been handling money.  Um, no thanks.By the time we paid and were ready to eat, the yogurt was half melted.  When one of my companions who did not buy a yogurt the first time around returned to get some for herself, she and about 5 other customers had to wait in line while the one person manning the register proceeded to ring up at least 3 employees (of the food court?) who cut to the front of the line to pay for their sodas.  So the not-quite-frozen yogurt became even more melted and unappetizing for the whole line of customers who had to wait as the person manning the register rang up soda after soda for the employees dropping by on their breaks.",,,
72,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,3.0,8/19/2012,"Unlike most of the froyo joints I've been to in NYC (but more like others I've been to, I suppose), Red Mango is pretty much a DIY shop - you determine how much froyo you want, which flavors, which toppings, and you get charged based on the weight of your yogurt. This particular one is in a mini-food court in K-Town, right on the right when you walk in. Serving yourself is easy enough, and there are several flavors - some more of the fruit persuasion (peach, mango), as well as more traditional ice cream-like options (chocolate, vanilla bean). I ended up getting half vanilla and half peach, along with some fruit toppings and mochi. First, on a warm summer night, this will melt quickly - so eat up ASAP! As for the flavors, I did like the peach, but I paired it a bit poorly with the vanilla, which had a much heavier flavor. The fruit definitely didn't look as fresh as it does at a place like Pinkberry; the strawberries were a bit dry, for example. While I really did enjoy giving myself as much mochi as I wanted, it's a little bit too chewy - I like it to have a little bit of firmness when paired with the yogurt.All that said, it's definitely on the pricier side, and it's easy to get carried away - my yogurt ended up setting me back over $7, which is pretty pricey given that I got my yogurt in the smallest size available. I guess the moral of the story is don't get too carried away - if you get the biggest size available, you're probably going to end up paying upwards of $10. It's pretty decent froyo, but the higher price relative to other places puts it at a bit of a disadvantage.",,,
73,Kenny L.,"New York, NY",126,307,294,4.0,10/4/2011,"Do it yourself - fill it up and top it (and if you feel like it, repeat!).This place is so alluring because of the variety in the froyo flavors and topping options.Definitely recommend the mochi, strawberry, mango toppings - such a combination of sweetness and chewiness.After you're done and ready to indulge, remember to pay first! You pay by the ounce and the price might surprise you since it's so easy to stack, fill,  and top. Afterwards, grab your spoon and enjoy! (Watch out for that brain and/or throat freeze!)",1,5,6

Rather it was too tangy for my liking- and the consistency of the yogurt was not like that of soft serve that I'm used to at other red mango locations. It was too frozen. Nice assortment of toppings but I'd appreciate it if they were labeled cause it seemed like a few of the toppings were repeated like granola.

I don't even live in NYC....At the Food Gallery 32 there's a good deal that you can get a discount if you bring a receipt from one of the other food vendors. Don't know how long this deal is going on for, but check if you go there soon.Since it's self serve, you can choose how much you want and what kind of toppings you want. The staff is really nice and will help you sample however much yogurt you want. I like tart yogurt, so the selection is great to me. I'm a huge, huge fan of the Honey Badger flavor. Most frozen yogurt places, I get original and put honey on top. This does the work for me! It's not too much honey, but its not subtle either. Delicious! It goes with a lot of toppings, but I like to put fruit on it. The topping selection at this Red Mango is pretty good. I always get mochi and mango poppers and mandarin oranges. They also have things like candy, granola, bananas, chocolate, marshmallows! Try all sorts of combinations until you get the one you like (there's no one to blame but you if you don't like it so be careful and don't put everything in your cup...).

77,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,317,135,4.0,12/16/2011,"Red Mango is a self serve frozen yogurt franchise frequently frequented by Asian girls. (See reviews below) So if you want to date an Asian girl or if you want to take her somewhere on a date, Red Mango is most likely the place to go.I got the pomegranite and mango frozen yogurts and the Pome was better by far, just a little on the sour side gives it a nice kick while the Mango was just all sweet and I ended up feeling sick towards the end. I got a healthy portion of the regular size and filled it to the top with frozen yogurt, then added some various fruits like strawberries, rasp/blackberries and some kiwi. The yogurt itself is delicious, just imagine softer ice cream and without milk. The fruits were all fresh and if I had to go back I'd definitely go 100% pomegranite. Word of caution : everything here is charged by the ounce, and you'll be shocked how many ounces frozen yogurt and toppings will weigh. I built a healthy size cup and it came out to $8.XX with change. Do yourself a favor, fill up half a regular portion cup and top it off with whatever you like. If you finish that and you still want more, then go back for seconds. I filled up a regular cup to the top with yogurt and I wanted to throw up towards the end.

Textures can also vary, some icier than others. Would recommend asking them for samples first.* Sold by the ounce, and every time I go here, the final price seems like a lot.",,,
96,Liana L.,"Queens, NY",439,610,1785,5.0,8/16/2011,"I panicked at first when I couldn't find Red Mango; where did it go?!?!? After we resigned ourselves to going to PinkBerry, we thankfully saw Red Mango in this new location. Whew. :) And I was ECSTATIC to find that it was self-serve. Self-serve + Red Mango = amaaaazing. I usually find that self-serve can get kind of messy/nasty, but this looked clean and awesome. The guys behind the counter were really nice about giving us taste trials. Summer melon, pomegranate, sonoma strawberry, pineapple, and white peach are just some of the 8 flavors available. So, so good. (Of course, don't try to get all of them :O Stick with just one or two). We wandered upstairs in search of somewhere to sit and were delighted by the inviting, open chairs & tables. When I later went in search of the bathrooms, we saw that there were even more options on the third floor. This will probably be my new favorite place to loiter, with a red mango cup in hand. :D",,,
97,Yoshi M.,"New York, NY",311,102,60,4.0,9/4/2011,How can you go wrong when you have self serve?!?! Make it like you want... Which usually means packing unnecessary amounts of candies and toppings on ur yogurt :p  Hahahahahaha. Love red mango!!!! Pomegranate and original especially!,,,

99,Tim W.,"West Orange, NJ",64,139,55,5.0,6/17/2011,It's Red Mango that's a self serve! What more can be said? Although there might be a tendency to get more than you bargained for because everything is measured by weight AFTER you already made your uber custom frozen soft serve yogurt. So BEWARE! =]It's new and really clean. It's located in a large food court facility despite the size on the inside seats might be a hard to come by since it is in K-Town and anyone that frequents knows how packed it can get at night and on weekends.,,,

I also spilled some sprinkles at the topping bar, to which another diligent employee quickly brushed it away with a mini swifter.Hey, if I'm going to pay a decent amount for froyo, at least this place is clean.

It's cool that you can puut your own topping on and add whatever you like, but when it's 59 cents i may have to rethink about putting the extra 20 blueberries or the extra 4 scoops of oreo's.

Seriously, this froyo is so bad it has compelled me to review it, and who the hell reviews froyo (except for these other 89 people)? So, I consider myself a froyo freak. I love froyo and when 16 handles expanded right near my old job I was overly excited. My new job now- the froyo options are lacking - especially because I hate that trendy tart stuff (that's what we call YOGURT, people not FROZEN yogurt. Can we get some TCBYs back?). I figured I'd give this place a shot because they have ""real"" froyo flavors. Both the nutella and white chocolate flavors, however, were watery, runny, and tasteless. Literally, I would describe the flavors as ""cold."" The toppings bar is great, and obviously trying to be 16 handles.

111,Mohammad H.,"Brooklyn, NY",86,126,0,5.0,9/8/2012,"This is probably one of the easiest reviews I'll have to write. This red mango location is absolutely perfect. If you're done with your day of shopping over at 34, or if you've just finished eating over at Woorijip or Food Court 32, then you can just finish off with a frozen yogurt from Red Mango. There's at least 6 flavors at any given time, the toppings are all fresh and great. And you can get as much or as little as needed. So if you actually end up with a bowl that cost you over $11, its only your own fault. Seating can be a little spare and might require you to walk up to the 3rd floor if its busy, but you can go walk outside and eat anyways. Always came here for frozen yogurt, will continue to.",,,

120,Melanie T.,"Manhattan, NY",27,332,225,4.0,6/29/2011,"The frozen yogurt is soooooo much better than Pinkberry! The original is creamier and less icy, but it still has a slightly tart taste to it. I also tried the vanilla, which tasted kind of artificial, but it wasn't too bad. Another flavor I tried was the strawberry, which was icy and tasted like strawberry syrup. I actually kind of liked it though, but I wouldn't recommend getting a huge portion of it. There is a very nice selection of toppings from fresh fruit to cereal. I added mango, strawberries, and these orange little gel balls. The gel balls are awesome. I think they were mango flavored. The outside is firm and tight, but when you bit into one the mango juice bursts out. My only complaint was that the juice had an aftertexture I did not enjoy. The flavor was great though. So my advice is get the original and lots of it.",,,

130,Ashley O.,"Queens, NY",78,106,5,4.0,4/13/2011,"I love Red Mango so much that whenever I have to take a flight out of NY I try to book it at LaGuardia Airport because of the tiny Red Mango station they have there. I get excited every time they open up a store closer to my hood and it's even better when it's a self-serve place that way you know they'll have more of the newer flavors. This is the only self-serve place I know of in NYC. My main issue is the 'one size' cup on hand and I guess that encourages more yogurt and toppings to pay for but sometimes you just want a small portion (no matter how addictive). This store also has a somewhat clever setup with other food places in the same space. I would give it 5 stars but I feel better knowing someone with gloves has handled the toppings throughout the day instead of DIY customers. Also, maybe I just like being served with the finished product or hearing other customers (mis)pronounce ""mochi"" when they ask for toppings. Anyway, Pinkberry can suck it.",,,
