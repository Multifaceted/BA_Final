0,Brittani W.,"Buffalo, NY",85,26,33,5.0,10/19/2018,"This review is about the atmosphere, not food. My 5 girlfriends and I came to NYC on a weekend trip. We explored the city and did the typical dinner in Time Square. We ended our night coming to Joshua Tree for some drinks and music. We were beyond impressed. We all got basic bottles of beer, nothing fancy but we had such a blast. The music was perfect and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for. None of us are the ""club type"" but we wanted a little more than just a few drinks at a bar. The music is all 80's and 90's hits and we loved literally every song that played. The entire bar sang along, and the music videos played on the dozens of tv's along the walls. I would highly, highly recommend this bar and I cannot wait to go back again next time I visit the city!",2,,
1,James J.,"New York, NY",7,30,2,1.0,9/26/2018,"Millar is one of the most unprofessional and rudest bartenders I've ever met. I came on New Year's food took almost an hour, we were asking where it was. He was very rude when we asked and would just brush it off and just made every time we ordered a drink from him unpleasant. I didn't write a review then but I said something to the manger because it was absurd. I come from a family of people working in the service industry so I'm very forgiving of these thing but this guy is the worst.I came back almost 10 months later to grab a beer with a friend, and he ran away as soon as we went to place an order. When he returned (still ignoring us) we confronted him and he said he was still angry about New Year's holding a grudge. Possibly the most absurd unprofessional behavior I've ever seen in a restaurant/bar. Not a bad bar bar, just avoid Millar.",,,1
2,Sheena P.,"New York, NY",250,55,177,4.0,7/29/2018,"My group of 6 got to Joshua Tree at 5pm on Friday and it was pretty empty. As the night progresses it gets packed, the music changes and gets way louder.Drinks: Overall a great happy hour from 4-8pm! Frose for $4, shots for $5, some drafts for $5!The frost was very sweet, tasted like an ice pop from my childhood, and had minimal liquor. But it's pretty and good if you're in the mood for a sweet drink.Food: My friends and I tried the Nachos, Rueban, Veggie burger and quesadilla. The food was decent for bar food, not mind blowing but I also wasn't disappointed. My only qualm was it says the nachos come with guacamole and mine didn't. But I was too hungry to ask and get that sorted. Atmosphere: Joshua Tree is pretty laid back and casual. Perfect for after work with friends or coworkers, and great for larger groups!",,,
3,Caroline Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",92,66,17,2.0,7/29/2018,"Joshua Tree is basically a collection of underage Europeans and middle-aged Murray Hill residents, so it's great if that's what you're looking for. The bar service is okay, and the drinks are a typical lower end NYC bar price. The music is loud, and you can give the DJ your music suggestions, which most places don't do. But the men here are almost always very creepy, and that's an automatic no no from me, for obvious reasons.",,,
4,Eugene C.,"Manhattan, NY",414,50,131,3.0,6/28/2018,"The 3 star rating that the place currently has is apropos. This place captures the spirit of Murray Hill. A brunch of drunk bros broing out to 80's music. Just hours and hours of people singing along to Bon Jovi's ""Living on A Prayer"" or Eddie Money's ""Take Me Home Tonight"" and other hits from the 80s and 90s. It's a fun place if that's the type of fun you seek. Fair warning: the floor gets a bit sticky with all the drinks that people spill in this place.",1,1,1
5,Rosio Y.,"Mount Hope, NY",85,61,118,4.0,6/26/2018,"Solid affordable weekday lunch spot on Murray hill, they offer lunch items for $8.95. The food tasted great, and it was pretty decent quality for the price. It tasted fresh and the portions were big. They also have a lunch happy hour that features beers, cocktails and frozen drinks for $3 or $4. Overall a great experience, I'll will certainly be back.",,,

8,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,2.0,6/14/2017,"Joshua Tree has the potential to be so much more. Upon entrance at 630pm on a Wednesday, it was empty. My group of 10 easily surrounded the bar in the back.Right off the bat I was super excited to find an empty bar on a beautiful Wednesday evening. There were tv screens everywhere, which makes a perfect place for a sports game viewing.Unfortunately we learned right off the bat that our bartender was new. I ordered a simple white wine and my buddy ordered a mixed drink. It took the gentleman over 30 minutes to bring us our drink. However I understood that it was his first day so I cut him some slack. This all went on a downward spiral after I ordered my second drink. Not only did he forget about it, he also forgot about our food that we put in upon entering. All together it took us an hour to get our pigs in the blanket. On a positive note the food was fantastic. We got the platter of appetizers and it was delicious. The pricing was great as well. Overall, this could be a great place to hang out with some buddies and catch a game. If they don't step up their service level however, I would never come.Pro tip-check in to get 10 dollar pitchers of budlight. Awesome deal for a midtown bar!",,,
9,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",208,70,12,4.0,11/2/2017,"Came here on Halloween (risky for a 25 year old, I know) but we had a fun time! It was pretty crowded when we arrived but we made our way to the back of the bar where we were able to secure our own little area by the bar so it was perfect. I did not realize how big the place was just from looking at the outside!The music is fun, and I love that they play the music videos on all of the televisions. Provides a different experience than the other bars for people this age. I definitely would return!",,,
10,Tony E.,"Bronx, NY",42,64,0,4.0,8/27/2018,Nice place. Pretty decent menu and happy hour specials. Friendly staff. Nice and clean and a great atmosphere. Definitely a good place for some adult beverages and comfort food.,,,
11,Steve Z.,"Ardmore, PA",41,73,5,2.0,7/5/2018,"JT used to be amazing! But now... Very disappointed by this place. 5 years ago they played almost all 80s but now they have this horrible new playlist in which they mix in Spice Girls, NSync, 90s rap and Backstreet Boys. Ugh, just awful! Joshua Tree used to be the greatest 80s bar/club in all of NYC but now it's just completely ruined. 2 stars because they still play 80s 30% to 40% of the time but not nearly enough. If Joshua Tree ""loves the 80s"" as they claim on their  screens all night long, then prove it! Switch off the Backstreet Boys and put on Billy Idol for cryin' out loud.",1,1,1
12,Andrew C.,"Pomona, CA",412,6,0,4.0,9/24/2018,"Went on 9/20 at night. Was kinda disappointed because I read it was an 80's bar, but they were playing a lot of 2000's like Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus. Although the music wasn't what I was hoping for, the service and drink prices made up for it. Being a weekday night, it was pretty dead, but the bartender, Debbie, was incredible and really fun. Maybe this place is more poppin on a weekend.",,,

Updated review",Love the concept!! I grew up listening to the 90s songs and this place brought back a lot of memories. The energy and ambience was great. Bar was really busy and it was hard to order drinks but overall a good place to have fun.,,,
14,Jenna L.,"Syracuse, NY",314,378,1567,4.0,5/9/2017,Joshua Tree is a cool Irish bar with the nicest bartenders around! I've been here multiple times at night and the vibes are always chill and music always good (they play mostly 80's+ 90's music). A few of my friends were visiting the city so we went to Happy Hour down the street then decided to come here to grab some food. First time eating here. We got the wings and quesadillas. Wings were too spicy for me but the quesadillas were delish. I wish I got our waitresses name because she was AWESOME! There's a ton of good bars on the street so it's a good place to bar hop in the city.,2,,2
15,Vivek D.,"Queens, NY",133,193,74,3.0,7/27/2017,"oh Joshua Tree.  I've been here several times, each of which has its own crazy experience to follow.  I've been here for happy hours during the weekdays and then late at night on the weekends.  Happy hours were fun, no complaints.  Weekends aren't too bad, but it is hit or miss based on who is there.  You can have a lot of fun dancing to old school and current songs.  Just remember that Murray Hill is full of barely-21 and/or post-college grads.  In the late nights, you may end up with a creep or two in Joshua Tree.  They seemed to bother a few of my friends the last time I was there.  Not a knock on Joshua Tree itself, but merely a reality of the area.",,,
16,Karl M.,"New York, NY",5,8,0,1.0,2/10/2018,This place is full of assholes who enable theft.  Enjoy. Just white trash on white trash.,,,
17,Jackie G.,"Mount Tremper, NY",0,10,1,3.0,6/23/2018,"Joshua Tree has good happy hour specials and the brunch and lunch menus have a lot of good options which is why I give it 3 stars. We only came for drinks but  had ordered sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese. We waited for 45 minutes. They said the wait was due to a party of 25 in the back room but we were never advised us it would be such a long wait for two apps until we asked if they would be out soon. Worse off, they said the kitchen was backed up but the Mac and cheese came to us cold, room temperature at best which makes me think it was ready long before we got it. We didn't get any discount and our waitress barely even appologized for the inconvenience.",,,

Updated review","ok I want to leave a more cognizant review of my experience at JT (I decided that its nickname is JT, unless someone else decided before)So, despite the fact that it was getting late and I had, as will become very obvious if you venture down and read my original review, drank enough already, I legit couldn't leave. I was like glued to my seat because I was so fucking into what was happening. What was happening was the best blast from the past I could've asked for. It makes me flinch to draw attention to my previous review but there you will find more deets about specifics. To further demonstrate the magnitude with which I couldn't leave and therefore how many beverages consumed as a result, I basically drank an entire liter of seltzer intermittently throughout the night. The flavor of seltzer is, unfortunately, not as appealing to me as it was before. Bar was super packed on Wednesday, there's a decent amount of space actually. We luckily managed to find a table by the door. Service was pretty good, our asses didn't have to leave the stool the whole night (except for potty of course). Speaking of potty, never had to wait to use the bathroom. Actually outrageously impressive considering the bar was busy. Very thankful, due to my inability to remove myself from the 80s/90s situation, I gave my bladder quite the stretch on a few occasions. It was so fucking loud though that we basically had to scream to have a conversation. My parents the morning after on the phone were like ""did you just wake up or something? your voice sounds weird"". Yeah, Constanza and Michael, that's what it is. Oh also, I was impressed by the number of beers on tap but I guess it's not that extraordinary for a ""sports bar"". Drinks were strong AF. Seems like a great place to come back occasionally or bring friends from those years of your life but that whole 90s thing can get old after a while.",1,1,
19,Cindy K.,"New York, NY",694,244,372,1.0,4/30/2018,This bar/lounge is complete trash. The bouncers are condescending and its full of creeps. My friend got hit by a regular for defending his girlfriend and the bouncer refused to help and instead defending the offender. This place is ridiculous and I hope nothing but them to get what they deserve through karma itself. 0 tolerance for this bull and I'm actually shocked they haven't received any class action lawsuits.,,,
20,Sarah G.,"Seaside Heights, NJ",0,13,2,3.0,8/13/2018,Sticky floor but really fun vibe! The crowd ranges from 21-50. The older people were in the front by the entrance and the younger crowd tend to hang more towards the back so don't be intimidated to come in by the older crowd! Nice bar to meet people if you're still a student or a recent graduate! The bartenders were really nice but I noticed I was charged more than I spent so make sure you keep your receipts!!,,,
21,Shannon F.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",154,169,23,3.0,3/22/2017,"A fun bar to go to as the play all 90 music videos on their tvs. However, it is a college bar and the average age is 22.Not my scene anymore but I understand the hype.",,,

It's for the drink specials, cheap beer, and rockin 80's songs with periodic smoke machine effects.They play music videos of each song. Expect a lot of backstreet/nync (ok not totally 80s) but also Madonna, etc.Its a fun bar where it's ok to dance, have a few drinks, and meet new people.Very much enjoy: thumbs up!",1,,

Updated review","Just wanted to check in and say that even though I haven't been here in a while since I no longer venture to Murray #Thrill (/#chill), this place will always be #1 in my heart. I miss you so much J-Tree -  we will see each-other soon. Can't wait to dance the night away to 80s music videos oh so soon. Until we meet again.",2,1,2
24,Tj S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",609,61,98,1.0,3/2/2018,"So we started with a great time here. Drinks were served fast and moderately ok. The problem surged when one in our group went to ask the DJ for a very reasonable song from the 90s, 500 miles, by the proclaimers.  The DJ was extremely rude and yelled about trying to eat his PIZZA while working and getting bothered by a request. Seriously. This place would be super fun other than the DJ who brings this down significantly. On today's date for reference.",,,
25,Sam V.,"New York, NY",81,189,468,4.0,8/21/2017,"Friend and I were looking for a bar in the Murray hill area and was directed to Joshua tree. We saw their happy hour deals for Friday evening and immediately we agreed that ""nachos and 2 margaritas for $15"" was the type of pregaming deal we were craving. Once we were seated our server was extremely attentive. She legit came by like every ten minutes to check on our drinks and if we wanted more food. Food was obviously decent- prob all frozen stuff. Drinks were okay. I would for sure come back here tho. the vibe is certainly better than other divebars in the area. And there's room to breathe so that adds to the appeal of the ambiance.",,,
26,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",484,663,591,4.0,7/4/2017,"I love Joshua Tree. Now, I've never eaten here, only drank, but every time I go, it's always a good time. Great vibes all throughout the night. Gets very crowded at night though, so come early if you want  a table or a spot at the bar. They play a lot of 80s and 90s music - it's basically everything I listened to growing up. There are a few obscure songs here and there, but  you'll recognize most of them. It's great because everyone loves to sing along, which makes it more fun imo. Been here a few times now and each time, I had a blast. Will keep coming back to Joshua Tree!",,,
27,Jean R.,"Alexandria, VA",273,4,0,1.0,7/6/2018,Ordered a lagunitas IPA and got something that tasted like a watered down bud light -.-.  Definitely not an IPA.  Zero.,,,
28,Ceren A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1160,1193,7572,3.0,7/22/2016,"As an 80's child, I really have enjoyed this place&music. We went after work on Tuesday night, was not empty, was not crowded. Good for groups on weekdays for sure.Do not come hungry! Yes they do have snacks but they to not have waiter service, self serve for both drinks and food. We ordered a combo platter with wings, mozzarella sticks, some fish balls and chicken fingers. Had to wait like 15 minutes to pick it up. Taste quite Allright. 16 oz. tap beers are $8 and around.You can do open or close checks at the bar. We brought a cake from outside and they were fine with that too. They celebrated the birthday with a subtitle on TV screen saying our friend's name.Really chill and comfortable place. There is is second bar which I assume on duty on busy weekend times so you do not carry drinks all the way from entrance to back room.",11,4,7
29,Chloe M.,"Manhattan, NY",61,5,14,5.0,5/27/2016,"When I grow up, I want to be the DJ at Joshua Tree. I'm pretty sure he just plays the same songs over and over again, yet the crowd loves it. He is like the Calvin Harris of Murray Hill. Like clockwork, usually after 11pm on any given night I end up there and  I'll request ""Like a Prayer"". And he will play it, tout suiteYes, is this the same bar I went to in my former days of sparkling youth? True. Do I feel ashamed, out of place and old when I walk in, especially after the bouncer waves me through without showing my ID as I tell him with certainty ""I'm old"" and he nods with pity? Sure.Do I feel sheepish when my friend of the same age face plants as we walk in and the young girls in their Forever 21 outfits come to help as if their grandma fell? Perhaps.But it's worth it, I assure you. Once you head to the back of Joshua Tree, you are instantly transported, my friend. Take a few cheeky shots with some beers to soften the tequila aftertaste. The fog machine and strobe lights start and suddenly all of that does not matter. It's just you, your mates, some sweet 80's tunes, some short frat guys saying incoherent things and MAGIC!Yeah, I should and do go to bars where you stand around and have adult conversations about grownup things (oh the elections, oh mortgages?, babies, oh job stuff blah blah blah.) But at Joshua Tree you don't have to talk. In the words of Lady Gaga, patron saint of the early 2000s, you ""Just Dance"". And it is fantastic. Even if I don't take over the old guy DJ's spot when I grow up, I will still come back to you Joshua tree, with my walker in tow and sporting my adult diapers.",5,12,6

Couldn't really tell if there was alcohol in it.The service was ok. It was pretty basic. The interaction was mostly simple A and B convo trying to get a drink.

There is a fog machine and a dance floor full of post-college frat stars seeing if they still have any ""game"". It's essentially a large hall of people drunkenly falling into each other yelling the wrong lyrics to their parent's favorite songs.The Things: The drinks are standard lower-priced Manhattan bar drinks.

It is a frat type of bar, so if that's not your scene, it's best to avoid. Meanwhile, if you're an 80s child, this is YOUR SPOT. They have at least 8 TVs inside and they display the music video of every song playing. It's a nice thing to appreciate if you miss how awesome music videos used to be. I must add that for a small bar in Murray Hill, there are a lot of friendly people in there. Very easy to strike up a random conversation. We rolled in 5 guys deep and we had a blast.

She said it was, and I and my friend proceeded to order that beer for the entire game. When then check came, she billed us $7.50 per beer, rather than the $4 she said it would be. Our check was almost double the price. When I asked, she and the other bartenders were AWFUL.

Even on nights where it's not about sports, they keep things entertaining with karaoke, theme nights, etc.People complain that the place gets too crowded.  That happens for a reason.  They keep a nice party atmosphere.  It definitely has that post-college frat-house hangers-on vibe to it on Fri/Sat nights.It's definitely--for the most part--a place for the younger crowd.People looking for a serious bar should move along.",2,,

After 8pm they charge $7 for a pint of domestic beers and $8 for beers like Stella.  Dag Joshua Tree, $7 for a bud/budlight?So if you're someone who drinks at least 6, 7 beers when you go out you can expect to spend at least 50, 60 dollars.

67,Kate K.,"Peekskill, NY",907,596,689,3.0,8/26/2013,"My first experience here was after a long ass day of bar crawling throughout the entire city and our last stop was here. I figured it would be a one beer and bounce kinda place but as I ventured further into the back of the bar, I was met with huge screens projecting spice girls and whitney houston tunes and I thought I was taken into a beautiful time warp.  Danced until I thought I would faint and it was amazing!  I've been dying to come back and dance the night away some more!That being said I made a return visit one Thursday night with friends around 9 or so.  The bar had a few heads but the back dancing room was empty--granted it was rather early.  SO we sat at a front table, ordered drinks, an app, sandwich and a salad. Cool, lets do this!  Two rounds later and we're wondering where the food is at.. We ask the waitress twice and apparently it was forgotten in the kitchen... um k?  We waited for what seemed like an hour and a half until our simple orders came out. Thank god the calamatz was good bc I would have been even more annoyed.  They didnt comp us anything for the huge ass wait so my girl asked hah!  They gave us a round of soco-lime shots on the house. Ok I guess that works but another beer would have been fine too.Overall I dont hate the place bc the music is fabulous but the damn wait for simple apps and food was wack!  Ppl inside here typical college/ late 20's scene.  Bouncers kept tryna get in my cookie jar but it was aiiight.  I would come back here for dancing only-- even the beer took too long to reach me.",1,3,1

New York City has changed so much and I'm not sure it's for the better. Last week was filled with frat guys who supposedly went to NYU or whatever and it was so crowded and sweaty it was IMPOSSIBLE for my friend and I to get a drink despite us waiting at the bar for 15 minutes!

73,Michael W.,"Manhattan, NY",1355,597,1222,5.0,2/6/2013,"Overall a GREAT place to dance your buttocks off to some awesome 80's and 90's music. Any bar that plays strictly 80's and 90's is all aces in my book!I come here at least twice a month and absolutely love it!They have plenty of TVs and projector big-screens around to show classic music videos so you can imitate awkward off-beat dance moves and seem perfectly normal (FINALLY a place where I fit in!)Their bartenders are pretty friendly and they have table service even on busy nights, but you're better off making your way to the bar. As other reviewers have said, it can get pretty crowded but that's the magnetism of being awesome! Fri/Sat nights seem to be the busiest, and I remember seeing a sign that they have karaoke but I do not recall when or if they still do it.Their drinks are pretty cheap, and they have IPA on tap as well as several others which adds to the appeal. It can be a little bit of a hike - unless you don't mind transferring and taking the 6 (unless you live off the green line - unfortunately I do not) but it's usually pretty quick. Just remember that it's about a 10 minute slow-staggering-falling-down-drunk walk to the subway after a long night of libations and ETOH-inspired dance epiphanies.

78,Patrick H.,"Lexington, NC",0,1,0,5.0,4/27/2014,"The Joshua Tree is the most amazing bar I have ever been to. Admittedly, I am one of those ""fist-bumping bros"" in a hot tub time machine with all my other bros and we don't have pants on, but does that change the fact that a good bar is a good bar?   We arrived at a sprightly hour of approximately 10pm and were immediately inundated with awesomeness and brovity. Of course, I had a Jos A Bank trim fit button down on, which was unbuttoned to my waistline in order to show off the chest quaff, and the bouncer only made me button it up one more button.   We hit the dance floor- stat. Fist pumping and bud light showers ensued. I took my shirt off on multiple occasions and was only told by the bouncer that one button had to be buttoned. How great is that?!   At no point in the night do I remember waiting very long for drinks, but due to the corpulent amounts of fireball that was dumped down my suckhole, that isn't a very good gauge. That being said, the service wasn't memorably bad, and bud light and fireball is on the menu-  'nuff said.   Many chics thought my bros and I were gay due to the amount of bro on bro grinding, but they were just upset that we were all locked up and they couldn't do us. Did they really expect this meat to be on the market?!    All that being said, The Joshua Tree is a pretty epic bar. 80s music abounds, and frat-tastic antics are smiled upon- clearly a winning combination.

Within the first minute I walked in, I wanted to walk right back out. It was friggin jam packed in there! And they were all college kids! But I knew I had to go in...all the way to the back to meet my friend to celebrate her birthday. I literally shoved and pushed my way to the back.

My fiance and I walked in, completely unprepared for what we would see:LASERS.FOG.STICKY FLOORS.PULSATING BEATS.HIGH FIVES.Joshua Tree is every single out-of-hand college party you've ever been to. Screaming girls, douchey bros, cheap beers, & seriously? A fog machine? We spent 5 minutes squeezing through the packed crowd, trying to find my friend. And as we got to their table, he & his wife were packing up to leave! A minor blessing hahah. The four of us squeezed back through the crowd, THROUGH AN ACTUAL BAR FIGHT?! lol, and found our way to the door. All in all, we spent about 15 minutes inside -- enough to realize that Joshua Tree, much like my early twenties, is a place I never, ever need to experience again.Once outside, the four of us laughed. ""Have you ever felt so old?"" My friend's wife told us that about an hour before, we missed a drunken, sloppy, dramatic breakup - complete with tears, screaming, & spilled drinks.

82,Kim H.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",109,23,1,2.0,3/2/2014,"Not sure why, but both times I've been to Joshua Tree it has smelled like a drunk person projectile vomited everywhere and they desperately tried to cover it up with Pine-sol. Is that your air conditioning system that smells that way? The floor (which is always suspiciously sticky?) Is it the stale mystery fog you pour on everyone every 2 minutes? Who knows. I'm 24 and can still get down with the collegey bars if I'm in the right mood, and this place has potential to be super fun because it's filled with giant TVs playing crowd pleasers like 80s and 90s hits and lots of tunes that induce drunken sing-a-longs... i.e. 'Living on a Prayer' and 'Don't Stop Believing' peppered with Britney Spears, Madonna, Whitney and the occasional Blink 182 and Third Eye Blind. If you're on your 4th long island iced tea and everyone around you is screaming the lyrics together, it can get kind of fun. It can also be your personal hell.I felt like I needed to be shit-faced to be here. The amount of bros fist pumping at their 'dudes night out' was enough to make me cringe. Go away, bros. That being said, getting a drink is like a journey to Mordor. Shoving through wall-to-wall sweaty people just isn't enjoyable. Be prepared to wait 15+ minutes at the bar, and then empty your savings account on a super weak mixed drink. Go with beer or shots here to get your money's worth. Pretty sure I paid like $35 for two well drinks that tasted like water. All the while, the bros are assaulting me with their over-zealous fist pumping elbows flying everywhere, and the sluttiest of the slutty girls are Kim K ugly-crying at each other and giving me dagger eyes for not letting them take my spot at the bar.

86,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3376,3.0,12/17/2013,"A mid-sized group of us went to Joshua Tree on a Saturday night, primarily for one reason (aside from just alcohol) -- 80s music! If you like to get down to some older beats, ranging mostly from 80s to 90s (Whitney Houston, Poison, Salt n' Peppa, MC Hammer, etc.) without a doubt, you're going to have a good time at Joshua Tree. Otherwise, this is a very typical, generic sports bar if you judge it by the cover alone. It's quite deceptive at first, especially if you're here before 9PM. After 11PM, expect full-blown 80s/90s music plus music videos playing in the background. It surely does get crowded though.Somehow, our group managed to stay here for a good 6 hours. If the company is fun, and you're in the mood to dance, you'll easily spend all night here. We arrived around 7:30PM, which is honestly much too early. However, it's a lot less crowded around that time. It's first come, first serve if you're looking for a seat/table. The look of Joshua Tree isn't terribly intriguing and perhaps underwhelming at first. It fits the generic template for very typical American sports bar, which is a bit disappointing; you'd think they'd play on the 80s theme at least a little. They have several TVs playing your favorite sports. That night, it was all about college football, but we cheered with the crowds anyway. There is a bar at the front and the back, which is very convenient. The main feature and selling point of Joshua Tree is undoubtedly the music. The best time to come here for that would be 10PM and after. Anytime before that, it's weird: They play the sports games announcements intermittently with the music. It interrupts the whole flow of the music, and you'd wish they'd stop playing the announcements.Joshua is a fun spot to get loose, hang out with your friends, and dance to some classics. Although, the music could have used more 80s and more variety. It was heavily 90s mixed randomly with current-day Beyonce. In spite of the negatives, I could definitely see myself back here.",5,4,3

97,Amber W.,"Manhattan, NY",190,29,6,4.0,3/3/2014,"Met my roommate here after work on a weekday.  The sign outside said cheap drinks so we settled here.  $5 well drinks, not too bad for the east 30's.  The bartender was an older woman that seemed sweet but cool when speaking with customers.  We offered to buy her a shot, she took it without hesitation or chaser! My kind of bartender.  The crowd kind of sucked.  My roommate and I were 2 of the 8 people at the bar, and of 10 in the entire place.  This was after work on a weekday so it seemed out of the ordinary.  We ordered food, typical bar food.  We had a panini and a burger.  Overall, it was cheap and it was quiet.  A nice place to play catch up and connect four!",,1,
98,Tina M.,"Spokane, WA",143,176,57,4.0,4/19/2011,"Facts:-I stumbled in this place on New Years Eve/Day about 2am-My rating may be a little off because of the above-This is the PERFECT place to go if you are already drunk-I vaguely remember dancing with a good looking guy to a spice girl song that HE knew all the lyrics to-I remember paying entirely too much for our drinks-I didn't care because I was already drunkSo, on that note, if you are looking for an overly crowded place to just act like a complete idiot and sing and dance the night away to 80's songs (which happens to be my favorite) this is the place to go. It can be hard to get a drink because of the crowd, and the drinks are rather pricey on weekend nights but I left convinced I had a new favorite bar (that was partially the alcohol speaking). Its not a classy place by any means and the crowd is younger, but it's definately a good time. Of course, Im totally basing this off of a one time experience and under the influence but hey, isn't that what you're looking for when you're drunk? I've been meaning to return but it's just a little out of my way...soon we will meet again....",1,2,1

He wasn't doing much so he said he could come meet up.  I then hit up Jimmy on MySpace, but he was busy doing a puzzle, not one of those  easy 100 piece puzzles, but one of those 5,000 piece ones.  And to make it even harder, it wasan ocean puzzle so there were just a lot of different blues.  I don't even know if there were fish in the puzzle.  Anyway, Jimmy couldn't go because he was preoccupied. I then texted this girl I met at McDonalds a few weeks ago and she didn't respond.  She actually hasn't responded to any of my texts other than once saying ""who is this?"".  I text her once or twice a day, but i think she just has bad cell service so the texts don't come through.  Anyway, my last text was to my dad to see if he wanted to grab a drink.  He just told me to not call him anymore, so there's that.  Tony and I ended up walking around Murray Hill for a while.  We played a game where we competed to see who got the most high fives from strangers.  I got two (which was pretty sweet).After playing that game, it was pretty late (around 1am) so we ended up just walking by J Tree and going home.  It probably would have been fun there though.",7,13,5

If you are into dancing, singing, drinking and shenanigans to 80s and 90s music for a fun night, this is the place for you. Yes it does get crowded here but usually between the hours of 10pm & 12am. But that didn't bother me. If you go with a group of friends get there for about 9ish while it's still pretty empty and you can get a good spot for everyone!One tip I will add is that I wouldn't come here too often so I could enjoy it and not get bored!!",,,

The creepy bar tender loaded up on soda and sour mix and threw in a bit of bottom shelf alcohol. Then to top it off at 12pm the coat check ""opened"" and the bouncer threatens to take all the coats off of a table and throw them outside. They even advertise for their $3 coat check on every TV in the place. Really? I'd suggest going to anywhere else in the city. There are tons of bars that will treat you better. Obviously in the city you'll pay a premium for drinks but at Joshua Tree you are getting ripped off. I'd say the way you are treated by staff and bouncers specifically makes it a complete waste of time. Go somewhere where at least when you over pay, you get something for your money. Chances are at other bars the bouncers won't threaten to throw your coats out onto the streets of Manhattan. Go somewhere else. This place sucks.  If I could rate it 0 stars I would.",3,,

I went there for a Meetup and it was great how they had a slideshow on the screens that usually played music videos or sports events. The music videos that they put on later were great and not only a blast from the past but good songs.

Also, on Sat. nights (not sure if they do this any other night) they play awesome 80s music and show the videos. It's great!

We got there early on a Saturday night and had pleasant service until around 11 pm. That's when all the frat boys and easy girls started to show up...now keep in mind my friends and I are nearing 30...we may have been cool with this scene 5 or 6 years ago, but now it's kinda tired.

The major annoyance of the evening came when we went to close out our tab, the bartender included tip!!! I have never seen this done before!

We took over a booth in the back area and a waitress came over to take our order fairly quickly. We ordered the garlic soy wings with some draft beer (minus 1 point because they don't do pitchers of some of the better beers). The wings were awesome! Not too breaded, not too fatty, not too small. Perfection. As most of you know, the Ravens won. That wasn't the best part. The best part was when they started blasting 80's music and the music videos. Phil Collins, Blondie, MC Hammer.

The last visit I made prior to last night (earlier this year) I was watching what I was eating so I ordered the hand made turkey burger on whole wheat toast and steamed veggies instead of the usual fries. The burger was a very good size, juicy and flavorful. It was full of onions, peppers, carrots and other veggies.Last night I ordered the same thing remembering how good it was. What I got instead shocked me. On the menu it still stated it was ""hand made"". This thing was not even a Jennie-O burger cause I have them at home and know how they look. It must have been a generic brand burger so thin this thing looked flatter than a grilled cheese sandwich! And they wanted $10 for this!!! I s**t you not!! I should've taken a pic of it. When I told the manager this is not what I've have before and not what's stated on the menu she told me it's because of the BREAD I put it on....REALLY??? The bread changes the size and texture of a burger??? I told her no and I did not want it. She politely took it off the check and instead I shared my mom's grilled chicken panini (not really cause it was wrapped in a flatbread instead of the usual bread and pressed) w/ a pesto sauce(it was pesto mayo, not an olive oil based sauce) It was supposed to have mozzarella cheese in it but you'd never know it. It was quite large and tasty though and a good value for $11 w/ the hand cut fries and small side salad.Safe to say I will no longer be visiting this establishment because of their false advertisement and overall declining quality.

Joshua Tree is the CLOSEST thing I've been able to find so far. (If anyone knows of something better pleaaaaase let me know!!!) It's decent...a good place to go to if you know what to expect. Joshua Tree, oh Joshua Tree. I come here with friends when I feel like making the trip from the UES. The music is pretty good, but the dancing is not. There isn't one designated dance area so everyone is always crushed towards the bar (which also makes it difficult to actually order a drink).  I feel like it is a given that I will always leave with at least one random stranger's drink splashed on me.

We were all the way in the back. Getting back to the front door was a mission in itself. The bar in the front was so packed, there was no room for the two-way traffic.

We added  a orange juice each. The eggs benedict was so runny you could still see plenty of clear egg whites. The hollandaise sauce was terrible. It was watery and flavorless. I have been to many diners in my life and ordered eggs benedict dozens of times but this was the worst I ever had. The JT French Toast was nothing more than thick wheat toast with plenty of maple syrup. I could have done a better job. The orange juice was the dagger to this horrid breakfast. Concentrated! Thinking about it now, its understandable that they used concentrated frozen orange juice.

Figuring we can't go wrong for $5.95, we ducked in out of the heat and grabbed a table by the bar. (Outside seating is also available.) A very friendly waitress on her first day of work took our drink orders, helpfully telling us that it was Happy Hour all day long and draft beers were $4.

My cheeseburger with fries was solid pub fare, and my friends also enjoyed their Chicken Parmesan and Grilled Chicken Sandwich. Definitely a bargain at $5.95, but here's where it gets complicated. When the bill arrived, we were charged $28 for four Magner's and $21 for three Sam Adams. At this point the waitress tried to explain that only beers in the first two rows of the beer menu were part of the Happy Hour special. This didn't make any sense based on what we were told when we sat down, but she was a nice girl and rather than ruin her first day on the job and stick her with having to make it good, we grumblingly doled out the cash.

So occasionally my boyfriend and I get coerced into watching a college football game here. College football is terrible. Joshua Tree is even worse. Once, a friend of mine ordered two beers. When the waitress came to ask her if she wanted a third, my friend said, ""I'll just have a water for now."" The waitress said, ""Are you kidding me?"" (Note for future waitresses, which, given the economy and my profoundly useless degrees, is probably me: this is not a good way to get a tip.) Too loud, too crowded, too douchey. Why would you pop a squat at a Burger King if you didn't have to? That's what I thought.",3,8,2
189,Becky R.,"New York, NY",42,136,12,4.0,1/18/2010,"Stopped by around 2am last Saturday, very much enjoying ourselves, rocking out to the 80s music & videos...when I find out EVERY Saturday night is 80s nightWhy did nobody tell me sooner??!??!!!?You know where to find me next weekend.",2,1,1
190,Dexter M.,"Boston, MA",0,73,16,2.0,7/13/2012,The beer specials are a scam! Two dollar drafts but they only come in 10oz. cups which basically means you keep going to the bar and you keep tipping the bartender.,1,,
191,Jenna G.,"Manhattan, NY",38,38,1,2.0,6/18/2012,"Holy Fratman, Robin! If you're looking for a place with weird and sufficiently awkward 80s/90s music and dancing then J-Tree is the perfect Murray Hill Spot.",,3,
192,Trevor P.,"Manhattan, NY",77,152,7,1.0,10/28/2013,"If you're into pushing your way through 21 year-old loud drunk annoying Midwestern transplants to spend lots of money for mediocre drinks while listening to those same 21 year-old loud drunk annoying Midwestern transplants sing 80s karaoke, check this place out on a weekend. It's arguably the best in the city in the aforementioned category.",3,4,
193,Abby S.,"New York, NY",282,227,1,4.0,5/14/2012,"yes, joshua tree is your typical post grad, college-ey hang out. and yes the crowd sucks most of the time bc its all those douche-ey college frat boys running around. but if you want to just be silly one night, drink some beers, and if you can tune out the crowd, this place is actually pretty fun.you can drink and sing to 80's and 90's tunes tot he top of your lungs and no one care!! i think  thats a good time!",1,,
194,Brett M.,"New York, NY",2,17,0,1.0,6/10/2014,Pretty disgusting place with very rude wait staff. When we walked in there was vomit literally on the floor in the middle of the bar. Needless to say we did not stay long.,1,,
195,John K.,"Manhattan, NY",265,355,567,3.0,5/20/2012,"kinda place you go if want to drink and dance in a dark crowded place with lots of other people!just like Mercury Bar and other bars in that Kips Bay(33st-35st and 3rd ave) areameet some people waiting to get a drink at the bar or go up to someone dancing in the backit's dark though, so beware beer goggles ;) lolnot my favorite place, but I think it's a place you should definitely check out if you're in the area and is best to go with friends, and when you're in the mood for that kind of thing..",1,,
196,Eric R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",285,28,9,4.0,1/15/2013,"Went on Tuesday (Trivia night) a fun means of entertainment with friends, winner wins $50 towards food. Waitress was great, we just got bar food, nachos were weak, good selection of beer. high top tables in front near a patio with a bar and tv, then heading towards the back there are booths for larger groups.",,,
197,jeremy s.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,8,0,5.0,12/4/2009,"You know.. I had to think hard about how many stars to give this place.. then I thought of the state of mind i'm usually in when I end up at Joshua Tree.. I can sum that up in one word.Drunk.Wait.. more words.Drunk.. and in the mood to watch Bill Astley dance awkwardly on 20 flat screen TV's to ""never gonna give you up""... I would definitely recommend bringing out of towners here as they always dig it.  Well, my awesome friends anyways.  Pretty easy to get drinks and there are always plenty of young jewish girls if you're into that.. it just makes me feel old!",2,,
198,Leah Lorraine C.,"Valley Stream, NY",10,119,1,2.0,5/29/2012,"I went here only once, on a date, almost two years ago. I just remember the place being full of guys who looked like the belonged on the jersey shore, and the 80's music blaring. it was also expensive, although i did like the food. note to guys out there- a dive bar like this was NOT a great place to take someone on the first date. it reminded me of the bars i went to in college, right down to the crowd inside the bar. it wasn't the fault of the guy i went out with- he got really bad advice from a friend of his, who he called after we left this place and yelled at. i ended up salvaging the night by taking him to one of the bars i like to go to. needless to say, this was the only date i ever went on with this guy. i also wouldn't go back to the Joshua tree either.",,2,
199,Jason D.,"Wayne, NJ",4,138,2,2.0,6/27/2012,I was forced to eat here with a bunch of friends who couldn't make up their mind on where they wanted to go. I got a burger and fries and it was nothing special but I ate the whole thing. This is definitely not a place to have dinner but I would imagine it's a great bar to go to at night.,,1,
