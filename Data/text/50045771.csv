0,Weich Y.,"New York, NY",20,280,6170,5.0,9/22/2018,Beautiful lounge - we've been coming here for 3 years now. The crowd is different depending on the time of the night. I prefer going on the earlier side on a Saturday (before 8pm) and you'll get a seat overlooking Central Park. And when you're done you can go get groceries from Whole Foods downstairs when there are no lines,1,,

2,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,7/9/2018,"Don't know why this place doesn't have too many reviews despite being in such touristy area! It overlooks the Columbus circle and is located In the Columbus plaza on the forth floor. We weren't sure if we would get a place to sit so we called in advance to reserve a table for late night drinks. We were greeted at the gate by the warmest smiling staff. I first got myself a mango Bellini, which was good, (I love everything with mango!) My husband ordered the Librado Luxe. I actually did find it interesting but wasn't sure about the avocado purée in it. But I was so wrong. This drink was absolutely delicious. So much so that I immediately ordered this for my second round. My husband got the mixologist lager. It looks like beer and hence the name, but it's the egg white foam that gives a beer feel. I generally don't like egg white in my drinks but I loved this one! Very well made. We also ordered the hummus, nothing exceptional about it, but good to have munchies with our drinks. I loved the staff especially here. It felt like they paid special attention. It's a great place overall , especially for tourists who would want to sit back and enjoy a drink after their long walk in Central Park.",2,,5

5,Jessica C.,"New York, NY",261,179,591,3.0,5/18/2018,"The drinks were delicious but the vibe here is too swanky for me. The price point of the drinks are closer to $20 than $10 and the wait time for service was long considering it was pretty empty prior to my group arriving. Even though I wouldn't go out of my way to visit here again, I deeply enjoyed both of my drinks and would recommend both to anyone who does visit.",1,,

Updated review","What an incredible night! We came to celebrate my niece's 21st birthday (intimate group) and Martija, Amanda , and Juan made this an incredible night.  The service was impeccable- they were so attentive and made sure her day was special (even bringing out brownies at the end and singing happy birthday). Btw brownies were warm and also semi sweet. Just simply delicioso. As always the fish tacos are excellent and the ambience perfect.  Thank you Christina (corporate) for making this a memorable night.",,,
8,Sallie D.,"Manhattan, NY",197,206,3152,3.0,7/23/2017,"What used to be Stone Rose Lounge back in the day.  Still similar decor as before (maybe slightly less cheesy).Good:- Nice view overlooking Columbus Circle.- No wait / crowd even on the weekend.- Live DJ on weekend (music was ok).- Dim and spacious, lots of privacy.Not so good:- Drinks are very mediocre at hotel bar prices ($20).  The written descriptions on the menu make them sound amazing but doesn't match what you actually get in quality. - Service is a coin flip - one of the waitresses was helpful, but another kept rushing us to pay, came by twice like three minutes apart.  Borderline aggressive, especially when there's isn't anyone waiting..Crowd is typical Columbus Circle - touristy.  Overall, ok for the view but I would think there are better options.",2,,
9,Arily R.,"Manhattan, NY",38,12,19,5.0,5/5/2018,"Had an amazing time celebrating my sister-in-law's Surprise 40th Birthday party here back in Feb. Very classy and they also played great up to date and old hip hop music the best of both worlds!I reserved a spot for 8 ppl and 6 shown up which was fine (More drinks for us!) the space they had reserved for us was fantastic right by the window overlooking Columbus Circle.The package deal I've chosen included 2 prosecco, one Premium Liquor (I had chosen the Coconut Ciroc) it includes the chasers and an assortment of appetizers (shown in pictures) Everything plus gurturity added to be less than $700 if I remember correctly I was pretty drunk by the end of the night hahahahah (shush don't tell anyone!)   I've brought my own cake which they allow you to bring before the party there was a $25 cake fee (they provide the plates and forks and cut it for you as well.) I was confused trying to find the place it turns out to be apart of the Mall hahahaha so take the elevator within the mall.I will celebrate here again!",,,
10,Madhav S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/21/2018,I went to Ascent for the first time on a friend's birthday and I immediately liked the place. Unlike many lounges in the city this one is spacious with an awesome view of Central park and Columbus circle. I went another time with a group of 8 friends on a Saturday and the place was packed with people dancing on the floor with great music by the DJ. The staff was super friendly and courteous. We had an excellent time on the dance floor. We ordered some cocktails and food which were great. Overall I'd say it's one of my favorite lounges in NYC now.,,,
11,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,326,593,4.0,11/28/2017,"A bit of a hidden gem in the Time Warner Center. We came here on a Friday night and were quite impressed by the space, though it seemed a bit empty for that hour.To get in you have to go via the Time Warner Center, and later in the night you might have to go around the back door of the mall to get in. The lounge is on the 4th floor of the mall, and has these nice big windows that give a great view of Columbus Circle below. The space otherwise is large and airy, with high ceilings and is done up in sort of an opulent-yet-classy way.Drinks here are well made and were fairly strong. Prices were on the higher side, but its what you would expect from such a spot in Midtown Manhattan. There was a DJ playing too and a few people dancing but overall it was a bit on the quieter side.Well done up space and a nice place to impress, but I feel the location lets it down a bit. Once the word gets out and the place starts filling up more, I feel it would definitely be one of the better lounges in the area.",2,,
12,Yinglu W.,"New York, NY",1,213,198,5.0,12/23/2017,Perfect atmosphere and great view of Columbus Circle. Drinks are interesting. Ordered cucumber vodka lemonade. Didnt have food thete tho.,1,,
13,Sunita P.,"Manhattan, NY",115,7,11,5.0,8/23/2018,"Go here. Ascent transports you from the bustle of midtowners and tourists into a lavish, sleek, urbane escape. The high ceilings and elegant decor - from the standout bar, to the chandeliers to the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Columbus Circle, make you feel like a million bucks as soon as you walk in. The service is impeccable and the food and drinks are to die for. Come in before your reservations to have a seat at the bar where bartender Mack will greet you with a smile and make delicious libations to write home about.  I think we tried everything on the bar eats menu and we were impressed with the Chef's upgrades to classic bar fare.  I can't wait to return.",,,

18,Tiffany Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",137,200,364,5.0,2/12/2017,"One of the coolest lounges I've been to in NYC! My husband and I came out to NYC for an early Valentine's Day dinner and met up with our friends who were having dinner by Columbus circle. We wanted to find a cool place to chill and I came across Ascent Lounge, thanks to my trusty fellow Yelpers. This place is located on the fourth floor of the shopping center and I have to say, it was not what I thought. It was intimidating seeing men in suits standing at the door...you start questioning whether or not you're dressed for the place and you start wondering how embarrassing it would be to get denied access because you're not dressed to the nines. Thankfully a couple walked in before us in what you would consider 'casual' (jeans and a t shirt) and our worries were out the door. You're immediately greeted by good looking women in all black dresses and sexy heels and my immediate thought, this place is gonna be too elegant and they won't take us without any reservations or some sort. However, these ladies proved me wrong when they offered complimentary coat check and seated us by the window with the awesome view of Columbus Circle. We were greeted within 5 minutes of sitting down which is always an A+ in my books. My friend asked about a drink and the waitress was knowledgeable enough to offer her opinion on what she thought was good. I do have the say that I've been to places that looked fancy AF and the staff has been snotty to the point where if you're not making it rain, don't even bother coming back type of feel. Luckily Ascent Lounge was the complete opposite. A salad bowl of all different types of people were here celebrating birthdays, Valentine's Day, first dates, life, etc, this Lounge really makes you feel welcome and encourages people to come back. The DJ was amazing! Our friends and I felt like 'adults' (even though we're already 30) being in a lounge with good music, good company, no rowdy groups of people who get overly intoxicated and causes a scene, is definitely a place that I look forward to coming back. The decor itself is really cool with big lounge chairs and little cocktail tables in the middle. For larger groups, they offer large couches and tables for you and your friends to have a good time. The bar was hopping with a group of friends celebrating birthdays and dressed in gold and black and the staff danced to the music while remembering to serve their patrons. I Can't say enough too things about this Lounge other that the everlasting impression it's left in my memory on such a random Saturday evening. I HIGHLY recommend this place for people like me, who are at the point in their lives where they want to hang out with friends, have a few drinks, a good laugh, but still be able to 'get loose' responsibly and maturely!",5,1,4

22,Carol L.,"New York, NY",729,392,1367,4.0,8/10/2017,"We were so confused about how to access this lounge (located on floor 4 of the glass window mall), but realized the mall doors were open still at 10 pm at night. We were going to be stationed near the bar since we didn't reserve a table, but just as we were settled in at seats at the bar counter, we were moved to a larger table because the reservation didn't show up. We had a blast, I had a pretty strong watermelon cocktail that was pretty good too. Music was lit with a live DJ, view was AWESOME of Columbus Circle, good company as well. May or may not come back here, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time when I was here and would suggest it as a nice place to grab drinks and enjoy a view.",1,,1

24,Helena K.,"Manhattan, NY",35,101,171,2.0,6/18/2017,"When you first walk in it seems like a beautiful venue and it is, with the view of the park and Columbus Circle and all. However if you really pay attention to the details this place is extremely short of ""classy and trendy"" as others have described. We had a few minutes to kill, on a Friday night at 8:30 waiting for dinner, so ordered one drink each (avg price $15 which is normal). The prosecco (only one on the menu) was nothing special and the gin tonic was ok. For a friday evening it was completely empty...The reason for 2 stars is the trashy tight dress uniform with1.5 inch heels worn by otherwise pretty servers - way too young to be wearing grandma shoes, followed by very cheap and not clean furniture (saw hair on the couch and wet floors) and the overall extremely touristic ambiance. It reminded me of a Sheraton hotel pre renovation in an Asian city back in the 90's. This city is so vibrant and FULL of bars that there really is no reason for you to come to this place to have a drink especially if you are after something classy...",2,1,

Sat down at a table, THE PLACE WAS ABSOLUTELY EMPTY, no one besides us and the waitress told me that if I want to order I have to give her a credit card - I understand that at a bar or if the place is full maybe, but not at an upscale lounge where there isn't anyone besides me and if I wanted to leave I would have to pass by 6-8 people staff.

On Saturday nite it appeared quite empty . So proceeded to the sitting area. I saw there were few seats with reservation sign on it . So I went to  a corner seat which was empty and there was no reservation sign on it . There was this couple sitting on a separate table next to mine . All of the sudden an male attendant came up to me and told me that I can't sit here . I have to ask the hostess first . I told him that I passed by the hostess at the entrance and no one said anything to me . He became loud and he said that it's a rule here. I told him flatly that I am sitting right here , not moving and the whole place is literally empty . So he left and went to talk to the manager . However in just few minutes a female hostess came with menu . I told her that this man was telling me to move .She said who told u that , U can sit here and she took my order . I ordered 2  champagnes in total . I was quite upset at this humiliating treatment therefore I didn't tip and also noted the reason for it on the merchant receipt.And I told my female server about this humiliating incidence . When I was at the front leaving the place , manager  shows up and tells me that he heard about what happened tonite that one is not supposed to sit at those seats in the lounge . I told him first there was no reservation sign on that table and secondly place is empty and that man who told me to leave was very loud and in appropriate . Also that female server told me there was no such rule and that I can sit here and she took my orders too !I explained to him and other attendant with him that I was insulted by this man for nothing . There was no reservation sign on it and the couple was sitting on a adjacent table . They had nothing to do with my seat . He started to argue and then he said ok u can leave ,this place is closed . Then a security person was there and also told me to leave . I told that security that it will not be necessary , ur manager started this discussion of course I am going to leave . Female hostesss was very nice . I told her that I was insulted by this man attendant when i got here and humiliated .I am an educated person and travel all over world and visit high end restaurants but no one treats u like tonite . She understood and I left. So this was my humiliating experience at this lounge . Practically empty on a Saturday nite in the middle of NYC and a manager and attendant not only rude and humiliating but very unprofessional . Will not recommend this place to anyone .

Two weeks after I was double charged me and my husband were in the area and decided to stop by with friends so I can talk to the manager, as couple times I gave them a call I didn't have any luck. I also figured this is luxury place enough where they won't make much issue with fixing this ""misunderstanding"". I spoke to the manager and showed her my card statement where you can clearly see I was double charged the same amount.  She then asked me to write down my info and my card info and she told me she will get back to me. Not sure why she couldn't just check and refund me then on the spot. So after couple days passed and I did not hear from her I gave them a call. After explaining to the hostess what my issue is and being put on a hold I finally got to the manager who promised she'll give me a call back. She did indeed call me back and told me that she sees the double charge and that she will refund it back to my card. After a week passed and nothing was refunded I gave them a call again. This time a male answered the phone, and after explaining my issue once again I was told that the manager will give me a call back. After couple weeks passed and I have not received a call back and still did not received the refund I decided to call them again. I tried couple times, couple days in a row, and no answer. We used to frequent the venue quite often and always spent a generous amount. We often brought work associates and friends. It's disgraceful that establishment like this is treating its customer like we've been treated. Not only did you stole from me, but then you didn't even have decency to correct what you've done. You repeatedly ignored your customers that were wronged. Horrible and incompetent way to manage a place like this.",2,,
49,Sara G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,5.0,1/17/2017,"My absolute favorite place for drinks in NYC! I go here about once a week, and it is amazing everytime. Whether it is a light bite to eat or meeting for business, drinks etc, this is a great spot. Their management changes frequently but they are always super accomodating and have a fun, diverse crowd",1,2,1
50,Lyndsay W.,"Astoria, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/13/2017,"I highly recommend Ascent for a large party. Whether you're planning a corporate party, classy wedding, or non-profit fundraiser, this is a great location. My organization just completed an after party following a concert at the Rose Theater and we've been getting great feedback from our guests. From a planning perspective, the staff, especially our main contact Maria, were extremely professional and helpful. They accommodated our special requests up to the minute before people began to arrive. The food and drinks were passed generously throughout the evening and the layout of the room allowed for lots of mingling and socializing. I can't wait to work with them again!",,,
51,Kristina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,7,0,3.0,3/3/2017,"Tracy and I visited this cocktail bar recently, According to my point of view its not one of the best bars i have ever visited. I feel the cocktails are over priced.",,1,1

53,Mis N.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,13,14,3.0,3/15/2017,The place inside is very nice and the atmosphere also. The drinks are pricey but its what you expect from this type of place. I really like their signature drink. Also the manager was very accomodating in comping a round of drinks for making our group move areas. All in all I would go back.,4,,
54,Tye M.,"Manhattan, NY",107,7,0,5.0,12/2/2016,"Absolutely the best high-end lounge in Midtown, New York City! What I like about Ascent is that it has everything what a luxury lounge is supposed to offer without the pretense and intimidation factor. The interior decor as well as the carefully crafted cocktails and quality of food makes it such an amazing and pleasant experience. The cocktails, made by the beverage manager Matija, was strong and decadent, just how I like my cocktails made. It was completely an experience to remember, and I can't wait to be back!",,1,1
55,Natalie T.,"Henderson, NV",38,59,7,5.0,11/16/2016,"Upscale and Trendy. I hosted my Birthday Party Extravaganza at Ascent Lounge on Saturday 10/29/16. My friends and I booked table service and we had the most amazing time! The food was tasty and definitely exceeded our expectations. Flavors were great and the portions were a decent size. Our waitress was very attentive and kept asking us if we needed anything. We ended up getting an additional pitcher of their margarita which was DELICIOUS! The girls all came out with sparklers and definitely made me feel special. And last but not least, the view was beautiful!  Overall, I highly recommend Ascent lounge for both special occasions or just a round of drinks on a regular evening in NYC.",,1,1
56,Bob S.,"New York, NY",8,18,0,1.0,8/13/2016,"This place is all over the place, and has been on an obvious downward slide. First it was Stonerose, then Parkview, and now Ascent - all in under a year, I believe. Stonerose was a legit lounge and one of my favorite spots in the city. They had a great mix of drinks in a beautiful, chill setting. The atmosphere and music attracted a sophisticated but fun mix of young adults. You get could a classic cocktail like a Manhattan, or something fun like a jalapeno margarita. Then, it became Parkview. To quote myself from my review of Parkview, ""now you get gaudy, basic cocktails with fruit juice in EVERY option - drinks like the 'sassy peach margarita' or a manhattan/moscow mule hybrid (which for some absurd reason has strawberry juice in it, when neither the manhattan nor moscow mule contains ANY juice)."" In my review of Parkview I also discussed how they removed the shuffleboard table and seemed to have switched to a mostly older, touristy crowd (leading to a much emptier space, even on Friday and Saturday nights). This new place is almost identical to Parkview, but little details like the name change and the inclusion of bottle service make it clear it's becoming a straight up overpriced club. It's kind of sad to me that the owners decided to gut what was a true gem in the city to give us Yet Another Club™ with 450 dollar bottles of grey goose.",1,,1
57,Dan G.,"Livingston, NJ",49,8,0,4.0,5/4/2017,Great place for drinks and dancing.  No dance floor but play lively music and people just dance wherever they're at.  Great view of Columbus circle!,,,
58,Monica Z.,"Queens, NY",256,27,9,5.0,8/8/2016,"It was my first time there, I went on the weekend and was surprised to see how empty it was around 1 A.M. I'll definitely come back another night to see if it's livelier, but our cocktail waitress was pleasant and gave us great service.",,1,
59,T W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,10/14/2017,"This review is in reference to our wedding at Ascent Lounge. We live in the neighborhood and always enjoyed coming to the space for drinks. We were looking for the perfect spot for a cocktail style wedding, but our major concern was having a substantial amount of food and seating for guests, while still having a cocktail style the entire night. Unlike other managers, vendors, etc., Brian contacted me back minutes after my inquiry. We set up a call, he asked me to explain our vision, and his enthusiasm was the gut feeling we had been waiting for. Brian and his team met with us as many times as we wanted to go over the menu, timeline, and layout. They were always responsive and it was so clear that their goal was to make our wedding day PERFECT. We cannot say enough about how amazing the night was. The absolute best food, service, atmosphere, and bar. Our guests could not get over the beauty of the venue and the ""insane"" bar. We had about 200 guests and had plenty of seating options and more than enough food passed and at stations. No one had to wait for a drink. No one had to awkwardly hold empty glasses or used cocktail plates. At every point in the planning process Brian was available for a phone call or through email. We can't imagine any other venue to create our ideal cocktail style wedding. Our guests were overly excited about the fact that they could get top shelf drinks and food, and choose to sit, dance, eat, and hang out with whoever they wanted at any time. They are still talking to us about the bar, four months later. We had a one hour acoustic set as guests arrived and then a DJ. We incorporated into our timeline the traditions that meant the most to us, such as entrances, speeches and first dances. We also had a photo booth, which did not compromise room at all. The space is amazing and can accommodate more than you can imagine. Brian and his team delivered an absurd amount of food and a bottle of champagne to our hotel room for after the wedding. We still keep in touch with Brian and will forever be grateful to him and the City Nights Hospitality team for the most perfect event. We contacted many, many venues and vendors during our planning process and there are none that come close to the attention, care, QUALITY, and response time that Brian and his team provide. They are Top Shelf in every aspect.",,,

Love the DJ, music, bartender Fidel and owner Brian made for a fun night of dancing and incredible cocktails.
