It can be a really cute date spot too or gathering. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great. The cocktails were okay, I wasn't too crazy about the sangria but great selection of wine. Things I ordered: - Cheeseburger Spring Rolls with ketchup-mustard sauce (MUST GET)- Mac Lobsta: tender chunks of fresh lobster, cognac, tarragon & mascarpone - Acquerello Risotto & Asparagus with fava beans, shiitake mushrooms, italian summer truffles- Long Island Duck Breast with caramelized cauliflower puree, roasted asparagus, ricotta salata- Pan Roasted Chicken with haricots verts, mashed fingerlings, chicken jus",6,1,10

2,Leila L.,"New York, NY",32,222,377,5.0,10/23/2018,"I like this place! Didn't hold much of an expectation given the 3.5-star rating on Yelp. I'm so glad I tried it out at the suggestion of a friend. The food was certainly impressive--delicious and stylish. I mean it's not wow-wow delicious, but definitely delicious enough for me to want to go back for more.Apps: The Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad & The Beet Tartare: Both were fun. The brussel sprout salad was definitely more carefully designed than the beet tartare. It has a nice, crunchy texture, and not too creamy. The beet tartare was just beets with avocado and smashed avocado...Nothing was special about the flavor either. I don't recommend it.The Duck Breast: I ordered a medium. It came out more cooked than I expected (see the pic), but still, it's delish. The duck meat was cut thick, which I liked, and it's quite a lot in portion. The highlight is definitely the golden sauce! ""Caramelized cauliflower puree and ricotta salata"" according to their description--so flavorful, so creamy, so so so good! So delicious and went well with the duck meat! The sauce makes the mini carrots buried underneath also super delish. The Cheesecake: Not your normal, commonsense cheesecake. The presentation is really cute It's colorful. It has a crunchy base. Has some berries on the top. The caramelized banana on the side is also delish. A creative dessert!Funny fact: you actually get a WHOLE cauliflower, in its entirety, when you order Roasted Cauliflower. Check out my pic--that's what my friend got.",,,1

Updated review","Still buzzy at Friday lunch this comfort den/ denizen still packs 'em in. While they're known for their less than healthy options there were some surprises.Ate:Lobster bisque Salmon entree with saladRiojaWhile the lobster bisque was spot on with a nice Rioja , my $28 salmon was overpriced with nary a vegetable and when I asked for a piece of bread with said $28 lunch entree I was told an order of bread is $1- criminal. That kind of service and value does not make my $28 lunch entree, palatable and is not hospitality, period.",2,1,3
4,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,5.0,9/2/2018,"I've been here twice for dinner and tried brunch for the first time today. Gotta say that I liked Delicatessen for both! During dinner, the restaurant is dim but lively. The mirrors on the walls are interesting (albeit sometimes distracting), and the bathrooms are cool too. Brunch was lovely in that you have the option to sit outside or inside (which is flooded with natural light). Our server was wonderfully attentive and charming--he asked if we had allergies (which is a question I've rarely gotten at restaurants). I went with the pancakes, which were very filling; the berry preserves and cinnamon cream were delicious. The dish was definitely on the sweeter side (stealing my friend's potatoes helped balance that out).",,,
5,Tiffany M.,"Queens, NY",240,229,469,4.0,7/25/2018,"Came to Delicatessan late on a Friday night for dinner. My cousin has been ranting and raving about their Caesar salad to go and find out that there's a new chef that changed the menu. The server said things were slightly different but we could still order some old items if we would like to. Caesar salads were not on the menu but we were able to order them anyway, hoping it would be the same. I ordered the salmon caesar and my cousin had the shrimp caesar both accompanied by mimosas. The mimosas were excellent! The salmon salad was good. I did enjoy it however, the caesar dressing left an after taste of straight mayonnaise in my mouth. I didn't like that. We also ordered the cheeseburger spring rolls for an appetizer and they were really good! Very cute idea for a cheeseburger. The restaurant is beautiful! Very sexy, modern, and dimly lit at night. I was thinking of a whole different setting because of the name. This place is perfect for a date. There's more seating downstairs and also a private room for parties. The service was excellent! Ashley was our server and even though we came basically as the kitchen and restaurant was closing, she did not rush us at all. She did let us know as soon as we sat down that the kitchen was closing but she did it politely and pleasantly. We enjoyed our entire experience just as if it were 6pm and it was greatly appreciated. I will definitely return to try other food items.",1,,1

I got a glass of champagne which they serve chilled and my friend ordered a passion fruit cocktail drink which the waiter recommended and she very much enjoyed. I got the burger and my friend ordered truffle fries and bruschetta with fresh mozz. My burger was very good it had a juicy tomato, fresh onions and the pickles on the side. The pickles are absolutely delicious. I love the sour and sweet and seasoned balance of a pickle. The meat was cooked medium well which idk if that's how you say it but the result is it's very juicy. My friends truffle fries were delicious because they were warm. The only reason why I gave a 4/5 stars is because the fries that came with my burger were cold. Cold fries are just not that appetizing but had they been warm I'm sure they would've tasted great. Our waiter was friendly.",3,1,4

We ordered the Texas Benedict, Eggs Benedict and Berries Belgium Waffles. Overall food was good 4/5, service was ok 3/5 but price for amount of food was 3/5. Too pricey for quality and portion. Texas Benedict $24: bbq pulled pork, poached eggs and hollandaise on brioche French toast. Pulled pork and poached eggs were great but the French brioche was soggy. After a few bites, everything tasted mushy. But two large slices and very filling. 4/5 Eggs Benedict $20 : English muffin, poached eggs, Canadian bacon and hollandaise with home fries. The dish was well received 4/5. Berries Belgium Waffles: very light and delicious with berries and whipped cinnamon cream. Yummy but portions too small for $16. 4/5",3,2,1

Updated review","One thing about Soho I love is the Shopping, one thing I don't love about Soho is the lack of restaurant options. So, imagine my happiness when I stumbled upon Delicatessen on a 90 degree Friday after shopping. The Hostess greeted upon arrival, I asked for the menu & loved it. I, then, was escorted to an outdoor table (although it probably wouldn't have made a difference if it was indoor because of the way the restaurant is designed). Our server was amazing, I ordered the Steak Salad which was delicious & the wine was so good. I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again especially on a Soho Shopping Day.* Visited Delicatessen a second time during the Winter where we were sat right by the door & FREEZING! We were given a cold shoulder when asked politely if we can move. They sat us at the table directly next to it where it was a pinch warmer. After a long day of shopping in the cold, I just wanted Steak and Wine! The rest of the time there was pleasant and the food was as delicious as I remembered. The only thing is that we had about 3 different servers who wasn't paying to our order so we had to correct them a few times.",,,
17,Anne V.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",6,5,1,5.0,10/18/2018,"Been here twice now and am definitely coming back. Love this place! The staff is fantastic, they really seem to enjoy their job and that's great. There's so many places in which the staff looks like they forgot how to smile and be decent ages ago, this is refreshing. On top of that, I love the food. The pricing is very decent and it all tastes amazing. As soon as you get in they tell you their day specials, which are great. I'd come back for the Tilly cocktail alone haha.When people ask me for nice places in Soho, this is my #1 recommendation!",,,
18,Tyler H.,"New Haven, CT",1,7,1,4.0,6/7/2018,"Delicatessen -- your typical New York restaurant. The prices are bordering absurd, the atmosphere attempts to be modern and edgy yet the commercialism permeates the restaurant. It's almost sterile, like New York City itself -- flashy and grandeur yet empty and lonely. But let's face it, you don't visit Delicatessen for the environment, you visit it for the name, for the look, for the experience. A restaurant that appeared in Gossip Girl, a quintessential once-hip-location-turned-gentrified-restaurant, a place to post on Instagram for the look. The food was pleasant. I enjoyed the salmon and spinach eggs Benedict, but my smoked salmon was slightly over smoked, and the plump pink transitioned to an unsavory white. However, the portions were substantial and the food tasted pleasant. I was also greatly satisfied with the truffle spinach and artichoke dip -- hey, I love my spinach. Would I go back? Yes. Did I upload a picture to my Insta story? Absolutely. Did I want others to know I ate here? Of course.",1,3,
19,Christine H.,"Atlanta, GA",73,8,5,3.0,10/3/2018,"We popped in here for a quick lunch before shopping. The open air, inviting atmosphere grabbed us immediately. The service was good and the food was amazing. My husband & I shared the Truffle Burger, which was wonderful and plenty to share. My son ordered the stuffed French toast, which he said he would highly recommend. It was defiantly not healthy. I would highly suggest the cheeseburger spring rolls (at least I think that was the name). I'd never heard of this and man was it good! This is in a great location for shopping, easy in and easy out. Very clean.",,,
20,James W.,"New York, NY",165,276,401,1.0,11/4/2017,"This place is God awful. I would never recommend this place to anyone. My friend and I came here Friday, November 3rd at around 8pm and was seated outside. We originally put our names down to eat at Rubirosa, but the wait was too long. I had always passed by this place thinking how cute it was.Our waitress took our drink orders. My friend and I decided to each order our own cocktails instead of sharing a bottle of wine. Big mistake. I ordered the Concord Grape Caipirinha with much hesitation as I'm partial to the original crushed lime, but the waitress insisted that it'd be delicious. It was not at all. I had to send it back because it tasted like straight Concord grape juice cocktail for $15. My friend's cocktail was watered down and pretty much just nursed it to death the entire meal. Then, came our entrees. I ordered the steak frites with truffle fries and my friend ordered the diver scallops with a side of truffle fries. The truffle fries were fine. My steak- ordered medium rare- was tough as a nut. The whole table shook whenever I tried to cut through it. My water glass was never refilled during the 1.5 hour dinner. Waitress was nowhere to be found. After not seeing our waitress for a while, my friend and I stood up to which she ran over abruptly to ask if we wanted dessert. And I politely declined and asked for the check. The service at this dinner was atrocious. In addition, the side salad that came with the steak frites was unbearably salty. I'll just wait the 2 hours at Rubirosa next time.",2,1,

23,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,4.0,9/30/2017,"I was apprehensive and nervous about trying place out. Why so? Apprehensive because the food looks great, but nervous because on a previous visit to their sister restaurant, Cafeteria, I had an awful experience with the food and service. I spoke with someone on the phone here prior to my arrival-- she put me on hold three times and took her awhile to finally answer my question, it made my nervousness increase even more, but once I arrived, that all went away.I arrived almost 45 minutes prior to my reservation. However, it wasn't crowded and was seated. I initially sat outside, but my daughter was cold and wanted to move inside. The staff was very accommodating with this request since we already had our drinks on the table.Onto the food: Cheeseburger Spring Rolls (11 out of 10) they were great, I was hooked with just the first bite. Truffle Fries (7 1/2) it was ok, they give you a lot of fries. Buttermilk Pancakes (9 out of 10) fluffy and flavorful. Lastly, scrambled eggs (8 out of 10) I only sampled it, typical eggs.The ambiance of the restaurant was sorta like being in a nightclub, but the music was tasteful, and not very loud. There were some loud patrons across from me, but that's no fault of the restaurant. Nice decor and that included the bathroom. Overall, nice staff from the hostess, to my server, who constantly checked on the table, made sure we enjoyed the food, refilled water several times over. Also, they had a nice manager who I spoke with in regards to an Open Table issue. I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience here. I'll certainly be back!",3,1,3
24,Janelle B.,"New York, NY",344,87,409,3.0,11/19/2017,"This is probably a safe location for me (that's why I am giving it three stars), I usually order the salmon platter.

If you've been around NYC lately, you know how humid and hot it is, even in the evening. Despite the A/C being on, the humidity in the restaurant was unbearable. Our ice waters were melting faster than we could chug them. Multiple diners were complaining and not going to lie, the only relief from the heat was to go downstairs to the bathroom.It's a shame because the cocktails and food were quite good. But you can only enjoy your hot burger or steak so much when you feel like you're sitting in a sauna (despite being quite ravenous). The waitress and service was great, but please please please CLOSE your street windows/doors when it's a hot, sticky day in NYC. Not only are you wasting electricity, but no one will enjoy the ""ambiance"" when all they can think about is the sweat on their foreheads. If people want to eat outside, they can eat outside.

Updated review","I was greeted promptly and brought to my table as soon as I arrived by a sweet and friendly hostess. My server came over right after, offered me a beverage and helped me make appetizer and entree decisions. He told me that his favorite appetizer was the burrata and based on his recommendation, I decided to order it myself. He was so spot on, this dish was incredible. All the components; the creamy luscious cheese, the pistachio butter, the blistered tomatoes, the balsamic reduction and the perfect polenta really created an extraordinary appetizer where every bite was amazing. It was beautifully plated and all the colors made the dish visually stunning. I could have ordered another instead of a different main.",,,

30,Kristin M.,"Queens, NY",319,28,52,3.0,2/26/2018,"I've been to the Delicatessen before and really liked it, but I went again on Saturday and was pretty disappointed. Although the service was friendly, and attentive, the food was really lacking, especially for the price point. My friend and I both ordered the pomegranate margarita, and thery forgot the salt on the rim. For $15 a cocktail, touches like this matter. For my entree, I ordered Nicoise, which was extremely underwhelming. For $26 I got a pretty basic salad, some fingerling potatoes, and yellow fin tuna that was not only cold, but hard, like it had been prepared hours earlier and had been sitting out for awhile. The salad was good, but the tuna was completely bland. I expected a lot more, especially after the rave review the waiter gave the dish. For dessert we got the chocolate chip cookie & nutella dome. It was delicious, but very small, definitely suited more for one person. Overall, it really wasn't worth the price. Although a trendy spot, it seems to be relying on it's reputation over the substance of it's food. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.",1,,1
31,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72,5.0,7/25/2017,"You ain't going to beat this location! Steps from both Soho and Little Italy, this spacious restaurant has an extensive menu with EXCELLENT outdoor seating, especially if you are into people watching. I had been here years ago although came more recently for lunch. With only a short wait, we got seating right on the sidewalk on a beautiful summer day. With that being said, even if the weather isn't cooperating, there are plenty of great seats inside the restaurant as well.In any event, we got the avocado toast and truffle fries. 5 out of 5. Everything else on the menu looked delicious as well, including the drinks. While the prices are perhaps slightly above average, they aren't crazy and you're paying for the location with quality food. Definitely recommend.",2,,1
32,Sharon L.,"New York, NY",191,105,162,5.0,8/6/2017,"This soho gem offers some of the best Mac and Cheese and truffle fries in the city. I have come here for dinner a handful of times, thus had the opportunity to taste different Mac and Cheese flavors each time. My favorite is the Mayan chipotle, which offers a creamy/cheesy baked texture, homemade style dish, accompanied by a nice kick. The interior of the place is fancier than its name lets on. It is a dual level restaurant with a lounge atmosphere downstairs and cool lighting. Tables are plentiful, including outdoor seating in nicer weather. However, I've made a reservation each time and would recommend doing so during peak hours. All in all, Delicatessen is a trendy comfort food establishment with reasonable prices in a beautiful area of Manhattan. One of these days I'll come back and explore the brunch menu here as well.",1,,1
33,Emily V.,"New York, NY",211,88,29,5.0,5/24/2018,"I have never had a bad experience here. I've always come for dinner, but with my parents in town I decided to take them for Brunch on a rainy day. They said the wait for 3 people would be 20 mins, so they take your number so you can walk around until they text you to be seated. It literally was only 5 min later before we got a text to come back. Everyone was extremely happy with their meal, but I was especially pleased with the ""Award winning Pan fried Chix Sandwich""(and personally think I got the best one). It was just the perfect mix of ingredients and flavor and omggg I can't wait to go back and order it again! Highly recommend",,,

36,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,3.0,12/5/2017,"Overall, a big disappointment with the food, my whole family was sad after the meal. My mom had the signature burger ($25) and said that McDonald's have better burgers. My sister had the buttermilk fried chicken ($24) and said KFC has better chicken.. and that the house-made ranch was not good at all. However, my brother did like his beef & broccoli ($29), which he said had a good sauce. However, this was a beautiful restaurant- dimly light, lovely seating, and holiday decor. Service was fine, but maybe it's because they charge 20% if you have a party of 5 or more. They had a dinner pre fixe, which was $58. It was much cheaper to get the dishes separately unless you get the priciest combination which only totaled up to $60. *DO NOT GET THE PRE FIXE**You can also get 30% cash back from Groupon* :) Tuna Tartare ($17)- 3.5/5 This tasted bland, but if you add salt it makes it SO much better. The tuna tasted really fresh though. Overall a nice and light dish. Lobster Lettuce Cups ($15)- 4/5 Pretty good, a bit messy, but you only get 2 pieces, which is quite overpriced, so we ended up having 3 orders of them for 6 people. Flash Fried Tuna Avocado Rolls ($14)- 3/5 This was 6 pieces of 1 inch rolls. Not really memorable because it was a bit bland, not even the sauce helped. Thai Lobster Bisque ($11)- 3/5 This soup was thick and creamy and had a bit of a kick to it. Not really worth getting.Horseradish Crusted Norwegian Salmon ($29)- 2.5/5 This was a huge disappointment. Red beet puree with salmon, nope. You can't even taste the smoked creme fraiche. Marinated kohlarabi? Eh. Overall a very odd flavor for salmon. I like the creativity but it was executed very poorly, at least it looked pretty. My dad had the same dish and said he makes it better, which is unfortunately true. House Made Pasta del Giorno on Tuesdays ($22)- 3/5 This dish was small and only had 3 pieces of pasta and is more like an appetizer. The texture had some crunch and also softness to it. I buy premade pasta that's better than this though and for way less money. Truffle-Parmigiano Fries ($10)- 4/5 $10 for fries? Holy, they weren't THAT good but okay there was a decent amount of it. And they give you ketchup and this mayo sauce. Fried Apple Tart ($11)- 3/5 This was alright, not too sweet and pretty looking. Tasted fine with the dulce de leche ice cream. Chocolate Hazelnut Tartufo ($11)- 1/5 This is basically like a big ferrero rocher chocolate and literally had like no taste to it. The chocolate seemed to be sugarfree and lacked a lot of flavor, including the sauce. I didn't like the amaretto ice cream, tasted funky. Selection of House Made Ice Cream & Sorbet ($10)- 3/5 You get to have a choice of 3 and you can mix and match the ice cream & sorbet, which was nice.

The Cognac paired perfectly with the tarragon and  mascarpone cheese. I could taste every tender chunk of fresh lobster with each bite I took. For my main course I had the linguini & clams . Although this dish wasn't for me, the white wine sauce was smooth and creamy without being too thick. The clams were spiced perfectly and boasted a parsley roasted garlic flavor that were to die for. Delicatessen sports indie-RnB vibes while remaining eclectic. The music won't drown out your guests' conversations. This makes this location perfect for the young or seasoned professional. Grab a drink or bite to eat with friends  or co-workers as this place won't disappoint. Tip: Try the Ciderboys Strawberry Magic cider or if you're into IPAs try the Southern Tier Double IPA.",,,
38,Marisa A.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",211,122,328,2.0,12/6/2017,"Minimalist decor, maximalist food - the sauces are lacking in distinctive flavor but layered on like a canvas on which a kid handed finger paints for the first time has been unleashed. The kale salad has great texture, massaged but still with a crunch. It is heavily drenched in an insipid dressing which ruins the entire dish. The chicken wings are themselves fine but covered in a cloying dressing that has less depth or nuance to the flavor than a dipping sauce at Arby's. The meatballs are very good, suspended in a  competently made tomato sauce that has just a hint of sweetness - for how florid all the other gravies has been this comes as a pleasant shock! The ambiance is chill and the servers are very good. For a hip bar the food is palatable, enough drinks in you might even appreciate the overdone flavors and puddles of dressing. If you are going for the food though, either keep walking or ... ask for dressing on the side?!",1,1,

We made a reservation, but even without it, there was plenty of seating available. The first thing I noticed was how classy and beautiful the decor and ambiance was. It's definitely a great place for a date.My friend and I decided to split the Cheeseburger Spring Rolls ($13). There are 3 per order along with 3 mini pickles and ketchup-mustard dip. The spring rolls were delicious and pretty big! They're exactly what I expected from the sound of this appetizer. It's a genius idea giving you a feel of a burger without the actual burger.I went with the Steak Frites ($35), cooked medium and had my fries truffle-style. The truffle fries were great and is definitely the way to go with this dish. The steak was cooked well but some parts were way too chewy. Accompanying the steak was a watercress salad. I'm not a huge fan but I ate it all as it's the only vegetable in the whole dish.The whole meal was a bit pricier than I'd normally pay for dinner (~$50) but it's a good dinner spot to come to every once in a while!",,,

Served with some type of concoction with dijon, the outside of the spring roll was sprinkled with salt. I think this made it a bit too salty and could've been balanced the sauce much better without it. I would order this again.Tuna Tartare $17Served with a really good sauce, it comes with taro chips.

However, they were also $15 and served in a small white wine glass with a ton of ice, so there was barely any liquid. It was kind of ridiculous. The burrata salad with eggplant was out of this world amazing. My mom ordered the truffle corn which we were going to share, but it comes on the cob, so I'd recommend asking if they can cut it for you. Our main entrees took over an HOUR, and the restaurant was not even crowded. I ordered the Farro salad and added steak on top, and it was COLDDDDD by the time it came, and so was my mother's turkey burger (and my father luckily ordered the Nicoise salad, which is meant to be cold).  My mom had to send back the french fries because they were too grossly cold to eat. Service: Our waitress really didn't know much about the menu and kept forgetting things so maybe she's the reason our food was left sitting there for so long. Although, other reviewers complain about the wait time here as well.

I've had the lobster mac, which is filled with huge lumps of lobster and creamy cheese and my favorite - Mayan Chipotle with chicken ( a bit on the spicy side). I've also had the turkey burger and fries. The burger was a tad drier than I would have preferred but not bad at all. And I just couldn't stop eating the fries, one after the other, until they were gone. The servers and bar tenders are nice. The place isn't that big, but it's not too tight either. I've also seen where they have the downstairs area rented out (or reserved) for parties/gatherings. Oh, and it's not too pricey, but it's not cheap either.",,1,1

They don't take reservations, but we were seated immediately I think because we were somewhat early. The place is light and sleek. Mixture of young people and families. They have an intense cocktail list for brunch, and my friends ""spiked"" mimosa was way too strong...tasted they poured a ton of vodka in it along with all the champagne and was not very good :/ However the food on the other hand is perfect comfort food hangover brunch. Crave-worthy and fattening. We each ordered a Mac and cheese for our entree - I got the quack Mac and she got the margarita. We also shared a side of the truffle French fries. Technically the Mac and cheeses are side dishes and are somewhat small, but we were still very full and satisfied because we got the fries too. The fries had a huge portion and were so amazing. I've had my fair share of truffle fries but paired with the aioli dipping sauce, I couldn't ask for more. Waitress is kind and quick. Only complaint is the food is somewhat pricey for the portion/""basic""-ness. $15 for a side of Mac and $11 for the side of fries. I also got an iced coffee for $5, but at least they had soy milk and a free refill!",,,

So what was suppose to be $29 set meal per person turned out to be $55 each. When we advised her of the mistake,  not only did she not apologize for the mix up but instead defensively refuted that we never told her we were ordering from the prix fix menu.  Hello....? She clearly asked us which appetizer we wanted with the entree... I don't know what customer service course she took but common sense should have checked in. I totally understand that a waitress can make a mistake with the check but then to rudely say we didn't tell her is mind blowing!  Meanwhile, while she needs to explain to her manager the mistake she made, our take out dessert is melting.  Did anyone offer us a fresh desert? NO! I was really looking forward to like this place, but it turned out to be an absolute disappointment!  Although the manager did apologize, it was a little too late by then. Because of the inexperienced and rude waitress, our lunch experience was already ruined!",2,2,

The ambiance, decor and food definitely deserve 4 stars but the service brings it down one notch. But we had an overzealous waitress who rubbed us the wrong way which definitely dampened the mood a bit.I'll start of with the cocktails because I believe in a well crafted cocktail. I started off with the ""She smokes when she drinks"". It was a hit with another person; I wasn't too impressed with it and I'm a fan of ginger beer but it could've been the mezcal. We ordered a bunch of truffle fries for the table which was pretty good. For entree, I ordered the steak frites. It came with a salad and the fries came on the side and it was pretty good. I was really jealous at my friend who ordered the special which was the clam bake because it was HUGE. I made the mistake of not getting dessert because the descriptions were pretty lackluster to me. I tried some of my friends ""Molten Matcha Green Tea Cake"". IT WAS THE BEST THING I HAD ALL NIGHT. I enjoyed my food but this was definitely well made.Now I'm going to back up a bit to the part where we received our entrees so that I can talk about the quality of service we received. The servers came out and gave everyone their dished and we began to dig in. Waitress comes over and literally scolded my friend sitting next to me that it wasn't his entree and that it was for someone else on the table. He stated that that's the dish he ordered and wanted. Now....INSTEAD of letting him have the already consumed dish. She took the dish away from him so now 2 people are waiting on their orders. I felt so bad because you can tell he was really embarrassed and pissed that this woman scolded him in front of this dinner party. I didn't understand why she just didn't let him have the dish.Now would I go back? Yes but it would be circumstantial. I wouldn't come here to host any event of mine and definitely not groups. It would probably be for a date or 2 other people tops. The food was good but it wasn't amazing. This is NYC, there are a million and one restaurants that have great food as well as great service.With that being said, I would like to give it another try because it could've just been that particular waitress and not reflective of the establishment as a whole.....plus that molten matcha green tea cake was soooo good and matcha anything is my kryptonite so there's that.",,,

My friend and I shared the meatballs, fried tuna roll, and lobster mac n cheese. Everything was very good. The meatballs were my personal favorite and took me by surprise, they're so good! And the burrata in the amazing sauce? Excellent! You can never go wrong with lobster mac, and my friend's personal favorite was the tuna roll, she loved how fresh it was.For dessert we got the chocolate lava cake which was very good because you can never go wrong with oozing chocolate, but the real star of that dish was the Oktoberfest ice cream it came with.

The drinks were good too. SERVICE: The waitress came and said she would not be our server- but what can she get us? She was polite- but we felt that she was disinterested since she already said she would not be our server. Then it took about 15 minutes later for her to someone else come back and take order. By that time he said the menu had switched to dinner- so he handed us new menus. That was annoying- but the manager came over - and said he was see if my friend's brunch meal could still be honored-- I was ordering a dinner entree.

It was clear that he was overstressed due to the constant demands from every table. Out of the whole restaurant there were only two waiters. It took forever to even call someone over to refill our glass of water. We clearly were not done with our food but the bus boy kept on asking to take our plates.Food:I was pushed away by the idea of cheeseburger spring rolls but my friend insisted that we get them because they sounded interesting. HE MADE A GREAT CHOICE. They're so yummy. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I ordered the lobster roll. ($26) It was good, but nothing to gloat about. It came with wasabi potato chips and a salad. My friend ordered the oinking chicken sandwich($18) and upgraded his fries to truffle fries(+$3). Let me tell you, the truffle fries came with A LOT of fries. We couldn't finish it. For two people with large appetites, take our advice and just upgrade it from the dishes that come with it instead of buying a bucket for $10.

Instead, I was brought a bagel that was definitely a Thomas' frozen bagel, a limp piece of lettuce, and a tomato that was both soggy and somehow not ripe at once.

Their bathrooms are downstairs and that became an issue when a group was having a private party in the area right outside the bathroom. I had to wait till the lady finished taking pictures with her cake before I could go into the bathroom.Food: We had the burger egg-rolls and omg, super yummy.  We had the the duck and Chipotle mac and cheese and both quite yummy but the duck tasted much better.  I also had their sea bass dinner special and it was huge and tasty. The boyfriend got the scallops and they tasted pretty good. I have also tasted their green beans and had no complaints.Service: During the first time both the hostess and waiter were nice.  During our second time, the hostess  was  extra nice because one person from our party was running late.  We had a drink at the bar and the bartender was nice and efficient. Once we were seated, everything went downhill. Our waitress took 15 minutes to bring drinks back.  We had to call her a few times just to put in our order. She served people who were seated after us before us. Every time we ordered another round of drinks it took even longer to arrive. The food took about 45 minutes to come and we got worried because we had reservations for a comedy club.  She then gave us the bill while we were still eating.  The rest of the group had been there many other times and they said they had never experienced such bad service, so not sure if this was an isolated incident.I would like to return again but after this last event I am hesitant.",1,,

I had the chicken sandwich, the bread was soggy from the sauce- or maybe because I'm a slow eater. The place is always packed- slightly noisy and had to be at the bar for lunch at 2:30 on Friday afternoon. Their churros are okay. I would come back if I don't know where I want to go for food or have no idea what I want to eat. The truffle smell will definitely make you hungry.",,,
84,Martin V.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,30,20,1.0,8/26/2017,"Just had dinner here and was very disappointed. I probably would've given 0 stars. The waitress scolded me in front of the other guest,embarrassing me really, for their mess up of giving me someone else food and takes it away. Turns out it was same meal that I wanted/ordered. Not interested and turned off from this restaurant. Details below. This was meant to be a group dinner. A majority of my group was there on time but not all (waiting on 1person). We got seated after persuading the hostess (I was given major attitude about that request). We were able to put appetizers in. Our last person still didn't make it yet, but our waitress put some entree orders in then last person shows up.Once everything started moving along, we had apps and drinks, then the entrees started to come out. I got my entree, apparently this wasn't entered into the system by waitress, and as I take my second bite of chicken and mashed potatoes the waitress proceeds to scold me and takes the food away sayings it's not for me it's for someone else. As the customer, I shouldn't have my food taken away. If I ordered the meal and it's for someone else then let me have it and have a second meal cooked and provided to the other person. Turns out the other person who ordered it was my cousin at my table; so they took the meal form me, back to the kitchen, then brings out the same dish to my cousin. I had to wait another 10 minutes for my food and by that point it was salty and I was turned off by the establishment.It was very EMBARRASSING. I felt as though I did something wrong and was done in front of my group of friends. Never coming back again. Confusing and the situation was handled incorrectly.",4,,
85,Nicole K.,"Astoria, NY",136,1,0,3.0,6/30/2018,"Ok so the food was pretty good the Mac and Cheese was decent sized but very filling. It took a long time to come out and the waiter was ok in terms of customer service. The real reason i am angry is that when he first came over to our table, he asked us if we wanted water, and we said tap. we got a bottle of water, which was weird cuz we said tap, but we assumed it was all the same. He brought us one after we finished the first one, and we didn't even ask for it. We finish, and we get the check, and we see a 16$ charge for water. They should tell u that they don't have tap and that we would get charged. It was just annoying.",,,

Asked the waitress why I didn't receive white wine sauce as it would normally be served, they gave me some crazy run around on that's how it's typically made. Def didn't reach my expectations.

My friend and I had asked to sit on the patio for some drinks and a small bite but she told us absolutely not because they were saved for reservations and we had to sit for FULL DINING meaning appetizers, entrees, etc. she proceeded to say.. the whole restaurant was almost empty & I have never been somewhere where I was basically being FORCED to order a certain amount of food... if I were at an upscale restaurant, sure or If she were a bit nicer & not so condescending it would've been fine.

Now they come about 4 in a plate(which I don't think is enough) but I get it! Reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because at times the staff can tend to forget about you and you end up waiting a long time for either a refill or the check.

To be honest, I planned to to have brunch some place down the block but there were no availability so I was aimlessly walking around and came across Delicatessen. Took one look at the menu and I was sucked in. There was no wait for a walk in on a busy Sunday afternoon, talk about good timing. They serve all day breakfast items, just go straight for those buttermilk pancakes. Adding french chocolate and fresh bananas should not even be an option, one of the best pancakes I have ever had.  The other breakfast items sounds delish too but I only have one stomach. The tuna tartare was different, I was expecting a somewhat french style tartare but it had a lot of asian flare to it. It tastes like fish drenched in soy sauce. I mean, yeah very flavorful but just not the flavor I was looking for in a tartare. I would much prefer to taste the authenticity of the tuna instead of fishy soy notes. I am just sad that it's actually one of the chef's signature dish, maybe I'll try the duck dumplings instead next time. The truffle spinach and artichoke dip was the best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had. I would have truffle on anything, what a genius combination. During the entire meal, I could not let go of this dish. Not even when the server wanted to take it away. No way!  The server was attentive and not overboard. He made some good recommendations as well. I loved their cocktails and the bartender even added a little of their own touch to my drink, awesome. No doubt, expect me to be back when I am in the area.",3,2,3

The event manager was extremely responsive leading up to the event and greeted us at the start of our event. Throughout the dinner for 20 guests, the waitstaff was very attentive and made sure to check in often and refill our drinks frequently. They gave us the garden room for a few hours and offered to let us pick our own music to play in the room. The garden room had plenty of room mingling prior to sitting down to eat and was removed from the rest of the restaurant so we weren't getting in other patron's way or worried about disturbing others. We opted for a prix fixe menu, which included three courses and unlimited drinks for 3 hours. The food was divine and I was allowed to design the menu based off of the normal dinner menu, which was very much appreciated. Additionally, the chef was accommodating to any dietary restrictions that were not seen to on our chosen menu. Our dinner went on slightly longer than planned, and the staff did not have a problem with us staying longer than our contract had stipulated. Overall a great experience!

The place was pretty packed, but they were able to seat our party of three right away.For my meal, I decided to go with pan roasted chicken thigh sandwich with truffle parmesan fries. It was a good choice as the sandwich was absolutely delicious. The moistness of the chicken and the flavor combination of the pesto, aioli, and burrata was really a success--and it was a decent portion size as well. That being said, while the fries were good (and a HUGE portion), they were not as flavorful as I was hoping.

The cheeseburger spring rolls was really different and are worth a try. The fries were good too but nothing different than any other restaurant.There is a Mac n Cheese bar at the back, which I wish I went to because that way I could have tried different flavors since they have a small, medium and large portion size there but if you have it at the main dining area, it only comes in one size.Definitely coming back to try the Mac n Cheese bar.",3,,1
104,Hui C.,"Manhattan, NY",326,267,121,3.0,1/23/2017,"TL;DR: very trendy and great space, but too pricy for the quality of food.I came for a friend's birthday and the menu was full of ""comfort foods"" like burgers, mac and cheese, ribs, chicken, and seafood, all 20+ a plate. It's a terrible place to take vegetarians and impossible for vegans (unless you want to pay $25 for a salad...)I eat mussels and clams, so I ordered the Thai mussels after reading bad reviews of the scallops and linguine with clams. This was also a disappointing experience. Half of the mussels were dry and weren't in the red curry sauce. The sauce was awful; I feel like I exceeded my weekly sodium allocation in one bite. For some reason, this dish also came with fries instead of bread, so the red curry sauce more or less went to waste. Sad.The one thing this place does have going for it is the location - it's in a corner space with glass garage-like walls right near the Prince Street subway stop. Really awesome for people watching, but I probably don't need to pay $30 to people watch.",,,

They also own the Mac Bar next door which I frequent and they sell the same Mac n cheese here as well.  This is a great place for lunch with large or small groups.  They do take reservations and I recommend making them if you are having large groups.",1,1,1

Sure, they make a Reuben for $16, but this place is no Katz's. With an eclectic, left-of-center playlist on the speakers and a lot of thin-boned diners, presumably bulimics, eating stacks of pancakes at neighboring tables, I felt like I was meeting my agent in a Beverly Hills restaurant negotiating a role as a crabby Chinese waiter on ""Fresh Off the Boat"". But no, this was SoHo where a whole other breed of urbanite grazes on comfort food with a fresh twist.Fried chicken, stuffed pork chops and a pan-roasted chicken thigh sandwich were prominent on the dinner menu, but I came in for breakfast on a brisk Saturday morning so eggs were on my mind. Even though I was tempted by the $6 Mini-Lobster Rolls and even the $12 Cheeseburger Spring Rolls, I decided to order smart and tried the $12 Avocado Toast, a couple of strategically placed poached eggs on multi-grain wheat toast with a mound of avocado sprinkled with sea salt and chili flakes and drizzled with olive oil (photo: bit.ly/1OUaElA).Along with a side of arugula and pan-roasted potatoes, it was just the egg dish I was looking for without a lot of heft. As a chaser, I continued my health streak with the $11 Kale Salad which featured shiitake mushrooms, golden raisins, cashews and sprouts, all of it tossed in a silken tofu mirin vinaigrette (photo: bit.ly/1LH2CIo). This was a refreshing variation on kale with enough contrasting textures to make it taste heartier than I was expecting. No $14 Apple Pie-Stuffed Brioche French Toast for me. Surprised? Me too, but sometimes I can pull off the whole healthful eater image, but it's tough in Manhattan.FOOD - 4 stars...healthy options that actually taste very good and satisfying for breakfastAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...LA was too much for this manSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a bit on the tentative side but at least tryingTOTAL - 4 stars...solid SoHo option for breakfast, not sure about other meals but the mac n' cheese selection is tempting",10,9,8

I didn't expect to order anything too heavy, for everything seemed like it would be very filling, so I got the lobster mac n' cheese. It was sizzling hot and a little too cheesy, but I finished most of it anyway. My friend ordered the salmon burger which looked pretty good--lettuce & tomato included. The side (fries) was very large, which satisfied the both of us.I usually determine my final rating of a restaurant based on its dessert, so if the main dishes were pretty OK, but the dessert was great, then I'd give the place an extra star. This place's dessert was just the opposite for me; we ordered 3 scoops of ice cream. Firstly, 3 scoops literally meant 3 tiny scoops in an over-sized bowl. Secondly, $10 for OK ice cream is really not okay, especially considering the fact that all the desserts on the menu were $10. Lastly, I probably didn't have a tongue for the flavors that came: vanilla, gingerbread, and salted caramel, or these flavors were just too ""homemade"" for me. The gingerbread tasted like raw ginger and the salted caramel did not taste good at all. My stomach was not happy afterward.Might still come back next time to order something different but would definitely be smarter about my dessert choice.

Yeah, that's basically right up my alley.I was disappointed. While the food was a decent quality and the cocktails were strong, there wasn't anything standout amazing about it. The mac and cheese (I had the mac shroom) was really basic and the noodles were a little smaller than the Kraft m&c sizes. The balance between mushroom to truffle to cheese was off. Then there was the burger. I saw other Yelpers mention the burger. Honestly, if I'm paying $20 for a burger, it should be pretty amazing. It was also average. And you can to consider all those add-ons? No thanks.The vibes are cool and the service is decent.

Chicken came out hot and fresh and remained hot for about thirty minutes while eating. $18 for about 5-6 pieces of chicken. Restaurant is expensive, no doubt. Yet it was worth it if you are looking for an all american and traditional comfort food.",,,

Seating options from outside to inside.We were seated quickly and were allowed adequate time to check out the menu. So many options to choose from! It felt like it took forever for the food to come out, but I think that was because we told the waitress to bring everything out together. We ordered two brunch dishes and an appetizer, which did all come together. Everything tasted extremely delicious. We had the chicken wings, which was nicely spiced and sauced. The Belgian waffles were also very good. Delicatessen scramble with flavorful smoked salmon. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed!They also have an interesting bathroom set-up downstairs. Went downstairs a bit confused before being like, oohhhh.Amazing food and would like to return in the future.",1,,

The wait for table was not long, but we had to wait about 20 minutes in between getting water, placing order, receiving our orders, paying the check. It felt like we were there forever. The cheeseburger spring rolls are exciting on the first bite but kind of gross after a few.The outside seating is really nice for people watching and enjoying the trendy sights NoHo has to offer, but I also think it's where trendiness goes too far and being around the basics of NYC doesn't really make for an enjoyable lunch .",,,1

Sunday at almost 1 and I was seated right away with a group of 3 but it was still crowded in there.Their menu is fabulous. Omelets, benedict, pancakes, waffles, french toast, AMAZING potatoes and fries, burgers, mac and cheese... you name it. The ambiance is super trendy (of course for its location) and day or night looks could be a post-workout spot for a healthy bite (which is what my friends did) or a classy date spot... or anything in between.Drinks looked kind of pricey but nothing horrible for that area. Staff was pretty on it with drink refills and such. Music was a little loud but thats just the grandma in me who likes to talk at a normal volume when I'm dining. I got the eggs benedict but subbed bacon for the canadian. The english muffin was perfectly toasted and the eggs were runny but not overflowing. The bacon was thin and no where near burnt, but just crispy enough, and their potatoes are AMAZING. Not like ew mushy, but not super crunchy. Perfectly salted and the onions in them are so subtle but give it an amazing flavor.Breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert, casual drink... whatever... go here!**** came back on a Friday around 1230 and was also seated right away but it was definitely crowded. I got the chicken sandwich which was delicious and the truffle fries which were awesome as well, overly crispy but not mushy at all- perfect medium. The sandwich was very nicely sized and I got most of the fillings taken off. I ended up with ciabatta with chicken mozz and pickles. Deff needs a nice sauce in there but the ketchup seemed to do the job. The chicken was amazingly crispy and thin with 2 little cutler pieces and the pickle was not sour at all, almost like a cucumber. PERFECTION and even good as leftovers :)",1,,

I went in and I was the first one there out of my whole party so I had to wait at the bar which was okay but then three more people came and we were kind of just waiting in the middle of the passage way because the bar was full. The hostess said she was able to seat us after waiting for some time. It was a party of 7 and they placed us at a table near the bathroom and the kitchen which I did not appreciate all that much but didn't say anything about it because the place was pretty packed.The food was not good in my opinion. Maybe it was because I read so many great reviews and I thought that it was going to be amazing. The Fried Chicken was dry, mac and cheese was just okay and the fries were also just okay.

The french fries here are also amazing!! My brother got a burger which he asked to be cooked medium, but turned out to be very undercooked so he sent it back to the kitchen.

I normally shy away from the whole SoHo touristy area when it comes to eats but Delicatessen seemed like a good menu that made her happy, open airy space to enjoy the really amazing Saturday weather in NYC. The restaurant had a mix of locals and mostly tourists but they had a seat for two in the best traffic location in the restaurant as our semi-precious hostess with attitude seated us. Always the luck of architects as we call it. If there's a worst seat we'll get it.Our waiter swooped in give out the daily special and take our drinks. We decided to indulge and share a spinach/mushroom omelet and a buttermilk pancakes with chocolate and bananas. The omelet was pretty decent but kind of bland. The pancakes had the a great smooth texture. We didn't even need the maple syrup as the bananas and chocolate was already sweet.I have to admit we enjoyed our brunch. The meal was satisfying. The ambiance was loud but still able to hold a conversation. The open, light filled eating space was good to enjoy the day. We were never rushed during or after our meals.

There are so many delicious places a block or two from here that I sort of regret eating here. I'd say it's a consistently okay place that elevates regular dining experiences, but you pay for it with your wallet.I got the asparagus soup which was good. The scallops entree was creative and visually appetizing. The scallops themselves were tender and juicy, but I'm a huge fan of scallops so as long as it's cooked properly, then I'm a fan. I don't know if it's $28 worth, but nonetheless good. The service is good. He basically tried to recommend the entire menu, but he was being friendly so we didn't mind. Also tried to give us wine pairings which was nice of him. My favorite part was the rhubarb pie. I love rhubarb desserts and pie form is even better.

Brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks... you name it, I've been here for it. I've taken countless of friends and family to this trendy little spot in SoHo and all of them have fallen in love with this place too.One thing that I just can't get enough of here is the Cheeseburger Spring Roll. I know, I know, they can prob be found at so many restaurants now, but I still remember years ago when I first saw it on the menu and was so intrigued. Cheesy meat in a crispy spring roll? Yeah I can definitely dig it. They are good. I'm also a fan of their Reuben, which they pack with a huge helping of corned beef. Topped with a generous amount of Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and a delicious Russian dressing, the sandwich will definitely fill you up. The Truffle-Parmigiano Fries are also a must. Crispy and savory, these are probably some of the best fries you can get in NYC. If you love Mac and Cheese, you'll be pleased to know there are tons of options for it, courtesy of Macbar next door. Some are on the more extravagant side and have duck confit and lobster in them, while others are more classic. I'm prob more of a classic mac and cheese kind of girl, but love that there are options if I'm ever feeling more adventurous. While everything I've named thus far is delicious, there have been some dishes that have been okay, like the Lamb Corn Dogs and the Slow Cooked Chicken & Turkey Chili. I've learned to just stick with what I know is good, however, so I'll be coming back for those spring rolls, ASAP.",2,,3

My order of lunguini with clams was a little too saucey, kind of resembled a fettuccine sauce, not particularly appetizing. There was also a pile of melted parmesean cheese atop.... Reeaaaally didn't like that. Seafood and cheese should be eaten separately, not together, and not in heaping shavings. The third glass of wine kind of helped me get through said dish. Clams were good though, can't forget the clams!Restaurant atmosphere is trendy. And if you're lucky, you can say hello to Padma Lakshmi in the bathroom stall.

Did you really think we'd hang around for more bad service?

149,Fariha K.,"Bronx, NY",86,147,76,4.0,3/5/2016,"Solid spot. Came here on a Saturday around 3:30pm for a casual late lunch and left pretty satisfied. This place is very trendy, filled with soho hipsters and shoppers everywhere and is only an 8 minute walk from china town .. Which is also great. I came here unfortunately during a very busy time so the wait time was around 20 minutes. Even though that was pretty long, the lounge downstairs was so convenient and awesome. The couches, along with the view and art work was really awesome and sitting there for twenty minutes just chatting away wasn't too bad to be honest. They took down my number and just texted me when a table had been cleared. Once they did that, I finally got a seat. After being given the menu, I opted for the four cheese macaroni for appetizer along with the salmon burger with truffle fries for entree, as well as the mushroom and spinach omelette with breakfast potatoes on the side. The four cheese macaroni was EXCELLENT. I normally don't like Mac and cheese but this Mac and cheese is legit one of the best in NYC, in my opinion. Most Mac and cheeses have too much cheese in comparison to pasta and this seriously had a perfect balance, which I loved. The salmon burger was pretty good too if you're a seafood lover. I'm not really too much of a fish eater, I just wanted to be adventurous but the flavor in the burger was awesome. The cheese was great and the onion jam was really different. The truffle fries were okay in my opinion, they are very raved about so I ordered them regardless of my disdain towards parmesan but the smell through me off a bit. The portion for the fries were incredible though! And the omelette with breakfast potatoes were delicious. Overall, I really enjoyed the food. At the end I was surprised with a pumpkin cheesecake thing with ice cream on top, which was heavenly. But my only criticism would be the impatient waiters and waitresses. This waiter, in the middle of me eating, asked me if I was done, and then our main waitress gave us the check with out us even asking. I thought that was really rude because, I felt like they were rushing us out. I understand that the place gets busy and stuff, but that was not cordial at all. Aside from that, the place was pretty cool. The vibes were great and my favorite part of the place was definitely the lounge room. Check that out!!",1,,

They also had a sign that said ""Breakfast All Day"" but still no pancakes for us. We ordered wings for appetizers. Delicious. Second  course took over an hour to be brought out. They first cited that it was because we ordered wings that were cooked from raw which is why it was taking so long. Manager came out and told us food is right behind him, 20 minutes later still no food. Manager comes back out and comps HALF the round. Who does that. Comps the glass of wine but charges for the mojito. That took away from the gesture. They also comped us for a dessert. We kept getting lied to about food coming out which is what is upsetting. I think I would have been a little more forgiving if they just said the kitchen had issues switching from brunch to dinner and it would have been better not to comp anything than to do it half ass.",,,

We told the manager that we had horrible service and all he said was a short ""we know"" and ""sorry"". We didn't leave her a tip because it was honestly the worst service we've ever had and especially for somewhere in Soho, we shouldn't have this. A week after we found out that she added herself a 20% tip which we never gave her.

The restaurant is in a prime location, taking up a good amount of real estate as well as taking a corner spot on the block. Our wait was about 30min or so, most likely b/c of the holiday. Because it was a nice day, we got a seat outside - the interior is very well designed so either way it's bueno. Overall, I really enjoyed my time here. We ordered: Cheeseburger Spring Rolls (just to try)Steak & EggsSignature Burger Apparently the craze here is the cheeseburger spring rolls. I thought they were average - it tasted exactly as expected: a cheeseburger, in a spring roll. It was certainly tasty, but very salty. The Steak & Eggs were underwhelming. I've had much better steak and eggs. The Steak tasted a bit burnt, and it definitely had some Korean marination/seasoning (not a bad thing but intriguing to say the least). My favorite by far was the signature burger: special blend ground beef, crisp pork belly, charred tomato, fried egg, brioche bun lathered with warm ""cheese sauce."" The ground beef was very well seasoned, the fried egg is always an amazing touch, and the crispy pork belly was very decadent and definitely a twist. I couldn't fit the lettuce and onions into the burger so I ate those separately. Fries were just alright - some of them felt like they were sitting around forever.We also got two Allagash White's at $8 a pop. Pretty expensive if you ask me but that's just a heads up.Overall, definitely a 4. While it might have seemed like I was critical of the menu, the food was still delicious, and the ambiance really creates a great buzz.

My friend got the Beef and Broccoli and I got the Friday special which is Fish and Chips. I can honestly say it might have been the best fried fish I've ever had. I also liked that the fish came in smaller pieces rather than the whole fish being fried, it made it much easier to eat. I tried my friends steak and Chinese broccoli and that was great too. I definitely need to come back and try out more of the menu at Delicatessen and I am very much looking forward to it. The only negative in my eyes is the price.

161,Aline M.,"FL, FL",6,1,1,1.0,4/23/2018,"We where a group of five friends 9pm April 20, four of my friends choosed the Prix Fix Dinner Menu, even the price is the same as the food separately. One of them did not want the desert anymore and ask for cancellation, Nicole the attendence was horrible, look mad at us, get confused our request and brought just one desert and charged for the four on the bill, so as the desert was going to be charged we asked for all of them, she took the check from our table to include the tips. She brought the other three desserts and the check with +20% before tax on our bill. Told us that the manager ask for her to charge the tip as obligatory 20%, that's why. Them she refused to get one dollar coin, told that she could not have less then the total (even the tips are not obligatory) and wen I told her to take out of the tips because we just have coins for that amount, she accepted the coins. So the food is really overpriced, the waitress Nicole horrible, the manager charg for tips obligatory before tax, first table was so small that I could not move my arms, and the menu Prix Fix makes no sense. Not a place to come back. The Dead Rabbit has better truffle fries anyway.",,,
162,Bina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",341,138,216,3.0,10/17/2015,"I came here with a group of friends on a Thursday night.  I heard so much about their cheeseburger spring rolls.  I must say, it was pretty awesome! Very crispy on the outside but the inside was creamy burger goodness.  We also tried the Korean Chicken Wings, truffle fries, and a couple other chicken dishes.  The wings were pretty spicy but very tasty.  The truffle fries seemed a little too greasy, in my opinion, and they were not crispy.The service is the reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4.  The waiter took forever to take our order and the food took awhile to get to us as well.  It was also very difficult to find a waiter for a refill of water.  I can understand if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't.  In conclusion, I would probably come back to try a few more things on the menu and hope that the service will be better.",3,,1

Not the kind of place I was looking for but it was raining so it was a last resource kind of thing. It's a pretty place though. Nice atmosphere. But that doesn't really justify the near 100$ check. In conclusion we wanted the traditional American cuisine and the best they had to offer were the korean fried chicken wings.,,,

Moscow mule - one of the best in the city. Tuna tartare - I've had better, but it was exceptional itself :) I came here once before, and shared a few appetizers with a friend - we got the cheeseburger spring rolls (BOMB), some avocado roll thing that was notoriously fried for like 3 seconds? (our waiter raved about this, and it lived up to the hype), and the rosé sangria which was delicious.Great venue for friend get togethers, dates, birthdays, large groups - pretty much any occasion!I will definitely be back to try the rest of their salivating menu items.",2,,

It didn't taste bad but it was literally just tons of noodles and pretty much nothing else.  I was starving so extremely disappointed. My sister liked her burger and loved her truffle fries.  All in all with so many options out there too eat i would say keep looking,,,

This is my second time here and if I visit a place once and have any reason not to go to 5 stars I give it another shot unless it is a 2 star. Food is high in sodium on both occasions so I suggest inquiring about how much added salt you may get, like on fries and dressings. Music is a bit loud for conversation and seating is very tight along windows, so much we had to move to let the couple seated next to us sit, and duck while waiter passed them the food. However, a cute spot to stop for a cocktail at the bar and maybe a light snack, just hold the salt.",,,

There are different omelettes you can choose from and they all come with fresh ingredients. My girlfriend ordered the apple pie stuffed French toast and it was fantastic. We also ordered the Belgian waffles which were good. The servers are very attentive and professional. Next time I'm in the area during breakfast, I ll be sure to come stop in.",,,

180,Sophie P.,"Boston, MA",1017,406,1692,3.0,7/13/2014,"This is a great place to go to show NY to a visitor or enjoy lunch on a nice summer day. The ambiance is very chic and young and has a slightly Korean fusion menu. I just got apps: the kale salad and cheeseburger spring rolls. The kale salad was a good portion and a better option if you don't want a giant plate of salad that can get a little boring and make you a basic bitch. Jk. The salad had a ginger-ish vinaigrette with cashews and was surprisingly filling. But I wanted to test the hype of the cheeseburger spring rolls! The idea sounded good in theory, but it was really just patty meat in melted cheese fried in a egg roll skin. There was ketchup and mustard to add to the cheeseburger feel. I don't know if I expected something different, but it was pretty anti-climatic. The app came in 3 rolls, which was perfect for me to have alone.My friend got the turkey burger and the patty was really thick. She said it was really good.I def wanted to try the Korean salad dishes or fusion Korean apps. I wonder how well they could pull off the fusion dishes. The restaurant has a great vibe so it's a great place to socialize and catch up. The food is pretty mediocre in my opinion.",1,2,1

Updated review","As  I often say re 5 stars, it doesn't mean Michelin ratings. It means a place with perfect service, music, vibe and decor I want to go again and again. Some famous Brooklyn DJ I've not heard of because I am old does the music tracks and it's great. I have never failed to meet interesting people from all parts of the city, including a lady on the UWS from Pittsburgh with whom I had such great chat that the bartender (sweet lady named Brittany) though I knew and so combined our tabs. It's my go-to SoHo place and instead of finally trying that caviar pizza at Prvada down from Henley Vapor, I went to my stand-by. I love this place. Drinks are great and because it was too late to eat that Korean skirt steak spinach salad i just had that flash fried ahi roll appetizer and dessert. Patrick is a doll and goes to Henley Vaporium and he recommended this lemon meringue dessert. I only eat dessert on a prix fixe when it's just sitting there. I never buy a dessert at a restaurant because I could just have more wine or whiskey for about the same money.  Or at Franny's in Park Slope which has the best panna cotta in NYC. But this is worth going to SoHo for no reason whatsoever. BEST DESSERT EVER. I will pine in California for two months just thinking about it. I love this place. Also I never knew there was an F train uptown by the gas station. I usually take the 6 from Spring but Broadway/Lafayette has an F train. Fabulous",,,4

I had the ""quacking chicken"" which was a sandwich with two chicken cutlets, topped with pulled pork, cheese, peppers, lettuce, and bbq sauce. It also included a side of fries, and was priced at $18. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the pork was very moist and flavorful. An incredible sandwich that was very filling as well.",,,

I ordered the steak and it was mediocre at best. This resturant should focus more on its food than the atmosphere! I also had the mac n cheese its average nothing to celebrate and definitely not worth the money. I expected wayyyy better the only thing tht saved this review were the servers and staff they literally make the place!,,1,

I always order the Mayan chipotle mac and cheese and the tuna tar tar. Occasionally I get the burger with the truffle fries which is also delicious. The sangria is amazing especially on a hot day.

We sat down and ordered drinks and food to share. The first round of drinks were fine, however the second were much weaker and we actually sent them back. For food, we shared a Faro salad with skirt steak, 4 cheese Mac and cheese, and mussels. The salad was delicious, the meat was perfectly cooked. The Mac and cheese was also delicious. The mussels were ok. I think they would have been better if the sauce was evenly distributed over all the mussels, instead of mostly on the bottom. Overall, the food was pretty good.
