0,Naomi Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,293,331,5.0,7/28/2018,"Okay. $10 for an hour of unlimited mimosas that literally never go below 1/2 empty?? Yes please!This was my first venture up to Dyker Heights and it definitely won't be my last. I met up with a friend in the area and she suggested this place for a classic brunch with - as previously mentioned - unlimited mimosas. It was also less than 1/2 a block from the A train, so it was a no brainer for me. They have indoor and outdoor seating and lucky for us there was a table for 2 outside in the shade. Nothing like eating al fresco in the summertime amirite? I ordered the eggs Benedict and she got the other kind of Benedict made with plantains and fried cheese. Believe me when I tell you both of them were amazing. The mimosas also kept flowing and the waiter was super attentive and definitely let us go past the hour since it was a bit slow at that time.All in all, I definitely would recommend this place! The food is great and the prices are fair so why not return to try something else.",,,2
1,Vera A.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",0,39,47,3.0,10/20/2018,Good service. The food is delish. The 1 hour mimosa is 1 hour! No more no less. Good to see they make sure they give you what you are paying for. They also make sure your glass is always full. But.. 20% service tip automatically charged to our bill????? We were only 3 people. We ordered 3 items from menu and the $15 mimosa package.,,,
2,Aaliyah P.,"Philadelphia, PA",308,590,504,4.0,6/24/2018,"Super cute place with a very attentive staff. Met a friend who lives in the area here for a later Saturday drink . The offer splits of some of my favorite champers. We split the chorizo and manchego flatbread it was worth every calorie.My only issue was the the additional charge of the merchant service fees added to our check . When you own a business you are responsible for those fees not your customers. It's actually quite tacky and the fact that this is no where disclosed on their yelp page , website , menu or posters throughout is slightly deceiving. It takes no time at all to advise customers of what padded charges you expect them to pay.If I didn't have such a great experience here prior to the issue of fee it may have deterred me from returning .I'll be back I'll just bring cash next time .",2,,

I am sooo glad I came here - I came here on a little date with my best friend to catch up & it was sooo worth it! I was looking for a nice spot to visit & came across this one online & figured I'd try it out. Beautiful setting & an amazing time!",,,

5,Leila L.,"New York, NY",32,222,377,3.0,5/18/2018,"Limited selection of food, good selection of drinks. A bit overrated, quite overpriced. My favorite is the shrimp dish. It's quite special and well presented. The sliders, oysters and ceviche are really just a-ok. The Champaign sangria looks cute but tastes kinda weird. The waiter couldn't remember our order (and never used something to record it) and came back to ask for a repetition, which is unprofessional. In the end the check turned out to be a much bigger number than I thought. Probably won't go back.",,,
6,Denise F.,"New York, NY",4,81,101,5.0,10/4/2018,"A friend and I decided to have a drink / few finger foods here on a Thursday night. Upon arrival we were immediately seated and attended too. We ordered two jars of sangria which were pretty good along with the Mac/ cheese, eggplant, loaded fries & wings. Our waiter Angie was beyond nice and very professional:) we also enjoyed the live singer Jay.",,,
7,Isabel T.,"New York, NY",28,20,14,2.0,10/14/2018,Ive been to this place a few times. I really enjoy their food. The atmosphere is very relaxed and i love the jazz music they play. This is a great place to eat and enjoy a glass of wine.,,,
8,Abigail R.,"New York, NY",2439,274,963,4.0,6/12/2018,Pop and pour it's very cute! When you walk in you can see the entire restaurant as it is very small. They have nice lounge red seats and the bar right at the entrance. The severe were all very nice. My friend had ceviche of the day and I ordered the sirloin burger. The burger was good but nothing out of the usual it had a tomato marmalade and was kind of sweet. They have lots of wine to choose from and & assorted cheese condiments to pair along with. My sister had the lobster roll and it was wow delicious the size is rather small but very good! I can't wait to come back and try some new things on the menu.,26,6,14
9,Catherine T.,"New York, NY",1391,204,624,4.0,5/31/2018,Came here last with my best friend for a quick bite. The place itself is cute. It's a wine bar so they have different types of wines all over the place. It's a great place to sit and chat and have a few appetizers. I got their ceviche of the day which was the red snapper. It was delicious. My only complaint is that it was soo small. Could be a little bigger for the price. My best friend had the sirloin burger with fries which she said was fresh and tasty. They also have bottled beer. Would definitely come back for their oysters. The staff is friendly.,4,2,3
10,Amber C.,"Chino Hills, CA",202,9,4,5.0,10/7/2018,I stumbled upon this place looking for bottomless mimosas while in New York. It was $10 for one hour! Your glass is never empty and the staff is super nice. The food is also delicious. The place itself has an amazing aesthetic and you will feel welcomed as soon as you enter the door. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for brunch in New York.,,,
11,Tamara R.,"Manhattan, NY",15,44,37,4.0,6/19/2018,"What more could a girl ask for?  The affair started with-A glass of RED with a ROSE!Then my happy hour Sweet Chili Wings were delivered to my table! It was love at first bite!  But the wings quickly disappeared...so I added one succulent slider...it was all I needed to satisfy my appetite- oh how I long to return again...when you visit, send my love.

12,Lorraine T.,"Bronx, NY",11,91,237,3.0,4/15/2018,"It's 75 degrees in April on a Saturday in NYC.... WE MUST BRUNCH!!! My girlfriend and I picked this place for a mid day brunch. We had reservations for 1:45. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and given our choice of the 3 open tables that were left(this cafe is really small). After our lovely waitress Yasiel gave us water and menus she then mentioned they were out of Flatbreads & the Lobster Mac & cheese. (Brunch is until 4pm there's 2 hrs left and you're already running out of things???) Of course the Mac is what I planed on ordering so instead I went with the Steak & Eggs, my friend had the chicken & waffles. My friend asked Yasiel what ancho is (ingredient listed in syrup served with waffles) and she didn't know, so my friend opted for plain maple syrup. The eggs were bland, steak was salty, home fries were ok. I asked for steak sauce and was told they don't have any... ????... but you sell steak?! NO???.... For $10 extra I opted for the unlimited mimosa for an hr, the mimosa was good and my waitress kept my glass full. All in all I wouldn't return... something about running out of food always rubs me the wrong way. ALSO when paying with a card they charge a .75 fee per card. Which is not disclosed on the bill but shows on your customer & merchant receipt.",6,,

14,Ding M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",58,6,5,5.0,4/14/2018,"Small menu, great food. Comfortable place for Saturday night with family and/or friends. Crostinis is definitely the highlight: delicate, rich as well as smooth. The sliders are a bit dry, but possibly my bar is too high. Oysters and crispy shrimps are good too. The ceviche is ok: tastes like Thai food, which I'm never a big fan unfortunately.Don't miss this place if you are around.",1,,
15,A. J.,"New York, NY",3,23,19,5.0,10/2/2018,"Perfect laid back place. Great food (something for everyone) I had the churrasco which was everything, the mashed potatoes were so good that you could lick them off the plate (but I didn't). Jazzy music (you can talk to the person next to you w/o yelling), smooth vibes (the ambiance is chill) and A+ service (was served by Ezra who is a doll). Attentive service and they're great on recommending pairings with your food. Great place if you're a wine lover.",,,
16,Lissette C.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",237,103,554,5.0,2/13/2018,"The only negative is that this spot isn't bigger.  It's such an amazing intimate spot with amazing staff and even better food. Everything I had here was super rich and fresh, cooked to perfection. We started with some white wine and prosecco that was part of the happy hour and it surely didn't taste like typical house happy hour drinks in dyckman. Definitely higher quality at a nice discount. We then paired that with 3 crostinis for $12, the ricotta honey was my fav, with the mushroom coming in a close second, lastly the prosciutto fig.  I was impressed with the ceviche portion size, the turkey meatballs were YUM. The buratta salad was so light and flavorful - perfect addition to make me feel like I was healthy. The steak was cooked to perfection and the garlic mash tasted like my mom made them. And I cannot forget the chorizo manchego flat bread, I guess we can say ""left the best for last""   To top off the night, when the staff found out it was my bday they surprised me with a cup of champagne bigger than my head and a complimentary milkshake dessert with freshly made fudge & churros. Must say it was time, money, and calories well spent!",1,1,1
17,Erica C.,"Seattle, WA",1,20,17,5.0,2/18/2018,"I came for brunch and got the croissant eggs benny, so good!! We also got the bottomless brunch for $10 (for one hour), there were five of us and we all had a good time. Between us we tried the chicken and sweet potato waffle, croissant eggs benny, pesto flatbread, and Pop rancheros. The fries are so good for a side (highly recommend, they're extra crisp at and juicy). This was my first time coming for brunch and it was a blast! They're so nice here (best service!) so I usually come to study (good coffee) and then stay for beer or wine. But I would definitely come back for brunch, I recommend!!",1,,
18,Mariela R.,"Brooklyn, NY",361,20,21,5.0,6/21/2018,"Great staff! Delicious menu. They switch it up to accommodate seasons but keep their signature dishes. They also have AMAZING drinks.

It is unlike any other location on the Dyckman strip. The decor is grown and sexy! The atmosphere is calm and relaxing.My husband and I decided to go for a drink one day and I have been there at least once a week ever since. The staff is very attentive and the owner is the sweetest!!Overall it is a charming place one can go to and catch a good vibe!!

21,Yanet B.,"North Bergen, NJ",171,2,3,5.0,7/6/2017,"There's not enough words to describe how pleased and surprise I am with this little germ. Lets a start with the atmosphere: 10 stars out of 5 !  Warm, clean,welcoming... the perfect place to sit with some friends and talk about projects, or to chill and enjoy good music and wine. Friendly staff. And now lets move to what's important: THE FOOD ! I was on ecstasy! I ordered the  Ricotta & Mascarpone cheese w/ Honey Truffle and the minute I tried we ordered the second one and if it was for me I would've spend the night trying everything on the menu. I got to meet the chef at the end, a nice lovely girl, she'll go places lol. That food was out of this world, small portion, totally worth it. Here are some pictures so you know at least what I'm talking about, enjoy and pass by.Ps:  I don't work there, I don't know anyone who works there, this place was recommended by a friend and I'm giving my honest review.",3,1,
22,Karen S.,"New York, NY",0,17,7,3.0,1/14/2018,"We love supporting our neighborhood spots. Been dying to try this place since it opened last year. We ventured out in 20 degree weather for an early brunch. Quaint, nice music, ok decor. Not too busy during the 11:00- 11:30 timeframe so we easily got a table. Waited 10mins before we were served. Food came out faster than the wait at least.  With only 3 tables and 1 waiter I'm surprised that the service was slow. Would definitely not come here when super hungry again. Ordered French toast that came with 2 tiny pale strawberries used more for garnish. Some assortment of fruit as a side would have been more complimentary and deserved with this dish. Basically don't order the French toast if you'll be satisfied with 5 slices of thin bread and maple syrup that was very flavorful and that was the best part of this dish in my opinion. I'll definitely come back and see what dinner options have to offer, but brunch is definitely not for me here.",1,,1
23,Veronica A.,"New York, NY",0,5,5,5.0,2/3/2018,"First time visiting and went for brunch. We got there a bit late (3pm) so the lobster mac & cheese we wanted to try had already ran out. We opted instead for the steak and eggs (adequate) and the Pop Rancheros - sunny side up eggs on a skillet of squash and zucchini in a spicy tomato sauce. Delicious! The unlimited mimosas were on point and our waiter, Herman, was wonderful. We checked out the wine list for future reference and their mark up is very reasonable. The ambience was lovely as was the music. We will definitely go back.",1,,
24,Elariel P.,"Bronx, NY",2,20,6,5.0,7/20/2018,Amazing staff. The food is great and fresh. Best place in town to have a drink and enjoy great food. Outdoor sitting is great as well.,,,
25,Ihor M.,"New York, NY",0,15,5,2.0,6/15/2018,"There is nothing special about this place that grants 3% surcharge if you pay with a credit card. Obviously, they forget to mention that when they charge your card. Sangria there isn't any good - tastes like something from a carton box, and I'm pretty sure they drop fruits in just before serving the drink to you. The wait time for pasta and flatbread was at least 40 minutes. A waiter came and apologized for that, so I'm not sure if such long times are normal there. Bottom line, this is a terrible place to go, but there are- better places in the neighborhood.",1,,
26,Timothy N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",155,2,4,5.0,4/30/2018,"Overall a good date spot. Food is good. Decor is good. Service is good. Only thing is that my $10 Churros were raw inside, but I've been here twice and this was the only thing that I've had an issue with.",,,
27,K C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,19,10,4.0,1/26/2018,"I have come to this place two times for Sunday brunch. The service was very good, both times the server was attentive & friendly. In this neighborhood the prices for brunch are becoming unjustifiable but Pop and Pour is reasonable and the food tastes great. The only thing I would change is the wooden plates to eat off of. The wood is porous & clumsy on such small tables.  Also, the coffee is great.",,1,

I always like to say..you can get food anywhere...you can get drinks anywhere..but for the past year this is the unique business that sets the standard for dyckman.

33,Mike L.,"New York, NY",64,6,11,2.0,3/26/2018,"I came here with high expectations because of the near 5 stars in reviews. I left Very Disappointed. I came for Brunch and ordered myself an ""omelette"" with chorizo, peppers and cheddar cheese. Ladies and gentlemen, this was the worst, most pathetic excuse for an omelette I've ever had in my life. Just thrown together like clothes in a luggage. It had No flavor at all, the texture was that of McDonald's eggs, and you know I wouldn't be surprised being they're next door neighbors They didn't have home fries which was an option on the menu and it was only about 2:50 pm in the day, so I had to opt for the French fries, and they were decent. Had bottomless Mimosa's, which is basically bottomless oranges in this place, they put about 80 % juice 20 % champagne, it's limited to one hour, but I was granted an extra 10 minutes because of how sad the omelette was. Lastly the music was too loud, everyone was basically yelling at each other, probably talking about my sad omelette. Would not be back.",1,1,

The waitress was polite and attentive, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time (we were also the only people in the restaurant at the time). My meal was really good and my friend enjoyed hers as well. Everything tasted really fresh. The portions were a good value--my friend had to take half of her sandwich home.There was an option for $10 unlimited mimosas, but neither of us opted for that this time, so I can't speak to that. I will have to go back to try that another time.",1,,

This spot is it! We each had some Cabernet from South Africa that was really smooth and complex and finished with the taste of currants. We didn't order anything to eat so I can't review the food, but the atmosphere was chill and the soundtrack that played for the chilling was totally on point. Jonicio was our server and he greeted us with a smile and suggested the delicious Cabernet when we weren't sure what we wanted, he was friendly and attentive and kept the night going strong with enjoyable experiences.

Today was my day off and I needed my morning fix. I've walked by Pop & Pour quite a few times and decided to give it a try today. I'm so glad I did! When I walked in a young lady greeted me and took my order. She was extremely pleasant. The space is charming and clean. The Zesty Avocado was EVERYTHING!

Came here last minute for dinner after Seamless ruined my order by making me wait 3 hours for some simple sushi. What a delicate surprise this restaurant turned out to be. The decor was beautiful, our waiter was very attentive, the food was delicious but the most important fact: I ate while have a conversation at a normal speaking voice, due to no music blasting and hookah smoke blowing  in my face.The batata waffle & chicken was delicious. In fact, I'm currently craving it as I type this review.... The crispy shrimp came in such a pretty presentation which matched how yummy it was!Loving this new trend of restaurants coming to the Dyckman area. I can't wait to come back here.",1,1,1

47,Kris H.,"New York, NY",134,18,22,5.0,4/29/2017,"Loved the cute little spot. Pop and Pour is such a refreshing change from the other Dyckman Street Restaurants where the norm for ambience is hookah smoke thick enough and music loud enough to stop you from seeing or talking to the rest of your group. Not for this place though.This cafe has set the right tone in ambience - cozy small tables, music in the background and dim lighting - perfect for a date is my verdict. The service was impeccable - efficient and super friendly. We had the special pan seared salmon with garlic mashed potato and the shrimp with the champagne sauce. While the salmon was my favorite , the shrimp was really good too but turned soggy when we went back to it after a heated discussion on a movie plot. So if you get the shrimp gobble it fast don't wait too long.",1,1,

49,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,3/28/2017,"I had been itching to this place to open for ages, then, when it did, I still didn't get a chance to go there for a month even though I live a block away. OOPS. Haaa. Regardless, it was worth the wait!Located just a few steps east of the A on Dyckman, Pop & Pour is a new restaurant and bar that has a stylish and chill vibe that doesn't really exist in many other restaurants along that stretch of road. (Not that I have a problem with the occasional party and hookah. Ha!) Recently, they started pre-fixe Sunday brunches with ample food and alcohol! For $29 bucks, you'll get an excellent meal and a good buzz. I went with my roommate, and she ordered assorted pastries, the stripped flank steak, and ice cream-filled cream puffs. I went for the truffled deviled eggs, coffee pancakes, and strawberries with basil and whipped cream. I was able to steal a bite of all of my roommate's bites, and I loved everything she ordered. Namely, the steak was shredded and served atop a crispy corn arepa with avocados; though I loved the deep molasses-like flavor of my pancakes, perfectly matched with lavender maple syrup, I might have to go for the steak myself next time!Also, of note, the sangria we got along with our food kept on coming! Though they have cleverly-worded yet necessary ""House Rules"" posted on the tables concerning the rules of dining in for brunch, everyone (including ourselves, but of course!) was well-behaved in the two hours we eat and drank, and the sangria - both the red and white - were potent and flavorful. The first glass of sangria was in a regular-sized wine glass, but we got upgraded for Round #2. Ha! Needless to say, we both had excellent post-brunch naps.I can certainly attest that Pop & Pour has a SOLID brunch, and I look forward to walking down the street to this place for more brunches and Happy Hours in the future!",1,1,2

51,Cadmo M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",566,5,3,5.0,3/24/2017,Absolutely LOVE this place. Walked in to this location expecting the usual Dyckman style bar with hookah smoke and rowdiness and was completely shocked by the outcome. For starts the staff and the owner were full of joy and a want to educate us on their extensive craft beers and wines and their menu. The food made me close my eyes and want to stop eating because of how good it was I wanted to save it for later. The best way to describe Pop and Pour is as an escape to a different world from the typical nightlife and craziness of its neighboring establishments. I highly recommend everyone to come here and this place will for sure become one of my go to locations!!!,2,,
52,Zulay A.,"New York, NY",191,113,3,3.0,4/3/2017,"I had to meet a friend to discuss future projects and thought let me give this place a try. For starters the quaint space is very inviting and well put together. My only concern was that we came in at a weird time, Sunday afternoon while they were transitioning from brunch to dinner, the music was obnoxiously loud and it was hard for us to carry on a conversation. Dyckman in general is loud but being the vibe that this place gave off from what I read I thought I would be walking in into a more subtle ambiance. Our server was pleasant and attentive, drinks were good, food was ok nothing out of the ordinary.  I'll give this place another try on a weekday and check out the differences.",1,,
53,Dee F.,"Bronx, NY",52,36,44,5.0,5/1/2017,"Great food, amazing atmosphere and super friendly staff.  This place gives an new meaning to Dyckman, I can come here and relax with a nice glass of wine or my favorite beer.  The food delicious and just the right serving.",,,
54,Sarah M.,"Bronx, NY",0,28,12,5.0,6/11/2017,This place is new to the area so I thought I would give it a try. It was delicious and the service was fast! The decor was adorable and I really liked the set up!,,,
55,Chajaira R.,"Bronx, NY",65,26,2,5.0,12/8/2017,Small cosy space the service was great. I really loved the black bean burger and the coffee here is also amazing!!,,,
56,Aisha M.,"Manhattan, NY",34,18,2,3.0,3/3/2018,"Varied selection of wine, and tasty bites. The prices are a little bit all over the place, but whatever you have, is well prepared and tastes good. Be sure to order the churros dessert. It's small, but is so delicious!! It's served with a rich chocolate sauce for dipping. The sauce itself is great - i wanted to lick the bowl. Perfect date location since the staff give you enough room to have some privacy while also being attentive. I've visited 3 times and two out of the three times, all the staff were eating on the floor while guests were at the table. And i don't mean a snack - I'm talking either 10 snacks in succession, or they were all eating dinner while i was trying to gaze in my date's eyes. Maybe I'm old school - when i was waiting tables, i wasn't allowed to eat in my guests' faces. I found that to be annoying given the setting. This is a wine bar, not a dive bar where we sit around noshing together and throwing back shots with the bartender.",,1,
57,Angy A.,"Manhattan, NY",46,13,1,5.0,7/19/2017,"What can I say about this place but thank God for a classy hookah less spot uptown. Pop and Pour is owned by a young Dominican couple who strive to serve the best food along with a wonderful selection of beers and wine. Bring a date, have a meeting, chill during brunch or simply stop by for your morning coffee or lunch break, either way you won't regret it. I'm obsessed with the Italian chicken sandwich on the lunch menu, and often find myself coming from the Bronx for lunch and returning to work with a smile on my face. A few nights a week you can enjoy live music while you eat. The prices are moderate, food delicious,  an inviting ambiance and attentive staff. Oh and do thank Chef Farys for preparing the delectable menu!",,1,
58,Manos T.,"Brunate, Italy",0,1,0,5.0,3/20/2018,"Great food, the Sangria was ok (maybe too much ice?) but the wine list looked promising. We will visit soon to try it.  We came here on a date and it was romantic and lovely with good music, but quiet enough you could talk. Great atmosphere!",,,
59,Fallon O.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,1,7,4.0,9/6/2017,"Cute, chic spot in the heights love everything food drinks the atmosphere, decor, staff. Lychee sangria super strong and yum. Will be back I hope it maintains these great vibes. Try the crabmeat salad arepas tasty!",,,
60,Aimee T.,"New York, NY",21,38,0,5.0,6/29/2017,"Go here NOW.  I am still floating on a cloud, thinking about how lucky I am that Pop and Pour exists in my hood!  Sweet and delicious happy hour oysters, superb wines, other scrumptious goodies- all reasons to go and enjoy this unique spot.  The atmosphere is also fun, creative and chill.  I can't wait to try their lunch menu too!  What an amazing addition to Dyckman!!",,,
61,Pavni M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,40,23,5.0,7/13/2017,"Loved the food. Wet after visiting Cloisters and it was GOOOD. Ordered a black bean burger, one of the open faced sandwiches and sweet potato fries. The ingredients were fresh and the flavour was on point. The food didn't feel greasy (not even the fries) and the serving size was just right. Th ambience is casual with a touch of elegance and the staff is friendly. The food takes a while to come so it's a good thing they have a decent list of wines and cocktails.",,,
62,Adeana S.,"New York, NY",2,5,0,4.0,5/21/2017,Welcomed scene from what's normally in the neighborhood. Really cute place with good wine and food and nice waiter. Perfect date night spot.,,,
63,Raymundo O.,"Manhattan, NY",118,4,0,5.0,7/21/2017,"This has become my go to location on weekday/weekend nights. At this point I am on first name basis with the wait staff. Which is amazing since they can honestly guess my order and/or suggest a dish whenever I go. Honestly an amazing addition to the neighborhood, with an amazing selection of wines. Needless to say I will be going this week, at least Once, possibly Twice, whose kidding more like Thrice...",,,
64,Peter H.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/29/2017,"Perfect vibe for the neighborhood! The wine selection was wonderful and the food was outstanding. $1 happy hour oysters is an insanely good deal, and the mignonette was incredible. WaHi/Inwood community please keep this place in business, because I want to have this here for a long time!",,,
65,Judy S.,"Teaneck, NJ",54,16,1,5.0,11/5/2017,This place is a hidden gem. The potato and leek soup is amazing and the butternut ravioli is lick your plate good. The tropical sangria was sooo good. Perfect for a date nite or girls nite out. Love the ambiance and all the small touches that transport you to a little cafe in Paris. We will definitely be back.,,,
66,Elan B.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,2.0,12/5/2017,"The cost of the food is way too pricey in comparison to the portions which are extremely small. The place itself isn't really big at all. I'd call it a hole in the wall dressed up really nice. I'm tired of all the ratchet places but opening up ok-nice places with overpriced food and small portions only adds to the lack of good, affordable food in the neighborhood.  This isn't quality whatsoever. It's just a nicer place to go to in a neighborhood thats barren of chill, relaxing atmospheres with good prices and good food.",,,
67,Sally L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,3,5.0,4/19/2017,"Really lovely new spot. perfect ambiance, wine selection, and food. staff is really attentive and warm. can't wait to go back!",,,
68,Angelina R.,"Bronx, NY",22,11,0,5.0,9/20/2017,"Wonderful experience! Great service, beautiful interior and an amazing happy hour. The food is yummy too. Highly recommend.",,,
69,Mariana G.,"New York, NY",110,35,23,5.0,2/19/2017,"Went there with my family (most of them kids) food even tho small portions was delicious, I'm so glad to see a place like this one around the neighborhood, ambiance great, would have love if lights by the couch were more down, but still everything was great, best part dessert!! Yayyy being a manager in a Spanish restaurant I know a lot about churros, the ones here are to die for... kids love them... I will certainly be back and recommend the place to friends and family.... thumbs up for our server, I don't know his name tho but it was a guy with a pony tail... everyone else was very friendly... many good things to said about this place.. I love that it doesn't fall into the restaurants around the area where everyone is smoking hookah(nothing again it) whoever came with the idea for this restaurant... you rock... from entrance to bathroom all this place invite for class and sophistication!!  Ps:: those lamps I love them!!!",,,
70,Aarti S.,"New York, NY",1,3,0,5.0,3/22/2017,Originally ranked it a 2 stars because I didn't understand the wine menu and felt the staff could have explained it better. I'm now a regular enjoying delicious wine and great food! Love this place!,1,,
71,Jasmin S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/9/2017,The food is delicious! Great ambiance! Live band. Totally enjoyed ourselves. Try the chicken and waffles and steak arepa! Sooooooo goood!,,,
72,Guadalís D.,"Chicago, IL",2,4,0,5.0,2/24/2017,"Went there last night. Very laid back atmosphere. I'm so happy to have a wine bar so close to me! Their selection is great and the bites to eat are delicious. The decor is super cute. It's a great casual date night spot or a girls night with wine. I'm very detail oriented so bathrooms are a big deal for me and their bathroom is clean and beautiful. The owner was also there and she was very nice. Everyone there seemed to enjoy their job, which is always a good sign. I will definitely be going back again and again and again....",,,
