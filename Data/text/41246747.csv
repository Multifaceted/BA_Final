0,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,4.0,9/28/2018,These guys have two adjacent spaces/venues which makes it troublesome to review.  I was at Cannibal Liquor House (111 E 29th) vs Cannibal Butcher & Beer (113 E 29th).  The space at 111 E 29th is very modern with a lot of blonde wood.  Bartender was professional and amiable early on a Friday evening.  Not busy.I did not notice any music. I stopped in for a cocktail - a Negroni - which was fine. The back bar was very sparse.  Several Scotches but only one Jameson Irish whiskey.  No idea why there was not more product on display. Food prices were moderate. I need to go back to try the bone marrow.,1,,1
1,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,3.0,10/4/2018,"This is a good lunch spot.The menu is eclectic and small. It has unusual​ items like pig ears and pigs head reuben - which I did not have.What I did have was:- Spicy fried chicken sandwich - yum, their hot sauce is very good- Tuna tartar salad - very good but the portion was small- Everything Pretzel - very goodI enjoyed what I ate but again the menu is somewhat small.",11,3,7
2,Terror L.,"New York, NY",1,3,2,4.0,9/26/2018,"Dropped in on a whim after recently moving to the neighborhood, and left fantasizing about what I would order next time.Pricey, stylish, and perhaps overly curated- but arguably worth it. I had a lamb & olive sausage special, as well as a merguez, both of which were phenomenal. Easy to tell that the proprietors take their meat seriously. Service was top notch.Lovingly selected variety of microbrews on tap.Overall a bougie but excellent place to indulge in your deepest, darkest carnivorous fantasies.",,,
3,Claude W.,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, NY",116,186,1478,5.0,7/10/2018,"This was a shot in the dark. The restaurant i originally chose had no AC. Was really looking for a place with cold beers. When i pulled up beer in Yelp search, this was one of the closest places to my original destination. It seemed like a good concept.  That was an understatement.  It 2 restaurant places in one. 2 separate bars, and 3 seating locations including a backyard.  We decided to hit the backyard.The have an   interesting menu when it comes to wagyu beef, kielbasas and other meats. The wagyu i had last night was so delicious and even though they gave me a steak knife, i could have used a butter knife. Almost forgot about the other things i had. Had the fries (more like wedges) that was cooked in beef, lamb ft, and one more fat i cannot think now. It was crispy and delicious.  The roasted beets were great, the spicy beef jerky, the potato and artichoke plate and the thing that really tipped it off was the bone marrow with the extra bourbon. Yes, after you have the bone marrow, with the delicious toast and seasoned garnish and raddish, you have an option of a shot of bourbon to flow down from the top of the hollwed out bone marrow into your mouth where it picks up the flavor and delivers it to your mouth. Wow, that was an experience. Our waiter was named Ian, awesome guy. The entire wait staff participated and coordinated our meal. It was an unbelievably nice dining experience!",2,1,1
4,Mike B.,"Washington, DC",24,136,508,4.0,7/7/2018,"Their beer selection is impressive. However the tap and bottle list were distressingly overtaken by events, so you have to ask what they have at that moment. (Or you can check out the bottles sitting in the glass-front fridges.) The focus is heavily on German and Belgian beers. To eat I had the duck, which was very good. I would highly recommend this establishment.",1,1,1
5,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,347,521,2.0,9/6/2018,"The Cannibal feels like a couple of gimmicks + a vaguely risqué establishment name masquerading as event dining. The food was passably decent, but these are steakhouse prices at burger joint taste/experience levels. Aside from the excellent hostess, service was slow and uninterested. The menu is ill-defined--a bit unclear as to what sections are appetizers, sides and entrées, and about half the items were listed as Market Price (MP).  However, the server (Adam) just dropped the menus and came back an interminably long time later, expecting us ready to order, and seemed surprised/irritated we there might be a few questions on the menu and the pricing. My friend was pretty set on the ribeye, which it turned out was only for 2  (not noted on menu, which seemed like a glaring oversight), at an MP of $150. Seems like stuff that you might want to mention before/while customers wait 20 minutes to order, and we were so hangry we just decided to put in the order there. We ordered the bone marrow appetizer--marrow is a favorite, but this was a boring and disappointing--a bit overcooked and too melted to spread. Then as soon as we finished, the waiter swooped in to ask if we wanted a whiskey shot poured down the marrow bone--a popular(?) off-menu option here? So now I'm concerned that we just ordered a $150 steak at a frat house. The ribeye was admittedly good--the only reason I'm not going one star. Nicely cooked, decently seasoned--for a steak at a normal/nice restaurant, I'd be relatively impressed. But Peter Luger's this ain't. Bar setup is weird too, they only have a few drafts, but apparently offer a extensive amount of bottled beer, but off menu.  A cicerone came by with a few recommendations to pair with our steak.  Not bad selections, but would have been nice to have been offered one under $20.  And I know my beer, and would have been happy to peruse a menu and choose, but I was told they ""run through them too fast to keep a beer bottle list."" You know what? They're doing amazing things with computers and printers these days. Just felt weird and disorganized and unimpressive.  If I spent half of what I did, I would have considered it a decent, forgettable meal.  At this price point, though, it was memorable enough to leave me irritated and wishing I spent my dining budget elsewhere.",7,4,3
6,Sunny G.,"Hoboken, NJ",175,53,97,1.0,11/10/2018,"Unfortunately there was nothing appetizing here. Besides the food, even the service wasn't great. The order was messed up and the waiter didn't even offer to fix it. I won't be going back.",,,
7,Laura K.,"New York, NY",148,85,16,4.0,9/21/2018,"I came here with friends and our party quickly grew from 3 to 6 people within minutes. The hostess at first seemed slightly exasperated that we were trying to squeeze so many people at a smaller table, but quickly came to the rescue with a bigger table in the back. The service was on point and the burger impressive. Definitely the type of menu you have to be ready for and in the mood for but tasty. One fun fact ... there are pictures of Pee Wee Herman on the walls riding his bicycle. The theme of the restaurants as shared with us by our server was bikes. This wasn't exactly obvious because all the images of Pee Wee Herman. But now you know...",,,
8,Rene B.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,342,798,4.0,8/30/2018,I came here with a few other people looking for good food with an edge.  I was disappointed that the pig head was not available due to a special event. But the food we had was good.beef tartare  - very goodpig ear salad - delicious take on pig ears which I used to hate as a kidchicken liver - this was smothered in jelly which kind of destroyed the dishbone marrow - yumsummer squash - yes to thisoctopus - very goodI would come back to try the pig head!,2,,
9,Dani D.,"Queens, NY",0,4,9,5.0,10/30/2018,"A phenomenal day drinking spot, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and music. I recommend getting the cheese and ham board if you're coming here with friends for an evening drink !",,,
10,Sewon Y.,"Manhattan, NY",88,8,1,1.0,11/9/2018,This restaurant is way too overrated. The foods were not enough and taste mediocre. But the resale problem is the price. They should recognize that hey are not fine dining restaurant. How come the freakin pork barbecue and 2 glasses of beer costs $120 per person ? That's the equivalent to very nice omakase at Tanoshi sushi. Really bad experience and would never recommend to anyone who asks me about the place. Unless they have money to waste.,,,
11,Eric C.,"San Francisco, CA",148,48,97,1.0,5/20/2018,"Not sure how this place has 4 stars on yelp. We came in on a Saturday around 7 and the place was half empty. We were told that the only available seating was at the bar even though there were plenty of open tables. We were ok with that given the good reviews for the food. Ordered the beef tartare, burger and duck. Food took almost an hour to come out even though the place was empty. Both main dishes were cold as if they were sitting in the back the whole time. Burger was over-salted and dry in the middle. Total came out to over 150 including a drink per person. Unbelievably overpriced for extremely mediocre food. Would not recommend",1,2,
12,Damien K.,"Westborough, MA",91,75,112,5.0,8/10/2018,"I have been here a few times for lunch as they are situated very close to the NYC office I go into.  Given how great my meals have been, I am always surprised when I come into lunch it is always quiet and fairly empty (granted I have never been here at dinner, I assume it is suddenly the opposite).Both times I have had extremely friendly and knowledgeable bartenders who have taken care of me when I have been in there.  Since it is usually quiet much of the time is focused on eating and conversing with them, so additional points on having nice people working there.The showcase of the Cannibal is the meats.  On my last lunch there I went with the cannibal dogs 2.0.  I eat many hot dogs, so I am always interested to see where places try and take them to gourmet.  Cannibal delivered on how to do this.  Clearly the dogs themselves are a high  quality meat.  Paired with their fresh made chili and topped with scallions, cilantro, crispy shallots, and spicy mustard.  It is a very elevated Coney Island style dog.  You get a pair and has a slight amount of kick to it, but nothing that will make you slow down from devouring them.",1,,
13,JiHae L.,"Sunnyside, NY",111,168,572,3.0,4/13/2018,"I give this place 3 stars since the liquor house hardly had liquor?? I sat at the bar and ordered from their menu. I ordered something and they didn't have the mix or liquor. Which is very strange. They should just take it off their menu or cross it off temporarily. For food I ordered the everything pretzel with scallion and chive dipping sauce, which was tasty. Anyways, the service was good which is why this place still gets 3 stars. But it seemed that the bartenders were giving alcohol to their waitstaff to drink. I'm like interesting, i know service is slow, but very unprofessional. So I checked into the place and I got a free shot. They honored it even though it says between certain hours. INot sure if I'll go back to this place. However, I'll check out the sister restaurant which is connected by a doorway.",1,1,
14,Johnson L.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,116,2,3.0,8/16/2018,"Came here twice, once a year or so ago with my roommates and don't remember anything which not necessarily bad since my memory is crap these days.Came here again recently on a random date and were seated to some really loud obnoxious frat bros but we persevered and they left.  For whatever reason, I wasn't too hungry we ordered the octopus appetizer, one of the three versions of ham, bone marrow, and spicy asparagus.  Octopus was solid but serving size was a bit small.  Ham came in generous portions but not enough bread to go with it.  Bone marrow was a bit underwhelming and overpriced for what you got.  Service started out great, the server was super attenative and had great suggestions for my sour beer pallet.  Then we got ghosted and never saw him for the rest of the night and had to flag down a random server to close out.  On one hand I didn't get any of their signature dishes but on the other hand, I don't have a compelling reason to come back.",,,
15,Clint H.,"Brooklyn, NY",338,465,45,4.0,3/20/2018,"So my friend Vinnie loves to EAT WELL. It's his thing. Im pretty sure I've talked about him on Yelp before, and every single situation has been us going to a restaurant and eating a lot of food. Heading to Cannibal this past weekend was no different, considering the fact that we came here specifically for their Lamb roast dinner.That's right folks, they do an entire lamb. and You can eat pretty much everything from the snout to tail. I've done a lot of ""entire animal"" meals in my day but this was a my first lamb attempt. I've done my fair share of pig roasts so I brought my eating pants and me and 13 of my friends sat down for a celebration dinner for my other friend getting married. What I can say about this particular situation is this: I honestly thought we would have had more food. Weird right? When you're accustom to eating a lot like I am, i thought there would have been more lamb than there was. Maybe it's because we had 14 people instead of say, 12, or 11? At the end of our very yummy lamb meal I asked ""hey is there anymore lamb left?"" and there really wasn't much but scraps. Fair enough. Well done team!They serve the lamb with really yummy hummus, fresh pita, these really good cauliflower as well as brussel sprouts, and some well seasoned peppers. I had a couple of drinks, one was a Manhattan and the other was one of their whisky drinks that was off their menu. The Manhattan was solid and the specialty cocktail was alright. I had that one first and decided to switch to the Manhattan instead. The other thing I wasn't the hugest fan of, was the price. I mean, I was expecting it to be pricey for an entire lamb, but this was more expensive than the pig roast at the Breslin, which is AMAZING, and a TON of food. Maybe it's because lamb is more expensive than suckling pig? Is that even true? I'm not even sure if that's true but it has to be, because our total price was more than I thought. One thing about this place though, is they do a half cow feast as well. Maybe I should come back for that? That seems like it will maybe be enough food for me?!",1,1,
16,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",395,4085,7998,3.0,6/24/2018,"Despite its meaty name, the Cannibal actually has a decent array of non-beefy offerings like gnocchi, tuna tartare, and grilled octopus. Whether at lunch or at dinner, if you're scared off by some of the pricier dishes on the menu, there is still a good number of modestly priced and modestly sized dishes that should fill your appetite. But if you're in a group, however, then the ""large format"" dishes - like the Hudson Valley duck and the General Tso's pig's head - can be quite the conversation starter and a good way to bond over a super-savory meal. Their beer and wine selection is compact but decent too. Overall, this is a fairly compact venue that can get pretty tightly packed when it's busy. If you can snag a seat or, better yet, make reservations, then be prepared for a savory, meaty good time.",8,2,7
17,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,3.0,2/3/2018,"I came here with my boyfriend Friday for date night. When I showed up around 7, they seated me immediately even though he wasn't with me. It was pretty busy. The decor looks nice; the bar is the center of the action, with some impressive taps (looks like they dispense liquor, not beer, from some of them). Much of the seating is stools or high-tops, so feels more casual.I went for the Reposado Aviation ($14), which was my kind of drink-- tequila and strong. I think they needed to adjust the recipe a little bit because the reposado overwhelms the other components and it doesn't quite taste like an Aviation. It's also shaken a bit too hard as there were tons of ice shards. His New York Sour ($14) was similarly tasty but also had technical problems-- the red wine float was all sunken to the bottom.We decided to split 4 dishes, which was light to just right portion-wise. The chicken liver pate ($13) and beef tartare ($19?) came out first. The pate was solid, though the orange jam on top was too tart and didn't do it any favors. The beef tartare had a powdered egg topping, which was interesting, but the tartare was shot through with jalapeno seeds and was borderline inedibly spicy. The beef wasn't too tender anyway.Second up were the confit chicken wings ($16?) and mustard greens and beet salad ($14?). The wings were fine, a little skimpy but decent flavor from the buffalo sauce. The salad was decent, and I liked the way they put the goat cheese on the slices of beets together. Nothing remarkable.Service was good-- cheerful and attentive. The atmosphere was nice. The pacing was fine; ran about an hour. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to my expectations, and not to the price. We paid $55 each after tax and tip (though to be fair, without drinks it would have been $40ish each, which is not insane for NYC), which for me is a pricy date night. Do note that the menu for both drinks and food is entirely different than what is listed on their website.",5,1,1
18,Pamela G.,"New York, NY",1,33,22,4.0,10/6/2018,"A solid 3 1/2 stars. This review is for the butcher bar and not the restaurant which is completely separate. Burger was great, and the sausage (I think it was the kielbasa) was ok but not satisfying as a meal and at that price.Bartender was friendly. Plenty of beer choices, many you won't recognize, and you help yourself from the coolers though the bartender opens them for you.The space is very narrow. I went on a hot day and it was surprisingly uncomfortably warm inside. I'd give it another try, or their restaurant next door which is much bigger.",,,
19,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2209,8239,2.0,12/4/2017,"Really had a disappointing experience here. The food was okay, but service was very slow and inconsistent (things forgotten, coming out at different times, etc.)I don't think anyone was malicious here but there is no communication between management and staff here.  There was a major issue with our bill, on which I sought clarification multiple times because I knew it was wrong but the server said it was fine, so my friends and left what we thought it should be (like a couple of hundred dollars more) only to be chased out of the restaurant by the manager like we were criminals.    The cheeseburger I had was good, but the humiliating experience I had being treated like a criminal was really one of the most embarassing moments of my life.   For $80, I had four beers and a cheeseburger over 3 hours.  Not worth the time or money in my opinion.  I'm not discouraging anyone else from eating here, but I can safely say that I'd never set foot in this establishment again.",19,7,8
20,Kiersten G.,"New York, NY",381,183,139,3.0,12/17/2017,"Great selection of meats. Large entrees with shareable sides. Expect $30+ per person with drinks. The chicken is a must-try!!! Also, the potatoes were unreal. We did not care for the country pate. Great selection of craft beers, but only 7 on draft.A huge downfall is we had a disrespectful, horrible server. Honestly, he ruined the night for us. It's all we could talk about. One of SEVERAL examples... We asked if two people could be put on their own check because they had to leave early and the server replied, ""how about I do one check and you can be adults and figure it out?"" It got so bad we had to ask for a different server. I don't recommend coming here with clients, a date, etc. because if you get this service it would be an embarrassment. Our second server was extremely apologetic and polite. However, service like this is never expected for 30+ per plate. The staff needs some work, but the food is excellent.",3,,
21,Cathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",514,86,171,5.0,6/18/2018,Great beer selection. Went in for pork rinds (which are harder to find than you would think) and interacted with the nicest bartender (on a busy World Cup day no less) ever and will definitely go back. Seems like sort of a hidden spot. There was semi-dark lighting. It was quiet enough. Definitely a gem of a tucked away little spot on a Saturday afternoon.,1,,
22,N F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,1,5.0,11/3/2018,"Great cocktails (try the ""naked + famous"" for a nice mezcal cocktail), GENERAL TSO'S pig head  and possibly the best bone marrow I've ever had.

23,Kayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",54,136,108,4.0,2/8/2018,"Came for beers only. The beer selection is very vast and creative. The pilsner I originally picked from South Korea was out of stock, so the bartender (Max) recommended a German brew of the same quality and it didnt disappoint.Very tight, cozy space altogether. The bar area can get a little tight if all the seats are filled. The food menu wasn't what I was particularly in the mood for at the time, but it may be worth a try another night. Service and crowd wasnt bad. I'll return.",,,

25,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,2.0,5/15/2018,"I didn't leave Cannibal Beer & Butcher mad, but I left disappointed. The overall experience to me was barely mediocre, and the super high prices just made that worse.Got a reservation here for a weeknight, the weather was mild so when the host asked us if we wanted to sit outside instead of the dining area we said sure. Turns out the outside area is all long benches, and we sat with another group of 6...not the biggest deal breaker but the benches were pretty uncomfortable and every time someone moved, the whole bench would move, which lead to a slightly uncomfortable seating situation that I would have appreciated being warned about before opting to go outside over the dining area. The waiter was nice, but throughout the night it became harder to flag him down for things (I think he had tables inside as well and we just lost track of him). For my meal I got the burger, and my friend got the flank steak. It was fine overall, no actual complaints other than my burger came out a solid medium rare when I ordered medium. What was frustrating was that nothing about either of our dishes warranted the ludicrous prices, and it took a long time for them to come out. After we finished, it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come to the outdoor section again so we could ask for our check, and awkwardly enough it turned out he was coming out to tell everyone in the outside area that they had to close the outside at 10 (20 minutes), and if we wanted to continue our dinners inside we could do so....very weird and uncomfortable for such a seemingly high end restaurant?????One thing they have certainly mastered here is giving off that Brooklyn backyard vibe, but in my opinion the vibe doesn't warrant the prices or the mediocre service. Based on my experience I wouldn't recommend this place unless you were in a pinch, or if someone else was paying!",3,2,
26,Matteo R.,"Brooklyn, NY",688,691,3016,5.0,10/23/2017,"Love the concept: a local butcher's restaurant with an amazing beer selection.Very easy going atmosphere, with a nice bar, a butcher counter, tables, and a beautiful covered yard with communal tables and benches and a cobbled floor. You almost feel like you're in a country village in southern France!Added bonus: on this side of Kips Bay there isn't too much traffic, so finding a spot in one of the communal tables and benches in the yard at the back at 7pm on a Sunday was very easy.Pretty amazing beer selection, with a few, well curated taps, and lots and lots of bottles. The Grimm Kinetic Cloud Sour Ale ($11/10oz), and the Peekskill Double Standard Imperial IPA ($11/10oz) were the two beers I had on tap, and the Alken-Maes Grimbergen Belgian Blonde Ale ($8) the one I had in a bottle. If you like beers[1], you'll love The cannibal.You can certainly make a dinner out of the small plates and charcuterie dishes, which are tasty and fun to share alongside a tasty brew. The beef and oyster tartare was as delicious as it sounds, and the grated smoked egg adds an extra sparkle to the dish that enhances the flavor of the beef and the oyster. The country patè with pickled mustard seeds backed a lot of flavor. My favorite dish was the lab heart tartare with yogurt, cilantro, and lavash. This dish is not for everybody, but I love lamb, and this dish had it all: flavors, complexity, texture.Looking forward to coming back and try the Generat Tso pig head!---------------------[1] And don't mind the prices!",8,3,8
27,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",907,317,518,5.0,12/8/2017,"A carnivore's wet dream. Cannibal has giant slabs of so many kinds of meat, prepared and seasoned in the most ideal way. From the hot dogs with speciality toppings that extend far past their buns to the charcuterie board, if you like red meat you will find something for your taste. I usually am not a pork fan, but the pork chop was perfection. Tender, flavorful, topped with fresh peppers and grilled lime on the side, every bite was a delight. The moist beans and rice and with a sunny side up fried egg was the perfect combination. Dishes do take awhile to make - we waited over an hour - but believe it or not it was worth it.",1,,
28,Mandee P.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,186,5.0,11/5/2017,"I've been eyeing this place for quite some time, and finally visiting yesterday, it did not let me down. I was planning a surprise Birthday Brunch for my husband so I worked with Ilissa to organize. It was for 8 people. Ilissa was great and prepared a package that included food for the table: country ham boards, everything pretzels, bread, and avocado toast. Then each person chose an entree, then there was 1 round of cocktails, unlimited coffee and juice. This package averaged at $48 pp. Thats including ALL CHARGES, tax and what I believe was a 22% tip. So the price was great. We didn't expect so much ""food for the table."" They didn't skimp! There was more than enough for each person and it was delicious!!! Avocado toast was one of my favorites. I'm still raving about it. There were leftovers and I ate one for dinner later that night. Still good! The everything pretzels were hot from the oven paired with cream cheese. Each guest kept raving about the cream cheese!!! Probably the best cream cheese we've had. Do you guys sell that to go because I think you'd have all of us as costumers? HahaFunny thing is, all but 1 person ordered the stack burger. We were in that type of mood. It was pretty good. Some people loved it, I thought it was good but the cheese was a bit salty. That's all according to taste though! That's a me thing and the burger was still quite good. The aioli had a Smokey flavor which I enjoyed. The service was phenomenal. So attentive! Not to mention that the staff was in on the surprise and did a wonderful job with it. I can't wait to go back and try more food. 5 stars on all accounts! Thanks so much everyone for making this a special day. Oh and loveeee the decor and look of the place and the outdoor patio. Can't forget that! It was very well heated so we couldn't even tell we were outside in a cold day.",2,,1
29,Jenny F.,"Woodside, CA",405,98,206,2.0,5/22/2018,"My review is based on my experience with a large party only.So one of my really good friends hosted a post-wedding reception/celebration here recently. The reservation was made over a month well in advance for ~23 people.Pros:The food and presentation. We had a whole roast suckling pig which was cooked to pure perfection - was moist, tender, and flavorful. The bread came without butter, but when we requested some butter, it was brought on a warm plate - ingenious. The charcuterie platter was delicious.Downsides which sadly is the reason for the poor rating:The entire party was split into 2 tables - one with 15 people, the other table with 8. While this itself isn't an issue, we had one server for the entire group.He was very friendly, had some good conversation with us about SSBDs with fun prints (short-sleeve button-down shirts, I recently learned is a thing). He repeatedly assured us that he'd take good care of us, anything we need just ask.Problem is, while his words were really awesome and comforting, the actions sadly did not quite follow through. To his credit, I think he was tremendously overwhelmed with our group size. While our meal service was prix fixe, our drink orders were not. The poor fellow didn't take any notes of our 23 drink orders, which meant a lot of orders were forgotten. My husband had to ask for his Manhattan (hey, we're in NY!) 3 times before it was brought to him, nearly 30 min later. Other people also found themselves in a similar situation.For me, I was really disappointed with his demeanor. I am partly allergic to alcohol, and am trying to start a family, so I inquired if they could make me a nonalcoholic cocktail - a mocktail. Specifically a fauxjito. He sounded amused/stunned, as if who comes to a place called Beer and Butcher and doesn't order alcohol? He then said that he doesn't think the bar can make one, but will check. I never heard back about my drink. Given he was already so overwhelmed by our group's drink orders, I decided to not press the issue.Problem is, after dinner everyone started ordering rounds of espresso. There seemed to be some confusion between a single vs. double espresso. My husband asked for a double espresso. Server responded with ""so two espressos"". My husband clarified, a double please. Server seems annoyed and says ""so two. You want two."" Then the espresso (thankfully a double) came and had chunks of coffee grinds in it. Another friend's espresso was cold, which was confirmed by a second friend who tasted it. And well, me, I ordered a hot tea. Again, he looks at me like I'm an alien, who orders tea after a meal, in New York of all places? He says, yeah, sure, I'll look into it. And just like my fauxjito, I never see or hear the likes of my drink order again.And then for the few folks who did get their drinks, the waiter then proceeded to clear the table, including a clearly half-drunk unfinished glass. We had to ask for it back.Drinks aside, let's move onto the the meal service.Like I mentioned prior, the roast pig was really well cooked. It came with 4 sauces - I believe their house BBQ sauce, hoisin, olive oil, and some kind of herbed one. Problem is, they gave one set of sauces for the entire table of 15 people, which meant we had to constantly pass the heavy tray back and forth a long table all night. We asked the staff (twice) for a second or event third sauce tray to share, like other instances was promised they'd take good care of us, anything we need just ask, but never saw results. Over dessert, same thing, one tray of dessert (while quite delicious and made well) to share between all 15 of us at a long narrow table. Lots of passing around again.Finally, the most awful thing about the entire experience might have to be the bathrooms. There are no sanitation toilet seat covers. While I don't find this to be upsetting, a lot of women do not enjoy sitting on the bare toilet seat. This means you will find a lot of folks doing the unfortunately very inaccurate aimed squat pee, leaving a tremendous mess on the toilet seat and on the floor. What's worse is, now that there's a puddle on the floor, no one wants to step in it, so the the squat gets further and further, and the aim gets worse and worse. By the end of the night, I walked in finding myself wiping down the toilet seat, folding toilet paper over it, and sitting with my shoes in a number of people's urine. Just abhorrently awful way to end an already disappointing night. Please please please consider adding toilet seat covers for your bathrooms, it'll make it less awful for your staff to clean up after all of us, and it'll be really less gross for your clientele too.Overall, staff are friendly but highly unreliable. Food is excellent. Facilities are gross. I don't think this is any deal-breaker that cannot be easily improved upon, but for me, I will not be a repeat customer until things are better, it was quite disappointing.",1,,

Updated review","Updated review! After coming to their sister establishment (Cannibal Liquor House) and having a less than quality experience, I took to Yelp. The manager quickly reached out and explained that my experience was unacceptable and not a representation of their establishment and asked me to return for another meal. My boyfriend and I accepted and came to the Butcher & Beer and man was it a great experience. Our waiter Chris was super friendly and made some great suggestions. The beer selection is HUGE! Wowza! We got the beef and oyster tartare with smoked egg yolk, chicken pate with orange marmalade and fennel pollen, the spatchcock chicken with lemon butter and herbs, and sides of fried oyster mushrooms and Brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds. It was all so flavorful and great! So happy with our choices. And ending with the cookies and bourbon milk was just terrific. This meal was top notch! I complete 180 from my first time. Thanks for recognizing and correcting. Really lovely!",1,,1
32,Peter C.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,110,110,4.0,4/16/2018,"Great place for a group dinner, that will definitely spark talking points across the table!Cannibal Beer & Butcher has a great atmosphere and an extremely homely feel to it - the staff are also extremely welcoming, attentive, and up for as much of a laugh and interaction as you are.Came here on a Tuesday for a work dinner with a group of guys, and the fact the staff even put up with us is testament to them.Food wise this place everything you'd expect from a place called Cannibal Beer (no, not human) and Butcher (but yes, all the meats). I won't go into too much detail on what we had, because quite frankly, if it was on the menu, we had it, and all of it was extremely enjoyable.There was one particular show stopper of the night, and that was the pigs head - I'm sure the majority of people will be skeptical about this, but this is an absolute must for all roast pork and meat lovers a like. It's served with General Tsao sauce, and with pancakes. The skin is extremely crispy and the meat below is super tender and literally melts in your mouth - it'll set you back around $85 but this is easily enough for 4 to share if you pad it out with some sides.Great experience and a great, unique place!",1,1,

When I read these guys won the Timeout Hamburger challenge, I knew there'd be beer & butchering in my future.I walk into an empty restaurant. We sit at the bar and I see this place is set up for Beer & Butchery. It's a pretty deceiving space, there's a garden area with tables out back as well as larger dining room. I can see this place being packed on the weekends. Lets get the good stuff out of the way. The Cannibal Beer & Butcher won the Timeout People choice award for the stacked burger. Made with Cabot cheddar cheese, house cured bacon and a special Pat La Frieda meat blend. I was salivating thinking about eating this burger.To start I see Cheesy Pork Rinds? Yes please. Let get that pork party started. I would have enjoyed just the Pork Rinds, the cheese dusting made it a little weird but still enjoyable.My burger comes out, man is this a thing of beauty. Its a two all beef patty, special.. err sorry. Its two patties of sexy meat, cheese and house cured bacon. All wrapped up on a dope, homemade bun. Winner! This burger made my Best I Ever Ate Burger list. You have to get this burger!Now that I have the burger out of the way, I have to try the Charcuterie dishes. I was able to snag a jar of their blanched peanuts. Mmmmm mm!The Cannibal Beer & Butcher - Free after dinner Amaro shot with a Yelp check in.",13,8,14
34,Eileen T.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",29,2,1,1.0,5/6/2018,"Would not come back again. We were there Sunday morning, maybe it was still too early in the day but the restaurant seemed understaffed.  There was one waiter who did all the running around, taking orders, serving food and cleaning. While another (who seemed like the manager?) she was busy in the corner talking to a friend. We sat at the bar and seemed like no one was able to take our order, so I had to walk up to her and ask if she could take down our order. I got two small side dishes while my husband got the Cuban sandwich. She brought us the food I was highly disappointed. I ordered a side of sausage and when it arrived it was 5 slices of sausages, for $6?! When I asked the women what makes this side dish $6 she just shrugged her shoulders and told me that that was the side dish I asked for and then walked away! POOR SERVICE. My husband got the sandwich and noticed that the couple sitting next to us order the same Cuban sandwich but had a side of chips! VERY INCONSISTENT. My husband asked the other waiter why his sandwich didn't come with chips and the waiter (the one running around and manning most of the table) looked truly apologetic and was quick to try to right the wrong. In the end, we left him the tip but I will never go back in there again.",1,,
35,Gereon S.,"Cologne, Germany",0,4,2,5.0,8/5/2018,"What can you say about Cannibal that hasn't already been said before: literally the best usage of meat cuts you'll find anywhere. The craft beer and wine selection accompanying the food was ridiculously tasty, the waiter competent, quick, and charming.The octopus and the Hot Dog were stupidly tasty - classic examples of when the dish turns into more than the individual sum of its parts. And then ... they served the bone marrow. The tasty, tender, flavourful cut of love. Once they pour down the whiskey through your bone, you know your heart was lost. Tasty to the point of me losing my mind. Some downside was the pigs ear salad - had we skipped that, we could have had more of the other food. 6/5 will be here again.",1,,
36,Craig Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,589,22,2.0,5/15/2018,"I love the pig head, but otherwise, I am almost always disappointed here. I have been twice in the last year and a bunch of times over the years. I'm not sure what was a bigger let down last night, the service, or the pitiful beer selection. There were literally no Northeast IPAs. None on draft, none by the bottle. They weren't many IPAs of any kind actually, and nothing special. I mean, ballast point sculpin was like the most exotic one. For the record, I have had better beer experiences there, but it has never been consistent.Also, I literally spoke to four different people there before I could get a recommendation on a beer. The bartender didn't even know what a Northeast IPA was. Bear in mind, this is a beer place! Finally, the prices were outrageous: $15 for St. Bernardus apt 12 and like nine dollars for elysian.Service sucked all the way around... well, actually, the big guy who cleared our table was great. My friend who ordered a $17 bottle of beer could never get a glass for it. We had to ask three people for more water, and I had to take a fork off another table because our shared dishes didn't come with utensils.The waitress was selling us way too hard to get more food at every turn. Every question we asked the answer was ""get both"". It was almost comical. And her recommendations were terrible: along with the pigs head, she recommended a charcuterie board, sausage, and two orders of fries. They have good vegetable dishes, I'm not sure why she thought we needed three heavy meat dishes and potatoes cooked in three animal fats.We didn't love any of the other things we ordered. The animal fries were a huge disappointment. The pig ear salad was also. Pigs in a blanket were good. The smoke carrots had promised, and a great sauce, but were too big to be cooked that way - - charred on the outside under cooked on the inside.When the bill came, wouldn't you know it, it was wrong. There was a $65 bottle of something that we didn't order. The waitress was initially incredulous that there was an error.Dessert took literally 25 minutes. They comped them without us saying anything, so that was nice and appreciated; too bad things couldn't have just gone more smoothly though.",,,

Updated review","I'm sorry to say this but The Cannibal really doesn't have it's brunch game together. I came here on a Sunday morning and was ignored by the two people on staff.I ordered the Fisherman's Breakfast, which was supposed to come with a trout rilllette, smoked salmon, shrimp, pickled salad and sourdough bread. When the dish came out, there was no shrimp. I then asked where the shrimp was, and they said they were out and could replace it with more smoked salmon. I would have expected the waiter to come back and ask if the substitution was ok before just going through with my order.Just don't come here for brunch. Terrible service.",,,

39,Rucha D.,"Brooklyn, NY",428,174,211,5.0,9/12/2017,"Everything about this place is pure craft. Beer, food, snacks, and even the walls. Everything is decorated uniquely, and the hanging bikes in the back seating area add to the fun atmosphere. You can't go wrong here beer-wise, as their menu is curated quite well. Happy hour is fantastic (from 4-6), and the food is honestly even better. The theme here is meats, and lots of them. But the dishes are just as creative as the space.A friend and I came for happy hour on a weekday, and requested a seat in the back (ideal compared to sitting at the bar inside). I had a Goose Island saison (Sofie) at the time. Since I am a sucker for warm pretzels and apps, we shared their:-- Everything Pretzel ($7), which is served with a scallion cream cheese. Combining two of my favorite things together? Yes please.-- Cured Pig Face, their house special appetizer at the time ($12?); it was topped with arugula and this really grainy, mild mustard. Unexpected deliciousness.I know I have to come back here again for lunch, dinner, and brunch. It must be done. And I shall report back.",1,,1
40,Archana W.,"New York, NY",493,83,59,3.0,3/25/2018,"The steak was not warm, but the seasoning was good. The oil that it was sitting in was great but I needed more salt and pepper, it just lacked overall flavor. I got medium and it was cooked well, it did not have a rubbery taste - a good chew but idk the flavor was lacking. We also got the salami board which was very good! I would recommend trying that. The fries, bread, and pretzel were good but I would be shocked if they messed that up! I think for a night out for meat and beer it's a place to consider but not my first pick. Also definitely not a place if you don't eat red meat. Keep in mind though, I hear their brunch is A LOT better! This was dinner so maybe that was just our bad luck! Try brunch out before dinner in my opinion.",1,,
41,Melanie Z.,"New York, NY",6,117,0,2.0,9/13/2018,"TLDR: food is average and not worth the money.  People are nice but some shady practices going on.  I WONT be back.We were a group of 6 who were looking for a table with no wait in the area.  We tried a couple other places but all booked up because we were last minute.   This place sounded great because it had a lot of open tables, but in retrospect that's usually a bad sign.The pros:- Hostess was really friendly - Cheese and meat plate (the tour) was tasty- Wings were good- They didn't give us trouble for splitting the $400+ check over 6 credit cards.  Usually I wouldn't even ask to do that but after the fiasco of dinner, I felt emboldened.The cons:- Overall the food was average.  The ribeye was under seasoned. The tomatoes in the panzanella weren't ripe.  The octopus was a bit over charred.- Too expensive for what it is.  Nothing stood out to us as delicious.  A $150 ribeye that was sold to us as 37 ounces did NOT seem like 37 ounces.  Even factoring in shrinkage during cooking and the bone, it seemed like a reach.  Normally I wouldn't think twice about it but there were other things that made me suspicious like....- My friend ordered a second beer but the keg had kicked so the server gave him a half glass and said he wouldn't charge for it.  Then when the bill came, it was charged.  No big deal, we let him know and he gladly took it off.  But then...- We wanted to order one of the $33 charcuterie platters, but the server told us ""actually I would recommend the small tour platter because it's only $10 more and comes with cheese and pate and other stuff.""  We said great!  But when the bill came, it was charged as a large tour platter and was $85.  I brought it up but the server feigned ignorance.  I thought I was crazy, but after he walked away, everyone else at my table said ""yeah we def ordered the small because he told us it was only $10 more.""- The server described three dessert for us: a cookie plate, macaroons, and a peanut butter cheesecake.  We opted for the macaroons but a cookie plate appeared.  We said ""oh we actually ordered the macaroons"" and the server said ""well three of these cookies are made from macaroons.""  So we accepted the cookies.  They were 100% NOT macaroons in any form.  It was like chocolate, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter cookies.  And they weren't even good!  Crumbly instead of chewy, room temperature instead of warm.  Big bummer and we felt like they just lied to our faces.Just one of these things wouldn't be a deal breaker, but in combination we really felt like they were trying to cheat us.  The food just wasn't good enough to make me overlook this so I definitely won't be back.",3,,1

I was surprised at how empty it felt for a Wednesday evening, but the atmosphere was very cute - it had two different rooms and an outdoor space. We got seated in the outdoor area that seemed to be the most packed. Our waiter was really attentive and nice.We shared Chicken Wings, Crispy Pig Ear Salad and Beef Tartare. The beef tartare was very tasty - the bread was perfectly buttered and toasted and the tartare wasn't over-flavored so you can actually taste the meat. However, the salad and the chicken wings were pretty disappointing. The salad wasn't especially tasty and the fried chicken was extremely salty. Other items on the menu might be better, but I wouldn't recommend the salad or chicken wings.I wouldn't go back for food, but I could see myself stopping by for drinks if I was in the area.",,,

46,Gill S.,"Dallas, TX",59,700,29,4.0,7/10/2018,"The pigs head Cuban felt like an engineer made it. The sandwich had so much symmetry and precision that it felt like the sandwich of the future. The bread was evenly crisp and flattened evenly. The amount of ham, pig head meat, and cheese was even with every bite. The sandwich had a good amount of meat without being too much or too little. The only complaint I have is the lack of charisma in the meats. Everything was so well executed, that there were no moments where the gamy flavor or grease popped. The pig heads meat was moist but I wish it were just a little more moist. Otherwise, it was a good sandwich. The chips they provide were thin yet crispy.

52,Ben W.,"New York, NY",514,772,435,5.0,11/3/2017,"Hands down, one of the best burgers in NYC.My bf agrees and he's an expert haha. I originally stopped by a few months ago for a Yelp Elite event and the burgers left an impression. They were well made, properly seasoned, and so juicy. I have been meaning to take the bf for a while. Friday night was not as crowded as I had feared, and we were able to get a table quickly. Towards the end of our meal, the place was packed. We opted for the onion rings, the stacked burger, and their special for October, a collaboration with Jeff Mahin from Stella Barra Pizzeria. The meal was off to an okay start as the onion rings were just okay. I thought there was too much breading, not enough onion, and not the bigger portion. The aioli though was a great compliment. The real showstoppers however were the burgers. Their stacked burger I would consider a classic benchmark for newcomers. The two patty tower with cheddar, bacon, and aioli make it a sight to be seen, and so so tasty. The collaboration burger though, just wow. When it first arrived, it appeared to be a little smaller than the stacked, but it could not have been more filling. Even if you're not a fan of breakfast for dinner, the flavors, the juiciness (which proceeded to drip down my hand), the textures, all-in-all, it was one of our favorite burgers ever. Warning: this thing is a MESS. The english muffin quickly fell apart and we resorted to a fork and knife for the second half. I would come back just to have that burger again.For dessert, Christian surprised us with hush puppies and cookies and milk. The meal had already been so heavy that I couldn't enjoy the hush puppies as much as I would've liked, but the dipping sauce and piping hot dough were so yummy. The bourbon milk served with the giant cookie was also delicious; we wished it could become a cocktail served at the bar.If you want a good burger with a chill atmosphere, Cannibal's your place. The table next to us ordered the whole roast pig, which looked really really fun. I'd recommend checking it out if you had a larger group and wanted to try something new.",1,,

Unfortunately, they discontinued the egg part, even though it's still listed on the menu. Very much hoping they can get that part together again.

Caveat Emptor! Let me try to change your mind by sharing with you 4 restaurant sins that were committed during my dining experience.1. They ran out of bone marrow at 6pm on a Saturday with no one in the restaurant. Oh did you travel all the way to NYC to try their bone marrow shots? Better luck next! How do you run out of your signature thing during prime time? That's just poor restaurant management and planning. Irresponsible. 2. Ordered a medium rare steak and they wayyy overcooked it to like a medium well. For a restaurant whose named cannibal you would think they know how to prepare and cook their meat. Amateur3. We ordered a half tour(half of their chef selection charcuterie plate) and when the bill came they charged us a half tour and a grand tour. I guess their only way to make a buck is to slip in extra charges unto drunk people's bills. Sad4. 2 hour and 15 minutes into our meal (which had a reservation) they wanted to kick us out to open the table. How you going to kick us out when it took 1.5 hours for you to actually bring out a properly cooked piece of steak? Like how dare you treat customers like this. ShameTerrible experience.

It wasn't even that expensive as many so called artisanal places might be.  It did have a few more pricey options that I may delve into next time knowing the quality of their signature offering.Everything from the décor right down to the awesome old school rap playlist that was lightly coursing through the sound system make me want to go back.  Highly recommended",1,,1

This is pretty expensive but if it tasted great, the price could be justified.Lo and behold, the burger was double patties. This explains the ""stacked"" part. The burger also came with bacon. Overall the burger was delicious and well worth the price. Although our server didn't ask how we wanted the burger cooked, it still ended up coming out medium rare. Only thing is sometimes our server wouldn't come back to us for 15-20 min at a time. I would understand if it was busy but it wasn't at the time.

Clearing wine glasses when we we just ordered another bottle. At one point another random person from another party threw up on the floor and our sever had the audacity to ask if it was someone from our party who threw up all over their floor. Wth. Food was just okay. We got the whole pig. Pre-set menu. There were large amounts of pork of course but otherwise they gave minimal appetizers and side dishes to eat with the pork. People from our party later told us that the restaurant has better a la carte options than what we ordered,4,2,1
62,James G.,"New York, NY",22,128,182,5.0,2/26/2017,"Everything I ate here was the best if not one of the best I've ever had. As you would expect from a beer spot, the menu had a diverse range of beers. Diverse but not extensive on tap - if you only like a particular style, unlikely you will have a choice. So I had the one IPA, which was good to be fair. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and could explain the beers in detail. There was also an extensive range (multiple options) of ciders, which was good for my wife. We went for lunch on Saturday and the menu includes snacks, salads and mains. My wife went the chicken sando and I went for the Cannibal dogs. I can't resist pretzels, especially with beer, so I had to go for the everything pretzels - I am not exaggerating when I say it's the best I've had. The Cannibal dogs were also great and one of the best chilli dogs I've had - nice quality bun, sausage and chill - and I do like coriander (cilantro). We ended up sharing a cheesecake and I'm glad we shared it as it was sizeable. The server advised it would be light and fluffy and it certainly would - again, one of the bestThe venue is a bit like 3 in one and there is limited seating - if anything, this is what lets the place down. At first it's like you're in the beer section of a grocery store, then you're in a bar, then you're in a beer garden. Each is adequately decorated but I'm just not sure there is enough space at the back for the beer garden layout. Half was being taken up by a beer tasting course, which left just two tables. On the whole, I can get past this niggle based on the quality of the food and the service",1,,1
63,Amy P.,"Granby, CT",18,11,10,2.0,8/5/2018,"I was excited to try this restaurant, I researched, I looked at reviews , pictures, locations etc... I chose this restaurant I didnt stumble upon it. I made reservations. Upon arriving there were only 7 other diners on a Saturday at 7:30 pm. We were promplty seated and menus were given to us and water poured. Our waiter was pleasant but acted like were ok sitting without cocktails. Advertised as a ""beer"" establishment... 2 sours and 1 cider was part of the 7 beer draft options. We over heard another staff member inform another table that they could get up and look in the cooler for other canned beers. Unusual. We decide on a double IPA from brooklyn  we quickly place our full order. Bone marrow, cheese board , duck, potatoes and artichokes and the general tso pig head. My review is simple... the bone marrow was ""marrow less""... the pig was fun and tasty BUT the pancakes were dried tortillas , the pig would have been better if a accompaniment had been served to cut the grease. The side of potatoes too oily.  Ambiance were miss represented on line... its pretty inside but assumed it would be more fun as I would be attacking and being a cannibal! I  can check it off my list.... and maybe enjoy a salad at my next location.",,,
64,David N.,"Manhattan, NY",188,384,153,2.0,3/1/2018,"Tried the pate, the ribs, and kielbasa. Overall the dishes weren't very good renditions of what they are supposed to be. The pate was ok, the kielbasa was kind of crumbly, and the ribs were very dry and not tender. Also there was some odd rule about which side of the restaurant they sell the craft beers in which is arbitrary and doesn't make any sense. Given the name I'd expect the meats to be amazing.",1,,

Literally the only reason I went.We ordered our steak medium rare (the only way to eat steak), only to have it come out medium well. After sending it back, they sent out a very, very rare steak. For a restaurant supposedly known for their meats, they should at least know how to cook a steak.When our check came, we noticed that they had mistakenly added an $80 item to our bill. How does that even happen?The waitress never came to check on us or refill our water, and it wasn't very busy at the time either.2/5 stars because other than these complaints, their charcuterie and the other appetizers we ordered were excellent.",1,,

Bigger issue is they have us the bottom of the fries - only small nubs. Sort of annoying. We also got the onion rings which were awesome! A plus. They were hand battered and more like little donuts with sour cream onion dip. Problem was the service and the drinks. I had a French 75 and the cocktail wasn't stirred. They didn't come check on us once. (We would have ordered another round.) Given we were sitting at the bar, it was a little more surprising.I will be back for the food and the ambience.",,,

The drinks were good and the food was tasty for the most part. We had the beet salad (a little heavy on the onions) and the gnocchi, which was good. The reason for the  three stars is I thought the prices were way too high for the amount of food you get. The gnocchi was $19 and I swear there were about 12 gnocchi, which means over $1 for each little gnocchi. It was listed under ""small plates"" but for that price you should get more. The service was ok but my water was left empty several times even though the restaurant wasn't crowded.",,,

Instantly perked us right back up. They have several cocktails on tap for happy hour and a few food items. The best deal was the burger and a drink for $15! Got 2 draft cocktails each they were pretty strong. We also got one burger and a draft Manhattan and one of the jars (trout? it was some type of fish). The drinks and food are pretty damn good.

73,Amy E.,"South Windsor, CT",54,80,76,2.0,1/21/2018,"The service here was practically non-existent. We were sitting down for nearly 10 minutes when someone finally came over to give us water. Another 8 or so and the waiter stopped over to tell us the specials and take our drink order. We order the special veal croquets, the ham board, a cheese board, and the bone marrow. Once the food was brought out they didn't check on us once- we tried to flag down someone a few times to order another drink- but they either didn't see us or ignored us. Finally got one person and we asked if we could order another round of drinks- he said he would send the waiter over but the waiter never came! The croquets were delicious, ham and cheese boards were tasty and there was plenty of food. The bone marrow was a disappointment though. When we realized that we weren't ever going to get a second drink (since it had been 45 minutes since we had gotten our food and hadn't yet been able to get one) we flagged down two more ppl to ask for our check- again both said they would send the waiter over. He did come over, we asked for the check and it took another 10 minutes to get it! So disappointed in the service here!!!

74,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",321,658,142,5.0,12/31/2016,"Words can not describe how disappointed I was when I found out Resto was shut down.  RIP to that amazing Belgian waffle.  With that said, The Cannibal Liquor House is an absolute stunner! They have a nice space that opens up to the Cannibal next door, an incredible cocktail program,  a superb dinner menu and very friendly servers.We started off with the west coast oysters which they topped with some tart green apples. No cocktail sauce needed here!The ""Every Burger"" is the cheaper of the two burgers that they offer, but it was AWESOME! A regular seeded bun, a nice sized patty, cheese and the perfect amount of secret sauce along side a heaping portion of fries - we have a winner!  I could only imagine how much better their dry aged burger would be(almost double the price).  My wife ordered the wings, which were battered, deep fried and topped with a relish.  They don't drown their wings in a sauce like most places do.We finished our meal with a hot toddy which included a bonus slice of panettone which was finished in a pan with some butter and a booze soaked clementine(it was picked to the point that you could even eat the peel!). How can this place lose?!?!?  Most importantly, the mixologists here can play with the big boys in the lower east side.  Ask them to make you a proper whiskey sour, swizzle, a fizz, julep, etc..... they will not disappoint.Added bonus - my wife left her cell phone there, the server came running out a few minutes later and returned it to us.

77,Carlos N.,"New York, NY",52,6,2,4.0,8/8/2018,"3 and half I would say but I guess you can't do that and I believe hey deserve more than a 3. Honest review here. The place is very charming, rustic, and cozy. The staff is super friendly and our waiter was very attentive - even switched my beer because I wasn't a fan of it. This was my first time there so I'm not sure if this is always the situation but the place was unusually hot, specially given how hot it's been. Suggestion to the place, if it wasn't an AC issue, please lower the temperature. Now to the food. We got some tuna tartare for appetizer which was pretty good although fairly small. We had a side sweet corn which was also good. Now to the main entree. My friend and I shared the 35oz dry aged prime rib. The cook on it was perfect 'medium rare' the seasoning almost perfect, could've used a bit more salt. The wine sauce that came with it was just ok. I think my biggest mistake was not asking for the price since it said MP on it. I do feel like the waiters should at least tell you how much things are but maybe that's not how it goes. My honest opinion is - the steak was great as I described, but not $140 great. I would go back to try other things, but if I'm craving a steak, I believe there are far superior options in the city equally priced.",,,
78,Terry H.,"Pataskala, OH",36,13,13,1.0,4/16/2018,I went in on a Monday after work. The hostess suggested a seat at the bar. Unfortunately this is the highlight of the experience. The young lady behind the bar spent her time focusing on her friends instead of the paying customers. I watched her mix numerous drinks as she was trying to show off her skills all the while ignoring the paying customers. I ordered confit wings. During my wait she asked me twice if I wanted anything to eat. In which I reminded her I had placed an order. After 40 minutes of this behavior I asked her colleague to get the manager and my check.

83,Darren B.,"Austin, TX",356,947,2625,3.0,10/26/2016,"For a meat eater and Belgian beer lover like myself, this place is a great concept and one I could have easily loved. Unfortunately, I only liked it, but perhaps under different circumstances I would have liked it more.I came in for a small bite and a pint and I really liked the atmosphere which felt like an intimate underground butcher shop gastropub. They were playing ""Feel It All Around"" by Washed Out which set a chill mood and the host was real nice and was able to find me a seat at the bar despite it being pretty packed on a Thursday night. The seat was a little awkward though as part of the bar seating wraps around so you're actually behind the bar facing other patrons. Sometimes that can be cool you can strike up a conversation with your neighbors, but this time, the guys across from me and myself just seemed to be avoiding any eye contact with one another. I also felt a little bit like I was in the way of the bartenders being behind the bar too. I did have a good view of one of the TVs and they were playing Halloween movies, given the season.My bartender/server was pretty nice, but when I asked him for a beer recommendation, he seemed to have a hard time recommending any beer that wasn't $17+ by the glass/single serving sized bottle, even though they had many $8-$14 beers. Maybe they were amazing. They did have an impressive Belgian beer list that I would like to explore in the future. For this visit, I went with the Cerberus Belgian Tripel and it did the job. For food, I got their Al Pastor Pig Head Tostada. It was pretty small, but rich and tasty. I was a bit envious of the guys across from me who feasted on the whole pig head though they didn't seem blown away by it. Believe me, I was close enough to tell.So despite some awkwardness, a slightly over priced tostada, a bit too bro-y a vibe for me, and a server who was only hocking their pricier beers, I would return, but it would be middle of the pack rather than a top destination.",10,4,6
84,Hyesil C.,"New York, NY",341,122,162,3.0,6/20/2017,"3.5 STARS.My bf and I went on a Thursday night without reservations and was able to score a table in the back area. The back has a beer garden feel and is a lot more open then the bar seating inside. We were however moved in the middle of our meal because our table had to be taken by a reservation. We went ahead a ordered the kielbasa sausage and the hot dogs to start, and then ordered the infamous pig head with a side of fries. The kielbasa sausage was small and average- nothing special in my opinion. The hot dogs were delicious! The hot dog itself is just a long typical bbq hot dog but the chili and the condiments on top all really worked well together. We then got our pig head which was a disappointment. Also it indeed, like the other yelpers say, covered in the sauce. However, I didn't mind it as I enjoyed the sweet sauce. The pig head itself comes with a pile of wraps and broccoli. The pig head was mostly fat and did not really have much meat to it. I expected way more meat but I think I was able to have two wraps with decent amount of meat in it. The rest was just skin and fat. I was left wanting more meat as I did not want to just eat straight pig fat- especially if I'm dishing out the big bucks for this one main dish. The few bites of meat I did have were tender, juicy and delicious though. The fries were just fries and nothing extraordinary. I may come back but I would not order the pig head again- maybe the lamb or the rib eye.",1,,

Around 5:45 we were both done with our glasses but the server did not come back until 6:03 to ask us if we wanted more wine but also made sure to tell us our new glasses would be $13+. I don't like this type of service especially when the establishment isn't very busy. I asked about the $12 burger and drink and though we got the deal the ""stacked"" burger was literally a sesame bun with beef and cheese + soggy fries. Not a single vegetable on the burger.

When fries are what you remember at a place called Cannibal, you need to be worried. The Kielbasa was very good, but again, the highlight of the appetizer was the side slaw with a wonderful amount of heat and spice. I enjoyed the ""Chicken Sweetbreads"" but what the hell are they? Rather than being thymus glands, these tasted like livers. I'm a bit disappointed with the unusual naming convention.

When you first walk in you can see their obsession of beer, your surrounded by coolers with about three hundred plus different varieties. They have a nice bar and two outdoor but covered seating areas. Their menu is great, you can get small plates, bar snacks, charcuterie, veggies and large format dishes. We started with the roasted bone marrow w/beef shank ragout. The marrow was nice and buttery, a little under cooked and the ragout had nice deep, rich flavor. The crust bread that was served with it was super oily. Also tried the house bbq chips and everything pretzel. The chips were crispy and seasoned perfectly. I really enjoyed the pretzel I am a everything junkie. My wife had their Caesar salad and loved it. She especially loved the baby romaine hearts they used. We also tried their brussel sprouts w/brown butter, sherry vinegar and pomegranate. The flavor was really nice. And for the main course we had to try the general tso pig's head w/broccoli rabe and a moo shu pancake.

98,Kristen S.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",8,5,0,2.0,10/27/2017,I was so excited to come get a burger here as it won 2017 best burger competition. I even went weeks without having a burger with anticipation for this one. I was very let down and disappointed. The service was ok but we were left for about 10 mins before anyone even came to the table. The beer by the bottle was barely cold which was already annoying. 40 mins later and two burgers (both medium rare) have still not arrived. My bf asked to see what the hold up was as tables around us that sat 20 mins after were already eating theirs. It took about another 5-7 mins for our burgers to show up and they were cold. The fries were cold. My egg was underdone and my burger was medium well. I couldn't even eat more than half and I ate that Bc I was starving.  The server was nice enough to take off my burger seeing I barely touched. But after waiting so long to be served cold food means we just went unnoticed. Unfortunately will not be returning. Way too many butchers/burger places in NYC.,1,,1
99,Alvin C.,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",72,14,59,2.0,10/12/2017,"I used to recommend Cannibal and Cannibal Liquor House to all my friends.  In almost a dozen visits to these two locations, I have consistently been well pleased with their menu items. I would even rank the dry-aged ribeye steak as one of the best in the city. However, my most recent visit left such me with such a bad impression that I now regret ever recommending either restaurant.  I have no complaints about the quality of the food here, but there is a huge problem with how they treat their customers.The lack of quality service from the wait staff was inexcusable (not the hostess or bartenders, they are almost always friendly and very accommodating).  My party felt very rushed throughout our entire meal. Even though the place was mostly empty and a couple hours from closing, our server (a blonde woman) seemed like she couldn't wait to get out of there.  We were constantly asked if we were still working on dishes that had just been served.  The waitress literally took away my plate while I was eating food off of it.  This happened to other members of my party as well.  She also kept clearing our wine glasses while we were still drinking and trying to order additional bottles.Additionally, items that were ordered individually kept being brought out and served to the wrong person. I don't know if the server was unable to remember who ordered what, or if we just all looked alike to her, but combined with the rest of our dining experience, this normally minor issue made things worse. While this dreadful experience was the first negative one I've had at either Cannibal location, it was disagreeable enough to outweigh all of my previous positive experiences.  For my friends that were dining here for the first time, it was definitely a distasteful experience that merits a less forgiving review.",1,2,

Not only was the presentation great, but the food tasted as good as it looked; there were no condiments needed. The server (Ryan) was funny and personable. He was very knowledgeable about the menu. He made great suggestions regarding food choices. The bartender was very helpful and pleasant. We ordered several items including the steak, the burger, the ribs, the chicken and more. We of course had more than enough; the left overs were appreciated the next day. We will definitely make Cannibals one our go to places when we are dining out.",,,

Tonight I met thee rudest person that shouldn't even be working in the restaurant industry. SMFH I never heard such a thing that all parties has to be present in order to put a name down and to be seated at a table. Me and my friend were just waiting on our other friend under the awning of the restaurant as it was a chilly and rainy night. As the front of the house cleared up, we went inside for a bit but couldn't hear our own voices so we stood outside. Finally our friend arrived and we asked to be seated at a table. The server told us that there's a waiting of 15-20 mins. She really wasn't friendly and provided absolutely zero customer service...can't believe this is the first person that we have to deal with after a long day of work and starvation. Hallelujah!...she finally seated us at the outdoor area and we had share a picnic table. The dinner menu has semi-little items that I would eat but NO RIBS =( Shares: Cured Salumis (3)...very tasty and thinly slicedBeef Tartare...actually it was my first time eating anything in the tartare family because me and raw food don't go together. The flavor profiles are definitely on point with this one biteCannibal Dogs...nothing special taste like any other hot dogsBone Marrow Brulee...fork a little of it but not my cup of tea though Smoked Kielbasa...smallest portion size and where is the rest of my delicious sausage =(Blood Sausage (forgot the actual name)...tried a little still not my cup of tea as well I asked our server to doggy bag the bone marrow but I should've mentioned it was for my friend's dog. The server apologizes for dropping the bone marrow on the floor which it ended up being thrown in the trash. If its not for a human being to consume, you could like pull it out from the trash can...am I right!? I was waiting for the restroom until a server told me there was another bathroom around the corner. Wow there's an emptied dining room where one group had a table. For her to make it seemed earlier that they didn't have enough tables...bullshit! Overall the whole experience sucks but at least I had great company to soothe things out.

107,Liz S.,"Manhattan, NY",11,14,6,5.0,11/26/2017,Just held a 30th birthday party here with 25 guests in the Liquor House room. I worked with Tinika to set up the party package and she was super helpful and responsive. We had the pig roast - they brought out the pig for us to look at before serving. Vegetarian option for 2 guests were huge and delicious. They also took note of allergies beforehand. The sides were all very awesome! Definitely enough food. It was pricey but worth every penny. Their birthday shot was so cool and creative! Thanks Cannibal for an excellent night we won't forget!,,,
108,Prashant V.,"Manhattan, NY",6,38,65,4.0,12/26/2017,Went here for dinner with a few friends. Food was delicious and the atmosphere is super interesting. Food portions are kind of small - sort of like tapas so you have to order several dishes. We sat in the back which is basically a garden covered in the winter and heated so it's super cozy but feels like you're outside. The service was also great. Only reason for four starts is that it's a bit pricey in my opinion. The meats were delicious as was the sausage but for pre-made things I would think the prices would be less steep. Nonetheless a fun place to eat and good drinks.,,,
109,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,5.0,4/25/2016,"I took my friend who was visiting from California to the Cannibal just to eat their roasted Pig's Head and it was a unique, fun, and interesting dining experience.The restaurant changes up how they cook the pig's head. When we went in February, the menu offered half of a pig's head cooked in a general tso's sauce with broccoli rabe & scallion salad, mooshu pancakes. It was $85 for two (but in reality, it could probably feed 3-4 people). We ordered the dish right when we got seated as it takes around 45 minutes to prepare. I enjoyed a beer in the meantime. The whole experience was phenomenal. The meat from the pig's head was so tender and juicy (especially from the cheeks). It was probably the best pork I've ever had in my life. The meat literally fell off the bone - it was that good.  The pork was so juicy, without it being too fatty. The server was nice enough to slice and cut the pig's head for us (I wouldn't know where to start..). He also explained which part of the head had the best cut of meat. We enjoyed every bite, and also got to pack the rest of the pig's head to go because we were so full. There was so much food, and the whole experience was worth it. I will be dreaming of this meal until the next time I come back!",6,4,4

I walked in because I heard they have a great hot dog entree. It's a plate of 2 medium sized hot dogs They just updated their Cannibal Hot Dogs to the Cannibal Hot Dogs 2.0. . I'm not sure what the original version had, but the current one used Chinese mustard, cilantro, scallion give it a very Asian fusion flavor. I really enjoyed the tripe they threw on top also. I think so far my favorite hot dog in NYC.The bartender was so friendly and awesome. I was one of two people in the restaurant in the middle of the day on a Monday, but it wasn't awkward. I really like their selection of beer. Mostly local beers.",1,,1
111,Nicole D.,"Philadelphia, PA",187,1,9,5.0,8/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant after seeing The Book of Mormon. We had reservations for 6:00pm, but since we got there at 4pm they let us sit in the beer garden early. The atmosphere was very rustic, but beautiful. I admit, I thought it was going to be a larger outdoor space, but beautiful regardless. The tables are communal so if you have a small party, then you might have to sit with others. Cedric was one of our waiters and he was so nice!!! He would always check on us and he was super friendly. We enjoyed talking to him while we waited for our food. The Beer Master (I forgot his name, sorry) was really nice too! He knew his stuff and was able to give my boyfriend a sample of a beer he recommended. My boyfriend loved it. They told us how long each food item would take and they were on time with each item. Food came out in this order (we got a lot of food because we hear amazing reviews on most of the food): Beef Tarare, Pretzel, Pork Rinds, Bone Marrow, General Tso Pig Head.Beef Tartare was possibly my favorite. Seasons were amazing. It had a little chewy mouth feel, but it wasn't overwhelming. I would definitely get this again.My boyfriend had the pretzel. He enjoyed it. He said it had a coffee taste to it.Pork Rinds were very good. I put some of the beef tartare on them (I'm on a low carb diet lol). The pork Rinds had sprinkles of cheddar cheese on them. The sauce tasted like a spicy mayo. The sauce went well with the pork Rinds, but I could have eating the Rinds with or without true sauce.The bone marrow IS GOD'S BUTTER. So rich tasting! I probably cannot see myself eating this everyday because it is so fatty and rich, but the taste blew me away. The soft scrambled eggs pulled it all together. If you like fatty and rich foods, then definitely get this.General Tso's Pig head was the one thing I would always see on yelp. This was definitely a huge portion. I didn't believe it when reviewers said that this serves 4 people....but I was wrong. This is a huge portion. The skin was very crispy and the sauce was amazing. My boyfriend loved the skin, but I just thought the fat was too much for me to eat. The meat, on the other hand,.......I have never tasted anything so juicy and delicious. It was just difficult to get to the meat if you don't want to eat all the fat. If you don't mind ALOT of fat under the skin, then you will like this.I will DEFINITELY go back to try other stuff on their menu. GO THERE HUNGRY!",2,,

Large menu of beer. I highly suggest the apple fritter dessert. I.T comes with a dipping sauce and looks like a doughnut. We ordered a cheese plate, the flank steak and Brussels sprouts. That was a perfect amount of food for two. I have been trying to go here for a while, but they always have events and right now they have a bunch of holiday parties, so make sure you make a reservation in advanced!

Essentially, their front of house does amazing work. Unfortunately, this reviews gets 2 stars, because our meal was very underwhelming. We ordered the lamb belly, which was burnt and over-salted (and that's saying a lot from me, because I usually add salt to meals). They were great cuts of fatty meat, but only a minor portion of it was palatable. The price was very high at $65 for the meat, and I figured that a place called ""Cannibal,"" would be worth it, and the reviews seemed praising of this place. The broccoli rabe was over-priced as well. If you come here, I would either suggest getting small plates or just not trying the lamb belly, but perhaps it was an off night for the back of house, and I would be willing to try this place out again as the other reviews seem to be very discordant with what we experienced.We also had diarrhea afterwards.",1,1,
114,Kelly Y.,"New York, NY",138,138,228,4.0,1/19/2017,"One of the friendliest bars in NYC!I came into this bar to meet a friend but was a bit early. However, the hostess was nice enough to let me sit by the bar while I wait. Since the bar didn't have my usual whiskey, the bartender helped me look for a beer instead (Can't remember the name of this beer but it was a bit sour yet dark). I ended up really liking the recommendation and went for two more rounds.Seating wise, there are some tables in the back but there's also a bar area if your party isn't that huge. The lights are dim and the crowd isn't rowdy like you'd expect in a sports bar. The guests that were there the night I went were mostly courteous.When my friend arrived, we ordered the Beef Bulgogi, Cannibal Dogs, and Shaved Brussels. I'm not sure why but the shaved brussels took a while to come but we at least had the beef bulgogi and cannibal dogs to snack on while we ate. It might have been because I was really hungry but everything tasted delicious! Portion sizes weren't huge though so it's fit for either one or two at most.I'd definitely return to this bar to try out the steak but for what it's worth, it's a great place for a quick bite during lunch or dinner.",1,4,1

I also had a couple (don't judge me) Godfather's to start with AND a glass of red wine.  The bartender practically knew me when I walked in and made all of these recommendations.  I was beyond thrilled with the night I spent sipping and nibbling at The Cannibal.  Reasonably priced and appropriately NYC.  Hipsters, business guys, friends and families all mixed together...   Mashing awesome burgers and craft cuisine.

Came with bone marrow which we love but they topped the bone marrow with a mixture that I took off. But I'm more of a purist and like bone marrow with just topped with some salt, mmm. Ribeye was yummy, but not the best we've ever had either. During dinner in the summer they keep the door to the patio open.

Drinks took a long time but food took FOREVER and was teeny tiny. When we finally got our food- our server told us the outdoor area was closing and would be moving us inside in 10 minutes.

This might not have been so bad, if not for their practice of letting us know about it only when everyone's drinks were coming out, and at that time offering alternatives that weren't very similar nor very good. For the people whose drinks were available, they made sure to mess up the order some other way (bringing wrong quantities of drinks, or duplicates of some dishes).When the bill came, it had practically no connection to reality, charging us for drinks we didn't actually get and food they had initially brought out by accident and which we obviously didn't keep.",,,

Twiddling our thumbs in indecision as many New Yorkers do when trying to decide where to eat a coveted meal, I then suggested The Cannibal because... meat. ""Les get it!"" We agreed.I'd advise going alone or with other 1-2 people max as it's a cozy at-the-bar setup. I believe there is a back room as well, but I tend to like the more casual seat and I went during lunch. Overall, it's a rustic meets upstanding bar sort of environment. Actually, perfect for a date unless they're *shiver* of the vegetable only diet. Might be awkward.The entrance welcomes you with a line of refrigerators stocked with an array of bottled (and canned) beers, which then opens up to a large, long bar to the left with a friendly bartender. Wish I could comment on the extent and value of the beers here, but I was accompanied by a more knowledgable beau so I didn't pick my own drinks (and y'all know I don't seriously dabble in this area). I will say, I can appreciate a good tasting anything ... And this place killed it.Must order dishes that I tried: - Steak tartare, bearnaise, crumpet: melt. in. my. mouth. now. My god.- Peking duck rilletes, scallion, cilantro, sesame: flavorful intro with a fresh finish- Pig's head Cuban, head, ham, gruyere, pickles: toasty outside that gives way to a moist insideLet's say I left happily full and buzzed, which eventually led me to my couch to digest and die.

122,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,4.0,6/26/2017,"1. Not for vegetarians.2. Expensive3. Everything else GREAT!The restaurant/shop is connected to a bar (and its kitchen) through an archway in the wall. The bar has a scaled down menu, more tables and more room to move. It's great for groups. When we got there, there was a private event in the outdoor garden, so they accommodated us in the bar... with the full menu.We ordered the ham tasting board... delicious! All three hams were thin sliced and presented like a beer flight. Speaking of beer, the bar offered me my first taste of Sorachi Ace. I'm still not sure if I liked it, but it certainly the WEIRDEST tasting beer I've drunk this year. We split a couple of hot dogs in tripe (though the name was different, something like ""Cannibal Dogs""). If that sounds bad to you.... YOU'RE WRONG! It was terrific. We had one more pork-based appetizer then moved to the main dish. At $35, the chicken was the cheapest... so we shared that as the only main dish. Go to a MEAT bar and order chicken? You bet! It was great. The seasoning on everything was perfect... just a hint of spice and the rest the meat taste itself. The staff both at the bar and in the restaurant were spectacular. But keep in mind 2 beers, 1 appetizer and 1/3 of a main dish cost us $60 a piece. I can't do it every night, but it was so good... I will be back.",2,,1

The multitude of bartenders behind the tiny bar were of no use to us, not even sure they know we were there. Again, thank you barback.

The service was really great though, and all around a pleasant experience.

It was really fun to work out way through the board...I wish the server knew a litttttle more about the meats and cheeses but overall we knew enough about what we were eating. When we got the additional cheese plate two servers came to explain the cheeses - I liked that. We also had to be careful on time even though we made a reservation (they needed the table). It's definitely a great place to visit especially if you like being adventurous with your beer. We'll be back!",,,

The lamb tartare came out covered in cheese which was disappointing as I expected it to come with an egg like the yelp pictures showed. It was still delicious just not what was expected. The morcilla tasted and looked like Korean blood sausage. It wasn't anything special but still pretty good. Overall the massive beer selection, the cool leather bound menus, and the savory dishes all added up to a great experience. I also really enjoyed their use of the outdoor area.",,,1

The atmosphere is perfect for a date or catching up with a friend: very cozy and cute. There are some bar tables near the front, an intimate bar and raised booth facing it, as well as some smaller tables towards the back. The servers know their stuff--they checked in on my table throughout the evening, always made sure we had water and refills on drinks, and were friendly and helpful. You shouldn't think twice about getting the burger--it comes on a sesame seed bun with cheese and special sauce, and fries all for $14. That is an actual steal when you think about places that charge you extra for cheese and fries. That's not happening at the Cannibal  Liquor House and I appreciate it. Come early, get some drinks, eat a burger and be happy.",1,,

After sitting at the temporary table for almost 45 minutes, we were escorted to the reserved table in the beer garden. One we were sat, we were informed the beer garden closes at 11:00pm.

Updated review",If I could put no stars I would. We ordered the dry aged steak and it was bland with no flavor. They have the nerve to charge 110 for flavorless steak.The lamb was burnt. The pigs head we only had the skin as it was all covered in fat on top of fat. How do you mess up a hot dog. I guess the 1 star is for their variety of beers.How can 5 guys not finish half the meal. We went to Korean bbq afterwards,,,1

Awesome staff that knows the menu well. Unapologetic focus on big meat dishes including charcuterie and whole pig and lamb. Good beer menu and a mini craft beer store inside. The chicharones were delicious, especially with the tasty aioli, though a tiny bit dry on their own. The hot dogs with tripe chili were absolutely incredible. I never thought I'd want tripe chili, but the Cannibal has converted me. The staff is awesome as well and knows their way around the beer menu as well as cuts of meat. For a meat focussed meal, Cannibal is the place to go.",2,1,1

The pig's head was way too glutinous though. Cons: It's true -- it's overpriced. Also, holy crap it's hot there. It's hot inside and it's hot outside. We were sweating the minute we walked in and through the entire 2 hours we were there. In fact, we left because we just couldn't stay any longer as it was just so uncomfortably hot. I would never go back in the dead heat of summer (we went in July). Never again.See you in the fall/winter though for sure.",1,1,

149,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,3.0,8/29/2016,"Beer bars may abound in Brooklyn and Queens but alas, Manhattan makes for a barren scene.Since the Cannibal is a rare find on this beer barren isle, I was thus eager to give it a trial. My friend and I stopped by Sunday just after 8:00, and were able to sit in their backyard garden, which was great. Placing orders to start with a couple of brews, we... (breaking the flow here, as it was broken last night, I had to flag down the server for our beers, as they were overlooked while the other tables continued to be served, and even we received an appetizer first) ...would have been able to enjoy them as we waited for our food.To eat we shared an order of the chicharrones, which were tasty, followed by the aged beef burger, topped with provolone and shishito peppers, which was enormous. The meat had a unique flavor, but I was disappointed by the meager slices of pepper, having expected several whole ones. We also shared a side of the broccoli caesar, which had potential. However, the lemon flavor was way too strong, and was reminiscent of lemon sorbet.But all in all, it was A-OK!",,1,
150,Vivian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",265,157,548,3.0,4/26/2016,"Man I was so excited to try this place. I mean who doesn't want to eat a whole pig's head. Sadly, this was the only thing that I really liked here. We came in on a early weeknight and was situated in their back garden (it's a perfect spot to grab some beers and snack).Now to their food. We ordered a few things and nothing really stood out. For a meat shop, I felt I've had better characturie and pates at other places around the city and left frankly disappointed. Here are some of the things that we tried:Lamb Tartare: Recommended by our waiter and was probably the most disappointing thing of the night. The tartare had no taste at all (not even the gamy taste that lamb has)Cochinta Pibil Head Terrine: Also recommended to us by the waiter. It was alright. Nothing to write home about.Bone Marrow Brulee: Amazing presentation! Again however, was just alright. General Tso's Pig Head: Incredibly crispy which was amazing. Don't be afraid to dive right in because literally every part of the pigs head was edible (the snout and ears were my favorite parts). A bit spicier that I thought it would be but didn't mind that since I like my food hot. For the other patrons at my table, it was a problem. Also, a bit over sauced.To summarize the Cannibal, it's just alright. None of us at the table was writing home about the food and probably won't be returning. If you're into meat though, I would still suggest you grab a few beers and a pig's head but that's about it.",3,3,3
151,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",408,239,30,5.0,8/28/2016,"I love meat. I love beer. Ergo, I love The Cannibal.I strolled in for a Saturday dinner and was surprised to find plenty of seats available at the bar. In order to get the best food and drink recommendations, I highly recommend sitting at the bar; the bartenders are great conversationalists. Food-wise, I was a big fan of the bone marrow brulee, juicy and full of umami. The lamb tartare was also a big hit, which was a pleasant surprise given I rarely eat raw meat. The kielbasa and lamb & gruyere sausages were also piquant and elevated. To cap off the meal, the cured salumi and cheese board were also fine selections, though far from the main attraction here.Beer-wise, you are going to be hard pressed to find a restaurant with a better selection than the Cannibal's. From saison to IPA to porter, they have what you need, domestic or imported. They also do takeout, so in case you're in a tight squeeze and looking for a quality beer, this is the place to go.The famous $85 pig's head is something I just have to eat, so I will be back to cannibalize some more before long.",,,1

All the appetizers and sides were great! I was skeptical of the spam sushi, but it was a pleasant surprise. The pig was delicious (especially the skin). I just thought the legs were a bit dry. My only real complaint was that the feast was held outside and it was hot as balls. My bald father had sweat dripping off his head.Definitely want to come back to try the steakhouse feast, but would wait until the weather is a bit cooler.",,,
153,Gavin P.,"New York, NY",7,3,0,3.0,9/27/2017,"SERVICE! So we ordered the roasted whole suckling pig for my friends bday. This is supposed to be a whole production according to the promotional video. They brought out cured / smoked meat and Pate/liver platters to start but didn't explain what anything was until we asked. It was all very delicious except for the chicken liver mousse which tasted rotten. I LOVE chicken liver in all forms and I found this to be barely edible. They then brought out the whole pig but would not cut it upOn our table because they said it was too ""HOT"". I sure hope the pig would be hot after being cooked! Anyways they chopped up the pig on another table  and started bringing over the pieces on big ceramic platters. But again they didn't say what anything was. Tell us that this is the skin , this is the shoulder , this is the belly, this is tender , this is fatty etc, etc. I figured out what everything was eventually but don't assume we know the different parts of the pig. Then after the meat was brought out they served some broccoli rabe and some delicious pita type bread. Again no explanation for what these were for. Apparently you're supposed to make sandwiches with the bread , meat and broccoli. Once we figured that out it was amazing ! But I was already full by the time that happened Bc they didn't tell us anything. We even asked the waiter to explain everything and he forgot to do it. I'm guessing because we were 8 guys , mostly in mid 20s , that we wouldn't care what anything was and just wanted to eat meat but they shouldn't assume. Do NOT just drop food on our table then leave. that's not professional. Could have been 5 stars but 3 stars bc of bad service and rotten chicken liver. BTW tanika who arranged the whole pig roast scheduling was very nice accommodating to changes !",1,,

We had great cocktails, killer oysters and very good burgers. The calamari was solid, but nothing to write home about. The burgers were a good size, creative and well cooked. That said, for all this goodness in front of us, we watched a splayed, roasted suckling pig go by our table on a platter and were overcome with envy.

As for the food, it was mixed. The sweetbreads were great. The half pig's head was 90% fat (which I guess is just how pigs are), but the sauce seemed only lightly brushed on the skin, with all the meat (fat) tasting pretty flavorless, like boiled pork.

The avocado toast included mint and a kick of heat to match the radish topping. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and was the perfect side to my Butcher's breakfast. The slices of bacon in the breakfast may as well have been pork chops, they were so meaty and flavorful. The only disappointment was the pig head Cuban is no longer on the menu. However The Bodega was quite satisfying. The meal was paired with 3 oz of Rose and I was in hog heaven pun intended. This is a nice spot for small groups, a fourth date if the person is a beer drinker and a foodie. The patio is both intimate and accommodating. I'll have to try the dinner menu.",,,
161,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,4.0,2/19/2016,"This place is so fun and tasty.  I've stopped at their Gotham West location for a meaty, fatty, yummy Cuban sandwich, and I've dined at Resto next door for brunch.  But, I would highly recommend a dinner and beer experience here with friends (it's predominantly guys, mind you). They don't take ressie for parties less than 6 but my two friends and I walked in here at 7:30 ish on a Friday and only waited a 10-15 min. or so.  We had to sit at the bar, though, which is fine - I didn't see the room with table out back but assume it's for larger groups.Firstly, do not come here with a vegetarian.  It's all about MEAT.  The entire menu is shared small plates... of meat.  Ranging from raw (tartare- beef, lamb, tuna), to meat plates/cheese plates, to snacks, to bigger items made for 2/3 people.   We had the following:-Cacio e Pepe Chips - always a winner given the cheesy/salty flavor of cacio e pepe-The Chicarrones - do NOT miss these; house fried pork rhine with delicious mayo, and lime-The reserve meat plate - our choices of yummy prosciutto, guanciale and smoked, spreadable sausage (not sure of the name). I didn't love the spreadable stuff (or the live or pates for that matter- they had lots of that), but I could tell this was unique and for serious meat lovers. -The corned beef, candied - that was a special and incredibly good, perfected well brined, and yummy -We had a chicken pate/liver - which I did not try, don't love it.-Our veggies were the potato salad- be prepared for mustard.  With some dill and sour cream. Nothing too special but carby.-By far the best veggie hands down, is the brussel sprouts - do NOT miss these. These are so yummy- with egg, ham, and shaves sprouts, delicious! Everything came with delicious wheat (ish?) rustic bread.Of course, we cannot forget the beer.  The staff was very knowledgable with thousands of craft beers/styles in the house - with of course a German/Belgian specialty.  I had the Tank 7 which was a farmhouse saison, good citrus and wheat flavor with the right amount of hop (not too hoppy, but bitter enough).   My friend had a lighter lager - forget the names but one was a good flavor and the other one a bit too...milky/sweet.  They have wine too if you're not into beer, which is what my friend opted for. Though, people come here for the beer.  I'd come back and opt for the pretzel- which they ran of out, sadly.  Everything was $150 ish so of course in small plates style, come and prepare to spend.  Though I should mention- this place is so fun and I actually left, light as a feather. I guess it's the no carbs thing!",3,3,5
162,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",202,1241,267,4.0,3/4/2016,"I'd categorize this place as a beer bar as well. Their selection is excellent.Sure some of the less/middle range beers are expensive but you are paying for the absolute quality as well as the variety. They also change around the selection a whole lot depending on season so every time you go there, you could try something new. Anyway, it was lunch time so I didn't have well beer.Anyway, the bartender was nice. He seems to give good selections to others who were looking for beers. BONE MARROW BRULEE- soft scrambled egg, marinated mushrooms (15)Bone Marrow came with 4 pieces of bread (he said I could get more if needed but 4 large pieces was enough.There was a pretty good amount of bone marrow along with some light greens and some excellent mushrooms.

166,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",70,302,103,3.0,4/10/2016,"I was so excited to come to Cannibal, but I have to say that I was very disappointed. The most important takeaway from this review is that for the prices you're paying here, the portions are TINY, and so this is not a $$ restaurant by any means. It is definitely a $$$ restaurant. I visited with 5 male friends, and we all agreed that every dish we ordered was way too small for what we were expecting based on the price. The tuna tartare was understandably small, but the cauliflower with walnut pesto was ridiculously meager. We each had one small cauliflower floret. It's cauliflower! Not an expensive vegetable by any means. The Cannibal dogs were of normal hot dog size, but was nothing to call home about. The smoked Kielbasa sausages were surprisingly soft and also nothing extraordinary. Finally, for our main feature- the General Tso's Pigs Head. See pictures for how au natural the dish looked. Keep in mind that you get half of the pig's head, meaning one side of the face, cut exactly in half (cool for studying anatomy). This dish is basically a Peking Duck, but with the pig head substituted for the whole duck. The diner picks the meat from the head and wraps it in the moo shu pancakes with some broccoli rabe, a la taco-style. The meat is very tender in the cheek area, albeit fatty. The skin is a bit tough. We were shocked to find that our pig came with the brain and eyeballs intact, both of which are delicacies and known to be quite savory. As a neuroscientist in training, I was intrigued by the brain and picked at it a fair amount before giving it a try. Not bad. The fact that it was drenched in the General Tso's sauce made it much more manageable. I'm honestly not sure if I would've tried the brain without any sauce. The texture is much like pate, and the taste was 100% General Tso's, or at least that's what I forced myself to believe. I didn't try the eyeball, because brain was enough adventure for me for one day. Towards the end, we started to realize just how salty the meat was. By then, we had picked off all the meat and were left with a pretty cool-looking half skull. The service was great and our server was helpful and present, given that we sat in the outdoor seating area. I can imagine that it's very nice in the outdoor seating area when it's warm out. But since we were there in April, there was a transparent tarp that covered the area, with heat lamps scattered around. It has a hipster, woody vibe. However, I would not come back. We were all disappointed by the portions and not impressed by the food. The menu was also surprisingly limited.",1,,

Even the bread was great. The lamb was finely cut with some good citrusy flavors that made it taste fresh with a lot of complex flavorsCornbread and rootbeer sausage- so interesting and delicious. It has all the spices of rootbeer (cinnamon, caridmon etc) but it doesn't taste like rootbeer which is great. The ""cornbread"" just adds some texture and a sweet flavor. There is also this very interesting butter sauce and cauliflower which was awesome. Marrow - we ended the meal with some bone marrow. It was great!!

The food was exactly what we were hoping for -- steak cooked perfectly. Do yourself a favor and get the everything pretzel! My husband loved that they were playing movies - fun touch. We will definitely be back.,,,
173,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",962,976,2710,4.0,12/6/2014,"Holy balls is it dark in the back garden, at least it's covered and heated. It's been a long time since I got the meat sweats, the place oozes meat and it's a wonderful concept, but I felt like death when leaving. It was too much grease and fat. I thought it was a nice experience, but it was pricey for what it was. It came out to $70 per. The price of the beers are on the high side, but it's almost necessary to wash down the grease. I want to go back and try other stuff.The food:Lamb Tartare- red onions, capers, Harissa Aioli, egg yolk. This was excellent. It was so light and perfect, the way tartare supposed to taste. Prob one of my fav tartares, it's a must order.Half Pigs Head Reuben- Russian dressing, Rye, melted Gruyere- my God there was a lot of fat. The meat was falling off the bone tender and the sauerkraut cheese mixture on top was wonderful but the pig head was too much fat and too much grease. It's something you should share with like 4-5 ppl. Also, it gets super salty when it cools. The Russian dressing is homemade and it was wonderful, it is a nice addition to the pork. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Tandori Lamb belly- Watermelon, chili, lime salad, pita. Parts of the lamb belly were too salty. But the other parts were good. It's a massive order, I say it's enough for 8 ppl. The flavor was great and it's something you should try, it kinda had a rack of lamb feel. The watermelon salad was an awesome palate cleanser.Shaved brussels sprout- slow cooked egg, country ham xo. This was barely a noticeable dish. The brussels sprout you put on top of nice crusty bread and eat like like a spread. This dish wasn't a memorable dish, even with the poached egg.Peking Duck Rillettes- scallion, cilantro, sesame. The flavor of the rillette was nice but on the mild side, the toast was a nice hearty thick cut toast that worked well. The rillette had a faint duck taste but it felt like it was cut with something else. This is a skippable dish.",4,2,5
174,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,3.0,5/9/2016,"Went here for a quick brunch meal on a Saturday morning. Inside you're greeted with walls of beer, a large bar area, and seating in a garden.Not a large draft selection, but very unique. Ordered a strong stout ($9 for 6oz) and a Pig's Head Cuban Sandwich ($12). The sandwich is pressed tightly and has a strong cheese flavor. The pig's head meat had an odd taste to it that didn't mesh well for me (given I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like). The beer is solid with the food, just wish there was more of it.Buyer's remorse set in when looking at the other options on the menu, especially the sausages. Will maybe visit their Gotham Market location.",,,
175,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",294,1309,45,4.0,1/3/2016,"INSANELY DELICIOUS PORK HEAD. Four of us polished it off, which the server said no one in the past three weeks had done to the degree that we had!I think the terrines and pâtés that they make in-house are also good, though we didn't have a chance to try them.We ordered the bone marrow also; tasty, but a bit small for the price. The bone that we received was rather shallow, so there wasn't much to scoop out to eat.Beer and wine is very expensive. We somehow managed to order two beers that cost $13 apiece. Cheaper options ran about $8, which is in the more typical range for Manhattan, but still barely acceptable IMHO.",1,,1

177,Lauren L.,"Jersey City, NJ",33,44,32,4.0,3/26/2016,"Solid place for drinks/food. Walked right in at around 5 and got seated at the bar right away. I was SO pleasantly surprised to see a country ham selection with hams from KY, TN, and NC. I haven't found any other bar/restaurant in Manhattan yet that serves a good country ham platter! It was $18 and was served with some bread. Beers and liquor were pretty reasonably priced, with a pretty good selection of both. In addition to the country ham, we ordered the bone marrow creme brulee. It was pretty meh to be honest.....served with bread, mushrooms, and bread, it was pretty underwhelming. Despite the disappointing bone marrow, the service and atmosphere at the Cannibal are deserving of foot stars. Our bartender was pretty attentive, and the food didn't take too long to come out. Super laid back with a good drink menu, I will definitely be back if I'm in the neighborhood :)",,,

We then split the burger and the hot dogs. We enjoyed all of the food and tried out a few of the beers. Our server was nice and offered suggestions when asked. Overall, we enjoyed brunch and will definitely be back for dinner.",,,
180,Lauren F.,"Langhorne, PA",3,26,9,1.0,2/10/2018,"Went there tonight for birthday dinner. Called and made reservations. There was no availability for the beer and butcher next door, so we went with this place that has the same menu just different drinks. No big deal. Got there and they didn't have our reservation in the system. They were able to sit us just fine. Ordered drinks. One drink came and waited for second.  No luck. They couldn't find the key for the liquor cabinet to get a new bottle needed.  After waiting a while with no luck on the key, we asked to just order a beer. Ordered a beer. They brought it over and poured it with apologies. Things happen. They said the drink would be on house and they would get us the original drink ordered. The beer they gave us was the wrong one... ordered meals. Appetizer of the octopus is mostly rabbit food of kale and sliced radishes. Appetizer came out with meal and only one.. I'm not sure what the issue was but this place is a holy mess. We couldn't get the check fast enough to GTFO. Sever very nice but obviously lacking skill and experience as server. Mixed drink originally ordered never came and idk if they ever found the key to their liquor. Which seems a bit important looking at the name of place.",,,

182,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3176,11053,4.0,7/10/2014,"It's called The Cannibal for a reason. Vegetarians beware. Come here to feast on meats. Even the potato salad (listed under ""Vegetables"" on the menu) includes bacon.Start out with the beef jerky. It's reasonably priced at $6, but it's kind of super salty. Wash it down with a craft beer. The Cannibal has one of the best beer selections I've ever seen in Manhattan. So if you're a beer drinker, you'll be in for a treat.Anyway, they're also known for their pig's head, but they were sold out of it when we went. Bummer. We went with the lamb belly, which was essentially a fatty rack of lamb. Delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender.My only complaint is that the first bartender refused to seat us outside. He said it was because they close at 8:30, but it was just after 7 when we got there. We were definitely done with our meal before closing time.After he took off, our second bartender/server was excellent. Answered our beer questions, gave us food recommendations, and seemed like he really cared about the business.",4,1,2
183,Jeenee Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2494,626,6694,4.0,1/9/2015,"Came here for the first time... and heres my 2 cent on this spot!It was cold, but only outdoor (with cover & heat lamp) was available for us. As you step in, both (left & right) side of you will be refrig filled with a whole lotta different kinds of beer! Then pass the Bar! straight out through the door is the outdoor seating!I believe Pigs Head (to share) can feed up to 3-5 people! We only had about 2.5 people that was interested in grubbing..(still had huge portions of the Pigs Head left over)My fav: the sweet apple cider/beer with 16% alky in it, served in a wine glass! (felt all fancy) ^^Cons:The foods great... jus tasted real salty on a lot of em!..wonder why?? (pork?!?!)Foods also comes out fast!... you get too full by the time the 45 min cook time Pig Heads comes out!",,,
184,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,5.0,7/27/2015,"A carnivore's delight! Leave your veggie-wielding friends at home, folks.Got seated with minimal wait, although the host warned us that we had to be out of there in an hour and 15 because a large party was coming in later. Fair enough. We were seated outside in a cramped communal table. Thankfully, everyone was friendly and didn't mind bumping elbows every now and then. The backyard is enclosed with no discernible AC, which makes it hot and uncomfortable. May want to rethink coming here on a sweltering day.So admittedly, our true purpose for going to The Cannibal was to get the pig's head. However, the style that day was General Tso's, and we just weren't feeling that (Asians, we know better). But there were so many other delicious items on the menu, it didn't seem like a much of a loss. We had the following:Lamb tartare - With the egg yolk and onions and capers, this was so tasty. Definitely one of the better tartares I've had. Surprisingly light and refreshing.Pig's head terrine - Since we skipped the pig head, we had to do something that was pig! The terrine was deliciously flavorful, but my real love was for the celery pickles on the side. I'm pretty sure I've found my favorite pickles.Root beer and cornbread sausage with smoked cauliflower - We like ordering weird-sounding items. Definitely liked the salty sweet flavor of the sausage, which was mixed with cornbread bits that gave it an interesting texture. And the pureed smoked cauliflower was beyond delicious.Bone marrow - This plate was effing huge!! I've never had bone marrow this gigantic. Like, forget the bread (which was long gone after one bone). Plenty of radish slices and parsley too. We were hard pressed to finish all that rich goodness, but prevailed in the end. One thing to note. Although service was friendly, it took forever to get our food. I'm guessing they were backed up in the kitchen. It was actually seeming like we wouldn't make the hour and 15 minute mark, but what could we do? They gotta bring us the food so we can eat!Also, the table next to us ordered the pig's head, and despite our reservations, it did smell delicious. Definitely making a return trip for that.",4,3,4
185,Irene L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",156,121,78,4.0,6/18/2017,"I just had a wonderful meal here. While the outdoor seating was a bit humid, I quickly forgot about it once the food started coming out. The place was surprisingly uncrowded on a Saturday night, but I'm not complaining. Perhaps it's because it's on a quieter street and easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for. My boyfriend and I had the pork rinds, cheeseboard, arugula salad, hot dogs, and bone marrow. Everything was delicious! The arugula salad was very plain, but it was welcome as everything else we got was very rich and heavy. The pork rinds are coated in a sharp cheddar powder and are quite salty. As indicated on the menu, it's a great bar snack and starter. Pretty great to start with, but not as impressive once other things start coming out. The cheeses were great, although I think I'm just not a blue cheese person. My boyfriend and I agreed that it tasted the way a farm smells. Interesting, but we left a good hunk of it on the platter. We should have asked our waitress about the cheese more. Speaking of which, the staff knows their food and drinks, so ask for recommendations on either! Hot dogs were great, my favorite part was the beef tripe chili. The bone marrow was great. It was lightly salted, so you could really taste all of the garnishes come together with the marrow. If I hadn't been so full, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more. For those that don't know, bone marrow is VERY rich and creamy. Some people mistake it for fat (it's not). Even if you don't like vegetables, I'd recommend ordering one of their salads to cut the heaviness of their meat dishes.",,,
186,Meredith C.,"Manhattan, NY",93,41,46,4.0,12/22/2016,"Unclear if I'm inside a different establishment than plain Cannibal but friendly waiter service, extensive cocktails on draft and yummy munchies.

187,Felicia N.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",268,31,9,3.0,12/22/2017,"The food was really good. The service was a bit slow, but not too bad, and all the servers were very nice and accommodating when they did approach us. When we were ordering, we ordered the Berkshire Chop, which was divine, but it comes with no side. The server recommended a vegetable, and we saw others had the cauliflower, so we ordered that without opening the menu. When we saw the bill, that cauliflower was $32! How in the hell are you going to serve a $2 vegetable for $32? It was good but it wasn't that good! I mean we just had to laugh. The meal was shockingly overpriced, especially for sitting at a shared bench table in a dressed up plastic tent outside with heat lamps that didn't quite do the trick. We ate with our jackets on. The kielbasa was good, the bone marrow was good, but nothing to rave about. Man, though, that Chop was so amazingly flavorful and juicy and tender and delicious. I'm really torn as to whether this place is worth going back to or not. $32 for a head of roasted cauliflower. I mean come on.",,,
188,Laksen R.,"New York, NY",312,392,24,3.0,12/24/2015,"Pros: great beer selection (tons of bottles and a well rounded selection of drafts), inviting space to hangout.Cons: Food service and seating left much to be desired. Also, none of the menu items were out of this world. We came here on a weekday for a group dinner. After being told our table would be ready in 10 minutes we were finally seated an hour later. When we were seated we noticed tons of empty tables that would have accommodated us. Additionally they dont take reservations so they couldn't have been holding any of them. I really wanted to try their signature pigs head but unfortunately they were sold out. We tried the hotdogs, lamb tartare, brussells and the bone marrow. The bone marrow was the best out of the 4 whereas the rest were just okay. The food also came out in an awkward fashion where some of the table had received all their dishes (appetizers and mains) before others had received their starters. I would come back here for a beer and some bar bites but probably not for a full on dinner.",,,
189,Damian S.,"Dumont, NJ",219,267,331,4.0,9/17/2015,"Popped in here for a beer after stumbling upon it on Yelp. It was pretty empty when I came in but it was somewhere in the 5 - 5:30 area. First impression ""Wow, look at all the beer"" you walk in to a few coolers of single bottle beers. They have a very impressive single bottle selection. I sit down at the bar and see some beers I've never heard of on tap (I'm in heaven). I ordered a Singlecut Sour Kim w/ Raspberrys....not my type of drink but my girlfriends name is Kim and thought it would be funny to tell her I had lunch with a Sour Kim. It was tasty and had a tart/sour taste but was refreshing considering how hot/humid it was that day.I asked the bartender for a menu and as I look it over I realize I don't see what I thought was the reason I bookmarked this place a Pigs Head Cubano. I asked the bartender about it and she told me it's on the lunch menu (and they just switched over) but she would ask the kitchen if it could still be made if I was interested. ""Yes Please!""Dispite some reviews saying no TV's a television broadcast of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan entertained me while I looked around (at mostly cycling pictures and some pretty cool looking The Cannibal growlers [I guess they do fills but since I was headed to MSG after this I resisted the urge to get one]).Sandwich comes out....moment of truth. At first it was very hot so I had to let it sit a bit and normally I can handle hot beverages or food?!? The pig head part of this sandwich is pretty much warm head cheese. I've always had a hang up with the thought of head cheese. I've never had it....till this day and while I've had some charcuterie plates that have had some questionable meats none were head cheese. The result the sandwich is good. The bread has a good crisp, the gruyere was good, and the ham was tasty. I wish it had more pickles, the pickle to sandwich ratio was a bit of (for me) and then there's that head cheese...it's fine. The porky bits (sounds so appealing; I know) were good it's the gelatinous pieces that bothered me. At first, due to the temperature of the sandwich the gelatinous pieces (as I'm referring to them) were a bit smoother and softer not quite like  tasty pork belly fat or really slow cooked brisket fat but close. Once it stated cooling off the gelatinous pieces lost their appeal (to me) and it became difficult for me to seperate the look from my mind (or maybe it had something to do with the fact that while I was eating it the ear worm scene in Wrath of Khan was playing on the tv?!?!) If you don't mind head cheese this is yummy I just had to struggle with my own head at points. A few days after I came here I saw the Hot Dogs on a Michael Simon show.....damn, guess I have to come back.Actually, I have been back (with the not Sour unlike the drink Kim) for drinks before a MSG show. She found it cute and interesting also. We'll need to come back for dinner. Esp. After seeing a whole pig go past us and headed outside to a seating area I didn't know existed.

We ordered the duck roulette which was incredible and the pig head. Pig head was done general tso style and was perfectly executed. It was spicy and moist and just delicious.

192,Alex B.,"Chicago, IL",1585,534,1217,4.0,4/28/2014,"First of all I have not had the most perfect experience here but I still cannot give it less than 4 stars.  I am beating myself up over this. I have to be honest right? Been twice and had two very different experiences.  You come here for a reason. Whether it be the beer or pigs head, lamb belly, or the craft beer you have your reasons. I have tried a ton of menu items here and been ticked to no end when the things I want are not available (happens a lot so get here early).  I get even more ticked about the fact that our seats weren't available for an additional 40 minutes from when I was told on my second visit) . My conflicted emotions surround the fact that I cannot argue is how damn good their food is.  Even though I   Everything here is incredible. Last time they did not have the lamb belly (still waiting to try this) or the pigs head (eat the eyeball if you dare). It costs $65 and fine for 4 people if getting other menu items. While it may be the house novelty, its delicious, and you will leave the restaurant feeling like you ate a pigs head...not pretty but you will be full). As neither pigs head and lamb belly the two things are the menu features, we were upset. We ended up with the ribeye at twice the price ($120) of the other two. Yes it was the best steak I ever had, but still not happy that I didn't have my options for a lower costing item.  If it wasn't so good you can be sure I would have raised hell.  Other menu items that are a must buy are lamb tartare and the ham board (3 piles of ham with delicious biscuit and honey). For a buyer beware protip - Thursday, Friday, Saturday could be dangerous. You might end up shortchanged with your wait time and menu choices once seated unless you are super early. Your best bet is a Sunday or Monday night to have quick seating and a full menu at your fingertips. Another option is to plan a private event (10 or more people). I suggest giving them a call and exploring that option. Seemed like a great option when I was discussing it with the manager.",2,,1
193,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",255,403,259,5.0,1/18/2014,"I've been saving this restaurant as a meaty reward for my boyfriend, who's been very good at eating his veggies.  In my mind, this is the quintessential ""New York"" restaurant.  There's a unique character to the fare (meat and beer and bicycles... oh my!), it's small and intimate, with a heated garden in colder weather, the playlist is a mish-mash of the greatest artists you've never heard of, and the service is absolutely top-notch.  It's a hidden gem in this neighborhood.The restaurant doesn't take reservations for small parties, but on a Friday night at 8pm, we only waited 10 minutes for two seats to open up.  We were seated at the communal table, where I rubbed elbows with my neighbors all night. Seating quarters are cramped. You've been warned!Bad news first: the restaurant was all out of Pig's Head, which was a bit disappointing since Yelpers rave about that dish (Looking at you, Xavier!). Good news: we ordered the Tandoori Lamb Belly, which looked so delectable when plated, everyone's eyes were focused on our food for a good 10 minutes.  The entree is designed to be consumed by two people, but I cannot fathom how two people could finish all that food.  The Lamb Belly is intensely rich and fatty.  One bite and you've pretty much filled up on your cholesterol and caloric intake for the day.  It comes with a side of watermelon chili lime salad.  The crisp flavor of the watermelon helped sooth the fattyness pooling up in my mouth.As for drinks, we paired the lamb with the Gouden Corolus Dark Ale upon our server's recommendation.  He knew his ish, because it was one of the tastiest beers I've had in a while.   The restaurant also sells the beer it serves, so I will be picking up some for at-home revelries.Now for the best news: Service is what bumps this to a 5 star review.  The staff is friendly, so welcoming, and so knowledgeable about the dishes, the beer pairings, and so forth.  It made my experience that much more enjoyable, and I'm definitely going to be a returning diner.PS. This would be a great spot for a gentlemen's chat over charcuterie and beer. In my mind, that's the male equivalent of a girls' gossip fest over cocktails and tapas.",18,8,13

Everything gets cooked out of this small space in the middle of the restaurant. It's definitely a different type of dining. Think tapas but lots of meat!

That said, the cocktails are not good (actually, they're terrible) and I know they're only $14 which for Midtown is UNHEARD of, but honestly, I'd rather pay $18 and have it be full strength and full taste.We had a few cocktails here to give them a good try, but the flavor combinations in their own concoctions were off - trust me, the rum one (Tikki the Hut?) was all kinds of wrong and served with a slice of cheese. Not a pleasant taste combo, even though rum good, cheese good, together - NOT. The Strawberry Vesper tastes like balsamic vinegar, good for salad, bad in this. Best of the bunch was a Whiskey Cobbler but it's still at best a C+. So, to give them a fair chance we tried classics - the martini was not stirred down enough so it just tasted of cheap vodka and all the alcohol burn. Bleurgh. Anyone who messes something this simple either doesn't know what to do, or doesn't care. I really wanted to love it since I like Cannibal but don't really drink beer, and this is super close to my office, but I didn't.

198,Dat N.,"Springfield, VA",40,87,32,5.0,9/9/2016,"Struck out twice on a Sunday night (dining wise) so ended up giving this joint a try. And so glad I did. No tables available upon walk up but grabbed a couple seats at the bar. Bartender was friendly and cordial - though slightly awkward in conversation - but it was more charming than a turnoff. Ordered an excellent porter and examined what turned out to be a deceivingly overwhelming one-page menu. One could create a million combinations from the variety of meat-centric delicacies:  do I indulge in some house charcuterie and if so, do I go with something like lardo or stick with cured hams? Do I order a bar snack like chicharron or add some vitamins to my meal via salad, beans or cauliflower? Ooh, they have whole roasted pork head on the menu! Oh they have bone marrow! Oh my god, look at that whole crispy chicken the person next to me ordered!Kept the bartender waiting longer than I feel is acceptable before finally making up our minds. Sampled three cheeses of the chef's choice. The standout was a sheep's milk cheese from Spain. Funky and assertive, salty and sharp - very delicious. The other two were interchangeable. My one gripe was the accompanying jams. Wish they were served on the side instead of under each cheese. It would have been nice to appreciate each cheese individually.The pork head tostada was simple and delicious. Rich, chewy meat playing off the herb (cilantro) and crunch of a freshly fried tortilla. Every so often, I'd get a gnarly bite that resembled bone or cartilage, but couldn't determine if it was from the meat or the tortilla. Either way, it didn't stop me from cleaning the plate.The salad we got was just to offer some ruffage to cut the fat and it did much more than that. It was appropriately dressed and well-seasoned. But nothing special. My morcilla (blood sausage) was awesome. Much better than a similar offering at DBGB. Fresh with just the right texture -- not too cakey, not too chewy. Rustic and flavorful with a nice snap to the casing. Also enjoyed the additional textures from the garnishes.Beer list was excellent.This place is going on the list for a foodie date-night or for those quiet evenings with good friends (who have adventurous palates and no dietary restrictions).",1,,
