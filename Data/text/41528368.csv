0,Winnie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",354,4,14,4.0,11/19/2018,"Cute cafe and a nice study spot!! Their desserts are absolutely beautiful but definitely on the sweeter side. I tried three of their items listed below""Frozen S'mores"": Tastes as good and as sweet as it looks. The thin layer of roasted sugar coupled with the inner soft marshmallow is ""Cotton-Soft Cheesecake"": Much lighter flavor compared to the s'mores and other cakes. I would've like it more if the cheese flavor was stronger but it was still good overall.""Paris New York"": Peanut butter/Chocolate flavored cake with donut-like texture. Not my personal favorite but still a flavor worth trying!",,,
1,Roger K.,"Redwood City, CA",74,162,236,5.0,11/16/2018,"CRONUTS!  I can't believe these are still a thing.  After all these years, I guess they're sticking around (and I'm glad they are).  I've tried my share of cronuts over the years and these guys just get it right.  Love the flavors.  Also had a an almond croissant and canelé.  Perfectly baked and moist.  of man, I wish I had come back a second day for more baked goodies.  A definite stop if you're in the neighborhood.  There is seating out back, but it's kind of busy, all the time.  So maybe grab a ton of things to go and pig out in the comfort of your own home (or hotel).",,,
2,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,11/10/2018,"The cronut is all I ever wanted from here ever since I heard of it a few years ago. I finally made it on a frigid weekend day. At 10am, there wasn't much of a line and they had not sold out yet. October flavor of the day was cranberry jam and pistachio ganache. Cranberry jam was a filling that was not too sweet and a nice balance with the pistachio. Overall I really enjoyed the cronut and it's worth trying once. Worth coming back if I see a flavor I like!",1,,
3,Henry M.,"New York, NY",128,419,951,2.0,10/31/2018,"For those wondering, the Cronut line is barely a thing now.  You no longer have to line up for hours to get a Cronut.  Realizing this, I finally went to try a Cronut and I ended up leaving quite disappointed.I arrived at 7:50am for an 8:00am opening and was 10th in line.  I had my Cronut in hand by 8:10.  The flavor changes monthly and was ""cranberry jam & pistachio ganache"" the day I was there.  They looked a lot better than they tasted.My Cronut was pretty uninspired.  The texture was not at all what I was expecting.  I thought it'd be this delicate crispy experience, almost like a San Francisco morning bun.  It's hard to describe the texture, but it was bordering on ""stale"".  It was a bit more greasy than I'd have liked and the layers were not crispy at all on the inside.  It was difficult to eat as the filling in the center kept trying to squirt out.  The filling itself was way too sweet for my liking.  As a whole, it just didn't come together.  Cranberry and pistachio seems like a slam dunk combination, with tart cranberry being offset by nutty pistachio.  Instead, it just became something that tasted like sweet on sweet on greasy.I should have tried a DKA, but went instead for the ""Lime me up tart"" (a key lime tart).  There was nothing special about the tart at all.  It was difficult to eat because the tart crust was tough and hard to cut without making a mess.  It had some sort of caramel powder on top and the sign said to squeeze the lime onto it to make an instant sauce.  I squeezed the lime on top, but not quite sure much of a sauce was made.  The taste was, again, too sweet.As I got up to the register, I was trying to choose between the key lime tart and the carrot cake.  I asked the person at the register and her reply was a flat, ""I don't like either of them.""  I guess she saw my blank stare, because she qualified that with, ""I'm allergic"".  I'm not quite sure what her allergy was to make both key lime tart and carrot cake ineligible choices (maybe gluten or dairy?), but as the face of the bakery, she could have had a more pleasant response.I guess I should come back to try a DKA and a frozen s'mores, but this experience was so subpar that I'm in no hurry to return.",1,,
4,Christine B.,"Mesa, AZ",53,196,215,4.0,10/17/2018,"There's been a lot of hype about this place. They are known for the Cronut, Frozen S'mores, Blossoming Hot Chocolate, etc. Maybe because expectations were so high, I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be. Although I like hot chocolate, paying $7.50 for a cup with a blossoming marshmallow on top seemed absurd, even for New York. Here's what we did get:*Coconut chocolate croissant- Very good. The coconut filling wasn't overly sweet or overpowering.*Pain au Chocolat- Good quality chocolate.*Almond croissant- I usually love these at other places, but didn't care for this one at all.*Cronut- Maybe it was the flavor of the day (Cranberry Pistachio) but everyone in the family was underwhelmed. *DKA- my husband thought it was ""fine"" but not amazing.Four stars for being a good bakery overall, but don't go in expecting to be wowed.",2,1,3

Updated review","So I made my comeback trip to NYC and came to Dominique Ansel's again. Overall it was a better experience. The cronuts again were delicious!This month's flavor was:Cranberry Pistachio, filled with cranberry jam and pistachio ganacheI was pretty disappointed with the ham and cheese croissant. I got there at 10:15am and the ham and cheese were really cold. I asked if it could be warmed and the girl at the counter said ""no, that's just how it comes"". I understand it may come cold, but I thought it was lame they couldn't warm it up for me. And at 6 something dollars is not reasonable to pay. Also, I never received any gift card in the mail from the owner to give my wife for her awful experience the first time she went several months ago (see original review). It's been over 3 months since that experience and they had ample time to send one to her. That was really a huge let down, especially when the owner reached out to me and said he'd send one. Anyways, I'll raise the review to a 4 star because the experience was a little better.Hard to justify a 5 Star though when they wouldn't warm a ham and cheese croissant for me and the owner never sent the gift card he said he would 3+ months ago",,,

Updated review","My fiancé and I went to Dominique Ansel Bakery for hot chocolate and pastries. My fiancé pointed out a coconut, chocolate croissant, and I wanted the beautiful turkey dessert. We also ordered two small hot chocolates. We sat down and my fiancé stated that his croissant didn't have any chocolate or coconuts. I told him to rip it in half and taste it. He said that it tasted like almonds. Obviously, he gave us the wrong croissant. I told the worker that we didn't get the correct croissant and she said ""But it looks like you've already ate it. We can't give you another one"". I was literally baffled at how ridiculous that statement was. First of all, it was not eaten. I'd never embarrass myself and present an eaten croissant. That's just stupid. Anyways, I went to the front and I told the lady that she must've gave me the incorrect croissant and she said ""OMG I have been mixing them up all day. You're the second person. Keep this one and I'll give you the correct one right now."" I think they should work on their customer service. I understand that some customers might be weird and try to complain to get free shit. But that's not always the case. If my receipt says ""coconut whatever"" and I have an almond croissant...how is that okay??",2,1,1
7,Wei C.,"Markham, Canada",465,219,1846,4.0,9/23/2018,"One of the must try foodie places we really wanted to try when we were in New York last month was Dominique Ansel Bakery and specifically the Cronut.  For a few years now I just wanted to know what the f*ck is a Cronut?   Croissant?? Donut???  I just don't know but it tastes so good!!Located in a trendy Soho, Dominique Ansel Bakery became famous for his Cronut creation but is now known for so many other creations such as their DKA Dominique's Kouign Aman,  Frozen Smore's and the Chocolate Chip Cookie Shot!  The items are extremely time and labour intensive thus is reflective in their price.  There's also a fantastic looking soup and sandwich menu but the stars here are definitely the desserts. The bakery is small but cozy and warm.  We really loved our experience when we were here and hope to come back again.4/5",16,4,13
8,Valerie C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",98,61,146,5.0,10/4/2018,"This is one of my musts when visiting NYC. Yea there is gonna be a wait, and there is a chance you might not get a cronut on a Saturday at 3pm. But you know what, I'm here for the DKA, and nothing can deter me!!! Omg those babies are beyond delicious and they are like CRACK for my sweet tooth. If you haven't tried their Amann, please please get them and you will not regret it, i promise. On this visit, I also got their cronuts- fig strudel is the flavor of the month. Maybe not my favorite flavor, but their cronuts are legit! Perfectly layered but not heavy, flaky and not overwhelmingly sweet. I love everything s'mores, so naturally I ordered the frozen s'mores. It's made to order and they torch it right in front of you. It's definitely cute to look at and fun to eat. But it's one of those things that you order for the novel experience, do it for the 'gram kinda thing. Lastly I also got a fat Macadamia cookie(with sea salt I think). Sadly i forgot all about it and didn't eat it til 2 days later. It was meh, but probably coz it was an old cookie. My own fault.",1,1,1
9,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,9008,5.0,9/18/2018,"Here's what you should do. 1. Forget the cookie shot. It's gimmicky and while tasty enough, it ends up being a soggy cookie that's unwieldy to eat.2. Forget the Cronut. Well, it's worth trying at least once, especially if the flavor is one you're into, but it's crazy rich and you have to get up before noon to get one, and getting up before noon seems silly.3. Get the Frozen S'mores. I like anything with a blowtorch, especially if it's an insanely delicious dessert on a stick.4. Get the DKA. It's basically pastry perfection.5. Get something savory. Ham and cheese croissant, egg sandwiches, etc.Take these goodies into the backyard, and rejoice.",29,12,23
10,Biana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",424,71,57,5.0,10/20/2018,"Everything from the quality of the coffee to the deliciousness of each pastry makes Dominique Ansel one of my favorite bakeries in Manhattan. While I admit, I did stand on line and wait for the chocolate chip cookie shots, I do not think I would do that again. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu from the Madelines to the S'mores or Cronuts, so my suggestion is to come at an off peak time and enjoy. I particularly like visiting the bakery in the fall or spring to indulge in my coffee and dessert in the quaint patio garden. Prices are on the more expensive end of things, but what can you expect... you're paying for quality and presentation in Manhattan. Definitely check this spot out!",,,

This place has made a name for itself and their service is great.  They realize they are busy every hour of the day but treat each and everyone of their customers with care and appreciation.  I found a table to sit down after walking to the bakery and found it a nice ambiance to get work done, read a book or people watch.I look forward to pre ordering the Cronut and getting my hands on it finally.",,,
12,Steven B.,"Boston, MA",27,153,887,5.0,9/15/2018,"Dominique Ansel Bakery is always a place I stop at when I'm in SOHO.On this Thursday morning, I slept in and was not going to be getting a Cronut. Or so I thought! A tray of circular, doughnut-shaped, pink-frosted delectables was sitting behind the counter. I asked if those were Cronuts? They are. Yes, I'll take one. Perhaps the days of waiting in line at 7 am for this coveted baked good over? Fig Cronut September 2018:I love figs! And the fig jam and streusel ganache was a flavor I was interested in trying, so I was very happy to get my hands on one. Nice chewy crust. Frosting on top is fruity. Sweet jammy inside. The entire Cronut is coated in a raw-like sugar, giving some crunchy texture. Chewy like a croissant, but has a tougher skin. So, you need to bite and tear a little bit here. Dough is fried which gives it a nice golden color. Flakey layered inside. No oily flavor like a doughnut though. The dough has a clean buttery croissant flavor. The question a lot of folks ask is if the Cronut® is worth the wait. Depends on the flavor, so check the monthly flavor. Also depends on your personality. If you feel your time is valuable then maybe don't wait in line, just get a DKA. But, if you're like me, it's worth the wait at least once. Maybe not twice. Honestly, the hype and marketing behind the Cronut are a bit extra. So if this line situation is over--good. Now, some folks say the DKA is the better, but less marketable cousin of the Cronut. I may very well agree with that sentiment. Ugly. Looking like a muffin that fell into the deep-fryer. Delicious. The most outstanding flakey caramel crust. Soft, chewy, sweet, buttery interior. Dense, layered, buttery. Addicting!Another readily available item is the Chocolate Caramel Mousse Cake. The presentation and form are quite lovely. The mousse is formed into a spiraling waterdrop. Rich and light chocolate mousse. Moist coffee soaked devil's food cake. Caramel bavarois, which is like an egg custard/whipped cream, It adds a creamy nuance to the situation. The mousse and the dense mouthfeel of the buttery caramel are superb and a call to pause for indulgence. A hazelnut ""feuilletine""  on the bottom lends not only a base of support but an excellent layer of nutty complexity and crunchy textural nuance when eaten in tandem with the mousse.Dominique Ansel Bakery is absolutely worth making a journey to.",3,,1
13,Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",4062,939,2679,5.0,8/27/2018,"I had never heard of Dominique Ansel Bakery until they opened a location at The Grove in Los Angeles. After visiting that location I wasn't super impressed, but this place has grown on me. I had to take my NYC friend here for some pastries on my most recent visit. Okay, so i was a little disappointed that the bakery didn't look like the one at the grove. This location certainly has that older NYC vibe and look. We went in the afternoon, so they were out of their famous Cronuts. That's okay though, I made it back home to LA in time to have one of their August Cronuts at the Grove location. My friend and I shared an Almond Croissant. I'll tell you right now that their Almond Croissant is probably one of the best you'll ever have. I highly recommend getting this. After relaxing over a croissant and lemonade, we headed back out into the streets to be tourists again. My friend, who lives in Jersey City had to buy a couple more Almond Croissants to go for her parents. It really is that GOOOOD! So moist and amazing!The bakery looks small, but keep walking towards the back. You'll find more and more seating. Oh yea, what's up with the bathroom. It's in a super odd location and very small. When people are waiting for the bathroom, they end up blocking the entire area.",22,10,21

Updated review","I never thought I would write a review about something like this, but I wasn't too happy about what happened today.  Well to start with the cronut for this month's flavor was pretty good (fig with some cream I think).Then, I also ordered an almond croissant to take it home for lunch tomorrow.  Then when I was about to leave I found that I was given a regular croissant but not almond croissant.  In my numerous visits of 5 years this never happened, so I went to the cashier and asked to change it to an almond croissant.  Well, my bad was that I never checked the receipt and the good, but again, I never had this issue before so I didn't even think about it (she made a transaction for a regular croissant). The cashier who I made the transaction from asked for the receipt which I wasn't sure I still had because I usually throw it away right after I get it.  Then someone else who looked like more senior person just told the cashier to give the almond croissant but wouldn't take the regular croissant because it was already out to me.  Then I found my receipt so went back to pay the difference but that senior person was like we already gave you the almond croissant so that's fine.  No sorry.  Not apologetic at all.  It made me look like someone who wanted to squeeze a free product out of it from the vibe I had from them and I was actually quite upset.  especially after the cashier asked me twice before the transaction and I told her almond croissant to confirm.  I don't know why I should be treated like this after coming to this bakery consistently since it opened in 2013.",3,2,

Updated review","Really really good cookies. I got the cookie shot glasses to go and the milk came in small containers which was fine, but I'd recommend eating those shot glasses there.

16,Kylie B.,"Louisville, KY",116,40,58,5.0,9/6/2018,While in New York City this bakery came highly recommended and did not disappoint. Despite being super busy the line moved quickly and the service was great. They even had a cute outside sitting area.The cronut was amazing. It was everything people had said it would be and then more. It is flakey like a croissant and fried like a donut. The flavor for the month of August was key lime and it was great. It wasn't over powering like most key lime flavored things are. The eclair and the DKA was delicious as well. You seriously can not go wrong here. If you're in the big Apple you should totally visit.,1,,1
17,Aishwarya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,74,129,5.0,9/12/2018,"The cronut is delicious just like everyone told me it was. I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Septermber 2018 flavor cronut - Fig Streusel. It was not too sweet but definitely fattening but which yummy dessert isnt? I came here to get a birthday cake for my mom and we got a chocolate mouse decorated with Macron cake (forgot the actual name of it) and it was delicious, my mom loved it. So did my dad who kept stealing all the macrons!Since we were there to get the cake we decided to buy the cronut since this is the place that brought the item. I've heard a lot of people didnt get a chance to have a cronut becausethey were sold out. I was lucky because I came at 2pm on a tuesday when it was raining. The timing was perfect. The line was small, around 10 people before us and we got what we wanted in maybe 15 minutes. Theres seatings in the back of the store, inside and outside. The outside is like a backyard, small and cozy.They had another unique and delicious desserts but I'm trying to watch my weight so it took a lot of self control to say no to guy at the store who kept tempting me to try other desserts. The employees here are nice and are really good at convincing you to buy more desserts. They are forceful, it's just the desserts they tell you to eat them and a little nudge from the employees may make you lose all self control. If you're not watching your weight or have diabetes, go for it eat everything  you're gonna love it.",,,1

19,Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4699,2638,17919,4.0,8/10/2018,"If you go to Dominique Ansel Bakery, you will most definitely encounter a line. How long that line is varies with many dependent factors. My friend and I first tried popping in for some snacks on a Sunday during the day. The line was not just out the door, but down the block nearly passed the next block. We waited 5 minutes and when we didn't move an inch, rolled out. Now when we went back on a weekday about 3pm, we were golden. Not only did we encounter a much shorter line, only spanning the length of the store inside but we were able to snag two seats inside. We basically hit the jackpot! So prepare yourself for a wait and decide how long is too long before you brave the neatly organized straight line of humans.If you are a pastry person, this is a shop you must try. The namesake chef Dominique Ansel was named  World's Best Pastry Chef last year...think about that for a second, it's a huge feat! He invents creative delicacies while not losing the tasty flavor we've all come to know and love in our sweets & carbs. Example One: The Cronut. You know it. You love it. This hybrid croissant donut was created by this chef and has become a culinary sensation. If you're coming to his bakery, get the flagship item . You won't regret it. Pro-Tip though: They absolutely sell out each day, so the earlier you come for this flaky treat, the better. $6 each.Example Two: The ""DKA"". This is another signature item standing for Dominique's Kouign Amann, and similarly to the cronut can sell out on any given day but not at quite the same frequency. This was actually the first Kouign Amann I had ever had which is a crusty little cake and I enjoyed it. My understanding is the Dominique Ansel version is less sugary, less buttery & intended to be more light than the typical one. Definitely an enjoyable breakfast type pastry! $5.50 each.Example Three: Cookie Shots! These are only available after 3pm but man are they fun. The little shotglass is made of warm chocolate chip cookie and then filled with fancy schmancy Tahitian vanilla bean milk. These are served to order! When I ordered this, logic escaped me and I waited for my friend a couple minutes and the shotglass started to fall apart due to being soaked in milk. Duh. So quickly snap your photos of this & consume ASAP! It's a fun & cute little treat. $4.25 each. Example Four: Frozen S'mores! This is another one you need to eat fairly quickly as it's a tasty honey marshmellow stuffed with Tahitian vanilla ice cream & chocolate wafer crisps. These are made to order, as they are served on a smoked willow branch and torched right when you get them. $7.25 each.If you're following the pattern here, fun & inventive items that are so unique to this pastry chef can be found here, as well as many classics (the menu is huge) and even lunch items. Everything we had was great in flavor, as well.If you plan on dining at the bakery, head to the back to their cute garden space. Oh~so~instagrammable! (Gag-a-licious, I know).Other things I didn't get to try that I'd love to in the future - their new Burrata flavor and Watermelon flavor (not combined) soft serves. Yum! It was a pretty warm day when I went so didn't get to try the Blossoming Hot Chocolate but that looks beautiful & sounds delicious. All in all, Dominique Ansel is a must try spot and next time I'm in NYC, I'll absolutely be back!",25,9,14

My friends and I stopped by after brunch around 2 PM and to our delight - there were still cronuts available for walk in purchase. We were able to order two ($6.53/cronut including tax) and it was so delicious! The cronut itself was still crispy yet chewy and the abundant filling was one of my favorite parts! This month's flavor was fig jam and streusel ganache but I wasn't told this by the workers as I had to go look it up on my IG so I kept trying to guess what I was tasting. The ganache was definitely my favorite as it was super aromatic but I had a hard time distinguishing the fig flavor from the jam. I'll definitely be back to try the other goodies though!!,,,
24,Jessalyn P.,"Stockton, CA",533,31,986,5.0,10/7/2018,"No visit to New York is complete without visiting Dominique Ansel Bakery!Located in the fashionable Soho district, this hip and trendy bakery has everything a sweet tooth connoisseur and others would appreciate. Much like myself. I was in heaven! DKA is the unsung hero and is definitely a must try! It's not as well known as the Cronuts but boy was it DELICIOUS! The flaky buttery layers gave you the perfect bite each time! Don't leave there without grabbing some to go. Even hours later, it was still crunchy and taste just as fresh. The Chocolate Chip Cookie shot was just ok. A bit overrated IMO. It's one of those things where you should try out for the experience. However, it's nothing special. Plus the milk warms up quickly from the freshly baked cookies so don't let it stand for too long while you're trying to snap the perfect photo. The Frozen S'more and Blossoming Hot Chocolate are both aesthetically pleasing but like the cookie shot, it was ok. Not something I'd come back for. Sadly, I didn't have the pleasure of trying the Cronuts due to it being sold out on two separate visits. Ambiance is bright and welcoming albeit, crowded. There are plenty of seating towards the back with a charming garden for you to enjoy your sweets! A complimentary water station is provided. Tips: Cronuts sale out quickly. Either pre-order or get there early. Preferably before noon to ensure you get your share. Flavor changes monthly and are never repeated. The place is pricey but well worth the journey!",185,78,175

The chai latte was a bit watery and will not be ordering that again. The sea salt caramel eclair was delicious with the right about of salt. The ratio of cream to pastry was perfect. The pumpkin pie had a great flavor but I prefer my filling to be a bit more solid. The pastry was a perfect flakiness and the cheese helped balance all the sweetness from the other goodies. I'll definitely be back as they have so many things to try!

28,Kelly C.,"New York, NY",12,86,63,3.0,10/16/2018,"Like everyone else, I was brought here by the novelty of getting a cronut from the place where it originated. Each month there is a new ""featured"" flavor, though every flavor that I've had has been too sweet for my palate. However, I will admit that the DAB cronut is less oily and more balanced than cronuts I've had elsewhere. Personally I like the DKAs much more than the cronuts. Do people still wait in line for a cronut? No idea. Would I wait in line for one? No, and I'm glad that I never had to. I highly recommend planning in advance and ordering online.

29,Zenda D.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",201,131,174,5.0,10/26/2018,"I finally made it to this wonderful pastry establishment!I've been dying to try the cronut for like ever and the first day I get there....they are out of cronuts =(. The very lovely cashier made my day with her suggestion to try the DKT...she explained it as something like the cronut. I settled and trusted her word, I loved the dkt it was a buttery, flaky, yummy treat. I also tried the maple pecan french toast pastry she suggested that was also very yummy. I stopped back in this past Monday right before my shift and got the cronut, there was no line and I was in and out. The cashier wasn't as lovely, but I was super happy to finally try the cronut. I loved it and shared it with two of my colleagues, it was so rich I believe I got the pistachio cranberry cronut which came to 6$. It was one of the best 6$'s I've ever spent. You can tell they put a lot of tender love & care in their pastries, which sets them apart from the rest. Will definitely be back.",,,
30,Elizabeth D.,"Queens, NY",143,122,150,3.0,11/4/2018,"Not sure what the big deal is about these cronuts. I came here on a Saturday morning and the line was pretty short around noon. After about a 15-20 minute wait I came in and got the custard and sweet potato ganache cronut ($6). It comes in a cute yellow orange box, which is pretty nice. There is open seating in the back and I was lucky that there were a lot of open seating options. There is water and utensils in the back too.Now for the cronut. It's flaky and delicious, as promised, but nothing out of the ordinary. It honestly just tasted like an eclair to me (I guess that's the closest thing I could compare it to). It's definitely not worth waiting those lines to try though, certainly nothing life changing. I was disappointed because custard and sweet potato ganache sounded so cool and unique but it only tasted like a custard filled pastry. If I ever go back, which I doubt I will, I would try maybe some of their smaller unique cakes and pastries that are lined up on display.",,,
31,Trina D.,"Orange County, CA",764,2184,8145,5.0,9/27/2018,"A visit to New York meant that we had to visit the bakery that started the cronut craze. Granted, I've been to Dominque Ansel's bakery in LA at the Grove and even met the man himself. It didn't diminish our desires to pick up the cronut of the month from Dominique Ansel Bakery in Soho. My friend and I made our way over to Spring Street and picked up our preordered dozen cronuts. Yes, you can preorder so you don't need to wait in the line. Guess what, we went on a Wednesday morning around 10 am and there was no line. I guess it depends on when you visit. Do it on a weekday, during a non-peak time and you should be fine. The cronut flavor of the month was fig & streusel. Since there wasn't a terribly long line (one person ahead of us), we decided to grab breakfast while we were there. By the way, preorders don't need to wait in line but I'm not sure where you could go up and bypass the line seeing as there were two registers and it seemed to intersect haphazardly. I ordered a cappuccino and ham & cheese croissant while my friend ordered the blooming hot chocolate and the raspberry Pavlova. My ham and cheese croissant was fresh and not too salty. The croissant was flaky yet soft. The cappuccino was perfect. It had the right amount of airiness and flavor. There is a small patio in the back of the bakery with indoor and outdoor seating. I tried my friend's pavlova and it was magnificent. The pavlova also had lychee cream inside and it was so light yet decadent. The blooming hot chocolate's marshmallow failed to bloom properly. Oh well, it was still good. If you're in the area, you should definitely stop by for a treat. Their cronut flavors rotate monthly and they never feature the same flavor twice. The fig & streusel flavor was really good and I'm not usually a fig person. The cronut has flaky layers of pastry with a cream bursting from inside. It was really good. I just can't finish one on my own but I tried. I'm so glad we got to visit this location. I should have asked for a passport while I was there but I'm sure I'll be back someday.",9,8,9

33,Christine G.,"Santa Clara, CA",288,317,588,4.0,11/8/2018,"Experience here can be hit or miss depending on what you order. They do a lot of things really well and others are just fun unique concepts that fall a little flat flavorwise but are Instagram gold. However when it comes to skill DA bakery always executes amazingly. I mean a blooming hot cocoa??? So amazing. I wouldn't even mind if it just was okay.*Note: I've been here 2 different times years apart and the quality has stayed.Eats:Mini madelines 5/5 FRESH. You really can't beat this, they are soft, crisp, buttery pieces of fluffy gold.Frozen smores 5/5 I honestly liked this a lot. It's a cool (pun unintended haha) concept and tasty! And the fact that it's seared oona Willow stick actually gives it woodsy smoke flavor just as a real campfire would! Flavors are subtle though so I could see people not enjoying it.Canele 4/5 Not my favorite but Mo loves these and DA does them really well. Perfectly executed with a crisp outside and tender fluffy center but nothing mind blowing.Kouign Amann 5/5 No two KAs are the same. And at every bakery they will be slightly different. DA's Kouign Amann is less sticky more crisp and buttery flaky. All the same concept so still delicious just again more subtle flavors.Pain de chocolate: Chocolate is dark and rich with flaky pastry. Delicious even hours later. Mo and I took one of these babies togo and split it on a park bench after walking around all day.Atmosphere: 5/5Cute, welcoming and the back room seating is always nicely decorated for the season.Service: 4/5Eating in is one of the toughest experiences to do since it's always crowded. And the staff have 0 time to accommodate or help if someone is ""holding"" a table when they haven't even ordered yet, even with signage NOT to do so. Also the busboy was on the phone not paying attention 99% of the time so many tables don't get cleared right away. Mo and I had to grab a table with plates and coffee cups all over it and we cleared the table ourselves. Only reason this isn't 5/5 since they are a well established business and should have small things like this in hand.Overall definitely flavors are softer and subtle at DA and may not suit some palates. Will be back when in NYC again and maybe one day for the hell of it I'll wait in line for a DA cronut LOL.",1,1,3
34,Raymond L.,"Orange County, CA",392,1140,4471,4.0,7/13/2018,"After hitting up Bibble and Sip and exploring Levain, I made my way to Dominique Ansel. I had remembered that in the Tokyo location, they had some items that were there only, but after getting dessert and having more dessert after, I kinda had to limit myself. Sob. I know. This shop is one singular line long with a few tables inside and a couple more in a ""garden"" area outside as well.I went for the Paris-New York , which is their signature twist on the Paris-Brest with chocolate, peanut butter ($7.5) and the cronut of the month Blueberry Coconut with Lemon Zest Sugar, filled with blueberry jam and coconut ganache ($6) . This was extremely heavy on the sugar side hahaha because I was fighting PB and Chocolate as well. I had wanted to get something light like the matcha passionfruit mousse cake but I knew I couldn't finish. They have a lot of desserts here so someone will find something they will like.They also had some frozen smore and some cookie shots as well but again.. too much! Sob. I got myself a blueberry cronut though. Cronuts are definitely my jam. There is a lot of filling inside and is throughout the cronut so when I was cutting it, some of it was oozing out. I didn't really get the coconut flavor because the blueberry was a bit more overpowering than it, but to each their own.I think coming here with a friend is a better option so you can get multiple and get a variety of desserts; they also have forks/knives/water for you and it was well needed for me haha. (More water!) Sitting in the garden area with a cool breeze after making my way around was a welcome change. DESSERT. Dominque Ansel. Get everything!",9,8,9
35,Juan S.,"Jersey City, NJ",107,278,196,3.0,8/13/2018,"Walked by and saw there wasn't a huge line. Thought about it and decided to finally try a cronut while the tourists aren't around. The bakery is small and chaotic. Just follow the crowd and most likely talk to a visitor. Behind the counter, they are busy. Seems like a place that doesn't slow down or stop. After waiting a bit, we ordered 2 flavor of the month cronut. Lady in the front is very nice. Left a tip. Cronut was good, a bit hard and slightly too sweet.

We arrived in the afternoon (around 4?) and noticed a huge line formed outside of the bakery. I had no idea how famous their cronuts were and they were sold out by the time we got there. When we finally got inside the bakery, I noticed how little room there was. I would recommend taking your desserts to go otherwise you'll feel very cramped. All of the desserts looked delicious but everything was pretty pricey. We ordered the fleur yogurt dessert that came out to be $7. The yogurt was light and fluffy, definitely a good change of pace from the overly sweet desserts. It was fun pushing up the yogurt and watching it turn into a flower, so you're definitely paying extra for the experience as well. I would love to go back and try their cronut to see what the hype is about!",3,,1

The cronut of the month was key lime flavored. Neither of us are huge donut fans, but this place was recommended several times over so we got two. It was really good. I didn't finish mine (too sweet for my taste), but my bf happily finished it for me. We also got a few croissants to go as they also came highly recommended!",,,

Updated review","I dislike this place more every time I come here. Somehow the cronuts still sell out when there are infinitely more worthy pastries at almost every French bakery around town.Recently stopped on a very hot day because I was tempted by the sign outside promising a refreshing frozen yogurt pop that would ""bloom"" as I ate it (the Pop Fleur).Anyways- it was essentially a whipped, semi-frozen cheesecake push pop that you had to force through a mold to eat. As you pushed it up and through the mold, ""petals"" would form which would theoretically look like a flower. Maybe a cool concept, but one that I'd expect to see in the supermarket checkout aisle rather than in a high end bakery. The plastic packaging was terribly designed so that the top kept on detaching from the rest of it when you exerted more than the tiniest bit of pressure, and even when it did work as advertised the mixture wasn't stiff enough to produce more than a 1-centimeter long ""petals"". If you tried to make them any larger, they would start falling out of the mold and making a mess.The pop itself was fine. It tasted like a plain cheesecake. It was also about 3 inches long (that's what she said?), or about 1/4 the serving of a normal mini cheesecake you'd get, by volume.Cherry on top is that this thing was about $8. I don't mind paying top dollar for good food, but this was both gimmicky and poorly executed. You can get like an entire cake for that money, and not have to worry about the entire thing falling apart as you try to eat it.Stick to the DKAs, forget the gimmicky crap.",5,2,2
39,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,4.0,10/14/2018,"Dominique Ansel Bakery is a gourmet bakery known for its original dessert, the ""cronut"". They all serve a variety of baked confections, such as DKAs (caramelized croissants), cookies, cakes, pies, etc. Things are on the pricier end, which is inline with it's quality and marketing.There's limited seating inside in the front, and there is a ""greenhouse"" in back. Service is quick and friendly. There is usually a queue that is formed; it took me about 15m to get my order through; this is quite the contrast to several years ago when there was a 3hour queue at 6AM. Service told me they usually start running out of their more popular confections mid morning.Ordered:Cronut - has raspberry and pistachio filling, with a raspberry glaze on top of the layers of buttery croissant. It's dashed with sugar. The cronut is pretty hefty, I'd only get one. I really wish it was warm or more fresh when I got this. Would have been 5* otherwise.",,1,1
40,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",12,229,363,4.0,8/3/2018,"This place has some top-notch pastries, but I would recommend you pass on the Cronut.  You can actually skip the super long line if you aren't interested in the cronut.  As long as you don't order a cronut, you can stand in a line that's a fraction of the length of the regular line, and order everything and anything except for the cronut.  We ordered some type of chocolate mousse, the July seasonal Cronut (blueberry), the Kouign Amman, the chocolate chip cookie, and a chocolate eclair.The cronut was interesting.  It was definitely delicious, but tasted just like any other donut.  The one standout thing about it though was the amount of filling in it.  I've never had a donut with so much filling that it was profusely oozing out every time you took a bite.  If you love filling, this is definitely worth getting (the filling is both a custard/ creme and a jelly type filling).  However, if you're wanting to try this because you think it will be some innovative new pastry, it mostly just tastes like an extra greasy donut, so I wouldn't really wait in line again for it.The chocolate mousse and the chocolate eclair were just as expected, good but nothing extraordinary.  The chocolate chip cookie is a seriously standout cookie though. Slightly crispy edges and a very soft, melty interior.  The Kouign Amman or the ""DKA"" was the absolute best thing we tasted.  It kind of tasted like an elephant ear/ palmier, except in the shape of muffin.  Very hard to explain, but kind of like croissant dough that had been stuffed into a muffin cup and then covered in crystallized sugar.  Super super delicious.If I came back here, I'd only get the Kouign Amman (the ""DKA"") or the chocolate chip cookie.  The excitement around the Cronut is just hype and there are far better things you could order here.",1,,

Food (5/5): I got the Chocolate Chip Cookie Shot (available after 3pm) and absolutely loovveeeddd it. The milk was slightly creamy and rich with that milky taste (plus a little chocolate thanks to the cookie shot ""glass""). The cookie was one of my favorite things (but also I have a huge soft spot for cookies, so maybe I'm just biased for any cookie). A friend and I shared the Summer Strawberry Tart and it was also very refreshing in taste. The little strawberries and the tart was not too sweet and had a good crunch that would melt in your mouth. My friend got the Frozen S'more (which I have gotten in the past and was a fan of, especially the ice cream in the middle and the aesthetic of the sugary delight) and also was positive about it. THE ONLY SETBACK: price :( my friends and I enjoyed the food, but likely wouldn't buy again due to the price, but were glad to enjoy it in the moment :)Setting (3/5): It is very cramped and if you even want to try a taste of the infamous cronut, you have to get there quite early (there were none left when I got there in the afternoon). The lines can be a bit overwhelming due to the narrow walk-way but the seating there is nice and usually empty since most take their food to-go.",1,1,1
42,Seaside living s.,"Aptos, CA",2,62,44,4.0,10/10/2018,"I'm visiting from California and had to go try a cronut, of course.  At 11am today (Weds) there were still cronuts and a wonderful assortment of baked goods.  My friend and I got a latte, a mocha, 2 cronuts and a kouign amann (sounds like queen aman).The cronut has a nice flavor, but I think the pastry layers don't hold up well to sitting with the filling in them too long.  Definitely use a fork/knife because it'll be messy with fingers.  Also just one is enough for 2 or three people to have a taste.  The kouign amann was delicious, flakey buttery layers with a nice crunch to the outside.  I wish I had more room in my belly to try more, but alas, no.The outdoor area seats maybe a dozen or so.  It's not really conducive to relaxing, as there is a playground right next door with children screaming and having fun. There was also loud construction during my visit.Definitely worth visiting, but don't fill up on cronuts, leave room to try more!",,,

45,Jenni W.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,78,203,3.0,7/15/2018,"Just randomly stumbled upon this bakery while on the way to Bloomingdale's for a return..I had heard about this place from a coworker--she's also a fellow pastry fanatic and we were talking about good pastry places and this was a recommended spot by her. I stumbled upon this place and realized that there was a line outside with around 6-7 people waiting to go inside. I got in line and waited around 15 minutes and got a cronut (since this place is known for them) and a chocolate chunk cookie. The service, I gotta say..not sure if the staff is stressed from the high demand and popularity, but they were very rude and unenthused when I asked them a question about their pastries (aka what is this since there is not a sign labeling it). Onto the actual pastry itself--I THINK there are different flavors depending on when you come and visit the bakery. When I came today, the cronut flavor was blueberry and coconut ganache. Honestly, it tasted a little dry and stale (not sure if it's because I came at 2 pm), but wasn't all that amazing to me. I also felt like the icing on top of the cronut itself made the whole cronut too sweet and I ended up picking that off. The filling oozes outside, so make sure you grab lots of napkins! The filling is slightly tart, so if you're a fan of tart/slightly sour sweets. You'll enjoy the filling. I also got a chocolate chunk cookie--and also, wasn't very impressed. It was a standard soft chocolate chunk cookie. Very average and tasty, but nothing special about it. Not sure if I'll be back. For $6 and the wait, I would expect something more delicate and fresh..",1,,

It's basically a giant deluxe marshmallow on a stick, filled with chocolate and ice cream. They toast it for you on the spot - and it's absolutely divine! This treat is a must-get here, along with the cronuts.I also tried their chocolate caramel mousse pastry, which is decorated like a mini flame.

Stopped by here on a day trip to New York because this place seemed insanely popular and all of their baked items looked delicious. As expected, we arrived to a huge line wrapping all around the sort of tight interior and outside a bit on the sidewalk. As we made our way through the line, we had time to see all of their baked goods on display and settled on a chocolate chip cookie shot and a frozen s'more, two of their top sellers.The looked great and impeccably made: the cup of cookie was sturdy but still chewy and soft enough to enjoy, while the s'more was caramelized nicely all over with a cool custardy center. Unfortunately though, they both tasted pretty average. If you take away the novelty of the cookie shot (which isn't that novel anymore as I've seen a number of other places start offering them), it was just a normal chocolate chip cookie. The warm and cool contrast of the toasted marshmallow outside with cold custard center was nice, but tastewise it wasn't that different than a normal s'more.I was super excited to come here, but unfortunately wasn't impressed.

54,Melody C.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,141,277,5.0,6/11/2018,"The boyfriend wanted to come here for the cookie shots so we did and with five other friends on a rainy Sunday. We took a gamble and drove three cars from Brooklyn to Manhattan. But it was a risk worth taking because we found tons of parking spots in the bakery's vicinity. There was a long line inside when we arrived at 5pm but the wait to place and receive order was under 15 minutes. There were small tables along the wall at the front of the shop and an indoor and outdoor garden section with seats in the back. The garden was super cute! I loved the marble tables and flower decorations. It was incredibly thoughtful of them to have water for customers at the utensils/trash station. It was very much needed to wash down all the sugar. The outdoor area had wooden circular tables and huge umbrellas. There was even a wall of fake grass. I was the designated table hoarder so I was just waiting awkwardly for a table to be free. There were seats outside but the tables with umbrellas were taken so sitting in the rain was not an option for us. A worker noticed that I was waiting for a table and kindly helped me put together tables and seats for my group of 7 by bringing in the chairs and tables from outside. He was so nice! Cookie shots (4/5): you only get a few minutes to quickly snap some pics before the milk makes the cookie too soggy. The cookie was lined with chocolate on the inside and although it wasn't like omg it was also not bad. Drinking the milk out of it was undoubtedly a very fun experience but then you're left with this cookie that becomes too much (sugar) after a couple of bites. Frozen s'mores (4/5): tbh I didn't know what to expect. My first thought was, 'I love s'mores but frozen?' The marshmallow had a caramelized layer on top which made it even more aesthetically pleasing but unnecessarily sweeter than it needed to be. The marshmallow itself was lukewarm. But on the inside, there were some sort of chocolate crumbs wrapped around the ice cream, which was cold. So incredibly unique. There wasn't a lot of ice cream and chocolate crumbs inside. TLDR; super cute place, workers were attentive and helpful, food was out of the box and yummy but gets overwhelmingly sweet after a couple of bites. I would totally come back to try the other items but not get the items that I've already tried before because $$$ and once was enough.",1,1,3

Came here in an attempt to acquire one of the famed Cronuts. But alas - no dice! :(I had a back up plan though, and that worked out to perfection!1 almond croissant, fresh out of the oven. This was delicious! Flaky, moist, and flavourful. 1 DKA that was spectacular, and likely every bit as good as a cronut. This is a total winner, and Ansel made a solid choice by banking on this one. 1 rhubarb macaron that was unfortunately not a win and not worth the price. It wasn't bad, but when another ultra famous macaron founding company is just around the corner, this is not the item to try at Ansel's spot. Overall, the line moved quickly, the pastries were worth it, and I will be back again and again until I finally score a cronut!",,,

They had us at ""Burrata Ice Cream"" and the people sitting in front with these watermelon-shaped plates holding what was a watermelon sorbet.After walking inside and basking in the smell of fresh French pastries, we knew everything was made fresh and on the spot. Through the clear glass, pastry chefs dolloped fresh custard right in front of us. We ordered what was recommended ""the DKA"" - what I would describe as a buttery caramelized croissant/donut treat and a Lavender Almond Croissant. We ended up eating them for breakfast the next morning, but they tasted fresher than ever. Both were exquisite and I'm not even a sweets person!! Onto the ice cream! Through an outdoor window was the opportunity to sample burrata ice cream (with a basil balsamic glaze) and a water melon sorbet. These homemade treats exploded with authentic flavour and were our saving grace for what was a hot NYC day. They have something great going here - it was the perfect expected stop of the day.",,,

Petite little bites of heaven truly. I sampled the carrot cake but honestly was not a fan of the gelatinous coating. As pretty as it looked with it's gold flakes I really would rather prefer a traditional carrot cake even if it doesn't have cream cheese icing. As I was going to eat some of this in my car I also got an iced chai latte and was disappointed to find out only once I started driving that it didn't have any sugar in it. Everywhere else they put sugar so I guess I simply didn't think of it. The cronuts were AMAZING of course, and were even better once I got home and refrigerated them because it was a very hot day and the dulce filling sort of crept through the cronut, where once it was gold it held it together more and made it for easier bites without tearing it. Overall I will definitely come back one day perhaps, and next time add my own sugar to the chai =P",1,1,2

65,Willy M.,"Seattle, WA",491,849,1865,4.0,4/18/2018,"If you decide to come here to get breakfast, try not to wake up late on a weekend. This bakery is wonderful but the lines are long, I mean pretty darn long, especially on a weekend. On Sunday they open at 9am, but we got there about 10am. ""Oh look no line""......WRONG........the line starts about 2 doors down from the bakery, at the basketball court fence. So we took the dreaded & harrowing walk to the back of the line that was about 25 or so deep.  We waited about 45 mins til we got in, but when waiting they tried to comfort the wait by bringing out samples to eat, give updates on how much longer, would bring in certain number of people at a time into the bakery. There's a sign at the front of the line that explains some instructions on how to order when you get inside. (only allowed 2 Cronuts per person)I didn't know this was where the Cronut started, since I've never had one, we had to get one. They only do flavors of the month for the Cronut selections, so the selection was Rhubarb Rose w/ Mascarpone. I rarely eat any rhubarbs or roses, but to me it tasted pretty darn good. Yup, a cronut is a cross between a donut & croissant, that's what I tasted and seemed like to me. The texture was awesome, flavor wasn't super strong nor was it bland, it was just good.  We also got the popular ""DKA"", that is where it's at!!!  DKA is so good! It's just bread, but looks like a donut in a way or a plain cronut. The layers are amazing and probably would've eaten half a dozen if a could. Just get it!We also tried the ""Cannele de Bordeaux( I think that's what it's called), it's kind of like a cookie and a brownie, maybe. Looks super chocolatey but it wasn't. This was also very tasty and worth trying in my book.  What I like about the items we had was the texture, it's soft, flaky, light, and ever so loving when it hits your mouth. Prices are quite pricey so be prepared to cash out some of your 401k. Staff was friendly, helpful and efficient, they know it's a busy place so they work hard to make sure everyone is where they need to be especially those who think they are very important and try to sneak in and cut the line. There's a line coordinator on weekends so they know who was where. Overall a wonderful bakery with all kinds of tasty treats, there are a lot more items for breakfast than just pastries, menu is good sized, it's busy so expect that, tables are limited but there are ledges to stand & eat, glad we came by and felt it was worth the wait but who likes waiting.",16,9,17

The latte, was the best coffee I have ever had. Not too strong, just right. The Cronut was perfection, stuffed with cream and strawberry jam, people kept bumping into me, and it was stuffy but nothing mattered because this Cronut is the best dessert I've had in a long tine.

So my friend and I stopped by on a hot-as-heck weekday afternoon, to find a very short line.The tarts in the case were like jewels, there's really no other way to describe them. Beautiful.We didn't see the cronuts, but that's because they were not making it to the case - out of the oven, into the bags. Note that there's a cronut limit or two per person.I gotta say - the cronut was good, but not life-changing. The coconut/berry cream filling was a bit cloying, TBH.The kouign amann might very well be the better choice.",,1,1

One gave us a sample of lemonade, it was refreshing and sweet. Another gave us a fresh madeleine. Dominique Ansel himself greeted us and introduced us to a french guest baker.I ordered 2 cronuts, September's flavor was fig streusel, 20 madeleines, a frozen s'more and a coconut chocolate croissant.The frozen s'more was made to order, it was good, just very sweet. I let the other 3 in my party take a bite then, I wouldn't have been able to eat it all myself. The cronut is heaven. Layers of flaky pastry that are crunchy outside but soft inside with a delicious cream filling. It was amazing. Completely worth waiting for and I will go back.

The Cronut varieties change monthly, so boredom is never an issue.The servers are courteous, quick, and helpful. While waiting in (a short) line last pick-up, it's hard not to look around at all the other pastries and not want to further your indulgence - from the cookie dough shots, ice cream treats, and the peanut buttery delights, like the Blackberry Peanut Butter Rum Bostock (think cakey PB&J sandwich - omg) that I managed to finagle into my Cronut pick-up process.What can I say, this place continues to live up to the hype.",2,,1

We tried the world-famous Cronut (raspberry edition), Avocado Toast ($9), a Raspberry Lychee Pavlova ($7.50), a blooming hot chocolate and a cappuccino. Everything was very delicious. The hot chocolate very sweet and a little bit disappointing, too.There's only one cronut flavor which changes each month. You can pay cash or with card. Line was not too long.

74,Kasey B.,"Chester, CT",129,460,159,4.0,8/18/2018,"We made our way into NYC pretty early on a Saturday with a tight itinerary. Getting a cronut here was the first item. We got here around 10 AM and there wasn't really a line. We grabbed a peanut butter and jelly bostock and a cronut. The flavor of the day was key lime with dulce de leche. The cronut was pretty good, but I think I would have been a little bit disappointed if I had had to wait 2 hours for it. The bostock was like a fancy peanut butter and jelly pocket. While we savored these treats, we marveled at the beautiful works of delicious in the case and tried to decide what else we would take away with us. This is when it also started to pour outside. I am not sure if this triggered more people to pile in or if this was just a regular Saturday rush. Going up the second time, we had to wait in line. It is quite narrow through there because the place is small, so the line was a bit confusing at time. It did go pretty fast though. We ended up taking a DKA home and a salted caramel eclair. The DKA was good, but definitely tasted better when you warmed it up in the oven a little bit. The eclair is what won me over. It was amazing and honestly my favorite treat from that place.It is definitely worth a stop here if you have the time to wait around. Even though we did not have to wait in line the first time to get our order in, we did have to wait for a table to open. It is a small place! That being said, if you plan on hanging around and sitting I would recommend ensuring it is a fairly nice day out. It got pretty tight in there after it started raining.",1,,2

The dough was buttery and flaky a la a typical croissant. It was unfortunately also very chewy and a bit greasy, which I did not enjoy. What's nice was that the filling (which is the highlight) is inserted in multiple layers and not just one, so there was a higher chance of getting some in each bite. The rhubarb rose jam was a bit tart and balanced out nicely by the smooth and tangy mascarpone. The pink topping was just unnecessary sugar.

Since when was this a thing and how did I not know about it? I'd always avoided trying to grab Cronuts first thing in the morning since I had friends who used to camp out at 5 AM back in the day when Dominique Ansel first opened. But now that I know, I'm going to have to keep coming back for breakfast! The boo and I came last Monday. We arrived right at 7:55 AM, 5 minutes before they opened. I assumed we'd have to wait in an hour-long line, but the line was super short and we were in within 10 minutes! Also, there weren't many people waiting in line after us (and we even got back into the line after eating there to get some cronuts to go, which took like 2 minutes). It was a perfectly nice day so no reason why people wouldn't be waiting in line. I guess the buzz really has just died down.Anyways, we got a Cronut, DKA, Perfect Little Egg Sandwich, and Madeleines. Oh my gosh, yum! The beautiful, delicate layers of the Cronut were just incredible. I wouldn't wake up at 5 AM for it, but it was so well-done and lived up to its reputation (and expensive price tag). The DKA was also amazing! I still can't decide if I liked the Cronut or the DKA's delightful cinnamon taste and doughiness more. And the egg sandwich really was so perfect! The gruyere added such amazing flavor over a thick, fluffy layer of eggs tucked in a perfectly toasted brioche bun. I was way too full for the Madeleines, which worked out fine because they were a little lemony, which I didn't love. Though they were so dainty and light. Service was nice and I love the garden patio. Can't wait to come back and eat amazing pastries without too long of a wait!",1,,

I recommended this bakery to my friends from out of town, who were able to score a Raspberry (flavor of the month) cronut at around 2PM on a Tuesday. They ended up bringing a pastry back for my GF and I to share as well.The cronut is definitely more donut than croissant. Within the fluffy layers of croissant they hide their raspberry filling.

The outside was crispy and sprinkled with brown sugar crunch.Since there was no line, I went ahead and also ordered the milk and cookie shot which is objectively even better than their cronut. The vanilla milk by itself would be worth the trip- sweet and smooth. The chocolate chip cookie shot glass was lined with chocolate to prevent milk leaks and really well done.I also ordered the Chai latte but this was not great- zero Chai flavor.

91,Christine K.,"Jersey, Jersey",35,143,75,4.0,8/22/2018,"My longtime friend had once raved how the croissant doughnut, otherwise known as cronut, was a good enough reason to travel to New York for (he is an Arizona native). Although I'll say, word got around and plenty of bakeries have managed to replicate this treat. Suffice it to say, I still wanted to try one of the OG donuts. Curiosity killed the cat, perhaps. This sugar crusted croissant filled with layers of papery flakey thin sheets of dough and a cream sugary enough to wake your sleep deprived New York body up will instantly spike your blood sugar. Sadly, the cronut will not erase away your deeply set dark circles. You might need to has over to Sephora. Don't forget to wash it down with a gulp of coffee, you're going to need that acidity to break down the sugar, although a stomachache may letter ensue. I'm only kidding, except not really. As delicious as this combination is, it can be dangerous in excess, as an overdraft fee or diabetes can incur. For now, I leave gleeful and happy off my sugar high. Happy sugaring!",,,1

Even though they were sold out of cronuts, they still had a long line. I decided not to get anything the first day, but came back the second day at 10:30 AM to try and get a cronut. They were out once again! Dang these must be hard to get! I still got a DKA (which was amazing!) and decided to come a third time, which was my last day in NYC. I came at 9am to try and get it and luckily, they had some! I bought one for myself and one for my girlfriend. They put it in a cute little to-go container. We ate it there and it was good, but I don't think it's worth the $6. At around 10, they came out with another tray full of them. I guess the time they run out just depends every day.Cronut: Super sweet and flakey. It is really unique and definitely a must try, but I don't know if I would get it again. I had the blackberry buttermilk (flavor for March 2018).DKA: I think this is super good. It was also around $6 but I think better than the cronut. There's more flavor in it and it was a little more flakey.The shop itself is really small and the line goes to the back, so be prepared to wait when you come and not get a seat. The staff are nice as well.P.S. If you really want a cronut and know you will be in NYC at least 2 weeks in advance, you can preorder a cronut!",2,,

Updated review",Crispy cronut Went here twice with all sold out. So the 3rd time I went here 8:00am and got them.So expensive that is 6 or 7 Dollars per cronut and I bought two cronut and a cup of coffee. I recommended just buy one cronut with a drink cause that's way too much eat two cronut at once. LoL too sweet.,1,,

They have almost all the same things except the cronuts, s'mores, and cookie shots I think. PRO TIP: But if you really want a cronut come early!! Before noon is the way to get a cronut. PRO TIP: The cookie shots are only to go before 3pm. (I don't like them, my sister loves them)The grilled cheese is amazing!! I love it more than the egg sandwich. It's really savory and full of flavor. PRO TIP: If you get the ice cream cookie sandwich, they give you a MASSIVE scoop of ice cream - bang for your buck AND you can get it with two DKAs instead of cookies IT'S INSANE. I think that the caneles and Madeline's do not get enough credit. The Madeline's are so soft and pillowy and the caneles are perfectly chewy with a hard exterior. I LOVE them. I love this place. They always make it interesting and different each time you go! Giving four stars because I tried the cinnamon roll and it was very mediocre, not worth it, and the vanilla ice cream was icy.",2,,

But I wanted a high end breakfast sandwich after a workout and Dominique's got it. Perfectly folded, frittata-like eggs with shallots and Gruyere on a fresh baked brioche bun. YES PLEASE. It also came with a side of dressed greens, which I really enjoyed. Brightens it all up a bit. And since I was there anyway, I did order a seasonal cronut: pear with chamomile glaze. The flavors were all drowned out by just one: sugar. Like Magnolia's, it's a sugar bomb, but it is a better sugar bomb. The inside is filled with pasty cream nestled into croissant like folds, all within a firmer, more donut like exterior with a little glaze on top. It's what it bills itself as, and it was good, just damn sweet.",5,3,4

101,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,4/1/2018,"TLDR: bucket list or special occasion indulgence; requires advanced planning; predictably crowdedWanted to see what the craze behind cronuts were and when March's flavor, blackberry buttermilk, was announced, decided to take the plunge and preorder. Preorders open every Monday at 11am EST and are for the full week two weeks from the order date. I logged onto the website around 11am and didn't have an issue selecting my preferred day, time, or quantity. The checkout process was pretty standard / seamless and I got a confirmation email. Due to the volume of orders, the bakery doesn't send email reminders, so I made sure to make my own.Nearly three weeks later on a Saturday around 1pm, I headed to the bakery to pick up my cronuts. There was a sign on the door saying they had sold out of cronuts for the day (excluding preorders) and although the line inside was quite long, it wasn't out the door, which I'm told is pretty common.Given that I preordered, I didn't have to wait in line and simply told the cashier my name and she packed up my cronuts within a few minutes. The whole process was pretty easy, and I'd highly recommend preordering vs. waking up early and waiting in line for what can be hours.As for the taste of the actual cronuts, they were incredibly rich, and I'd recommend only eating half at a time. The flaky, sugar-dusted crust paired well with the blackberry and buttermilk filling (which tasted like a fruit jam and sweet cream cheese, respectively). Although the cronuts were good, they're a bit steep at around $7 each and a bit difficult to get. Therefore, I'd only recommend trying them once or for a special occasion.",1,,

After waiting years to come back to NY, I piled my friends up in the car and hit the road to stand in line for a cronut. And it was the best decision I made. The line went by fast. We got inside and had to wait in another line to order. I thought they only had baked good here, but was pleasantly surprised that they also have breakfast and lunch sandwiches. The flavor cronut (it changes monthly) was raspberry. The cinnamon sugar part of the cronut was my fav. I'm not a jelly filled type of gal but that's where the flavor is. I squeezed some out as it was over bearing but it was still hella good. I also had a sandwich (I forget which one) that came with a small salad. We sat outside in the covered area. They also have anpther outside area that isn't covered.",,,
103,Zhou W.,"Washington, DC",98,81,155,3.0,2/18/2018,"So I found this place ok...it's a long line for overpriced pastries, but you're really there for the trendy items they serve. My advice is to get there as early as possible--people are serious about cronuts and they will sell out daily.  The order: raspberry lychee pavlova, the dka (a kougin Amman, a cross between a croissant and palmier), a frozen s'more. The total came out to be about $20, which is insane, but I guess not that insane for NY. Impression: dka was good. A perfect balance of butter and sugar. Think of a slightly heartier croissant/cake combo that's flaky and classically sweet like a palmier. The frozen s'more was also ok--they make it to order and flambé it in front of your eyes, but I found it to have too much marshmallow and overly sweet. The stick it came on was smoky and imparted a nice flavor, but outside of the photo op it isn't much.",3,,

Updated review","Food: Finally after all these years, I finally got the OG cronut. This month's flavor is pear chamomile, which was tasty but is it worth the hype...no but one must try it for themselves to be the judge. I got there around 10am on Sat and there were still some left and there was no line therefore if you go before 10 am, it's safe to say you'll get one of the coveted cronuts. If not then grab something else! You can't really go wrong.Brew: Grab a caffeinated beverage and relax! Or The perfect pairing is always Brewtiful.   Breakfast stout + Cronut = Perfection.  A Cronut is a croissant-doughnut pastry invented by New York City pastry chef Dominique Ansel of Dominique Ansel Bakery. To accompany this amazing creation i paired it with Beer Geek Breakfast by Mikkeller Brewing. An American Double / Imperial Stout with Dark Horse Coffee. Subtle aroma of cocoa nibs with vanilla/tanka bean notes in the background. Strong roasted malt taste, rich with flavor of molasses, cinnamon and cold-brewed coffee. Finishes bitter and moderately dry.",4,2,7

But when I went in July 2018, height of the tourist season, on a Friday at 8:30am, there was no queue and plenty of cronuts left.Is it worth it?

The first day, we went in after lunch to realize that the cronuts are so popular that they sell out really quickly in the morning-- ""we need to come back!"" We thought. So we did, twice, because the second morning they were also sold out around 10am. We finally got to try it on the third day, and it was delightful! That month they were featuring a blackberry cream cheese filling which was really good. Aside from the cronut, I also tried the chocolate eclair, which was, more disappointing.

This was a cookie in the shape of a taller shot glass with some chocolate coating on the interior and filled to the top with milk. The cookie itself was good, and sipping the milk after a bite of cookie was pretty neat. I think a bit more of a novelty than something to order again and again, just because the milk makes the bottom of the cookie a bit soggy after sitting for a while; however, It's quite a unique creation, and definitely worth a try. A creative take on milk and cookies that's for sure! - S'mores marshmallow: your gooey campsite treat on a stick, supersized and perfectly golden.- Raspberry lychee pavlova: pavlova in general is not my favourite because I don't prefer texture, but I really liked the fruity combination, as I haven't come across too many patisserie-type desserts that use lychee especially. The presentation was so on point as well.As we were munching away, one of the staff came around with some croissant tidbits as samples, and if I wasn't so stuffed I would have ordered a croissant - the free sample tactic almost work hehe.

There was a line outside to get inside the building and another line to order your food. It was worth the wait, but the inside was kind of small that the line sometimes blocked the bathroom and the tables were placed a little closed to the line, but it's not a big factor that would change my view of the food.

You guys... it's that good to me. So good, I have a photo of one framed. If you want a guaranteed cronut -- go to their website and order a couple weeks in advance. You can skip the line this way and not have to worry about them selling out. If not, brave the line which is a little uncomfortable and long but again, so worth it.

Please be aware how the DAB staff are direct people to line up.  When we arrived on a late weekday morning, DAB was busy, but there were no significant lines. The cashier staff was not overly friendly, but she did accommodate our requests and order. We sat near the entrance in one of the two small tables.Onto the various DAB items. I would like to come back for their seasonal items, but on the visit, we bought their signature items.To start, we ordered the Madeleines for $6. This order has ten pieces. The Madeleines are more mini size their standard Madeleines. This item is made to order so it is served nice and warm.The second item is the famous Frozen S'mores with marshmallow around chocolate covered ice cream. The staff uses a blowtorch to warm up the marshmallow, but the ice cream is still frozen. The S'mores will start melting fast, so I highly recommend eating it quickly and favoring the hot and cold together.After a Frozen S'mores, there is always room for more chocolate. The Blossoming Hot Chocolate for $7 has a blooming marshmallow. The staff will place the marshmallow in the cup, and they will let you take a video or photo. I appreciate how considerate the staff was on placing it for the best Instagram moment; The hot chocolate comes in one size which is pretty large. It's a little too sweet for my taste buds, but I enjoyed it.Finally, there is the cronut. The cronut needs no introduction with the hybrid item where donut met a croissant and had a baby together. The cronut is more of the donut than a croissant. It is difficult to eat it with quickly fall apart. It is super yummy. Each month, there is a sweet flavor. We enjoyed the banana caramel hazelnut flavor. It was perfect.DAB recently opened a new location in L.A., and I would like to check out their London outpost.

One weekday when I was taking a day off from work, I decided to go, thinking it will be less crowded. And I was right, it was less crowded without crazy long line. They have a small seating space right by the entrance. This space is most intimate and cozy, with a nice view of this shop. At the back of the ordering counter, they have a seating along the narrow hallway. This is the least comfortable seating space in my opinion... It is better to check the seating area in the back before you decide to sit at one of these tables, if there is a choice. Why? Because there is a large, open, bright seating space in the back! Half of which is in the indoor, and the other half is outdoor. It was a very cold day, so there was no one sitting outside. On a warm day, it would be a really nice spot to have desserts. A little oasis in a busy NYC streets.We got some sweet deliciousness including some of their signature items like the Frozen S'mores, Blossoming Hot Chocolate, and Cronut. Some of the items we got was way to sweet... Tasty? Yes, but overly sweet? Yes.. I waited for so long to visit this popular spot, and it was indeed filled with tourists... The cashier was not friendly, but rather cold... She was still polite (well, borderline...) but no smile, no warmth coming out of her. All the other locations that we visited had very nice and friendly staffs, so this was kind of sad. The staff who prepared my booming hot chocolate was really nice, but that was about it...

When they reach maximum capacity in the bakery they do have you wait outside which can be a bit frustrating in the winter when its freezing cold! If you are coming for the infamous Cronuts I recommend ordering ahead of time online because they do sell out quite fast! I came particularly this time for the Milk & Cookie shots which are ONLY served daily at 3P.M., and are were sold out that day within 30 minutes! I personally think it looked better than it tasted which was disappointing. The Blooming Hot Chocolate is decadent, but was sold out that day. I asked if they could sub the hot chocolate with coffee and was denied because ""thats not how it is meant to be served"" according to the barista.

And as for the shells, they were just crunchy enough on the outside and just chewy enough on the inside so that they didn't fall apart into a sea of flakes when I bit into them, but they didn't feel like sponges either.If you haven't had a kouign amann before, think of it as a star-shaped croissant that has a large base like that of a muffin, and where the points of the stars are folded over each other so that they may include fruity fillings inside. While the DKA that I got did not have a fruit filling, it still had a nice, crunchy consistency thanks to its caramelization. If you have a chance to visit the Bay Area, however, please do try Belinda Leong's exemplary kouign amanns at her B. Patisserie in San Francisco.There's a limited amount of seating in an interior room and exterior greenhouse at the rear of the establishment. The waits can be insane, and for some reason the line snakes *into* the establishment. This makes it awkward if you're sitting there eating while folks in line are eyeing and judging your every bite. Still, this place is worth the hype and well worth a visit.",6,2,6
130,Amanda C.,"New York, NY",156,115,278,5.0,7/15/2018,"Wow. This was so delicious. Honestly very good, not exaggerating. July's flavor is Blueberry coconut with a lemon drizzle on top. I love blueberry filling and this was perfect. flavors perfectly complimented each other. Also ordered the DKA that was pretty good- I liked the cronuts more. I highly recommend preordering cronuts in their site. I walked in and had my cronuts within 5 minutes. Order minimum is 2 cronuts. There is a separate line for non-cronuts which I thought was smart. Saturday morning looked like the line would take about 20 minutes, not bad. There is a decent amount of seating in the back and an outdoor garden area with more seating. Also ordered an iced latte. overall great experience-will definitely be back!!",,,
131,Samantha K.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,161,42,3.0,6/11/2018,"I simply cannot convince myself to get up at the crack of dawn and drag myself here to get a cronut! I really wanted to try May's flavor, but it just wasn't going to happen.I saw posts of their beautiful cookies on Instagram and decided to stop in and see what else they had to offer besides cronuts. My first thoughts walking in late on a Friday night were, wow the line is still way too long and oh my god, they need to get air conditioning immediately. It was so hot and pretty disorganized. The line and ordering system is quite honestly ridiculous! I cannot understand why they don't have someone take your order on the line and then hand your ticket to the cashier so they can get your order ready before you pay. Instead you wait a small eternity (even when they're out of cronuts!) to even place your order, then you do more waiting while they get it together. Really inefficient, which is a shame. There were a lot of people packed behind the counter but only two seemingly helping anyone. Now, when I finally was able to order I picked up each of the cookies (chocolate chip, double chocolate, and white chocolate macadamia), a chocolate croissant, and matcha passion fruit pastry. The boxing up took forever and the disorganization behind the counter almost resulted in my cookies going to someone else.Finally on to the taste! The matcha passion fruit pastry I got was to die for, no really, it's one of the best things I've ever eaten. Not too sweet, a boatload of flavors that you wouldn't think go together but absolutely do. I still haven't decided if I ever want to brave that line again but it was delicious. The cookies were thick and chewy, but sadly not the best in the city and the croissant was perfectly unremarkable. All in all, not speaking for the famed cronut of course, it's middle of the road for me.",2,1,2

The dessert and cronuts from this bakery are VERY well crafted and tasteful and beautifully presented. The rest of their desserts change frequently and i always try to get something extra outside the infamous cronut. This place, though a delight in all its sugary, flaky pastry glory, is very pricy for a great, but personally worth it. the staff can definitely be a bit rude, but i've never had too much of an issue. you can also sit in the back which is nice in the summer.",1,1,3

The winter flavor is eggnog caramel: filled with eggnog ganache, gooey caramel, and finished with nutmeg sugar outside. It's chewy, gooey, sweet, a little savory.. every bite of this pastry was so good. We followed this with a chocolate eclair which paled in comparison but still will satisfy every eclair-chocolate lover out there. The cookie shot isn't available until 3 PM unfortunately; however, I've ordered it each time I've visited before. Definitely recommend it!!

142,Alyssa T.,"San Francisco, CA",134,94,86,5.0,12/2/2017,"100% worth the hype. I can't say enough about Dominique Ansel. I first went here two years ago and had to go again this year when I was in New York again. Here are a few reasons I love and will continue to support this bakery whenever I'm in New York:1) The Cronut - TRY IT FOR YOURSELF. The first time I visited was in Sept 2016, and I had a life-changing honey pear & cream cheese cronut. I was super skeptical of something so hyped up, but I was floored at the first bite. I have a sweet tooth, so waking up early and having a cronut first thing in the morning is no problem for me, as long as I have a cup of coffee to go with it. Beware, this isn't as easy for some people. The cronut is covered in sugar so definitely on the sweet side. The 2nd time I had a cronut was November 2017, when I had the caramelized banana jam & hazelnut ganache flavor. That combo was just to die for. I went twice in the week I was in NY. I will never try other cafes' ""do-ssants"" (wtf) because I'm positive they will not compare to the Cronut.2) Quality - aside from the cronut, I've had the DKA, the cookie shot, and the smores bar. All were unique, delicious treats. My friends I was with also got the egg sandwich, which they couldn't stop raving about. Feast your eyes on their beautiful display of pastries once you get into the bakery and please treat yourself to something in addition to a cronut -- it'll be well worth it!3) Professionalism - Since this is such a tourist attraction, you can tell the staff is extremely well-trained and prepared for all questions. I always line up for the cronut before opening (They open 8AM on Mon-Sat and 9AM on Sun) so that I'm guaranteed one. Every time, I've been served free samples while waiting in line, and even have gotten hot chocolate. The hostess then explains the basics of how to get a cronut (limit 2 per person, but you can re-enter the line and get more). I love that they are prepared and clearly know they are popular, but lack an attitude about it. The cashiers are also extremely professional and are even trained to greet the first group of customers as they walk in :) so cute.4) Ambiance - I'm a sucker for good lighting and cute decor. DA's signature yellow-orange color is reflected not only in their bags, but in the cute decor they have in the back patio umbrellas and the decorative flowers. As if they know people are going to be taking pictures for Instagram, DA also boasts white marble tables and white walls, and has the cutest outdoor patio in the back. Their attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed.",3,2,2
143,Erica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,229,292,4.0,11/28/2017,"Finally off my bucket list! I came with 2 other friends around 3pm a few weeks ago. I was planning to get a cronut. But unfortunately, they're sold out around this time. Quite reasonable, runs out quickly during morning time I guess.Anyways... back to review... since cronuts were sold out, I decided to get the cookie shot. A bit in the pricey side. First bit tasted wonderful until it gradually got sweeter and sweeter. That's the only downfall of it. Other than that, the milk was sweetened and the cookie shot was chewy.I'll be back hopefully to get my hands in a cronut!",5,,1
144,Henna J.,"Pompano Beach, FL",260,35,137,3.0,1/15/2018,"Came here during our annual NY trip and the desserts and hot chocolate here never disappoint! It's almost always packed, so we had to wait outside. This wasn't fun because of the 26 degree weather. It was pretty cramped inside, but that's because this place is usually very busy. Came here for the cookies and milk shots which were amazing! They ran out of the blooming hot chocolate which was unfortunate because it also is really good. My favorite is the frozen smores! This is always a go-to spot when we come up to New York.3 stars simply because of the long wait outside. If this were based only on the drinks/food/service then 5 stars for sure",1,,

Instead, I had the cookie shot and the frozen s'more. The cookie shot was just okay, but I really liked the frozen s'more. I shared both with my boyfriend, although I didn't want to. I'm not even a sweets person but I enjoyed every bite. Both need to be eaten quickly, as the cookie will crumble from the milk, and the s'more will start melting on the inside. We bought a box of the DKA (4 pieces) to go, which according to my BF, is better than a cronut. I can't say how it stacks up to the cronut but I really liked it. It has just the right amount of sweetness to it. We still had one left three days after we bought it, stuck it in the toaster oven, and it was still good. We also bought a box of the Christmas Morning cereal, which was good but not worth the $17 price tag.Overall, I liked everything we ordered but it's definitely not a bakery you can frequent all the time - it's more of a once in a while splurge.",,,2

147,Emanuel C.,"New York, NY",551,141,305,5.0,7/4/2018,"One of the few pleasures I can still enjoy in this life is a decadent sweet. I love pastries and I really love good and unique pastries. Something I can't get at a chain restaurant/cafe.Coming here, you are treated to one of New Yorks most sinful pleasures. The Cronut. Dear god, these things are going to kill me one day but I love them.They do have, in general, great food all around. But if you are coming here for the first time, you need to have a cronut. If you don't know what that is? It's a Croissant and a Donut filled with creme and topped with frosting. Let that sink in and go get yourself one. Keep in mind the lines can be hectic, so coming here is all about timing. Pricing is not to outrageous but most of these pastries are luxuries and are handmade.",,,

The Cronut for November was some kind of banana creme and a fruity jam.. apricot colored and a super sweet mauve glaze on top. Out of this world, but definitely super super sweet, though the creme filling was so incredibly light and fluffy. We also shared an Almond Croissant that was good but a tad over cooked on top and not the best i've had and I had expected to be wowed.

It's all we keep talking about during the cruise and we can't wait to get back to New York to stop there again. There is a line that forms outside for the cronuts, or you can go right inside if your ordering other items. It's a tiny and cramped space that is packed with people but now I understand why people rave about this place.

152,Zhen C.,"Miami, FL",568,130,86,5.0,6/4/2018,"TLDR - This is what pastry heaven looks like!On a little self-planned food adventure my girlfriend and I were doing, we stopped at Dominique Ansel Bakery for what we heard would be great pastries. After patiently waiting through the long line of salivating customers, we picked up a cronut and a frozen s'more, which we watched a chef toast right before serving. I'm not the biggest fan of s'mores to be honest, so I didn't appreciate this one as much as my girlfriend who loves them did. Nonetheless, this isn't your average campfire s'more. It's a cake-y type dessert that forms the core of a rectangular prism of toasted marshmallow. Really cool and artistic way of having a s'more. Speaking of artistic, you'll feel like everything is way to perfect to actually eat. The display counter has all sorts of pastries that look more like 3D art molds of food than anything actually edible. But I digress...We also grabbed a cronut, which they have different flavors depending on when you go. The one we got to taste was filled with a strawberry jelly, cream cheese filling. I've never had a cronut before, and I have to say this changed my entire world. Imagine an excited Aziz Ansari and that would be the personification of how every taste bud of mine felt in that moment. You bite down and feel the flaky layers crisp like a croissant, while at the same time the whole experience still has the soft, doughiness of a fresh donut. The jelly/cream cheese filling only served to be the shooting stars on an already beautiful moonlit sky.",1,1,1
153,Roxana I.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",254,182,238,5.0,5/7/2018,"How can I express my love for all things Dominique Ansel. As a pastry chef, I definitely appreciate his attention to detail. I think all of his items are perfectly balanced and delicious. I know some of you might wish they were cheaper because it does become pricey when his place is tailored for eating with your eyes. BUT the prices are actually very reasonable for what you are getting. Now onward to the noms! The cronuts are always a must, yes there's a giant line on the weekends but if you come in the afternoon on a week day you will find that they usually aren't sold out till 2-3pm. The cronuts are delicious and I love how there are new flavors every month. The Madeline's are so simplistically delectable and are made to order. My favorite item are the DKA's though, they are just crispy, sweet, buttery, soft in the middle and are 100 percent addicting. Just get the DKA, seriously it's sinful. Next up, the frozen s'more. It's literally summer in your mouth, that honey marshmallow should be sold separately cause I'd like a 100 of them please. The perfect little egg sandwich lived up to its name, it was the perfect breakfast. The spinach quiche however lacked flavor and I was underwhelmed by it. I wouldn't suggest getting a coffee from here as well, they are a bakery not a cafe so don't expect stellar coffee. When they are in season treat yourself to the framboise desserts, the ones with the teeny tiny strawberries from Spain. That is what strawberries should taste like. Also do sit outside and enjoy their garden. It enhances your experience and literally is like a get away during the hustle and bustle of NYC.",6,1,3

The inside of the cookie had a smooth chocolate which I guess prevented the milk from leaking out. The actual cookie was perfect, crispy yet chewy. I would 100% recommend this. Cheers!",,,1

156,Victoria T.,"Watertown, CT",107,79,416,3.0,12/17/2017,"This review is going to be a mixed bag! There were some things I loved about DA and some I really didn't. Overall I don't think I'd be back to the bakery right away, but maybe in the future. I went to the bakery specifically after seeing the Blooming Hot Cocoa video from Food Insider. I'm a food blogger and food instagrammer covering NYC's cutest and most feminine foods. The blooming hot cocoa is a cocoa with a blossom of marshmallow that blooms in the heat, making a great video. The barista who gave it to me was already looking really upset and sick of the very crowded cafe. Even my friends noted that she gave me a really negative look when she called me up to get my drink. She told me to get my camera ready. Then she added the marshmallow blossom. Because of how she tipped the drink, the blossom didn't open but instead completely collapsed. Not good for photos or video! The point of this $7+ drink was the presentation and it was a complete flop. She then put the lid on and told me to hurry up and move out of the way. It would have been a lot better to offer a second flower or at least apologize as we both watched the flower sink to the bottom. I understand working in a famous cafe must be exhausting and stressful, but this essentially means my cocoa - that was fairly pricey and I waited a half hour for - was a waste. This was really disappointing. The other dishes I got were beautiful, and the baker who made the madeleines was especially sweet and friendly. Those fresh madeleines tasted like they were stolen from God's plate! They were worth every penny and ever minute of that super busy and long wait. I loved watching him make them as well! I hope in future the staff at Dominique Ansel works to better represent what is a famous and global bakery known for their beautiful presentation. I'd love to be back, but hopefully with a better experience this time!",1,1,

Though it was clearly media hyped and one of the desserts we got just tasted like whipped cream with sugar, I love the typical new york craze for all things different. The hot chocolate with blooming marshmallow flower made me feel like an excited baby, actually that is their top selling point and they ask you to keep your cameras ready before they pop in the marshmallow, so that you don't miss the bloom.

The girls behind the counter are super friendly and welcome all questions. The space is nice-indoors and outdoors. The food is a delicacy. Each item is meticulously created. Nothing but details in the smallest of object down to the little gold leafs on top of the pastries. I can't recommend just one thing.

I wanted to try the perfect egg sandwich, but arrived after they stop serving all savory items at 6pm. My other choices of their DKA and the fresh Madeline's were still available, so I ordered those. At $13 for these two items, I was REALLY skeptical of how they could be worth this price tag. But man oh man, they are. The DKA is the perfect pastry, bar none. It's just... flaky, buttery, crispy, sweet deliciousness. (I think I took the pic upside down but who cares. It was a thing of beauty.) Man. It's going to be hard to beat that if I ever do get a cronut. So I wolfed down the DKA while waiting for the madelines, which were ready in probably 5 minutes. These little bites are worth the price and wait too. They're like... citrusy, perfectly crisp, hot little pillows of pancake with powdered sugar on top. Delicious, and way too easy to inhale 10 or 20. Is it weird I didn't want this place to be worth the hype? Well, it's true. But I stand in the wrong.

The DKA is a crunchy, flaky, muffin-shaped, simply divine masterpiece. I also purchased the cronut, but the filling in the middle of the layered cronut was overwhelmingly sweet for me.

Had to wait outside in the 10 degree weather for around 20ish minutes but luckily an employee was passing out hand warmers or else I probably would've gotten frostbite. After finally being ushered to go inside, we realized that there was another line inside the tiny, narrow bakery which we waited for about other 25 minutes before reaching the cashier. After 45 total minutes of waiting, we order 4 cronuts ($6 each), a chocolate pine cone gingerbread cake ($8), and an apple tart ($8). Our total came out to around $50 with tax, which is pretty pricey. There was also nowhere to sit; the bakery and ""garden"" in the back is small enough as it is, and many people who didn't have food were saving seats for their friends who were in line. We ended up standing at a cramped up counter to eat our food.Eggnog caramel cronut: Definitely more croissant than donut, as there were many flaky, crunchy layers. The filling was pretty sweet but overall 4/5.Apple Tart: Nothing to write home about, pretty small portion for the price and tasted pretty average. 2/5Pinecone Gingerbread Cake: Looked really intricate/beautiful but also tasted pretty average. The pinecone ""leaves"" were all chocolate and inside contained some mousse type thing and gingerbread cake. 3/5Overall, I would recommend trying the cronut if you haven't before, but be prepared to wait in long lines no matter the time of day. Pro tip: you can order online for pickup 2 weeks in advanced, but timeslots tend to be sold out fairly quickly as well.",,,

Friendly staff that is extremely helpful in deciding which dessert to pick and really gets to know our preference. I only wish the coffee was just as good. If the coffee was just as good as the dessert I'd make the commute from UES everyday! Please change whatever it is you're doing with making coffee so I can give this place 5 stars!,,,
167,Jennifer T.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",543,377,1551,2.0,10/14/2017,"Let's preface by saying that I have been excited to come here after hearing so many rave reviews and watching all these videos about the cronut and blossoming marshmallow and all the amazing treats that this place produces. The cronut flavor when I went was fig. Didn't really scream at me, but I had to get it because when I am really going to be coming back here? First impression: overly sweet, dough was super chewy, and why didn't you warm this up for me?? This costs $6 for one, and I was upset to have to pay $6 for something that costs like 25cents. Additionally, the service was horrible. The girl at the register was so rude. It's like.... girl, you are representing a higher end bakery.. put a smile on your face, help your customers, and do your job. When you walk into a bakery like this, you expect better service. Totally NOT what I experienced. Will NOT return.",6,6,3

Updated review",Okay..had to come back here before we left to try the cronut. We got here around 10:15 am on a Sunday and waited about 30 min in line. The flavor of the month is key lime. I was skeptical about the flavor cause I'm not a big key lime flavor fan but man I must say the cronut was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The flavor isn't overpowering and has the perfect amount of flavor. I loved it. Can't wait to come back :). Heard there is a location in LA but doesn't compared to the NY location. Must try!!!!!!,1,,1

And after waiting for dozens of minutes in line to order and another dozen minutes waiting for them to call our names to pick up our order, it was finally time to eat our much anticipated desserts! To our great disappointment, nothing tasted really good. The flavor and texture was just not there. Perhaps we chose the wrong items. For me, it was all hype, no substance",,,

Gosh! I wish I ordered more since my husband decided to love it too. The texture of the smores is just wow!

172,Victoria H.,"Washington, DC",146,231,195,4.0,5/26/2018,"Had the strawberry cronut, carrot cake, frozen smore, dka, and cheesecake here. My favorite item was the dka, which was like a croissant, but thicker dough and sweeter. The cronut was well made but the creme inside overwhelmed the flavor of the dough. The carrot cake was well made too but had a gelatinous outside layer which didn't go well with the rest of the cake. The cheesecake had a nice light texture but the flavor didn't strike me. Overall, it was a really nice experience, but maybe I was expecting more given the hype.",1,,1

Our first day in NYC we went to the bakery for cronuts at NOON and they were already out! We got other desserts instead. But in NYC- you gotta try cronuts and based on my research, Dominique Ansel was the best in town! We came back on your last day in NYC at 8:00ish am- waited in line but got our cronuts! The wait was worth it.We now have a Dominique Ansel Bakery at the Grove so we get to enjoy delicious cronuts anytime. If you love cronuts- Dominique Ansel is a must try!!",1,,2

The flourless choc cookie was good but as pastries go it's an easy one to get right. We also had the almond croissant which was decent but could have been better if it was fresher tasting. The cramped space and unfriendly servers made the experience even less appealing.",,,
176,Yaa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",199,97,232,4.0,4/29/2018,"The DKA is the absolute bestest, perfectly flakiest pastry. The soft texture inside and flaky outside takes you to a whole new level in life. However, you must have it fresh and warm to get the full essence. I recommend without care re the calories; it's worth it! The avocado toast is good, but not amazing. The cronut texture is great but I'm not wild about all the flavors. I'd much rather just have the DKA. They have a few seats inside and more seating all the way in the back of the restaurant. Expect a line and a short wait to order but be prepared for a euphoric experience if you get the DKA (hot, fresh and ready!).",2,1,1

I ended up getting the cookie shot (with was alright - nothing special) and the flaky pastries (being sold in packs of 3's and 4's which were also A-Okay, nothing special). Overall a disappointing experience. I think it would have been different if I got a cronut!PS The line outside is right next to some ginko trees with fruit fallen on the ground (these fruit smell like dog poop..)",1,1,1

We got the cookie shots and the frozen s'mores though and both were okay. I loved cookies so it isn't hard for me to like anything cookie related so the shots were good, unique idea and pretty simple in taste. The frozen s'mores were also okay, the marshmallow mixed with what seemed like ice cream was okay but it was toooo much marshmallow i wish there were more chocolate and graham cracker. The line was extremely long it was out the door and we had to wait 15ish min but not bad. The lady at the counter was a little rude, I don't understand service people who are unnecessarily rude!

189,Cesca T.,"Detroit, MI",10,61,155,4.0,5/10/2018,"The staff is friendly and the atmosphere bright, in this tiny, but mighty bakery. The line was down the block Sunday morning, so I opted for trying Dominique Ansel's renowned confections early afternoon on Monday. There was still a line, but it was more manageable. I tend to lose my mind temporarily in the orbit of baked goods and desserts, so I order quite a bit, and (mostly) share with my family.  I had to try the cronuts of much repute, and the flavor for the month was rose rhubarb. Neither tastes I can say I enjoyed previously, but somehow the delicate handedness with the rose, allowed for a very sophisticated flavor. And they are quite large, and heavy. Like weighty in your hand, heavy. Two people could easily split one.  Granted the only reason I would do that is to save more room to try other items. The canneles were amazing. Just the right amount of burnt sugar flavor on the exterior giving way, to the rich eggy custard-like texture of the interior. My husband must have enjoyed the ham and cheese croissant because it was long gone before I could ask for a bite. The pain au chocolat was good, but I think my favorite bite was a toss-up between the matcha cake with passionfruit curd, and the Kouign Amann. Both were just exquisite, and detailed, and so delicious I couldn't put either one down.  It was obvious the bakers here know what they are doing.",1,,1

192,Vivian C.,"Austin, TX",294,184,0,3.0,5/29/2018,"** MORE LIKE A 3.5 **This is a small, cramped space a little outside the SoHo area. It is SO SMALL - you're either sitting elbow-to-elbow with other tourists, shouting to be heard, or elbowing people to get through. It's chaotic. Also, it's an open kitchen, so you see EVERYTHING, and what I see is UNHAPPY EMPLOYEES EVERYWHERE. I don't think people pay much attention because they're too busy looking at which baked goods they want, but if you look up, no one has a smile on their face, there's no customer service, people are just plain unhappy. And it's pretty bad, even for NY. In addition, my complaint is the same as everyone else's.. where are the cronuts?? Why do customers have to line up at 8am to be able to buy one? It just ruins people's experience if they travel all this way to try these ""famous cronuts"", fit the bakery into their packed schedules, and leave disappointed. What's the point?

I was pleasantly surprised to discover how delicious Dominique Ansel's cronuts are! I was afraid they were overhyped, but oh man, they are worth it! Try them out yourself.I recommend peeling the cronut layer by layer as a fun way to enjoy it. There's actually a nice outdoor seating area in the back of the shop, as well. They offer an assortment of many beautiful desserts, that I will have to try next time. Truly did not think I would be a fan, but I will definitely be pre-ordering more cronuts in the future!",4,,2

Very instagram-worthy if you're into thatCons:- Extremely small place, which isn't abnormal for NY but for a place this famous and with this amount of customers, it is nearly impossible for you to find a seat inside- The line can get very very long and the service tends to be slow so make sure you plan to give this place some time if you're planning on stopping bySpecifics:- The famed cookie shot = I gotta say, when I first heard about this I was really excited. What a great idea! And also completely unique and adorable. However, it doesn't live up to its expectations. It's pretty difficult to get the right balance of cookie and milk since biting onto the shot made it harder to keep the rest of the milk in. Also, the cookie itself was a bit too sugary for my taste and I would've needed a lot more milk than what the shot could hold. On top of the fact that I personally think this is way overcharged for something I could easily bake myself, I would say I would not be getting this again.

The DKA doesn't look like it would taste like anything sublime. But for sure it's outer plainess fooled me. Heck! That DKA was bomb! Oh, we had the s'mores ice cream. OMG.. genius. I loved the slighty melted/gooey marshmallows and half frozen inside. It was interesting because it was hot and cold at the same time. I really liked the flavors, it was just so good and so pretty to look at. Another thing I ate.. the pinecone. Okay, so I ate this thing around Christmas time. It was ok. I think there was just too much caffeine from the chocolate. It was intricately and beautifully designed. It looked so beautiful but I was getting a headache from the caffeine in the chocolate.
