0,,8/21/2018,18,,"Sparks, NV",Patricia J.,1,5.0,5,My experience with World Yacht was fantastic!  I ordered a gift certificate for a very important client and Jose was so helpful!  I am on the west coast so we were able to communicate via email and got everything accomplished quickly and accurately.  I presented the gift to my client at a dinner party and It was well received!  Thanks to the helpful people at World Yacht for making me look good!!,

From boarding till the parting it is always with great smile's excellent staff such excellent behavior and accommodating staff was very much recognizable. The food well it was like having dinner at the Waldorf Astoria. Parking was provided was great, you can go from you car 20 steps to the boat so very accommodating.",
2,,7/5/2018,0,,"Chester, United Kingdom",Mama Z.,0,1.0,2,"This was the worse 4th of July experience ever!!!! Let me start by saying I saw this groupon special for the world yacht $350 per person..having been on the world yacht 20 years ago..I remembered it being classy with exquisite cuisine . I went ahead and ordered 2 tickets @ $700. to my surprise when I got there they told me I was on another boat North Lobster Co.  the not so classy boat ride..I was a little annoyed but I moved on and got on the boat..so I'm thinking finally I got in.. I was tired of standing  for 2 hours baking in the sun.I finally got the chance to let my hair down by taking a  complimentary long island ice tea..ready for dinner, one of the employees comes behind my husband and says he or she knows me from some where then proceeded to go into my work history..which I found so rude  and unpolite and treating me like she had something on me or some sort of personal relationship...which made me  and husband feel so uncomfortable. It was so disgusting telling my personal information in front of someone you dont even know!!! I wanted off that boat immediately. At first sight couldn't tell her gender..so my husband asked if  had a relationship because this person was so adamant in trying to remind you who they are. I felt so embarrassed.I kept saying well it was nice seeing you..but she kept on throughout the night you still dont remember  me? I was livid.  The other employees  did not  seem hospitable either. All and all World Yatch you failed me..my night was ruined by a prying unpolished employee. It was my worst July 4 2018 celebration..World Yatch please train your employees,if they think they know someone, let that person acknowledge  them first  and keep it professional.",1

It was a  solid experience.  I have been on a few dinner cruises and this was the most intimate.  My husband loved it for this reason.  It was not filled to capacity so, that may impact my perspective. The food was good. The staff were the nicest and most professional.  The music was varied.  The bathroom was clean. The people were friendly and service....not the best and certainly not the worst. Pleasant experience and for the Groupon price I can't complain...enjoy! The views were excellent.",

The only drawback is the air conditioning was up so high it made enjoying the evening really difficult.  Many passengers found it uncomfortably cold and expressed such. At times it felt like it got a it better to them go back. Despite it all it is a must do!We enjoyed celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary with World Yacht and its guests!",2

7,1,11/26/2016,165,1,"Dallas, TX",Jesse S.,80,2.0,36,"Thanksgiving lunch cruise 2016:The boat: itself is well kept. Clean linens in the tables, accommodating staff, and clean furniture on the viewing deck.The food... well it was a little disappointing. The selection was above average. 3-4 salads, veggies, potatoes, beef, turkey, and salmon along with an assortment of desserts. However the real downfall was the temperature of the food. I realize it was a buffet, but it was luke-warm at best. Nothing really kills the mood like semi-cold potatoes and chewy veggies.  The drinks: ok selection. Nothing that's going to blow you away. About on par with the buffet.The views: perhaps the best part of the cruise. However, is suggest a regular cruise with no food. You're better off grabbing street meat and saving your money on the buffet.The service: meh. Understaffed. Not much more to be said. Very friendly staff but they needed 2-3 more people in my opinion.Overall, it was ok. At $75 a person, I expected more. My suggestion: take a regular cruise out around the statute of liberty and spend your money on better food elsewhere.",
8,68,6/28/2014,1061,70,"Scranton, PA",Alexander H.,6680,2.0,584,"I was given the opportunity to participate in a private radio station cruise via the World Yacht Princess. The boat ride and the nice views were included, and everything else (including food) had to be paid for on-board. I had fun on this cruise! My friend and I had the pleasure of meeting the ""party crew"" and DJs of the radio station, and talking with them briefly. We also participated in the ""Guess The Number and Spin The Wheel"" game, which was fun too. The cruise itself sailed at a smooth (or close-to) speed, and went toward the Statue of Liberty. After that, it turned around and sailed back to the pier. Ahh, the views were awesome! I had the pleasure of taking photos of certain spots, and let's not forget about the panoramas! :) Seriously, who doesn't like looking at the views? :P The weather was nice for this event. The ship itself looked okay too.When it comes to rating cruises of ANY kind, I consider the food and drink qualities, and on-board pricing. Unfortunately, my low rating is the result of that. We didn't eat dinner prior to boarding, so we decided to eat here. We paid $9 for Chicken Fingers with Fries from their limited menu. For a price that high, we expected the food to be really good. While it was edible, the quality was disappointing. The chicken itself was okay (wasn't sure if this was frozen before), but the fries were not fresh, as they were soggy and re-heated. No other sides were included.If that wasn't insulting enough, how about the drinks? $3 for a CUP of soda (which I got). WOW, I've been on other cruises before, and they give you more (a can) for the same price. Oh and if you wanted water, you had to pay $3 for that too (a cup!). On other cruises, it was available at no extra charge (excluding bottles). Want beer or a mixed drink? $9 and more! Yeah, I paid less for all of that stuff (or received more for same price) when I was on another cruise line last month. So yeah, didn't buy any alcoholic drinks for that reason. This was my first (and LAST) time with World Yacht. Even though I had a great time on this ship during the private event, and really enjoyed the AWESOME views that were provided throughout the duration, I'm sorry but I will NOT be considering any more cruises with this company.  Advisory: The ship kept on ""rocking"" while it was in dock. Hang on to the railings when walking through.",73
9,,8/13/2017,79,,"BAYSIDE, NY",Kara C.,0,5.0,7,"I recently took the World Yacht cruise on the Hudson boat for dinner. The boat was beautiful, with stunning views on the third deck. Chris, Oscar and Robert who worked in the lounge area provided impeccable and friendly service. The meal was top rate- fresh fish, fresh pasta and an impressive wine selection. The ambiance and decor made for a cool, comfortable and chilled out vibe on a summer evening. I highly recommend that you try it!",
10,3,5/26/2015,11,,"Oak Grove, MO",Devon R.,150,5.0,39,"Took my wife to the formal sit down dinner and it was truly memorable.  Upon entering the dinner yacht the gate attendant was very professional and courteous  however, the $35 parking fee was a bit steep but eh thats Manhattan for you......the attendant was very knowledgeable and was able to direct me and my wife to exactly where to go, we didnt have to try to figure out what was next, because there was always someone guiding us. We parked the car and walked to the ticket booth where we were again greated by a smiling face eager to assist. We recieved our tickets and aboard we went. My first impression of the yacht was pure excitement The yacht was clean (inside and out) and it smelled very pleaseant.  Once we entered we were greated by very pleasant staff members and showed our table, although I wanted a window seat (they were sold out and an additional 80 bucks)  we were seated at an aisle table which to my surprise my wife actually preferred the spot over the window.  FOOD: we started out with white or wheat bread and butter AMAZING...then followed by a lobster hordourve my wife said she could have eatten it all night but I passed as I was saving my appetite....next came the salad round eh not to big on veggies so not the highlight but to the entree I ordered the chicken dinner which was well seasoned and moist which was served with risotto and steamed veggies AMAZING The wife had steak and potatoes, she couldnt get enough and that says alot because she never orders steak, it also was tender and well seasoned. Then came dessert, the absolute best hands down cheesecake in the world! After dinner they give the guests complimentary champagne and even accommodated my pregnant wife with ginger ale, was truly a nice touch. Dinner price is included with the ticket price. Drinks are extra and will be billed at the end of the tour. AMBIANCE: although it was a formal dinner the atmosphere was very relaxing wasnt stuffy they had a dj that started off very rocky, but soon found his niche and played a mix for just about everyone. The dance floor was packed with people having a great time.  The decks were well stocked with adequate seating for guests and the view of Manhattan/brooklyn was absolutely breathtaking. Also, you are not required to sit and wait for food you can walk around and enjoy the tour and hot food will be served once you return. The bathrooms were clean and well kept. Not a place for children however there were two kids aboard. CON: they expect to be given gratuity on the total ticket price versus just your drinks. Example ticket price 250 + drinks 50 = gratuity on a 300 versus 50 bill. Not a deal breaker but I typically pay for service and we enjoyed the service. OVERALL: AMUST go at least once!!!!!",6
11,1,7/4/2015,10,1,"Manhattan, NY",Paola B.,2,2.0,27,"It was my anniversary and my parents made this suggestion to us. I was very excited at first but even making the reservations was a first sign of how things were run. I saw there was a military discount online and you could get something included for your anniversary. When I first called they said yes it was true and all year around. When I actually made the reservation they said it was only for fleet week and nothing was included. I even gave the promo code on the website and they just said ""we don't do that"". That should have been my first clue but I managed to argue a bit of a discount.On the boat was a little better but you could tell the staff knew that we had paid less and hadn't gotten the extras. We felt like second class because we would get served last, have our plates left and have to ask multiple times for things. The other tables around us by the windows got far better service. The food was meh but came out cold which is never acceptable. While the view was beautiful I would not recommend this to anyone. If you are more expensive then other dinner cruises then the service and food should match that.",4
12,1,9/6/2015,19,1,"Yonkers, NY",Yasser A.,96,4.0,105,This was an amazing experience my wife bought us tickets for my birthday the food was excellent and the ambiance was really nice.  The only things I didn't like was the photographer went all around taking pictures of everyone except me and my wife and on the ticket my wife got it said first come first serve and we came early so we could get a window seat but they set those seats were already reserved.,2

16,3,5/22/2011,4999,1,"New York, NY",Phil H.,12703,4.0,3287,"This review is for the Maifest On The Hudson German Beerfest that I attended yesterday. It was set up at Pier 81 on the grounds right next to the World Yacht vessels. As we finally got some sunny warm weather it was the perfect setting on the water to listen to a live German band, watch men and women dressed in traditional German attire dance, drinks lots of Paulaner beer, eat pretzels and brats, and hang out with good friends under the communal beer tent. Prost!The event itself was well run, staff was friendly, there were five different styles of beer available with easy to get to beer stands, lots of food available, and the setting for the event was a great choice. Also, having access to the nice bathrooms at Pier 81/World Yacht was a plus. Beats the heck out of using the porta potties!Having the Van Leeuwen Ice Cream truck there was an added bonus! We each grabbed a cone of creamy cinnamon and chocolate and enjoyed a great dessert to end the day overlooking the water.I bought the tickets for the event at a big discount off of ThrillList. Even though the tickets for the beer and food were a bit costly, having the savings off the event tickets made up for it. Overall, a great way to spend a sunny spring day on the water.",4
17,5,2/4/2013,784,4,"Richmond, VA",Han V.,911,5.0,492,I had a blast cruising around the Statue of Liberty in this boat!The ship was reserved for my group and we got to spend the entire evening dining and partying on the ship. The dinner was decent but it was really the experience that made it memorable. You can see the NYC skyline from the deck and the views are breathtaking! The DJ was also pretty good so it just made the evening that much more enjoyable.,6
18,2,7/19/2016,0,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Mignon S.,0,1.0,4,"Service was horrible. We boarded at 6:15 and sat down at tour table at 6:30. We didn't eat dinner until 8pm. Yup that's how long it took to get our food. It took even longer to get wine after they kept messing up our order and then sending it to the wrong table. I ordered a cake for my girlfriend, who just graduated from medical school and they came with a cake that said ""Happy Birthday""...... real nice.  $115 is a lot of money for skirt steak that we waited 2 hours for. And I have had better at other places for a LOT less.Stay away from this place. If you want to ride for free to enjoy the view, then go ahead and order drinks only. Having a sit down dinner with them, extremely bad idea and WAYYYYYY over priced. Food NOT worth it.",
19,5,8/8/2014,32,1,"Richmond, VA",Erin P.,292,4.0,179,"Our 14th wedding anniversary -- what better way to spend it than to enjoy a dinner cruise in NYC. This is not a casual attire cruise at dinner. Men are required to wear a dress shirt and women are asked to wear evening or business attire. (Sneakers, shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops and tank tops not permitted on-board at any time). My husband made a huge mistake by not buying tickets directly through World Yacht -- instead he purchased through a vendor (Viator).  Not only did he pay more but our seats were lousy  -- appreciate him trying but those of you considering buying this package go directly through World Yacht and request a table with a view. The cruise begins at Pier 81 with a voyage down the Hudson river with breathtaking views of NYC at night. (Cruise begins at 7:00 pm and ends at 10:00 pm). There was a live band playing everything from Sinatra to Marley. The dinner comprised of a four course meal all made with fresh ingredients. Not sure if the menu is the same for every cruise but we were offered the following -- we could choose 1 of each:1) Amuse Bouche: we were given a fresh squeezed watermelon shot2) Appetizers: Grilled Vegetable Timbale or Baby Arugula Salad or Maryland Lump Crab Cake 3) Entrees: Atlantic Salmon, Lemon Thyme Chicken Breast or New York Strip or  Garganelli Pasta4) Desserts: Chocolate Ganache or New York Cheesecake (they can accommodate special diet request as well as vegetarian items)The food was surprisingly good. My husband ordered the crab cake, salmon, and cheesecake. I went with the baby arugula salad, lemon thyme chicken breast and cheesecake, While waiting for each course to be served -- we would head to the outdoor deck to take in the sights of the gorgeous NYC skyline. After dinner was served we danced a little to the live band but ultimately settled in on the outdoor deck that is furnished with comfortable over sized chairs. Only negative -- they still allow people to smoke on the outdoor decks. Hard to enjoy your glass of champagne or wine when there is smoke being blown in your face. The cruise takes you around the tip of Manhattan up the East River passing under the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge --- then heading towards the Statue of Liberty and back to Pier 81. Parking is available on the pier for $35. We chose to park at a garage very close to the pier for about $25 (not worth the $10 savings to walk that far to the closest garage). Would we do this again? Absolutely, we had a wonderful time --- but will book through World Yacht requesting window seating and will pay extra to park on the pier. $127.00 a person ages 12 and up. They offer different packages so be sure to visit their website for more information. worldyacht.com/site/home…",10
20,,11/13/2014,0,,"Bronx, NY",Grady W.,3,4.0,11,"Four of us took the dinner cruise on the yacht duchess. Everything went well. As expected the highlight of the excursion was the Manhattan and New Jersey skyline at night around to the Brooklyn bridge and back to pier 81, especially freedom tower and the extended time spent at the Statue of Liberty on the way back.The food was surprising better than expected, not haute cuisine, but pretty good given the price and view. Service was fine.The only deceptive part of the cruise was the attempt to obtain double tipping.The way they work it is this: when you reserve your non refundable tickets to dinner you pay on top of the advertised dinner cruise price fix price of $107 an ""administrative service charge"" of 20%. So now the price for four is about $500 without any extras such as cocktails or wine. But don't haha think this service charge is for any dinner service. Lol.  At the end of the dinner even if you order no additional items you will get a bill with ""suggested"" tips of $60 $80 $100 or whatever, depending if you had extra drinks. And you thought that you had paid the service charge! Haha lol.Since the person who ordered the tickets was genuinely misled on what a service charge of 20% was for in the first place, she declined to pay any additional service charge. According to the manager, the servers are forbidden to explain the distinction between service charges.An additional tip is to bring ear plugs as the music gets much louder as the evening and the music decades progress. There are comfy chairs on the upstairs deck, please ask about arrangements before having wheelchairs as the narrow steep stairs require special treatment.",5

It is my second time visiting the world yacht. I do believe is slightly over priced, but then again i don't know how their other boats are, I was on the Dutches. The food is a 7/10, my appetizer which was a lobster Mac &cheese came out cold so I changed it for a salad which was super good. My bf had an onion tart, which was also cold but he ate it anyways. For our main plates he had the filet mignon, medium (the best way to order it) I had the salmon, but again slightly cold. The vegetables made up for it because they were still warm...Oh! And there's always warm bread going around.Live DJ, a spacious dance floor. We had a very pleasant night. Wished it wasn't snowing so hard & actually step out to see the Statue of Liberty.",

Brunch was bland and drab, and the bacon and sausage was so burnt that it was inedible. Should have remade it but they didn't so no one at my table could eat it.

I have gone with co-workers, with friends, and with family members, and it has always been a great time.

Literally consistently turned her back to us and ignored us. Served our food already somewhat cold. It came to the point where the couple sitting next to us felt bad since their waitress was always around them and shared their champagne with us. Probably the worst wait staff I have ever dealt with.",4
25,,11/29/2014,222,,"Frederick, MD",Jennifer C.,39,1.0,66,"Food was terrible. The crab cake appetizer was dry, hard and bland. The salmon entree was undercooked, not seared or crunchy on top and flavorless. Also why were both of these served without lemon? The wild rice was overcooked. Fortunately the vegetables were still crunchy not overcooked. The dessert was too sweet.  If a business owner reads my review, please, invest into a better menu or chef. I can see how if this dining experience was sufficient or great, I would do this again. Although the terrible food was so that I made the experience a rip off.As to the tour. The DJ plays recorded music. Nothing live. And there dance floor is small and under utilized. I have enjoy salsa, tango, west coast swing and other dances but this is more for the children to run around the tiny dance floor to mediocre recorded music.The tour around was nice.  Although the photography comes up to take a photo of your table when there is nothing in view outside and the photo doesn't capture the view. Just your table which is nothing special for a photo. Bland set table.I should have checked reviews prior to notice that others had  less than desirable experiences. Would not have wasted the precious night in New York doing this. Much better options elsewhere.",
26,2,2/17/2013,25,5,"Perth Amboy, NJ",Michael S.,0,2.0,41,"This review is for the Valentines dinner cruise we went on February 16th, 2013.Let me start off by saying that I have been on this cruise a few times in the past.  On this particular night they were all setup with a Valentines theme.  There was a private party on the top floor so all of the Valentines couples were restricted to the lower level.We were seated in the rear of the boat by the bar.  Strike one.  If you plan on booking dinner reservations on this boat, make sure you request to sit away from the bar, or upgrade to a window seat.  Very typical NY seating, basically you are on top of the table next to you.  Don't expect anything spacious or private.Our server's name was Margarita.  She was ok.  Not too swift with the english language, but she had a bubbly personality.  She did however look swamped with too many tables, and on more then one occasion took forever with our overpriced drinks.  Be prepared to pay about $15 for a watered down mixed drink and almost $9 for a beer.This is a set menu except for your entree.  Amuse Bouche - We started our meal off with smoked salmon tartar with cucumber and citrus.  It was actually very pleasant.  Had a nice smoked flavor.  Appetizer -  The soufflé of corn with smoked oysters was pretty bad.  It had the consistency of a dunkin donuts corn muffin with some chewy oyster pills stuffed in there.  The bacon bits and sour cream on top didn't really help it out that much.Entree - Me and my girlfriend both had the hand cut Filet Mignon.  It was cooked to perfection in a cabernet demi glace sauce with a potato puree.  This was the best thing on our menu.  It wasn't the best steak I ever had by no means, but it was decent compared to everything else we ate.  The string bean were still a little frozen, so we just kind of skipped those.Dessert - The warm chocolate ganache cake was nice and warm with a gooey créme anglaise in the middle, topped with some cold whipped cream.  Mine was cooked to perfection, but my date's was overcooked and crumby.  After you go around the statue of liberty the DJ tries to pick up the music from elevator to top 40.  I have been around many good DJ's and this guy isn't one of them.  He was blending dance records with slow records with records that just didn't make sense.  People would dance, then sit down, then get up and groups, then cha cha slide, it was rather ridiculous.  I must say the DJ was a major downer, and I feel they should invest a couple of more bucks into somebody decent.  Overall, I would not recommend this dinner cruise to anyone.  As I mentioned before, I have been on this boat a few times.  None of those times really stand out to me.  This time it did stand out but not in a good way.  Do yourself and go to a good restaurant instead, followed by a good NY lounge.  This way you will be guaranteed good food, music, and dancing.  The only thing your basically paying for on that cruise is the view and boat fuel.  Skip it.",12

29,,10/24/2012,3,,"Manhattan, NY",Stacy S.,1,3.0,13,"World Yacht - Brunch Cruise around the Statue of LibertyBottom line:  A fun, unique brunch experience - especially when friends visit NYC for the first time.Tips:    Seasonal brunching only: Sundays April 8 - Oct 28, 2012.    $68 (after taxes/fees) gets you a full buffet of breakfast and lunch food and one free drink.    Expect a touristy crowd.About:  Of all the brunch options in NYC, brunch on a boat never really came to mind.  But why not? What better way to see the skyline and get up close and personal with Lady Liberty than cruising the Hudson while sipping mimosas!Food:  The brunch package includes all-you-can-eat and one beverage.  The food was buffet style, with a mix of breakfast and lunch food items (from baked goods, fresh fruit and salads, to breakfast dishes, lunch dishes and desserts).  The food wasn't spectacular, but none of us had anything negative to say about it.   Atmosphere:  Best part for me was the music - having a piano playing gently in the background while getting breakfast is always a welcome change.  Worst part, the linty cloth napkins on my black dress pants.The overall atmosphere on the boat was nice - the dress code was business casual and the waiters were very nice and polite.  The boat, as to be expected, was filled with tourists and their families.Was it worth the price...? I probably won't do it again. It was fun, but if I have friends in town I would probably do brunch somewhere in the city and do a sightseeing cruise separately.Also to note, the cruise doesn't go around Manhattan - just from Pier 81 to the Statue of Liberty and turn back, so you don't get to see the full downtown Manhattan 'cruise' experience.",2

On the plus side, it was a BEAUTIFUL day out and really nice just to be on the water, and we were there with good company. Also, the band was fun and the boat ride up the river was good.The negatives, however, included ridiculously expensive tickets ($20 per person to get in, $8 for a beer, $8 for a hotdog) so by the time we had a few beers we had dropped $100 for two people, the boat was late to leave but still brought us back promptly at 4pm so we missed 20 minutes of the ride we paid for, and they did not have very much in terms of seats or even a tent to cover the workers who were preparing the really bad/cheap food (but who, to their credit, were generally friendly).

But, the service was excellent. We went there for our anniversary last month. And I got the big package. The 5 course dinner with the full open bar. I did get a deal however using a coupon. And I like the fact that everyone on the cruise did not treat us any different just because we used a coupon. The cruise ship was nice. Good DJ... good music. Too bad it was too cold for us to hang out on the top deck. Tip: -For the buy one get on 50% use Destinationcoupons.com.-And make sure you get there early. The earlier you get there the better seats you get at the front of the boat and near the windows depending on the type of ticket. -And make sure you are dressed up. Nice place to impress your first date or your wife for 50 years.",9

34,,4/1/2013,2,,"Chicago, IL",Joanna V.,7,1.0,19,"This review is for the Duchess on March 31, 2013.  I'll start by saying I rarely give bad reviews (I think this is my first ever 1 star review) because I'm usually pretty easy to please.  My husband and I had taken a dinner cruise on Bateaux New York for a milestone birthday, and when my mom was in town this weekend, we decided to try World Yacht.I'll start with the positive - the actual cruise around Manhattan was nice and when my mom and friend arrived really early, they allowed them to sit at the table waiting for us.  The table was by the window.  The beautiful view of Manhattan tried to make up for the poor service.  The food was better than the Bateaux ship, so no real complaints for the quality of the food.The negatives - where to begin.  We joined my mom and her friend at our table, and about 10 minutes later someone came by to drop off our menus and take our jackets (no real problem here).  However, it took another 20 minutes for our waiter to come back to take our drink and dinner order.  Drinks then took about another 10 minutes.  This really shocked us because included in the price of the ticket was dinner, but the drinks were at an upcharge - you'd think the waiters would be more prompt with the drinks and want their tables drinking since that's how they can make more money.  It wasn't just our waiter, it looked like slow service throughout the ship. Our waiter never asked if we wanted another drink - we had to flag someone down to ask for another glass of wine.   After that glass, we again were not offered.  Dinner service was slower than usual, which is fine because we're on a boat, and I would expect that dinner would last the entire cruise.  What really disappointed me though was that the DJ started playing really loud music right after we finished our salads - making any table conversation impossible.  This was not a ""club"" boat, and my expectations were that we would be able to have a nice conversation and catch up with my mom.  The pounding music lasted for the last two hours of the cruise, so we're basically eating our meal in silence, and every once and a while trying to gesture something or other.   If I had known the music was going to be so loud, I would not have booked this ship. I'm in my thirties, so loud music, when appropriate and I'm expecting it, doesn't bother me, but for a ""dinner cruise"", I would expect to actually be able to enjoy dinner and the company of my companions.  Had service been a little faster (both food and drinks), we may have been able to escape to the upper deck so that we could talk.  But, it didn't work out.  The other thing that made me absolutely miserable is that the ship was freezing.  It was nice to sit by the window, but the draft was terrible.  When I finally did go upstairs for a few minutes while the bill was being paid, I realized that the heat wasn't on throughout the ship.  Somewhat minor point, but you combine loud music, slow food and drink service and being cold, it was just miserable.  I'm not a complainer, but this experience was torture.  I couldn't wait to get off the ship.",5

The tables are set for fine dining and the staff is dressed for the occasion.The evening that we took the dinner cruise there was a large party for a rehearsal dinner and another large party of business men.  They were catered to, while the rest of us were barely taken care of.  We ordered drinks a good half hour after being seated and another half hour later we received them.  We waited a good hour for our appetizers and it continued to roll down hill.  The food was cold, very bland, probably the worst filet I have ever eaten.  My husband had duck and said it was tough and ""lousy"", my mother had the trout and said it would be good if it were warm to hot.  The staff did not really care and we booked a window table and paid big bucks for this cruise.   A great and ""relaxing"" way to see Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, however like me, if you've been to both skip this cruise,  it is not worth a tenth of the money that we each spent!Note*  The stairs are cumbersome, if wearing heels or you are elderly.  Stairs must be taken to enter and exit the dining room or to go on deck or to use the restroom.",15

46,,6/8/2011,4,1,"Forest Hills, NY",Veronica N.,5,1.0,35,"World Yacht has the WORST customer service EVER. DO NOT do business with these people. If I could give them 0 stars I WOULD! Back in August I was celebrating my first wedding anniversary, and my husband and I had been saving up for some time so we could do something nice. My husband was unemployed at the time, and myself, an artist, I don't make much money. My husband and I could only afford their brunch cruise (the cheapest one they have), but a moment after we had made the reservation we noticed we made it for the day AFTER our anniversary, as the Saturday of our anniversary did NOT serve brunch. Silly mistake, so within 2 minutes of making the reservation we called but they're calling center was closed. We left a message AND sent out an e-mail saying we wouldn't be coming for our brunch, we made an honest mistake, please help us change the date. Finally on Monday I was able to talk with a rep who said they couldn't help unless we paid another $40 in fees for the change. WTF, it's not like you went out and bought caviar on our behalf, we LITERALLY called 2 min after purchase and said we WONT be there. $40 is well worth a week of groceries, and we literally couldn't afford to pay a fee. After all at the time we lived paycheck to paycheck, or in this case commission to commission (crossing our fingers they would keep coming). Frustrated, my husband called back and the rep suggested to us to tell our bank it was FRAUD. Yes, FRAUD. He said that is how we would get our money back. My husband, 22 at the time, didn't think about the consequences and followed the rep's ""advice"". Of course this slapped us back in the face, as the company had records of the whole thing. We were recharged the $124 and now stuck. At this point I got in contact with a man named Steve, the accountant for World Yacht. I have to say this guy is really patient and he did go out of his way for me. Probably the only good thing about the company. He tried to work to get my fee down from $40 to $20 as a courtesy and I believe to cover the mistake of a dumb rep, but by the time he got the OK, it was the weekend of Halloween. I was going to be out of town that weekend, I had already bought the tickets, booked the hotel, etc, but Steve informed me that it was the LAST DAY World Yacht would be sailing FOR THE YEAR. I literally had to screw over my family and friends and my visit or pay and extra $20 for a service I had already paid for. I chose family.Fast forward to 2011  and the saga continues. It was warm outside so I decided they might be open, and time to make my calls again. I spoke with Steve again who was willing to help, but reluctant because of the time (Sorry I waited so long to call you, YOU WERE CLOSED FOR MONTHS!! my bad!). He told me to call a Ms. Campbell who was extremely RUDE with me. I was speaking to her all nice, and you could just hear her tone of voice slowly escalate, I was just thinking the whole time ""What's her problem? I'm obviously not giving her attitude, I'm calling for help!"". Eventually my tone changed due to her nasty way of treating me, and we literally got NO WHERE. She told me she wouldn't be able to help me at all, even if I paid my fee because too much time passed. WTF! Your policy says that I have to pay a fee for changes, there is NO MENTION of a time frame. BS LADY, BS!!! She ended the conversation telling me to deal with my bank about it, which I told her I've already done 2 claims, the first one being fraud, suggested by one of YOUR employees. This lady literally had no remorse for me, no patience (as she was hostile after her first sentence on the phone...even though we never spoke before) or a sense of customer service. She told me she had to go because she had other customers waiting. BS, you have an answering service, unless of course you're getting THAT MANY COMPLAINTS that you need to take care of.

(don't take my word for it though) Everything was just wonderful.The boat ride was for three hours but it won't feel like it because I guarantee you, you'll be too busy taking a billion pictures in between every meal (or was that only me? ""baby, put your fork down I want to take a picture with that bk bridge hurry.."") Not that the food wasn't good, it was definitely good, all five courses were good but I swear I felt like a tourist that night as if I don't live in NYC and as if I don't see the beautiful skyline everyday.  Admit  it though, us New Yorkers does take the city for granted, there really is no place like NYC. The views of NYC was just breathtaking and for a moment really, it felt like I was on vacation. The weather that day was perfection, not too hot and not too cold (although towards the end when we were inside the boat, the AC was on blast and it was freezing in there)The staff were absolutely on point and very attentive, everytime we left our table to take a picture (or 30) our table napkins were always folded as if noone has ever touched them, our drinks were always re-filled and they would always come by and ask if we needed anything. They were amazing. (I wish I wrote their names down, they definitely deserve credit for their hard work).The highlight of the night was definitely a surprise for both my boyfriend and I, when we first boarded the ship, we were of course greeted by one of our lovely waiters and he asked us if this was our first boat ride and we said yes it was and that we were here to celerbate our first anniversary. I should have known when he gave us that sneaky smile and said ""alright alright, congratulations to both of you..."" that he had something in store for us......and just as I assumed towards the end of the cruise, right after they had already given us our dessert and my boyfriend & I just received our probably 10th glass of champagne which by then we were also giving our billionth toast to one another lol both our waiter and waitress and the rest of their gang came to our table with a huge bowl of fruits and a candle, complete with a loud announcement Congratulating us on our first anniversary together....""Ladies & Gentlemen, please give a round of applause for Carlo & MO who is here to celebrate their first anniversary together...."" The whole crowd (who were also amazing and so friendly) gave us a huge round of applause and a lot of ""Congratulations"" compliments. It was definitely our 5 seconds of fame. LOL But overall it was definitely a night to remember, I loved every minute of it. We can't wait to go back this time we're taking both of our mothers just because. P.S. Ladies, make sure to bring flats, it will be extremely hard to walk in heels all night, I lasted about 5 minutes with my heels thank god I took my flats; heels + boat moving calls for disaster waiting to happen.",4

I contemplated purchasing the guaranteed window seats but decided against it at an additional $40pp. We were lucky that we ended up getting a window seat anyway, I guess due to the fact that they were not sold out on our cruise. The staff were excellent, everyone was absolutely nice, accommodating, and friendly! The ship itself is a little dated but still nice and clean. We sat in the corner of the dinning room and had a private table for two.The ship left promptly at 7pm, prior to sailing we were served drinks, bread, and a special appetizer from the chef. As the ship sailed we got our main appetizer, entree, and dessert. All of which were delicious! My husband opted for the jumbo strip appetizer and filet mignon entree which were at additional $10 each but worth it. I order the crab cake appetizer and duck entree which was pretty good.  I had pre arranged for a cake to be delivered to our table for his birthday. The waiters brought it out at the right time and totally surprised him and even sang happy birthday!! We opted to take the cake home so we can finish the dessert offered. They announced as the ship approached the statue of liberty, so everyone can go up and catch a view outside. At the dining room, the DJ announced all the birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions on the out loud. They played great music and the dance floor was filled and entertaining. Overall, I would recommend this experience for a special occasion. It is a chance to catch some great views of the city and enjoy a great meal at the same time. The service was excellent!!",1

We had window seats which had the most beautiful view of the city and once we were seated we were greeted and served immediately. We chose the gold menu although my friend ordered the shrimp cocktail and fillet Mignon which was ten dollars more i believe. The best thing on the menu was 1. World Yacht Signature Salad (omg i would have ordered more and ate it as a meal it was so tasty) 2. Seared Pork chop- juicy, tender and the sauce was mouthwatering, the garnishes of string beans and seasoned potatoes were yummy as well 3. Filet Mignon- of course it's filet mignon lol3. Raspberry tart- yum! so delicious and surprisingly light 4 The World Yacht Appletini (YUM)The only thing we weren't too crazy about was the three tier pudding dessert that my friend had, but it wasn't bad at all just not our fav... After the scrumptious meal (and a few cocktails) we headed to the dance floor and then the upper deck where there's a cool lounge feel to it...couches to sit and watch lady liberty shine on NYC.

I prefer to dine on Filet Mignon, sip champagne, and watch the fireworks from the expansive upper deck.Don't go cheap and opt for the Circle Line dinner cruise. It's not worth it.  I did the Circle Line once and during several moments in the evening I actually contemplating jumping overboard and swiming for land.  They pack you in like sardines and feed you diner food.  Spend the extra few bucks and treat yourself and your date to a really memorable experience.  I promise you won't leave disappointed.The food was very good, service was excellent, and there's a live band for dancing.  All in all, a unique experience.",4

Updated review",52,3,"Castro Valley, CA",Deepti R.,7,5.0,56,"This was my first experience on a yacht for dinner and dance and I would say this was the BEST and AWESOME tour and time I have spent in my life.There was a long line for the cruise, and I was surprised by the number of people coming in. The hostess sat us down for a table of two. First they brought out the bread- choice from white to wheat. Then they brought our first appetizer sorta like a dumpling, was cold so I really couldnt taste the flavor. They have good choices for wine, mainly from California. As being from California I choice Syrah (Shiraz) which wasn't from CA, tasty! (forgot where it was from)Our servers were really nice. We had to buy the drinks as it wasn't included in the 4 course meal dinner. Boyfriend had the rumrunner which was really good. I think he drank quite a few cos everytime the waitress came by she said the usual! So you get it :)The yacht top was the best- open with good seating around and you can see NY city and takes you around the statue of liberty. BTW the cruise is for 3 hours and you better carry a sweater, as it gets chilly.For appetizer I chose duck salad- good, and bf chose salmon trio (pay extra)- good different flavored salmon. Main course for me was the filet mignon(medium rare) with mashed potatoes and vegies. The filet mignon was so soft and tasty. Bf had the filet mignon with lobster (pay extra)- which he devoured.There was choice for dessert- it was cheesecake, fruits, and chocolate cake. It was so tasty!!! Should I say more.And everyone working there are awesome and really helpful....",6

DO get one of the open bar packages if you plan on drinking as individual drinks are quite pricey ($14 dollars for a margarita i believe). DONT expect too much from the food, especially if you're tastebuds are use to NYC standards. DO take advantage of the top deck's lounge area.",
63,,12/17/2013,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Lauren L.,0,5.0,2,"Friday night I took my cousins on the World Yacht cruise to enjoy a nice night out in the city-this cruise completely exceeded my expectations! When we first walked in it felt like we arrived at a wedding. The decor was beautiful and the wait staff was on top of it. When we started cruising, it was such an amazing view of the city, especially during our night time cruise. Being a native New Yorker, my expectations were low as I see the city every day, but being on the water, on such a beautiful yacht was an awesome experience. We pulled up close to the Statue and were able to take breathtaking pictures. THe food was great and the music was awesome. All in all we had a blast and my out of town cousins loved it! I woudl highly recommend this cruise to anyone!",
64,2,8/28/2010,83,3,"Township of Washington, NJ",Arella A.,1,4.0,38,"I was planning to surprise my husband for his birthday with tickets to a dinner cruise... I first bought 2 tickets to another cruise then after reading the yelp! review I was turned off... It was more of a booze cruise party boat deal..with crappy food. So I bought tickets to World Yacht after reading the yelp! reviews of course. And all that is said was right! It was wonderful, the views were breath taking, the music was live and good, the food was so-so...the duck salad was kind of gross but the Salmon made up for it. It was expensive for what you got... 50 bucks for a rack of lamb..kinda outrageous. 15 dollars for a martini... But over all it was a great experience and my husband was definitely surprised...oh and the first cruise I passed on floated by with wasted people screaming...glad I went with World Yacht!",2
65,,3/22/2011,11,,"Merrick, NY",Terry B.,27,4.0,119,"We got half-price tickets to this online and waited until almost expiration time to use them. From the beginning, we found the staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful. There are two decks here, and we got a seat on the upper. We checked the lower deck out briefly and decided that we wouldn't have enjoyed this as much if we'd been put down there - cavernous and somewhat noisy. Our cruise did not come with a dinner, so we eventually ordered from the appetizer menu. The food and drink was quite good, but portions were on the tiny side. I'd have liked to see more choices, but that's about my only qualm. The cruise itself was magnificent, leaving minutes after sunset. It was clear weather, and it happened to be the night of a full moon, which peeked out over Brooklyn as we were approaching the bridges. Highly recommended, even if you have taken harbor cruises before.",1
66,1,6/30/2010,214,,"San Francisco, CA",Hannah M.,28,5.0,65,"Went on a dinner cruise for a work party and had a really nice time. The views are obviously spectacular, the food's good and the music was fun. The actual facilities are nothing too fancy, but nice and clean. The most impressive part of the evening by far was the service. Those guys are SO on the ball, making sure everyone's happy all the time. (One guy even literally ran after my boyfriend with another beer because he'd accidentally given him a less cold one. At that point my boyfriend said, ""Does Yelp let you review yachts? These guys deserve a good review."" That they do.)",3
67,,6/21/2011,12,,"Dallas, TX",Liz L.,0,2.0,5,"The food was mediocre but the view was nice.   The boat brought you pretty close to the Statue of Liberty.   Waitstaff was not attentive.  This would be a great cruise for older couples that want to celebrate a special occasion.  The music was live and decent for those that would like to dance.  But when I say dance, I don't mean let's get low.",
68,,5/2/2012,2,,"Mebane, NC",Jessica S.,3,3.0,75,"Since the Statue of Liberty is undergoing renovations until this fall and you can't actually go inside of the torch until the renovations are completed, on my recent visit to NYC, we opted to not take the ferry to the island and to instead catch a view of it while on a brunch cruise with World Yacht.  The pier is easily accessible.  We stayed in Midtown and walked there in about 20 minutes.   There looked to be plenty of available parking, should you choose to drive.  Our reservations were accurate, and we had no problem boarding.  The check in staff was polite and began boarding promptly at 11:30.  The yachts are large, with plenty of space between tables, and decently appointed, although showing their age in some places. We were fortunate enough to get a table by the window, but there are wall to wall windows, so you can see the views of the skyline and the statue from any table.  The stairs leading to/from the upper/outside deck are a bit steep, but the staff was readily available-- and proactive-- about assisting people who looked as if they might require  a hand to steady them.   There is live piano music, which made the atmosphere feel more formal than it actually was.  I will say that I was disappointed that the dress code was not adhered to, nor enforced by the staff.  Some parties were dressed in appropriate brunch attire, some were in ratty jeans and t-shirts.  I would have liked it if there was a uniform application of the expectation, but, hey, I'm kind of old school when it comes to that sort of thing.  The wait staff was attentive and polite, always refilling coffee/waters and asking if you would like another drink  (one drink choice is included besides coffee/tea/water-- you can choose from several types of juice, soda, or a mimosa;  Your refills, additional drinks, and any liquor or wine that you decide to drink are extra, and billed to you at the completion of your meal.  The meal is buffet style, and there is a separate buffet set up on each of the dining levels (there are two dining levels).  The breakfast bar included fruit, bagels, toast, eggs, muffins/pastries, sausage, bacon, and waffles.  The lunch options included garden and caesar salads, green beans, stuffed chicken breast, and fish.  Dessert was brownies, mini cheesecakes, bread pudding, and a chilled oreo cookie topped chocolate pudding.  It is all you can eat, and every time I walked past the buffet, the staff was refilling/tending to it, so people were able to eat as much as they wanted to, for the entire 2.5 hour trip, if they chose to.   The temperature of the food was maintained appropriately, and the taste was, for the most part, typical of buffet style meals, which is to say from my own opinion, a bit bland, so as to appeal to the broadest amount of palates.  Several parties celebrated birthdays and special events and the (singing) staff brought cake to their tables (this costs extra).   I'm not big the waitstaff singing ""happy birthday"", but it was as tasteful as possible.  Food service began right after boarding, and people wasted no time lining up.  There appeared to be very little organization to the line, and the staff was not directing it, so we just waited until the majority of the other people had filled their plates before going up for our own food.  The restrooms were clean, and the tile work was gorgeous.  The dining decks are completely contained, so you don't have to worry about being out in the cold/sun/rain/whatever during your meal.  The upper deck is open with several seating areas.  The captain slows down when you approach the Statue of Liberty, and there is ample time to get photos.  Also, a staff member circulates and offers to take your photo for a fee (I believe it was $40 for 4 photos).  The views of the NYC skyline are breathtaking.  There were very few children on board, and none in high chairs.  A 2.5 hour meal/cruise in a contained area is asking a lot of young children, though, and I certainly wouldn't have wanted to bring my toddler along for this outing.  Little one's who get antsy will detract from your experience, and certainly, the dining experience of others. It's a big boat, but it's really a floating restaurant, plus there's the safety concerns of being on a boat.  Your kid can't run around freely, so you'll want to keep that in mind if you're ready to book this with kids in tow.  We enjoyed ourselves, and received good service.   I'm not sure I'd want to do it again the next time we're in town, but it was a nice, relatively short, excursion to do once, or once in a while.",2
69,,9/20/2010,100,1,"Birmingham, MI",Angela H.,3,3.0,30,The views of the city skyline and the statue of liberty were FIVE STARS. Amazingly beautiful. the service was terrible. We waited FOREVER for our food.. and it was not that good. We were never asked if we wanted dessert or anything.. which is fine because we didn't. It was expensive food for the bad service. The atmosphere was great.,
70,1,6/5/2009,51,1,"Franklin, TN",Mell F.,0,4.0,104,"We took this cruise on a visit to NYC last week. A MUCH better experience than I expected. I knew the views would be spectacular (and they were), but I didn't expect much on the food front.  I was very pleasantly surprised. The bread was fresh and there were several kinds. The duck on my salad was absolutely delicious. We both had filets. They were cooked properly and were very tender and tasty.  Dessert was average, but we were full anyway. The music was a little cheesy, so we just went on the upper deck  and took in the sites.Great staff. Exceeded expectations in every way.",3
71,1,10/16/2011,0,1,"Somerset, NJ",V. N.,0,4.0,139,I want more.  Went for the first time for an event - the Beauty Brunch.  Food tasted real good.  Service real good. Views.....  breathtaking and that was in the day time.  I would have liked it to last an extra 1.5 hrs so I could have received all the spa services I signed up for.   Water was choppy but that's expected for this time of year.  I wore a band on each wrist to avoid possible nausea.,1
72,1,7/28/2008,0,1,"New York, NY",Veronica O.,0,2.0,8,"Food - 3 stars.  The menu is pretty extensive.  However, about 1/4 the menu has an additional charge to it.  When you are paying more than $100/head, EVERYTHING had better be included.  I had the duck breast salad, the fillet (no extra charge) and my husband had the crab cakes appetizer and the chicken.  My duck breast salad had literally 2 TINY slices of duck breast, that I could barely taste.  The Crab cake was very good.  My fillet was pretty good, although it was cooked to WELL DONE rather than the MEDIUM that I had asked for.  I was too hungry to send it back to have it remade.  The chicken was unimpressive and had a weird flavor to it that I was not a fan of.  Both the chocolate cake and the cheesecake were terrible.  Service - 1 star.  The service was terrible.  It took 3 asks to get the waitress to bring us water.  It was about 20 minutes before anyone came up to take our drink order and another 40 minutes to order food.  The wine arrived well after we finished the first two courses (of 4).  In general, the courses were spaced out over the 3 hour cruise and the first two were tiny, so we were hungry, waiting for the main course to arrive, preventing us from getting up and enjoying the outside areas of the boat.  The dessert arrived as we were docking at 11pm.   Overall, I think that it was just the setup of the cruise - that they space out the meal so you are constantly waiting for the next course, rather than enjoying the boat/dancing but we were not fans of this setup.  Dancing/DJ - 1star.  We weren't expecting much of the whole music/dancing so we weren't too disappointed.  The DJ played mostly slow songs.  A few couples danced but the music was like bad wedding music.  Sights - 4 stars.  New York is beautiful at night.  The boat circles the Statue of Liberty for a good 10 minutes so there is plenty of time for pictures, etc.   I wish the structure of the meal afforded us more time to hang out on the deck and take in New York at night rather than rushing back every few minutes to see if they were serving the next course. Value - 1 star.  The evening cost $300 including tax, tip, wine, etc.  For the experience, it wasn't worth it.  I'd recommend taking a night circle line tour and going to one of the awesome restaurants on Manhattan.  That would cost less and probably be way more enjoyable.  People - The crowd was a total mix - very diverse.  There were young people, old people, families, of all ethnic backgrounds.",4
73,,9/8/2009,2,,"New York, NY",Anna D.,0,4.0,35,Worth it if you get the 50% deal (expires 9/31/09).. if you book the dinner the same day- Definitely a must do for anyone visiting nyc. Dont worry about not getting a resi... the boat was not full on a Friday night.,

78,,1/9/2011,0,,"Queens, NY",Maria Y.,0,1.0,4,"On their website, World Yacht clearly states under ""The Entertainment"":   ""The city's your dancing partner.  World Yacht offers an evening as magical as the movies.  An eclectic mix of DJs and live musicians invites guests to dance the night away with friends, or cheek to cheek with that special someone"".   The husband of my girlfriend decided to give her a birthday party on World Yacht because we are a group of ballroom dance students, and what better way to celebrate than to have a dinner-dance cruise?  He even paid for the dance instructors to come and dance with us, and rented a bus for the trip.  Well, it turns out that there was no DJ, and there were no live musicians.  We were quite perplexed because we had been on a World Yacht cruise before and the music starts almost immediately as soon as the ship leaves port.  Upon inquiring, we were told that the DJ had an accident and could not make it (it also explains why the ship sailed late, past 7 pm).  What made it even worse was that World Yacht did not have a Plan B.  Apparently, they only had one CD on board - an old one of Gloria Estefan.  Nothing personal against Gloria, who has some really nice dance tunes, but listening to Conga several times on an expensive dinner-dance cruise was not exactly what we expected.  Several of us spoke to the manager, Yolanda, who said she was trying to do something about it, but she never succeeded.  She even asked us to help her out with radio stations to play.  So all night we were alternating between Gloria Estefan's old CD, and staticky radio stations with all their commercials.  How can a business that boasts of dinner and dancing not have an alternate plan if a DJ does not show up?  Would it have been too much to expect the boat to have a set of CDs or an iPod just in case the DJ could not make it?  How difficult would that be?  In addition, had we been informed before the ship sailed that we were not going to get what we had expected, we could probably have asked the guests to get their CDs in their cars and make the best of the trip!!  Or we could have been given the option to sail on another date!!  But no - we were out in the water with no other option by the time we found out that we would not be able to dance as expected.  I felt really sorry for my girlfriend, who was so apologetic and said that we could have just gone to a regular restaurant, instead of going through all this trouble and expense.  The dinner was not bad, but we feel that our friends should get at least a 50% refund for this disappointing birthday party, because the entertainment was not delivered as advertised.",3
