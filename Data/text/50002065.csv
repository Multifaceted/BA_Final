Updated review","Horrible service! I was told there was a birthday package from the promoter. Once I got there, I was told by the bottle girl ""There's no birthday package on sunday. I had to pay full prices on the bottle. False advertisement! Second, three bottles of hennessy came out to be $780 smh!. Last but not least, it was $100 to get in.",,,
2,Janice B.,"Bronx, NY",25,8,8,1.0,9/17/2018,"Vacca Lounge, where do I begin,  I went here for my sisters birthday brunch one omg this whole experience was disgustingly disappointing. First off they don't have real drinking glasses and they don't clean them properly 3 people had to send theirs back. Second the mimosas and sangrias were disrespectfully watered down or they used some really cheap champagne they were horrible. Third the food omg they food disgusting it was cold like they made it 6 hours prier to us getting there it was  just really bad so bad I would never recommend anyone I like to this place well only if they want to hear music and hookah because to be honest that's the only thing that's good there.",,,
3,Marlett G.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,5,0,1.0,4/10/2018,"unprofessionalI haven't gone here yet and was already getting the run around and attitude over the phone. I emailed them regarding the an event I wanted to do and she called me like 10 minutes later close to 11pm at night. I'm thinking they were at least going to call me at a reasonable time next day but I guess that my fault for assuming. She was rude from jump, like asking me what I want and how many ppl are going, etc. I told her it might be 10 ppl and shes like it only 8 ppl per table mind you online doesn't state that and even though you will be getting a table that guys have to pay cover charge regardless on guess list and girls are only free before 12:30. wtf is that!! I never have gone to a place that I PURCHASE bottles and hookah and I still pay additional entry fee, they bugging... I'll stay my ass in the city.  As far as the other reviews seems about right on not going to this place.",1,,
4,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,8,1.0,1/24/2018,"I came here once years ago and met Dascha Polanco. That's my one and only fond memory of this corny ass spot!!! They had a flyer that said La Insuperable would be performing here tonight and it was free for ladies till 12:30am. BARE LIES!!! Not only were they not open at the time they said they would be, so I had to double back to another spot to chill till 12, but when I came back they said it was 20 bucks entry for everyone, PLUS a MANDATORY 5 dollar coat check for each person. Que clase negocio, que clase chapeo!!! The money isn't the issue lol it's that they false advertised. At least keep it real. We're all grown ass adults. So yes, after my 1.5 hour commute here, I am so pissed off that the first thing I did when I came inside was draft this review lmao Moral of the story:Give the money you thought about spending here to your momma. This establishment does not deserve one cent of your money. If I hadn't come this far I would've turned right around just for the slick shit they pulled. Extremely off-putting and TACKY.",5,4,
5,Farah N.,"New York, NY",2,16,28,4.0,5/12/2018,"We came on a sunday for brunch, not too may people but great (latin) music. Food was delicious, brunch included an appetizer + entree + bottomless sangria/mimosas. Drinks on point & the waiter was really attentive. All for $35. Can't beat this.",,,
6,Viv K.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/6/2018,"The hostess/manager is extremely unprofessional and rude. Although the brunch options were nice the food was not that great. The salad that was served was soggy, the mangu and salami dish actually got me extremely sick. The mimosa was full of ice and extremely weak. I would not recommend this place for bruch or anything for that matter.",,,
7,Lily K.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/3/2018,"Worst choice of the night. I was so upset that the bouncer was trying to bag check and search my clothing. She touched it too hard, it was super uncomfortable.",,,
8,Aria J.,"Nyack, NY",0,2,3,4.0,6/29/2018,"Came here on a Thursday night for a birthday dinner. Ambience was very nice, but it was surprisingly empty for a Thursday night. Food and drinks were great. We all indulged in a range of the menu. (Shout out to the bomb elote). All of the staff was really nice. They have hookah, on that night the first round was free and refills were $15 each which isn't bad. Even though it is a fairly new spot I was expecting more people to be here on a Thursday night. With some promotion, this spot would be poppin!! I intend on coming back soon",,,
9,Yanderi F.,"Bronx, NY",76,20,9,1.0,5/29/2018,"Came here for brunch and was extremely disappointed. First, we sat down and for about 20-25 mins no one came to give us water or take our orders. The only person that came around twice was a hookah guy. Second, every time we tried to get one of the waiter's attention he was give us a hand signal say ""1 minute"". We were all so annoyed, but we waited. We finally got someone's attention and he took our order. I clearly told him what I wanted, but he got my order wrong twice it wasn't until the 3rd plate that he got it correct. The waiter was very nice, but clearly there wasn't enough staff for a busy Sunday brunch. Management should really consider having more staff on busy days!! -If you decide to go just be ready to wait. Also, the mimosas were really bad. They had good deals for bottle service, but we were so discouraged that we decided to leave.",1,,
10,Yerelyn G.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/18/2018,food is very bland and came out over cooked and cold. they aren't very organized when it comes to bringing out dishes on time. wouldn't recommend coming for a meal. may be a better lounge than restaurant.,,,
11,Moet A.,"Atlantic City, NJ",0,3,1,1.0,8/24/2018,"First off if I could give no stars I would! I'm in this shitty establishment rn and it's a good vibe except for their level of professionalism and courtesy. We reserved tables, have 14 ppl turning into 20 or so we bought a package of 6 bottles they said it's not enough and for 14 ppl we need to buy 9 bottles thennnnnnnn these people try to say we can only get one small table for 14 ppl and 6 bottles. This is absolutely ridiculous and honestly unprofessional. I personally work in hospitality at a bar and we would never treat paying customers like this. Don't come here it's a scam, their cheap, unprofessional and money hungry. I wouldn't recommend this place to the devil!",,,
12,Alexis R.,"Floral Park, NY",399,731,191,3.0,9/10/2017,This club is extremely crowded on Friday but it is a very fun place. Fun but you have to pay to have fun. $40 for ladies and they push you to getting bottle service. I think that is a scam to be honest. I guess they want to make money and also $15 for refills for the hookah and cash only be careful. They played good music and it was a good vibe. Valet parking available. The staff was decent and dealt with the crowd. There is an atm in the back of the club but they dont want to tell you that. If you come just prepare to spend to have a good time.,2,,

15,Tayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",162,107,435,1.0,11/28/2016,Like previous reviews state: Vacca is disappointing. A friend of mine called for her birthday to get logistics for the evening. She was told free entry for all before a certain time and ladies free all night. Our group of 10+ arrive and now we're being told a completely different story by the woman at the door. Now I'm thinking its miscommunication you know? Sometimes promoters numbers are listed on certain websites or theres always someone on the job who's just lost. But this was not the case. I call the number as I'm sure my friend did and it goes right to the woman's phone upfront! I'm looking right at my number calling on her phone. So it had to have been her wanting to charge us because we were a large group. What a shame. Bad business move and she definitely lost out. BTW - there were still people eating dinner and the lounge floor had not fully opened up at 11pm. So to be charged was an insult. We moved and had a better time around the corner.,4,,
16,Sandra C.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,4,0,1.0,7/1/2018,"Vacca lounge was my first time there last night and also my last time. Came here to celebrate my friends bday. Don't recommend this place at all. Valet was 25, admission was 20 and when you get to the bar there credit card machine don't work. You need to go to this place with cash only!!!  Also DJ sucks!!!And apparently all the seats are reserved for bottle service only. So if you not buying bottles you can't sit down cause one of the workers at Vacca told my friend to get up where we all brought 7 drinks. My friends and I was overdressed for this place. They said ""dress to impress"" but when we got there guys  was in sneakers and T-shirts and so ladies was in flats.",,,
17,Janay M.,"New York, NY",297,113,54,1.0,2/20/2016,"Well well well. What a way to start my return to the Yelper life. Dear Vacca Grill & Lounge,You are gorgeous that you are. Now just because you know you're hot stuff doesn't mean you get to have crap service. As I browsed a Groupon email I spotted a decent deal for what looked like a nice date spot. Included in our groupon was an app to share, (2) Entrées and (2) glasses of house sangria. After looking over the menu I decide on  the Vacca Crab Pasta and the bf wants steak. The server informs us that we can only choose from the Main section of the menu. The bf can't have seafood so the only option open to him was Chicken Parmesan. Blah who wants that from a Dominican joint whose name means ""COW"".  After arguing with the hostess/""manager"" she agreed to let us both order from the pasta portion of the menu. We decide to get hummus for our app as its the ONLY non seafood thing available. After 30 minutes our Hummus came out and tasted ok. I mean we've had better off of food trucks but whatever. Finally the food arrived my pasta looked so yummy and smelled great. The bf on the other hand well let's just say a picture is worth 1000 words. I'm so over you Vacca that I'm writing you this letter as I wait for my uber to get the hell out of here. I'd rather grab a hot dog from the corner than eat here.",7,4,1
18,Ivette E.,"Valley Stream, NY",96,84,170,5.0,5/29/2016,"We came here on a groupon, and were so pleased. The decor is cool and the food & service were Excellent!! I had the salmon and my hubby had the red snapper, both of us loved our food! The appetizer of mofongo with shrimp was Awesome! Definitely check it out if you are in the area.",1,,
19,Karina M.,"New York, NY",198,18,9,1.0,11/21/2016,"I have been looking forward to leaving this review after my terrible experience this past Saturday evening 11/19. I was excited to celebrate my birthday at Vacca and placed a call at 1:05 pm to verify the cost of entrance and dress code. I was told that ladies are free all night and men had to pay $20 after 12:00 am. I said great this is perfect. I asked about the dress code and was told no hats,boots, sneakers etc. I thought to myself awesome, it's going to be a stress free evening. We arrived at approximately before 11 pm (with plenty of time before the guys had to pay). After they took all of our coats, which was already $5 each, they were stalling and had us standing in the front area for a few minutes. I could see through to the restaurant, which still had people sitting in there tables finishing dinner. So I'm thinking okay guess it hasn't turned into a lounge yet shouldn't be any issue with getting in. Then I'm told by the woman that it's $10 for girls and $20 for guys. So first off it's still early, dead, and that's not what I was told when I called earlier that day. I told this to the woman and she did not seem to care whatsoever, reiterating the fact that we all still have to pay. I even mentioned the fact that it was my birthday and she said that everyone has to pay. I find it funny one of our male friend's entered Vacca after us (alone) around 12 am said he walked right in and didn't have to pay. It's frustrating to be misinformed and it was clear that they saw an opportunity to take advantage of a large group (mentioning that we all had to pay after they took all of our coats).We ended up going to Cliff around the corner which was ladies free until 12:30 am and they actually HONORED this. Their coat check was only $3 and they had much better music and a nice ambiance. I suggest you not waste your time with Vacca if you're looking to enjoy yourselves with a good time and a business that is actually respectable and honors their word. I will say that the bouncers were respectful and more understanding, but the woman in the front who barely spoke English shouldn't be in the front. She was not understanding and was just plain rude.FYI - I attached a posting from their Instagram page...and I quote ""Join Us Every Saturday @VaccaNYC The Most Elegant Party LADIES FREE ALL NIGHT"" This is clearly false advertisement.",7,,
20,Rey M.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",9,9,1,1.0,11/20/2016,"Horrible Experience!  The manager has no sense of customer service and she should be fired. We came here on a saturday night for my sister's birthday.. (she called in advance and was told by the manger that there wasn't a cover charge before 12pm). We were a group of 15 and arrived at 10:30 pm and immediatly the manager requested $20 per person. The manager than began to argue and we decided to leave. Oddly enough I had a friend who arrived at 11:30 pm that night and he was not charged a cover.This pretty much shows that the manager was trying to simply extort money from a large group. Word of advice.. If you are with a group, go in separately and you should be fine. The bouncers were understandable, however, the manager was extremely rude (then again, she doesn't have a college education and barely speaks english... so I can't blame her for her lack of customer service skills).",4,3,
21,Genesis T.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",3,8,3,4.0,3/5/2017,"I've came here for brunch twice. The first time was amazing due to the ambiance. It was summer time. The DJ played great music, the food was just ok, nothing out this world and the drinks were good.The second time here, it was more laid back. I'm guessing it was cause of the weather. The one in charge of the reservations was friendly and called to confirm a day before.  I didn't like the fact that they sat us next to the entrance on the coldest day and the place was empty. Our waiter was very friendly but he kept disappearing (sitting down and smoking hookah). I guess he took advantage of the slow day. The drinks was amazing on this day though! These are one of those places that you won't know if it will a good time or not.",,,
22,Corey F.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,1,1.0,1/16/2018,"I won't be returning back to this place. Celebrated my birthday here on 114 for sunday brunch /day party. Arrived a little late due to there being no parking in the area. The manager was accommodating in that regard. After that everything went down hill. I had a party of 11. I had to constantly ask for more glasses for my guest and was constantly ask who is this glass for? The food came very late and not the way we ordered it. 1 person in my party did not receive her food AT ALL. Another person in my Party got his food as they were clearing the table and was rushed to eat. After the bill was paid (cash only) and we proceeded to order bottles for the day party that started after brunch, the manager pulled me aside and insinuated that we did not pay the brunch bill and begged me to ask my friends if they had the money. How unprofessional. After that whole ordeal she then returned to say she checked the cameras and saw that one of the waiters had picked up the money and apologized. We decided to stay for the day party which was okay. But I will never return to this place. Save your money.",1,,
23,Sarah K.,"Kew Gardens, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/18/2017,"Highly disappointed at all the employees who work at Vacca. Rude, disrespectful and a bunch of liars. The lady in the front Elizabeth has a disgusting attitude. I don't understand how you poorly mistreat paying customers. They promote false advertisement. I booked a whole birthday package and they couldn't comply with anything. If you want to celebrate your birthday DO NOT EVER COME HERE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! ITS NOT WORTH IT.",3,,
24,Kaiser P.,"Floral Park, NY",4,3,1,1.0,11/11/2017,"Everytime I come to this place they have the audacity to take my order or take my card to keep a tab open but once I want to close the tab or close my order they tell me their card system is down. We are in 2017. That doesn't happen anymore.. you reset your card system and in few minutes is up again. To add to the problem they have an atm on site to take cash out. The terminal fee is $5 dollars. If you frequently have this problem help your clients out by having an atm that charges less to take money out.. at this point is all about principle and not the amount of money. You are forcing clients to pay cash and then you are forcing clients to take money out that atm to pay you in cash. Customer come to enjoy a good night out, not to be hassled with minuscule things like this.",3,,
25,Kayla G.,"Queens, New York, NY",146,3,0,1.0,3/26/2018,"if i could give this place zero stars i would. I was here on Saturday march 24th 2018 and i have never been disrespected like this in my life along with my boyfriend my family and friends. The bouncer was very nasty and disrespectful!!!! didn't want to let my cousin come in after he accidentally forgot his id when he was clearly over 21 but was QUICK to take 100$ just so he can come in , from the lady wth the glasses who check your body and the managers ALBERTO, all disrespectful and RACIST!! i came here for my birthday had a package and everything and they still treated us bad i will never come here again and i would never recommend this place to anyone i care about.

26,Jes D.,"Bronx, New York, NY",1,3,0,1.0,1/14/2018,"This place is horrible!! Save your money!! Hookah was trashhh. This place a scam!! Two bottle girls gave me different prices from one another. I even showed one of them the price they had on their website and she said i was wrong the ""3 bottle  include the champagne"" then the other one said i was right is 3 bottle + champagne. What a hot mess. Oh lets not forget is cash only! Oh let not forget they will milk every penny, is small and uncomfortable. Security breathing on my neck. Before you go in too they will pat you down like crazy. Made reservations to sit came in standing up. Even with other table empty talking about is for other reservations, like okay thats cool but is like 2-3am and is still empty...? I understand if u had to make a deposit to reserve for the night but you...dont!!! Everyone working there gives you an attitude like what type of misery was this. No funny thank you vacca lounge for RUINING my birthday you are definitely in my opinion top 5 worse place i have been to!",,,
27,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,3.0,8/31/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night.Ambience: Place is narrow but long.  There are various tables in the center where people order bottles and hookahs.  The bartenders are attractive muscular guys in tank-tops, not bad at all.  The crowd was mostly Dominican. There is not a lot of room to dance and people tend to stick mostly to their clicks (something I notice happens in the heights a lot). But overall good vibe, especially when compared to other lounges in the area.Music: Quite good, a good mix of Latin, top 40 and old school.Overall it was a cool place and I would not object to coming again if in the area.",1,,

Birthday dinner: I had my birthday dinner here in September. The reservation for 6 was easy. It was around 9pm on a Saturday, it was mainly empty, the music being played sucked, there was nothing exciting about my churrasco. What was good? The drinks. The company I was with.

36,Michelle S.,"Teaneck, NJ",108,12,19,1.0,11/11/2016,"We came here for my friend's birthday and we get there almost at 12am today and it was empty. The djs had not arrived yet, but girls are free before 2am and guys are $30. We stayed about half hr and it was still kind of empty. Our group then decided to leave and as we go to get our coats from coat check we had to exit and WALK AROUND to the entrance to go back inside for our coats. We also did not get our money bWe give the guy our tickets and he gave us 3 out of 5 coats and give me a big large mens northface. I told him this clearly isnt mind and blames me saying thats the ticket I gave him.I then had to go to the back to get my own jacket because according to him we were making a big deal out of it. I find my coat with the MATCHING ticket! I told him to read the ticket and he still blaming me saying i had the wrong ticket. This was definitely my first and last time we will come to this place.

37,M P.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",1,9,1,1.0,6/5/2017,"Oo boy I got time today so here we go. I've been to this 3 times. The first two times I was rejected at the door due to over capacity which is understandable however what I don't understand is why we're other Big groups of people we're being let in when I was just with one other girl? We both attractive ladies and we got there at 1245 also waited on the line forever so I really didn't understand what was going on for both occasions. It's was pretty frustrating since I'm not from the area (I'm from LIC) and Your basically forced to valet your car because there's never parking! So I've been calling a couple of places in the uptown area to find out about there birthday specials for my 25th bday and vacca had a 100 dollar bottle before 1pm promotion which beat most of the prices at other places on a Sunday in uptown. My friends and I arrived early since the previous experience I had weren't so great. When I called I was told the club is open early due to brunch so we arrived around 1115pm and we valet our car in front of the club. When we approach the door entrance we're told the club doesn't open till 12am but my problem is why didn't the valet driver tell us that before taking our car? Now we stuck doing nothing till 12am! We found a local bar around the corner as we waited. We got back to Vacca around 1210am and we were the first and only people there and we were still waiting outside ! Not letting anybody in!  Finally we got in like 1230am guys cover was 20 girls free which is good for a group of 6 ( 2 guys 4 girls). I was approached by waitress Ana who seem to be new because she did not know bottle prices for nothing. She told us the 100 dollar promotion is one per party even if the guys pay separate ( when I called I was never told that ) She said it takes 3 bottles or more in order to have a seating table which is crazy because we got there early in order to have a good spot inside ! She didn't seem confident in what she was saying so she sent another blonde hair waitress named Layla who was Very rude for nooo reason! Her attitude was absolutely disgusting and uncalled for. It was my 25th bday and the last thing I needed was for my waitress to disrespect me and my people! I don't know if she was employed by the club or by the promoters either way she has to GO or get a serious reality check because she working in a CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY, I didn't MAKE her pick her job as a server, she agreed to that job so she should be acting like she wants to keep it. I definitely know about GOOD customer service because I use to work the same job during my college days. So this lady Layla tells us a different story about bottle prices taking about it's a 4 bottle minimum to sit down but Ana just said it was 3 bottles, so obviously these employees are all train differently. I got frustrated at this point and just purchased the bday package which comes with 4 bottles and guess what? Layla still put our bottles on a standing table in the middle of the empty club remember there's still no people yet ! When I asked her why can't we seat down we bought 4 bottles she said we got the bday package which means the bottles are not all full priced so I can't sit, the only way I could sit is if I buy 4 full prices bottles mind you it's still before 1pm! She never mentioned that when we decided to get the bday package but at this point I wasn't going to let that ruin my bday or my night. My feet were killing me about one hour into the celebration because I wasn't allowed to sit even though the club is still half empty with seats! I noticed other party of 5-8 walks in and they just order 2 bottles and they were given a seated VIP area which made No sense ! They came after 1pm and only bought 2 bottles. So I questioned Ana on why is that and does she really think that this treatment was fair to me on my birthday. She told me ""I'm sorry you should have called before coming in""  I told her I did call twice ! So she said she's going to speak with her manager and Boom we got moved to Super VIP at the top top! Which was sooooo lit ! We had so much fun just us having our own area, Ana even came back a couple of times to check up on our party. She was definitely helpful later on. So now the music... the music is good however it's uptown which is mostly Hispanic people so you would think you will hear more bachata merengue salsa but I heard none of that ! Lol if I would have known that I would have just stayed in my area in queens. The only time they played bachata was when the night was over and the lights were on I guess the DJ was trying to die out the mood. Waiting for valet was torture ... they took our car faster than they gave it to us smh. We waited like 10mins because the driver bought the wrong car !!!!! Smh omg I don't think could go back to this place ever! I literally gave them 3 chances lol smh such a shame !",1,,

39,Christopher V.,"New York, NY",134,103,43,4.0,6/3/2014,"I was invited to come to Vacca Grill and Lounge for dinner and I was a little skeptical, especially after reading a lot of the negative reviews.Personally, I enjoyed my time there.  We had a reservation for 7:30PM but we called to have it moved up an hour which was not an issue for them, thankfully.  Some places can give you a hard time.  The hostess was very nice, the ambiance was great, the decor looked amazing.  The music was a little loud but not too loud that it bothered me, not to mention, it was great music.We came right as Brunch was ending.  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which tasted FANTASTIC.  I had the Shrimp Scampi mofongo, which tasted great and my date had the Churrasco Steak which tasted amazing.  We had a side of tostones.Basically, everything tasted fantastic and came in a timely manner - maybe a little TOO fast for my liking because I like to sit and talk a little before I eat however, how can you really complain about getting your food TOO fast? You're there because you're hungry right? lolEither way, I would definitely go back and try different meals.  Hopefully when I do go back, each time is just as great as my first visit.",2,2,1
40,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2317,304,983,2.0,5/21/2014,"Went once for brunch and I didn't really like it. The mimosas were plain OJ, you can tell by the taste they barely had champagne. The food left much to be desired. I had the calamari, which I didn't enjoy. Some other girl on my table had it and said it was ok but I've had way better in other places. I also had the mini sliders which were very disappointing, small, overcooked meat, and the plate was sloppy. It's safe to say the only part of my meal I liked was the yucca fries, despite having to wait over 15 minutes for someone to get me ketchup. One thing to note is that the portions here are huge, I just wish the food had actual good flavor and the presentation was better. After a certain time, they stop serving mimosas. My friends and I finished eating and the waiter wouldn't serve us another glass. The service is VERY slow as well. I particularly got invited to go again this upcoming Sunday and had to decline. There's far better places in Uptown, NYC for you to spend your money.",2,1,1
41,Jennifer F.,"Manhattan, NY",238,718,1201,1.0,10/28/2013,"I recommended this place to a good friend for her birthday dinner because I heard that it had a gorgeous interior & delicious food.  We arrived on a Tuesday night at 6pm & were promptly seated & taken care of.  The number of staff was very impressive for a weeknight & our waitress, Genesis was amazing.  She was extremely attentive & friendly, went over every menu item in detail, kept great track of our numerous drink orders & even substituted some items for things that weren't on the menu.  The drinks were fantastic but the food menu was short in options and was a bit overpriced for the taste, quality and portion.  Other restaurants in the area serve great food and are more inexpensive.I returned for my birthday party the following weekend & was very disappointed.  Despite sitting with the manager, Vanessa to discuss my party in advance, speaking to her on the phone a few times, emailing back and forth, and putting down a 50% deposit for my tables, my reservation information was ""nonexistent"" when I arrived that night.  The manager was not there that night, of course and the hostesses seemed very out of the loop.  My 90+ guests were told that my name was not on the list and I ended up paying more for my tables and bottle service than what the invoice that I had signed originally stated. I paid for 2 birthday cakes that were never brought out.  What's a birthday celebration without a cake?  The music was good but it was extremely crowded, as if no one was head-counting at the door.  Worst part: I emailed the manager my concerns and she never got back to me.  No email apology, no call, nothing.  I will not be returning to this place.",26,2,1
42,Jose J.,"Bronx, NY",77,44,27,4.0,6/15/2015,"I was here last Friday, after being brought here without knowing. I have to admit that I'm not a night club fan, I called it night club because I went there at 1 AM when the place turns into one. My friends ordered a bottle of Johnny Walker Black for $175 + 18% tips included makes it to $200 and something. It was fine considering that we were going to split the check by 3, but why my friends has to get stupid and order a bottle of champagne (Moët Rose) for $200 dollars, yes $200 dollars. We went from paying $67 each to fucking $170 each because of my friends. I liked the atmosphere, the music selection of the DJs, the server, but $20 dollars to enter is way too much considering the amount of money that you are going to spend inside. I'm not cheap, I just don't like to spend that amount of money in 3 hours or maybe less. Go here if you want to have a good time, but plan what you are going to do with friends first.",1,8,

They should have a smoking and non smoking section, It's a kid friendly establishment however nothing is done about the second hand smoke. They do serve you enough drinks and sometimes will just put down the pitcher/carafe at table but the mimosas don't get you buzzed. I really wanted to love this place but there""s a lot of areas where they need to improve Also let me point out that brunch finishes at 6pm so if a late comer comes and wants to order at 5 :50pm the waiter should take her order not tell her brunch is over because if his shift is over at 10pm his boss is not going tot ell him his shift is over at 9 : 52 .",4,,1

Updated review","I don't know where to start because I am still beyond disappointed from my Sunday Birthday Brunch!!!! I made a reservation for 20 ppl; the Manger K called me the day before to confirm & etc. Long story short 17 out of the 20 guests showed up & Vacca had the nerve to charge me for the 3 guests that didn't attend. Luckily my friend reviewed the bill because they charged it as ""backroom service""  when I approached the manager K she was beyond RUDE & said she told me about that. I informed her that she didn't because I would have informed my guests to confirm with me because I would be getting charged if they didn't attend. After a back & fourth the manger decided to remove the extra charge & when I went to pay she goes ""It's CASH only"".  The third complaint I have is that Vacca should be able to have running WATER reason being for your customers are able to flush after themselves ( none of the toilets were flushing)  ..... I definitely used to love Vacca & it was my second time celebrating a birthday here however, after Sunday's experience they definitely lost a customer. Ohhhh I almost forgot to add that the mimosas were def watered DOWN. The only positive things about Vacca is that the food is eatable & the music is always on Point.... For a spot that charges a mandatory 20% gratuity charge they should have a more professional Manager, running water & take card's!!!!",2,,

52,Diana B.,"New York, NY",3,57,33,4.0,1/18/2015,"I chose this lounge for a birthday event. I had never been here before but it came highly recommended by two of my friends. Earlier in the week, I called them to reserve a table over the phone but was told they only accept payments in-person. Since this location is not convenient to my home or work, it was difficult for me to make it there before the big day. Both of my friends know a few people who work there so I was permitted to hold onto on the table.Upon arriving, they were still serving food. It is nice as a restaurant. The tables were bit tight but I guessed that was just for the restaurant time. I was shown to my reserved table - a lone silver square table at the end of one of the rows. I thought the placement was odd and mentioned it to them. They assured me that when they convert the space to a lounge, they would raise the table and it wouldn't be so akward. After a few minutes, they began the conversion. This means they eliminated all of the clear chairs and raised the tables. Suddenly, something happened...they took my table and placed a super small round silver table. There was nooo way in this world that table was going to accommodate the drink package and the hookah. There was an empty table next to us so I asked if we could switch to that one, the party had not yet arrived (they never showed up) so it wouldn't be an issue. They said they couldn't and the reason they switched the table was due to space issues. I had to insist on getting our original table back. I prepared for this night and I didn't want to have a foul experience especially on someone's birthday. Back came the original table. All was well again.Our server took the bottle order and soon we ordered hookah. Since there were 15 of us, we requested extra cups, hookah pieces, bottles, etc. Although it was busy, he was attentive and fulfilled our requests pretty quickly. We had to remind them to bring the cake and they never announced the name for the birthday wish shout-out. Not the end of the world but slightly annoying. Dancing is out of the question...good luck getting to the restrooms. I recommend it for individuals who are into being seen.",1,,
53,Stephanie A.,"Auburndale, Queens, NY",21,28,16,3.0,12/26/2014,"First impression is everything to me and my first impression of this place was 1 star. ""Valet parking"" was really confusing. I would say a little disorganized. Vallet parking is not worth  15 dollars. I'm extremely upset. My discomfort was pretty noticeable and the staff didn't do anything to make us feel better. Although The decorum is certainly eclectic, I will however list the pros and cons. Pro-waitress was attentive and very professional(Yeimy)- food was good(Playera de Marisco)- the decorum was interesting Con- menu was extremely hard to read- the food was good however a little on the cold side. - valet was off -Lighting was a little uncomfortable (too dim) great for a club but not to read the dark areas of the menu. - it wasn't as cozy as I expected for a restaurant. - the area is a little secluded- inside was a little cold (for my parents). Definitely needs a little tweak. Sorry but it's not worth a far drive. A little disappointed.",1,,

56,Lejewelz V.,"New York, NY",146,1,0,1.0,11/1/2015,As we are all sitting done with our appetizers the waitress comes to pick up the plates and drops a dish with red sauce and it splatters all over me and few guests. She picks up and leaves leaving a few employees to attend us without apologizing. I had to go to the bathroom to wash my shirt and there were no driers. A friend went to complain about the waitress spilling and then disappearing without and apology. She came directly to me rudely to say that accidents happen and that she didn't disappear. I informed her that I didn't say anything yet I was sitting at the table with a wet shirt. She said do you need anything and i said no and she walked away. The customer service is horrible!,2,,

They spilled food on my guest and didn't have the decency to provide an apology. Secondly, once the bill was paid for [over $700] the service plummeted further to the ground. The waitresses demanded our tables to accommodate other clients, shoved our belongings towards us and had the audacity to threaten to get us kicked out if we did not do as she said. In addition, the manager didn't have the professionalism to approach us the clients and see what was going on until we requested to speak to him. Ultimately, we noticed he was as unprofessional as the rest of his low class staff. Save your valuable time and money and DO NOT VISIT this place!

59,Mariel R.,"Bedford Park, Bronx, NY",0,13,7,2.0,9/22/2015,"I came here yesterday (Monday) for Happy hour. I decided I wanted to go somewhere different on a random day. This review has one star for the food, one star for the music. Décor is nice. place is pretty small but not too small.I was having a good time with friends. Until it was time to pay the bill. My date handed over his credit card for the payment and waitress said they didn't take creditonly debit. we knew they didn't want to take credit because its more expensive to swipe Credit verses Debit (we talking difference of a couple cents). We handed over a debit card 5 min passed  and noticed the waitress was by the computer still trying to process the payment. To make the process quicker I headed over to the ATM for some cash and it was out of service, of course. weird because I had just used it to pay for hookah refill. We waited some more chatted a bit, once we look over to see if our receipt was on its way. it wasn't. My date decided to just head out to an ATM out side for cash. when he stepped out the waitress came to apologize about the network and blah blah she was calling the manager . I told her to just forget it he's out getting cash. Once he comes back to pay the bill in cash, waitress has no ""change"" to give him LOL. Ridiculous. Not even that, my date complains to them  and one of the guys at the bar told him ill give you a free hookah refill. really? we have been trying to pay this bill for the past 15 min and you really think we want to sit back down to smoke hookah cuz you didn't give us change back? Date got even more angry and the guy has the nerve to dig in his pocket to give him change. that wasn't the point. The money didn't matter it was the fact that it was so inconvenient because your machines don't work, not even ATM, having to step out for cash and you don't even give the correct Change and jokingly say your going to give us fucking coal for change & then reach into your pocket as if the issue was the money.

62,Damiana G.,"New York, NY",2,3,4,1.0,1/19/2014,"I wish I could post a review with ZERO stars....this place is TERRIBLE!! The service was non-existent to say the least. I don't usually do this but honestly it's been the worst experience ever. I arrived for brunch at Vacca at 4pm told the host I needed a table for 6 and she gave us a table for 4. Upon sitting down the waiter didn't come to greet us until 20 mins later and didn't even offer us water. We ordered our food by 4:30 and we didn't get our food until 6:30. The fruit salad took 20 mins after the appetizers came out then we had to call the busboy to clear the table. Then it took another hour or so to get the main course and they all came out wrong. We had no utensils. Apparently, the mimosas were unlimited until 5 and no where was it posted or were we notified. With that said we only received 2 pitchers for 6 people in 5 hours. And to top it off the manager approaches us after we filled out the survey and consistently complained and blamed it on the waiter. As far as I'm concerned he doesn't work in the kitchen so to blame his own staff he might as well blamed himself. He offered us a round and it never arrived when I asked him 2 hours later he send he hasn't sent it yet. My point to my bad experience at VACCA, no matter how much money u invest in making the establishment upscale, if u don't invest in ur human capital u have nothing. ALWAYS REMEMBER DINING IS AN EXPERIENCE. Be aware where u spend ur hard earned money.",18,1,2
63,Alex V.,"Hartsdale, NY",29,10,6,1.0,12/21/2013,"Food was overpriced and decent, at best. Service was horrible. We were a party of 20+ people last night and as we waited for the birthday girl to arrive the wait staff couldn't even bring out bread. When I asked  if he could bring anything to eat like bread or something he said: ""we don't serve bread here"". 55 dollars for a fix price menu which was three courses but only had a small selection to choose from. I went on to order the ribs, which were not good and were cold when they arrived. Then, waited about 45 mins for the main course. As the main course i ordered churrasco, which was again cold and had no ""taste"". The menu had an august 3rd date on it. Tells you how much attention to detail they pay. The wait staff seems so confused and the person that took our order just started placing plates in front of people. We had to tell him who got what because he did not know who got medium well or well done steaks or who was eating salmon, or chicken, etc. The last part, dessert, was the only positive experience. It came quick and the chocolate moose was good. However, at that point it was very disappointing. No manager ever came out to see if we were doing ok, or if the orders were going as planned. We went to the club section afterwards where we had preordered 3 bottles for the remaining 10 people that stayed out partying. The music was great as DJ Aneudy was spinning. However, the crowd was very light and it was full of men. I left at 2am and there was no line at the door as the place was getting emptier. Dont think this place will last long. Last thing: coat check girl goes ""you have to check you coat"", which i didnt mind paying 3 dollars for. Then she goes ""i will walk you to your table after you check your coat"". She opened the door and said ""walk down and make a left down the hall to get to your table"".

Food prices are ok, and it's good.After 12am is overcrowded and the service is crazy, it looks like a club to me. My friends and I ordered some Stellas at the bar while we were waiting for a table and the bartender kept the change without even asking, maybe she assumed that she deserved it or who knows!? She was holding hands with her bf I guess when she had any chance and she was taking good care of that guy and his friend.We spend over $700 in less than 3hours in drinks/food, but everything tasted good. Their food portions are decent, and they have a pretty nice selection to choose from since I like seafood. The ceviche tastes great, the appetizer sample platter is amazing with some skewers, chicken, shrimps, etc; the lobster were overcooked for me but had a great sauce, the rosemary potatoes are delish and their fired rice has a great flavor. A friend from Jersey took me to ""Vacca"" and it was a nice experience. 3 stars because of their prices on the drinks, the bartender keeping the change and the craziness by the time.

We called and they said they dont open Mon thru Thursday. ??? Makes no sense but good thing the place next door was available (Cocina Taller- see review) so we weren't left out in the cold. Ive been to Vacca before and I had an okay time. I found it was a bit overpriced and the drinks were not good at all and I remember the waiter making a very rude comment to my friend. I heard its a better time for night time ratchetness but to each his own. They need to seriously update the website.,1,,
73,Kim B.,"West Bronx, NY",0,4,1,5.0,4/5/2015,Absolutely Amazing customer service & brunch. They accomodate & communicate so well ! Definitely will come back again. :),,1,
74,Ruben P.,"Bronx, NY",12,13,0,1.0,3/30/2015,"Rude staff!!!!!!!!!! Why was the bouncer getting aggressive because we asked where the coat check person was.?!..I felt like I was about to get beat up...WTF, Seriously",,,
75,Kel F.,"New York, NY",1,4,6,1.0,12/28/2014,"Sunday Funday Brunch is a NIGHTMARE here. Service is Horrible, can't blame the stuff too much, it's ALL ON MANAGEMENT. A businesses continued growth is based on the customers experience and this is horrific. Our party is all all here and they tried stuffing us 2 per each side of a small table with many of us left STANDING and not attended and the ones sitting still disregarded. This is not passable in any capacity but to withstand this when the venue is empty is ALARMING, I can only imagine when there's a good crowd.... CHAOS! I, nor the 22 people with us will return and we will make sure to give our opinion when asked.",1,,
76,Josephine F.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",35,59,17,2.0,6/23/2014,"Came here a few times. Decent music but can be really packed. If you are into dancing, expect to stand around. There's no space to dance and guys are utterly self absorbed wanting to touch you and talk to you like you are a piece of meat. No bueno!",3,2,1
77,Jennifer P.,"Manhattan, NY",233,28,20,5.0,1/10/2015,Service was great as well as the Brunch Pre-Fix Menu. You get unlimited Mimosa's or Bellini as well as an appetizer and an Entree option. Great DJ and music!!!,,,
78,G B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/6/2016,"Well well, I never write reviews but this place deserves one. Let's starts by saying that we called this place ahead of time to get an overview on how bottles and tables services work if you went to the restaurant but didn't buy a bottle after when it turned into a lounge. according to the person on the phone if we went for dinner we can stay at the table unless it got reserved or sit by the bar. Now the good part! I went to this place with 3 of my other girls last night (Saturday) and to start off Valet parking was $25 (a bit on the high price, but No problem (until the end) and downtown parking is a lot more expensive which is what I am use to. Our waiter was very out of it and so does seem every one else. we order appetizers (salad) which took 20 minutes to come to our table, so just imagine how much longer the actual food took!!! Wait for it.... Cause it gets better!!! I order Mash with skirt steak (the mash potatoes were extremely cold), my other friend order filet miñon and tostones... She got skirt steak and mash potatoes (also cold) and when she told the waiter they did bring her tostones that were burnt!!! Like black burnt!!! One of the forks never arrived to the table even when we asked twice!!! My friend ate her food after I was done eating 1/4 of mine because it was nasty (she order shrimps and it was decent and the Penne a la Rose that was order was cold and had a hair!!!We were trying to have a good night and didn't bother complaining and paid the $250 bill. So the around 11:40pm the place starts turning into a club, the waiter bring us the bills and also explain we have to get up from the table because if we want to sit we have to buy a bottle. Okay no problem! I ask for bottle prices for vodkas and they said it ranges from $230+tax to $290+ tax!!! I said really??? I recall the most expending for a bottle of Ciroc was $180 with tax in many other places I've been to. We decide we get up and go and sit by the bar, no problem until they come and tell everyone by the bar to please get up and removed all the chairs by the bar! Wait didn't they say we can sit by the bar????My friend order hooka which was $30. I can't speak on whether it was expensive or not because I don't do hooka therefor it's not my area of expertise. But I had gone with them other places and I see it ranges about $20. So I guess not bad.The decor is nice, the ambience seems decent and targeted for a much other group around the 40s, we are all 25! We decide to stay for the night and just give the club a try. Good music (but that's only because I am accustomed to old school Spanish because of my parents) but my friends weren't really all happy with the music, hence the older crow!The drinks were very good and I have to give props to the 2 bartenders that went above and beyond to make a drink we like and it was consistent. They were also inexpensive at range of $12 and up in my opinion. Now to best end of the night!! Getting my car back!!!! So we step out of the club around 1:30pm cause we just had enough of this place and we are looking outside for Valet which is no where to be seen. There is another gentlemen there waiting for his car as well (or so I thought) until he tells me he is waiting for Valet for the past 20 minutes or so and still has not show up.  Now we both have tickets on our hand to pick up our car and no one is around. I wait 10 minutes and then approach the bouncer at Vacca lounge just to see if be can call or give me some insights. He claims they don't manage valet and the people next door do. I request a manager and he refuses to call one. Then I go to the other place and they claim the same and said they don't manage valet yet the manager had the decency to speak to us and even try to help us even when we were not eating at his place!!! 30 minutes later for me, 1 hour for the poor other guy and valet guy appears with a sorry excuse that he was working on the other side (the other nightclubs) and he doesn't know where the guy that supposed to be there is. If you are working on the other side how come you are here now??? But I guess thanks for coming so I can get my damn car in another 10 minutes!!! So that was a total of 40 minutes for me and the poor other guy got his car after me so I guess 1 hour and 20 minutes for him!!!Seriously this valet parking was not free and you had to wait almost an hour just to get your damn car and go home!!!!! And no one else is even there waiting for more cars, so imagine if you leave when the club closes you probably will be there for 2 hours waiting for the car!!!All in all no I don't recommend and I would not be going again!!!",,,

81,Juan R.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,21,2,1.0,9/13/2015,"I celebrated my birthday here. I did the birthday package. I paid 800 dollars for 5 bottles, cake, hookah and balloons. The cake came out it was taken back and I never got to eat it. Bottle service was just way too expensive. They only gave me 4 bottles of juice. When I order 3 more bottles of juice I was charge 45 dollars. Two hours later the waitress comes to me and ask me if i can give my second table to other people because they were going to buy two bottles. This place was a mess. The only good thing was the music but I still would NOT recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are going to celebrate your birthday here.",1,,
82,Teresa G.,"Manhattan, NY",5,72,33,5.0,6/15/2014,I came for brunch love it! I don't know how people can find this place but I did and it looks so cool! Very good presentation! The bathroom is very clean and gorgeous! Very modern! Going to have fun now with my mimosas!!,,,
83,Vanessa M.,"Woodhaven, Queens, NY",139,14,6,1.0,5/26/2015,"Went here with my boyfriend after winning a voucher for a dinner for two in January 2015. We arrived around 830pm on a Friday night and the place was empty. I was a little happy to see this because it allows the waiter to be more hospitable (especially since the Dyckman area has blown up in the recent year). We were seated and I presented the voucher to our waiter, of course his mood completely changed and informed us that we could only pick from their ""happy hour"" pre fixed menu which happens to be a ""$40 dinner for two"" he took every menu away except for that one menu to assure we wouldn't order anything else. We tried their Sangria and it was pretty good, as well as their calamari (which we ordered even though the waiter warned us we would have to pay extra for) now this is where things took an interesting turn... Our waiter leaves for about 25 mins to finally take our main entree order. After our dinner arrives (35 mins later by someone other than our waiter) we kept looking for him so we can order another round of sangria. It wasn't until ten minutes before leaving that we realized he'd been chatting up with the bartender for the entire time. The food was ok, service was horrible I've heard decent things from their club but go to dinner at your own risk.",,,
84,Nana H.,"Bronx, NY",5,25,1,4.0,1/3/2014,"I was here for NYE , obviously it was packed however they did a great job at accommodating everyone. Our server who I believe his name was Franklin was AMAZING!!! Overall the music and ambiance was great. The setting and location makes it a private but fun place to dine at and relax with family and friends.",,,
85,Rogue S.,"New York, NY",1,7,2,5.0,3/29/2014,I don't know why this place has gotten bad reviews. I loved it and staff was more than welcoming....,,,
86,Doris L.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0,2.0,7/6/2015,"I would never recommend this place to any of my friends!!!! I celebrated my birthday back in May, and it was a disasters.I had a prefixed menu, to which included appetizer, a  main plate and dessert, drinks and hooka.No of my guess where asked what they wanted to eat , the waiter just came out with different appetizers, which was not enough ( even though I have paid in advance for my guest, I think that was my mistake ) Them when the main food order started THEY DIDNT EVEN TOOK MY ORDER!!!!!when the waiter notice he didn't asked me what I wanted he just got me a "" churrasco with fried""Which FRIED was not part of my prefix nor their main menu.In addition, I had also paid for hooka for my guess but for some reason my guest where charge and once I told they about it they made a big deal to returned their money .I really loved this place when I went for a January Sunday brunch, that's why I decided to celebrate my bday there but it was a disasters from the beginning.I wrote a letter of complaints to the manager Alberto  and owner Hector and to this day they have not reply to my email.Such a nice place but with very bad management!",,,
87,Eryka B.,"New York, NY",165,13,190,1.0,12/22/2013,I was planing a surprise party for my friend. Went in and spoke with Vanessa the manager I ordered 3 birthday packages. Told her we would be a party of 21. Payed more than 50% of bill  prior to party. The guest had to wait on line to get in. It was freezing out. Birthday girl was on line for more than 20 min. Till I got a manager to go out and get her. They book to many people for parties in the VIP we where supper squished. At the end of the night I was charged for 4 birthday packages because Vanessa made the mistake of putting four packages onto the reservation I was only given 8 out of 12 bottles when I went to complain they stayed that all bottles where brought out. They are robbing people. This place is horrible. I do not recommend it to any one. BEWARE... They charge you for stuff you don't even get. They know they did not bring out the bottles and I asked to see a receipt of the bottles that where brought out they don't have any proof. They have no idea of how to run a business they prefer to rob there customers then try to keep them happy so they will go back. They will never see a dime from me and I will make sure to let everyone know that they like to over charge there customers. Horrible!!!!,9,1,1
88,Joel V.,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,0,1.0,12/28/2014,Worst service ever!! We made a brunch reservation for a large party weeks beforehand for a birthday celebration and when we arrived to Vacca lounge the very rude manager told us that our entire party could not be seated because there was not any space. I'm actually writing this review while we are still waiting to be seated. Our reservation was for 2pm. It's 4. Will never come back here. These people do not know how to treat customers. I would give this place a 0 if I could on yelp.,,,
89,Xal I.,"New York, NY",0,10,4,1.0,6/30/2015,"horrible!!! i go for my bday dinner there and they literally sat us in the middle of a crowded dance floor for a full blown dinner experience... who does that??! of course we did not stay. never again would i come here, this should of been explained to me when i called to inquire about this place. hostess also needs to be more friendly, not sure if she was a hater because all my girls are bad but she has a huge stick up her behind! customer service is key! smh.",,,
90,Giselle V.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/17/2015,"I really wanted to like this place, but the employees and the manager made that completely impossible! Went here on a sunday night with a large group of friends. Place wasn't too crowded so we got a table fairly quickly. A bottle server puts a bottle on our table which we clearly didn't order, we inform him and he apologizes and takes the bottle to the table next to us who had actually ordered it. One hour later he tries to charge us for the bottle. Our waitress informs him that we only ordered two bottles with her and that he was clearly mistaken. He then begins threatening the men in our group and even the bottle waitress. Even security stepped in to let us know that this often happens and he was trying to steal the waitress's commission. Management stepped in and didn't resolve anything! This ended our night very early, long story short they charged my card, my friends card and we paid cash! I will be reporting this establishment to the Better Business Bureau and warning everyone to steer clear!",,,
91,Nancy V.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/14/2014,"I decide to have my last minute bday dinner here for the extended happy hour specials as many of my friends would be working until a later time.  I must say I regret this choice; though the food was good the service was horrible. We would order drinks which the girl had confused only to confuse the bartender who would take a tremendously long time for a couple of drinks which did not have much alcohol in them yay for happy hour prices! Drinks weren't the only thing that the poor girl took down incorrectly, evidently they have 2 diff churrasco/ grilled skirt steak that as a waitress should be clarified as to which the customer is ordering. My friend ordered the one on the appetizers along with another appetizer pointed to both and the waitress managed to believe she wanted the entree which I must say is not up to part in size, I've had it at numerous places and that is the smallest I've seen. Being that it was our first time there we did not know the difference, upon receiving the check we established the mistake we addressed it only to be told you the customer should know the difference and that they go by what we order and that she should have been more specific. Appetizer (churrasco) entree in English yea great specific... The manager just kept saying there was no diff between the 2 because they are the same name, well then how am I wrong by saying your employee should ask, I'm not. He finally walks away muttering ""charge what she ate"". SO DID NOT PAY THAT. Not only because of taking an hour for out food 30 min for our drinks and our hookahs but for being rude, even when asking to separate the check. It's a party of 12, 475 dollars and you want to treat us like we are nothing. That's not how you get your customers to stay, if you do not like your job do not take it out on the customer they are not at fault.",1,,
