A huge thank you to the staff and or patron that found my girlfriend's necklace and turned it in. The sentimental value of that was far beyond its worth. It's refreshing to know there are still honest folks in the world!We'll be back again soon!",2,,
1,Mary T.,"Knoxville, TN",1144,477,6890,3.0,10/6/2018,"This was an interesting bar to wander down into.  It's a total dive bar, that has a smell that reminds me of one those college bars that endured years of cigarette smoke, and drunk patrons spilling their cheap beer all over the floor.  The booths take me back to the 70s, then the tiki lantern lights makes it feel a little like your at a tiki hut beach bar.We ordered the Beach Bucket for 2, even though there were 3 of us, and we chugged that down.  For $30, I thought it would have been a bit more enjoyable, but instead it was just a crappy drink that literally took me back to college where we found ourselves having a chugging competition to finish that beach bucket.Service was great, loved our server, and the menu they hand out, is really quite original.  It has artwork describing their drinks where it looks more like a travel brochure than it does a bar menu, which I thought was a nice touch.  They seem to have good happy hours prices but I wasn't there for happy hour unfortunately.Would I come back?  Absolutely as dive bars hold a special place in my heart, but this one definitely isn't my favorite dive bar in the city.  It's just a conveniently placed dive bar, right place at the right time.Cheers & Enjoy!",2,1,3

It was Sunday night, so that was a hard sell. Holiday Cocktail Lounge was our second try, and rather than move on to our third, we stopped in for a drink. We were glad we did.While I completely forget our awesome bar staff, they were great. It all started when our girls asked them to change the music. Yeah, sure, bar staff LOVE that. But they obliged, and even brought an inflatable microphone for her to sign into. Her song choice? Careless Whispers by George Michael.Now hidden secret: I crush at this song at karaoke. While my friend is a professional singer, I have some tricks up my sleeve, and I grabbed this inflatable microphone when the bridge hit and stepped on top of my bar stool and belted out the lyrics to the other 4 patrons in the bar. It was pretty epic, somuchso that the bartender hooked me up with a free beer!Is this bar the best bar in the world? Absolutely not. Did we have the time of our lives anyway and enjoy the bartender's company. Why yes, yes we did. I doubt another night at Holiday will ever compare, but I'll be back next time I'm in NYC to try.",5,2,4

4,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,3.0,1/31/2018,"TLDR: crowded, festive bar; divey feel; decent drinks; blaring music; college feelCame here with a friend on a Saturday night around 1am. Have read about this place in multiple online articles (Thrillist, Timeout, The Infatuation, etc.), so was excited to give it a try. As expected at this time in the EV, it was super crowded. The bar was cutely decorated with Christmas lights and the menu (which I remember to be different from the one posted online) had an endearing comic book-like layout.We managed to wedge ourselves into a space at the bar and ordered a mezcal-based drink and a pina colada-like cocktail. I unfortunately can't remember the names of the drinks, but both were pretty good, with the former having a smokey taste and the latter having a sweet, fruity taste.Given that the bar was pretty crowded, we decided to head to the back to find seats. We attempted to sit at a booth adjacent to the bar, but a group of girls told us they were sitting there (even though they were just using the seats to hold their jackets and standing near the table). We headed further back and found a sticky, vacant hybrid booth / table to sit at. This table was really close to the speakers, which were blaring music, so I had to shout at my friend to have a conversation. In fairness though, the music was pretty good (mix of top 40 and throwbacks).Both the patrons and vibe of the bar were very ""college,"" but people weren't dancing and it was difficult to have conversations over the loud music, so perhaps the main draw of this place is the good cocktails. Would go to say you did, but wouldn't plan on frequenting this place.",2,,
5,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,3.0,4/11/2018,"I stopped here on a complete whim while in the area, looking for places to go for happy hour.Their happy hour prices had $5 wines. None of the wines were anything fantastic to write home about, but it's what I'd expect from a cocktail lounge and the honestly weren't horrible. They were easy to drink crowd pleasers, exactly what you'd expect to find on a happy hour list.The regular menu on the other hand had some great picks. I highly, highly recommend both Plantation rums and was so happy to see them there. The prices were very reasonable too!I tried a bit of the fries and they were decent for bar fries. Again, not the best fries I've ever had but... it's a bar, what do you expect?The bartenders were friendly and helpful enough so honestly I'd come back if I was in the area, if nothing else but for the Plantation rums on the list.",1,1,1
6,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,7/30/2017,"Holiday Cocktail Lounge suffers from a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a nice-looking dive? Is it a cocktail bar without pretensions? You're presented with a drink list of $14 classics and new inventions, but there's a girl pushing in behind you to order tequila shots... what exactly is going on here?Quiet your questions, take a seat at the rainbow-lit bar, and enjoy the off-kilterness of Holiday. The music is '80s throwbacks and pretty loud, the crowd is yuppies, and the walls are dark wood paneling. Feels a bit like a cool '70s rec room. We were in around 10 pm on a Saturday and it was lively but not insufferable.I had a Corpse Reviver #2 ($14) and my friend had a Brooklyn Pilsner ($7). Mine was made within 5 minutes and was a solid and true-to-form rendition of it, though the licorice note from the absinthe was quite strong. It had what appeared to be a real luxardo cherry in it, too! Not quite as good as at other cocktail bars for similar prices, though. They do know their shit here but it's not a luxury cocktail experience.Overall, an enjoyable experience with a good vibe. Don't be fooled by the upselling of the cocktail list-- your favorite cheaper drinks are here as well. But you can trust these guys to make something fancy.",5,3,
7,Tyler C.,"Tampa, FL",0,4,1,5.0,9/24/2018,My fiancé and I hit up the holiday bar mid day on a week day. We loved the ambiance and were blown away by the customer service. The bartender manager Eric welcomed us and whipped us up delicious cocktails after finding out what we liked (as should any great bartender). We had a conversation about difference between good and great bartenders. Eric was so pleasant and wished us a big congrats for our engagement the day before. We asked him his favorite things to hit up close and was spot on with the recommendations. He even suggested we head over right away if we wanted a seat at a happy hour down the block. Then when the check came turned over I realized he had given us our cocktails for Free! He even was hesitant to accept a $20 bill as a thank you. Hey Eric if you are reading this you are the difference between good and great. Learning what your guests tastes are what they have going on in their lives. You made us feel special. You have customers for life. Thank you!Hope we can throw back some tequila next time we are in town. You must go see Eric!,,,

9,Wills K.,"Scarsdale, NY",2,4,0,1.0,3/4/2018,"This is my first Yelp review. I figured I had to write this after my experience there last night. The bartenders have absolutely zero idea how to deliver a hospitable experience. This place clearly makes no money because all the bartenders care about is payment payment payment. Want to take an extra second to consider your $75 drink order? No way! You can't do that at Holiday Cocktail Lounge. Not only are they all about SPEED, they are the rudest bar owners I have ever met. It's very clear that this is a bit of a trend there being that there are tons of other reviews saying the same thing. If I were you, I would avoid this bar forever. I'm going to make it my life mission to stop people from going here. Who do they think they are charging me $30 for a pineapple drink thingy and then yelling at me when I didn't pay within 1 nanosecond of the completion of the drink. The guy who I am really talking about has brown hair and a ponytail. He is pretty chunky too. If you do find yourself at this dump, avoid ordering a drink from him AT ALL COSTS. Let's get him fired!!!!",5,1,
10,Peter A.,"New York, NY",111,120,28,5.0,5/2/2018,This place is the dopest bar in the east village. Do give pineapple a hello (he's a person). Any bar that plays the get up kids in rotation with old school weezer instantly gets my seal of approval. Keep up the greatness.,,,
11,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,4.0,3/26/2018,"Holiday Cocktail Lounge is a cool bar in St. Marks Place. The round bar is different, being able to see everyone at the bar is neat.

My husband knows the Holiday bar from years and years ago as a solid spot to get a drink that's not too fancy or expensive. While our recent experience there shows that it has been taken over by hipsters, complete with fancy drinks and higher prices, it's still got plenty of bar space, comfy seating, decent bathrooms, and lots of atmosphere. While other yelpers have described it as having a 'college feel' or being too loud, during our recent visit on a Sunday evening, it was not too crowded, and we were able to sit at a table and actually hear ourselves talk while we had our drinks. It's also very conveniently located on St. Marks. We will be back again next time we are in the area.",1,,
14,Nicole G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/4/2018,"Bartenders will steal your money. Went for a friend's birthday party & had 3 drinks during the evening and closed my tab out at around $40. Checked my bank statement that week and they had charged me $96. When I called the bar to get a refund a manager told me that the bartenders must have ""entered the tip wrong"" and she would call me back to process my refund. She has never called me back and it's been almost 3 days since we spoke. Do not go here unless you want to be robbed and then ignored.",3,1,

Located in the heart of St. Marks in NYC with a full selection of vegan bites. Drinks were well crafted and the menu was fun and unique.

It was my adorable friend from Alabama's first Christmas in NYC so she wanted to go to a festive bar but we were treated so badly that we left abruptly. This is my first review I've ever written and I'm a very positive person but I was very disappointed with the service. We were in a good mood coming from a nice dinner and this place was a waste of time and coming from a New Yorker- we value our time.,2,1,

29,Billy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,44,10,5.0,5/23/2018,"My group of three ended up at Holiday Cocktail Lounge randomly on a Saturday night. We were meeting friends for a birthday dinner, but found ourselves in the East Village with a couple of hours to kill beforehand. We put our names on some 45-60 minute wait lists at the trendier cocktail bars and hidden speakeasies in the area, and ended up at Holiday Cocktail Lounge because we wanted to just grab a drink somewhere. We sidled up to the bar and were immediately impressed by the menu, which looks more like a zine or indie comic than a bar menu. The featured cocktails ran the gamut from intriguing to intimidating. We ordered. All our drinks were delicious. One of the trendy speakeasies texted us to let us know they had a table for us. We ignored the text and ordered another round, this time getting more adventurous in our picks. Honestly, if we didn't have to make it that birthday dinner, we probably would have stayed for a third round. The staff is friendly and the vibe is chill. We had the pleasure of returning there this past Sunday for a relaxed round of cocktails. Holiday Cocktail Lounge is easily my new favorite bar in the East Village.",1,,
30,John Paul B.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,1,0,1.0,4/23/2017,"I guess this isn't the only review about the bartender with the man-bun. Good god man, you're in the wrong profession if you don't know how to deal with people. I went here for a birthday party. Not my usual scene, but it seemed nice inside. The drinks were watery and overpriced. Which, hey, you win some and lose some in Manhattan. But when I tried to tab out, this dude with the man-bun couldn't have been ruder. I'm hard of hearing, which isn't usually a problem with bartenders, but when I asked him to repeat himself as to where my card was (I left it at the bar to open my tab, but apparently it had since been given to a waitress?), he got angry. He started yelling and waving his hands so dramatically that the person behind me asked me what was up. Again, my hearing is bad, so I didn't really know what he was saying and at that point I didn't want to ask him again, since being asked questions seems to be a trigger of his, so I left and tracked down a waitress. I didn't have a waitress to begin with, but I guess one of the bartenders had given her my card. Nope. She tells me she doesn't have it either. I tell her the bartender is unusually vehement about not having it so I would prefer not to bug him again. She tracks down another waitress who asks for my ID, and she comes back five minutes later with my card. Dunno where it was the whole time. But anyway, I don't like leaving reviews. I'm pretty lenient when it comes to customer service, having served tables and worked in kitchens myself. People can be assholes. I get it. But I don't get what this guy's problem was. If you're going to sling me drinks that are somehow bitter and watery at the same time, you could at the very least not wave your arms in my face just because I can't hear you.",3,,
31,Lindsay R.,"Eastland, TX",95,4,0,1.0,11/13/2017,"Went last night with my boyfriend. Drinks and atmosphere were average, but service was not. A female bartender (and a man who wasn't working, but went behind the bar and poured himself a drink-so I'm assuming another employee/owner) scoffed, rolled their eyes, and made rude remarks after my boyfriend asked the female bartender the difference between two drinks. She was rude when answering as well. Go for good drinks, but don't expect good service.",1,,
32,John D.,"Bronx, NY",11,91,7,4.0,8/29/2016,"This bar is a cool place to come sort of later in the night, or as a chill spot. It has a nice, dark ambiance with Christmas lights around the bar. Some people may think this is tacky, I think it's cool, gives the place some flavor. It's like an '80's or '90's Americana feel to it. They have small tables situated in front of a horseshoe shaped long couch. with some candles on the tables. They're not sticklers about sitting around the tables (like you need to buy bottles or food to sit there) so that's cool. It's pretty laid back overall, and the manager came up to me and my friend personally to see if we needed anything and almost provided personal service, which at first I was skeptical of (why is this guy being nice to me?), but I think they're just trying to promote the fact that their kitchen is open till 4am and to keep people from walking in, checking the place out and leaving to another spot, with so many other bars in the area. I saw some of the food coming out, it didn't look like amazing food, but I'm sure it's a great place to get fries and chicken tenders at the end of the night type of thing. Bartenders/management seemed pretty amicable overall.Drinks were a little pricey I thought, at around $13 for an ocean breeze, but it was a nicely decorated cocktail with an umbrella in it so I was willing to pay it. I would come here either as the night is winding down, or on the contrary when the night is starting to kick off with a few drinks, or with a girlfriend or something to just chill and vibe.",2,,

34,David C.,"Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY",28,180,3,1.0,6/19/2017,"Totally bizarre experience here last Saturday.I met up with a group of friends at Holiday.  We come to this bar on a fairly regular basis.  Great vibe, good drinks, never an ordeal.  An easy call for a Saturday in East Village (considering the shit show you can run into at other places).After being there for a couple hours, I walked up to the bathroom and there was a woman standing there.  I asked ""Are you waiting for the bathroom?""  And she said ""Yes, but there's no toilet paper in there.  Go ahead.""  I used the bathroom and admired the vintage tile on the walls.  When I walked out, the woman was still waiting there, and I remarked that while there was no toilet paper in the bathroom, the tile was pretty cool.  At this point, a guy walked by and yelled ""YOU'RE OUT OF HERE!!!"" and then walked off.  I thought this was weird but chalked it up to NYC at 1 am.  Then the bouncer approached me and said ""I'm sorry, but you have to leave.""  I asked him why, and the bouncer said that the guy was the manager and he was just like that.  The bouncer was really apologetic, the guy was just doing his job.  So I calmly paid my tab, tipped like a normal human being (the bartender was great, no reason to stiff her), and left with my group.  We ended up at PDT, nabbing a table for six, and eating corn dogs and drinking civilized drinks.You will notice a trend of bad reviews about a specific male bartender.  Not sure if this is the same guy, but there is no reason to patronize a bar where the manager doesn't understand basic respect for customers.",12,2,2

The place virtually empty which was surprising. So we sat a table and order some drinks. The girls got a tiki drink complete with crushed ice, a little umbrella, and miniature plastic shark. I had a $11 Makers Mark and $6 short Long Island Ice Tea. The whiskey was contained in a thin and short tumbler glass with 5 cold draft ice cubes. The Long Island was in a short highball glass. It was a bit too sour and there was no splash of cola and therefore lacked the ice tea color. The place quickly became crowded with a line outside. As we were about the pay the check, a slightly intoxicated blonde lady tried to perform a dance move and crashed into our table spilling out the remainder of our drinks.

The bar has a little bit of a strange vibe for me. LOTS of cocktails, but it IS a cocktail bar, but also sort of divey? It took a little bit to track down our waitress, and it took a little bit for her to get it together, as in, she twice came back with rounds of drinks for us, but forgot me in the mix. But once that bump was over, she was super attentive it was smooth sailing and the drinks kept coming. The drink menu is kind of cute. Set up sort of like a playbill. The list of cocktails is extensive to say the least. The drinks themselves, not exactly my favorite. I tried a couple of different ones. The first one, the drink I waited so long for, the Jungle Bird, it ended up being passed along to a friend. Of the ones I tried, I'd say the Mexican Firing Squad was the best. The staff themselves are really nice. We happen to be there the night a girl managed to lost her engagement ring (I won't comment on the fact about why it wasn't insured). The bartenders apologized profusely to the crowd, but said they were going to have to interrupt everyone's night to turn the lights on and have a bit of a peek around for the missing ring, or, if found, could please be turned in. Normally, I wouldn't mention something like this, but I felt the staff went on of their way to help, when they could have just said, tough we're not interrupting anyone else's night (I heard the ring was found, by the way).  The music selection was my favorite. My friends and I were able to sing along all night to our drunken hearts content. We had a lot of fun and will definitely be back.",3,1,1
40,Craig G.,"Jersey City, NJ",104,345,100,5.0,9/4/2015,"Long live the Holiday Cocktail Lounge. This review is for old and new: while the fixtures stay the same, the trendy haunt along that stretch of Saint Marks is a complete and striking opposite to the legendary dive that occupied the building for decades.Formerly a old-time, 60s era dive bar owned and operated by a perpetually aged and crotchety (though endearing) bartender (RIP Stefan), the Holiday Cocktail Lounge was a spot where you could duck in with a few friends, pull up to the well-weathered bar or collapse on a stained and tattered sofa, knock back a couple (ok, ok...several) domestic macro brews or soul-numbingly strong mixed drinks, snag some popcorn, put some punk rock on the jukebox and cavort with East Villagers until the early hours of the morning.When the owner passed away a few years back, the interior underwent a complete renovation. The bar is still a familiar crescent, but the bartenders are now mixologists. Macro brews are replaced by craft beers and they have a formidable cocktail list. Prices are easily double what they were in the old days, but the quality is unparalleled. These guys know their craft and they practice it well. While I still have fond memories of the old days, this is a new destination bar for my jaunts into the East Village.",9,8,8
41,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1601,1308,3.0,12/28/2015,"Nestled between karaoke lounges and ramen joints, is the unassuming Holiday Cocktail Lounge. The lounge has been open forever, in fact Leo Trotsky is rumored to have hung out here, but closed and reopened recently. The new space is a fairly indescribable mix of dive bar and speakeasy, the kind of place with a dozen types of handmade artisanal gin but Christmas lights as the main decor. Cocktails are excellent and the menu is big, but they'll also make you something great based on your tastes. The fellow patrons here included a couple loudly proclaiming how much they spent on their pedigree Pomeranian-Chihuahua mix who was of course present, and a group of Boston bros hitting on some trashed locals. It might have just been bad luck, but it does seem to attract a strange mixed crowd.",1,2,2
42,Miguel A.,"Atlantic City, NJ",0,12,0,4.0,7/15/2017,"This place was an old favorite of mine, back when it was at its dirtiest and grimiest (and, most importantly, homiest). I was really sad to see it close and a bit skeptical to see it reopen (same old story all over New York, it seems, when it comes to places ""reopening""). When I first went at the time of its reopening, I was pretty let down. The crowd, the music, the atmosphere, the expanded drink menu all seemed forced and unnatural, an attempt at being trendy; I thought at the time, ""if they're going to go down this route, they might as well have changed the name and complete renovated it."" I left disappointed and decided I wouldn't end up there my usual 2-3 times a month.I was in the neighborhood again this past weekend and passed by and decided to stop in. It felt like they figured out a better formula, like they shed some of the (small, but noticeable) pretentiousness I saw at the reopening. Drinks were good, the happy hour deal was good (don't remember a happy hour deal when they first reopened), and it felt more like the bar I knew than it did last time I was there. People's negative reviews saying ""it's too divey for a 'cocktail lounge'"" or whatever, are missing the point and the place's history. Don't change too much from what you have there now.Since the reopening, so many of New Yorkers' favorite places (restaurants, delis, bars, clubs) have shut down. Vastly different versions of themselves have replaced them at 2-3-4x the price point, and so many parts of the city seem unrecognizable now. So, in hindsight, a 1-for-1 swap of the new Holiday and old Holiday was an unfair standard. In retrospect, I think they hit the right buttons in how this bar looks and feels now, and there still is an air of familiarity there now, which I can't say for all the other beloved venues I've seen shut down in just the last 2-6 years. It's a worthy vestige of the old New York bar it was a few years ago/beyond, I will definitely go back.",1,,
43,Philip N.,"New York, NY",8,149,26,5.0,6/27/2017,"This is most certainly an underrated cocktail bar in the East Village. It's a tad 'dive bar' inside; while also a fun venue with character.

We'll see how that works out.Like many others, I never patronized this place back when it was a dump, faux-nostalgia of carpetbagging (and bonafide) East Villagers notwithstanding. It's hard to believe that this newfangled, highfalutin cocktail bar used to host derelicts and strumpets, plying the populace with cheap booze.The new Holiday, unlike its near-namesake Doc Holiday's, is a classy affair. Small and intimate, but not cramped, at least not when we were there. I can't see a modern-day Trotsky in here drowning himself in moonshine vodka while he plots his Menshevik revenge, but it looks like a cool spot for a date or a place to chill out with a friend listening to good tunes.We had some good bourbon.

48,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5152,5.0,3/14/2015,"What a fun bar.I haven't lived in New York long enough to know what the old Holiday Lounge was like, but I have a feeling it wasn't this. Whether that's good or bad is up to you. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the current iteration of this St. Marks mainstay.From what I understand, this used to be a pretty seedy dive bar. Those are typically some of my favorite kinds of drinking establishments and it makes me a little sad I wasn't able to experience it firsthand. However, the new Holiday Cocktail Lounge is like a real life Bar Rescue sting operation. It's a shell of its former self, but the name remains intact. What was once a falling down, dilapidated space is now a hip cocktail destination with fun drinks, good vibes, and a killer soundtrack. My friends and I came in for a single drink but stayed for three hours because the music was so good. A true testament to the importance of any business curating the perfect environment for their customers. No glowing jukebox with 20,000 songs that any idiot can ruin the vibe with, just a music savvy owner with great taste in nostalgic, feel good jams. On the drink side of things I had a chance to try the Lost Hollywood that featured Fernet Branca stirred alongside a few other spirits and topped with an orange twist. They also had Sculpin IPA on draft from one of my favorite breweries in California (Ballast Point) and a drink that paid homage to the bar's previous owner. Apparently back in the day when you asked for a mixed drink, the gentleman behind the bar would simply pour you a glass of whatever spirit you asked for alongside a second glass containing the mixer of your choice. As legend would have it, he really didn't give a damn about mixing your drink and left that part to you. This guy seems like a bad ass, and the Holiday Lounge Cocktail is a hat tip to this salty, yet amazing individual.I've heard a little blowback from previous patrons who aren't stoked on the new direction of the bar. I get it - I've had my favorite bars flipped and turned into loud clubs myself and hated it. But since I have zero connection to the Holiday Lounge of yesteryear, I simply get to enjoy a fun new bar with quality drinks and good energy. This is most certainly going to become a regular haunt of mine.",11,8,10

From the outside it looks like a dirty, run down spot on Saint Mark's (and little did I know it was called ""Holiday Cocktail Lounge) BUT, in the last year I had seen it appear on so many ""best of"" lists so, post dinner in the neighborhood last week my friend and I gave it a try. Yes, it's dimly lit, no, it's not fancy, but it's quite the scene. Young professionals and hipsters alike, 80s music jamming. My friend and I snagged a spot at the bar and the bartender handed us a book. Not menu, but BOOK of cocktails and food. We were enamored by it. I got the Tom Collins which was killer and my friend got a beer. The kicker was the bartender gave us free fries due to a ""mistake"" and we couldn't have been happier, not to mention the bartenders couldn't be nicer.

When you hear the name, you think it's going to be a kitschy dive bar with tinsel garland everywhere, but this is surprisingly classy, in the way that velvet can be decadent and not trashy if done well. The place is dark and cozy, with plenty of tables to snuggle up around. I liked the Playbill style cocktail menu, which of course I brought home with me. I also loved the inventive and original cocktails. This isn't a place to stay and get hammered all night, but it's a great choice for a little hideaway escape. It's most assuredly a cocktail bar.

I think my moment of zen/bliss came at midnight last Saturday when they rolled out some sort of massive donut ... I don't know what flavor it was ... the cocktails were flowing ... but I ate it and all my feelings, and friends I felt good. They have one of my FAVORITE beers on tap - Old Speckled Hen .. hard to find in the city. Makes me so happy, I will travel there just to get a pull from the draft.

From the second we walked in, the bartender was screaming at people, wouldn't serve and was ridiculously angry/obnoxious for absolutely no reason - even chasing us out of the bar after we decided to just leave so we could go somewhere we could be respected as customers. He was increasingly mad over the fact that we came from another restaurant/bar down the street and was treating his coworkers (barback, doorman etc) horribly.  If you want to get yelled at for trying to order a drink, hand your friend their tab, trying to get his attention -- don't go here.",8,,2

59,Keith K.,"Portland, OR",0,268,1096,5.0,10/22/2015,"Back in the mid 00s, I lived in the east village and the divey Holiday was one of my go-to drinking establishments.  Back then it was run by an older guy named, Stefan, who not only owned the bar, but the building as well.  He wasn't what you'd call a ""mixologist"" because if the drink you ordered had more than two ingredients, he just wouldn't make it.  He was more of a beer and a shot sort of bartender.  This was perfect for the step down kinda place it was back then (and many years before then as well).  Stefan has since gone to bartender Heaven and the dingy old Holiday has received a major makeover.  Well, maybe ""major"" is an over statement, you see the Holiday is still a few steps below St. Marks and would still have to be considered a dive, or dive-ish, bar.  The biggest change isn't even the fact that they moved the half circle bar from the doorway to the center of the room, that change is easy to miss.  Even the new lounge areas in the front and the rear with comfy tufted benches lining the nicely finished walls isn't that big of change, altho it is nice. The real change is the staff and this is where it might lose a little of its dive cred, sorry Stefan.  During my most recent visit, Dustin from Calgary, was my day bartender (all the best people drink during the day) and he is a true mixologist. He knew his liquours, he knew his drinks, but more importantly, he knew how to make everyone feel like they were all invited to his party, his day party. A good bartender knows drinks, a great bartender knows people, Dustin knew both. Now maybe the new Holiday isn't as curmudgeonly, or cheap, as the old Holiday, but it's still a great place to drink in a city filled with places to drink. I'm guessing it's got more of a hipster crowd by night than it used to, but I wouldn't know, because like I said, I drink during the day.",4,2,2

It used to be a shithole for alcoholics, now it's a nicer shithole for aspiring alchoholics with jobs.The problem is that the cocktails are just not good enough: not good enough for the city, the neighborhood, or the price. Maybe you could get away with these inconsistent, watery drinks 10 or 15 years ago, but if these guys are going to pretend to be a cocktail bar in this neighborhood, in this day and age, they'll need much better chops.The bartender was more interested in chatting up some chick than in making drinks.

What I witnessed firsthand was that it's also an industry bar. Which is always a great sign that they're doing something spectacular with their drinks program. If the city's best bartenders come here to drink and unwind you can expect perfect drinks without pretension. And that's just what I had!I got a cool and refreshing gin cocktail and sat along the wall of the back of the bar to relax and people watch with friends. There's great people watching to be had here and the bar itself is pretty big. The back wall area has benches that line the walls. It'd be easy to invite friends and host a large group of people here. You can also just sidle up to a two top, nab a booth near the door, or get a stool at the bar.The aesthetic here was super cool, too. Kinda tiki with colorful little lights, kinda divey with dark woods and floors, but if they flipped on all the lights it'd still be clean and not scary. It's just meant to look and feel like a place you've been coming to forever. It does have a bit of a holiday/vacation vibe and it's super casual and fun.

Don't expect a buy back from the moody, angst driven, posers from behind the bar. These mopes have no idea how to treat repeat customers let alone fulfill a song request. The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. Continually tipped these jokers out with hopes that they would see the light. They don't have a clue how to run a packed bar. Rule of thumb is always that the best tippers get priority. When man bun toting barkeeps lose sight of the greenback driven free market system, you know somethings wrong with the world.

We came here with a group of people last night for drinks at 4:45 pm. There was a private party going on, so the bouncer told us to wait until 5. We didn't mind waiting 15 mins and stood in front of the bar. At 5, we went over to him and he told us that we would now have to wait until 6. We were a little angry, considering we were essentially standing IN FRONT of him and he could have told us that the time changed, but when I politely said ""hey you told us it would be a 15 minute wait"" he said something to the effect of being recently informed of the time change.  I don't know if I buy that story,  but fair enough. We were angry, but didn't express our anger to him directly. My husband muttered something under his breath to our group, not the bouncer, as we were walking away about how we wasted our time. We still wanted to try holiday cocktail so we came back roughly an hour later. The same bouncer checked our licenses and said to my husband ""next time keep your comments to yourself or I won't let you in."" This is a direct quote. Obviously this bouncer was on some kind of power trip and cares more about his ego than about customer satisfaction. I've worked in customer service before and have been peeved by sassy patrons, but I've always been professional enough to keep my remarks to myself. Clearly this bouncer is not very good at his job and cost the business hundreds of dollars and at least 5 customers. There are a million bars in nyc.

81,Mohammad G.,"Venice, CA",42,15,4,5.0,3/14/2016,"Very fun bar! Interesting music, very hipster but not terrible.  A rather extensive list of speciality cocktails for your choosing.  Very limited beer menu, but that's most of NY.",,,
82,Sasha L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,44,0,3.0,1/29/2016,"The olives they use for drinks taste old and rotten. Gross. I thought I could order a classic cocktail (martini,$13) in a cocktail bar and not have it taste like old socks but guess not. The waitress was super nice though and the bar was fun otherwise. Great music.",,,
83,Mikaila W.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,3,0,2.0,1/9/2016,"Cool dive bar with great music and decent prices. Unfortunately the bartenders ignored me, standing straight in the center of the bar with money in hand. They noticed my friend's hat as soon as he walked up though, which was great.  Don't worry. I'm not even here. Super thirsty. I will take my money elsewhere if that curly haired bartender in the bandana is working... or should I say behind the bar but not working at all  Five stars for the venue. Negative three stars for the service.",,,
84,Betty H.,"New York, NY",274,282,89,4.0,11/9/2015,"Totally unassuming from the outside as it looked old and divey and probably smelly... I don't think I would have ever come in here if my friend hadn't recommended it to me, but once inside, we were pleasantly surprised by the decor and the crowd (hip young people like ourselves) and the menu was pretty great - champagne cocktails that were surprisingly delicate and very well made, and of course, shots. It was reasonably priced, not too loud, and had great, friendly service. Now I tell people to come here all the time to not deal with pretensions elsewhere. One of my new favorite bars!",,,
85,Erica A.,"Manhattan, NY",163,20,5,3.0,11/8/2015,"Went here Friday night to celebrate a friends 35th birthday with a group of 7-8 woman and 3 guys. We got here early around 8:00. It was my friends birthday and we brought a cake. We also brought in our own utensils, plates and knife to cut the cake. When we asked for the bill we noticed a $20 cutting fee price. Nowhere did it state a fee would be added to bill and the server did not mention this to us when we brought out the cake. Not to mention, we cut our own tiny cake. When we mentioned to the server she did take the fee off the bill. When we turned to pay the bill we all noticed her throwing a fit near the POS system. She throw her check presenters down and her Pens and made a scene for no reason. We were super polite and even gave her a $30 tip for. $90 bill. Way more then %20 percent.  I went up to the server (ASHLEY) And explained to her we didn't know about the fee and appreciate her removing it but her behavior was uncalled for and made us feel very uneasy for the rest of the night.The bartenders were attentive but definitely on their cell phones the whole night, but once we got there attention very speedy with serviceHarley was very nice and apologized for the servers behavior but I won't be back. We all have bad days but if you are gonna throw a fit at least don't do it in front of your customers.",,,
86,Sean G.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,4,0,1.0,7/19/2016,This place smelled like a foot. Typical over-priced drinks. Had a question about the tab and the manager was a condescending prick. Wouldn't suggest it.,2,,
87,joseph s.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0,2.0,7/7/2016,dig the spot. nice and divey feeling. the prices however are not. $8 beers in tiny glasses and $14 old fashions. they're definitely pushing it; this isn't death and co,1,,
88,Cassidy Z.,"Corrales, NM",41,174,24,4.0,6/9/2015,"Cool, low-lit atmosphere, gregarious and talented bartenders, $12+ cocktails--what more can you expect from a New York City bar? We had a great time hanging out here, even if it was a bit pricey. The company was enjoyable, the drinks were delicious and the service was perfect. I will def be back.",1,,
89,Nathan L.,"New York, NY",256,282,5,4.0,7/19/2015,What a cool unassuming bar that has good music and a laid back atmosphere.  I don't think I would have came in here with all of the bars on Saint Marks and its lack of curb appeal but am glad that a friend of mine chose this spot for a birthday party.,,1,
90,Irine S.,"Manhattan, NY",102,47,6,5.0,8/10/2015,"Stumbled upon this former stomping ground in the last few weeks (I used to live on the same block) and was pleasantly surprised on an upgrade to an old favorite.  Amazing cocktail selection .... I recommend ""mortally afraid of madams"".  This place feels warm and homey.  The food is delicious and we always have a great time.  Do yourself a favor and have a few drinks. !!!!!!!",,,
91,Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",127,278,28,3.0,3/22/2015,"I'm pretty sure I went to the old Holiday Cocktail Lounge back in the day, and this new iteration is an improvement. Fun and laid back ambiance, fantastic music, friendly service, non-annoying clientele--all good things. I ordered two drinks: the Brooklyn Babe (gin, BK hemispherical bitters, fresh lime, raw honey syrup, Pickett's ginger beer, garnished with fresh mint, $14). This drink was quite refreshing and clean. A perfect summery cocktail. For my next drink, I ordered a Tom Collins, which is my go-to cocktail. I feel like it's one thing for bartenders to be able to make stuff off their own menu, but another to be able to make something classic and not of their own invention. Unfortunately, the Tom Collins was not up to snuff. Something was decidedly off about it, which I couldn't put my finger on. It almost tasted like the ice had picked up food flavors or something. I'm not sure, but whatever it was, it wasn't good. I didn't finish it.Despite this Tom Collins snafu, I would come back because I liked the overall environment and the drink I had off the menu.",1,2,2
92,Michael D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,0,4.0,7/21/2016,WTF?!  She's back open but what the hell happened.  Bummed & happy at the same time.  Kind of like getting a hooker with a hot body but ugly face!,,,
93,Amanda B.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",88,9,0,5.0,7/15/2015,Favorit bar neely discovered. Amazing ambiance. Amazing tunes (david bowie). And drinks were incredible (the watery drink reviewed below must have been a fluke)!!,,,
94,Zach K.,"Manhattan, NY",54,113,0,4.0,5/18/2015,"Delicious, delicious cocktails here. I ordered an old pal and a drink that was sort of like a manhattan -- both were amazing and I would come back again in a heartbeat. Our waitress was nice -- and at the end of our time there (we were moving on sort of early, maybe 9:30 on a Saturday -- the place wasn't packed or anything, but there weren't any open tables) I went to use the bathroom. When I came back my wife was standing by the door -- apparently the moment I got up one of the servers (not our waitress) had brought another couple over to our table and basically kicked my wife out -- couldn't even wait 60 seconds for me to get out of the bathroom? Anyway, were it not for that, I would have given this 5 stars, but that was sort of a sad way to end our time there. BUT. The drinks are great.",,,
95,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",374,758,1,4.0,4/27/2015,"Stiff, stiff drinks, and quite a bit of variety too. My experience from this place is a bit of a blurr, but from what I remember it's much more divey than I anticipated and it's not necessarily something that detracts from the experience. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit and would definitely go back again.",,,
96,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",349,3,21,5.0,5/4/2015,"I had an awesome time at Holiday Cocktail Lounge -- as did my 30-or-so friends who attended my birthday party there. The management was super attentive and made sure everyone's drinks were fresh, and checked in frequently with me to make sure all of my party's needs were met. Beyond that, the music was really fun (totally eccentric and unpredictable, but fun), and the atmosphere was cozy and friendly. Would totally recommend everyone come here, if for a party, or just a great happy hour spot. Great vibe, great re-vamped addition to the neighborhood.",,,
97,Don S.,"Medford, OR",21,34,9,4.0,5/18/2015,What a great place to spend an evening while in the East Village New York City. The bartenders were very enjoyable and the crowd was very fun and welcoming to outsiders from Oregon. Thank you all for making an enjoyable even for myself and my daughter,,,
98,Michael M.,"Jamesport, NY",12,42,10,5.0,5/16/2015,"Went here before seeing my nephew in his play ""Bayside the Musical"" across the street. As soon as you walk in, you are transported into this mid-20th-century swank little spot. Great menu of special cocktails, made by a real pro bartender---I wish I had gotten his name---he was so friendly. A really great spot to hang out and relax. We will definitely recommend it to our friends.",,,
99,Lauren C.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,4.0,3/2/2016,"This place is great!  Great music and really good cocktails (get the Ocean one...can't remember the exact name).  Only drawback is that sometimes the music/atmosphere is a BIT too loud, and it gets crowded.  Nice combo of divey/nice, with not too much of either.",,,
100,Trey G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,2,0,1.0,4/28/2015,"The old Holiday Cocktail lounge is rolling in its grave. This is a horrible excuse for a bar. There's no soul beneath the impeccably spotless veneer and characterless furnishings.  My friends and I each ordered a shot and a beer on a weeknight, which under normal circumstances should be prime drinking time in the East Village.  However, I could never imagine what they actually served for that standard request.  How can you ruin a shot and beer you may ask?  Well what if instead of a full beer with a regular shot of whiskey you received a 4 oz pour of beer with a diluted whiskey shot.   It doesn't matter the beer is ""crafty.""  Go to Blue & Gold where you can get the real thing for cheaper.  If this is the future of Manhattan we're all doomed.",6,1,1
101,Jack M.,"Medford, MA",0,5,0,5.0,3/21/2015,"I frequented the old Holiday dozens of times.  One of my best friends met his wife there... they're still married more than 10 years later.  I'm glad they re-opened it and cleaned it up a bit.  It still has the same feel, but now you don't need to bathe when you leave.  Holiday forever!",2,1,1
102,Jake G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,3/17/2015,"Neff brothers redid a classic and made it better. Bar program is nothing short of amazing and my lack of recalling every exit stands as a treatment of that. Bar food is ok, keeps the body drinking. We came and stayed for the company. Always tip your bartenders.",,,
