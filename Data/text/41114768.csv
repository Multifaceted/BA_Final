Throw in a gut filling brewsky selection and Daddy's home!Tribecca is to the artys film industry what hells kitchen is to the working stiff McDrunks are. I never really noticed Puffys before, kinda looking like an iron worker dive hang from the street. When you enter your initial thoughts will be confirmed that during the late afternoon to happy hour for the most part it is. Nothing special, but this Yelper has learned that all tooooo often there's always more than what meets the eye upon 1st impression.So, I pulled up a seat at the wooden bar furnished the brass foot kick and a few Big screens and corner dart board. Ordered a guiness and a magners with a side of ice as any good Irishmen should. The eardrum blasting 80's rock tore through the airwaves forcing more intimate conversations especially with the iron workers laughing rather loud in the corner of the small watering hole. Immediately the dichotomy of suits to orange fluorescent work garp becomes quite apparent. Leave those pretentious bones at the door to chew on else where. A daily up to 5pm sandwich menu filled with prosciutto and sopressata with toppings like;  balsamic glazed sundried tomatos and fresh mozz, arugula and olive paste along with some olive oil nicely piled between artisian flat sub bread. I was like well this guy is hungry and those sammy's look like they need to get into my belly especilly at around $11 for an ample stack. OMG and when you describe chow with OMG you know you're in for a tantalizing tongue dance. I was blown away.Oh how I wished this place was on the corner next to my house. Honey are you walking the dog again? Hell ya, baby! If you dig a kick ass sandwich washed down with a choice brew, at painfully affordable prices with quality ingredients then this is worth the 1 train stop just off Franklin.",6,5,4
3,Sharon L.,"New York, NY",191,105,162,4.0,8/5/2017,"This hole in the wall bar is definitely a dive bar which has its positives in that it is extremely affordable for the area of town it is located in. There are beers on draft for five dollars and not a bad selection at that. The selling point was finding this gem on a Saturday evening and essentially having the space all to ourselves. The place offers a dart board which apparently is hard to come by in the city especially in Tribeca. I was in a group of five and we played darts to our hearts content. We kept score on the chalkboard on the wall. We were not rushed at all, service was fast and the bartenders were friendly. Although we did not try the food, next time we visit we will be sure to give that menu a go. We are glad that we stumbled upon this place!! Would definitely consider returning for happy hour during the week!",1,,2

I had 3 Boddington's and played a ton of free darts. I also had a $10 Fellini Sandwich.  I think you are supposed to get a choice of bread but no selection was offered. The bread was a bit hard, porous, with a dusting of flour. THe Sopressata was salty and bit spicy.  The half moon shaped mozzarella was soft but dry for being ""fresh.""  The olive oil marinated hot peppers and Arugula added some complexity to the sandwich. It was overall good and filling.  The Solitary Bartender made sure we were all taken care of. Definitely a place to go to drink and be merry.",2,,2

Bartender chick opened up later letting us know they had small pizzas that get delivered frozen from Qns and she was right they were actually pretty good!!

The bartenders are always down for a good chat and i think ive gotten a free pint every time I've sat at the bar! The clientele is a funny mix of regulars, wall streeters grabbing a night cap, young professionals celebrating a coworker, and always always always at least one drunk older gentleman hitting in you. Honestly, its great-- thats how you know its a good dive!!Last night our man Ethan played solid tunes, hung out, and took care of the other 6 or so patrons in the bar.

15,Amanda D.,"Carlstadt, NJ",372,397,813,4.0,10/29/2015,OK so there is no way a dive bar will get 5 stars from me but this place is a solid 4 star establishment. I came in late one night with a coupe of friends. The bartender was on point and didn't delay my drinks; which of course was my purpose for being there. The entire place had a good feel. The customers were friendly and joyous but not loud or obnoxious. There is seating along the bar and some small tables on the edge. There is also a dart board in the back. They do have house darts so go in and have some fun. Music was very good and the lighting was not too dark but thankfully not at all bright either. Very friendly and I hope to make it back again -- sorry I don't have the name of the bartender he was friendly and cute - but taken .. too bad (LOL). They also make sandwiches which I was told are very good. Maybe I need to try this place during the day.,2,2,4

Puffy's was one of our first stops in the middle of the day, maybe around 1pm. Our group of 4 were the only ones in the place. The TVs were showing soccer games (on mute) and a variety of music was playing from 90s to country. When I asked where the restrooms were, the bartender pointed to two, but said the second one was a little more presentable. As a woman in a bar, I SO appreciate that, so THANK YOU!  The bathroom was definitely clean, but my concern is what it might look like if it was Saturday at 1am rather than 1pm.Regardless, it was a casual and divey little place, and I'd return.",,,

Maybe if you live in the neighborhood, this is one of the locals bar. I only saw one other guy there with his son. The bartender was really friendly with him. And actually continued his conversation with him and he wrote down the wifi password for me and he just handed it to me. He did mention I should use all caps and the password didn't even work.

27,Ryan F.,"Manhattan, NY",1604,723,8116,4.0,2/2/2013,"I agree 100% with Brad K. on this one - Puffy's is a nice little dive with great staff, dim lighting, and a solid playlist ranging from RHCP to Rihanna, with some eclectic curveballs thrown in for good measure.Aside from the $3 PBRs, they had Boddingtons and the part pale ale, part wheat beer, part cream ale Sixpoint Sweet Action on tap...nice!  (Fun fact:  did you know Sweet Action beer was named after a porn magazine?  Neither did I, but our bartender did!)  If you're hungry, they serve individual pizzas starting at $6 for plain cheese - additional for toppings.The available side space alongside the long bar counter is peppered with tables, and can get a little cramped with people standing around, so our group of nine made our way to the back area, played some darts, and had plenty of room to rest our coats and spread out.All in all, a great place to hang after a late dinner and cap off our Friday night.",2,,1
28,Sophia V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,10/26/2015,"I wish I could give this establishment 0 stars. It was one of my friend's last weekend (10/24/15) in NYC and after eating in Chinatown, we walked downtown chatting looking for someplace to stop and grab a drink. I work on Harrison street, pass Puffy's every day, and have had multiple customers recommend I stop in-so we did. I wish I could go back in time and change our decision. Upon entering it's nothing special, it was crowded because a work event was being held there-no problem to us because we just stood by the bar. But the real issue, the reason that I made myself this account to review, is the bartender. She was downright nasty for no reason when we were nothing but polite to her. We ordered, and after taking our orders she singled out one person in our group to ID (we were all of age, and ironically they happened to be the oldest-though they were also male so I'm guessing women are rarely carded). When he asked ""why me?"" she rudely responded ""because you look like you're like, 12."" (keep in mind he's 22, and wasn't snarky in his question, just curious.) After we were served another of my friends was putting her change away, and the bartender turned to her and said ""you know, if you want to keep being served you're going to have to tip, that's just a fact."" Now, we were planning to order a few drinks and stay awhile, and would have tipped at the end of our tab. HOWEVER, regardless if we did or did not, you don't treat customers this way. As someone who has worked in the service industry, you must treat customers with respect-and if you come at them nasty and rude, you're not going to be tipped (we didn't tip her. Not after being treated like that.) We drank the drinks we paid for and got the hell out of there. I understand everyone has off days here and there, and had she apologized it would have made a wold of difference. However, she didn't, she was rude when we gave her no reason to be, and it's unfortunate because I work only a few doors down and certainly would have recommended it to people and made it a ""usual"" spot. Alas, I will take my hard earned money elsewhere. *Sidenote-I can't help feeling like she treated us this way because we were obviously the youngest people in there (though we were all of legal age). Either way, there's no excuse for her behavior, and we'll never come here again.",5,3,1

It's a little dark, but it adds to the feel to it. Order a beer or cider from the bar tender and enjoy a chill evening catching up with friends.

The sandwiches are made with the tastiest bread and great fresh ingredients.  The staff are quick, efficient and friendly making it a joy to lunch at Puffy's but you can always grab a sandwich to go too. Another great aspect of Puffy's is their prices.  They are very affordable.

First off, the sandwiches are HUGE. We both got half wrapped up to take home for dinner. I was kind of disappointed that they only had one type of bread at the time, rather than the choice of 3 on the menu (I was eyeing that ciabatta!), but whatever.

It has a full bar which i was tempted to venture into but since it was lunch time, I preferred sticking to beer. It didn't take long for the bar to go from almost empty to bursting with activity. The lunch rush was a torrent, a frothy river of locals looking for a quick drink and a sandwich. Sandwich? Well yes, sandwich would be the technical term but after a first bite, you'll know that it would be better described as a Artisan crafted meaty/cheesy comestible. They have a menu of about twenty different sandwiches. These aren't the sandwiches you'll get at 7-11 or some lousy deli, a stale roll, some bland chicken fluff with the orange cheesy colored layer. I've never had a sandwich with artichokes on it before. Puffy's has them. And for $1 buck I could have had extra artichokes on my sandwich! Extra artichokes was simply too crazy a suggestion for such an early afternoon so i had to pass. The sandwiches, all 20+ styles, are made by a single guy working behind the bar. It was a young guy with a shaved head and a calm demeanor. His hands moved to their own rhythm, producing a sandwich after a few well rehearsed movements, boom, slice, bam. I had the ""Pavarotti"". That's salami, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and artichokes. It was great. Try eating it with a dash of balsamic vinegar on the plate. It seems they have a pre-happy hour from the time they open 11:30 till about 4pm. Drafts are $3 bucks (US), $4 import and $6 well drinks. The sandwiches are all about $7 to $10 bucks.  A bargain.",,,

57,Andrew D.,"Silver Spring, MD",159,307,7,4.0,7/14/2010,"A co-worker invited several of us to Puffy's for lunch a few weeks back. It's always nice to find places like this within walking distance of my building, so it gets points just for that. I'm a sucker for proximity.Puffy's is a small bar on a backward corner in Tribeca, slumped into its place in the neighborhood with a bit of dilapidated charm. The place is, first and foremost, a bar, but they serve great sandwiches. Their sandwich menu is pretty straightforward, with maybe 8 or 10 different selections using about 8 different ingredients in different configurations. They get their bread from a bakery around the corner and you can get any sandwich on any bread. Ask your barmaid or server what is best, they'll steer you in the right direction.The popular favorite was the Gladiatore (I'm pretty sure all the sandwiches have an Italian theme), but they ran out of the kind of bread that our people kept requesting, so only a few of us actually got what we ordered. I got what I wanted, so I can't complain. Some of my fellow diners might knock the rating down a spot for the shoddy service.Other pros: they have TVs for the watching of the sports, but they're mostly higher and out of the way, so if you don't want to pay attention to the latest LeBron coverage, you don't have to. Puffy's beer selection isn't very broad, but the prices are right ($3 or $4, and on Monday you get a beer with your sandwich as the lunch special).Don't swarm the place. I like it there.",4,4,4
58,Brad K.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,96,2,4.0,2/2/2013,Very solid dive with $3 PBR's but also some decent beers if you're so inclined.  The darts set up in the back is good. The bartender was very friendly (and was selling Girl Scout cookies for his daughter).  Will definitely head back next time I find myself in TriBeCa.,,,1
59,Katherine M.,"Queens Village, NY",104,178,4,4.0,2/25/2013,"Good beer and awesome sandwiches. This place is pretty simple and wallet friendly. If you go during lunch, it's a huge sausage fest. And if you show up a hair after noon, you may have a hard time getting a table or a spot at the bar. But, once you bite into one of their various sandwiches or scope out the varieties of beer on tap, you'll understand why you should make an effort to get here earlier. I come with my work buddies every week. Nicole is all kinds of awesome, so try and come during one of her work shifts. The other waitresses are less than friendly, and frankly very off-putting. Besides that, Puffy's is one of our favorite lunch spots in the neighborhood.",,,

I'm all in.As my coworker explained it - it's the closest thing to an American version of an English pub that you'll get in the area - sans the copycat cheesiness. Why's that? Because you've got cheap beer, decent food, and a laid back vibe.Puffy's is a great place to stop by during lunch for a beer (got my Stella!) and an Italian sandwich. Their sandwiches off the Alidoro menu (available 11:30-5pm) are delish. I tried the Sofia - salami, mozzarella, artichoke hearts, and olive spread - on ciabatta bread and it was delicious. I'm not usually a fan of ciabatta bread because of the toughness that tends to be inherent in it, but it was pleasantly soft enough to tear through. My co-workers got the two chicken sandwiches and they looked incredibly yummy - I'll have to order one of them next time.The meat is cut on-site at the corner of the bar - how neat is that? Oh... and you can be sure that I'm going to hit it up next Monday because apparently you'll save that $3 and get the beer FREE with your sandwich. Holla!",7,2,4

Nothin wrong with the bar but it was a bit quiet and decor was uninspired. They had a dart area which was unique. Drinks were fine but the food selection was limited and not very appealing. Wings and pizza. Pizza tasted dry and microwaved. Wings were average at best. This place is more appropriate for a quiet drink with a friend rather than an office happy hour.,,,
71,Jasmine M.,"PECK SLIP, NY",5,11,0,4.0,5/9/2012,"I like Puffy's Tavern, but I really only go there on Mondays because it's nice and quiet. The crowd that goes there is professional for the most part, people of different ages... It's nice. Jeff (Geoff?) usually works Mondays and he's a dear! Charlie is very sweet too! There are a couple of bartenders that seem kind of cold, but it might just be in my head. However, there is one that changes the price of the only drink that I order every time I go and he's there... I'll have to find out what that's all about, but generally, it's cute little pub to have a drink after work/school and maybe watch the game. :-D",,,

73,Debbie W.,"New York, NY",182,497,6,3.0,6/23/2008,"So I got stuck attending a wedding in tribeca on the day of the Spain Italy soccer match in the Euro quarterfinals.  Ugh.  My mission-- to find a good sportsbar nearby, was not working out so well, even with the help of yelp. How happy was I when i looked out the window and saw that the bar across the street had two big screen TVs and that they had the game on!  Well I was worried about the name-- Puffy's-- and thought this was going to be some tacky cheesy bar, but as I hadn't found anything better-- the minute the cake was served, i was out the door and seated at the bar at Puffys.  Couldn't have been happier.  Its a neighborhood bar, with no tackiness, no cheesiness, it was just what I wanted.  I was too stuffed with good food and drink to have anything but a pelligrino (see review of chanterelle) but the drink menu looked creative and good, the bartender was very friendly, and they had a good crowd.I also noticed that instead of a bar menu, they have an italian sandwhich menu full of salads, sandwiches and everytime someone ordered one, i was jealous cuz it all looked good.  Three kinds of bread-- ciabatta, pizza bread and crusty italian versions of bagettes (forgot what they call them), really yummy looking italian meats, fresh mozzarella and all the trimmings and it all looked great.  If im in the neighborhood again, i'll be checking it out and updating.",4,,1
74,Lauren L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,4,0,1.0,4/5/2014,"Good dive bar but thought it was extremely rude after I spent money and time selecting jukebox songs that the bartender told me he was skipping all of them because it ruined the ""vibe"".

75,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,3.0,9/14/2007,"This bar is smaller than I thought, but if you're a late twenty, or 30something local, this is a great joint to hit up. They only have one TV unfortunately, but that means more conversation, and less baloney (Walker's is nearby if you're more into watching a game) I like baloney (well bologna) a lot. I used to eat bologna and cheese sandwiches when I was young at summer day camp and stuff, it was great. To add to it, you put chips in the sandwich, gives it a great crunch. Anybody ever do that?Back to the bar, the tiled floor and crammed bathrooms don't help, but the crowd is very lively and rooted in ""I may look like a corporate dude but I'm actually pretty personable"" kind of way. Not like Greenwich Tavern, which just seems to have a lot of douchebags. This bar is totally the local bar. It just is. There's not much else to do here besides drink some 5 dollar pints.Oh and the outside chalkboard sign said something like, ""We don't like traffic jams"" and an arrow just pointing to the area immediately outside the bar. That's fine I guess.",2,1,2
76,k. s.,"New York, NY",2,40,0,4.0,12/13/2006,"Puffy's is a great all-round bar.  It feels a bit old-school with the decor and the music, and it caters to the local crowd.  (Be forewarned: during happy hour time, the local crowd is largely the financiers getting off the job and can be a bit on the grown-up-frat-side.)  The prices are reasonable, the bartenders are capable and friendly, and the offerings cover all the basics.  They do offer munchies of the toaster-oven variety that I have not ventured to try, but people seem to like them.  It's a great place to bring a crowd, or sit by yourself with a book at the bar.I'm happy to have a bar like Puffy's as my local.",2,,2
77,Josh N.,"Reading, MA",0,4,0,1.0,5/13/2014,"Went to this place for a drink around 4pm on Tuesday 5/13 after having been there once about two years before and loving it. Let me tell you-what a difference a couple of years can make. The female bartender could not have been less effective than she was. Not a single acknowledgment of our presence was made from the time we walked in to the moment we left as we sat five feet from the bar at a high top in a room of not more than ten people. We waited as she hung out behind the bar chatting it up with some patrons and ignoring us. So we got up and left. Coming from another bartender, she broke the cardinal rule of the service industry, she let money walk out the door. In a city with over 24,000 restaurants and bars competing for our hard earned shekels, there's no room for this.",,,
