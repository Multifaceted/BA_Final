0,Alexis F.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",32,5,0.0,5.0,7/24/2018,Daphne is one of the best massage therapists in NYC. She is intuitive and provides the most precise treatments. Her style sets her apart from regular massage therapists. Her oil blends and foot baths are also highly detoxifying and energizing. She creates her own essential oil blends to help with various ailments and they really work!!,,,
1,Hisako O.,"Palisades Park, NJ",0,6,0.0,5.0,2/28/2018,"As I was looking for a detoxifying massage, I found Daphne, a French lady trained in traditional lymphatic drainage massage and aromatherapy.  The room smelled great, saturated with essential oils.  The treatment began with a detox foot bath with herbal tea and candles.  The massage was gentle and through, very relaxing with a blend of circulation boosting essential oil.  I slept particularly well overnight and woke up energized with improved digestive function.  Definitely detoxifying for me.",,,

Updated review","Daphne is the only woman I go to get my waxing. She is sensitive, gentle, and uses a very special wax  with lavender that is unlike your run of the mill salon. I would highly recommend Belle Fée",,,
3,Sylwia P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",49,8,0.0,4.0,10/16/2017,"Lovely woman, cozy studio in an apartment building. A bit too pricy though. $35 for eyebrow threading.",,,
4,Dia T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,1,5.0,2/4/2016,"Daphné knows exactly what you need in any scenario, From hair removal to skin care Daphné knows exactly what to do. I recently had gotten a severe burn on my hand and Daphné knew exactly which oils to put onto my hand to relive the pain and tune down the swelling. I have also gotten my eyebrows shaped and waxed at Belle Fée, Daphné knew exactly what eyebrow shape I needed for the shape of my face. I would recommend anyone to visit Belle Fée, You will definitely not regret it!",3,,
5,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",53,385,10,4.0,5/16/2016,Daphné was lovely and super accommodating. I was looking for a location near the office with decent reviews and it was great to find her as another alternative t omg usual spot.The building is undergoing renovations so I was a little turned off when I first came in because I didn't know if I was in the right place. The building is home/work building so that explained it when I first came in. I wasn't sure what to look for.Daphné's studio is also great - it has a wonderful working photography studio in the back and she was very thorough. Def will keep her in mind!,,1,
6,Pete M.,"New York, NY",226,329,131,5.0,12/21/2016,Belle Fée products are amazing. I went there to buy a gift for my daughter - a beautiful garnet necklace which comes in a container with cinnamon and frankincense and also picked up a crystal room (feng sui) purifier which has made a noticeable affect on my holiday end of year business anxiety. Finally a sinus oriented mixture which overnight relieved serious  sinus pressures and gave me a great night of sleep.  I also picked up Monoi de Tahiti lavande moisturizing oil with many other qualities and is one of the most seductive scents I ever experienced. This was a gift for my daughter - but I'll have to interview her boy friend now in detail before I give this to her!  I'm a high tech business guy not ordinarily into these types of products but my personal experience is so impressive I'm glad I visited here and learned.,,,
7,Dana R.,"Manhattan, NY",137,16,13,5.0,1/12/2018,"I originally sent my mom to Daphné for a wax when I was looking for services close by and she couldn't have said more amazing things so. So then I went. Since then I have gone for facials and other services. My whole family uses her services and oils for different reason. (pms, back pain, arthritis) I can't recommend her enough for whatever your needs are. You won't be disappointed!",,,
8,Laura B.,"Wilton, CT",1,50,11,5.0,8/2/2016,Loved my waxing.. beautiful job and was pretty much pain free! I need to make another appt soon. :),1,,1
9,Angela P.,"New Hyde Park, NY",8,10,0,5.0,1/6/2015,"I found Daphne on yelp after looking for a reputable salon for a Brazilian. Most salons were charging well over $100, and her prices were affordable.I've been going to Daphne for almost 2 years now - I should've written a positive review sooner! She is gentle and THOROUGH, and extremely accommodating. I went to see her today and was running late due to inclement weather and she still saw me. I recommend Brazilian waxes by Daphne to all of my friends. Of course the experience will be painful the first time, but the wax she uses is much less painful than the typical wax found in average salons. If you have a pretty high pain tolerance, you'll be good to go.My next adventure is trying one of her skin care products. Try her out, she's a doll!",3,,
10,Andreina J.,"Montague Township, NJ",2,29,4,5.0,9/4/2015,"I'm amazed. Okay let's set the background. I probably wax about once a year because to me it's so painful.  I'm chicken for pain and I avoid it like the plaque unless I'm going on vacation. With this said, I'm going on vacation tomorrow and needed a waxing almost for everything. I did some research and found Belle Fee. I'm sold, I probably felt light pain a few times, after that, nothing. It was amazing. The reviews here were on the spot, Daphne is a wonderful woman with the lightest touch ever. I did a Brazilian wax, lip wax, under arm wax and my eyebrows. I left there looking amazing. What's more is that Daphne creates all her products, not only does she wax but she makes her own lotions and oils for every subject possible. Inflammation,  spots, cellulite,  hormonal creams, anti aging, you think of it and she can create it. She even tailor makes it to your need.I don't think I need to search anymore. I had the best experience ever. I'm thrilled to be going to the beach tomorrow!  Thanks a million Daphne!!!",4,,
11,Shannon C.,"New York, NY",4,40,3,5.0,11/13/2013,"Daphne is magical! I found her on Yelp a couple of years ago, and have gone 3 times since for a bikini and leg wax (I know, I know, I should go more often!). I knew right away that she was great, but it wasn't until I had a terrible experience elsewhere that I realized what a gem Belle Fee truly is. You cannot possibly understand what a great wax feels like (yes, it's a real thing!) until you've seen Daphne. I'm telling you, just go. YOU, the frequent waxer. YOU the first-timer. YOU, the I-will-never-ever-do-that-down-there-er. YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS! And for god's sake, tell your mom, too, because she will be shocked she went her whole life thinking waxes were a horrible, evil necessity. I am only sorry I did not write this review sooner! Daphne is absolutely sweet and friendly and will make you feel so relaxed, no matter what you need. Mille fois merci, Daphne! Je suis tout à fait prête pour ce week-end. :)",6,1,
12,Antoinette S.,"Burbank, CA",1056,53,1,5.0,12/8/2013,"If I could give her more stars, I WOULD!!!!  First off, she had available appointment time the same day. The way I knew that was because she replied to my email within 10 minutes of me sending it.  Wonderfully curteous, polite and professional.  She understood that I was stuck in traffic and assured me that she'd wait for me to get there and maintained her wonderful-ness when I arrive 20 minutes later than my appointment time. On to the waxing!  It was PERFECT!  She wore gloves, she got EVERYTHING and somehow she made it one of the least painful waxes I've ever had (and I hadn't had one in approximately 3 months!!!!!!)   She was so personable and her home office was very cozy, organized and neat.  AND she was so wonderful to keep me talking to keep my mind off of it, eventhough I've been waxing for years. And the conversation was so nice!  It was like talking to a new friend for the first time!  I've found my waxer (after having relocated from LA, which has some of the best waxing places, imo) and I will recommend her to ANYONE who needs a bikini wax in the NYC area!OH!! And I forgot!  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this is the first time that my skin wasn't irritated as soon as I got home!  She gave me a sample of some of her holistic oil that she assured would help with discoloration and irritation and it worked on the irritation almost immediately.  I will ALWAYS go to Ms Daphne at Belle Fee (And no worries.  She's the only one doing the service so you don't have to ask for her!)",4,3,
13,Tara P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0,5.0,9/26/2013,"I have been going to Daphne now for about a year, usually every 4-5 weeks, so I feel more than ready to comment on her services.  I had not been much of a fan of bikini waxes for most of my life (I am in my late 40s and did not grow up with this and I'm a feminist and why does everyone want to look like little girls all of a sudden...?) but recently I just got sick of my less-than-together bush and decided to get rid of almost all of it.  I was scared though - between my poor, virtually untouched triangle of baby skin (except that one time years ago at the nail salon - OMG that was torture!!) and my off-the-charts, pathetic intolerance for pain, I was pretty sure I would not make it through.  I explained all of this to Daphne, so my first session was potentially kind of an experiment.  To my surprise, I was able to handle almost all of it relatively easily, and the rest with only a little screaming (just kidding, I didn't scream, I just cursed like a sailor).  Daphne was about as gentle as one could be while ripping your hair out with wax, but more importantly she was very sweet.   Also, it's always weird spreading your legs into odd positions for a complete stranger (well, for some of us), but Daphne knows how to make you feel like it's a perfectly normal thing to be doing.  I really loved that I was going to her apartment and there was NO ONE ELSE (!) there before or after me.  That doesn't always happen - sometimes someone is leaving as I arrive, but most of the time I see no one else, and I love that!  It's like she's MY personal waxer! Her prices are better than any fancy salon, too, and for me her location is very convenient, with easy public transportation.  I just text or email her when I want an appointment and she usually responds within an hour and rarely cannot accommodate me when I wish to come.  (NB-I believe she goes away for the month of August each year.)Without her, I'm not sure I'd be all smooth now.  Well, almost all smooth - except for that little bit.  You know.  Fight the power.",3,5,2
14,Lisa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,0,5.0,2/3/2014,"I just had my first appointment with Daphne and, as strange as this is to say for a wax, really enjoyed it!To book the appointment, I left a voicemail and she called back right away. I got an appointment for the next day.During the appointment, she was really friendly and engaged me in good conversation.I just moved to New York from Los Angeles where I tried a few of the upscale waxing boutiques that claim to use techniques that cause less pain, but I think Daphne's wax was even less painful than these boutiques.At the end I was delighted that she happily accepted my credit card. She also sells a collection of products she makes herself which I asked about, but she did not try to push them on me.I read a previous review complaining that Daphne used the same wooden stick for the entire wax, but in my experience she used a new, clean stick each time she applied the wax.",1,,
15,Kiki A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,2,5.0,2/6/2015,"3 reasons to love Daphne Hagadone:1) Her products. All hand-crafted by her from natural plant-derived ingredients.  I just discovered this new oil she makes, which is a mix of anti-viral plants.  Guys - IT""S THE BOMB!  I put a drop under my nose and rub it on my neck/chest area.  It works wonders if you feel like you're getting sick - I use it daily for prophylactic purposes and got a few of my coworkers addicted to it too. Also, I've been using her lavender oil for everything: wax aftercare, in my hair, on my skin, as massage oil.2) Brazilian bikini wax.  Found Daphne a little over a year ago on Yelp and have been seeing her 1-2x a month ever since.  She uses a different kind of wax, which my skin reacts really well too - I never get any irritation.  Would not let any other waxer near me  (Daphne, if you ever leave NY, I'm coming with you!!)3) The experience.  At the risk of sounding like a creep, I actually really enjoy getting my brazilians.  I go to Belle Fee for Daphne's superhuman waxing powers, but also really enjoy the whole process and look forward to my appointments.  With all the oils, lotions, and potions she makes at the salon, it always smells fantastic, I enjoy talking to her, and find the whole experience to be very relaxing.  Next up: One day very soon, I will treat myself to her facials and massages.",4,,
16,Ronda H.,"CUMBERLAND FURNACE, TN",25,32,26,5.0,10/30/2012,"Working on cruise ships all over the world I've had all sorts of experiences when it comes to leg, underarm and Brazilian waxes.  Coming into NYC I couldn't make an appointment until early the morning I needed the appointment because I was at sea. I was immediately texted back and Daphne worked me in that morning in the very small window I had available. She has a nice place and I was very comfortable. One of, if not the best wax I've ever had. There is no need for me to go anywhere else whenever I'm in NYC and I recommend you don't either. She's worth the trip, and worth the price. Super easy decision all around. Thanks Daphne for such a wonderful wax!",3,,
17,Jung K.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,5.0,1/15/2016,"I went to Belle Fée to get lymphatic massage done--I've been looking to get it done somewhere around New York and hadn't found the right place (or it's been hard to get appointments). Daphné called me back ASAP and I went the next evening after work. The place is really comfortable, private, and clean. Daphné is hilarious, charming, and ultra knowledgeable about planet essences and essential oils. She makes her own oils and mixtures and their quality is noticeable. I didn't get any allergic reaction during or after the session, and I just felt great. I was given a foot bath before we started and WOW I felt my feet super alive and awakened for a few hours after. The actual massage is the real deal and I saw immediate effects in decreased bloating (overdid it a little at the holidays as usual but I felt oddly bloated this year due to all the meat/sodium) and better circulation that were persistent for days afterwards. I've had lymphatic drainage done before but I was even surprised this time because the difference was so dramatic. As a result, I was motivated to make some other changes after the session which have been helpful. She gave me some other advice to take to avoid getting in the same kind of sluggish situation, and I will definitely be back to see her. The session was long and not rushed and so worth it. I felt so much better after that I walked the 40+ blocks back home because it was like floating away.",2,,

Updated review","Well, it's been one week and I'm still as smooth as a baby's butt! NO itching, redness or ingrown hairs. Everything is just as pristine as when I went in for my waxing a week ago. Shaving? Ha! Never again.",2,,1
19,Ruthlyn S.,"Rego Park, NY",1,1,1,4.0,4/4/2015,Simply fantastic! At Belle Fee the lovely Daphne greets you and you instantly feel at home. She offers gentle care that is focused on your specific needs. She understood how to treat my skin and created products on the spot to treat my acne and hyperpigmentation. I have fallen in love with her skin products. I was so surprised to learn how affective the essential oils are with their many healing properties. I go back for refills the moment I start to run low on that wonderful face oil. So glad I work in the area close to Belle Fee. Well done Daphne!,1,,
20,Susan T.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",21,3,0,5.0,5/8/2016,"Daphne' is magical!  From start to finish I felt my body relax and my skin was overjoyed that I found her!  My facial was tailored to my stressed-out very needy skin.  She was accommodating to my schedule, knowledgable of her craft and incredibly insightful to my weary skin.  So glad that I found her and will continue to sing her praises and return again and again.",,,
21,Ronda C.,"Winston Salem, NC",70,60,121,5.0,10/14/2013,"I don't know what Daphne puts in her wax, but my guess is marshmallow stars and glitter rainbows because I felt like a cartoon princess afterward. I've been to about 15 different salons in my bikini wax life, and this is the easiest/smoothest I've ever had. I kept bracing myself for those strips of agony. Missed out completely on that. We set up our appointment through text messaging after my original phone call, which was helpful because I was running errands in noisy places when we set things up. Her business is home-based, and you must check in with the doorman before taking the elevator, which made me feel safer about going into a residential high-rise. Daphne's adorable French accent and charming stories made the time go by fast. I can't wait to try a facial. If you are visiting NYC and staying in the Hell's Kitchen/Broadway area, you are steps away from the magic at Belle Fee.",4,5,2

24,Jennifer F.,"New York, NY",0,8,2,5.0,6/19/2014,"I really recommend Daphne for waxing, she was efficient and friendly, and it was absolutely the least pain I've ever experienced for a Brazilian wax.  An entirely positive experience and I will be booking with her again, and the price was entirely reasonable.",1,,

26,Grumbles J.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,42,22,5.0,1/11/2008,"Best bikini wax ever!!I must admit, I've only gone to Daphne once (today), but I can't imagine ever going to anyone else. I heard about her on Citysearch and I wanted to put her up here as well.Firstly, Daphne's salon is in the front half of her apartment (therefore no walks-ins...appt only). It felt strange knocking on an apartment door, but the salon section of her house is so professional and beautiful--much larger and nicer than other waxing salons I've been to. Secondly, Daphne is very sweet and down to earth. She is French and has a lovely accent. She makes a lot of her own products (she went to school for biochemistry), and swears by the Tahitian line of products she carries as well. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, I just got the best bikini wax from her! The french wax she uses makes the process MUCH less painful. I was shocked by how little it hurt (and I hadn't been in quite a while!) She is meticulous and quite a perfectionist, so you won't leave with even one stray hair. My skin has NO pain or redness. This really is a miracle wax! I'm shocked more people don't use it. Also, at other salons, they apply the wax, press on the paper, wait for it...then RIP! Here, Daphne applies the wax to several sections at one time. By the time she's finished applying the 4th row, she goes back to the beginning and rips them all off one after another (there is no paper involved--she rips the wax itself off). This technique gives you a lot of down time from the pain so you're not always clenched and upset.",11,1,5
27,F A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,1,3.0,6/13/2014,"She's super sweet! However, i've never seen my face react the way it did after her facial. Face was full of bumps that lasted a few days, afterwards i did end up with a few scars, nothing major, i'm assuming a result of the extractions. My skin is definitely sensitive but even other places i've been to for facials, i've never left with so many bumps. I'm not sure if that's a normal but it was def. a bit scary.",,,
28,Lauren G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/24/2014,"Make sure you are not double-booked!!  I was looking forward to a positive experience for my first Brazilian wax after reading all these reviews, but instead received a wax that was rushed and mediocre.I arrived and should have left after Daphne told me she had someone else booked and made a mistake but could fit me in anyway.  But I was leaving for vacation soon and had already mentally prepared myself, and trusted she would still do a good job.  I told her it was my first Brazilian wax, but I don't think that mattered - thankfully, I have a high tolerance for pain.  My experience was probably out of the ordinary, but I really wish she would have rescheduled after realizing her mistake instead of putting me through the wax.  She didn't use any talcum powder beforehand, waxed over the same area multiple times, and didn't apply any pressure after lifting off each strip to reduce pain.  I read from other reviews that she is very thorough, even using tweezers for strays - there was no final look, just one strip of wax after the other on the same area until I looked down at one point and saw a few beads of blood.  I had hair growing back within a few days of the wax, which makes me think she ripped most of it off instead of pulling from the roots.I had also booked an underarm wax but told her when I arrived I wasn't sure my hair was long enough - she said she'd try anyway and gave me a wax that left half the hair still there and my underarms raw and on fire from so many pulls on the same spot.  Finally, when I went to pay she gave me prices that were ten dollars more than those on her website.  She gave me a ""discount"" on my underarms to make up for the poor job, which ended up being the price I thought I'd be paying anyway.  I payed hastily and left, but looking back realize she put the price plus tax on her phone credit card machine to bulk up the tip from 15 to 20 percent.  Needless to say once was enough for me - for my next wax I'll be going elsewhere.",4,,
29,Inna A.,"New York, NY",7,7,1,5.0,7/4/2012,"i found belle fee about two years ago, and am SO glad i did.  at 26, i was already getting tons of wrinkles around my eyes.  i have very fair skin, and on top of that i hate taking care of myself. not a good combination.  i'd never invested any time or energy in finding the right thing to take care of my skin.  i mean, there seem to be endless options.  just doing the research would send me into panic attack mode.   when i first med Daphne ( i actually found her for her waxing services -- which by the way are AMAZING), she noticed how parched my skin looked, and told me about her face creams.  i had nothing to lose, so i said i'd give this stuff a go.  for my fair complexion, daphne recommended the rose.  a week after using the face cream, i noticed a dramatic difference.  a few weeks in, my face felt smoother AND my wrinkles started to disappear!  Daphne was right, what my skin needed was some serious moisture.  i use belle fee products all year round.  i use the basic face cream, and also i have this oil stuff i use in the winter.  because all of her products are so natural, literally made from flowers + plant oils, you can use them for skin, hair, they're antibacterial, protect from the sun.  almost too good to be true.  except that these are the same ingredients people have been using for hundreds of years.  this stuff really works!  can you tell i'm a huge fan ? :P  anyway, two years later, my skin looks better than it did when i first saw Daphne.  and honestly, a $60 jar of face cream that lasts you six months and erases the signs of stress and pollution of nyc off your skin?  that's the smartest investment in myself i've ever made.",3,,
30,Caroline P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,6/16/2013,"One word: AMAZING! I went to see Daphne two months ago for body scrub. She's very friendly and she knows what she's doing. She also advices me on what I should and should't eat/drink, which is very helpful because I am into healthy lifestyle.I came home feeling so relaxed plus my skin was so smooth and glowing.So that 's GOOD - as I expected. But here's the reason why I gave her 5 stars - AMAZING. In general, I have a very super sensitive and uneven skin tone on my face with black spots here and there; on top of that I had an old scar from broken wine glasses I got after a wild party and scars on my back. But I have to admit that I have a nice tan skin although looks dull. I went to dermatologist of course but the same problem comes and goes. I am tired and am not really into chemicals- if possible stay natural. So after I had my body scrub, I decided to have a go on buying her producs: face moisturiser, shampoo, body lotion, lipgloss, and also Daphne made a special opil for my scar. All naturals- from plant extracts. I thought it would have cost me a lot, apparently not. The price is affordable. I tried the products and within a week - voila! My skin has never been this better! My face became even and moisture, my body skin is glowing. The scar is gradully diminishing. Wonderful. In the beginning of summer - this June- I emailed Daphne, saying if she could make an oil that could help me with the skin allergies in the summer. She emailed me back asking what my problem is. I mentioned: if it's too hot or humid, my body starts itching and rash comes and I scratch and becomes scars. Vicious cycle! She said yes. So after couple days I had the oild with me.  I used that after taking shower AND ... the next morning I emailed her saying "" I had no idea what the hell you put inside but for the first time in my whole life, in summer time, I slept like a baby without scratching my body.

I have gotten Brazilian waxes in the past, but wasn't in the mood to go through all that pain, so I just made an appointment for a bikini wax at Bella Fee.  I had read previous reviews about the relatively pain free waxes other women have received, but thought they were just being nice.  Ladies, I think she uses magic wax, b/c when I tell you it was the least painful waxing I've ever received, that's putting it mildly. She takes her time and makes sure everything is even and smooth. I just can't get over the minimal pain I felt. And you know how a couple days after a Brazilian/bikini wax, you start to get ingrown hairs?  NOT ONE ingrown hair! A bikini and lip was was $65. I just moved to NYC, so I'm not sure if that's considered expensive, but it's worth every penny in my opinion. I'll definitely be going back for a wax, and may even add a facial next time. If you are looking for a clean and virtually painless waxing experience, please call Bella Fee. I promise you this, you will be so glad you did!",2,,

She said i's gonna hurt!!!!...and it did but not to the degree I was expecting:-) For a first time wax it was not bad and very fast! Highly recommend Daphne. Clean environment and very sanitary practice. New wax sticks, no double dipping, and constantly changing gloves. I would be back again for sure...",,,
40,Tonya J.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/20/2013,I found Daphne through this website and have been pleased ever since. She is incredibly knowledgeable and personable. She has blended formulas of essential oils for the scars on my face and I have noticed a significant improvement in the  appearance. Her bikini waxes are close to painless and ingrown hairs are a thing of the past. She most recently blended a natural product for my hair which has returned the shine and texture. The only reason i hesitate to write this review is because I don't want anyone else to find out how great she is for fear I may not get in to see her again. :) I'm so thankful I found her and I now feel like I have a natural noninvasive answer for the skin issues I've been facing. She also gives great tips on foods and old school natural remedies that help with skin and body . Thanks Daphne,1,,
41,Ying C.,"Manhattan, NY",181,240,112,5.0,11/22/2010,"I went to Daphne for a brazillian wax.  She was nice enough to squeeze me in a last minute appointment.  Very friendly and professional overall experience, and the fact that it's in an apartment makes me feel more at ease.  She gave me a sample for my skin afterwards.  I can't wait to go back to try out other services!",2,,
42,It's P.,"Stone Mountain, GA",0,7,0,4.0,4/4/2013,I went to Daphne for a massage and it was great! A little on the pricey side. Its $140 for a 2hr massage. I was really tense so she even worked her magic for an extra hour b/c she didn't have a client after me and she didn't even charge me extra. The aroma in her work area is amazing. I would definitely recommend her. The only reason Im giving Belle fee 4 stars is because of the price. I got a lymphatic massage which you could get for $40-$60.,1,,
43,Rosemary R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,57,0,5.0,1/11/2013,"Daphne is the best waxer in NYC. No aftermath issues, no rash, no redness. She is gentle and a great individual too. Her products are terrific as well. Highly recommend her.",1,,
44,Tiff T.,"Bellevue, WA",433,214,230,5.0,12/21/2009,Came in for a $60 brazilian and left with a $258 bill - Daphne and her products are worth every penny ;D,5,1,
45,Denise W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,2,4.0,6/1/2011,"I went to Daphne for a bikini and an underarm wax. She was friendly and as other yelpers have indicated the wax was much less painful than the usual wax, paper and rip. The day was humid and the wax was sticky but Daphne experienced as she is had no issues. Its been about a week and no rash just baby soft skin. No ingrown hairs either as she uses her oils to soothe and calm the skin. PS: I also bought the hair oil and LOVE it! I have used it on my hair (natural AA hair) and it has moisturized and softened my thick hair like none other. I also used it in the tub, on my elbows and knees and a dab behind my ears just cause i love the smell.",,,
46,J C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,5.0,7/25/2012,"Daphne is amazing. She's friendly, helpful, and so, so good at her job.  It's on the pricey side, but I'd pay so much more for what I get with Daphne.",2,,
47,Daphne B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,3/13/2013,"I've been getting facials from Daphne for two years now and they are truly amazing.  The wear and tear of city life, not to mention never getting enough sleep, is tough on your skin but I leave Belle Fee with my face completely rejuvenated.  She gives the full hour on the table, with a massage that is incredibly relaxing and a mask that does a super deep clean.  People often comment on how clear my skin looks and I really have to credit Daphne, as well as her Monoi products which are utterly fabulous.  Gone are the days of scratchy feet and dry hands- the lotions she makes are balm for the long winter months that dry skin.  And my skin just drinks in the facial moisturizer she makes.  I am a life long customer and could not recommend her more!",,,
48,Manisha M.,"New York, NY",1,10,0,5.0,10/4/2010,"Daphne was great.  She was friendly and put me at ease.  A wax is never a fun time but I wasn't in pain, no bumps even hours later, I will definitely go back. I appreciated her knowledge and professionalism.",2,,1
49,A G.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,9/28/2010,"I would highly recommend Daphne, she is excellent at what she does and puts you at ease. I came in for my first brazilian which I was definitely scared to do, but she takes her time and it's not as painful as I expected, in fact it wasn't that painful at all. The procedure takes about an hour. It is 100% worth the cost and you definitely get more than what you pay for. I would recommend her to anyone and plan on going back and getting my husband a lymphatic massage.",1,,
50,j m.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,5.0,5/21/2009,"simply the best!i love going to her apt...(it still feels like a spa, minus all thepeople)its private, serene, she is a great talker, she cares and is anal about hair removal.  she uses the most natural and best products.and once i went there and had burned my hand quite badly, and she gave me this essential oil mix that totally healed my hand and now i have become addicted to it.Go to her for waxings!   and also for her homemade wonderful flower remedies!!  most of the essential oils i find at stores are too strong for my skin and she knows how to make the perfect little mixture!!  i just love this little place,  home made candles and a bunch of well priced goodies for those that want a more natural and holistic approach to beauty!!",2,,
