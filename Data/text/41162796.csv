The atmosphere was classy and clean and the food was delicious! We tried various things of which the following were definitely memorable. A great place to get with large group of friends - we will be back!* crab toast* main lobster* strozzapreti* broccoli rabe* black sea bass,

My friends and I shared a cheese plate as an appetizer and I had the roasted monkfish as my entree. The food by itself probably deserved three stars, but the service that we got pushed the review back to two stars. Really not much to say, but Yelp's auto-review suggestion of two stars pretty much sums it up: ""Meh, I've experienced better"" was exactly how I felt about ABC Kitchen.",1

Updated review",293,,"Las Vegas, NV",Mal C.,18,3.0,179,"The food is still delicious and the bussing staff was wonderful, but I extend a 3 star rating because of the waiter that our table had. The waiter was rude from the first encounter. We had a five year old in the group, but he was behaving well and there was no reason to approach us sideways. We decided to share food and when a couple of plates were cleared, a busser visited to remove them. We continued to stack empty plates on the side of our table in order to make space and avoid a mess for our little one. Then, the waiter came and said we don't clear the table until everyone is finished, but in this case I will take them. I live in Las Vegas and hearing this instead of ""how is everything"" and simply removing the items was ridiculous. I felt like we were assumed to not belong in the restaurant, even though we caused no scene or trouble. While I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in 2016, I was disappointed this visit. Of the food we had, the crab toast was the best. Other items were good but not memorable. Our least favorite was the broccoli rabe. The chili was overpowering and the flavor combo was not appealing.",
3,,11/5/2018,12,,"Manhattan, NY",Valerie N.,399,4.0,324,"Strong 4.5 stars! Came in for brunch and reservations were easy to get. The ambiance is lovely and upscale, but not stuffy. I loved the decor with the exposed wood ceiling and the light, open feeling. Service is great too. I had the tuna sashimi appetizer and while the portion is small, the flavor is great! Eggs Benedict with salmon: so so good! The portion was generous for me. There were also potatoes which were good. Freshly squeezed OJ: very good and fresh! Yay! I would certainly come back!",
4,1,10/15/2018,165,,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",Melissa D.,85,5.0,37,"Chic, modern and rustic restaurant where the food is fresh fresh fresh!!I had made reservations 30 days in advance (crazy but necessary). We arrived to the restaurant early and were not seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time, which was a little frustrating but luckily things turned around from there. We enjoyed a drink in the beautiful bar area until we were seated. The dining room is gorgeous, with lots of white wood, glass, dim lighting and rustic yet modern décor.  To start we ordered the Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad at the recommendation of a friend. I know this does not sound exciting, but it was the most fresh, delicious salad I have had in a long time. Order it! The carrots were roasted perfectly, fresh avocado, crispy seeds, large croutons with a citrus dressing-perfection! They also start you off with complimentary bread as well. We all shared the Fried Organic Chicken, which was special too and not your ordinary fried chicken. The breading was extremely light and crispy, chicken was perfect and juicy as well all sitting in a decadent butter sauce. My other favorite of the night was the Winter Squash Campanelle with parmesan and nutmeg-a perfect dish for fall. I kept having ""one last bite"" and couldn't stop! We also had on the side, the Mashed Potatoes with sea salt, and those were fantastic as well. Rich and decadent!Before arriving I wasn't all that excited about the menu choices and not sure if ABC Kitchen would live up to the hype, but it definitely went beyond my expectations with it's extraordinary twists on their dishes. It was my favorite food while visiting NYC!",1
5,1,10/14/2018,32,,"Manhattan, NY",Matt M.,159,4.0,64,"What can I possibly write that hasn't already been written about this NYC institution?!  ABC Kitchen captures what hospitality is all about:  warm, attentive, and generous service; great food; and a terrific ambiance.  The space itself is absolutely breathtaking.We dined at ABC for Saturday brunch.   My girlfriend was a bit indecisive in her choice of wine and our friendly and knowledgeable waiter was able to guide us through their wine menu.  He even offered a tasting prior to making a selection!  I decided to be boring and ordered a cup of coffee - one of the best cups of coffee I've had in the city.For starters, we shared the Crab Toast with Lemon Aoli.  The crab was fresh, delicious, and well dressed (solid portion size too).  Definitely the highlight of our meal.  For mains, we ordered the Eggs Benedict with Flying Pigs Farm Ham and the Cabbage and Apple Salad.  The Eggs Benedict was amazing.  The yolk was perfectly runny, the muffin was homemade, and the chef piled on a heaping serving of some damn good ham.  Unfortunately, the salad fell short.  The dish was too acidic owing to the vinegar and the cashew yogurt didn't really pop.  Perhaps poor dish selection.  If it weren't for the salad mishap I would have rated this place five stars.",
6,,10/4/2018,194,,"Chicago, IL",Serena S.,204,4.0,98,"I've been here twice before. The first time I came with my friend and our meal was very rushed. We came on a Friday night and they had us in and out within 45 minutes. We felt like we couldn't enjoy our meal. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and mains and they still rushed us through it very quickly. The food was good, but the overall experience that time was a 3/5. The next time I came was on a Thursday and it was definitely a 5/5! We sat there for about 3 hours and enjoyed our meal. The appetizers, wine, and main dishes were all Delicious. Good portions and tasty food! The service was also great and the server was very patient with us while we took our time with ordering and eating! I would recommended the ricotta ravioli and toast with heirloom tomatoes",1
7,,10/5/2018,226,,"New York, NY",Lianna T.,132,3.0,98,"I made a reservation weeks in advance to celebrate my mother's birthday at ABC Kitchen (her choice) and am so disappointed that the restaurant did not live up to our expectations. We had been years ago for lunch and had so enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant is set inside the store and has beautifully mismatched plates and an overall modern but chic decor. The atmosphere was still lovely, but the chaos, noisy-ness, and slow service made for an overall unenjoyable dinner. When I called, I had informed them it was my mother's birthday and was so pleased that they said they could bring out a birthday cupcake and candle at the end of the meal. However, we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room - and it was so loud we could barely hear each other even when shouting. We ordered the new-to-the- menu cabbage and apple salad with apple cider vinegar and walnut dressing and the sea bass entree to split. The salad was okay - an interesting combination of flavors, but something I felt could be recreated in a home kitchen and with a more sizable portion. The sea bass was quite good as the fish tasted fresh, flaky and flavorful. While the meal was okay - waiting for our orders to be taken, the food to come, and then the plates to be cleared was frustratingly slow. The restaurant was filled with waiters, but getting the attention of any one felt impossible. By the time we finished our courses, spent ten minutes trying to get our plates cleared, another ten trying to get the dessert menu, and another ten trying to place our order, my mother decided she would enjoy a dessert in a calmer, less chaotic environment. The birthday cupcake never came and we left the restaurant feeling frustrated and with slight headaches. Overall, the food was good, but honestly not worth the largely disorienting, loud, and frustrating experience that was supposed to be a calm and happy celebration.",
8,2,9/3/2018,120,,"Cincinnati, OH",Stephen C.,522,5.0,105,"Coming from the Midwest, my expectations were not very high for a 'farm to table concept' in the middle of Manhattan.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurants ability to serve up traditional American fare (much of which is sourced organically and locally) and at the same time provide a contemporary twist on these dishes.Huge fan of the interior environment, a mixture of modern and rustic.  I love the spacious seating arrangements - probably one of the most spacious, private seating arrangements for four I have experienced in an popular manhattan restaurant.  Food is exactly what I would expect from a farm to table concept - traditional dishes with focus on fresh organic ingredients. Appetizers - calamari is awesome - fresh, not chewy, and perfect amount of outside crisp.  Crab toast is probably their most popular appetizers - it was very good - overflowing with crab meat and they allow the crab to shine with low seasoning / mayonnaise.  Cheese and meat board was also good - appreciated how the waiter spent a good deal of time explaining the sourcing and preparation of each item.  Roasted carrot salad was also very good and would recommend for a share.Entrees - hands down the fried chicken is the best dish on the menu - and probably is one of the best in the city.  Super juicy chicken breast and an amazing light breading around it.  The breading is so light and crispy I thought it was a cream puff outside initially.    The pork chop is probably my number 2 on the menu.  Beautifully prepared with the perfect cook and seasoning.  Sea bass closely follows the pork chop, and would be a great lighter fare option.  Wrapped up the meal with a decadent blue berry cobbler with a side of goat milk ice cream.  I usually am not a fan of anything goat related - however the added sharpness to the ice cream as the perfect compliment to the sweet cobbler.Awesome meal. Highly recommend.  Use open table to book in advance as they get very busy.  Will be back.",1
9,1,10/24/2018,699,,"Westminster, CA",Ashley H.,57,5.0,60,"We were recommended to this restaurant from a foodie friend, and it did not disappoint. Luckily, we were able to make a reservation a little less than a week in advance. Ambiance - (5/5) It's a beautiful and elegant restaurant. It is very dimly lit but a nice place to have a celebration (birthday, anniversary, etc.). The only thing is that it is pretty hard to read the menu in the dark. Service - (5/5) For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected great service and it deliver. I think that my water was refilled a total of 10 times throughout the entire meal. We were checked on constantly by the staff who were friendly and helpful. Food:Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - (5/5) This was extremely tasty and loaded with shredded crab meat. The lemon aioli was the perfect touch of citrus and balanced the richness of the crab meat well.Shaved raw fluke, ocean herbs, and fermented green chili - (5/5) This was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was so light and refreshing yet each bite was an explosion of flavor. It was perfectly balanced with fresh herbs and the bits of fruit in the dish were delicious. It was sweet, salty, and sour in the perfect amounts. Line caught Tuna sashimi - (3.5/5) I don't personally like tuna very much. It was really good and like the other sushi dish, it was very refreshing but the flavors weren't as good as the fluke so I would choose that dish over this one. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs - (4/5) The sea bass was cooked perfectly, extremely fresh, and melted in your mouth. While the fish was delicious, the dish is essentially in a soup. I would have preferred the fish to be prepared differently. Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream - (4.5/5) This was incredibly tasty and very salty (in a good way). It's not overly sweet but extremely tasty. The candied peanuts and popcorn were a perfect addition. The whipped cream and hot fudge was delicious. A perfect ending to the meal!",1
10,3,8/12/2018,227,,"Queens, NY",Suzanna H.,538,5.0,103,"Came here for restaurant week. Food;You get complimentary bread. I would recommend accepting it as you can dip it into the amazing sauce from the shaved raw fluke appetizer. For the appetizer I got the Shaved raw fluke with market radishes, picked green strawberries and herbs. This was my favorite. The presentation was on point and was consistent with top quality and price. Beautiful assortment of colors, flavors, textures and finesse. This was an insta worthy dish. You are pretty much eating a garden with beautiful little flowers. The flavors we're sophisticated and blended so well together. This dish was a perfectly light and refreshing dish for the summer season. For the main course I got the seared salmon on the Bibb salad with market vegetables and a spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette. It was okay. It was certainly quite big and very filling. The food tasted fresh with good quality ingredients but I thought it could have been more creative. The vinaigrette reminded me of some sort of spicy ranch sauce and that wasn't something I expected in this type of establishment. So food wise, get the shaved raw fluke.Service; This was wonderful. The server was super nice and helpful. The water was constantly refilled. The dish was covered to keep it warm when I went to the bathroom. Overall just amazing service.",2
11,1,10/20/2018,322,,"Jersey City, NJ",Alexandra T.,303,4.0,351,"Had been dying to try ABC Kitchen for 2 yrs and finally made it for my birthday with two gal pals on a Wed evening at 8pm. I made the reservation on open table 2-3 weeks before and didn't have a problem picking a time. As we walked in, we were seated promptly, which I always appreciate! The spot is surprisingly enormous. The fact that it is so hard to get a res here with ample seating is insane, but a great sign that there's always high demand.We started out with a bottle of chianti. It was reasonably priced for a notable restaurant in NYC. We started out with the house made ricotta and fig jam as well as the roasted carrot and avo salad. The house made ricotta was super fresh and creamy and was balanced perfectly with the sweet fig jam. The smooth textures of the jam and ricotta went so well with the toasted crostini. The roasted carrot and avo salad was surprisingly flavorful; loved how such simple ingredients had so much flavor!For my main course, I got the full portion of the campanelle in a tomato sauce with buratta, cherry tomatoes, and sausage. The campanelle was homeade and absolutely delicious!For my bday, we also split the chocolate cake, which was HUGE and phenomenal. Would definitely come back and try some of the wood fired pizzas, pretzel dusted calamari app and some different fish or meat entrees. The only complaint my group had about our experience was the poor service. We felt undermined by our waiter from the moment he spoke to us. He clearly didn't give us enough time to look over the menu and then came back every few minutes to see if we were ready yet. There was no reason for him to rush us and he could have used his social awareness skills to not ask us 4-5 times if we were ready to order within 15 min. He was also not friendly throughout the meal. When it came time to order dessert, he made a comment that the menus were on the table the entire dinner and seemed annoyed that we hadn't realized. For a meal that takes long to get a reservation and isn't cheap, I expect service to be top-notch and it was completely unacceptable that we weren't treated in a warm or respectful manner.",1
12,1,10/8/2018,43,1,"Lehigh Acres, FL",Andrea S.,161,3.0,63,"Beautiful restaurant but, overpriced and food was mediocre.Visited on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Reservations are a must if you want specific seating or don't wish to wait or for pretty much any reason.We had a group of 4 and had made reservations but, they gave us seats that had stools and with one of our guests being pregnant, we though it better to switch to another table. We were 1st told that there were none but, the bar. After another request and some time, we were given a different table which we appreciated.We had a friendly waiter but, some of the ways the food was described didn't seem appealing. Things like-""tomato water, French toast that's kinda raw in the middle"". Safe to say we didn't order any of those. The brunch offerings were not substantial compared to other places I've been. Seemed more lunch like to me. I ordered a cup of green juice which was quite expensive. I had the spinach and ricotta omelette that didn't do much for me besides being fresh. It came with potatoes that were quite hard on the outside and didn't offer much in the way of flavor.We did have some good, flaky cheddar biscuits though. I got to meet Deepak Chopra(whom I admire greatly) on my way to my table  so, that was a nice touch but, I would probably not return. I could get a cheaper meal elsewhere or with more variety for brunch or better tastes.",2
13,,8/18/2018,914,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Hannah M.,1038,3.0,271,"Great, but overpriced. The JGV name carries a lot of weight, and in this city, that weight comes along with prices that are about 20% more than they should be. However, I found the value of this place and the quality of the food to be substantially better than the Latin sister ABC Cocina.Went with a large group and split a number of appetizers among the table. My favorites were the roasted beets with yogurt ($14) and the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16). The beets were absolutely phenomenal and the yogurt was unlike any I've had before. The missable dishes were the roast carrot and avocado salad ($17) and the summer squash and arugula salad ($16). Neither were bad, I just found them to be the least-exceptional and most-overpriced of the apps. The pretzel-dusted calamari ($18) was great, but no better than calamari I've had other places. I enjoyed all the appetizers and found, later, that they were the highlight of the meal. We each ordered our own main dish - typically I would have headed straight for the cheeseburger, but being that I was at a business dinner I opted for the cleaner and more sophisticated monkfish ($34), which was served alongside summer squash, tomatoes, and basil. I had only had monkfish once before when it was one of the choices for the catch of the day at Seamore's, but remembered liking it. I'm not sure if it was something in the fish itself or the flavoring, but I was unimpressed, both by the dish and the portion size. For dessert, we again passed around a number of dishes. The best, by far, were the blueberry pie with goat milk ice cream and lavender ($13) and the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ($12). The almond cake and chocolate cake (the latter especially) were remarkably dry and bland. The interior is awesome and clearly adorned with pieces from ABC Carpet & Home. Service was professional but not stiff. All in all, I've found the JGV's restaurants excel with fruits and veggies but have yet to master meats/fishes/etc. Will try abcV at some point to test my logic.",1
14,1,8/5/2018,105,,"Chicago, IL",Andrew L.,231,5.0,73,"We came here for dinner Saturday night, place was packed. We had a reservation, would recommend.The place looks like it should be on Pinterest. It probably is. Sometimes places with very trendy aesthetics don't actually have great food. That was not the issue here. The pretzel dusted calamari was very tender. I didn't think pretzel dusting added much to it, but fried squid is delicious so I wasn't upset about it.I, like most basic white girls, must have my carbs. We ordered two pastas, and two pizzas. We got the ricotta ravioli since our waiter described them as ""little pockets of joy"". He wasn't wrong. We also got the fettuccine. My god those noodles were good. They were the perfect thickness and texture. Soaked up the pesto sauce really well. I think this pasta was easily top 3 pastas of my life.The thin pizzas were also very tasty. Structurally didn't hold up super well but was still good. I actually really enjoyed the crust of these pizzas too. They killed it with the carbs here.We also had the Black Sea bass. I think that the quality of the fish, and the technique it was prepared with was superb. It was so tender and just melted in your mouth. I do think that the sauce with it was that flavorful. It might have been intentionally more mild, but I'm not a mild man.No true dining experience is complete without dessert. If you disagree, that's fine. You're just wrong and I hate you. We had a slice of the s'mores chocolate cake. Loved the toasted marshmallow on it because it's toasted marshmallow. Great way to end the meal.",

They also give you bread for the table, so keep that in mind when ordering! Our food was all very good and high quality, they're all about serving local produce. You definitely pay NYC prices but the ambiance is really nice and if you want a bougie experience go here. The company owns a furniture store and it's connected around back, which explains all the interesting furniture pieces. I'd recommend a visit!",
19,3,8/30/2018,446,,"Brooklyn, NY",Lillian Y.,1183,4.0,267,"Food: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 4/5Value: 3.5/5I've been here a few times over the years, and nothing is quite ""wrong"" with this place but the food doesn't excite me. I also find some items overpriced. This is (I think) an older JG restaurant, and the menu reflects what was 'en vogue"" 10+ years ago. However, the space itself is completely modern and beautiful. Crab Toast (5/5) is something I could eat all the time, the crab is so fresh and sweet! Calamari (4/5) is fine, it's not the crunchiest and I didn't detect ""pretzels"" but the dipping sauces are good. Kale salad (4/5) is quite zingy but really needs a few more elements to justify $17. Fettucine with beans and pesto (3.5/5) is just pretty boring. I liked the summer squash pizza (4/5) much better - the crust was crisped almost as if fried. I wouldn't recommend the Black sea bass (3/5) unless you are dieting... served in a too-salty clear broth like a chinese steamed fish preparation. Definitely go for some fried chicken though (5/5). It was one of my favorite things, the exterior is ULTRA crisp and light. I was also a fan of the pork chop (4.5/5), a well-cooked thick slab with classically good pairings of cherry and crispy onions. I dared not order a side vegetable again, last time our greens were literally 4 bites. Save room for dessert. A large slice of chocolate cake (5/5) is airy and bouncy; the crumbly almond cake (5/5) is surprisingly addicting; and the sundae is the salty sugary dessert bomb to satisfy sweet tooths. TLDR: a solid safe spot for taking the parents, last-min special events, and a good option in this area. You'll have a good meal, very good service, but you might forget what you ate by next week.",3
20,,7/9/2018,20,,"New York, NY",Rebecca D.,714,4.0,69,"This place was so cute! I love the atmosphere and the place settings. I love the decor, and that they have the fresh vegetables out and you can see them. Our table unanimously decided that this place was ""shabby chic.""We could only get a reservation for 6 people at 5:30pm. I called in advance the same day to see if we could get a later reservation and they told us we could come at 6 but we had to leave by 8 for the next table. I appreciated that they let us come a little later. One of our guests was not able to make it which we let them know when we revised the time of the reservation.When we did finally get there, it upset me that with a larger table of 5 that they wouldn't let us sit till the whole party was there. Who else are you going to give this table to? They also told us on the phone we had to be out by 8 for the next reservation at that table and we wanted to get started! But to no avail.  I would like to note that my table did have a weird request for the food (switching a sauce on a pasta dish) to which the kitchen graciously obliged. We really appreciated that they were willing to do this for us.Regarding service:Overall I was surprised at how slow the service was, and how infrequently we saw our server. I asked the guy that brought out our food for a few things a few times, but he had to send the waiter over. Also, after our appetizers, we had to wait a really long time for our main courses.  Regarding the food:roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, creme fraiche and citrus 17 - amazing. Perfect avocado. kale salad with lemon, serrano chilies and mint $17 - it was just a kale salad ‍Fluke crudo - was light and bright - good flavors and texture. Really enjoyed it. Pea soup - it was a lot thinner than I was expecting and was served warm. Was almost like a pea broth. I would have preferred it thicker. Pasta with peas, pesto, parmesan - was good. Ravioli- the guests at my table wanted the ravioli with the pesto sauce instead of the red sauce. They were kind enough to accommodate for us. It was actually really good with the substitution. Chocolate cake - melted chocolate ganache and toasted marshmallow icing. It was okay. The icing was more marshmallow than icing. I couldn't taste the malt at all. Overall a solid meal. I would come back.  The decor was my favorite.",

The overall taste is so refreshing! I do wish the portion is a bit bigger though. The salad is also amazing: the roasted carrots are sweet and the dressing is also spot on! Definitely one of my favorite salads in nyc. My boyfriend loved his pasta a lot, but I find it a bit too spicy and cheesy. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and is quite spacious.

23,3,5/22/2018,36,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jessica S.,100,5.0,54,I have been so far to a few Jean Georges restaurants and this is definitely one of my favorites! I shared as an appetizer-The Crab toast:  this is like a MUST to order because it's more than delicious! - The ramp and goat cheese: very crispy bread topped with wild onions (which I assume is the ramp) and a few pieces of goat cheese. Sounds simple but it's very delicious tho!- and the beets: it's very refreshing since it was also mixed with a yogurt. For the Entrees we ordered:- the Cheeseburger: okay so the meat was juicy! And I'm talking about dripping juicy. And those burger lovers will know what I'm talking about it is really yummy!! It comes also with fries (: which were crispy baked. -Ravioli: I was not really overwhelmed with it. It lacked a little bit of flavor but that's just my personally opinion -and Fettuccine: it was really good! Amazing flavors combined But I would consider this as a really heavy meal. The desserts which is of course the favorite part:-Chocolate cake: it is a huge piece of cake! But let me tell you one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had! Chocolate fan? Than this is a must order! (: -Almond cake: smaller piece. Comes with a light ice cream which almost reminded me of a sorbet and fresh strawberries. I liked the nutty crust of the cake I would almost say it tasted a little bit like Marzipan.-Rhubarb pie: this is a small personal pie. Like a whole pie. Just smaller haha. It also comes with ice cream. The pie crust very good- the rhubarb as it is sour. But all in all combined very delicious as well. I'm definitely coming back with my wife for the crab toast and to try the rest of the menu out.,1
24,6,8/8/2018,792,3,"New York, NY",Liz S.,1568,5.0,706,"ABC Kitchen is just a little too popular (and pricey) for me. However, it's the best of the ABCs and I accept that it's a vanguard of the NYC dining scene.The host at the front had excellent people skills and dealt gracefully with having to tell pretty much everyone that their tables were ""almost ready."" We waited about 15 minutes for our table on a 7:30 reservation; I maintain that the ABCs overbook their tables. Bartenders were also great and transferred our tab easily to the table. The bar area is nice, with a tastefully distressed mirror, and there were actually a decent amount of people eating in the area, though it seemed a bit noisy to me.I started with the Barrio Paloma ($16), which fits my usual love of tequila drinks, though it is on the spicy side. My other drink of the night was a glass of minutolo ($14), which was a new grape to me but delicious. It's an unbelievably cheap bottle for retail though, and one of the first time I've seen a glass over the price of a bottle!I started with the signature crab toast ($16), which had a nice pure crab flavor on a toasty bread, and a generous amount of it. The squeeze of lemon really elevates it.Black sea bass ($34) was hands down one of the best fish I've had in a restaurant. Soft flesh, crispy skin, beautiful broth. It irks me that fish is so often seen as the boring choice (and they certainly don't make it sound too exciting on the menu) when it can be so completely flavorful. Just loved this.We also had a side of broccoli rabe ($11), which had a ""fresno chili sauce"" that I mistook for pure sriricha. They actually do a great job with double whammy of the tough texture and the bitter taste that rabe typically has, but I wouldn't say you need it.Service seamless, pacing natural. The decor here is more romantic and less try-hard than the other two ABCs. Just a nice spot with a buzzing atmosphere.It's all very simple and farm-to-table in a way that feels outmoded now, and you feel a bit silly paying these prices (it was over $100 per person with 2 drink, a starter, and a main), so it's easy to discount the experience, especially given my mixed experience with V (and to a lesser extent Cocina).However, everything was excellently done. Maintaining this level of quality is difficult, and based on Yelp and people I know who come here regularly they seem to do it. I choose to round up from a 4.5.",5

Service did start off slow but our waiter became more attentive eventually. We started with the fluke, cucumber soup, goat cheese pizza, fettuccine, calamari, and crab toast. It sounds like a lot of appetizers but the portion sizes were small so we were able to order entrees as well. Everyone agreed the food tasted good but our favorites were the pizza, pasta, and crab toast. Everything did taste fresh and homemade. For entrees we got the sea bass, monkfish, and pork chops. We didn't really share but everyone enjoyed their own respected dishes. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and almond cake. Both were different and yummy in their own way. Would def recommend this place for good food and atmosphere.",

Ordered the Turkey Cuban which was nothing shy of spectacular. Always been a softy for crusty bread. Of course I had to pair that with a nice glass of white wine.,
28,,6/2/2018,18,,"San Francisco, CA",Victor D.,516,2.0,352,"Wow I came here hearing that it's really hard to get reservations and I managed to get one! Imagine how excited I am to try it.We got the crab toast, fried chicken, and crispy pork confit, and fettuccine.The crab toast, like all others have said, is the best item and you have to get it. It's basically some buttered crab on some well toasted bread. I don't think it's particularly hard to make...but it is very tasty.The fried chicken, now that was very interesting. The fried chicken itself sits on some spinach and spicy sauce, so it reminds you of southern fried chicken. What's so unique about this chicken is that it's a large piece that has no bones! How is that possible?? Well they stitch together  chicken breast and thigh to make this possible. So some part of the chicken will be more dry than the others. As for the battering, it's a very light batter. I thought this was an interesting dish, but I didn't think it was particularly good.... Note, if you are sharing this dish make sure you don't just get caught with the red meat or white meat as that makes the experience very different :DThe pork confit wasn't that special either. There are two different kinds of pork. One is the main dish, a bit on the dry side. That's probably why there's mashed potatoes around it. Then there's a more saucy/asiany style pork belly. That is very firm and also very dry. Not that great....The fettecuni was really good. I lied, this is probably my favorite dish from the meal. The pasta itself was so good, it's firm and strong and it feels so fresh. There are a lot of fresh ingredients like the pesto, peas, and other veggies.  Overall this place was a huge disappointment given how good it was supposed to be. Wouldn't recommend spending a decent amount of money here.",
29,,4/8/2018,149,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ashley V.,390,5.0,140,"Coming here really feels like a treat. The interior is so cute and cozy, the servers were attentive and the food was phenomenal. I came with a group and we were able to sample quite a few things:Cured Meats & Cheeses: I felt like this was just okay. If you're wanting some apps to share I'd probably pass on this one. Nothing was wrong with it, I just wasn't blown away.3/5Crab Toast: this was super light and delicious. Just the right amount of acidity. Would recommend.4/5Butternut Squash Toast: I think this had ricotta on it but I can't remember the type of cheese 100% (the menu recently switched and I no longer see this option.) That being said, this was by far my favorite appetizer of the night! A little sweet, a little salty, and I truly wished I didn't have to share this one with the group.5/5Tuna Sashimi w/Ginger & Mint: another huge hit. I could've eaten an entire order of this by myself. The marinade was to die for and the fish was super fresh.5/5Pretzel Calamari: a little underwhelming. You couldn't really tell the breading was pretzel (and I never would have guessed if the menu didn't say so). To be fair, I like calamari but it isn't a must order for me, so the fact that this didn't really feel special puts it lower on my list. It just seemed like regular fried calamari to me.3/5Tomato/Mozz/Basil Pizza: a classic dish done well. Everyone loved this and finished the pie with no complaints.4/5Ricotta Ravioli: someone else at my table ordered this and I was drooling over it all night. You get a fair amount of ravioli and this was definitely a nice, hearty dish.4/5Wood Oven Roasted Lobster: OH MY GOODNESS! I ordered this for my entree and I loved it so much, I could've eaten two. It's seasoned with oregano and a lemon-chili vinaigrette which made the taste really intersting, unique, and not something you'd normally expect from lobster. It was different (in a good way) and I'm totally here for it. Best lobster I've had in a long while, and it was both seasoned and cooked to perfection.6/5 Broccoli Rabe: delicious and a good way to sneak some veggies in! It had a chili sauce on it but I couldn't really taste it.3/5Mashed Potatoes: so creamy and flavorful. Order a few for the table, because everyone will want seconds.5/5Overall, I'd definitely come back here. I love that the menu is seasonal so you get to try a few new things that are fresh and in-season. Can't wait for my next ABC dining experience.",2

The decor is tastefully done. Lot of space as well.However do make a reservation before you go in. Ordered roast carrot and avocado salad along with pesto fettuccine. Everything was very flavorful. One of the best meals I had. Portion sizes were ok. If you are hungry order the dinner portions. Servers are well informed and would ask for our preferences to recommend items from the menu. We were done in less than 2 hours. Everything was perfect.Definitely coming back here again!!,2

Updated review",2265,1,"Manhattan, NY",Jaimee A.,649,2.0,1601,"This restaurant needs a serious menu change!We have been here multiple times and this time it didn't thrill. The service was friendly and the space was beautiful but the food..... Meh.We had:- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - Good.  When we initially saw this, we were surprised it was still on the menu after all this time, after the rest of the meal we were glad it was there.- Cured Meats and Local Cheese - Meats were good, cheeses were so so. One of them was so ammoniated that I mentioned it to the waitress. She said the chef told her ""it was supposed to be."" Seriously? We have eaten at Artisanal and Picholine, places with amazing cheese courses. Ammoniated is not something you strive for. It means the cheese has sat too long and is past its prime.- Roasted Beets with Yogurt - Tasty- Mushroom, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - Yuck! We have had it before and it was very good. This time it was ridiculously loaded with what tasted like boiled mushrooms. Last time, it had a good amount of mushrooms, but this was insane. There was no parmesan and very little egg. It tasted like boiled mushrooms. - Roasted Acorn Squash - Could have been good, but every third mouthful had a very strong spice that burned our mouths.- Almond Cake - Good but basic.This was a disappointing dining experience and I don't think we will be back.",16
32,,8/17/2018,49,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Anusha T.,28,4.0,52,It is an absolute delight to dine here every time! I came here to get a quick lunch with my husband. The place is rustic and inviting. I love how the food translates into the space. It is interconnected and makes sense. We had a reservation and were shown to our tables promptly. Our host was very polite and answered all the questions I had for him. We got started of with a basil lemon soda and a gin based cocktail. They were very good. We got the heirloom tomatoes and the cucumber coconut soup which was also very fresh and rustic. For the entrees we got the salmon and the veggie burger. The salmon however was a little overdone and the veggie burger was decent. We ended our meal with an almond panna cotta which was perfect. This is a place to come to get a meal which focuses on making the fresh market produce shine.,
33,,5/6/2018,96,,"New York, NY",Elei Z.,419,4.0,71,"Food good, service terrible. The place is big and can get crowded and noisy, so it gets loud. The tables are pretty tightly packed together, but hey, it's new york. The service is way too slow. They need to be more productive and efficient. Or maybe the problem is too few staff. I don't know. But as a customer, I was continually frustrated by the super slow and inattentive service.One time, I ordered the lobster & egg. And then they brought out a completely different dish because they didn't have the lobster dish anymore. The problem was they didn't let me know. Instead they charged me for an egg dish I never meant to order. They should've let me know beforehand so that I could've replaced it with something else or just cancelled the dish. They often made mistakes with our drinks. Got the wrong drink at lunch, asked for the right drink and it just never came. A different time for dinner, a similar situation happened - we got the wrong drinks and we also randomly got drinks we never ordered...  they really need to step it up. It's a pity because I like the food but just can't stand the service. The food's always delightful - doesn't seem to matter what you get off the menu,. For brunch, I especially enjoyed the calamari. The sauce was  sweet and the calamari was light and crispy. Many times when I get calamari (at various places), it always comes too oily and either too soft or too hard. The pieces are usually too large and not sufficiently bite sized. And the calamari is often times too chewy. But at ABC Kitchen, it was delicate but with a satisfying crunch. The french toast was also very good. Very fluffy and egg-y and soft. I thought it was a little too sweet though. But overall, great french toast. The egg looks pretty plain - after all, it's just egg. But it was so good. Every bite was a burst of flavor.",

The menu here does not change that often. The food here is good. Every dish that was ordered was delicious and flavorful but the portions is not that big. The pricing is also a bit on the higher side for these small portions. Good place to check out but you might want to limit the amount of visits to the restaurant.,

This dish combined fresh pasta with tasty nuts. I highly recommend it. For my main, I went with the pork confit accompanied by bacon. It was pure porcine perfection! The confit preparation results in tender,  moist pork, a meat which in lesser restaurants can be in danger of tasting dry.",1

The dressing was very citrusy and just tart enough to compliment, but not overwhelm the fish.  Bibb Salad was even better - the dressing is tart and spicy with Tarragon, I really loved it.  Nice tender lettuces and the chicken paillard was shockingly lightly grilled and juicy.  My only regret is that I could not indulge in any of the delicious looking cocktails which I saw some (lucky) folks indulging in. Next time I will come back when I am not on a business lunch and can indulge, the cocktails looks like they take a similar approach to fresh ingredients as the food.",3

42,1,6/24/2018,180,1,"New York, NY",Amrita A.,726,3.0,220,"On entering ABC Kitchen, the vibe and the decor totally and completely grip you in. The interiors are chic and the servers are attentive, and the place itself is almost always buzzing busily. I am a loyal patron of Jean Georges restaurants, and I love ABC cocina, so naturally I had very high expectations of my first visit to ABC kitchen.  On a Sunday evening, we had to wait 30 minutes for our table which wasn't so bad. Between the four of us we ordered-Chicken Liver Patè on toast- the flavor was incredible but unfortunately I bit into a sharp piece of plastic while eating it and the server was very apologetic and gracious enough to admit to there being a mistake and to strike it off the bill. We also got a few complimentary sides to make up for this incident.For the complimentary sides we got-  fries, peas and mashed potatoes. I must say that the peas were the best tasting peas I have ever had. Having said that, ABC Kitchen has stellar produce which is sourced fresh and organic and one can taste that in the food too. The fries were nice as well.For mains we ordered-Fried chicken with collard greens- this was the best dish of the night. I have not had better fried chicken and collard greens any where, and I have eaten quite a few. The presentation was beautiful as well.Roasted Carrot Salad with goats cheese and avocado- I loved everything about it. The carrots were definitely the hero of the dish.Grilled Sea Bass- very average. The fish wasn't seasoned well and had a slight smell to it. Unfortunately, I was quite underwhelmed by this dish.Salmon- this too was nothing spectacular.Overall, I realized that the vegetables really do shine in the dishes and it's easy to see why ABC kitchen prides itself in its produce. But having said that, I don't think I would be so eager to return any time soon.",3
43,,11/13/2018,27,,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",Cheryl K.,5,1.0,15,"TL;DR: Double check your bill! They added $2-3 extra to EACH DISH on the bill, without saying anything. Don't know how long they've been doing this and how much extra money they've made.I've been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for the longest time, and I finally got to last night. The food was as good as I expected it to be, the ambiance was romantic, and the servers were friendly. However, last night's experience only deserves 1 star and here's why:Our table reservation for 8 people at 9pm wasn't available until 9:30. For a restaurant that asks for a credit card on file for a party larger than 5, you'd think that they would be more prepared to seat such a big party; thus, we got 2 complimentary ricotta squash toast for the table. The biggest problem lies after dinner. When we got the bill, I saw that my sea bass was $36, $3 more than what it was priced on the menu. Then my friends checked their orders and we realized all our orders were $2-3 more than what the menu stated. We were also charged for the ""complimentary squash toast"" and a beer that we never ordered. If I hadn't caught that mistake, we would've paid an extra $56, not including tax and tip. ABC Kitchen's reasoning was that they changed the pricing of the food on the POS system but not on their physical menu that they give to costumers. They honored the price that was printed but they should have mentioned the price change or updated their menu. I don't know how long they've been doing this and how much they've scammed from their customers.",

Highlights: tuna, crab toast, sea bass, the Broccolini side and THE BURGER.Drinks were made perfectly too!Knocking a star because we kept asking ourselves, is this food really delicious or did they just overseason and add a lot of salt?

45,,7/13/2018,102,,"Mineola, NY",Merisa H.,60,4.0,68,"I went to ABC kitchen for dinner with some friends. The place has a really cool vibe. It is rustic-chic, with dim lighting and a cozy feel. It would be a great place for a date. We started with a bottle of rose at the counter top by the window, while we waited for out table to be ready.  The rose was perfect after the humidity that was present that day.When we were seated, they brought bread. The bread was cold and stiff. It was pretty hard to chew through, so I would pass on this. Wait for the food itself! For starters we got the ricotta, tuna, and roasted beets. All were super fresh. You could actually taste each ingredient in its perfect form. The ricotta was my favorite! It is housemate and came with a sweet berry sauce. It was just overall incredible! But I loved all three of these things, so I would recommend all (but the ricotta is a must-get).We also had the goat cheese pizza, the roasted carrot salad, and the fried string beans. The goat cheese pizza was a little too charred for my liking, and it didn't have enough goat cheese. It was mostly kale and red pepper flake. The roasted carrot salad was delicious! Very light and refreshing. The string beans were also delightful, a bit greasy, but overall great.We also had the infamous popcorn Sunday for dessert (I had to get it after everyone talked about it on here). It was very disappointing. It was just bland and nothing special. The popcorn was also a little stale. I would pass on this, despite what you may have heard!Overall, great place. Get the ricotta!",1

This was a good idea because when we arrived it filled to the brink.  When I first arrived, only part of the group was there but they let us get seated before the whole group, what a nice privilege! The decor of abc kitchen was unique and chic (I think that's how you use that word).  The flowers on each table were new daily and it was the little things like that which sets this restaurant apart from your average lunch/dinner spot; the details.  What I ordered was: Butternut Squash soup, Seared Salmon on a bibb salad, and seasonal cookie plate. While we waited for our order, they brought out a sourdough bread which was cold (I am not sure why it was not toasted or put in an oven) and oil. It was actually find of funny, he poured the oil in a little plate and waiter was even impressed with his pour! The food:Butternut Squash Soup: absolutely incredible.  The actual temp of the soup was probably 10 degrees too hot so I needed to wait for it to cool down but I couldn't stop myself, I burnt my tongue twice! The sea salt with whatever nut combined with the creme fraiche (dollop of sour cream) was just a combination I was not mentally prepared for.  I am not sure it would fill me up but if I could, I would want to eat this soup weekly till I was put 6 feet underground.Seared Salmon with bibb salad: Easily the best salmon I have ever had in my 22 years on this earth. I got my cooked medium well which meant that it was fully cooked in the middle but before they served it, they put it on a stove of oil and made it crunchy which unbelievable. Then it comes to the bibb salad (that means that they take giant leaves of lettuce and that is the green part) with cut avocado in tiny pieces with thinly sliced carrots and radishes.  The dressing had kick but also sweet. The combination of salad with the salmon was too much for me. I could not handle the flavors, it was TOO good! When I asked my friends about it, we each thought we could eat this piece of salmon with the dressing every day till we died; what a piece of salmon! Cookie Plate: pretty average. You got a chocolate chip, shortbread with apricot in the middle, sugar cookie and some weird one with a jam in it.  I will say, you can see the picture of the Lemon tart and I think that dessert was the best! Something about lemon tart with a nice crust that makes my mouth water! Overall: The abc restaurants are incredible and during restaurant week they are a steal for the quality and the service! They changed our plates and sliverware between courses which I was impressed by! The type of plates were different for all of us and that was the final touch to a wonderful meal!

The food is fresh and delicious, and I love the combinations of things. The different menus are all good regardless of what meal you're going for -- but I've mostly been for lunch though, so I'd say go for the pasta and/or the burger when available. Also love love their fries and their seafood special is also always good.The restaurant have a great selection of wine as well and honestly if you're dining with a party, just get a bottle, it makes more sense, cost-wise. And speaking of costs, yes, it's more expensive than a lot of places even for NYC - but if you want a fresh, delicious meal that is above average cost, definitely recommend.

Fried chicken: Light and crispy seasoned batter with juicy and tender breast served with a spicy butter.  It's delicious - make sure you dig in as soon as it is served as it's best when hot and fresh from the kitchen!  The accompanying sauteed chard is a perfect complement to the fried chicken.  2. Crab toast: If you are a crab lover, this is a must-try.  Topped with a very generous portion of fresh lump crabmeat and a tangy refreshing lemon aioli.  A great starter and perfect for sharing - unless you are like me and love crab.  Then order at least 2 servings.3. Black Sea Bass: Tender sea bass seared to absolute perfection with a hint of basil and spice from the slices of jalapeno on top.  The accompanying sauteed spinach was a perfect pairing - light, silky, and savory.  The side of seasoned and simultaneously crispy and tender roasted potatoes completed the dish . 4. Buttermilk cheddar biscuits: Absolutely delicious - buttery and flaky with the perfect amount of cheddar.  If you thought that Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits are good - you have not tried these.5. Pretzel-crusted calamari: I couldn't actually taste the pretzel flavor in the crust but that aside, the calamari itself is quite tender and good with an extra salt kick (maybe that is from the pretzel crust?).  The mustard and tomato aioli add a nice spicy kick.",1

Around 2:45pm I went back to the host desk to ask if there was a server assigned to our section as we wanted water and menus. Shortly thereafter, we were greeted with menus and water and I asked to speak with a manager. She came over and I informed her about the wait. Her response was: ""We know."" No apology or anything!Eventually we were able to give a server our order. 3 house cocktails and the squash toast and crab toast to start, followed by the  carrot and avocado salad with chicken, the fried oysters and eggs and the burger cooked medium for our entrees.The appetizers arrived before the drinks. The burger  arrived well done and had to be sent back. Otherwise the food was tasty and up to their usual standards. The second burger arrived cooked to medium and shortly after, our server dropped off a carrot and avocado salad to ""keep us busy while we waited for the burger."" It seemed so strange to offer a dish that was already on the table and the timing was clearly far off. The gesture was appreciated though as it was the first acknowledgement that anyone who worked there had made to our poor service. We had it wrapped to go since we already had one at the table.We ordered another round of drinks and the sundae and cookie plate for dessert. Eventually, since each interaction with anyone took ages, we paid in full for our meal. At that point, there was almost no one left in the restaurant but things still seemed to take forever to get done.I've been going to ABC kitchen, Cocina and ABCV for years and have celebrated birthdays, anniversaries etc. there. I used to look forward to ""wow-ing"" visitors there but sadly, it seems the customer service has taken such a turn for the worst that I doubt I will return again. 2 stars for the chef. Zero for the service. At around $100 per person, I expect much better.",

We really enjoyed all the dishes here. Very simple flavors and you don't feel overly stuffed after your meal. It's nice to see a high end restaurant with a lighter fare. We tried the Black sea bass, salmon and pork dishes. All awesome. The Beet Salad was also good but pricey for what it was. Ended the meal with a Rhubarb and strawberry pie that was amazing!

My friend had the ravioli which was one of the best ravioli she ever had. We both got the smaller portion and regretted it. The more, the better. Then we ordered all the desserts (except for the fruit plate). The popcorn sundae was our first choice. Salty, sweet, perfect. The chocolate cake was delicious but too rich for most of us. The cookie plate was solid. All in all, we had an amazing time and we can't wait to come back.",
55,,9/22/2018,36,,"New York, NY",Joel S.,14,4.0,640,"Met up with two other couples at ABC kitchen for dinner.  The space is big, dark and interesting.  It's a bit loud, but the loudness helps isolate people in this festive space.  The waitstaff were uniformly excellent (and attractive).  We started off with some really good bread and olive oil.  Cocktails were on point, though my martini was brought on the rocks instead of up.  They're poured tableside, which I really like.  My main complaint about ABC Kitchen is the rapaciously priced wine list.  Even the obscure wines are expensive.  It's a challenge to find a good bottle of wine for under $100.  IMHO, every restaurant should offer a reasonable bottle of wine for $50 or $60 and let people who want to splurge do so.Rant over- on to the food.  The famous carrot salad was delicious.  The crab toast was very good, but mayonnaise heavy.  The fried calamari was perfectly cooked.  We split a bacon and clam pizza as an appetizer.  Unless you're a rabbi, how can you improve on this?  The crust was light, but firm and chewy.  Main courses were all well received.  The salmon was delicious. I had the monkfish which was excellent, but the portion was small.  Everybody who ordered a healthy entree were drooling over the diner who ordered the burger. He dropped out of the dinner conversation in order to concentrate fully on scarfing it down.  I know that Pete Wells is down on sundaes as desserts because they're a cop out, but I highly recommend the excellent one served here.  It's salted caramel ice cream, fudge, nuts, caramel and a bit of whipped cream.  Just typing that made me smile.Great restaurant, but not perfect- 4.5 stars.  A festive place to have a really good meal.",

Everything from the food to the service has always been phenomenal. However, this particular experience was so good it's already had me planning for the next time I'll be able to dine here again!Our party of 4 walked in on a Friday evening at around 7:15 PM. Since we didn't have a reservation we were told that we could be seated immediately at the restaurant's communal table or wait until about 9 PM until an actual table opened up. We opted for the communal table, but were also told that since we were a party of four it was likely no one else would be seated at that table with us, which ended up happening! Regardless, definitely be sure to make a reservation if you're looking to dine here for any meal of the day. ABC Kitchen itself emulates a posh french countryside estate (in my mind). Set up with white tables and chairs, along with plants strewn across the space, it definitely gives off nature vibes while still being extremely romantic. Small candlelight's on the table also make this a must for a special date night. When it came time to order our party started with the Housemade Ricotta with Rhubarb and Grilled Bread ($15), along with the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli ($16). Both appetizers were beautifully prepared and extremely flavorful. You can't go wrong if you order any of these for yourself.When it came time to order our entrees, I ended up choosing the Crispy Pork Confit with Smoked Bacon, Marmalade, and Braised Turnips ($36). This dish really blew it out of the park for me. The pork confit was cooked PERFECTLY. A hearty portion that was also organized well with the other items on the plate. The marmalade added sweet notes to the dish, while the turnips also increased the variety of flavors I indulged in that night. All in all this is a MUST if you're on the fence, or indecisive about what to order.For dessert we ordered the Rhubarb Pie with White Chocolate Ice Cream ($14) and the Chocolate Creme Brulee with Blood Orange Sorbet and Hazelnut ($12). The pie itself was alright, but what really stood out was the creme brulee. Warm from beginning to end, each bite was just as good as the last. The only thing that that left me disappointed was the portion size, but this also may be due to how fast our party devoured this particular dessert. :)Overall this was a great experience from beginning to end, especially since we walked in without a reservation. The servers and staff were hospitable and accommodating from the moment we arrived. I'd definitely put ABC Kitchen on your map if you're looking for the perfect dimly-lit date spot or somewhere to celebrate a special occasion. You can be sure that this restaurant won't disappoint.",1
58,5,10/3/2017,860,2,"New York, NY",Molly T.,1415,4.0,443,"Even non-foodies know about ABC Kitchen. The ABC enterprise is a total juggernaut in the city. Whether you're lusting after Tibetan art at ABC Carpet & Home or drooling over clean, organic eats at any of the ABC restaurants, you're probably swooning over something here. The sheer number of reviews for ABC Kitchen almost makes me want to save my energy because I'm guessing that most things one could say about this place have already been documented here. But as evidence by that painful run-on sentence, I'm going to take a stab at writing ABC Kitchen up, too. It was a long-awaited trip and the food was delightful. It didn't wow me in the way that I was expected to be wowed, but my expectations were comically high. So considering that, I'm satisfied. We came here at around 8:30 on a Saturday night. And yes, for a primetime reservation like that, you'll need to book pretty far out. It's worth it, just to get the full ambiance of this place. I had already been to ABCv before dining at ABC Kitchen so was already familiar with the general aesthetic at all things ABC, but this was still a treat. Simultaneously trendy, warm, natural/earthy, elegant. Take a lap if you can while you're waiting for your noms to arrive. In addition to a superb wine list, ABC Kitchen has a good selection of cocktails. I get giddy ordering cocktails at the Jean-Georges establishments because I feel like the relative healthfulness of the drinks cancel out the fact that I'm drinking poison. There are always some fruit and veggie components, which is not the norm of mixed drinks. Nowadays I mostly drink wine (I ordered wine with dinner ultimately), but I made an exception for Carrotini here. Vodka-based, carrot, ginger, lime. I'm a health nut and this felt like a proper Juice Press shot--making me twice as happy because it also helped with the whole inebriation thing. The drinking experience was slightly tainted, though. The cocktail took about 30 minutes to arrive. The bartender did pour it in front of us which was a nice touch, but the flair was lost on me given how impatient I had become at that point. My glass of wine ""with dinner"" also didn't pan out so well. Our waiter was emphatic that the Sancerre would pair well with one of our mains (the bass--more on that in a moment), which I factored into my decision-making process. Unfortunately, the wine didn't arrive until long after we were served said main. It was tasty, but tardy. The food here is as advertised. Fresh and organic, clean flavors, healthy and interesting. Nothing wildly creative but all well-executed. We ended up splitting one of the smaller bites, one appetizer and two mains. It was just barely enough food--I was expecting the mains to be bigger, so we could've managed with one more app. Can't have too much FOMO, though. Our eats, below:  Crab toast with lemon aioli: AThe famous crab toast! I was expecting to have my world rocked, and that didn't quite happen. But man, this was still so very good. That lemon aioli on top was key. And as is usually the case with powerhouse toast appetizers (I've had many), I was very sad when it was over. I'll just order 4-6 of these and call it a meal. Roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: AThis is the first week it's really been feeling like fall, and this felt like a great transition. Summery with the avo, autumn-y with the carrot. Simply roasted, very warming. Liked the pepitas on top--added some lovely texture. Would've liked a tad more sour cream, but that's just me being nit-picky. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach: AFresh and delicious. Nothing particularly notable but I love sea bass so I was happy with a perfectly-cooked piece of fish atop some yummy spinach. Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips: A/A+This dish was a lot smaller than expected (they advertised it as being a sizable plate) but otherwise, a sublime combo of ingredients--very well thought-out. The smoke bacon marmalade was pure crap and the greens underneath were super flavorful and held the sauce nicely. I very rarely eat mashed potatoes (I know I know, so sue me) but these were a worthy addition as well. Creamy and rich. Definitely our most decadent dish of the night, but not uncomfortably heavy.",6

We came here on a Friday evening and it was packed, lots of people for date night, friends enjoying Friday night drinks, families out for celebratory dinners, just a beautiful place to be at. Our server was very attentive and we started out with the crab toast, which everyone seems to talk about. I did love the crab but our actual was a little on the burnt side which I didn't love. We then shared one of their amazing pizzas with a million mushrooms, it was definitely on the unique side and we enjoyed that. Then as stuffed as we were after drinks and appetizers, I knew we needed to get some dessert and something told me to get their chocolate cake. Honestly I didn't love it and I wish we had the popcorn sundae dessert instead because that's the dessert to get here apparently.

The appetizers to begin with were delicious. My favorite was the crab toast! I wish there was more, but I'll definitely be back to eat it again. All the entrees were tasty, but hard to share since they would give one entree to share between 4-5 people so we would have to figure a way to divide a sandwich and burger. Last, but not least the salted caramel popcorn ice cream was a nice sweet savory flavor and the popcorn added a perfect crunch texture. Will be back for that too!",

We also had the calamari, the roast carrot and avocado salad, and the line caught tuna sashimi. Everything we ate was flavorful, beautifully presented, and came out relatively quickly as well.

This was a horrible experience. From the moment I sat down and was served Luke warm water, it started downhill. I'm an older guy & a few different people came by and I understood very little because it sounded like whispers. I let my son do the ordering & most of what we ordered was recommended by the waiter. The fried calimari appetizer was very small in size and not heated up well. The beat soup had unidentifiable spices that my wife and I thought was disgusted with out the sweetnesses of beats. My wife and son had the sea bass which was supposedly a specialty of the house and tasted very ordinary. I had Monk fish consisting of 2 tiny pieces finished with 4 very small bites and was not worth $190. The inside of the place was attractive.

71,3,7/6/2018,9,,"Rye, NY",H L.,169,5.0,37,"ABC Kitchen's decor is full of contrasts, quirky and fun in many ways yet somehow manages to be trendy and chic at the same time. For example its bare concrete walls in the main dining area are unpainted, with exposed pipes and wirings overhead. On those same ceilings hung some fabulously intricate chandeliers. Strategically placed throughout the restaurant are art sculptures crafted from branches of trees and continuing the wood theme, bar tables carved out from the trunks of trees. In the dining area, modish white tables and chairs are employed. This juxtaposition of styles extended to its tableware, with the restaurant using mismatched vintage floral chintzy plates and a line of distinctly white tableware. After taking in the artistic flair of our surroundings, we turned our attention to the menu and ordered the Crab Toast to start. They were delicious - generous portions of fresh crabmeat on slices of warm toast dabbed with olive oil. Not surprisingly, the wedges of lemon on the side were left untouched. We eschewed traditional brunch favourites and instead chose two fish entrees. The first was Roasted Hake with fava beans & artichoke hearts in a spring garlic-lemon broth. The hake had a wonderful crispy finish but the flesh within was very tender, with a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. The inclusion of fava beans was unusual, but they complemented the fish and garlicky broth very well.  Our second choice, Black Sea Bass with chilies, spinach and basil was equally stellar. The sea bass was seared to perfection, its firm sweet flesh exuded a hint of basil possibly from the judicious addition of basil oil. Sautéed spinach leaves provided layers of silkiness while a few slices of pickled jalapeño peppers atop contributed a touch of heat to this dish. Would recommend getting a side of Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar Biscuits. These were absolutely scrumptious, buttery and flaky with a lovely salty tang. So impressed were we by the food we ate thus far, that despite being quite full, we couldn't possibly pass up the offer of dessert. We got the Sundae to share. The salted caramel ice cream was fairly regular, except this scoop was lying in a most delightful pool of chocolatey caramel hot fudge sauce with candied peanuts & popcorn and a dollop of freshly whipped cream as toppings. Full marks for taste and presentation!",5

It looks like a garden with all the small white tables and big round wooden tables, given the fact that it is right next to ABC home & carpet. My friend and I came here for lunch, and we ordered crab toast with lemon aioli, squash pizza, and bibb salad with seared salmon. The waiter recommended their burger and sandwich, but it was a little too much for two girls. The portion size was big. We finished the crab toast and the salad, but only ate half of the pizza because we were too full. The crab toast was incredible. I am not a big fan of seafood, but the crab did not taste seafood-y at all because of the lemon aioli. The crab meat was shredded and cooked, and the toast was crunchy but not overly crunchy that it would cut your tongue. There were two lemons on the side in case you need more acid. I squeezed them and they brought out the flavor of lemon aioli and freshness of crab. Although there were lots of meat, $16 was still a lot for an appetizer. The pizza I had is no longer on the menu. It was a thin crust pizza with two types of squash, ricotta, and some chili flakes. It looked like it was cooked in a wood oven due to the charred crust. The ricotta tasted a little like goat cheese to me. The chili flakes added a bit spiciness to the pizza, which was great because I love spicy food. It also added more flavor to the squash. The salad was assorted fresh vegetables with dressing (unfortunately I don't remember the dressing). The vegetables are all organic produce from local farms. It is ABC Kitchen's mission to support these farms and encourage healthy-eating with best ingredients possible. The salmon was decent, not impressive. My overall experience was great and I would go back again for dinner. The price was a little high. Three dishes cost $65 before tax and tips. Though it is reasonable for a restaurant under Jean Georges management. This place is perfect for larger groups because they have big round tables.

I ordered from RW menu, but my date ordered a black bass entree from the regular menu. raw fluke for appetizers: this was OK. The aesthetic of this dish was dull and unimpressive. It's simply white on a plate that looked like a paper plate. Taste-wise, it was ok. The horseradish with the fish tasted a bit like eating sushi but with an extra punch.portobello burger for entree: the first bite was delicious. The portobello was juicy and the sauce was awesome. The inner part was extremely SALTY to the extreme that it was bitter. Black bass (non-RW): the black bass had crispy skin but the spinach was inedible. It was so salty that we had to send it back. Worse yet, the new fish she got was significantly smaller than the initial one. The sundae with caramel ice cream was delicious, but they overdid it with too much fudge. It was way too sweet as you scoop to the bottom of the sundae.  Tl;Dr food was salty and they screwed up on the details. I am especially harsh on this restaurant considering its reputation.

I had to ask everyone 1-2x and when I could, him, for butter, bread, water, sharp knife for meat, where our appetizer was (came out same time as dinner), to clear our plates, clean the table, the check. Food was fine. Nothing spectacular. Two big notes: both the lighting was low and the volume was very loud in the restaurant. I could not even see my food and what I was eating. I think Edison bulbs are cool too. But I have to see my food. I didn't sign up for blind dining. It took away from any enjoyment or  ambiance.",1

ABC kitchen blends casual and classy in a perfect manner, with food and service well worth writing home about.We came here for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was quite packed. The first thing you notice is the rustic chic decor of the place, with loads of unfinished wood and staff in flannel shirts. We had a reservation but spent a few of minutes at the bar while they got our table ready. Food here is a great example of 'farm to table' with some really innovative dishes. We started out with a complimentary salad that had some great roasted carrots in it. For our appetizer we got the crab toast, which was super fresh and tasty! The lemon aioli really adds a bright zing to the flaky crabmeat, and the toast is perfectly crusty. For our mains, we had the crispy pork confit and the fettuccine with basil-pistachio pesto. The pasta was good, perfectly cooked with a fresh flavorful pesto with the caramelized brussels sprouts adding a textural and flavor contrast to the dish. The pork confit was a standout dish! Perfectly sweet and smoky on a bed of creamy braised turnips, this is a must-try here For dessert we ordered the chocolate creme brulee which was rich and creamy and perfectly complemented by the tart and fresh blood orange sherbet. And because it was my wife's birthday, they got us a complimentary little chocolate cupcake with a candle in it - which was one of the richest little bites of chocolate cake I've eaten in a long time!Service wise we had no complaints, friendly and attentive and they did not put a foot wrong throughout our dinner. I really appreciated that they made sure to handle my request for a nice table. Highly recommended.",

However the only reason for giving it four stars was because the service was EXTREMELY slow. It took forever for our food to come out between courses and it was odd because everyone else around us was finishing their dinner a lot faster than us. The food was very good but I had to take a star off for the service.,1
89,2,7/7/2017,97,,"Washington, DC",Anna K.,190,5.0,69,"Delicious food, and a killer vibe -- Jean-Georges does it again with ABC Kitchen.Located in the Flatiron District, ABC Kitchen is famed Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's answer to locally-sourced, organic cuisine. The trendy, yet casually-chic venue (located inside ABC Carpet & Home) makes for the perfect setting to enjoy some of the best food in NYC.My boyfriend and I went to ABC Kitchen on a Friday night for his birthday dinner. I had made reservations well in advance, and we were seated promptly upon our arrival at 8 PM. Although I had requested a quiet table (thanks to the advice from other Yelp reviews), it wasn't particularly quiet. Still--the loud noise is just part of ABC Kitchen's vibe, and we proceeded to make the best of the situation.While the restaurant was beautifully decorated, and the service was pleasant (we had no complaints about our waitress or service whatsoever); the real star of ABC Kitchen is simple: it's the food. Because SO many menu items sounded and looked SO good (some of those pictures on Yelp are just drool-worthy!), we opted to share a few dishes, instead of just ordering our own. More specifically, we started with the 'Roasted Beets with Housemade Yogurt', continued with the 'Mushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm egg Whole Wheat Pizza', and then moved on to the 'Black Sea Bass with Chilies and Herbs, Baby Market Potatoes and Spinach.' Finally, after a little birthday cupcake, we concluded the night by sharing the famous 'Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Candied Peanuts & Popcorn, Whipped Cream, Hot Fudge.' Everything was just AMAZING -- it was one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC -- and I don't think I'll ever stop dreaming about that Mushroom Pizza! :) In addition to dinner, ABC Kitchen also serves lunch, and brunch on the weekends. While I have yet to experience those meals, I have no doubt they're FANTASTIC, as well.The restaurant's been a hot spot for 7+ years, and it's still going strong. Reservations can be difficult to get on short notice (especially for weekend nights) -- so if you want to ensure you can get a table at a good time, go ahead and plan your trip to ABC Kitchen well in advance. Trust me, you WILL NOT regret it! The only REAL issue is making the plan to return to ABC Kitchen, once again! :)",4

Cheese and meat platter - can't go wrong here2. Carrots and avocado salad - interesting combo 3. Crab toast- suppose to be amazing but was meh 4. Burger - would not recommend 5. Sea bass- slightly plain but was my favorite of the night6. Fried chicken- not impressed after getting the fried chicken at Roister in Chicago 7.  Side of mushroom- OK  8. Side of asparagus- had a lot of flavor for being asparagus... 9. Popcorn ice cream - definitely recommend Cozy and trendy atmosphere. Appears to be a good date night spot.,3

We had the fried chicken and mash potatoes. The mash potatoes were a la carte which is fine and typical at fine dining establishments. They just weren't that great so it was like why aren't these just included? The chicken was  juicy and crispy but again, nothing out of this world. The blueberry pie and ice cream were  delicious.

Appetizers arrived in a timely manner and were delicious however once we finished them, we waited almost an hour for our entrees.  About 45 minutes into our wait, we were given another appetizer on the house, heirloom tomato toast, which was also great, and told that the kitchen was a bit backed up.  Finally, our entrees arrived.  Mushroom pizza with parmesan, oregano and farm egg.  This was pretty good, with no shortage of mushrooms.  The farm egg was small and yolk was popped (not sure if that was intentional).  Not bad.Then our pasta dish was the angel hair with saffron, golden garlic, jalapeños, herbs and fresh ricotta.  This was a huge let down.  The angel hair was clumped together and cold.  The fresh ricotta was clumpy and none of the flavors really came together.  Our experience at ABC Kitchen started off great and slowly went downhill.  I'm not sure what caused the backup in the kitchen considering the restaurant didn't look as busy but it seemed as if the pasta was ready to go 30 minutes before the pizza.  Definitely an oversight on someone's end.",2

Apparently we have similar taste buds because we picked the exact same meal. We had the butternut squash soup, salmon, and chocolate cake for dessert. The soup was amazing. I'm not a fav of butternut squash when it's served too sweet, this was not at all. It was savory, and the crunchy pumpkin seeds were such a nice touch. The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the dill sauce, radishes, and cucumbers were so complimentary. I LOVED the salmon, still thinking about it!And the chocolate cake was pure heaven. I typically don't gravitate toward chocolate because it can be too rich for my taste, but this was so so so good. I couldn't finish the piece, but I wanted to! It was so soft and moist (sorry moist haters) and the marshmallows and mini malt balls were so yummy. To top it off, the atmosphere is gorgeous. The wait staff were lovely and very attentive. We had such a wonderful lunch and I can't wait to come back and bring my husband.",

We ended up snagging a last minute reservation for 5:30, and it wasn't crowded at all. Even when we left at 7, the restaurant wasn't jam packed. The decor is cool, kind of rustic modern. The food itself was absolutely phenomenal. We had the fluke starter, the roasted carrot and avocado salad, and the pork confit with a side of sautéed hemp greens. It was a bit light, but neither of us were starving. If you come in very hungry, one appetizer and one main per person should be enough. The fluke had such interesting flavors. The horseradish wasn't overpowering and went nicely with the lemon and oil. The roasted carrots had a delicious vinaigrette. I just wish that salad had had a few more seeds. The pork confit was out of this world -- melt in your mouth, and a great combination of smoky and sweet. The sautéed hemp greens were buttery and crispy.

It was not super comfortable, but I wasn't about to starve :)The food here was okay. The aesthetics here were awesome (and perhaps some of their choices were borrowed from the marketplace they're inside of).What we ordered:1. Crab toast with lemon aioli - this may have been a bit overhyped because though it was good, it was not life changing (like what I seemed to have expected).2. Goat cheese omelette - this was delicious!3. French toast - I actually didn't particularly like the french toast here, it was... too sweet for me.

From the outside it doesn't seem much but the interior design was charming and aesthetically pleasing. The mood was perfect for a date or group gathering. The spacing between the tables allowed conversations without overhearing other tables. The music in the background did not overpower.The hospitality exceeded my expectations. To start off, our waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu and offered adjustments to our needs. When taking orders or pouring wine, he always served the ladies around the table first. They were very professional in making sure the table was clean without interrupting our dinner. I must say that this was literally one of the best services I've had in NYC.Now to the food: Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast (5/5) - GET THIS!!! The sweet squash and soft ricotta melted perfectly together it was like heaven in your mouth. I'm still dreaming about it. Crab Toast (4/5) - Seems like a favorite but I preferred the Kabocha. There was a thin layer of crab topped with an addictive lemon aoli. Very good.Crispy Pork Confit (5/5) - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I don't know what they did to the pork but it was so tender and flavorful. The whole dish was comforting and everyone loved it. Angel Hair Pasta (3.5/5) - We ordered a full size and sadly it looked like an appetizer. The garlic oil was so damn good but the pasta itself was overcooked. Sea bass (2/5) - This dish fell short for me. For $34 I was expecting at least 3oz of sea bass but it was so small. The fish was cooked perfectly but was underseasoned. It sat in this light lemon like sauce not too much of my liking. Plain and boring. Stay away. Mushroom pizza (3.5/5) - Average. The ingredients were fresh and the egg was a great touch. The paper thin crust had a great texture but did not hold up the heavy toppings. This was the least memorable dish of the night.Salted caramel sundae (3/5) - The only dish of the night that came large enough to share but wasn't so spectacular. It was something you can easily put together yourself at home. I'd say skip it. I would most definitely return. My only complaint is that the portion of the food was extremely small.

We both had the eggs Benedict, which were excellent, with lots of generous ham and a small portion of large cut home fries on the side. They have an interesting menu of brunch cocktails and a variety of sodas made in house. I had to try the apple ginger, which was a not-too-sweet fizzy delight. My friend's Paloma was well made and was rimmed with lavender salt, which was a fun touch. I didn't see coffee on the menu, but they have both regular and decaf, which were excellent and served in old fashioned real silver services, and were $4 each. For dessert, the cookie plate really caught my eye, especially the rose sugar cookie since I love anything rose flavored. Sadly, it tasted just like a regular sugar cookie with no rose flavor whatsoever. But, the rest of the treats were great. I especially liked the mallomar and the lemon cookie. Be sure to wander through the restaurant into the store portion, called ABC Home.

It's a beautiful layout and when you step inside you forget you're in the middle of a crazy city. My friend and I did the prix fixe lunch, and for $30ish it was good for the price. But, I definitely expected the food to be way way better. The butternut squash soup was good. I think out of all the dishes, this was my favorite. It was creamy and flavorful but not too dense. But it was lukewarm and I don't like lukewarm soup. My friend ordered the roasted beets with yogurt, and that was pretty good, but nothing to rave about. For the main course I ordered the angel hair pasta. That was quite mediocre. It was really oily and had no flavor. Like not even salt. I asked for some crushed red pepper and 20 minutes later, I did get it, but by that time I kind of ate enough of the bland pasta and I remained unimpressed. My friend ordered the salmon though, and said it was delicious. For dessert I got the salted caramel sundae, which was yummy but it was huge. It was for like 4 people. I felt so bad about wasting it! My friend ordered the almond cake, and that was amazing. I should've ordered that instead. Overall though, the portions of each course were huge. For a 3 course meal, I feel like you should make the portions a bit smaller so that you can eat everything?? But I guess that's good in a way. We did take home all the leftovers.I definitely recommend making a reservation. When the restaurant opened up at 12pm on a Tuesday, it was packed by 12:30.

I ordered a hamburger and the placed it on a bed of arugula instead of the bun. The they substitute the fries (cross contamination in the oil) with a side salad. Frankly I can't say anything but amazing for the burger. As they did not have any gluten free beer they suggested a pear cider. Normally I am not a cider fan as I find them too sweet.

The interior, however was very hip and nicely appointed.We were all excited for this meal and have been looking forward to it so we wanted to order a little bit of everything. When the food came out we couldn't wait to dig in. The plates were plated so beautifully, however, the flavors didn't match up. One of them was too greasy to even finish. None of the plates really stood out. Quite a disappointment. Service was a letdown too. Our server seemed either too busy or uninterested in coming to check on our table.

The meal was so amazing that I have almost no words to describe it. Make sure you save room for dessert! What's not to love about caramel ice cream topped with hot chocolate, peanuts, caramel popcorn and homemade whipped cream? My roommate even said it was one of the best desserts she's ever had. This is hands down one of the best restaurants in New York! It felt like a gourmet experience - a great place for a special lunch or dinner. After lunch, we walked through connecting floors to the ABC furniture and homewares store - definitely worth checking out!",5
117,1,11/16/2017,149,,"San Jose, CA",Archana R.,345,5.0,183,"Do not think I'd love it as much as I did! Being a vegetarian, I didn't see very many options on their menu that could cater, and even asked if they could make something off the menu. Though they weren't able to make something off the menu, they were willing to modify items to make them vegetarian. If you are going off the Yelp reviews, PLEASE don't believe that this place is for vegetarians. There were I believe 4 entree dishes that were vegetarian. Regardless, the dish I got was perfect! It was hard to tell portion size tho as their menu lists an appetizer price and an entree price. We ordered the Ricotta and Fig compote and marinated olives as the appetizer, as well as the roast carrot and avocado salad. For main course, we had the angel hair with jalapeño and garlic butter sauce topped with ricotta, pizza, and the crispy pork confit. We ended our delicious meals with an order of creme brûlée and the Concord grape tart.I ordered the pasta and the uniqueness of it was delightful! The added charm to this pasta was the saffron!",1
118,,7/22/2018,0,,Australia,Lyndal G.,37,1.0,31,I've eaten here twice previously. First time they were very obliging I was traveling solo and happily sat at the bar to eat. The meal was very nice. Second time I made a reservation a few weeks out before I departed and I arrived and they had doubled booked!! I told them I'd wait in the bar until they found our reservation & table as it was late December & a very busy time.This meal was nice but certainly not raising the bar by any standards. This visit we stood at the entrance & the obnoxious staff didn't even come over to greet us. They most certainly saw us standing there. If I could swear in this review I'd write exactly what I feel your establishment stands for Absolute B.......C.....I love the store & shop there on every visit to NYC. Plenty of amazingly fabulous restaurants in NYC without the attitude.,

123,,6/9/2018,193,,"Manhattan, NY",Nayla B.,264,2.0,137,"Atmosphere is great, food is just okay. Not really worth it for the price or size of dishes. For appetizer, we ordered the tuna, portobello mushroom, and the carrot salad. The carrot salad was delicious, but the tuna dish consisted of just 5 small pieces, and the portobello of one portobello mushroom. While the tuna dish was very flavorful, it was too small for my liking. The portobello dish lacked flavor and was very plain. For main course, we ordered the burger medium well, and it came out literally raw. We sent it back and it took another 20 minutes for it to come back. While the meat and toppings were great, the bread of the burger was terrible. All in all, it was a disappointing experience.",
124,,6/8/2018,87,,"Dallas, TX",Emitom H.,50,5.0,122,"ABC Kitchen has been on my NYC restaurant list for over a year so I was so excited when I was able to get a reservation during my most recent visit. I celebrated my birthday with a large group of friends at one of the round tables. They are great for a large group as you can talk to the whole table instead of being only able to talk to the people around you.We started with a round of their cocktails. We ordered around 4 different varieties and everyone was extremely satisfied. They were refreshing and tasty, but not too sugary. We also received fresh bread, which we quickly devoured.For appetizers, we ordered the cured meats and local cheeses, roasted beats with housemade yogurt, housemade ricotta, and pretzel dusted calamari. While all of them were delicious, my favorite was the calamari. The pretzel dust added a hint of salt to the calamari, which made it unique. It's a dish I would return to ABC Kitchen just to get.For mains, we ordered a variety of of dishes including the fettucini, casarecce, and the fried chicken. The fettucini came with a basil-pistachio pesto that is one of the best pestos I've ever eaten. Although all the food was delicious, the fried chicken was the standout. I was nervous when the waiter recommended it to a group of Texans, but we were not disappointed. On the outside it was lighter and more crisp than your typical fried chicken and on the inside it was super juicy and flavorful. I don't think I will ever be able to return to ABC Kitchen without ordering that chicken.Overall, ABC Kitchen went above and beyond my expectations. It was such an enjoyable birthday dinner as they let us take our time throughout the night and we could talk to everyone at the round table. They kindly stored a birthday cake and brought it out with candles. Also, their delicious, but healthy options didn't make me feel as guilty for eating out. I can't wait to get back to New York and eat here again!",

Soon as we sat down and ready to order, a white waitress walked to us and told us we can't move chairs at the bar, so I said ""ok, sorry"" while I saw there were a couple behind her taking three chairs with one chair for her purse. So I asked the waitress if she could ask the lady to take her purse and give us the chair. The waitress refused and said: "" Sorry no, we have to have 6 chairs at the bar"" and took the chair away. We didn't want to make a scene so we grabbed our things and walked out, but I think i need to voice out the uncomfortable experience we received from the staff at ABC Kitchen, i don't want to call her a racist but it was clear that other white customers moved around chairs and she rather let the other white lady to put her purse on another chair than give it to us to sit. Being a popular restaurant in NYC, ABC kitchen really need to reassess the quality of service they provide to customers. Until then, I will not feel comfortable return to this place.",10

However, the waitress came to us and said, you can't grab the chair from the table cuz we have particular arrangement for the sitting). Then I asked that waitress if she could gently ask a couple, who were sitting around the bar to give the chair to us, where she had her purse on, and she said No. Wait a minute, was she insinuating that she would rather have the the purse own the seat than giving us one more chair? I'm sure she didn't want to come off as a racist, but I don't feel comfortable about this experience.",8

My man asked the bartender if she could create something fun with a mezcal base (they have plenty of options on the cocktail list but he didn't like some of the ingredients) and​ she sent out this chocolate bitters inspired ""martini"" and he really enjoyed it. The sweet bartender even came by our table to check on us to be sure he liked it- and the bar was busy - so that was super kind of her to find a moment to do that. I LOVED the Palmoa on the list- with a full sprig of mint! Christian, the Reservation Specialist, personally​ stopped by our table to welcome us. He recommended​ some of his favorites and made us feel ""VIP."" The restaurant​ was busy but it did not affect the timing or synchronicity of our experience. Heather, our server, was detail oriented and found the perfect balance of checking in without hovering and overseeing our courses were delivered​ without a long waiting​ period. There was also hip young man with a beard assisting​ her, making sure our table was properly cleared and re-set. I never felt like I was rushed or searching and their teamwork​ made this a flawless dining experience​. When you go, GET THE SALMON. I never order Salmon at a restaurant​ but Christian told me it was to die for and OMG FLAVOR EXPLOSION. It was by far the best piece of fish I've had since I lived in Florida over 10 years ago. We were also sent out a ​complimentary dessert and a sparkling wine toast at the end of our meal for our anniversary and it was just so heartwarming​.

The asparagus was tasty. Light on the stomach and has a unique flavor - definitely a good option if you want something healthier. The fried chicken was amazing as well. It was very crispy while still being nice and tender on the inside. The sauce that it came with was sweet and spicy; it went perfectly well.

You order appetizers and entrees at the same time and they say they have a system that spaces everything out.Appetizers:*Crab toast with lemon aioli - not as much crab taste as I would like, but very fresh.*Chicory and roasted winter squash salad, maple-lemon vinaigrette and goat cheese - loved this, the vinaigrette had a little bit of a spicy kick to it but it worked*Pretzel dusted calamari, spicy tomato and mustard aioli - came out crispy and liked it with the mustard aioli more than the spicy tomatoEntree:*Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips - AMAZING. Wish I had more. The portions are small. The pork came out very tender and fell apart and the skin was perfectly crispy. There was a nice smokiness to the bacon marmalade and it was also on some mashed potatoes as well as the turnips.Dessert:*Sundae - salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, hot fudge - A delicious dessert to share with everyone. You wouldn't think popcorn and ice cream would mix, but it does.The service was great.

The service is attentive without being pushy. Crab toast is a must have with fresh ingredients and right amount of seasoning. It's a refreshing appetizer. Meat and cheese was also a simple nice one. We ordered the sea bass and the special for that night, sirloin steak in medium rare. I have to say they were just alright. I had better sea bass and sirloin steak than these. I would say coming here is for the ambiance. Everyone raves about the salted caramel sundae on Yelp, and we did order one as well. It was way too sweet for our taste.

Cute shabby chic vibe with fresh flowers at the table with mismatching vintage plates.The good-The food was good and not overpriced except for a few dishes. The mushroom, Parmesan, and farm egg pizza was our favorite as it was interesting. At $22, it's probably the best bang for me your buck. We also loved the pork confit. It was almost like Chinese BBQ pork, but elevated. The pork was extremely tender as in melts completely when you jab your fork into it, but they managed to give you a crispy skin on top of it. It's also topped with bacon. We didn't order the fried chicken, but our neighbor did. We were slightly jealous. It looked really good.The okay -Crab toast with lemon aioli was our app. It was recommended by our waitress and the crab meat was fresh, but nothing too special. I did like it more than the crab cakes at Jean Georges. The cocktails at $16 were all just okay. Nothing too extraordinary and we tried almost all of them on the menu. I had to send a spicy watermelon Mezcal back because it was a little too blend.  We thought the strawberry royale was too sweet. Service was alright. Our server was nice. Not super attentive, but we got what we needed.The bad-Crispy mushrooms as a side. They were 3 tiny little mushrooms lightly fried with a lighter aioli type of sauce. The mushrooms weren't flavorful at all and the sauce wasn't extraordinary to compensate for how boring the mushrooms were. They just looked good. They could have given me mini portobellos and they would of have more flavor. Did I mention those 3 tiny mushrooms cost us $13!?!? If you charge that much, they better be special. Also, the bathroom at abc kitchen is disgusting! The walls are dirty. The toilets have pee all over it. The mirrors are purposely blemished for the antique look, but ummm can I at least get a spot where I can see my face?The soap dispensers are broken with soap everywhere.",1
149,2,2/9/2017,505,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Chris E.,8595,5.0,1059,"5 stars just doesn't do ABC Kitchen justice!Having wanted to dine at ABC Kitchen since they won the JBF Award for Best New Restaurant in 2011, I finally had a chance to visit when I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and did we ever enjoy the experience here.The outside of the restaurant was pretty unassuming, except for the small ABC Kitchen sign right above the entrance that was quite difficult to actually see in the evening. Nevertheless, we found it. Our dinner reservation was for Saturday, 6pm --- a bit earlier for dinner than desired because they were booked to the brim that evening. I made my reservation about 1 month in advance, so that goes to show you BOOK EARLY if you want to dine here!When we walked in, we walked thru the spacious bar and feasted our eyes on a really magnificently decorated, dimly-lit and huge dining area. The tables went back as far as my eyes could see. This was one of the largest dining ""rooms"" I had ever seen in an NYC restaurant! With the lack of space in NYC, I never thought I would see a dining area so long!The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived at around 5:50, but by the time we finished at 7:30, it was almost at capacity. Surprising in that they could get such a large restaurant completely filled, not surprising in that it's ABC Kitchen and one of Jean-Georges' gems.I've written a book and still haven't gotten to the food, so here goes. One word, AMAZING. There was not one dish that we disliked and each dish had it's own uniqueness. There was something that stood out with everything we tried. We wanted to try everything, but went with what we knew was most popular:CRAB TOAST WITH LEMON AIOLISomething we saw a lot of on Yelp and it was much better than we even anticipated. First, the toast holding the crab was very large so it was easily shared between 2 people. The crab was cold, extremely fresh and melted in our mouths. It was some of the best fresh crab meat I had ever tasted. A must start with appetizer as we saw multiple tables order this.KASHA AND BOWTIE PASTA, VEAL MEATBALLSThe restaurant allowed for 2 options, an appetizer size or entree size. Since we wanted to try more dishes, we went with the appetizer portion. OK we were starving too, but trying a little bit of everything doesn't hurt either. The dish arrived in 2 small bowls, 1 for me and 1 for my girlfriend. The pasta was cooked al dente, maybe a bit under? I'm used to pasta being very soft, but the pasta had verrrrrry slight hardness to it, but it worked to perfection. The sauce wasn't overwhelming, but gave the pasta a great flavor. The little veal meatballs were scattered all around and complimented the pasta perfectly.PIZZA - MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN,OREGANO AND FARM EGGAlthough I saw this repeatedly online, our waitress and a busboy informed us that this was their favorite pizza here, so that's all the convincing we needed. Regardless of their opinions we were going to order this pizza and it met every piece of hype I read and heard. There was a ton of mushroom scattered on the outside of the pizza next to the crust, while the egg was floating around in the middle. Everything about this pizza was tasty. The mushroom had a toasty flavor to it, the egg mixed in well and the cheese was ... well very cheesy. An absolutely flavorful pizza for the ages.BLACK SEA BASS WITH CHILIES AND HERBS, BABY MARKET POTATOES AND SPINACHSince we were 2 people, the kitchen split our entree into 2 bowls. As to why restaurant don't do this more often, I don't know, but ABC Kitchen got it right. By the time we reached this dish, we were pretty close to stuffed, but after 1 bite of the fish, we easily made a bit more room (subconsciously). The skin was very crispy and it definitely made the sea bass that much more interesting. It sat on a little bed of spinach with a few slices of potato to the side. It was simple, elegant, light and, best of all, really good.SUNDAE WITH SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM, CANDIED PEANUTS & POPCORN,WHIPPED CREAM, HOT FUDGEYou can't have a meal at a James Beard award winner without dessert so we forged ahead despite our bloated stomachs. We went with the popular salted caramel ice cream sundae. To sum it up, it was a huge order of 3 scoops of excellent salted caramel ice cream. Texture and taste were right on point. And if you love caramel, there was some caramel popcorn (tasted like cracker jacks) spread out over it as well.Everything about ABC Kitchen was perfect. The service was fantastic. Since it was girlfriend's birthday, I walked up to a random busboy (during a ""bathroom break"") and told him if we could get a candle and small Happy Birthday dessert for my girlfriend and they came thru when our salted caramel dessert arrived. The atmosphere was laid back, yet romantic with the dim lighting. The dress code was casual amongst not only the customers, but the waiters as well. The experience of dining here was everything and much more than we had expected!",5
150,,3/24/2017,131,,"New York, NY",Steve L.,1043,5.0,269,"Lunch review.This place rocks. Service is snappy and food is incredible. I came here with my brother, sister-in-law, and 3 year-old niece on a Saturday early afternoon. No reservation, no problem. Promptly seated and waited on. It was tough to decide whether to go more breakfast-style or lunch, since any dish you see pass by would sway you one way or the other. But, I'm generally more of a savory eater - so lunch it was. We pretty much shared everything, and we got:Apps:Pretzel crusted calamari - a really interesting twisted on your standard fried calamari dish; crispy and served with a delicious mustard sauce.Roasted kabocha squash toast with fresh ricotta and apple cider vinegar - yum!  I was a little skeptical - I like squash and all, but on toast? Yes. A tad little bit on the sweet side, but still really good.Crab toast - Bam. Yuuuge chunks of crab, served with slaw and a lemon aoli. These flew off the plate.SideRoasted Brussels Sprouts, Prosciutto, Apples and Herbs - I love me some brussels. This was no exception.MainsMushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - First off, I love that the pizzas are whole wheat. Decadence with a side of health(er).  Fantastic. A little bit of a tough time to cut, but just great.

Let me just say, it was one of the best meals I've ever had! My dad and I split everything, beginning with the Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad - WOW!! Highly recommend. They even split it for us. We also got the Casarecce pasta with fennel sausage, broccoli rabe, and Shepard's basket cheese - delicious!! Slightly spicy, but so so good. Finally, we ordered the asparagus pizza - an amazing combination! It was the perfect amount of food for us to split. Since we were celebrating my birthday, the waitress surprised me with a chocolate cupcake and plate with 'happy birthday' written so beautifully! Since that didn't seem to be enough, we topped off the night with the sundae dessert! One of the richest desserts I've ever tasted!!  I will say it is pretty dim inside, but it was very intimate and pleasant. We had incredible service and our waitress was so thoughtful to talk through the menu and provide her recommendations. I could not have imagined a better birthday dinner!!",

Very noisy, terrible service, undercooked and mediocre food that is priced at a level far exceeding the quality provided. Have been super excited to come here for some time and was very disappointed.I am not the kind of person who gets upset with bad service because if the food is on point then happy tummy triumphs over annoyances like: unnoticed empty glasses, wrong drink orders set down on the table, waiting for someone to notice dirty finished plates for 20 min while we politely wait for someone to notice and/or please bring the bill so we can leave and go save the night by getting shake shack up the street. Had the crab toast was just ok. Not much flavor. Tuna sashimi was ok but lacking imagination; pretty much like you would expect it to be with some diced mint and soy sauce. Pesto pasta was a pile of undercooked stodgy starch. Oily and no flavor; barely touched and server didn't notice although when told it was was undercooked, offered to replace but did not remove from the bill. Ravioli was good. Well cooked and good flavor.Overall would not return. So many other better places to go in this city both with lower and higher priced options.",

Updated review",292,2,"Pembroke Pines, FL",Brenda P.,12925,5.0,703,"Seated at a beautiful round table for six, we relaxed and enjoyed ourselves. Chic with a side of street sass thrown in, this Jean-Georges original has fascinated me for years. Not only is the food extraordinary, but I love supporting their genuine farm-to-table efforts. Locally grown fresh produce? Mostly organic? Cruelty free-humanly treated livestock? Free of pesticides, fertilizers, insecticides, and GMOs? Yes, yes, yes! My favorite hot-sauce butter fried chicken dish is no longer available for lunch, but you can still order it off the dinner menu. Our party size allowed us to sample a good portion of the menu. #travelperks The highlights were the Ricotta and Farm Egg Raviolo and the Akaushi Cheeseburger. For dessert, the Cookie Plate and Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae were the crowd pleasers, as usual. I especially loved the simple and lightly sweet Almond Cake. Make sure you research what the restaurant-front looks like, to avoid getting lost as I did my first time.To say I'm excited about the upcoming ABC Kitchen Miami is to put it lightly.",7

After we got seated, I noticed there were a few empty tables that never got filled during my stay, so my guess is that those are for the walk ins. The atmosphere here is undeniably intimate and the service is great. They have a lot of tables in the restaurant with some big round tables in the corner. Our table is in close proximity to our neighboring table (less than 5 feet away)For appetizer, we ordered the crab toast. It was really good! I think the white sauce covered the crabmeat taste a little bit. This dish is definitely refreshing but the taste of it mainly come from the natural taste of the crab rather than a well thought creation from the chef. For main meal, my boyfriend ordered the sea bass and I ordered the bow tie pasta with veal meatballs. They are both delicious. I am just a little disappointed because they tasted ordinary. You come here definitely for the quality and freshness of the food and the atmosphere. If you're looking for a dish that will blow your mind away, then this is not the place.",2

This time, my family and I cam back to celebrate my parents' anniversary. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance because this place is so popular. We started off with some drinks. We tried the the apple bijou, carrotini, and black mission fig martini. All three were delicious - the apple bijou was sweet and refreshing, the carrotini (my favorite) uses fresh carrot juice, and the martini was dark and strong. They were all $16, which was definitely pricey but it was a special occasion. For appetizers, we had the chicken liver toast, shaved raw fluke with gooseberries, and roasted carrot and avocado salad. The chicken liver toast was delicious, but I the chicken liver was spread so thin that I was left wanting more. The shaved fluke was refreshing with the sweetness the fruits and the kick of the chilis. Our favorite was definitely the salad though. It was actually a generous portion, which chunks of avocados, tufts of greens, and whole carrots. I don't understand how carrots can be that sweet and flavorful! For mains, we had the angel hair pasta with saffron, black sea bass, and crispy pork confit. The pasta was a bit of a let down. Although the taste was good and I liked the chunks of ricotta, the pasta was too soft and came out lukewarm. The sea bass was cooked just right, but the taste wasn't memorable. The pork confit on the other hand was amazing. I loved how they gave you two types of preparation - one that was crispy and one that was stewed until incredibly tender. For dessert we ordered the apple pie with Saigon cinnamon ice cream. The pastry was flakey and the center was gooey, and it paired nicely with the ice cream. We also got two mini chocolate cupcakes as a gift from the restaurant. It was such a sweet surprise!Overall, it was a lovely dining experience! Definitely pricey, but it's worth the occasional splurge!",

I also really enjoyed the crab toast lemon aioli, but thumbs down for small portions as a consequence of chic eating. Liked my entree even more, which was black bass with chilies, herbs, spinach and basil. Normally I wouldn't order fish just because I don't think it's worth the price and flavor. Yet this black bass had just the right amount of sweet and sour. Top it off with some baby market potatoes and I indulged myself in a good ol' American dinner. Which must've been really good because I rarely eat like this when I go out. And although this was one of the most expensive group meals I've had, it was well worth it.",

The cake was crunchy and delectable with a marshmallow burnt crust. The lemon tart was sweet with some tarty berries and some fresh cream. The butternut squash soup was tasty thick and creamy. The entrees were medium rare seared salmon with a fresh velvety salad and light dresssing that added a kick. The portobello mushroom also has a similar sauce but it tasted a lot like mushrooms.

Smooth on top with a good crunch from the toast. As for the pasta, I got the pesto fettuccine,entrée size, and it is definitely big enough for sharing. I thought it might have needed some salt but the pesto was there and the fettuccine was al dente. I also tried the ravioli with ricotta and it was like pasta puff clouds of cheese. Super creamy and yummy. I've also tried the infamous fried chicken dish and it really meets the hype. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. As for the desserts, I tried the panna cotta and the sundae. The panna cotta was all right. Pretty standard. The panna cotta was soft and creamy and the fresh peaches was a nice addition to the dish. However, the star and the best thing I have ever had at ABC Kitchen is their Sundae. OMG it is just so good. I am not really a dessert girl but I would go back just for the sundae. The caramel popcorn, caramel ice cream, whipped cream, peanuts and hot fudge. It was all just so good and everything just perfectly complemented each other.

I moved to NYC from a little town in Texas so it took me a while to wrap my head around how there was a well-known restaurant inside a carpet and furniture store, of all places. But ABC Kitchen is so established for a reason. My friends and I tried several dishes for dinner - Crab toast with lemon aioli: I would literally come back just to eat this toast. The crab is so fresh and tender, and worked so well with the toast and aioli that my heart did palpitations. I think everyone should try this at least once.Shaved raw fluke with horseradish, celery root, and lemon: Very refreshing in its lightness, but also very, very, horseradishy. I didn't get much of the other flavors as everything was drowned out by one note.Pasta with pork ragu and chile oil: I think this was taken off the menu so I can't find the exact name now, but in any case, it was delicious. Very interesting combination of traditional Italian fare with Chinese chile oil. I hope this comes back sometime!Fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter: This'll make you regret every bad decision you've ever made regarding your waistline, but it's guilty pleasure food at its best so get it anyway. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure how well a pool of spicy butter works with crispy fried chicken; some people will be like 'gross' and some will be like 'give it here right now' and for better or worse my gluttonous stomach falls into the latter camp.Crispy pork confit with braised turnips and smoked bacon marmalade: Literally fall off the bone good - easily a crowd favorite.Salted caramel ice cream: Terrific. We agreed that we should've gone with the sundae though - it sounds like a lot, but several scoops of just salted caramel ice cream by itself, no matter how good, gets a little monotonous pretty quickly.The main gripe I have with ABC is that somehow, it feels too impersonal.

Shabby chic while still being polished, open while still being intimate. Everything from the tables to the plate ware was beautiful and bright, they really made a beautiful space. I went with the $34 prix fixe: Tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint, Ricotta and farm egg raviolo, pork ragu, chilies, sage and parmesan, almond cake strawberries & vanilla ice cream. To start I ordered the Mezcal Lavender Paloma with grapefruit ($16) and it was a delicious cocktail. They balanced the smokiness of the mezcal with the floral lavender perfectly, a great summer drink! The sashimi was probably some of the freshest tuna I have ever had. It practically melted in my mouth, very little chewing was necessary. And I'm not one to really care too much about presentation, but this was really very lovely in appearance, the pieces of tuna were arranged to look similar to a flower. And the flavors of the ginger and mint weren't too understated, I was worried that a classier joint would be a little too delicate with their fish but this was perfectly prepared. The entree was where things fell apart, and actually makes this review closer to 3 1/2 stars. It sounds great, it arrived looking rich and decadent. But I thought there was entirely way too much Parmesan. Some will claim you can never have enough, but it looked like my dish got caught in a snowstorm, and I didn't like how that factored into the dish when it came to texture. I also thought the pork in the ragu itself was overcooked. I was expecting something tender and almost shredded, but there were some sizable hunks in there that took too much cutting and chewing to get to. There was also a ton of sage, those wilted leaves were everywhere and were too overpowering for me. The ravioli itself was the star, with the delicious and perfectly cooked egg, and it was my favorite part. The dessert, usually my least favorite part of the meal, was delicious. The strawberries and ice cream were both so fresh, and the almond cake was moist but sturdy enough to pair with them. Overall it was an enjoyable meal with undeniably quality ingredients, but I'm not sure that I would come back without ordering from the prix fixe menu.",2

However, the server kept interrupting our conversation and giving us a pressure to leave the table asap. I calculated how long we stayed there. From the moment we went in and the time we came out, it took only one and a half hour. I understand it's a popular place but it was definitely not a pleasant experience.Besides, there was a hair from the food that we ordered. As soon as we told them about it, the server said they'll bring a new food. Okay but another big reason that we couldn't love this place, the ""hygiene.""Food-wise it was okay.. Just okay. Maybe I expected too high or so?",1
196,1,12/24/2017,15,,"Highland Park, IL",Leah C.,49,4.0,34,"We were told that there was about a 45 minute wait for a table for two. Because I was STARVING, this made me pretty upset. But walking around ABC home made the wait fly by. The store is huge and has everything you could wish for (We snacked on lavender and rose flavored chocolates!). After being seated, a while went by before we were greeted by our waitress. Nonetheless, she was very sweet. The food was great. We got the butternut squash soup (which was amazing), crab toast, kale salad, and fig prosciutto pizza. The portions were small and the prices steep, but everything was fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that our table was tall and unstable. The dishes are very delicate, so I felt nervous something was going to fall and break. Plus, our chairs were not comfortable, they were hard and flimsy.",

Had been to abc v and abc cocina so was looking forward to the dinner but this was by far the worst of the three. 1. Service was poor. Waiter was inattentive and unfriendly after having to flag him down after long periods of time waiting to order 2. Food was subpar. We even took waiters suggestion on the favorite pasta dish. I am not picky with pasta and it should be an easy crowd pleaser but both my boyfriend and I found it pretty poor. 3. We were there for my boyfriends birthday. I mentioned this to the waiter AND both hostesses. I was told they'd bring a cupcake and candle. We lingered for a while but eventually gave up. When I mentioned this to the hostess on the way out, he looked confused despite having just discussed this an hour prior and having watched him jot a note by our reservation listing",

Crab aioli on toast2. Fried oysters and scrambled eggs (eggs made with habanero, elderflower syrup, something something vinegar, paprika infused butter)3. Horseradish fluke4. Eggs benedict.  The ham was just crazy umami.",3

Ordered the crab toast, fried calamari, lobster truffle and beef truffle. Everything was just ok and overpriced for just ok. Service was decent here. I liked ABC cocina better.",
