1,Lauren C.,"East Meadow, NY",201,18,0,2.0,9/2/2018,"Let me start by saying I've been to a couple of the Pig n Whistle locations and it's a favorite for when friends come into town and we're looking for solid bar food. I'm now sitting in front of burnt bread, crab and asiago dip that may as well be cheese I put in the microwave, and the most bland French onion soup imaginable. The kicker? Not all food is good, but the experience can still be. Our bartender spent all of his time flirting with one of the waitresses and never even asked us how our food was. Sad excuse for service.",2,,
2,Steve R.,"Mableton, GA",86,144,425,3.0,8/17/2018,"Super fun restaurant/bar. Would be awesome to watch a game here I'm sure. I came in here to grab a quick bite to eat and get a quick beer before I started on a little bit of a walking adventure.I got here a little before lunch time so when I sat down at the bar, the place was pretty empty. I think there was just one other person, but he may have been a vendor/supplier.I just got the sliders for a quick bite and a Bud Light. Here is where I was thrown off....I wasn't expecting much from this place in regards to food, but the sliders were outstanding!!! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Amazing actually. The beer however, tasted a little off and was a bit flat. With this place having such a huge cool bar, I expected the beer to be their game. For the food I was expecting typical bar food. Total opposite.I would come back to this place to watch a game or something since the bar was so cool and I bet it would be a good atmosphere. I would order a cocktail next time though.",,,
3,Antonio S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,85,16,4.0,11/18/2018,"Went here for drinks after a subpar dinner at another place and was pleasantly surprised. The hostess greeted us and we went to their upstairs bar. I ordered a Long Island and my date ordered a margarita. YES, finally a bartender that knows how to make a drink! The Long Island was on point and so was the margarita. My only complaint would be the size as the cups are small as hell! We didn't eat any food but from the look and smell of the food passing by I could tell their food is good. I am definitely coming back here, I was so impressed will be back next weekend!",1,,
4,Briana S.,"Appleton, WI",178,88,9,3.0,11/7/2018,"Average food, pretty reasonable, but the atmosphere is very inviting. You really feel like you're in an Irish pub.",,,
5,Jenn H.,"East Meadow, NY",260,54,386,3.0,9/10/2018,"So this bar is good for a trendy drink if you're In the mood to be hipster for the night. I don't think it's anything special, but it'll do just fine for a quick stop to just shoot the shit. The drinks are a little overpriced(not at all surprising in NYC) and mine at least were weak. The place was clean and I'll say the bathrooms were immaculate which I was very surprised about. I'm taking away a star because nobody ever came to take our food/drink order until 20 minutes after we got there and there , and one more because my cranberry and vodka had a table spoon of vodka and was basically all cranberry. They also ran out of Malibu Rum which I thought was odd. Not bad, but nothing to brag about either.",1,,
6,Cathy A.,"New York, NY",0,9,10,5.0,11/9/2018,"Go here every time we visit NYC! Great food, fun awesome atmosphere! Prices reasonable for the city. A must go to place ! Staff always friendly",,,
7,Aurora C.,"Long Island, NY",171,70,137,5.0,4/3/2018,So delicious. I wasn't expecting the quality that I received. I ordered the Bangers n Mash and the gravy really set the meal over the top. The sausages were so soft and juicy. There was a decent portion of mashed potatoes too. We also ordered the Fish N Chips which were fried to perfection!,1,,
8,Ashley J.,"Clarksville, TN",0,6,7,5.0,8/24/2018,"We've spent a week in New York and have been here several times. The happy hour is awesome if you enjoy beer and vodka, $5 drinks! The homemade meatloaf is to die for. The Roasted Turkey is good, but would be great with mayo or some type of sauce. I Will definitely come back. And I've included the WiFi, you're all damn welcome.",,,
9,Stephanie S.,"Irvington, NJ",75,136,68,3.0,7/18/2018,Came for $5 drinks during lunch time. Nice atmosphere. Bartender was nice. Drinks were ok. I can see myself coming back to try some food and more drinks. I'll give a more detailed review then.,,,
10,Lorie D.,"Girard, OH",0,13,40,1.0,9/2/2018,Awful place. I hate to do this but they deserve it.  Not a soul around to take a order for 10 Min. Then a man came over and said we could not serve unless we ordered food. So we ordered risotto balls the oil was old. Left a after taste on my mouth from the nasty thing. The real they get one Star is the drink was good and the beers were cold. Also dirty table and hot inside no air.,2,,
11,Brendan M.,"Boston, MA",2,3,0,1.0,10/6/2018,The food was 3/10 and lacked any urgency in service. My second review I've ever written.,,,

At one point I was looking for our waitress, and she was nowhere to be found. I shouldn't work this hard to get a little cup of horseradish and malt vinegar. Why do they serve oysters with just cocktail sauce though?Great beer selection on draft.",1,2,1
13,Shannah H.,"Plano, TX",299,942,1940,4.0,10/29/2017,"Great atmosphere - cozy, plenty of TV screens and obviously very popular. Just what you expect from a pub. The only strike are the drink prices. A Woodford Reserve Neat = $14. Woodford Reserve is good, but that's a little high. Still, I'm glad we stopped in here for a nightcap. It felt like a truly NYC clubby end to our evening.",2,,
14,Sonya C.,"Indianapolis, IN",64,113,91,1.0,12/5/2017,I stopped in here to kill some time while on a business trip to New York. It was about 3 in the afternoon when we went here. Can I just say how AWKWARD their servers were?! We sat at the bar and the two different bartenders stood directly in front of my co worker and I for the entire hour we were in the building. It was so uncomfortable. Honestly wouldn't go back for that alone. Beer menu seemed pretty good. And drinks were reasonably priced,,,
15,Veronica C.,"Bronx, NY",202,95,191,5.0,9/8/2017,"$1 oysters, $5 happy hour drinks, pretty varied menu, need I say more? Service is always friendly and the atmosphere is very chill. There are several TV screens posted so you can watch the Mets lose or US open, whatever. The bathrooms are clean, and there is a lot of indoor seating. 9/10, overall. My only recommendation is having the venue a bit brighter late at night. It can be a bit dim!",2,2,2
16,Devin L.,"Yonkers, NY",309,731,108,4.0,9/9/2017,"I was in the area and I've been to the one on the East Side, so I knew that the food was going to be good.  As I passed, it seemed pretty sleepy inside, not too many people.  It was almost 1pm, so I met a friend around the corner and suggested we go over there.  In the 5 min that took, the bar packed up.  We were seated upstairs, right by the window.  It was really nice.  The window was open, beautiful day, sure it was loud outside, but so what.I had an Allagash White, it was bottled, but still nice and cold.  The waitress was right there for us.  My friend was on lunch and they did a great job of getting us our drinks and food in a quick fashion.I got the meatball sliders.  You get 3 individual meatball sandwiches and some potato wedges.  The sliders were delicious, not too much sauce, so not messy.  A really nice quick meal.  The wedges were good as well.Really nice Midtown bar.  I liked it as much as the one on the East Side.",1,1,1
17,Marie D.,"Phoenix, AZ",238,60,4,2.0,3/31/2018,"Food was good, but some of the worst service I've ever gotten. Waiter couldn't have possibly avoided us more, and it took longer to get drinks than it did to get food. And TBH not even sure there was alcohol in the drinks we first got",,,
18,Don S.,"Liberty, NY",23,32,18,5.0,7/22/2018,We stopped in to grab some food before getting on the train. World Cup was on every TV. I was good to go. There were only a couple of tables and they were reserved for later but the hostess sat us anyway. I was impressed again and we just walked in. Atmosphere was lively. Food was good. Had a good pour of Guinness. I will be back.,,,

Omg on a Wednesday night it was pretty packed. Our waitress was super nice and great recommendations. I ordered the bangers and mash and it was amaze balls.

20,Cathy P.,"Ashburn, VA",15,26,1,4.0,7/28/2018,Bangers and Mash Two thumbs up. Had the Chicken Jameson and the portion was large and very good. Good Guinness. Good cider and double shot Jameson-all a hit. Oh and don't let me forget the Irish Nachos - YUM,,,
21,Heidi S.,"Wethersfield, CT",0,9,0,1.0,10/1/2018,"Got there at 6:30 plenty of time to make 8:00 concert. Not terribly busy but took forever for anyone to take order. Took forever to get salads about 45 min later, waitress comes over and tells us kitchen is backed up and we may not be served for another 10 min. That would have made us late for concert. Left only having salad. Very frustrating!",,,
22,Tracy T.,"Buckeye, AZ",0,6,3,3.0,7/22/2018,"The place is clean with good service but the food is absolutely horrible. We had soup and appetizer and an entrée and they were all bland with no flavor and didn't taste good at all. If you're going for drinks or to watch sports, this place is great. If you're going for food. Choose somewhere else.",,,
23,Dana R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,3,1,5.0,3/8/2018,"Charming and authentic feel. I have been to many pubs in Ireland and The Pig and Whistle feels like I've crossed the ocean and landed in Cork! Smithwicks on tap as well as regular American beer. Went there 3 times in two days. Had the Fish and chips, Shepard's pie twice it was that good. Attentive but not intrusive staff. Irish music played over the speakers but during happy hour a nice selection of newer tunes. Wish I could be here for their St. Pats celebration next week.",,,

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and would visit this place again! Please see below for the pros and cons of my experience: Pros: The food comes in sizable portions and is delicious! I ordered the penne alla vodka and it was honestly one of the best that I've had in a while! Both my coworkers were raving about the mac n cheese with bacon so I'm definitely planning on trying that the next time I go here!We arrived during happy hour and they had pretty good deals - $5 for certain mixed drinks, which is great for the area!The atmosphere of the bar area is lively! I loved the décor inside and the really high ceilings! Cons: For a Wednesday evening, the bar was pretty loud and I had a hard time conversing with my coworkers.Our waitress was friendly, but I thought it was very strange how she dropped my drink off at the table without saying anything. I didn't even notice that my drink  had arrived for over 10 minutes, which has never happened to me before.",,,

28,Jahsid M.,"New York, NY",166,92,41,4.0,8/30/2017,"this place is just excellent, the music is there but not so loud it becomes obnoxious the theme and decor are is nice they really nailed it, I had some laughs and funny moments with the men's bathroom as the door has a really funny design flaw anytime you wash your hands be prepared to get hit by the door when someone opens it to walk in, the place is spacious you will never feel like you're surrounded or you have a mob on top of you, the staff is very courteous and warm it's rare to be greeted or even interact with the person bringing your food or cleaning up your table as they usually just rush away awkwardly or timid but here everyone is your friend not just your server, I think the food is great and the service is up to par and the theme is just the icing on the cake I can see what all the hype is about.goddam the creme brulee has the perfect touch to play off of the bitterness of the strawberries I've had lots of prior experiences with creme brulee, none this memorable that I actually notice the synergy between that of the strawberries and creme brulee it's poetic.",,,

The waitress was very nice .The food was also good and consistent . The decor is very nice me bigger than I thought when we first walked in .The 5 star is missing because the place smelled bad .

We finally asked for a check.",,,
31,Casey D.,"Philadelphia, PA",212,56,29,5.0,4/12/2018,Great happy hour experience here! We hung out at the upstairs bar and ordered a platter- the food was great! Mozzarella sticks and spinach dip were both amazing!,,,

If it weren't for its adorable name, I'd never walk into another Pig and Whistle in the city, yet I keep going back. This is a standard bar in tourist-laden midtown with substandard service. Went in with some friends after having dinner at a nearby steakhouse. All of us being locals or having been NYC locals knew not to expect any service above the standard, but I, for whatever bizarre reason, expected at least the average. The bartender was nothing short of the word terrible. After walking in and making direct eye contact with the bartender, he walked the opposite direction of my friends and I, and began socializing with a man sitting at the bar (presumably a friend who was visiting him on his shift). It took almost a solid 10 minutes to get him to come back to our end of the bar and take our drink orders. It wasn't busy and it was a Thursday. In midtown. This place is shit. The Playwright is a block or two away. Go there and spend your money on better service. Plus, Playwright buys back beers. You're welcome!",3,1,1

With lots and lots of tvs playing every sport you could think of!!!! We got the wings, ribs and coleslaw!!! Let's start with the wings they were amazing!!! Nothing fancy just good wings with the right amount of spice! The blue cheese dressing served with them was amazing!!! So many huge chunks!!! The coleslaw was really yummy just a super small size, which was ok since my husband is not a fan so I didn't have to share! And the ribs delicious! Perfect fall of the bone! Staff was kinda hit or miss but I think it was because so many people were watching the game they didn't want to bother people. That being said our drinks were always full!

We ordered 6 oysters (since they were $1 each), a draft beer, mixed drink & mozzerla sticks. Don't fool yourself with these disgusting oysters. No wonder they're only $1. If the Hudson River had oysters, they probably got them from there. Gross! My beer was cool not cold as it should be.

Waitress was very friendly albeit slow in refilling drinks, etc. Others with me got the $1 oyster special, and they said it was fresh and tasty. Lots of TVs and they were playing english premier league football (soccer) which was really my main draw in. Overall, a decent place for good inexpensive eats and to enjoy some good conversation and sporting events.",3,3,3

I could understand this if there were people at tables but the place was empty except for the bar which had all its chairs full. I could also see if they offered us a table but only until food customers came in. Instead they had no problem turning two paying customers away. We went across the street instead. Had our two drinks and a fabulous night without the help of the pigs.Response to mgmt: I call BS on your claim because the tables were still empty when we finished our drinks at the other bar. Also a good establishment would allow patrons to sit until the table was needed. It seems you are just not a fan of business. That's fine.

Also a little balcony upstairs that goes outside. Looks like your average little pub.FOOD/DRINKS: Have yet to order actual entrees from here, but the spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks are always my go to snack. The spin dip is especially good, mozzarella sticks are pretty average. DRINKS: Drinks are pretty decently priced compared to other bars in the city. Around $6 for a regular beer, only  $5 for drink if its on the specials board. I usually opt for the ""cherry coke"" (cherry vodka and coke) which is usually a special.

I mean, I will always prefer 25c/50c wing specials, but I will never say no to wings.  The typical buffalo sauce wasn't overpowering, and they went really well with the chipotle mayonnaise that came with the fried shrimp.  Speaking of the shrimp, that was the one disappointing dish.  I don't really remember why I ordered them, but I regretted my decision once the dish was brought to our table.  They weren't greasy or cooked poorly, but they just weren't worth the money. I know, frozen baby shrimp was a guarantee for a bar, so I brought that unto myself.  Do yourself a favor and pass on the shrimp.Service was great, and we were seated right away even though we got there at a very busy point of the day.  Waiters and busboys were a-plenty as are TVs including a giant overhead projector.Poor happy hour specials are the bane of my first world existence.  Seriously, Midtown Manhattan and you're serving up Rolling Rock and PBR.

Daily soup specials are alway homemade and delicious. Many ""appetizers"" satisfy me as a lunch main course after a cup of soup. Cornmeal crusted fried shrimp, chicken quesadilla, chili with chips are all great this way.Cobb salad, burgers, shepherds pie, chicken pot pie, are all excellent as well. I'm not really a lunchtime drinker, but a glass of wine is always reasonable and the selection of reds is pleasing.

It wasn't awful, but it wasn't good either. I got the pulled pork sandwich, and I have to say I was really disappointed. My neighborhood joint makes one that blows this one out of the water (Bobbique's), so maybe I'm being a little unfair, but I really felt let down. The fries were good, but the cole slaw was of an EXTREMELY liquid consistency; another let down. They didn't have a big selection on tap either, which I found odd for a pub. The service was polite and prompt, so kudos for that I guess. I would give this place another shot if I was in the area and REALLYYYYYY hungry. Other than that though, I'll pass.",,,

It's pretty much what you expect from an Irish pub in terms of decor and menu. Food is good, but not spectacular and portion sizes are pretty generous. Drinks are good, not watery, but nothing you can't find anywhere else. My preferred hangout spot is the upstairs bar, near the balcony. There's usually someone smoking out on the balcony, so if this bothers you, it might not be the best place to hang out. There are lots of TVs here, which are great if you're trying to keep tabs on whatever game is on at the moment.

The place is 2 floors and small. The drinks were good; I had a Johnnie Walker Black on the rocks and an Irish Car Bomb. The ambiance is okay as you can step outside on the balcony to get a fresh air or smoke. In other words, it's a typical Irish Pub. The 2nd floor is so small. The staff is kind and friendly. There's no bouncer as I entered so I have no problem entering.It can get crowded after work hours. Also, some people (other customers) at the bar seem to be so full of themselves as I almost had a fight with a certain group of people while trying to exit the bar because they wouldn't move after a couple of times I kindly said 'excuse me.'I'd go only for a quick drink and appetizer since it's near on my way home. zthis is not a place to get socially with different people.

I don't know if it's due to a seasonal reason ( I came here early December Friday), but it was REALLY packed and I had hard time to find a space to comfortably drink my beer. As for bartenders here, they are really nice and attentive. Even though the bar counter was extremely packed, they were working hard to pick the orders from guests screaming around, and I never waited so long to order my drinks. And one of the bartenders remembered my name for my tub, and I could easily order my drinks each time(my name is totally Asian and sometimes difficult to remember for some people though).
