It's probably a tough squeeze when they are busy.I did not give them four stars for the location or atmosphere. I gave them four stars for the coffee. I was served by a nice lady named Lilliana.   She said that I had to try the espresso because it's very smooth. She was right. It is one of the smoothest I have ever tasted. Not bad for a tiny, neighborhood, hole-in-the-wall. Four Stars Indeed.",1,,1
1,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1900,818,3.0,8/19/2018,"Small, casual cafe with one sweet barista who is there to cater to you. I got the green tea latte and my friend got a black coffee. Sadly, they don't have almond milk, which is a strike for me, so I got mine with soy. The latte was huge, and tasted alright. Definitely didn't taste like it was from Italy. There's much better coffee in the area for the same price, especially because I didn't even taste the coffee in my latte, but hey, I still enjoyed it. Also got scrambled eggs with turkey. Again, it wasn't bad, but it was small and definitely not worth the price. Felt like a light snack. Don't come here if you're starving, because I definitely didn't feel full, but it was enough to tide me over. Still, it's a decent, extremely low-key stop for coffee, pastries, and light snacks.",2,,2

The Rueben was small and drowning in dressing and the chicken sandwiches had paper thin layers of chicken and all you could taste was the bread (even with taking one layer off). Totally overpriced for what you get. Will never order again. If you are going to go here, avoid the sandwiches.",,,

14,Clint J.,"San Bruno, CA",2,20,5,5.0,1/18/2017,"Visited a conference and stayed across the street from this place,went in because the doorman suggested it.  On the outside it looks a little dodgy. In fact it doesn't look much better once you go in, but the espresso and cappuccino are the best I've had (and I'm also comparing to Frisson Espresso).  The cappuccino is so creamy and has the perfect balance of espresso blended in. The roast they use comes from a partnership in Italy and is awesome. Also the chocolate croissant, the almond cookie and bread pudding are crazy amazing!  The almond cookie maybe one of the best desserts I've had in NY.  I've read some of the reviews and some people even describe this place as creepy. They are completely misreading the situation. A mother owns the coffee shop and the salon next door.  She is a great cook and fixes a mean turkey, cheddar, and egg sandwich. The son that runs the coffee shop is very shy but super friendly. My wife and I have gone other places in NYC and continue to regret that we just didn't go back there. I will certainly continue to go back.",1,,

But in this area, cafes are hard to find!Thank goodness this little tiny cafe was here. We tried one other one before this, but it wasn't really one of  those grab a cup of coffee and go places. Buongiorno was exactly that. We got our well deserved Iced Coffee for the usual iced coffee price, and was it the best coffee in the world? Not really, but it was pretty decent, and it was cold, and after walking around in hot NYC it definitely was exactly what we needed at that moment. They also have sandwiches and little pastry things in case you need a snack, and an awkward door that links up with a salon type place next door--coffee and pastries goes with  getting your hair done right? ha ha But the service was nice, there are only two tables in here though pretty much, so don't roll in with a large group, cheers to Buongirono for getting us our coffee fix we needed so badly!",1,1,2

They poured water for me! They pushed their food pretty quickly but not aggressively. The latte was done quickly, and it was quite good.You kind of feel like you're in a hip diner, even though the food isn't diner-esque - the red leather stools make it feel like a diner.

There was no a/c, no breeze and the coffee machine had turned the place into a sauna.  When my friend arrived, she almost immediately wanted to go somewhere else...the only problem is she was stuck for time and there's not much nearby for breakfast. One good thing for them is that they seem to have the market cornered (pun intended)! So we sat and ordered what I think is the best cappuccino and croissant I've had in a very long time but sat without moving in order to enjoy the treat and hope to catch some semblance of a breeze from the barely open sliding door.  What gets me is that moments earlier I asked the counter guy why it was so hot in there and he basically waved it off as if he didn't know what I was talking about...then he turned around to make my coffee and the entire back of his shirt was sopping wet with sweat. I'm completely bewildered!Service...okay, friendly, fast.  They seem nice even when sweaty and sticky. Decor...modern, pretty, but nothing you wouldn't find elsewhere. Location: great for people watching.  Food: what I had was really tasty and the coffee was exceptional...and for that you get 3 stars.But the whole a/c thing was just plain stupid.",2,2,2

Don't get me wrong, I adore the peep booths and sloppy delis that dot the neighborhood, as well as the sprinkling of heroin addicts. But you can't get good espresso from a heroin addict, and peep booth milk is not good for your health. Buongiorno's quality is reminiscent of Zibetto Bar in midtown, but a bit more casual. The service is impeccable. The foam is just right (1/3 foam for cappuccinos--NOT the 10 lbs of foam you get at le Tarbucks). The biscotti are perfect. The morning croissants are perfect.

59,Mar L.,"New York, NY",5,35,0,4.0,5/13/2011,"Very friendly, warm staff. Courteous, GREAT coffee. Also faster than Starbucks, and of course 1000% better flavor. Not exactly cheap, but well worth it.",,,
60,Bonnie E.,"Manhattan, NY",450,81,0,5.0,3/13/2011,"The best espresso in Hell's kitchen!  As the owner says,""the coffee it goes straight to your heart"".  Everything here, pannini, biscotti, croissants is top quality with an attention to detail that you always hope for but seldom find.  Just go - you can thank me afterwards!",,,
61,Lori D.,"New York, NY",4,14,0,5.0,3/5/2010,"I can't say enough good about this wonderful place.  We just moved to this neighborhood and it was a relief to know that such good coffee drinks could be found just steps away.  My personal favorite is the Mocha, made with chocolate that can only be found in Italy.  This wonderful stuff also makes for a mean hot chocolate.What really impressed me most about this little shop is the owner, Lillianna.  She always has a smile for everyone who walks in.  And the cannoli are out of this world!",1,,1

63,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",1,14,1,4.0,12/19/2010,"Great and friendly service. Cappuccino tastes great (large is $4.50). There is no wi-fi, but the staff said that it should be available within 2 weeks. The bar table in the sitting area is quite narrow, so you might have some trouble if you bring your laptop there to work.",,,
64,David C.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,151,14,4.0,5/6/2010,"If you're stuck in the area (sandwiched between the Port Authority and the unbearably crowded and noisy stretch near B&H) looking for a quiet spot to relax and have a decent coffee, you could do a lot worse.  (A LOT worse.)",,1,
65,Euphrosini S.,"New York, NY",211,160,3,4.0,4/11/2010,"In an area known more for its selection of dollar slices and porn and not for its coffee, this place is a diamond in the rough.  A cute little coffee shop with quick friendly service. The owner - Eliana - is a friendly Greek lady that I'm working on adopting me.   It's a great alternative to the mile long line at the Starbucks or some random Deli.   Go.",,1,
66,Jen P.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,2/10/2013,My favorite quiet lunch/coffee apt in midtown. Bright and sunny with big windows and friendly service. Great iced coffee.,,,
67,Kate Y.,"New York, NY",12,37,0,4.0,8/11/2010,"This place is adorable.  The people who work here are so perky and sweet, you'd think you were in socal.  But in a good way.  Their coffee is pretty good, but I usually prefer it as strong and dark as the devil's sludge, so I'm knocking off a star, but I still think this is my new favorite coffee place for work.",,,
68,Cara K.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,8/28/2010,"Best espresso I've ever tasted!! The coffee is also of the highest quality, charming decor, friendly staff. I love going to Buongiorno!Their food is excellent. Everything is baked fresh every day. Make SURE to try their famous coffee cake.",,,
69,Kevin S.,"New York, NY",0,1,14,5.0,8/1/2010,"The first time I entered Buongiorno Espresso Bar I an immediate attraction for the bright refreshing decor that energized me. Then I was greeted by its  delightful owner and Wonderfully attentive staff. All the delightful aroma of spices sweet Pastries, teas and coffees filled my senses as I strolled to the warm Kitchen like front counter. As I looked above my head as well as to the left and to the right I notice several personal touches to the Interior decorating that accented the overall custom construction that sets this cafe from the rest. Too many cafes and espresso bars have an old drab sleepy look to them, finally something to look forward to before and after a hard day's work in the City.      As I ordered my favorite morning staple Cafe Mocha I noticed the care that went into preparing my cup using gourmet chocolate not some corner grocery store crap (like I an accustomed to) the frothy creme/ Milk was a perfect cap onto the extra large Cappuccino mug ceramic's better than paper cups) that was filled with my request. As I raised my cup up for a sip my stomach and pallet prepared for the first bitter mouthful of coffee, as it always does for the medicinal taste that gets me through till my mid day break, I was wonderfully surprised  to find a sweet , smooth utterly delightful cup of pure sunlight in a cup. This along with a delicious Italian Pastry was enough for me to contemplate calling in sick and taking a boat ride around the city. I began talking to strangers and smiling more, especially when I think of the Espresso bar. Now I frequent the spot every day to get my dose of sunshine from the espresso the pastries, food and creative drinks, and the wonderful staff and not to mention the unreserved,good natured well loved owner (who is a genuine Princess).",,,
