I want to give it 3 stars because of stupid Evan Weiss but since he is just a host or some crap I will excuse him and give 4 stars. Side note: They only serve nachos (if you are going to serve food at all, have more then one thing), 2: IDK who the hell Evan Weiss thinks he is but he SHHHHed me - who gets shhhed at a comedy club?? All I said was ""I love chocolate chip cookies"". I wasn't heckling a comedian or anything and this big ass rude guy stuck is damn finger in my face and shhhhed me after he was blocking my view half the night taking pictures but I didn't say anything about that. APPALLING.Overall, if Evan Weiss is not there, I would go back here. The comedians were decent. Drinks are great and decently priced for the city. Fun location regardless of the time you go there.",,,

However, last night I tried to get into Comedy Cellar, but they were filled to capacity. As we walked away in despair, I heard a woman say, ""comedy show, comedy show""-- you know those people you always see throughout Times Square.. Anyhow, since it was midnight, and surely wasn't going to find another place at this time. I bought tickets from her ($20 per ticket) and made my way over. The place is cozy, intimate, and dimly lit. The club was packed to capacity; and they played hip-hop until the show began around 12:40:I didn't find the majority of the comedians funny; most lacked any material-- they merely just interacted with the crowd. The emcee was good and the final comedian, Mike Britt--- basically everything else was a snooze.I probably wouldn't return; however, the tickets allow you to go for free to their second location in Times Square. I haven't determined whether I'll take them up on that option. I got a few laughs, which I appreciated, but this surely wouldn't be a first option.",4,3,4
3,Brandy G.,"Port Washington, NY",6,3,2,3.0,1/17/2018,"I've been to a few high caliber comedy clubs and the prices at this amateur place are the most ridiculous. Make sure you bargain down the ticket price. Make sure you're aware of the added gratuity. Make sure you're aware of their Yelp 50% off coupon. With that being said, these comedians are trying their best. Some are funny and some aren't. They're all trying to ""make it"" and I admire their ambition. We were there on a Wednesday so there were only like 10 people there. It was pretty awkward, but it ended up being a more personal experience. If you're a stand-up junky and want to see new, budding comedians test their material, this is the place for you. If you're a tourist or someone who wants to see the best of NY I do not recommend.",3,1,1
4,Kia A.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",1,203,1042,5.0,2/10/2018,"I bought a Groupon to this place for an amazing price. I made the reservation which you really do need because this place fills up.  The tables are super tight so this not the best place for a wider person. You also will be placed with strangers at tables or your table will be very close to strangers so if that is not your thing- this is not the place for you.The venue overall is small but at least there are two bathrooms! The comedians were good... some much better than others. I can't recall everyone's names but the comedians we liked most were the emcee, the young Santa Claus with the old father, the female former preschool teacher and the guy that  was on Kimmie Schmidt and a Geico commercial. As with most comedy clubs you will pay out the nose with their drink minimums. I went on February 10,2018 and a seltzer water from the soda dispensary was $6. The price was also $6 for bottled water. I was prepared for the exorbitant prices after reading yelp. The food menu is limited so don't come here for the food- unless you like nachos that much!! I didn't order nachos, but the people at the neighboring table did and it looked like ""nice try"" not yummy or amaze balls! I don't think I will come back here even despite the free ticket I got to come back (which was a part of my Groupon). The cost for drinks turned us off.Oh- this isn't the type of place you can hide from comedians so you're better off watching someone at Madison Sq Garden perform to preserve your anonymity than have it here!

Seriously. The host was brutal. The comedians were aimless. The room is filthy. The staff are rude. The comics suck and the comics are awful. Also none of the comics were very funny and I didn't laugh at any of the comics. The cattle herder who lead us in warned us that New York was dangerous and that we should be careful not to be taken advantage of. Then she took my money for a seat in this club.

Here the chairs were nice and spread out and the bathroom was easily accessible which was great because I always have to pee .  The best part is when I checked in on Yelp they gave me 50 percent off my drinks!

Updated review","It's a great room with great comics with legit credits (MTV, Comedy Central, HBO). If you're looking for a quality show, go here. The club's house show is on par with the cellar down the street and you never know who will pop in.Remember it's not supposed to be about aesthetics, it's not supposed to be sanitized. Real NYC comedy is supposed to be edgy and gritty. If you are a real comedy fan, not just a Netflix watcher, this is where you go. They have something for everyone. The early shows are privately produced shows with up and coming comics. You get to see more of the new talent that's out there, not just the same box of cornflakes you always get just because there's a tiger on the box.",,,
14,Shawn A.,"Windsor Locks, CT",6,43,53,3.0,6/24/2017,"This place had some really good stand up acts and a decent variety of beverages.  The host was hilarious and connected with the crowd between acts.  Overall the services that they offered were pretty good but the area where the show was held was rather cramped.  Also considering it was in a a basement, it smelled like what I would imagine mothballs mixed with mildew smells like.  I'd say it's worth it to come if you snag a Groupon (20$ for 2 tickets and 2 drinks).  Make sure to arrive early before the show since the seating arrangement is entirely first come first serve.",,,
15,Gary M.,"Yulee, FL",33,139,518,3.0,9/12/2015,This comedy club on McDougal is located in the basement giving that back in the day Greenwich Village vibe.Ryan Decalos comedy show featured a wide range of comics. Sean Ryan was outstanding and Ryan Decalos was funny.Some comedians were vvets and some were newbies but it was entertaining. Policy of two drinks.6pm show great value great fun.,2,,
16,C F.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,0,4.0,11/30/2017,Jocelyn Chia was off the hook last night and should have gotten more time on stage. She needs a bigger stage to perform her funny animated act. She's one to follow.  So happy I had the opportunity to see her.,,,1
17,A T.,"Irvington, NY",0,43,0,1.0,10/13/2017,"So I went last night with a group to this comedy club.  I love comedy!  The night started with waiting outside and like four comedians were talking with us.  We thought they were customers but they ended up being the comedians?  Before the show they were talking to us?  OK fine but I have never experienced that before.  So the show started and the MC was not funny but quite often he doesn't have to be.  He has a line up of comedians who are coming so he has complete backup!  However, it was just one after another of unfunny people.  How can like all eight or so comedians just not be funny?  There were very few laughs.  This is New York.  Can't they find more talent?  The MC was the tip off; older gentleman thinking the fact that two people on a second date there was a reason to have a good chuckle! Or a woman there in New York on business with a husband and three children was really cheating on her husband...ha ha!  So these are the kind of laughs to expect there.  Also the MC is important at these shows; the comedian's immediate connection to the audience.  Well it's no wonder they were hanging outside with us.  They don't connect with him either!  He introduced one by saying, ""Have you seen Jimmy Fallon?, Colbert?, Conan O'Brien? Well this next comedian has been on none of those.""Oh yes, just remembered how the MC asked someone if they had a stick up their butt.  So he was going for the crude joke if you even want to call it that, for shock value.  He got everyone to react, ""Wooooww."" like what a low blow he just got off of someone!  Well he finally made the crowd react but is that the reaction they are looking for at a comedy show?  I guess so at this venue!  So it seems they (he) are in frustrated territory not knowing what to say anymore for a laugh.There were very few laughs there all around and definitely better comedy clubs in New York.  This place was sadly nothing to laugh about.",2,,
18,Stacy M.,"New York, NY",0,106,3,2.0,3/26/2017,"Instead of going to this club, save your money, go to the Olive Tree Cafe (above the Comedy Cellar), and gawk at Dave Attell, Jim Norton, or Colin Quinn as they eat.

20,Majick L.,"Washington D.C., DC",1,25,0,1.0,10/9/2017,"Came here on Saturday for late show. Only half of comedians performingwere funny. Loved comedian in cowboy hat, his name escapes me. I've been here before and have had good experience which is why I came back. Will never revisit this place ever again.Comedian on stage for last act was complete asshole. White guy who went on some kind of rant and used ""n"" word 10x during act despite unease of Audience. Also used word F@**!! (To describe gays) And whore and cu** at several women in audience. Whole act was highly highly offensive and felt never ending. I'm not a prude and other comedians made fun of different races and women vs men yada yada but it was done in a light hearted manner. This act was very offensive and abrasive. ""Comedian"" was literally shouting at audience. lSince it was a late show I don't know if guy was drunk or what but I cannot support a business establishment that allows this kind of blasphemy. Very awkward afterwards. Even emcee following stated ""I think we're all going to need a support group after that performance."" Just very uncalled for. I'm so disappointed good night out ended this way. Still bothering me 2 days later.",1,,
21,Natalie E.,"Omaha, NE",158,343,939,4.0,5/10/2016,"Like others have said, it's a basement club that could use a good deep cleaning. But when you've got nothing to do on a Monday night, $20 for 2 tickets and 2 drinks is a pretty good bargain. I'd never heard of any of the comedians we saw, but out of the 8 or so that performed for us, at least 5 were quite funny. 2 of them were hysterical...I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of comedy we witnessed. The menu is somewhat overpriced for what you get, but that's to be expected. An import beer in a bottle will run you $9-10 and wells are about the same. We didn't try the food but it didn't look all that great. Others have bashed the service, but I found nothing to complain about. It was one guy and he was working hard to attend to all 15 of us in the club that night. On a Monday night, there weren't many of us in the audience, and it seemed that half of the group was stolen from the line at Comedy Cellar nearby. Overall I had a good experience, and enjoyed the cheap comedy. I'd recommend checking this place out for a low-budget night out and some good laughs.",2,,
22,Heather V.,"Bridgewater, NJ",83,193,23,2.0,2/27/2016,"This review is for the service experienced within the club. The comedians were hilarious and the headliner Clayton fletcher was a hoot. However, I felt so unwelcome. The guy collecting tickets at the door was frustrated because we said we were there to see multiple people, not just one comedian to check off his list. He rushed us in to sit and didn't give us the option to choose where. Turns out he was a comedian performing, so after being rude I wasn't so warm to his bit. The man taking drink orders was also rude. He rushed us to order our second round since it was a two drink minimum at 8-10$ a drink with 18% gratuity included. When collecting checks the busser lumped everyone's together then ran around providing cards back based on limited memory, almost giving me someone else's card. I couldn't enjoy the last act fully because I was so afraid he had given my debit card to someone else. My friend had to wait after the show to have her card returned. Cash always makes life easier.",4,,

There was even a Bollywood star in the audience the evening we went! One comedian -Howie - had me cracking up. I've seen him before at other comedy clubs in the village, and he never disappoints. If you love dives with character, this is the place to go!

This was the most painful experience of my life. One comedian (an older guy) was so drunk he was incoherent and impossible to understand. He was literally drooling as he was ""telling jokes"". The only thing we could understand was when he would say ""shut the fuck up"" to an audience member after asking them a question.Lawerence the host was decent as was one comic (out of about 8 drawn out sets). On top of that we opted for the ""unlimited"" non-alcoholic beverages and nachos for our drink minimum. We were served only one drink and the nachos were disgusting looking. I much rather have given the 80 dollars we spent overall to a homeless person than waste it on this show, or maybe buy Lawrence a drink as he seemed cool.",1,1,1

Despite almost unlimited options, the host insisted on seating us to the side of the stage... where the stage light glared right into your eyes and painfully blinded you. Why would such retina destroying seats even be an option? We asked to be reseated and he tried to stick us into really tight seats right at the front of the stage... I'm 5'2"" average build and I couldn't comfortably get into them! We ended up picking out our own seats anyway, and I got the sense that he was irked by that. He was also performing later that night, and his humor was unintelligent and, well, just not humor. The ambience was that dark, dank, sticky, dirty bar with the permanent stench of beer, vomit, and cleaner hanging in the air. The mandatory drinks were awful. I opted for the all you can drink virgin drinks... All you can drink is a joke because they only offer to refill once when they come sniffing around for everyone's mandatory 2nd drink order.I came to see one friend of a friend who was top notch. Otherwise, everyone else, including the headliner, was just an absolute nightmare to sit through. A bunch of privileged millenials joking from viewpoints that are narrow and largely ignorant.And last straw... Someone pooped on the floor of the bathroom.

29,Cassi W.,"Kihei, HI",117,6,2,2.0,9/30/2016,"I'll start out by saying yes, this is a small basement comedy club. And yes, they do require a two drink minimum. We knew that going into it and were totally okay with that. The service was adequate. Not bad, not great. Just a one guy going around taking drink orders. We went there on a Saturday night, so I guess my expectations were a little high. After tax and fees I ended up paying $66 for two tickets (not including the mandatory drinks). There were about 12 people in the venue at the beginning of the show and a few more trickled in during the warm up so I would say that we had probably about 20 people total for the show. As with any assortment of comedians, some were pretty funny, and some were not. The hostess was really good and engaging. Other than the price, my main complaint is that there were really distracting people. There were two tables of people that were talking amongst themselves throughout the ENTIRE show. My recommendation would be for the venue to enforce a no talking policy. I've been to other venues that have a very strict 1 warning system before they ask groups to leave. This would have been great in this situation. Several of the comedians even stopped their performances to ask to these groups to stop talking, but they never did. In such a small setting, something like this really is a deal breaker. Overall, would I go back? Nope. Between the tickets and almost $20/person extra for mandatory drinks AND a tip it wasn't worth it when there were people talking and interrupting the comics all night. If you get a really good deal on tickets, and have a better crowd it would be fine. But there are much more enjoyable ways to spend $100 in NYC.",3,,1

The club let in a 12 and 13 year old... All the comics kept fixating on the fact that there were children there... Odd since they were talking about R-rated topics. This was very annoying.One of the veteran comics was just plain racist. Aggressively racist and no one was laughing. It was honestly uncomfortable.I left this place feeling crappy. If you find the following funny: rape, racism - particularly against Islamic & Jewish people, or poorly timed and delivered comedy then maybe this place is for you.

45,Brian B.,"Metuchen, NJ",19,34,0,1.0,6/6/2015,"It seems that I came the same night as Kapil A. (June 1)  I am not sure why they let two children in or why the parents brought the kids, but it was awkward for the patrons and comedians.   The highlights - Nick Alexander the host was on point all night and Petey DeAbreu killed. A younger comic who had an act centered around his Russian family in Connecticut, who sadly is not listed on the Comedy Club's website, was subtle and hilarious.  In fact, all was well until the racist veteran comic's set.  Few of the later comics picked up on the fact that the crowd wasn't into their racist jokes.  One comic intimated that his German date would like to put him into a brick pizza oven, which was not funny and was in bad taste.  A similarly offensive joke centered on a friend crashing planes into the comic.  Even more problematic was that a number of comics persisted to deploy racist jokes targeted of the audience members from the Middle East.  No one laughed because these jokes were not funny, but apparently many of the comics felt the need to rehash these racist comments.  Maybe they were testing the crowd to see how much racism would be tolerated.  Whatever the reason, they failed.  In short this was bad form.  If no one is laughing its not because they don't get the joke, its because its a bad joke - move on to a new topic.  Being a good comic means being quick on your feet and most of the comedians performing on June 1 showed that they could not adapt.  Too bad.  Nick and Petey did a great job warming the crowd up, but the later comics couldn't close the deal.",3,2,2

Because he wants to get you in the door. I had to stand because I came late. Understandable. But the waiters flat out refused to sell me drinks. Because I didn't have a table and he couldn't remember where to put my bill in.  I was eventually given a seat (no table though) because I was standing in front of the kitchen so I convinced the bartender to serve me but i had to listen to 40 mins of mediocre comics sober and that's not funny. Out of the 12 comics about 4 were genuinely funny. Per other reviews that seems to be the general percentage.

We stood up and he said oh you doing?We said I was sorry we have to leave now we been here for a long time.And we went out the door.It's like being held comedy hostage.I would probably go to the place underneath the Olive tree restaurant.

Bought the tickets on the street normally $20 each, and worked the guy down to $10 each. The venue is very intimate, we went on a Sunday night so only 13 people came to the show; they sat us all right in front of the tiny stage.There is a $15 drink minimum (each drink is $8-10 and they don't have a wide selection), which they don't tell you when you buy the tickets, and a couple sitting across from us was told 2 drinks came with each ticket purchase. The guy fought them for it when asked to pay and he never came back for the rest of the show.Get ready to be made fun of, it's one thing to call out 1-2 audience members to get going, but when you have to pick on each and every person and don't actually have any jokes it gets old. Plus, if the comedian has to laugh at his own jokes to get the audience to laugh, you're probably not funny.If you're a sensitive person definitely don't come here, 90% of the jokes are stereotypical racist, sexist, overweight, and vulgar. It seemed like the only people laughing were the other comedians performing that night. If you're a woman, they will harass you and act like you're coming home with them at the end of the show. Needless to say, some people walked out mid-show.There were only 1-2 acts that were good, and we were wondering how they got in this line up.Before it's over they bring out everyone's bill which already includes 18% Tip, which it says on the menus, but they ask for tip on top of that on the receipt.

Updated review","I went back. I did not contact the owner who commented on my last review, the revisit was impromptu. I have to say, either I had a really bad experience last time, or they have done a lot to improve the place. The comic quality was much better this time around. The selection was more varied in the acts and that helped make a much better experience.I will note that when I went last time the cover was $10 per person and this time it was $20 per person + a 2 item minimum. This is fairly standard in the business though. They did have a great feature...I don't drink but they have a $15 non-alcoholic drink package which includes water or soda (i'm not sure if there is a limit to it, but I had 3 sodas with no issue) and also includes a plate of chips with nacho cheese sauce. It was gourmet (think 7-11 nachos) but I appreciated it and thought it was a nice touch. That package is a good value.All in all, I was much more pleased this time around. Great job.",1,1,
60,Katie I.,"Nashville, TN",138,364,1025,3.0,7/4/2014,"We were approached by a man on the street for tickets as we were en route to the Comedy Cellar. He told us it was sold out and their show started in a few minutes. We said what the heck, paid $20 each and were crammed at a table with a bunch of students and their professor. Note: Once I checked in on Yelp- there was an unlock deal buy one get one free. Darn it! Could've saved $20. The host was great getting the room engaged. There were about 6 different comics. They all had different styles and talents. One of the black guys was hilarious. He started in on people in the crowd. I was dying laughing.The lowpoint was the drink minimum is $15 a person. We had already been drinking all night elsewhere, so we opted for daiquiris to get to our minimum more quickly than beer. OMG it tasted like a virgin daiquiri at a concession stand in a tiny plastic clear solo cup. The server was so busy and aloof because she knew she was getting paid whether she did anything or not. I asked her about 10 times for a water. She definitely had attitude. All in all it was a fun time, but I don't know if I'd go back to this one. However, the yelp deal is quite attractive, especially if Comedy Cellar is sold out.",2,,
61,Toobet L.,"Portland, OR",0,61,1,2.0,10/6/2015,"You can find a lot better clubs.  The talent is hit or miss.  The cover and menu is expensive.  If you want a cheaper alternative, usually there are kids in the neighborhood throwing ""free"" comedy nights at other bars.  There is no cover, but at least one drink is required.  Sure they might not be that funny, but it won't cost you 80 bucks like this place.",1,1,1

66,Minnie R.,"New York, NY",38,38,17,4.0,10/29/2013,"First, to address some of the flak this place has received:A two-drink minimum is really not uncommon for small clubs and venues, especially when you're there for some kind of performance or event. As a neighborhood business, it is necessary for them to have an 18% gratuity included in the check to keep things running smoothly and make sure the servers' hard work is appreciated. For an event space, the food and drink prices are actually fair and reasonable.Secondly, as far as the comedy acts are concerned, it's usually an eclectic mix. And again -- this is the case with any comedy club, not just the place being reviewed. The comedians cater to various tastes and demographics. It isn't until you've attended an act or two that you start to pick your favorites among the routines. Then it's a matter of going back on nights when your favorite comedian is scheduled to perform.

The audience wasn't very receptive, since you actually are supposed to make people laugh first, so that spiraled downhill to the point where everybody was just getting increasingly uncomfortable. The place itself is very bare-bones and cheap-looking, and the 2 drink minimum does not help when the bar has very little to offer.

His set was really entertaining and I did not stop laughing. There were four other comedians who were not so bad too. I have to say overall I had a great time laughing. The comedians did not pick on me or the audience that much - which is good considering I went there with my ex boyfriend who got up in the middle of the show to go ""smoke a cigarette"" but really went to the porn store around the block and came back to the club thirty minutes later with a bundle of cock lollipops.

85,Kim H.,"Falls Church, VA",444,472,580,4.0,2/6/2014,"After a mishap with our reservations at the Comedy Cellar, we were hustled into buying some tickets to this club.  On the weekend it was 20 bucks plus a 2 drink minimum ($9 bucks for crappy beer should give you an idea of how much to expect).  The location is a dark, dirty, dingy, creepy basement with only a tiny stage with a bright spot light.  Remember that movie Hostel? Umm yeah, I was just waiting for someone to pop out with a chainsaw.  Lucky for me, this is how I like my comedy clubs!  I've been here twice now and both times were pretty damn funny.  There were about 6-7 diverse comedians per show and we experienced everything from ""meh"" to ""omg my face hurts from laughing so hard"".  If you are sensitive I wouldn't recommend this place.  It's a very intimate venue, meaning you are literally a few feet away from the comics and they WILL pick on any and everyone in the audience.",4,2,1
86,Yvette S.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,0,4.0,10/5/2014,Had a great laugh here.  The venue is very small but we had a good time. Some comedians were funnier than others but overall we had a good experience.,1,,

89,Shelby N.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,55,0,3.0,4/25/2013,"This was my first attendance to a comedy show ever in the history of my lovely self, and so I was really excited. The guy tried to sell the tickets at like forty bucks and I was all like ""Noooooo"" and then he was all like "" Twenty for two tickets"" and I was all ""Yayyyy.So we get inside and the place is small and I guess one could even say intimate. I think there were like five comedians for the line up and for me all but two were funny. They pick on the audience quite a bit which was fine for me, but what annoyed the living crap out of me was each comedian asking where everyone was from.....Seriously were you not sitting in the audience watching the last act who asked that same exact question....???????The menu wasn't impressive, but than again I don't typically expect gourmet cuisine when I walk into my local McDonald's either.There is a two drink minimum PER person which to be honest I think is complete bullshit. You're going to spend more money on the drinks than what you pay to get into the show.My friend wasn't impressed so we got free tickets for another show. I will give it a second chance, but if I am being honest, if it werent for the free tickets, I wouldn't be going back. There is going to be a new lineup so hopefully I will be falling out of my seat laughing my ass off like the wasted girl sitting across from me was. Now She was entertaining.",2,7,1
90,Michoel T.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,0,1.0,9/1/2013,"Came here last night, a couple comedians were ok but the rest are pretty bad but what makes it worst was the lack of crowd control.

92,Stan D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,0,1.0,2/25/2013,Went on a Saturday night packed to the brim with unfunny amateur comedians who did embarrassingly bad crowd work. I've been to better free comedy shows! Drink selection is lacking.  Cramped and awkward interior. Go anywhere else in NYC.,6,,
93,Kevin G.,"Buffalo, NY",0,1,0,4.0,8/10/2014,"Tried going to Comedy Cellar on a saturday night without reservations and surprise surprise they were sold out.  As we were walking away some guy on a street corner claimed he was selling tickets to a comedy show down the street and so my friend and I talked to him for a minute and ultimately decided to get 2 tickets for $20 each to the Greenwich Comedy Club rather than go home defeated.A quick yelp search after buying the tickets at first made us think we had made a big mistake but we decided to give the place a chance anyway.  When we got in to the basement it was a bit more grimy than expected which didnt help alleviate our fears for a bad night, and we found that the 2 drink minimum per person was actually a $15 dollar minimum.  2 bud lites will run you $16 here which is a bit outrageous but I guess thats to be expected.  Those who dont drink can spend $15 for all you can drink soda/water and a plate of awful looking nachos.As for the actual comedy, I hated the MC/Opener, but she was followed by 6 comedians who ranged from average (but still funny) to hilarious.  The comedy did not disappoint and overall both my friend and I had an excellent evening.  The show ran from 10:30-12:15, which I felt was a really fair amount of time.  Nothing seemed to drag on and it didnt feel like anyone got whisked off the stage too fast.  The only other complaint I had was they asked the audience to tip at the end of the night, and if you werent paying attention you probably wouldn't have noticed that gratuity was already included on your check.  Its fine to include gratuity on the check, but to explicitly ask for a tip on top of that for average service seems deceiving, and I was not a fan of that.  But overall I had a really great time, and would definitely come back.",,,

97,Julie O.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,3,0,1.0,2/24/2013,"I literally had the worst time of my life here. My boyfriend and I were walking down the street when we get bombarded by a man convincing us to buy these tickets, in which case he makes it sound like we're buying tickets for the Comedy Cellar, as soon as we pay him we realize it's for the Greenwich Village Comedy Club. At first we think, okay, this might not be so bad...but then quickly realized we have just been jipped. We go back to him less than 5 minutes later and he denies us our money back saying there are ""no refunds"". Talk about just wanting your money. This was on a Thursday night.So we end up going to a show on a Saturday night. The tickets are 5 dollars that night, and we payed 15 dollars to this dude on the street. Horrible management, seriously. If you're going to hire people and have them sell tickets down the block at least have it be a deal. This made us even more annoyed at this place.We get in and get seated right next to the stage and watch some of the lamest comedy we have ever seen. Sure, comedy clubs are only as good as their comedians but we really went on a bad night. There is a two drink minimum and as soon as the comedy is over you pay your bill then leave immediately. It was a very odd and uncomfortable experience.On top of that it seems like all the comedians have nothing else to joke about other than picking on people in the audience. It really gets sad once you've left the place and every comedian has literally said to everyone in the front rows ""So, you in a relationship?"". Seriously, these are just sad acts. I've seen loads of free comedy shows that have been amazing almost every time. This really was not worth my time. But I guess now it's just something to talk about when someone asks me ""Where should I go watch some comedy in NY?"" - ""Definitely not this place.""I will say it, this place sucks. I will definitely not be coming back here ever again.",3,,
98,Carl D.,"New York, NY",11,29,0,1.0,10/23/2014,"I'll start by suggesting my experience here was far from funny. I went here one night to meet friends and watch a friend of a friend perform standup. Before entering I was greeted on the street by the usual guys asking me if I like comedy and to come into the club. I told them thanks but I was going in anyway. When I tried to walk in the door, I felt it kept being pushed back. Huh? A guy then appeared through a narrow hole and asked what I wanted. Hmm, this place looks like a basement comedy club and acts like an elite celebrity club. OK. I asked if I could come in as I was meeting people and he asked my name. Huh? He then asked who I was there to see, like the act's name. I told him I would look for it on my phone, and then got bored with the whole game. I texted my friends to meet me after the show. Who knew a place like this could exist on MacDougal. Either way, I went around the corner to one of my local bars and sipped on an Old Fashioned. Much better.",4,2,1

Trust me when I say you will have a blast.  People who complain about the pricing lets remember a few things; 1. It's NYC. 2. It's a comedy club and 3. Your out for a fun evening so splurge and laugh! It's good for the heart.",1,1,

I hate the venue but the acts were pretty decent. As the only asians in the entire crowd, me and my gf got made fun of quite a bit. As a surprise, we had a random guest appearance from Judah Friedlander who was hilarious! Two drink minimum and the menu is rather sparse. Comedy Cellar down the street is still wayyy better.",3,,1

Cowboy comic, sassy big girl (loved her! think her name was Yamaneeka. Funny girl! Take that Jerry Lewis!), Allan Finn (keep your eyes on this one. he has star quality like I've never seen) and Mike Britt who had people literally convulsing with laughter. He knew how to work the crowd and his improv skills were up there with Robin Williams. Go. Don't think twice. Seriously. The only negatives I have are the bathrooms (I'm a bathroom snob) and the food was only OK enough to tide you over but nothing I'd go out of my way to order if I wasn't already at the show. It's not as fancy schmancy as Gotham or Carolines but I prefer the NYC basement clubs. Comedy is meant to be an intimate experience. Truly a wonderful time.",,,
105,B I.,"MIDDLE VLG, NY",0,170,0,3.0,6/22/2013,"I went here on Friday night, which is probably the busiest night for comedy clubs. We were approached by one of the comedians on the street and since we actually wanted to go to a comedy club and because our destination of choice was sold out we decided to take a chance with this place.Atmosphere - 4.5 - I really like the set up. It's nothing special or too original, but just like a comedy club should be. It's small, dark space with all the tables close to each other. You are very close to the comedians and the comedian pick almost on everyone.Food/Drinks - 3 - they have a two drink minimum (almost all such establishments do). We opted for food and a drink. The drinks are between $8-12. $8-9 for beers. $10-12 for liquor and cocktails. The food was very average bar food, but more reasonably priced.Comics - 3 - Only two comics were truly funny. They had original jokes and kept us entertained almost the whole time they were on. The host was pretty funny at times. The other comics had their moments, but i would rate them as average. I would think that they would put their best line up on the busiest night, but also understand that line ups in this business vary. I generally enjoyed the show, but feel like it could be better.Value - 3 - Obviously, drinks are overpriced. On Fridays, entrance is about $20 unless you find a discount at the last minute.  I would recommend opting out to visit on Sun - Thu when tickets are cheaper. I think this place is pretty chill, but needs one or two more really good comics.",,,

Funny how one user said about Allen Finn that he was pitching tickets like the place has no people in there. Place was packed and there was still people trying to get in although there was no seats available lma0 if you cant afford 10 dollars or 15 dollars and 2 drinks and beg for a refund I'm sorry than you should be watching comedy at McDonald's dollar menu or perhaps at home.

We purchased a few tickets for $20 each ($80 total) for a 10:30 show for Saturday night from a merchant (he supplied us with all the information of the comedians/comediennes performing that night) on the street who took only cash even though he and his colleagues had card-swiping devices and said that the suggested time that we should arrive was 10:15. We were running late and the security who stopped us at the door didn't even look as if they worked at the establishment; they were hanging out on the curb of the street. At this time it was 10:40 and the security said that because we were late our seats were sold to other patrons and they refused to give us a refund. My friend pointed out that there's no time on the tickets, no notification saying that we HAD to be there at any specific time and accuses of them of false advertisement. They refused to get the manager then I phoned the police to report the petty theft situation. The security tried to antagonize us; kept asking ""where you from?"" At some point the establishment workers scurried to find the street merchant who sold us the tickets and we got our money back. I was disappointed that we didn't get to see the show, which included Calise Hawkins from the TV show known as Funny Girls on the Oxygen channel, but more disappointed of being swindled.
