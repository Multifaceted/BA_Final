0,Rafaela R.,"New York, NY",300,7,5,5.0,10/4/2018,"This is my favorite Pret. The employees there are super nice and one of them even remembers my name when I walk in. Sometimes I've seen them give ""employee"" discounts or a free coffee just because. When I've come in to redeem a reward coffee through the app, they've allowed me to order the latte option when I didn't know it was just for plain coffee. They are the chic-fil-a of coffee shops when it comes to serving their customers :)",,,1
1,Ted G.,"Raleigh, NC",8,105,127,1.0,7/7/2018,"We stopped in for lunch, the selection was currently limited for sandwiches. The option for a hot sandwich does not apply to every sandwich available on the shelves. The cashier offered a hot sandwich that was out of stock, he then offered to heat up the sandwich we already chose as a result and his co worker refused to heat the sandwich up and argued that fact with his co worker in front of customers. There is only one bathroom which apparently has a typical line to wait in and it's unisex so plan ahead for a wait. The customer service in this establishment is lacking considerably, I would recommend dining elsewhere.",,,
2,Olaedo E.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",20,74,59,5.0,8/16/2018,"I love this Pret location. I come here every morning to get my coffee and sometimes breakfast sandwich and the employees are all so friendly and helpful. I love their egg white and mushroom sandwich on brioche bun, as well as their selection of salads and soups. If they're out of something, they come and refill or make you a fresh one.",,,1
3,Hitarth S.,"New York, NY",20,4,0,5.0,10/10/2018,Great customer Service! Alejandro is a great store manager. They have great quality of food. I got there daily for hot/fresh breakfast. I am very happy with this location,,,
4,Anne B.,"Covina, CA",0,14,6,1.0,8/8/2018,"One of the worst customer service ever. We would have given a -5 but we can't. We will give 1 for now. Manager was standing by an watching while employee at makes a mistake with a purchase and denies it. Laughs at the customer and later changes his story. Customer walks away and manager approaches them to apologize??? The weirdest people on earth! I wouldn't recommend this place! Think twice! They will say they have your purchase even if they didn't! Hey, if that worked one time they think it would work for everyone right? Good luck to you! Stay away, you've been warned!",,,
5,Joe K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,8/13/2018,"You can't hear yourself think in there and the staff is pretty rude. They can't be bothered helping you or even answering questions. There are so many other places to eat in that area, so I'll stick with anyplace but this one!",,,
6,John G.,"Manhattan, NY",36,56,5,2.0,9/14/2017,"Food is ok but the music is WAY too loud. If I didn't have really powerful headphones and earplugs with me, I woulda gone straight to the Wasabi across the street, who also have ready-to-eat food in abundance.",1,,
7,L K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,43,2,5.0,1/18/2018,Hey nice staff person was so pleasant after a full day of meetings. Â Nice to relax. And I like the music,1,,1
