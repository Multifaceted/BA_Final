Bar seats maybe ten people.  Rest of the room is set up like a lounge with a mix of sofas stools and chairs. Mostly low tables.",,,
1,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,614,3.0,11/13/2018,"I don't frequent the clerb scene, but on Halloween, I make a special exception. After our Halloween booze cruise didn't work out due to a torrential downpour, a group of friends and I were searching for things to do despite of the weather. We found a Groupon for entrance to Monarch Rooftop - $11 per person for entry (no drinks included which is fair for the price). The Groupon made it easy for us to skip the pesky line out front which was a really nice perk.The music was a nice mix of Top 40 and hip-hop which we definitely appreciated. The crowd was also not as young as I thought it would be which was a plus in my book. The views from the rooftop also reign supreme. If you're trying to exit the clerb, beware of the line (apparently there's one line for the exit and bathroom COMBINED which I thought was weird).All in all, a solid place to sport your costume and do a little Halloween partying.",3,2,3
2,Melissa K.,"Glen Head, NY",0,21,0,3.0,9/30/2018,"The food and views really were great! We had great weather and seeing the sunset near the Empire State Building really was nice. The music was ok.. it was all Bruno Mars. The food is a little overpriced for appetizers/small plates, but I understand you're paying for the views and atmosphere. We ordered chips and guac, a tiny pizza, and some boneless wings, one soda and the bill was $62. The customer service was so unimpressive. The hostess at front was sweet and sat us near the bar on these tiny little sofas to eat. Our server was nice but they are just so busy that they take the orders and run. The food runners had to be the strangest...they would come, drop the food, and run like you had a disease. No smile, no response to our thank yous, zero eye contact. Just so odd.",,,
3,Tara W.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",18,104,274,5.0,10/25/2018,Amazing place to go grab drinks. We went there as two of our friends were leaving New York City for good and threw party here. The place is huge spacious outside and enough space inside too. It's beautiful place with two bars inside one and outside one. We got bottle services one after the other. We went there around 10pm and were there till 2am. The music is great. The heat in the bathroom was great and hot but the line for bathroom was long and they have single bathrooms and I think they have 5-6 bathrooms. We got food too and they were good. The dress code is I think like all the other clubs. When we went there around 10 was quite empty and it started getting really crowded. Over all we enjoyed the night. Shall go again.,1,,
4,Neha K.,"Cambridge, MA",396,94,307,3.0,7/30/2018,"Great views but customer service could be improved. I came here with two girlfriends and felt as if we were taken less seriously because we are all 21/22. I ordered an Angry Orchard Rose and went it arrived, it was only lukewarm, not chilled. The waitress said she would try and find a colder bottle but never came back or followed up. Additionally, most NYC rooftops have expensive cocktails, but the drinks here in particular seemed costly for the amount that you are getting. When we were leaving, the waitress circled the suggested tip amount on the receipt, ranging from 18%-22%, which I always find to be a bit impolite. In the future, I will probably stick to the other rooftops in the area that have both good views and respectful service.",4,2,
5,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1723,618,4315,5.0,6/26/2018,"I loved my visit to this rooftop bar. We came kinda spur of the moment on a beautiful Saturday . They check your IDs at the bottom before you get on an elevator . Thank God there was no line at the time .We got upstairs quicklyIt's a trendy rooftop bar - part of it is inside with outside seating The view of the Empire State is GORGEOUS. I would advise for you to make reservations ahead of time to get an outside seating and at particular times like sunsets :) We were able to get a table inside for about an hour before a reservation would come . We only came to check this place out and have a cocktail. You could grab small bites here. We all enjoyed out drinks except one person. She orders the Peach Perfect was said it was too light. Two other friends ordered the "" All the Way up"" which came with watermelon slices. Looked real good. They loved it but it was ok to me. I had the "" strawberry fields"" and that came in a tiki inspired glass. I enjoyed it. Drinks are pricey here $15-18 per pop. But it's trendy and you have a great view Music plays in the background Would definitely come back again :)",15,5,11

As soon as our drinks were about to be empty, there was our server asking if we wanted another, same thing or to try something else.  She also made sure we had waters, and that we were having a good time.  At no point were we rushed out of our table, to buy a bottle, or keep buying drinks fast.  We enjoyed our time there, soaking in the NYC party crowd on our first night there and it could not have been more perfect.As we had other plans for the night, we did not stay as long as we would have liked but for sure a place I would visit again.",6,2,6

The drinks were good but expensive at the same time. It is Manhattan so it is always a possibility.I love the set-up of their rooftop because in addition to the outside area you can also walk into the covered part of the venue so you have a option.The bottle service itself and the servers were very professional and kept our cups full the entire time.Will be returning during hot days throughout the summer",1,,

10,Aya E.,"Elk Grove, CA",578,432,1051,3.0,7/5/2018,"First stop in NYC and of course, I had to hit up a rooftop! I have never been to Monarch before but after seeing pictures of the views, I had to check it out. I stopped by during the daytime and it wasn't too busy. There were people on the rooftop but it wasn't at all crowded like it would most likely be in the evening/night.The rooftop itself is medium sized, compared to others I've been to. While enjoying the rooftop, I decided to get a Frosé (~$19). Honestly, that's super expensive for a drink, in my opinion. But it was a hot day, and we weren't too hungry at the time. And I'm glad we weren't. The party next to us ordered food and they looked so disappointed when the food came out. I noticed that the portions were tiny. Like bite sized. It didn't correlate with the prices. When I got my Frosé, I was also disappointed to see that it came in such a small glass. For almost a $20 drink, I just expected a little more.After I finished my drink, we didn't stay for long. We took some pictures (at least the view is solid) and we were on our way. I don't think I'd come back here personally; the view was good but the rest of my experience was mediocre.",3,,

We decided to check out Monarch and the view was absolutely gorgeous. The set up of the rooftop bar with the white couches was so beautiful and it added on to the view. My boyfriend and I ordered some drinks and some appetizers. We had the shrimp pizza which I think was pretty good but my boyfriend wasn't so crazy about. Of course I had to order the truffle fries which surprisingly did not have much truffle so that was a bit upsetting. As far as drinks, he ordered mojitos and I ordered the dark kiss I think it was called and it was sooooo good. Good enough for me to get 3 of them! I'd definitely recommend coming here for the drinks but I'd pass on the food. Also the price is a bit toooooo much but you can't expect less for the city. The service was pretty good too so I have no complaints about that.",1,,

We had a really nice seat, with view of the Empire State Building! Amazing I had an Absolut Smash cocktail and it was the BOMB! For $16 a cocktail, I was hoping for a little more in the glass but the little bit I did receive was amazing. One of the best cocktails I had in my life. We wanted to try the truffle fries but the fryer was sadly broken, so we settled on the margarita flatbread. The $20 price point was way too much for it. It tasted quite bland and I was a little disappointed. It's a nice rooftop bar to visit in NYC and worth to give a try.",2,1,3

21,Cait B.,"New York, NY",80,45,95,3.0,6/15/2018,"This rooftop is directly across from my office, and I would come so much more often, except for the fact that they never have any food or drink specials. Ever. The one time I thought I was in luck with an email offering a free cocktail, it expired by the time I arrived and there was no expiration date listed in the email - until I was there already and clicked a link that said redeem. So disappointed and I kind of feel like they just wanted to get me in the door. A glass of wine is around $15 which is a little crazy, cocktails understandable are usually $17, and beer is a pricey $8-10. Too much for no specials.All that aside I have had a very pleasant experience every time I'm here. The door people are usually a little weird and act like you are crazy if you don't have a reservation, which you never actually need - but as soon as you get to the bar the bartenders and waitresses are so friendly and conversational. I had an absolutely amazing cocktail back in the fall season, but their cocktail menu is seasonal so it was sadly discontinued. The view is also incredible- I came on 9/11 and the view of the empire lit up in red, white, and blue was breathtaking. You most likely need to call ahead for tables facing south with view of Empire, but there is also seating on the west side of building that is usually open. I've never had an issue getting a seat at the bar after work (probably because at 5PM everyone is at places with happy hour).Definitely worth checking out for their amazing view and tasty cocktails!",1,,
22,Viviann L.,"Manhattan, NY",199,961,3813,3.0,9/17/2018,"Nice rooftop bar, it'd give it a 3.5 because the bartenders are decent..did make the wrong thing once but the rest is good. The female bartender made the drinks a bit sweeter than the male bartender even if it's the exact same thing so not as consistent. A bit on the pricier side but it's alright. Nice atmosphere, decent music, you can see the Empire State Building which is nice. Close to k-town and subway station at walking distance so it's really convenient. A few tables but gets pretty crowded. Good if you made reservations first. They stop making speciality cocktails after 10pm so there's two menus. I personally really like their peach perfect. Their Apple martini is good too. Bellini and tequila sunrise are fine. Personally, not a fan of the Paloma",,,

24,Lilly T.,"West Islip, NY",26,21,44,3.0,8/25/2018,It's alright. Nothing special. The music was basic af. The dj basically played like top 40 pop songs on repeat. It felt like I was listening to the radio. It's on the smaller side and gets cramped real quick. The two bartenders that were working on the inside portion were a bit rude. They were favorable towards the men who gave them huge tips. I was waiting patiently at the bar and she took two other guys before me who arrived after me. One guy started flirting with her and gave his number and a huge 20$ tip. I get it but still he courteous towards others. I paid 38$ for 3 drinks - total rip off.,1,,
25,Holly M.,"New York, NY",152,19,60,5.0,9/5/2018,"I own a small touring company in manhattan, and i brought several out of town guests here on a weekend Bar tour. As it was our first stop, we figured we would only be here about an hour, for one drink. Well!! First off, when we arrived our table was already ready for us. Being that it was in the middle of July, we decided we wanted to sit indoors instead of out ( or I should say in the shade :) the hostess was so accommodating and kind, happily gave us a new table, and it was absolutely perfect! The waitstaff was incredibly kind, and helpful, and we ended up trying most of the menu.Their drinks are delicious, the views perfect, and the atmosphere was calm and cool. Perfect, not overly pretentious as some paces are, and had an array of individuals from people who probably just came form the gym to dressed up patrons. Enough that no matter who you were, you felt like you belonged! This was a Saturday afternoon, so I have no idea what it was like in the evenings, but there was a DJ and it looked as if they were setting up for a luau or a special event. They even allowed us to try some of the cocktails that would be out for the event :) This was the perfect way to kick off the weekend, and I would absolutely go back and or recommend  this place!",,,
26,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,4.0,3/26/2018,"Came here for my friends birthday on a Saturday and was the first one to show up. When I said his name at the door they advised me that I was the first and for me to head on up and enjoy myself.  I was honestly and pleasantly surprised by their response but gladly took the guy with the clipboard up on it.  When you walk in you'll be asking to wait to the left before getting ID and waiting for the elevator.  When you get off the elevator it takes you right to their small entrance where you are greeted by a hostess with a smile.  This place is beautiful with two bars that have seating available and private seating areas for those who want a table and service.  The music was blasting mostly with today's top hits and hip hop.  At 10pm they remove all the chairs from the bar area to get people up and dancing. Drinks are reasonably priced and not too bad considering the location of the rooftop.  Dress code didn't seem too strict but most people there were dressed nicely.  The outside roof deck is nice with a breath-taking view.  This place is great for birthdays, dates and those who just wanted to party it up for a night.   Friendly service, beautiful girls, good music and a fun atmosphere makes this place one of the better rooftops to enjoy in the city.  I recommend getting there earlier than you usually would for a club to avoid the long line.    I'll be back Monarch Rooftop Lounge........",4,,1

I went with a party of about 25 (booked a couple days in advance) and we had our own couch/chairs and table to ourselves. The view is amazing and on a nice night it is hoppin'. The staff and security were very friendly and accommodating. The prices were *a little pricey*. A regular margarita (very good) was $11 and a double was $22 (probably triple the regular size). Would highly recommend for a night out in NYC!,1,,1

31,Fatema N.,"New York, NY",10,49,39,1.0,9/30/2018,"My friends and I had the most HORRIBLE experience here. We came here to celebrate w friends birthday party at around 11:30PM. Due to the long line, a couple of us had bought some McDonalds to eat while waiting. Before we even got to the front of the line, one of the bouncers approached us yelling with a absolutely nasty attitude saying we couldn't get in and there was nothing we could do about it. When my friends asked why, he disrespectfully said he would have considered it had we not had the McDonald's. That is absolutely NO reason because eating food should stop have been a problem to begin with. We then realized he was racially profiling us because someone previously on the line of color was rejected and he automatically assumed we were with them. Another woman from inside came down and she asked him: what's the problem here? And he continued to complain about the McDonald's and she literally asked him: well did you even look at their IDs? He literally had not checked any of our IDs or anything. We even complained and said the rest of our party is upstairs, but his attitude just continued to get worse. The worst part was that there was another black bouncer then and when we asked him how he's okay with them racially profiling us, he said he has nothing to do with this and couldn't help us. WHAT KIND OF AN EXCUSE? Absolutely disgusting. Truly a horrible experience because our whole group came out from the deep end of Long Island for this, and we had a whole table and bottle service awaiting us. Stay away as far as you possibly can.",2,1,

FYI - the bartender added a 20 % tip for doing absolutely nothing & giving me an already opened bottle ( I believe her intentions were to take advantage of a young customer, I am and look 21) Handed the bottle to a manager who replaced the bottle with a lack of good customer service.

The drinks are great and the staff is very friendly  Only problem I've ever had with this place is how disorganized actually getting into the bar is. There's been a few times where I've gone to the bouncers asking to purchase a table and I've had to wait on the regular line, just to relay the same request 30 mins later . Not sure if that's by design to prevent people from cutting the line but it's a nuisance.Still a fun place",,,
37,Sacha-Avi S.,"New York, NY",251,118,110,4.0,3/17/2018,"I'm going to start with the worst part of monarch- THE BATHROOMS. Monarch's entrance is relatively small. There are 3 individual bathrooms, with hundreds of people at the bar. That does not work well. But the bathroom line itself ends up interfering with 1. The coat check line which is adjacent and 2. The elevator- filled with people going up and down. The biggest complaint from everyone who attended my birthday here was the bathroom. The line averages a 20-30 minute wait. They try to keep it efficient but it's awful. I peed once in the 4 hours I was there and that was just because my friend let me skip her because it was my birthday (she waited 30 minutes). Everything else at monarch is good. Good music. Good and reasonably priced cocktails. If a glass breaks, they try to clean it immediately. People aren't unfriendly but it's usually large groups here. Would definitely come back. Another complaint- I had a paid package for my birthday with 20+ guests and yet we still had to wait on line in the cold to get into both the building and for the elevator. Which leaves me wondering, where is my money going if I'm waiting like everyone else. OTHERWISE, it was a great birthday bash and I plan on returning when the weather is warmer!",,,2

When you get upstairs, the venue is half club, half rooftop deck with great views of the Empire State Building and the rest of the city.

41,J T.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,5/9/2018,"Simply put, if you plan to do bottle service or table service, BUYER BEWARE! You will not be treated like a high paying customer - in fact, you might even be taken advantage of by your waitress like I was. I celebrated my birthday at Monarch on Saturday (5/5) and I was totally disappointed with my experience from start to finish. I called to make a table reservation for 8 people and I was told by a reservation rep that my table was confirmed and she would send a confirmation email for my records. She never did. So, I spent about 3 hours trying to reach someone on Saturday to ensure my table was confirmed. When I finally reached someone over the phone, I learned the rep never booked the table, but luckily they were able to accommodate and give us the $300 table minimum that I was originally quoted.When my party and I arrived later that evening, the line was outrageous. However, given that we had a table reserved (and a few of my other friends had already arrived earlier than me), I assumed we would be able to go up without an issue. NOPE. My party and I waited over an hour in line. Finally, a worker came down to get us off the line and this was due to my friend who was already sitting at my table. She spoke with the manager and expressed that the birthday girl who booked the table, was stuck in line! Totally unprofessional! If I have a table reservation and MY guests are already at my table, why am I waiting in line for over an hour? So, once we finally got to our table we tried to order some bottles and food with the menu the waitress gave us. After placing our order, the waitress came back with another menu and said that the bottle would actually cost more than what the old menu listed. That seemed odd and to avoid another issue, we opted to order cocktails instead. When we were ready to leave, we asked for the bill and the waitress told us that we hadn't met our minimum yet. I knew that we ordered well over our minimum, but the waitress (who also quoted our $300 minimum when I arrived at the table) kept insisting that we had a higher minimum. She even brought over a signed contract quoting a higher minimum. No one ever signed a contract when booking the table and after talking to the manager ( believe his name was TJ), he apologized for the mistake and adjusted the bill. The last straw was when the waitress gave us our final receipt and SHE wrote her own tip on the tip line and wrote in her own updated total! That is totally inappropriate and illegal. It's one thing to have gratuity added already or to have suggested tip amounts - but as a waitress, you DO NOT write in your own tip. After another talk with the manager, we received yet another apology and we left feeling like we were being taken advantage of and coerced into paying more than we needed to. All in all, Monarch offers a beautiful view of the city but so do MANY other rooftops. If you're planning to spend big bucks or celebrate an occasion, I highly recommend you go to another venue. You will not be treated like a high paying customer at Monarch Rooftop. I am very disappointed and I will not be back.",8,,

43,Mai F.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,10,5,4.0,7/21/2018,"I'll preface this by saying that we did have a table reserved in advance.Got there around 11pm and skipped the line after talking to the ushers by the elevator. And we were immediately escorted to our table outside by the waitress after the ride up to the roof. They served out the first bottle immediately.Overall, the views were very nice because of the location. The table was a good size and we had a nice amount of seating and guests who didnt come in with the host were also able to skip the line by mention the table owners name (as it should be).The bartending staff and the people maintaining our table were excellent and kept everything topped up and any spills were cleans up quickly.The negatives. The bathroom situation is a disaster. Its single unisex stalls guarded heavily by multiple staff members. I assume they've had some horror stories to cause this security to be necessary but it was excessive. 20-25 minute waits for the bathroom. Only when we were leaving did they split the line into male female and only because they had a stall with a door open for standing urinators only. I assume it's caused problems in the past but if security had just let girls use the restrooms together rather than spending the 2 minutes fighting every one then the whole line would have moved faster. The elevator bathroom line layouts are also terrible they could maybe try swapping the desk with it to alleviate the congestion.My other small complaint is something I probably only noticed because I've worked security but. The purpose of having security staff on radios and headsets is usually to be more low key when you point out problems. Security was very loud about saying to ""keep an eye on"" our table and the one next to it. It was basically yelled towards us. We did accidently break a glass during the night but at a birthday celebration that should just be expected. Otherwise it was a great experience. The booking went well and we had no issues getting to, enjoying, or paying for our table. We would recommend to other people but just warn them about the bathroom situation",,,

45,Sam E.,"New York, NY",266,4,0,2.0,5/5/2018,"I've been here a couple of times. It has a great view of the Empire State Building. This review is about their fraudulent business activity. At the bar, I ordered a $17 drink that said in the menu it was Espolon Silver tequila. As I watched the bartender make it, she used El Toro tequila. This is cheaper alcohol. Usual price difference 750ml is $12 for Toro and $25 for Espolon (here in NY).I politely called her out on it and she gave an excuse that they never make the drinks with the alcohol listed on the menu. She was nice enough to remake it with Espolon for no charge. That's the only positive.I don't appreciate charging me a lot for quality alcohol, promising me quality alcohol, and then giving me bottom shelf alcohol (typical bottom shelf at cheap dive bars). If I wasn't at the bar, I wouldn't have noticed. And that's the big picture: everyone is being scammed. Most people order through their server. Monarch should take the listed alcohol in the drink ingredients off the menu or actually give you the alcohol they advertised to you. This is a serious BBB violation.TLDR;You're getting bottom shelf alcohol for every drink even though it's listed as the alcohol in the menu.",3,,

It's a lovely hotel, in a great location, and maybe 10 steps away from an MTA train station. AAANNNNNDD.... there's a killer rooftop bar on the rooftop of this hotel!Monarch is super conveinent to hang at, as I just have to take the elevator up from my room. (Really, I have to take it down to the lobby and then get on a separate elevator, but who's splitting hairs!?)- the drinks are strong and made well- the bartenders and staff are friendly- I get 10% off my tab for being a hotel guest (hell yes!)- It's super inclusive - people from all ethnicity and sexual orientations partying together, JUST AS IT SHOULD BE!- In my 36 years 'young' age, I actually felt kind of old, as the crowd is mostly 20somethings (like, they just graduated from college and at their first job ever), BUT everyone was so fun and, again, inclusive and we had a blast every night dancing the night away with the youngins.- in the summer (or warmer months) the rooftop is wide open. In the winter it's mostly tented in, with a small outside area to get fresh air, cool off from sweating on the dance floor, and for the smokers. - also, the views are KILLER! Empire state building, Herold Square, a big chunk of Manhattan; so beautiful!",7,2,4
47,Tim S.,"Boca Raton, FL",434,482,3771,5.0,9/13/2017,"One of the best rooftop bars I have been to.  Not just in New York either, but the world.  I'm sure that sounds like a bit of Hyperbole but I have been to some solid ones from Zurich to Antigua to Saigon.  And Monarchs vibe can hang with them. We popped in the other night while in town. It was my second time being there, but the last was in the winter when the outside section was only for daredevils that could take the cold.  This last time was perfect though. Glorious weather with everything going right.  We got there to start our night so there wasn't much of a wait to go up at all(I am not good at waiting in club lines).When we got up we were met with a classy vibe. But at the same time a positive glow that more inviting from the people that worked there than standoffish which is all too common.  We grabbed a couple drinks and wandered around. There was a reserved table and a waitress said "" grab those seats, that group isn't here yet"".  Wow.  I'm not sure I have ever heard that before.  My friend she wanted a pic with the pièce de résistance, the Empire State Building.  It's a heck of a back drop, as we are high up and it's only a block away. It does make for a great shot.  We didn't stay long this time, as we had other agendas, but we sure wanted to stay.  Next time!",8,4,6

Has an very nice view of the Empire State Building, and a good amount of seating! I like this place because of the convenience of location, it's right near my work and when friends come into Penn it's right there.The cocktails are yummy but are certainly on the pricier side, but you are paying for the view, and there is no table charge so it's really worth it. Didn't try any of the food so I can't comment on that. It did take some time for our waitress to take our drink orders and bring them and check on us, we ended up having to flag her down a bunch.Probably not my first choice for a rooftop but it's definitely convenient and the view is really nice!",2,1,1

Drinks are decent and the food is good (we had pizzas and tacos, all really good).BUT! The con of this place has to be the service. I made a reservation for 15 people on a Monday and I got there right on time, but change of plans, it was raining. The hostess basically told us that our table was planned to be outside and since it was raining they didn't know what to do with us. She didn't get us a table, we were lucky to find one after standing at the bar for a while.  After we get the table I go back and ask her if she knows who our server would be... Again, no idea. This woman really doesn't know everything.So if you want to have a great NY view... Go here. But don't expect good service because it's not going to happen.",,,

I gave them a $50 but I only got back $11. Come on for a bottle of corona? So I told the I gave them a $50 however they said ""NO YOU DIDNT YOU GAVE ME A 20"" in the most rudest way ever. Okay, this is where I get pissed of me I understand you work with drunk people and yes it gets annoying HOWEVER, you can't just rip people off like that.

61,Louise H.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,1.0,5/28/2018,"Soooo I've never written a review like this. I hope to never write one like this again, either.Let's start with the good things:- View of the Empire State Building- Pretty Fairy Lights- Cute Sofas- Cheap DrinksAnnnd in to the rest we go.So I booked this place online 2 weeks before Memorial Day Weekend, as we had a fighter pilot visiting and I thought it would be an amazing place with a cute view. We were on the '5 Star Guestlist' and told we could say that (via email) and be let in. We- booked in advance- phoned in advance to check what time to arrive- arrived around this time  And when we arrived, I asked numerous people about the guestlist I got extremely rude and sarcastic responses from the appallingly presented guy in a hoodie doing goodness knows what (not a good job anyhow, looked questionable) and a security guard who in all honesty I should have foreseen the quality of a place. You always know if the security is good, so is the place. So this place was looking to be horrendous...Anyway so I did what I was told. Waited AN HOUR (very embarrassed but holding up) get to the front, to be told that the lady who we spoke to (rudest woman I've ever met, get over it you're sat in a chair on a bank holiday weekend being mean) and she said she 'made the line 3 times we weren't in it' which was complete lies, I had not seen her once. By saying this, she contradicted her words of 'you need to reach me before 12' because by saying she 'made the line' she was saying she essentially was going down the guestlist to see who was there and therefore wouldn't get charged. Long story short, she didn't make the line, was rude, lied and made me look absolutely awful in front of my visitors. Tip for management: When people book in advance with you, on some kind of event and get tickets, ring before, make the effort to PICK YOUR PLACE, treat them with respect. I then apologised to the woman and said I obviously got confused (to try and be nice because I was annoyed) and she was even ruder. I cannot believe how horrifying this experience was. The fighter pilot?? Not impressed AT ALL.We finally go up our wallets much lighter and find the worst DJ you've ever known, bar tenders that can't make the right drinks, unisex toilets which are awful, etc...If you want a classy night?? Don't go here. If you want vibes during the day, hit it up. (Look at the empire state building and nothing else) The calibre of staff here is just utterly devastating. Monarch, out of all the places to take my friend, a fighter pilot, on Memorial Day weekend, I chose you. Your staff, attitude and DJ were catastrophic, diabolical and a complete let down. To top it off?? The fighter pilot said ""this place is so bad, tonight was a bit of a fluff."" So whilst it was my fault for choosing your location, I cannot stress enough how every person in my party never wants to return to your place. I'll be telling everyone I know. I work for a global news source and they'll all know too. Good job, Monarch. You're my worst review EVER.P.S the stars won't let me give you a -5.",9,,

65,Jessica L.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,2,1,1.0,6/25/2018,"Pros: great views and social ambiance. Cons: literally everything else. Sat on the couches centrally in the bar. Was not helped for s good 10 minutes and was lost as to who to ask for help. It was almost difficult for servers to walk by other tables without having to pass ours first. This was the first strike. Finally someone who was not our server approached us and took our order after having to literally wave/flag someone down to even take our order or have water. Turned out the person who took our orders was not our server and was told ""I will get your server"". Order was taken and credit card was taken. Our server finally appears and just gotten the sangria and half off marg. Sangria was WATERED DOWN. It was the single handedly WORST sangria I've ever had. It is hard to mess up sangria. After dropping off our drinks, our server disappears and never once came back to check in or actually do her job as a server. Instead she is off to the side of the restaurant more concerned with flirting with men who to my understanding were just there playing bags. I observed her for 5 minutes, never TRIED to look after her tables. I approached the bar located inside  and asked for a check. Bartender informed me that our waitress would have the CC for the bill. I told her she is busy flirting and chatting and haven't came back once. Her response was ""you can go up to her and tell her"". NO. This is YOUR job it is not my place to BEG for my servers attention. Finally got a hold of the manager of the bar and she first asked what drinks we had and where we sat. After that exchange my friend explained that we have been trying to get a check for the past 25 minutes and haven't been able to get ahold of our servers attention since she is busy flirting.  Her response was that she will talk to her. After this exchange with the manager, we thought that it would finally be resolved. To our luck, the the server came back with a second round of drinks when WE EXPLAINED TO THE MANAGER THAT WE WANTED THE BILL AND OUR CC. Server looks confused and says ""well you can have them anyways"". NEVER IN MY LIFE, Have I've had horrible, horrible service. Negligent and absolute ignorant of what good customer service is and negligent of a servers duties are. I am a very patient person and never leave bad reviews, but this is absolutely insane. Something must change and I'm hoping this will reach higher management and take care of this ridiculous staff. The fact that the bill was not comped after this whole incident is just baffling and if I could leave zero stars. I would. What a disappointing first visit. Never again. I can't even call our the damn server because we never even found our her name but I'm sure the guys she flirted with had her contact anyways.",1,,

Definitely recommend going at night, good crowd with good music. We were a group of 7 getting together for a small event with reservations so we managed to land a good table with good views. The only problem is that service was super super slow and it was almost impossible to wave down our waitress. The one good memory was that we were there to sign off on a marriage certificate, made a mistake and was scouring for white out. Big thanks to our waitress for trying although they didn't have any!Drinks are on the pricer side compared to other NYC bars since you are paying for the view. Their small plates are really good bite sized portions. Would absolutely recommend Monarch Beef Sliders, Margherita Flatbread and Fig and Goat Cheese Flatbread. I would skip the Pomme Frites though.",,,

That is until I saw on a review the view you get of the Empire State Building. Wow!!!!!!! That's what I have to say about that view. Pictures do not truly show how amazing that view is. Probably one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Drinks were normal NYC price. We had a couple appetizers and I would not recommend that. They were very tiny and no worth the money in my opinion. I would say eat somewhere else and just go for some drinks and the VIEW! Unless your pocket book doesn't care then by all means.

Updated review","It's been awhile since my last visit i'd figure after all this time it was time for an update. Stopped by after work on a Thursday & the place was pretty packed.We stuck around the bar till seats opened up good thing for us it wasn't very long. Drinks I tried the Mykonos's punch very good drink nice taste & decent amount of alcohol. After that I later changed to beer had some Peroni can't go wrong great beer, my friends had Jack & Coke not bad. We decide to give the Wings & Avocado toast a try. The wings are not wings boneless pieces of chicken  taste good but a bit over fried small enough pieces would be better if it had less breading. Avocado toast very good as well, decent size piece of bread nice creamy good tasting Avocado.Doesn't seem like anything has changed here including the fact that they still don't offer any happy hour specials kinda sucks drinks are pricey cheapest thing is beer. Same type of crowd more business than anything mixed together there was a private event which took up a good amount of the space outside so not a lot of space to be able to hang outside but enough where u can't miss the amazing views.Good vibe & music, nice decor. I was going take away a star for the pricey menu & no happy hour but decided to keep simply because of the cool views.",7,2,6

While we waited my aunt asked for clarification on where the table was. Though we had a reservation, it more so guaranteed we had a table not so much as to if it was inside or outside. We were seated right in front of the door on the outside which was ok but since we were in front of the door there was a great deal of traffic next to our table. Our waitress came over and took our drink orders. We wanted the negroni and she suggested we get it with the house gin which was really good.

The staff did everything to make sure our time at Monarch was pleasant, fun and enjoyable. As a Latina, I appreciated that they played Salsa.

She ultimately admitted that she's heard about this practice before so she asked me receipts which I didn't have coz I didn't ask for them, so make sure you absolutely get every single one your receipt!! I didn't follow up to harass them because I was having a great time with my friends, truly. Also, the cocktails are much better @ the outside bar. Stay away from the inside bar.",,,
81,Sarah D.,"New York, NY",3,166,13,3.0,6/16/2018,"Liked the space and the vibe, but not so much the employees and way they run things.  We were on a guest list and had table service, but were told we still needed to wait in the very long line to get in.  It was annoying.  Finally we made it up and were shown to the table, however the person who had booked the table was not quite there yet.  We were just sitting at the table, relaxing when we were rudely told by one of the girls working the bar that you ""have to order bottle service to sit at these tables"".  We explained that it was our table and the person who booked it was coming up soon, but she still gave us a hard time and tried to get us to leave, even though it was OUR table and the employee working the desk at the front had escorted us to it herself.  Eventually we got our drinks and went to walk around.  The vibe is nice, inside it's like a dance club lounge type feel and outside on the patio it has more of a casual rooftop feel.  There was definitely a wide range of people, mixed in with the young dressed up crowd were tourists with their Tshirts and backpacks (guess it makes since since this is the roof of a Courtyard Marriott hotel).  It was just interesting.  The bathroom situation is a mess and I would recommend going before you arrive because it's a pain to try to go here and the bathroom line gets mixed up with the coat check and elevator lines and it's all a big mess.  Bathrooms were small and dirty as well.  Overall I liked the vibe and it's a decent pregame spot, but the people working here and way they do things just kind of put a damper on everything.  From the bouncers to the bar staff, nobody was particularly friendly or nice.",,,

We were staying at The Marriot downstairs so Monarch made for a convenient, great place to catch the sunset and some cocktails before we hit the town for the night. It was also a great place to ""happy hour"" after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. It was never crowded when we came either right when they opened or later in the evening on a weekday. We had no problem finding a comfy sofa to cozy up on or to have our appropriately priced drinks brought to us promptly by a super sweet, beautiful cocktail waitress. We did not make nor need reservations at those hours either. It was sooo relaxing and romantic. Exactly what we were looking for on this trip. The views are breathtaking and how close you feel to The Empire State Building is truly amazing!!! I can't speak for the food, but for weekday drinks, it was lovely and we would definitely return! There are separate elevators for guest and those who are strictly patrons of the lounge. They do card everyone.",4,1,3

People who work here are extremely nice. Their drinks look delicious and sound amazing. The outside rooftop views are amazing.

Updated review","Came here to meet a friend after work and this place is a shit show - from the door team to the cocktail waitresses. I've been here a few times and usually the door team is disorganized and for some odd reason have poor communication skills. Was there an hour and the only thing I managed to accomplish was getting a table. Not even a drink (I should have just gone to the bar). Our waitress said she'd be back in a minute 30 minutes ago no joke I timed her. I got up and went to the bar and got me and my colleague a drink (38$ for 2 drinks) and then we both agreed we'd finish them and leave. I don't mind spending money for a view but it needs good service. I get it, it's busy rooftop season but that only means you hire more staff to handle their sections or hire better staff and not just pretty faces (it wasn't that busy). Won't be coming back.",1,,

Updated review","So after my previous review, one of The Monarch Lounge managers contacted me and offered me to come back and re-try the food while sitting down, rather then take out with Meal Pass.I obliged and my experience was much much better.  The service was prompt and pleasant, and the atmosphere was absolutely stunning.  We went during sunset hours and it was so magnificent.  I ordered the special ""Mexican"" cocktail and it was absolutely delicious, I ordered 2 more after.  They offered the same salad that I gave such a poor review the first time, and this time it was slightly better, but nothing I would order again.  This time it did have beets, but they are cut so tiny and small it was extremely hard to find them - I thought they missed the beets again! My partner also ordered the meatballs, they were ok. Nothing grand.All in all, this is a fantastic and fancy date night spot during the summer/ warmer months.  Come here for the good music and tasty drinks - but I wouldn't recommend ordering the expensive food unless you are really hungry.",2,,

92,Rob C.,"New York, NY",234,221,144,4.0,11/30/2017,"Fun rooftop bar and lounge with a nice view of the city and the Empire State Building. The crowd is diverse with a mix of tourists, 20 to 30s, and a sprinkle of bridge and tunnel folks (it's pretty close to Penn Station and Grand Central). On a Friday night, saying Mao will probably get you in the door for free as the door is run by the same guys who do Up & Down. The only annoying thing is that some nights will be unannounced private events so you should have a backup plan around the area. Venue-wise, there's a good amount of space. The outdoor area is a bit chilly during winter as the heaters are not turned up that high, but there is always the indoor area if you enjoy dancing. Drinks are standard Manhattan prices with beer starting at around $9 to $10. Overall, a fun place and definitely a hidden gem for getting a nice view of the city.",,,

Unfortunately, those are the only things good about this place.Cons:Line for the bathroom is LONG. Every single person in my partt who went to the bathroom, had to wait on a long line for almost 10 minutes. Drinks are alright. I'm not a drinker but my friends say it's not a lot of alcohol in their drinksMusic leaves a lot to be desired. While you're inside the rooftop, you can hear the music, BUT music sucked. I love dancing, and I mainly go to clubs and bars so I can go wild dancing, but the music was not able to put me in the mood. Everyone hated the flow of the music and complained about it.

100,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,2.0,4/6/2016,"I got a deal through Fever for a free drink here on Friday between 10 and 11pm. Keep in mind, the deal said ""FREE DRINK"". It didn't specify any type of drink, price, etc. So, I went in and ordered a vodka soda and boyfriend got a beer. Then the bartender is like ""oh, sorry, the deal is only for beer and wine."" I was like ""well, it doesn't say anything on here about that [shows ticket]."" She says she doesn't make the rules and is just telling me whatever she knows. I'm really pissed off at this point but she already made the drinks so I guess I have to pay for it now. So we paid $28 for two drinks which is a ridiculous price but that's how these places are. At this point, I'm not sure if this is Fever's fault or Monarch's or a combination of the two. We proceed to enjoy the rooftop views and our drinks (not super strong but decent), and then decide to go back to actually use the tickets on beer and wine (which I don't even care for much but whatever it's free). It's 11:09 at this point and the next bartender says it's past 11 so he can't take the tickets. I'm like ""dude, it's 11:09, come on.."" but he says it's not his decision. Um, I think it kinda is since you're the bartender but whatever... So now I have these two tickets left for drinks I don't even want and I ended up spending money when I didn't plan to. I emailed Fever when I got home and told them this is terrible customer service since the tickets said NOTHING about which drinks are free. They replied and said they worked with Monarch in the past and never heard this complaint from anyone and apologized. They didn't give me any kind of compensation for it either though so I'm still unclear as to whether this is Monarch's fault or theirs (or both). Either way, this place is way too expensive and if that's the kind of service they provide, then I won't be coming back. I get much better value for my money at 230 Fifth. I'm only giving an extra star because the view and atmosphere is nice.",8,2,1

Unless you want to drink water because drink are around 20 bucks. This is the standard at places like this in Nyc. There is a certain flair that one must entertain when dealing with roof top bars. 1. You have to dress nicely.2. This place is very popular with the after work crowd and larger parties, so you may want to get there early. Sometimes there can be a line to get into the elevator. 3. The place has waitress service. Unless you have to order from them, it will be faster to get your drinks at the bar. I am not trying to hate on the table service folks but if you want to give attitude then I will cutout the middle person and start a new tab at the bar. Maybe they are crabby because people just go to the bar to order drinks. 4. Do not bother with the food. Yuck. 5. The view of the ESB is AMAZING, especially when it is lit up.",1,,

Updated review","Hola!!! This rooftop bar..yes it's enclosed now...is soooooo refreshing! So I went shopping at Macy's! I REALLY needed a drink or 3. They had $7 Moscow mules all day for New Years Day! Nice surprise. This area is not known for high end super cool rooftop bars with friendly service from very beautiful staff...just isn't! My cocktail and bar goddesses were so freaking lovely and sweet I almost forgot I was in NY! Yup no attitude about ""how cute I am and really I'm an actor about to be cast for Shonda Rhimes' new show so be grateful I'm serving you!""  They were both awesome! Okay Moscow Mule! Delish! I'm a total Mule lover! It was awesome and the sliders rocked! Price should have only been 2 of them but there were 3! So I didn't eat a lot but my review is based on atmosphere and service...last note...The DJ was really great! I totally wish this DJs would spin at my gym. I'd go everyday!!!!  Happy New Year! This place is a great find!!!  I'll definitely be back with friends...yes I'll wear something nicer!!!",,,

These buckets go for $18 a piece and I believe they have a upgraded version with redbull for  $21.Staff is hot as summer and super friendly.

The place is pretty hidden living in NYC i have never heard or seen this place before. It located inside a hotel so trying to see if you are at the right place might be a little tricky but going in you will see someone standing by the first elevator which is the one that will take you to the rooftop. My husband had actually made a reservation for the outside part of the rooftop and we were a group of 8. I am not sure but from what i understood in order to sit in the outside part of the rooftop and make the reservation there was a cover per person. I would call and ask about that. We were seated on time and the staff was friendly. the view is beautiful which is why the place is so pricey. Drinks range from about 12-16 and beer is 9 anything else i do not remember. I was not a big fan of the drinks although they were beautifully presented the taste was not too good. The sangria was the best option in my opinion.The total for 8 people was not bad but we all got about 1 drink or so, if the group is larger than 6 you are automatically charged the 20% gratuity, bill came out to about $250.   You are really paying for the view and the location.

One of my guests was turned away for wearing shorts. He went and purchased new pants, then we noticed SEVERAL gentlemen wearing shorts at the venue that were let in with no problem at all. Also, somehow nothing was communicated about my credit card authorization form and the payment details for the evening even though I sent all information earlier that afternoon. Luckily, I had a hard copy of the document with me since whoever helped me did not follow through on their end at all. They switched out our original server (she was nice too) out of nowhere and she knew all the info about our payment and details, but they didn't let the new server know. Everything was a complete mess with how the payment was supposed to end up and it did not reflect the contract I gave them for payment at all. Some of the food we ordered also never came out, even though we were there for almost 3 hours! However, our lovely server was amazing...she should definitely work somewhere else!

So me and one of my coworkers were standing there by this small table, we didn't sit down or anything, just sitting there trying to see the screen. Again, the area was empty. This manager comes over and let's us know that there is basically a line that we cannot cross because she has a private party that is coming in at 4 PM. At this time it was way over 4.20 PM and again, we were not sitting, we were literally standing in front of a small table. No-one from that party had showed up at that point. So she tells us we need to move. She didn't ask us nicely, but basically she ordered us to move beyond the ""line"". Then after we pass this imaginary line, she pulls this flower right between me and that area, right on that imaginary line of hers, to be absolutely sure we understand we are not to cross that line. Is this for real? How do you work in the service industry if you don't know how to talk to people? Can you try to at least be polite if accommodating us is impossible for you? The party that was supposed to come in at 4 PM did not cross her imaginary line until maybe 5 PM so really, breathing the same air as other guests shouldn't really be a problem. If the guests at that party had showed up we really understand what private party means so we would have stepped aside and let the people have a good time. It is really unfortunate that this person who clearly lacks common sense works in a respectable rooftop in midtown. We go there quite a lot and this has never happened to us and we really like the Monarch, but this person kind of ruined our whole mojo with her imaginary lines and rudeness. I really wish I had asked for her name.",,,
124,Kenny L.,"Morris Plains, NJ",32,159,138,4.0,7/21/2017,"Rooftop!! I love rooftop bars. Being able to enjoy the nice weather outside while sipping on a drink. The vibe there is pretty nice, more upper class like with a mix of people in the mid 20s/30s and people in their 40s/50s compared to somewhere like 230 rooftop or the rooftop at pod 39. Not sure if they have a happy hour because when I went yesterday I didn't see any special menu or anything with specials on it. It's definitely a bit pricey with $9 beers and $16 cocktails but with it's location in midtown with a view of the Empire State Building it's expected. Cool place to hang out for a drink or two with a more relaxed vibe.",,,

The club and music are pretty good too. I had a great time here with my boyfriend. So why two stars? The food was so so, I would not recommend getting any stick to the drinks, which are also lack luster and a bit pricey.  The down fall of Monarch for me was the service. It was really quite terrible. When the waitress did make it over to our table she was very nice and courteous, however she rarely came to our table and the place was relatively quite when we first arrived. Most of the servers were sort of just standing in the corner socializing. We spent the first twenty minutes or so there with no service. I had to get up and find the hostess who seated us to request her to send over a server :-/ The rest of the evening we sort of begged for attention. Come here for the view and one drink. I will try it again. I'm hoping it was just an off night, because the location is quite beautiful",3,1,1

133,Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",366,1032,1857,4.0,8/10/2016,"My friend Ivan P. and I were celebrating our new Friday night schedule change when we decided to visit Monarch. This particular rooftop is more like a club than a lounge, but it does feature what I think is the best rooftop view of the Empire State Building in all of NYC. The dress code is somewhat strict. The bouncers clearly warned everyone in line wearing sneakers that they would not be allowed in. Their attitudes were a bit abrasive though, which I found unnecessary. The hostess at the door asked everyone in line if they had a reservation. Most people did not, but she let them in anyway after saying that it was a ""one time thing"". Again, trying too hard to seem very exclusive.Once we got upstairs, the rest of the staff was nice enough. The drinks were average price, $8-15 depending on the drink. The atmosphere was very club-like. There were people dancing, some entertainers dancing on platforms, and couches along the edge, where people could enjoy the view and get bottle service. Ivan and I picked up a bottle of Bombay Sapphire, and it came with a good amount of mixer. Bottles were overpriced as always but whatever.

My friend had her birthday party here and she had a couch reserved outdoors. The service was a little spotty -- very friendly staff, but service was slow. We also arrived past 10pm, so their specialty drinks menu was no longer valid. They told us that they could make us anything, so I ordered an old fashioned and what arrived was some sugary cocktail that had some bourbon in it. Not cool. The place was full of girls dressed up and bros who were very Wall Street suits. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff? Secondly, I tried to close out and it took me half an hour to do so. This involved telling her twice I wanted to close out, then chasing her down after that didn't happen. I had to ask someone to try to find her. That stood out as being insane for me -- how could that happen? The staff member who helped me locate her was super nice though. And when I found my server, she apologized a lot. Perhaps they're just too busy.  Two stars for the view, and the otherwise nice staff.",4,1,1

We made it up to the rooftop in no time. It's not that big but the ambiance was great. I would almost compare to the setting of PHD rooftop in Chelsea. The music was lively, the crowd very very diverse but not obnoxious. The drinks were relatively cheap for midtown as well -11 for a well drink.

There is a section in the back where you can have privacy if you have a group of people. The bathroom lines were super long though, so tinkle at the place before or after this one if you're here late. Or just hold it ! Bartenders are nice and easy to get their attention. I didn't have to wait long to order drinks. Dance floor is very inviting. The way they let people out of this place is really hectic though. You just have to shove your way to the elevator and when the doors open push through. I like this place though, I would come back!

Only steps away from Penn Station too.  Have the courtyard hold your bags while you get a drink before a train.   Best Courtyard feature I have seen of any courtyard Marriott ... well... ever.,3,3,3

I am not sure the actual cost per drink because with the Bar Crawl, came discounted drinks, but I do know a diet coke was $6. The rooftop itself was awesome, they had really nice seating and it was super trendy. Unlike a lot of other rooftops I have been to, there werent any lines or waits to get in, but the elevator ride back down was ridiculous.

149,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,2.0,11/11/2016,"This review is solely based on the Halloween party, not exactly the venue itself because due to circumstances I wasn't able to actually view the place, or even stay very long. On the weekend of Halloween I came here after my boat ride ended early. I got here about 11:45, and when I hopped out of the Uber, I noticed an extremely long line that went around the block. This should have been expected because it was Halloween, and the line actually moved pretty quickly. However, once I was inside and there were only a few people ahead of me, I began to see many angry and disenchanted people. There was a guy who was in a group of four, and for some reason the venue wouldn't accept his pre-purchased tickets. He coughed up the $200 (50 per person). Also, I saw two girls directly ahead of me, and they had a similar fate. The girl became hysterically, but the lady downstairs wouldn't budge. I felt bad for them since everyone is in costume, had previously purchased their tickets, and now they are being told they have to pay an excessive amount just to get in. As I got in without issue, I'm not sure how this ultimately turned out.Finally, I get upstairs around 12:40. It's a madhouse upstairs. You legitimately had to wait several minutes just to move. They totally allowed way too many people inside and made it very uncomfortable. The place was filled with many young 20 somethings who were relatively immature. After being inside for about 30 minutes, we both wanted out. The few positives were the music was decent, the views were decent as well. I would give this place a try again because I had two friends vouch for them, but on a regular night where it wasn't a holiday or parHowever, on Halloween night, they really dropped the ball by allowing too many people inside and making it uncomfortable inside. Hopefully they do a better job with the people they allow to promote in their venue so people aren't  forced to pay twice for a party.",,,

We got in without any problems and were led to a designated table. We began settling down, excited to start the night. All of a sudden, we were told that we DO NOT have a table and they started escorting us out. Confused, we asked why, because clearly we did have a table. Just then, a middle aged man in a suit came over with a crowd of model-type girls and sat down at our table. It was clear that he looked like he was going to spend much more than us. I assume that's why our table was given to someone else even when we had reservations. This place favors certain patrons over others, and do not keep promises of reservations.

Updated review","This place is only getting 3 stars because the rooftop itself it's beautiful. The staff and service- not so much. Deserving of 2.In a nutshell- expect to get yelled at by bouncers from the minute you get off the elevators to the time where you need to find the bathroom. Always know ""there's a line!!!"" With other angry patrons trying to find their way around just like you.The issue I had was not even he overpriced drinks (as to be expected for a rooftop) but the ridiculousness that was the food prices/quantity. $17 for an ""order"" of sliders- that's TWO sliders per order. Are you kidding me? the clincher was the $12 French fries which were given to us as one inch nubs in a cup, bottom of the barrel?? When I asked the waitress if she could get us a fresh order given we couldn't even eat the little guys, she told me ""this is what our fries are, if you want more you need to order the larger side platter."" I said I didn't need more, I needed fries you could actually pick at given we were a group of 12 people ordering a lot from this overpriced establishment. Again she refused as I showed her the cup of crumbs we were given. At this point I laughed in her face and we snapped a good picture to show you what we meant by nubs. It was a work event, and I spent $1k on my business for this but we're still treated rudely. She didn't mind since she knew her 20% tip was included. I'll pass next time on this place... ****updated review since management contacted me about the above experience and welcomed me back for complimentary cocktails.second time around was great!

173,Robert A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,16,0,2.0,5/5/2018,the 16 dollar wine was sweet and flavorless and the decor was reminiscing of a sweet 16 at Long Island wedding hall circa 1998. Didn't have the food but other people seemed to be enjoying it. If you plan on using cash you will still need a credit card for those of you that carry just a money clip in your pocket.,,,
174,Ferm W.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,6,1,5.0,12/4/2017,If you're ever visiting NY for a bachelor party or have a group of friends you want to impress you've got to come here. Awesome party vibes. Great service and good looking chicks. Shout out to Emily our server for being the best. Usually cocktail waitresses are snotty and she was awesome.,,,
175,Anne M.,"Wilmington, NC",63,143,134,4.0,5/1/2016,"Well it's certainly pricy.  You're on a rooftop with fantastic city views (Empire State Building).  The drinks are good and the servers are fast.  And if you're into this, they are hardly wearing any clothes. I dug the whole vibe.  It's a great place to meet before heading to the garden at sunset or to see the lights of the city. There are heaters for cooler nights but it is balls hot at sunset. Even in April. Bring your RayBans.",1,1,

177,Sarah M.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",114,195,98,3.0,7/8/2016,"Definitely a good spot with great drinks and awesome views. Service was decent but beware, prices are crazy. But I think you can expect that at any rooftop bar in the city. I got the Raspberry crush to drink and absolutely loved it. The food was eh, we got a couple flat breads and some wings. Nothing was spectacular but definitely a great spot when in need of a drink. They accommodate reservations too which was nice cause we got right in with our party on a Thursday evening.",,,
178,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,4.0,1/15/2016,"Monarch Rooftop can control my mind at any time. Look for the butterfly wing ""M"" labeled elevator and press R to begin the journey.I respect a rooftop bar that remains open during the depths of winter, when exposure to sun is minimal, misery rises and the need to imbibe increases. Look at Iceland and the levels of Scandinavian intoxication as proof. Thanks to the burning of fossil fuels, a rooftop can be heated and the party can continue. Isn't civilization great?On a Monday night, the place wasn't exactly buzzing with activity and that's quite fine if your purpose is to actually converse. Or work on your laptop as an odd number of people were drinking and typing. Service was the friendly female type, dressed smartly without descending into debauchery or frat boy hijinks. I suppose the place exudes class instead of being crass.Cocktails are $16 a pop with monthly specials listed on each table. Layout consists of a large bar and various nooks of chairs for groups to assemble and socialize. Once again, I'm sure during peak heat this place is jammed but during off-peak, it's a most pleasant interior with plenty of breathing room.The drinks certainly created a respectable buzz, with options including a variation on the classic old fashioned, mint julep and other standards. One minor gripe was the need to ask for tap water several times and not be offered any at the start of the drinking extravaganza. I also observed that the glasses just seemed smaller than what I'm used to and the ice cubes larger. Maybe my eye sight is deteriorating as I age but something didn't add up.That didn't stop me from trying a large selection of cocktails and enjoying every single one. What stands out besides the view was the quality of the edibles. A flatbread margherita pizza that was not glorified cardboard with ketchup and shredded cheese was my favorite of the two dishes ordered. An order of dumplings could have been prepared boiled or fried. We opted for fried and were not disappointed. The view is the major draw, of course and you'll feel as if you can reach out and touch the Empire State Building. It's an ideal location for photos, photos of drinks and whatever else the young people take pictures of these days. Lounge like an absolute monarch at Monarch...",6,4,4
179,Raeshelle D.,"Lake Grove, NY",0,1,0,2.0,8/20/2018,"The place has an awesome view and atmosphere but the service was not the best. I came here for a friends 22 birthday and was a bit disappointed by the way we were treated by the bar tenders. They were extremely rude and even swore at my friend. We tried to order apps but kept getting different answers from all of the people working. When we finally ordered we sat at a table and then were told we could not sit there by one of the bar tenders even though another one told us to sit there. Once that was cleared up the food came and the bar tender didn't even run the food over to the table my friend had to go up to the bar to get it even tho we tipped a fair amount of money. The food was amazing and probably the best part. We finished out food, had one more round and then left because we were not happy with the service. However the manager and the doorman were very polite when we expressed our concerns but didn't really do anything about the situation.",,,
180,Vihaan S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,2.0,5/22/2017,"Went to Monarch for a Saturday night, waited in line outside for about half an hour, the rude bouncer didn't help. Didn't answer any questions, just yelled at people to form a single file. Monarch doesn't seem to have a well thought out restroom. The bathroom line was another 30 minutes. The staff let people slip through and I saw one guy bribe his way in for ten bucks. The dance floor was alright, if you discount the terrible mashups and drunk people pushing you every minute or so. Only good things about this place are the view and the nice manager. My friend lost her jacket and they managed to retrieve it for her.",,,
181,Wendy L.,"Ottawa, Canada",194,118,178,3.0,6/14/2016,"This place was quite busy when my friend and I dropped by on a Wednesday night. It was so packed, I could barely get myself outside to enjoy the view. The view was indeed spectacular, you could see the Empire state building from very close up. But the downside was that you could also feel your neighbour from very close up beside you - it was a small venue.The crowd was very mixed, but it wasn't as classy as some of the other rooftop bars and it seemed like some of the clientele may have just stepped out of a club. Although, the atmosphere did make it feel like it was more a club than a bar.After taking a look at the drink menu and seeing the prices, I will have to say, this is not a place for cheap drinks-at all. It is a place to enjoy the view. Had this been an indoor on the ground restaurant, I don't know if it would have anywhere near as many people.All in all, I wasn't in love or wow'd by the place, there are definitely more and better rooftop bars in New York to go to.",,,
182,Katd B.,"Boston, MA",0,15,0,1.0,1/14/2018,"Maybe shame on me for not doing my research, or maybe I'm just too old for places like this at 29, but I was expecting/hoping for a classy rooftop vibe where I could chill and catch up with some old friends, but that is NOT what this place is. When we arrived the place seemed fine enough. We were seated on some couches and comfortable chairs with my friends, and had some slightly overpriced, average drinks, but were able to enjoy it well enough... for like twenty minutes.  Suddenly, however they blasted the music louder than I realized music could even be, forcing us to yell to even talk to each other. I know there is a dance floor, but not near us, so I'm not clear why it had to be so loud. Then they had these awful flashing colored strobe-type lights that kept flashing repeatedly right at eye level. The last straw was when these two tacky rhinestone-lingerie-clad women climbed up on these tables, posed like gargoyles for a minute, and then stood and started ""dancing.""  Not classy and I'm not into objectification of women in my drinks. We stood up to leave, but little did I know leaving would be a shockingly convoluted process. The elevator line and bathroom line are confusing and in the same place. The elevator came and they filled it halfway with my friends. Me and two others were told there wasn't room and we had to wait. As we were waiting, the hostess rudely told us we were standing too close to the elevator and to move back behind this rope. Another elevator came and the crowd of people came off. We stepped forward to get on, but the doors slammed in our face and the elevator left. The bouncer came back from his conversation somewhere else and yelled at us for not getting on the elevator. We told him we tried but it closed too quickly. Needless to say, we proceeded to stand right next to the doors of the elevator for the next one, and you would have had to forcibly move me to make me go back behind the rope.  As the next elevator came, another five minutes later at least, I shoved my way on as soon as it arrived, ignoring bouncer and hostess, because literally nothing in the world would have made me stay in that place another second, and was finally free in the fresh quiet outside air to let my sore throat heal.",2,,

There was a nice crowd going and the music was bumpin'. We had a table reserved for us, so we were seated almost immediately. The waitress was very attentive even when it was crowded towards later in the night. In addition, the dance floor was nice and spacious and the DJ was really good. Mostly played top 40, but he mixed it very well. Drink prices are pretty standard for NYC. I'd come back here again when it's warmer and they don't have a tent over the rooftop.",3,1,1

187,Alexandra D.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,106,1,2.0,7/16/2017,"I called Monarch to make reservations for my parents who were celebrating their 40th anniversary in Manhattan. I wanted them to have some cocktails on a rooftop. Bottom line: I was not impressed. I called ahead of time so they'd have a nice seat and so that they'd immediately bring chips and guac for my parents' table. I ended up swinging by to say hi to them and found out that they put them in a center table that was not even shaded (it was VERY hot) and they did not bring chips and guacamole. Every time we ordered something (including water), it took about 25 minutes for it to come. Ended up being a bad present, and I wasn't even asking a lot of the venue.",1,,

Bartender was very friendly, views were stunning, plenty of couches/lounge seats, I love the fact there's 365 degree views openly, as opposed to some rooftops' got blocked views. The air was breezy and we chilled w beer and cocktails as we should happy hour ;)",3,2,2
189,Lindsay M.,"Doylestown, PA",0,4,0,2.0,4/16/2018,"So disappointing! Made a reservation for 9 people. This reservation was verified several times prior to the day by a person from the rooftop. Upon arrival, we were given a space that seats 6 people comfortably. We questioned the manager who repeatedly said because it was so busy on a nice day, that's the best they could do and they can't really accommodate 9 people. If that's the case, why would you verify the reservation several times for a party of 9? Beyond that frustration, was the fact that after an hour and a half, the manager informed us the reservation is only for a 2 hour time limit and we would need to leave soon. Again, this was never mentioned during the several communications prior to arrival. We were spending a lot of money on drinks and planned to order food but had to leave??  At least have the consideration to mention this when communicating via email ahead of time to allow for alternate plans. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the server was very nice and did a great job. Will not return or recommend.",,,
190,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,3.0,10/25/2015,"The view of the city is incredible up here and the venue itself is very tasteful but the staff could use some lessons in congeniality & charm.  I came here for a friend's party a few nights ago and when my escort & I sat down on a cold evening on the uncovered part of the rooftop (where you will see breathtaking views of the city, including the nearby Empire State building), a server promptly tells us we must be buying drinks to sit in that section (marked ""Reserved"").  She could have been far more polite in her tone & offended my escort in that process.  Let me also note that almost no one was sitting in this area so not sure if they were leaving this for the invisible ghosts drinking invisible drinks paying invisible tips & bills.  Not sure how far invisible money ever got the staff or if they tried paying rent with it.Also, don't bother with taking professional pictures here.  We were a party of models and beautiful people with a high contingent of women (two demographics these places love to have patronize them: beautiful women and ""beautiful"" fashion types).  I'd been off talking to my escort but during that time the rest of this part were trying to take pictures and the staff apparently told them they had to leave.  When we left, I happened to see one of my friends who'd told me they got kicked out b/c of trying to take professional pictures.Did these people inform the person having a birthday here about such a policy ahead of time?  I presume they didn't or he wouldn't have bothered coming here.  We are also talking of a small crowd of maybe 4-5 models, not 30-40 girls taking up tons of space away from other customers.  I also didn't notice my guests being rowdy, intoxicated drunks or throwing up or doing other obnoxious things your average nightlife venue wouldn't want to deal with.",5,4,1

I will never ever come back this place again, one star for waitresses, but the bouncer is disgusting.",,,
193,Gail H.,"Limekiln, PA",0,1,0,1.0,4/16/2018,"A great disappointment.  After traveling all the way from Pennsylvania with a reservation for 9 of us, we were told after being there for 1 and a1/2 hours, that we had a 2 hour limit. We were NEVER informed of this policy prior to that moment and had to leave. We were there as we were attending the Billy Joel concert at 8PM. Such a horrible way to treat out of state patrons.  Never going back, and I strongly suggest after reading this very honest review that you search out a better place. One star because it's a perfect location,  but honestly doesn't matter in this case.",,,
194,Lola G.,"Kenilworth, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,10/1/2017,"I hate to leave reviews but this person ruined my night. I have seen a lot of complaints about this but I'm gonna have to reiterate this. The bouncers are extremely rude. I had reserved something for my 21st birthday. I barely even got to the door and the bouncer refused to let us in. He said it was because one of my friends was wearing sneakers. They don't care if you have anything reserved or that it's your birthday. And when I tried to talk to him he started to be extremely condescending. It was my birthday and this guy started to make fun of me. Regardless that it's my birthday, that shouldn't slide in general. I left immediately after he started attacking me. Mind you, I was not yelling at him or anything, just asked him once if there was some way we could get in. That kind of negativity really killed my mood. Have fun with the bouncers.",,,

199,Laura M.,"Manhattan, NY",107,8,0,5.0,2/14/2017,"I threw my boyfriend a 30th birthday party here this past weekend and it was wonderful!! I had booked in advance a private area of the lounge for about 25 people along with a one hour open bar and two food plates. The required $ minimum can be a bit pricey but we had people chip in for our party and overall it was completely worth it. Our semi-private area had two couches, tables and a rope which helped keep our group together. Kyle, one of the managers was amazing. He and the other employees checked in on us multiple times to see if we were ok and needed anything and were all very friendly. I would highly recommend the Monarch for anyone looking to throw a group party.",,,
