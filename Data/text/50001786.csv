0,Philip N.,"New York, NY",8,149,26,5.0,5/26/2018,"I only stopped by BUT the two women who gave me a huge cup of tap water for free seriously saved my life today. I had no money on me, couldn't find a water fountain, and was at mile ten of my run. It was so hot and I was desperate for water. Ladies - seriously, thank you so much. I was able to make it back to Astoria and compete my run. You made my day. I really appreciate the kindness and generosity.",1,,
1,Karl A.,"Deer Park, NY",70,128,289,4.0,9/22/2017,Not over priced considering it's Manhattan and across from the UN. Nice little set up with chairs and tables for outside seating. Hotdog and soda cost about 5 bucks. Not too shabby.,1,,
2,Kylia V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",29,5,0,5.0,5/14/2018,"Thank you for knowing and implementing the rules that NYC sets on service dogs; it is rare that businesses keep up to date on these rules.  Thank you also for still being friendly and giving me good customer service, despite me having a service dog.",,,
3,Sakai T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0,5.0,7/15/2018,"This places serves up great burgers and hot dogs and the patio is a nice spot to sit and enjoy on a warm summer day! The manager, Tiffany, is so warm, cheery, and helpful! Definitely a great find when you are near the UN!",,,
4,Mark J.,"Manhattan, NY",55,30,11,5.0,7/21/2017,"Lovely outdoor space for burgers and wine in a plastic cup.If you want low key, low tech, in an outdoor environment, this is your place.",1,,
5,Daphne M.,"New York, NY",123,47,22,5.0,9/19/2015,Post screening at the Japan Society Nice spot to hang out Good music & atmosphere,1,,1
6,Ryan F.,"New York, NY",145,12,0,5.0,5/16/2017,The applewood bacon and cheddar burger is delicious. It's a peaceful little place to get away from work while enjoying good burgers and fries.,1,,
7,Ken T.,"Rego Park, NY",426,125,62,3.0,2/26/2015,"The food here is pretty good. The burgers can be comparable to some of the more popular places in the city although it might be a wee-bit pricier. But luckily for me, I had a Groupon deal which made it much more affordable. The deal was for burgers, fries, and milkshake. Upon coming here, I found out the milkshake machine was ""not working."" I call the place a month later and it's still not working... so I'm not sure what the deal is with that. If they would just ""fix the machine"" or ""turn it on"", then I can get my groupon deal and be on my way.With minor changes, this place can easily get 4-star ratings. Hopefully they can work hard to fix some of those things.In other words, if you're looking for a cheap place to eat, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for an alternative to Shakeshack, give this place a go and decide for yourself!",2,,1
8,S O.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/5/2017,"Dag's is a relaxing neighborhood spot!  Love coming here for drinks and a bite to eat!  Great spot to sit for the evening and to get yummy hotdogs, salads, snacks, and cold drinks (wine, beer, juice, water, etc.)-- likewise a great place for an outdoor lunch or to sit with friends over coffee during the day.  The staff is friendly and Dag's really contributes to the sense of community!  We've loved the musicians playing on Wednesdays this summer!",,,
9,Albany L.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",54,3,1,1.0,5/3/2015,"This is such a shame because the environment is great, but the food is terrible and service is even worse! 30 minute wait for a bacon egg and cheese for my buzzer to off, and be told they were out of bread and wanted to use a hoagie instead. Fine! 10 minutes later, it's ready. It wasn't even busy. The hoagie was stale, bacon was burnt, and the sandwich was 1/2 bread... Also, the owner/manager was yelling at the staff in a condescending way to hurry up over again, which was uncomfortable. Needless to say: Will never go back!",4,,
10,Sui B.,"Jersey City, NJ",172,782,1267,1.0,9/4/2013,"Unfortunately the sandwich I ordered was so bad and was not worth over $8. I ordered a grilled veggie on a baguette. To my shock, they took a pre-made one out of the fridge! I had assumed that everything was made fresh since I saw the grill going. But that was for burgers only. There were legitimately one piece of eggplant and 2 small pieces of squash. The rest was just mixed greens and onion. Really people?!",5,1,1
11,Terence B.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",83,31,28,4.0,7/6/2016,Great place to grab lunch and sit outside. The counter person Maria was extremely nice . I ordered a veggie burger which was delicious. Definitely a place i will revisit. I will try the breakfast in the morning and then drinks in the evening.,2,,
12,Ruth U.,"New York, NY",33,175,227,4.0,6/28/2015,Close to UN. Outdoor seating only. Food was good. Tgey have groupons. Got a veggie burger. Tasty. They also serve booze.,,,
13,Justine Y.,"Manhattan, NY",5,81,2,3.0,5/11/2015,"Right across from the UN, it's a nice respite if you work in Midtown East like I do. I had the fries while my friend had a grilled caesar salad (and complained that it was dry).Fries were a-ok compared to our first attempted option of Shake Shack. We ended up at Dag's because it was closer to the office, plus we ended up spotting some coworkers. It's a solid choice if you want to stay outside as they do have patio seating, but beware of the pigeons! And pesky smokers. Service was very friendly, with their coworkers going out of their way to make sure I received everything okay.",,,
14,Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",858,1985,61,4.0,9/14/2014,"I really liked this place! Huge outdoor patio in the park.  Cheap happy hour and the strongest (and actually great tasting) punch ever!! Soft serve ice cream was delicious, too.  Free jazz/music on Wed. evenings.  Loved it!",3,1,1
15,FreshFood P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,98,8,1.0,1/24/2014,"I've been to this place several times. The food is decent but overpriced. The reason for the low rating is b/c of the consistently poor, rude customer service.I've eaten at Dag's about 9 times and the ONLY time I've received good customer service is when the manager was present. The girl who usually works the front counter is named Kenia. She would rather play on her cell phone or blatantly ignore customers that are waiting to be serviced; she always forgets (or chooses not)  to give the chef special requests, i.e. no onions on burger; she gives you attitude when you ask for a receipt; and she never says ""thank you"" or any other pleasantry after ringing you up. Kenia's not the only rude clerk - there's a girl who woks during the summer who literally just stands behind the counter and stares directly at you, never once greeting you. So, when she did this to me, I sarcastically told her that she's very pleasant. In retaliation, she double-billed my credit card. Thankfully, the manager was nice enough to refund the extra charge.",12,1,
16,"Drink, Pleas E.","Manhattan, NY",0,28,0,1.0,8/5/2015,"This place doesn't hold itself out to be much more than a location cafe offering average food at  midtown prices.  Its about location.  Its in a nice plaza and only has outdoor seating.  So, if you are passing by on a nice day, its tempting.  So too, though, is any nearby bench with a better and cheaper sandwhich from anywhere, even home.The problem is the buulding is not suitable for food service.  The bathroom is a portable latrine situated adjacent to the outdoor space.  Its used by many, including some who take up residence in the park during warmer months.  Gets a wee bit ripe and a protable toilet is never a great solution - -  that's why they are temporary.Garbage is stored in and around the space and dragged accross the plaza to be stacked for collection while it too oozes and ripens in the sun. Spent fry oil is stored in a drum nearby.  The local rat population loves it during the quiet morning hours but clear out before most people come around.   Food waste is routinely dumped in the storm drain that sits in the middle of the plaza adjacent to their outside seating.  Not only have I seen them pour waste content from their ice cream machine but other food waste that saturates the area with oil.  All sorts of vermine love this goo.  Goodness knows what its feeding in the storm drain.  (BTW storm drains are for rain water. Its not a sewer where water gets treated)As for service, I I suggested to the manager that they shouldn't dump waste in the storm drain, he denied it and then said it was just dish water and then grunted a F-ck You! and ordered me out of the public park.  I declined both requests.",3,,
17,Linda N.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,45,1,5.0,7/16/2015,"Why are there only 3 stars? I have been to this place several days in a row (and plan to come tomorrow). It's just a divine and semi-hidden gem. Frozen margaritas for 5$ and you can enjoy them sitting in a nice, serene park space. They have live music on Wednesday evenings. The burgers are fantastic and there are lots of other food options but you will never feel obligated to purchase anything. You will never feel rushed here and I think the prices are very reasonable for the area. I love you Dag's. I'm sorry it took me so long to find you but I'll make it up to you.",2,,
18,Kate M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,5,1,5.0,8/15/2016,Great food. Great music. Perfect for a date night if you want to sit outside. The band that plays every Wednesday is also very good. I have come back to see them twice so far.,1,,
19,Anthony M.,"Washington, DC",0,4,0,5.0,6/18/2015,Kody is awesome!! He's a great bartender that they just added. They should definitely move the bar around front or to the side so people can grab awesome drinks from him! Rock on Kody!!,,,
20,Nicolas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/28/2016,"Absolutely aweful! The owner is extremely rude and unprofessional. Because we had a little dog with us (in an outdoor space) he sat behind us talking about how we were not welcome. Could have politely asked us to move, but no. We even heard racial inuendos directed at us. Terrifying people like this still exist in this world. Please avoid this hellhole.",,,
21,Robert S.,"Millersburg, PA",1,5,1,1.0,8/17/2014,"I never had a good experience here.  There door says opens at 8 am every day, but I came here a few times on the weekend after 8am and told they were not open.  Other problems include: exceptionally weak coffee, over cooked fries, and everything else I tried just average.",2,2,
22,Joan Marie W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,8/30/2013,Shake Shack BEWARE the burgers at Dag's are much much better and the shakes are too!  No long wait at Dag's and the staff is extra friendly.  Run to Dag's for the best burger in New York!,6,1,3
23,Brendan P.,"Mamaroneck, NY",1,6,0,1.0,4/13/2015,"Overpriced and poor service. Had to wait over 30 minutes for a simple burger and fries because they kept forgetting my order. It wasn't even busy at the time, which only frustrated me further. But the icing on the cake was the utter lack of concern from staff who couldn't so much as offer a simple apology for the 35 minute wait. Shame, too, because the environment and location are beautiful.",2,,
24,Chicca - Kika D.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,6/18/2015,"Kody the bartender is terrific.   He's very personable, funny and entertaining.   He makes for a fun evening!",,,
25,Steve B.,"Arlington, VA",2,24,3,3.0,9/24/2014,They claim have Italian Beef Sandwiches but they don't. When they do I will return.  Every day if I can.,,,
