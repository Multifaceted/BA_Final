0,Benjamin B.,"Manhattan, NY",65,73,50,5.0,6/25/2018,"Cheap alcohol, a friendly gay environment, what more could you want?My friend brought me here one late Wednesday night after we saw a movie. It's slightly out of the way and located on 10th Avenue, but my friend is cute so I'll walk however long it takes.Even though the name ""Dive Bar"" would suggests a tiny sliver of a bar, I thought it was spacious enough for a Manhattan bar. The drink specials are $4 and there are also $5 frozen margaritas. Be careful because you could keep drinking and drinking.There are videos on the walls that play old (and good) pop songs. The bartenders are nice and fast. The people seem to stick to themselves, but friendly if you want to talk to them. It wasn't too busy that night and we got seats in the back to just chat and drink for hours.I had such a fun time, this is one of my starred places whenever I'm in Hell's Kitchen. Recommended.",,,

Updated review","UPDATE:If you're POC and a woman, you will likely be overcharged!!I came here again on a weekend night to meet up with friends. My friend, who is a woman and black, was charged $9 for a cocktail, so when I ordered a cocktail I expected to pay something within that range. I figured the last time I was there, it had to have been happy hour pricing, and I was surprised when I was told my drink would be $4 this last time I went. I'm on the medium side complexion-wise, so I have a 'pass' that I didn't ask for, hence, the lowered pricing.It is wrong on SO many levels to selectively cater to people with such disgusting bias. I will never support this business again!! I should have read the other reviews earlier on because what others have said completely rings true.",5,,1

Security guard must be a Reject from a REAL NYC club - He was the worst to me and my friends- been confrontational and aggressive. his attitude is simply homophobic !!! - it's just even not even worth it! The drinks were weak- the bartender told us to deal with it. My friends have also gotten the same experience here . There are a million bars in HK- don't bother!",3,1,1

I had gone to probably every gay bar and club in Greenwich village and Hell's Kitchen. Not a single bartender gave a damn about having a chat and filling me in on what fun things I can do in the community of NYC, not to mention their happy hours were extremely limited and expensive.I walk into DBL (Dive Bar Lounge) on a Wednesday afternoon and this GORGEOUS European bartender named Lloyd greeted this Floridian guy with a charming smile that could make anyone blush. Not only did this one of a  kind and friendly bartender inform me on exactly where to go to meet other friendly New Yorkers, but he also informed me on how sweet their happy hour prices are at DBL. $4 dollars for almost every drink or cocktail mixer you can think of, not to mention beer!If you are in NYC and near Hell's Kitchen! You have got to pregame your night at DBL and ask for Lloyd! You won't regret it! He literally was the highlight of my entire trip in NYC. I'll be coming back for sure!",4,1,1

5,Patrick B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/26/2017,"I would give no stars if I could. I came to this low class bar because friends wanted to. I ordered a drink I was told was ""asking a lot for a dive bar"". Granted, I just ordered a proper margarita. Then after the drink was made and paid for, I it was taken away from me cause the bar tender was wouldn't give it to me without receiving a tip, which I was going to give... Big presumption! Long story short. I was not served my drink, and my money was throw at me... Now his story is that i don't pay. Then why did he have to return $9 back to me... fucking trashHis names Donny by the way...",8,1,
6,Joe L.,"Floral Park, NY",1006,111,178,4.0,9/21/2017,Interesting bar with cheap drinks! The waitress was always attentive and knew when I was ready for another round. Great place to relax and have a great time with friends. FYI: CASH BAR,1,,
7,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,3.0,7/28/2016,"What a fun place!I have been here a couple of times, so I figured that it was time to write a review. First off can anyone say $5 dollar margaritas and outdoor (sidewalk) seating? I think that  this place is more a ""bar"" than a dive or a lounge. But, hey tomato, tomatoe. DBL seems to be a dive/bar/lounge that hosts a diverse crowd, based on race, sexual orientation, body type, and age. This diversity is rarely seem in many places in HK, so kudos for that. The drinks are pretty standard both in taste and size. I will say that the frozen margaritas are delicious because they are the ""creamy"" type of frozen margaritas.  There are about 7-9 small tables outside where on can enjoy his/her drinks while watching the sun set (if you sit on the street, not the avenue). Or rather, the reflection of the sun setting off of another building. All in all I had a decent experience. One of the bartenders was a little crabby. At first, I thought he was having a bad day but reading the comments about the owner is making me think that this attitude is normal. I guess that I will have to visit again to see if this is true or not.",5,1,4
8,Reggie M.,"Manhattan, NY",273,315,2690,5.0,5/14/2015,"The Dive Bar Lounge or DBL as we fondly call it, is the new gay bar addition to the Hell's Kitchen area. This place has been transformed numerous times, but I'm sensing this time it will stick around for a while. We love coming over here during happy hour, $5 frozen margarita on a hot spring days. $3 draft beer and well drinks.On a nice day you can sit at outside tables. This is really a great place to start a night.",24,17,19
9,Jerry C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",479,512,1238,3.0,5/11/2015,"Although the restrooms are too new and clean (for now) for a dive bar, Dive Bar Lounge or DBL still qualifies. The pour cheap liquor is $4 all the time. $4 drafts are Bud, Bud Light, Stella and DBL House Dark. The Dark was pretty smooth and decent after 3 frozen margaritas at $5 each. For some reason well margarita on the rocks are more expensive than the frozen ones and the $4 wells. Isn't it the same bottom shelf tequila?DBL is the third gay bar to open on this 10th Avenue block and the only one that managed to get sidewalk tables to hang out during good weather. Is this the new 9th Avenue Hells Kitchen gayborhood?",7,7,7
10,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,5.0,3/20/2016,"The $5 frozen margaritas and other drinks specials rule! Plus, on Sundays, they play some amazing music in the later afternoon, which can make for an awesome mini dance party in the back of the bar. Ok, DBL doesn't REALLY have a true dance floor, but we seem to make it one when we're there tooling around on Sunday afternoons.Other cool features about DBL include: 1. (Again) the margaritas -- these will not break the bank (did I mention they were $5), and they are the creamy (probably fattening) kind... but, oh so tasty2. The staff -- all the bartenders are really nice and work the crowd pretty quickly to serve up drinks at lightening speed3. The outdoor area -- perfect for warmer days... and to people watch as they walk down the street",8,2,5

First things first, you can't go wrong with $5 frozen margaritas ($6 for flavored ones). The bartender was friendly and the margaritas were pretty good. I started the evening off with a $3 starburst shot, which was delicious.  I'd definitely come back but not too late. I walked past this place around 11pm, and it was packed. Practically overflowing with people.",1,,1
12,Pooja C.,"New York, NY",167,539,640,4.0,4/15/2015,"First it was a sports bar with standard bar food, then a bar and sushi place, and now it's Dive Bar Lounge. Although this place has changed its theme a few times, I have to say I like the current one the best. You can't beat the $4 drink deal (house beer, plus the standard ones, and all Absolut vodka; some other liquors too which I don't remember), and the mixed drinks are fairly strong. Bartender has always been very friendly.Because it's still relatively new, it's not too crowded yet but more and more people are starting to come in. It does seem to be a gay bar (pretty standard for the area) but there's a fairly mixed crowd. Plenty of seating options for groups. There are speakers (and TVs) over every booth, which is kind of an odd choice since you can't really get away to a more quiet area, but they never play it so loud that you can't hear someone talking. Good selection of songs, too. This is definitely a good option to drink cheap in the area!",1,,
13,Ahmed A.,"Marietta, GA",156,3,1,1.0,7/15/2017,"I come here very usual. All bartender are amazing and most friendly. This spot have been so much fun but today I came at 6:44pm Saturday July 15th .

Honestly, I don't think I would've ever thought about coming back because it was just a place I stumbled upon but Seth definitely changed my perspective.

18,Emma F.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,6/25/2017,"The bartender, Donnie/Donny (with the s*** bird tattoos), is racist, nasty, and denied drinks to customers based on their ethnicity EVEN WHEN THEY ALREADY PAID.

Do not come to this place unless you want to be profiled or denied service before you are even given a chance to tip. Would give zero stars if possible.",3,,
19,Kimchee B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,32,10,1.0,11/8/2016,"The 'roided out redneck ape who owns this bar is a racist douchebag. Picture it: Election Night 2016. Queens falling out left and right trying to grapple with the reality that angry white men like this owner now run the country. After hours of waiting for better news we were finally hungry. A friend hailed a cab to go get pizza and I went with him to keep him company. There are tables outside where you can drink so when my friend said ""let's go"" I still had a cup in my hand. Still had it in my hand when we came back 5 minutes later. My bad. It was empty except for ice. I tried to tell the owner that. But the moment I stepped out of the cab he accosted me ""What was I doing?"" ""Where did I get the cup?"" ""YOU HAVE TO GO."" Total refusal to hear reason.I told him my purse and coat (and friends) were inside. Had been there for hours spending money and causing no trouble. But no, I had to go. Me. Not the white boy behind me staggering shit-faced with also a cocktail in his hand. Not the sloppy ass white girl who had been drunkenly (and loudly) bawling on the corner for half an hour. But the one brown-skinned patron left who dared to step out of a car entirely sober with a plastic cup of ice.Ok. If that's the world you want to live in.

Unlike its sister bars Mr. Biggs and Mickey Spillane's, this spot does $4 drinks all day. Making it easily the most affordable bar in the area.Inside - dark with a disco ball for lighting, seats along the edges and at the bar, a few small tables to put your drinks on....and that's pretty much it. As far as dive bars go though, the place is pretty clean and never obnoxiously loud. All well drinks are $4, and a few select beers. Frozen margaritas for $5 all day as well (though not many flavors like their counterparts).Service is friendly, and the crowds have been moderate, which makes getting a drink pretty easy. I'm hoping they re-open their outdoor seating for the summer to really make this place the perfect afterwork hangout.",,,
21,Mbarcia86 ..,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1,1.0,7/10/2016,"***DO NOT GO HEREThe owner of the bar was completely disrespectful, drunk, belligerent, and rude.  I was sitting outside with my friends having a peaceful evening when all of a sudden a guy comes over and kicks the divider between the sidewalk and the table, which I happened to be sitting next to.  I thought it was some random drunk guy on the side walk so I used my foot to move it back, and he started yelling at me, ""who the fuck do you think you are? Do you know who I am?""  I told him I didn't care who he was but he shouldn't be kicking things at people.  He then proceeded to tell me he was the owner and that I need to ""get the fuck out.""  He stepped up to me like he was trying to intimidate me by trying to fight me.  I told him that if he was the owner he needs to learn how to speak to his patrons, and that his behavior was unnecessary.  He then yelled at the security guard to ""kick me the fuck out"".  I went to the bar to pay my tab, and he started yelling at the bartender to take a picture of me. Bartender took a pic of me signing my tab, which was ridiculous, and the security guard even told me that the owner was the problem not me, but because he was the owner he has to make me leave (believe me, at this point I was glad to leave). I paid and left.  This guy was so egotistical, he's rude, and doesn't treat gays properly.  I told him I grew up here in the city and there are plenty of other places to go that treat their clientele correctly.  Ugh, he started listing off the places he ""owns"". Wish I could remember so nobody would support his businesses. Here's a pic of the scumbag.  Most vile and disgusting person I've ever come across.",15,2,4

With a dark lighting feel, a well stocked bar and enough space to fit a good small crowd it.

Yes the drinks are cheap but this owner does not respect gay culture or socializing. I'm an actor and was chatting with a friend and was removed from the bar for giving a friend a flyer. Silliest reason ever. I went graciously but was harassed in the street. This guy should be shut down for the way he treats people. If you want an evening of harassment this is the joint for you. This guy got physical on the street with me and I was already out of his bar. He could have informed me this was against his policy not gotten handsy. The first thing he said to me was ""mother fucker..."" I like my gay bars to be a safe place not hostile. He obviously has some rage issues and should not be in charge of a gay bar.",7,,2

28,Johnboy R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,15,0,1.0,5/5/2015,"This location can't seem to keep a bar - most recently it was Fast Eddies, which was a pretty good spot - friendly bartenders, cold beer, and a jukebox - automatic 3 stars out of the gate, right guys?Then Fast Eddies closed and up popped Dive Bar Lounge, or ""DBL."" First of all, DBL is not divey at all. It's only a ""lounge"" because they took out the tables, but the bar part is accurate, so I guess they got one thing right.For the first little while that it was open, it was fairly plain, and completely empty - barely any customers. There was talk of them serving pizza inside, but that quickly dissolved.But then they started promoting as a gay bar - this should come as no surprise because the owner/manager, Richie Friendley, is also the owner/manager of Mr. Bigg's and Mickey Spillane's, which are also Hell's Kitchen gay bars. Richie himself is notorious for being vulgar with his staff and horribly rude to his customers (which I can attest to personally, as can many yelpers in reviews of Mr. Bigg's and Mickey Spillane's).As soon as they really pushed their image a bit more, the place started filling up, and now with the weather getting nicer, they've placed wooden picnic tables outside for smoking/drinking. That's good advertising. Glad to see a bar getting some business on that corner, but...that's also where the major problem comes in - the large wooden tables are not usually brought in to the bar after closing, so you'll get drunks just sitting outside after hours, drinking, yelling, and singing. It's a pretty obnoxious. And the outside area is not all that big, so people end up spilling out onto the sidewalk a bit.The fact is, there are way better options in the area - if you're looking for a gay bar or you're looking to dance, Hardware is right up the street. Looking for a better atmosphere, something intimate, Pocket Bar is a block up and across the street, and if you're looking for a pub or sports bar, you've got Perdition and Landsdowne. On top of that you've got Pony Bar and now Kiabacca (which DOES serve pizza!)So if you're looking for a good time, head elsewhere. If you're looking to get called all sorts of four letter words by a 60 year old man in a white bandanna with no sleeves, DBL has you covered. It's a shame, because it's probably a 3 star establishment at least, but any time Richie is around, you can be sure someone is getting screamed at. But I guess the only way some men can feel big is by being the loudest voice in the room.",10,1,1

A couple of my friends and I walked up the bouncer and tried to show our IDs', to which we were greeted with ""private party, no one else allowed in."" I found this to be off because friends of ours were already inside, so we left and went to another bar down the street. About an hour later we return to find the same bouncer, who tells my friends and I that we ""must be at the wrong f**king place"" because we are not allowed in due to the fact that we are straight. FYI: I'm a 21 year old pansexual girl, who was meeting some straight friends already inside.

He said ""this is a boy's bar"". We were confused so we explained that we knew it was a gay bar and we are a lesbian couple. The bouncer again stated ""this is a boy bar"" and continued to block the door. My girlfriend and I felt we had no choice but to leave, confused and deeply offended by the bouncer's behavior. There should be no room for this kind of discrimination within the gay community. I sincerely hope this incident reflects the small minded point of view of one bouncer and not the policy of the entire bar.",8,2,
46,T T.,"Manhattan, NY",4,26,0,3.0,5/20/2015,"This place has potential... gay friendly with out door seating. Plus great pricing on the drinks. It's a shame the bartender can't stop talking long enough to make and serve a drink. I'm still baffled at the number of places in HK with the WORST bartenders in the city when there are so many people I'm sure could do a better job.""Seriously dude... SHUT THE HELL UP AND MAKE MY DRINK. It's a premade frozen margarita... all you have to do is fill the glass. And this was after I ordered one on the rocks and you said you didn't want to make one. That is your job!!!!""",,,
47,chris m.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,29,0,2.0,10/9/2015,"Now that I've read the reviews, I'm REALLY wondering WTF?   Place  is fine, bartender was sweet.  We popped in on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  A glass of plonk wine and a call brand martini was .... $20.  Huh? Everyone else is talking about $4 drinks all the time all day etc etc... Yes I know I got a call brand, but would that really spell a $10, or more,  upcharge? That doesn't seem right, especially when the Ritz down the road charges $7 fort the same drink and brand. .  Crowd was a bit young for us old folk, too, but that wouldn't have mattered had the drinks come with a reasonable tab (and not been served in a plastic cup, for that matter).   Ah well,  live 'n learn",2,1,1
48,Sasha T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/12/2015,"""If I could give no stars I would."" That's a quote I often laugh at while reading Yelp reviews but I mean it this time. They lost both me and my friend's credit cards. They claimed they could not find it though that is very suspicious as both of us ordered our drinks and handed over our cards at the same time. I have never had this happen to me at a bar before and I honestly don't care that they canceled the tab (it was only $5). I would have rather had them find the cards. Very disorganized place and very untrustworthy. Won't be coming back after this disaster.",6,1,1
