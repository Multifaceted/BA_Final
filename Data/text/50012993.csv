0,Ralph S.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,107,1,5.0,10/2/2018,"Stayed at the Wellington Hotel & breakfast was included here!  Eggs, potatoes, toast, meat (I went for the sausage) and beverage.  Wow was everything good!  Paid $159 for the room to include breakfast for two (versus $118) and I would do it again!  Choice of multiple items to choose for your meal, with several having a extra  $2 meat fee.  Nice place, friendly fast service.",,,
1,William M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,62,7,1.0,7/24/2018,"I live in New York, but every now and then am shocked at what I experience.  This is an old school diner - surly waitresses with thick accents, no standing room inside the door, bitter coffee, an expansive menu.  Needed a place to eat for a business meeting, and so had breakfast here this week:  Two scrambled eggs, pancakes, undrinkable coffee, and maybe something extra like sausage but I don't think so.  With tax and tip, my friend and I each ended up leaving $25.  Per person.So in other words, you are paying as much for the real estate - the privilege of sitting down in one of y the world's most expensive cities and having your own table.  And some protein.",,,
2,Daniel P.,"Tallahassee, FL",285,747,4550,3.0,3/12/2018,"Staying at the Wellington for the week, it's easy to come here at least once.  It's going to happen...  First off, it's adjoined to the lobby itself, so it gives semblance of being part of the hotel.  It's not (if it were, you'd be able to charge to the room - and apparently, you cannot).To me, the redeeming quality of the menu is that it features a Liverwurst sandwich.  Lord knows they likely don't move a lot of Liverwurst sandwiches - but nonetheless, I always take my chances.Come here for kitsch - and for a rerun of the late sixties / early seventies cafe/counter service experience.The prices are practically as unreasonable as the Benash Deli, across the street on 55th.  Those sonsabitches have no qualms to rob you blind (see my review from years ago - whence I vowed to last come to them.)Anyway - if you're staying at the Wellington for a week or two - the likelihood of you coming here is high - so brace yourself for gouging, and wrap it up with the cheesecake.  At least they make it in house, so you can justify the visit accordingly...",2,1,
3,Marilu F.,"Hialeah, FL",457,678,3215,3.0,2/14/2018,"I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. When our hotel gave us vouchers for a free breakfast at Park Café, we said why not? I mean, we only had breakfast plans for one day, not two, so this worked out in our favor.Found next to the Wellington Hotel, the spot is pretty big by NYC standards. There was also no wait. Perhaps this should've been a sign. I have to tell you that the food in itself was pretty unimpressive. It's one of those that made me grateful I didn't pay for this meal.I had scrambled eggs and toast. It came with a salad. Also had coffee and orange juice. The drinks were fine, the scrambled eggs bland, and the toast was slightly burnt at the edges. Edible still, but meh - it was one of those things that given the price it just wasn't worth it.My boyfriend didn't fare much better with his salad, toast, eggs, and bacon. At least the drinks were on point and we had the sweetest waitress, Viola. We never wanted for anything truly. Refills came when needed, questions about the city were answered, etc.For it being free, I am giving it three stars as it was okay. Still, I must confess that had it not been free, I would give this place two stars. Truth is I have eaten better food, and well, especially in a city like NYC, with so much variety, you know there's so much better out there.",5,3,4
4,TaShane H.,"Rosenberg, TX",230,138,124,3.0,3/14/2018,"For the food I would give it 2 stars, but the service bumped it to 3 for me. Good and friendly service can be hard to find in NYC so it's important to acknowledge it when you find it. The food is meh. It's equivalent to what an under average at home cook would make. No real flavor, soggy, basic. And when NYC is flooded with various restaurants it's important to make yours standout. Pancakes are nothing more than bisquick, home potatoes are soggy, and syrup is in a peel and pour smuckers cup. And on top of this the average breakfast plate is about $15. Skip this place and find you a good breakfast for a less price and thank me later!",1,2,1
5,Samantha D.,"Deer Park, NY",22,2,7,2.0,11/4/2018,The food tasted and looked like it got cooked from a microwave. Chicken fingers and frenchfries for kids were soggy (drenched in oil).

6,Suzanne M.,"Holden, MA",37,99,206,3.0,4/29/2018,"Hello NYC! This was our first stop after checking in at the Wellington Hotel. I felt like I was on a Seinfeld episode. Traditional, packed diner with everything on the menu, as diners often do. After taking a few deep breaths after viewing the prices ($12.25 for a BLT!?), we placed our order from a woman who I swear looked like Vera from Mel's Diner (you won't get it if you weren't alive in the 80s...). I swear... our food was out in 4 minutes or less. I'm still not quite sure how they did this as crowded as it was. It was magical. And honestly, the food was good!They moved us in and out a bit like cattle. There was nowhere to stand and wait for a table except right next to people eating, so that's a bit awkward... hence the 3 stars.",1,,

Updated review","Where do you go for breakfast in Manhattan with a first date? Wife and I balked at paying $20 for a grab and go breakfast on the 26th floor of our $300+ Manhattan Club hotel room -for that kind of money they should provide breakfast, just like the $200+ Comfort Inn Hotels in NYC.Last year during our week stay in Manhattan, the best value was the Park Café on 57th and 7th.  We gave it a go this time, but with a special visitor, none other our Yelp friend, Marianne W, with 4580 friends, 755 reviews in less than 3 years in Yelp!Prepared like a first date, hair just washed from the shower, teeth brushed, dressed in designer jeans.   Now Marianne W and I had never met in person, but both of us had a lot in common, only 4 years apart in age, and when we met, it was if old friends had reunited after decades apart.Turned out that she had spent some of her years after college at Berkeley, at about the same time I was there in the 1970s.  .We come up through the double doors of the Park Café -needed with the wind howling down 7th Ave from nearby Central Park, and are assigned a table right next to the front door.  Well, beggars can't be choosey, although my wife would rather sit farther from the drafty door.Clean table, clean booth, typical diner, with most of the booths filled - a good sign at 1015am on a Monday.  Nice ambiance with wood furnishings, hard black marble like table, with a view of pedestrians freezing their butts off outside.I get the $11.45 single egg with potatoes and two sausage, while the wife orders a $14.95 mushroom cheese omelet,  and Marianne gets the $12.45 bacon with potatoes and eggs.  Unlimited coffee is $2.75 per person -hey they got to make money somehow! Service is brisk, with coffee served immediately, and our toast coming shortly thereafter.  I get wheat toast, as does the wife, while Marianne gets rye toast -something you would never see me order!Serving sizes are huge, which is why I only ordered a single scrambled egg.  Lots of potatoes, and the sausages are about double the diameter of the usual sausage you see in the Bay Area.  Good basic food at a bargain price for midtown Manhattan.   Now Marianne is a very short and slight in stature, compared to my wife and I.  But dang can that woman put food away when she's hungry!  Haven't seen such an appetite, since my cat scarfed down food back home, after 3 days starving at the vet, with it's nose to the ground.  Glad to see that she enjoyed her food.  Delightful woman to converse with.The ladies take a rest room break -every two hours for senior coffee drinking women, while I pay the bill at the counter, along with a line of other customers.Turns out that they had to use our hotel restrooms, next door, with my wife using our hotel electronic key to open the restroom stall!",19,13,19
9,Kristín M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",121,73,105,3.0,2/4/2018,"I wish Yelp had the possibility to give stars for different sections...This place would get 5 stars for atmosphere. Nice to hang out and good for people watching. However it would get 1 star for food, we had cakes and they were really not good.Would go there again though for coffee and chill.",,,

15,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1115,19792,4.0,5/10/2017,"Park Cafe gets four stars because it's overpriced compared to Uptown. My uptown diners typically have free coffee with breakfast during week days. This is a tourist area of town. It's expected. Let me tell you the good things! Our service was top notch from the cutest young lady. She was very professional in my eyes. My order was perfect the way I requested. She offered to take our photo. She's tourist friendly. Everyone waiting on us was on top of their game. From filling the water to coffee refills. Plates were promptly cleared and the bill brought timely. I felt like I was in a diner of old. The diner where there's no doubt Service will be top of the line. I felt comfortable in the booth. I had a nice street view. I also prefer to sit by the door facing it. It's an old Italian thing my Dad taught me. It was great! I sat across from Robert and Janeen so I could enjoy both of them in conversation. I try to eat slow, but it was so good I know I wolfed it down. Delicious! As I mentioned I was with Yelp friends Robert and his wife Janeen. Their food looked delicious too. I didn't hear any complaints. In fact they've been to Park Cafe before. It was their suggestion. Excellent choice I might add! Not to mention how kind of them to buy me breakfast. I really enjoyed their company for the day! We walked off breakfast in Central Park. I gave them the Marianne quick tour! The lower half of the park. Next time I'll get them to come Uptown! I hope they return. I like that they can keep up with my pace! I don't sit for long. Come visit you'll see. We can have a meal at Park Cafe!",66,42,66

Came in with my affiliates for some breakfast before a meeting and i have to say two thumbs up. I order the Western Omelette with turkey sausage it came equipped w/ peppers & onions. Great combo! The orange juice was freshly squeezed and chilled to perfection. Big s/o to the homie Domingo, one of the greatest waiters of all time. Didnt move until we were ready to order which took a little minute. All of my folks enjoyed their meals as well, i'd definitely come back!! On wood.",,,

Don't waste your money and time here.",,,
18,Madison W.,"Washington, DC",0,14,1,1.0,7/20/2018,"We made a last minute decision to come here and we needed something close. We were staying in the hotel across the street and someone in our party had limited mobility.  I regret not having checked the yelp reviews. In a nutshell, the food is overpriced, the quality of the food is sub par, and the service is not too bad. I was totally shocked that there's no kids menu.  Also the ""fine dining"" sign outside is misleading.  It seems like the kind of casual place that would have a kids menu. I would not recommend this place. There are tons of better places to eat in NYC.",,,

No taste and nothing good about it two pieces of small chicken and some rice the broth was not homemade and lacked and taste. I also ordered a grilled cheese sandwich which was burned at the bottom but turned over so I didn't see that side. Which this is received pickle, tomato, lettuce. This sandwich lacked taste as well.Save your money!",,,

27,Kenneth C.,"Washington, DC",124,62,126,1.0,7/19/2017,"Just to be blunt, the food here tasted like pond water. When my family and I sat down, I noticed the the table was a bit sticky. And the salt in the salt shaker was plastered and cemented onto the walls and bottom of the shaker, unable to do its one job and season food. As I made mental notes of these drawbacks, I ordered a regular cheeseburger because it was really the only platter under $20. Upon receiving my food, I was greeted by the comical sight of the ubiquitous Kraft cheese melted onto a beef patty the color of a dirty quarter. While our waitress was still handing our food to us, I asked for mayonnaise; and a different waitress came by and handed me ONE packet of mayonnaise for a whole burger and fries. And to make matters worse, the one packet she gifted me had something resembling honey mixed with ketchup and sewer water slathered over it. But even after this whole situation, I still obliged to eat at least half my dinner because I was taught to not judge a book by its cover. Well, that said, I should have judged that book by its cover. The burger was quite unsavory and unfortunately, the seasoning that I needed to finish the burger was either stuck to the sides of a salt shaker or encased in a packet of embalming fluid. After eating dinner at this establishment and then subsequently checking its yelp page, I was genuinely shocked at how Park Cafe didn't have an average rating of 1 star. The only explanation that I could muster up was perhaps the cafe's historical significance. After trying the food for yourself and looking at the diner's yelp rating, you might ask yourself the same question that I asked, ""was the cafe featured in a movie?"" No, no it wasn't. Needless to say, the experience was unacceptable and just bad.Tips - If you have money to blow and loads of time to spare, then BY ALL MEANS walk to Park Cafe, and then walk past Park Cafe and peruse somewhere else.",11,8,

My friends and I went to this place to eat lunch and asked the simple question ""do you have a gluten free menu"" the waitress proceeded to say ""you know what you can eat"" this was extremely rude and inconsiderate considering all food is prepared in different ways. My friend is deathly allergic to gluten and this waitress did not have a care in the world for her safety or health. I then proceeded to tell the woman sitting behind the front desk what had happened to us and she straight up told us to just leave. We were more than willing to leave considering how awful the staff treated us. I have never been spoken to or treated so badly by an employee of a restaurant that I had to write this review. I recommend no one goes here.",2,,

The place had a bit of a crowd, but we were able to be seated right away.For my meal, I decided to go with the chicken kebab plate. It came with a bowl of lentil soup, which was alright and the plate itself was decent. Some of the chicken was over cooked, and there wasn't that much of it for $20, but the grilled veggies were done decently.So why the 2 star review? This place probably has 3 star quality food, but at 5 star prices. In addition, the service is pretty aloof.",4,,

I've never had such a pathetic sandwich in my life, and it comes with literally no sides. No French fries, coleslaw, fruit, nothing. The tuna melt looked atrocious. I don't know how this place is still running. $80 for 4 of us to eat, which none of us finished our food because it was so bad, and we literally left and went to find somewhere else to eat.

I'm not sure if this place is belong to the hotel, or just supporting the hotel, but as a hotel guests you will get free breakfast ticket from the reception and you can use it for breakfast here. This was the case for me, I was staying with my partner in the hotel for quite long for holiday, so we came here quite often during the staying. The breakfast card only offer really limited options, for a short time, it probably wouldn't become a problem. But visitors like us, who's planning to stay here for awhile, it could be a bit boring after awhile. The breakfast itself wasn't bad at all. It was a typical amercian style breakfast, bacons, ham and eggs, pancakes and sausages. I found it quite oily each meal. probably put on some weight aleady. Well, It happened quite often in holiday anyway. After awhile we tried it order soemething else, they would accoding the breakfast ticket value added up the price of what you ordered. that extra guest can paid at the end of the meal. I also checked about the price on their menu. I did find it quite expensive, maybe not for the standard here, it probably because of its locaion, just 10 mins on foot to reach Central Park. Inside the place didn't have wifi, hotel policy. It was quite logical, since the hotel charged people for internet. The staff which working here were quite efficient. although we came here usually need to wait on the line, it didn't really take so long till we got a table.sometime might took around 10 mins, but I haven't realls seen somebody was waiitng so long.

The place looked nice enough and we had good service and a nice waitress but I had the worst hot open turkey sandwich (see photo). For about $15 you'll get what looks and tastes like bad school cafeteria food, from the dry turkey to the bright, mustard/curry colored gravy. It was chicken gravy btw. They even screwed up my baked potato! So dry. The other people in my party were more satisfied with their dishes: a decent chicken breast pita plate, a bacon cheeseburger with steak fries, a chicken salad sandwich and a sausage omelette.NOTE: NO FREE refills and drink sizes are small.

I sat at the bar (and have barista experience) and saw the steam wand behind used over and over again (by multiple staff members) without a cleaning during the one hour I sat there. Without a cleaning, bacteria gets caked up on the dried milk and is then injected into the coffee repeatedly. This is a serious health concern.

63,M. N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,28,13,1.0,8/13/2016,"WORST food we had in all of New York!! Ohh, I'm so sad I didn't use Yelp to study up before I took my family. Two adults and two children, our bill was $86 before tip. I actually started an argument with my hubby in the diner about how horrible the food was, never mind the ridiculous high prices and the small portions. My family was ravenous and we went in unYelped! We had just finished biking for 2 hours at Central Park. Please please be warned! Other dear Yelpers didn't include menu pics to prove to you how exorbitant the prices are for terrible food! I was so infuriated that dinner was so below mediocre that I purposely took pictures of the menu prices just so I could Yelp it later. My hubby ordered corned beef hash and it turned out to be from a CAN!!! Of course just to prove my point (more to my hubby who always thinks I'm exaggerating) I asked the waiter and she said yes. When I asked her very politely in my strained soft manner, why she didn't tell me when I ordered, she replied, ""I'm sorry, you should have asked. I'm not allowed to tell the customer unless they ask."" At least she was apologetic. See my pics of the corned beef hash & look for it in my menu pic -- $15 for CANNED food. I ordered the Spanish omelet that wasn't even an omelet! Any true test of a chef is their omelet, this should alone tell you how bad the food is here. Park Cafe's so called omelet is actually a scrambled thin ""pancake"" of an egg, folded in half, topped with tomato sauce with veggies (celery, bell peppers) It was terrible. My daughter ordered pancakes, safe choice right? Wrong! They were thin, rubbery and dry. $13 for 3 pancakes...ughh I'm so angry and disgusted at these people who can rip off others. That's right THREE terrible pancakes for $13!!!! Oops wait, with syrup and butter. We also ordered the steak and eggs, which was ok. First time my son didn't eat all his steak and actually offered us some. Also ordered was the burger deluxe. Don't let the deluxe word fool you, it doesn't come with onions or cheese. It's just 2 slices of tomatoes & a piece of iceberg, pickle spear, french fries and a small plastic cup of coleslaw. When I say small, it is the size you get at other restaurants for to-go sauces like tarter sauce. What a joke this ""cafe"" is. I've included several pictures only to serve as proof that it IS CANNED potatoes & beef! Don't believe me? Call them instead, I'm sure they wouldn't lie, or shouldn't lie. How can you charge me $15 for a $3 can? Incredulous. I'm completely upset hours later on how I got fleeced for $100. Park Cafe laughs all the way to bank on how they can get away with serving canned & frozen food to hardworking tourist. We are still arguing over whose fault it was that we even decided to eat here.",3,,

Perfect for those who have performances in Carnegie Hall once in a while, frequent this place. As a tourist, you will find this place comfy and charming. I can't even imagine how much these poor people pay for rent in such a key location, so I understand the prices. Just be prepared.

Well i was only paying 15 dollars lol     My friend had a spinach omelet and not being a potato fan asked for a salad on the side and of course she got fries.

I haven't tried anything other than the sandwich, but I'm sure people that don't like the food here don't know what to order. When you walk into a traditional cafe, stick to sandwiches and breakfast items, don't go buying something you would find in a fancy restaurant because it most likely won't be good...If you want something along the lines of a quality steak or lamb chops, do it right and go to Smith and Wollensky or something.

There are other options than here so I would look elsewhere.",1,,
107,Sigmund V.,"Pittsford, NY",22,77,40,3.0,3/30/2016,Meh - like any other diner - nothing special.  About $11-$13 for an omelet.  Service is OK,,2,

110,Jackie M.,"Bronx, NY",11,76,55,2.0,1/11/2015,"I pass here a lot and it seems busy in the mornings so this morning I needed breakfast so I went in. Boy was I sorry! The breakfast menu is like 12 items, not what I expected for a diner. And none of the item looked so good, also I think it was $8 for one egg any style...steep for any restaurant!  I had a coffee and a pastry. Service was poor, i sat down and waited 5mins for a menu, despite the server standing behind me. Then I didn't see her again until she dropped the check, and I took her  almost 10mins to come back and pick it up after I waved it at her. I think this place is only busy because it's attached to the hotel? Maybe breakfast from here is included in some of the room rates? I won't be going here again, so disappointed",1,,

When you consider that I've sustained myself eating brocolli covered in ranch dressing and other delicacies...this statement is quite strong. Park Cafe. Not good. Caters to unsuspecting tourists. Unfortunately, we were staying at a hotel nearby, had approximately 30 minutes to ""dine"" before Mad Men, and needed somewhere quick, easy and inexpensive. We should've found a taco cart. Or a candy bar and a Gatorade. Would've been an vast improvement. From the unaffected service, outdated decor, bad lighting, cheap wine, slop food...well, I'm so sorry but I cannot find anything redeeming. My Western omelette (I'm a firm believer that omelettes are super hard to screw up) was screwed up. It looked soft and pre-chewed. It tasted the same. It came with french fries. Strange? Yes. And cold toast. The soda was flat. And...the grand total? About $45. Criminal. I mean honestly, I love me a good diner  and can grub on some good old American fare like the best of 'em, but this place is the PITS. Avoid at all costs.",13,5,6
112,Natacha I.,"Pasadena, CA",168,17,3,3.0,3/22/2016,"This place served its purpose for us during our stay in NY. Our hotel, Park Central, was right across the street so it made for easy breakfast. We kept it simple with just sunny side up eggs and whole wheat toast and coffee. I will say that the service is HORRIBLE. They employ an older staff, which is fine, but they were so slow with everything.  I mean, bad. Attitudes all day! Oh you want more creamer? HOW DARE! It only seemed to be bad with the female staff. When we'd get a guy, it was smiles and laughs all day. Anyway, if you're hungry and your hotel doesn't offer breakfast, the food is good, so this place will do. Just set your expectations low...very low.",,,

When it comes to diner, I usually get breakfast. As such, I ordered two eggs with turkey sausage. The ran out of home fries so they substituted French Fries. While the food was decent, it was way overpriced. It was not worth $15+ (after tax and tip). Of course, it is overpriced since it is in Midtown. However, I worked in that area for 7 years and there are way better deals for that kind of money. If you are really craving breakfast or diner food, do not mind paying more than you normally, and Park Cafe is where you are, then go for it. I personally know the area too well to go back.

We were seated promptly at a booth right when you walk into the restaurant but throughout the entirety of the meal, the wait staff all stood around our table and leaned on the back of the booth to sit on their cellphones or have their own personal conversations. I got the turkey club on wheat and my boyfriend got a pastrami sandwich on a roll. I love my bread toasted but this bread was BURNT. My sandwich was super dry (even after adding two mayo packets to it). My boyfriend's pastrami was really tough and impossible to cut through. The most satisfying food that we had were the pickles.",1,,
121,Danielle P.,"New York, NY",1,18,0,1.0,9/11/2015,Do not go!! This place is outrageously priced - even for mid-town Manhattan. They charged us $6.75 for 1/2 a grapefruit!!

That is about all I can say for it. Service was rude. Coffee was ok, but served in teeny tiny cups and with packs of...milk?!?! I have never even seen little packets of milk...ever. It was weird. I had the egg sandwich and the eggs were really overcooked, the bacon was alright, nothing exciting. BF had the pancakes, they tasted like they came from a box of generic brand pancake mix.

They are kid friendly and have a variety of items (french toast, pancakes, eggs) for the kids. I recommend several of the menu items: the challah bread French toast, the meat loaf, the turkey and stuffing, and the roast beef. Burgers are great as well and the serve steak fries :-)Its a nice, comfortable place, with good food and a relaxed atmosphere. Pick the window booth, the people watching is an added attraction.",,,

Save yourself the $ and spare your stomach and major disappointment and hit one of the many deli-cafes on 7th Ave or one of the gazillion falafel trucks.

That was extremely uncomfortable. I ordered the fried fish, shrimp, and scallops. For starters....my plate bottom was nothing but grease. My food was dripping with it. I took one bite of the scallops and it had a weird taste it very chewy. Just to see if I was just over exaggerating I asked my friend to take a bite as well. She tasted it too.

It gets one star for the good French dressing! It gets another for reminding me of Mel's diner in Hollywood .. The grilled cheese (and pickle on the side) was amazing (almost as good as my moms!) and the chicken and rice soup was good.. I think it was Campbell's though.. Cuz it was very yellow.

Loved the tart grapefruit juice, and if I had more room in my stomach, I would've tried some of their pastries and desserts. Definitely go here for an excellent sit-down breakfast in the upper Times Square area.

The steak fries were good but nothing to write home about. My friend enjoyed her salad, which was HUGE (and she got the small!) and covered with tons of chicken. My other friend gobbled his gyro platter up in about 5 minutes.Prices are what to be expected at a midtown diner. My burger and fries (also came with a pickle and small ramekin of coleslaw) was $12. Service was good. Our food came quickly and our waters were always filled. Our waitress was kind enough to take a picture of the group and then asked if we were family, which I found hilarious because I am a tall white girl and my friends were both Japanese. I will definitely go back if I am in the area!",1,,1

170,Julian M.,"Studio City, CA",5,43,1,1.0,2/28/2013,Unfriendly staff combined with overpriced food that is incredibly mediocre.  Seriously...why would you do this to yourself?  Best to avoid.,1,,
171,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,1.0,8/24/2008,"The food is downright nasty.  I've dined out numerous times in my lifetime combined with having been previously been with my former love, an avid cook who have previous professional food service experience thus, I'm knowledgeable about the quality of food.  Rotisserie chicken is what you get when I ordered Chicken Teriyaki!!?  There's anchovy in caesar salad--automatically without specifically requesting it.  The wait staff have never experience fine dinning elsewhere as they don't know what you're talking about when you tell them you don't want anchovy.  The wait staff can't speak English either.  I DON'T recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1,2,
172,Matt V.,"Antwerp, NY",0,4,0,3.0,6/21/2015,"Decent food, but way too pricey. Service could be better, but every time I have been there, it has been completely packed. So maybe I am missing something.  Because of that rounded my 2.5 rating up to a 3 stars.",,,
173,A. E.,"Manhattan, NY",12,55,3,2.0,2/10/2013,"Over priced for the poor quality food, even for a diner. Service is too fast. Omelets are over-cooked and dry.  There are too many other options within walking distance to waste your money here.",1,,
174,Jonathan W.,"Allen, TX",0,33,1,2.0,3/10/2015,"Food is definitely not good. It's edible but far from good. Prices are not cheap either, although not expensive given the location. Still, not worth it given so many better options nearby.",,,

176,Carmen V.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/17/2013,"I had such a bad experience at this place that I just opened a Yelp account to write this review. I got to Park Cafe tonight at 5.30 pm, ordered dinner and a coffee. Immediately after I was done with my grilled cheese (pretty terrible, btw), I was given the check (which I didn't ask for), but since I was still drinking my coffee, I kept reading my book. A few minutes later, my cup still half-full, the manager came to ask me to pay and LEAVE. When I said I wasn't done and that I had only arrived half an hour ago, he replied in a very condescending, inaproppiate tone, just insisting that I leave. No apologies, no explanations. He then proceded to tell the same thing to the people sitting at the table behind me. Granted, I understand that they had people waiting, but I'm a paying client and they were really rude. Not a good way to treat customers.",,,
177,Fabio F.,"São Paulo, Brazil",115,2,1,5.0,4/4/2014,"During a travel to NY last week, I was staying close to this place, and ended going there for 3 or 4 times, mostly late night, before going to bed, but the last time for lunch. Our experience was amazing all the times, food is very good, price is honest, service is good and waiters are on a good mood. We met the owner, who is always there during the night period and told him we would definitely recommend Park Cafe!",1,1,1
178,Wes J.,"Nicholasville, KY",4,3,9,5.0,4/8/2012,"After eating breakfast many places in the city, by far the best place. Service was great and the food came out fast. They informed us that coke refills were a charge, which was refreshing, since most places let you see the bill first. Highly recommended.",1,1,1
179,Joan L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,12,0,1.0,12/3/2011,"We ate here as it was a convenient place to meet for city center.  I eat out often internationally and keep a list of the worst eating places and this is high on the list.  Prices seem low unless you consider the food is unbelievably poorly prepared.   Wasn't sure what to order so I ordered blinzas.  Easy to fix, right?  No, they deep fried them like French fries.  Another meal was a hot turkey sandwich.  Hard to screw up, right?  Well not if you put a yellow gravy pre-prepared from a can on them.  One person ordered an omelet.  That was mediocre.  In manhattan one expects good food.  No reason not to have it.  Even in cafes.  Stick to a smaller menu and do it well and use fresh ingredients.  We were seated quickly and service was OK.  If you need the rest room expect to have to request a key and to go to the hotel lobby next door.",1,2,2
180,Victoria R.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,35,52,1.0,8/8/2011,"It was really creepy in here. The service was weird, as were the servers. Way too expensive for the little we got. The water glasses were kind of dirty with water spots. Only my plate was taken away while my 3 companions were also done  and had less food on their plates. I was sorry that I recommended this place to my family. Their current rating of 2.5 was deserved.",4,2,
181,Judith G.,"New York, NY",522,252,79,2.0,12/28/2009,"The simple fact is that I wanted to go to the Carnegie Deli and the wait was about an hour to two.It was tourist season and everybody seemed to converge on this establishment and 'The Stage Deli,' as well.I had my mom with me, who was barely able to walk any longer, and I was not in such good shape, either, after having my waded through the crowds to go to Rockefeller Center.  I was on a mission to photograph the store front and decorations before they came down.Never again, during the rush.They Park Cafe seemed close enough, and having no energy to walk another step we all rolled into this place.  It was so mobbed that there was a ten minute wait, but there were three seats at the counter.Fine, by me, I said.  It coudn't have mattered less.My advice to you, go here only as a last minute emergency and order the most basic thing on the menu.  The chef salad was big but so dry and tasteless, I had one bite and recoiled in disgust.My own choice was a chicken salad club.  The chicken salad itself was not bad.  Pretty chunky and fresh.  But the bacon, which I asked for well done, was not crispy but merely dry and like shoe-leather.  Ugh.  Needless to say, I took it off.  The sandwich was big enough, so I could not complain about that - but at about  $12.00 it should be.My mother ordered (very wisely) a spinach and mozzarella omellette.She did not complain so it must have been okay.The French fries we ordered had to be send back.  They were huge and undercooked and somewhat greasy.  After having them crisped up, I managed to eat a few drowned in lots of ketchup.  They were actually gross.The staff at the counter was the saving grace.  Mexicans, greeks, and a polish waitress, all willing to laugh at our jokes, and one girl three in a free diet Coke can, without our even asking.Otherwise, my advice, get the hell out of the neighborhood.  If you can find a cab, it is better spent, heading up away from this crazy fray to somewhere uptown.",,2,
182,Chaz S.,"Boston, MA",11,39,0,4.0,2/21/2011,"Stopped in for lunch and had a triple-decker turkey club. While not quite on the level of nearby competitors (Carnegie, Stage), the food was still quite good, complete with sandwich fries, and pickle. Service was extremely quick, and the staff was courteous. Would definitely return for more.",1,1,1
183,Shannon W.,"San Rafael, CA",3,227,0,4.0,12/16/2010,"Upon entering Park Cafe, you automatically feel that you are in a diner- wooden booths, counter tops where you can read the New York Times and grab a cup of coffee, and a bell being rung to notify the waiters that your food is ready. When we ordered from our booth, we decided upon the tuna sandwich, pancakes (came with a side order of bacon and eggs), and the mushroom omelet. The sandwich and the pancake dish were both very good and fresh, but the omelet was just O.K. It was a little dry and when asked for mozzarella cheese was given cheddar. Park Cafe was a pleasant dining experience but was not as good as its across-the-street competitor, Ben Ash.",1,,1

Apple pie was pre-made (of course, where isn't it) and very expensive. But, here's the worst. Heinz ketchup bottle filled with some other stuff. How did I know? It ran out of the bottle...and, I hadn't even tipped it yet. Couldn't wait to get out.Ok, if it's late at night, you need something fast and aren't looking for refills.",,1,

She was hispanic, tall with blonde hair on the dark side, she had a chewing gum while she was working. I did ask my girlfriend if we did something so she could have that attitude but NO!!! She didnt even say good evening... With a few words, never going back!! I dont racomend anyone",,,

Who cares.  It's the atmosphere that's a little off.  Not as bustling as a quick mid-day lunch with the family.  So what- you get your fix and you're out.",,1,
189,Trevor T.,"Irvine, CA",80,366,27,2.0,1/18/2009,"Based on my breakfast order, their food is average and nothing to write home about. My order was for eggs (over-easy), home fries, bacon and wheat toast. Everything came out hot and cooked perfectly. Service was good.",1,,
190,Daniel B.,"Charlotte, NC",32,70,45,3.0,5/18/2009,"Best turkey burger ever!!  Ate here twice - once for dinner (A+), the other for breakfast (C-).  Service at dinner was fantastic, but breakfast the next morning wasn't so hot (neither was the food; just avg really).  Overall I really liked the place & still crave another t-burger!  Great local NYC cafe atmosphere with good people watching out the window along 7th.  Good location just a few blocks from Times Square & just 2 or 3 blocks from Central Park.  Saw a reference to ""fine dining"" in another review related to service.  it's a cafe, not the Four Seasons, so expectations should be set accordingly.  Prices are somewhat avg for the city, but I did find the prices for sides at breakfast too high...$7 for a side of bacon?  I wasn't charged that much for a side of bacon on my burger the day before, so???  Overall good place, just don't expect a 5 star experience...it's a local cafe, so be ready for that.  Oh, one other slightly odd point - if you're paying with cash you pay at the register by the door; if paying by card you have to go the counter near the hotel entrance.",2,1,1
