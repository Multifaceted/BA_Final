I am so glad he chose this one. As we walked in, the Aura of the place was very romantic, the air said Love and Romance, there was so much harmony in this place a unique ambiance. The decoration was lovely, a very classy high end restaurant with a casual touch and reasonable prices.The 5 stars are well deserved for the first visit, the food was amazing and tasty. The mash potatoes were for me, the best one I had so far, I can do the mash potatoes every day here. I had the fried chicken which was delicious, and my friend gave me a taste of his steak which was super delicious and on the spot with the flavor and seasoning, just when I thought that I had the best steak, well, the steak here was also one of the best, good thing I am always trying and tasting new things and places, what an amazing eating experience. The Brownie was excellent, and you know, not every restaurant can produce a good one.The service was very attentive and friendly by everyone. This is just one of the best places to eat in NYC and will be on my list to bring special friends for the best eating experience.",5,3,4
1,Melanie C.,"Honolulu, HI",231,53,207,3.0,11/17/2018,"I came here on a Friday night because it was one of the few places that had a reservation availible. The place was pretty packed and the tables are extremely close together (I'd say a couple inches). The ambiance is pretty hip and lively and makes for a great date spot!The food decent but nothing special, and the service wasn't great. I tried the carnitas tacos, which was yummy but a little too salty, and my friend had the chicken pot pie, which was slightly bland. Prices are pretty standard as far as NYC goes. The server took forever to take out order and I eventually had to flag her down myself.Overall, Elmo wasn't terrible but also wasn't great. The only way I'd come back here would be if I couldn't get a table anywhere else.",1,,1

We had the Popcorn Shrimp and Guacamole as starters and it sure opened my appetite, while drinking frozen açaí margaritas! The food is really good and I had one of the best Fried Chicken Sandwich I've ever had in a long time! I would definitely come back and recommend it to people!!!",,,

The food is not awful but just not my taste and honestly nothing impressing. I have tried a few things and the only thing that sticks out for me​ is the Fried Cauliflower. I have fallen in love with them which is the only reason I am okay with returning​  (kidding, I don't really have a choice). I got a grilled cheese once and the cheese was not melted. I had to mention that because​ that was the point where I just gave up.The atmosphere is nice and the staff including delivery​ guys are great!Unfortunately, ​I am just not a fan.",2,1,

Updated review","A girlfriend and I enjoyed a brunch here this beautiful fall afternoon.  We were happy to snag a spot outdoors.  I ordered the three-egg omelet with mushroom, spinach, and cheddar, which came with fries and a salad.  Everything was fine; although nothing was particularly special or will bring me back anytime soon.",,,
6,Jessica C.,"New York, NY",261,179,591,4.0,4/5/2018,"I loved the food and atmosphere at Elmo but the drinks were too pricey. Drinks started at $14 and they don't have happy hour specials ::gasp::. For my dish, I had the 1/2 chicken with cauliflower rice and mussels. Both were delicious but I can't say the same about my pomegranate margarita. For $16 i should've been able to taste nothing but tequila and pomegranate, unfortunately my drink tasted like flavorless shaved ice. The service was also so-so. Our waiter was great but I had to flag him down several times through the busboys because he was often nowhere to be found. I will probably revisit this place again but I certainly will only be drinking water when I go lol.",1,,1
7,Sam E.,"Queens, NY",140,119,296,4.0,4/3/2018,"Solid for brunch, lunch or dinner. I think it's a great location in Chelsea and it has a really fun atmosphere. For my brunch I got the the ""Elmo big breakfast"" which is great if you struggle with deciding what to get for breakfast since it has a little bit of everything in it! Comes with eggs your way, avocado toast, bacon, sausage, smashed potatoes, and a roasted tomato. A very hearty breakfast. Highlights were that the bacon was crisp, the potatoes were well seasoned, and the eggs were cooked to my liking. The ""avocado toast"" was just kind've small (it was on a little, over-toasted buttery crostini) so that would be my one piece of constructive criticism. My date got the eggs Benedict with salmon which hit all the right notes. We both got cocktails with our brunch for only $7 each, a great way to start the day!",1,,
8,Patrick B.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,410,11,4.0,8/6/2018,"This place is super cute!  I was visiting NYC and decided to stop in for dinner on a Friday night.  There was a good size crowd, but not too crazy.  They have a intimate bar area and both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service staff are very friendly, and not bad to look at!  Some handsome boys and girls here...  I enjoyed a Blood Orange Cosmo (really yummy!) and the Southern Fried Chicken.  The food was tasty and the portion, generous.  I will definitely be back on on my next trip to NY!",,,
9,Ariella G.,"Brooklyn, NY",223,82,9,4.0,3/9/2018,"This review is strictly for drinks, of which I've had several over the past year or so given that my friend absolutely loves this place. We've swung by here after brunch at Cafeteria or somewhere else nearby to continue the fun, and the cute bartenders at Elmo serve up fun on a platter via their dangerously delicious blood orange cosmopolitans and watermelon martinis. Both the seating areas and bar are spacious, so even on busier weekend afternoons it isn't hard to snag a spot at the bar or at one of the adjacent tables. While I've only had drinks here, I imagine this would be a great spot for a group brunch as there is a good deal of space, or somewhere you'd take your friend or mom/aunt who is visiting from out of town and wants to have a campy, slightly trendy good time in the city a la Sex And The City. Though its not a place that I would go out of my way for, it is a good option for drinks in an area that often leaves you spoiled for choice. Will have to come back for some food and to sit outside for some prime people/dog watching come summer.",1,,
10,Julia M.,"New York, NY",19,3,0,2.0,10/23/2018,"the place is extremely cute, trendy, music on point. The food sounds great on paper but execution is just MEH. On a Saturday at 2pm they had ""run out"" of candy apple french toast, the pastries (individually priced on the menu 4-5$ each) could only be ordered as a ""full basket"" (for 15$), our food took FOR EVER to arrive and the ""avocado toast"" that came with the big breakfast was the size of a tiny melba toast. We assumed perhaps the place had just opened and the kitchen hadn't got the hang of things... but nope they have been around for a while.Nobody checked on us at any point before or after our food arrived, (I supposed because they'd probably know the answer LOL)Great ambiance - MEH everything else. Lots of better options just a couple of blocks south, east and west",,,
11,Carla C.,"New York, NY",506,108,3,3.0,8/2/2018,"Came here with a friend who lives around the corner! The food is good, but not memorable, giving this spot 3 stars. However, the ambiance is nice and Elmo is a great loungey spot to come for a date or with friends.",,,
12,Pimp D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,297,11,4.0,9/16/2018,"This review is for lunch only.On a rainy day swung into Elmo's for a quick lunch.

Cute decor and good music playing.More like 3.5 stars. Great place for lunch. Will be back.",1,1,1
13,Eddie U.,"Chicago, IL",265,103,124,3.0,7/1/2018,"I came to your place and met a local friend who recommended you for a meal and drinks.  Your establishment is bigger than typical Chelsea restaurants.  We sat inside and the decor was colorful and the crowd young and hip.  The staff was friendly smiling and eye contact.  I had the blood orange tini and a burger with side green salad.  My friends had other drinks and similar sandwich type of meals.  The tab was NYC style:  big! But we had 4 mixed drinks.  Suggestions:  drinks for happy hour, don't expect intimacy since noise inside or outside is super loud (I had to keep asking people to repeat themselves cuz I couldn't hear them), skip the food, and enjoy the male staff with tight tight shorts (if that is your thing).",1,,
14,Luis Adrian B.,"Tobyhanna, PA",0,1,1,5.0,5/24/2018,"Elmo is a great spot to just kickback & relax and enjoy some really awesome food! I'm an entering student at FIT this Fall 2018 & it's just a few blocks down from the school & I go there a lot with my friends & family.The customer service is great, very friendly staff everywhere & everyone has a positive attitude and great look on their face. The food is super delicious & their is so many options all day which I love.  Definitely one of my top spots here in New York!",,,
15,Dee M.,"Manhattan, NY",36,19,2,5.0,6/25/2018,"Always such a friendly place to visit! The food is great, the music is booming (loud but hip/fun), and the ambience is very cheerful. Though the menu has changed since I've last come, the food is still very enjoyable. (Bring back the donut holes please!!!).During my most recent visit:I brought two of my girlfriends here and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. My friend and I both ordered the watermelon salad, which was light and fresh. My second friend initially ordered the salmon, but it was sold out. (No worries! Thankfully the waiter told us immediately after placing our orders). My second friend then opted for a chicken sandwich and fries, of which she really liked. The patrons at the bar, my table of friends, and other seated diners all danced throughout the night (our waiter even joined in on the fun).  Elmo is really a ""feel good"" type of place, with beautiful decor, and great food. I would recommend on coming here.",1,,
16,Vince G.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,0,5.0,11/18/2018,food was delicious was there from out of town for my birthday! with a friend as a server myself and went there twice and recommended by a friend food was good my friend whispered in the server's ear it's his birthday! well I never had such bad service from someone in my life knowing the bill was over a $100. a very snotty attitude ... place is great but your server has to learn how to be a server and not be rude,,,
17,Laura D.,"Flemington, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,8/14/2018,"Food was Good but terrible service. We had a lunch meeting here and the waitress was no where to be found throughout our lunch. After a little while when we left the restaurant my coworker realized she left her water bottle in the restaurant (Stainless steal google water bottle) I personally came back for it and ask our waitress for it, she said she remembered we left it on the table so she went to  check in the kitchen. She came back laughing saying that she didn't remember seeing it ... I was a bit confused because she had just said she remembered it. I was like ok .. so no water bottle ? She replied in a funny matter "" you can talk to the manager but it's just a water bottle""It is definitely just a water bottle but it's the principle of holding items for their customers and being respectful about it. Definitely not coming back here due to the service.",,,
18,Deana B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",342,101,295,4.0,12/15/2017,"This review is for the downstairs room only. I have been here twice now for birthday parties and both times I had such a great time! The passed hors d'oeuvres were great. There was a huge cheese and crackers platter, sliders, guacamole and chips, veggies and dip and a few other delicious things (not sure what exactly they were but I ate them, obviously).The bar offers good service and healthy pours. Three glasses of wine had me feeling really good. It is a small bar though so it does tend to get a little cramped. Also good to note, even though it is referred to as a cash bar, they do take credit cards but have a standard two drink minimum. There are areas to sit down with small tables and there are a few coat racks which come in handy in the winter. In the center there is a small dance floor and an area for a DJ. There are bathrooms downstairs as well so you do not have to go through the entire restaurant to find one. Unfortunately I do not have any pictures of the space without a ton of people of them but it is a great space to host a large party. I would highly recommend for parties of 40+.",1,,1
19,Joanna C.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",2,19,2,1.0,7/20/2018,"The service was horrible during my visit. The server lied to my face about not saving another seat for an additional guest I had coming. I informed the host that I will need a table of 3, but he said since there is only two currently he can only sit me at a table of 2 ( please note there was at least 3 open tables). I told him fine as long as the 3rd person arrives I will be able to move to a bigger table - he said yes. I also informed the waiter that a 3rd person was coming. Once my 3rd person arrived I asked for a bigger table - the waiter said he did not know of a 3rd person coming and that he is just a waiter here and does not sit guests at tables"" I got up and left!",,,
20,Chris W.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",17,28,1,3.0,6/2/2018,"Elmo is teetering between 2 to 4 stars.   The food is ok.  I have never had anything spectacular, nor anything tragic here.  However, no entree has ever been memorable.   I have eaten / drank at Elmo MANY, MANY, MANY times. The outside ambience in the Spring and Summer months always brings me back.   Their Blood and Orange Cosmos are FIERCE!  Very refreshing, especially on a hot summer afternoon.    The outside patio at Elmo is very relaxing and on the weekends is a lot of fun!  However, quite often the inside is like a 1990's rave.  You literally can not hear the people sitting directly at your table, and when you finally walk outside,  and get some fresh air,  you feel like you just did a hit of ecstasy.   ""I wanna be your lover"" will resonate in the upper-cortex of your brain's cerebrum for a day or so.  Ugh. The staff is hit or miss.  Some are so sweet and provide EXCELLENT service.     Others - not so much.   Just because you have a great rack or bulging biceps does not provide you the right to throw attitude, especially when I am tossing out $20 for a martini.   Long story short, I do recommend Elmo for Sunday, OUTSIDE, brunch, and a cocktail after a long and grueling, Summer Friday.  I do NOT recommend this place for an indoors ""let's catch up"" place, unless you speak sign-language.  All in all, not bad though.",,1,
21,Digao 1.,"Watchung, NJ",0,8,3,5.0,1/29/2018,"My favorite spot in New York City! Elmo has great ambiance, delicious food and beautiful people any day of the week.I have been going to Elmo since 2004 and the place stays trendy and hot after all these years.Two thumbs up!!!",,,
22,Summer L.,"Queens, NY",68,78,432,4.0,2/27/2017,"My partner and I decided to check out this place over the weekend when we wanted to try someplace new. The ambiance was inviting and warm, and the service was prompt and on top of things. I drink a lot of water, so I'll always love a good restaurant that keeps refilling my glass! Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful.We started off with the popcorn shrimp, which came with a mustard tartar sauce and a bloody mary cocktail sauce. The appetizer was delicious, but didn't come with a lot of shrimp. I ordered the meatloaf. The dish was seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes it came with were creamy and complimented the main part of the dish perfectly. My partner got the fried chicken, which was incredibly flavorful and yummy as well. We completely finished our plates, but in the future we plan to go back and get drinks or dessert afterward. Our timing was just right because the place got PACKED as we were leaving. I recommend coming here for an early dinner if possible!",2,,
23,Ian M.,"Manhattan, NY",287,38,1,3.0,10/23/2017,Decent spot in Chelsea. The food is fine but the service definitely leaves something to be desired. Great margaritas are their saving grace. One other plus is that you can always get a table because it's rarely packed.,,,
24,Becky B.,"New York, NY",0,7,4,4.0,9/6/2018,"Food and drinks were delicious! Water cups had food particles on it and the waiter was not friendly, only reason for the one lost star! I will be back regardless.",,,
25,Wendrich J. M.,"New York, NY",77,162,518,5.0,2/10/2017,"This place is a gem. The first thing that attracted me was the menu choices displayed outside, everything was very well selected and the combinations of food sounded amazing. I didn't regret going in. As soon as I entered the vibe already felt great, the decor was a mix of glam, punk, romance and bohemian styles. The lights were low, the music was good, the big pieces of paintings and the lamps created like an art gallery just for me, as I said when I checked in it felt like this place is perfect for Valentine's Day. (Lovers take notes)I wasn't that hungry, but decided to try a bunch of appetizers. Everything came together and it was so tasty, I had the best meatballs ever. Even though this place falls under ""American Cuisine"" I think they have a special Italian touch to die for.Even the package to get your leftovers to go are really well designed and their branding is so on point. Loved the logo, the colors and typefaces they picked. (This sounds more like a graphic design critique, can't help it I'm a designer...)I will just show you the pictures and you will enjoy. Highly recommended. Great staff, super clean bathrooms downstairs where there is also a really nice lounge with sofas and pillows.",2,,
26,Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",130,518,505,4.0,3/31/2018,Came here for brunch and started with the guacamole and chips to share. Great guac and the chips are slightly thicker ones that still have a great crunch. I went with the baked eggs which had a good taste but it was just a bit too watery. I also wasn't a huge fan off the large chunks of tomatoes - think it could have been better if the texture was a bit more consistent.,,,
27,Rianna R.,"Manhattan, NY",32,72,95,4.0,9/16/2017,"A great spot in Chelsea with great drinks and food for a pretty reasonable price. The decor inside is cool and modern, and there's outdoor seating when the weather's nice. I recommend the Elmo Bites appetizer, where you can choose three different starters to share. All of their cocktails are beautiful and delicious, but go for the watermelon martini!",,,
28,Patti P.,"Sayreville, NJ",18,12,41,4.0,10/16/2017,Elmo Restaurant was simply amazing.  It was trendy yet casual and unpretentious.  The food was delicious and our waiter Ian was great.  He was very attentive and checked in on us regularly.The food was simple yet delicious.

29,Akeem N.,"Manhattan, NY",97,3,0,1.0,12/18/2017,"Disappointed with Elmo and its service. One of my friends has his bday dinner here every year and this year was trainwreck. We arrive for a 8:30 reservations and were not seated until 8:50. The hosts were disrespectful, dismissive and unapologetic about the delay. To add salt to the wound, our table was near the front and we could hear one of the host gossiping about our table with our waiter.The waiter was curt and seemed uninterested in serving us. We were overly nice and he was not receptive.If your staff cannot handle people being upset over of a 20 mins delay, they need coaching; it was my friend's bday and I called the restaurant to check if there would be any delays.Also, the food was terrible...we have been there before and it has not been so bad, but I am sure that the perry staff played a part.",1,2,1
30,D S.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,1.0,6/28/2018,"I've suffered through several meals here due to a noise level which detracts from the food (which is fine) and prevents any communication other than eye contact or texting across the table.  If you can't hear the waiter and they can't hear you, mistakes are bound to happen, and they do.The drinks are always expensive but never so much as on Gay Pride this year when the bar was apparently out of alcohol and served drinks devoid of spirits, yet still charged as if everything was top shelf.  Such mean-spirited cynicism in treating customers that way on a day which is certainly their most profitable means NEVER AGAIN.",,1,
31,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,5/24/2017,"Great place to grab a drink or a bite, especially now that summer is here. Last Friday after work was one of those times where you felt like you wanted to be outside but also wished it was like 3 degrees warmer. Elmo's quasi-outdoor seats on the street provided me the perfect balance of what I was looking for.They have a solid cocktail list and decently-priced wines by the glass. They wouldn't let me sit just for a drink so I agreed to have a little snack. I went with the tuna tartare which is one of my classic go-tos.I must say, it had one of the most lop-sided tuna-to-avocado ratios I've ever experienced...heavy on the avocado, light on the tuna. At first, I felt like I was getting ripped off, but then I took a bite. It comes bathed in this sweet chili sauce that is unlike pretty much any other tuna tartare I've ever had. I'm not saying it's the only way the dish should ever be prepared, but it is a style I'd highly recommend trying, here or somewhere else. The crispy wonton chips are perfect for dipping and assembling perfect little bites.",1,1,2
32,Nikki M.,"Edison, NJ",98,26,42,4.0,4/16/2018,"Great atmosphere, reasonably priced and the food was great!  I had the Lobster Mac & Cheese and the Mahi Mahi Tacos.. very tasty. My friend had the Lasagna and that was really good!",,,

36,Rob K.,"San Diego, CA",166,427,32,3.0,6/3/2018,"There are so many better places to eat in New York, but Elmo has a few fun things going for it.  It's a very GAY place to eat, lots of eye candy including the waiters, and great cocktails served here.  Unfortunately, I can't give it 4 stars because the food just isn't up to par for that kind of rating.  My bar is pretty high for New York as it should be.. But if you're in the mood for a menu with a LOT of variety, and some good bar quality food this is the place to go.  My favorite item we had were the truffle fries, definitely 4 stars on those guys, my spinach side salad was 3.5 stars, my entree not so much, I don't even remember what I ordered at this point that's how forgettable it was. :)",,,

I received my chicken sandwich. He never came back to check on me. I sat with an empty glass of water and ice tea for the duration of my lunch. After he finally cam back up he chatted with two new goes at the bar. After I told him that I ""needed salt and pepper, refills on my beverage, and it would have been nice if he actually would have asked me ""how everything was"" his response was, ""Tell me how you really feel"" Completely unbelievable. Was the first time in my entire life I have ever stiffed someone in the service industry.  At the bottom of the receipt I wrote, ""you're ridiculous""I wouldn't step foot in the place, even for a free meal. The worst.",4,,
40,jaime s.,"Marlboro, NJ",185,22,6,1.0,12/3/2017,"Really disappointed with this restaurant & will never be back. I made a reservation for a party of 8 for dinner on Open Table a few days in advance. The day of our reservation, the restaurant called to confirm. However, upon arrival, the table the hostess sat us in was really for a party of 5 max and was so awkwardly shaped in a corner booth that my friend who is less than 100 pounds and shorter than 5 feet had difficulty getting in. After numerous conversations with the wait staff, the hostess and manager - they finally moved us to another table, although the action was perceived as them doing us a favor versus trying to make us comfortable. Our party ordered the steak sandwich, chicken sandwich, tuna burger, and Caesar salad. The food was good, but the waiter did not mention that we would be hit with a $36 ""upgrade"" fee from regular fries to truffle fries. We could have ordered truffle fries for the table for less money, and we had wished our waiter mentioned that to us.",,,

I ordered the classic club with grilled chicken and couldn't even finished my meal. The prices were also very reasonable. Service was good as well.

Everything tasted great, the portions were perfect, and that watermelon martini was the best martini I've ever had.I'm saving my complaints for the service. We were a party of 6 for lunch, arrived at 12:30 to a mostly empty restaurant. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to remember we were there, and this was with us actively flagging her down. She would not make eye contact for some reason. Finally orders were taken. It took almost 30 minutes to arrive. From the time I arrived, I'm watching the tables of 2s and 3s and 4s around us get seated, food ordered and served, and LEFT and we still haven't gotten our food. Once again, we flagged down the waitress.Time for the check. Where the heck is she hiding now??? One of us had to get up and chase after the waitress to get that check! I will not be coming back.

43,Esther F.,"Pennington, NJ",85,8,0,5.0,2/27/2018,I was skeptical when my friend asked me to go with her to Elmo's - how could a place with a sesame street name be good? But boy was I in for a surprise!The salmon plate I got was exceptional - one of the best meals of my life. They were great at accommodating food allergies. The drinks were delicious  (and strong). We all went home stuffed and happy - and didn't break the piggy bank (totally reasonable for NYC prices)! I highly recommend this place to my friends and now to all of you on yelp!,1,,

46,Devin W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",186,229,4,4.0,2/15/2017,"We came here after the shows ended during NYFW. The food was good, the alcohol was well priced, and the staff was friendly. Clean restrooms (you have no idea what a god send that is sometimes!). They close at 12 a.m., I didn't know that so if you plan a trip here make sure you look at the hours of operation. We left around 11:45 and headed to the pub next door that was still open, and a lot divier (kind of the vibe we were going for anyway!). I would definitely come here again.",,1,
47,Jul G.,"Lansdale, PA",6,21,3,5.0,3/29/2018,Stopped in here for lunch with my mom today after my fitting at Kleinfeld. Such a cute place!! The food was amazing. I had the mahi mahi tacos and my mom had the salmon BLT. So filling and delicious! Service was impeccable and the staff was so friendly. Will definitely recommend to anyone!,,,
48,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,3.0,1/1/2017,"Elmo could be best described as a trendy, new American restaurant and bar, and it was A-OK.My friend and I came here for her birthday brunch, and started out with a mimosa and a spicy bloody Mary, respectively, both of which we enjoyed. We then continued with shares of the truffle and Parmesan fries and the lobster mac and cheese. The fries, albeit a bit oily, were nonetheless hot and tasty, and the lobster mac and cheese was decent. The service was also fast and friendly, and we were able to get in and out as needed.All in all, Elmo isn't a bad option for the area.",1,,
49,T G.,"Hoboken, NJ",15,150,203,4.0,2/9/2017,"Had a work/customer lunch here last week- made a reservation online and asked them to give me a great table, off to the side so we could have a work conversation. They listened to my request and I was so thankful! Food was wonderful ,Cobb salad was large and filling! I can't wait to come back to try a few other things- like the truffle fries!! My client got the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries and loved it! Thank you for the excellent service and wonderful food.Only complaint is the lack of signage where the bathrooms are- you need to go downstairs and make a right and then go all the way down the hall.. a bit confusing for the other folks I was with. Otherwise I will be back!!! Thank you again!",,,

Ian really made our experience that much better, and impressed us so much because he has only been working at Elmo for 2 weeks. We frequent this place often, and the food was better than ever before. We know one thing for sure, whenever we are going to eat a Elmos, it will be a fantastic time!!Thank you so much to Ian and we will be back soon!!",,,

52,David R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,47,2,3.0,9/12/2017,"I've been here twice and the food is very good, the menu has a wide variety and all the dishes are done well. Really enjoyed the tuna tartare and the chicken fried chicken. Service was perfect, waitress was very attentive and very nice. Had an issue last time with the host, we have a newborn and requested to sit outside, we even called earlier in the day and asked for a table outside. I'm pretty sure he lied to me multiple times and I had to push him to get a table near the window. Solid food, staff is great overall, don't let one bad egg ruin it for you but beware outdoor seating may be an issue",,,
53,Galit T.,"New York, NY",45,166,4,5.0,11/1/2016,"Everything about this place is perfection.We came (4 of us) on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty full but not annoyingly so. We were seated right away. Everyone on the staff was incredibly friendly and seemed to go out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and taken care of.We got the cobb salad, grilled cheese, veggie burger, and nova eggs. Everything was exceptionally delicious. I had the veggie burger and asked for no bun and when it came out it had avocado on top--which is really nice since avocado usually costs extra and the fact that I'm pretty sure there are no avocados left in the world due to the recent shortage.The stand out though? The truffle fries. I don't know what kind of spell they put on these things to make them so good, but if you don't get them, you've really missed out on an amazing french fry experience. Perfectly seasoned and sprinkled with cheese. Crispy yet not too crispy. Also comes with an amazing dip. Get these.Looking forward to returning again soon!",1,,1

I mean, it's named Elmo right? :) Anyhoo....Let's talk about the onion rings.  Crispy, big, wonderfully round onion rings. Some of the best I've had in a long while and makes you long for the days when this was the norm instead of the processed ones that seem to pass for onion rings now a days.Then there were the mahi fish tacos. Very generously portioned with different preparation for each. Yum! The meatball parm sandwich was very good too though a bit messy. You worried about losing a meatball with every bite! Service was friendly, efficient and the seating was typical New York. A bit squashed together but it works.Overall, a hit.",,,1
57,Wolfee W.,"Edgewater, NJ",23,24,0,4.0,8/16/2017,"OMG the drinks at this place is amazing. The food is delicious. The waiters are a hit or miss, sometimes you get the female server you disappears for like your entire meal only to get the check at the end. Or you get the Gorgeous guy with the hot ass who knows how to please his customers and get those drinks to the table!Depending on the night, its better to sit in the back always. Near the bar is were the Guys hang out trying to pick up other hotties. Loudly.But all in all this place is a certified GRADE A in my book. Always looking to come back to this place on a Friday to unwind with some great friends.",,,

We liked the outdoor seating. Here's the dinner details (Tue 08/09/2016):Rose, glass, 9Apermosa (cocktail), 12: This is an Aperol Spritz. It was smaller and more expensive than most for this drink.

59,Michael M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/16/2017,"My husband and I live across the street and eat at Elmo's at least once a week during the summer but avoid it during the winter because we can't sit outside and it's way to noisy inside.  Last night we tried sitting at the bar up near the front door but that was a bust, the bartender had zero interest in taking our order or checking on our food after we waited 30minutes and he was no where to be found when we finally decided to walk out to have a slice at Rocco's pizza next door.  The food is good but the service is laced with gay (I'm fabulous) attitude which I'll never understand and I do have a fabulous life .",,2,
60,Jenny L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",327,110,126,4.0,9/2/2017,Beautiful evening for outdoor seating. My friend and I shared the meatloaf and salad with steak.

61,Steph G.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",282,87,22,4.0,5/23/2017,"Came for lunch on Friday. The service was slow for daytime, but they were pretty busy. The salads are huge. I split the chopped salad and tuna tartar. They have these homemade wonton chips that come with the tartar (there's def not enough for all the avo and tuna it comes with but they were nice to bring us a full plate of more chips after asking). My other friend got the kale salad with some sort of mango dressing which she said was amazing. Great vibes",,,
62,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,589,852,4.0,11/19/2015,"If you were to ask the me quintessential gayborhood of Chelsea restaurant Elmo would easily come to mind. The cavernous space filled with gay boys to the brim, music pumping like David Barton's gym and the servers must audition for their role. The cocktails are always a good start. What is not quintessential is the food. It is clearly comfort food here. The crispy calamari is fantastic with a slight heat from the fried jalapeño pepper. Ribs and meatloaf and juicy burgers with fries or crunchy onion rings if desired are all on the menu. I guess even the gym bunny, rat needs a splurge once in awhile from the protein shake and bland boiled chicken with steamed broccoli.",,,
63,Nicole S.,"Bellmore, NY",38,41,14,5.0,12/30/2017,OH MY GOD. THIS PLACE IS SOOOO GOOD. I had the steak sandwich which was out of this world with a side of truffle fries (they were 6$ extra but still good). We had calamari as an app which is easy to mess up but it was cooked perfectly. Everyone else at the table was very happy with their meals as well. Would Recommend and would come back!,,,
64,Darrick C.,"Atlanta, GA",274,13,0,1.0,10/28/2017,"Food was delicious until I found a hair in it. Brought it to the waiters attention, he took the plate and walked away....said NOTHING. Came back over 5 mins later and asked what color the hair was. Really? Who cares. It wasn't mine! After all that, he finally asks if I want something else. Good food, AWFUL service. 1 star rating.",,1,

My friend ordered the huevos rancheros and I got the waffles with bananas. Our food arrived very quickly. She said the huevos rancheros were great. The waffles were delicious, but definitely on the sweet side. The texture was great though, nice and crispy. The bananas were sliced nice and thin and there was a good amount. I also liked that they had a range of brunch drinks, not just the normal mimosa/bloody mary, and they were only $7.",,,
67,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",289,742,387,2.0,2/21/2016,"$53 for lunch for 2 for with no alcohol and it definitely was not worth it.  The food was OK but what really galled me was that I never saw the waiter except when he took our order and delivered the check.  My Cobb Salad either had very little dressing or none at all and since I couldn't find him and he never came back to check on us, I, in a manner of speaking, bit the bullet.  Probably would have been a 3 star experience if our server cared.    We really wanted to go to Cafeteria but there was a 45 minute wait at 1:45PM on a weekday.  We wound up here.  A nice looking place but horrible service and overpriced mediocre food not fun.  They also need to figure out what to do about the front door.  A blast of cold air came in every time the door opened despite both a breezeway outer door and a heavy curtain.",6,,1

70,Jay A.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,594,22,3.0,2/11/2016,"3 of us had lunch at Elmo today.  I ate here before about 11 years ago, probably visited this establishment a couple of times in 2003/2004 when they had just opened.  Regardless we were in the area and needed a good lunch at 1130 AM.  Everyone opens up at 12 Noon; however, Elmo was open and ready for our business at 1140 AM.The décor is as I recall, cute and clubby.  However, today the heat was broken and the joint was really cold.  This was the wrong day not to have heat as the temperature was in the teens.  The waiters were mediocre, nothing to write home about.I was a tad sick and hot tomato soup with grilled cheese afloat sounded great.  It turned out to be a good (not great) bowl of soup.  Not sure if I would order this item again.For my main course I chose the cobb salad.  It was a good sized cobb salad with tons of fresh chicken, avocado and bacon.  For some reason it had no dressing?  I was not feeling great so I chose to say nothing,.  However, there should have been some dressing provided?The service was lousy as if nobody cared.  Not sure if I will return.  If I do return it will be for drinks at night, not food.",3,1,
71,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,2/1/2016,"Went here with a group of friends to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was pretty crowded, but we were able to grab a table right away. If you haven't been here, it's a little bit of a scene, which is fun--so a lot of people dress to impress.To start off the night, our table split an order of the macaroni and cheese and guacamole. The macaroni was good--when you had a bite with cheese--but for some reason there were a lot of noodles that did not have any cheese on them. The guacamole was also good, but I felt that the portion size was pretty small, especially considering the amount of chips it came with.For my main meal, I went with the salmon. The salmon was cooked absolutely perfectly, with tasty flaky skin underneath. The fish also had a nice flavor to it as it was marinated and cooked in some sort of ginger and soy sauce. The quinoa and veggies that came with it were also very good and paired well with the fish.I also enjoyed my fireside margarita, which wasn't really spicy like I was hoping, but had a great beet flavor to it that was unlike anything I've ever had before.Overall, this place has a great ambiance and nice vibe. The service is friendly, but can be a bit hard to find at times. The food is good and the pricing is decent, especially considering the area. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area.",4,1,1

75,Evian D.,"New York, NY",410,239,432,4.0,1/27/2016,"Elmo is one of the lose staple restaurants for all people of the community. It's not that it's catered to the gays, but it seems their is always a lot of us here cause the food is amazing and the restaurant itself is actually pretty nice to be in. While this blizzard storm Jonas was visiting NYC, we were looking for a good spot to enjoy the snow show and get some food. It seemed like most favorite brunch spots were closing  due to the blizzard as some of the trains would be out of service and we had a no vehicles on street rule during the storm. Well, Elmo saved the day! While waiting for our friends to join, my partner and I enjoyed drinks form the bar and even made up a new one which included their virgin berry lemonade with ruby red vodka. Loved this drink.we also ordered the house champagne.... But did not enjoy that at all so left it at the table. Once at the table, I ordered the breakfast burrito and they were pretty amazing. My partner ordered a off menu item , tomato soup that came with a mini grilled cheese which really made me want to have ordered as the cold day merited it! He also ordered a salad cause well, he is the healthier one.My meal was pretty amazing, having the scrambled eggs and steak or maybe it was chorizo with a side of guacamole and spicy salsa (which I gave away cause I hate spicy stuff). This plate is really filling and it was delicious. I tend to try to be healthy so I only ate about 1.5 of the tortillas ... But man I scraped the insides from the other 1.5. Hahaha, it was delicious and I was hungry apparently! Our waiter was actually trying to be nice, but I felt like he was annoyed or not having a good day. I could see he probably did not want to be working. That said, we have had better service, or maybe the snarky snappy attitude was just starting to rub off on him after serving so many Chelsea Queens! That said, again, not the usual service we get when here, most are usually pretty nice and always happy to serve. Might just have been the horrid snow day and having to work, that said, thank you for serving us on such a day and trying your hardest to pull through! Elmo is not the first date type place. Chances are both have already been here before, this is a local favorite for brunches and dinners in the area. So maybe this is more of a third date type spot, no need to bring the nervousness in here, just enjoy your meal and cocktails.My one reason for not giving 5 stars, is that many of us agree that the drinks are a bit to $$ and well maybe so is the food. I guess it's ok, but def agree on the drinks.",2,1,
76,Katherine L.,"Columbia, SC",82,10,4,5.0,9/13/2017,"Found this restaurant on YELP as it was located near a comedy club that we were going to one night.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, excellent service!!

77,Brian P.,"Astoria, New York, NY",0,11,0,3.0,3/20/2017,"Pretty ""meh"" all around. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means, but there's nothing exceptional about the food I had here. It does have a cool ""club-ey"" feel to it, though. And, no complaints to be had about the service.I started with the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer. They were fine, just really typical, oven-roasted Brussels sprouts. They were a little soggy, I usually like my Brussels sprouts to be fresher, with less oil and still firm. For an entree, I had the short rib. Again, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptionally delicious. The food just seemed to lack any unique flavor. The cocktail program could also stand to have some new life breathed into it. I had the spicy pear margarita and the apple sidecar. Both were, again, just ""meh"".Overall, it's not a bad place, really. It's got a nice vibe, but I wouldn't spend my money on dinner here. It seems to have a pretty active bar, so any return trips I'd make would just be for that. The food just needs to have some new flavors brought into it. I could get a similar meal at a diner for half the price. In a market like NYC, restaurants really have to stand out, and I guess I just don't get what makes this place unique or special?",,,

I only had two starters but as I looked around I could tell that they give you A TON of food.  All of their entrees came out with big full plates!  Definitely worth it!",1,,

We started with the lobster mac and cheese, the lobster mac and cheese, and the truffle fries. The Mac and cheese was a little on the runnier side but delicious none the less! The fries were stringy and tasty too. For my entree, I settled on the chicken fried chicken. They kept the gravy and hot sauce on the side which I appreciated. They did a really good job on this home style meal. Very filling, and very good. The menu had such crowd pleasers, it was hard to decide on one item. Hubby had the steak frites and enjoyed that as well. Overall very nice ambiance without being obnoxious, and we were able to engage in great conversation. Thanks Elmo!",1,,1

Salad was not bad. I liked the added charred corn pieces to it. Also had fries to share. Even though it was the 2 of us , it was a lot of fries so I ended up taking the rest home. The waitress was nice and understanding of our limited time. We sat outdoors since the weather was nice. In my opinion nothing spectacular but good spot for a quick meal.

83,Mark M.,"Roslyn, NY",37,93,155,3.0,9/13/2015,"Elmo did not live up to our expectations.  To start, the service was a little spotty. Upon arriving we had to wait 10 minutes for a round of 2 drinks, and the place was empty....really it was early and there were less than 20 people seated and about 5 at the bar. We did get an apology with an explanation that there was a backup at the bar...really?...honesty from the server that she dropped the ball in some manner would have been the right thing to do.  I really got the sense it was not important and that they are used to delivering this kind of service. I cannot imagine what it would be like when it is packed. Enough of my rant. Our drinks (when they came) were actually the highlight of the meal.  I had the Spicy Mango margarita and my wife the White Peach Sangria.  Both were 5 star for taste and unique flavor. Our meals were generally good but not impressive.   I had the meatloaf and enjoyed it but it was not special.  For the balance of the evening the staff was attentive, but did not make up for rocky start and weak excuse.",3,1,

That said the food is just about middle of the road. Not terrible but not mind blowing either. The lobster mac and cheese is always a highlight, as is the lobster roll. In both cases they don't skimp on the amount of lobster nor the flavor. This may come off as kind of creepy, but the waiters here are so gorgeous!

After I got my dessert our waiter disappeared. I'm okay with them being hungry & take a quick break but if you have customers, it doesn't look presentable for all these waiters to be munching away while guests are waiting.  They were not on a breaker.",2,,

All staff looks absolutely amazing. Very nice atmosphere inside and large space to seat. Unfortunately we didn't have chance to taste a food because had lunch already however cocktails were delicious. One of our friend couldn't except alcohol so they got for her nice Virgin Mojito. Definitely nice place!,,,

It is typical for what you would find in the area: trendy, young, artsy, fun music, lively crowd. The space was used very well.My ginger rum cocktail was fabulous. It could have been poured a little heavier but it was nice to taste the different notes of mint and ginger in the drink.I ordered the soyaki salmon and highly recommend it. It was seasoned just right according to the name. It came over a bed of quinoa and broccoli which still has my mouth watering just thinking about it. This place would be great for a date, group of friends, and/or any dinner/drinks celebration. I will definitely go back!",2,,

Don't know.  Elmo is not your Jim Henson kid friendly Sesame Street Elmo as it is neither the 1980's hit movie St. Elmo's Fire, but a bar + restaurant.  Our drinks at one each equates to-- overpriced and expensive.For Him:1 Long Island Ice TeaFor Her:1 CosmopolitanAfter a long enduring work week with my baby boy, we chilled to the bar scene directly in front of the DJ as we imbibe.  The table was not in a dilapidated state for wobbliness.  The quality of our drinks were well prepared.  No comment on the food as we did not consume any.  No comment on the facilities as we did not utilize.  There are no hooks under the table for jackets or bags.",1,,

It seems that this place is one of the few places that does not have A Chelsea attitude associated with it. The service was very friendly and our waiter recommended all sorts of yummy food items and, more importantly, beverages. I settled on the calimari, which was perfectly fried but the marinara was a little watered down. I kind of wished that they had a grilled calimari option but oh well. I had the gin gilmit, which is on the drink menu (one out of about 14-16) and it was made wonderfully. Everyone at the table were pretty pleased with their menu selections.

The fries are AMAZING. All of our meals were good, but nothing was overly interesting. Standard, bar lunch food. BLT. Grilled Cheesed. Chicken Club. None of us tried a salad but they did look tasty.

In efforts to not cause a scene, I calmly bring this to the attention of the manager Julia who says to me ""This is not acceptable I will take something off your bill for this."" She then takes the glass out of my hand without asking and runs away with it.  I thought, ok she's handling it -all good. 1 HOUR goes by and she fails to come over to me and give me ANY update.  I have to leave the table of 13 girls and go up to her and I said ""you realize 1 hour has gone by and you have not given me any form of an update or even checked in with me?"" At this point she was holding a tray of shots and a piece of cake that we didn't ask for - i said that shots and 1 piece of cake were not going to compensate for the fact that I almost swallowed glass.  More has to be done- like covering all the drinks."" Her response-""Well it is going to be a $1000 bill, that's a lot."" Really, who responds like that? Still in shock at her response, I told her to call the owner.  She calls and the owner says he can take off $150 for about a $1000 bill.  I couldn't believe that was really all they were going to do, so I refuse that offer and said I was HAPPY to talk to the owner myself about the repercussions of not handling this properly. Julia said she would call back and was able to get all the drinks taken off the bill.  Overall, TERRIBLE customer service, Julia took my calmness and me not causing a scene for lack of seriousness. I am never coming back here and I am making sure none of my friends come here, and you shouldn't either unless you want to risk swallowing glass and having a terrible experience.",1,,

Music selection is very very cool. I have read lots of bad reviews about service. The only thing I have to say is that service is a lil slow but everyone is very friendly nice and cute. A lil noisy so probably not the perfect place for a date (expecially if it's the first one) but perfect to hang out with friends and having good food",,,

Give them a try if just for a relaxed drink(s) with apps or a good solid meal experience. I am a fan!The Deets:NYC is filled with places to get a drink or a meal, especially in Chelsea area. In the search for eats and drinks, I have found myself at Elmo a couple of times. Inside the place that is just labeled ""RESTAURANT"" with a very colorful background lies a pretty cool place to grab grub and a cocktail.Once inside Elmo, you'll find a very cool hip venue. Very fashionable light fixtures, interesting photos and art on the walls, and comfy booths/tables to grab your eats. There is also a pretty nice long bar to relax at, and a good outside patio area as well when weather permits. You can dress up a little bit or come casual, it will do for either mood. Cocktail wise they have a pretty great list to choose from, and from this list I've tried the Apermosa, Blood Orange Cosmo, Midnight Whiskey Sour, and the classic Frozen Margarita. The drinks are good, I like their margarita a lot, and the menu is diverse enough to fit any taste (sweet, bitter, potent, etc.). In the eats department, I'd say they do pretty well also. Their guac is pretty solid, I've had that each time without disappointment. Entrées I have tried include the classic meatloaf and the chicken fried chicken. Both were very good and satisfying, but I lean towards the meatloaf for a bit of comfort food. There were EXCELLENT mashed potatoes with the chicken, awesome flavor. Service wise, no huge complaints or hiccups, and in fact the bartender when having the first meal/drinks at the bar was two thumbs up, thanks Adam!",5,2,5

Granted, we went there around the 20th of December. I personally loved it. It's a nice change from the overcrowded and bustling places in Manhattan. Another thing that really threw me off guard were the incredible large portions! Starter: we had the truffle fries and it is meant for sharing but I don't think 2 people should be sharing it. It could have fed 5 people easily. It was like never ending. It was deliciously earthy and very decedent. If you get this, order lighter meal (which we didn't)Dinner: I had the burger (which had even more fries). It was fine, nothing too out of the ordinary. It was well cooked though so that's great. My boyfriend had the meatloaf which was great as well. It was laid over a bed of greens and mashed potatoes. It tasted very classical and it wasn't the most unique meatloaf but it had a great moist texture but not too mushy. Overall experience was great. Our servers were not rude at all and fairly attentive. I actually loved that because I feel like most servers are too attentive. I would like to go back again.",,,

The bread had a nice little crust on the outside but was soft and slightly chewy inside. Even the salad tasted extremely fresh.My fiancé ordered the Breakfast Burrito. I really like the marriage of flavors in the burrito, it had a slight jalapeno kick and some cilantro.Their drinks are very pretty and yummy too. The Pear Bellini and Caramel Margarita were fabulous!I would have given 4.5 stars if I could.

The food menu has a good variety and everything we had was good - we had the chips + guac and the calamari to start (both were enjoyable) and then we had the mac and cheese, steak skewers, and chicken club (all very delightful).

I should have known.   A martini is a special drink, especially when you go to a place and will pay whatever,  serve it right with a bit of caring!  Move from function to purpose.  Here is the stupid story of how that first moment of a restaurant experience can take you down the wrong road. One bartender fixed the situation and apologized, he was nice but the other bartender who origionallly interacted me like i was vermin enhanced his pissed off vibe because i mentioned it to the host, then he decided to evicerate me.  He was so obnoxious  i had to write this.  The bartender and his posse gave me the finger through the window when i was  talking with the Manager who was really great.   Sorry , I find there is nothing more wonderful then kindness.  HE TOLD ME TO LEAVE, PULLED BACK MY DRINK AND SAID TO ME TO LEAVE BECAUSE I WAS GRUMPY. By the way,  that why i wanted to treat myself to a good Martini, because i was grumpy, and the attitude and the combination of any compassion, set me off.  That shows you even with my overraction of a hot glass, my radar was not off.   The olive in the Martini that never was happened when the owner came out and walked away.  That said the whole story.  This place has nothing to do with caring.  It's the Chelsea Scene, go, drink eat and have minimal expectations.     What ever happened to service recovery ""Buddy,  Your stressed,  come on back in,  lets make this right!     If your under 50 and really cute and just want to get wasted go here.  If you are over 50 and have a basic expectation of a  bit of hospitality and caring after a long day...pour yourself a drink at home.  Stay away.",1,1,

That would be my only warning about this place but it's not unlike many in New York City. Too loud!

The hostess was no host, and it was impossible to get a waiter to take our order, take simple request for drinks or even an extra napkin. Then impossible to get the bill and when she brought it back our credit cards were missing in her pocket!! The food was great! Hence the 2 stars.

When we arrived we were seated immediately. The place was not crowded, but our waiter mentioned that it would pick up around 8/9pm. As we ate, we enjoyed the sounds of of 90s pop and today's hits. It definitely took me down memory lane when they played NSYNC. We started with the Mac n Cheese which was good and very cheesy. I'd give it 3.7/5 stars. Then we both ordered the salmon meal. Now I love salmon, have tried more than my fair share, and must say this was the bomb.com! I would definitely order this again. It came over a bed on Quinoa and vegetables. We finished the night with dessert - pecan pie and a chocolate brownie, both with ice cream. Both were dry and not worth the money. If you're in the area I recommend you give this place a try because the main courses were very good and the ambiance was great.",,,

My calamari was damn there rubber that i had to chew 1 piece for almost a minute. The wings sauce was nice but again over fried! My wings were so dry and hard it was very tough to chew. So i only gave 3 stars because the food is the main part if the experience right?! Makes me think if they were from the night before and just refried.. *Wonders*Anywho,The wait staff seemed nice, some were a bit too snooty but none rude.

157,Kristi L.,"New York, NY",224,205,227,3.0,5/15/2015,"Classic American fare with a trendy hip atmosphere. My boyfriend took me here after a long workout, which I wish I didn't because I literally was able to eat everything that came to our table. We shared the Elmo Bites ($20) for a choice of three appetizers-we chose guacamole and chips, calamari, and waffle sweet potato fries. I'm a huge huge fan of guacamole and spout the benefits of avocados to all the non-believers out there, but the guac was very disappointing and sorely needed salt and some sort of seasoning! I was pleasantly surprised by the waffle fries; they were perfectly crisp and very yummy. But for $20..didn't really think it was anything too special, but once again I devoured it because I was so hungry. Entrees we ordered were the Eggplant Neopolitan and the Chicken Paillard. The chicken was soft and juicy and the flavors for both dishes were on point! The portion of food given was also the perfect amount. I would definitely recommend the Chicken Paillard for healthy eaters, since it's basically grilled chicken on a bed of salad.Drinks here are great AND strong. I personally loved the white peach sangria, but can't wait to try some other ones. Service was fast and attentive, thanks to Joey. Overall, I had a great dining experience at Elmo, but once again nothing stood out too much here. It's a safe option for a moderately priced restaurant with well cooked dishes, and a great place to take coworkers, friends, or a date; but if you're looking for something more unique, Elmo is not the one. Wouldn't be jumping at the opportunity to eat here again, but if I did find myself at Elmo again, I definitely wouldn't mind it :) PS: bathrooms are located downstairs near the bar.",,,

I enjoyed my classic club sandwich with fried chicken, which came with crisp hand-cut fries. At $11, I thought it was a great value for Manhattan. Our server was quick and attentive and we never went too long without water. I was also a fan of the swanky yet unpretentious decor. Being from D.C.

Eggplant had a wonderful pesto ricotta and balsamic reduction on it. Yum! Give this place a try. They seemed to have really fun cocktails too - although we just got red wine.

Cafeteria was packed as always so we skipped down to Elmo.  Service was great! Our waiter was attentive and so damn chipper I was wondering if she had a drink of a few shots of coffee before her shift! The Vibe was relaxed and ""happy"" as my bro called it. Definitely lots of eye candy (little bro was happy people watching) and everyone is just do darn happy and friendly (must be all the Bellinis and screwdrivers lol). And there wasn't as much of that 'snootiness' you get at other places like Cafeteria. The Parmesan truffle fries were AMAZING! They give you alot more fries then some other places, and the fries are skinnier. And they do not skimp on the truffle oil or the Parmesan. My omelette was perfectly cooked and super filling. I ordered mine with spinach and goat cheese. The spinach was cooked/mixed in with the omelette and the goat cheese with one huge spoonful stuffed in the omelette. The homefries were more like rosemary baked mini potatoes (yummy). The salad and toast were so-so...just some mixed greens and a piece of bread. But overall it was a good meal,My bro got the classic benedict. Eggs were cooked perfectly and holladaise sauce was delicious (he was practically licking that plate clean). My friend got the french toast, OMG YUM! Comes with cooked chunks of cinnimon apples, there are 4 think slices of french toast, with raisins and nuts inside. I am DEF ordering that next time.

Im always hesitant to eat Italian food with my Italian, but he absolutely loved the meatball appetizers. I had the Country Fried Chicken which was light, crispy and delicious, while the Italian had the Sliders, which all had very unique and distinct flavors, but a consistently good taste. To top if off, for dessert we had a small and warm mini pecan pie...and all of this for a very decent price!As if our dinner could get any better, our waiter, Robb Sherman took it to the next level. Robb is a really nice and handsome guy who took a few minutes out of his busy night to sit and chat with us about his travels, work, and even recommended something for us to do later in the night. This was a nice and welcome change from almost all other restaurants one goes where the waiters can't wait to get you out of the restaurant in order to get someone new at the table.

I had the roasted tomato soup with mini grilled cheese. Although recommended as a starter, it became a filling entree.My friend had the meatloaf. This meatloaf had a such a great flavor and I was pleasantly surprised to find the meatloaf was moist! Such an amazing place and what a great way to be introduced to NY.",4,1,
194,Cassy B.,"New York, NY",30,14,8,5.0,3/28/2014,"Went to dinner last night with two of my friends and we could not decide what we fell in love with more: the food, the decor, the vibe, the yummy drinks, or super hot waiters!!! We shared a few of their apps as starters: perogies, calamari, and popcorn shrimp. The portions were so generous that we could have made that our meal. But we were totally in YOLO moments and had dinner. I had an elmo burger that was not only pretty in presentation, but also pretty darn tasty. My friends both at the steak fritte; and to quote one of my besties ""This meal was so bad that I had to finish the whole thing and refrain from licking my plate clean!!"" In other words, it was delicious all around!! And people are not joking when they've said that those truffle fries are addicting.The price of our entire dinner was very reasonable and our time was a lot of fun. Our waiter was not only a total cutie, but also very personable and funny.",1,1,

Similar to the other 500,000 brunch places in Chelsea, this place has hot waitors, loud music  (I think there's a DJ actually), and wholesome food. Food is good. I love the almond-crusted salmon, steak, truffle fries, and the fried chicken. God, if there's anything better than bacon, it's fried chicken. I love fried chicken. Their fried chicken is sweet and crispy and the truffle fries is drenched in truffle oil and drowning in Parmesan cheese. I love it. Come here, eat fried chicken, and hit on the waitors. You'll have a big ol' gay time (literally!)!",1,,
196,Hannah H.,"Atlanta, GA",1,27,3,1.0,10/29/2013,"Called to make a dinner reservation for 6 people and they told me that they were not accepting reservations. When we arrived thirty minutes later, the host asked us if we had a reservation and then looked ticked off when we said no because the person on the phone said we didn't need to. Miscommunication aside, we got a great table near the back. The service is decent and the music is LOUD! I mean, so loud that you have to scream across the table. It's like they are bumping loud tunes from the Top 20 Pop Songs playlist at full blast.The place is fine but the biggest NEGATIVE was that we arrived at 7:40, and at 8:00 pm the extremely rude hostess (blonde hair, middle aged) came over to our table and in an extremely bitchy tone announced that since we had not ordered yet we would be kicked out of our table at 9:30... Yes, and entire hour and a half away?!!!! I had out of town guests with me and was very embarrassed for the rudeness of the hostess. Did I mention we had all already ordered wine, cocktails, and an appetizer??? So it's not like we were going to hold the table hostage. Also, the tables around us were entirely empty. I don't know what her problem was. The experience with the hostess took away from our enjoyment of the rest of the evening. However, if you want to eat good food and have Lady Gaga and Katy Perry deafen you, then Elmo is perfect for you.",3,1,1
197,Lauren B.,"Boston, MA",209,323,69,5.0,4/15/2014,Came here with my friend who lives in NYC who enjoys it.We sat outside under an umbrella.  He ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the veggie burger and an appetizer of truffle friends without Parmesan.Let me say this:  BEST VEGGIE BURGER I'VE EVER HAD.Outstanding dining location.,1,,
198,Victoria X.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,3.0,3/22/2016,"Cool place. Gay friendly. Unfortunately we just missed the brunch and the crowd (good for gals) that goes along w it. The atmosphere leans towards trendy and chic, with background music w a good beat. We had the Kale Salad and the Fireside Marguerita, both which were delicious. We ordered one other item but the waiter forgot about it and we had to wait another 20 minutes to get it- just a roasted beet salad, which was nothing special, especially since the beets were not roasted at all. Also, the Maitre D said they had an item on the menu which we were specifically looking for and the waiter told us the item was not and had never been on the menu. Nevertheless, we both enjoyed it and I will probably return !",,,
199,Donna C.,"New York, NY",128,23,2,4.0,11/25/2014,"One my my favorite brunch spots. we always order the truffle fries to share, because, TRUFFLE FRIES. Even if there's a wait it's never more than 20 minutes and it's so worth it. I'm also a huge fan of their tomato soup, mac and cheese, and burgers.",,,
