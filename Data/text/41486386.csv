My wife could absolutely take me in a fight. ...but the Manly Burger is me all the way.Drowned in house beer-cheddar cheese, covered with a generous amount of bacon lardons and onion strings, sprinkled with smoked-salt, and slathered with umami ketchup AND mustard spread...this is a winning combination. I don't know what makes it a manly combination, but as a male human, I am definitely into it.Beware: I really don't know why bourbon is more expensive at this bar than in most of Manhattan, but you should know it's probably gonna cost you $15-17 plus tax and tip.That said, on a night that I really needed a bourbon and a burger, I overpaid for both here and left absolutely satisfied.",15,14,11

It's POURING out, so I went to Umame burger so i didn't have to go out. I did not like their regular burgers when I came her the last two times as they lacked any flavor.

2,Stephanie J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,60,58,3.0,9/6/2018,For me the food was just average. I had the slider trio (the truffle one was the best). They were good but nothing spectacular. I guess I went in expecting more. The fries were really good though. I tried both the regular thin fries and the truffle fries. Truffle is life. The place itself is very chic and pretty. Good vibe and a great place for happy hour drinks or quick meeting. But I paid $17 for a margarita :/. Thank God it was strong and didn't need another one!,,,

Lol sue me. Found this place a few blocks from my job and took the short stroll uphill. The hotel (downstairs) lobby/entrance is rather bland and doesn't provide any indication of what's inside. Up the escalator, to the right is the entrance to Umami Burger.... Quick left at the concierge desk. Once you walk into the restaurant, you get a food court feel but with only a burger joint and a bar lol. The spacing/seating was great, the staff promptly took my food/drink order, and before I could finish round one of my Jamo n Ginger my ""meal buzzer"" prompted me to get my Chicken sandwich. Correct, I didn't actually order a burger.Sitting in this massive dining are, I noticed an outside section that was divided into smoking and no smoking. Made my way outside, sipped my drink, munched on my burger, and enjoyed the sun in the non-smoking section. This place is beautiful.... A bit pricy tho but it's to be expected from a hotel restaurant. I would have like the burger to come with sides, especially at that price. No complaints on the drinks... large glass, noticeable whiskey in there, well crafter, and promptly delivered. Still, $15 is a lot for one drink. I'll try again during happy hour.Food: 4/5Drinks: 4/5Price: 3/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5",1,,

7,Monica F.,"Manhattan, NY",157,177,127,2.0,7/9/2018,"Don't expect great customer service if you come here. Went to use a gift card and was told both over the phone and before getting in the 20~ minute line that gift cards could be used. When I asked at the restaurant, I was actually given a sarcastic answer of ""no, you have to go to Umami Burger to use an Umami Burger gift card...."" followed by ""of course you can use it here."" 20 minutes later (and 40 minutes to even get there), we were told you could not in fact use a gift card. When we asked to speak to a manager regarding the fact that we were told TWICE we could, they had us wait and then told us the manager was busy and we were promptly dismissed and told to call if we had a problem with it. IF you don't care about those things, the space is absolutely beautiful and huge. I believe it is the Hudson Hotel's space that is what's actually nice, not directly part of Umami burger, but the space available for Umami Burger patrons to sit includes spacious ceilings, and an outdoor garden area. So it has potential to be a pleasant experience if you're not dealing with anyone that works there....",,,

It does not come with a side of fries nor lettuce or tomatoes. Found it over priced it was good but not that good for 16$ at-least give a side of fries & then maybe price can match up. I had the Manly burger it was very cheesy as i like however  this might be rather much for some people as the cheese has a lot of flavor going on. I also tried there cali burger that one i enjoyed a little better but again it was just okay. Idk maybe cause i have enjoyed better five napkin burger & five guys for cheaper to similar prices.,1,2,1

Located inside the incredibly chic Hudson Hotel, I was a little surprised to walk in and see that there's no wait service, you order your food, get a buzzer, and pick it up when it's ready. Two burgers, sweet potato fries, and two soft drinks ran us about $44 bucks.... can you go to Shake Shack and get the same meal for a little more than half the price? Probably...but like I said I'm biased. My burger was delicious, my boyfriends was undercooked. I enjoyed the laidback atmosphere. We didn't get anything to drink from the bar, but it looked like a full bar and it's directly across from where you order / pick up your burgers. I will be back!",1,,1

19,Shawn R.,"Patchogue, NY",0,16,20,4.0,8/29/2018,"Tried Umami Burger at the Hudson hotel while visiting Central Park and 59th street. The restaurant is located in the hotel upstairs all the way towards the back. I liked the decor as it was lounge-like and had loads of seating options for all types of visitors (families, young folks hanging out, a quick bite for lunch). Being as I never had Umami before I tried the slider sampler and I was NOT disappointed. It was delicious. All three burgers melted in my mouth and presented my palate with an explosively different set of tastes. If you just want to see what the new sense is all about try it yourself and be pleasantly surprised.",,,

It's located inside the Hudson Hotel, and people can either eat in the lounge area inside or outside, where there are lots of tables. Here, you have to order and pick up your food at the counter. The menu is also a lot simpler than that of the Greenwich place. My friend and I got the Umami and truffle fries to share, and I don't know if it was because we were starving, but they were both super delicious and just what we were looking for. The hotel also has beautiful ceilings, so it's a nice environment to eat and chat with friends - highly recommend!",3,,

23,Anna Z.,"Houston, TX",337,118,61,4.0,7/28/2017,"This Umami Burger location is tucked inside the gorgeous Hudson Hotel. Signage is sparse but once in the lobby, you'll see the iconic neon burger to your right. You'll find restrooms along the hallway leading to a general bar area with open seating and the Umami Burger order window. The area is pretty loud, but there are a variety of spaces including tables, couches, and lounge chairs, which I enjoyed. There are high ceilings and views into the gorgeous Hudson courtyard.This was my first time at an Umami Burger so I can't compare with other locations, but this location offered 5 dinner burgers - the classic Umami, Cali (two parties), truffle burger, Manly (beer cheese and bacon) and a fried chicken breast burger. Sides include truffle fries and cheeses tots. There were a few other menu items as well. We went with Umami burgers all around - came out super juicy but mine was a little cooler than I would like when served a burger. I found the burger true to its name, highlight was a unique savory/Umami flavor that wasn't overwhelming. Seasoning is pretty light. The cheese is actually a crisp and the mushroom is one shiitake cap which meant it basically came out in one bite. I felt like I couldn't taste much of the other toppings aside from the patty.We also ordered cheesy tots and this was definitely a highlight. Each tot is about the size of three normal tots! Super crisp and piping out the outside but the inside had a semi smooth/chunky consistency. I would have liked to have a little bit more cheese flavor shine through but these tots dipped in the house made ketchup were absolutely amazing. The ketchup itself tastes fresh and not sweet like artificial ketchup.Overall, this is a great location to grab a bite to eat and just hang out! Across the lobby is the Library bar, and in between is a stunning outdoor courtyard with greenery and hanging lights.",2,,
24,Howard A.,"Long Island City, NY",11,48,11,1.0,3/13/2018,"After trying this place it is really clear to me why other locations are closing down. They advertise say hello to umami, the savory, bold and flavorful fifth taste.Well holly cr@p. There is some sugar laden syrupy goo that is on the the Umami burger and makes it inedible.  There is a high probability this is the worst burger I have ever had. McDonald's has it all over this place taste wise and we all know how bad McDonald's sucks.  I also noticed the crumbly texture of the meat which is a clear indication that there is a lot of things other than meat mixed in.  When it is mostly beef it binds to itself, when its loaded with too much other stuff it just crumbles apart like these do.   Do yourself a favor and forget this sugar bomb garbage. Don't waste your time, money, or an opportunity to eat something worth eating!",,1,
25,Seisei T.,"New York, NY",116,94,2,2.0,9/29/2017,"Meh. We were curious so finally checked it out.First, neither of us particularly loves truffles. They tend to be overused and cloying, and it's rare to find a place that uses them sparingly and well. So we deliberately ordered items without truffle oil (the umami burger, crispy chicken, and cheesy tater tots).The burger is ok. We'd go to shake shack first before coming here, especially at these prices. Surprisingly bland given how much was on it (do y'all believe in salt?).Crispy chicken: better than the burger, but also bland.The tots: my, my. These were excellent and will make a great hangover cure. At least, that's what I thought until I hit a tot that tasted like it had been rolled in truffle oil. I choked and it took a minute to get my breath back.The reality is that truffle oil is used by average restaurants to cover up their mediocrity and justify an inflated price point. No, thanks. We probably won't be back (although we are curious about the wings and the Caesar salad actually looked good).",,,

There is no table service, so instead you have to go to the bar, order your drinks, carry them back to your table and you get charged 20% of the total cost for zero reason. There was only 4 of us so there was no reason for an automatic gratuity as we were not a large group.We ordered 2 bottles of wine and i had to pay $24 in gratuity to the bar staff that simply twisted the tops off and handed over some glasses that we had to walk back to the tables ourselves. When i wished to discuss this automatic gratuity, management advised me that this is common practice in New York. I may sound like a tourist but over the years i have lived in NYC i have never seen this automatic gratuity added - especially for staff that were too busy gossiping behind the bar to actually warrant a tip in the first place. This bar being situated in a hotel is most likely taking advantage of tourists and i warn anyone not to purchase bottles of wine here. There are plenty of other venues that won't rip you off.

31,Tamara L.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",1,35,31,3.0,12/1/2017,"Went to the Hudson Hotel with a friend, with the idea of checking out the various options. There are three (not counting outdoor bars, which were closed for the season): Umami Burger, Hudson Bar, and Library Bar, all on the second floor at the top of the escalator. We first went to the Library Bar, but were immediately repelled by the douchey vibe. We must have caught them on a popular night (it was a Thursday) because it was loud and crowded with Wall Street types swilling drinks, pounding their chests, and bellowing over each other, not at all like the description on the Hudson Hotel website or other Yelp reviews (or like a library for that matter.)  We decided to grab a drink at the Hudson Bar, which is a vast hotel lounge with a long bar on the left.  Prices are refreshingly not atrocious, especially for a NYC hotel bar. I had a glass of Malbec ($14) my friend had a Manhattan ($16, I think), and both were fine. The space did feel a little empty and cold because it is so large, and they didn't serve any bar food, which is a major fail, IMHO. We went to Umami Burger next.  The restaurant is very casual with a variety of seating options, and TVs high up on the walls tuned to different sports. The crowd was pretty much the opposite of the Library Bar. We had Japanese style wings and a Caesar salad.  Neither were worth writing home about, but they did the trick.  Overall the experience was ok, but I doubt I'll be back any time soon.",,1,
32,W L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,1.0,3/24/2018,"Is POOR SERVICE a hallmark of all UMAMI BURGER restaurants?  or is the POOR SERVICE stemming from the HUDSON HOTEL or  is the POOR SERVICE coming from just particular establishment?   Its hard to tell.NOT ONLY was the service POOR, the *MANAGER* was *INSULTING*.TODAY, We had a group of 10 doctors and tech executives join us for burgers at this location.  We were all dressed nicely and had ordered bottles of wine, burgers, and fries for the group.  They were gathered to take me out for my birthday.  As the organizer of the event, my girlfriend had arrived an hour early to chat with the lady in charge to work out the details of where we could sit, the size of the party, how to cut the cake, how to serve the cake, and the what we would order.The party next to us was a nice elderly party who apparently purchased a spread of food which was far more than they could eat. One gentleman from that party came over to our group several times and chatted with us.  He joked with the guys and chatted with the lovely, young ladies in our group.   Toward the end before his party left, he offered us some of their many untouched fruit servings.  One of our vegetarian friends took him up on his offer.   Our interaction with the other party was cordial and civilized.My girlfriend unveiled the cake.  The group sang happy birthday and even our neighboring parties applauded.  Up to this point, I was having a great time with my friends.Then all of a sudden, some buzz-kill guy, a dark haired, scruffy man dressed in a wrinkled dress shirt, poked his head in among our birthday photo taking to ask if we had a reservation.  He claimed he was the **MANAGER** and tried to shame my girlfriend in front of our professional associates and friends who were executives and doctors.   He was completely uncouth, uncivilized and low class.  Apparently, he also tried to accuse us of 'stealing' fruit from the other party who had offered it to us.The venue is very nice, but if you are looking for professional service and a great time, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO.   If you are looking for some overbearing schmuck (buzz-kill) who wants to wave a 'manager' title around and jump in your face during a social engagement to try to shame you, then this is the right place.Lets just say that I now understand why one of the doctors recommended against going to this establishment.For civilized folks looking for a good time, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!  (too bad I can't give zero stars)",3,,

46,Leo G.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,5,4.0,10/6/2017,I stopped here for some late-night dinner while staying a few days at the Hudson. The burgers were good but everything was really rich and heavy. The beers were overpriced. I'd go to a different bar before ending up here for late night grub.,1,,
47,Justyna B.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,4,0,3.0,12/16/2017,"Normally I visit the Greenwich village location which is consistently excellent. I regularly get the truffle burger-rare. I ordered the truffle burger at this location, cooked rare. I even specified to the gentleman who took my order ""the more blood the better etc"". However my burger was not rare at all! More like medium. Is there a reason why they overlook it at this location? Please answer!! If so I will continue to go to the Greenwich Village location even though this one is a four minute walk from my apartment.",,,
48,Pete G.,"New York, NY",6,108,0,2.0,9/15/2017,"Disappointing.  I asked what was recommended, the umami or the truffle burger,  and was told the truffle. Burger was fairly tasteless and truffle cheese only slightly less tasteless. And I LOVE truffles. Bun was like Wonder bread. No tomato, onion,  lettuce or anything. I'm anxious to try another location as other reviews say they're better. This one's a dud.",1,,
49,Tim D.,"Boston, MA",3,64,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"This was not good and definitely not worth the price. Our food was lukewarm--burgers and fries both. Not impressed with the overall taste either. I haven't had Umami Burger elsewhere, so I'm not sure if it's just this location, or if all or overrate and mediocre.",2,,
50,Russ G.,"Ridgewood, Australia",0,2,0,1.0,8/17/2017,"Hungry for a burger, my partner and I were staying at the Hudson Hotel - so it seemed the best option. BIG REGRETS. Seriously, these burgers were pretty woeful. Random ""gourmet"" topping don't necessarily relate to a good burger. I had the Umami Burger and my partner hard the Cali. Neither impressed and the cost was certainly not an indicator of quality. In fact, I suspect a basic burger made with traditional toppings with a well seasoned patty cooked to perfection would taste better. The ONLY reason I didn't give a '0' rating was the truffle fries...but then again...truffles go brilliantly with anythingreally AND have a true ""umami"" thing happening. In terms of ambiance, the place is dark and fairly loud. Granted it is contained in the Hudson Hotel - but the bar couldn't even put together a simple Harvey Wallbanger cocktail. Save your $$...go elsewhere",2,,

Burgers were lukewarm, bun was cold like it had just been taken out of the fridge. I ordered the classic Umami burger, which I've had in both Los Angeles and in Greenwich Village, and it came with almost no toppings...just a tiny piece of the roasted tomato and a single piece of mushroom.Such a disappointment. Hudson Commons was much better!",1,,

Updated review",Total fail. The Hudson Hotel should be embarrassed with themselves on this move. Locals used to love the Hudson Commons for football games. Everything that was cool is gone for some burger chain that is just awful.,,,
56,Glenn F.,"Melville, NY",42,2,0,1.0,4/22/2018,"WOW. What a disappointment. My first Umami Burger experience was in Chicago and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. No such luck at the Hudson Hotel in my hometown of NYC.  Not sure how the same burger can taste so different in different cities but that is exactly what happened.  At $14, the Umami Burger was a BIG disappointment. The Manly Burger just less slightly so. The cheesy tots ($6.50) tasted more like bad and boring tater tots. Plenty of better burger joints in the city. Try Wollensky's Grill, Burger Joint,  Corner Bistro,  Brindle Room or even Shake Shake. Avoid this overpriced option.",,,
57,James L.,"El Paso, TX",0,13,9,4.0,10/9/2017,The location of this Umami Burger is astounding! It takes place at the Hudson hotel and all the details of the hotel as well as the restaurant itself is eye catching. The light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and the fireplace that stays lit year round creates a homey vibe of he place. I sat and ate outside and it was a real garden outdoorsy feel to it as if I was at a high end barbecue party. I ordered the Umami Burger and it was delicious! It had shittake mushrooms and cheese. I ordered a side of sweet potatoes because what is a burger without fries?! I will say that it is a bit pricy especially for a burger this size. I spent nearly $20 on the burger and fries which was merely the size of my fist. I finished my burger within minutes and it didn't quite fill me up as I hoped it would. My friends ordered the Cali burger which they said wasn't seasoned as well as they liked but everyone was raving about the sweet potato fries!,,,

59,New Yorker Reviewer G.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",5,32,44,1.0,2/10/2018,"I've been an avid umami fanatic for years now and today I tried going to my regular 6th Avenue location and to my disappointment they closed!! So I found this location on yelp and went there instead. I must say that each of my visits to umami on 6th Avenue, the service was consistently poor.  Here, in this Hudson location, they took the service out of it?! Very strange, it almost seems like they couldn't get the service right so they decided to take the service factor out of it? Weird and just very uninformative, you just walk in not knowing where to go or where to sit, awkward setting with no seating at the bar area.  Drinks are ordered and paid for at one area, food is ordered at another area and you have to do all the work yourself, including; pick up the food and utensils and find a table.  Very uninviting and a tremendous disappointment of umami.  Glass of Pinot Grigio was $15! Whoah.  And they ran out of bloody Mary's, which were particularly my favorite drink there.  With service completely lacking, drinks being way overpriced, and food has completely diminished in quality, it's quite unfortunate, I am very upset and most likely may not be back.",,,
60,Lucrecia C.,"Scarsdale, NY",33,7,1,1.0,9/3/2017,"This is just an overpriced burger. The guy who takes the orders had such a hard time understanding our order. The veggie burger is just a bun with a portobello mushroom lettuce and tomato (14$), the other burgers were plain . We spent 65$ for three burgers , two fries and two bottles of sparkling water .  The location is cool has a nice bar and music , we were here for lunch because we were meeting someone at the Hudson hotel , maybe at night with a few drinks the food tastes better",,,
61,Leinee H.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,6,5.0,9/3/2017,"Excellent, high quality burger. We got the classic umami burger and cheesy tots which were both delicious. The restaurant is spacious, with high ceilings, long tables and has a bar with TVs. Will definitely be coming back.",,,
62,Dam M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,3,1.0,7/27/2017,"This is a fake Umami Burger. They do not have the Ahi Tuna burger and make no mention of this on their website. In addition they do not have many of the other speciality burgers on a normal Umami Burger menu. Shame. I asked the staff and they had no idea the Ahi Tuna burger existed. When I go to a chain I expect to get what the normal locations have (or tell me on the website ahead of time). Skip this fake location, it's meant to rip off the tourists in the hotel. Sad.",2,,
