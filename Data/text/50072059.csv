0,Christine Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,64,91,5.0,10/23/2018,I love love love Dig Inn. This location is new and so close to my office. I used to go to the one on Madison Street but once they opened this location I was so happy.They have amazing food here. The sides and meats are really good. Sometimes I just want it all. Their menu changes depending on the season. All their food are fresh. The beets and brussel sprouts are my go to when they do have them. Their homemade sriracha is also really good. I would love to come here everyday but it's a little pricey. Can't afford $13 for lunch everyday.,,,
1,Melissa T.,"New York, NY",106,110,104,4.0,7/2/2018,"Although I did not love my bowl, how Dig Inn handled my complaint was wonderful. This was my first visit and the restaurant was extremely busy, to say the least. They were fully out of rice and only serving quinoa or green base, which was ok. I went for the quinoa and the taste was acquired after a few bites and sauce mixtures. However, I asked the staff member if the chicken I ordered was grilled breast and he spoke so quickly, I thought he said yes. Needless to say, it was dark meat, which I cannot eat. With half my bowl tossed out, I sent them a note and was reimbursed. That is customer service.The broccoli & potato salad I ordered as sides were delic. I will definitely give them another try.",1,,
2,Narvina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,49,96,4.0,9/26/2018,"My favorite lunch spot. It's seemingly healthy and quite delicious. Not nice on your wallet, but worth every penny. I only get the brown rice, chicken breast, broccoli, and sweet potatoes. Wish it were lunch time now!",1,2,1
3,T G.,"Hoboken, NJ",15,150,203,4.0,7/19/2018,"Love this location but was sad they didn't have many protein options. They were completely out of chicken breast/meatballs- this was 12pm on a Thursday for lunch. The line was out the door but I was surprised to see they were out of many options. The roasted broccoli, peaches and sweet potato was delicious. I also love that you can mix your base - I did brown rice and farm greens. The pesto was also perfect and I liked that they included it in a small container on side. They also don't have a lot of seating - it's a smaller location so just a heads up if you are looking to sit and eat!",1,,1
4,Keisha F.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,21,0,2.0,10/30/2018,"Ran out food before 1pm...prime lunch time. Or they lied about re-upping on the brussel sprouts. Either way, not standing in line for 20 minutes to not get what I want. Also, food was lukewarm and not as good as I remember Dig Inn being. Won't be back.",,,
5,Diana L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",15,18,21,4.0,10/3/2018,Well.. here's the thing. This spot is quite pricey... but actually nice food :) especially when you want something a little more flavors but still wanna be healthy ;),,,
6,Linda G.,"Flushing, NY",0,5,0,5.0,11/8/2018,"So, I like the food, I'm not always in the mood for healthy, but today I was, I went ordered and went to pay, I forgot they only took credit cards, and I only had cash on me as my account was hacked and so the card is no longer valid (yes I only have 1 credit card). They gave the food to me anyway, say that it was ok to take it. They also stated it was company policy since a lot of patrons didn't realize the credit card only policy. I think in today's world of corporate hussle, Dig In is standing out as a ""Good Guy"" we need more of that today. Well Done Dig In, Well Done!",,,
7,Jacqueline K.,"Rockville, MD",279,15,1,4.0,10/4/2018,"Ordered their herb roasted chicken with broccoli and sweet potatoes for lunch on a random Wednesday. The sweet potatoes and broccoli were delicious. However, I wasn't particularly fond of the kale salad and their chicken. It wasn't that the chicken was too dry, which is a common problem with chicken, but it had a distinct taste to it that made me feel as though it wasn't as fresh as it could be.",1,1,
8,Vivi W.,"Baltimore, MD",0,33,28,4.0,8/5/2018,Everything tasted pretty good. My favorite was the mac n cheese. The steak tasted pretty bland so would recommend some other protein.,1,1,
9,Yazmine E.,"Queens, NY",171,21,13,5.0,8/14/2018,Walked all the way here because the one on Madison is terrible. Everything was clean. The staff was very professional and friendly. Great food how it should be. Recommend coming here or any other location than the one by grand central. Did i forget this one is clean?,,,
10,Erin C.,"New York, NY",187,148,146,5.0,2/23/2018,"This location's staff is super friendly and kind. I ordered the Wild Salmon protein option but it wasn't available as it was the end of the day. The nice server said he would need to heat it up in the oven and that it would take a few minutes. I'm so grateful that he took the extra work and time to do this for me instead of saying ""it was sold out."" The broccoli, spicy potatoes and faro were all deliciously prepared. I have been to other Dig Inn locations where the staff was not as friendly and the food was not as hot and fresh. This location kept its tables clean and vibe friendly and warm.",1,,
11,Sophia Z.,"Carmel, IN",208,95,68,5.0,1/27/2018,"Obsessed. Can't say enough good things about this chain. I try to eat paleo and it's difficult to find quick/cheap/to-go places that satisfy my dietary needs. This place has guilt free nourishment that will leave you wanting more!I recommend: rice bowl with kale, Brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, and antibiotic free chicken breast!!",1,,1
12,Suki C.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,120,223,4.0,2/15/2018,"Decided I wanted to treat myself today and wanted to try this location out! I have been to the one on Broadway and 28th but after moving to a new job, that was not convenient but luckily this location opened! Yay! First, this location is small and the line up system is pretty annoying being that it wraps into the dining area which people have to constantly move around so people can sit. The line though did move pretty fast, from lining  up to getting my food, I was in and out in 10 minutes. I always order the same things: brown rice, charred broccoli and sweet potatoes with charred chicken thighs. Portion is great! After selecting what you want, it is pretty filled to the rim! Since the last time I went, the prices seem to have gone up but not surprised. I was super excited to eat this when I got back to my office. Everything was reallly good and seasoned well however 1 star off because my charred broccoli- some florets were burnt. I did not enjoy it much as it was dry and just did not taste good but everything else was good! Will be back!",,,
13,Cat C.,"Manhattan, NY",62,116,46,2.0,12/18/2017,"Too crowded!The line was really long and the store is too small to accommodate everyone coming in and out. It was also really cold inside since the door was constantly being opened. The line moved at an average place. I wouldn't say fast. I liked Dig Inn better when they had the portioned out platters and not just 1 bowl where everything is mixed together. I feel their protein portion is skimpy and the brussel sprouts were too salty. The pressed chicken and sweet potato were pretty good.After paying, there is really not enough room at the utensil/drink area. They had bags laid out but this area was packed with people struggling to put a bowl into a bag. Suggestion to the restaurant: Pack the bowl before handing it off to the customer.I had to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge to get out of the place. Totally exasperating!",2,,
14,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",179,220,726,5.0,1/23/2018,"I was feeling slightly adventurous today and wanted something besides my usual soup/salad go-to in the garment district and I am so glad I gave dig inn a try!The first thing that struck me was the incredible aroma of all the veggie preparations and the meats on display in front of me. Another really great thing was show cheerful and welcoming the lady was behind the counter, especially after I told her this was my first time here. In my head i had scored this place 5 stars already.Now to the food and ordering-It's basically like an assembly line which starts with a base which can be any one of the 3 options of Farro, brown rice and salad greens. I got the salad greens.Next step is to choose two sides out of the a huge variety of tossed kale, stewed apples, roasted BrusselsSprouts, cauliflower with capers and raisins etc. I got the cauliflower and the stewed apples( i know it's an odd combination but hey as I said I was in an adventurous mood!). I must give a special mention to the cauliflower because the combination of capers and raisins with charred onions and cauliflower just blew my mind. What an amazing flavor burst. The apples served as a healthy dessert after my meal was over :)Finally i got to choose the protein and with all the meats to choose from along with tofu, I went with tofu.All in all i was quite proud of the bowl that I helped put together and also highly impressed with the options I had to choose from. Also, they do not hold back with their portion sizes so be sure to be well fed and get your money's worth when you come here.",,,
15,Colie R.,"New York, NY",58,156,279,4.0,3/16/2018,Super busy location due to location.  For sure a good location for lunch during the week. This specific location is closed on Saturdays and Sundays.  The location itself is pretty small so the line can get annoying and tight during the lunch rush.  When I got in the line was wrapped around pretty good but I was still in and out in about nine minutes.  Staff was super efficient and friendly.,2,,
16,Juliana J.,"New York, NY",239,57,41,3.0,7/12/2018,"Very expensive for only okay food. If you like plain roasted veggies over quinoa then this is the place for you. Marketed as healthy but lets be honest, you are eating way more than you should be for lunch. I heard the mac and cheese was good though. Great place for basic pallets and overly picky eaters.",1,,2
17,Matthew L.,"New York, NY",18,67,0,5.0,8/15/2018,"Great, consistent lunch and dinner for anyone in Midtown. Order ahead as it gets crowded during lunch.",,,

Updated review","After an unsatisfactory first experience, the owner was kind enough to reach out to me. He assured me that the issues had been resolved, and welcomed me to give them another try.I've since been back a few times and am happy to report that the issues have indeed been resolved. I noticed this first hand and also observed it with other customers. I really appreciate the owner and chef's efforts to make things right.I now feel comfortable coming here again and look forward to becoming a repeat visitor.",1,,2
19,Ania W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0,3.0,8/29/2018,What happened to Dig Inn?  Their old menus used to be much tastier (before this location opened).  The food now is so salty and over spiced that it's hard to taste the actual veggies.,1,,
20,Amber C.,"Manhattan, NY",120,12,11,4.0,2/9/2018,"4 stars. It's good like what I usually like in other locations. 1 star off because it was way too salty.  I know you probably make it in bulk, but please go light on the salt...... It felt like I was marinating my mouth.... I love the food and the freshness!",,,
21,Veronica N.,"North Billerica, MA",0,7,0,5.0,7/17/2018,"Incredible experiences with Dig Inn NYC Garment District catering for business A++++ HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  Every order I've placed for their fresh and delish catered packages has been topnotch and a big hit with customers and internal execs alike.  And then, also - Vanessa  saved my life when  I screwed up an order for an important meeting and had to call-- she TOTALLY cared and helped me to get that order straightened out  and BOOM!! -- food arrived on time. I am so grateful, folks if you are across country ordering catering in NYC -- you can't ask for better than this.  (Can't wait to eat there myself just for me on an upcoming trip to NYC! :))  THANK YOU Dig Inn!",,,
22,Mariana I.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,14,11,3.0,2/8/2018,"I love the idea of the place, local farms, farm raised chickens, no pesticides, etc. And the line, although long, went very quickly. But the food was kind of bland, the texture was there but not the favor. The Mac and cheese was great! The salmon didn't have a lot of flavor. It was cooked medium rare, and the skins were very crispy which I liked. But I I felt it could have been better seasoned. The pesto sauce was also amazing!I'm conflicted about this rating, but I'll definitely try the place again and edit my review!",,,
23,Lily P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/6/2018,"The food here is delicious. Each side dish has such a fresh flavor. The chicken is moist and tasty as well. The staff is super kind, even letting you sample a side dish if you are unsure of what to get. The prices are similar to that of the the other places in the area ($12 for a bowl with chicken as the protein) but the portions are much larger. I also love that they have house made unsweetened iced teas that are only $2.50! Highly recommended if you are looking for a warm, flavorful, and filling ""homey"" meal.",,,
24,Shineil P.,"Newark, NJ",0,8,15,4.0,12/27/2017,"I tried Dig Inn once a few years back and wasn't too impressed with it. This location opened a few weeks ago and I figured I'd give them another try since they're close to my job. This time around I was really impressed with the food. For roughly $1-$12, I got a bowl filled with food. Their chicken was well cooked (very tender) and well seasoned. Their sweet potatoes and mac & cheese were really really tasty. I opted for Farro as my base and it added a great flavor to the entire meal. Every bite was good. The only reason I gave them 4-stars vs. 5-stars is because the establishment is rather small. They need a bigger space because the lunch hour crowd is ridiculous. In addition, It's a little weird that the cashier hands you your bowl without bagging it. You're required to bag your own meal, which is annoying because the area where the bags are is small and always crowded with people struggling to fit their bowl in the bag. Please help these folks, clearly the struggle is real. Other than that, the staff seems friendly and the place looks clean!",,,
25,Max K.,"Lahaina, HI",14,1,0,5.0,6/25/2018,"Dig Inn is one of the best places for lunch in New York City. If you get another side instead of a protein, the total comes out to only 10 dollars for a giant, nutrient filled bowl that actuslly tastes great. The workers there are extremely kind and the quality is consistent.",,,
26,G S.,"New York, NY",196,8,0,5.0,6/12/2018,"Double shout out to Josh and Jenny for truly excellent service. Hard for a fast food sorta spot in nyc to impress on customer service (and food), especially in Times Square. This guy and gal totally did. Will definitely be coming back for the food and now for the service too.",,,
27,Ethan C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",124,3,0,4.0,1/7/2018,"All of the food options here are absolutely delicious! Try to avoid going during rush times because the lines can get pretty long. The manager did a fabulous job handling all of the crowds though! Seating is pretty limited, but the atmosphere inside the restaurant is very fun. The food itself tasted very fresh and I particularly loved how the farms from which their produce originated were noted on the wall. Definitely would recommend!",,,
28,Novella N.,"New York, NY",5,70,57,5.0,4/1/2018,"Every Dig Inn location I go to, they never disappoint! Great location to stop by if you are headed to a Broadway show or just want a quick bite. Love the fact they rotate the different types of veggies and cater to vegans. Ever since I quit eating dairy, I do miss eating their mac and cheese! If you don't have an allergy, make sure you try that and their garlic aioli as your sauce.",,,
29,Elise T.,"Smyrna, GA",8,33,2,5.0,3/15/2018,"I'm here for business and didn't feel like going anywhere to eat, so I used Uber Eats. What a gem! Food is fresh a amazing flavors! Highly recommend!",,,
30,Kelsey N.,"Orlando, FL",0,3,1,1.0,5/24/2018,"Food tasted great. I got Peruvian potatoes, broccoli, salad and salmon. In addition to my bowl I also got food poisoning...! Perfect start to MDW",,,
31,Kelly S.,"New York, NY",218,74,71,3.0,1/30/2018,"I'm a huge fan of Dig Inn but this location was mediocre. Not as great of meat choices or vegetables, go to a bigger one with better choices",1,,
32,Anna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/31/2018,"I eat here a lot and given the line out the door every day, everyone in the neighborhood does too! The staff is always super friendly and the food is worth the line. The menu changes with the season so I'll never get sick of eating here!",,,

Updated review","Love this place. It's like a heartier Sweetgreen- the portions are generous and they have nice warm vegetables. You can make it as little or extra healthy as you want but they have nicely seasoned options- I had maple sweet potato, cauliflower, kale salad, farrow and greens. It was enough for a dinner and I mixed leftovers with spring mix for lunch the next day",,,
36,X J.,"New York, NY",0,18,4,5.0,6/23/2018,Love Dig Inn!! Always a favorite of mine! Great food at a great price. Lots of options to choose from and the customer service has been superb!,,,
37,Andi M.,"Astoria, NY",61,4,1,5.0,1/18/2018,"The first few days when it opened, the food was simply not good when compared to other Dig Inn locations. Now...it's become great! I'm so happy with the fact that this location is about a 4 min walk from my office and how quickly I can order food from the app and pick it up within 10 minutes. The food itself is delicious and they always have seasonal ingredients. I get to try something different every time, even though I usually stick to the upstate mac and cheese and charred chicken as my two staples. Just try it, it's likely that it will meet and exeed your expecations.",,,
38,Craig C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,24,0,5.0,1/5/2018,We're visiting from California and asked local friends for lunch options. Dig Inn was highly recommended and it didn't disappoint!  Wonderful flavors that left us discussing which spices each contained. Brussels sprouts and carrots were standouts!  Steak was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. Recommend it. Well done.,,,
39,Lauren Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,46,72,5.0,4/17/2018,"Dig Inn is my favorite lunch spot in Midtown. Everything I have tried here is absolutely delicious and healthy. It is a little pricey, but the portion is large and filling. I absolutely love the idea that you get a base, main and 2 sides with your bowl along with choices of specialty sauces; it keeps lunch interesting. I highly recommend starting off your bowl with half Classic Brown Rice and half Farm Greens with Mint. For the sides, my mouth waters for the Coconut Roasted Carrots, the Roasted Sweet Potatoes, the Sautèed Broccoli with Lemon and the Cashew Kale Caesar salad. I haven't gotten around to trying the other sides yet, but I can imagine they are all equally delicious. For the main, I always get the Herb Roasted Chicken breast paired nicely with the House-made Sriracha sauce. Also, be sure to get the Rosemary Vinaigarette for the rice/greens base, it really adds such a nice flavor to it. Dig Inn gets very crowded during lunch time, but luckily they have an option available to order ahead online if you don't feel like waiting in line for 10 minutes. I will always come back to Dig Inn! Overall, I give 5 stars.",,,
40,Kirstin G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",284,1,0,5.0,5/29/2018,"Restaurant was amazing! First tome here! Food was delicious! (MAC and cheese, salad, green beans and chicken). They recommended that sirrancha sauce which was sooo good. I was told it was cash free and I didn't have my card so they gave it to me for free. Amazing customer  service  and great food. I'll def be back!",,,
41,John J.,"Miami, FL",0,1,0,5.0,4/2/2018,"Dig Inn is amazing. Every location and every meal I've had has been excellent. The broadway location especially has the greatest staff of all time which includes Will! I've never had someone go out of their way before like Will has. I highly recommend this place to everyone. If you're even slightly far away, make the trip. It 'will' be worth it! Haha ;) Did you like that one?",,,
