Yes, this is truly a dive bar, but a good one. Some people are calling it a Texas roadhouse style bar. Call it what you want, but this was for me a wrong turn and an interesting experience.  If you are a lover of country music, you might just get lucky and get what you like or just get great price drinks or beers to wash down a bad day.

Surprisingly it is not just the $3 twisted tea's that draw me to this gem of a watering hole. It's everything. Where to begin. Usually the night starts out praying a corner table is open. I really can't get comfortable unless I am sitting there. Sometimes it opens up quickly but if not I barter with whoever has claimed it so it is never an issue. Once that is resolved, I make my way to the bar where the twisted tea flows like Poland Spring in Poland. This is where the night starts to take off. If no one is playing Buck Hunter, you better believe I take advantage of that and win every single time because come on, I am a Buck Hunter legend and have not faced a worthy challenger. If I am feeling risky I then try and get involved with some pool, partnering up with one of the boys and trying to take down whoever holds the table. I am bit more humble with my pool game and will begrudgingly admit I have lost two games ever. In between all this my challis is filled with twisted tea while mixing in shots of Jameson. Sometimes me and the boys post up for a couple hours, other times we stay till they pull down the iron gates. No matter what, I always leave smiling and happy I chose Doc's! Amen!",2

This poor kid decided to stand on his table during a super happy song and time of the night and we watched the bouncer approach him and instead of asking him to get down... he grabbed him by the sweater and ripped him (and his sweater) down and shoved him outside. All of our jaws dropped as yes it was hilarious but really it was incredibly outrageously shitty of a move. Kid was just trying to hang. Then the bartender went legit off at me because my girlfriend asked for my bill which had my name. She honestly went off as if it was some global rule that you can't ask for someone else's check.

Aside from the fact that the music is a big quirky (country mixed with... stuff??), the service is pretty basic and somewhat rude.

The waitress literally looked like she was homeless and lied to us multiple times. Check other yelp reviews - the truth is out there. It was almost absurd. The waitress doesn't know how to make drinks and charges for her uneducated and quite disgusting service. It was almost insane coming into a random bar and being ignored and treated like trash because of a homeless-looking bartender. Def I'm going to tell my 400+ friends to NOT EVER GO HERE. It's scary.

It generally results in about 30-40 cans of barely opened Heinekens on the table with a bunch of playing cards in hand to trade in for more.DRINKS: the draft list is pretty basic, with maybe one or two ""craft"" type beers on the menu. I've occasionally gone for a Blue Moon here, but most of the time it's a canned beer kind of night. With our team, that's basically either Heineken cans or Coors tall boys.AMBIANCE: it's a dive bar. It has a juke box in the back, that is often playing at near ear-shattering levels near the beginning of the evening, but is scaled back as the night wears on. There's also a pool table in the back, which has made for many a fun night.PRICES: again, it's a dive bar. You won't go broke here.In typical Avenue A fashion, DH's does the trick.

The long-time dive bar has withstood the test of time (and whatever bodily fluids and other atrocities might have petrified within its wall over the years). There's a very good jukebox dispensing honky-tonk country and rock and other outlaw classics, with plenty of Johnny Cash. Beers and liquor are cheap. You won't be impressed by the beer selection unless you really miss college beers, but $3 Genny Cream Ale will keep your engine going.If you're 25 and under, this place will be heaven.

40,2,9/15/2017,0,2,"Manhattan, NY",L.M. S.,0,1.0,3,"I work in the industry, and so I never leave negative reviews, but I strongly feel that the following is a public service. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR DEBIT OR CREDIT CARDS. Luckily it wasn't for that much, but it's not the money; it's the principle. And if you spend more than I do, definitely beware. They double charged me after I literally took their receipt out of the drunk bartender's hand so that they would have no receipt copy to enter and then gave them cash and more than 15% tip in cash even though -- frankly -- no one deserved it. This means that even without a receipt, even with a canceled receipt given to me, they still charged my card. The people running the business are either completely dishonest or completely incompetent. If this is happening to multiple people, please post. We should scare them with a lawsuit until they stop doing this to people. That's the short of it. Here's the long of it: The bartender took my card to pay for two drinks, swiped it, then brought it back to my side of the bar. Never ever did she tell me the bar had a $20 minimum for credit card purchases. There are signs, but only posted at the center of the bar, not on the ends where sometimes you have to order b/c it is crowded. I was at a birthday. Had she told me, I probably would have bought shots or just given her cash. Instead, she starts shouting my name and trying multiple times to give my card to this group of guys at my end of the bar. I'm literally waving my arms to get her attention and one of the guys (thankfully he was honest) is literally pointing at me so she will look over at the girl who gave her the card, not the group of men. So, I lean over the wave and literally wave my hand in her face so she can give the card to me instead. She does. I leave a tip and walk away. She calls for me, I come back and then she starts writing in her own new bigger tip (more than a 40% tip) saying, ""I hooked you up last time, but there's a $20 minimum, so I'm just going to bring this up to $20 for you."" I grab the receipt out of her hand, and say, ""no, you are crazy. Crazy. What are you doing?"" She tells me about the signs. I say where. She points to the center of the bar. I ask for a manager. I walk to the center of the bar to see the manager and to read the signs, which are not visible unless you walk over. The manager points to the signs at the center of the bar. I ask him to cancel my card so I can pay in cash. He asks the other woman bartender to do so, which she does and gives me a receipt. I pay in cash and leave a decent tip bc as long as it's canceled, I'm OK at this point, and again I have worked in the industry. I get home, wait a couple of days bc sometimes canceled transactions linger on bank statements, and there it is at the full $20 with the 40%-plus tip. AMAZING. And...illegal.",1

That being said....This was my second time here. I took 3 of my friends here because I remembered it was close and I had a good time at this bar during my previous visit. I like the decor of this place, very divey. Big Buck Hunter for $2.00 and there is pool, too. There are signs behind the bar on proper bar etiquette for customers, I find them hilarious and true (I work in a bar myself). No problems with any of that. Prices are cheap to average I'd say. We showed up after 8:00 pm, so I didn't expect any happy hour, but there were signs for specials, so I'm sure you can make it cheap if you wanted to. Regarding the signs behind the bar, I get it, I have no problems with them. However, the bartender was not that good. Without looking first, my friend ordered 2 Mermaids and 2 Coors Lights, which they don't carry. Bartender said they don't carry Coors Light and that everything she has is ""right here"" on the board. Ok, no problem we should have looked first. However, it wasn't that busy. Look, I get it, is it fun to tell people to read the sign when they don't know what they're doing in a bar? Yes, especially when it's busy and you don't have time to repeat all 15 beers you have, but it wasn't that busy and all you have to say is ""I just have Bud Light."" Anyway, she came back and we added the Buds to the order, but she just rang up my buddy for the 2 Mermaids. So I had to order the 2 Buds separately and pay separately. If you're going to berate someone for not ordering properly, at least don't screw up your side of the order. Anyway, the 2 Mermaids were $7 each and the Bud Lights were $5 a pop. Overall, not too shabby for full price. Yes, people do play country music on the juke. I like country, I'm from Texas, definitely a thumbs up there, but I wouldn't say you have to come here to play country music. I know plenty of other bars where you can play country on the juke without getting weird looks. All in all, a decent place. If I'm in the area, I'll stop in for a few cold ones, but I wouldn't go out of my way. I'm sure if I lived next door or was a regular I'd feel differently, but hey, I'm not and I don't.

From tip to toe the staff were incredibly rude and inconsiderate. Long waits and under poured drinks are par for the course in New York City, and as a NYC resident I can empathize with busy bartenders. However, the glaring music made it almost impossible to talk with friends at this self proclaimed ""anti-manhattan"" watering hole. A self proclaimed place where locals gather to drink and socialize. I saw no locals and had no interest in socializing, especially with the brutish staff.Four days after my visit I realized that I had left my scarf behind. After calling a few times a female staff member finally picked up. I should've known that she would have trouble hearing me but instead of asking me to speak up or removing herself to a quieter place in the bar, she rudely demanded that I speak louder and louder. This went on until I found myself yelling at the top of my lungs. When she finally ""heard"" me she responded  ""Sorry.

The bar wasn't packed, but it was more than she could handle. After our first round I inquired how the happy hour 2 for 1 special worked. She did the math wrong, and I very kindly smiled and corrected her to confirm. Please note, we had plenty of money to spend not that this place needs it, but I just wanted to know for future reference. She told me to stop telling her how to do her job and lost complete composure. She went off on a rant arguing very loudly about this. I have no idea what she was so upset about that day, but I tried aligning with her by telling her I've tended bar and understand what it's like to be overwhelmed and frustrated.

I just didn't enjoy my time there, and actually left within an hour, even though it was someone's going away party.I probably have passed Doc Holliday's quite a few times, and not even looked at this place or I have looked at this place and went, ""Fuck no,"" with the latter being more likely. The outside says DIVE BAR! So if you're not into that kind of stuff, steer clear. I should have.The inside is a mess. It's old. It's grungy. The bartenders are big fat chicks or girls that look like they are trailer trash. Actually both. The night I went, they had $4 Bud Light draft and $3 Labatt Blue 24oz cans. Thats pretty good if you are looking to get wasted, then go somewhere else. However, expect to bring a change of clothes, because they turn the temperature up to 100 degrees in here. I was sweating and the place wasn't THAT crowded, nor was I dancing. It was just insanely hot.Other than that. The people are alright. It seemed like quite a few oldies and normals that come in, especially on a Saturday night around 11:30p.m. I am never going back into Doc Hollidays, and unless you are a female over the age of 40 that has 8 kids and weighs under 100 lbs, then you shouldn't either.",

194,,3/18/2009,0,,"New York, NY",Mary Beth V.,0,4.0,4,"This place is such a classic anchor of the East Village. The smell is enough to turn away the faint hearted, and the beer is cheap enough to keep those that stay happy. Juke box is awesome if, like me, you love Dolly and Merle. If not, you're screwed. Be sure to start off with some shots straight away, that way, you won't notice all the imperfections (read: dirtiness). ninthstreetnyc.com",
195,,7/2/2010,143,1,"Chicago, IL",Mag M.,2,4.0,200,"Boots on the ceiling.  Kind of like pants on the ground. Only not at all.  Not sure why there are boots on the ceiling.  It has something to do with the country theme but basically, Doc's is pretty much a standard EV dive bar, where it's safe to drink out of the glasses but not safe to sit on the toilet seat.  It smells kinda funny but they have cheap beer for cheap (because why pay a buck more for beer that actually tastes good when you can have a pint of PBR?) and Buck Hunter.  The vibe is chill and dive-ily obvious in its unpretentiously.  Fan = me.",
196,,12/8/2010,12,,"Boston, MA",Jennifer N.,0,5.0,8,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Easily one of the best bars in NYC. The crowd is fun and the drinks are strong (not to mention pretty cheap)...plus if you get up and dance on the bar they give you a shot of whiskey. What more could you want?,
197,,9/19/2010,107,,"El Cerrito, CA",Garett N.,0,4.0,542,"I like this bar. Came here during a bit of a bar hopping adventure. It reminds me of something you see in a Tarantino movie. Cheap beers, interesting characters.... recommended.",
198,1,5/1/2010,4,,"Washington, DC",Chris S.,1,4.0,142,Great dive. The atmosphere is authentic. There are plenty of characters during the day. It's cheap. They have a pool table.,
199,,8/31/2010,4,,"Paramus, NJ",Frank C.,0,4.0,38,"Yes sir a dive bar.  When i first walked in I noticed the table on the left with a lot of empty PBR cans and good group of people sitting around playing a drinking game.The music was a perfect blend of Willie, Waylon, Cash, and numerous other southern greats.  They have a pool table and hot friendly bartenders.",
