Updated review",We did some research for great cocktail bars around the area for a friends birthday. We walked in around 7pm and this place did NOT disappoint. The bartender Riley greeted us immediately and was quick and accommodating. So friendly and welcoming. And he made AWESOME drinks. The cocktail menu is great. The food menu accommodates vegetarians. We ordered the ricotta toast without the prosciutto and the meatless sandwich. Both were excellent. We the ordered a sampler platter of pickles and some nachos. Also excellent. Highly recommend and will come back!Update: definitely Riley. I doubled checked the name before I left!,,,
1,Iris P.,"Bronx, NY",109,50,33,2.0,10/19/2018,"Came here with a group of three for a drink and some lunch. We all ordered some food. Brekkie sandwich. Breakfast tacos. Pickled Platter: Bacon & Cabot Deviled Eggs. The sandwich and tacos came with a side of salad or chips. (Take note the chips are literally like lays chips lol-- salad had onions (I'm allergic)) Nowhere on the menu was there a description of what the salad would consist of. The breakfast taco was ok, needed more chorizo because it was lacking in flavor. The deviled eggs: so it was literally 1 egg and a half cut into 3 pieces with a small piece of bacon on top and cheese sprinkled. For 9 dollars I kind of expected more? But that's just me. Anyways the drinks. There was a 2 for 1 special, if you spent over 12 dollars. We ordered a glass of Merlot, a glass of Pinot grigio and a Straphanger. The wine comes in regular glass cups-- no wine glass. Good wine though. The Straphanger was pretty terrible. She never brought the 2nd drink. Then she disappeared. We ended up closing up with someone else. Asthetically it is a nice place but we agreed we probably wouldn't return as the food wasn't anything special and the service wasn't too great.",,,
2,Kerry M.,"New York, NY",115,39,14,4.0,8/24/2018,Came in here before a show at SOB's last night and honestly picked it because of the responses on here from the owner in regards to the shitty reviews.  My bartender was awesome and the food was good. I'd go back,,,1
3,Lo. C.,"New York, NY",302,129,384,3.0,5/16/2018,"Their wings are pretty tasty and the venue is pretty comfortable. My only complaint was when asking for a drink I wanted, the server came back several minutes with another drink because she didn't know a gin fizz required an egg white and that the bar didn't have any...Granted she said I didn't have to take the drink she brought but that would have been a little awkward... So I felt a bit obligated to take the drink I didn't ask for and paid for it too...",2,,1
4,S K.,"San Diego, CA",121,37,1,5.0,9/11/2018,"We ordered the Williamsburg and assorted pickle plate to go after having a few drinks (had to catch a flight).   The bar itself is really well done - I like the low/cozy lighting and design of the spot.  The food was great and the service wonderful.  It was nice to have such a unique vegetarian option on the menu (pastrami style mushroom).  Our pickle selection was okra, green beans, and chipotle carrots - each one was excellent.  We wish we could have ordered more but were worried about what we could get away with while checking in.  I hope we find ourselves back in the area to pay another visit!",,,

8,Nic P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",300,561,269,1.0,7/16/2017,"Here tonight, just stopped in for a cocktail before going to see a show at the Film Forum and was early. I sat at the bar and it was incredibly warm because they had the door and huge window overlooking the street open so it wasn't very comfortable.The vibe is very pub-ish, but without a lot of great beer or wine. The menu was pretty small considering they only handed me a drink menu and didn't have one of the wines listed. I wasn't offered a food menu even though I would have appreciated it because they bartender was clearly phoning it in. Anyway, sitting there and ordered a drink from a not-that-friendly bartender. He seemed preoccupied with his phone, but I just needed one drink so whatever. In the beginning I ordered the 'Bees Knees.' It was supposed to have honey and lemon with Cava champagne over the top of it, but when I drank it all I tasted was champagne. I'm not a huge fan of champagne, but I thought it sounded good with lemon and honey. When I told him I couldn't drink it he asked me if I saw him pour the champagne and I told him I had, but if I wanted a drink that tasted only like champagne I would have ordered just champagne. His attitude sucked, but again, whatever. Got a glass of wine that he sloshed into a jam jar as he walked back to his phone. I drank in peace and then asked for my check, but he ignored me until I had the bar back get him for me. I still tipped him on the more expensive drink even though he didn't deserve it.I won't be coming back here. The atmosphere is terrible and the drinks are seriously subpar. It's Houston, there are a million other bars in walking distance, try those.",2,2,2

11,Samantha C.,"Washington, DC",388,8,0,1.0,8/4/2018,This place is absolutely disgusting. The chips were rocks so we asked for new ones and they gave us rocks again. The guac tasted like chemicals so I had the waiter try it and he gagged. Don't go it's a health hazard.,,,

14,Nikita R.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,3,0,1.0,5/4/2018,"The door guys told me to ""look more awake"" because apparently I looked too tired as I was walking in.

15,Shannon W.,"Paramus, NJ",558,446,811,4.0,12/7/2016,"I recently went here for a private event, and had to rave about the one bartender, Dorian. AMAZING! I'll get to that later. The space is cool, very Brooklyn-esque. It's right next to the subway which is nice (the 1 train). I tried their chicken tacos, their veggie burgers and their soft pretzels which were all tasty snacks. The cheese baked pretzel was really tasty. Food was good, like I said, snack food. Dorian is amazing. I asked him to make me a vodka based drink and he totally crushed a cucumber vodka martini. (I don't know even know the name of the drink, but I had everyone drinking it by the end of the night). Very chill space, super casual, a bit hipster, but I enjoyed myself. They had a pretty legit beer menu too. Would be a great day drinking spot or happy hour!",3,2,5
16,Allana D.,"Brooklyn, NY",325,327,535,4.0,5/6/2016,"Really liked this place.The vibe was upbeat but not overwhelming or too loud. The staff was friendly and attentive and the crowd was chill.I ordered an Empire cream ale (all draughts are from New York State breweries) and it was tasty, followed by a glass of Buffalo Trace (reasonably priced).  We split some tacos which were pretty good and the happy hour deals were great. Next time, I'll try the pickles : )",,,
17,Food E.,"Manhattan, NY",7,563,205,4.0,3/12/2018,This a nice pub though it's quite loud even in the afternoon and the bar seems understaffed (just one bartender). Nice selection on tap. I liked the cider. The baked pretzels are really good!,,,
18,Adrian A.,"Brick, NJ",0,3,2,5.0,8/7/2018,"Went to this spot on Saturday 8/4 in a large group after my younger brother's wedding at City Winery down the street.  We arrived around 11:30pm, walked in without a hassle or a wait.  The place was pretty packed, not to where you couldn't move but it was a nice size crowd.  Ordered a bunch of drinks throughout a 2 hour period, never had to wait more than a few seconds, and the service was incredibly friendly and polite.  They were actually nice people.  Often times when places like this are packed, service is compromised.  I don't remember their names but the bar tenders were awesome; even when they seemed to be in the weeds they were so cool with everyone.  At the end of the night when I got my bill, I was pleasantly surprised with how well-priced their drinks were (I bought everyone and their mother drinks), but the bill wasn't bad at all!  Will definitely be back, and all things considered, its best bar I've been to in the area (Even though there was no sign of CGJ, but I digress).  This place gets it, and they do it right.  Thanks!!",,,
19,Patrice N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,12,0,1.0,7/17/2018,"I've been eating there for years and have always recommended it to everyone because of the fantastic food. I hadn't eaten there for a few months, but within the last couple weeks I've eaten there almost daily due to visiting co-workers and the location. The food has gone from a 10 to a 1. It's as if the chef has been told to slash the budget. Very little food on the plate compared to before, and even some missing ingredients which leaves the food bland. I resent paying $14 for bread, lettuce, tomato, and what isn't much more than one slice of meat. There is such a huge difference in the food - do they think regular customers aren't going to notice? I won't be returning to The Brooklyneer and I would love all my money back, because I feel scammed.",,,
20,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,9/18/2015,"Been here a couple times now for lunch and have been impressed by their specials available. Big space that's never crowded (in the afternoon) for a nice quiet meal.Monday-Friday they have a 2 for 1 beer special with any sandwich during lunch hours. First time I got the Williamsburg sandwich ($11) - sauteed mushrooms and other veggies with evenly toasted bread. Second time I got the ham and cheese sandwich ($9) - standard ham with apple slices and strong cheese inside buttery toasted bread. Drafts are $7 each, a standard selection that doesn't really change but a good variety.Service is fast given that there isn't many clientele. Not sure how it is after work hours, though I think I'll stick to the lunch deal.",,,
21,Alysha R.,"Manhattan, NY",178,25,26,5.0,7/21/2017,"I have never had a bad time here. Not a big beer place- go next door if you're looking for beers.

22,Kimberly L.,"San Francisco, CA",804,840,797,2.0,2/3/2016,"Came to this bar for a birthday party and I truly don't understand how it's popular? The DJ was horrible.  The ""music"" he was playing literally sounded like his equipment was malfunctioning and it was just scratching noises with beats.  Terrible beats at that.  The whole vibe was odd.  Way too crowded to move.  Not joking it was worse than being stuck on the 6 train during rush hour.  Drinks were not special.  I ordered a vodka soda and it was very watered down but served in a slim glass with a slice of lime.  I might have enjoyed myself more if I couldn't hear the music and was blacked out drunk.  However, I stayed classy and decided to just leave the bar, one less person to elbow your way to the back, you're welcome.  Sad that Brooklyn is even in the name...",3,2,2
23,Mikey M.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,5/22/2018,I would give them 0 stars if I could. A group of friends went here after going out to dinner and the female bartender was the nastiest/worst bartender i have ever met in nyc. i will definitely NOT recommend this bar to anyone going forward,,,

If you happen to be in the area do yourself a favor and walk past the nauseating douchebag headquarters that is the Houston Hall and pop into this warm, non pretentious spot.

25,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1508,175,4.0,12/27/2015,Stopped in about 11:30 on a Saturday morning.  Place is not all that big - maybe 14 seats at the bar.  Seats are set wide apart for a change - any other bar would have twice the seats.  Booths further back.  Background music was an iTunes playlist - 80's pop; so this will change from shift to shift.Bartender was young but made a good cocktail.  I had a Lairds applejack old-fashioned which was fine and a decent size pour for $13.00.Great place to stop before an event at Houston Hall which is on the same block.,,,

27,Rich C.,"Avon-by-the-Sea, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,9/23/2017,"Every glass of wine they served had disgusting lipstick marks. When we asked for a new glass the bartender provided a ""new"" glass that was even worse. When asked again she replied that the alcohol kills the germs.. absolutely disgraceful and disgusting! The nachos were stale and to make matters worse they added an automatic gratuity of 20% to the check for a group of 4. I'm never one to short change anyone.. I understand that everyone is trying to do their best but after being completely rude and inconsiderate I found it insulting. Avoid this place at all costs.. their glasses resemble something you'd find on a table after girls night in a Boca retirement home. Essentially I have nothing positive to share aside from the fact I had great company!",2,1,1

Updated review","Went on Saturday night to meet a friend for drinks.   It appears that this is like a college bar.  Totally fine...I was okay with all of that BUT the DJ...oh em gee.  He was horrible.  Beyond horrible.  He tried to fade songs in and out of one another or mix them but it all ended up being chopping and super skippy.  It was so bad.  They needed to put on iHeartRadio, it would have been way better.  The drinks were inexpensive...and the place is still nice.  The staff, although bombarded with the crowd were really sweet.  Very low key place where you could go in flip flops and a tshirt.",2,,
29,Danielle F.,"Santa Monica, CA",3028,714,6,4.0,6/3/2015,Small bar that's darkly lit fosters a nice mix of people depending on the night. I loved the vibe and the live dDJ. The bar wasn't too crowded which made it easy to talk and get drinks. Great little dive bar!,8,4,9
30,Natasha K.,"New York, NY",13,43,15,4.0,12/19/2016,"I can only speak to its bar vibe, as I have not eaten there. I have often funneled this way when Houston Hall is too crazy.The ambience is mellow, the decor is cozy, the large windows at the front afford people watching, and the staff are friendly (when it's not too busy). With that said: The drinks aren't cheap, but it's a West Village spot so that's unsurprising. They could also be a little more inventive with the music.",,,
31,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,3.0,6/29/2015,"Average. That is the word I would use to describe this bar. They have all the things you look for in a bar. Alcohol, wings, pretzels, and, a bar. But of those things, none are anything better than ordinary. I've been here a couple of times and my reaction is always, meh... The alcohol selection is very basic (especially the rum and wine), and as mentioned, so are the food options. Last time I was here, I snacked on some pretzels and nachos. The pretzels were fine, but the nachos were covered in lettuce and overall just seemed thrown together without much effort. The main draw of this place is its never crowded and is good for small groups. There is a section in the back with a long table and seating that serves this purpose well. Having sat in this reserved section a few times, I can say that it's the perfect place to house a group while getting very attentive service.I can't say much else here other than this place does its job by providing alcohol and small bites. There's nothing bad to say here, but there isn't anything good to say either. My opinion is there are plenty other bars to frequent in the area that have much more to offer.",1,,2

I walked in holding a cake and the manager immediately asked if we wanted them to put it in the fridge, and if we wanted a bigger section for a party.

The atmosphere is causal, the feeling is that everyone wants to relax on a Saturday with friends and not get too wild. It is a great alternative to the popular Houston Hall next door.It was pretty crowded, but we had made a reservation so had no issues finding seating across from the bar. Definitely make a reservation if you're coming with a big group of people! The drink prices were reasonable, and the bartenders are friendly. Seemed to get less crowded as the night went on, we stayed from about 5:30-10. We didn't order much food, but the bbq sliders caught my eye and I will be ordering them on my next visit to The Brooklyneer!",1,1,1
39,Phil W.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,14,13,3.0,12/25/2015,"Yo, so remember that bar I was telling you about in my Upland review? Brooklyneer aka 'Neer. Well, it was my bud's bday. I hadn't been to 'Neer since I'd brought that babe. Remember the one who led me to the photo booth where we made out and some dude tried to sneak a peek. Man I really hated that dude. It's like bro, this is my babe. I worked hard to get her. She's not with you because you are a wussy. Ughh, sorry, guys who can't mind their own make me so POed. Anyway, I roll up to 'Neer solo-dolo. No babes tonight. It was a Saturday, and I knew 'Neer would be off the chain. Everyone was already inside. They'd surrounded a table in the back. Thank god we had a home base. My friends do know how to do it right when it comes to parties. We all went to school in Miami305 that's how you know it's good.I'd never seen it this crowded. You literally couldn't walk anywhere but the bouncer kept letting people in! I must have rubbed up on 34 butts and got 23 boobs in my face. I didn't ask for that. It just happened! #noregrets! You couldn't walk forward until someone came out. So I posted up at the bar. Wait out the crowd, I told myself. Took down a few 'quila shots by myself, then I notice the bday boy sneakin' off for a cig. ""When you get back, shots bro!"" said I. Take note. That's what you say when it's your bud's bday and you are trying to get real loose real fast.He gets back. We do two shots each because it's the freakin' weekend baby. I'm about to have me some fun.We brave the crowd. Barrel through. We get to the table. I say what's up to all my friends, and then I say hi to Cuba Gooding, Jr. Yes, that's right, CGJ was chillin hard! WTF!? CGJ? He has an Academy Award! He did Snow Dogs! He knew Tommy C. before he was a total mashug. I turn to my bud. I'm like, ""Yo, good looks on inviting Cuba. Good to see him out. Haven't seen him since Losing Isaiah!"" CGJ was posted up on the wall with his buddy looking real banged up. What do you expect tho? It was like 2AM at 'Neer!""Yo CGJ! Pretty pumped for that Lifetime OJ Sampson movie you are doing! Looks tight!"" I turn to my bud and go, ""Looks like hot garbage.""Meanwhile, I get a text from my other bud:""yo bro be in soon. mad line at 'Neer""Da fuq! A line at 'Neer??? Oh man! People must have heard about CGJ! At least we're cool with him, and he'll want to keep partying with us. Was eyeing our babes the whole night! What a boss. I knew CGJ was all about the babes! ""What a night! To be at 'Neer!"" I started chanting this to the song of Drake/Future's ""What a time to be alive!"" No one was chanting. Who cares?! DJ Babyblue the trans DJ was spinning, and we were feeling right.Finally my whole crew rolls through, and I'm like fuq it. Let's get banged up. I'm calling out people who bump into me left and right. Telling them, ""Chill, you're banged up."" One chick had the nerve to tell me I was banged up! That's my line! I remember holding court on top of the table like we were in some club. I was doing this thing with my hand that I always do that signals I'm vibing to the beat. It looks cool. I saw it all the time on YO! MTV Raps. Next thing I know some fools spill a drink on us. I'm hitting on some babe with bombs. CGJ is creepin' real hard on the girls we are with. DJ Babyblu is flexin' and spinnin.The night was a blur. I got so bombed. I woke up the next morning and thought I'd partied all night in Brooklyn. Nope. It was just 'Neer. I was in this babe's apartment. Full nakes. Tripoding. She turns over and the rest of the details are not for you. Get your own life!So yes, I had a blast at 'Neer, but true talk for a sec. It's so basic. It's the basic B of bars. You know what else is basic? Wedding DJs, Melissa's Cupcakes, EDM, not just EDM but thinking you are the only one who likes EDM, Soul Cycle, the name Ashley, brunch, Megan Trainor, sliders, Lululemon & Chop't.I mean sure there's DJ Babyblu the trans DJ. Sure the bartenders have BOMBS. Sure CGJ chills there...HARD. And sure, I got so bombed, but there's nothing that sets it apart from other bars. The beer selection basic. Cocktails? I don't know if they have them, but if they do, I'm sure they are basic. And it's named Brooklyneer, and it's in Manhattan! Brooklyneer is like that chick at a party who has no personality and has zero to say but you keep talking to her because she's the hottest babe at the party. And it's Manhattan prices at a place that wants to be in Brooklyn!It's so middle of the road. It's so forgettable. I did give it three stars cuz if a bar can get you bombed then it's fine by me. So 'Neer, you'll forever be an anomaly to me. How so many people can love something so basic is cray.",5,5,3

When we were trying to order, we couldn't hear over the glaring music so it was a bit difficult to communicate our order, understandably. Instead of being patient and helping us out, she started becoming very sarcastic with us and used exaggerated hand movements, as if we were idiots (our group included a surgeon, an internal medicine doctor, and a lawyer so I assure you, bartender, if you ever read this, this wasn't the case). Extremely inhospitable and disgustingly rude... who the hell belittles and talks down to customers? Disgusting. Will never ever come here again.",1,1,1

My answer has always been ""the only time I would not leave a tip is if I felt the server did something intentionally rude, but that has never happened before."" Well friends, it happened here on Saturday night. I was in town visiting for my friend from high school's wedding when we decided to move the reception to this bar after Houston Hall. It was very busy and loud understandably for Saturday night around midnight. I stood at the bar for several minutes while the female bartender intentionally ignored me. I really wasn't even upset at this point because hey I get it you're really busy and have a lot of other customers that need assistance as well. After a few more minutes I started to get antsy and wanted a drink so I moved a little bit closer to the bar with my credit card out. Apparently this was the most egregious thing I could have done because the bartender immediately looked up at me, put her hand IN MY FACE and said ""yeah I see you!"" You guys, I was so shocked I didn't even have a response so I continued to stand, and stand, and stand, until she felt like serving me.

43,Chey H.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,561,120,4.0,1/7/2013,"Even thought I live in Brooklyn and can get the same experience over here, I really enjoy The Brooklyneer. I've visited twice--once for a co-workers birthday on a weekday and once on a random Sunday afternoon. The bar was crowded the first time I went but tables had been reserved for the party. We ordered directly from the waitress who came by our table, so I didn't interact with anyone behind the bar. She was sweet and the food was great--I had the chicken tacos which were really juicy (I still think about them sometimes......). We stayed pretty late and saw the place start to empty out.On my second visit my man-friend and I had been out in Soho and wanted to get a bite to eat away from the crowds. I remembered this place being a decent walk away and we stopped by. They were still serving brunch and the place was pretty much empty. The server/waitress was a bit sassy but not off-putting--I found her pretty funny. I had the breakfast sliders which were the perfect comfort food. This place also gets points from me for having Brooklyn Weiss on tab (more BK bars should follow suit!) Overall I think this place has a good vibe and good food, so I'll leave Brooklyn to come hang out here.",,,
44,Jessica B.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,4,0,4.0,5/26/2016,"Went here recently for the first time (despite rolling my eyes at the name) and was really pleased with the service and food. Would definitely go back! We weren't in the mood for drinks, so we got an appetizer and sandwiches for dinner. The ricotta toasts were delicious, and my Portobello (""Williamsburg"") sandwich was very flavorful. Sometimes vegetarian sandwiches are disappointing, especially at bars/places that don't specialize in vegetarian food, but the Portobello sandwich was a winner that I'd definitely order again. The service was super attentive but not overbearing. Nice atmosphere too, dimly lit and not tooo loud (though not quiet). The downside is the drink prices- cocktails are all $13, and there are no wines under $9/glass. But that's pretty typical for Manhattan.",,,

The whisky sour pickles, which were good (not great), the fennel beats , which tasted like pickled beats and no fennel taste, and the Guacamole deviled eggs that were very tasty.

My main complaint is service-related. They would take forever, and whenever I would stand by the entrance of the bar to catch their attention (after waiting about 20 min for a drink even though I was at the bar), they would tell me to move and I would still not get any service. It literally (not exaggerating) took them 30 min to get my check only to get overcharged (My whole group did). When I complained, she told me I was wrong. When we all complained, she called me a motherf#$%er. Eventually she apologized and ""fixed"" the charge. Days later I see the charge was not fixed and that I actually got charged twice. I understand the bar was a bit busy, but that is not an excuse to treat a paying customer like that. Going to try to call the manager to see if they can refund the charge. Wish me luck!",2,1,1

I've been here several times and no joke, every time someone mentions Brooklyneer, I still can't remember a single thing about it. Very mundane.Beer selection is fine, but nothing special. Bartenders are friendly, and it's usually not too crowded, which is nice. But I just can't say much more about it because there's really not much going on.

Really dug the neighborhood-friendly, slightly rustic, hipster vibe here, although it did begin to get uncomfortably crowded with finance dudes as we left. Bartenders were very attentive, friendly and efficient, which is how it should be.  Music was good, playing at a comfortable, as we were still able to have a conversation without shouting.The happy hour deals here are standard, and the beer selection here was pretty good and it was cool that everything on draft was brewed locally. We only stuck to the wine and the beer, but the cocktails looked like they were pretty well done. We felt pretty comfortable at the bar, and had only planned to get one drink, but we ended up staying for a few more. That's how you know you're having a good time.Would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area. The food menu is definitely intriguing with some unique dishes, so I'll have to come back to try the pub fare as well. Given that it's right next to Houston Hall, the Brooklyneer is definitely a good alternative to the huge beer hall scene (and long lines).",,,

There's even a [manager or owner?] sporting a serious mid-aughts hipster beard to lend street cred to the prime conceit.But beyond the ""Brooklyn"" schtick , the Brooklyneer is just an all-around solid bar. Or maybe it is on Mother's Day Sunday afternoons, like the one when I popped in to nurse a post MD brunch hangover with some hair of the dog boozing. It was a mid-afternoon lull between brunch and dinner when even Manhattanites takea break from group drinking, which made for a pleasantly laid-back experience. On tap where several Brooklyn Brewery libations, with a smattering of wheat beers and summer ales well geared to the season. I tried an Empire Cream Ale, which was smooth and not too filling despite the name. We briefly perused the attractive and affordable brunch menu, contemplated a second brunch in one day (what's the record?) and ultimately decided to move to A.O.C. Bistro for a more robust selection of foodstuffs. But they did offer us a $35 all-you-drink boozy brunch.

The food is also a great as much of it is a healthful variation on typical bar fare, and allows one to get something substantial in them before they start the night. My favorite meal before I tie one on is ""The Williamsburg"" (a hearty mushroom sandwich with a salad on the side.)I have had countless wonderful times here and have made many new friends within its walls, and look forward to many more memories in the future... especially considering the fact that I work right around the corner!

Updated review","I'm still mad at the Brooklyneer from last time around...unfriendly, cold service and obnoxious removal of chairs right from under our behinds.  BUT...It retains two stars, and does not suffer a downgrade, after a visit yesterday. Why? Not because the service improved, but because they have KICK ASS PICKLES.  The whiskey sour pickles and the chipotle carrots were awesomely delicious. The bread and butter pickles were good too, but not close to the others. But it's $9 for three very, very small portions of pickles. Crazy pricey.  SO...What has this all confirmed? I don't like this bar. It's snobby and expensive. But I do like Brooklyn Brine's pickles and carrots...So I'll make a trip there next time instead.",2,,

Honestly, I am really impressed by the quality of this place when it comes to their ingredients, staff, and specials!My personal favorite is the Cubano. What a sandwich... Never stop serving it. I also happened by the Brooklyneer this past Saturday evening after getting dinner in the area just to see what it was like at night. I liked the lit candles and the dimmed lighting with friendly drink prices and (as always) very awesome people working the bar and door. To the owner: I salute you. To the staff: I appreciate you.

A mouse running from one end of the restaurant to the other, (which, as luck would have it, is right underneath our table). We came for brunch and were so pleased ... awesome waitress, delicious food (Brian had the breakfast sandwich, my son had a huge plate of waffles and I have the vegetarian breakfast tacos). We both got carafes of libations that came with our meal ... bloody mary for him, mimosa for me - so big that we couldn't finish them! And just as my husband was about to turn to me and suggest we return sometime soon, at that moment the little critter made his entrance. The waitress was embarrased and said that nothing like that had ever happened before. She apologized profusely, too. I realize that some things are entirely out of a business's control, like construction happening right outside of your establishment, which often leads to an increase in vermin sightings. We've been to the Brooklyneer several times for drinks and have always had a wonderful experience. It was just disheartening to have this occur at the end of our most recent visit (which would have otherwise been a 4-star experience)",3,1,

A dark and stormy (or Brooklyneer's Navy Yard) would be most fitting for this ""flood watch"" summer evening, but I opted to try their Brooklyn Buck...made with Owney's New York City Rum, fresh lime juice, and Q ginger ale. Top it off with some fresh mint in a copper mug and you have an immediate remedy for frizzy hair and summer subway sweat.Though the cocktails run you $12 a pop, having just one is impossible (I ended up having two consecutive Bucks, FYI) and boy are they refreshing.Overall this joint has a very attentive staff, good tunes, great atmosphere, and refreshing adult beverages.And that's all I have to say about that.",1,1,

Not super spicy, but great anyway: as tasty as a Rick's Cabaret stripper... and as juicy!The place loses half a star because of the awful acoustics.

The bartender working that day was also so nice - she treated my fiancé and I each to a beer on the house (so sweet!) and when our guests needed refills she was very prompt in refilling the beer.Overall it was such an easy, effortless experience, and I would highly recommend this place for any kind of private event. Also, the food/snacks were all delicious! We had the kimchee hot dogs, grilled cheese, and bruschetta.Thanks, Brooklyneer!",,,
94,Scott H.,"San Francisco, CA",62,531,64,5.0,11/19/2010,"Welcome to the Brooklyneer!  Kind of how I love Summit Bar in the East Village, there is something cool about the owners of a bar being present and interested in their product, and personally striving to bring people a fun and unique experience.  That is the feeling I get at this place.I do have to question the two naysayers.  While negative reviews are to be expected anywhere and fine, and constructive criticism is always good, these two have 1 review each.  Take it from the people who have lived the city!  But I digress.  This is the type of place you just want to slip into.  Like a bathrobe or something.  Its cozy and warm - with salvaged wood bar, old wood beams that were from a farm somewhere or something like that (beautiful!  but my facts might be off).  The beer assortment is alluring, the cocktails are spot on.  I saw the menu and can't wait to try the tastiness.  And look closely at the wallpaper.  And have fun in the photobooth in the back.  I love cool new neighborhood places with interactive owners.  I think this place has a bright future.",4,1,2

On Friday and Saturday nights, the bar gets packed after 8-9pm, so you have to get there early to get a table. The photobooth in the back is a lot of fun, the tapas are yummy, and the pours are plentiful. I also like coming here during a Sunday afternoon to have a relaxing beer with a friend after walking around the city all day. All in all, a great establishment.",,,

I've been a few times and recently dealt with the same d-bag others are complaining about. I talked to the owner about it and was told they were giving the employee a chance to turn it around but that never happened so they made some changes. Seems all good now and the staff are friendly like when I went back when they first opened. As for the food, I just love that they're taking a risk in this economy to give me something new. It's experimental and fun, take a risk and push yourself to try new things!As for prices, they are average Manhattan prices in my opinion, can't figure out why people are complaining about an average priced appetizer. Go here if you want to be pushed to try cool new things that you'd have to travel to 50 different paces to get all at once. If you prefer Micky D's as your ""restaurant"" of choice, this may not be the place for you.

Updated review","Update:  The owner clearly doesn't know how to deal with a negative review nor an unhappy customer.  Actually that did happen, the bar smelled sewage coming from the bathroom. And telling the bartender you're going outside to have a smoke after he puts a new beer in front of you and your lady friend then coming back to drink beer, the drinks are  gone, you ask for your beer back and he wants to charge you for 2 new drinks. If ""the bartender pulled his drink because clearly he had had enough"" why did he give me 2 more beers then try to charge me for them? No reason to visit this bar, especially when you can go to Brooklyn instead of a wanna-be bar that's best quality is that it's near the Holland Tunnel.  And if you can't make it to Brooklyn, visit any number of better bars in the neighborhood.  Hell, go to King Wok for a beer over this place  so your money doesn't go to the douche a-hole of an owner that has 0 idea how to run a bar or treat locals.

It was a Friday night and pretty late but the crowd was good. Oh, and we could actually talk. The music as at the perfect level. We got some drinks. And they gave generous pours of Bourbon. Oh, and get their hot dogs. $6 each and TOTALLY worth it. Quality by friend, quality. It came with a high quality pickle that probably was hand picked from an farmer with free flowing hair that breezed in the wind and they had cheese that probably came from a golden cow.

Updated review","NEW UPDATE:Received message from Owner again because I told him (in response to his comment below) that the place closing is the only way I'd go back. Thought I'd share it here:""I'll send you a personal invitation when we are going out of business. You can come down and pop a bottle of champagne and share it with no one. Seriously though, you are wasting your time blasting us on here. Since you have only one review (well two of the same place) Yelp will filter it off, as they already did with your first review. Because they look at reviews that start out with ""The reason I even opened a Yelp account was to complain about so and so..."" They look at those kinds of reviews as extremely biased, which they are. So feel free to say whatever. It will be read by no one.Regarding the horrible service, I'm sure you are right. Some of my staff isn't great. I'm trying to hire good people but it's not always easy. You're wrong about the good though: it's quite good. Maybe you came in on an off day but I'll take the Pepsi challenge with any crummy deli any day of the week. You said our stuff was worse than deli food, which is why I mention that. It's really not. Food is all organic when possible and prepared very well. So I respectfully disagree. But you smearing our name makes me sad. You don't want to make a grown man cry do you? :( Let's be pals! For real pals. And if you change your review to even three stars I will buy you a giant glass of your favorite pilsner here and we can hang out and watch football together. It'll be like old times. Consider the offer.""ORIGINAL UPDATE:Went back again after reading a few of the owner's intense responses to other reviews and after he responded to my review via private message to find out which staff member I had mentioned in my original review so that he could, presumably, punish them.I feel comfortable saying that this was my worst visit yet. This place is still awful and I hope it closes soon. It isn't a bar or restaurant, it's just where people who can't be bothered stand around unhelpfully.Please don't go here. Go literally anywhere else.",1,4,

105,Ryan G.,"Hilton, NY",4,96,8,2.0,5/17/2012,"The neighborhood needed a good bar, and unfortunately this is not it. The bar is designed nicely, cool wood, great location, and nice selection of beer. The major issue (as the name implies) is that they brought Williamsburg to Manhattan. With it they brought their hipster attitude which equates to rude bartenders and slow service. If your too cool too work at bar, then don't- and if you are working at a bar you are not an artist or actor so focus on your job THE CUSTOMERS!",4,4,

108,Hector H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,6/12/2015,"We had our after wedding late night at the Brooklyneer.... And it was amazing.  Note; this review is more about hosting your event there.First, we scoped the bar out before, and it seemed like a great spot to grab a drink - chill vibe, cool decor, a place I could out after work and nurse a beer.We then met Aron, one of the owners.  He was awesome to work with - gave us multiple options at various price points, and was never pushy.  We felt so confident we actually agreed to hold our pre-wedding drinks at their sister bar, The Folly (equally 5 star).  Night of... Oh boy.  It was a dance party - the perfect continuation of our wedding.  They held a space for us in the back even though the bar was packed, and the party took off!  Bar staff made sure our party had drinks... And what can I say about the DJ.  This guy was from planet amazing.Overall, highly encourage you to work with the Brooklyneer staff to host your event.  Professional, transparent, follow through on their word. No up selling or shenanigans.  And as for the bar itself, granted I was on a wedding high,  but I had the time of my life there",,,

We purchased a Living Social deal and I realized 3 hours before we were supposed to meet that we needed a reservation. I emailed the owner Aron and within minutes he replied and told me it was no problem, we didn't need a reservation and we could use the voucher whether we sat at the bar or at a table. We had a great bartender, I'm sure I'm going to spell it wrong, his name is Andres. Even when he was busy, he made eye contact and let us know he would be with us as soon as he could, we never waited long for a drink. There were 2 very helpful women working that were very nice, and another guy working behind the bar that was also great. Now the food, the Cubano sandwich is so delicious!  The pork is seasoned well and very tender, as I bit into the sandwich I could taste all of the ingredients.  We also got the Whiskey Sour pickles, so good, the Fennel Beets, actually made me like beets, and the deviled eggs. The food was great, the $6 glasses of wine during happy hour is a great deal, and the pickle back shots were so good, they use their own pickle juice! We had a great time, we will definitely be going back again. I really wanted to thank Aron and all of the staff, they were all so helpful and nice, it made our girls night out so much better. Seriously, try the food when you are there!",1,,

Basic pub set up, good beer selection and friendly staff.We shared some nibbles in addition to the drinks....the caramel bacon popcorn was very good as well as the cheese platter with bread, apples and dates. We also shared a jalapeño soft pretzel which was ok but not great and the potatoes which were a plate of boiled potatoes with dipping sauce which we could have skipped.Prices are very reasonable and overall great little pub for a relaxed gathering",,,

It's a Manhattan bar with a Brooklyn theme. Now some people may say this place isn't Brooklyn, it's a wanna be, well I say get over yourself, you take yourself too seriously. I enjoyed it here. I'm not big on beer but I tried a kind from the Brooklyn brewery that you drink like champagne and it was very tasty. I also ordered two different hot dogs; the brooklyneer and the brunswick. The brunswick had cheese and onions and the brooklyneer had mustard, ketchup, and relish. They were both so very good but I enjoyed the Brunswick better. The staff was also very friendly and not stuck up, at least that wasn't the vibe I got that. So I will stop by again when in the area.",,,

When we sat at the  Coney Island Boardwalk-planked bar, the extremely friendly and helfpul bartendress greeted us with menus and took our drink order almost immediately. Good pours overall and a decent happy hour. Their specialty drinks all seemed to have fine touches, but my favorite was the toasted coriander and salt rim on the tequila-based cocktail I ordered. That was really rockin.We ordered the Nachos for Two with braised chicken, which is plen-ty for two. And the braised chicken was sick! I don't know what they did to get such luscious flavor happening, but I hope they never stop. So savory.I live in Brooklyn and would actually rather come here, than schlep all over the borough hunting down the singular Brooklyn-made goodies they've sourced all in one place.

Only once have I seen him get forceful and not violent. He greets you at the door like an old friend and welcomes you into the welcoming and warm interior of this establishment. The interior is beautiful and well laid out. Depending on the night, it's spacious and one of my favorite places to be in the West Village and by far the last nice stop before heading into TrBeCa. Their selection of beers, fantastic, wine, not too shabby and cocktails, well, I think they need a little more love. The food can be hit or miss and even if it's late night, if you're open, keep the standards up. Try the Patatas Arrugadas. They will blow your mind.",2,,

I walked in thinking ""okay: impress me"" -- and it did...Their specialty cocktail menu alone is a feast for the eyes and tastebuds. Should we try this one with Brooklyn Vodka and lavender-lemon syrup, or perhaps this other one with Dorothy Parker Gin?  We tried a couple, but the winner was The Kings County--rye whiskey, Luxardo, vermouth, and delicious little brandied cherries that made you dig your fingers into the glass to retrieve and consume them.Their bar menu is unique (and yummy). Not the usual list of fried crap, but a selection of pickles. Deviled eggs. Paté. And--ohmigod--bacon caramel popcorn. Yes, it's as good as it sounds.Service was good. Staff was friendly.  If only there wasnt an EXTREMELY LOUD drunk woman at the bar 5 feet from me, it wouldve been perfect.

118,Roberto A.,"New York, NY",55,283,1,4.0,2/16/2012,"So yous is from Brooklyn but your friend don't want to leave Manhattan? The Brooklyneer's gimmick is that it labels everything with a name relating to Brooklyn, and supposedly imported the ceiling wood from Brooklyn, uses liquors and beers from Brooklyn, etc.That gimmick is a little iffy, but the place itself is nice. I really like the decor, especially certain funky touches. Check out the tin ceiling lined walls in the bathrooms. Fancy! The soap bottle is a little annoying, since you have to pick it up to pour soap, it means that every person with dirty hands has touched it.I had the carnitas tacos - they were great. I did not really like the 3 specialty cocktails I tried - they cost $12 each I think. The beer selection is good though, so I stuck to that.They also offer other food like hot dogs, pretzels, and even Robicelli's cupcakes (I had one - yum!).Definitely a solid bar, but I think they could improve on their signature drinks. Service was a little spotty - sometimes we were brought the wrong drinks and sometimes nobody came to us to take our orders for more drinks.There is a photo booth in the back, which is cool, but I think it's $5 for 3 pics...eh.They did play Banquet by Bloc Party while we were there, so major props for that.",2,,1

They have Black Ops, which, if you know Brooklyn Brewery, is damn near impossible to find. My dad has been on the hunt for this beer for months and was pleasantly surprised to find it on the Brooklyneer menu. It's delicious. You have to try it.

I know for some, it's hard to get.  We take it for granted because most of the time it's easy to attain wood, but sometimes...you require some hand holding by a special someone to get wood.There is A LOT of wood here at the Brooklyneer. You're literally surrounded by it every which way you look. Don't be bashful and ask the owner where he got his wood.They have a nice assortment of Brooklyn beers, snacks and food. It was pretty empty on a Wednesday night and a strange man came up to my friend and asked her to buy a drink for his lady friend that he was chatting with.

135,Evan H.,"New York, NY",314,781,44,4.0,11/17/2010,"Last night I was fortunate enough to get invited to an open house grand opening at a new bar in the west village of Manhattan, The Brooklyneer, by Nearsay. The inside of the Brooklyneer is cozy, warm and has a vibe that almost has feeling like you are in Brooklyn.  The ceiling is covered with planks of wood, as are the booths, tables and bar, giving it a nice rustic feel.  You'll find a vintage photo booth in the back, along with a bathtub basin which acts as the sink for the bathrooms.  The details that adorn the Brooklyneer give you a feeling of nostalgia.The Brooklyneer offers twelve Brooklyn beers on tap, including their house beer (The Brooklyneer), which goes down easy and is only $4 (yes, you heard me right).  In addition to those, another 15 or so are available in bottles, plus some deliciously crafted cocktails, including an Apple Jack Old Fashion, which packs a punch, and well, doesn't really taste like apples (that will set you back $11).Now, the Brooklyneer is a gastropub, so you're wondering about the food.  The grub here starts with some simple snacks like bacon and caramel popcorn and roasted peanuts, both from local Brooklyn vendors.  You can grab a salt boiled potato with chive and sour cream aoli, or stick a took pick into one of 9 pickled veggies in a mix and match vegetable platter.  Go for the kimchi.If you are feeling even more hungry after your 3rd brooklyn pennant ale, you can snag one of three different sliders, or a beef and pork meatball sandwich.  The meats and other featured dishes all contain meats and other ingredients straight from Brooklyn.The Brooklyneer is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Whether you are just getting of of a movie at the Film Forum (across the street) or just need a cold brew on a Friday night, this is the place to take a load off, order some sliders and let the good times roll.",5,1,1

The good: not crowded for lunch--the place is mostly an evening bar scene--mostly empty, actually, and the food is quite good. The bad: after having a BLT with a side salad and a glass of wine for lunch, I asked for coffee. ""Milk and sugar?"" the waitperson asked. ""Just milk,"" I replied. She brought the coffee and said, ""Oh sorry--we don't have any milk."" I asked if they had any cream. ""No,"" she replied.  I told her to take the coffee away, I don't want it black. And I wondered why since the place was nearly empty except for a few bar patrons, and I was literally the only person eating lunch there, they could not send someone out to the corner to get some milk from a deli. Really annoyed me, and I will be looking for a new place to eat lunch every day. I know nobody cares because, duh, it's a bar and it's about the beer, etc, but I found this really, really annoying.",,,

Updated review","I think this is a good solid choice if you are in the area.  there are lots of beers on tap, and it was far away enough from the halloween parade to avoid the mayhem!",,,
139,Barry H.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,2,0,5.0,6/13/2011,"To me, The Brooklyneer isn't a ""Brooklyn bar"", but rather a Manhattan bar that curates the best of what Brooklyn has to offer.I've been to The Brooklyneer for two different birthday parties and on one other occasion for drinks with a friend, and all have been great.For the last birthday party we had reserved the back section, which I would definitely do again. We had plenty of space for our group and our waitress was outstanding. She was very sweet, quick, and always seemed to be around when we needed her.I'm surprised I haven't read more reviews about the food! This is my favorite part of The Brooklyneer! The Greenpoint Sandwich (steve's kielbasa, pickle guys sauerkraut, swiss cheese, spicy russian dressing on black bread) is among my favorite sandwiches in the world! It's like a Reuben, but with sliced kielbasa, YUM! The pulled pork sliders were delicious, and so was the hot dog (with beef from Mile End). I'm excited to try some more stuff next time.GET THE BACON CARAMEL POPCORN, you won't regret it. The selection of beers from Brooklyn is good, but nothing amazing. I'd love to see them carry a Brooklyn Brewery Special Reserve on tap.The prices are fine, I didn't balk at our bill on any of my trips there. You're obviously not going to get real Brooklyn prices in Manhattan, especially with the high cost of importing everything ALL THE WAY FROM BROOKLYN!My only gripe about The Brooklyneer would be that it can get crowded, but that's why I try not to go on busy times.If you stop trying to think of this as a ""Brooklyn bar"" or a ""Brooklyn wannabe"" or whatever, you'll realize that it's just an awesome bar, with awesome stuff, from an awesome borough.",1,,
140,Megan C.,"Rockaway Park, Queens, NY",131,178,38,5.0,11/19/2010,"Okay first off - this place has been open a week and a half. Give it a break. You're not cool just because you can be snarky. And yes if you live in manhattan sometimes you are a lazy bum who doesn't L it over and get yourself some pickles. Fact of life folks.  (I'll own up. I am that bum. In the suburbs it'd be the equivalent of an hr commute. Some people forget that.)So all the negativity aside, this is a great fun place - great ambiance, great food, cool decor. And I expect given more time they'll have even more yummy products collected all in one spot so my lazy bum doesn't have to zipcar it out for a slider.",2,1,2

142,Christine T.,"NY, NY",97,18,0,5.0,1/20/2012,"I chose the Brooklyneer as the place to celebrate my birthday. You can email them ahead of time and reserve a section of the bar for your group of ten or more (free of charge). I was ecstatic about this, on top of the food availability, good (mostly Brooklyn) beer selection, warm atmosphere, and photo booth. I was totally blown away by the service. It was seriously amazing. I showed up with my group a little late, and the reserved section was full of people. Nonetheless, the waitress had already informed them of the previously-made reservation, so she moved all of them out of that space. It was the most phenomenal showing of customer service I've ever seen at a NYC bar. The only thing that shocked me about the place was that, contrary to a previous reviewer's comment, it was VERY crowded on that Friday night, and the noise was pretty loud. However, later on, it quieted down and the atmosphere improved a lot. Our waitress continued to be very accommodating to us, serving drinks to my group of 15 and keeping track of everyone's individual checks without handing over a huge bill to the table at the end of the night. I was amazed at her ability to keep track of it all. Overall, I had a very memorable birthday celebration, and my guests were all very impressed by the Brooklyneer. Highly recommended birthday celebration locale.",,,

146,Jesse And Christy S.,"New York, NY",41,250,20,3.0,8/28/2013,"In an area of the city that is devoid of cool bars, the Brooklyner is alright. Pretty good ambiance, but we were sitting in the back underneath the speaker and it was really noisy. We asked them to turn the music down and while the did turn it down for a little bit, since those are the main speakers for the entire bar, they eventually turned the music back up and it was hard for us to converse again. Drinks are priced about what you would expect ($6-$8) and I didn't order any food. Maybe I would enjoy the bar more if we sat in a different area, but I'm not in this area much, so I don't think I'll be going out of my way to return here.",,,

So the bartender/waitress couldn't smile if her life depended on it. She couldn't help when I asked her menu questions either, or at least she didn't care enough to phone in a try. She oozed a lazy, shitty attitude that in & of itself would've turned me off to this place. I ordered a hot tea. It was colder than lukewarm tap water. It took them over ten minutes to deliver tea & honey to me. The bathrooms were no warmer than 35-40 degrees. When you exit the bathroom, they only offer you cold water to wash your hands with. This is, in my opinion, DISGUSTING, unsanitary and a big ""go fuck yourself"" to customers. The food was actually pretty good, though the portions were a bit small. The decor was also kinda nice & warm. I'm in no rush to go back.",1,,

The one with the relaxed vibe to go to with friends, have a few drinks, and enjoy hanging out for hours? This is it. From the lighting, to the thoughtful design details, the well spaced seating and cool bartenders, the owners of the Brooklyneer got it right.   The atmosphere is comfortable, the clientele is cool and there was enough room to turn around and see what's going on around you without tipping over your neighbor's drink. I have to admit, I live in Brooklyn, so I'm drawn to the place like a moth to flame.  Along with its ""Brooklyn"" bar status, it has what we all want in a good watering hole -  great ambiance, service and drinks!  As for the naysayers who claim Brooklyn bars should stay in Brooklyn, shame on you. That's like saying Southern food should stay in the South (Tipsy Parson, anyone?) and German beer in Germany (d.b.a or Zum Schneider?).  I won't even start with the Italians' gifts to the city.  If you want to live in the Brooklyn bubble, go for it.

A sampling of my thoughts: Seriously, naming a Manhattan bar Brooklyneer? Going ""local"" with ingredients from Brooklyn? Could we be taking the local movement just a little bit too far here?In this instance, it felt pretty damned good to be proven wrong. Granted, we only came here because it was such a convenient place to kill time before seeing a movie at Film Forum, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the laid back ambience and the carefully curated selection of foods here. We tried the pickle plate and the Brooklyneer dogs (imported from Mile End) and both were highly satisfying. The Brooklyneer lager on tap was nothing to write home about, but at $4 it did the job and washed down the food well.And you know what - it really does feel like Brooklyn, and not in a bad way.",,,

I even like the side street it is on, tucked quietly down the street from S.O.B.'s and not near much else! It's dark with high stools and plenty of space.....I really, really, really wanted to like this place......until I saw the bill! SAY WHAT???? I mean seriously??? SERIOUSLY?? $8 for a sandwich, I had to pay extra for the small basket of fries, and my Brooklyn beer ""on happy hour special"" still ran me $5 for a mug (not even a pint)!!! SERIOUSLY?? I could have walked to 14th street, taken the L to Brooklyn and with in 20min had everything in that bar for half the final tab!!I love my Manhattan, I love Brooklyn too, but on any given day I'd choose a Manhattan bar over the trek to a great place in Brooklyn......but for all that, it's not really financially worth it to go to the Brooklyneer, to experience the joys of Brooklyn on Manhattan! Stop by your local deli, pick up some Boars Head, a six pack of your favorite Brooklyn beer, and some frozen french fries, then call me!

However, the Brooklyneer would greatly improve it's experience for patrons if it didn't overfill the space to the extent that they do. I work across the street during the week and have always found their prices to be much too high for the serving size (picture a $14 martini served in those adorably petite wide-lip 1930's champagne glasses).I understand the post-work crowd on a weeknight. But the Saturday night crowd had to have been a fire hazard. There was no way to reach the bar and the clientele was pretentious and over-served (probably from another bar where you could actually get a drink). Gasping for air, my friend and I escaped this waste of an establishment and headed to KGB bar for a much more pleasant end to our evening.Tip: only go if you've already had enough to drink, are freezing and desire the body heat of 200 beanie wearing, skinny jean donning hipsters.",2,,

Why can't Manhattan have a few places like that? (The name seems like a gimmick to me, like a Dave & Buster's for the ironically inclined. Take it seriously at your peril.)  Damn. If I lavish too much praise, it'll become too crowded to enjoy, as it was on my last visit, when the ""Young Professionals meetup"" made it barely tolerable.  OK, one of the waitresses was snotty the first time i visited.

The Rusty Knot is also a great place.

180,Stephanie J.,"Dunedin, FL",150,57,39,5.0,7/22/2014,"I just spent two nights there on Thursday 07/17 and Friday 07/18.  I am a frequent visitor to NYC, but live in Florida,  I stumbled across this place after getting completely OVER the scene at the Village Tavern and wanting a more laid-back, less meat-markety atmosphere.  It was PERFECT!  The bartender, Andreas, was fun, witty and managed to entertain our entire group, ranging in ages between 24 and 47.  We all ended up back there again based on his recommendations.  And he was the consummate host, recommending other local places to check out while always inviting us back.  I love a bartender who will graciously offer tips to enjoy his city and experience other places, while always making you feel welcome back.  This is on my new, always updating list of places to go while I'm in the city.  I'll be back in a couple of months to enjoy their hospitality again!  The second night there, the DJ was fun and kept the crowd energetic,",,,
181,Lauren R.,"Philadelphia, PA",307,22,0,4.0,9/1/2012,"I am only giving this four stars because it is always so crowded, but I think it's pretty awesome. I loved the whole vibe in here. The ambience is cool, with old school cartoons playing on the television and pictures of Brooklyn landmarks around the bar. I had ""The Stoop"" signature cocktail, made with Absolut Brooklyn vodka. The bartender was a cool mixologist and I loved their barber shop straws. The beer list is good, though the taps weren't working when we came in. Definitely a cool place to get the night started. Their gastropub menu features Brooklyn businesses - and a lot of pickle options... never knew there were so many ways to season a pickle! We didn't eat this time, but we'll be back... when its not crowded...",,,
182,jack p.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,3/8/2011,"This place is good.  Don't be cynical about the theme.  It has good food.  Affordable booze.  And every time I've stopped in (5 times now and counting), it has plenty of quality clientele.... yes, I'm talking about women.Check it out, if you don't leave with a smile on your face, move to Connecticut.",,,
183,Erica I.,"Whitestone, NY",77,42,18,4.0,6/5/2012,"Came in one night for a drink for my friends bday and the place was packed-it was Friday happy hour-why wouldn't it be?  Anyway, a group of us sat down in the back and even brought in cupcakes from outside (which they didn't say anything about).  We ordered some drinks and the service was nice and fast.  Great bar for this neighborhood-they needed it.",,,
184,Sara M.,"Issaquah, WA",76,17,1,5.0,12/6/2012,Recently met some friends here who live nearby.  Loved everything about it.  I had a great salted caramel martini and some cider.  Great service and loved the atmosphere.  Can't wait to back next time I am in the city.,,,
185,Michael S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,16,0,4.0,12/5/2010,"My friends have recently been going here a lot, so on a spur of the moment we decided to join them since it was only a few blocks up from where we had just seen a concert (at City Winery).There was no wait at the door and not even a bouncer, which was sort of nice and we almost would have walked past the place if we weren't looking for the number, but then again we had a few drinks earlier.  We walked in and the place was decently packed, it wasn't too packed where you couldn't move but it was decently filled so that you didn't feel like you were in a lame place.  The space is nice, nothing amazing but still clean and modern.We met up with our friends who had managed to carve a space for themselves next to the bar.  The bartenders were very helpful and attentive, even if it took some time to get their attention, the place was poppin'.  The drinks were alright, not too strong and not too weak - they were a decent middle ground.I felt the music was a mixed bag, it was very chill - nothing you could dance to, but peppy enough so that you didn't have to pay attention to the thoughts in the back of your head.Overall I wouldn't go here for my main night out but it was still a fun place for a few drinks with friends.",,,
186,Christina C.,"Philadelphia, PA",166,3,0,5.0,2/13/2013,"As long as you don't have to be standing for hours, this place is great for day drinking.We went on Saturday after waiting at a nearby, too-crowded bar. Luckily we got there before the rush but we got a table and stayed for quite a bit. The beer is good and reasonably priced. More than that, the service was awesome. The bartender seemed a bit disorganized, but when they ran out of pitchers they gave us quite a deal on some drafts.It's a good crowd. Not too diverse but not too pretentious either. They really do try to make the customers happy, and the bathrooms are clean. We didn't try any food but that'll be next on the list!",,,
187,Tito W.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,5.0,12/18/2014,"Solid cocktail menu, great service, surprisingly good food and an incredible DJ on the weekends. Great bar for a date during the week or partying during the weekend.",,,
188,L.J. N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,4.0,1/7/2011,As a brooklynite I love seeing this bar in Manhattan. Beer selection is great. Food is decent. Atmosphere pretty cool. Service leaves a lot to be desired but I'll be back.,,,
189,Evan K.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",4,15,0,4.0,4/17/2011,"I must make everyone aware again, but this place has the nicest, friendliest bouncer ever. It's a very underrated thing to have a truly great bouncer, but is an important factor in the enjoyment of your night.Also, whoever chooses the beers here is doing a good job.My only drawback is the amount of food you get for your money. It may be called the Brooklyneer, but it has high-end Manhattan prices for food. The sliders are good, but not $11 for 3 (with no chips or fries) good.",2,4,1
190,Rupa D.,"Asbury Park, NJ",29,60,16,4.0,1/11/2012,"I've never seen a bartender put as much time and care into a cocktail as the Scott Weiland-looking guy working on my Agua Escondida at The Brooklyneer. And on a busy Friday night nonetheless! Very impressed. Also had their Red Hook pulled pork shoulder sliders and their bacon caramel popcorn, both of which were great. Would love to go back on a less packed evening and try out more of their cocktails.",,,
191,Matt W.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,5,0,1.0,11/18/2010,"As a Brooklynite of 12 years, I was obviously quite skeptical about stopping by a bar - in Manhattan - that is supposed to epitomize another borough.  Aside from the fact that this bar apparently is Manhattan's final admission that its X factor has been surpassed, I wondered if The Brooklyneer's primary clientele is supposed to be tourists or just really lazy Manhattanites who are unwilling to take the 8-12 minute subway and/or cab ride from Houston St into Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Williamsburg, or DUBMO.  But...I tried to look past all of that and shift my focus onto what many Brooklynites like to focus - the Brooklyn Brewery beers on tap.I walked in, saw that everyone who was drinking beer was drinking from extraordinarily  thick mugs - the kind of mugs that look like they hold 12 or 16 ounces of fluid but actually only hold 6 or 7 ounces.  So I skeptically ordered a Brooklyn IPA, gave the bartender an are-you-really-charging-6-bucks-from-a-Brooklyn-IPA? look, and then watched him hand me a mug of the beer.  And he handed me a beer in the aforementioned very same extraordinarily thick mug. I had just paid $6 ($7 including tip) for 7 ounces of beer!!!!  I drank it in 2 minutes and it took me 10 more seconds to get out the door; a door in which anyone in his or her right mind will never open again.  No matter the decor, the 'vibe,' the whatever, bars are for drinking, and no one should ever pay $1-per-one-ounce of Brooklyn Brewery beer.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.ADDENDUM:  I was contacted by the owner on March 30, 2011 who claims the $7-for-10-ounces-of-beer was an early mistake in first few months of the bar and has since been corrected.  However he also points out that the bar's new 'deal' is 10 ounces of its house beer (yikes) for $4 - which, using simple math here, equates to about $6.25 if that same house beer (again, yikes) was in an actual pint glass.  Not exactly a deal.  Sorry, Brooklyneer, but facts are facts.",7,6,1
192,Jules D.,"Hudson, NY",40,68,9,2.0,5/14/2011,"meh,service kinda slow, happy hour is bit of a joke ($1 off draft?) which brings it down to $6 a pint for happy hour? gee, thanks. I'm putting down that it doesn't have a happy hour cause it's really just lip service to the idea.Mostly rock hard stools and a pretty sterile unfriendly vibe. Staff pleasant but definitely not going out of their way to make you feel welcome.Brooklyneer in name only I'm afraid, if this place actually was in Brooklyn it would probably be out of business in short order. To uptight and waaay to expensive for the real hood.Actually, I just saw above that it's now $2 dollars off draft (but still $6 dollars for a pint)! What a joke, why not say your taking $10 dollars off?$6 a pint is still $6 a pint, I guess that they're betting on that everyone failed math.",1,,

All I can say is: tasty tacos and kickin IBA. And, to the merit of those tacos, the woman next to me shyly confessed she considered stealing one from my plate they looked so good.I'm happy, Houston St. You have a gem.",1,,
194,Mar M.,"New York, NY",10,16,0,5.0,2/12/2012,"Such a wonderful bar! If I had my way, half the bars in the city would be just like this one.. I don't have a single bad experience or observation to report. So laid back, such a polite, chill crowd, excellent service, one super cool bartender (his name sounds close to Dylan but I think it's Danuk or something similar), really good food, excellent beer selection (sixpoint growlers!), cute bathrooms- very flattering mirrors- and of course, the wonderful photo booth. Perfect for a date, or if you end up in line for greenhouse for 30 minutes and decide your time is a little more valuable than that.",,,
195,Bornila C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,5/31/2012,"I love this place.  Incredibly friendly bartenders, good strong drinks, chillaxed vibe.  Will definitely keep coming back since there's a dearth of decent not-too-shmancy but not-too-divey bars in the area and the Brooklyneer fits the bill.",,,

Updated review","I wanted to give the Brooklyneer one more shot and in going back a few months after opening, I was much more impressed.  The beer selection is much better and they're served in full pints.  The place was hopping with a good crowd.  I do love the decor and proximity to my office.  I haven't tried the food or cocktails (which looked excellent), but my bar experience was much better the second time around. I hope to be back again.",1,,
197,Angela N.,"Jersey City, NJ",97,40,4,2.0,12/3/2010,I wasn't really feeling this place.  The beers seem really small.  I felt a little ripped off.  I definitely wont go back. I'd probably just go to Brooklyn if I feel the need to hang out with hipsters.  The mushroom sliders were pretty amazing tho.,1,1,
198,bethany r.,"Queens, NY",4,77,53,4.0,1/6/2011,I really like this bar despite the lame name.  I was here for a private party and the food was fantastic.  The bar tender was super cute and not a prick.  All in all- it was a great place to hang out.  I will be back for sure.,1,,
