0,Meat L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0.0,5.0,10/17/2018,Great brunch spot. We all got omelets with hash browns. Very filling. Best part was they definitely don't skimp on the mimosas. Those things are stiff.,,,
1,Greg O.,"New York, NY",22,3,8,1.0,11/8/2018,"Food was generously portioned and wait staff was nice and courteous. However, the owner is also present and is rude to the wait staff and patrons. I heard him yell at the customers in the adjacent table ""get to the point!"" when something was wrong with their order.I'm surprised that this kind of behavior would be acceptable on 9th Avenue, but I suspect that the proximity to Times Square is sufficient to keep fresh customers rolling in.Ultimately my food was ""fine"", but the experience was quite awful. Don't fuel this establishment.",,,
2,Eva R.,"Los Gatos, CA",13,122,79,4.0,9/20/2018,"I was absolutely hangry when I ordered from Georgio's; practically everything sounded delicious. I had Sonia's wrap, and let me tell you, she has damn good taste. It also came with so many gigantic onion rings I wanted to eat but couldn't come close to finishing.I even got a slice of cheesecake because1. I was in NYC, after all, and2. I could save it for later and not be tempted by the mini-bar.I have never had a slice of cheesecake with a thin base of sponge instead of a graham cracker crust, though I know it's a thing. In this case, the texture combination was extremely off-putting, tasting less like a thin strip of cake than a thin strip of actual yellow kitchen sponge. It arrived still frozen, and if I had eaten it in that state, I think it would have been better. Sigh.Still, overall I thought this was great, and I appreciated that they included condiments, napkins and utensils (since I was kicking myself for forgetting to ask for them).",,,
3,Sasha V.,"Chicago, IL",30,64,91,5.0,11/10/2018,"Had a very nice steak dinner. This place seems like a mashup of a few different themes/culinary traditions but I found the service and food very delightful. IWas able to relax and really enjoy my meal, including the fresh salad and bread basket. I was in the mood for steak and was not disappointed. The fresh veggies and potatoes hit the spot. Great little spot--glad I stumbled in.",,,
4,Debi R.,"Irvine, CA",310,183,76,4.0,7/27/2018,"Came here after a Broadway show because it was on our way back to our hotel. We were pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate our party of 14 without a reservation. Our server Manoj (sp?) was very patient with all of our questions, and helped us with our orders. He was even better at making sure our cocktails were on a constant rotation. :)I had the lobster raviolis. They were delicious! I sopped up the sauce with some bread. Soooo yummy! We had a great time and left with full bellies.",1,2,2
5,Angie V.,"Little Falls, NJ",1,32,84,3.0,10/16/2018,"Food was soooo good. I would given them a five but the service not only does it take forever for you to be served, the custome isn't really acknowledged. It's like we just wait and wait and just got past by . Over all food was great and they gave a great portion.",1,1,1
6,Long N.,"Philadelphia, PA",30,291,483,3.0,2/23/2018,"Your basic american restaurant. We came in during breakfast so had eggs, bacon, and toast. Nothing too special about the venue other than location. The place was clean and the service was good. Again, nothing to be wowed about, but may be because we were there for breakfast and their lunch or dinner selection may be better.There was plenty of seating for small and large groups. It was more a mexican vibe, but nothing hispanic about their breakfast menu. It was interesting. No complaints here. Will try again if in the area again.",,,
7,Cece J.,"New York, NY",4,59,99,5.0,5/22/2018,"Stumbled upon this place on a busy Friday night because it was one of the few restaurants in the area that had an open table. I was very impressed by the variety of cuisines and options they had on their menu- everything from Greek food to Mexican,  wine to health smoothies. We were cheerful greeted and quickly seated by their accommodating staff. Our waiter was super friendly and quick to take our order and make sure everything was going well. Their food was delicious and reasonably priced given it's NYC. Definitely a great find!",,,
8,Dan D.,"Huron, SD",88,3,2,5.0,10/26/2018,"Traveling from South Dakota. Fantastic omelettes, incredible food all around. Not a complaint from anyone in my group of 4 about the food. Only possible problem we could see was small location. Tightly packed into tables at brunch, but worth it for the food. Very nice service from staff despite high demand from packed location. Will definitely return upon our next trip.",,,
9,Myr S.,"Odenton, MD",3,59,6,4.0,5/15/2018,"Popped in for a pre-show dinner as a result of Leslie Odom Jr's name-dropping this place (albeit for brunch) in a 2015 Grubstreet article, and we were so glad we did! My companion enjoyed his burger, and I really liked my Rigatoni Bolognese - great flavor, and a filling portion without being too much food.  They had drink specials going on a Saturday early evening, which was nice - enjoyed a glass of sangria with my pasta for just $4.95.  Service was attentive, and the space has a lot of personality.  Cozy, without seeming claustrophobic.I'm so glad to have found this place; I drive up to NYC for shows fairly often and it's great to have an alternative to offer friends/family to my other usual dinner go to :)",,,

Updated review","Reliable neighborhood diner. It can get very crowded, particularly for weekend brunch, as tourists seem to have discovered it's a better deal than what they're likely to find a block or two to the east. I'm a big fan of the breakfast specials, particularly the Denver omelette. Home fries have that special smooshed together texture I don't always get from diners.",,,
11,Jane M.,"Morris County, NJ",146,381,225,4.0,7/30/2017,"What a nice spot for breakfast! With all the overpriced breakfast places in New York City it is so nice to go to a clean, friendly and reasonably priced place. The breakfast menu had plenty to choose from along with some interesting breakfast specials too. Service was friendly and prompt always refilling water glasses and refreshing my hot tea. Very nice portion sizes as well. Open sliding doors with screens welcome in the breeze without bugs. We will be back. A great meal for all of us.",1,,
12,Darin B.,"The Village, Muncie, IN",31,3,0,5.0,10/9/2018,This was our second trip to this restaurant. It is a very nice restaurant with good food. It is a very cool older restaurant. Make sure you get the black and white shake. My son calls this his favorite shake of all time.,,,
13,Carol L.,"New York, NY",657,182,497,3.0,7/4/2017,"3.5 stars rounded down.Came with a bunch of friends and service was a bit slow in terms of getting us all menus, refilling our water, etc. I tried the Rigatoni Bolognese and a bit of the Lobster Ravioli. Both were really good! Their parmesan they scoop onto the pasta seems like it could be a bit fresher, some of it came out in chunks. But overall, the pasta was pretty good. I would say this is a great place for groups, but definitely not somewhere where the food is something I'd dream about.Pro-tip: They have sangria and mojitos for $5 during their Happy Hour!",,,
14,Kristina I.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",113,173,121,3.0,5/23/2018,"Definitely no frills.  The place was pretty empty when my two coworkers and I arrived around 8:30 AM on a Tuesday.  The service was quick and attentive.  All three of us had pretty basic breakfast foods (bacon, eggs, and home fries). No complaints.  The eggs were cooked how I wanted them.  Great coffee.",,,
15,Laura N.,"Sugar Hill, GA",6,7,10,4.0,9/3/2018,"I see this as being a local neighborhood favorite. It's not a fancy place but it's good and the portion sizes are plenty!! Service was quick, prices were average. I think it deserves more than 3 stars which is its current rating.",,,
16,Neal D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,66,29,3.0,6/30/2018,"Ate here for a post Broadway show. Ordered the regular burger, BBQ chicken, chicken noodle soup and pork chop dinner.

18,Faith H.,"New York, NY",613,35,25,4.0,6/2/2018,"Got the Santa Monica omelette and it was delish! It was stuffed with avocado, mushroom, cheddar, tomato, and one or two other veggies I can't remember..but it also came with a heaping serving of home fries that were well seasoned and hit the spot for brunch. They come with an option of juice & tea or a coffee which I thought was a pretty good deal! I ordered grapefruit juice and an earl grey tea. Not crowded at all for around 1pm on a Saturday. The murrays omelette with lox sounded good too so will maybe try that next time!",,,
19,Daniel T.,"Allen, TX",0,3,0,4.0,10/19/2018,"What a great breakfast with a reasonable NYC price. Great service in a convenient location to Broadway attractions in a nice neighborhood. In NYC near Broadway hungry, come to Georgio's Country Grill.",,,
20,Cheryl P.,"New York, NY",127,78,10,5.0,3/27/2018,Stopped here for dinner and enjoyed the rib eye with garlic mashed potatoes. My husband had the angel hair margarita pasta with shrimp.

21,Karla M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",30,54,68,5.0,5/26/2018,"I've ordered takeout from here so many times! They are quick and they are good deliveries! I usually don't like take out foods because they come all soggy and gross, but they way they package it up works out so well! I definitely would recommend.I've only ate physically in this restaurant once, but it was quick. They're service is amazing.

22,Hayley M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",261,17,17,1.0,6/11/2018,"We've tried this place out a couple of times, just toGive the benefit of the doubt. They always seem to try to nickel and dime you and the food is sub par for the money being charged. I've tried the grilled chicken and pasta twice, and each time the grilled chicken was burnt, and the tomato sauce made me sick. The chicken soup is awful, and the customer service is also somewhat subpar. I've called for a take out order before too and every time I go to get my food, the order is messed up in some way. This is way too much money to pay for subpar food and fickle service. Only good dish here is the French toast, and even when ordering turkey bacon (which usually comes with 4-5 slices), they try to scam you by only giving you 3.",,,

24,Taina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,69,128,3.0,3/22/2018,"Well, the first spot I wanted to eat at had a line. The second didn't have a restroom. I ended up here because I really wanted a burger, I needed to sit and I had to use the restroom! (If you want the short version of my review, jump to the last paragraph.)THE SETTING:  It's a Thursday night, a little after 7.  I was greeted with a smile, seated promptly and the waiter arrived shortly after. Music is low and mellow. A few diners, not crowded. THE FOOD: I ordered a Kobe beef burger- medium with fries, a strawberry/ peach sangria and a water to start. The sangria looked nice, however it tasted like juice. Now I know sangria is a fruity drink, but I tasted No alcohol at all. There wasn't even any in the fruit itself and that's usually where the alcohol likes to settle! The burger was still a bit juicy even though it was overdone (medium- well instead of medium. ) I was too hungry to send it back and it Was still tasty after I added a touch of salt, pepper, mayo and ketchup. The fries were good as was the black and white milk shake I ordered after being disappointed by the sangria.THE SERVICE: As I stated  previously, the staff were smiling when looking at patrons. No one seemed upset. The ""water boy "" filled my cup when it was about half empty before I had a chance to ask. However, the waiter didn't come to check on me once. After my plate was cleared and the person at the next table was done with his food, the waiter did come by with an arm full of yummy looking desserts to show us. If I weren't full from the dinner I'd just eaten, I probably would have indulged! After getting my check, I asked for the rest of the milkshake to go, gave my credit card and informed the waiter I was going to the bathroom. When I got back to my table, the receipt book with my card was facing up. That wouldn't have been a problem for me if I weren't alone and the place wasn't getting more customers.  It's been a Very Long time since I gave a 10% tip and i hated doing it, but I felt that was the most he deserved this evening- being nice earned him SOMEthing.OVERALL: Though the service and the sangria were nothing to boast about, the food and milkshake were good! Oh! And the bathroom was clean and spacious.",,,
25,Karen L.,"Dayton, OH",1,66,69,3.0,7/2/2017,"We had breakfast at Georgios on a weekday. Husband ordered a build your own omelette, which is where you pick the items you want. He was happy with the taste, and it was filling. I did notice that his omelette wasslightly browned on the outside, which i thought was overdone. I usually like my ells yelloe, not browned. I ordered a scrambled egg, corned beef hash, fried potato plate. It was satisfying, but nothing special. The service was excellent.",1,,
26,Sherry S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,60,103,5.0,10/10/2017,I've been eating here close to 18 years now and have never had a bad meal. For such a small place they have a big menu with a lot if variety. Great cocktails too. The last time I was in there I had the best fried fish I think I've ever had. And the prices are fair. Always great service.Breakfast anytime is wonderful! It's a New York gem for sure. I'll be there again on my next trip to the Big Apple!,,,
27,A T.,"San Jose, CA",0,25,55,5.0,4/17/2018,"I ordered aramando wrap and the portions are huge. This place Has a feel of a mom and pop place with the owner at the helm.  And if you want to see a coin operated telephone booth that nobody uses, there is one right here.",,,
28,Star S.,"Tucson, AZ",134,31,17,5.0,5/12/2018,"The Italian food does not disappoint!!  Wow! This is by far some of the best Italian food we have had in NYC! While reading the menu outside, we were greeted by a man with a heavy Italian accent who told us the specials. Turns out is was Georgio. The restaurant was packed. The service started a tad slow (to be expected with a restaurant so full). The bread was ok. A mix of different Rye and sour dough. The chicken soup was great! And then we got our meals. I ordered the chicken cutlet Parmesan with angel hair pasta and spaghetti sauce .....FANTASTIC! My husband ordered the Penne Napoli (penne noodles with a white sauce, sausage and peppers)....AMAZING!!!  Prices were very comparable to most Lunch places and we were far more satisfied with this meal than we have been for almost all of the other ""Italian meals.""We highly recommend!!!!!",1,,1
29,Devki P.,"New York, NY",299,72,33,3.0,5/14/2017,"This place was a decent breakfast in Hells Kitchen without having to sit down for a full brunch affair. The feel of the place reminded me a lot of the diners I used to frequent in Jersey. Service was a little slow but food was decent. Large portion sizes and reasonable prices for dishes. They give you all the condiments (syrup for pancakes, jam for toast) in these weird plastic containers which makes the whole place feel a little cheap which I thought was a little weird. If you're looking for a quick sit down breakfast though, this place wouldn't be a bad stop.",1,,
30,Naomi Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,293,331,3.0,12/10/2016,Good but not great. The avocado & chicken salad was pretty fresh but I've honestly had better.

Updated review","Georgio's has been a consistently good elevated diner-like restaurant for years.  From their reasonably-priced entrees to their breakfast all day menu, you really can't go wrong.  The best option is the breakfast burrito that comes with home fries for less than $9.  Their drinks are on point and sangria is definitely a highlight.  They usually take reservations on opentable, which is another plus.",2,2,2
32,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,988,6100,3.0,7/18/2016,"On our way out & wanted to get a bite to eat before the late night began ... Seems like unless it was a bar most of the food places were either closed or closing It was around 1130pm this place was open so we decided to give it a try. Came in & we were seated right away once seated we got some drinks I had a Cosmo not bad drink was good , my friend had a Brooklyn lager beer good as well.For a small restaurant they sure have a large menu .. Lots to choose from Food I had the personal Pizza cheese w fresh garlic comes with a salad or soup, I got the salad. Salad was not bad pretty tasty vinaigrette dressing. Pizza was good as well the garlic gave it a nice taste , decent size personal. My friend had a Burger & fries , good burger meat was tasty & the fries were good.Small restaurant , simple decor .. Service was good & prices were not bad.",6,1,3
33,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,2.0,4/5/2018,"Didn't have any real expectations about Georgio's and glad I didn't.  Came here after playing a softball game on a weeknight and this place was packed.  Right when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess which was nice.  Food portions were pretty friendly just like their service but sadly the food was really bland.  Went with the turkey burger with bacon with a side of sweet potato fries and was not impressed with the meal one bit.  My friend had salad which she enjoyed but then again... it's hard to mess up a salad.  Service was great, but I just couldn't get over how disappointing my food was.  Ambiance doesn't disappoint as it lives up to its name with farm items and animal figurines all around the restaurant.  With all the restaurants in the Hells Kitchen area I would recommend eating elsewhere, especially with the prices being what they are at Georgios. Maybe just maybe ill give this place another chance since I did enjoy their portions and service.",1,,1

As a habit, I don't order from 3 star restaurants, but made an exception bc the menu fit my cravings. My breakfast was good! (And I ordered extra for lunch.) Everything was cooked how I asked. It came in pristine condition, i.e. it was obviously kept level for over 10 blocks (over easy eggs are usually a mess and these were like fresh out of the pan). Things were packaged logically, separated for maximum quality upon arrival. The food and drinks were much better than most places with higher ratings.

52,Eszter H.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,64,35,4.0,6/9/2017,"My friend and I decided to stay in the city the day before Memorial Day - we had stayed at a hotel nearby and wanted to get some food. We originally picked a different place but we forgot to call and they were not open. Georgio's was next door, full of satisfied looking people and the food smelled good even from the outside. My friend ordered a steak while I ordered a salad and penne vodka. My salad was good - can't really mess it up - and while my pasta tasted good, it seemed more like it was made with marinara sauce than vodka sauce; but again, it tasted good. My friend ordered his steak medium rare and it was actually more well done than he would have liked. He asked the waitress if it could be remade and they did it with no fuss, no extra charge and the second time he said it was perfect. We expected the bill to be higher but surprisingly it was quite affordable. I would definitely visit this place again.",,,

Thankfully, Georgio's was able to accommodate us.For my main meal, I decided to go with the grilled chicken and a side of broccoli. This dish was pretty no frills, as it came with grilled chicken--no marinade or rub, just plain--and some steamed broccoli. Though the dish was pretty uneventful, it was pretty generous and definitely was more than enough food for me.Overall, the vibe of this place is a bit divey and the prices correlate. The service was friendly, but not super attentive. In addition, nothing looked super spectacular, but everyone seemed satisfied with their meals.",1,,

58,Sash S.,"New York, NY",108,66,25,4.0,8/18/2016,"Great place with reasonable pricing. Came here with a group of friends. We noticed the place as we were walking down the street and decided to give it a shot. Thankfully, we all enjoyed our meals. Food: to start I had the chicken noodle soup. The flavor was great and the chicken was tender. Very good soup. My entree was a special - bowtie pasta with Italian sausage (with shiitake mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes). A gentleman also added some amazing cheese once the plate was served. The dish was well balanced and had great flavor. Overall very good. Also noticed some great looking cheesecakes but didn't get to try them.Service: Good but nothing memorableAmbience: Decent tavern like atmosphere.Overall: A good place to check out if you're in the neighborhood.",,,

60,Steve R.,"New York, NY",0,19,4,5.0,11/4/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant in NYC. The food is always tasty, the staff is nice and attentive, they do great delivery and Georgio always says hello personally. The grilled chicken avocado salad is my personal favorite and you always see at least 2 or 3 other diners enjoying it at their tables as well. Also a big fan of the Sonia's Wrap. Sometimes I get it with a side salad and dump the delicious contents of the wrap on top. Big dinners are great, too. Pasta specials are always new and intriguing and you can never go wrong with chicken parm. Only two downside is brunch items are overpriced. I guess they do great brunch biz! Can't fault them for taking advantage of what they do well.",,,
61,Tanya T.,"New Orleans, LA",15,3,5,5.0,6/11/2017,We are from New Orleans and loved the food at this establishment. The atmosphere is nice and quaint. The food was delicious on all 3 times visiting. We highly recommend and will definitely come back when visiting New York.,,,

69,Pandora B.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",1,94,0,4.0,7/23/2017,"Georgio's is not a ""country grill"" -- whatever that means in the middle of Ninth Ave. in New York City.  It's a diner. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Diners are a New York institution and we should support their existence because they fill an important dining niche when you're hungry, don't need a tablecloth and want a menu of seven thousand things to choose from. Georgio's is a long, narrow space, but they've prettied it up with bright plates, bright colors, and whimsical figurines of animals and birds on a shelf high up on the wall. This must be where the ""country"" in ""country grill"" comes from. The food was what one would expect in a good quality diner. I enjoyed my Mediterranean omelet with olives and other vegetables and feta cheese, a generous side of crispy-not-greasy home fries, pink grapefruit juice and a decent cup of coffee. My companion had a bowl of linguine with tomato sauce, of which she ate every bit (it was her first meal of the day). In other words, we had diner food.To sum up, good diner food, cute atmosphere, good service. Ninth Ave. has a 15-20 block stretch of a hundred or more restaurants, and if you're looking for a ""country grill"" rather than some other category of restaurant, Georgio's will do just fine.",,1,

Get there today and of course they suddenly cannot put me at a window seat even though there were 4 open tables there. Then the manager or whoever it was gets in my face and tells me now I need to wait for all people in my party of 4 to arrive ""then we'll see what happens."" Really? For diner food??? Stood outside for 3 mins waiting for my party since Georgio's is so cramped and there's nowhere to stand. Luckily we noticed Alfie's across the street was just opening and went there instead.

To my delight, portions were mighty and so was quality.My whole grain strawberry chocolate chip pancakes were tasty, although as soon as I got my coffee, I instantly craved savory. My bf's protein omelette came to the rescue. The humongous egg white mess came out piping hot and topped with a melty goodness. Home fries were not dry at all, and the chicken added a lot of unexpected flavor. A big plus was the free juice, which wasn't your run-of-the-mill OJ from concentrate. Our apple, lemon, ginger fresh squeezed juices were a great finish to the meal.If you're looking for simple, hearty breakfast food that doesn't suffer in quality, give Gerogio's a try!",1,,

I can't recommend the Angel Hair Primavera w/ Chicken enough. The dish is large enough for dinner and lunch the next day.

Beyond that, my fries were overlooked, her wrap tasted nothing like a caesar wrap and I had the smallest double decker grilled cheese I've ever seen. They were fairly attentive after the evening progressed, but I wouldn't waste my money again. The quality just wasn't there for a 9th Ave restaurant. To say the least, when we left, we were disappointed.",,,

83,Naresh J.,"Alameda, CA",0,4,1,5.0,7/17/2017,"I agree with Raul C, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't give this place 5 stars. I imagine it's something similar to people complaining about cars because the built-in wifi functionality didn't work while roaming in Mexico. I digress but trust me, if you're here for the food you're in for the RIGHT reasons!! We walked in to get breakfast food at 10 PM and boy were we impressed. Really wide spread and crazy options but the Eggs, Chicken Alfredo, Avacado soup, fries, shakes and toast we had were scrumptious!! Very home made, wholesome taste with big generous servings.

87,David W.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,247,739,2.0,6/14/2016,"I stopped in for dinner with family and a few friends, and quite frankly I was disappointed, particularly after reading some of the glowing reviews on Yelp. Maybe the breakfast menu is better. I found the Mediterranean Salad to be really perfunctory in execution (mostly just some Romaine lettuce, some tomato and red pepper pieces, and feta cheese crumbled on top (see photo), with nothing else. Dressing on the side, which seemed like a factory-made dressing. The individual pizza was okay, but nothing to write home about, either - I had to wonder if it was previously frozen. The Cajun Salad got better reviews, however. The staff was competent, but seemed generally indifferent to us as customers. I didn't think anything on the menu was much of a bargain, in terms of pricing. ""Meh,"" sums it up. It is, however, a kid-friendly place, note the pizza, if you're bringing them. I might give them another try, and perhaps for breakfast, but for now, just 2 stars.",2,,

It gets pretty crowded on weekends - I'm actually surprised as to how many people they can fit in this small space - and if you're going with more than 2 people I would expect a wait. The waitstaff is super friendly when you get there though and definitely try to seat you as soon as possible.It's pretty much your classic crowded diner environment with a little bit of a unique touch. The menu is huge and has anything you could possibly want. We opted for the omelettes in the brunch special menu. I got the protein omelette with egg whites, broccoli, chicken, and tomatoes, and my friend got the Arizona omelette with avocado and tomatoes. It came with a coffee, which they were really good about refilling, and sides of toast and homefries. The omelette was HUGE and really cheesy so definitely a lot for me. The service was underwhelming - it was hard to get their attention when we first got there to even get water or to order our coffees, but in their defense the place was really busy. It would have been nice though if the staff was more attentive and we didn't have to strain to flag them down whenever we needed anything. Overall it's pretty good for the price, but I'm not sure if I'll be going back unless I'm in a rush.",,,1

At first they offered us a 10% off coupon while we were looking at the menu outside. Finding out that it was open late with the presented coupon made us try out the place. The restaurant was a bit slow when we walked in but picked quickly. I was allowed to order breakfast food at 11 pm and the food was made fresh.

Updated review","Ok-first, we live in the neighborhood and have eaten everywhere. There are three great reasons to eat at this place: 1) this is a great value!, 2) very diverse menu, with good food and 3) always good service. The food is always good and the specials are always fresh. We recently had the Turkey special and it was excellent....like Thanksgiving. We had wine, beer, appetizers, salads, and the turkey and it was about $90 for both of us. Another point to mention is that this is the Bly traditional American kitchen that I know of in Manhattan. We're lucky to have it in the neighborhood.We will continue to support this local establishment",,,
120,Michael L.,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",20,176,505,4.0,3/30/2014,"In need of a spot of breakfast I stopped in here because it was local and you Yelpers seemed to approve of the place.I was quickly sat down and noticed that the surrounding tables were all occupied by locals, always a good sign. My service was quick and friendly and my water was topped up with an efficiency which had me questioning if I had actually been drinking from the glass or just imagining it.I ordered a Cowboy steak and eggs, even though I'm not a cowboy and I complimented this with a banana ""healthy"" shake (my quotes).The steak was good, maybe a tad more cooked than I would have liked it, but I don't know how rare a New York rare is - there is certainly a worldwide geographical variation in the interpretation of this.The banana healthy shake was many things but I cannot imagine that healthy is one of them. It was so thick, the consistency of nearly set concrete. I had to suck it through the straw with such force that I feared that my sinuses may implode or some other medical disaster but it was worth it. That shake was so good I would fly back across from the UK right now just to have another one.I don't remember how much my check was, but it wasn't expensive. Thanks for the heads up my Yelpy buddies, I enjoyed my visit here!",3,,
121,Courtney E.,"Pflugerville, TX",135,90,28,4.0,11/26/2016,"Stopped here for breakfast on a recommendation as we were trying to escape the tourist spots in NYC. Our waiter was quick but not outwardly friendly. Not rude, just not friendly. I ordered on of the breakfast specials which came with coffee or juice. I had already ordered coffee, so when he asked if I wanted juice I said no, thinking that would be extra. But instead, he charged me for everything a la carte, which came out to be more than the price of the special. I don't know if he did that on purpose since I was a tourist or if it was an honest mistake. I didn't want to make a fuss. The food was good, and my husband especially loved the potatoes.",,,
122,Josh T.,"Manhattan, NY",94,10,4,2.0,7/18/2015,"My girlfriend and I were SO hoping Georgio's would be a quality experience since it's so convenient. Unfortunately, there was very little to like.1) There's no sign on the door, nor did our waiter let us know, that their credit card machine was down and only took cash.2) The food quality itself wasn't all that good either. The eggs were burnt, the quality of the goat cheese was cheap and overly salty, and after asking twice, they did not seem to understand what ""extra crispy"" bacon meant - I sent it back and it was still undercooked.3) Given that the food was not much to rave about to begin with, the service was unjustifiably slow. We will not be coming back again.",2,1,1
123,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,5.0,5/14/2014,"The reviews don't really seem to do this restaurant justice. I came in here expecting mediocre food/service/environment and was completely taken aback on all fronts.Came here twice: Once for a Grilled Chicken Avocado Salad ($11ish) and another for the Belgian waffle w/fresh fruit ($9ish). Salad is huge, and comes with a really nice bread basket. Whipped butter is underrated. Waffle was crispy on the outside but warm and fluffy on the inside. Both times had the hazelnut coffee which really hits the spot - and FREE REFILLS. You never see that kind of diner service in the area.Most importantly, each time I was in and out of the place in 35 minutes. No wait, no hassle, and great service. Very large menu, so will be back to sample more.",1,,

Super nice service, solid delicious food, quick, not noisy or busy any time I go.Love to take out of town guests here for breakfast in the area.  Recent favorites are the omelettes (I like the Denver) and the chicken and waffles.Georgio's is also forever promoting their sangrias, which come in interesting flavors like Blueberry Pineapple, etc (usually a mix of something sweet and tart).I've never ordered delivery, but a friend of mine always orders from them and is very happy.  (She orders so much she was actually surprised when we walked by the first time.  She had forgotten it must also be a sit-down place.)",2,1,2

128,Melissa C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",248,30,67,3.0,9/5/2014,"I walked into Georgio's for lunch with two of my friends not knowing what to expect. I was thrilled to see they served breakfast all-day! We first ordered the hummus lunch special for the table and honestly, the portion size is so small. It's as if they smeared the hummus on the plate like spreading butter on toast. It was good hummus, it's just that for the price, they could offer us a bit more! For our entrees my friend ordered a Portobello Wrap with fries. She said the sandwich was ""generic"" and the fries tasted like ""Burger King fries."" My other friend ordered the Sourdough sandwich with grilled eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, and goat cheese. Hers was good, except they forgot to toast one piece of the sandwich bread. Weird. I ordered an omelette with spinach and mushrooms with home fries on the side. I asked for well done home fries and eh, they were just eh. The coffee was ok and the service was good (they kept filling up my water), but the food...the food was just ""eh"" just ok, just basic.",,,
129,Mark L.,"Castle Shannon, PA",69,690,290,4.0,4/19/2014,"I've been here twice now for breakfast when visiting NYC. The best thing I can say is that you get a really good breakfast for the price. My total check came to $7.59, which included two scrambled eggs, potatoes, two slices of pumpernickel bread, coffee, and orange juice. The quality of the food was just fine. The eggs were perhaps slightly overcooked for my tastes, but I am just quibbling. I liked their potatoes, which were fresh and did not taste as though they came from a frozen package of prepared potatoes.  Coffee was nothing to write home about. Service was really good, considering the place was really crowded and I was practically sitting at the same table as the party next to me, since the tables were so close together. I was going to give this place three stars, since nothing stood out in the food area, but decided with the price to value ratio that this place offers, it merits four stars for that alone.",,,

For example ordered a sandwich off the special menu it said it was on ciabatta bread. It came on raisin bread. When I asked for it to be changed - there was no apologizes and the staff seemed annoyed. Also there was a dressing on the sad which which also was not mentioned. This isn't the first time this has happened here. I also don't find the staff overly friendly or accommodating. This last visit might be my last.,1,,

Got the pancakes (walnut and strawberry) which sounded pretty good and got amazing Yelp reviews. Sadly, it was one of those instances of ""that could be a good combination"" gone wrong. Pancakes were dry and falling apart. Filling was too heavy. And the side of ""whipped butter"" tasted like it came out of a can.   For what it's worth, the service was good, but I was one of only two people in the restaurant (guess that should've been a sign). About as mediocre a breakfast spot as you'll find.",1,,

With a large menu selection and the kitchen puts out some good diner food. On weekends it can get a bit crowded by the 12:00 hour with a bit of a wait but it moves quickly. If  you come a bit earlier you'll find a table easily. Tables are a bit cramped to fit more service tables in the restaurant but it isn't too different from any other cramped NYC restaurant. A nice brunch menu of omelettes and pancakes that come with toast, breakfast potatoes and the main. I'm a fan of the Corn beef hash, 2 fried eggs or the various pancakes. Can't go wrong with the banana walnut or blueberry. They have fresh squeezed juices as well grapefruit and orange. Burgers and the dinner entres are standard fare and i usually come here for the brunch. Also they have a great selection of smoothies as well. I liked the banana peanut butter which went well with my 2 eggs on one particular day.Fast service and your standard diner waiter repore.",3,,2

I must say the one thing I would not forget from my experience at Georgio's is the enthusiastic service, and that too in New York. Mind blown! LOL The waiters would whoosh past us with always carrying coffee to refill your empty cups and our food arrived promptly as well. The food was nothing special though. Both me and my friend ordered french toast with a side of scrambled eggs. The french toast was OK and the scrambled eggs were just like any other scrambled eggs.

155,Lisa G.,"New York, NY",5,13,0,4.0,10/8/2015,"Over the past year or so, Georgio's has become my go-to place to hang out with a friend.  I found it by accident one Sunday afternoon, and had maybe the best eggs florentine I'd ever had.  Since then, I've been back there every hour of the day and night, and have taken maybe a dozen different people there.  Everyone always says, ""This place is great!""It's a step above a diner, with huge portions, huge selection, and decent service.  I eat there probably 4-5 times a month, and I can always sit and chat with my dinner guest for as long as I want. I never feel rushed out of there, even when it's busy.  The food and the staff can be hit-or-miss sometimes.  Not all of the wait staff speaks English as their first language, and I've had to repeat and explain things on occasion. And once in a blue moon, a cook has an off night.  But I'm there so often, a couple of the waiters recognize me and treat me like a ""regular.""  When I took some out-of-town friends with kids there, they allowed my friends to exchange a dish that was unsatisfactory, and they made the kids (pre-teens) feel welcome.Watch out for the Dessert Ninjas, though. Just as you're finishing your meal and saying how you couldn't possibly eat another bite, someone will swoop in with a platter full of dessert samples and ask if you'd like dessert or coffee.  They know it's hard to say no when slices of cake and pie are shoved under your nose!  It's all standard fare, with the occasional seasonal addition, and only once has anything tasted stale or like it was frozen then rethawed.I just wish they offered halfsize portions for half the price, even if only during lunchtime.  They give you a LOT of food (although they don't care if you share).  But if you're hungry and just want some basic decent American fare that's better than a greasy spoon diner, then stop by Georgio's.",,,

It's on 9th Avenue, so it's not touristy.My friend & I went for country fried chicken. He's from Texas, so he KNOWS country fried chicken. The menu said it comes with ""greens"", so we asked what kind.  The server didn't know so she checked. This is a good thing. I don't expect servers to know the answer to every question, but be willing to check without my having to ask them to. She came back with a funny answer, though: broccoli. Some days it's green beans, she said. So, they define ""greens"" simply as a green vegetable. We didn't mind, but I mention it for purists. The mashed potatoes had a sort of potato-flake consistency in some spots. Not sure what that was about.We didn't get dessert, but we had a couple of mojitos.

166,Nabila I.,"Toronto, Canada",42,258,239,4.0,3/6/2015,"This was the first breakfast place my friends and I went to on a recent trip. It was very conveniently located for us, and I'm so glad we popped in. I ordered the Crab Cake Burger, which was very filling. The crab cake patty was nicely seasoned and made. It sort of crumbled as you ate the burger. The downside was it was a crab cake... not a crab patty. I shared my meal with a friend, so I also tried her order of Two Country Fresh Eggs. She had them with the home fried potatoes and toast, as well as turkey sausages. I found the potatoes were too chunky for my liking. But the best part of the entire meal was this incredible shake I ordered; The Hazelnut Blast. That alone is definitely worth a visit. Other than the shakes, it's a nice place to go to when you want breakfast, or lunch.",,,

168,Mack M.,"Arlington, VA",0,8,0,5.0,11/27/2015,"We were walking around Hells Kitchen looking for a place to eat on Thanksgiving. Saw this place from across the Street and it looked inviting. Looked at the menu and were planning to go in when a manager greeted us and invited us in. We ate off the special Thanksgiving menu and it was better than a home cooked meal. Everything on the plate was delicious. The turkey was moist and tasty. The pork chop was seasoned and cooked perfectly. All the sides were delicious. Then dessert came, which was included, and that was the cherry on top of the meal.     We also had a pitcher of Sangria and met some great locals sitting at the tables around us. We never felt rushed to leave. The place was packed and the service was phenomenal.  I can't find anything bad to say about our experience. We will definitely come back many more times.",2,,1
169,Anthony B.,"BC, Canada",0,2,0,4.0,9/27/2016,"Nice spot for breakfast. Hearty home cooked food.  The Wisconsin omelette made me feel like I was back in Wisconsin. The Bloody Mary was spicey and good.  Good value, good service.",,,

171,Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",116,1102,970,4.0,12/10/2012,My gf and I came here for Sunday brunch. We stayed at the Sheraton a few blocks down. The host was nice and sat us towards the back where we can put our bags. We had to wait 10 minutes because it was a packed out. It seems like most of the patrons are locals. I ordered the strawberry chocolate pancakes with a pina colata shake and my gf got the Denver omelet.   The shake was really good. It wasn't too sugary. My pancakes had the strawberries mixed and cooked with the pancake. I would have preferred the strawberry added after the chocolate pancakes were cooked but it was just ok. The omelet was good nothing else to say about it. I'd come back because it's a legit place without the high price I expect around the area.,1,,
172,Marci C.,"Honolulu, HI",252,130,221,4.0,4/6/2013,"(more like 4.5)Simple eggs and bacon.  That's all we were looking for... nothing fancy.  Georgio's  Country Grill has just that, and it was delicious despite its simplicity.  From the outside, the restaurant is rather small, quaint, and easy to miss.  The interior of the restaurant, however, is welcoming, comfortable, and noisy. We went to Georgio's for a late brunch and were seated upon entering despite its crowdedness.  Good sign.  We ordered:1) french toast - best french toast tried so far; sweet on its own and lacked the gross rubbery texture of many other french toasts.2) two scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and yummy potato thing - definitely satisfied craving for a good old traditional egg & bacon breakfast.  The potato thing was also very good.Overall great place to eat a simple, delicious homestyle breakfast.",,,
173,Carmen R.,"North Bethesda, MD",0,19,57,3.0,1/3/2014,The food was okay. The French toast I had was fabulous and the omelette was GREAT!! My server was kind and attentive and listened very well. Hot chocolate was good too.,,,
174,Klark K.,"Winter Park, FL",0,10,65,4.0,1/1/2014,"Overall I would have to say not bad. The three and one-half stars set you up; go in open-minded. The service is attentive courtesy of the floor manager that works the seating.The wait staff did a great job today. The food is okay, nothing special, but not bad at all. Decent portions for the price and the food came out quickly and hit. I add the caveat that after eating overseas (Turkey, Russia, Paris, Germany) I have a pallets for fresh and robust flavors. American palette are a bit bland and heavily saturated one way or another typically so with that said, I may be an outlier in food taste.As an example, there was a comment on not enough bread and jelly: it was plenty. Just enough to enjoy both bread and a bit of sweetness. I would not recommend turning your toast into a jelly donut less you just can't make it to Dunkin' Donuts. Which is on every corner in Manhattan that does not already have a Starbucks.Although not a regular, I agree with another review; it's cramped and conversation from other tables during the busy hours bleeds over uncomfortably.Overall, try it and see for yourself.",,,

176,Ed R.,"Long Island, NY",23,80,15,4.0,8/12/2014,"Stopped in for a late dinner on Saturday night and now I am a big fan of Georgio's. The service was amazing. Super attentive and always refilling water and checking in to make sure that everything was OK. Our waters were always full and when I finished my beer the waiter was on it asking if I wanted another one. The food was very good. I ordered a stark and it had a lot of flavor, cooked right and juicy. The mashed potatoes were thick and creamy. There was a mountain of green beans that had a little butter and garlic. The portions were huge and we left stuffed. This will become a regular local stop for a quick bite.",2,,

He served us drinks as we were waiting for our new table to be ready.  We were seated in the back and ordered right away.  The omelettes were VERY good especially the home fries.  I LOVED my omelette with goat cheese and def recommend this one.  Other highlights were the vegetarian sandwich, breakfast burrito, and FRESH JUICE yummmm.  I did not give 5 stars because my friend who ordered a bloody mary said it was really not good and she didn't even drink half of it.  When we got our bill we were surprised how cheap it was compared to other spots in the city!!Food is great, The PRICE IS RIGHT and the service was so fast!  If you want a solid cheap breakfast place this is your go to.",,,
179,Matt G.,"Boulder, CO",64,413,11,2.0,10/2/2014,"This place SUCKS.  I'm not sure who snapped those pictures, but that's not the food I got.  First, the place is a little dirty and decrepit.  Secondly, the omelette I got looked like it got run over by a car.  Flat, not at all fluffy and just thrown on the plate.   Home fries were greasy and tasteless.  Coffee was just average diner-style coffee.  How do you give someone with a dry and rubbery ""Everything"" bagel jelly to put on it?  How about cream cheese?I'm losing faith in NYC.  Have yet to have that GREAT breakfast here.  This place ranks among the lowest on a very average list of places I've eaten here.AVOID",1,,

186,Denice C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",96,101,18,3.0,7/20/2014,"This little grilled made for a good weekend afternoon breakfast. Very casual place.  They have a variety of brunch items. Everything from the typical to their personal specialities, to a few items on the healthier items.  Each of the brunch items comes with fresh juice and coffee or tea. I ordered the egg white omelet with chicken (big enough for the two of us eaters to share), and it came with the most perfectly cooked home fries and toast. The BF ordered the stake and eggs, He was happy with it, but i felt like the steak could have been more flavorful, but it was surely not bad. I also really wanted to try their whole wheat, strawberry, chocolate chip pancakes and the waitress allowed me to order just one! It hit the spot perfectly. I will surly be adding this to the local rotation.",1,,
187,Brian M.,"Jersey City, NJ",192,569,581,4.0,4/5/2012,"Hmmm...I guess I'm a fan?The only things I don't like about this place are how the tables are so crammed together...and the last time I went, they put a party of 2,426,043 side by side...which cut the whole place in half South to North.The other thing is...getting the check. Both times I've been here, it takes forever to pay.But if you flag anyone down, they'll handle you even if they weren't serving you.AWESOME menu. So good.You need to have the tender chicken wrap...your life depends on it.Pancakes are awesome too and the sangria is pretty good, but pretty small...still...pretty good.If you get to choose your seats when you come in, choose wisely.Bathroom is in the back.FYI.",3,1,

Honestly I love everything about it starting with the energy eluded from the waiters, customers, food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverages.  The witty banter with the waiters alway make our morning slash afternoon. The food is delicious and you can always ask for substitutions with no added BS.  I always try what others get but always end up ordering the florentine eggs Benedict with tomato slices (anti-gluten snob) and have NEVER regretted it. I'll be back obviously! PS - the wait is never what it's stated to be.",1,,

It does get pretty crowded, but luckily we didn't wait more than 5mins for a table. Staff is super friendly and the owner (I THINK that's who he is) seems to make good friends with regulars.My husband had the standard eggs-bacon-home fries-toast combo. I had the CORNED BEEF HASH with eggs, home fries and choice of bread. Both our meals were satisfying. I wasn't a fan of the home fries but my husband was. They were a bit over-seasoned and mushy for my liking.Overall, this was a nice place to walk to from our apartment for a comforting breakfast.",,,
