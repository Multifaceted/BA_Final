0,Gaby L.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,49,20,5.0,8/25/2018,"We order Bahn Mi and the Fresh Spring from Henry's several times a month.  The bread has the right texture and crunch, their pickles and vegetables are just right and the grilled pork and grilled chicken are so tasty!  Plus, their sandwiches are a bargain!   Half a sandwich can fill me up, but it is so tasty that I sometimes end up eating the whole sandwich in a sitting.If you want bubble tea, they have excellent bubble tea as well.  There is a minimum amount if you want to pay by card. I am so happy that Henry's is in South Slope!",,,
1,Emily C.,"Arlington, VA",1,39,4,3.0,10/31/2018,"Bahn mi is one of my favorite foods and I was so excited to try this place out based on the great reviews. This review is based more on the delivery service than the food (3 stars because the food was good). I placed an order on Seamless and the food was scheduled to be delivered between 7:35-7:45. 8:00 rolls around so I decide to call and check the status. The person who answered said they had ""missed the order and would get it out to me as soon as possible"" (no apology given which I thought was rude). Another 35 minutes rolls around...still no food. I called AGAIN to check the status and was told ""it's out for delivery"". Again, no apology given. The food was pretty good. Better than other bahn mi places in the area, but to me, customer service is everything. When ETA of delivery is 30-40 minutes and almost 2 hours later your food arrives, that's just unacceptable. I might be willing to try this place again, but certainly not through delivery!",,,

3,Kyle T.,"Queens, NY",197,41,82,4.0,3/25/2018,"Solid great Bahn Mis at this little hole in the wall shop. Good bubble tea too. Place is a small but there are a few seats. Went here before too and got the shredded chicken bahn mi for dinner as well as a summer roll. Took off a star for the summer roll because it's a little on the bland side but I can see how it would feel refreshing on a hot summer day. Everything else was awesomeAlso, be aware that they have a card minimum of $8. Easy to meet but good to know in case u only wanted a drink",1,,

6,Diana B.,"New York, NY",82,56,199,4.0,4/21/2018,"One of my favorite places in Brooklyn to get a Vietnamese sandwich. I usually come and get an extra spicy shredded chicken sandwich. Bread is always crunchy on the outside soft on the inside. Perfect amount of chicken and pickled vegetables. Even when I ask for extra spicy, it doesn't overpower the taste of the sandwich. Would definitely recommend this spot.",,,

8,Walter A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,6,5.0,7/8/2018,"This bubble tea and Bahn Mi sandwich shop is well run and efficient. The dining area is smaller than most but the delivery and to-go traffic is steady- attesting to the quality of the products!Our favorite meals from Henry's are the sandwiches of meat or vegetarian-meat-substitutes, the vermicelli salad with minced pork, the Pho and the summer rolls (shrimp and crisp greens and rice in a rice skin wrap - with marvelous peanut dipping sauce!)On days where I want a caffeine fix but like an alternative to a latte, few things please like a bubble/milk tea from Henry's.The staff here are 'salt of the earth' lovely people and this shop, treasure that it is, deserves your patronage!",,,

12,Zi C.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,39,17,4.0,2/20/2018,Had the Grill chicken Banhmi. The chicken was very tasty. Probably one of the best I had. Small family run piece. Will try their pho one day.,,,
13,Emily S.,"North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",280,100,1,4.0,5/1/2017,Great bahn mi! I got a spicy tofu bahn mi and it was certainly spicy! The flavor was also great too! My brother and fiance both got the grilled bahn mi and thoroughly enjoyed their sandwiches as well. Nice inexpensive prices and quick service too.,2,,
14,Daisy T.,"Flushing, NY",123,15,25,1.0,12/28/2017,"I went here in October and never went back again. I don't know how their sandwiches are but I know their Pho is not the real pho. I live in Flushing so I know. The noodles they use is the thick tasteless Chinese rice noodles. I ordered grilled pork pho and that was a HUGE mistake. Their idea of grilled pork is Chinese cha siu(roast pork) and heating it up in the pan again like ""it's grilled"". Worst $9-$10 spent...especially since I can get a huge bowl for about $8 in Flushing and Chinatown, but I work in Brooklyn. I go to another place now around the area for their viet food which is much better.",,,
15,Thuy V.,"Fairfax, VA",58,606,495,4.0,5/2/2017,Really small basic shop but good bubble tea. I got the taro milk tea with bubbles. They were soft and chewy in a good way. A few people got food too. Credit card 8 dollar minimum.,,1,

17,Heather S.,"New York, NY",563,362,80,5.0,3/12/2017,My go to Boba spot. I love their Boba and I love their sandwiches. I also enjoy their pho. The best thing about Henry's is besides the fact they're like right near me and always consistent. I've never ordered anything from there that I didn't like. I just wish they could mix flavors of their fruit smoothies like mango strawberry instead of just ordering mango or strawberry.,1,,
18,Jesse R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",117,464,19,4.0,2/12/2016,"There's another similar joint in the area that gets all the hype, but this will be a place that I come to more often not after having had a good meal here.Had the tofu pho. It as a very generous portion, served piping hot, and fast without any elbow jostling or ""am I in your way?"" dance of other neighborhood spots.I'd go back.",2,1,1
19,Jolie H.,"Lancaster, PA",0,20,0,5.0,6/17/2017,AMAZING! Ordering from here again!Coffee is almost too good & they use soy milk.They offer veggie options for just about everything on the menu.AND they delivered my food in half the expected time.,1,,
20,Gessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,224,1619,2.0,3/25/2015,"I was hoping to find a fav summer roll spot a short walk from home. So I tried Henry's and I am sorry to say that I was disappointed.I found the roll to have too much rice vermicelli versus greens and shrimps.But most of all the smell coming from the shrimps was not good. I might give it a second try, maybe going during the morning instead of a late afternoon, but I am not sure.Price $4.50 for the two rollsService ok, not the most smiling guys but Ok.Please, Please increase quality so I'll come and see you often!",,,

Updated review","I still am keeping the 4 stars because their bahn mi sandwiches are exceptional but I wanted to make note of their summer rolls. Summer rolls- BAD!I ordered it for the first time a few days ago and I was disappointed because there was hardly any vegetables in it. It was 95% vermicelli noodles, a sheet of Boston lettuce, a few piece of cilantro, 4 pieces of shrimp, wrapped in a rice-paper wrapper. Usually, it comes with sprouts, carrots, a few basil leaves, and cucumber... Also the peanut sauce that they serve it with is too thick, so it's hard to dip.",3,,2
23,Jenny N.,"Flushing, NY",7,24,59,4.0,10/10/2016,"After two days sick with a cold, I run out of food and went on Yelp to find a nice pho place. I'm used to Hanco's, but everyone here seemed convinced Henry's is better. Now I gotta say that decor-wise, Hanco's is like a cafe restaurant whereas Henry's is basically a tiny takeout space with a counter and a handful of chairs. But what Henry's lacks in real estate, they make up for in food and price. I ordered a Rice Noodle Salad for $6, and for an extra $2, they added grill chicken. I also got a pair of Summer Rolls to go for $4.50, and I love how they placed them on a foam tray, then secured that with plastic wrap. The noodles in the noodle salad were absolutely fresh and pleasant, even before I added the sauce. And even though I forgot to refrigerate the summer rolls overnight, they were still excellent when I had them for brunch. I'd go eat there more often if they had a bathroom.",,,
24,Namrata A.,"New York, NY",279,710,24,4.0,8/11/2016,Just moved to the neighborhood and had Henry's twice - tofu banh mi and tofu vegetable rice dish. I loved the banh mi it wasn't too greasy but there has to be a little bit more of seasoning on the tofu in general. You can't beat the friendliness and prices here.,,,
25,Lauren B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",542,152,314,4.0,6/20/2016,"Pretty decent bubble tea. I asked for half-sweet, but since they have the passion fruit part pre-mixed, it seems like all they could do was water it down. Bubbles were appropriately chewy, on the small side. Decaf tea still packed a little bit of a punch. Overall, decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back for the bubble tea.",,,1
26,Kate T.,"New York, NY",79,428,8,5.0,12/19/2015,"This is a review for Henry's takeout. I ordered their traditional Bahn Mi and Pho Bo. I was in Vietnam last week where I had Pho for the first time and theirs is spot on...so you could say my expectations were high! The broth is rich, and it comes with a container of rice noodles topped with the beef, another of fresh herbs and bean sprouts, and condiments--exactly how I'd eaten it in Ho Chi Minh City.The Bahn Mi was better than the one I had at Hancos a few weeks ago but a lot richer than the ones I ate in Vietnam; I never came across one that used mayo but it was absolutely delicious. The baguette is slathered with pâté, some mayo, and topped with Vietnamese ham and ground pork. On top of this is a lightly pickled cucumber spear and pickled carrots.Best Vietnamese I've had so far in the city.",1,,2
27,Alexandra S.,"New York, NY",406,137,225,5.0,10/7/2015,"From the first bite you'll be in heaven. The baguette is flaky and warm. The slaw is crunchy and fresh. Also the sandwiches take ""about 4 minutes"" to make so no ordering ahead necessary.Vegan Bahn Mi: They know what you gotta do. The sandwiches are vegan if you don't get meat, mayo, or butter. Just tell them and they will guide you. They suggested I get the Tofu because the others get too dry without mayo/butter. The Tofu is amazing - seriously. It was so good I got another sandwhich - this time I went for BBQ pork and to make it wetter I asked for sriracha. So damn yummy. I wanted pho but I was going to a party in an empty apartment. Bahn mi = portable, pho = not.Oh and my roommate asked about peanuts (she's allergic) and The classic doesn't have them.I have also heard the bubble tea is amazing. I just haven't had it.I wish Henry's was closer to the subway - I'd go all the time. For now I'll have to keep making up excuses to get to south slope.",3,,
28,Ben C.,"South Bend, IN",36,20,0,5.0,2/11/2017,"This place is cheap, it's tasty, and it fills you up. Pho is good, but I'm sure you've had better. Sandwiches are delicious. Be cautious when asking for spicy, because they don't play around. I really enjoy this place. Bubble tea is good. Give it a try. It's reasonably priced, so there isn't much risk involved. I love it.",,,
29,Luis B.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,304,254,4.0,1/21/2016,I love me some Pho soup and shredded chicken sandwich. it's always a toss up between Henry's and Hancos here in the slope but I have to say it never disappoints. Delivery is super quick regardless of weather!,,1,
30,h n.,"New York, NY",0,3,1,5.0,6/24/2017,"Great place for a simple banh mi sandwich. They're not trying mess with the original recipe and make it into something that is not. You'll get a delicious sandwich without the frills. I would like to try their pho to see if it's decent. They're not a pho joint, so I have low expectation. I can only comment on their sandwich since I'm not a fan of bubble tea. Odd mix in my opinion.",,,1
31,Emil D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,5.0,3/13/2017,Amazing food i get sandwiches from them at least twice a week. Always fresh and quick on delivery. I highly recommend that spot.,,,
32,Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",34,105,34,5.0,9/23/2016,I always come here with my boyfriend for their banh mi. We used to go to Hanco's but stopped due to the uncomfortable customer service. We drove by it once on our way to Hanco's and decided to give this place a try and see if it's better. Sure glad we did because this place is much better than Hanco's. Customer service is always friendly and our food was always on point. It is a pretty tiny shop with only a few seats but we always take out anyways so it's not an issue for us. Their banh mi is on par with the banh mi places out in Chinatown and that's why I am such a big fan. Their spicy is actually pretty darn spicy so beware! I live quite far so we do have to drive out here but it's well worth it. Will definitely keep coming back for our banh mi fix.,2,1,1
33,Denise P.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,375,245,5.0,9/6/2015,"There are 3 bahn mi shops on 7th ave between 9th & 15th. While each has a good sandwich, Henry's is the best. Just the right ratio of bread to veg to meat. Bread is always fresh and the stuffing is evenly distributed unlike Hancos, which puts all the meat in one side and all the veg on the other side. Henry's sandwich seems a little smaller than Hancos but it just tastes better. Also when you ask for spicy, Henry's does it right by adding jalapeño instead of just slathering on Siracha mayo. Skip the spring rolls - they're only so so - and save your appetite for the sandwich.",2,,2
34,Jaime G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,3,5.0,7/11/2015,"We have been loyal customers at Henry's ever since they opened. They have exceptional sandwiches that are made with fresh bread, which is delicious in every bite. The pho soup is great to have during the winter season and hearty in portions. Lastly, the bubble teas are just fantastic. When I first moved to NYC I could not believe  people had bubble teas that contained  tapioca; however, I have now been converted and am an avid bubble tea drinker because of Henry'sAlso, they have punch cards for their loyal customers and you get free sandwiches or bubble teas after you hit a certain number which you easily achieve because they are so delicious! Go there and be happy....",1,1,1
35,Brian V.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,71,57,4.0,8/3/2015,"Ordered delivery the other night when I was starving and wants something good and quick. I love banh mi and pho and have tried most of the delivery spots near by. Lotus has been my go to, and while their banh mi is good, the pho is just decent. To be fair, pho is tricky (some would argue impossible) to delivery. Henry's is very good! I got the classic sandwich, spicy, and the beef pho. The sandwich was perfect and the pho was surprisingly good. I'll definitely go back again.",1,,
36,Sigvard A.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,9,0,5.0,5/17/2016,Probably the best and cheapest Vietnamese place in Park Slope. Highly recommended if you're looking for something quick and delicious!,1,1,2
37,Diego R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,22,11,4.0,3/27/2016,Had an original sandwich and beef pho delivered. Both of the items tasted great and delivery during lunch was super fast. Highly recommended.,2,1,1
38,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,3.0,3/6/2013,"So, I've pledged my banh mi allegiance elsewhere in the area, but such pledges don't exactly stand a chance when laziness is a factor. And since Henry's isn't an extra five blocks away from my apartment, yeah, you do the math.Don't get me wrong - their Vietnamese Sandwich (I'm partial to the Shredded Chicken) is good, teetering on very good. If you like extra crunchy bread and loads of mayo, look no further, seriously. Personally, I prefer a tamer baguette, a notch or two down in the crunch department (and maybe a tick or two up in the pull department), and as much as I am an advocate for mayonnaise, the meat here is really slathered in the stuff. Flavor is not an issue as Henry's banh mi is no doubt delicious, but the texture headbutt between crunchy and creamy costs it a few points at the judges' table. Meanwhile, the Summer Rolls (those are the shrimp ones) seem catalogue-ordered standard-issue for Vietnamese joints in the area. Not that that's a complaint, really. I still enjoy 'em.Be forewarned, the hole-in-the-wall spot is a little dingy and as character-vacant as stepping into an abandoned, unplugged refrigerator. For whatever reason, the whole place has smelled like seafood lately even though there's very little seafood even on the menu (aside from the aforementioned Summer Rolls, there's a Sardine Sandwich and a Vegetarian Fish Pho, whatever the hell vegetarian fish is). What I'm trying to say is that Henry's isn't exactly a ""dine-in"" type of establishment, despite the couple of tables, counter seating, free wi-fi, and stacks on stacks on stacks of magazines. I mention this all, but none of it has ever really stopped me from grabbing a banh mi to go, so I guess that's gotta say something of their product, right?Anyway, Henry's, as Bruce Springsteen once gruffed, ""You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright."" I believe he was talking 'bout a girl, though, and not a Vietnamese sandwich joint. Really can't be too sure.",3,5,2
39,Elisa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,93,13,5.0,4/20/2016,I am a big fan of the Vietnamese sandwiches here. So tasty and you can't beat the price!,1,,
40,Cerca T.,"Brooklyn, NY",685,209,488,4.0,11/20/2014,"This place is cheap and fast for a solid banh mi. Always delivers on taste (this is a saucier banh mi, for those that are used to crispier, drier ones), although rarely do they give you enough jalapenos for spiciness. Still, will come here religiously for a filling nomwich.I would, however, advise against the brown rice dishes. I've had the grilled pork over brown rice and it's just terribly reheated, dry and chewy and the flavor is whacked out and weird. Just not that appetizing.BANH MI SO HUNGRY RIGHT NOWWWW thinking about Henry's.",6,6,8
41,Julissa M.,"Manhattan, NY",13,5,0,5.0,3/5/2016,"Best Vietnamese sandwich in the area. The staff is super friendly and the kitchen is clean. It our go to lunch spot lately. The shredded chicken in my favorite, but my hubby is a big fan of the shredded pork.",1,,
42,Andrea F.,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",14,8,0,1.0,4/7/2016,"BROKEN GLASS IN MY SANDWICH! Ordered a regular bahn mi/classic medium spicy. The second I took a bite I felt something crunch and immediately spit out my food. There was a piece of broken glass in the bite I had taken. Didn't want to risk taking another as I didn't know if there was any more. I am really sad because now I have NOTHING to eat! Okay maybe I do but it isn't a bahn mi and it will never be from this place ever  again, sadly. Bye bye Henry.",,1,
43,Cheny N.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",207,121,113,4.0,4/14/2013,"I vote for Henry's over Hanco's in for sandwiches.  Both places are good.  However, I feel like Henry's sandwiches have better flavor.  The bread tastes better and the quality of the ground meat tastes better to me.if you want a place to hang out and sip bubble tea.. then i guess Hanco would be better.  I would go with Henry's for food.",1,,
44,Van I.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,13,21,4.0,5/29/2015,"This place is great!  The price makes me happy for the quality of food received.  The bread is nice and crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, just how I like it. I've had the BBQ pork sandwich here and the Grilled Pork sandwich as well. Both came out great and quickly too.I also had the kiwi tea as well as the lychee tea with boba. Both good but maybe a little too sweet.Small space and not a lot of seating if you plan on eating there.",,,

49,Tyler L.,"New York, NY",357,922,1278,3.0,6/6/2012,"I had the grilled pork with rice dish from here. It was a bit of a disappointment because this place does not have the normal grilled pork they grill themselves like a Vietnamese place should. They serve char siu instead.

Yet, even at such an economical distance, I think I shall return to Hanco's a few blocks down the road.Henry's has dropped the ball more than a few times in the past month for me (I tend to go there a bit). I've had more than one overly-milky coffee recently, but the real challenge are the sandwiches. The ""classic"" always tastes lopsided, as if all the flavor and ""spicy"" goes to one side of the bun - it's not made with love. The worst happened the other night. I swung by and grabbed a chix sandwich on wheat. The roll was STALE. I don't mean ""eh"" ... I mean STALE. How the thing didn't shatter when they cut into it is beyond me. I ate the innards (which were yummy) and threw the rest away.Some of you may be wondering: If you live so close to Henry's, why didn't you just return it? I live in a fourth floor walk-up. That's why.",1,6,1

52,Quevin D.,"South Slope, NY",2,9,5,2.0,5/26/2014,"I'm from the Pacific Northwest and I noticed that a couple different things about NY Vietnamese food. The coffee is pre- brewed (probably for convince) and spring rolls are called ""summer rolls."" I ordered a iced coffee and classic banh mi. I was initially turned off by the very vague names for the items on the menu like, ""chicken"" or ""pork"" banh mi.I paid $6 dollars which seemed reasonable but considering the flavor was lacking. The classic had ground pork which doesn't seem so classic to me, I'm use to the dat biet cold cuts. They gave me the option of spice level, I chose very spicy. I was upset to fit the spice to be no existent, a small line of sriracha at most. I would have preferred fresh chili peppers which is standard anywhere on the west coast. The pickled veggies were decent. The pate was bland and I couldn't taste the mayo. Although the bread wasn't a classic French bread baguette and more of a hero sub bun, it was perfectly toasted and had a nice chewy/ crunch ratio.Another thing that turned me off about Henry's was the fact that I say the guy preparing my food add a bunch of half and half to my iced coffee. The coffee tasted fine but this gives me suspicions that the recipe use aren't classic Vietnamese. Maybe it's a NY thing or a regional Vietnamese ( northern) thing? Overall all the factors to making a great sandwich add up to be quiet mediocre and faux banh mi in my book. If you're looking for a quick bite this place is decent. If you're looking for a legit viet sandwich, this place is faking it till they make it.",2,,
53,Clarissa S.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,42,51,4.0,4/28/2014,Great food. Order the summer rolls. Delicious! But tiny place so better for take out.Cons: Tiny space that's not really meant for eating at. Pros: Great food well worth it. They also deliver. This is right near my apartment and I love going here for my Vietnamese fix. I love their summer rolls and of course the Bahn Mi sandwich is yummy. Everything is very worth the price. I really recommend getting food here.Love Henry's! Great Vietnamese food!,2,,
54,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,3.0,9/18/2012,Unfortunately I've been hooked by the Vietnamese sandwich shop down the street and now I can't seem to shake it when I try Henry's.Henry's makes a pretty good banh mi (still a bit Americanized for sure) but still good and up to par with the one of whom I will not name down the street.Their bubble tea is pretty decent and they don't overwhelm you with the tapioca like some places do. Sad news is that this tapioca may be carcinogenic. Oh well. Still won't stop me! I love me some cancer chewy black sweet balls.I really enjoy the green papaya salad option they have. Its tart and slightly sweet and a bit salty and is refreshing although a bit redundant after a few chomps. Otherwise I am a loyal customer of the down the street franchise.

What's not to love about a somewhat healthy sandwich composed of fresh French bread, pickled veggies and tender marinated meat or tofu? So much to love...and typically for pretty damn cheap. Henry's. Huh. A few minor peeves...*Not that cheap: $6 for our Viet-sandwiches. Typically they can run half that, even in NY. *They are slathered with mayo. MAYO!? I've eaten banh mi all over the country, and never has it come standard with mayo. It went from moderately healthy to ""Big Mac cal-Status,"" quickly. *The bubble tea is made from powder (eh, ok) and a bit confusing to order. They don't ask if you want blended (I do) so I got a cup of mango juice on ice with tapioca, which is pretty gross. I ended up throwing the entire thing away and it was about $5. My guy pal went back inside to request a blended one...and they did so, but not before several rounds of ""what? huh?"" due to the language barrier. Not their fault, but perhaps making things very clear in this regard will help. On the plus side, the tapioca balls were quite fresh! The good: *Bread was very fluffy and sturdy, a difficult combination to master. I appreciate when I can eat banh mi and not have to douse myself in orajel afterwards. *Staff was friendly, takeout was pretty quick. There is very minimal seating (1 table, a few counter spots) so the best option here is order takeout and carry to the park, or order delivery. It's a bit overpriced for what it is, but it does in a pinch in Park Slope. I will find the best banh mi in NYC, and I will travel to achieve it. Suggestions welcome!",4,2,2

Updated review","So after months of deliberating, I realized that in the Henry's versus Hanco's battle. Hanco's wins on 2 things: pho and bubble tea. Although Henry's is cheaper on both accounts. Hanco's makes up for it with buy 9, get 1 free cards and much, much better beef pho. Actually even though Henry's is much closer to my apartment. I'll always make the walk to Hanco's. Also the cut of beef used in the pho at Henry's is just really chewy and the broth is just not as good.",2,1,1

I explained that I already touched the sandwich that was delivered to me (including opening up the sandwich).  They said that as long as I didn´t bite into it, they wanted it back.  When the delivery guy came, he could clearly see that I had touched the sandwich.

And it was delicious. So delicious. The meal cost me a mere 8 dollars or so, but that's because I decided to go big with my drink (water would do just fine).

Updated review","Update: so i went to hanco's yesterday to compare to my experience. let me just put out there that i am vietnamese and was born in a city where the vietnamese population is greater than NYC.in other words, i come from where actual vietnamese people make and serve the authentic vietnamese food. ***this review is based on the sandwiches only***the only real Vietnamese banh mi is the ""classic"" on the menu. all of the other options are American-invented. the classic banh mi from Henry's has that really flavorful pork and pate taste that i miss so much from my childhood. i always ask for extra cilantro with my sandwich as i am used to a lot. the french baguette is how it is supposed to be. crispy and flaky on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. THIS IS WHAT HANCO'S LACKS. the bread from hanco's was too crispy, falling apart and not at all soft on the inside. it actually hurt the roof of my mouth when i got through the sandwich. the pork wasn't as tasty and flavorful as henry's and thats just that. it's also 50 cents more per sandwich than henry's. Yes, hanco's is more attractive on the inside and inviting for you to eat in, but it always comes down to the flavor of the food to me.So, there's my take on the Hanco's vs. Henry's battle. Henry's takes the cake....or sandwich!Oh p.s. the original and jasmine green bubble teas are delish.",3,1,1

Delivery is friendly, timely and the sandwiches always come warm. I love the grilled pork sandwich. The pork is never dry and great ratio of bread, pickled veg and meat so that every bite has a little bit of everything. I also get the summer rolls but I will admit they're not even close to being the best. Like other Yelpers said, it's a little lettuce and a lot of vermicelli with the shrimp on top. It could definitely be better with some more variety in filling however, the peanut dipping sauce is delicious and why I can't help but go back every time.",,,

Additionally, I found the meat to be a bit dry.Another thing I'm not a fan of is the Thai iced bubble tea.

Yes, it's true they add Mayo to the classic- yet I see this as another plus.

The competitors are Home, Henry's and Hanco, all close enough to walk to, and all offering 'Classic' banh mi. First up was Home. A 10-15 minute walk later found us at Henry's.The smell of garlic hit us right in the nose when we walked in. So this sandwich is pretty much even with Home banh mi, but it's a nickel less. Like I said w/ Home, it's a four star sandwich w/ a one star deduction for price. Taste wise, the heat wasn't as even throughout compared w/ Home, but that's no big deal. The bread was less crustier than Home's if that matters to you. Home and Henry's are both evenly matched, but fall to Hanco due to Hanco being spicier and with better bread.",1,,

The bread here is a little lighter, the fillings a little bit more distinct, but it's opening day and I've a sample size of 1 so it's not exactly hard data.The menu's design and contents are conspicuously similar to that of their competitor's.  Prices are the same or a quarter or so cheaper, but there aren't any desserts sitting on the countertop and the space is much smaller.10% off today (opening day), and 10% off on takeout if you bring a menu (or at least bring the menus they're giving out for now).",3,,1
106,Scott K.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,18,3,4.0,6/6/2012,"So, for some ungodly reason, I had yet to try Vietnamese food, which is pathetic considering I've tried kangaroo, bear, horse, yak, and other various things before I had Vietnamese. Let's get to the review. Me and my friend were wandering around Park Slope and found this place randomly. The inside is small, only three little tables and a couple of stools by the window. But hey, I'm not one of those people obsessed with decor, I'm a fat man trapped in a skinny man's body, I'm about the grub. My friend, who has eaten plenty of Vietnamese food, recommended that I get a classic Vietnamese sandwich.This sandwich consisted of pate, vietnamese ham, roasted ground pork, mayo, butter, cucumber, julienne carrots, Daikon radish, and cilantro, served on a perfectly baked baguette. I had the option of 'regular' or 'spicy', and me being a spicy freak went to spicy. Our food came out quickly, within 5 minutes, and I delved in to my sandwich. It was a perfect combination of flavor, with no one ingredient overpowering the others. The cilantro was a crucial element and brought every flavor together, it flowed well. The spicyness was there, but because I'm a spicy fan I squirted some Sriracha on several bites. The sandwich could've used a little more meat, but I'm biased in saying that because I'm obsessed with meat. The overall flavor of the sandwich was perfectly fine without my desire of more meat, shoot, more meat maybe would've reduced the greatness of the sandwich. I just ordered a can of ginger ale, as bubble tea isn't my thing, I always get annoyed with the bubbles clogging up the straw then the bubbles stick to my teeth when I chew them. Ok, my little gripe about bubble tea was off topic, just felt like making a little sidebar to this review. Back to business.As far as the service is concerned, it's more like a cafeteria deal, not having a waiter/waitress. You order, you pay, they call out to you when your food is ready, done deal. But it seems like it was family run, and the woman behind the register was a sweetheart and all the staff I encountered seemed to be genuinely happy with working there. I will be back in the future, and I'm glad my first Vietnamese food experience was great, I'm hooked. I highly recommend checking the place out, you probably won't be disappointed, especially if you get one of their sandwiches.",,1,

Having just had my first Henry's bahn mi, the thought of the dozens of superior sandwiches I could have eaten over the past two months literally saddens me.Henry's ingredients are fresher, better, more generous and their taste can be appreciated individually as well as all together! Ever noticed how other bahn mi's have a rather strong funk to them? So strong that when you take one to go and walk around a bit with it in it's white plastic bag, you become self conscious of the smell exuding from it? Like so bad that it makes you want to reassure passersby, ""it's not me, I swear, it's my bahn mi!"" - Not with Henry's!! Yum.",1,2,2
108,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,23,0,5.0,10/1/2012,"This is my go-to lunch spot.  A cheap, delicious sandwich with a bubble tea or smoothie is the way to go.  They are crazy friendly, and if I am hungover and need them to deliver, they usually show up within 20 minutes.  Get a classic sandwich, medium, with a lychee smoothie.  You won't regret it.",,,
109,Lisa D.,"Brooklyn, NY",770,623,1083,4.0,5/13/2011,"After having consumed many mediocre or downright awful banh mis in this fair city (think stale or obviously frozen bread, chicken that looks like cat food, pâté that looks like dog food, the unpleasant addition of grey ham on grilled pork, etc.), I was starting to think that perhaps this sandwich was just not my cup of tea. Enter Henry's. With its freshly toasted, crunchy yet pliable baguette loaded with honey-glazed grilled pork topped with crunchy, fresh carrots and daikon and sprigs of cilantro, dotted with a dash of Sriracha in an amount controlled by me thanks to a helpful counterperson who had the foresight to ask whether I wanted it spicy, sans mayo at my perhaps sacrilegious request, this bahn mi won me over.  A Henry's bahn mi is in fact my cup of tea. And speaking of tea, I also had a cup of iced honey green tea which provided the perfect compliment to the sandwich and allowed me not to choke on the few drops of hot sauce I consumed. The bubble tea also looked excellent. I picked up a tofu bahn mi doused in Sriracha for my friend who was equally enamored.  Despite the hole-in-the-wall aesthetic of its exterior, Henry's interior was immaculate if cramped. Henry's does a huge delivery business and is also on Grub Hub. I'm glad I've found a reliable dealer, because I now have a new addiction.",6,5,5

111,Virginia G.,"Ellicott City, MD",57,155,4,4.0,1/22/2012,Consistent and good. We usually get the vegetarian pork banh mi on whole wheat. Food always comes quick and the place is always clean. Never had any complaints. Just wish there was a little more space to sit and eat.,,,1
112,Nicholas P.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,7,0,5.0,11/10/2012,Henry's is amazing. I have lived in NYC since 2011 and this is where I will go if I want the best banh mi I can find. It's small and you won't have a fancy table but it is the best banh mi. If you disagree I will fight you,,,
113,Kilgore T.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",8,26,0,5.0,1/18/2012,These sandwiches are like crack. Bubble tea is also great and you def get what you pay for. Awesome place.,,,1

115,Carlos C.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,558,36,3.0,4/18/2011,"It was definitely not the best banh mi. I ordered the shredded pork, it was more like chunks of pork, the fattiest and cartilage laden parts, not good, but the carrots and cilantros were definitely fresh. I had the lychee bubble tea, which was pretty good and cool (literally), not bitter nor super sweet. I love their super friendly service, the lady behind the counter, was attentive and made sure that I was satisfied. And they prepare it very quick, and the prices are frugal so that's a plus . Their pork banh mi wasn't the best I've ever had. Its an OK place, and I would recommend it for a quick bite or lunch. But three for their service.",2,,1
116,Sam J.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,44,4,3.0,4/2/2012,"Solid Bahn Mi. I got spicy pork medium heat, and really enjoyed it. Price is fair, but not as good as it gets for this type of vietnamese. No Bun Xiao on the menu is a bummer.The blended drinks are pretty meh.",,,
117,Julia M.,"Alexandria, VA",32,30,1,5.0,3/7/2012,"I'm so glad I picked up their menu while getting my bubble tea.  Gross weather, I wanted soup, and had napping baby at home so couldn't leave the house to get soup ingredients or pick up food.  So I ordered Pho, bubble tea, Viatnamese coffee, and veggie wraps.  Less than 20 minutes later, my food arrived.  So delicious, light, but filling.  I wish I didn't have to share with my little one.  Otherwise I would have eaten everything myself!  I can't wait to try their other food.",,,
118,Ruthanne S.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,4,1,4.0,4/28/2012,Henry's is my go-to place for pho in Park Slope. In my experience their banh mi has been tasty as well. Super fast delivery!,,,

So far, my loyalty lies with Home on 5th Avenue, but I kept seeing the $5.50 veggie sandwich sign outside Henry's, so I walked in and told the cashier that I couldn't decide between the tofu sandwich and the vegetarian chicken one. He suggested the vegetarian pork. GOOD CALL, CHIEF. I normally wouldn't go with the mock meats, but when in Rome, right? Damn straight.",2,1,1
121,Leo I.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,0,4.0,4/4/2012,"The sandwiches are very decent, and so are most of the other things I've tried there, such as salads and spring rolls.  My only gripe is that the drinks are absurdly overpriced, considering that they are always filled up with ice almost to the top.  Other than that,  for takeout and delivery I would pick Henry's over Hanco's any time.  Delivery is very fast.",,,
122,Joseph L.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,13,0,3.0,5/21/2013,"Great sandwiches. I'm a fan of the chicken and pork bahn mi. Friendly service and convenient as its on my block. Have yet to try Hancos, so no opinion on the controversy surrounding the 2 businesses.",,1,
123,Jack R.,"Lebanon, NH",1,1,0,2.0,10/30/2011,The boba tea is disgusting. The boba are way too sweet and hard. The mango smoothie was fake and sugary. The chicken sandwich was pretty good. The fresh rolls were decent but the sauce is like peanut butter and the rolls are bland without any sauce.,,,

The sandwiches are always made with fresh bread and fresh herbs. Result - tasty and convenient alternative to anything else available in 5 blocks radius for lunch. Don't be shy to order 'spicy' if you like a kick - they'll throw in fresh jalapeños for you.  The noodle salads are also good, simple and tasty.  The also deliver orders over $10 for free.",1,,

Updated review","Okay, they now have like four new veggie options. I've only tried two, but only because I'm totally stuck on the veggie ""pork"" one. Wish I could give that sandwich alone more than five stars.",1,,
128,Morigian B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,43,0,3.0,6/29/2010,"Good variety for the vegetarian crowd at this Vietnamese sandwich shop. I also like that they don't goop on the mayo. I was overjoyed when they started the punch card for bubble tea as I am an addict. However, I have noticed recently that they seem to be using fewer and fewer. Bubble tea is $4.25 their iced teas are $2. Which translates to $2.25 extra for those bubbles! In the past I came here expressly because they were generous with the bubbles, then they became average, but today, there were maybe 18 total in my cup. Not so happy. Over all the food is good, I'm hoping today's tea was a blip.",1,,

In my limited Banh Mi experience there is just something about the combination of the sandwich that is tasty, delicious. Henry's has no ambiance and the prices for the drinks are kind of steep. Would be curious to sample the Rice Vermicelli. Had a strawberry smoothie which had some stuff in it I could not identify (some component of the bubble tea perhaps?) Might have to give the vietnamese coffee a try.",1,,

Their delivery is quick and eating in store is fine too. I love the sign on their refrigerator that says ""Dissimilar Season/Same Great Taste."" Engrish FTW. I find the servers who speak English pleasant as well. Once I had a conversation with the lady behind the counter over the This American Life story. Whatever.

Updated review","So they now added even more vegetarian options besides tofu: veggie ham, chicken, fish and pork.  I know that fake meat isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I highly recommend the veggie ham sandwich.  It was delicious as a Vietnamese sammy.  Even my meat eater boyfriend thought it was tasty.  Good job, Henry's.  I want one right now!!!  Also, I must add how nice everyone is over there.  Very sweet employees.",2,,2

140,V F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,6,5.0,6/10/2013,incredible fresh food. their shrimp anything is amazing. also great vegetarian pho and vegetarian pork sandwiches. my husband and i order from here regularly - it is our go to for a weeknight to tired to cook dinner or anytime we are craving vietnamese which is a lot! highly recommended!!!,,,
141,Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",3,41,2,1.0,5/21/2012,"Argh, I hate dissing a small place, but the classic bahn mi from here was so inexcusably bad I had to take to the Internet to vent. The bread was dry and not fresh tasting and waaaay too big for the sandwich thus screwing up the filling-to-dough ratio from the start. There was maybe 1 sprig of cilantro inside, but a ton of bland carrots and one large chunk of plain cucumber and the pork/pate mix was just bad and crumbly, and there was no mayo or hot sauce or other condiment to at least partially tie together these bad ingredients. I couldn't get through more than 3 bites before I chucked the whole debacle into the trash. I just can't stand when it's obvious that something as seemingly simple as a sandwich was thrown together with no love or thought; it really chaps my hide. Sorry, Henry's, you won't be getting my business again. I'll make the annoying trek down to Sunset Park and give my money (much less of it, mind you) to Ba Xuyen instead.",1,,
142,Jesse K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,0,1.0,7/29/2011,"I went to Henry's and blindly enjoyed pretty much one item from every section of the menu. My roommate had suggested it and he too enjoyed it. However, right after eating I listened to the ""This American Life"" Episode entitled ""Million Dollar Idea."" I had actually heard a bit about what this episode speaks about previous to ordering but when I searched for the restaurants I found another place farther up in park slope and assumed this could not be it. Basically, Henry's opened up a few blocks away from another vietnamese sandwich place (Hanco's), took the other place's exact menu and charged less. The ""This American Life"" Episode explains it in further detail. I suggest checking out that episode, not going to Henry's, going to Hanco's instead (which is only a few blocks over). I actually think that Hanco's is more delicious anyway.",,,
