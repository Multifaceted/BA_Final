0,Libby B.,"Indianapolis, IN",146,488,2006,5.0,11/12/2018,"We were in the area after visiting the MoMA on a Monday and were hungry for a late lunch/early dinner so we headed here after doing some Yelp research. Upon entering, this place has a definite speakeasy vibe which we instantly loved! It's actually above ground (at least where we sat was), but once you make your way further in toward the back, it actually feels as if you're below ground. It was near Halloween, and the decor definitely lent a spooky vibe to the place. The cocktails are top notch. I really enjoyed the ones I had, and my husband got the Billy Club - a bourbon-based drink that is reminiscent of a Mint Julep but not quite. I don't recall every drink I had, but the cocktail list is thoughtful and fun. I love a good craft cocktail! The service is very friendly and attentive. We started with the everything pretzels as is our tendency, and the mustard dip was fabulous - tangy and the perfect match for the soft chewy pretzel sticks. I had the grilled shrimp tacos, and my husband got the pork tacos. I know they're a slightly unusual choice for this venue, but they were really well done! The shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the pork in my husband's tacos was moist. I also appreciated the 2 salsas that came with each. I would definitely visit again!",2,,1

2,Andy L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,18,0,4.0,11/3/2018,"Went on Halloween night without a reservation. Was expecting to wait for a while, but the doorman asked us if we wanted a table and we were seated right away.  Were thinking we made a mistake initially, as the front bar area was quite crowded and loud, but the noise died down quite a lot at our table out back. Had a charcuterie-board and some poutine. Picked radish and the board was unexpected. And good; can't remember ever eating radish slices by themselves. Plenty of meat on the board and plenty of fries and cheese in the skillet. Wish the had been some gravy. Service was good; friendly staff; nice vibe.  Would like to have tried more of the food.",,,
3,Deborah W.,"Manhattan, NY",209,122,212,3.0,10/12/2018,"I have been meaning to go to Tanner Smiths for a while now due to the fact I've heard such good things about their brunch. However, I haven't been able to go during mornings but was able to go with a friend on a Tuesday night which is the next best thing. My friend and I entered the restaurant around 7:30 PM. The place was pretty packed and so we waited around 20 minutes before we were given a seat. When the waitress took us to our spot we walked from the outside stairs down into the basement area. The area was definitely not as noisey as the upstairs but still high level of noise. We were seated in a large booth area that was more than enough room for two people. The area was dimly lit by candles and had a nice, romantic setting that is a great place to bring a date. The waitress came out right away to pour out our water for us and take our order. The glass was dirty so they got it switched right away. This was good example of how service was great and efficient. For our meal we got a few dishes to share: -NEW YORK STYLE POUTINE: Surprisingly yummy poutine. Though the cheese was more melted than curd-y. It was still a nice combination. The gravy was also appetizing and was a tiny bit too salty but not enough to overpower the dish. -MEDITERRANEAN MEZZE: A cute set up of grilled pita and dips. The hummus was pretty good. The white bean truffle dip was just ok. And the roasted eggplant dip was pretty good as well. -FALAFEL BUN: When I saw that the slider came in a bao bun I was kind of weirded out. And even though the falafel and sauce tasted good just did not work with the bao bun.All in all, a good experience and night. Though nothing too extraordinary that I would go back constantly but it was enjoyable!",4,1,3

We walked up and the place was packed and loud! not what we were looking for but we didn't have time to pick something else (he had to get to work in 2 hrs).  we asked how long the wait was and they surprisingly got us a table right away.  We made our way through the extremely crowded and noisy bar to the dining area in back.  ok...this is nice.  not crowded and  less noisy. I liked the menu options and the price was very reasonable (especially considering the location) we selected the following(1) Grilled Hanger Steak* ............................. 18Demi glace, brussels sprout hash, roasted fingerlingpotato, tarragon mustard(2) Mac 'n' Cheese .............................................. 14Gruyere, mozzarella, parmesan and jack cheeses, IPA batteredonion ringsI had a cocktail but hubby stuck with water (remember the approaching work thing)we had lovely conversation and enjoyed the atmosphere (which was a bit loud for the evening we had planned).45 minutes later...no food...our server came to us and apologized (we didn't say anything).  We did let her know that we were in a bit of a rush (work) and she said the food is on her way out.  she was kind enough to bring me a second cocktail on the house (she didn't charge me for the 1st one either)...excellent customer service...they didn't wait for a complaint...they made things right on their own! Bravo folks.food came and we had time to eat without rushing.  the food was EXCELLENT! like seriously delicious.  i will 100% return to this spot next time i'm in NY",6,,
5,Molly B.,"New York, NY",110,43,37,4.0,11/12/2018,"Love the cute prohibition vibe of this place! Great atmosphere. We went for brunch on a Sunday and it wasn't super packed which is nice, and they had a live jazz band! Food was alright; I had the eggs Benedict and it wasn't anything special. Would like to come back and try some more food options, as well as drink options. It looks like they have a pretty cool cocktail menu. The mimosas we had were $12 each which was a little pricey in my opinion, but it is midtown Manhattan.",,,
6,Tracey A.,"Marin County, CA",297,1261,1571,4.0,9/24/2018,"At lunchtime Tanner Smiths feels very much like a place for people who are in the area on business.  The restaurant is dark in decor and feeling, without windows to bring in natural light, and somehow the flavor profiles of the food here match that feeling.  My friend's Grilled Pastrami Rueben featured thick-cut, house-brined pastrami and house-cured sauerkraut.  Though neither of us warmed to the flavors of the sauerkraut I felt that those flavors were very much in tune with the overall menu offerings.  That is: there's a flavor profile that's being consistently applied here and I admire the discipline that takes.  A Maple Bacon Frisee Salad ($14) felt like a salad for a cold day.  Featuring ""crispy"" poached eggs wrapped in some sort of batter then sauced, the mix of hearty components made for a very East Coast version, different than salads found on the West Coast.  Of course, during this visit, it was about 100 degrees outside but I was headed directly from lunch here to a flight home so that fact mattered little other than that I do think - for lunch - Tanner Smith's would be a better fit come winter.  Hearty food, uniquely interpreted; if it's ""coat"" weather outside, head on in to Tanner Smith's.",12,11,11
7,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",153,765,9976,5.0,9/24/2018,"I made a reservation via Yelp last week for lunch today. I added in the special notes that I wanted to be seated at the cushioned booth table. When I arrived, the hostesses pointed out that my friend moved...lol apparently he moved 3 times. My friend and I both ordered the Grilled Flatiron Steak Sandwich without portobello and with fries...one was medium and one was medium well -- moi yoWoah baby this was such a delicious sandwich and along with these crunchy fries mmmmmOur server Catherine was very attentive and always had a smile on her face that's a plus for me. Definitely need to come back here for lunch and brunch!",11,5,12
8,Don N.,"Pearl City, HI",136,219,515,4.0,8/25/2018,"This review is for their breakfast which we were grateful to find after flying all night to get to NYC. Located close to our hotel, we walked over around 8:30 am and there were only a couple of diners in the restaurant at this early hour. Food: Coffee and an Irish Breakfast sounded so good as I looked over the menu. The Irish Breakfast was so good, two perfectly cooked eggs with a grilled tomato and mushroom, bangers, Irish bacon, beans, black pudding, and toast. Hearty, hot, and delicious it was the perfect meal to refuel before we started our fun day. We also ordered the scrambled egg tacos served with a couple tasty salsas. Service: Great service, our waitress had a charming Irish accent and checked on us frequently. There were only two other parties in the restaurant at the time but they never forgot about the diners as they were busily setting up for the day.Atmosphere: Great space though it is a little tough to judge in the early morning hour. Loved the use of the old liquor bottles being used as water bottles at each table. Value: Decent value for breakfast, my full Irish Breakfast came in at $17 which is fare for the amount of food and the location of the restaurant.  Overall: I would have liked to return in the evening to try some of their cocktails and evening fare but unfortunately it was a short trip and we were able to return. If you're hunting for breakfast and want something a little different I'd definitely recommend Tanner Smith's",4,2,3
9,Melissa C.,"Hicksville, NY",8,4,16,5.0,10/28/2018,"I loved the environment of Tanner Smiths! I went for ""brunch"" at 2pm on a Saturday and the place wasn't that busy. A big perk of this place is they take reservations! So its great for larger groups. Their brunch menu has a nice mix of typical breakfast foods and lunch foods and there was a lot to choose from. I chose the Shrimp & Grits and it was delicious and filling! I could barely finish it all! The location of Tanner Smiths is great also if you're in midtown or near Central Park. Prices aren't too crazy, most meals between $15-20 which I consider average for NYC. You get a good portion so I feel like my money was well spent. 10/10 would recommend and planning to go back!",1,,

12,Eric U.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,66,546,4.0,8/2/2018,"I've been to Tanner Smiths a couple of times to catch up with old NYC friends. It's conveniently located near Columbus Circle, making it a breeze for the former work posse to schlep their butts over for Miller Time.Although there aren't any happy hour specials here, this spot really draws in a lot of the after work midtown crowd.  And because of its proximity to Times Square, a lot of out-of-towners drop in as well.  Tanner has a bit of a speakeasy feel--dimly lit, dark wood, antique decor.  The mixed drinks are strong and tasty.  On my last visit, we shared a whole bunch of apps: fried cheese curds, egg plant chips, and the buffalo chicken spring rolls.  All great, especially with our drinks.Our server was extremely attentive and made sure our group was always attended to, even after the place started getting packed.  We did quite a few rounds of shots-- a few of them on the house.  You can't beat that!Later in the evening, Tanner takes on a more sexy feel.  Even more dark and candle lit.  It's always a good time watching couples on their first dates.  Especially, when they're awkward-- I can say that because I've been on quite a few of them myself.  I look forward to my next visit.  Thanks, Tanner!",3,2,4
13,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",340,105,155,5.0,9/2/2018,"This is probably my favorite place for a sit-down brunch in this neighborhood. I love that there's live music on weekends. The restaurant is huge and the decor is old-school NY (think a lot of portraits and maps of NY in the 1800s). The portions are also a good size and they have the best fries. I went with the salmon eggs benedict--so good and so filling. We loved our server/the other staff. They always made sure we had a full water flask, and they were very attentive with clearing the table when one of us finished eating (sometimes a bit too attentive--felt a bit like we were being rushed to finish!). Otherwise, would really recommend this place for brunch on the weekend. Their coffee is pretty good too!",,,

15,Katherine G.,"Patchogue, NY",223,118,51,3.0,11/5/2018,"Came here to eat before a show around 530pm on a Saturday night got a table for two right away. The restaurant is pretty large but the tables are tiny. The service... well it could have been better. The server was alittle stand offish. We ordered our drinks and she said ""water is on the table"" and left. A better server would have poured the water for us and maybe recommend an entrée. But hey maybe I just have high standers being a previous server. I ordered the Smoked Pork Taco, very good and had a lot of favor. My date ordered the crispy chicken tenders.. which didn't look that great and was basically just what it was.. chicken tenders. Overall it was a nice place, definitely would come back to try their cocktails over the food though.",2,1,1
16,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",201,204,584,4.0,10/3/2018,"This was actually my second time visiting Tanner Smiths but I had such a great experience on both occasions I knew I couldn't let this review slip away! Located next door to PHD Midtown the spot is conveniently situated between two subway lines so it's less than a five minute walk once your off the metro. A networking event brought me here for my second visit, but the experience I had will definitely keep me coming back.The spot itself encompasses a pretty large space. The first floor is dimly lit and contains a sweeping bar on the left and high top tables on the right. In the back are tables for dine in service, as well as additional space to enjoy your drinks. It definitely has more of a casual, rustic feel in terms of the interior design. All the surfaces and seats are made out of varnished wood which gives the entire place a clean cut feeling.The event I attended was downstairs in the sub-level space. Another large area that has a main bar which services two different area's of the floor. While we were here the bartenders were attentive and sociable. The drinks I had were spot on and their specialty items (TRY the winona) were also something to be appreciated. They served a variety of small appetizers which were also really good! There were too many to account for but all in all I didn't have one thing that was questionable (I'd definitely give their food menu a good look through).Overall a beautiful space and awesome service definitely has me bookmarking this spot as a casual place to enjoy a few drinks with friends who may work around here. I'd definitely suggest trying it out if your looking for more of a laid back feel while enjoying your post-work cocktail.",2,1,
17,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",198,504,1567,4.0,7/21/2018,"Came here without a reservation for lunch at noon on a weekend and we were able to get a table for 4 adults + 2 kids. The majority of their seating is in the back of the restaurant. They pulled 3 tables together and all of us were very comfortable. They only had one high chair at the time but they were going to ask their sister restaurant for one, they kept us updated about the status of the high chair but after about 30-45 min, they told us they weren't able to get one. Which was fine. I am glad that they tried and kept us updated about it. The AC worked well and we were very comfortable in the restaurant. They also had live music/performance out in the front.I had the skillet baked pancakes which I thought was excellent. I ate it without the whipped butter and still thought it was excellent. The edges were crispy. The marmalade + maple syrup + dusted sugar wasn't too sweet or overpowering. The texture was soft.The service was excellent. I found the place to be quite baby friendly.I would definitely come here again. You can come here with a group of 10 and it would be okay but come early so you won't have to wait in line.",2,,
18,Melody S.,"CA, CA",15,15,3,4.0,11/6/2018,Vanessa was amazing.  Great at her job and very friendly.  This place is definitely a hot spot.  Would recommend it highly.  I had the lamb burger and it was very tasty.  My husband had the flatiron steak and enjoyed it as well.,1,,

Even at 10pm on Friday, it wasn't tooooo loud or crowded, and my group had a super fun time.

21,Monica C.,"Long Island, NY",19,49,21,4.0,10/30/2018,"Tanner Smith's a wonderful gem in an otherwise boring midtown scene. It's a large, dark, casual bar with several rooms and two floors. On weekdays, it gets pretty packed and loud with the after work business scene. We walked in as a group of 5 on a Saturday evening and were seated in the front bar/lounge area right away without reservations. They went all out and have some spooky decor up for Halloween and we were all about that. The drinks were pretty good 4/5 but I didn't like them as much as some of the high end speakeasies in the city. We got a bunch of apps to share and those were great. The eggplant chips were just as good as the ones I've had in Spain and the buffalo spring rolls, cheese curds, and truffle fries were all quickly devoured as well. I really have to give them credit for excellent service. The hostess was really friendly, the coat check is free, and each plate & cup was cleared as soon as it was empty. A friend dropped a fork and someone knocked my purse off the back of my chair when walking by and a waitress/host was there a second after both incidents to pick them up. I'll definitely be back for more food and to try other drinks.",1,1,1
22,Merrill R.,"Austin, TX",0,2,0,5.0,10/27/2018,"Loved the ambiance, music, and crowd in this place!!While visiting my best friend who just recently moved to NYC, we stopped into Tanner Smith's for a night cap. We went in around 11:30 and there were a ton of people in the bar. We ordered drinks and went downstairs, and ended up loving it so much that we stayed out much later than we intended. We each had drinks - the Cotton Club and the Billy Club(?). They were so good and we enjoyed it so much we ended up ordering another round of them, and staying until about 2:45 in the morning. Great spot for a night cap with your girlfriends!",2,,

Waiter was sooooo nice but forgot his name. Had the amazing chicken wings app perfectly smoked lightly charred with dipping Siracha  aioli sauce. I haven't had duck in years but the duck sandwich  on ciabatta bread with cashew spread and sour marmalade sauce is to die for. Duck is lightly charred on outside and soft and juicy inside. My husbands Reuben sandwich was perfect and best he's had! Loved this place. Hostess greeted us right away when we came and also said bye when we left. Truly great service here.",1,,
24,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,4.0,6/4/2018,"A friend of mine chose this venue for his birthday, this past weekend. It was a large group of us, about 30 or so, of us. The staff was gracious and set us up with the lower basement area. We had four tables provided to us, which was an ample amount of space. I would describe the lower level as more of the restaurant area, and the upper level as the bar/lounge.Atmosphere: the crowd upstairs was more of a younger crowd, they seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. I struggled to make my way through the crowd due to excitement of ABBA and The Bee Gees. Yes, it took me about two songs to navigate my way from the basement to the exit, it wasn't too bad, but did inadvertently get hit the face due to a wild dancer.Food: I wasn't very hungry, but I looted for the beef sliders ($15) and macaroni and cheese ($14) which came with three onion rings on top.Sliders: 3 out of 4, they were average, I didn't care too much for the breadOnion Rings: 3 out of 4, it was standard, nothing over the topMacaroni and Cheese: 3.5. Initially I thought they made a mistake, it didn't look like Mac and cheese at all. It looked like sponge cake or Dulce de leche. I plucked around with the fork, and it was actually pretty good.Service: our server was pretty cool, sometimes she was hard to find, but it was understandable because she had our large group and I believe she was assisting with another large wedding group on the opposite side.Overall, nice location for various types of events, good selection of diverse music, and fair prices. I would definitely return here.",3,2,2

Updated review","*UPDATE* Came for brunch on a Sunday and it was great! Tanner Smith's has live jazz brunch on Saturdays and Sunday which we thoroughly enjoyed. I had only visited for their amazing cocktails prior, but when looking for a brunch spot in the midtown area this place was Yelp suggested and I couldn't resist.I ordered the pancake in a skillet and it was a sweet treat indeed! Was piping hot when it was served, and was accompanied by blueberry marmalade, fresh whipped cream and maple syrup - yum! We also ordered the Mac and cheese (ok, we didn't have the most healthy brunch but it was delicious) which was sooooo cheesy. It was served with 5 beer battered onion rings, another indulgent treat.We kept it light with the drinks, ordering cider and riesling. Our waitress was fantastic, super pleasant and friendly. Looking forward to trying dinner next!",1,,1
27,Estelle Z.,"Houston, TX",220,113,418,4.0,6/19/2018,"Great place for live jazz over brunch! The band will play from 1130-230pm daily and sometimes on weekend nights. They serve drinks in the pretty tea kettle! It's a must get when you hang with your fav brunch girl squad:)Food portion was usually pretty big so def great value.Flatbreads (tried a few flavors) were good there and very easy to share. Avocado toast was ok.Benedict was ok.Baked eggs were pretty good, could be a bit heavy for the first meal but depends on personal preference:) In general, def one of my fav brunch places! Will visit again:)",1,,
28,Kyle C.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,214,230,5.0,5/29/2018,"I visited Tanner Smiths two straight mornings (afternoons really lol) for breakfast. I love the ambience and the charm of the place. The staff is very friendly and the live music on Sunday was a nice touch! It's in midtown on 55th, an easy walk from Times Square and HK. The Irish folks on the staff are fun to talk to and I love the welcoming friendly atmosphere. They go out of their way to talk to me. Being a solo traveler and solo diner these are things I notice. The Irish breakfast was excellent. I will go back again and again for that. Reminds me of the UK and it's so uncommon to find back home that I always order it when I travel. It's a platter of food but perfect after a night of drinking.",3,1,2
29,Cristina T.,"Wellington, FL",13,16,0,5.0,10/28/2018,"Fun place with great food. Shared three ""small"" plates with my sister and it was delicious. Servings were generous. We had the cheese curds which are paired with a sauce and apple slices which are a wonderful combination. The zucchini chips were perfectly paired with honey. Lastly the crispy chicken tenders were a good portion of real chicken breast tenders that also had a great dip as well. Our waitress was very nice and on point the entire night. Unfortunately I don't remember the exact name of my drink but I know the word cotton was in there. It was also great!!!! If you're looking for good food and drinks in a funky setting this is the place!",1,,
30,Jolene H.,"New York, NY",7,135,51,3.0,10/26/2018,"Hanger steak was prepared as requested, but needed salt. The brussel sprouts, too, were tender and crispy but needed a bit of sodium. The mustard sauce and potato wedges included were meh.Pesto chicken pizza was more of a crispbread. It wasn't particularly tasty - kinda bland with a dry crust and light cheese. I'd skip on it next time. The bar was popping at 6 pm. Very loud music and a lot of hoopla made it almost unbearable. Dinner seating in separate spaces was still loud. Plus the server(s) were frazzled, so our check took 20 minutes to settle. Visited because we had a show at Carnegie Hall. Can't recommend that you go out of your way for it, but it's a fair pre-show option. The take-away here is that you get a pretty meal with pub-ishly large servings that need flavor.",1,,
31,Charisse S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",130,192,359,4.0,6/25/2018,"I'll admit that I did not expect much of this restaurant due to the location. I assumed it was going to be a tourist trap with overpriced mediocre food. I couldn't have been more wrong. The prices were reasonable (at least for brunch) and they had a very cool menu that features boozy teas and fancy teapots and teacups to go along with it. At one point they had a live band playing in the front. As for the food, I have to say I wasn't crazy about the way they make the Eggs Benedict. It's put on two slices of dry toast. It doesn't go down very easy. Before I decided on the eggs benedict I considered getting the baked pancake. The waitress suggested we get it for the table and share, which turned out to be a great idea. It has a similar consistency to bread pudding and is almost dessert like. Since most of the brunch dishes are savory it's a great way to balance by having the pancake as well.I'm more than happy to return and try some of their other options. Everyone else liked their meals in my party. I also should point out that this a great space to rent out for an event or have a birthday brunch. There's a lot of space and I like that it never got too loud even when they were at capacity.",,,1

33,Michelle T.,"San Francisco, CA",631,357,1115,4.0,5/11/2018,I came here just to grab drinks at the bar with my boyfriend. The setting was really great and it had a very classy/dim decor. The cocktails menu matched the ambiance and there are some pretty cool drinks on there such as the Last Tai which comes in a tiki-looking container. My boyfriend and I ordered a moscow mule and two drinks from the specialty menu (their names escape me but I posted pictures). The drinks were very well executed and delicious - service was pretty fast and simple since we were one of the only few customers at the bar. My only complaint is that the bartender seemed a bit impatient with us when we were trying to decide on what to order. She also kind of expected us to have immediate answers as to what we liked to drink; I'm definitely not as well versed in alcoholic drinks as I would like to be so I kind of wish she took the time to explain a little bit what the drinks we were interested in would taste like. I really want to try the food here so I'll definitely be back.,2,2,4

I had my favorite, The Last Word. It's not on the menu but they made it perfectly. I got a flatbread and it was so good, really thin crust that wasn't overdone and so much cheesy deliciousness. Yummmm. The service was attentive and friendly. Great place to hang and have a few drinks.",,,

Updated review","Came back on a friday evening and this place was popping. Easy to get to the bar still and grab a drink. Bartenders are quick to see you wanting to place an order. The moscow mule was right on point, served in a copper cup. I ordered their Winona, and they recommend letting the smoke infuse into the drink for at least 2 minutes, but I recommend longer b/c after 2 minutes I still had a hard time tasting the smokiness. It's also a bit too sweet for me.For food, I was surprised by their Roasted Cauliflower. The watermelon curry together with the pickled lime aioli sauce, allowed each aspect of the dish to shine and it was so delicious. My friend and I gobbled it up right away! I would totally order this again in the future. The pepperoni flatbread was ok, and I liked that it was spicy, but it was a bit burnt on the edges. The atmosphere, music, service, and food is great. You will definitely see me coming back in the near future!",4,1,1
37,Martha C.,"Valdosta, GA",0,13,23,4.0,11/17/2018,Very friendly server. We got the Poutine (enough for 3 people to enjoy) and Smoked Salmon Benedict which was beautiful and tasty. We enjoyed our brunch a lot!,,,
38,Thomas D.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",104,61,17,5.0,8/23/2018,"Yes, yes, yes. What a great spot. The food was delicious, the drinks were great (I got a Bee's Knees), and the ambiance was amazing. We had a group of 4 for brunch and we were all very pleased! I'm not sure if it's every week but they had a live jazz band, who were equally as great as the restaurant. We will definitely be back again soon!",1,,1
39,Jeff E.,"Houston, TX",58,95,1,5.0,11/14/2018,The cutest freaking thing about this place is how it's set up and the atmosphere. I really REALLY drank a lot of cocktails!! Definitely worth the scout out if you're in the cocktail scheme,,,
40,Karen L.,"New York, NY",2,12,10,4.0,9/14/2018,"Came here after work to grab a drink. The place is big, with a ground floor and a downstairs. Longnbar and many tables. When I got there the ground floor was crowded and loud but luckily the basement floor was more quiet and had standing space and spots at the bar. They have a large selection of drinks from wine to cocktails to beers. I got a mojito and my date had a glass of wine. By the time I left at 8pm, the basement floor died down and it was pretty empty. Overall good spot. Due to it being in midtown, it will get crowded after work but will die down a few hours after.",,,
41,Crystal B.,"New York, NY",347,21,24,4.0,8/19/2018,"summary: get the LAMB SLDIER!!!! My friends and I came here at 12AM. They serve food everyday until 2 AM (which is kinda crazy but, I'm not complaining) The food prices were ok not a total nightmare, what do u expect from New York. $12-25 range. My friends and I shared three meals. We got the lamb sliders, the margarita pizza and the poutine. I 100% recommend getting the lamb sliders! It won't be a let down because of the chipotle mayo dressing. We got the margarita pizza it was really good as an appetizer for 3-4 people. The poutine was really heavy but if you like that kinda stuff go for it. But definitely get the sliders!!!!! So yummy!The atmosphere was cute- don't really recommend children @ night bc it's mostly a bar @ night and the restaurant is the back.",1,,1
42,Matthew H.,"Winston-Salem, NC",2,38,4,5.0,8/15/2018,"This is a really neat spot! There's a bar in the front, but also full service tables in the back.The hostess was very outgoing and friendly. She happily seated me at a table even though I was by myself. The waitress was also quite professional.And the food. I had the beef skillet nachos. I highly recommend them--they were DELICIOUS. The tortilla chips had some sort of spice on them, and the beef dip was full of cheese and flavor. Also a very generous portion--I came in hungry and was stuffed before I was able to finish it all.I also ordered straight bourbon (Woodford). It was a bit overpriced--ironically more expensive than their cocktails. But hard to complain about when the food was as good as it was.",1,,
43,Katy C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",140,158,67,5.0,7/28/2018,"This bar was directly across from our hotel and we stopped in for a drink every day. The bar downstairs was my favorite. Plus, there's plenty of room to stand around and talk if you don't want to saddle up to the bar. We had an Irish bartender and he was so fun. The atmosphere can't be beat. Hipster meets industrial. He staff has a dress code but heck if I could figure it out. They all look amazing. The drinks are about $15 and they've got a little bit of everything. I never tried any of the food, but it looked good!This was a fun place to visit-wish i was a local!",2,1,1
44,Laura V.,"Philadelphia, PA",178,81,9,4.0,3/26/2018,"Cute and trendy spot overall. Was up in NY for the day and made a reservation for brunch for 2 people.   Cute decor and nice to have the jazz band. We were seated in the back which was nice, could still hear the music but it wasn't loud to where you couldn't have a conversation.Our server was very sweet. Could tell that it wasn't her fault but the bar must have been very backed up because it took a while to get drinks. I get it for craft cocktails but even for beers it was taking a while. The Bloody Mary was good- had a pickle flavor which gave it a nice taste. The best drink was also really tasty. Could see that catching up on you!! The food is good. I had the avocado smash- but it seemed like it was guac versus avocado, I didn't mind but just didn't expect this. My fiancé had the grilled cheese which he said was really good.Overall a good spot. Would deff recommend checking it out.",2,1,3
45,Isabelle L.,"San Francisco Bay, CA",15,164,83,5.0,4/7/2018,"This is the best brunch I had in Manhattan. - first time alcohol + tea drink: I love the tea pot!- first time caught the jazz band during breakfast!I've never enjoyed jazz this much. So relaxing in this cozy bar.The salmon Benedict has the right salt level once blended with egg. This is the best Salmon Benedict I had.The avocado smash is on the creative side because they put some spicy sauce on it, not a whole lot but a few, which makes it really peculiar (in a good way). I'd say it tasted a little bit dry, need more moisture. Overall the breakfast was awesome with great food and wonderful atmosphere! Very good for friends hanging out on a Saturday morning.",2,,

47,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,3/4/2018,"I picked this spot simply out of convenience for a group of friends who all live in wildly disparate regions - Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. Not generally a fan of midtown west but this seemed to be the most accessible spot for all of us.Also, I ordinarily wouldn't have let a brunch place go without ordering the avocado smash but Tanner Smiths' version has it on Texas toast. Meh. OG multigrain Balthazar is where it's at. I went with the green asparagus toast with chicken - chicken was nice and chargrilled, but I think the salad as a whole was about 80% shaved fennel. I like fibrous veggies as much as the next person but my jaw started feeling tired from all the chewing. My friends liked their burgers and Benedicts so maybe, as always, I went with the healthy but less tasty choice. Also, there were a good half cup of olive oil puddling in the bowl. Should have gone with the burger and fries (though my personal preference is for a slightly thicker wedge). The mac n cheese comes out in the shape of a flattened brick. We didn't try any of their famous cocktails. I did like the swing/jazz band, accompanied by one solo couple dancing their hearts out. We were seated nearer the back so it didn't get too loud. Service was fine, though there seemed to be a ton of people just milling around. Maybe we came on the earlier side. The deviled eggs did look pretty delicious, though ...",7,2,6

49,Nicole R.,"New York, NY",258,119,4,4.0,8/4/2018,"Came in for a drink on a Thursday night. It was surprisingly crowded but we found a table in the basement area. The vibe is very cool and the decor is nice, but we picked an unlucky table because something from the ceiling dripped on us the whole time.Our waitress was nice and friendly, but it took quite a long time for our drinks to come out.The cocktail menu is impressive, with interesting spins on classic cocktails, but they are all priced at $15 (is this the new normal?)I ordered the Summer 75, a twist on a French 75. It mostly tasted like mango juice, which overpowered the gin and the cava. I definitely felt it, but it would have been nice to taste all the components. For $15 I definitely expected more.Will definitely give it another chance, though!",1,,

We let Josh choose our light lunch and he assisted us with the cocktails. The Bloody Mary and the house specialty Manhattan were great appetizers. The burgers and fries were delicious and cooked per the chef's recommendations. No wrong decisions. We missed the live entertainment but will return for dinner when the music is live (Th-Su).

52,Eric G.,"New York, NY",236,103,63,3.0,10/14/2018,Came in for Brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The hosts at the front were kind and helpful. The food was just okay. I had the bacon & egg sandwich and there was really nothing special about it at all. It was also very small - one fried egg on it. For $13? Silly. The pancake was good but it was covered in blueberry sauce & cream that was waaaay to sweet. What ever happened to subtlety. I mean this pancake plain with fresh blueberries on top would have been great but they tried to do much & my friend and I couldn't finish it and as I said I was hungry from the lacking of food on my sandwich plate. Also there was someone from Tecate walking around table to table offering free Bloody Mary tecate cocktails. Pretty tacky and tecate is not good---even worse when you mix it with Bloody Mary mix.,,,
53,Rebekah B.,"Winter Park, FL",263,358,465,5.0,2/14/2018,"2018 Review 12/100Another speakeasy-esque cocktail bar to fall in love with. I have a deep love for bars and restaurants themed after the prohibition era. There are about a million in New York - all on my to-do list - but Tanner Smiths happened to be the closest to my hotel on my most recent business trip so it was the one I visited. And I was not disappointed.I went to the downstairs bar behind a glamorous-looking red door. Inside, you'll find all the ambiance you would expect from bars keeping up with the speakeasy craze: low lighting, dark wood, bookcases, etc. It feels like walking into a 1920s speakeasy. Great music too. And friendly staff. The drinks are fantastic. I had a cocktail with elderflower (my fave) and cucumber and the recommendation of the bartender and it was fantastic.The food was good as well. I ordered the asparagus salad with chicken. I was surprised by how large it was. Super filling. And very tasty.Note: If you decide to visit the bar downstairs, depending on the time of day you may have some trouble finding a seat at a table or the bar. Granted, when I came the back room was closed for a private event so that cut down on the seating pretty significantly. But still, be prepared. I didn't mind standing. There are bar tables around the edges of the venue where you can make a spot for your drinks and food.I highly recommend checking our Tanner Smiths. A great stop with in New York City.",2,1,2
54,Matt G.,"Columbus, OH",160,244,97,5.0,2/9/2018,"We were blown away by everything we experienced during our weeknight dinner.The Food: DO NOT PASS ON THE EGGPLANT CHIPS! We would have hated ourselves if we wouldn't had taken a chance and tried these. The crispness of the chips with the accentuating blend from the honey dipping sauce makes this a mouth-watering appetizer that I could order as a meal by itself. The entrees were equally as good in quality. From the burger/fires to the baked mac n cheese (w/an onion ring), we happily stuffed ourselves, leaving no morsel unaccounted for.The Facility: It's darker in this restaurant, but it provides a distillery-style, trendy, romantic feel to it. The bar is separated from one of the seating areas, but still gives a nice separation between the bar feel and the restaurant feel. It can be kinda loud either way. So, be prepared if you're going during prime time.The Drink: The Winona: a smoke-infused Old Forester whiskey Old-Fashioned. Expensive, but satisfyingly smooth. You can actually taste the smoke that infuses the whiskey; it's not just a gimmick.The Service: Food was well-paced and our server was always nice and attentive. No complaints. Overall: I would go back...in a heartbeat. This place wasn't on any of the recommended lists from the hotels, and it definitely should have been. Everything was top quality and for a price that felt mid-western. If you're not from NYC, visit this place when you're here. If you live in NYC...what are you waiting for?",3,1,2

I was wrong, the place was pretty busy but we were able to get seated in the back (the stroller may have influenced this :) ). The drinks are pretty good and there's a lot of variety. Servers were quick and attentive. My only 'issue' was that the bar food eats were pretty sub-par in my opinion. We had flat bread pizza (mehh), sliders (the buns were so dry), fries (good), and this weird bacon wrapped wings concoction. I should have known better, but the wings just tasted off and the combination did not work at all for me. All in all, I've just had so much better bar food. I would come back for the drinks and would probably skip the food.",7,5,5

We got lucky and score two seats at the bar.After looking at the menu I decided to go with the Billy club and it was really good but I wanted something stronger so my next drink I just had some Makers and ginger and I was happily surprise but how large this drink was.If you are looking for a cool intimate place to come with friends or that special someone then this is a great option.,4,3,4

Updated review","Sweet Winona, we had a party in this beautifully placed cocktail club. There was talk of trips to the skier-tipped mountains in the US and the wondrous hikes of Patagonia.Here is what we drank. We ate sliders and fries.The Don. Get the Don, 12 year old scotch in old fashion form. This is why walnut bitters were invented. And rum as a sweetener! The Foggy Dew. One of my favorite Irish whiskies and some apple juice make a TreeTop that you wish you had during those tough days on the playground. I moved from the draught cider to the dew, but it wasn't much of a change. Very Apple forward.The Pearl. Sweet and a little spicy from the powdered rim. This little number reminds me of the margaritas and tropic sun.The Winona. No trip to the Tanner Smith's bar is complete without their signature cocktail. Bottled up with smoke, this is a two part pour. Three parts if you count the admiring phase. Pour it out, its a sweeter form of the Old Fashion than the Don, but full-bodied and strong. Let others smell the aromatic smoke left around the bottle.Happy drinkinUPDATEEpisode: SnowstormHappy hour with the buds. Had the duck sandwich which is an amazing substitute to the burger. Layered goodness of duck meat, arugula, onion pickles, sour cherry marmalade and a healthy kick of smoked gouda, one of my favorite cheeses. Sided with fries and the signature Winona cocktail, this was going to be a good night. The party grew with more local professional friends and a regrettable amount of ciders between all of us. Nicole took incredible care of us at the bar.",,,2
61,Andy Y.,"Orange County, CA",491,173,257,5.0,3/9/2018,"This a cocktail bar with plenty of seating in the back for eating & drinking & long bar in the front for any post work drinks.Interior: Very spacious and large. They have a very classy and chill decor inside. Great vibe, and of course gets packed during post work hours.Drink: The Winona: Very cool drink because of the oak smoke wood infusion. Love the glassware. Strong enough drink as well.Food:Mac & Cheese: OMG. Didn't have too much expectation but...this is the best mac & cheese I have ever had. The texture is perfect.Overall: Great spot for after work drinks and please try the mac & cheese.",,,1
62,Layla K.,"Rockville, MD",191,17,11,4.0,7/7/2018,Love the Jazzy Brunch theme - featuring a live band on Saturdays and Sundays. The atmosphere is intimate with dim lighting and vintage decor.The menu is simple featuring classic brunch items. I ordered the Salmon Benny while my husband ordered the Avacodo Smash. The food was good but nothing too special about it. I will take some points off for the bits of eggshell in our Avocado Smash.All in all if you're in the area go check it out - their dinner options look very creative and feature more than their brunch.,1,,

The entire place has multiple rooms with a very open bar space, making it perfect for both chatting over dinner with friends in the quieter section or hanging out at the bar during a night out. Got the hanger steak and it was delicious! Really juicy and tasteful steak with creamy brussels sprout salad and potatoes on the side. Also very reasonably priced, which is hard to find in this area! Besides entrees they offer lots of bar snack type food like pretzels and wings, but served with a nice presentation and delicately prepared.Cocktail menu was also great.Highly recommend.",,,
66,Allison C.,"Temecula, CA",2,52,1,2.0,9/14/2018,"My boyfriend and I were visiting NYC for the first time, and throughout our time visiting, my boyfriend picked all of the places to eat. For our last meal, I wanted to pick the restaurant. I saw the reviews on yelp for Tanner Smiths, and it looked pretty good so I made a reservation. When we arrived, there was definitely no need for a reservation because there was only one other table there. Immediately walking in, it smelled weird and old, but I still wanted to give it a try. They must be only good for lunch/dinner because breakfast was just eh. My boyfriend got the poutine and I got the eggs benedict. I will admit that I never tried eggs benedict before but there was nothing else on the menu that looked good, so I ordered it. Since it was my first time, are they usually very sour?! I looked up the recipe and there is lemon, but this eggs benedict tasted very sour and it did made me feel sick. Again, I don't know if it's supposed to taste like that or if it was just old. Also my boyfriend's poutine was just too cheesy for him. So of course the ONE time I pick the restaurant, it turns out to be a gross meal, lol. Overall, when I visit NYC again, I probably wouldn't pick this place for breakfast, but I will probably give it another chance for dinner.",1,,

68,Anna G.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,191,5.0,1/25/2018,Tanner Smiths is my new favorite midtown go to for a group. We worked with the Events Team at Tanner Smiths to reserve a part of the venue for an office going away party. The staff was incredibly welcoming and offered us a great location at the bar downstairs.The manager Kyle and bartender Kevin were phenomenal in accommodating our team. Kevin our bartender mixed and muddled every cocktail for our party and there was not a single complaint. The Revolver is my personal favorite - a mezcal cocktail similar to a margarita.The garlic French fries and everything pretzel with IPA cheese dip were devoured. The eggplant chips and veggie dumplings are good too. This venue does get crowded - so come early. It is a younger crowd of business professionals. More men than women!,1,,
69,Christina H.,"Queens, NY",102,43,19,4.0,12/14/2017,"My friend and I decided to check this place out for a quick dinner before heading to a concert last night. From the second we walked in I instantly loved the vibe. It was very dark, really only candles for lighting, but cozy at the same time. It was a Wednesday at around 4, so it wasn't too crowded at first. We were told to sit anywhere at the bar so my friend and I looked up and down with no luck. We noticed about 5 empty tables and we asked if we could sit there but then we were told that every single table in the place is reserved, which I thought was odd and very unfortunate considering all we wanted to do was sit down and eat. One of the bartenders noticed that we were waiting awkwardly for someone to leave the bar so she physically had to get out from around the bar to help us find a spot.Once we were seated we were given a menu and instantly ordered the poutine and I'm SO glad we did because it was hands down one of the best things I've ever eaten. The drink I got was also delicious. For our meals my friend ordered the chicken tacos and I got the falafel sliders and they were also amazing! The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is the setup/seating arrangement. I feel as though they would have SO much more business if they added a few more tables. Once 5:30 hit, we had other customers breathing down our necks while we were trying to eat our food which was VERY uncomfortable. We were going to stay for another drink but it got so bad that we just had to get the check and go to another bar. It's really a shame because the food was delicious and I loved the antique little touches around the bar.I would definitely go back, I just know now to go before people get out of work.",3,,
70,John S.,"New York, NY",0,39,7,3.0,10/11/2018,"I'll give them 3 stars because they are well organized and the service is very good.  However:- Bacon wrapped wings - I'm guessing that they wrap the wings and bake in an oven at a low temp for long period.  They are very soft and moist, but perhaps overcooked.  The meat almost fell off the bone.  Don't expect any crispiness like you might expect with those deep fried Buffalo wings.  Also, they were surprisingly tasteless considering that we're talking bacon here.- Pepperoni Flatbread Pizza with goat cheese, jalapeno and mozzarella -- sounds like it should be really tasty right? But if there was goat cheese on there I really couldn't detect it.  In fact, there wasn't much cheese or sauce at all, which was probably good because the ""flat bread"" was wafer thin.  Honestly, I've had better pizza out of the supermarket freezer.",,,

72,Marla L.,"Baltimore, MD",176,155,500,4.0,1/9/2018,"Extremely cute, and deceivingly large restaurant/bar. We came a little before 8 on a Monday evening, and were seated right away (2 of us). Dimly lit, and much bigger than I expected on the inside. So glad I read the reviews - we started off the eggplant chips and the Thai deviled eggs. First off, and lastly - GET BOTH OF THESE!! They were exceptional!!! Wasn't sure what to expect with the chips, but they must have been lightly battered and soft fried (is that even a thing?!?) They weren't super crunchy, but had just the right amount. The drizzled honey, and dipping syrup-y thing topped these off perfectly. I really want to know how to make these...but somehow know they'd never turn out like that. Delicious!!And the deviled eggs!! OMG!! Please, whatever you do, make sure you get in a super bite, with everything on your fork. Worked well for me to removed the jalapeño and radish, cut those in half separately, cut the egg and toast in half, then reapply the half pepper and radish back on for each side. Yes, I'm fully aware this is wayyy too much information and my OCD tendency slip may be showing. But trust me, it's worth it for the super bite! Everything on this unassuming little deviled egg works flawlessly together. I could have eaten another serving of them.  We also tried the dry rubbed chicken wings, and the carrot cake for dessert. The chicken wings were a bit chalky for my liking, seemed like maybe tossed in the rub afterwards, instead of cooked in it?!? I don't know, but they were better dipped in the hot sauce it came with. Carrot cake ""bites"" were different. Not bad, we certainly finished them, but I would have preferred them a bit sweeter. All in all, a very solid performance by tanner smiths. Too bad I only get to NYC a few times a year (so in translation, there's too many good restaurants in NY to repeat)...because I would like to try some other things from the menu here. Either way, recommended by me!",1,,1

Updated review","Updated review - the food and drinks continue to be top notch, but the service seems to have takes a turn for the worse after their brunch has picked up in popularity.Came here a couple of times for brunch and the service seemed cold and weirdly discriminatory. We asked to be seated upstairs and we were put in the cellar downstairs - even though there were tons of empty tables around. When we asked, we were told that the tables were reserved, but they don't take reservations for brunch (we know, we tried to make one over the phone before we came). And those same tables were empty till the time we left, which makes it clear to us that they didn't want to seat us there.Seated downstairs, our server forgot to put in our drink order and so it came in only after our food. Cocktails are impressive as always, I really liked the cereal milk cocktail I got. They also have a tipsy tea which is basically a cocktail served in a teacup - a lot of alcohol if you're up for it! Food came out on time and was delicious as always - the lamb burger and the sausage flatbread were especially tasty.It's a pity because this was my #1 spot for a great meal and drinks - but brunch has left me thinking I'd rather go somewhere else. I'll still come here for a drink or two in the evening, but I'd wait till I readily go here for brunch again.",,,
79,Denay W.,"New York, NY",308,226,736,5.0,11/12/2017,"This is such a surprisingly cool bar located in Midtown! Being in the area it is, I guess I expected it to be incredibly touristy or way overpriced but Tanner Smiths was neither of those things. The place itself is pretty large with additional space located downstairs. The ambiance was dim with candles lit all around which gave it a classy vibe in addition to all the other nice furniture and things adding to the prohibition theme. However the vibe was very upbeat, with throwback tunes and other top hits playing throughout the couple of hours we were there. The bartender we had was great! She was incredibly quick to serve people waiting for drinks and could throw together a great cocktail. Most of the cocktails offered are in the $14 range, but they also offer a great selection of beer and other liquors. While there, I tried the Excuse Me, Sir, which is a gin based drink and it was wonderful!",3,1,2

When you get here hopefully your waitress will be Emma who was a delight. Her knowledge of the brunch  menu and cocktails were beyond reproach. My daughter who can be picky LOVED her choice, the PANCAKE which was served in a skillet, with fresh blueberry preserves, maple syrup a dollop of whipped cream and basil garnish.  I loved my Duck hash, ask for some Sirracha to kick it up another level. And you MUST try ""Smoke in the morning."" It's Tanners spin on the classic old fashioned. Overall an AMAZING dining experience.",,,

We loved everything about this place from the DJ who took himself too seriously (we got him to laugh by the end of the night!), to the kitschy decor, to the incredible staff, this place was great! Their cocktails are imaginative and the staff was so attentive. We were in town for a girls trip to celebrate our friend getting married and the manager came by with shots for us all.

The accompanying hash had great flavor but was soft & mushy. The margarita flatbread was dry- almost like a Parmesan cracker.  We asked for sauce to dip it in and they brought out a lovely tomato bruschetta style dressing which helped. The asparagus salad was very basic- literally 5 ingredients mixed together (asparagus, fennel, radish, parsley & lemon juice) for 16 bucks...not great.  Vegetable dumplings had nice flavor but could use more filling in each dumpling.

93,Chase S.,"Brookline, MA",166,177,142,2.0,4/13/2018,"Really disappointed considering others had such great experiences here.Atmosphere: We were seated way in the back in the corner which probably didn't help. The acoustics in the place were terrible! So loud and hard to hear each other for a pleasant brunch conversation. It was dank and fairly dark with nauseating lighting. Sitting further up in the front would have been better, surely. The seating was really tight -- if you're tall like us, consider asking for front seats or don't go at all.Service: Service was meh. The waitress was around a bit but totally peaced out half-way through our time there. We had dirty plates sitting around for 30 minutes plus. Water wasn't filled often. There was food from our previous neighbors sitting on a table next to us for the first 15-20 minutes of us sitting down -- and, again, the seating is close. Ugh.Food: Pretty disappointing, as well. The duck hash was small, bland, and forgettable. Even the basic eggs and pork breakfast/brunch was crappy. I had the lamb burger and it could have been a bubba burger that was overcooked. No pizzaz, flavor, nothing. Probably the most disappointing lamb burger of my life. Drinks: Average. Not much to say here.I doubt I'll be back. Maybe I'll be roped into it by some of the other Eliters that ranked it high. I'd probably come for the music and a drink but not for the food!",4,,

We came in on a Sunday morning, September 2nd, around 11:00 am. We were starving and this place was pretty close to our hotel. When we walked in we were not greeted warmly, quite the opposite actually. I believe we were bothering the young lady by our visit to this restaurant. The further back into the restaurant we walked the stronger the dirty rag smell surrounded us. I couldn't imagine sitting there for an hour trying to eat with that smell lingering in the air. We looked at each other and in unison nodded. Let's get the hell outa here. I'm not sure what the corrective action is here for management.

There was a touch of Sriracha on top of the eggs to add just a bit of heat.  Well done.The place is pleasant, relatively quiet, has a well equipped bar, and was serving a really nice looking Mother's Day brunch special.  All around it's a great brunch spot.  I can imagine that it's a great place for a drink and dinner also.I would definitely come back.",1,,

But one downside is that the area that my friend and I got seated, the tables were pretty close to each other. With that being said, when we got seated, the guy next to us said something along the lines of ""you can move to the other table if you want"" but 1) the other table wasn't even set yet and 2) We were fine.  So I guess my advice is, if you're a party of two...maybe not plan on having super deep or intimate conversations here because the table(s) next to you can def hear every word. BUT I can tell that they accommodate for big parties so it's a plus! I ordered the burger (chicken) and got the friend eggplant chips for appetizers. Both were mouth drooling good. But fair warning, the burger is messy so if you're on a first date, you may want to choose something else.lol. Is it a burger that you can't get elsewhere? Prob not, but it still doesn't disappoint. The chips with that maple syrup drizzled on top was oh so delicious. You have to get it. It's a must. You won't regret it. And good came out super fast. Always a plus if you're hungry.

The place has the feel of a speakeasy, dark brick & old timbers, big ol' bar up front, small tables in the back (a little too close together, but hey it's Manhattan). Bathrooms are clean, cozy, even smelled nice with scented candles.So my friend & I opted to sit at the bar to be close to the music. Was waited on by the most charming & genuine bartender, Richie, from Dublin, who gave us a great cocktail suggestion for brunch. I had the Eggs Benedict, a little too runny for me, but everything tasted super fresh, especially the Irish bacon and brown bread they use for the base. (No English muffin here! Duh!). My friend got the goat cheese salad which was bigger than I expected. The duck confit dish looked really good & I am sorry I didn't get it. But the Jazz trio (with a fourth trumpet player sitting in this day) just made the day by setting a low key, but happy mood. She was a wonderful singer!

The host explained to me that the basement is a speakeasy type of theme and quiet for conversations. We said yes to that. This place is huge. They have a lot of seats that stretched into the next room on both floors. When we entered the basement I was super thrilled to see that it was a dark intimate space with stylish decor and feel to it. Our waitress was polite, patient and informative. My friend ordered rose wine, I ordered the cotton club, and my other friend ordered the cotton club too after tasting mine.For food: I ordered lamb sliders for $15, my one friend ordered chicken tacos for $14, and my other friend ordered shrimp tacos for $15. We ordered the new york style poutines but garlic fries came out instead. Tbh the poutines were extremely salty so we were glad that they made a mistake and gave us free garlic fries which by the way tasted so much better.

Loved the fact that they serve food/snacks till late I would say about 2AMThe bartenders are amazing people to chat with and make phenomenal drinks with a show! I would 100% recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC and wanting to just have a nice night out with good company snacks and drinks!!On top of the fact that they are open until 4am!,1,1,3

122,Nate S.,"New York, NY",413,324,260,4.0,9/12/2017,"Brunch here was pretty damn good. No wait time around 3pm on a Saturday, but then again the place is big with a huge bar spanning across 3/4ths of the restaurant.A live band was just wrapping up in the front, otherwise, the atmosphere was quieter than your typical brunch places (No dj spinning tunes, no loud/boisterous drunk groups etc).This place seemed more suitable for an intimate small group or a date.Food was good. I enjoyed the breakfast flatbread..fried eggs, chorizo sausages, and other seasonings adding to a delectable and filling meal. Honorable mention to the extensive cocktail options, I enjoyed the recommendations from the waitress.Overall, a solid restaurant with great drink options in a very touristy area. Highly recommend for your dining and drinking needs.",1,1,1
123,Sophia G.,"Stanwood, WA",335,16,1,3.0,4/14/2018,"I was pretty disappointed in the food. I ordered the Avocado Smash, and I the description sounded yummy but the presentation and quality was poor.

124,Andrew T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",188,394,849,4.0,9/11/2017,"I'm not much of a drinker but I came here with a few friends, we got the sing sing which is pretty much like a moscow mule. It was probably one of the best I've ever had. Came here at 10PM and it was very dim inside. Given that I have 4 eyes, my eyes are already impaired so I was very dark inside. I guess it makes it that much more imitate but I can't have a good time if I can see what I'm enjoying. With all the drinking, we ordered the eggplant fries which was ridiculously good. It's very different from anything I've very had before. The texture is pretty much like any vegetable you fry. It's like a very soft chip. They drizzle the top with honey and that made it 10 times better. It also comes with a side of honey for dipping. I enjoyed the environment and the music wasn't too loud where you couldn't really hear what people are saying.RESTROOM LOCATION: Towards the back and down the stairs.",1,1,1

I've ordered meatballs and cheese fries and it was the smallest size meatballs I've ever seen. There were three pieces and had a price tag of $14. The super tiny thimble size  fries were $11. I surpressed my hunger with a few drinks and called it a night. My portion of the bill was $80. I'd come here again for drinks, but definitely not for food.",,,

Although this place is nice ,  I did not have a good experience at all.I found it extremely awkward at how close the tables were. I could hear everything the table next to us was saying; therefore, I wanted to sit next to my boyfriend so I can have a private evening instead of across the table.  This place wasn't crowded enough where all the tables were taken but they  were so concerned about me taking up 2 tables that they made me move. My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger which was alright. His meat was really charred and overcooked.  I ordered the New York style pouting fries and they didn't taste good at all. I'm the type of person that always finishes my food or takes it home , especially fries (my fav food)! But I didn't even finish them nor take them home! My fries were so burnt; I was going to complain but by the time I had tasted it I had like 6 bites (every other other bite was burnt) I thought it was too late. Very disappointing!! I wouldn't come here again.",6,2,2

Came in with a reservation, so no wait time. Also came rather early so we were the first ones there but after awhile the place got packed fast.

Maybe it was because it was pretty late and there weren't that many people dining but our server was super attentive and friendly! Our host that seated us also came in and checked on us a few times!

Service was fine, but not anything great. Everyone was super awkward when we walked in, and didn't even bother acknowledging us. We eventually grabbed ourselves seats at the bar and THEN the bartender finally spoke to us.Their drinks are imaginative and a lot of fun, but we all found them a bit too sweet?

140,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,3.0,10/1/2017,"3.5 Came here for dinner on Saturday at 6pm and were seated immediately in the back with a noisy crowd. The restaurant was a lot bigger than I imagined. The waitress was very nice and the service was on point. We ordered to share: Grilled Shrimp Tacos: I HIGHLY recommend these. It was the best thing I had out of everything. The shrimp was perfect, not overly salty, fresh and plenty. Came with green sauce and tomato sauce? both were good. Mac N Cheese with pork shoulder: This was recommended by the waitress but it was quite disappointing (maybe it was just mine). First, it's not your average creamy mac n cheese served in a skillet of some sort. Rather it was stacked together and dry. The cheese was powder like and the macaroni was mushy. The onion rings were bland and greasy. The pork shoulder was on the sweeter side which was fine but it was very dry too. The dish was very heavy. Chicken and Pesto Flatbread: SKIP. This was very boring and dry. It tasted exactly as chicken, cheese, pesto on thin flatbread. The flavor was lacking. I had 2 bites and didn't bother with the rest. The Rosie Lee tipsy tea: I would say skip this too. The presentation was beautiful but the cocktail itself tasted okay. I wouldve loved to try other drinks. The bill came to about $72 for 3 entrees and 2 cocktails. I would say that's fair given that the portion of food was more than enough for 2 people to share. I had a nice experience but not sure if I want to return for the food.",,,

142,Dawn F.,"Dallas, TX",66,236,680,4.0,3/2/2018,"We liked this place. It had a low-light, can't-tell-what-time-of-day-it-is vibe. Whether you want to get seated upstairs or downstairs, start upstairs (despite the fact they have stairs leading down to the lower level). They play music and have candles in the evening, so it's got a cozy feel.The menu was very vegetarian friendly. Some of the dishes were bland (the veggie flatbread), but some were fun (veggie poutine, grilled cheese). We wished the grilled cheese had been bigger, and we wished the gravy on the poutine was more flavorful, but it was simply nice to be able to hang out and eat. The beer list was decent. The cocktails were pretty damn tasty and very strong, which is good because I think each one was about $15. I think that's just typical NYC, though.Service was super friendly and we felt welcome both times we stopped in. So, some pluses and some minuses, but we like this place overall and would recommend it.",1,,

I met a friend here on a frigid night and it was well worth braving the cold for. Upon entering I did a few laps upstairs and thought it was pretty loud and busy, so I headed downstairs. That's where the dark, moody, speakeasy vibes were at. Grabbed a seat at the bar (there are tables too) and stuck around for a few hours. The bartender was attentive and talented, as I asked him to make what he wanted based on what I was in the mood for.

My friend got the bourbon tea- I would recommend getting this one. It tasted better in my opinion but I like dark liquor. For my entree I got the avocado smash- they could put more avocado on it but it was filling. It comes with poach eggs on the top. I like the mustard/cheesy sauce they gave with my fries.

The decor was very rustic chic and awesome spot for brunch, girls night, even a casual date.I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict me a Bloody Mary. Both were delicious. My Eggs Benedict was very filling as well. Great portions. Our server Sara was very accommodating and attentive.

Heard good things about Tanner Smiths from a couple friends, so was excited to check it out. - Cocktails and Drinks: The cocktails here were great, with a large variety and creative drinks. I started off with the Sing Sing (Absolute Vodka, Sour Cherry Cordial, Lime, Balsamic, Q Ginger Beer) ($14). Later in the evening, I got the Big Frenchy (Monkey Shoulder Whisky, Lejay Creme de Cassis, Lemon, Sugar, Laptoaig Mist) ($14). The cool part about the Big Frenchy is the ""mist"" they spray on top of the cocktail, which is essentially scotch -- pretty unique component that I haven't seen anywhere else. I enjoyed both drinks and the bartenders seemed very knowledgeable. The first bartender we had was very helpful, friendly and explained various drinks and their ingredients to us. The second one when we came back for a nitecap, not so much. - Atmosphere: Tanner Smiths has a classy ambiance and atmosphere, it also seems versatile -- good to hang out with friends, go on a date, etc. They have a nice bar area upstairs with a dining area and a more private dining area and bar downstairs. I'd definately recommend the downstairs bar area to hang out with friends. Overall, had a really fun time at Tanner Smiths. Really good, creative drinks with knowledgeable bartenders, laid back but classy atmosphere and good crowd. I definitely intend on coming back fairly often!",8,3,7

167,Tim H.,"Lansing, MI",10,255,0,4.0,5/27/2018,"Tanner Smiths is more of a bar than a restaurant. I went on a Tuesday night and was shocked of how crowded and rowdy it was. I came in for food but since it was just myself I was luckily able to snag an open seat at the bar. To drink, I had The Don, which was tasty and the cinnamon syrup that accompanied it was sweet and smooth. It was $15 but it was worth it.  The bartender was a bit off-putting, but it's Midtown in Manhattan so service won't be the warmest. I was most surprised by the food though. I had the Grilled Shrimp Tacos which were much better than they had any right of being. I mean, it's an Irish bar in Midtown and the shrimp tacos were California-good. This place has tremendous reviews on Yelp, which are well-warranted. I'm sure the central location on Midtown helps the popularity of this place but it's worth hitting up if you're a tourist in the area (because lets be honest, locals don't go to Midtown). Just fair warning though, it's laid out more like a bar than a restaurant, it can get really crowded so it's probably not good for larger groups, and the drinks and food are quite good. Enjoy!",1,1,2
168,Matthew N.,"New York, NY",132,31,56,5.0,12/27/2017,"This is my favorite bar in midtown, possibly in manhattan. Where to begin...amazing bar tending, the staff really know their recipes. They can make new concoctions on the fly for you, based on your preferences. And the Winona is amazement in a glass...try this bourbon smoky perfection. The food is really good, but on the pricey side. A burger is $15, most brunch items are in the high teens to low 20's, but everything I've tried is good. The wait staff will offer suggestions and I would take their help.The ambiance really makes this stand out. Jazz brunch on the weekends with live music, low lighting, and boozy tea specials? I feel like a prohibition era rum smuggler on Sunday. The decor is dark and intimate, but the noise levelIs loud, making this a good option for someone you've dated for months and are not in the ""I need to get to know you better by listening closely"" stage.

Weak coffee. I would avoid this place for breakfast.",,,
171,Ashleigh B.,"Lumberton, NC",1,12,14,4.0,10/7/2018,"If your looking for a simple but not so simple bar then this is your place. The crafted cocktails are worth trying, along with the twist on classic bar food",,,
172,Joel L.,"New York, NY",18,30,0,4.0,10/11/2018,"I like this place for it's really spacious! Plenty of seating and a nice selection of upscale pub grub. The cocktail list is innovative and thoughtful. Cocktails are decent, weirdly best part was the eggplant chips fried in chickpea flour.",,,

174,Curtis G.,"Boston, MA",87,114,115,4.0,12/12/2017,"Surprised and delighted by our visit here. I had walked by before but not stopped in. Turned out to be a good call to give it a try for Sunday brunch. Our other plans fell through so we tried a walk in and lucked out before it got too busy. Service was really friendly and we really liked the ambiance. Plus they had a live jazz band playing a mix of classic songs, Christmas hits, requests and a few originals. You gotta love a jazz brunch! We sat at the bar which was a great spot for service and listening plus people watching. But this place actually is pretty big with a full back room and back 1/2 of the bar plus an entire lower level with a separate dining room and a second bar and dining option way in the back too. Food was great too. A little heavy and more filling than we wanted but worth it. Great eggs Benedict, toasts, plus poutine and some skillet options. Fresh squeezed OJ and the carrot ginger juices were so good we had a few with our meal. Go early, grab a table up front and enjoy the show. Plus they offer a tipsy tea service, alcoholic of course.",1,,

176,Herry L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",33,1,0,3.0,6/9/2018,It was just okay for me. Went there for breakfast. Didn't have to wait to get seated. Seemed like there were plenty of seats on a Saturday morning.I had the duck confit hash. It tasted like canned food. My friend had pastrami skillet. It was much better. Coffee was a bit weak and watered down for my taste. Was expecting more from a 4 star rating.,1,,
177,Mike G.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",75,85,7,2.0,7/4/2018,We tried this last night. As an alert to the management we were seated and waited more that 15 minutes.  No one came to the table to serve us. We walked out.Management followed up on my review. Nicely done.,,,

I celebrated my 30th birthday here, first time in NYC and it was definitely such an amazing experience. Let's talk about the drinks- sigh. First great drink I've had this entire trip.Let's talk service. Sarah. Sighhhh. Sent from the gods. She is just honestly the sweetest, ever. She went above and beyond to make my day special. I can't thank her enough. Definitely the kind of server you come back and ask for. Overall, great experience. So happy I dragged my friends here!

180,Nivi R.,"Manhattan, NY",67,162,60,4.0,4/22/2018,"I like Tanner Smiths! There are so many of these American sports bar type places in Midtown West, but I think Tanner is the best of the lot. I like their cocktails and the food. Always enjoyed the deviled eggs here, so yummy with that little toast. I live just a few blocks away from here and come here when I want to get a quick drink with friends or just want to sit at the bar myself and get dinner.",3,1,1
181,Dan L.,"Bellmore, NY",331,373,1092,5.0,4/16/2018,Had a great first time visit at lunch today.  Started with the deviled eggs and the buffalo chicken rolls.  Both were delicious and had some heat and amazing flavor.  I had the caeser salad with grilled chicken was very flavorful.  Cocktails were solid and so was the service.  Loved the ambience of this place and will return again.  The bar area is huge and impressive looking.  Based on the cosmo I had I want to come back and try some of their speciality cocktails as they had a nice selection.,4,1,2
182,Minta P.,"Charleston, SC",48,109,1817,5.0,12/17/2017,"If you want great atmosphere, friendly bartenders, fantastic food and fabulous cocktails...find your way over to Tanner Smith's. With an ambiance so inviting you'll lose track of time, you will feel right at home here. Our bartender was helpful in our decision making process for brunch, patiently answering our questions full of enthusiasm. I had THE best bacon and eggs sandwich I have ever tasted (sorry daddy) and a cocktail with fresh beet juice which was just as delicious. Nicole, our bartender, was absolutely adorable and between her hospitality, the live music and that drink I could have stayed all day!",,,2
183,Lauren P.,"New York, NY",405,51,125,4.0,4/7/2018,Was able to walk in on a Sunday with no wait!Ordered:Brussel Sprout Hash: OKAY. I probably would not order this again. I love Brussel sprouts but feel that the Brussel sprout portion of his dish could taste better and be more flavorful. I was very much of a mash. There was no texture to it. I also didn't feel like it had too much flavor (maybe because of the mash aspect of it).Mac and Cheese (with pork shoulder): VERY GOOD. This is a great Mac and cheese but I highly recommend that you get the pork shoulder added. Without it the Mac and cheese only has the Gruyere flavor (which is great don't get me wrong) but the contrast with pork shoulder adds a whole other element. I rate this as a very good as opposed to excellent because I feel like they could have done more with this dish flavor wise. It has a lot of potential!!,,,

We sat at the bar in Sunday morning and had some AMAZING cocktails that were so well crafted and presented. Nicole was very welcoming and made some great suggestions while providing friendly service. The eggs were awesome, fries were a good side and let me say, the music was a wonderful addition to an already great atmosphere.",,,1

186,Ellie P.,"Long Island, NY",23,130,23,4.0,10/26/2017,"We live for bars like this one. Tanner Smith's is a hidden gem, tucked away amongst the chaos of Times Square. The vibe is incredibly cool---charleston-style, with a pre-prohibition feel. The decor is fantastic. Very old timey/modern feel-there is something about Charlie Chaplin movies playing while listening to Kanye....Their cocktail menu (which is a book, really) is impressive. We ordered the pretzels and duck confit spring rolls first. The pretzels were great, but the duck spring rolls were incredibly greasy, greasier than normal confit. The pork bun sliders were great, but the portion was small for the price. Mole chicken tacos were flavorful, but dry. We will definitely return for cocktails and the bar vibe and to give their brunch a try. Unfortunately the food didn't hold up.",2,,1
187,Kare J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,1,5.0,9/22/2018,Great atmosphere and music.  The focus on small plates and there is something for everyone.  We had the shredded Brussels sprout salad with egg and radish Caesar salad with anchovies and they were both delicious.  The chicken in the tacos had a great flavor and the salsa verde  for the tacos was delicious.  It will be on our list for future visits to NYC. The best part was no reservation needed. We went around 7 pm on a Saturday. I imagine it can get packed later in the evening. They also have a good selection of beers. They make a great mocktail also.,,,

190,Britt C.,"Austin, TX",5,53,6,5.0,12/14/2017,"I am so in love with this place. Being from Austin, I am not familiar with the NYC bar scene- last year was my first visit to this bar by recommendation from a local. I. fell. in. love.The atmosphere is dark and elegant, definitely the feel of a speakeasy. There is a hidden downstairs bar for an even more intimate atmosphere. The drinks are absolutely phenomenal. Artisan craft cocktails that I honestly can't pick my favorite. However, the teapot might have to take the cake...it's amazing. The food is also delectable- try the Thai Deviled Eggs! And the service is probably why I always return. Kevin has always been so welcoming. He even remembered me when I returned one year later to this bar! Thanks for an amazing time and I will return again next year!",,,

In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change lies our happiness and freedom."" - Buddha Our schedule didn't allow for us to check out some of the Speakeasy and Craft Cocktail bars that are on my NYC list. As such, I was a little reluctant to go to Tanner Smiths as a fall-back option. We experienced a couple amazing drinks!...near perfect cocktails. Admittedly, the ambiance was not overly impressive, but venturing down to the basement portion of TS, we found a suitable space.My love and I enjoyed the Big Frenchy and a Razor Riley. These were alcohol forward drinks that were made with care. We did not try any of the food, and from what I saw I would guess that the food would be suitable if you needed something to eat while you were drinking, but it also didn't seem like a place I would seek-out for food.",22,16,23

My whole group was so impressed with the food and loved the ambiance. The cocktails were great, and the upscale bar food far exceeded everyone's expectations. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the space can be a bit cramped in sections. But that's the only negative I have about the place!",1,1,1

198,Jen E.,"Buffalo, NY",40,162,238,5.0,5/28/2018,"Found this on Yelp. We headed here for dinner after walking Times Square and headed to a Broadway show after. Great choice! Walking in we were quickly greeted by a hostess who walked us through a fun and nicely decorated bar. The bar was playing loud music, but as soon as we got to the tables, it was not too loud at all. I ordered the Excuse Me Sir cocktail which was good. We opted for the eggplant chips as an appetizer and split three other items. The grilled shrimp tacos were the winner, three corn shell tortillas with two large shrimp in each taco accompanied by two sauces and lime to top. The beef burger, served with pickles, red onion, ketchup, and orange mayo and a side of very good fries. We also ordered the mac and cheese with pulled beef topped with onion rings. I didn't really like the flavor of the onion rings, but the mac and cheese was okay, would recommend trying something else. Great atmosphere, comfortable seating, good service. Highly recommend.",,,
199,Charlotte C.,"Manhattan, NY",10,30,1,4.0,9/26/2018,Swanky lounge and restaurant with a lower level speakeasy. I love the ambiance and the wonderful staff that work here. Plenty of seating and a nice selection of upscale pub grub. The cocktail list is innovative and thoughtful. I enjoyed crispy fries and wing are good. Yardbird scotch eggs is little bit spicy but tasty. Definitely will come back! Highly Recommend.,,,
