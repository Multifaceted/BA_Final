I have to admit.... I had the BEST burger in my entire life at this place! No joke! And I have been to a lot of places in my life. It was the jalapeno burger with pepper jack cheese & bacon cooked medium rare. OMG! This was a few years ago (I no longer eat red meat and this was the one time in over 12 years I decided to eat meat) and I still dream of this burger! If I still ate meat, I would go get one tomorrow. Now the establishment is a little pricy (but that's midtown Manhattan for you) but the burger is reasonably priced and the accompany fries are also incredible!",,,
1,Darin B.,"Sparks, NV",4,30,13,3.0,9/20/2017,"Stopped in after work to get something kinda quick.  Pretty big assortment of different foods.  I grabbed a rib, some chicken, potatoes, fried bananas, crab salad.  Nothing too special, but I'd go back if I need something quick and can't decide on something specific.  Sandwich options too.  They do shut down parts so not everything is available if you go too late.  Seating fills up quick too.",,,

They are very rude to their employees also);4) food is overpriced even for NYC;5) dirty (B rating);6) bought a bag of chips that's all broken inside;7) bought a slice of cake that has mold on it;,,,
3,Irina G.,"Edgewater, NJ",473,220,1428,3.0,10/10/2014,"Prices are good and there is good variety. There is a deli station, salads, Japanese station, groceries, and ice cream. There is also a buffet to top it all. The place is not cheap, but reasonably priced for NYC.Breakfast - I got a vegetable omelette for breakfast here this morning. It came with potatoes and toast. While I liked the price, the food itself was not great. Breakfast potatoes were mushy and sloppy. The eggs were tasteless and I couldn't find the mushrooms though they were supposed to be a main ingredient.It was not the best quality breakfast I had. There was also a long line to order and I waited close to 30 minutes for my breakfast to come. On usual days, I don't have this much time.I do have a lot of food restrictions and this place has options for me - which is nice and not always the case. Freshness could be improved. It is hectic in the AM but I didn't walk out hungry and I didn't break the bank buying food. I will probably be back because I work in the building but wouldn't travel far to get here...",2,,

After eating out meal, i tell my cousin, i know of a spot where we can buy drinks and share it in the deli.So we proceed to enter your establishment, i make a bee line for the beer selection,, i pick a big giant can of Asahi beer and he takes two long cans of  Guinness for us to share. We approach the cashier which seems to be of asian decent, judging by the accent the features. We pay for the drinks and my cousin beats me to the laying down the credit card game. While this is all happening, the others were busy buying ice cream at the gelateria in the same premise. So we all sit, make a toast for the great vacation we've had here filled with sight seeing and shopping in NYC. Before we go back out to Time Square to get one last soak in on the atmosphere, we decide to use the ""Customers Only"" bathroom which was just used by my cousin who beat me to the lay down the credit card game. My boyfriend was the first to ask, and I approached him, ""I asked the cashier and he just giggled and walked away."" So I try asking him since CLEARLY we were just in front of him purchasing beverages for the group. His response was, ""The bathroom is out of order."" Ok,, I get it,, I guess we have clearly overstayed our welcome. We clean the tables, throw away our trash and leave to enjoy the rest of the night in time square.Sincerely,Rodrigo TorresP.S.This letter is not by no means defame or demolish your fine establishment, this is to clearly show that ""MISUNDERSTANDINGS DO HAPPEN""Thank you for taking time to read my letter.",2,2,1

They also carny snacks, incl healthy packaged snacks like dried peas and fresh fruit. Place is very organized and they move the line quickly. Ample seating for dine-in customers.I had their pasta and it was pretty good - the sauce wasn't too filling and the ingredients were fresh. The only issue I had with the taste was that the sauce tasted a little bland, as if there was no salt in it but I guess that's to keep it healthy? The food portion was good for the price - only $9 for a large dish of fresh-cooked pasta.Will be going back to try other items.",,,
8,Evonna A.,"Queens Village, NY",36,251,44,5.0,10/1/2015,"Since my office moves from midtown to uptown I have been frequenting this deli quite often. I must say that I have had all pleasant experiences. It is ALWAYS busy but the service is pretty fast so you're in and out depending on how you move. I haven't ordered any sandwiches or wraps just yet I usually just get something from the buffet table. I believe it's $8.00 a pound and I always manage to get enough food and it's always under a pound. Usually, I get fruit, lowein, rice, salad and chicken. It has always been very well. My food is always cooked just right and tastes amazing. They also sell sushi and it is FRESH. Usually, I never get sushi from any small places because you just never know what you're eating and he to be careful with fish. However, my experience here has been good. I'm not the only person that likes this place. Almost all of my colleagues frequent this business for lunch every day. It's definitely worth it. Unless you want to eat from a cart then there aren't many other great options nearby. They do accept credit card but there's a $8 minimum & there is seating but if you're going to take a seat then eat fast and leave because there's always a lot of people waiting to grab a chair.",1,,
9,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",175,394,48,2.0,1/14/2015,"I tried this place b/c some guys at my office eat from here at least once a week, and they recommended it.The quality isn't the best, but the (cheap) prices make up for it. They also have a huge selection, and a pretty giant self-serve buffet. I really wanted to like this place.My major gripe is in the service and layout. The way they have ordering set up is unnecessarily confusing. They have 2 pieces of paper taped to the deli counter, telling you where to order deli sandwiches and where to order hot food. To top it off, the items on the menu above the different areas do not coincide with where you should order it. For example, hot items might be mixed over on the left menu, but you order on the right. Ok so what about something like corned beef? Technically it's hot, but it's also a sandwich. Ambiguous. Well, I guess deli item and I guess wrong.  Waited in one ""line"" for 10 minutes (not really a line, just a bunch of people standing around and you have to guess where the line starts/ends), only to get up to order and have the guy point to the other line. You order that over there. No apology, no offer to get the order for me, nothing.After waiting another 10 minutes, they forgot the fries. Those took another 5.All in all I spent about 20-25 minutes getting a sandwich and french fries. It was a terrible experience, even for someone who is used to Midtown lunchtime madness.Note to owners: Put some ropes or something. Not even ropes. Just one single rope. Ordering a sandwich and fries shouldn't be this difficult.",1,1,

15,Melissa M.,"Palmer, MA",44,17,5,4.0,12/24/2014,"This place is a breath of fresh air in the  hectic overpriced places that surroundings. We stayed at the hilton and when hungry and couldn't leave or wanted a snack we had to get the incredibly overpriced herb n' kitchen or the gift shop. Or we would be hungry late and want real food. This place is open 24/7 for your snacking enjoyment. We had breakfast and snacks here. Let's start with breakfast. Can I say NY bagels are not exaggerated. These are the most amazing chewy, soft and flavorful and with multiple flavors and flavored cream cheese you could have a new one each morning  of your stay.  I got an omelet it came with toast and home fries for only $4.50 and no that's not a typo. The food was good but the toast was soft and soggy. There are so many options. The line is a bit long but worth it. There is some seating available. The deli Sammie's,called heros in NYC, looked so good and rye had paninis and wraps as well. The store is full of options for snacking and meals including full salad bar, hot food bar, drinks, gelato and coffee.It's a must go if your in the neighborhood",,,
16,Michael G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,0,1.0,12/30/2015,"We were visiting the city and stopped in for a quick bite. There were 3 of us and we got 3 chicken noodle soups. The noodles were mushy. Since the soup was so bad we opted to get something else so I grabbed some bean salad. While purchasing the bean salad I mentioned the soup with mushy noodles and the guy at the counter said in broken English ""soup done"". I took that to mean they are not serving it anymore.As I ate the chickpea salad the beans were frozen. I was hungry and starting to get upset. The soup cost $17 and so did the salad. I wanted my money back and the guy at the counter gave me a hard time but didn't want to make a scene in front of the other patrons so he reluctantly gave me $3 back.

20,Stephanie A.,"Jamaica Plain, Boston, MA",8,15,0,5.0,3/29/2014,"Came in here yesterday for a breakfast sandwich and friends, the wait was LONG. This seems to be mostly due to the construction worker ahead of me in line who ordered about 10 sandwiches, so I can't really fault the deli for that. They made my bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel relatively quickly and it was a warm, cheesy delicious sandwich experience! And at $3.50, pretty reasonably priced. I went back today for lunch because I noticed the plethora of choices while I was there yesterday. They have freshly made sandwiches, wraps, quesadillas, panini, etc, etc, etc in the deli counter and if you can't find something there they will make whatever you want to order. They have hot and cold food buffets, sushi, gelato, tea, coffee, I believe I saw smoothies,  and all the snacks and drinks you'd hope to find in a store. The options are really endless. Prices on some things seem a bit high ($2 for a 20 oz bottle of coke...oof) but it is midtown, and nothing was outrageous.I went with the buffet and got Greek salad, chicken,  and mashed potatoes for a little over $8 (buffet is $7.99/lb) and I wasn't disappointed. There are chunks of feta on the salad, and being a feta fanatic, I was in heaven. I'd imagine this place gets quite busy during the week, so keep that in mind. But if you have time and want a crazy amount of things to choose from, this is a good bet.",,,

Seeing that I still go out on Saturday nights I like to sleep in on Sunday morning. This does not bode well for my love of breakfast food whenever I want breakfast food.Its located across the street from the Hilton Hotel so if your staying there like we were for a night its a quick walk back and forth across the street. There is a little place to sit down outside as well as inside. There is a whole mini-market inside ranging from fresh olives to cereal and milk if you're needing some groceries.They do not police the outside seating area so be weary of homeless people staring at you like we did. Here's the catch the old spanish man making your food grunts at you as you order and doesn't actually acknowledge that your food is ready. The last thing NYC needs is another jerk, especially when your paying. He is hard to understand because he speaks in broken english in loud bursts. Not good at all for hangovers or morning grogginess. I understand that is how deli's have to be when they get busy, but when its not there is not reason to be in ""pushy deli commando character"". Its my money and I'll order when I'm ready. Don't expect any answers to your questions at this place.If you order something that is not listed it is very difficult to get a price. I assume that they don't care because I asked twice for a price and got a no response other than repeating what I had ordered. I got a toasted bagel, loxs, and cream cheese that cut me back $6.45. I got the price when the old, rude, latino man physically wrote the price on the wrapping of the cream-cheese, loxs, and bagel. I understand this is Manhattan but this deli is not ""Gourmet"" in any sense of the word. The fact that it has a buffett that is not exactly fresh, smells suspect, and when I went almost empty is a very bad sign.Save your money for the Halel Cart outside, they're definitely not gourmet but they'll treat you with respect and are light years ahead on being polite. The deli sandwich had lox that were a bit fishy tasting. There was a good amount of meat, say 2oz lox for a closed bagel and 3oz of heavy cream cheese. The bagel was soft and par for NYC deli. Again there is nothing Gourmet about this place and I would go elsewhere before ever returning here again. I did not give any other stars because this deli did not even try to earn them.",1,3,1
44,Krissy O.,"East Meadow, NY",131,139,0,1.0,10/8/2010,If I could give this place zero stars I would have. I mean how do you screw up a bagel not toasted with butter? Tasted like onion. Not in the good way. Repulsive. Inedible. A freaking shame.,4,4,
45,Virginia H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",12,5,0,1.0,6/15/2014,"Very poor service!!! My mother and I went in here looking for a typical New York deli. She got a pastrami combo. I opted to order from a ""build your own sandwich"" type option found on the far left side of the menu. I began placing my order, and the man (in his poor English) gives me a dirty look and says ""What?! I can not do this, I can not make food, only what is already made. I will not make it for you."" I repeated my order again, and told him that it was on the menu, even daring to point it out to him. He again says ""No, I won't make this."" So, even though the food was on the menu, he decides he's just gonna make his own rules and not make it for me. Frustrated, I instead order a philly cheese steak (which he decides that he can cook). He took 10 MINUTES with both my and my mom's order, and was reading from the instructions the entire time. He gave us another angry look when he finallyy gave us our sandwiches. Although the cashier was really sweet and looked rather apologetic, the food was greasy and undercooked, we will not be returning.",,,

Great food at a great price.I had a corned beef on white with the peanut slaw. I was planning on eating half and saving the other half, but it was so good I ate the whole sandwich and was stuffed afterwards.Would I go back? YES!",1,1,1
47,Eric S.,"Minneapolis, MN",157,41,0,2.0,3/26/2011,There is nothing special about the food here. Just run-of-the-mill deli food. The hot buffet food is not made with any interesting spices.,1,1,
48,Joel C.,"Mukilteo, WA",44,24,29,3.0,3/23/2011,"This is a true NYC deli, very fast paced.  If your ordering from the counter be ready with what you want or they just skip you.  I have eaten there twice, first I had a Hot Pastrami...  This was great!  It didn't say it had Jalaeno's on it on the menu, so I was a little surprised.  But it really made the sandwhich!  Second time I decided to try breakfast, which was an egg sandwhich with bacon, and cheese on a roll.  Which started off good until I got towards the end and found that the last strip of bacon wasn't cooked all the way.  Yuck, appetite gone.  Sometimes too much speed is a bad thing.  So I am 50/50 on this place.",1,1,
49,Ted C.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",7,27,3,3.0,1/7/2011,"I believe this is a case of an establishment getting a ""B"" rating and then attempting to improve things.  I really did not notice anything being ""dirty"" as a previous reviewer suggested.  It was well kept and neat on the 3 occasions I was there.  The service was also good and they sell Boar's Head cold cuts on their sandwiches at VERY reasonable prices.  Their Ruben was very good, as was their Italian Sub.",1,1,

51,Ericka C.,"Miller Place, NY",236,78,0,3.0,9/4/2009,"Kind of a greasy-food place, but it's very close to my job and they have a large selection. Importantly, they sell 5-Hour Energy shots.",1,,
52,Chris B.,"Austin, TX",118,666,1,3.0,1/30/2007,"I used to love this place when I came to New York for an annual industry trade show, but on this latest trip I found the food to be a bit lacking in the tasty department -- which of course might be related to my choice of sandwich more than anything else. Taste aside, if you're staying at the Hilton and in need of just about any sort of quick food you can imagine, then this deli is for you. Or if you're like me, you'll wish you just went back to the halal cart on the corner.",1,,1

54,Nick D.,"San Francisco, CA",178,75,1,3.0,2/27/2008,"Since I work next door I am a frequent customer of the so-called ""Dirty Deli"" (the local's name for it - only losers really call it the ""West 53rd St. Gourmet Deli""). This place is hit-or-miss. The guys at the grill are machines and push the limits of how much food 1-2 people can pump out in a given time. They're all about speed, so can be unforgiving if you get confused or screw up while trying to order. However if you're a returning customer, know what you're doing, and come across savvy and on the ball, they will hook you up with the good stuff. The Korean counter ladies also don't take too well to bumbling slowpokes, especially when the line is long. Breakfast is legit. Don't be constrained by the menu - you can really order whatever you want. As for lunch, cold cut sandwiches are so-so, but they make a mean chicken parm or quesadilla. Noodle bar is decent. The buffet is a real crap shoot. Sometimes you get a good hearty meal. Other times you end up spending the better part of the afternoon on the john. Avoid the seafood, especially after noon (when it's been sitting out), and take it easy on the yams because they charge by weight and those heavy suckers could be running you a buck apiece. Overall, the ""Dirty Deli"" is a reasonable place for a quick snack or meal, but it's not exactly ""Gramercy Tavern"" or ""per se."" Take it for what it is and don't expect too much. Oh yeah, and they also sell beer there. Just finish it before your boss sees you with it.",2,2,
