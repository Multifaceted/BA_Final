1,Nathan N.,"Middlebury, VT",190,210,4075,5.0,11/9/2018,"We were supposed to meet our friend Maleka here because she had to speak at an event for her old high school. In the end, we didn't run into her until a few days later in a different part of New York City. The momentary confusion was a bit frustrating,but this has all passed now.Central Park is the park of New York City, and New York City is the city's city. Having a large patch of plant life in this urban concrete jungle is by all accounts a good thing. It gives city folk (like myself) a necessary escape from the the construction, into something natural and alive.Packed with trees in a city where pollution is a given, Central Park serves as the epicenter of greenery that purifies the air and offers clean oxygen in return. I guess I am being super theoretical and poetic about this park, but it is also gorgeous.During the summer you can catch people sunbathing or be a sunbather. You can probably play with some toy boats. You can also try to get lost for fun!A symbol of New York City, this is a free stop to make if you're ever touring Vermont!",,,
2,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,5.0,11/9/2018,"There is admittedly something silly about reviewing Central Park, but despite being born and raised in NY I'm only just now appreciating how incredible it is. I credit some of that with watching the Ric Burns PBS documentary on NY, but also with suddenly discovering how badly I need nature to feel good, which is the whole reason the park was created in the first place.Our grid system was mapped out before we even had enough buildings or people to fill it, our expansion was clearly going to swallow the island so they just planned for that. But they didn't plan for green space, and everyone was miserable without fresh air or a way to get the hell away from each other. Central Park was meant to address all that, so after we had flattened this island that was made of natural hills, we kicked out the Irish and Africans who had their shanty towns in this particular spot, and made a bunch of nice, artificial hills that created an insulated oasis from the cesspool that has always been the greatest city in the world. What's not to love?!The creators of the park also intended it to be a space where rich and poor alike, where every type of New Yorker, could coexist together. The whole world comes here, and you can hear it and see it, or ignore it and make it your own, and everyone is doing everything all at once. The 72nd street playground has not one, but two of the right type of tire swings: the ones that lay horizontal instead of vertical. This is free magic! Go and spin yourself sick! Not far from that by 5th avenue is a beautiful wood gazebo called the Dene that offers a gorgeous view, especially at night.While you can argue every part of the park is for children, the area from the Dairy (visitor center and gift shop - full of neat stuff by the way) to the zoo was specifically designed so kids could meander from one thing to the next, like the Alice in Wonderland and Hans Christian Anderson statues. I think it's every half hour that the clock above the entrance to the zoo plays nursery rhymes while the bronze animals rotate and spin. By the Loeb Boathouse (crazy expensive food, have never eaten there) you can rent a boat for a reasonable price, or be rowed about for $45 per hour, which is still cheaper than either those pedicab or horse carriage tours. The entire Bethesda Terrace area is one of my favorites (except the bathrooms, which seriously need to be upgraded and have the most impossibly tiny stalls). According to that PBS documentary, the Bethesda Fountain's angel was seen as ""homely"" and more like a ""milkmaid"" when it was first unveiled, and some people think of it as the people's angel. At night, the lower terrace lights up, and the ornate ceiling gives off a regal glow that looks like something out of a fairy tale.In the summer, the conservatory garden overflows with a meticulously curated arrangement of diverse flowers, situated around beautiful fountains. With no bikes or traffic, it's one of the most relaxing places in the park.I also love the feeling of getting lost in the Rambles (not just for sex anymore, they also have birds now!). And everyone loves Belveder's Castle so I won't lay it on any thicker. Possibly my very favorite part of the park is one people don't always make it up to: The North Woods. The largest ""wild"" section of the park, it was designed to resemble the Adirondacks. It has the second oldest structure in the park, dating to the war of 1812: the Blockhouse, so deep and quiet and not restored, you feel like you've stumbled onto an abandoned building in the wilderness. There is a trail following along the Ravine and the Loch that leads you deep into the woods, under multiple arches, a small stream, and waterfalls. There are multiple areas where you can't hear a single person, a single car. Because of that, it gets a little shady at night. There's also a public pool, tennis courts, ice skating, terrible dry salty pretzels, musicians, artists, wedding pictures, concerts, bike rentals, tours, vendors, and labeled lampposts to tell you where you are (first 2 numbers are the street you're on, the second 2 tell you the side of town you're on- even East, odd West). You can count on seeing something new every time you visit, and it's one of the great things in New York that is neither overrated or ruined by tourists.",1,,2

I really just wanted to give this place 5 stars, so I'll end my review right here lol.",7,2,6
4,Josh G.,"Arlington Heights, IL",100,104,234,5.0,11/5/2018,"How can you not love Central Park? In a city as large as New York, there is this massive area of greenery with lots of things to do and see? It's iconic, historic, and beautiful. It is a must see if you are a first time New York City visitor. I've only been twice and I spent a whole afternoon just wandering around the park and not even seeing everything. The second time, I just walked the length of the park which is quite a long ways. The botanic garden vibe near the north-eastern side of the park is spectacular. Central Park is what all parks should strive to be. It is an oasis in a city full of skyscrapers. It is beautiful and timeless. It's a great place to relax or enjoy some exercise.If this is your first time to New York City, you owe it to yourself to check out and visit Central Park. You can easily spend a full day here if you want to explore all of what it has to offer.",2,,3
5,Janet I.,"San Jose, CA",15,150,781,5.0,10/27/2018,It's beautiful unfortunately for us it's rainy and windy. Thank you hurricane Willa.We saw a few people brave enough to take a carriage ride and continue streaking through the park despite the rain and wind. Our umbrellas kept flipping inside out. We had enough.There were still squirrels scampering around the ground and birds flying around.You could see tall hotels in the background.I recall the huge rocks and tunnel from the 2nd Home Alone movie.,4,4,5
6,Jeff B.,"Des Moines, IA",147,271,86,5.0,11/5/2018,"What a place.  I've visited a few times.  It's a very nice park with lots of options to check out.  My most memorable was taking a pedi-taxi through the park.  Our guide told us all kinds of interesting stories about all the items we passed, and also those things you could see in the distance.  We were so impressed with our guide, he got a plentiful tip as a thanks.  So peaceful in the park as well.  Even a view of the park from the outside looking in, seems so inviting away from the hustle of the city.  If you need a break from the city, or just want to take in some neat sights, check out Central Park, it's well worth it.",,,
7,Violet P.,"Edmonton, Canada",111,1090,580,5.0,10/11/2018,"Within the concrete jungle of Manhattan is the serene oasis of Central Park. I was glad our hotel want far and made a few visits to the park. The first time we didn't venture too far but with my large pretzel in hand, we found bench seating to people and carriage watch. It was funny as most drivers were staring at their cellphones and looked bored. There must not be a distracted carriage driver law here. The buggy drivers had their rates posted on the side and the rate per minute varied. There were lots of joggers and walkers on that Sunday. The next day we walked through the park on our way to the museum. I liked it wasn't very busy and lots of green space and flowers. We walked to Strawberry Fields where lots of tourists seemed to visit. I wish I could have spent more time wandering more north into the park. Next time, I'll spend more time here!",2,2,2
8,Leila R.,"Charlotte, NC",786,1166,13108,5.0,10/11/2018,"I absolutely LOVE Central Park, and what I adore most about it is that you can visit it multiple times and still discover something new and beautiful on each visit! The world's largest urban park is really a destination in and of itself, and is ripe for exploring with a multitude of landmarks, points of interest, and countless other things to do. It is the perfect place for the juxtaposition of relaxation and amusement in nature, encapsulated within the nonstop hustle and bustle of one of the no(i)siest cities on Earth! Whether you are canoeing the lake, jogging or walking under the numerous, gorgeous stone arches, seeing a famous landmark, or just sitting atop a rock and taking in one of the last remaining primeval forests in the world, CP is not to be missed, as a tourist or a local. I love very few places in NYC the way I do Central Park. It speaks to my primordial soul over the cacophony of car horns, yelling vendors, and white noise of modern life in that ancient voice of Nature, and every time I come here, I always seem to leave feeling more human than when I entered.",1,1,4
9,Shuné D.,"Riverview, FL",212,362,3673,5.0,10/2/2018,"I've had many memories here as a kid in NYC either having weekend outings with my family or field trips with my school. I live in Florida now. New York City is full of many neighborhood parks throughout, but this is their largest one. I have walked this park from north to south a few times. Good exercise. There's so much to do here as with any park. The only difference is that you're surrounded by the beautiful city scape of Manhattan, New York. There's lots that go on around here. For example, concerts, street performances randomly throughout, bicycle trails, running, ice skating during the winter time at the Waltman rink, climbing boulders/rocks, rowboat around the ponds/lakes, take many scenic photos, picnic, etc. This park has some very interesting geology also. With many exposed bedrock boulders known as umpire rock all throughout the park which have been there for hundreds of millions of years. You can even see the shiny speckles of minerals glistening in the sunlight if you pay attention. Photos can't really pick this up. There's an interesting article about this here: centralparknyc.org/thing…Given that you have enough time to do this on your trip to New York, if you're from out of state, this park is definitely worth a visit.",3,1,2
10,Aisha N.,"New York, NY",123,66,150,5.0,10/16/2018,I love Central Park. It brings back so many memories everytime I come. It provides that much needed  greenery in the center of Manhattan. For the first time we decided to go boating in the central pond. It was so much fun. I definitely recommend especially to take friends who are visiting. It's relatively cheap 20-30 bucks for an hour.,1,,
11,Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",401,1407,1784,5.0,9/6/2018,"Within walking distance from Times Square, about 15 minutes!The park itself is HUGE. If you're planning to explore by foot, leave aside a couple of hours. This huge park is the smallest bit of nature in the big city, but is so huge that you'd forget you're even in the city. If you want to save a bit a time, I recommend renting a bicycle to explore more of the park. There are tiny rental shops on the outskirts of the park, or you can also book ahead online to rent bikes. I think they even give you a discount for doing it through their website.My friends and I were short on time and were only able to spend about an hour here. The park is very pretty with lakes, bridges, bikeways and walkways for you to use for sightseeing. My friends and I sat on a giant rock to hide ourselves from the sun since it was 92 degrees in the city, but the humidity was just too much on us Californians.I recommend bringing a sandwich, a good book, some water/juice, and lots of sunscreen to spend a picnic kind of day here. Central Park is truly an iconic park.",7,4,6

For a person who loves great walks around Central Park to a nice bike ride. Then you will love every minute of Central Park.If you are visiting New York. Central Park should be on top of your list to visit. From beautiful horseback carriages to great cafes. If you are coming to Central Park you also have great bicycle tours to enjoy Central Park.My option Central Park is one of the nicest Parks in the United States. Even of the best ones in the world.

Several museums sit on the edges, and there is also a lake which I didn't know until I came here! It's well-laid out with plenty of trails. There are benches and other areas where you can sit and rest or people-watch. It's definitely what I consider as quintessential NYC. It's a great space to get away from the noise and concrete jungle of Manhattan as Violet P. mentioned. My only regret is that we were there right before the fall colors started coming in which I'm sure only adds to the beauty of the park.",2,,1
16,Melissa N.,"Chantilly, VA",2507,584,2299,5.0,8/1/2018,"What can I say about Central Park that hasn't been said already? Central Park is the green heart of New York City.  The park is around 843 Acres. So you might need a whole day or a few days to actually explore  this iconic park. There are hundreds of things to see and do. There's no way you can ever get bored.  There are concerts, tours, sports, horseback riding,  fitness classes, the Central Park Zoo, sightseeing, and much more.I like finding out about the hidden gems of the park. Maybe they're not hidden gems anymore but they're certainly the areas least explored. I did not explore the whole park because that would be way too much for one day. But my favorite area so far is Shakespeare Garden.  Especially during the early morning when there's no one around you can just sit, reflect, and meditate. There is a company that provides a free walking tour. The tour is 2 hours and covers the southern half of the park.  5 stars for one of the world's most beloved and known parks.",21,8,19
17,Lisbeth M.,"Hialeah, FL",87,39,82,5.0,11/14/2018,"This park is a dream!!! It is the most famous parks of the USA for a reason, you MUST come and check It out. There are street musicians playing all over the park which sets a beautiful tone everywhere you go. There's a gorgeous boathouse, a couple of bars, ice skating, and tons of other things to do. I even saw a couple of weddings as I strolled along. Then next time I go I plan to have a picnic. This park is perfect, my favorite part of NYC",1,,

It's too big to really see everything in one visit. But whether it's your first, tenth, or fiftieth visit to NYC, the Park is always worth a stop if you're nearby. On our trip to to NYC last week, we visited the New York Historical Society, which faces the west side of the Park. So we wandered over. Unfortunately, the weather was humid beyond belief, so we didn't stay long, but we were able to make it to the lake for a few minutes. Everyone has favorite places in the park, but my favorite places to visit are Bethesda Fountain (I love the tiles), the Lake, and Belvedere Castle. But explore the Park and find your favorite spots!",1,,2

It is such a beautiful place for all to enjoy. We walked along, Starbucks in hand of course, to the reservoir and enjoyed watching some ducklings and turtles relax on the rocks.Everyone was in good spirits, as it was a Sunday afternoon, and not too much of a hustle and bustle atmosphere. Will absolutely return again.",3,1,2

21,Priscilla L.,"Houston, TX",18,70,335,5.0,8/17/2018,"Grand Central Park remains one of the highlights during my trip to New York. Of course, I rented a bike, because there's no way I'd be able to walk the entire park and enjoy it. I rented the bike for about two hours and finished riding the entire park within an hour and a half. When you rent your bike, I'd say two hours is an appropriate amount of time to sightsee what the park has to offer. Plus, make sure to request a basket and get a map for easier navigation. It's absolutely grueling going uphill, but unexpectedly thrilling and satisfying when you fly downhill. As I cruised on my bike through Grand Central Park, I was immersed in another world, and despite the hopes that the trees would have already begun to alter in colors, the journey was absolutely worth it and enchanting. Furthermore, just like walking the streets of New York you must also abide by the traffic lights and yield while handling your bike.In spite of the grueling exercise, you can come as glammed as you want because the sweat is going to make you glow even more in your pictures. Don't worry the sweat adds a beautiful glow, oh, and don't forget to bring spare comfy kicks unlike myself who wore flats and had both feet cramp up, so extra. While riding uphill you should shift gears to a lower setting to help with the uphill pedaling, and when cruising at a leveled altitude your gear should desirably be around a five and up for a  more rhythmic pedaling.All I can say is that Central Park is enchanting in ways I can't explain, so come ready for an adventure.",,,1

In such a big city .. what a treat to have such an amazing green space to to relax. seems far away from concrete and sirens .. for them that much grass and trees is such a treat. I live in the country so i am more impressed with all the architecture, and activity of the city. But either way central park is one of the must see's.  They claim it takes 8 hours to see it all .. we saw the highlights in 3 or 4.   We stayed 4 nights in NYC .. 2 nights at 2 nearby Hiltons .. both within walking distance from central park.  We also took a carriage ride as it was getting dark.  The tour guy at first said the longer ride was with the bike carriage but once we got in the carriage he up sold us to the longer and more expensive ride .. it soon got dark and we missed several thing he claimed he'd show us but it was still a dream come true. I'd never done the carriage ride anywhere and no better place to experience it. the first day it was too late to enter the park but we waited till our last day to walk around in the  park. the other day we took tour bus ride all along the outside of central park in various areas and all  around. The day we walked in the park it was really warm but not the 100 degree oven it had been.  they gave us the free map but the google app was pretty helpful. the park is huge and we got turned around a few times.  wanted to see a bridge and alice and wonderland statue.  saw venders and street performers .. nice fountain.  great way to kill time before our later flight.  .. great way to say good bye for now to the city.",3,1,1

There's so many different landmarks abound - but each visit is unique and different as the experience never gets old! Bring your walking shoes, be sure to map out where you entered from since cell service is tough, and definitely have time on your hands as you never know what you'll wander into.

It's a gigantic urban park in the middle of the city, I believe it's over 800 acres running from upper west side to upper east side. When we visited in April, it was still cold, dark, nothing blooming, so basically still winter. It was fine, we enjoyed walking all over the park and checking out Strawberry Fields, The Mall, Bethesda Fountain Plaza, Bow Bridge, The Carousel, The Pond, and so much more I am forgetting. We just walked & walked, sat and relaxed, had a snack (not from the hot dog guys), it was real nice to enjoy the scenery and to be in the park. A lot of people are running, exercising, some street performers, carriage rides are offered for a heavy price (smell of horse poop is complimentary), maps of the park are around in case you get lost, there are some information booths as well.  A definite must visit when coming to NYC!",14,9,16
36,Joe P.,"Charlotte, NC",93,533,348,5.0,7/8/2018,"America's most famous urban park is a 840-acre oasis in the sea of concrete that is Manhattan Island, with walking trails, lakes, meadows, dense forest, playgrounds, and even its own castle. There's not much I can add that hundreds of other reviewers have already covered, other than to say that no visit to New York is complete without a stroll through Central Park. The City's recent decision to ban motorized vehicle from the park's roadways has turned it into even more of a retreat than it was before, where the quiet whisper of bike wheels has replaced the angry wail of car engines, and friendly bells take over from abrasive horns. Whether you come to hear a concert on the Great Lawn, boat on the Lake, eat at the world-famous Tavern on the Green, or are just passing through on your way from one museum to another, Central Park will leave an indelible mark that will keep you coming back for more. There will always some new corner to explore and some new activity to try, so don't try cramming it all into one trip. Just take your time absorbing the landscape and enjoying the glorious Manhattan skyline just over the treetops. You'll fall in love with this place for a lifetime.",,,
37,Abigail R.,"New York, NY",2438,274,963,5.0,4/26/2018,"This is the best park we have here in New York City. It goes all the way from 59th -to like 110th. I've been to Central Park a lot of times today I attempted to walk the entire park and I did! (Well kind of) the thing about Central Park is that you can easily get lost or walk around in circles lol. My journey began at 59th Columbus circle   Right at this entrance you have the horse and carriage as well as bike and rental . This park is beautiful and has plenty of things to do on a gorgeous sunny or rainy day. They have boat rides ,restaurants , museums and many playgrounds for children.  In the summer time there's even more to see such as Victoria gardens, the pool , carousel and the list goes on. What I love about this park is the beautiful views, all the hidden cascades and of course the flowers.  Central Park it's great for hiking, jogging and walking. On top of that they also have a zoo! Not as large as the Bronx or queens but a decent zoo. In the winter time they have the ice skating ring so plenty to do all year long. There's also lots of hot dogs stands and about 2-3 restaurants (tavern on the green and loeb boathouse). I want to say that I started out at 59th street and then I walked to like 94th and somehow ended up again back at 59th street so be careful as there are many paths that may lead you back to point A! lol it's a maze but a very beautiful one to get lost in.",45,18,36

Harlem Hill is no joke. the smell of horse poop is definitely a motivator to go faster.aside from running, there's great events here (Oktoberfest is a blast) and of course the various aesthetic gems - the Conservatory to get some (relative) peace and quiet, the statue of Fred Lebow to inspire my runs, the Bethesda terrace/arcade, Civil War GOAT General Sherman, Strawberry Fields, and so much more.I feel like no matter how many times I've been here, I always find something new, or at the very least notice something that I may have forgotten about.the only downsides are the smell of the horses and the massive number of people once there's nice weather. eh, I can deal with it sporadically, but you mutants better not walk aimlessly at me!",5,4,7

Favorite spot: The Mall - just so darn picturesque and tranquil.Most surprised by: The Alice in Wonderland statute - it was bigger than I thought it would be and the detail was beautiful. Photos don't do it justice.Most impressive spot: The whole Bethesda Terrace/Fountain area - when you walk toward the fountain from either above or below, the reaction is just ""wow!""How wonderful that New Yorkers have this oasis in which to find some peace in such a chaotic city!

I (almost) wish it was snowing when I went, you know, ""for the gram"" photos but, I wouldn't have been able to walk through the park considering I was already freezing! Tons of people, cyclists, joggers, tourists and locals alike just enjoying the day.My friend lead me to the ""Friends fountain"" which was cool because that seemed to be where everyone played, took photos, and just centralized --- get it?! lolThere were ""park performers"" with giant bubble machines and some dancing performers.I really wanted to check out ""Strawberry Fields"" and the ""Imagine"" landmark. Which, ironically, when you cross the street is the building that John Lennon used to live in (aka the building his was shot in front of).

49,William G.,"Torrance, CA",2571,1691,3976,5.0,7/16/2018,"Ah, the famous Central Park!I first set foot here while sightseeing around my beautiful new city. I was with friends, one of which flew in with me and knows NYC very well. Since we were located in the touristy southern end of the island, this was the portion that we explored.The first thing I want to emphasize is that this park is HUGE! Walking it in its entirety will take quite a bit of time, and required good endurance. Jogging it would make for good exercise if you are an conditioned runner. And as for bikers... bad news. You cannot ride your bike inside the park. This made me thankful that I didn't rent a bike before coming here.There are numerous bodies of water inside the park. My friends and I walked around some, coming to a nice bridge that is a good spot to take photos. There is also a place to rent row boats, and a lakeside restaurant/bar where you can sit and enjoy the ambient.The greenery is thick here, with a high canopy in many areas of the park. It is a nice sight, seeing the greenery with the buildings in the background. Dusk and dawn make for some dramatic photo-taking opportunities.The park was busy, but the trails were manageable. There were several events going on, from wedding receptions, to outdoor summer concerts. At the southern end of the park, there are horse carriages for rent. They quoted us several prices, but they only venture into the southern third of the park. We passed this time around, as my friends and I resolved to explore the southern third of the park on foot. We were glad we did, as we were able to go through some less-taken paths.Updates to this review will come in future dates, when I explore the middle and upper thirds of the park. Stay tuned, folks!",17,12,19

51,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",203,238,1439,5.0,4/18/2018,"While Alecia Keys may sing about New Yorks ""concrete jungles where dreams are made of"", there's also an actual real jungle that makes dreams in this city. Central Park seems impossible to understand in contrast to the buildings that seem to shoot up just on the border of the park, always threatening to encroach on the quiet sanctity of the park. Stretched out across avenues and running from the top of Midtown to the edge of Harlem, there's no denying Central Park is big - just looking at a map will reinforce that. But it takes actually going into the park, feeling lost on the trails, both miles away from the city, yet inescapably right in the heart of it all. No matter what you're looking to do outdoors, Central Park offers it. Take in a stroll around the reservoir, gaze out from the top of Belvedere castle, have a jog around the park, go for a picnic in the play field, it's all right here in the middle of New York",2,1,2
52,Steve A.,"Hilliard, OH",852,1390,1959,5.0,5/8/2018,"A massive park. It might be the best known thing about New York. There's literally miles of green space surrounding interesting sculptures. It's impossible to mention everything. That's because it's impossible to see everything in the same trip. It's hard figuring what to do first. Probably just start at the bottom and work yourself up. If you want to cover the most ground, you have a few choices. They will cost you though. Busses and subways have access. They won't get you through the actual park though. A popular option are the horses. Taking a horse carriage is actually slow and you can't just get off whenever you feel like. Maybe the best choice is bikes. You can move along whenever you please. It has so much to see that one review can't cover it. For more see the separate reviews on the attractions. The maps at the kiosks are helpful for sightseeing.",1,1,1

It exceeds expectations and sets new ones for parks everywhere. Fun Fact: the Architect of this park is Frederick Law Olmsted and for your Montreal-ers reading, he also co-designed Mount Royal Park!! How amazing is that!!Anyways, I don't think I really need to write a review for Central Park because it's 200% likely you will visit if you're in New York and if you don't.... WHY NOT?",4,2,3
54,Daniel P.,"Tallahassee, FL",285,747,4550,5.0,3/15/2018,"It's clearly outlandish folly to ""write a review"" for Central Park.  You're not going to be reading this in consideration of whether you're going or not - so let's just call this me ""padding my Yelp numbers"" - for whatever that's worth!But - dear reader - I intend on giving you something interesting that I'm personally familiar with - so here goes.  My list of ""cool / obscure things in Central Park"" (this doesn't cover all the obvious stuff...).One could visit Central Park 100 times and not yet know Central Park.  Truly, there are nooks/crannies throughout.While the main venues/attractions are well known by locals/visitors alike, there are a handful of cool destinations within the park that merit detours, namely:1.  NYCs famed drinking water flows freely through central park - There's a pool grotto on West 100th that hides the sources for a number of manmade water falls.  check 'em out.  (oh, and Google ""NYC drinking water"") - The water falls themselves are very nice - Again, you'll find all of these on the seldom-visited North side (since visitors are often mid-town hotels, and don't venture this far up).2. The remnants of Seneca Village.  Yep - there was a middle-class village (not a shanty-town, nothing of squalor) located between 81st and 89th on the west side.  The city, through imminent domain, took over the land and bought all the settlers out.  There's one remaining foundation of the original village visible at around 85th.  Look for it.3. There is a survey bolt from the 1811 project that laid out the Manhattan grid.  This would have been a marker denoting a future street intersection - which would make sense since the park hadn't been considered during the grid development. If you have the time, look around what would have been the intersection of 65th and Sixth Avenue.4. Central Park was initially stopped at the north at 106th - but subsequently, was extended to 110th, because it was determined that the land had little real estate value.  you can notice the extension at where the 106th demarcation line was.5. If you get disoriented (lost) in the park, lamposts will help you out.  look closely, and you'll find a four-digit number.  The first two indicate the closest street.  the last digit (last two, but, obviously only the last matters) indicate East or West.  Even is East.  Odd is West.  So - you really can't get too lost...6.  Fishing in Central Park? - You bet! - If you're an angler, it's actually pretty good too.  Oh, it's Catch-n-Release, so there's that.   Apparently, the Harlem Meer is the best body of water for it - hook yourself carp, catfish, bass or crappies.7. I haven't been - but I also know I haven't heard anyone talk about it - Shakespeare's Garden.  Apparently, there's a bench there that, if two of you sit on opposite ends, you can communicate with one another because of the curvature of the bench. (kinda like what you can do in various places at GCS - and the Alhambra, for that matter.",3,2,2

56,Kristian D.,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",369,1304,3330,5.0,1/26/2018,"I cannot believe that I never reviewed Central Park! After several trips to New York, I always end up walking through here several times. Central Park is located in central Manhattan and is the crown jewel of the New York Parks Department. Access is extremely easy with several subway stations near or directly adjacent to the park.We got lost the first time exploring Central Park. It is so large and full of trees and hills that you can easily get disoriented, forgetting that you are in the middle of Manhattan. The park is a true four seasons park with lush open areas for summer, beautiful trees for autumn, ice skating and carriage rides in the winter, and lots of flowers in the spring.There are so many activities in the park. Many concessionaires have special options year round, and the park boasts all the standard amenities including playgrounds, sports fields, and several ponds. Central Park is popular with runners and athletes, and I enjoy watching them pass by my park bench!The zoo and Metropolitan Museum of Art are in Central Park, but many of the city's popular museums are directly across from the park. This makes it easy to museum hop in good weather and linger before and after the museum hours. Many food vendors sell street food in and around the park, and many more restaurants are available in the vicinity.Everyone visiting New York should visit Central Park. It really appeals to all ages and abilities and can compliment activities for tourists and locals alike. It is an urban park and suffers from some of the typical negatives, but the park seems really safe during most hours. Nevertheless, Central Park is simply amazing and worth seeing in New York.",16,5,11

Here are a few words of advice from this local: please be thoughtful about which way you walk and if you're blocking the paths for others. Always try to leave it better than when you found it, NYers see this as a sacred place. Enjoy the roller skaters, they are an institution! If you take a call on a bench, don't be a douche, please watch your volume, New Yorkers go there to get a momentary reprieve from the hustle-bustle. The playground there is EPIC. Finally, the city is getting more safe, but just keep an eye out when you are walking on the more wooded paths; women walking alone have been attacked by homeless people.

NYC is multi-dimensional so when you enter Central Park you don't realize the city is humming around you.  We were staying near Central Park and decided to go exploring one afternoon.We started with a map from the Information desk, which was helpful to find some of the landmarks.  We had a drink at the Tavern on the Green, stopped at Strawberry Fields to see the Imagine Mosaic, hit the famous fountain and the mosaic tunnels and then got to check out the gift shop where I picked up some unique souveniers for family and myself. My husband rode a bike around but he said that he saw more walking than on the bike.  The carriage rides, while iconic, don't take you to the inner areas of the park.

62,Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",2057,1158,10014,5.0,12/16/2017,"Central Park is incredible....day, night, in any season as I have just learned after spending the first snowfall of the year there which by the way was insanely magical!!! It doesn't matter if you have specific plans in the park or not, you will ALWAYS stumble upon something interesting you weren't looking for so it's always a good idea to take a stroll. Street performers, dancers, bubble makers, magicians and more. Bring cash! These people are talented and provide awesome unexpected entertainment. I normally head in from the Upper West Side at the entrance near the Dakota at 72nd & Central Park West. If you don't know, that's where John Lennon lived and was shot. A few steps into the park from there is where you'll find the memorial to him with the iconic IMAGINE monument and ""Strawberry Fields"". You'll also find flowers left for him and many strolling musicians. This may be the way to go if you're a first timer as it's definitely a tourist attraction. If you do head in this way my favorite places to lunch before are Alice's Tea Cup when I have the kiddos and Blossom if you want to pick up some healthy nosh for a picnic! If you're ambitious, the Museum Of Natural History is also located just outside the park on 81st and can easily be done in combination. Oh, and if by chance you have a car with you, I found this is the best place to park My favorite things to do IN the park are by far Shakespeare in The Park, an annual FREE theater presentation at the theater inside the park and gondola boat rides you can pick up at Loeb Boathouse! Surprisingly they are cheap too! We first took one on our annual anniversary trip after has just come back from Italy. We had learned these gondolas were actually a gift from Venice! Our gondolier I still remember was named Antonio and was Italian. He serenaded is in Italian as the sun was setting. It was incredible and came with a bit of a history lesson of the area and he also pointed out where big hot shots such as Bloomberg and Beyoncé lived. Best $30 spent ever! A MUST!! When I have the kiddos we like to hit up the Alice in Wonderland statue and race toy boats in the pond. We sometimes hit the park up after visiting The Plaza for some high tea in Palm Court or shopping and playing at Eloise. It's another easy way to enter. Grab a fresh hot soft pretzel, some of those nuts from the street vendor and head in to feed the ducks. One could easily spend a good portion of the day here. It's such a fantastic, clean, well maintained opened space all like to frequent. Many celebrities hang out here and many things are filmed here so keep you eyes peeled. You never known who you'll see. I have never felt unsafe here even alone. I just wouldn't recommend hanging out at night as a single female.",17,9,14

Next time I'm in new york it will be for spring or fall so that I can ride a bike throughout the park. The first time I came here was during Christmas. We didn't see any snow but the weather and day was amazing couldn't have asked for better weather. We decided to walk and take our time instead touring it on a bike which I am so happy we did that because the second time I came here we took a tour and didn't much. The ice skating park was nice but way too busy during Christmas time. We walked to the Alice and wonderland statue, the castle in the water and explored under the bridges, and the local art vendors on Christmas day. Honestly leaving the park until Christmas day was the best idea! I recommend walking or renting bikes without a tour so you get the most out of the park.

You will never get lost if you use this trick, each lamp post has a number on it. Those four numbers aren't just some random designation: the first two tell you the nearest street (for example 77) and the second set tells you whether you're closer to the east or west side of the park (even numbers signal east, odd signal west)2. Best time to go is before weekdays. If you can only make it on the weekends then try to go to less popular areas of the park.

So many things to see; it's no wonder numerous shows and movies are filmed here.Let me briefly mention the perks of this park, or amazing things WITHIN. Besides its majestic size, here you will find:- Central Park Zoo (we unfortunately didn't get to check this out, this time around.)- Heckscher Ballfields (six baseball and softball fields near 63rd St.)- Tons of awesome arches & bridges -  perfect photo opps, don't forget your selfie stick... we were prepared and got this awesome Fugetek selfie stick that converts into a tripod, from Amazon. SO worth the $22. We took cool pics on these big rocks and different bridges and didn't have to bother anyone.) My favorite bridge by the way, is ""Bow Bridge"" because of Finn & Rachel (any GLEE fans reading this?!?)- Belvedere Castle - so upset that this was closed for maintenance when we went. Oh well, just another reason to return!- Strawberry Fields - didn't even know about this! It's located ""between 71st and 74th Streets - a 2.5 acre area of Central Park that pays tribute to the late Beatle, John Lennon, singer, songwriter, musician and peace activist."" (info taken from Central Park website.)- Tons of cool statues (we also didn't find any of these, probably because of the different trails we took. I really would love to find the Alice in Wonderland statue next time.)Well, I guess that wasn't really ""brief."" lol. But the above info, it isn't even half of what the park has to offer.  We walked/hiked around for a few hours and didn't even see half of everything.I would definitely check out the website for info on tours - walking and biking... also info on holding events here, including weddings. Can you imagine getting married here? That would be awesome!You will definitely get your steps and miles in here, be it walking/hiking (HELLO, HILLS!) or running, and biking. Perfect place for group dates, and especially romantic dates.  This place is actually open until 1am!Yes,  1am. Most parks I've ever been to officially close when the sun sets. Not here! Their hours daily are: 6am - 1am!A must-see and visit if ever in NYC. I will definitely return. No wonder it has over 2,000 reviews and has 5 stars! Here I am, just adding another 5 to their rating.",16,9,11

Updated review","Sprawling Green //  Activities GaloreBest Park for Adventures // Must VisitWhether you are visiting the Boathouse for lunch or watching live Jazz at Tavern on the green. There are plenty of places and opportunities to enjoy entertainment, dining, and special events here in the park. The Castle being a go-to destination if you have kids, or even just want a view of the skyline in alll directions. Turtles in the pods clearly fed by visitors always pop up in the springtime. The endless amount of artists, and a personal favorite in the summer being Susan, who comes with her husband near Columbus' state in the Gallery. She peacefully plays her violin, with a sign showing the name of the composer and the song she is playing. Great way to bring your little ones to enjoy live music up close and learn something new. Rollerskaters in the summer, bands in the band shell... artists lined up selling their own work. Bring your dog, row a boat, bring your picnic basket, or come watch a Broadway Show league game in the park. With the zoo, and the amusement park with rides, along with ice skating in the winter. This park really does have it all. The Scene: Fun, Healthy, EventsDestination Rating: 8Date Rating: 8Hob Nob Potential: 3Strong Suggestion: if you are lost or simply want to be more well informed. The park has an excellent app which I highly recommend: itunes.apple.com/us/app/…",8,5,7

72,Marjorie S.,"Enfield, CT",68,111,3,5.0,6/25/2018,"We love spending a couple of hours enjoying the refreshment of Central Park, people-watching, and generally taking in the diverseness of this photo-friendly respite.It is amazing to me that more people don't realize what the park has to offer: you can enjoy a paddle-boat ride on the lake, walk some of the 800plus acerage, visit when Shakepeare is playing, see park-friendly wildlife, take a guided tour, or just sit on a bench and drink it the beauty.We sat on a bench and found a young couple willing to chat. We were visiting, they were natives, so we chuckled at them telling us abut Hell's Kitchen, and us telling them about cattle ranches in South Dakota. A cultural exchange with strangers that made us feel very welcome.There is so much here you don't have to pack it all into the first visit, or even the first day. We will be back.",1,,2

One can either walk and explore or rent a bike, there are even bike and walking tours available and also horse and carriage rides. There is a zoo inside which I like. Its website has so much info as well as an event calendar. Huge park where one can spend just couple of hours to a full day. Just stroll across away from the traffic of the city and watch so many interesting things happen. There are activities for kids, play rides and a carousel around. Beautiful day to relax end enjoy the atmosphere and scenery.",,,1

75,Bruce K.,"Knoxville, TN",467,805,1505,5.0,6/27/2018,"It's Central Park. I mean, it's famous. Well, if you have to read reviews, I'm sure they can say nothing but praises about this park. This one from me will be short and simple.The Park is huge. There's plenty of places to walk to, plenty of things to see throughout the place. If you live in the city, well this is where you'll probably see some greenery. It's almost as if you stepped out of the city and into a wilderness... well at least a really well kept wilderness. There's a small pond if you want to paddle boating (beware that there is no shade when you are on the boat though). I'm pretty sure there has to be some kind of scavenger hunt challenge to see all the statues this park has as well, but I didn't bother to look. There's a ton of recreational activities. I saw volleyball just on a small walk through the park, and then a massive amount of people just laying out on the grass and soaking in sun. Yep. There's pretty much everything and if you want to just walk and just enjoy the small little nature that NY has, this is the place. If you get tired of the park, visit the museums that are literally adjacent to the park.",1,,1
76,Andrea A.,"Roseville, CA",172,109,110,5.0,8/19/2018,"I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love Central Park! It is my absolute favorite place in Manhattan and the most romantic place too in the city. If you are a first time goer to New York, Central Park is an absolute must. I remember when I visited here for the first time. My husband and I ( he was my boyfriend at the time) spent several days exploring the city and walking everywhere! Most people in New York travel on foot and really the only means of transportation in New York is either by subway or with a taxi. I was so awe of how beautiful New York was and how tall the buildings were; insanely tall. I never knew skyscrapers could be that enormous! I told my boyfriend (aka husband) that I desperately needed a relaxing day so he suggested that we should have a picnic in Central Park! We got a big blanket and bought some sandwiches and cold drinks at the Whole Foods at the Sunflower Market. We spread our blankets on the lawn and in the distance, there was a beautiful lake with snapping turtles, swans and boats too; wow! My husband pointed out all the areas in the park that are so famous like Shakespeare in the Park (that's where plays are performed), Strawberry Fields (I think that is the sight where John Lennon got shot) and the Dakota building (where the movie Rosemary's Baby was filmed)! I told my husband that I had to see all these amazing sights so we went and walked around the park and saw each and every one of these historic landmarks. We also visited the Belvedere Castle and walked to the top to have a view of the whole park. After lunch and exploring Central Park I noticed a vendor on the edge of the lawn; my husband bought a chocolate vanilla ice cream bar and I got a strawberry fruit bar to snack on because exploring the park was exhausting but amazing at the same time! My husband and I want to go back to New York and Central Park will be one of our first stops. This is a must see for anyone visiting the city; you will love it!",33,21,34
77,Shelby Z.,"Louisville, KY",416,728,797,5.0,7/3/2018,"How can you give Central Park anything less than 5 stars? It's the perfect getaway when you want to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Not to mention it streches pretty far - you could walk from top to bottom and probably take a little over an hour!   I love how they have plenty of separate roads/lanes for runners/bikers/walkers. Some of the lines are also only one way, so it keeps things pretty organized. they've got tennis courts, ponds (with mini sailboat racing!), you name it. I love walking down the sidelines of Central Park all while getting to view the beauty of the city. Once you get in the center, you feel like you're in a whole new place.",,,3

I can walk there during all day, eat some nuts with my friendly squirrels, take a small boat, sing songs with street musicians. This park has a lot of enters so better for you to choose where you want to go and what want to see there before your walk.Recommend by Mouse!",1,3,2
79,Vladmir T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1439,1008,2047,5.0,11/16/2017,"A Beautiful Preserve In The Heart Of The Concrete Jungle!Central Park is definitely one of the greatest things about Manhattan. Well you are surrounded by this concrete jungle of madness where even finding a parking spot can be a monumental task, this little paradise of nature allows you at least a momentary get away from all of the craziness.There are tennis courts and lots of really nice walking trails, benches to sit on and relax, and even grass to lay on and have a picnic if you so desire. Thank goodness it is not still part of the 1970s and 1980s filled with rampant crime and insanity plaguing the park. Today's Central Park appears to be a very clean and organized and safe place to enjoy a little bit of solitude in the city. It is my favorite part of New York City.",8,4,7
80,Christine S.,"San Jose, CA",85,401,118,5.0,9/12/2018,This was easily one of the top highlights from our first trip to New York. It's probably the area any tourist builds up the most in their minds because it's so iconic and represented so much in TV and film. We had only planned to walk the Mall and do the literary walk but Fashion Week closing down the famous fountain and the remodeling of the castle caused us to veer off our planned path. It ended up being a good thing because we stumbled upon areas I'd seen in films but didn't know they were in the park based on their name on Google maps. My advice would be to donate a good chunk of your day to exploring the whole south section. The North didn't seem as impressive to us or recognizable. I loved Central Park and it serves up some great picture opportunities for your scrapbooks.,1,,
81,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",485,3958,30000,5.0,5/20/2018,"How can you not love the large 750+ acres of land that is smack-dab in the middle of the Island?  This public park offers various attractions, such as the Alice in Wonderland and the Balto sculpture, the Conservatory and the Shakespeare Gardens, visitor centers, the carousel, fountains, a tranquil lake, various programs and activities throughout the year, tours, cafes, concession stands, and full-service restaurants, tours, and restrooms.You can have a picnic, take a stroll, do some jogging, stop by to chow down during your lunch break, take picturesque shots, and/or just check out various events.  The park is massive, and it's one way for people to get away from the hustle and the bustle of the big city to have some peaceful moments.The park is easily accessible, and going in and out is not difficult.  Definitely a great place to check out, both for history and for everything that it offers!",4,1,5

I recommend you visit the park when your in town!",,,
84,Tracy I.,"Kansas City, MO",125,448,833,5.0,7/2/2018,"It's an experience in itself. When in NYC it's a must stop. Yeah it's a park. It has trees, cool rock formations that are millions of years old, playgrounds and a zoo. Plus pop up carnivals, horse drawn carriage rides, rickshaw rides, etc...but it's an experience! Take the walking route, or if you're more adventurous you can rent a bike. Thankfully planners included Central Park in the heart of the city. It's even more incredible to see it from above!",,,
85,Travis T.,"Tempe, AZ",297,266,3511,5.0,8/6/2018,"Central Park is one of my favorite things about New York City. It's so massive (850 acres!) and there is so much to do and see. It's a nice break from the hustle and bustle of city life and perfectly located in the center of Manhattan. Built in the mid 1800's, I have visited Central Park on many occasions and still haven't see all of it. It's beautiful in both the summer and the winter. The fall leaves and frozen ponds make Central Park a gorgeous sight in winter. In the summer, it is so full of activity. The park has 36 bridges with the Gapstow and Bow bridges being my favorites. You can rent a rowboat for around $15 for the first hour. Strawberry Fields is 2.5 acres dedicated to John Lennon. You can always find some musician playing some of his songs at the Imagine mosaic (located across the street from The Dakota building where he was shot). I love seeing the rooftops of some iconic building peeking out over the trees. 55 Central Park West from the original Ghostbusters movie and the twin-towered San Remo are the easiest to spot. Horse carriage rides are all over and make for a nice day or evening ride. Several sculptures (almost 30) reside in the park that include Alice in Wonderland, Cleopatra's Needle, Christopher Columbus, Romeo and Juliet, The Falconer, Sherman Monument and Duke Ellington Memorial. There are 7 ornamental fountains, a carousel, remote control model sailboats and of course the famous Central Park Zoo. Bethesda Terrace and Fountain has been featured in several movies. Its two grand staircases and amazing stonework makes it a popular spot to visit. Several museums line the East side of the park that include The Met and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museums. I could go on about how much I love strolling through this park. My personal favorite is the music. I could lay in the grass for hours and listen to the many jazz musicians and guitarists that come out and play. Central Park is always a highlight that never gets old when I visit the Big Apple.",9,5,8

So much to explore and if you don't want to walk but still want to see a glimpse of everything, there are people we can take you on a carriage ride but it can be a little pricey but you can bargain with them. I recommend checking out the Bethesda Fountain and Terrance where there will probably be someone doing some opera singing which is great. Check out Bow Bridge and you can also rent a boat and go on the water. Lots of great pictures you can take here. You can also just lay on the lawn and enjoy the nature. Lots of great museum nearby.

The beauty of Central Park never fades, and walking in it always seems to yield a new hidden treasure. There's so much to see there!

I've been during warm weather, brisk fall days, and even snow and each time it is enchanting! There's no secret that this park is massive and each time I visit, I uncover a new section that's even more enchanting than the one before! My favorite part of the park are the grounds around the Loeb Boathouse. There's something so magical about the area that it takes you back to a simpler time when gentlemen used to court ladies by rowing them around the lake. Sigh. So lovely. If you're a visitor, or just new to NYC, you have to seek the solace that you can only find in Central Park!

We laid drinks and games out on a table and ordered pizza from a pizzeria nearby which delivered directly to our bench. There were plenty of trees that provided shade and a huge sunny open space where we played nerf ball and life size beer pong.

Updated review","On a nice day in NYC this is a great place to escape from the concrete jungle. This is nyc iconic park just north of times square. The park is absolutely huge. The South part is more crowded and has more activities. The North feels like a true nature walk ( Yes in the middle of New York City) There are usually street performers that are extremely talented and entertaining.If you're in the area or on your way to the Met, Museum of natural sciences or anywhere nearby, check it out! Or it can be a destination all by itself.  It's a happy  place during the day",,,
115,Alicia M.,"New Orleans, LA",1,67,31,4.0,10/21/2018,"If I didn't visit any other place in New York, I knew that I had to visit Central Park. This place is huge! We did a lot of walking and only covered maybe 1/4th of the Park. The park is hilly, so be prepared for inclines and declines. The grounds are absolutely beautiful, with areas dedicated for just sitting/lounging around. We rode the carousel and then visited the visitor's center. The staff were very helpful. They gave us a map, but it wasn't very helpful. We were able to gather general directions, but there weren't specifics on streets and landmarks. We had to ask someone for help on getting to the zoo. In the small portion of the park that we were able to see, we saw some beautiful views. If you have time, there are plenty of horses/carriages lined up along the exterior of the park. Definitely a must see!",,,

117,Sagir P.,"Alexandria, VA",245,271,378,4.0,6/29/2018,Great picnic date area!!! Went there in summer so just pick days wisely because its crowded on weekends. However went on a Thursday and was still quiet busy. First rented a boat and toured and it was majestic. Then went ahead a found a spot over looking the water which was romantic. Started to eat when a squirrel came by my date is terrified of critters. Im a country guy so it didnt bother me so being chivalrous and all I chased it away. But it kept coming back. So I was like poor guys hungry let me feed it. BIG MISTAKE!!! It brought friends and we ran out of there quick and in a hurry. Set up shop in a different place altogether and yet again squirrels appeared!!! Needless to say find a better spot in the open with less critter activity. But I guess thats how memories are made by chaos.,1,2,

One time i train-surfed to 57th street from Essex and visited this park and it was a huge rip off. It was surrounded by buildings that covered it in cold, capitalist shadows. There were hot dog stands IN THE PARK. Are parks supposed to mimic nature or hell? There were also lots of horses. They don't seem to have the theme straight. Another big issue is that there's ""no smoking allowed in the park."" Oh sorry, am I ruining the hot dogs for you? Give me a break. At the south edge of the park, there are literally thousands of people trying to rent bicycles and/or tours so I guess it actually is a hell theme. There is a zoo at the park as well but it costs money and if I wanted to see animals, I'd just take the free ferry to Staten Island.",,1,
125,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,5.0,6/6/2017,Probably the only quiet serene place in Manhattan you can visit or walk through and you don't feel like your in the city. Great place to hang out when you are bored. I was always told do not go into the park after dark. I will say the same thing. Only bad things can happen in the park after dark. But during the day there is enough ppl around. Also employees of the park drive there golf carts around. There is the loab and strawberry fields. There is a few baseball parks. The statures have been the same. There are places to run. Or bike in the park. I know it's Central Park and I shouldn't complain. But. Some days between the massive school trips and the no English speaking tourists who are not paying attention to where there walking. It can get annoying. Just my opinion tho. Overall. Central is a small piece of quite in the city. Nice place to come and escape the crazy.,5,3,7

Lastly the mall is just such a photogenic spot with the trees overhead. I have also had a Hot dog from central park. Not bad But next time if I see a nathan's cart, I'm buying. The more diverse goods are along the borders of the park while the generic Hot dog and pretzel are inside. There are so many movie references you Will see just walking around the park.

128,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1974,1202,14862,5.0,11/27/2017,"Walking through Central Park is just one of those iconic things you just have to do, whether it's your first or 50th trip to NYC. During my first visit (over the course of just three days in the city), I was fortunate enough to walk through the expansive park twice. Everything I had seen in Central Park was via movies (especially ""Home Alone 2"") so I was looking forward to actually seeing the park in real life. We walked through the park for about an hour early on a Sunday afternoon, after visiting the Top of the Rock and before our late-afternoon Broadway show. I wondered if the park would be crowded, since it was a weekend. But, it was actually rather pleasant. There were people, but not pushing crowds. We didn't of course make it through the entire park, but we made it to the bridge and the lake, and it was so serene to stand there and enjoy the view for a bit. It seemed like such a juxtaposition to have so much green in the midst of a bustling city. This was a great way to explore and pass the time in between our activities. If I lived in NYC, I'd totally pack a picnic lunch and enjoy it on the grass in the shade. Even though we were not planning to do so, we ended up walking through Central Park again the very next day. It was a drizzly, overcast Memorial Day, and we cut through Central Park to get to our next destination after visiting the American Museum of Natural History. It felt like we had the entire park to ourselves because hardly anyone was around! It was a stark contrast to the day before. There were tons of people on bicycles and walking their dogs the day before, but I guess the trick to visiting Central Park is to go on a rainy day to avoid crowds. Fortunately for us, it was only a light drizzle, so we didn't have to use our umbrella much through the park. But our second walk thru was even more enjoyable than the first, since the park was peaceful and quiet.",6,3,5

This park has pretty much everything, it's like a mini town inside of a big city. There is so much stuff to do but generally as a tourist, walking through it was more than enough.If I lived in the city I would come here to run all the time, there are so many trails! At the lake in the middle you can take a row boat out. Also, there's a bunch of rocks near the south point of the park that looked amazing for bouldering. I can go on and on about the things I would be doing but everyone needs to make a stroll here at least a few times in their life.Wish I lived in New York all year around so that I could witness all four seasons.",,,

Updated review","The Mall is the main drag in Central Park. Just like most sections there are beautiful trees lining the pathway. It's great to see in different seasons. This is another highly photographed section of the park. Lots of films feature the Mall. In summer people are on roller skates. You can hear live music and see various entertainment. It's a congested tourist spot. The best part to me is the knowledge that if I walk North I reach Bethesda Terrace. That's like the flame on top of a candle. The Angel of the Waters Fountain. That's what I call her anyway. My beautiful friend on the water. She must be Aquarius like me. So when you visit Central Park take a walk from Central Park South heading North. You will walk the Mall to the Angel. When you do, think of me! And smile. :-)",60,37,57

They filmed Home Alone and John Wick: Chapter 2 here so we had to visit. Plus Lady M is located inside The Plaza and Mink wanted to check them out for their matcha crepe cake. The entrance has a lot of food and drink vendors along with horses that have carriages strapped to them that you can ride on. Luckily we went on a beautiful day where the weather was cool but not hot. It allowed us to casually and comfortably walk 1/4 of the park. Make sure to bring comfortable walking shoes. Along the way, we saw performers, fountains, bridges, vendors, horses pulling carriages, animals, the lake and many people rowing boats on the lake.

There are numerous bike companies that let you rent a bike to take around Central Park and they also had horse and carriage rides. We opted to walk to our locations, but I'm thinking next time we will just rent a bike because it's a huge park with so much to see.

If you are visiting NYC for the first time, usually you get overwhelmed by the skyscraper view. Once you get to see the Central Park for the first time, all you see is a beautiful green sanctuary with various musical venues and museums. There are so many things to do here that it will take more than just a day or two to go through every corner of the Central Park.Tours: The Central Park Conservancy (a non-profit organization) currently offers 19 different guided tours (including both free & ticketed tours - you can register in advance on their website). You can also print or view self-guided tour information on the Central Park Conservancy's website.Hours: The Central Park closes from 1 AM to 6 AM.Venus: Too many to list, but some of featured attractions include Central Park Zoo, Strawberry Fields, Belvedere Castle, Great Lawn, Conservatory Garden, Bethesda Fountain, Minton Tile Ceiling at Bethesda Terrace, Balto, Alice in Wonderland, Obelisk, Shakespeare Garden, Mall and Literary Walk, Kerbs Boathouse, Chess & Checkers House, etc.This world renowned urban park is truly a thing of wonder and one of the best attractions NYC has to offer.

However the areas we did see had lots of different statues and of course it was green all over the place. Also there was so much seating all over the place and i can imagine it would make for a nice place to just sit and enjoy the views, read a book, or just relax. During this evening i did see a lot rats not sure if this is something that happens during the day, but just a heads up. There were also a few tours outside of Central Park that you can sign up for. Some were horse carriage rides  or bike rides. I would try to haggle the prices because they kept trying to bring down the price to convince us to do a bike ride. They started at $215 and brought it down to $90. I would live to visit Central Park during the day maybe next time.",1,,2

From anywhere in New Amsterdam, in fact. Now that I've schooled you, I'll admit that I just made that up. Which just shows you, you can't trust any Yelper these days.What I'm not making up, though, is that this is not only one of the most famous parks in the world, but also one of the most incredible. It covers a huge chunk of the upper half of Manhattan island. When you fly over NYC, what you notice is Central Park, nestled in between the high rises and skyscrapers, providing peace and fresh air and solace in the midst of the madness. It is flanked by the UWS and UES, two of the fanciest parts of the fanciest place in the world to live.There was a time when Central Park was a death trap at night, and it's still not completely safe to wander in alone after dark, but it's much more user-friendly these days, since the drug epidemics and Giuliani's gentrification.If it were Rental Park, NYC would have to pay a monthly rate just to have it. If it was Dental Park, you'd come here to get your teeth whitened. And if it were Mental Park, half the people walking through it would be psychotic. Oh wait, they are.

Originally, the Belvedere Castle wasn't on my list of places to check out at Central Park. It was more of a weird coincidence, and thank goodness for that. The castle itself is a wonder and the view from the top is magnificent! Walking around aimlessly can also be pleasurable. People watching and breathing the fresh air always makes me happy.

I picture them and the women in running shorts and nothing else where I lay my bare back against the grass on what I considered to be a warm New York day. My weak California blood flow couldn't keep me warm in Dubai, but any excuse for the park, I thought. Lauren's blonde head in the grass, her shoulders red. Her constant gladness and naivete; she began her work as a masseuse months before I even joined her in Brooklyn. That she wasn't innocently rubbing someone's back. That she'd expose herself from a white silk robe and her clients often showed up with gifts, many bouquets of spring-mix wilting in her loft. And how un-jealous I remained. How weird.I did however refrain from talking about her work. I preferred to gaze dumbly in her eyes in the grass of Central Park. Her eyes would slightly cross and she'd squint, sometimes without sunglasses. I'd catch her sneak peaks at the shirtless boys playing Frisbee, a melange of young Sheep's Meadow grazers, clandestine cans of beer nuzzled in the crooks of their elbows. How French impressionist. How grandiose and  serence compared to loud, small New York. A chihuahua city. Who needs the beach, I thought? Though being from LA, I always needed water and brine and Leine in the sun in the park, in the sand where we met...Leine in the sun was a dream. It wasn't in the Sheep's Meadow sun that I first heard Leine talk to herself. She said she was responding to voices. It was always at night when the lights went out and her thoughts contended with the quiet world. Sometimes, my thoughts would get loud too, and so I'd take to the park, walk the dirt paths to the Met and dwell on painting ideas. Landscape, landscape, landscape. Leine by the ponds. Leine with the ducks. I loved her a lot and worried about her well-being. I worried that what she did day to day would carry with her into old age. The pulling and tugging. All that loose skin hanging off of her. Her brain wilting like the spring mix bouquets.Long before Leine, how I got to Central Park, a young boy from Los Angeles visiting relatives swearing that I'd contend in the art scene and finally have a voice. It's funny about voices, they're only heard when people take the time to listen. And if one listens hard enough, one can hear a pin drop. Either from behind the door of a closet, or outside on a knoll in Central Park. Leine with watermelon juice from her chin in Sheep's Meadow and how I miss her. I wonder what's keeping her in Montreal. I wonder if she misses the one walk we took, her circular hippy sunglasses shielding her. She stuck her tongue out at me and probably regarded me a fixture in her life. An unwavering mass. Perhaps one of those boulders the children climb. Perhaps I still talk to her in her head on her pillow when the lights go out.",2,2,2

It is as beautiful as you can picture it with the bikers, joggers, green scenery, kids playing in the background, and woofers/puppers being walked. My friends and I ended up renting bikes and biking around the entire Central Park loop. It was such a beautiful day (late March) and not too chilly as the snowstorm had passed two weeks earlier. Be sure to stay in the middle lane when biking because there are always a few cars/police cars in the right lane. It took us a total of TWO HOURS to complete the loop.

Even though there was still snow on the ground (the majority of it was already cleared away so that you can can walk along some of the sidewalk paths), it did not stop visitors from walking around this park. Some with strollers, some with their 4 legged little friends (my cousin's kids begged me to dog sit our dog while we were visiting the museum so unfortunately she did not get the chance to walk around with us), some with families, etc. Being the literary nerd that I am, the top 2 things that I wanted to see at this park was the Hans Christian Anderson statue and the Alice in Wonderland Statue. Christian Anderson is famous for writing The Ugly Duckling & The Little Mermaid (but of course did write numerous of other stories and poems). At his statue, he is posed sitting on a bench with a book open to The Ugly Duckling. There is also a small duck that approaches him on his right side. Although I appreciate that no one was here when I took some photos, I was a little sad to see that no one was visiting this statue and that a lot more people were at the Alice in Wonderland Statue (also close by). But Hans Christian Anderson's statue is a little bit more hidden so it may now be nearly as noticeable. The Alice In Wonderland statue is big and plenty of kids and adults were climbing all over it taking photos and playing on it (be patience, you can get a person free photo as long as you are willing to wait). Some of your favorite characters are here in statue form that includes Alice, The Mad Hatter and the White Rabbit. I loved seeing some of the remaining colored leaves on the trees as we walked past them. Unfortunately we did not get to walk the entire park (I think that may take a whole day to do) but I love that this park has several statues and notable things to view. Also the lake is beautiful and l can just imagine what fun it would be for families during warmer months. I can also see numerous of photo ops around, which makes this park excellent for photo shoots, engagement photos and wedding photos.

Even my brief visit in a single corner of the park was fantastic and relaxing. The way I see it, you have two options with Central Park - plan a visit, or get lost during a visit! And believe me, the park is big enough that you COULD get lost in it; even if you don't want to plan your route to the last detail, looking at a map at some point wouldn't be the worst idea. No matter the reason or plans (or lack thereof) behind your venturing into Central Park, the skyline and seasonal foliage (or snow!) will provide a gorgeous backdrop for your day out and your walk in the park; or for a bike ride, or a boat trip, or a round of ice skating in the winter! It's home to thousands of species of flora, as well hundreds of birds and mammals. It's a fantastic community park, filled with everything from the beauty of nature to community events to children's corners and more.Because I wasn't here that long this past summer I don't really have any amazing insights in the park, but even my short visit was delightful.

Whatever your heart desires, you can find the time and space for it here, which is something many others take for granted with their access to parks elsewhere.  There are street vendors, selling artwork and knick-knacks/souvenirs, an ice skating rink, a place to rent row boats by the hourly, horse-carriage rides and plenty of places to find a seat, to just take in all that Central Park is.  Overall, it was a wonderful experience to be a part of such a famous and charming park, and highly recommend it if you're in New York City.",,,1

193,Save L.,"Plainview, NY",0,3,0,5.0,10/25/2018,Central Park is one of my favorite places to walk with my dogs and relax.  It's a cozy quiet place in the middle of a big city.   The turtle pond is my favorite.,,,
194,Jen L.,"Las Vegas, NV",82,73,177,5.0,4/14/2018,"We got lost in this park !! But it was a great experience.  It was nice and peaceful . You had people playing music, a little area with row boats people playing and having picnics. It was the New York feel I expected. :)",,1,
195,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,310,372,5.0,2/14/2017,"Central park - home to lots of cute chipmunks, home to my beloved penguins at the central park zoo, home to beautiful trees that blossoms in the spring time, home to beautiful fall colors during autumn - what is not to love about this place?This is one of my go to places during the warmer temperatures because I love wandering here. I feel that every single time I come, I discover something new and there's always something to take photos of (cause you know, amateur photographer needs practice). Sometimes, when I want to just sit and think, I'll come here and sit on top of a rock or one of the benches (usually benches because when kids are out of school, they tend to do silly teenage stuff such as launching rocks at pedestrians and then these people see me.../sweats - but also because of these incidents, be careful if you're near a rock and people are on it!!!!) My only gripe is since I'm direction-ally challenged, I usually get lost amongst the trees and despite the roads they have, I find myself walking around in circles (WHICH IS NOT HELPFUL DX)But it is a gorgeous place to take sunset photos. Or have a romantic walk with your significant other. Or catching up with your friends. Go go go ~ for long, relaxing walks. And don't forget your water bottle!",2,1,1
196,Kevin W.,"Temple City, CA",577,2019,9511,5.0,1/26/2017,"One of the most famous parks in the US and world. One of New York's more iconic sites. This park is huge! Easy to find and get to. The fountain in the middle is one of the most famous spots. Great place to have a picnic and relax and soak NYC!Amazing place to see the seasons change. Awesome when it is green, orange, brown. or full of snow. Surrounded by so many different other sites, shops, and food. Always busy and full of people but you can always find a hidden quite spot.",3,1,3
197,Tomomi S.,"Torrance, CA",42,141,41,5.0,4/24/2017,"We stopped by Central Park three times during our 6 day trip to NY. We were very lucky because the weather warmed up for that week and it didn't rain much at all. Of course, the park was packed with people but it was so peaceful and beautiful. Cherry blossoms started blooming, too. My 9 year old loved climbing all the boulders and trees at the park. The park is so big, you can only do different parts at a time. I had plans to go see so many things at Central Park but gave up because the place was just too big. My son wanted to try sailing the model boat at Conservatory Water, ever since he read the book Stewart Little.The model boat rental starts around early April, but it depends on the weather. Follow them on Instagram to get the latest info. The boat rental area and Le Pain Quotidien area was really crowded since it was a warm Tuesday afternoon, many kids on spring break. Despite that, we put our names down for the wait list. The people working there were very good about making sure to keep order. They told us 30 min wait but it was actually over an hour. We just sat close by and waited for them to call out my son's name. The model boat rental was $12 for 30 min. It took a little while for my son to get the hang of controlling the sail boat. But he really enjoyed it. The bathroom there had a REALLY long queue. In general, Central Park just lacks bathrooms. I don't know how people with very young children do it living here. We also wanted to do a row boat rental, but the queue went around the restaurant, so we gave up. The queue for the bathroom there also snaked around the restaurant. It was crazy. Despite that, Central Park is definitely a must during your NY trip. Bring a picnic, make sure to empty your bladder before you go, enjoy the beautiful park and have fun!",,,
198,Peter B.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",0,3,0,1.0,9/1/2018,"Horse & Carriage Ride - Had to cancel my reservation due to family member's surgery. Despite providing written notice 31 days prior to our scheduled reservation it has been a struggle to have them refund my money. NOTE: The cancellation policy states a full refund will be provided with 24 hours notice.My emails to a gentleman by the first name of Tarkan went unanswered. Finally, a week later after reaching him via phone, he tells me he requires a text message before he could process my refund...another 2 weeks go by and no refund so I texted him again. He stated the refund was being processed and that I needed to give it some more time. He said his accountant was to blame!! A week after that my patience had run out so I threatened legal action. Within minutes, I had an official notice from a woman named Cyra along with a wise guy response & no apology offered that my refund was finally being processed. Bottom line...I still do NOT have my refund yet but am hoping for the best. BEWARE the Horse & Carriage rides in Central Park. A bunch of illiterate dopes are running this operation!!",,,
199,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,5.0,7/7/2017,"One of the best things about living in Manhattan is waking up to run around Central Park. I've now seen it in all seasons, and I'm constantly awed by its beauty, whether it's around the entire park or the reservoir. I am also impressed by how quickly park services shovel the snow after a snowstorm! It's usually gone in about a day.",5,3,7
