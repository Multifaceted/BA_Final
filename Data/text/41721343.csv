0,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,5.0,8/24/2018,"With rising costs of living and renting or owning property not only in the Lower East Side, but in NYC in general, I'm glad that nostalgic places like Classic Coffee Shop still exist. Walking into here is exactly like walking into a time portal going back 30, 40, 50 years. There are old school signages, bar stools, radios and photographs all around the store. This coffee shop is supposedly second generation owned and the man who spearheads the store nowadays went to school directly across the street at P.S.42.  There is nothing fancy about the menu and what is offered here. Nothing overly complicated and hipster. Just what kids would typically want to eat as a quick snack before or after school at extremely inexpensive prices. I'm a big fan of the ham and egg on a bialy here. Aside from that, cold cuts, snacks, cheese sandwiches and old school beverages such as the Lower East Side classic egg cream are also offered here. I tried my very first egg cream at this spot now that I think about it. Overall, I'd highly recommend giving this place a shot if you're ever in the neighborhood and looking for a quick snack. Everything in this venue has a very homey atmosphere. Everything from the 2 tables and chairs to the pan used to fry up your egg that is not much bigger than the size of your palm. The man running the shop is a extremely cool guy and won't hesitate to strike up a friendly conversation with you. I truly hope this Lower East Side staple stays open for another 50 years!",1,,1
1,Hannah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,31,19,5.0,7/29/2018,"Walked passed this place a number of times while wandering around Chinatown and finally decided to stop in and try it out. What lured me in was the sign exclaiming they made good, old-fashioned egg creams, and admittedly I'm a sucker for a good egg cream.The place itself is small, with 2 or 3 tables for seating, some counter stools, and that's about it. The decor is nothing fancy and the place lives up to it's name: classic. To put it simply, this is a no-frills place that's won my heart over. The vanilla egg cream I got was perfect, a good size for what I paid for, done right. I also snagged a brownie for $1 just to give that a try as well. Both items were tasty and I'll definitely be back on a more regular basis. Stop by this place while you still can, I'm honestly afraid it's going to be gone before I can even finish typing the word hyper-gentrification...",,,
2,Retro Richie G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/17/2018,"The name speaks for itself: Classic!!1.The prices are good, & my aunt Judy, used to come here since the early 80`s. 2. I like the decor this is a real, retro, coffee shop, that`s been here for 42 years.   3. I call this Classic Coffee Shop, a Time Machine, you'll feel like you time traveled to the 1950's.4. Coffee, & food is tasty, the owner Carmine is a nice person to talk to, & his son Mike is into the same music as me. I highly recommend this place!! :) Note: There's not too many places like this, left in NYC.",2,2,
3,Alan N.,"New York, NY",284,229,801,5.0,6/17/2018,"This one is another staple of the lower east side. No frills, just simple breakfast sandwich and coffee. As a kid I would remember how amazing the bagel with butter or bagel with cream cheese were. The brownie is also absolutely delicious. The original owner doesn't seem to make too many appearances there anymore, but his son? has taken over. My friend and I stopped by today and it definitely has the same feeling. Although the food seems to be a bit different from what we remembered as kids, it was still a great nostalgic visit. $2 for a bagel with cream cheese! Make sure to get the bagel toasted to let the butter and cream cheese melt alitte!",3,1,
4,Alexa B.,"New York, NY",164,100,191,5.0,1/27/2018,"This place deserves six stars because it's finally a no frills just good old coffee and food place. Many coffee I have encountered recently serve this organic coffee that literally tastes like cigarettes and I'm sick of it!!!I begin to ask myself ""what happened to the mom and pop shop that serves coffee out of the pot and none of those fancy machines??"" Classic Coffee shop answered this question for me. The space is small but it's made for a quick bite and coffee. Prices are extremely inexpensive, I got two coffees and a brownie for 4 bucks. Everyone try the brownie! No nuts, no fudge just a yummy and gooey brownie for $1. This delicious dessert melts in your mouth and pairs perfectly with their delicious coffee. No joke I think this is one of the best cups of coffee I have had in NYC. The staff is so nice too. The man who was working there engaged in conversation with my boyfriend and I. He really seemed to enjoy talking to people and didn't rush us out which I loved!!! Now that I know this place is here I will DEFINITELY be back!! I highly recommend for great no frills coffee and desserts at an insanely fair price!",,,

Updated review","Super friendly service from Michael today. He can make a pretty mean tuna fish on rye. Also a good conversationalist, like his pops.Btw, just discovered there is a bathroom in the back. You wouldn't think it because of the size of the place, but it's there and also decorated with lots of pictures, so it's worth a visit even just to wash your hands.",1,,2
6,Amanda D.,"New York, NY",64,29,1,5.0,9/6/2018,"Old fashioned, walking in here is taking a trip into American history--it's just a great vibe and the owner is an open book--they have been open for 42 years, cheers to that, price was right food was yummy especially the EGG CREAM!",,1,
7,Shiu Lei W.,"New York, NY",12,198,1168,5.0,6/13/2018,"Me and sis was walking around the area where we used to go to elementary school. Saw the classic coffee shop and decided to get a light bite. We looked at the menu and decided on a egg with cheese bagel and the popular egg cream. The classic coffee shop is know for their egg cream which is like almost 100 years old. It's made from milk and seltzer. The owner is very friendly and took his time making the bagel and egg cream. The cafe was opened by the owners dad. The dad went to the elementary across the street ps 42. So cool that a student from that elementary school opened this cafe. This cafe is very old school and with old school radios, posters, fridge, counters and chairs. The bagel was made to perfection. Me and sis shared half of the bagel. After leaving the cafe me and sis wanted to order another bagel because it was so delicious. It's made so good that makes us want to go back for more. Best to go on weekends when it's quite and not crowded. When school is in session it can be quite crowded. Since I went on the weekend and me and sis were the only customer. The owner really took his time making the bagel to perfection. Definitely going back for more of the delicious bagels. You don't get to see much of these old school cafes in the city.",,,
8,Helen L.,"New York, NY",129,131,36,5.0,3/14/2018,"Old school mom and pop coffee shops like this are amazing. Food and coffee here is very fairly priced and as other reviewers mentioned, no frills.The decor of the shop is incredible and makes me feel like I've time traveled every time I come here. Great place to grab coffee and catch up with friends.",1,,
9,Heidi V.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,41,102,4.0,12/18/2017,"It is exactly what the name of this place describes it to be: classic coffee shop. You have your typical coffee and breakfast sandwiches. There are bagels, bialys, rolls, toast, and desserts. This is your no-frills, old diner style cafe, with amazing service. The owner is really friendly and has a lot of love for what he does, I can tell. I overheard him talking to a tourist about how it has been a family business for over 40 years! What impressed me the most were the wall decorations, which consists of old pictures of the shop and its owners. The prices are really good for a place on the LES, portions are huge.",2,,
10,Maya F.,"Columbus, OH",22,94,88,5.0,4/19/2018,Nice cafe so small place but so good coffee too. They make good sandwiches too. The space is so little. But in general is good cafe. The owner is so nice and friendly.,1,1,2
11,Tom L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,1,5.0,7/9/2018,Best breakfast sandwiches in New York City!!! I love this place. Beloved neighborhood spot,,,
12,Gui Bin Z.,"New York, NY",60,278,8,5.0,3/23/2016,"This coffee shop has been in the neighborhood for as long as I can remember. I used to order bagels here as a kid going to elementary school across the street. It has been a few years since I stopped by but this week I decided to bring my friend who was visiting out of town to show her a little piece of my history.Now as an adult I love to put cream cheese, jelly, and butter on my plain bagel (you might think this is a crazy combo but try it. It's a heart attack in a bagel but your mouth will thank me.)  I grew up ordered a toasted butter bagel so I had to order just that. The bagel was exactly how I remembered it.I felt like I was transformed back to a time I had long forgotten. The shop owner who is no longer the giant I remembered him to be, completed the moment for me. I wish this was on my way to work every morning.The decor has not changed much and he's preserved everything. Make sure to stop by if you are in the neighborhood.",5,4,4
13,Jasmine A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",130,8,4,5.0,7/9/2017,"Coming here finally gave me a true LES experience, and the name perfectly depicts what it's like to have a classic cup of coffee and homemade delicious brownie made by the owner himself! I really enjoy looking at antiques so the knick knacks of memorabilia he has around the shop are such a nice touch! You feel completely welcomed & everything is made as if you had it at home if you know what I mean. Most authentic (probably only) coffee shop in the neighborhood!",2,1,1
14,Mee Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,11/27/2017,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Nothing short of a total classic coffee shop!!! Everything - the fabulous food, ambience, service, decor, music, location... everything. One of my favorite coffee shops, ever anywhere.",,,
15,christina h.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,21,0,5.0,6/24/2017,"I'm in NYC for the month and this spot is my go to breakfast place every day. Family owned, no frills, and in business for 41 years, truly a neighborhood gem.",2,,1
16,Brian K.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,1,0,5.0,4/17/2018,Throwback to anther era. One of the last bastions of the old LES. Delicious egg sandwiches.  Perfect for a quick casual breakfast.,,,
17,Dong D.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",1,28,0,5.0,2/25/2018,I came here after 20 years and nothing has changed. I used to come here as a kid where the elementary school across the street would let us out to play during lunch and I would always get a butter bagel . This is a gem. The food and options are very simple but good.,,,
18,R G.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,1,0,5.0,3/14/2018,One of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. The place is charming and cozy. Really a comfortable spot to just sit and wind down. Service was great too. I will definitely pay another visit the next time I'm in the area.,,,
19,Alicia S.,"Whittier, CA",1,15,15,5.0,7/17/2017,"Great cheap egg creams! 2.00$ for a big one! And it was GOOD! Michael, the son of the owner made it perfectly, and he was so nice and friendly.  They actually make the food right in front of you, taking the eggs out of the fridge when you ask for a turkey and egg sandwich! Cash only, so make sure you have that with you because it's worth it:)",,,
20,Luke S.,"New York, NY",85,16,8,4.0,1/30/2016,"Come in for the old school NYC no bullshit atmosphere, the Folgers coffee, the simple quick egg breakfast",1,1,1
21,Jim W.,"Montgomery, NJ",0,3,10,5.0,4/22/2016,"I spent the recent week roaming the Lower East of NYC with my camera and watching Tribeca Films in between. Early in the week I fortunately discovered the  Classic Coffee Shop at 56 Hester Street just a couple blocks from my hotel. It has typical Lower East Side ambiance and charm while serving great tasting coffee and sandwiches at very reasonable prices. Inside the place is cozy and clean with lots of interesting pictures on the walls. The owner has been there for over 40 years and is interesting to chat with. The shop has an outside serving window facing north and when the morning sun shines down Hester Street the light and shadows are beautiful. The owner said it's his ""window to the world"" and he has all kinds of stories about what he has observed over the years. I highly recommend giving it a ""try"". It is now my favorite coffee shop in the area.",,,
22,Rob S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,264,92,5.0,8/30/2015,"Wow, talk about a find!!!!!  The name really does say it all.  There are not many places left like this in New York my friends.  So rare that I was completely dumbfounded.  The owner is a really, really great guy and he makes a great grilled cheese.  My other had an egg salad sandwich which was great and fresh, something that is hard to find in NYC.  Most places have egg salad that comes out of a 5 gallon bucket.  Yuck.  Most importantly though - great coffee and I had my first egg cream here!  Places like this have so much more to offer than the giganto-corporate places.  I wish I lived closer, I would certainly be a regular.  You could eat lunch here for 7.00$  Try and find that in NYC.  Cash only as it should be.",1,,
23,Susan N.,"Houston, TX",6,5,3,5.0,8/17/2015,"I stumbled across this place by accident. And I'm glad. It's a simple menu, with tasty sandwiches. The music playing great classics and the guy who I'm guessing is the owner has a great personality. The only down side that it is cash only. If I'm near here again I'll be back.",1,,
24,Davide Q.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,6,5.0,11/18/2014,"One of the greatest parts of my new york experience has been this coffee shop. Great begals, bialys and egg creams.A lot of the regulars know each and everyones opinion is welcome when conversation breaks out. Which it regularly does!I moved pretty far away but still make it a point to dropin whenever I'm in the area. Stop by and say hi to Carmine!",,,
25,Jamie M.,"Wilmington, NC",143,4,0,5.0,12/14/2016,I was looking for a breakfast sandwich. I found a time machine to the 1970s. And the ham egg and cheese roll was good too.,,,
26,Ali K.,"Queens, NY",0,2,0,5.0,5/1/2015,"Stumbled across this gem after a longass bus ride from Chicago a few months ago. Great coffee and bagels but what really makes this place special is the ambience. Nothing fancy, if that's what you have in mind but suffused with a sense of history. The owner has been running this place for decades and I had a great chat with him about the city. Also, quite possibly the best music selection I've heard playing in any establishment in New York.",1,,
27,Henry C.,"New York, NY",20,101,0,5.0,11/27/2013,"Classic Coffee Shop, the name says it all. I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.Like most people, I frequented this place when I went to school at PS 42. This was back in the late 90s and early 2000s (wow that makes me feel old), but the place hasn't changed much. The menu is still small, and the quality of the food is still the same. I've always contended that this place has the best toasted buttered bagel I've ever had. The owner runs this place by himself, and does it quickly and efficiently even during the rush of kids.The atmosphere is great, really makes you feel like you're not in a bustling modern city, but rather the bygone days of yesteryear.",,,
28,Ruchi D.,"Southbury, CT",0,22,0,5.0,6/20/2016,"My new go-to. Super affordable no-nonsense breakfast food  that tastes good, and the owner is so nice! They don't have a tip jar, but every time I go I feel like tipping because the dude deserves it for how cool he is.",,,
29,Crystal S.,"Cary, NC",77,18,39,5.0,12/4/2014,"After a 90 minute cab ride from JFK to my nearby hotel I needed a place to hang out while waiting for my room. I turned to Yelp and found this little gem. Carmine was behind the bar when I walked in and 3 regulars were eating lunch. I had a delicious hot cup of coffee and ordered an egg and cheese bagel, it really hit the spot. What a great little local hang out. The place literally only seats 8, 4 barstools and 2 small tables. Carmine, the owner, said he has been there almost 39 years now and grew up in the neighborhood. Most of the people who came and went while I was there he knew by name. I'm happy I had a chance to enjoy this rare little find. Great atmosphere and even better company. Definitely check it out!",1,,1
30,Luna L.,"New York, NY",3,157,1,5.0,1/27/2014,"The owner Carmine is a friendly man who has kept this place open for over 21 years. This place is like a time capsule. Carmine has pictures of his family on the wall, Rocky Marciano and a picture of himself on the cover of Rolling Stones. He also has pictures of PS 42 when he was a child and old pictures of the neighborhood. There is one small table and stools. He cooks everything himself. Menu is rather small but everything he makes taste good and I seriously mean it. He makes the best buttered bagel and egg sandwich. He also makes cream soda. Very retro and a delightful place in this neighborhood that has clearly gentrified. I hope he continues to keep this place open and/or his children take on his legacy (This place is legendary in this neighborhood).",2,,1
31,Rena J.,"New York, NY",121,84,0,5.0,4/4/2012,"I love this charming coffee shop on Hester Street. It's been in the neighborhood for three decades and stopping in here is like going back in time. The walls are covered with old pictures and the coffee is cheap - $1.00 for a small cup and $1.50 for a large. It's not the most mind-blowing cup of coffee I've ever had, but hey, coffee is coffee.If you just want an old-fashioned cup of joe in the Lower East Side, look no further. At least on weekdays - sadly, it's closed on weekends.",1,,1
32,Daved W.,"Marana, AZ",190,8,4,5.0,12/16/2013,Carmine has been making these delicious and inexpensive sandwiches for decades. Come here and order anything and ask him about the comic books he used to buy here as a kid.,1,,
33,Morgan W.,Sweden,5,16,0,5.0,1/5/2010,"I absolutely love this place. It's tiny but very homey.The guy has had it for 34 (!) years, which is truly amazing. He can tell you stories about the neighbourhood if you wish. He only got some simple sandwiches and soda, except coffee of course, but everything he makes is delicious and cheap. The coffee is 1 dollar, and so is all soda cans. But the best part thoug: The Egg Cream. Dang that's good..I love bringing a book and just sit in this tiny place for hours. Have a snack, watch all the people pass by, and just enjoy Lower East Side-living!Go for it, I know you want to! :)",5,2,3
34,Nicole L.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,1/24/2015,"the previous reviewers are correct when they say this place has the best bagel with butter! I want to come back all the time! I miss it when it's closed on the weekends. the man who runs the shop is incredibly kind and personable. He has the ability to connect with people of all ages, even the little kids who come in after school. and it's a really special vibe in that place.. it's comforting to be in an ever changing city with at least some places of stability like this Classic Coffee Shop.",,,
35,Lily T.,"New York, NY",44,40,11,5.0,7/16/2013,"This place is a classic. I've been coming here since I was in elementary school and the owner still makes the the same things on the small menu. The place is very small, a few chairs but it's very homey. Everything is delicious, my favorite is the turkey and egg on toast and the homemade brownies. I think I ate the same thing for 6 years while I was gong to school, right across the street from this place. Stop by, if you're in the neighborhood.",1,1,1
36,johnny p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/23/2011,"This place is everything it claims to be. Which makes it truly great. In addition to what the other reviewers said, Carmine (the owner) plays the best music of any establishment in New York, in my opinion. Yes, everything is simple, cheap, and NO NONSENSE in the truest sense. But everything is done with care and class, which makes the difference between this and a bodega or diner. He makes a wonderful little tuna sandwich. The egg sandwiches are perfect. The coffee does the job.",1,,1
37,Jerome Espinosa B.,"Manhattan, NY",231,662,196,3.0,5/20/2009,"My friends & I were looking for some spaces to rent for a business idea we got in mind, when we chanced upon this cute looking coffee shop. Inside you'd see memorabilia pieces including old pictures, mugs, collectibles of various kinds of bygone eras. it even has a picture showing how ""Hester"" street looked like during late 19th century in this part of the lower east side, that depicted buildings looking like the slums. it seems to me that it's  a one-man operation. i ordered for iced coffee which was OK.  i noticed the diversity of customers this shop had: latinos, asians, european-looking fellows...pretty interesting, hmmmm....",3,,
