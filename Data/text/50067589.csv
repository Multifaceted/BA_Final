0,Jocelyn D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,15,37,4.0,9/17/2018,"Woke up Sunday morning craving an acai bowl, and decided to try this spot since it was close by. The ambiance: 10/10 - Super cute place! Very clean! Fun music playing.The service: 9/10 - We didn't require much attention, but they were attentive. There was a store meeting going on, and only one girl taking orders and making food. She crushed it though! The acai bowl:  8/10 - Pros: There are great toppings included with the bowl (strawberries, banana, pineapple, toasted coconut, and chocolate nibs)! The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious!  Cons: The actual acai base was too frozen. It need some more juice/liquid added to it. It only filled about half of the bowl that it came in, so I felt like I was getting jipped. Overall good experience.",,,
1,Sam M.,"Amityville, NY",5,72,103,3.0,9/19/2018,"I was hankering for a cup of coffee while roaming the city and stumbled upon this little business. I think they are more aimed for tea drinkers than coffee especially when taking into account their name.  I was greeted by a very happy and friendly man who stated he was excited to help us because he loves his job so much. I ordered a cup of hot coffee and was told it would be about 4 minutes because they make it in a French press. Totally did not mind waiting.  When it was done, he brought it over to where I was sitting and did not rush me to pay; he simply said to let him know when I was ready. I had to wait a while before I could drink it at a reasonable temperature.  I was not a fan of the actual flavor or blend of coffee.  It was strange tasting to say the least.  I am giving 3 stars because of how clean the space is and the customer service and the salad bar in the back.  But aside from those two factors, I would not stop in here for coffee.",1,,
2,Gerry S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",192,13,5,5.0,8/30/2018,"Seeing as we live right across the street, and this is a brand new place, we felt like we had to try it! They've got some great choices, all healthy and fresh. Friendly staff. The back of the place is where you order your food and the front offers cold pressed refrigerated juices as well as drinks you can make to order. We tried the steakhouse with bibb lettuce, and the South Pacific with chopped lettuce. As for the drinks we got the cold pressed ginger detox and apple beet juice. The steakhouse with Bibb lettuce was a definite favorite for us. I really enjoyed the beet juice. This is a nice welcome addition to the neighborhood. A great place to get something quick, fresh, and healthy. Will definitely be coming back.",,,

I got the create your own salad, I got the gluten free quinoa, roasted citrus and herb chicken, red peppers, hummus (never had hummus in a salad before but it was amazing) and the caramelized onion dressing. Love love LOVED IT!!!!!!",,,
4,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,3.0,3/6/2018,"I wonder how much of Local Leaf's customer base comes from their neighbor Ruby's ridiculously long wait. On a Sunday morning, we weren't feeling waiting an hour for avocado toast, so we decided to try out Local Leaf next door.It's a small shop with the standard ""local"" corporate look. Somewhat confusingly, you order drinks up front and food at the back. Snag a seat before if you can as it was fairly crowded at 11 am.They offer a separate brunch menu on weekends, so I went for a breakfast burrito with sweet potato, avocado, and black beans, with seitan subbed in for pork ($9ish). My boyfriend did the avocado toast with fried egg ($8ish). They came out in about 10 minutes.I simply didn't enjoy my burrito. It was cold in the center, and though some of the components were good, most of it was mashed into an unpleasantly sweet tasting paste. I was nourished by it but I found it difficult to finish. The side hot sauce also tasted more like salad dressing.The avocado toast was good, and everything looked fresh, so maybe just a case of bad ordering on my part. Service was quick and the place was clean. I would come back for a salad if I was in the area.",3,2,2
5,Natalie F.,"New York, NY",180,99,108,5.0,3/1/2018,Ive been here twice and I have to say I am totally in love. Everything tastes so amazing and fresh and the salads aren't even overpriced! I've easily paid $15 for a horrible salad. So glad I found this place. The chicken is seasoned so good & the pesto sauce is bombbbb. Even the bowls that the salads come in are so cute. The staff is also really nice and recommend great things! So happy they're close to my job,,,
6,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,4.0,1/27/2018,"Local leaf is a low key ""Chipotle-style"" health joint. They serve bowls or lettuce wraps of gains, hummuses, and other local/seasonal vegetables; they also have various proteins. They also serve açai bowls. Local leaf is a great place to drop by and pick up a quick and healthy meal. Would definitely come back for some quick health foods.The venue is modern and can sit ~20.Ordered:Murray Hill - the soy bean hummus was interesting, and the pesto dressing was great",,1,
7,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,171,469,5.0,11/6/2017,"Decent spot for a quick healthy meal. Well lit area, the entrance area had coffee and drinks and the back had the salad and meals. I did the make your own meal, turned out to be fairly cheap ($11). Did a salad base with quinoa, three toppings, and pork on top. All the food seemed fresh, and was very tasty. The cooked broccoli was especially good, and the pork was tasty and not dry like some places get. Topped it with caramalized onion dressing which was surprisingly delicious. Comfortable quiet seating area perfect for eating quickly or for some chit chat. The only con was the workers were not exactly the most friendly, it was clearly my first time here and they did not really explain what I could get. They would just look at me expectantly and I had to look from them to the sign up top to know I could get three toppings, etc. Also there are no signs for the foods, so I had to ask what some of the things were and they seemed a little annoyed. Nevertheless I didn't come here for restaurant waitress service, we came for a quick healthy and delicious meal which is exactly what we got.",2,,1
8,Emma C.,"Wall Township, NJ",144,1,2,1.0,8/22/2018,"Got about 3 bites worth of an acai bowl. For what it's worth, it was actually really good, just way, way smaller than it should've been. I reached out on instagram, and they said they'd give my email to the owners and they'd reach out. Now they won't respond to me, even though my DMS are marked seen. Might dispute with my bank, because there's no way this was worth the $16 I paid to have it delivered :/ hate to do this to a small business but they need better customer service !!",1,,
9,Lindsey R.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",159,234,555,5.0,3/6/2018,"So happy to stumble upon this gem today! Delicious, fresh ingredients and so much to choose from.

10,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64808,5.0,8/14/2017,"Another trendy new healthy spot, this time in an area that definitely needed one of these places. For a place with a focus on serving things in lettuce cups and wraps, this stuff is pretty tasty and leaves you feeling less guilty than eating say a sandwich or a regular wrap.They just opened early today for breakfast, where you can get breakfast crepes and plenty of drinks, like juices and cold brew. For lunch or dinner, they also have heartier options like bowls with several different kinds of proteins. Conveniently located near the Midtown Tunnel if you are traveling to or from the city, this is a great spot to grab something on the go or to get a good cup of coffee.",16,3,9
11,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,4.0,2/3/2018,"I usually walk by this place on my way to/from work. I finally tried their bowls and so so good.Their toppings option are tasty and fresh. I just wish they had more protein options.Their staff is super friendly and attentive.The only drawback is their prices, a bowl is at least $10 depending on what you get.For someone who is trying to save money this is the type of place I would go to 1-3 times a month.",2,2,2

There was no roasted brussel sprouts at the time, which I really wanted and he offered me a 4th topping for no additional cost!

And its all locally sourced foods. Yum",1,,

14,Sushma K.,"Manhattan, NY",556,23,19,5.0,8/21/2018,"I didnt have many expectations when coming into this place, but once I tried the food I was hooked! The baked sweet potato falafel is amazing!!! Its healthy and the food portions are great.",,,
15,Agustin K.,"New York, NY",737,1018,446,4.0,12/8/2017,"Ordered via Meal Pal.  The menu of the day was sweet potato falafel over quinoa rice with pesto sauce.My bowl was ready when I arrived - and it looks relatively fresh.  Other MealPal I've had I think was made way earlier.  My falafel was still warm when I picked it up.  It was nice and crispy.The pesto sauce was sooo good and goes really well with the pickled carrots and hummus.  Very fresh ingredients.  Although it doesn't seem like a lot of food, it was quite filling.  Local leaf will certainly be in my Meal Pal rotation.",4,2,2
16,Daniel Z.,"Manhattan, NY",173,317,1584,4.0,2/7/2018,"Local Leaf is wonderful! I'm always in searching for healthy options near work so I tried Local Leaf today, and got Soho Bowl. I love it, but felt somehow it's a strange combination, because it has seitan (which is a type of mock meat made with wheat gluten) on a gluten free grain base (of brown rice, quinoa and millet). I'm not gluten free so it's perfect for me, but I imagine people who choose a gluten free grains base, would probably want the entire meal to be gluten free as well. I really enjoyed my food, but I would love to see more vegan protein toppings.",,,1
17,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1404,1149,1019,3.0,11/23/2017,"Checked out the Local Leaf yesterday on my lunch break. I   used the Yelp app to search for ""healthy food"" in my work area and this place popped up and being that it was a short walk I   headed over for lunch arriving at 2:29 pm on a Wednesday. This Wednesday then happened to close at 3pm so I   wanted to make sure I   got there with sufficient time left  before closing so I    didn't annoy any of the employees. Being that I   worked in the restaurant business forever, I   know what it's like having someone walk in right before closing time. However, being that this is an ""assembly line"" nature I   thought I   could pop in, grab something quick and be on my way. When I   walked into the place, there was a bar like counter top with what I   thought were beer taps until I   got closer and realized they were kombucha taps, amazing. They had some flourless chocolate brownies in a little basket in front. The place was pretty inside with a black painted exposed brick wall and cool hanging lights. I   headed to the back of the place where I   saw what looked like the place to order food, it was slightly confusing for a minute where I    placed my order. When I   got back there everything was wrapped up in plastic already as if they were already closed for the day. I   felt bad about ordering but then reminded myself it was only 2:30 and there were other tables eating in the dining area so I   figured ordering a quick bowl would have been okay. I   thought they had quinoa on their menu because I   had seen that option online and also peeked at others photos' on Yelp and saw quinoa so I   was confused when I    didn't see any displayed. I   went with a bowl and asked for brown rice and then asked for quinoa. The woman working told me the quinoa was in the brown rice already but I    didn't see any nor did I   see any when it was in my bowl. I   added their roasted vegetables, which consisted of brussels sprouts, sweet potato and beets, I   did tomato, cucumber chick pea hummus and chicken also. The woman wasn't thrilled about having to unwrap the already wrapped bins so I   felt a little awkward and tried to get minimal toppings. I   asked her about the broccoli slaw and creamy broccoli. I   was curious about whether or not there was dairy in the creamy broccoli and she didn't know, so I   skipped that although it sounded interesting. She asked me what kind of dressing I   wanted and there were lots to choose from, all sounded really delicious and they were all gluten free and nut free. I   went with a lime vinaigrette and it was pretty tasty. I    wanted to sit and eat so I   asked the girl assisting me whether they were going to close early if the place emptied out or if they will stay open til 3 regardless and she reiterated that they are closing AT 3. Got it! I   grabbed some napkins and had a seat, scarfed down my food because I   did not want to be there anywhere close to 3. I   think the bowl came to $10 and change and it was super super filling. The chick pea hummus was very tasty, roasted vegetables were good and the quinoa-less brown rice was actually really good. Some places don't know how to do rice and it ends up coming out very dry, this wasn't dry at all. Their chicken tasted like bumble bee tuna though, it was strange. It wasn't bad, it just didn't taste like chicken, it tasted like canned tuna. Good thing I   like canned tuna. I   was a little turned off when two customers walked in at 2:40 and the first thing an employee said to them was ""We close at 3 today!!!"" I   get it, I'm just saying, a hello would have been cool. Also, there's something about watching the last bite of chicken being scraped out of a container with all the juices at the bottom being grabbed up into your salad bowl. Once you're down to your last serving of something I   think it just looks better to the customer if you get a fresh container so it doesn't look like you're being given the last scraps. I   would definitely come back and try another combination from here. The staff was friendly don't get me wrong, they just wanted out at 3 and it was a little too evident to the customer is all.",5,2,1
18,Marissa F.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",283,2,0,2.0,7/9/2018,"I really wanted to like this place, so I'm really sad to just leave 3 stars. The food was just very, very bland. Sweet potato falafel was actually just a ball of baked sweet potato, nothing else. Hummus had no flavor. Parsley pesto just tasted like watered down parsley... really hoping they add some flavor to the food because I'd love to come back and have my mind changed. And after eating and posting this, I just saw another review say the ""baked"" sweet potato falafel is actually fried. I can't eat fried foods and now even more disappointed.",,,
19,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,11/16/2017,"Local Leaf is another grain and/or lettuce quick-serve bowl spots, which also uniquely offers lettuce wrap sandwiches.  Their main focus, as the name suggests, is on local and seasonal ingredients.  My company has occasionally ordered lunch from them, establishing a large buffet of components and allowing us to craft the meal to our liking.  On the most recent order, I built a bowl using Gluten-Free Quinoa, Herbed Farro and Bulgur Wheat blend, Roasted Chicken with Citrus and Herbs, Baked Sweet Potato Falafel, Broccoli Couscous, and more.  Their Baked Sweet Potato Falafel was really the star here, as it was so unusual!  The balls were huge and more like meatballs than falafel.  Chickpeas were still used and could be found whole in the mixture, but the addition of the potato added a honeyed flavor without masking the abundance of spices still included.  In addition, their Maple-Mustard Vinaigrette made the perfect dressing with its tart sweetness.  While I would not particularly call Local Leaf unique, it was certainly enjoyable.",3,,3
20,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,3.0,11/1/2017,"If you're looking for a healthy option that is fast and reasonably priced then come here.  Otherwise, it was forgettable and could be skipped.WAIT: Came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and there was no wait.ATMOSPHERE: The inside is pretty small with only a few tables but for a group of 8 of us, they were nice enough to put tables together.  When you first walk in, there's a bar/drink area probably for people who want juices or coffee etc. and then there is the back area where you order your food chipotle style.  I'm assuming the people who were working there were new and couldn't quite handle a large group of us coming in at once because they didn't know how to make the pre-set options.FOOD: I decided to make my own bowl, where you can choose what base you want (rice, grains mix etc.), salad, 3 toppings and meat.  Their toppings are OK - nothing really stood out to me and the better ones are probably premium.  You also get to choose a sauce at the end.  Overall, the flavors were just OK, nothing special and in the end I wasn't completely satisfied.  My husband got the west coast bowl and beware that it comes with vegan meat, he didn't realize this so he asked to have it switched to regular pork (they switched it out for free) but even then it was lacking in flavor.  He didn't even finish his bowl.  This reminds me of places where you customize your meal but the flavors just aren't there.  I'd much rather go to Dig Inn or Sweetgreen.If you check in you get a free dessert, I opted for the flourless brownie which was good.Overall, nothing special and nothing worth raving about, it was just A-OK.",6,2,2
21,Alexandra M.,"New York, NY",259,45,54,5.0,6/7/2018,CATERING review. Delivery guys were great. They set the lunch for 50 people up from start to finish. Aesthetic of the food presentation was nice. Food is a good healthy option for lunch. Would order again,,,2
22,Janvi P.,"New York, NY",189,31,15,3.0,4/30/2018,"To be honest, Im not sure why this place has such fantastic reviews.  Food is average; nothing special.What was extremely disappointing is their inappropriate wording on the menu.  I have been here twice now - the first time I got the BAKED sweet potato falafel (since I wanted a healthy salad); they were decent but nothing amazing.  During my second visit, I asked if they had any and the staff responds I can FRY some for you.  I asked her what she meant by fried when it says baked - she responds they are baked first and then fried.To specifically call something baked leads customers to believe that its not fried.  I do not appreciate a 'healthy' restaurant masking their menu items.Also they charge extra for for many of their salad add ins.Overall I would go here if i HAD to, but definitely wont be frequenting this place.",2,,
23,I Said No Pickle S.,"Chicago, IL",402,14,5,1.0,4/22/2018,"Textbook example of operational bottle neck. Took 25 minutes for a banana to be peeled and sliced. Glaciers have moved faster. Claims produce is locally sourced, but honestly think they are sending someone to walk to a farm 80 miles away every time they go into the kitchen to get more berries. Came close to volunteering to make the açaí bowl myself. Felt like I went on an emotional rollercoaster through the seven circles of hell and back while waiting for this bowl. Wasn't worth the price or the 2 years this experience took off of my life. Felt I should pay it forward and told a customer to get out while you can as I was exiting. Highly recommend going if you have 9 hours to kill!",,5,

25,Sofia N.,"Yonkers, NY",317,9,1,3.0,5/19/2018,"I really am rooting for this place the food is good quality but there are some small tweaks that I really hope the management takes seriously that could make this place really a place to hang.First off the kambucha on tap for $6 is a waist. They should just have the bottles from the companies on tap at both fridges so if you want a kambucha you don't have to desperately get it from your food and pay $6 for a drink that is never $6 unless you get the large glass container that gives you way more kambucha.Maybe utilize that bar as a coffee or juice bar (that is ""leef themed"") to attract people who will fill the space and stay and study and it won't be empty all the time.Second, improve the speed of your assembly line to make food. New Yorkers have many options for that assembly line style food and the time it takes to make a lettuce wrap is not competitive.",,,
26,Luz M.,"Bronx, NY",7,54,318,5.0,9/7/2017,"Just found out about this place today and WOW! I walked in for a late lunch and was greeted by staff and Owner. The environment was crisp and clean. I got a quick tutorial of how meals are made and order. Pretty basic and simple: you start out with a base (wrap, platter or bowl), select your grains, choose your protein, choose your topping, add any add ons (extra charge) and a dressing. I had the steakhouse wrap wild grain mix, beef short rib, tomato, blue cheese, crispy shallots with balsamic agave dressing and a black cherry soda OMGEEEE! Definitely one of the best lunches I have had in a while. It's not a cheap lunch. Your averaging 14 to 16 dollars but well worth your money. Do a pay day lunch. I can't wait to go again.",1,,1

I got a create your own bowl, and literally got one SPOONFUL, kid you not they used table spoons, of each of my desired toppings. I don't know about the person who reviewed before me, but my bowl was literally half empty when I paid for it. It was almost comical. My husband got the steakhouse, one of the signature bowls, and he literally got 1 small piece of meat. We paid $27 total for two snack sized bowls... we went across the street to get bagels afterwards because we were still STARVING.So sad that this place ended up being a disappointment and will not return in the near future until they figure out their portion sizes.

Trendy and cool spot with a focused and healthy menu with solid choices and upside potential. It's based on a casual eatery concept which I believe will continue to grow more powerful and increasingly mainstream - count me as a huge fan - healthy wraps. Tons of choices dedicated around the lettuce leaf concept in the menu (customizable foods for breakfast lunch and dinner). Diverse menu ... options include locally sourced Swiss chard, four Bibb lettuce cups, salad or a ""Green Breakfast Crepe."" On top of that, there's a diverse menu of grains, vegetables, meats, and nuts.Food is tasty. After one very pleasant experience, I'd like to go again and again to try options  on the menu but initially, an awesome experience.  I was really pleased with the choices of Steakhouse and Swiss chard lettuce wraps - amazing and absolute delights and I'd love to order these again.

42,K H.,"New York, NY",1,92,211,2.0,3/30/2018,Got a salad bowl from here when they first opened up. It was okay. There was not much protein that they put in and the meat tasted a little odd. Salad and veggies in it tasted fresh and good though!,,,
43,Thomas P.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,1/17/2018,"This is probably the worst food I've gotten in Manhattan after living here for 3 years. Ordered the curry hill and soho bowl for dinner and received a rushed order of cold greens that I probably could have picked out of the trash. The food was cold, tasted terrible, was very rushed. The delivery was quick and I can't complain about my Uber eats delivery service but the food that was prepared was awful",1,1,
44,Christina N.,"Greenville, SC",0,2,1,1.0,7/1/2018,"Terrible experience. Tried this place for the first time today, Sunday morning. Asked the waitress to put milk on the side and she poured everything into my coffee and told me I never made the request. Asked her to make me another one and she started having a terrible attitude and almost threw the cup at me. When my BLT sandwich came out it tasted like somebody pored an entire bottle of vinegar on it which was suspicious. When we paid the waitress acted like a b*tch too. Would not recommend this place to anyone.",,,
45,Lauren E.,"Manhattan, NY",6,73,1,1.0,6/10/2018,"A dysfunctional mess of a cafe. Ran out of iced coffee, smoothie bowls, and seemingly the entire menu by 1pm on a Sunday. Staff were extremely rude to customers ahead of me in line and confused about how to manage the situation of people lining up to order things that they no longer had available. Probably should have closed down at that point instead of ignoring customers and yelling at them when they tried to order.",,,
46,Rachel S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,12,0,5.0,3/3/2018,"I first tried this place when they initially opened and wasn't super impressed, but I'm so happy I decided to give it another go! I was in the mood for something closeby and healthy this morning. I got the Hudson Yards bowl to go and it is easily one of the best grain bowls I've had. Super quick service and great topping options! Definitely will be returning to this gem.",,,
47,Anna V.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,4.0,7/9/2018,Great spot to grab a quick lunch with a make your own Mediterranean counter or pre-selected ingredients. Went for lunch and was in and out in less than ten minutes! Interior is very calming and encompasses the clean eating vibe!,,,
48,Samantha G.,"Manhattan, NY",511,3,0,4.0,11/28/2017,"Really good!! Will 100% be ordering from them again! I ordered a custom bowl with the gluten free grains and greens- Then the lemon chicken, apples, broccoli cheddar mix and cheddar. I topped it off with the lemon pesto vinaigrette. I highly recommend this combination!",1,,
49,Shao C.,"New York, NY",75,3,0,1.0,10/31/2017,"I love salad!! But this is probably one of the worst salad restaurants I had check in with:/ the salad bowls are very different from the pictures, and expensive than others.Also their chop beef steak taste like vomitus",1,1,
50,Charlotte B.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,1,0,2.0,8/15/2017,"My sister and I came and were very excited to try this new place as it's near or apartment. My sister got the West Coast Bowl and it was awful - she had to throw it out (which she has never ever done before)! The falafel in the bowl was so bad and dry it was falling apart. The lettuce was so bitter and gross tasting. The bowl was not good. They also barely give you any dressing on the side - filling the little to go container a third of the way.I got the South Pacific bowl, which was very mediocre and bland. Chicken was fatty and long strips that were annoying to eat. Nothing else had any flavor in the bowl. They also put the lettuce cups on top and cover the whole bowl so it's hard to eat - they should put it underneath. These bowls by the way were $14.10!!! Insane.Overall, were very disappointed with this place that we though could become one of our regulars. Maybe the smoothies are better?",,,
51,Mahika S.,"Manhattan, NY",70,18,53,2.0,9/27/2017,"I was really excited to find a healthy place right by where I live. The vibe was earthy which I dig. I wanted something light and healthy so I ordered a combo juice. They have a certain set of ingredients you can choose from.Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I saw her mix pre-packaged juices to make my juice (beet, cucumber, celery, lime, apple). I couldn't comprehend what was happening since I had never seen this happen before. It was too late for me to retract my order. Please specify this is not freshly ground juice but various juices mixed with each other to make ""your"" juice. I was really disappointed and it left a bad taste in my mouth though I haven't tried any of their other services.CAUTION: Don't order the juices, they are pre-packaged fruit/vegetable juices mixed into one combo in a martini shaker.",2,,
52,Tanya M.,"Manhattan, NY",213,229,0,5.0,9/27/2017,"Great new spot in the neighborhood . The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. Love their bowls and leaf wraps , who knew healthy can taste so good",1,1,1
53,Joey S.,"Tenafly, NJ",123,1,0,5.0,9/26/2017,"This is my first Yelp review after many years of browsing without review- so you know this place was good. I got a bowl with greens, sticky rice, chicken, cucumbers, peppers, and cheese. Everything tasted great and fresh. Kept me nice and full, but not heavy or sluggish. And for around 10 bucks, super quick, and with a chic decor, you can't beat it. Owner asked me how I enjoyed it as I finished up--felt good to know he cared, but wasn't overbearing at all. Only critique would be that some of the grains of rice were a little crunchy from maybe being dried out in the heat, but that personally didn't bother me. Plenty of options for toppings, but I'd personally like to maybe to see some carrots and brown rice (farro and quinoa give you healthy grain options--no real shortage there). I'm usually not in this part of town much, but if I were, I would definitely be going back multiple times a week for a diverse, healthy, delicious, affordable meal. For the chicken, it was only about four bucks more than a greasy, mystery-meat type halal platter- so its a no brainer.These guys deserve your business.",1,,
54,M G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,3/16/2018,"Decided to give this place a try for the first time since it's right next door. Chris the ""owner""  was rude and disrespectful. I asked if the guacamole was fresh, and he responded yes with an attitude and told me I shouldn't say those things as a guest. I am a guest? I believe the correct word is customer. He then proceeded to tell me he rather not have me as a customer. So don't worry Chris, you will not have me come again.  Meat all looked dry, everything has an extra charge. Do not waste ur time, go to eons! Better quality and better service! I was so disgusting that I am call New York Heath on this place !",1,,
55,George A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,0,1.0,2/21/2018,"Very poor experience. Ordered an acai bowl and it was completely melted when I got it, and they didn't get the order right in the first place. The grain bowl I ordered was also incorrect and was bad enough that I threw it away almost immediately.",2,,
56,Bridget D.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",2,2,0,5.0,10/30/2017,As someone that is on a strict diet this place is a great place to have encountered on a day I don't have time to prepare my own meals. The staff was very friendly and accommodating for my restrictions. I took my food to go and must say that it is extremely tasty! I'm so glad I came here. I love the use of Swiss Chard. Such a great item you don't see often. The man who I assume was the owner was very friendly and I hope he takes my suggestion to expand into Brooklyn :),,,
57,Rachel M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,2.0,8/19/2017,"Was very excited for this spot to open in the neighborhood. I went within the first few days of opening and was disappointed with both the food and service. The employees didn't seem to know any details about the preparation or toppings, and the food looked a bit bland. Then, after choosing a bowl with black bean falafel and throwing in a few vegetables I was shocked at the $15 price tag for my bowl that was, to be honest, barely half full of food. The black bean falafel was pretty dry, even after adding one of the dressings. And I was a little confused about what to do with the four huge leaves on top. Am I suppose to chop it up? Make lettuce wraps? Neither ended up being a good option. I'd like to give this spot a second chance since it's in the neighborhood, and I truly hope the overall experience improves. The concept reminds me of a hybrid between a salad spot and dig inn - which is really cool, but the execution needs a lot of work.",2,,
58,Krissy D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,5.0,5/22/2018,"I have been waiting for too long for a healthy and consistently fresh place and local leaf has it all! I decided to randomly stop in on a Saturday afternoon when I noticed how clean and new this place looked and I ordered an açaí bowl that came with almost 10 different toppings to choose from for free. Naturally, I chose them all. Since then I have ordered most of their bowls and I've never been disappointed, plus it's an added bonus that they always deliver very quickly",,,
59,Chloé M.,"New York, NY",140,6,0,5.0,11/17/2017,"Tasty fast casual! Every time I've been, the spot has been confusingly empty; I'm surprised, because the food is generally good and healthy, especially for that style of cooking. The staff is super friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Altogether, I am a fan. I think it's an especially good choice for a weeknight when you genuinely cannot muster the will to cook, you want to eat something quickly, but you don't feel like compromising a relative degree of health. I'm a fan! I'll definitely be coming back.",,,
60,Alyssa R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/19/2017,"I am seriously obsessed with this place including the staff! So glad to have found a healthy delicious spot for my lunch break.

62,Jonathan C.,"Florham Park, NJ",1,40,1,5.0,8/19/2017,"Very impressive concept of healthy eating.  Not just a make your own salad like Chopt but they'll also make you a lettuce wrap which I love and even breakfast crepes too.  Would definitely come back. *Wonderful, low sugar, natural smoothies too.  Coffee Smoothie was great.",,1,

Looking forward to going back!,,,
66,Anthony E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,5.0,9/17/2017,"Definitely needed something like this in the area. Until this place, there were no good quick & healthy options around which is odd as it's a prime market for the taking.The staff here are friendly, especially the girl at the front counter making the smoothies.I've been in here a couple of times, 1st time I got a chopped leafy green bowl with:- Farro & wheat blend- Falafel- Mushroom- Blackbeans- Dried cranberriesTasty enough that I'll be back again for another bowl, didn't have any complaints about it. I reckon the portions are bang on.2nd time I came in for an acai bowl. It was delicious. Some berries on top would be good though. Also I added almond butter, I'd rather have it placed on the top rather than mixed into the acai. Heaps glad I can now get an acai bowl in the area, will deffos be back.",,,
67,Molli B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",343,1,0,5.0,8/29/2017,Was super excited for this place to open up close to where I live. I know come here every day and try something new everything. Everything I've gotten is delicious! Especially their gluten free/dairy free brownies!,,,

69,Melissa V.,"Redding, CA",0,3,1,5.0,10/6/2017,"So happy this place is in the area! I lived on the west coast for a few years and the healthy options were insurmountable. Upon being back in NYC I am slightly disappointed with the lack of clean menus. Local Leaf's design is bright and modern and their options are perfect. Met the owner who was friendly, as was the entire staff. I went for the swiss chard wrap with quinoa, chicken, brussels, beats, scallions and maple mustard dressing. Seriously yum. Can't wait to return! Cheers!",,1,
70,Taylor D.,"Waldwick, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,12/9/2017,Go here!!!!! Amazing food and you know everything is fresh! Brunch is awesome and great service. My favorite was the signature Steakhouse but they removed it from the menu recently...here's to hoping they bring it back! #bringbackthebluecheese,,,
71,Megan E.,"New York, NY",324,13,2,5.0,8/16/2017,Not going to lie I definitely wandered into this place the other day because I thought their branding was super cute. I was pleasantly surprised after seeing their menu offering and am so glad to find this awesome new spot so close to my office! I'm personally a big fan of Sweetgreen but often times get tired of ordering the same things over and over again. Local Leaf is another great healthy alternative with plenty of great options available. I suggest either ordering a signature bowl or making your own as I really believe this is the best bang for your buck - not to mention filling! They have so many veggies to choose from and great healthy dressings. The chicken was flavorful and cooked to perfection. I also would definitely suggest trying out the Ssam sauce it had a nice kick to it! Will definitely be back for more!,1,1,

75,Mary S.,"Waterford Works, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,10/14/2017,My main issue is that because of the heat from the grains and veggies the lettuce becomes squishy and gross.
