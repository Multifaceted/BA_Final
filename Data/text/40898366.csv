0,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,204,100,4.0,10/5/2018,"Came here with preeeetty low expectations, because the reviews here suck and I generally trust yelp. I just moved next door and my office is down the street, so I've received a ton of promos, this time I had $10 off, so I had to try it! The interior is relatively clean, but for some reason, everything just feels dirty to me in Fidi. I decided to order the warm barbacoa bowl. I ordered ahead, so was able to skip the looong line that had appeared during lunch hour and picked up my order and paid on my phone and left.The bowl itself looked really plain and disappointing, but actually ended up being solidly tasty! This is a salad shop, so the bowl was healthier and more bland than what you'd get at like a Chipotle or Dos Toros; however, it made me feel good that I wasn't eating 1000+ calories. The barbacoa was flavorful, but tasted fresh and healthy. It is a solid choice for a lighter, but filling lunch! Their salads looked really great too--my coworker is a salad snob and when he saw my bowl, he said he loves just salad for their fresh salads! I would say don't be too scared off by the horrible reviews--I had a great experience here & would probably return in the future!",,,1
1,Beril E.,"New York, NY",155,99,458,2.0,10/20/2018,"Considering it's so popular, this place was an unexpected disappointment. I don't know what I was expecting, not that it would live up to the quality of Sweetgreen, but at least was hoping that it would reach the level of quality Chop't brings. I was mistaken. Salads are overpriced considering you're eating lazily washed and barely cut pieces of lettuce with tasteless rubbery looking chicken. I've tasted a total of 3 salads here, all of which tasted boringly predictable and yet still bad. The buffalo chicken salad looks very different from its menu photo where the chicken is nicely smeared in buffalo sauce. My buffalo chicken tasted like grilled chicken and with only pepper jack cheese, celery, and tortilla chips, had not much going for it. The celery, which should never be the staple in salads since it just tastes bland, was cut in different styles all throughout. I almost wondered if my salad was prepared in between shift changes that accounted for such a huge discrepancy in celery piece sizes. The thai chicken crunch salad again has celery (!), red cabbage, grilled chicken, carrots, and thankfully the redeemer: wontons. The flavor of the salad is overpowered by the spicy Thai peanut sauce, which was a poor attempt at replicating the bold delicious Thai flavors.They were serving small bowls of chicken Caesar salad to taste when we arrived so I got to try one. Their chicken Caesar salad is pretty standard affair, so if you're a fan of chicken Caesar this salad won't be disappointing, but also not outstanding either. As their name suggests, it was just salad, nothing more. You shouldn't come here if you are looking to find a spot where you learn to love salads. For that, you can go to Sweetgreen at less than a mile's distance.",,,
2,John B.,"New York, NY",3,10,0,1.0,9/6/2018,"These people do not know what they are doing.  They always took long for ordering so my firm would simply account for that when ordering, but was never a fan of it.  Then today they screwed up a delivery -- they indicated the salad was delivered, but it wasn't.  Fine.  Things happen.Or so I thought.  Then I call and the person I spoke to explained that since the order was ""missed"" she could not reimburse me for the food, but I could always put in another order (and pay both for that order and the first one).As this person ""explained"", an order is ""missed"" when the delivery person (who in this case never left me a message indicating he could not order or anything like that) cannot order but does not bring the food back, instead ""disposing of it"".That is terrible: they screw up the order; then they throw out good food?  And then they want me to pay for it.We have ordered thousands of dollars of salads from this place over the last couple of years.  We shall never order from here again.",,,
3,Demi H.,"New York, NY",6,69,52,3.0,8/1/2018,"Ok, I was SO nervous about eating here. Based on the reviews, this spot is supposedly a huge no-go. But the 50% promo when you down load their app was a hugeee persuasion. I ordered through their app. which was really easy & convenient. All I had to do was go pick it up. The app instructed me to go 15 min after the order was placed - which I did. Once I arrived, they were just finishing up order- I was very happy that it actually did take around 15 min. I hate when my salad sits there and gets soggy. There was no wait, this was around 7pm. The customer service was also very pleasant, they were helpful and kind.The salad it self was not that great. It was small compared to the bowl and could have deff used a bigger potion of ingredients. It seemed as if it was thrown together really fast, with no care.Overall, with all the other great salad destinations around FIDI I don't think I'll be back. HOWEVER, my experience wasn't terrible and I can't understand how this place is as deadly as everyone is saying on here.",,,1

Updated review","Was really excited to try this place but it's definitely underwhelming. I got the carnitas bowl and the portion size was small, it was overpriced, and the flavor was VERY basic.

The pita chips gave a nice crunch, and the pickled red onions added an extra zing.  My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and said it was delicious. He went back for another while I was resting from treatment the next day. We found the place to be clean, with fresh ingredients and a helpful staff.

10,Elizabeth I.,"Bayside, NY",120,49,1,1.0,6/6/2018,"This location at the very least should be closed down!!  Perhaps all of them. Not only did I get food poisoning within an hour of eating their chicken Caesar  salad, but their concern and customer service was abysmal.  They have a general number in Manhattan 212- 244-1111 this central number transfers you to the location where  you ordered from.  I work in downtown Manhattan near the Municipal Building and Chambers street, so my location is Maiden Lane.  I ordered a salad that I received at 12:34 P. M.  Within one hour of eating I had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 1/2 hours!!  I was dizzy and had a headache in addition to feeling dehydrated.  I called the general number and they  connected me to Maiden Lane. The first person I spoke gave me the third degree before putting on ""the Manager""  someone named ""Elbia"".  She introduced herself as the manager. I even asked her who she was and after stumbling over her words, she said she was the manager. When I told her what was wrong she told me that she had to report it to the manager. I then said: ""I thought you were the manager"" She argued and said she was the manager on duty.  No one wanted to take responsibility. she asked for my number so her manager could call me back, 3 times I asked her when they would call. If after 5 I would give them my cell phone number, if before 5 my office number. She said I would get a call back in 5 minutes so I gave my office number. I then called back the general number one hour later and when I complained  about not getting a call back, I was told:  ""you have a nice day,"" in a very sarcastic tone. Guess when I finally got the call back? At 7:14 at night from Thalia Rayon, the so called manager who was very concerned as to how I was doing!!!! By that time I could've been dead!! LOL  I called the Dept. of Health and filed a formal complaint for Food Poisoning. They will be investigated. So not only will their food kill you, literally, but their atrocious customer service practices will slay you too!! Stay away. Red alert. Disgusting and mind you NEVER DID THEY OFFER TO REFUND MY MONEY!!! NOT THAT I WANTED IT, BUT AT LEAST OFFER.  I spent the entire afternoon in the bathroom and it could've been worse!! what an awful place. This place doesn't even deserve half a star!!",,,

12,Erik D.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",11,3,0,1.0,1/27/2018,"I was about to review this as 2 stars for being poor quality. But while typing this review, I bit in a piece of bone (in my vegetarian salad), so 1 star it is. There are several problems with the food:1. The food is chopped to pieces so small that I can't recognize most ingredients anymore. I'm talking about less than one fifth of an inch. It's hard to distinguish red olives over beet roots, or chickpea over tofu. It's baby food. Most flavor is lost.2. The chickpeas are very dry. Taste like canned food. Among the worst I've ever tasted from any restaurant.3. The salads are quite small. Normally when I pay $15 for a salad, I get something filling. Chopped across the street is much better.I don't generally leave Yelp reviews and I would not generally give 1 star, but given the poor quality of the food and bone inside my vegetarian/vegan salad, this place is actually worth 1 star. I think the place should be inspected, since I almost lost a tooth and generally don't eat animal products (although I could have lived with a piece of chicken or some other honest mistake).",,,

So a salad that starts off at $10.99 will end up being $16 - $18 after tax, BS delivery charge, and tip.  Too much. And... to top it all, for the $1.99 delivery fee - they forgot part of the order.  Things happen... I understand, but when I called customer service and let them know (212-244-1111) the woman was a bit curt.

Updated review","This Just Salad location finally got the revamp it needed. The look has drastically changed and the food is fresher than it was. I noticed a few new faces running the place so I think it's safe to assume management shifted and for the better. There isn't any seating which is a pain, but overall it's looking and tasting better!",,,
18,Susan D.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,1.0,2/8/2017,"I work across the street from this location.  I started going there daily last week. I am vegan.  I asked for the green board and as I asked for items, I stopped and ask if everything I'd gotten (including two specials) was vegan and I was assured it was.   On the second day I went, I went through the line and realized that the chopper had not changed his gloves before coming to the green board; I asked him to and he said ""oops"" and did so.  I let it go.  I continued eating there.  I wasn't feeling great a few of those evenings, but thought it had to do with something else I'd eaten.Today I went and they were out of an item I'd asked for.  When the manager brought more, she asked me if I knew there was parmesan cheese in it.  No, in fact, I had been told last week that it was vegan.  I also had noticed that the guy filling the bowl had not put on new gloves before using his hands to add my lettuce.  This is all not good. I walked out.I then returned to speak with a manager.  She handled it well, but - really - how do you fix it when you've dishonestly given someone food that they do not want in their body?  I was livid.  There is no remedying this situation and I just think other customers should be aware that this location - maybe the whole chain - is not really caring at all about food sensitivities, etc.",3,,
19,K M.,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",1,4,1,1.0,7/31/2016,"Dirty lettuce and the most foul turkey I have ever tasted. I would not eat this again and would certainly not recommend. It's rare that I don't finish a meal, and I couldn't even make it through half of this.",1,,
20,Carrie C.,"Elmhurst, NY",6,43,25,2.0,3/18/2015,"I came here around 5 pm because I had to work late and was starving.  Place was empty; I imagine it's busy at lunch time.   I'm giving 2 stars for the really nice guy who made my wrap.   I got the tandoori fire without the pita chips and he suggested I pick another side to replace it.   The place also looks very clean.   However as I was taking a picture to put on yelp I was told ""You can't take pictures in here!  What are you taking a picture of anyway bowls?""  by another staff member.  I don't see why pictures aren't allowed but if that's the policy I could have been asked not to in a polite manner. I was disappointed when I got back to my office at how bland the wrap was!   The tandoori red hot chicken had barely any flavor at all.   I don't think I'll be back given all the other options in the area.",4,,
21,Dana P.,"Manhattan, NY",150,14,0,1.0,5/23/2017,"I am a big Just Salad fan and often eat at the location on the upper east side and it is great. since my office moved to Maiden Lane last September I have been going to this location. All was great until the remodel. After that they were consistently out of ingredients (letting me order a buffalo chicken salad and not telling me they didnt have the dressing until i had already had the salad chopped). The new crowd cannot handle the FiDi lunch rush at all and are rushing you out, barely chopping, and just all around a disorganized mess. The remodel actually made it harder to get your salad than it was before. Finally, this is the only location that i have noticed to change from plastic bowls. While I agree that using less plastic is beneficial for the environment, what is unacceptable is that the new bowls are MUCH smaller and are never completely filled, yet somehow the prices have remained the same? With so many choices for lunch in FiDi you would think this place would try to keep its customers. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.Just providing an update-- I reluctantly tried this place again because I love the buffalo chicken salad. It is deplorable. The amount of chicken I got was pathetic and they no longer chop salads. The workers had misplaced attitude and frankly my salad was gross. Whoever runs his place should be fired.",,,

For example, today I ordered my normal Cesar Salad but when I looked at the romaine lettuce I noticed a LOT more white pieces than green leafs of lettuce and also wilted green romaine lettuce.

I see a guy standing with a pad and pen, taking orders. ""What can I get for you today?"" he asked, and I panicked. ""I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE WHAT DO I DO?"" was my response.  He very quickly explained the concept, and I said I wanted to pick my own salad stuff.

I typically order the California with edamame in place of tomatoes, and light on the asian sesame dressing (I recommend the asian sesame or the balsamic vinaigrette).

Other reviewers have complained about small salad portions. This has NEVER happened to me.  My salad containers are filled to the brim with what feels like half a pound of lettuce and vegetables.Salad dressing options are clearly marked, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.  I usually opt for fresh squeezed lemon.Many of the ingredients available at Just Salad are always organic such as the mesclun, mushrooms, portabella mushrooms, chick peas, black beans and tofu.  Their website lists non-GMO ingredients (such as edamame) and a huge list of local ingredients (including the farms where they come from).   The website also has a handy nutrition info calculator.I wish more companies would follow their lead and be transparent about the foods they offer!  You can purchase a reusable BPA-free salad container for $1, and each time you use it, you will get 2 free toppings.  This is great for your wallet and for the environment. If you download their iphone app and enter your credit card info once, you can leave your wallet at home use the app to pay for your meals.   And you'll get $7 credit for every $100 spent.If you are vegan or vegetarian you can sub tofu for any protein in one of their chef designed salads.  You can also swap out other ingredients.  I like to swap out cheese or pita chips for pickled onions.Along with Whole Foods, Magic Mix Juicery and Sun In Bloom - Just Salad is probably one of the few places in the Financial District where you can find a healthy, preservative free  non-GMO lunch.",1,,

All the food is made to order in front of you and they have a good selection of ""recommended"" salad combinations (which change monthly) or you can make your own. I've only had the salads / wraps (it is Just Salads after all) and the portions are a good size that leave me as full as a salad can. I'd say the average person spends $8-15 dollars depending on the salad/wrap, and whether you get a drink and/or chips.  On the downside the place has no seating area. However in the summer months, it is right down the street from South Street Seaport so you can always get a healthy meal at Just Salads and then eat on the water.",,,

The lines are still long here, but not anywhere near as long as midtown. Just Salad is nice (in theory) because you can make your own salad or choose one of the pre-determined combos that the restaurant offers. The pros here are that it's fast, healthy and pretty fresh ingredients.

My biggest turn off at most other salad spots is that stuff they call meat, always that rubber meat or deli cold cuts, but this place uses what seems like real pieces of turkey and thats an auto win in my book.The other added bonuses here are the dressings and option to mix in kale, and of course the fact that everything always tastes freshThe only down side is that the toppings add up quickly here, and at minimum the salad is about 10 bucks. If it wasn't for that factor and the need for variety, I would eat salad here everyday.",2,,2
49,Melanie W.,"Raleigh, NC",148,139,64,3.0,4/14/2015,"It physically pains me to write this review -- I used to love Just Salad. Heck, I practically lived there. But, I just can't tolerate it anymore. ""It"" being the prices combined with the decline of customer service. The staff -- not just at this location, but every location I've been to in the last month -- don't care. To them, it's just salad. (See what I did there? I know, I'm hysterical.) But, to me, it's ""I'm paying $12.00 for a salad that's already overpriced, please, at the very least, make it correctly.""I stopped in today at lunchtime for my new favorite salad, the Cajun El Paso Grill. (For anyone that loves spicy salads, try it -- you're mouth will be on fire! Also, be sure to get it with the Smokey Poblano Ranch -- it's better than the vinaigrette.) The line was super long, but it really wasn't that bad -- time-wise. The girl taking orders was friendly and welcoming, too. It all went downhill at the salad bar, though.The girl, quite literally, threw my salad together. As in, the tomatoes that she threw at my salad -- at (!!!) -- didn't even make it into the bowl. Okay...I'm exaggerating, three tomatoes made it into my salad, but two were runaways. Regardless, this is unacceptable. I also doubt she put everything into my salad that I paid for -- she was too busy making four (!!!) salads at once. Now, I understand multi-tasking because it's busy, but if you can't make four salads at once -- don't do it! I would rather wait an extra minute and get what I paid for than leave quickly with a half-assed salad. In addition to unsuccessfully making four salads, she put her ungloved hand and the paper orders in my salad (!!!) when she was moving the bowl over to the next station. Like, seriously?! I cannot even begin to describe how disgusted I was by her lack of hygiene and that I was paying $12.00 for a tainted salad.I told the girl at checkout what had happened, expecting a small discount or, at the very least, a little compassion, but she really couldn't care less. All in all, it was a frustrating experience and I was left wondering if the salad really was worth it. I'm sure I could've gone somewhere else just as delicious, just as healthy and cheaper -- I'm looking at you, Terri!However, having said all that (whew!), I still gave this location three stars because the Cajun El Paso Grill salad is really f***ing good, the line moves pretty quickly at lunchtime, the man who chopped my salad and the girl taking orders were friendly and, most importantly, I cannot (solely) blame the employees at this location for the price increase.",1,3,

Their kale is really great and I'm very happy they offer it. Try ordering a kale salad at Hale and Hearty and they look at you funny.  I think Just Salad offers a good combination of quality ingredients and value. Oh and the peanut dressing is really good! This location is really in a key spot for the growing residential base of customers downtown.

The wraps though I have felt are usually quite flavorless and compared to the ones Hale and Hearty makes, they're just bad.

Not to mention that it is highly affordable. For what you would spend on a fatty, unsatisfying ""meal"" at McDonald's, you can get a HUGE, delicious, custom salad at ""Just Salad.""Although I have never been to other locations of this store, I love seeing the salad creators chop and mix my salad right in front of me! That's right, after choosing all of your toppings, they dump it all out and blend it up for you! And then, they pour on as much dressing as you want and they even top it off with a slice of their delicious olive oil and herb infused bread! I swear, these salads are so huge, I have yet to finish an entire one.I have also tried some of their vegetable soups, and these are also very tasty. Everything here just seems to be rich and satisfying...it's all natural, so why shouldn't it be?Do yourself a favor.

I don't usually mind them using the same cutting board and blade (although the cutting boards in this joint are noticeably discolored and don't look clean), but the tong that you use to toss the salad? When I told the employee he should wash it before preparing a new salad, he turned visibly hostile and asked me to name a list of things I'm allergic to. I told him it should be a protocol to clean the tong whether the customer had an allergy or not. Then he retorted saying that he ""had to move fast."" There was no other customer in the line behind me.I asked to speak to the manager and she offered to make me a new salad - however, neither she nor the employee apologized. I was simply told that I needed to make clear before they started making my salad if I had an allergy (which was completely missing the point) and that they don't clean anything - blade, board, tong - until they make at least two salads. I believe when a customer orders a Thai peanut salad, she shouldn't be tasting Caesar - whether she is allergic to something or not.

I always get the Chicken Caesar Salad with corn and eggs whites as my freebies (with salads I tend to stick with what I like). If you come for lunch during the workday the line is pretty long- like out the door long but it moves very fast.  The people who work here are always courteous and professional.  The 2 things that kind of bother me but aren't really that big of a deal are 1. when they chop the salad I get sad because a lot of pieces fall out =( and 2. the bowl gets greasy because the chopping people use the same gloves to hand you the bowl as when they made the salad.

This will also help you avoid any ""sticker shock.""If you are looking to eat a healthy lunch (mostly greens/veggies) then you can get that for really cheap here. If you want to add on additional ingredients (like meats/cheeses) then that will obviously increase the cost quite a bit. If you choose to build your own salad you get 4 essential ingredients (which includes a lot of items that would normally be considered ""premium"" at many of the other salad joints (e.g., Hale & Hearty). Then if you have the reusable bowl, you can get 2 additional ""essential"" ingredients (or 1 cheese item).

My favorites are the buffalo chicken and the ceasar salad.  If you buy their reusable salad bowl, you get 2 free toppings each time you bring it with you... so you can help save the planet and some pocket change at the same time!  They also happen to be relatively inexpensive, it's the only spot I can get a salad for under $8 in the area.I won't even deduct a star for the rude cashiers... just sayin'",,1,1

There's never a line and I've never waited more than 10 minutes for them to prepare my bowl of greens. The staff is friendly enough, never rude but not bff material.

I'd give them a high five if I could.In terms of freshness, I haven't encountered any questionable ingredients in all the salads I've eaten here. And mind you, I'm eating them past 9pm so I'd say that's a good sign. Lettuce here has always been crisp and the chicken cooked thoroughly. If anything, the BREAD is probably what's most stale at this place and it has nothing to do with the salad itself.The salad bowls here are huge for me, so one order is good for two meals. Hello, leftovers! I'd say it's reasonably priced if you look at it that way, about $9/10 more or less per salad.Definitely try the Asian Sesame & California salads. You obviously have the option to create your own but I'm too lazy for that, and you can always customize their ready-made ones to how you like.Not worthy of 5 stars because last year I remember them having a significant amount of flies hovering above the salad dressings.

Working in advertising allows me to appreciate their very thorough in store experience and customer retention program. First, when you're getting your salad, the ingredients are super fresh and the place reeks of cleanness. I even love how there are specifically designated people that are there to chop your salad - kinda like the japanese tappanyaki chefs. hahaAlso I love the reusable bowls and loyalty cards. Anything that helps me save money and lose weight, I'm all for. Also they allow you to customize your own salad which is something I can really appreciate as I have picky vegetables.The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is that it doesn't pack a lot of flavor.

I then called back, and  asked to speak with Jennifer, and the call was placed on hold, then the call was mysteriously ""disconnected"". I then called back, and spoke with Jennifer who then said that her delivery person was on foot, and got lost and was one block away. 1 pm and still no food. At this point, everyone who placed an order no longer wanted their food, since our luncheon was scheduled from 12-1 pm and was now over. I then called the restaurant again, to advise her that we still had not received our orders.  Jennifer then stated to me that ""her delivery person is only 4 feet 9 inches"" and had to deliver on foot. (Unsure of what that had to do with the delay of the deliveries). There were two brown  bags, with small containers of salads and wraps, it was not heavy at all. I then inquired about a discount, since my company was so inconvenienced by their error, she said that she would have to contact the customer service department, to see about granting us a 50% discount. 1:05 pm, and still NO FOOD! I then left the office to walk to Just Salad, to find out where our order was, and demand a full refund.

The idea of a salad place that rewards customers for bringing their brightly colored reusable salad bowls back sounded like a cool way to reduce waste. And I always welcome another food option in the financial district. Unfortunately, this place was a huge disappointment. They seemed to pull their staff from the reject pile at the DMV. The pricing system means that you either get the salad you want for $15, or you compromise and end up with a salad you don't really enjoy and still have to pay $11 for it. And to top it off, I never even got the re-usable bowl. Apparently that costs extra. Awesome. So while I was waiting to pay $11 for a sub-par salad in a wasteful disposable plastic bowl, my friend was trying to explain basic math to the teller. She mistyped something into the register and lacked the skills to resolve it. After we both verified that she had in fact given him to much change, she laughed it off as though it didn't matter.

There are a ton of fresh looking toppings (including wheat berries and edamame! who else offers that?) and the bowl of whatever green you select is a large size. Then, after compiling your salad---and this is where I got a confused look on my face--it is handed to a ""chopper,"" who then dumps the contents of your perfectly made salad out onto a used* cutting board (EW!).

Everything that was ever chopped on said cutting board goes into your bowl.Gross.Can we say potential salmonella hazard??

162,Dee L.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",15,47,2,5.0,8/15/2008,"I tried Just Salad for the first time last night, and will probably be coming back to grab dinner at least once a week. The staff is incredibly friendly. They all made conversation with me, which I appreciated after my rigorous workout and trek in the pouring rain in hopes of finding something healthy for dinner. Though it is a bit pricey for a salad, that seems to be a theme in NYC. And as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the best salads you'll find. They have a pretty extensive list of specialy salads, but none seemed all that healthy to me. I opted to create my own, which is awesome since there are about 40 toppings, in addition to several protein and cheese options to choose from. They also earn big points from me for having more than 1 or 2 fat-free dressing options. The last thing I'll mention that I loved about Just Salad is that they chop it up for you, and ask how finely you'd like it chopped. Saves me the trouble of trying to cut through lettuce in a heaping plastic salad bowl. When I wanna eat, I wanna eat!",4,,2
163,Amanda H.,"Cambridge, MA",109,7,0,5.0,5/15/2009,"Oh Just Salad, you rock! Just looking over at my little green reusable salad bowl makes me smile with glee. Walking into Just Salad is kind of like walking into salad heaven. The greens are always fresh, there are always an abundance of toppings, and the dressings that are vegan (and low-fat, etc) are marked! Now, if only I hadn't just eaten lunch...",1,,
164,Scott L.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,185,2,4.0,10/11/2009,Definitely a fan of this whole create your own salad deal in NYC. Something the west coast lacks. I got a delicious salad that I couldn't even finish. A bit pricey but I feel like I got two meals out of the deal.,,,
165,Samantha D.,"Oakland, CA",0,5,0,1.0,2/26/2012,"I have constant problems with Just Salad getting my order wrong.  This last time, they delivered a salad that wasn't even chopped and had the wrong dressing.  When I called the restaurant they suggested I just wait for them to remake and redeliver it AND give them the old one back.  I guess it never occurred to them that I might have ordered delivery because I was hungry.",,,
166,brb b.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,154,0,2.0,10/24/2011,"This place is CHEAP! As in not that the salads are cheap (b/c they are not), it's the owners that are cheap. They charge $3.25 extra for shrimp and put 3 tiny pieces. Seriously???",,,
167,Martha M.,"Troy, NY",3,3,0,4.0,2/9/2010,"I dig it, I work right near the Financial District location, and I bought the bowl and use the card (higher percentage off with the card after 2 pm, and no line usually), and I like it.  I steer clear of any/all industrial meat, so my salad are usually under 8 bucks with the bowl/card deal (esp. after 2).  I sorta wish there were more suggested salads sometimes.  Here's my go-to make your own salad: romaine; cucumber, tomato, red onion, banana peppers, calamata olives, feta cheese: chop with lemon/olive oil/salt & pepper.  Greek salad to go, yums.",,,
168,Suzanne G.,"New York, NY",98,259,5,4.0,5/19/2008,"The staff is always so friendly when I come here. They're joking around, maybe goofing off, but my salad is always made correctly and is delicious so I don't care. I usually order the chef specials and the $8.95 isn't a bad deal. I find salad to be one of the most pricey foods in NYC- those toppings can cost a fortune! Every time I've gotten a salad here, it's been fresh and positively yummy. I just wish they had one on the UWS!!",1,,1
169,Toby G.,"New York, NY",10,77,1,1.0,7/29/2008,"I was very excited when Just Salad opened up downtown since I was a frequent visitor when my office was in midtown.  Unfortunately, the customer service was awful and I don't need this hassle when I'm trying to relax on my lunch hour.   Just Salad is a great option for environmentalist like me since they have reusable bowls.  It's too bad that you need to specifically request the bowl when you first order, otherwise they don't give you one.  When I asked to have my salad transferred to a reusable bowl I was denied.  They told me I couldn't have the reusable bowl b/c the clear plastic bowl that they put my salad in would go to waste.  I told them that I am familiar with reusable bowl option but they would not make an exception.  So, I'm done.  Just Salad lost a customer who could have been a loyal fan all over a 2 cent plastic bowl.  Instead, I favor Au Bon Pain or Plaza Deli.  Plus, who really wants to pay $10 for just a salad?",1,,
170,Tara H.,"New York, NY",9,26,1,4.0,6/22/2009,"When I am working late, this is where I order.  Typically, I order through Seamless Web.  I recommend the Immunity or Salmon salad.  There are tons of dressings and sides.  Perfect for when you're working late at the desk and don't want to destroy your body.  This is probably one of the few healthy and delicious options when it's late night in the Financial District.",,,
171,Lauren G.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",159,461,75,4.0,4/3/2008,I love this place. Everything is really fresh tasting and they have a bunch of different choices for salads. I also LOVE that they chop it up for you and put it in a recyclable container to bring back and my salads are always under $10 because I just usually get one off the board and take something out and substitute something else.,1,,
172,Kelly W.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,6,0,3.0,4/16/2008,I just came back to work after trying this place out. Not sure how you go about getting the recyclable container that people speak of. I  had mine in a plastic to-go container that I threw out. I do not recommend the tofu-dijon dressing. It was bland and watery. They did not have black beans as a topping nor pine nuts (aren't these pretty normal salad bar ingredients?) The sizes of the salad are decent though.,,,
173,katie n.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,114,0,4.0,5/14/2008,"i actually really don't like salad. i wish i liked it more because then maybe i'd be healthier and lose that 10 (ok maybe more than 10) lbs i've been bitching about since, well, college.  but now that just salad (which is misleading, THEY HAVE WRAPS!) has been introduced as one of my lunch options in my work hood, i'm actually starting to not mind the leafy lunch concoctions so much!  i do think the price is kind of offensive for a salad; you're hard pressed to find any combination of anyting for under $10 unless you go with greens and dressing.  which CLEARLY is not an option.  but with your $10+ dollar salad, you do get a healthy satisfying lunch, served in a recyclable/reusable bowl (costs a buck, but every time you bring it back you get to add 2 toppings, not bad not bad).  again i'm no authority on salad, but they're def. better than ones you can get at au bon pain, hale and hearty, europa, and the rest of the shitty places in this neighborhood.  the ingredients are tasty and diverse, and the signature salads are a great jump off point to create a meal to your liking.  good cheese selection, great leafy green selection, and the shallot sherry vinagrette dressing is fantastic.minus one star because today the man looked me in the eye and said, ""we are out of avocados"" when, just over his shoulder, i spied 3 unpacked crates of them.....",,,
