0,Sophia Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",230,72,301,5.0,8/26/2018,"Came for restaurant week and already cannot wait to get back here! The food was nothing short of amazing. My sister and I both got the tuna poke for starters and it was so fresh and perfectly seasoned. My sister has a nut allergy which they were accommodating of. Our server took note of it, but both pokes came out with macadamia nuts anyways. Before we were even able to check/notice, the server quickly came to check on my sister's plate to see if the adjustment was made. The plate was switched out in no time, which we really appreciated. We shared our main courses - mentaiko spaghetti w/ uni and the five spice glazed pork chop. The mentaiko spaghetti was so creamy and rich, especially with the added uni. Absolutely delicious! We weren't super excited about the five spice pork chop, but once we got into it, there were no regrets. The pork chop was perfectly cooked, so moist inside! It was a great combination with the spatzle and pineapple, which added a nice sweetness to complement the glaze.Last but not least, we shared the pineapple upside down cake which was one of the best desserts I've ever had at a restaurant. The cake serves two and as told by our server, it isn't always on the menu. The extremely moist cake sat on top of coconut and pineapple ice cream, which went with the cake SO WELL. The sweetness of the caramelized pineapple topped off the cake wonderfully along with the tartness of the sauce. 100% would come back because of this dessert!Great service + great food -- come during restaurant week for a good deal too!",2,,
1,Katie C.,"Manhattan, NY",107,178,187,4.0,10/14/2018,"Noreetuh, with it's dimly lit interior, serves up a classy take on the Hawaiian dishes and ingredients you know and love. My friend went for the 3 course prix-fixe dinner course (~ $48). Each dish was beautifully presented and, more importantly, delicious. His meal included: beef tongue musubi, palm heart salad, and luau leaf tortellini. I ordered mentaiko spaghetti. Every bite was amazing. The smoked cod was tender, the noodles were perfectly cooked. I highly recommend this dishVisited on a Saturday night around 7pm and, fortunately, was able to be seated without a reservation. In the future, I would make a reservation before coming to ensure a table.",,,
2,Iris C.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,15,45,2.0,8/30/2018,"I came here for restaurant week two weeks ago with my boyfriend. (Oops didn't have time to write a review) We were super excited after seeing all the good reviews but left disappointed. Appetizers:Tuna poke- We actually thought this was the best dish of the night. It was seasoned well and the tuna tasted fresh. Very light and refreshing. Silken tofu with uni- was very upset with this. The uni just didn't taste fresh and the ikura was extremely salty. Considering that we had to pay a supplemental cost too.. this was not worth it at allBeef tongue musubi- this was okay. It wasn't super flavorful, we should've just went with the spam musubi instead EntreesMentaiko spaghetti with uni- this was horrible! I should've known from the uni in the appetizer but I didn't think to change my order. The spaghetti was too sour tasting for me. The uni was even worse than in the appetizer! It didn't even melt in your mouth so it was a very weird texture. This may have been because it was sitting on top of warm spaghetti? I'm not too sure. Had to pay supplemental cost for this too. Five-spice glazed pork chop- this was not bad. We thought the flavor was good and it wasn't over cooked or anything DessertPineapple upside down cake- this was good. The ice cream was refreshing. Overall, the service was okay but the food was not up to par. I wouldn't come back here. For people that do, I would recommend the tuna poke and pork chop.",,,
3,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,472,472,4.0,11/9/2018,"I would give this place 4.5 stars.  I came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  We ordered the prix fixe menu - a snack, appetizer, and entree for $48 which is not bad.  We ordered the corned beef tongue musubi snack, the grilled octopus appetizer, and the luau leaf tortellini entree.  We also had the scallop sashimi appetizer and the five spice glazed pork chop entree.  My favorite dishes were the scallop sashimi appetizer and the five spice glazed pork chop entree.  The scallop sashimi appetizer had interesting ingredients: green almonds? there is such a thing? The flavors were interesting: Sichuan chili oil with scallops? I also appreciated the Japanese rice crunchies for texture.  I actually really liked the pork chop entree not for the pork chop (which was delicious too) but for the fennel puree and grilled fennel.  For dessert, we ordered the black sesame rice pudding which was not memorable.  The service was fast and very friendly.  They take an instax picture for you at the end of the meal, one for you and one for their wall.  You can decorate it any way you want which was cute.  It was a great meal and I would come back to try their other dishes.",4,,3
4,Jonghan L.,"Manhattan, NY",232,85,244,2.0,8/10/2018,"3 stars for food. 2 stars for service. Noreetuh isn't worth it IMO. Came on a Friday night for restaurant week at 8:30pm. We had a party of 3 and had our reservations from Opentable. It took them 15 minutes to get us seated which was pretty frustrating. The three of us all ordered the restaurant week menu. AMBIANCE:Dark, with candles lighted throughout. Ambiance was quite lively with conversations here and about, but not loud enough so you can't hear your friends talking. I suppose this would be a good place to take a date or friends.PROS:Highlights was the pork chop main course on a bed of succotash. Pork was incredibly juicy and the five spices greatly complimented the meat itself. Seasoned pretty well, and the succotash was creamy, had corn, and was a pleasant contrast to the pork chop itself. Blue marlin was also decent as you can tell the fish was very fresh. Pork cutlet was fried to a perfect crisp and was moist and juicy inside - I really enjoyed the sauce that it came with. The pokebowl was also super delightful and fresh, as the combination of balsamic, herbs, seasme oil, and tuna created a amalgamation of eclectic, yet harmonious flavors. CONS:Biggest letdown for tonight has got to be the suppppeerrrr long wait times. Our three course meal took at least 1.5 hours to finish, and mind you we had about 30 minutes in between each course. Service was way too slow! Definitely had better service around the area. As for the food itself - Blue marlin was great but the bok choy garnish that it was served with was SMOTHERED in balsamic - it made the bok choy taste vinegary and incredibly acidic. Definitely was rather unpleasant to eat. Heart of Palms was incredibly bland and underseasoned. It tasted like I was eating paper and was nothing too special. Pineapple upside down cake was too sweet IMO, as my friend and I couldn't finish it all because the pineapple and the breading below it was overly saturated with sweetness. OVERALL:Was quite disappointed with my experience at Noreetuh considering we are paying $42 for a restaurant week experience. Also wait times in between courses was absurdly long. If you have 2 hours to kill on three courses go knock yourself out here, but if not don't avoid coming here for their restaurant week specials.",,2,
5,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,5.0,6/28/2018,"I have never been to Hawaii but after eating in Noreetuh I'm planning to make a trip there sometime soon.This was my second time here, but I had forgotten how good it was. The chefs have their pedigree, the three used to work at Per Se. So happy they opened up Noreetuh! It is a very down to earth place where you can get tasty dishes at reasonable prices. It has a boutique feel given it is small and attention is excellent.The wine list boasts 200 curated wine selections and they even decanted our red wine Lopez Bosconia '05 ($75 - recommended!).We shared (2 people):- Big-eye Tuna Poke ($22): macadamia nut, pickled jalapeño, seaweed. One of my favorite pokes. The tuna is sooo fresh. It melts in your mouth.- Galbi Short Ribs ($12): it has a sauce, or it is marinated is something really good.- Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp ($19): soba noodles, miso cucumbers, mushroom, cilantro- Grilled Hawaiian Opah ($17): spring onion, fiddlehead ferns, kumquats. Firm white fish. Delicous!- Bruléed hawaiian pineapple ($10): lime zest, 'alaea salt. Please get this! So fresh yet so tasty. We added a scoop of coconut ice cream and it was one of the best decisions ever.I will be back soon. Hopefully one day I'm very hungry so I can get their 3 course prix-fixe ($42).",2,,2
6,Maya R.,"Queens, NY",171,108,55,5.0,9/17/2018,"Came here to celebrate my bday as i was looking for a unique menu with a great wine list and i could not have been more impressed! This was a month ago and i still remember every aspect of my meal. Every dish we had was so carefully thought out, with a beautiful composition of colors, layers of texture and flavor. My bf and i shared the poké, octopus, squash tempura, spaghetti, and chicory salad, and had the pineapple upside down cake. Hard to name a favorite but for me the most enjoyable were the poké and tempura, and most fun was the cake! we also had a couple of the wines by the glass, including a memorable pinot noir. For me this is definitely a special occasion place, as its a bit expensive, but everything about the experience was high quality, from ingredients, to service.",,,
7,Keeley G.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",7,80,63,4.0,9/11/2018,"If you're looking for something refreshingly different this is the place to visit! I'd never had spam before but this way this place does it I might actually be a fan! My friend got the Hawaiian platter and absolutely loved it- it had eggs, spam, sausage, Mac salad and kimchi. Not being a fan of kimchi myself I got the tuna poke bowl (minus the kimchi) and it was pretty good, I will note it's predominately rice though. The Musubi is a must try! It's a Hawaiian staple for sure, I want to go back and try the corned-beef tongue Musubi. We went during brunch, dinner looks much fancier but I plan on coming back to find out!",,,
8,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",171,54,99,3.0,8/21/2018,"Pretty quaint restaurant but kind of stuffy inside - maybe the AC was broken that day when I went. Cute, trendy decor with polaroids of past customers! Food: -Big-eye tuna poke: 4/5. This was a pretty light dish - rice was well seasoned and the kimchi was a good addition to cut through some of the sweetness of the rice and poke.-Kalua pork bowl: 3/5. It was a little bland and I think there may have been a little too much vinegar in the seasoning? Kind of plain and I didn't think the egg added much to the pork. Protein to rice ratio was off too. -Mochiko chicken loco moco: 3/5. Chicken was nice and crispy. Mac and cheese was OK - like the standard mac and cheese salads that you can get in a cafeteria. -Corned beef tongue musubi: 1/5. Nothing special. Very bland. I think the spam musubi would've been better...-Pineapple upside down cake: 4.5/5. So gooooood! This is a must get! It would have been better if the ice cream flavors were more pronounced.",1,,
9,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,5.0,6/2/2018,"What a fantastic meal! We came here during winter Restaurant Week with a friend. I've had Noreetuh bookmarked for quite some time now so I had high expectations based on all the great reviews this place has gotten. And man did they deliver! For starters we tried the salmon and tuna poké as well as the octopus. Both types of poké were amazing so you really can't go wrong with either! For entrees we had the pork belly, mochi-crusted fish, and the kahlua pork cavatelli. My favorite was the pasta as it was a perfect fusion dish! I wish we also ordered the mentaiko spaghetti but I suppose that's reason to return.. For dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cake and another dish and wow, for a RW dinner, they do not skimp on the portions. We were so full after the entire meal! All in all, it was a terrific RW dinner and an awesome meal! The service was not stellar but given that it's RW, I'll cut them some slack. The food was 5 stars and I would be happy to come back again!",,,
10,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",19,338,213,3.0,4/4/2018,"I was looking forward to Noreetuh when it first opened and what was being reported as Hawaiian cuisine. Went with some friends for an early dinner when it was newly opened (back in 2015). While the menu seemed interesting, I felt that it was more Hawaiian-inspired rather than Hawaiian. I was a little bummed by this. The flavor of the dishes we ordered were good, although portions were on the small side. The decor had a modern feel and was very white. Service was good and friendly. While it was an okay meal, I haven't been back since. Maybe if I still lived in the neighborhood, maybe I'd go again as an ad hoc choice.",2,,
11,Giacomo C.,"New York, NY",1611,1206,2407,3.0,2/2/2018,"3.5 stars. Very cute (and dark) restaurant with two small dining areas great for an intimate date. They allow reservations. I came here with a friend for restaurant week ($42 per person). Salmon poke: delicious; a very balanced concoction of flavors. Get it. Tuna poke: not as good; the flavor of the tuna was overpowered by the sauce, and the tuna itself was flavorless. Pineapple pork belly: very good; small portion of pork belly, but skillfully prepared and beautifully presented. Bass: disappointing; the crispy fish was plain and boring... I wish we hadn't ordered it. King's Hawaiian bred pudding: very tasty (and bigger in size than the pork belly); if you love bread pudding, you should get this. Overall, although there were some issues with the other dishes, we enjoyed the salmon poke, the pork belly and the bread pudding. I was happy to pay $42 for the good dishes, but the others weren't worth that price.",8,,4
12,Shu Jin S.,"New York, NY",129,880,5,5.0,9/30/2018,"Spam musubi: I wish you could get a trio where they are all smaller, so you can truly sample a small bite of all three. We love, love, loved the born gold sake and managed to polish off an entire bottle (whoops), and my husband loved the mochi chicken wings app and he ordered the kalua pork pasta without cabbage (so so so good) and I got the mentaiki spaghetti with uni (also VERY good). The finale was truly the haupia sundae -- though I've never had haupia in that form before in Hawaii, but I did love the Coconut ice-cream.",,,
13,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,325,593,4.0,3/29/2018,"We went here for Winter restaurant week 2018 and the overall experience was worth a solid four stars. The restaurant is sort of an upscale take on Hawaiian food, with an vibe that is more 'fine fusion dining' than 'beaches and sunshine'. The interiors were done well in a warm, sort of abstract-art way and managed to pull off an elegant vibe for the small space they have to work with.Food here was quite good overall, and they made good use of restaurant week to highlight some of their signature dishes. For apps we had the octopus which was good but a tad chewy, and the salmon poke which was light, fresh and tasty! For mains we did the pork belly with pineapple which was tender and decadent, and the spam agnolotti which was a bit of a disappointment since the spam only lent saltiness to the dish and the truffle flavor was not as pronounced. Dessert was really good, we had the chocolate haupia sundae and the ube pie both of which were delicious.Our server was friendly but seemed a bit spaced out and did not do a great job in helping us pick the food. He was on hand when we needed him though so that was nice.",,,
14,Gee-Wey Y.,"New York, NY",29,28,28,5.0,6/25/2018,"You want brunch? You want flavors? You want an experience? You come here.I had heard about Noreetuh's legendary brunch over a year ago. ""They make it special - with the kind of love you experience for food when you're in Hawaii."" (Something like that.) And despite being put up against that introduction, the food ended up UNDER-hyped.I'm going to get all the names wrong of the items we ordered. Bear with me. You can't make a bad choice. Here are the ACTUAL reactions from my friends and me:1) Chicken moco: UMF.2) Short ribs: ARE YOU KIDDING ME.3) All the musubis: TRIPLE UMF.4) Pineapple brule: Too much food... so well balanced... good texture... can't stop myself...5) Juice: ooo must've been bottled straight from the nectar springs nestled deep in the forests of Hawaii.Taste: On a more serious note, the flavors were astounding. There was not anything I would not get again. I'm sorry that it's already been a week and I haven't gone back yet.Atmosphere: Friendly, quiet. Cute restroom. Nobody was getting wasted. If that's your goal for bunch, scramble some eggs at home and drink alcohol from a plastic bottle. Stay away from here.Service: Prompt, courteous, attentive. We were so well taken care of by the food that we didn't notice when the water magically refilled itself.Verdict: Will go again. Hold me back! Don't give me an excuse...",1,1,
15,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,5.0,2/26/2018,"I've been wanting to try Noreetuh for a while now and finally got a chance to.The service is some of the best I've seen in NYC, and trust me, I eat out a lot if you couldn't tell by my reviews. The staff was incredibly friendly, accommodating, and willing to give recommendations.I did the three course tasting menu with wine pairings and shared with someone else who did the same. All together, we tried the mochi crusted bass, grilled octopus, hearts of palm, monkfish liver, chicken wings, and mentaiko spaghetti with uni.Everything was great, but my favorites were the monkfish liver, hearts of palm, and grilled octopus. The wine pairings suited the dishes and tasted nice.They also have a very extensive by the bottle list that I need to come back to explore. I will be back for both that and to try the wagyu next time.Yes, it's a little on the expensive side.... but you get what you pay for, and Noreetuh is definitely worth it.",,,
16,June S.,"New York, NY",189,552,4070,4.0,10/3/2017,"This is a review of the even by Tasting Collective that we attended. It was a 9- course Nouveau Hawaiian Feast. Ever since this restaurant opened up in 2015, I have been wanting to try their food. They offer elevated Hawaiian cuisine, not authentic but original style. The interior was much more fun, with lots of Hawaii-inspired decorations. They had pictures of beach, waves, surfers, etc...  The restaurant looked really small, but then, I found out they have another room next door, connected at the back of the bar.Before the feast began, Executive Chef and Co-Owner, Chung Chow came out to greet everyone and told us a bit about himself and the restaurant. One fun fact about the restaurant is that the name, Noreetuh, is actually Korean, and it means ""playground."" He told us that he was originally planning to open up a Korean restaurant, but with many Korean restaurants opening up everywhere, he decided to change it to Hawaiian restaurant. The Korean name, Noreetuh, was kept unchanged since he liked it so much.At this event, I got to try Hearts of Palm & Peaches, Papaya & Chicory Salad, Tofu & Avocado Poke, Big-Eye Tuna Poke, Spicy Salmon Poke, Kalua Pork Cavatelli, Teriyaki Chicken, Ube Pie, and King's Hawaiian Bread Pudding.I really enjoyed all the food, it was interesting, tasty, and delicious. I am glad the chef Chow decided to open up this Hawaiian restaurant instead of ""another"" Korean restaurant. I would like to go back and try some of their regular menu in a near future!",3,,1
17,Tony Q.,"Manhattan, NY",100,83,162,2.0,8/11/2018,"Was super excited to try this place for restaurant week. Went with my sister and our other friend for an 8:30 reservation. We didn't get seated until 8:50. I ordered big eye tuna poke, grilled Hawaiian blue marlin, and pineapple upside down cake. The big eye tuna poke was the best thing I ate that night. The tuna was fresh and everything was super tasty. Great crunch for texture from the macadamia nuts. However the meal went quite downhill from there. There was a 30 minute wait to get our mains. The grilled Hawaiian blue marlin was interesting. It was a meaty fish but was rather bland and underwhelming. The bok choy was blackened and extremely acidic, not good. There was another 30 minute wait to get dessert. We were so bored. The pineapple upside down cake was super sweet, and I couldn't tell that the ice cream was coconut or pineapple at all, just tasted of vanilla. Maybe my palette was just overwhelmed after the acidic bok choy and the super sweet upside down cake that I couldn't taste anything. Ambiance wise it's trendy and candlelit dark, probably not bad for a date. But food was totally underwhelming and I'm rather disappointed",1,,
18,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,589,852,4.0,11/27/2017,"Hawaiian is something of a new comer in the city. With the popularity of Poke has brought some interest in the cuisine. It is something of a fusion of American with Japanese so fish and pineapple somehow goes well together or even Spam sushi. We figured it was worth a try to test something new during restaurant week. It would give us a taste of the cuisine and hopefully come back to try more of the menu.First off the pre-fixed list was to try their version of the Poke. It was quite good. The fresh fish, the pleasant acidity lends itself to the dish. It was a good start. Portions were a bit on the small side but what was on the plate was delicious.",,,
19,Natasha G.,"Sunnyside, NY",541,225,278,5.0,9/1/2017,"We came for restaurant week 2017, even though I've been meaning to come here for years -- my NYC restaurant bucket list never seems to get shorter! It's funny, because when Noreetuh opened, Hawaiian food was relatively unknown in NYC and pretty much impossible to find. Now, there's been an explosion of poke joints all over the city, so Noreetuh is now a veteran of Hawaiian cuisine in the tri-state area.Our meal here was delightful, because it's just the kind of food I like: balanced flavors, fresh ingredients, and creative combinations. Everything was inventive and full of flavor, and I only wish that the restaurant had a full bar because they'd be able to come up with some awesome cocktails.I had the big-eye tuna poke, mentaiko spaghetti, and the King's Hawaiian bread pudding (also nibbled on the bruléed pineapple. The spaghetti was surprising in its flavor combination, and reminded me a lot of a bottarga dish I've had at Italian restaurants -- the taste of bottarga is extremely similar to the ingredients in here. If you don't like strong, marine flavors and saltiness, I wouldn't order this -- but that kind of funky is right up my alley. The poke, needless to say, is done very well: the fish is firm and fresh, the seasoning is on point, and there's not too much distraction from the seafood.Desserts were good, and the pineapple was especially delicious, but I don't think I would have missed out on too much had I not tried them. Service was extremely friendly, the music was awesome, and this seemed like a great date restaurant. I'd come back for the poke, because they know what they're doing here!",4,,5
20,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",309,503,1365,4.0,8/15/2017,"Restaurant Week Summer 2017 is a success here, I'd say. Let me just preface by saying that I will always prefer a good ol' katsu box and spam musubi from L&L, but Noreetuh delivers in having more sophisticated hawaiian inspired dishes. Atmosphere: Clean, really small, love the touches of island decor.Food: My restaurant week choices were the salmon poke, the mentaiko spaghetti, and the chocolate haupia sundae. The salmon poke had such beautiful presentation, and the flavor was very satisfying and citrusy and the salmon was plentiful and fresh. The mentaiko spaghetti is filled with a creamy and smoky flavor, with bits of soft cod, and the spaghetti was cooked al dente and was very enjoyable. The portion looked small in the bowl but it was actually quite filling. The chocolate haupia dessert was just okay. I enjoyed the bits of chocolate coconut jelly but the ice cream was standard.My parents and boyfriend all got different things. The tuna poke was delicious and the pineapple upside down cake was really, REALLY sweet. I really liked the octopus appetizer, as it was tender and not too chewy. The chow noodles in my opinion were flavorful but they didn't give many noodles. The mochi crusted bass was good but the ingredient that made that dish was the fermented green beans. The pork belly tasted like adobo, so if you enjoy that flavor I'd definitely recommend it.Service: Friendly and attentive.I'd definitely recommend this place.",3,2,2
21,Jillian L.,"New York, NY",386,311,118,3.0,1/25/2018,"I so so wanted to love Noreetuh. The concept is great since NYC is seriously lacking in restaurants that specialize in Hawaiian food (aside from all the poke places). When we walked in, we were expecting laid-back island vibes, but we found a dimly-lit, intimate restaurant that would be great for date nights or a nice girls night out.The menu offers several Hawaiian inspired small plates, which is nice if you want to try a bit of everything, however, budget-wise it's not that friendly. All the dishes are around $20+, excluding snacks and desserts which are in the $10 range. I came for winter restaurant week, which was a good deal. Three dishes for $42 and all the dishes were from their actual menu. My friend and I ordered the following and shared. -Appetizer: Big-eye tuna poke & Salmon poke-Main: Mentaiko spaghetti & Mochi-crusted bass-Dessert: 2 orders of the bruleed Hawaiian pineappleOverall, the dishes were artfully crafted and tasty, but I can't get over the prices for the portion size. For restaurant week, it was definitely a good deal, as I would say you would need to order at least two dishes per person to feel full. I'm glad that I finally gave Noreetuh a try, but it's definitely on the bougier side of Hawaiian food. I guess the search for Hawaiian food continues...",3,2,2
22,Diane B.,"Harvard, MA",0,25,0,4.0,8/18/2018,"I have been going to Hawaii regularly for 40 years because my husband is from there and has family there. The food at Noreetuh is really good, but did not hit the very high spots that I was hoping for. The main issues are small portions for the price--for food and drinks both--and some inconsistencies in quality of food and presentation. Here goes:My husband loved the kalua pig pasta dish. The tastes were great, smoky, perfectly cooked pasta. But the small dollop in the middle of a huge bowl amplified how little food was in there. His appetizer, a standard pork katsu, was well-prepared, but not sliced for a chopstick user as would be standard, and presented in a very bland, uninspired fashion--just a pork steak on a plate with sauce dish, some cabbage, and chunk of lemon. At least put some garnish on it to give a nod to the traditions of Japan.I had the tuna poke which was really good, and then the opah. Now I knew the chef's preference was to prepare it rare, and I guess I learned I don't really like it that way (having had plenty of cooked opah in the past). Plus the kabocha squash which was supposed to accompany this dish was nowhere in sight. The bok choy with fermented black beans had a strong flavor, OK for me but perhaps too strong for most.Dessert was fine--haupia and bread pudding were nice, but hey, if you have had Ted's haupia pie from the North Shore of Oahu, and anything from a bakery in Hawaii, these two items did not particularly stand out. I am holding this restaurant to a high standard, Alan Wong and Roy Yamaguchi being my heroes. I yearn for something close to that experience on the East Coast. Noreetuh has that potential but is not there yet.A note about service: our server was affable enough, but he was so busy, he was not as attentive as one might expect for fine dining in NYC. So here's hoping Noreetuh can succeed and reach the heights it is capable of.",,,

Everything was incredible: service, food, ambience, decor.Soft shell crab tempura: ''tis the season so had to order this and glad I did because it was two thumbs up.Special musubi: it was a fish one I think cod? With ginger, tasted great but if you have to be a ginger fan to enjoy this one.Corn musubi: tasted good with the chipotle sauce that was in it. Reminds me of a corn salad I make which is my take on the Mexican corn (elote). Warning though it falls apart easily so a bit messy to eat.Mentaiko spaghetti: ughhhhhh I practically licked the plate even thought I was full after the apps. So good!!! The smoked cod in it was incredible. Staff is super friendly and chill, we didn't have a reso but opted to sit at the tiny two seater section of what looks like a bar and super glad we did because we met one of the owners and got to chat it up for a bit. I always love sitting at the bar to eat, fun times chatting w bartenders or in most cases other patrons (who def are more susceptible to convo vs table diners).Can't wait to go back and try some more dishes, ooooh yea that Hawaiian bread and pineapple ice cream dessert ughhhh I was ready to explode BEFORE that but ate it anyway.

They had a lot of variety of fish and meat. The tuna poke and the spice pork chop amazing. So was the octopus and cod fish. Omnibus was nice and relaxed with Hawaiian music playing in the background. I had the octopus as an appetizer and my bf had the tuna poke both were nice and tender. Then he had the spiced pork chop and i had the smoked cod spaghetti the pork was so juicy and flavorful and the cod was tender and not too much fish taste. For dessert had the bread pudding and the sundae. The texture for the bread pudding was a little off and the ice cream didn't really taste like pineapple but everything else was amazing. It was a unique experience. And would definitely go back. It's a must try.,,,

The chicken teriyaki entre was delicious topped with rhubarb (omgsogood) perfect .. only reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because the lighting was too dark but besides that it was a magnificent experience I'll be going again.",,,
27,Paul O.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,9,1,4.0,7/12/2018,"The food here was excellent. We shared a few things (swordfish, pasta dish(?), octopus) and were happy with the portions. The wine list and desert were also great with solid options. The only reason for the 4 stars was the restaurant itself. It was a bit too dark for my taste. The food was so rich and explosive it just didn't match the restaurant.",,,

The chicken had the perfect amount of breading and just enough delicious gravy to feel indulgent but not ridiculous. The kalua pork melted in my mouth and wasn't overly salty like I've found other places. The service was great - prompt drink refills, helpful advice, friendly banter. One California transplant provided helpful tips on Cal alum hangouts for my dining companion, who is also an alum. There are usb and regular outlets all over the place so you can charge your phone while you wait. They import pineapples from Hawaii twice a week - I hope to try one next time I visit!",2,,1
30,Will V.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,257,84,5.0,9/30/2017,"A terrific three course prix fixe meal, service, and atmosphere in the East Village. Hawai'ian inspired food and decor with friendly service like you would find in the islands, too. We were steered well from the start with a nice dry rosé from the Basque region of Spain. My opening course, called a ""snack"" here, was kabocha squash tempura, which was yummy and not too dry or crispy like tempura often is, and a nice portion, too, more than a snack. Then the ""appetizer"" of spicy salmon poke, also good with little additions to make for a more interesting blend of flavors. The main dish was excellent: tagliatelle with heirloom tomato sauce. The pasta was well prepared and portioned, the heirloom tomatoes were fantastic in flavor, and the Kauai shrimp were large, mostly in shell, and really juicy.My friend had the pork potstickers to start (good), grilled octopus (really good), and the pork belly entree with pineapple grilled underneath (a winner with two mini-bricks of pork belly). We really didn't have room for dessert, but took a leap and were rewarded with an awesome chocolate haupia sunday - a massive, you have to share it portion - and my fave, a half pineapple presented in dramatic fashion and served brûlée style. Juicy, sweet perfection.",2,,2

I had truly a phenomenal dinner at Nooretuh and I definitely will be back. The food was exquisite. One of the best meals in the city. The pork belly literally melted in my mouth.

35,Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,278,9021,5.0,2/12/2017,"We came to Noreetuh the most recent time which was the other day during Restaurant Week. I am basing my review on the most recent as well as the last 2 previous visits that were made to this restaurant. Noreetuh is a nice cute and quaint eatery and all of the staff are always absolutely fantastic. There are times when we have had to wait to be seated since it was busy however the host/hostess tries their best to seat you as soon as possible. The place is beautifully lit with a cool bar. The last time I visited it was just for dessert but 2 out of three times it was during Restaurant Week. We have had the pleasure of enjoying their $42 Three Course meal restaurant week special which consists of an appetizer, entree and dessert. Noreetuh's Pork Croquettes that I have as an appetizer, their spaghetti I had previously and their Chow Noodles w/ Steak that I had as an entree recently and their Hawaiian Bread Pudding w/ Pineapple Flavored Ice Cream that I always have for dessert are prepared well as taste spectacular! Great music is played in the background and the staff are accommodating. Noreetuh is a cool restaurant with wonderful ambiance.",5,2,3

The pastas and steak were cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Actually, definitely get the steak! The fried mushrooms were also good. Skip the taro chips, galbi, and ube pie. The bread pudding wasn't bad though.",,,
39,Karen C.,"New York, NY",224,65,317,5.0,2/14/2017,"Absolutely loved our experience! Food was great, service was kind and attentive, atmosphere was nice and cozy.We went for the Restaurant week 2017 menu of starter/main/dessert - note that they have a regular prix fixe menu at $42 for dinner even when it's not during the official RW time, the only difference is that instead of dessert you have a choice of snacks to start.For starters, we shared the silken tofu (Santa Barbara uni, ikura, shiso) and the big eye tuna poke (macadamia nut, pickled jalapeño, seaweed). We mentioned to our server that my partner is allergic to nuts and shellfish and they were able to accommodate with the nuts on the side. The tuna poke was the standout because of how fresh and perfectly marinaded it was. The pickled jalapeño was unique and I liked that they used different colored (NATURAL looking) seaweed. None of that bright green seaweed salad you get at many sushi/poke places. It was a beautiful dish, too bad we were in the dark! The tofu was good but not $22 for a la carte good! For the main, I got the mentaiko spaghetti with smoked cod, aonori (dried seaweed flakes), and chili. LOVED and DEVOURED this dish. I normally get pretty sick of creamy sauce pasta very quickly but every bite was amazing. Decent amount of smoked cod, the mentaiko and aonori added great texture, and the pasta was cooked al dente. There was the option to add uni for $8, which I didn't because I figured we already had uni in our silken tofu. Plus, I don't think it would have really elevated the dish because uni actually has a pretty subtle taste and is best enjoyed on its own (like in sushi).My boyfriend'a Mochi crusted bass with pole bean, Chinese bacon, and fermented black bean was alright in my opinion, but maybe that's because I don't like anything breaded (and I liked my main too much to pay much attention to his). His fish was a little on the smaller side when we compared to other people around us getting the same thing, but we did leave full so that's not really a problem! Mochi sounds cool but we didn't see a difference between what was on the fish and normal panko. The fish by itself is pretty bland while the sauce the beans were sautéed in was pretty salty, so you have to eat them together. For dessert, I got the brûléed pineapple with lime zest and alea salt. I loved it because pineapple is my favorite fruit and it satisfied all my dessert cravings. The salt was a nice touch. A pretty delicious dish but probably not worth to pay a la carte - it is just fancy fruit after all. My boyfriend got the chocolate haupia sundae with almonds (on the side), graham crackers, and coconut ice cream. Drizzled with caramel sauce. We loved it! And he normally doesn't like coconut flavored things! The chocolate haupia is the gelatinous/mousse-like chocolate cubes. They could go less heavy on the whipped cream though - the ice cream is the star. Let it shine!!Lovely experience at noreetuh, perfect for a valentines date, which was our occasion :)",4,,

The service was fantastic (our server was very attentive and friendly, giving us recommendations of popular dishes), and so was our food! We opted for the big-eye tuna poke bowl and the loco moco chicken. The tuna was very fresh, and the rice was well-seasoned. I also really liked the macadamia nuts and kimchi in the poke bowl, adding a good crunch and pop of flavor! Our fried chicken was cooked very well such that it retained its moisture, and it came with some kimchi, rice + gravy, macaroni salad, and two fried eggs -- perfect for sharing!How likely would I be to recommend to a friend/family? 7-8",1,,
41,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,146,0,4.0,8/25/2017,"To preface, my review is based-off the Restaurant Week menu. My friends and I came in here after having this place on our list for a while. We were seated right away and ordered drinks to start us off. One of my friends was a bit late, so we ordered a round of pot stickers to keep us happy while we waited. In terms of the menu, I got the salmon poke, tagliatelle, and bread pudding. I loved every minute of the food. It was all tasty and unique. For my first Hawaiian inspired experience, I was very pleased!Ambience is cute inside. It's a small spot, so it can feel like you're on top of everyone around you. We were seated by the window though, so we had a little more space than others. Our waiter was awesome. He was super friendly and attentive, as was everyone else who came around with water and the food. We were also never rushed to leave or pay by anyone!Overall, I loved my experience at Noreetuh. I'm looking forward to bringing more people here to enjoy the food and scene as much as I did!",2,,
42,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,422,1424,4.0,8/16/2017,"4.5 stars. I stopped by Noreetuh for NYC Restaurant Week and the food was excellent! At first, I thought the portion sizes were small (especially given the prices of their regular menu), but I was happily satisfied and beyond full by the end of the meal. Between me and my boyfriend we ordered:-Big-eye tuna poke - soy sauce and sesame oil based poke with tuna, seaweed, and macadamia nuts-Salmon poke - salmon tossed in mildly spicy mayo with radish, cucumber, and greens. I liked this better than the tuna poke.-Mentaiko spaghetti - creamy pasta dish filled with cod roe and a few chunks of fish. It had a tad bit more lemon juice/citrus flavor than expected, but was still very appetizing. -Pineapple braised pork belly - a fatty slab of pork belly that practically melts in your mouth. Delicious! The bits of spatzle on the bottom also helped balance out the heavy oils, making it a great combo. -Chocolate huapia sundae - standard ice cream sundae with nice textures of graham crackers, almond slices, and chocolate jellies.-King's Hawaiian bread pudding - warm and sweet bread pudding paired with cold and creamy pineapple ice cream...this was like a match made in heaven!! Definitely my favorite of the night.This restaurant is clean, modern, and trendy, and the service was friendly and helpful. Overall a pleasant dining experience - musubi is on my list for next time!",1,1,2

44,Lucy N.,"New York, NY",705,314,3770,3.0,1/7/2017,"I was really excited to try this place because of it's impressive pedigree of former Per Se chefs. Unfortunately I wasn't all that impressed.We opted for the 2 sets of the 3 course prix fixe ($42/pp) where you pick dishes off of a shortened menu. [FOOD]Truffle Taro Chips - I love taro and truffle so naturally I enjoyed these but they were overly salty. Most of the truffle shavings were stuck to the chips on top so the bottom ones didn't get any of the love. I wouldn't order these a la carte given the hefty price ($12). Honestly they should just nix the truffle and reduce the price significantly.Corned Beef Tongue Musubi - This was an interesting take, but I personally prefer the traditional spam musubi. Also, the cilantro sauce was pretty flavorless. Again, I tasted mostly saltiness.Grilled Octopus - Great char on the octopus. It came with fingerling potatoes that were coated with tobiko mayo. Delicious!Monkfish Liver Torchon - This was delicious! It comes with slices of grilled hawaiian bread. My only issue was that that monkfish liver was pretty solid so it wasn't actually spreadable on the bread.Mochi-crusted Bass - This was the star of the meal hands down. I didn't know what to expect from ""mochi-crusted"" but it turned out to be similar to a panko-coating around the fish. The green beans were also perfectly crunchy and delicious. The Chinese bacon, however, was too salty so it was the only thing we left on the plate.  Mentaiko spaghetti - Usually this dish is made with cod roe, but here they added actual salted cod which made it so much more flavorful. This was the only dish we weren't able to finish because we wanted to leave room for dessert. I microwaved the leftovers the next day and I swear it tasted even better the second time.King's hawaiian bread pudding ($8) - The outside was crispy and delicious but the inside was too soft and borderline mushy. The pineapple ice cream was delicious and I wish it was a larger scoop. The raisins were too strong in rum flavor for my taste. [TIP]To get the most bang for your buck, I highly recommend going with the 3 course dinner option. We saved $19 between the two of us by not ordering a la carte, and still got to try everything we wanted from the main menu. It comes with a lot of food so we were both pretty full before we even got to the main course dishes.",6,2,3
45,Margaret Z.,"Manhattan, NY",269,745,79,4.0,8/20/2017,"Came here for Restaurant Week and had high expectations since both friends and co-workers raved about their experience here.  The meal didn't disappoint but also didn't really leave me wanting to come back again and again... We started with the grilled octopus and big-eye tuna poke appetizers. Also ordered an additional side of the mushroom tempura. The grilled octopus was prepared perfectly and the tuna poke was super fresh. The mushroom tempura, while tasty, had way too much batter. It mostly tasted like we were eating fried dough. For our entrees, I ordered the kahlua pork cavatelli and fiancé got the mochi crusted bass. He really enjoyed the fish dish, especially the fermented black bean sauce. Portion sizes were okay - definitely enough when ordered as part of a three-course prix-fixe but some might be left hungry without an app + dessert supplement. My cavatelli pasta was good but just a bit too salty. The star of the meal was definitely the upside-down pineapple cake. My fiancé and I agreed that we would come back just to eat this dessert - the cake was warm and moist, not too sweet, and perfectly paired with cherry, pineapple, and coconut ice creams. The ambiance is nice here and great for both groups and intimate dates. Our server left us wanting a bit more as he came off rather cold/uninviting, but it was a busy night so perhaps that can be forgiven. Noreetuh is definitely a unique spot worth trying!",1,,1
46,Monte H.,"Cupertino, CA",430,332,189,5.0,8/12/2017,"The casual island decor makes for a fun relaxed ambiance, but the food is really sophisticated. Not that it wears a top hat and speaks in a British accent, but that the kitchen really knows how to combine lots of different flavors and textures into a single dish. The tuna poke is one of the best I've ever tried, and the salmon poke and octopus apps were good too. The bass main dish was extremely flaky/crispy and I would pay good money for that black bean sauce in a jar. Jin and team are incredibly friendly, and will give great suggestions for wine too.

48,Nancy N.,"New York, NY",347,150,355,5.0,1/10/2017,"Long waited review. We came here to celebrate Valentine's Day in 2016 when they just opened their door. It was amazing and exceeded my expectation. We wanted something different so the Hawaiian concept was something fresh for both of us. The space was very cute and the service was great despite the new team. The menu was very thoughtful and came with wine pairing that we really enjoyed. The highlight was the lobster salad and uni mentaiko spaghetti. My boyfriend is not a seafood eater but he was adventurous enough to try these two dishes (he had to opt out of the fluke sashimi, which I devoured both servings. Loved the tartness of the passionfruit, very refreshing). It was his first time eating lobster (I know! I can't believe it either) and mentaiko and he absolutely loved it. He still won't eat lobster elsewhere, worrying it will ruin his experience. He did offer his uni on the pasta to me and I did not refuse (more for me!)  However, I did not tell him what mentaiko was before he eat the pasta and he is a huge fan of pasta so half way through I told him about the fish roe and he was still ok with it because it was so tasty.  Because of that, noreetuh will always hold a special place in our hearts!",2,1,2

The croquettes were probably better despite my love for poke.Entree- I ordered the Steak and tried the Cavatelli. Basil pesto on the steak was a nice touch, and the side salad was nothing to touch on. The Cavatelli was really brothy, and preferred this entree over the steak.Dessert- coconut sundae- not heavy on the coconut flavor but a nice way to end the meal.All and all, for my average feelings on the food, the restaurant week price tag was higher than I would have felt was worth it.

A generous ring of sweet pineapple on top of a warm moist cake served with pineapple and cherry ice cream. I could eat this everyday! My only complaint was the ratio of ice cream to cake; if only there was more cake!Back to main courses: the tuna poke app tasted authentic albeit a little too salty. I got the kalua pork cavatelli entree which was a very interesting fusion of Hawaiian and Italian fare. The pickled cabbage added a bit of a sour note while the Parmesan elevated the umami already brought to the dish by the pork. I would definitely return to try other items on their menu.,,,

54,Margot G.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/3/2018,"A fresh take on Hawaiian food tucked away in the East Village. We came here for Restaurant Week - three courses for $42. AppsWe came for poke and were not disappointed. The very fresh big-eye tuna poke, marinated in soy sauce and macadamia oil, made for a light and fresh start to the meal. We also got the grilled octopus, which is some of the best cook on a tentacle I've ever had. Perfectly tender with an acidic salad to complement it. MainsThe pineapple-glazed pork belly melted in my mouth and went perfectly with the pillowy spaetzle and greens. But the star of the show was the pork cavatelli, an initially nonsensical dish of braised pork, pickled cabbage, and handmade pasta that made a perfect marriage when I tasted it. DessertWe had the chocolate haupia sundae and the King's Hawaiian bread pudding. Both were delicious, but we were pretty full at this point, so we didn't get to dive in as much as we wanted to. Next time, I'll try the pineapple upside down cake.Takeaways- There's a surprising amount of Italian influence in their food, which struck me as odd at first, but it all makes sense in your mouth.- I can't quite nail the vibe of this place. The back room is dark and romantic, but it's also got some beachy, casual elements. - I would definitely come back here for Restaurant Week, but their normal prices are definitely toward the high end of my budget. - They have an extraordinary wine list that I'd love to dive into during the rest of the year.",1,,
55,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,5.0,11/23/2016,"Came here for restaurant week some time back and the experience was just excellent. First of all, it was a challenge to secure a reservation at a decent time, but I kept checking and managed to get a slot for 8:30. The place was packed when we got there, and I was worried we were gonna get cramped into a tight table, but we got led back into a separate room where we got a quiet table away from the noise.The restaurant week menu is one of the better ones out there, with a decent number of options. I got the Hawaiian heart of palm salad, the Mentaiko spaghetti, and a fruit and mochi dessert I forgot the name of. Everything was delicious. Loved the combination of the hearts of palm with the toasted hazelnuts. The spaghetti with smoked cod was crazy flavorful and I couldn't get enough of it. The dessert was also delicious.Service was impeccable and we enjoyed everything. The only complaint I would say is that there is only one bathroom for the entire restaurant and it was a bit of a wait. But otherwise I'd happily recommend this place and go back.",3,1,3
56,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",408,238,30,5.0,6/18/2017,"Noreetuh is easily one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.Hawaiian food has burst onto the scene in the city because of the poke craze, but among the top 10 Yelp results for Hawaiian food, Noreetuh is the only one that is not a primarily poke restaurant. I knew I had to try it out, and after over a year of discovering it I finally went for dinner.First off the service was incredible! Our server Maria took great care of us from start to finish, including suggesting the prix fixe menu to save a few dollars and share more plates and making sure our water glasses were never less than half full. It also happened that my friend knew the owner, which helped us land a complimentary dessert and dessert wines.On to the food! Starting with snacks, we got the pork jowl musubi and mochiko chicken wings - both were stellar. The musubi was the perfect temperature and incredibly succulent so that the rice would soak up the juices. The chicken wings were surprisingly bright thanks to the incorporation of both calamansi and chili to balance the spice with some citrus.For starters we ordered the monkfish liver torchon and soft-shell crab tempura. The torchon is immediately up there with one of the best single dishes I have ever had. The liver, spread over a perfect warm buttered piece of king's Hawaiian bread, exploded with umami, quite literally tasting like a piece of the best Hokkaido uni. It is unquestionably one of my favorite two or three dishes of all time. Not to be outdone, the crab was wonderfully presented and even better prepared, crunchy to the core.Mains were next, and we had the spam agnolotti and the pineapple braised pork belly. Now, I have had my fair share of pork belly over the years, and this one was up there with the best of them. If only I could have pineapple with every meal.... Meanwhile the spam was fried to a crisp, almost like bacon, while the agnolotti were fairly traditional and very filling. The dish was probably the only one on the night that didn't quite work as the fiddlehead ferns in the agnolotti were an interesting choice, but still a solid dish.Somehow we left room for dessert, and the chocolate haupia sundae was wondrous - the perfect mix of sweet (graham crackers, coconut ice cream, and whipped cream) and salty (almonds). On the other hand, the crispy mochi waffles was very cool visually and conceptually, but probably a tad bit heavy after such a great meal.It probably comes as no surprise if you've read this far that I loved Noreetuh (as did my lovely friend). With a star-studded menu, extensive wine list, and flawless service, Noreetuh is still a hidden gem tucked away on First Avenue just off of bustling St. Mark's. With food this good, I have a feeling this little secret won't be such a secret for long.",2,,

For one palate-satisfying and happily belly-rubbing experience, I would say choose the tuna poke, pork cavatelli pasta, and chocolate haupia. Trust me, it was hard to pick these three to suggest to the public because everything is equally as delicious but nothing screams Hawaii more than tuna poke, kalua pork, and haupia! Noreetuh, don't you dare change. I mean it. MAHALO!!",,,

Updated review","We came in on Mother's Day for a Hawaiian brunch since we all love Hawaiian food and it's been a few years since we've been to Hawaii. They were doing a Mother's Day Brunch Special - any entree plus a cocktail for $20, which was a pretty good deal. I had the BBQ short ribs that comes with mac salad, rice, and kimchi. It also came with two sunny-side up eggs, which was great with the rice. The portion size was really big and I was super full when I finished it all. We also had their Hawaiian Breakfast and Big-Eye Tuna Poke Bowl and both were really good as well. All the portions were really big and I think we were all very full when we finished. Not full enough, however, to have their Bruleed Pineapple! I really enjoyed it because it was sweet and a bit salty at the same time. I also had their POG mimosa, which was refreshing and sweet.",3,1,2

Out of all these fads derived from the culture of na kanaka maoli, this is the closest place to Hawaiian influence that I've seen. I don't feel like this place just turned the Hawaiian culture into another fad to profit from, but even though it's not exactly Hawaiian food, it has a great fusion of what real Hawaii food is... like musubi...",,,

61,Dulce Q.,"Manhattan, NY",13,88,22,4.0,2/4/2018,We went to this restaurant for Restaurant Week.  The food was really good.  The service was great they were very attentive. The restaurant had a good vibe. The only bad side was it was really cold inside the restaurant. The owner put on the space heater on for us but it didn't do much.  The food composited for the temperature.  I will definitely go back.,,,

(I think his name is Nate, I'm sorry I don't know it) but we have the same server every time and he is THE BEST. He's so nice and attentive. Their Luau feast is the best thing you can eat for brunch. At least two people have to order it though, so don't go alone. Their spam rolls are some of the best things I've ever had and their poke is always so freaking fresh. Also, the flamed pineapple for dessert is revolutionary. I love you, noreetuh. Never leave me.",1,,
63,Alexandra O.,"Venice, CA",468,14,10,5.0,6/6/2017,"In short: One of the best dinners I've had in a really, really long time - incredible! What we ate: We started with the big-eye tuna poke (which the chef prepares with macadamia nuts, jalapeño, and seaweed), as well as the seasonal soft-shell crab tempura with soy-pickled ramps (incredible). For our entrees, we had the mentaiko spaghetti with aonori, smoked cod, and chili;the pineapple braised pork belly; and the wagyu beef with Chinese broccoli and fried rice. Honestly, all 3 of us agreed it was impossible to pick a favorite dish. Dessert was also pretty fabulous: the upside down pineapple cake (a special) and the mochi waffles with peanut butter. The one area I feel could be improved is the ambience. The wooden honeycomb design elements are lovely, but aside from that, it feels a little cold - which is a disservice to the magic of the restaurant's food, friendly service, and Aloha heritage. That said, it is definitely only a minor note, and might even be addressed by some simple floral arrangements. The bathroom sign, however, is awesome (see photo). Overall, a must-go! We are already planning our next visit.",1,,

But to summarize, we didn't like the food here. 6 of the 9 dishes we had were just unsuccessful... I'm not saying ""average""- I'm saying ""not good"". Expensive food, small portions, in a tight space with service that's a little too efficient and impersonal. Huge disappointment...",5,2,1

All of the wine pairings complimented the flavors perfectly and they even served more than one glass per tasting which was amazing!!

No wait, which is always nice. :P They open at 12pm, but they serve brunch! FOOD: Spam Musubi- spam, rice, teriyaki sauce wrapped in seaweed you think that you can make this at home but somehow it tastes better here. It came with some refreshing light pickles, sesame seeds included. Mochiko LOCO MOCO This is what I came for!! and it succeeded my expectations. Crispy Chicken was softened with the smooth and deep flavor of the gravy. It came with -two balls of rice topped with furikake (seaweed seasoning), -two aesthetically-pleasing sunny side up eggs, speckled with pepper-mayonaise induced macaroni pasta salad, it's sweet and works well with the fried chicken-a side of kimchi, a nice break from the heavier, heartier parts of the meal. My friend got Spam and sausage instead of the loco moco. She enjoyed her food as well. Complimentary black sesame shortbread cookies! Food Presentation on point! Big portions! Ambiance is clean, classic, and enjoyable. The staff was nice and always kept our waters filled. Hoping to come back to try more things on the menu.",3,,2
67,Crystal Y.,"Flushing, NY",194,425,858,3.0,8/22/2016,"Went for RW and wasn't completely blown away. I confess I walked in with high expectations due to the various recommendations and praises on yelp.I started with the supplemental appetizer of silken tofu with uni, salmon roe and shiitake on tofu. It came with 3 pieces of uni, which was surprisingly a lot but the taste was not strong. I was quite disappointed at it because from the looks of it, it couldn't been a lot more tastier. I tried the big-eye tuna poke, which was ok. I had the mochi-crusted bass upon the recommendation of the waiter. I thought it was average at best. As my friend would say, I could've made it at home. I had the chocolate haupia sundae, which was pretty good. I was told the bread pudding and the bruleed hawaiian pineapple was just an ok. No one commented on how good (or bad) the drinks were so I am gonig to assume they were just ok.All in all, disappointed due to the expectation. Maybe the regular menu has more to offer.",1,1,1
68,Gabriela R.,"Forest Hills, NY",2,24,25,4.0,1/7/2018,"Dined with a friend at Noreetuh on a Saturday night. Had a lovely dinner and it was super fun to try a cuisine I don't typically eat. We made reservations ahead of time, which seemed like a good idea as the restaurant is quite small inside.We started with the silken tofu, tuna poke,  and spam agnolotti. All three were fresh, creative, and delicious. We were still hungry and ordered the monkfish liver torchon. I was not crazy about this dish as parts were a bit fishy for my taste, but it was nice to fill up on the toasted Hawaiian roll slices that accompany the liver. Our server also recommended an excellent unfiltered sake. The menu does seem a little overpriced to me, which may have been because I read about how reasonably priced the restaurant was, but that is the only place the restaurant loses a start for me. That being said, our server did give us a bruleed pineapple for dessert on the house, we suspect because we were seated next to a noisy birthday party.On that note, the service was excellent - extremely friendly, gave great suggestions, and very prompt with sake refills. The ambience of the restaurant was also lovely - I think it would have been a good noise level if not for the birthday party, and I liked that there were two sections. Whatever air freshener the bathroom had was amazing.",,,
69,Jeff O.,"Manhattan, NY",266,278,671,3.0,8/27/2016,Menu's a bit hit or miss. Beef tongue musubi and butterfish spaghetti are fantastic. Fluke crudo is fine. Spam agnolotti and hearts of palm are far too bland and one-note.There's clearly skill in the kitchen but some dishes need fine-tuning to make Noreetuh a destination.,1,,

72,Samson L.,"Middlesex County, NJ",786,460,3946,4.0,5/2/2016,"This restaurant serves up modern Hawaiian fare in  a hip setting with subtle Hawaiian theme through out the restaurant. It's amazing how many tables they can pack into this small space! There's a bar area with seating and tables  adjacent to it.  In the next room over is a narrow corridor of tables for 2 and 2  or three larger tables for larger parties.  You are literally able to rub elbows with another party when sitting in this room! Our waitress was very nice.  She was helpful without being too intrusive. The menu is divided into 4 main sections: Snacks, Starters , Main, and Dessert. There is a 3 course Prix Fixe Menu daily for Dinner for $42.  You actually can save some money doing so if you are going to order many dishes anyway.  The portions are smallish,  so you won't over do it.  My wife and I ordered 2 -  3 course prefix plus another app. We are such pigs! We ordered corned cow tongue musubi,  truffle taro chips,  mochico chicken wings,  grilled octopus,  big eye tuna poke,  mochi crusted black bass,  and pineapple braised black bass. If  we come back,  we would definitely get the taro chips,  tuna poke,  pineapple pork belly.  They were all a hit! The other dishes were good not great.  The cow tongue musubi was good but I don't think i enjoy the macadamia nut crunch texture in it,  and I couldn't taste the cilantro sauce.  The mochico chicken wings had a good crispy outside but the citrusy glaze made it too messy to eat.  I've been to Hawaii and mochico chicken usually is dry.  The flavor was good but I didn't taste the chili. We didn't even get any wings on this dish! The grilled octopus was ok but texture was chewy.  I tried my wife's black bass  was cooked perfect but was a little bland. I'm glad i tried Noreetuh,  but like another reviewer noted,  was not totally blown away but definitely a great place to have dinner and drinks. My wife and I enjoyed the dinner.  It's a nice atmosphere with a good wine and beer selection,  even sake.",2,2,2

(The owner was told  ""this is the best pork chop I have ever had"").   Bread pudding and pineapple upside down cake desserts were divine.  The owner recommended a dry white and a fabulous dessert wine from their ample wine list!   We hope to get back here again soon!",,,

76,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,4.0,1/9/2017,"Solid restaurant week experience. We made a reservation online for 9PM because they were all out of earlier slots on OpenTable, but we decided to walk-in an hour early (because let's be real, 9PM is way too close to bed time) and they were able to seat us. They were actually surprisingly empty for a restaurant week evening! The restaurant week menu was impressive - and the main reason why I chose this restaurant in the first place. I had the tuna poke (of course) for my appetizer, the angus steak for my entree, and the bruleed pineapple for dessert. My friend ordered the silken tofu, mochi-crusted bass, and the bread pudding. Everything was delicious! True to restaurant week fashion, all of the servings are sample-sized (definitely on the smaller end), so you should expect to snack before or grab a fourth-meal after. However, I did appreciate that everything was very thoughtfully prepared and presented.Of everything we ordered, the angus steak was probably the stand-out dish for the night. My friend was actually quite disappointed that he had ordered the bass instead of the steak, but we had decided to order different items so that we could sample more of the menu. I also found the tuna poke to be very fresh and nicely marinated, but was slightly disappointed with the silken tofu appetizer because of the tiny portions and the fact that it was literally tofu in a bowl sprinkled with some roe. Overall, I think I was most disappointed with my dessert, which was literally a fourth of a pineapple that had been torched. It didn't even make for great pictures because it was so dark in the restaurant! I don't know if Noreetuh is a restaurant that I would highly recommend to friends or family, but it is a nice East Village establishment that could easily impress a date or help celebrate an accomplishment. I'm definitely glad that I got to try it during restaurant week!",4,2,4
77,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",529,222,1305,4.0,3/12/2016,"Cuisine: 7Service: 8Decor: 7Value: 6Overall: 7Hawaiian food gone upscale with higher quality ingredients, fancier techniques, and sexier presentations. Our group of four shared everything and agreed almost 100% on all the dishes.  Most of the meal were hits, but there were a few major misses as well.  Here is a full breakdown.Truffle Taro Chips - 8/10.  Light, super crispy & delicious.  Truffle flavor is present but not overwhelming.Crispy Mushrooms - 7/10. Fried perfectly, but lacked a certain mushroom flavor.  Good but not a wow.Corn Beef Tongue Musubi - 9/10. Amazing flavors. Rice was great. Tongue was crazy tender. Cilantro sauce was harmonious. Seaweed could have been crispier.Silken Tofu - 7/10 Maine Uni was bitter and the miso was a bit overpowering. However, the tofu itself was sublime, along with the equally fantastic slightly slaty ikura.Monkfish Liver Torchon - 4/10 Passion Fruit overpowers the creamy liver.  Yet if you like desserts before your entree, you may enjoy this a lot.  The King bread was excellent.Big-Eye Tuna Poke - 7/10 The tuna itself was a bit bland, but the accompaniments were just right.  Though quite good, it is not of the quality of poke I had in Hawaii.Hawaiian Hearts of Palm - 5/10 Served in slices, but I prefer my hearts of palm whole in order to taste the tenderness when I bite into the center. Sauce was great, need more.Kalua Pig Croquettes - 9/10 Awesome!  You can really taste the tender and flavorful shredded pork among the creamy potato, nestled inside a crispy shell.Sea Urchin Tagliatelle 1/10 Honestly, I hate to rate anything (especially w/ uni) this low, but I had to on this dish.  Simply put, way too much parmesan.Pineapple Braised Pork Belly - 9/10 Holy crap! Talk about fork tender and absolutely yummy. Well, this is it. Not 10/10 because their wasn't much pineapple flavor.Garlic Shrimp Over Rice - 8/10 One of my favorite things in Hawaii to eat.  This super garlicky version is just as good as some of the best I had on the islands.Mentaiko Spaghetti - 8/10 First word to describe this pasta is smoky.  Spaghetti was a bit past al dente but still pretty good. The butterfish was yummy.Grilled Pineapple Brûlée - 10/10 Only problem with this dessert was that we all wanted more.  Sweet and salty.  Perfect.Adzuki Bean & Coconut Tapioca - 6/10 Great concept where the orange ice cream was just slight misplaced imo. I would have preferred a flavor with less zest.Crispy Mochi Waffle - 5/10 Sounds so cool, but lacked execution.  The mochi waffle was not crispy enough, though the whipped peanut butter was delicious.The decor was quite modern and the service was very good.  My glass was always full with water and our server had a smile every time he walked by.  There are still other interesting items on the menu I would like to try.  With a lack of good Hawaiian cuisine in NYC, I will be returning.",4,,
78,Nick T.,"Manhattan, NY",212,75,14,4.0,2/1/2017,"An elegant take on a down-to-earth cuisine. Surprisingly little spam on the menu, but not a worry.I had the monkfish liver torchon to start. It comes with pear, cilantro, and passionfruit garnish. It kinda looks and tastes like space food, but I guess that happens when you take a bottom dwelling fish and make foie gras out of it.For my main I got the mentaiko spaghetti. This has smoked cod, aonori (green seaweed flakes), and chili. It was fabulous.I had the adzuki bean and coconut tapioca desert. Loved it.

They give u a healthy variety of dishes with more than 3 choices per course (so much better than the average RW place and I GREATLY appreciate that) Appetizer: salmon poke was spicy with notably fresh fish. Grilled octopus was perfectly moist and complimented by pickled radish for a salty tangy combo. Highly recommended both Entree: pork belly MELTED IN MY MOUTH the silkiest fat I have ever had. Like butter absolutely incredible. And the steak entree cooked perfectly at medium rare but smaller portion than I would hope.  Both a MUST TRY. Dessert: coconut sundae was okay but the graham cracker made it sensational. So the reason this rating is 4.5 instead of 5 is because of the SERVICE of one guy who was total shit. He was so rude and snobby. His attitude was mentionably off putting. But I will say every other server made a great effort to accommodate our table and one even gave a comp'd glass of wine for my friend. Overall, I would highly highly recommend this place for restaurant week. And I will be coming back.",1,,1

It was more on the romantic side..Service - The waiters were very attentive.Appetizer - Silken Tofu, Uni, Ikura, Mushroom, Shiso ($12)This was full of many different flavors. The tofu was really soft. I personally wasn't a fan of it, but that's because there was too much going on for me. I'm glad I tried it though. Entree - Mentaiko spaghetti ($22) This was simply amazing. There was so much flavor in the spaghetti. I've never had pasta like this before. The waiter said it was the most popular dish, so I had to try it. The pasta had smoked butterfish pieces in it topped with crunchy..seaweed, and .. just wow. I would go back to the restaurant just to get this again. I was honestly so sad to have to share this dish with my friend. I wanted it all to myself!!!Dessert - Bruleed pineapple ($10)I'm not going to lie..I thought this was going to be a pineapple-flavored creme brulee LOL. So, I was very surprised to see that it was just a pineapple. Nonetheless, it was still very yummy. They toast the top of the pineapple, so you're eating chilled and toasted pieces at the same time. The pineapple pieces are lightly salted as well. That was a nice touch. I will definitely try putting salt on my pineapple in the future, although I'm not so sure if that's all it takes.The total bill came out to about $50 for 2 people. Not tooooooooo shabby. I want to come back to try the pork belly.",4,2,3

83,Tanisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",234,184,192,3.0,3/1/2018,"Checked out Noreetuh last night after stumbling upon it about a month ago while making restaurant week reservations.  I was excited to try it based on the reviews and the menu offerings.  We opted for the 3-course menu with wine pairings.  My first selection was the Berkshire Pork Potstickers -- tasty, but nothing special.  Next, I had the Spicy Salmon Poke.  I had no idea that it would be slathered with a non-dairy mayo until our waiter began describing the rationale for the wine pairing selection before the dish arrived.  It was simply too much mayo.  Our waiter was gracious enough to offer me an alternate selection after noticing I had only a few bites.  I instead had the Hawaiian Garlic Shrimpt, which was solid.  For my main, I had the Kalua Pork Cavatelli.  I am a deep lover of pasta and pork.  Perhaps it was the cabbage or the way the pork was seasoned, but the taste was simply odd and after taking a few bites, I was done.  Our waiter expressed concern (again) over my apparent dissatisfaction with the course.  At that point, I was resigned to hopefully enjoy my dessert -- the Hawaiian Bread Pudding.  Afterall, and how can anyone (especially me) not enjoy bread pudding of any kind.  I didn't like that either.  The texture was slightly too custard-y for my tastes. Mysteriously, our bill was $245 (before tip; for two people).  It is a rare occasion that I've spent so much money to be both sober and underwhelmed by my meal.  I was also still hungry having effectively only eaten 6 pot stickers and 1.5 shrimp.  I have no complaints about the service.  Our waiter was extremely knowledge about the wine offerings and very accommodating.Noreetuh is certainly a unique option in the city, but I probably won't return unless I'm in the area, someone else suggests it and I'm too polite to veto the selection.",,,

My first impression of Noreetuh is the small space however, it gives a warm and coziness to the place. Noreetuh offered the prie-fixed course we decided to get, which included snacks, starters and entree. There is wine pairing for a separate price, however we decided on getting a bottle of Sparkling wine. For snacks, we choose the Beef Tongue Musubi and Silken Tofu. The Beef Tongue Musubi were savory, flavorful and delicious. I love it and will be coming back for more. Follow by starters, we chose the Tuna Poke and Grilled Octopus. Then for our entree, we have the Hanger Steak and Uni Spaghetti. The steak was cooked to perfection with delicious pesto sauce. And the Uni Spaghetti was creamy and exquisite.  Everything was perfect from the service to food. The manager or owner Jin took care of us very well. The service was very personalized, and he was knowledgeable about his wines.

86,Nanciee N.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,239,248,4.0,8/18/2017,"Came for restaurant week dinner. Appetizer, entree, dessert.The restaurant is seems pretty small, but I think they have more seating beyond what meets the eye. Upon entering the restaurant, a host would warmly greet you. Unlike some restaurants where their list is in the front, their's is near their bar area, which was fine. We had reservations from opentable at the bar, but since there were table seats, we were offered to sit there, which was great.Service was pretty good. People came to check in on us and fill our water often.Food portions seemed small, but if you're getting a 3-course meal, expect yourself to get full. We got the mushroom tempura, which tasted pretty good. I usually don't eat mushrooms, but I didn't taste the mushroom and was able to enjoy it cuz the batter was good. The silken tofu was what interested me to this restaurant. It was definitely a pretty dish with a unique combo of flavors. In general, this dish would be a hit or miss, honestly. It was just okay for me, but you'd have to try it to decide for yourself. The wagyu steak with fried rice was absolutely the most delicious! The rice tasted good, and usually I only enjoy my gramma's fried rice, but it was good here. The steak was juicy, and definitely, savor it if you get it! For dessert, I had the sundae. It was an interesting combo of flavors.My first time trying Hawaiian cuisine, and I was not disappointed. The combination of flavors were definitely fitting. Some dishes may be a hit or miss, but that's all up to a person's taste buds. The presentation is fantastic. Romantic ambiance for catching up or a date.

I was somewhat impressed by some of the dishes but not enough that I'd return .  We tried the salmon and tuna poke as starters . Wasn't a fan of the tuna at all. The salmon was pretty good though. Entrees were good . The bass entree tasted good but was very small and was pretty much a 4""*2"" piece of fish on a bed of asparagus . I didn't really notice any of the black beans and it made the dish even less complete when you request the meal without the bacon . The Bass was rather crunchy which was unique and fun and it was tasty .The other entree was the cod . It was again tasty but had very small pieces of fish in it maybe 3 pieces altogether mixed in with spaghetti and some other garnishes . Very small portion again but it was tasty .The deserts however were excellent . I highly recommend the bread pudding .The warm bread contrasting with the cold ice cream was a perfect match . All in all it was a good meal and better service. The sundae is a good option as well just not as good as the bread pudding .",,,
89,Jonathan N.,"New York, NY",71,66,361,3.0,10/7/2016,"Disclaimer: Review is based on a 2016 Summer Restaurant Week experience, however I suspect their are many parallels with the Restaurant Week dining experience and regular dining experience as most of their RW menu items are their most popular dishes.Outside of Spam, homemade loco moco's, and giving in to NYC's latest poke craze, I'm not at all familiar with Hawaiian food. So elevated high end Hawaiian cuisine seemed like a unique and interesting dining experience to try. Refined and modern is a good way to describe the decor. Clean metal chairs and wooden tables make up most of the furniture. Tastefully shying away from the typical Hawaiian decoration tropes, you won't find Luau or Tiki themed anything here. Instead, the homages to Hawaii are expressed in small pictures and a beautiful tiled wall that is a of course a nod to the turtle- one of Hawaii's treasured animals. We had a few servers during our visit, but our main waiter was especially memorable. He was polite, knowledgeable about the food menu and wine list, upbeat, and even playful at times.Our food went as follows:Appetizers:Big Eye Tuna Poke with pickled jalepenos, macadamia nuts, and seaweed. It was crisp and fresh. The macadamia nuts gave it some much needed texture, while the pickled jalepenos gave it some acidity and slight spice. I will say the chef was a little heavy handed with the sesame oil though.Silken Tofu with Uni, ikura, shiitake mushroom, and shiso. Light and refreshing, I think this dish looks better than it tastes. The uni, which I was told was sourced from Maine was a little too briny and a touch bitter. The tofu and ikura were perfect, but there was something (maybe the shiitake) that give it a strong savory anise flavor. Too many components not working in harmony.Entrees:Black Angus Steak with grilled romaine, sesame, red onion, and taro gratin. The steak itself was cooked perfectly, and the taste had a satisfying gamey quality that was unapologetic about being red meat. The pickled red onions were a nice touch, and I loved loved loved the taro gratin. However the grilled romaine was a complete joke, the charring did little for the flavor, and the outer portion became limp and wilted.Mentaiko Spaghetti with smoked butterfish, aonori, chili. Creamy, briny, and slightly spicy, I can see why this dish is a fan favorite at Noreetuh. There is a smoky quality to the dish that comes from the butterfish that is smoked in house. A lot of people like to call mentaiko pasta the carbonara of the sea, I really like that description for it. If you've never had it before, Noreetuh has one of the best interpretations of it.Dessert:Bruleed Pineapple with sea salt and lime zest. This was another one of those, looks great but I'll probably never order it again dishes. The whole dish was a pedestrian and forgettable. The bruleed layer added a touch of saltiness which theoretically would have rounded out the pineapple, but the pineapple itself was much more tart than sweet. Disappointing.Kings Hawaiian bread pudding. Another L with this dessert. The custard soaked bread tastes more like bad French toast than it did bread pudding. The raisins were off and unnecessary. And the generic ice cream was unimaginative and effortless.Noreetuh is as much a wine destination as it is a food one. You'll find some really good (and even rare) wines at accessible prices here. The most value comes from the higher priced items though. While I am impressed with the wine selection overall, I don't feel as if the wine list has been curated with the cuisine in mind. Rather, it feels like a hodgepodge of quality wines that owner Jin Ahn prefers. There are some harmonious food and wine pairings here that truly deliver, but such marriages are few and far between.Hawaiian food and culture as a whole is a mismatch and blend of different cultures. Noreetuh certainly embodies that mixture of different influences and inspirations. There are lots of moving parts that sometimes help and other times hurt the final product. The result is a sometimes beautiful, mostly confusing, but unequivocally unique dining experience. There is certainly room in NYC for refined modern Hawaiian cuisine.",5,2,2
90,Iryna B.,"New York, NY",13,95,353,3.0,2/2/2018,Great service very attentive no matter where you sit.  The portions are tiny though and so are very different from your usual Hawaiian expectations. Food is pricey though they have great options for restaurant week and also brunch for much less . Was a good to try option but very small and cramped in space and loud so probably would not be stopping by again,,,
91,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,3.0,10/8/2016,"The savory stuff is really just ok. Chow noodles are pretty much flavorless except for a high dose of salt, and the kabocha tempura is approximately 100% breading plus oil and 0 kabocha. But the chocolate haupia sundae is by far the best sundae I have ever had. WTF is haupia and why is it soooooo amazing? Its texture is like a mousse and works perfectly with the almond slices, graham cracker crisps and ice cream. I couldn't stop myself from spooning into the bowl until I basically licked it. I probably wouldn't come back to this place but will surely remember that sundae forever and ever.",3,2,3
92,Daniel B.,"Vernon Hills, IL",200,190,57,4.0,3/22/2016,"Good Hawaiian food? In New York? Is that even possible?Well Noreetuh certainly gives it a great effort! I came here for brunch, and I realize that the dining experience can be totally different from dinner, but overall it seems like the quality of the service and food are very consistent!I got Pork belly hash; the pork was very crispy, almost...kind of hard. There were a few pieces that I really had to grind down; this was probably the only negative element of the dish. The eggs came very runny, which I love, and the toast was perfectly browned and had a nice sweetness to it. Pretty solid for $14! Funny enough, I came here with a Hawaiian friend, because I just had to get his opinion on the authenticity of the food! Overall, he seemed very satisfied with his Hawaiian breakfast, claiming that it was similar to what he made at home (I assume he meant ingredient-wise, probably not quality-wise).Noreetuh is a wonderful, slightly exotic option for either dinner or brunch! If you can make the trek all the way to 1st ave, I highly recommend this place.",,,
93,Joanna T.,"Manhattan, NY",360,115,117,4.0,3/16/2016,"Pretty good dining experience. Restaurant is kinda small so I would make reservations before coming. I haven't tried much Hawaiian food but I don't think this place is super authentic since there are pasta dishes. Spam musubi - 3/10 I was so excited to try this because the photos from other reviews looked good but it literally tasted like straight salt.Tuna poke - 6/10 this tasted okay, nothing memorable and wasn't worth the $18.Pineapple braised pork belly - 9/10 definitely try this dish, it was cooked so well and melted in my mouth. Sweet potatoes were a nice touch as well. Mochi waffles - 7/10 waffles were cooked well and peanut butter was yummy",,,

The waiter thought my brother was joking when he told him it was the best meal he'd ever had ha ha. Even dishes I'd normally avoid, like Poke, were exceptional. I'm normally 'meh' when I try all these other places and food things you read about but every dish on every course we had was above and beyond expectation.",,,
95,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,4.0,10/1/2016,"Having never been to Hawaii, and only hearing glancing stories of dishes like poi, lau lau, and hamburger over rice, I said yes immediately to Noreetuh. Guys, this is why living in the East Village can be awesome, once you get past the rank smell of weed at every corner. Our waiter was incredibly friendly, chatting with my friend over where the prime real estate in Hawaii was (Kona over Honolulu, but you didn't hear it from me), and the menu looked adventurous enough without scaring away someone who has never tried uni before (in other words, there's also steak, chicken, and lamb to balance out all the fish entrees). I only wish we got to try more things: we had the crispy mushrooms with miso sauce, the heart of palm salad, and the sea urchin tagliatelle. Oh the three, the pasta was the clear winner - I've never tried the Italian-Japanese combo of uni spaghetti, but this was absolutely amazing. Buttery, insanely rich, it came in a portion that was just right. Any more would have been way too heavy. Heart of palm salad was refreshing and crunchy, with oranges and hazelnuts, but I would skip the mushrooms. They were nice and fried, but the mushroom pieces were a little too large to bite through gracefully. My only tip is to feature some cocktails on the drink menu. Noreetuh currently offers wine and beer, but I would imagine there to be so much room to play around with Hawaiian themed cocktails. NEXT TIME: big eye tuna poke, cold buckwheat noodles, mochi-crusted bass",3,1,3

Called well in advance for a reservation for a Friday dinner, great service and great decor (with holiday touches). The interior is a bit cramped and people sitting on either side of us were always close to knocking over our drinks. Mochi bass was delicious (note that it's a crunchy mochi texture, not chewy) but it was really the beans under it that were phenomenal. Also ordered the steak which was a bit bland (well cooked medium rare though!) but the miso sauce that came with it was amazing.",,,
98,Onjira R.,"New York, NY",240,6,1,3.0,2/19/2018,"I was very excited to try this place because you don't see many Hawaiian inspired restaurants around here. We came here for restaurant week to check it out. When we first walk in, the decor seems like they clash. Both very nice, but they don't really go together. The really nice addition that they have is the charging outlets all around the bar. Definitely a plus.Service was good. Our server was the Asian guy with the glasses, sorry, never got your name. Check on us for every course, changed plates between courses as well.We got the soju punch, which was nice. Would have been better if there were some garnishes like fruits or something.Now for the food..- silken tofu - very nice, light, and flavorful when you eat every different ingredient together in each bite.- grilled octopus - perfectly cooked. Everything on that plate was amazing and went well together. Honestly, the best this we ate that night!- pork belly - it was soft like butter, it was amazing. Only negative part was that the dish was very oily. There were some little pasta (I don't know exactly what it was) under the pork belly. It tasted great but there was a lot of oil under it, which I'm assuming was from the pork belly, which made it hard to enjoy.- imperial wagyu - Not as good as I hoped. Fried rice was delicious. Beef was not as tender as expected. Definitely needed that Chinese broccoli to cut the saltiness of both the rice and beef together.- chocolate haupia sundae - 1 scoop of ice cream with a lot of whipped cream. There were some waffer chips in there that tasted kind of stale, which really affected the taste of the dessert- Hawaiian bread pudding - tasted like French toast with sour raisins on top.Would come back for just the appetizers. The entrees and desserts were underwhelming.",,,
99,Victoria L.,"Philadelphia, PA",96,391,23,3.0,11/30/2016,"The bestie and I excitedly came here one evening. The place is much smaller than we had originally anticipated. Unfortunately I had a small rolling carry-on that I had to squeeze in between my neighbor and me, but it didn't seem to cause that much trouble. For some reason, we were under the impression that we could get cocktails here. (Maybe the Hawaiian menu had us thinking fruity, boozy concoctions?) Nonetheless, we decided on a bottle of sparkling instead that was really good. From the menu, we both decided to do the prix fixe and share our 3 courses together. For appetizers, I got the wings while she got the squash tempura. The wings had a bold citrus flavor with a little spicy kick to them, which we enjoyed. The sweet, mild flavor of squash was a little lost in a heavy fried batter and the strong flavors from bonito. Next, I got the octopus and she got the tuna poke (surcharge). There were decent but not special. My friend had recently come back from Hawaii (perhaps how we ended up here in the first place), and she was sorely underwhelmed. The tuna poke, especially, had a lot of flavors going on that didn't necessarily let the tuna shine through. After all the rave about the uni tagliatelle with roe, we ordered it (surcharge) but were sorely disappointed. The bright orange color was almost-concerning vibrant and the aroma was unappealingly fishy. We had a couple bites, which were rich and salty/briny, and guiltily got the rest to go. To be adventurous, I got the spam agnolotti as my entree. This was also a little disappointing because the spam seemed to be ground with other types of meat that made the flavor underwhelming, especially with the heavy truffle. I felt like I was eating regular ol' Italian pasta dish. Given our meal, we decided to skip dessert even though some of them sounded good.. For the price, this wasn't necessarily worth it. Mostly because when we take the time to sit down at a nice meal in New York, we have high standards since there are so many great options out there!",1,,
100,Judy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",493,301,659,4.0,8/12/2016,"I love Asian fusion cuisine and Noreetuh did not disappoint! My only complaint is the wrong hours of operation on their website for restaurant week, they close at 10 not 9 PM. I really enjoyed their appetizers, they were the right amount of unique without tasting too weird. My favorite was the uni silken tofu and the Mochi crusted fish. The pineapple Creme brûlée was exceptional. I will definitely come back again to try their regular menu! They also had a good selection of wine, sake and cocktails!",3,2,4

103,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",532,293,1896,4.0,9/6/2016,"""I'll try some Hawaiian food tonight"" .. and that led me to Noreetuh one Friday evening. Managed to get a reservation the very last minute so things were going smoothly already. I did not get to see the other side of the dining room but I was situated in a cute little two top and made my way into deciding what to try for the night. They were offering restaurant week, sweet! I really tried not to order everything on the menu but I opted for the restaurant week deal and then added some items from their adventurous menu. They also offer a 3 course prix-fixe menu daily for dinner. I loved the wine list! great selection on the wines by the glass, sake and beers on draft. They have hitachino nest on draft! Always love a place that offers fever tree ginger ale. Depending on my mood, I love wine pairings but tonight I was feeling a bit picky. After two glasses, I thought that I should have probably ordered a bottle instead. The truffle taro chips were so good but I wished it came in a bigger portion. The silken tofu was a bit disappointing and lacked some flavor. I had high expectations for the corned beef tongue musubi. It was alright, not amazing. I did not know how to appreciate the flavors in the tuna poke, it could have been the pickled jalapenos but I'm not sure. I wanted all these other appetizers, it was so tough to choose! The mentaiko spaghetti was ordinary but the black angus steak was surprisingly delicious. The grilled romaine with sesame seeds on the dish was so simple yet had great flavors to it and the taro really added to the dish. The foie gras of the sea, Monkfish liver with passionfruit jelly and pear paired with amazing bread. It was the absolute best monkfish liver dish I have ever had. The liver was super rich and creamy. It is a very particular combination so only go for it if you love monkfish liver. The bruleed hawaiian pineapple with lime zest and alaea salt was one of the best desserts I have ever had. The sundae was pretty good too and it was served with the best coconut ice cream ever. The crispy mochi waffles were disappointing though. There were some up and downs but overall, the food still hit the spot, great vibes and exceptional service. I can't wait to be back for more.",2,1,2
104,Rima F.,"New York, NY",179,391,12,5.0,8/16/2016,"What a wonderful experience we had at Noreetuh last evening!  From start to finish, everything was perfect.  We were welcomed by friendly staff and loved the gentle, comfortable ambience of Noreetuh. Our waiter, Daniel, provided excellent service throughout our meal. The Co-owner was also very friendly and helpful to us.The menu provided many more choices than most NYC Restaurant Week menus. It was such an exotic selection of dishes that it was not easy to make final decisions. Everything we ordered was amazing.  This is what we had (I had to take a menu home in order to remember all the names and ingredients):For the first course we had the shrimp poke with cucumber, wasabi, pearl onion and yuzu. We also had the Big-eye tuna poke with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapeños, and seaweed.  For our main courses we had the Black Angus steak with grilled romaine, sesame, red ion and taro gratin and kochi-crusted bass with green beans and chinese bacon. Then for desset we had the chocolate haupia sundae and the bruleed hawaiian pineapple.Each and every dish was incredibly delicious and so unusual . What a treasure to have this special nouveau-Hawaiian restaurant in NYC!",3,,2
105,Wendy C.,"New York, NY",3,237,348,5.0,11/20/2017,"Fantastic restaurant that I will likely recommend to friends. Come for an unique but excellent culinary experience with great service.Noreetuh feels romantic and cozy . Upon walking it, there's a coat rack where everyone can hang their coats, and walk on inside before getting seated. I was 30 minutes late to my reservation due to crazy Manhattan traffic; I had notified them prior to my reservation time and they were very nice about it. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive - as someone who drinks a ton of water, I appreciated that my glass was always filled quickly after I emptied it.We ordered the pineapple braised pork belly, the mochi-crusted bass, and the monkfish liver torchon. I liked the concept of the monkfish liver torchon - the bread had a sweet flavor and was toasted to perfection, and spread to bread ratio was great. I think some may find the monkfish liver flavor to be overly fishy, though I was okay with it. The passionfruit spread on the side helped to cut into the liver / fishy flavor. I didn't care for the combination of sweet passionfruit and fishy monkfish liver, but I am glad that I tried it. The pork belly was my favorite. The lighter pineapple pieces helped to cut into the heaviness of the pork belly. I wish the sauce had been a tad less salty, but I thought that the pork belly was braised to perfection. The mochi-crusted bass is a great, lighter option that balanced out our meal. Our waitress (who was very kind and friendly by the way) said this was one of her favorites. I appreciated that the freshness of the bass was apparent in the dish, meaning that other flavors didn't overpower the natural, fresh fish flavor. The mochi crust was crispy, airy, and not overly thick. The sauce underneath (black bean sauce?) was too salty. The Chinese bacon that accompanied the dish was also pretty tasty.",1,,
106,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,6/26/2015,"Given the sheer amount of coverage that Noreetuh's gotten over the past few weeks, there are very few people who haven't heard of the cozy East Village restaurant. Started by two Per Se vets (manager Jin Ahn, executive chef Chung Chow), the restaurant takes a modern, playful spin on Hawaiian cuisine, best evidenced in the fact that ""Noreetuh"" translates into ""Playground"" in Korean.The space isn't the most ideal, though. The dining room is split into two divided sections, and tables are tightly packed with minimal walking space between them. The lengthiness and narrowness of such a layout also means that sunlight is a very precious commodity, and darkness settles faster than at most venues (which may be a benefit to some diners). My group of three were seated in the second room, and our server was quick to fill our glasses with water and give a welcome overview of the menu. Noreetuh offers a variety of snacks, starters, and mains, making it an ideal place for shared plates; how else would you try the endless tempting options available?We started first with the Silken Tofu, one of the more visually arresting dishes. Served in a small bowl, the delicate tofu is topped with a few servings of uni (sea urchin), ikura (salmon roe), and a shiitake mushroom duxelle. A few sprigs of shiso finish off the presentation, and it's at once a simple, yet quietly complex dish; the pairing of such ingredients have been tried and true. We also opted for the Corned Beef Tongue Musubi, a take on traditional Hawaiian snack which is usually served with Spam. It was certainly tasty, a foolproof wrapping of sushi rice, cilantro, and crushed peanuts in a nori sheet, and the corned beef a welcome alternative in both taste and texture for the canned ""meat product"".Perhaps not worth an order are the Kalua Pork Croquettes, two piping hot, deep-fried croquettes served over cabbage with katsu sauce. While tasty, the preparation prevented us from noting any distinction of the kalua. Replace that instead with the much-loved Big-Eye Tuna Poke, a surprisingly traditional take on the popular Hawaiian dish. The tuna is delicious, the subtle flavor highlighted beautifully by the hint of sesame oil and tobanjan-hinted seaweed strands. Let's not forget the addition of the macademia nuts and pickled jalapeño slices, which add just the right amount of heat and acidity to each bite, without overpowering the main protein.For the daring, the Braised Honeycomb Tripe is a solid order. Korean dukbokki, or sticky rice cakes, are cooked with the braised tripe; a smart decision as it takes away the typically overpowering flavor in the offal. Add on a healthy amount of gochujang sauce, the sweet-spicy Korean red pepper paste, and toss with bamboo shoots, onion, and chili, and you have a recipe for success. The bite of my friend's Spam Agnolotti was eye-opening as well, as the pairing with ramps, honshimeji, green almond, and bonito brought out a completely different flavor profile than I had been expecting.I hesitate to call Noreetuh a ""fusion"" restaurant, as much of Hawaiian cuisine has its roots in Japanese food, and the interplay of Korean ingredients and flavors is smartly and subtly done. What the restaurant has succeeded in doing, however, is establishing an identity that is unique from any other restaurant in the city - which, coupled with well-conceived and executed dishes, makes for a value proposition you can't deny.",18,7,15

I am inspired to make some M.M.

Poké has become a bit of a fad, and even when we were in Hawaii last year, some places drown it in soy and mayo. Nothing could be further from the truth at Noreetuh. The portion was a bit small, but really fresh and tasty. The type of seaweed served with it was interesting: almost a carpaccio of sea-broccoli that had been lightly blanched. The dried seaweed and sesame sprinkles on the rice were also delicious. We also had the loco moco, though in this case, made with fried chicken. It was moist and crispy (thigh meat), with a savory gravy and two perfectly-cooked eggs. We also had the dumplings, which are petite yet crispy and tasty. Service was friendly and attentive. They could use a more extensive drink menu, such as a mai tai, though I suspect that their liquor license is limited. Beers from Maui Brewery would also be a plus.

Moreover, the flavor profile was just amazing, the sauce had the perfect hint of richness that balanced perfectly with the octopus and the spiciness from the kimchiBruleed Hawaiian pineapple - such a simple dish, but so unique and special at the same time.  The brulee crust was perfect and it made that crisp sound when you break into it, and the salt was unexpected, but worked well with the sweetness of the sugar crust and the pineapple.  If anything, I just wish the plate was bigger, for a $10 dish, they can give you half a small pineapple instead of quarter of one.Mochi-crusted halibut - I am normally not a huge fan of fish, but after reading all the reviews on this dish, we decided to give it a try. The mochi-crust was interesting, it does not really taste like mochi, but it provided a nice crunch to the texture.  Moreover, the sauce that accompanied the dish was very delicious, and the pine nuts also gave the dish more depth.Crispy mochi waffles - another dish that had great texture and unusual flavor combination.  I can't believe I never had a mochi waffle before, now I want all of my waffles to be made of mochi.  The combination of whipped peanut butter and honey was heavenly.Corned beef tongue musubi - I couldn't really tell it was beef tongue, I thought it was actually spam for a minute, as it is the traditional meat for a musubi.  The cilantro sauce with crushed peanuts was very tasty, as such, they could've put any meat in there.  Monkfish liver torchon - the toast made from Hawaiian roll elevated the dish, as did the fruit spread underneath the liver.  The monkfish liver was smooth and buttery.Silken tofu - unlike other dishes, I've seen this dish many times in Japanese restaurants, i.e. the combination of uni, ikura and tofu. It was good, but nothing to write home about.Big-eye tune poke - the less interesting of the two poke dishes, it was perfectly fine, but a bit of a let down after trying the octopus poke. It was a bit bland and nothing truly stood out in the dishGarlic shrimp over rice - similar to the tuna poke, this was a decent dish, the shrimp was cooked well, and the pineapple was a good touch. However, garlic shrimp is one of the most popular dishes in Hawaii, particularly among the food trucks in Oahu.  This dish could not hold up in comparison to the amazing ones that were served on the North Shore of Oahu.Service: I can't stop raving about the great service we received.  The waiter was informative, and attentive without being overbearing.  There were three of us, but the musubi dish only had two pieces per order.  He allowed us to order three pieces so that we can have one each.  It was a small gesture, but it made a huge difference.  Overall impression: it was a small restaurant, but they managed to not overcrowd the space with too many tables. I know the NYT review complained about the music, but I hardly noticed any music in the background, the noise level was on par with a small/packed restaurant.  Do note that they don't serve cocktails, only wine and beer.  I would highly recommend the place, and would love to come back to try the other dishes.",3,,1
116,Celeste M.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",211,146,81,3.0,8/14/2017,"I came in with a friend for restaurant week 2017. We made a reservation which didn't seem necessary on a early Sunday evening. The ambiance is nice, minimal decoration but their playlist is very fun. Everyone we talked to was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. We both ordered the poke, her the salmon and I the tuna. Both were very good but with the new poke craze taking NYC by storm, it wasn't notable or creative. I no longer need to hunt for good poke so I wouldn't come her just for that. On to the mains. I ordered the kaluha pork cavatelli and she the mentaiko spaghetti. My entree had a little too many conflicting flavors for me to thoroughly enjoy it. The pork was a bit sweet which was nice and the cheese very salty which was expected, but it didn't stop there, they added a pickled cabbage. So basically the dish was sweet, salty and tangy. My friend's entree lacked a lot of flavor. Probably because most of the flavor comes from the smoked cod, but there was barely any smoked cod. On to dessert. We were both looking forward to this as they had a pineapple upside down cake for 2 with pineapple ice cream. When it came out, they had added cherry and vanilla ice cream and some caramelized cherries. I wish that had been written on the menu (which is different from on their website) because we would've stated to only include pineapple ice cream. The cherry kind of throws your palate for a loop in the bad sense. Overall, the service was great and the food was okay. I don't think I could see myself back here especially not for the poke or the entrees.",4,3,4
117,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64753,3.0,4/26/2015,"One of my most favorite eating trips ever was a two week vacation in Hawaii, so I am always excited to try a new Hawaiian restaurant in NYC, especially since they are relatively rare here. One of the things I loved about the food there was how satisfying it was, but this meal just left me wanting more.It is easy to see that this intimate new spot is run by former Per Se chefs, as the portions are on the small side and the prices are on the high side. There are a good number of choices on the menu, most of which have some type of interesting Hawaiian influence:- Truffle Taro Chips ($11)These were pretty delicious and a nice way to start the meal. As just mentioned though, this was a little bowl for $11. I wouldn't mind less truffle and getting some complimentary chips to start instead.- Corned Beef Tongue Musubi, Cilantro, Peanut ($6)This was one of my favorites, swapping out the typical spam for some delicious tongue. This was one of the few items that was very reminiscent of the stuff I tried in Hawaii and was done exceptionally well.- Silken Tofu, Uni, Ikura, Mushroom, Shiso ($12)I'm not a big uni guy, but if you like it, chances are you also like ikura, and furthermore silken tofu, so you will probably be in heaven with this dish. The textures were just way too mushy for me to enjoy, but you should kind of expect that going in knowing the ingredients here.- Big-Eye Tuna Poke, Macadamia Nuts, Pickled Jalapeno, Seaweed ($17)This was ok. It was a little too light on the tuna though, dominated mostly by the pickled jalapeno and seaweed.- Kalua Pork Croquettes, Cabbage, Katsu Sauce ($11)These were two large discs of kalua pork encased in a crispy, fried batter, and of course very delicious. Other than the musubi, this was definitely the best bite of the meal.- Chow Noodles, Bean Sprouts, Jalapeno, Shiitake, Lily Flower, Spiced Tofu ($16)These were pretty good, but I would have loved some meat in here. Also, it was a tiny bowl of noodles that I couldn't help but notice was smaller than the size of half of the portion you get with the stellar peanut noodles at Tuome with the Pig Out feast,.- Spam Tortellini, Poached Egg, Yu Choy, Goji Berries, Chrysanthemum ($17)This one was just not good. The Tortellini seemed extremely undercooked, as each piece took work to chew through.- Macadamia Nut Brownie, Coconut Ice Cream ($9)This brownie was pretty good, but not $9 good. I believe the ice cream was from Davey's, so instead of ordering this here, go across the street to Davey's to get an even bigger, better scoop, with an excellent brownie as well if you wish.- Crispy Mochi Waffles, Whipped Peanut Butter, Alaea Salt ($8)This was actually incredible, mostly because I am a major peanut butter guy. The peanut butter on top of the light waffles was super rich and creamy, and paired with that hint of salt and the crispiness of the waffles, it was a perfect bite. Make sure you get this dessert.Overall, the meal was enjoyable. The ambiance is really nice and laid-back and the service was perfect. The food just didn't really live up to expectations and it was a little too pricey to justify and didn't wow enough to warrant a return visit.",24,8,12
118,Rose K.,"New York, NY",397,452,591,4.0,4/26/2016,"Dang. I kind of didn't need to want Hawaii more than I already do. It's kind of like finding out he reads books, or that he likes long walks on the beach. Did you really need *more* to entice you?We were enticed by the prix fixe. Everything was creative and possibly more ""interesting"" than traditional. The silken tofu was so curious, with the melding of arguably similar mushy? textures with vastly different tastes. The monkfish liver torchon was a powerful dish. Anything on a hawaiian roll is pretty addictive, so fair warning! I smeared some of the soy mayonnaise from the square tempura on this concoction, and my date thought that was weird but it was kind of interesting. I'm a big fan of trying different sauces on everything. Honestly, the winner of the night was the mentaiko spaghetti. Neither of us expected this at all, and we ordered it with some apprehension. But trust me, it completely stole the show. We probably would have fought over the single portion but we kept it pretty civil. This time.",4,4,4
119,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,4.0,5/2/2015,"This new Hawaiian restaurant is quite impressive. The three founding chefs all met each other while working at Per Se, so you know that they know how to put good food on a plate. The dishes here are simple, yet elegant and delicious. The menu is very affordable with no dish over $22. Portions are a bit on the small side, so I'd advise getting an appetizer to share along with your main.We got the corned beef tongue musubi which is a glammed-up version of spam musubi - a Hawaiian staple. Next we got the big-eye tuna poke seaweed salad. I highly recommend this - the flavors meld together well and everything on the plate is very fresh. I think it's one of the most popular starters on the menu.For our mains we got the mochi-crusted fluke and the chow noodles. The chow noodles are quite spicy, so if you don't care for spice beware. I love spicy food and really enjoyed it. The mochi-crusted fluke was pretty bomb - my only complaint is I wish there were more.Check this place out before it becomes too popular! I wouldn't be surprised if Noreetuh earned a michelin star one day.",5,1,1

I would get something else next time.big-eye tuna poke - this was good, tuna was freshmochi-crusted bass - I would get this again. It was delicious, fish was cooked just right and I know this sounds ridiculous but those string beans were mad bomb (lol)king's hawaiian bread pudding - I would skip this next time, but I may be a bit bias because I'm not a fan of bread puddingbruléed hawaiian pineapple - if you like pineapple, this is it. chocolate haupia sundae - I recommend this as well. as my friend would say ""NOMZ""I came during restaurant week so I got to try a lot of things but I believe Noreetuh does prix fixe dinner regularly.

121,Rach K.,"New York, NY",240,1037,852,4.0,5/11/2016,"Yum!I met a friend here for dinner and we each decided to go for the prix-fixe so we could sample a variety from the menu for a decent price.For our appetizers (or ""snacks"" as they were listed on the menu) we got the silken tofu with uni & shiitake and the mochiko wings. The tofu was amazing and the texture was really lovely. The uni was kind of fishy, but neither of us are huge fans of uni so it's probably just our bias. The wings were awesome. The breading was really crispy and the sauce had a nice balance of sweet and savory.Our next course (the ""starters"") consisted of two different pokes: the big eye tuna poke and the octopus poke. The tuna was bright and fresh and not at all fishy. It had a sweet soy and sesame seasoning and the portion was quite generous. The octopus was lightly grilled until perfectly tender and it was served with baked beans, which was kind of odd but also worked nicely. The soft beans were a nice textural contrast with the octopus.For our mains, we shared the mentaiko spaghetti and the braised pork belly. The spaghetti was probably my favorite dish of the night. The pasta was cooked perfectly to al dente and had an unctuous fishy quality (in the best way possible). The pork belly was so tender it was just falling apart and was seasoned nicely.For dessert we shared the King's Hawaiian bread pudding. It was good but nothing to write home about. It's worth sharing for the experience.The staff were so smiley and the service was great. It's a bit pricey for sure, but you're paying for ambiance and the impeccable service so it's worth it for a special occasion, I'd say.",3,1,2
122,Sophia W.,"Manhattan, NY",396,195,107,3.0,10/7/2016,"3.5/5 stars with room for improvementCute little restaurant currently serving 3 course for $42 including a snack, appetizer and an entree. I would say that without the deal, dishes are on the pricier side for east village. Generally, they were quite delicious, but not wow amazing. Their big-eye tuna poke and pork chop were good. The portions were satisfying and maybe on the bigger side for someone with a smaller stomach. The grilled octopus was let-down. Not charred enough and too tough on the inside. Can't believe it was recommended to us ;(. This is usually my go-to dish to gauge how good a restaurant is at making ""cooked"" seafood and indeed, the sea bass was just alright.I would say that noreetuh does its fresh fish and meats well, but could perhaps work a little on its cooked seafood. I would like to try their noodle/pasta dishes next time.",,,
123,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",169,571,866,3.0,4/26/2015,"I'm shocked by the current 4.5 overall score for Noreetuh. We had dinner there tonight and thought it was just okay.First, the actual space of the restaurant is truly awkward. It is cramped and very narrow and hardly decorated. It felt like little effort had been put into the appearance, which was strange. I must say that it also didn't help that a baby was screaming for quite awhile a few tables away. I absolutely understand that sometimes nothing can be done and I feel for the parents but this went on for so long that it significantly diminished the dining experience.The service was good. The food was mixed. I will break it down by what we ordered.1. The silken tofu. This was nice, as I love both uni and fish eggs. The mushroom tapenade that came with it was excellent and so flavorful. 4 stars.2. The tuna poke. This was my favorite of the night. Fresh delicious cubes of tuna mixed with seaweed, macadamia nuts and some fantastic pickled jalapeños. 5 stars.3. The mochi-crusted fluke entree was disappointing. The whole dish was bland, the portion was small and the fish was overcooked. 1.5 stars.4. The spam tortellini entree was much better than the fish entree. The spam filling was salty and flavorful and mixed nicely with the runny egg yolk. It was overall an odd dish, though, with the goji berries. Interesting but strange. 3.5 stars.5. The pineapple dessert was nice. I've never had a brûléed pineapple before so it was a treat. 4 stars.Overall, I don't understand what the hype is all about. Dinner at Noreetuh was fine but I'm not dying to return. The prices were also HIGH.",3,2,1

Apparently they have only been open for a few months and everything was running very smoothly! This place has a slightly more casual atmosphere but with the service of a classy restaurant! The owner to AGM to our server were so amazing, attentive and polite! Props to them! As for food...my favs were the musubi, the uni tofu (could have probably finished that myself!!), shrimp and the pork belly!

125,Julia Z.,"New York, NY",167,293,675,3.0,4/6/2015,"Hawaiian food with a Hawaiian! I've been to Honolulu and loveddd the food so I was excited to try this. Opened by 3 Per Se alum's? It has to be amazing, right? WRONG.I would only recommend the following- Corned beef tongue musubi- Silken tofu: All the flavors came together very well and it's also hard to mess up uni- Tuna poke: The texture of the seaweed, fish and heat of the jalalpeno really came together. - King's Hawaiian bread puddingUnfortunately the rest of the meal wasn't as outstanding- Kalua pork croquettes: Not much flavor without the dipping sauce- Garlic shrimp over rice: The shrimp came out luke warm and there wasn't much flavor. The Hawaiian said he could cook better garlic shrimp- Braised honeycomb tripe: This was by far the worst dish. We took one bite of the rice cake which was was hard and tasted of gas. The first dish I have ever sent back in a restaurant. - Crispy mochi waffles: The idea of it sounds great but the execution was disappointing. It tasted like hard stale bread with peanut butter and drizzled with honey.They offer wine parings starting at $35 for 3 glasses. We were served champagne and two whites. They are light with the pours, I would recommend getting a bottle of wine instead. I really wanted to like you Noreetuh but everything fell short of expectations. The portions were small and the meal was not worth $200+. There are too many restaurants in NYC to come back here again. Realistically 2 stars, bumped up a star for attentive service.",4,1,2
126,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,3.0,4/24/2016,"Noreetuh has been on my radar for several months, and when I finally got to go, my excitement level was up to *here*. And perhaps that was its downfall - the hype built up my expectations and the food wasn't as mindblowing as I had hoped it'd be. It was good, surely, but not awesome.Crispy mushrooms - These were oyster mushrooms deep fried in crispy batter with a savory miso mayo dip. They were tasty, but you really couldn't have more than one or two because it was much too oily - oil wasn't hot enough, perhaps?Monkfish liver torchon - The monkfish liver suffered the same problem as the crispy mushroom. Tasty, fatty, and creamy, and I love the pairing of the pear and passionfruit, but there was a bit too much of it and I could have used less at a lower price.Sea urchin tagliatelle - I was torn between getting this and the mentaiko spaghetti, and I highly regretted my choice. I have a high tolerance for briny, fishy tastes (case in point: I eat sardines out a can and love ikura) but this was just way too fishy for me. There was something imbalanced about the dish - it could have used maybe a bit more richness or sweetness, but overall it just didn't cut it for me. At least they were generous with the sea urchin.Still, despite my expectations being not met, I would come back here and try the mentaiko spaghetti and hope that overturns my verdict. Service was great, and the manager Jin (twinsies!) showed gracious hospitality as well.",3,1,1
127,Irina D.,"Hoboken, NJ",35,134,89,5.0,3/2/2017,"For my 100th review (that took a while) I've decide to review my first (and so far only) Restaurant Week experience (that also took way too long). I came here about a month ago with my boyfriend to celebrate our two year anniversary. After looking through the many restaurants offering RW deals, I've narrowed it down to three and my bf chose Noreetuh.We walked in on a somewhat cold night, a few minutes before our reservation and were seated right away. It was a Sunday evening so the restaurant wasn't yet full, but had a few tables seated. The restaurant looks smaller than it really is, a few tables once you enter and some two seat ones by the wall, which is across from a bar. Only once I walked toward the bathroom, which is nice btw, I've noticed that there is a second room basically identical in size to the main one, minus the bar. The decor is pretty simple and can be completely ignored in the dimly lit space.A waiter came to us with the menus not long after we were seated. Since I looked at the menu before coming here, it didn't take us long to place our orders. We did have to place them all at once.For a first course, I ordered the big-eye tuna poke (with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapenos and seaweed). It was very fresh and flavorful, and just filling enough considering I still had more coming. My bf got the mushroom tempura (with sweet miso dip), I have had some of it and it was also very good. For a main I got the chow noodles (smoked tofu, jalapeno, mushrooms, onion, cilantro). It was a refreshing dish that tasted healthy and had some positively surprising flavors. The bf got the pineapple braised pork belly and enjoyed it a lot. For dessert, I got the bruleed Hawaiian pineapple (lime zest,'alaea salt) and he got the chocolate haupia sundae. The pineapple was just the right amount of sweetness but the chocolate haupia was one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. The Service was very attentive and warm throughout, someone other than our waiter came out with the dishes and explained to us what each dish was. The music was relatively low but we could still hear it, it was relaxing and we could easily have a conversation. I truly enjoyed this experience, and hope to be back sometime soon.",1,1,1
128,Alex R.,"New York, NY",113,12,0,4.0,1/1/2018,"I've come here a few times since Noreetuh opened and have enjoyed it but last night had finally sat for dinner. It was a great experience. From the moment we walked in, the staff was  attentive and friendly. They do not have a full bar but the wine menu is well curated and the sommelier made excellent recommendations. A lot of people that grew up in Hawaii often scoff at this place because the food is pricey and portions can be small. Hawaiian food is known for being casual, filling, and cheap so I would recommend trying something new and going for one of their unique house dishes to really appreciate this restaurant. Although the poke is really good here, it is only a few bites for double the price of what you get in Hawaii. If you're looking for more of your typical poke bowl, you should come for brunch as they offer a larger portion with rice, etc (still pricey). The musubi's were nice but honestly I prefer the 7/11 spam musubis in Oahu. Tofu uni app was pretty and tasty. The pasta dishes looked amazing and we will have to try those next time but the mochi crusted bass and wagyu beef really stood out. Every bite in the bass dish had so much flavor and great mix of texture. I didn't want it to end. We were full and didn't order dessert but  I love their halpia and Ube pie. I would definitely come back here for brunch or dinner. Their pre fixe menu with the pairing seems like a good deal and I can't wait to try it in the future.",,,

Everyone was in love with their dishes from the poke, hearts of palm salad to the mentaiko spaghetti and Mochi-crusted bass. And the desserts....oh man!

Surprisingly, even as we were leaving the restaurant was pretty full. It also looks small but wraps around in the back so you can seat larger groups (it smelled weird back there, though). 3.75 stars, just rounding up because I think they are new.Anyway.  Here's what we had- He had the big eye tuna poke - great portion, fantastic taste  (fatty, crunchy, spicy) and we loved the seaweed salad- I had the silken tofu - Please note. Do NOT get this unless you really, really like roe, fish paste, uni... It was overall too fishy for me and didn't have enough tofu in it.  It made the dish really salty. Portions were good, for the most part.  We had for dinner;-He, the pork belly. Honestly, this sounded really delish and is a signature dish.  Soft, caramelized pork belly (yummy!) with mustard greens and pineapple. Yum. -I, the bluefish spaghetti.  Honestly, I love the lemon flavor but felt it was overall a wee bit... salty. And I am a salt freak.  And the fish didn't add much flavor. I would have loved a bit of spice...For dessert (arguably the best part)-He the sundae, with salty graham cracker (yummmy!), coconut ice cream, nuts, marshmallow flush (it seemed like). This was a delicious dessert, hands down.-I, the burnt orange ice cream with tapioca, red bean, dried fruit.  Definitely a winner but still has more experimental Asian funk I had a glass of crips Sav Blanc with my meal. They were great about water refill, and prompt with service.  I would recommend - especially if you're not familiar with Hawaiian but overall love Asian/Chinese/Japanese flavors.   My particular RW could have been a little too experimental and I wish the food was a bit more refined.

It's hard to pay $7 for - few slices of spam, rice, and seaweed - but it's just sooo good!!! We also had the pineapple brûlée for dessert. It was sweet, and torched perfectly.

Updated review","This is a long overdue update to my previous reviews.  Noreetuh keeps getting better and my meal last night is proof.  Keeping true to the menu's Hawaiian influence, Chef Chow shows his craftsmanship with a Spam agnolotti (a small wonton shaped pasta) by enhancing the savory goodness of the humble Spam luncheon meat (so beloved by the 50th state) with an infusion of aromatic truffle in a cream sauce and showering a generous amount of shaved winter black truffle on top (lest you forget what you were tasting in the bowl).  The saltiness of the Spam and tang of the pickled celery penetrate the luxurious earthiness of the truffle making it a classic marriage of my favorite flavors.  I am aghast by the fact that it is part of the $42 3-course prix fixed menu.  What a gift to those who love truffles and homemade pastas!  Other favorites are the grilled octopus, big eye tuna poke and the mochiko chicken wings calamansi and chili.  There is so much complexity in the flavors of all the dishes that your taste buds are constantly being stimulated!  A new musubi made with pig jowl and an coating of ginger scallion oil is a brilliant combination of traditional Chinese flavoring with a favorite Hawaiian/Japanese snack and is a must try.  The spicy tuna musubi is another new addition that does not fail.  Brava Chef Chow for your dynamic menu and execution of the best ingredients with a Hawaiian twist.",,,
135,daniel y.,"New York, NY",11,6,0,3.0,2/26/2017,"Brunch for two. Made reservation for Sunday 12:15 but probably didn't need one given the place wasn't too busy. Very friendly and attentive wait staff.Spam Musubi was good but not mindblowing or spectacular, you can make same at home probably. Big Hawaiian Breakfast was big indeed. Everything was cooked just perfectly and the presentation was fantastic. However I feel like the dish overall could have used something a bit sour to the match the savoriness of overall plate.The tiny bit of kimchi that comes with it wasn't quite enough. The Hawaiian French Toast was way way too sweet for my liking. It was drenched in whipped cream. Do not get this as a main unless you really have a super sweet tooth. Best to be shared with at least 2 and probably closer to 3 people. Nice decor and atmosphere.Would go back again to try their poke.",1,,

I was introduced by the General Manager Jin who is super awesome giving me all sorts of recommendations and information about the menu. I started off with the kahlua croquettes which is Hawaiian pork mixed with mashed potatoes lightly fried, it was absolutely delicious. Then what I came for was the silken tofu with uni and salmon roe and mushroom. That dish was to die for. Supper yummy. And I finished with the musubi corn beef, which traditionally is made with spam, but they put a nice twist to it. That was phenomenal. I highly recommend Noreetuh to anyone who loves or wants to check out some of the best Hawaiian food in the city. Thanks Jin. Can't wait to come back for brunch",,,

After washing down the musubi with some local beer, my friend and I went to work on the heart of palm/beet salad with crispy shallots and smoked tofu.  The tofu was interesting but wish it was a bit smokier or maybe even a little spicy?  Regardless, the dish was enjoyed and it was a nice palate starter. We moved on to the kampachi and soppressata, eggplant relish, and basil and as the kampachi was served sashimi style- it was almost too pretty to eat! So yummy and I can't stop thinking about how weird but well the dish came together.We then opted for the mochi crusted fluke which was a bit salty but nice chewy exterior layer and the braised honey comb tripe with rice cake and bamboo shoots which my friend and I were left yearning for that spicy kick we'd imagine from a dish resembling dduk bokki, it was still good! We ended the meal with a  Brûléed pineapple dessert and wow, I don't like desssert but this I could eat all day. It was the perfect finish with the lime zest and salt...yum.While their wine selection was great, I wish they had a cocktail list as it would be fun to see what they can stir up while paying homage to the 3 very distinct countries.

Chocolate haupia sundae was not too sweet and had interesting flavors. Azuki bean and coconut tapioca was also not too sweet, and the textures made for a very unique dessert.

143,Izzy M.,"Flushing, NY",11,14,10,5.0,4/16/2017,Guys. I didn't even try everything on the menu but the Pork Jowl misubi alone was worth 5 stars. Service was great. But They could've slapped me in the face and called my girlfriend ugly I'll still give them 5 stars for the pork jowl. The beef tongue misubi is more like spam- just get a spam misubi somewhere- it'll be cheaper too. The specials are pretty legit. But the pork jowls. FAM. THE PORKJOWLMISUBIDOE.,,,

146,Mike Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,190,62,4.0,1/25/2016,"As a slight change of pace from my usual dining habits around this area and dining out in the full spirit of restaurant week (trying something new!) the SO and I went to Noreetuh for a weekday night dinner. The restaurant itself looks brand spanking new, everything was shiny and clean. Well-spaced dark wood tables, candles, and neutral walls. We sat towards the front of the restaurant next to the bar (which at the time of dining only had two stools there). We each took advantage of the three course prix fixe ($38) to try what Noreetuh had to offer.I started with the pork croquettes. Croquettes were good, fried well, starch-y but not anything too wildly different from what you would be able to get at a Japanese market. SO got the tuna poke which was really tasty! Would recommend that to start.For mains, I had a bass with asparagus; the SO the mentaiko spaghetti. The bass was crispy, executed well. The accompanying asparagus tasted vinegar-soy, not bad. The mentaiko spaghettie - was distinctly japanese with flakes of smoked butterfish mixed in.The desserts: haupia sundae, and azuki bean and tapioca float. the SO and I swapped as the haupia sundae tasted like a sundae and I really enjoyed the coconut ice cream graham cracker taste together. The azuki bean and tapioca float tasted like a toned down halo halo which is a good thing, cause halo halo is crazy. Even then the sweetness level on both desserts were excessive. Just overly sweet so much so that the nuances of the flavors get lost.Overall, Noreetuh is a nice place to grab dinner. Service was excellent, food was pretty good in a distinctly pacific island-ish way. Would certainly stop by again.",1,1,1

I do recommend to try. May come back.",,,

149,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",274,325,141,4.0,4/27/2016,"I was here for brunch recently, and got the bruleed pineapple and pork belly hash to share with a friend, as well as a POG mimosa. Items in descending order: -The pineapple was amazing, and I noticed that a lot of other patrons ordered it, as well. I'd be surprised to learn it isn't among the top few menu options here. It's seriously so good: the contrast between soft fruit and crunchy brulee is to die for.-The POG mimosa was an interesting and very topical take on the classic orange juice mimosa. I wouldn't say it was terribly innovative, though, as far as the universe of possibilities for brunch beverages goes, so I'd call it middle of the road.-The pork belly hash was somewhat underwhelming, as I feel like they over-rendered the pork belly and thus made it more like crackling than I'd expected. Personally, I'd have preferred that they'd gone the other direction on the pork belly.Overall, a decent brunch with one very solid pick, one middle-of-the-road pick, and one pick that I probably wouldn't go back to on my next visit.",,,

I just went here for restaurant week and they had actual dishes that are usually on the regular menu on the restaurant week menu, so I appreciated that. The only small critique I had was that sometimes there were parts when one portion of the food was salty than the other. I usually don't mix food before I eat so sometimes ending on a different level of saltiness was a little off, but overall the texture and flavor are spot on.",,,1

I've been trying to find good poke in the city for the longest time and this place has made that happen! Also came with macadamia nuts! very hawaiin :DUni and tofu- The ingredients were very fresh, and there were just so many flavors, the roe was salty and the mushrooms were sour and the tofu just helped balance it outCorned Beef Tongue Musubi- Never had beef tongue but its interesting, it was pretty good!

153,Rosalie V.,"Woodside, NY",127,63,60,3.0,8/17/2017,"Aw man, I was really rooting for this place. Picked this place for dinner during restaurant week August 2017. My husband and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon back in March so when I found out that there was a Hawaiian restaurant on restaurant week, we immediately had to try it! The food was decent. The appetizers we had was probably the best - the octopus.. and the poke was pretty good (still did not taste like Hawaii poke). for the main entrée, my husband had the pork with pineapple and it was good. My sister had spaghetti with cod and I had the bass. Again, they were decent..Definitely not what I was expecting.. didn't taste like Hawaii at all. Its almost Asian fusion and some Americanized entrees.. entrees with pineapple makes it Hawaiian I guess? The guy hostess that welcomed us was kind of rude/had an attitude. But our waitress was nice. This place had a nice unisex bathroom. Can't say much but anything else.. Probably won't go back here unless someone is paying for my food.. (they're pretty pricy too!)",,,
154,james l.,"New York, NY",194,20,0,5.0,2/15/2018,"This place is a real gem for foodies, the type of understated establishments that serves up amazing quality food. The owners are alums from per se, so you are basically getting fine dining chefs doing creative Hawaiian but in a casual setting. The wine list is also phenomenal. The beef tongue musubi and the monk fish liver are are must haves.",,,
155,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,4.0,11/6/2015,"I'm currently relatively unschooled in Hawaiian cuisine, but not for long, as I'm planning on visiting the Big Island and Oahu in late Jan/early Feb. Our visit to Noreetuh turned out to be some very pleasant trip research.Even for a newbie like me, it's pretty easy to tell that the chefs here create sophisticated takes on traditional Hawaiian cuisine, with attention paid to both interesting/unique flavor profiles and the aesthetic. The restaurant features two different rooms, each with a different look but both with a modern, classy vibe. The place was relatively empty when we arrived around 7, and things started to pick up and get pretty noisy when we left at 8:30.I only had one item each off of the ""snacks"" and ""mains"" sections, and while I didn't leave hungry, I probably could've had a little more food. For the price, I thought the main dishes were a tad on the smaller side. But to be fair, I was realllly hungry when I arrived.I started with the tempura-flaked shishito peppers. I enjoyed these a lot, even though several times a particularly hot pepper left me panting and nearly incapacitated. Shishio peppers are not for the faint of tongue. Anyway, I liked that the tempura was in flake form and enhanced but didn't completely overwhelm the flavor of the pepper. My friend had the pork croquettes and the braised pork belly. I thought the croquettes were great, but didn't love the pineapple sauce on the pork belly.Since I'm trying to get into the Hawaii mood and islanders' love for spam is a well-known trope, I decided to try the spam agnolotti (burgundy truffles, celery, parmigiano-reggiano cream). There were a lot of distinct flavors in this dish, but I thought they blended together well. It was tangy, earthy, meaty and cheesy-creamy all at once. The truffles were sliced very thinly on top and provided the light, earthy flavor (don't expect that familiar intense truffle-y taste from a burgundy truffle). The tanginess came from something at bottom of the dish, although I'm not quite sure what (artichokes?). The spam, which was minced, was more understated than I thought.Since our trip isn't for another few months, I would definitely consider coming back soon and maybe trying some wine pairings this time.Overall, I thought Noreetuh was a 3.5-star experience and I'd give it that if I could.",3,,
156,Emelyn O.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,147,23,3.0,2/8/2017,"Came for Resto Week, there was a group of four of us and we all ordered from the RW menu but also tried some apps on the regular menu (grilled octopus and wings). The apps (grilled octopus and wings) were probably the best dishes overall. I had the mushroom tempura, cavatelli (with truffles) and the grilled pineapple. The mushroom tempura was fried perfectly but wasn't seasoned at all. The cavatelli was good but not amazing, I had very high hopes for this dish since I went for the added truffle supplement. The pasta was cooked well but it felt like something was missing, my husband had the uni spaghetti and it also felt a little off in regards to flavor combo. The grilled pineapple was delicious! I have been wanting to come here for awhile but had higher hopes for the food. The service was impeccable and our server definitely gave us 4-star service!",,,
157,Vicky L.,"Jersey City, NJ",801,931,459,3.0,10/1/2015,"A-OK is a great way to describe Noreetuh. Self described as korean, hawaiian, japanese fusion, but Vicky described as having the flavors that I am familiar with but not quite executing it well enough to warrant it good fusion food. With these kinds of flavors, I prefer to just have them the good old fashioned korean, or hawaiian, or japanese way.For example - the Crispy Mochi Waffles, Whipped Peanut Butter, Alaea Salt. This was basically the chinese street style rice noodles adapted to a dessert. However, the mochi waffles did not have a good consistency, it was way too chewy. The whipped peanut butter was way too sweet, and although they tried to balance it out with some of that Alaea salt, it just didn't work. I would rather have my ""dai pai dong"" chinese rice noodles any day over this.So I felt this way about many of the dishes on the menu.I think the only thing I liked here were the Kalua Pork Croquettes, which were exactly how croquettes should be - perfectly fried, soft, with a delicious meat filling. Did it have a distinctive korean fusion flavor? No. Was it a good croquette? Yes.I guess what I'm trying to say is that the thought behind the dishes was amazing. I read the menu thinking my socks would be blown off. But, in reality the execution just wasn't there. The flavors didn't work together as a fusion dish as they do prepared in their original way. Just MHO.",3,2,2

Updated review","Exceptional food & service!Came here with a friend for a birthday dinner. We started with the Kalua Pork Croquettes which were absolutely delicious and is a perfect starter before your entree. As an entree we got the Venison for two. It takes about 45 minutes to prepare but definitely worth every minute! The food was overall super delicious and the service was great! Not too overbearing, but made sure everything was okay with us. Definitely recommend coming here and I would love to come here brunch on a Saturday or Sunday!",3,2,3

Everything was excellent and full of flavor - I thought that being a Hawaiian place, the food would be sweet like the pizza... I couldn't be more wrong. The only downside is that they don't have a liquor license yet, only beer and wine for now but I would definitely come back for the food. Highly recommend!",,,

It was definitely a great starter and I highly recommend it and I have to go back to try the other starters for sure.For the main dish, we ordered the venison for two. It takes 45 minutes to cook but well worth the wait.  The server will come out with the venison to show you that it's under the process and when it comes out, it's separated for two. 2 pieces each person served with my favorite, heirloom tomatoes. Each bite was mesmerizing. The service was very very on point. Everyone was polite and friendly. We weren't drinking so we didn't really need to be checked up as often but everyone was nice. The manager was very catering and he made sure everything was smooth. I heard they have a pretty awesome brunch menu so will definitely be back to check that out.The prices are very fair and so are the portions. The decor is really nice and the restaurant is very very clean (a important factor to be taken into consideration).

167,Priscilla C.,"Davis, CA",193,348,1736,4.0,9/14/2016,"Came here to celebrate my birthday with my gfs. The restaurant seemed pretty small from the outside and I didn't see a name. I only saw the number 128 on a black awning. They have more seating in the back, which is where we sat. They had a regular dinner menu, a la carte or a pre fixed menu where you can choose a snack, starter and entree for $42. If you wanted the uni tofu, you had to add an additional $10. We all chose to order the pre fixe. Most of us chose the uni tofu which was pretty damn good. The tofu really had a silk texture and the uni was sweet, fresh and delicious. I chose the taro chips for snack. It was only okay. I wasn't too impressed. For starters, we chose the shrimp poke, tuna poke, and octopus. I thought the shrimp was fresh and flavor was pretty good, but my friend thought it was too salty. The tuna was delicious. I should have ordered the tuna, but I got the octopus which was okay. It's kind of what you expect, grilled octopus. Didn't really have much flavor to it. As for entrees, most of us picked the spaghetti which I thought was pretty good. It had a pretty creamy texture. My friends thought it was also too salty. My other friend ordered the black Angus and she said that was too salty, but I didn't think so. My other friend ordered the spam agnolotti and that was my least favorite. It was pretty much flattened pasta dough with spam inside. The desserts were pretty good. The tapioca one (pic posted) was yummy :) All in all, I would come back but probably try other dishes.",1,2,1

That was really good, but also something that arguably shouldn't be the standout dish in a (almost) fancy restaurant. The uni with silky tofu was not up my alley so I'll pass on commenting that. The pasta with pulled pork was weird - I get it's a fusion dish, but the pasta was still overcooked and kinda drowning in liquid. Also not sure the flavors - smokiness of the pork and cheese on the pasta - really worked that well together. Still, good effort.",1,,

If you want BIG portions of fried items, get the crispy mushrooms!Entree: The pasta was highlight of the night. My fiancé got the Chow Noodles (only vegetarian option) and she equally loved them.Dessert: Chocolate Haupia Sundae was great- the pieces of chocolate hit the spot and were like bombs of flavor in your mouth. My fiancé got the Tristar Strawberries with generous amounts of mochi- I wasn't a fan but she liked it!",3,,
170,Amanda C.,"San Francisco, CA",1273,1264,5301,4.0,6/30/2015,"This was my second favorite spot that I went to during my NYC trip. Though I am not sure how much I paid because my team paid for it, I enjoyed many of the dishes. We had everything on our preset menu. They were also very accommodating and offered many variety for vegetarians because my co-worker left full and satisfied.Snacks-- Truffle taro chips: one of my favorite dishes because I killed it quick lol. The taro chips were thin, so they didn't fill me up before the main courses, and the truffle complemented the chips very well.- Crispy mushrooms with sweet miso sauce: usually not a fan of mushrooms, but this one tasted delicious all crispy with the sauce - definitely recommend to order if you're a mushroom fan.- Spicy gobo: Not a fan of mushrooms so this dish was ok to me. Everyone around me loved it because it wasn't heavy, and the crispiness and sauce paired with the mushroom as the salad was a bit hit for my table.- Kombu chips: This was probably my least favorite snack that we got. It is seaweed that's made into chips with a spicy flavoring - it had an odd taste to it, which I was not digging. Starters-- Hearts of palm, beets, crispy shallots, cilantro, and smoked tofu: also wasn't a fan of the smoked tofu. It had a very familiar taste, but I'm usually not into anything into this dish so I tried it and passed on it.- Big-eye tuna poke: This was my favorite of the starters. It was very tasty and flavored well. The tuna melted in my mouth, yum!- Kalua pork croquettes: Nothing really special about this but that it is like pork dipped in katsu sauce. Mains-- Chow noodles: Probably my favorite dish of the mains - noodles were soft and the veggies were good.- Halibut: soft and tasty fish with good flavoring, but it wasn't something that stood out to me or special.- Pineapple braised pork belly: tasted good but it was very fatty, which I am not usually a fan of, but it was rich in flavor.Desserts-- Macadamia nut brownie with coconut ice cream: the brownie was a bit hard, but I really liked the coconut ice cream.- Bruleed Pineapple: I liked this one best out of both desserts because it was different. It had a sugar glaze on top of half a pineapple, like the sugary layer on top of creme bruelee! Though it was just pineapple underneath it, it was different and delicious.Definitely recommend :) The pinot noir was also good there because it didn't have a strong aftertaste!",5,1,2

Service: 5 starsFood: 3.75Ambience/decor: 5 Our waitress Allia (?) was amazing, warm, professional and kind. We were reset promptly for every course, kindly guided through the menu, and had just the right amount of conversation with her. Everyone else, from the busboys to the host, was also great. (It also didn't hurt that I bartend at a Patina Group restaurant, and one of the chefs used to work for Lincoln Ristorante)The ideas behind the food were all really good, but not everything succeeded. Tuna Poke:By far the most delicious thing we had that night. Pretty fresh tuna, marinated in a vinegary liquid with all sorts of things, like seaweed, folded in. The dish was intricate, tangy, delicious, and kept us coming back until the last bite. Monkfish Liver Torchon:The overall dish, with the passion fruit compote and the soft King's Hawaiian bread was good but not great. Everything together was much too sweet, and the liver paté itself was just blah. Spam Agnolotti:My least favorite dish of the night. The taste of preserved lemon overwhelmed everything, and I didn't find the spam to be ""transformed"" as some yelpers suggested. Mentaiko Spaghetti:So so so so good. That smoked butterfish just works so well, and the buttery (but not creamy) sauce was beyond addictive. Bread pudding:Yummm. Sweet and warm bread pudding balanced out with rum raisin and tart pineapple ice cream. Drinks:His gruner was wonderful. My rosé was just ok.

There was an optional wine pairing for $25 but I did not select this option. I can't speak much to Hawaiian cuisine, but seemed as if Noreetuh was a modern, fusion twist on the traditional. Many complex flavors and profiles was much appreciated. Small serving sizes made you leave feeling good about yourself (e.g., not bloated), though also left with an un-bloated wallet (read: semi-high prices). We added an additional appetizer and I would recommend all three: 1. Big-eye tuna poke2. Two specials of the day, 1 was a salmon sashimi that had a flavorful 'crust' was interestingly paired with tomato raisins. The other was a white fish crudo served with strawberries! Entrees:The butterfish and spaghetti entree was very good, and although carb-heavy did not feel like too muchThe mochi-crusted bass was tender with a crunchy coating served over green beans and ""chinese bacon""..not sure what that means but it was good.DessertKing's Hawaiian Bread Pudding-very good, the rum-soaked raisins were definitely drunk!Bruleed Pineapple- a lighter dessert, served less than a quarter of a pineapple with bruleed sugar.

176,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",289,244,358,4.0,5/16/2015,"I don't like Spam. Sometimes living with someone who likes those cans of pre-cooked meat can be tough. Whenever I see a Spam can blankly blinking back at me from our kitchen counter, I internally scream and push it into one of the cabinets. If I get asked a, ""Wait, where did the Spam go?"" I usually respond with an innocent-looking shrug and a surge in interest in whatever I happen to be doing at the time. So, I was reluctant to come here because my narrow-mindedness made me just assume that Hawaiian-inspired food would mean a lot of Spam dishes. Well, I'm here to tell you that I liked it. I'm also here to tell you that there was only one Spam dish on the menu. Hawaiian food is so much more than Spam!! A lot of the dishes here were influenced by Japanese, Korean, and Filipino cuisines, and everything we tasted was fresh and balanced. Yum. Plates were on the smaller side, but we left pretty stuffed after a snack each, a starter to share, an entree each, and a dessert to share.  -corned beef tongue musubi with cilantro and peanuts: This was their take on the classic spam musubi. The glaze was the perfect level of sweetness and the beef tongue incredibly tender. I loved the bits of peanuts in this! It really added dimension; each bite was satisfying.  -spicy gobo with wood ear mushroom and bellflower root: I was looking forward to this dish since I assumed it'd be similar to kinpira gobo (braised burdock) which I love. Unfortunately, it was a little too sweet for me and was eerily similar to the taste of seaweed salad. It wasn't the slightest bit spicy and this is coming from someone who cannot tolerate spice! The gobo was also cut into long thin shreds, and eating it from a bowl with forks was messy and unsuccessful, so chopsticks would have been appreciated.  -big-eye tuna poke with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapeño, and seaweed: Delicious! This was a well-balanced medley of ingredients that was texturally interesting, and was by consequence very beautiful and vibrant. It also didn't leave me wanting rice. The tuna was fresh and its natural taste was maintained. -chow noodles with morels, asparagus, pea tendrils: This dish confirmed the chefs' interest in using the freshest ingredients while being mindful of texture. These chow noodles, thankfully, were presented with chopsticks by their side. A decent portion of wide noodles were tossed with a heavy dose of sesame oil and soy sauce, and then combined with fantastic bites of ridgy morels, tender asparagus, and crunchy pea tendrils.  -spam agnolotti with ramps, honshimeji, green almond, bonito flakes: The dancing bonito flakes were a curious addition, but ended up being a good one because the agnolotti was surprisingly as sweet as squash (even almost had that consistency), and I was surprised at myself for liking it so much.   -king's hawaiian bread pudding with rum raisins, pineapple ice cream: Fantastic.Wine pairings started at $35 and corkage fees were $15. Wines were sold by the glass at very reasonable prices. The list was short, but a variety of types and regions were covered. Along with sake and soju, there were also draft beers and bottles. The Badass Quite a Pear hard cider was phenomenal, by the way.Likelihood of another visit:This casual, cozy restaurant had such warm service and delicious food! They also gave us Japanese gummies with our check. I'd love to come back to try almost everything I ate here.",10,6,8
177,Stephanie H.,"Vancouver, Canada",31,20,6,5.0,7/18/2015,"You walk in to a nice modern restaurant with dim candle lighting. We ordered the beef tongue masubi as an appetizer and the big eye tuna poke as a starter. I think they are good but not great. Even then, the portions are good (not large) and best for sharing between 2-3 people. The best part is the entree. I had the Garlic shrimp on rice and it comes with pineapples. It brought me back to the shrimp truck experience in Hawaii...seriously!! My husband had the pork belly and it was definitely slow cooked for a good long while, everything was tender and juicy. I had Mochi waffle for dessert and that was a good way to end the meal. I'd like to see them do a good loco moco in the future. I guess I don't need to go to Brooklyn for Hawaii food now ;)Ps - bathroom is a 1 stall only but very spacious and clean!",2,1,1

And I saw it online it waOrdered taro chips, silken tofu and musubi for the snacks and asparagus for starter pork belly and agnolotti for main. The staff is super friendly and nice. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Otherwise it only deserve 2. Like the taro chips. When I first saw it I was like look at this overpriced chips. But once I had it I just can't stop eating that! really good. The silken tofu with uni and ikura is the worst, I actually was pretty interested in this dish. They didn't clean the sea urchin properly, and still have that weird flavor, which should be rinsed off before they serve it. It just ruin the entire dish. Disgusting. How can you mess up with uni? The asparagus is underwhelming. They served it with chopped egg and Chinese sausage, don't like the green asparagus part, taste kind of bitter. The pork belly is ok, smells delicious just the meat can be more juicy. The agnolotti with spam filling is horrible, they should really learn how to make pasta before put that spam filling inside. The spam filling taste like canned cat food. The overall appearance looks ok when they first come because it was covered with bonito flakes. But the pasta just looks horrible and don't taste good.The server is really nice, we are unhappy with out seat at the first and they switched us to a bigger table immediately. Really touched.",1,3,1

Updated review","Hawaiian fusion and much more. Wonderful brunch. Perfect Lychee Bellini to start. BIg Eye Poke bowl was perfect as was the musubi . Every dish was full of flavor. The food is creative and special and you can taste it in every bite. Looking forward to next visit.Went back for dinner. Had a variety of snacks, starters and main dishes. All were unique fresh and flavorful. Kabochi squash tempura, Kalua pork cavatelli, teriyaki chicken like you've never had it before). Just a great meal paired with a good wine which was recommended. Still more to try .",,,
181,Melissa C.,"Seattle, WA",111,618,289,4.0,6/28/2015,"Appetizers we ordered included the spicy gobo, silken tofu with uni, monkfish liver torchon, and tuna poke. The monkfish liver was surprisingly the group's favorite. It's very similar to pate and was delicious. The tuna poke and tofu with uni were also great.Of the entrees, my favorite was the mochi-crusted halibut which was cooked just right. Others preferred the pineapple braised pork belly. The most disappointing was the spam agnolotti, which didn't taste like much of anything.For dessert, we shared the bruleed pineapple and the crispy mochi waffles, which were both so tasty and fun to eat. I'd also recommend checking out their Rieslings, as we shared one that was fantastic.",1,,1
182,Denise W.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",110,182,1190,3.0,6/25/2015,"Excited to try this new Hawaiian-inspired food and see what it is all about. We even had someone who was a native Hawaiian to chime in with our group.For larger parties, you can make a reservation which was nice for the 7 of us. The wine list was pretty extensive and the waitstaff were good resources to ask about the wines. I ended up also getting a pear cider as they have 4 craft beers and a cider on draught as well.Service was very attentive with two individuals constantly cleaning off tables, giving us fresh plates, refilling our water, and pouring the bottles of wine.We ordered a bunch of dishes, all to share so that we could try everything.SNACKS:We started with the Truffled Taro Chips which was amazing and had so much truffle flavor on each chip.The Corned Beef Tongue Musubi came next and it was wrapped with some flavorless green cilantro sauce and whole peanuts. It was also difficult to keep the rice and peanuts from squishing out after every bite. I secretly wished it was SPAM I was biting into. At least season it... will ya?The Silken Tofu with Uni, Ikura, and Shitake puree was a winner. It was well composed, flavorful, and fresh tasting. STARTERS:The Grass-fed Beef Tartare was boring and bland. You had some small fried greasy wonton chips to put it on. There was this weird light yellow paste on the side that didn't taste like anything either. We did not finish this dish at all.The Octopus Poke was great! The textures were well balanced and the fingerling potatoes gave the dish some depth. The octopus was tender and saltiness of the tobiko brought out the flavors of the sea.The Kalua Pork Croquettes were a miss. It was these fried discs of indeterminate mushy filling inside. The cabbage underneath is just for decoration. The Katsu sauce to dip tasted very generic.The Big Eye Tuna Poke was middle of the road for us. Decently tossed with a variety of seaweed and fresh tasting with the nicely pickled jalapeno but still a bit bland again.The Monkfish Liver Torchon was delightful. It melted in your mouth and the composition of all the flavors worked really well together. It came with mini fluffy white toast.MAINS:The Mentaiko Spaghetti with the butterfish was a good transitional starchy dish that we were craving at this point. It was nicely cooked al dente with a very slight kick to brighten the senses.The Mochi-Crusted Halibut was flaky and nicely seared. I'm not sure where the mochi comes in. It just looked like seared fish with no crust. There was a nice creamy sauce on top with some bok choy on the bottom.The Duck Breast was a let down. We think it was prepared sous vide but was overdone. All the slices were cooked to grey medium well to well done, no pink at all. The apricot kernels that was scattered around didn't work with the dish and the hardness of it was a distractor. The Li Hing Mui is an orange plum that also felt like it was ""just there"" and didn't cohesively work with the dish.The Pineapple Braised Pork Belly was nice and tender. It was easy to break apart and we all had a taste. The size was very small though and I wouldn't consider it a main.DESSERT:The Bread Pudding was good with golden raisins and pineapple ice cream.The Brûléed Pineapple was a cold quarter chunk of pineapple with a brûléed sugar crust on top dusted with sea salt. Some liked it and half of us didn't. I didn't like how cold it was but the sea salt was a nice touch to bring out the sweetness of the pineapple.Overall, some good dishes while the misses are just because it was boring or wasn't well composed. I guess we had higher expectations going in but while it was generally good, it's nowhere near the top of my list for a place to return to anytime soon. Hopefully, they'll get to work out some of these kinks.",1,,1
183,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",515,467,1964,3.0,4/21/2015,"I can't say I'm completely thrilled about Noreetuh even if it was opened by three per-se alum. I was really hoping that they would take me back to my trip to Hawaii.Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and the restaurant is definitely small. Luckily it wasn't crowded when we arrived at 7pm which confused me because according to OpenTable, the restaurant was booked solid till 10pm -- weird!Either case, the service was very high end and you do feel a sense of sophistication. Our server was delightful and attentive. However I can't say the same for the food.We ordered their truffled taro chips and it was somewhat boring. I get that the taro chips had sprinkled black truffles on top but for me it's pointless if you can't taste it.As for their spicy gobo, I thought it was good but being categorized as a snack instead of a side dish didn't make sense, especially if eaten independently on its own.We also ordered their silken tofu and visually it was beautiful and artfully put together but taste wise, it was bland and sparing. The only thing I really enjoyed were the three uni. As for the silken tofu, I think it's only about half an inch high, which is practically nothing if served in a small bowl that is about the size of my palm.The corned beef tongue musubi was okay. It wasn't packed tightly so the rice kept on falling out and the peanut with cilantro paste was bland and didn't add any additional flavor to the beef tongue or the rice.As for the big eyed tuna, I thought it was good but it's not something I care to order again. I had the same dish when I was in Hawaii at a supermarket and even that being prepared there tasted better. Perhaps quality wise, Noreetuh will surpass a supermarket but taste-wise it failed.Lastly we had their braised honeycomb tripe and I felt the dish was too saucy and salty. As a result, I couldn't really taste the tripe nor the rice cake. Instead the dish just tasted like one big flavor instead of multiple flavors being put together as one.Overall, I wish this restaurant luck but unfortunately I feel they did not deliver the Hawaiian taste that I was expecting.",2,2,1

Truffled Taro Chips2. Big Eyed Tuna Poke - tasted great with the above! 3. Garlic shrimp - mouthwatering morsels of garlicky goodness!Overall, wonderful food with great flavors and presentation but way overpriced for the portion size.

185,Irene H.,"New York, NY",207,1154,297,3.0,8/30/2015,"My dining companions may stumble on this review. I recommend coming here with adventurous eaters without dietary restrictions. One friend doesn't eat pork; both were turned off by beef tongue.We walked in on Friday around 7pm without a reservation. Despite it being August, another restaurant was packed solid by 6:30pm. In the East Village. They only sat the 3 of us when the party was full but after we were seated there was a guy that was seated at the table next to us. His dining companion didn't arrive for a while.- I had the beef tongue musubi on my own. I liked it. Nice play on spam musubi. There were nuts? that added to the texture.- Mushroom tempura w/ aioli - excellent- Fried shishito peppers - ok.- Taro chips with truffle - good. Get it.- Octopus poke - I liked it. My friends said it was fishy.- Tuna poke - Fine too but I liked the octopus more.- Garlic shrimp - Hmm... this should've been better. Not garlicky enough. Pineapple wasn't ripe and sweet enough. Nowhere near the North shore shrimp trucks.- Mentaiko pasta. One friend liked it. My taste buds felt muddled - it wasn't that good to me. **Edit - I had it again and stand by my decision**- Mochi waffle dessert with peanut butter and honey. The waffle wasn't good on its own. And the peanut butter didn't make it much better. - Chocolate haupia sundae was ok. I would've liked it more with less graham cracker.Service was excellent. I'm not itching to return any time soon but will definitely do some research before the next visit and bring someone people who are more adventurous. I totally wanted to try the spam agnolotti. In general, I love Hawaiian food but felt like it lacked something.",,,
186,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,310,69,4.0,3/30/2016,"Dined at Noreetuh last weekend and had a very tastebud-shaking experience. I was excited to try Hawaiian food, and while many of the dishes were quite good, not all of them worked for me. The awesome:Glazed pork bellyMonkfish liver with passion fruitButterfish spaghetti The just OK:Truffle taro chips King's Bread puddingThe not-so-awesome:Silken tofu with Uni The monkfish liver was probably my favorite dish of the night. The savory flavor and smooth texture of the liver worked perfectly with the sweet passion fruit. The pork belly was also delicious and cooked to perfection, and the spaghetti was a totally unexpected and delightful melding of flavors. You've never had spaghetti like this! The truffle taro chips and bread pudding were less special. The chips tasted like something you could get at Whole Foods, and the bread pudding was a bit too firm and luke warm for me. The pineapple ice cream it was served with was also cloyingly sweet. I struggled with the silken tofu. I know this is one of their most popular dishes, so perhaps it's just me, but I felt it was almost too fishy. The uni, which I typically enjoy, overpowered the dish, and the tofu was just a little too watery for my liking. The service was impeccable.Overall, I'm glad I tried a new cuisine and would definitely come back to experience more of the menu, but I didn't leave as satisfied as I'd hoped.",2,4,1

188,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,6/17/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10Noreetuh (meaning ""playground"" in Korean) is a new Hawaiian restaurant in East Village from chef Chung Chow, who was sous-chef at the venerable Per Se. You would expect a haute cuisine place from a chef of this pedigree, but what chef Chow is showcasing pays homage to his root from Hawaii, with a lot of Asian elements. I was overall pleased with the playful food offerings from the kitchen.Many of the dishes have inspirations and displays that are fun and employ diverse influences and elements. For snacks, the silken tofu that came with uni, ikura, shiitake and shiso writes Japanese all over its place and was quite pleasant. I was delighted with the way peanuts have been used in some dishes to further enhance the texture. For instances, peanuts worked well together inside the corned beef tongue musubi, as it did for pineapple braised pork belly that came with yams and mustard greens. The pork was cooked quite tender and worked nicely with the crunchy peanuts that, combined with sweet flavor, created a delicious dish. Big-eye tuna poke also came with macadamia nuts, pickled jalapeno and seaweed to create a refreshing starter. The only letdown was the spam agnolotti, which despite the promise of spam, didn't feel as put together as I had hoped. For dessert, bruleed Hawaiian pineapple didn't look like much but provided a refreshing finish to the meal with understated sweet crunch.Getting a reservation doesn't seem particularly difficult, although the restaurant was by no means empty in the course of my meal. I liked the modern, fun vibe of East Village at the dining area. There is no cocktail, but the restaurant has some pretty unique wine selections that are carefully selected by general manager Jin Ahn. I'm by no means an expert to Hawaiian cuisine (until my visit, I really had no idea how to define it), but the food coming out from Noreetuh is fun and worth checking out.",1,,

There were also pieces of fish in every bite, I literally cleaned the whole plate. I also ordered the tempura veggies and loved every bite of it.

I was also glad I had a HUGE lunch maybe 4 hours before hand otherwise I would need like 4 plates to get full maybe (if I had come in hungry haha).

192,Joyce C.,"Long Island City, NY",52,235,3112,4.0,4/9/2015,"The only words I can use to describe noreetuh are with adjectives- pretty adjectives: woodsy, oceany seawater, smokey, umami, chewy, comforting. After food gawking from a Gothamist article about noreetuh, I somehow made the decision that I HAD to get there before it blows up. Plus they had poke! Including some truffle & sea urchin on the menu, thought it was all an interesting mix, super excited that they have a ""Hawaiian-inspired"" menu. Noreetuh takes reservations, but it seems to have been very busy since opening. For a table, I'd say you'll need to book 1-2wks in advance. They have 6 bar stools for walk-ins. The Boy and I went at 6:30 on a Wednesday, zero wait and got a cozy spot at the front section of the bar. The front door host was extremely nice and the staff was Very attentive all night; making sure water glasses were filled & plates coming out in perfect timing. The restaurant itself is very small, holding exactly two tables for 2, two for 4, one large table for 4-5, and a round large booth in the back room (seemed like the guests at the back table were regualrs). Even though seating is limited, it has a nice relaxed feel though, you don't feel cramped, and the lighting and industrial minimal wood dark gray design creates a warm & cool atmosphere, if that makes sense. They turned up the 80's R&B later in the night (MJ & Monica!). Large single bathroom too. A guy that looked like one of the Owner's brother came in and his brother pulled a stool up to the bar for him, for a glass of cider and app. The was another diner there that had a 'famous' aura to him, dining at a large table, looked a little like Adrien Brody, but with light brown man bun well-conditioned curls. Can't put my finger on him.. The food: total about $95$12 Glass of red wine, soucherie$12 Silken Tofu, Uni (sea urchin), Ikura (Salmon Roe), Shitake paste, shiso leaves: seawater meets the woods. umami. I didn't know what to expect, but it was a great combination of the creaminess of the tofu (about an 1"" deep), salt of the Uni & broth/soy on top, bright bursts of the roe, and a little kick of shiso. I do wish there was a little more light to see what we were eating, asked the bartender what the brown paste was. It was like the most dense mushrooms compote you'll ever eat. Nice contrast. Highly recommend.$11 Truffle Taro Chips: salty paper thin taro chips with black truffle shavings. I tasted more salt than truffle, but then I'm not exactly versed in truffle flavor. The Boy said that it's mild, like an aromatic vanilla after taste. He approved.$17 Big-eye tuna poke, mac nuts, jalapeño, seaweed, red onion: decent portion for poke. I could only eat half of it- too much rawness for me- perfect to share, but the tuna cubes were extra fresh- didn't taste too much marinade after the first bite (sesame oil drizzle used?) I think the jalapeño and bits of red onion made up for it, but after a while the heat from the jalapeño took over. We cut up the large bits of yellow seaweed, it provided a nice textural contrast. Were there some fennel leaves in there? It was good but I probably wouldn't get this again as the jalapeño was overpowering in the end.$17 Spam tortellini, poached egg, Chinese broccoli rabe, goji berries, white slightly bitter aerated cream sauce: excellent & inventive. Warm and comforting. The tortellini was fresh & were handmade little puffs of cheese & spam purée with a few larger pieces of spam. The pasta noodle part was chewy and hearty. I only got to only try a bite of this main since it wasn't mine, but it looked great- breaking the egg & mixing it in a little and the touch of chinese greens also.$16 Chow noodles, shitake, smoked tofu, jalapeño, broiled lily flower, bean sprouts, cilantro, scallion: Smokey. That's what I got from it. The handmade noodles were hearty and had a nice chew. I'm not quite sure if I listed all of the ingredients in this dish- there were so many contrasting, yet hearty flavors. I wanted to lay them out separately on the dish & take a pic, but that would be Way too Yelp of me for the Boy. The broiled lily flowers were a nice surprise and gave a sort of bamboo shoot like texture. Generous amounts of shitake and tofu. The tofu wasn't that gross dried smoked tofu that you find tossed upon the tops of $3 noodles, it was moist, flexible as the shitake, but meatier. I'm guessing made in house or from a high quality place. This dish seemed very Malaysian or Chinese inspired. Overall, a nice fancee but casual dining experience. Slightly high for my price range, but the main dishes where definitely worth it. The overall quality shows in the food & execution. Good luck to the chefs and owners!PS. Not sure if they added to the decor because of a Yelper's comment. But not a fan of the laser-printed canvases that they had up. Dumbs it down. Stay with the natural minimal themes please! Maybe a honeycomb wood panels, small ceramic objects, or little flat versions of your gold pineapple.",2,,

194,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11,4.0,2/24/2016,"I don't know anything about Hawaiian food. Other than the pizza, which doesn't even hail from the aloha state, Hawaiian cuisine isn't particularly pervasive in these parts. Attracted by several months of buzz, I finally made my way here! It's definitely an upscale take on the cuisine but I'll take any iteration I can.The sleek and minimalist decor along with the dim lighting and small-but-not-too-small space lends itself well to intimate gatherings of the romantic or platonic nature. Here with my boo, we were seated immediately thanks to reservations, and by the looks of it, I'd recommend making them.The menu quickly illustrated Hawaiian cuisine's interesting fusion of Polynesian and other various Asian cooking. For appetizers, we ordered the Silken Tofu and very popular Big-eye Tuna Poke. The tofu was topped with salmon roe, uni, and something sweet I couldn't identify. While I enjoyed the combined silky texture of everything and small bursts of flavor from the roe, the dish was a little too light on flavor. The tuna poke, on the other hand, was not. Slightly spicy, citrusy, and probably some other flavors I can't recall, the tuna mixed with seaweed and pickled jalapeños was so good. I loved how large the chunks of tuna were rather than being delicate slices too.For my main, I went with the mentaiko spaghetti with smoked butterfish. At first, I was worried it wasn't going to be enough food but the creamy fish roe sauce that coated the spaghetti did the trick. The entire dish was deliciously smoky and the heaping pile of aonori added a nice, if subtle, contrast to everything else. (Writing this while hungry was a bad idea.) My boyfriend ordered the pineapple glazed pork belly and the bite I had was really good. It was perfectly cooked and sweet without being too sweet. He loved it. After we ate our itty bitty complimentary shortbread cookies and paid the bill, we left more than satisfied with the food, service, and overall experience. Recommended!",3,1,2

The decor is modern with nice touches that remind you that you're at a Hawaiian restaurant. The service is great and the wait staff are prompt with beverages/refills. The food is right up my alley. Ordered the silken tofu which was perfectly complimented with salty sea urchin roe, the shrimp starter was fresh and light with the right amount of crunch from scallions. Pork belly was nicely seasoned and reminded me of Chinese 5 spice rub. The one dish that had me thrown was the cold buckwheat noodles. I ordered it on a whim and couldn't be more surprised on how much I liked it. Perhaps it was a nice cold dish on a hot summer day or the perfect seasoning and balance of dashi but overall amazing.

The poke without saying, you need to try. The highlight however is the monkfish liver. So unique and so interesting. And so yummy. If you've never had this, then you MUST come here and try it. It has a flavor reminiscent of blue claw crab guacamole if you know what that is. The noodles are amazing as well. Definitely coming here again.",1,,

The sommelier or owner or whomever it was, was energetic and smiling. He randomly chose some wines for us that went nicely with our meal. Standouts above all else were the musubi. We had a corn special and the regular beef tongue from the menu. Better than expected. Shrimp Poké followed-just a little over salted but palatable and tasty. Then we had cod and chow fun. Flavors were great.  Both cooked perfectly.Nothing knocked me off my seat but it was a good meal. If you don't have all the regulars lined up on a NYC visit, do this place. It's worth it.",,,
198,Ian A.,"Massapequa, NY",92,86,2,4.0,8/4/2016,"Was good food, but I am not sure it stands out for the price they are charging. Had the shrimp poke app, it was good but tasted like an enhanced shrimp salad.Had the Octopus app, that was good, but one of the three pieces was very tough. The bass entree was good. The fish was cooked to perfection, soft and delicate with crispy skin. For dessert I had the ice cream sunday that was very good. Nice mixture of sweet and salty, but not too sweet at all. The staff was phenomenal. Everyone was helping each other out. I saw one guy who was bringing food out, cleaning tables, bringing new silverware after each serving, going behind the bar to grab drinks. Love the team effort.The food was good but not sure it measured up to the high prices (17$ Octopus app).",,,
199,Ke D.,"Manhattan, NY",223,74,0,4.0,8/26/2016,"This seemingly-small place actually has another seating area in the back with a lovely, intimate (maybe too intimate - tables are quite close together) atmosphere. I went for restaurant week although they actually have the 3-course menu already!The big eye tuna poke was fantastic. We shared the cold buckwheat noodles and mochi-crusted bass - the bass was great and the noodles were delicious and interesting, but neither were so mindblowing.To be honest, I think I'd give this place a 3-star since the prices are a tad high for the rather small portions and inflated expectations, BUT the bread pudding was my favorite ever!!Would return for pudding.",,,
