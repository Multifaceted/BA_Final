0,Ava F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,33,20,5.0,10/8/2018,"This was our SPOT while in school, on a budget, but in need of brunch/ breakfast or anything to spend time with friends. They have both a counter that you can order from, and tables that you can get served at depending on what you want. They also deliver in a timely fashion, always handy on Sunday mornings :) They are so accommodating with the menu, if you have dietary restrictions they will happily swap out an ingredient or two. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict but wanted them scrambled instead, and they happily changed that for her. Don't go there if you want anything fancy, expensive or trendy. Sunburst is just a staple for affordable meals, a good time, and the service is always great. People are always nice, with a smile on their faces and as a college student in NYC this was honestly a great find. The prices are always great, you can get away with coffee and brunch for under 15$ easily, and there is no detriment to the quality of the food. I believe some dishes also come with a side of toast, so you really get your money's worth. My personal favorite thing: the huge mugs they serve coffee in during breakfast and brunch. I don't know why, it just made it feel like you are in your friend's kitchen enjoying a meal and we really liked it.",1,,

It is kind of tight in here but they do have wifi which is awesome.As for the food it wasn't anything special. The Chicken caesar salad was as straightforward as it gets. It wasn't bad but nothing memorable.  My guests salad looked ok and he shared the same sentiment I did. It was good not great. The service was prompt and friendly. Idk if I would come out of my way to come back here.  However, if I needed to catch up on work and grab a quick meal I would come back.",18,5,10

Wide variety of items on the menu (came around late lunch time, they were still serving breakfast menu plus the lunch/dinner menu). Waiter was very nice, service was good. We sat outside and it was fun to people watch! I got a tuna melt which was okay. I wish the cheese was more melty or I should've requested pepper jack cheese. The fries were very yummy though. My bf got penne with vodka sauce and it was quite good. It looked so delicious that someone walking by asked us what it was! Both entrees came with a salad option, we got caesar salad and it was very good. great prices too, very affordable. I also got a latte (yum) and he got a smoothie.",2,,

9,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,4.0,11/26/2017,"Sunburst is a less-casual-than-Starbucks breakfast place with both counter and waiter service and great food. Mostly filled with families and couples who live in the area, so it's the kind of neighborhood spot that locals go to to eat quickly. As soon as we sat down, our extremely sweet waitress with the cutest Jamaican accent, Vivian, asked us if we'd like free coffee. Um yes! Available until 11:30am, and they have almond milk. It was just dark enough, so I really enjoyed it. I got the Eggs Nova, which is two cooked eggs and smoked salmon on an English muffin, with potatoes on the side, but able to be substituted for a bunch of options. I got the green salad on the side, and my company got sweet potato fries with his Eggs Florentine. My dish had very little smoked salmon on it, so I wish it had a little bit more, but I enjoyed the eggs and side salad. Eggs Florentine looked like a good one too. Only difference between the two dishes was spinach instead of salmon. Overall, cozy and quiet family-friendly place with good service and reasonable prices. WiFi available as well for you laptop lemurs.",5,3,3
10,Mikael A.,"Suffern, NY",3,20,15,5.0,12/6/2017,"Neighborhood-y diner and coffee shop that does simple things well. This is not a trendy place, but it's a great go-to for a friend or two when you want good quality food at a reasonable price. I often get eggs here and they never disappoint. Their roasted potatoes are delicious too. Their pancakes are amazing, I don't know what they are putting in that batter but I could easily eat 10 of them. They also have unique coffee roast flavors, such as mocha almond, which I usually get. The only bad thing about this place is that if you are sitting outside, they often forget to serve you/forget your order.",3,1,1
11,Jonathan S.,"New York, NY",0,22,0,1.0,10/31/2018,"The food here is good but their delivery service is incompetent.

This is the third time now that they can't get hold of their delivery driver after I waited over 1.5 hrs for delivery 4 blocks away. And then when it arrives Will have to find a new place.",,,
12,Megan A.,"New York, NY",242,5,0,5.0,5/10/2018,"Favorite place to order from on Seamless! Free, fast delivery, and amazing food and coffee. Maybe most impressively is that they deliver to my work (35th and 8), apartment (Houston and Sullvian), and my boyfriend's apartment (6th and A). Seriously they'll deliver anywhere in record time. My go-to orders are their pesto alfredo tortellini (it's seriously some of the best pasta EVER), the breakfast sandwiches, and I always get an iced coffee with soy milk (it's so good). I got an omelette the other day which was great, but the potatoes are AMAZING. I really want to go in person one day!A testament to their epic speed: I ordered today at 2:08 pm on Seamless, and it's already on the way SEVEN MINUTES LATER!!.UPDATE: Arrived in literally 18 minutes from placing an order. HOW DO YOU DO IT?!",6,,

I used to live near the cafe and frequently went there for weekend brunch or afternoon coffee. I sometimes even stopped by after work to study. I still believe this is the best place to study or work as they have WiFi and staff don't bother you at all how long you stay. They are always welcoming and they have many kinds of foods from light snacks to pasta, sandwiches and desserts. Their drink menu has a lot of variety too such as a few kinds of smoothies to Hawaiian coffee. Even after I moved to a different place, I sometimes miss this place and stop by. They have outdoor seats too so you can bring your dog too.",,,
14,Dylan H.,"New York, NY",114,114,44,4.0,11/4/2017,"I come here somewhat regularly. They make good coffee. The food is reasonably priced, and is good. Today I had two eggs over easy with goat cheese, jalapenos, sausages, home fries, and toast. It was fantastic. Amusingly, the waitress wrote my order on the palm of her hand. That's the weakness here. The service staff is sometimes a bit inexperienced and sometimes overloaded. This establishment is more of a coffee shop with a kitchen than a proper restaurant. At times, I have noticed cups not washed as well as one would hope (the old lipstick on the glass thing).Overall, I really like this place. It's a great value and the food is good",5,,
15,Liana H.,"Portland, OR",74,62,64,3.0,1/29/2018,"I badly wanted to love this place, because it is so convenient to my work, but after a few disappointing experiences, I am unsure if I will ever go back. I don't have ridiculous standards, by any means, so I listed the problems that I had below, and you can judge for yourselves:A) I was overcharged by ""accident"" on two separate occasions. Make sure you remind them that coffee is free before 11:30am with a entree purchase as they forget.B) Raw and I mean completely raw mushrooms in an omelette I ordered - couldn't eat it, had to send it back (and I NEVER send back food.)C) Took over 30 mins to get the check after I asked for it. Granted, I forgot for a while as I was working, but still.Plus sides: reasonably priced (if they charge the right prices), and healthy options. Good coffee too.",,,
16,Sarita L.,"New York, NY",6,107,91,1.0,9/18/2018,"I waited 1 hour and 30 minutes for this. After an hour of waiting I called and was told the delivery person just left? The seamless time estimate says 20-30 minutes. As a result I had to change my plans around because I was waiting for food, food that btw was mediocre at best. Bland omelette even with turkey sausage, undercooked potato, stale bread! I've stopped in here a couple times because I live close by and I'm in a rush and the people that work there aren't even pleasant. Now I'm sold on never buying anything from here again. While this may seem harsh to some people guess what reality is the restaurant/food business is harsh especially in New York City. Bad service/food like this drives people to write reviews for a reason.",,,

21,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,2.0,5/4/2018,"Decided to give this place a try last night when my daughter was asking for buttermilk pancakes so I ordered myself an American burger. First off, it's extremely overpriced.....The buttermilk pancakes came with 2 pancakes and nothing else. For $8.50 you'd expect something else on the side for something which costs them about 0.50 to make. The American burger was good, the brioche bun was the best part. I asked for medium but they sent me medium rare. I didn't want mushrooms which they followed. They burger came with lettuce, tomato, raw red onions, and fries.  The toppings were good except the lettuce was extremely wilted. The amount of fries they gave was a ripoff- if you were to put your index and thumb finger together to form a circle, you could fit the number of fries in there. For $14.95, even though the burger was good, I think they should drop the cost and make fries something separate. The cost was high for what you get. I'm not sure if I would eat here again but if I do, it's not going to be any time soon and it's definitely not going to be a regular.",,2,
22,Lauren B.,"Dallas, TX",625,74,64,1.0,10/29/2017,"Did an Uber Eats order for an indulgent breakfast. Ordered the New York Special - bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce with a side of potatoes. Also ordered the Mocha Smoothie.I have done plenty of Uber Eats orders and received quality food. I understand food won't be fresh out of the oven, but there is no reason that the food should taste and look the way mine did.Bagel was gross. New York should do bagels right and this was worse than store-bought. Not toasted at all. Carelessly covered in cream cheese. Smoked salmon was underwhelming. Eggs were way too runny. There was a disgusting puddle saturating the entire dish after cutting into one egg. I'm a big Eggs Benedict fan - So I understand what poached means but this just wasn't good. The Hollandaise sauce was below average and disappointing. Breakfast potatoes were undercooked and had no seasoning or flavor.My mocha ""smoothie"" was a joke. My driver was quick with my order so I'm assuming they just didn't add any ice. Was not good at all.",,1,
23,Sarah B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",638,4,0,2.0,8/20/2018,"I gave 2 stars instead of 1 since they remade my meal to be somewhat edible, so the initiative was there.

The staffs seem to be nice but the service is a little bit slow for a New York standard (Is there such?). Its our first time to be here and when we check the menu it seems it has too many words printed on it. Its too confusing or maybe we are just simple people who just want to have simple breakfast food.We are all got surprised on the size of the coffee mug they served to us. On the menu it says small but whoah thats the biggest 'small' coffee mug I have ever seen. We are not complaining, we actually liked it. :)The food is good, we got what we ordered.

35,Sean B.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",21,68,14,4.0,6/14/2017,"A nice place for a quiet breakfast. With lots of choice for pastries and decent coffee, some times it can be a bit of a hit-and-miss. I guess it depends on who's taking your order and preparing your food. Most days I've got served a well made latte, other days I've been served some weak coffee with a side of milk (even though I ordered the latte).The waffles are very nice, but make sure you give the complete order; when asking for the banana and caramel waffle, if you only say ""can I have the banana waffle"" they will skip the caramel (even though it's on the order). Also, don't expect to get your food very fast even if the place is empty. At times I've even got my food 20 minutes after ordering and it came rather cold, like it was just sitting there for 15 minutes. The staff is welcoming and nice, and the food and coffee is good when you're lucky. Like I said, a bit of a hit-and-miss, but worth it if you're patient",5,,

I defy anyone to ensure a fried egg stays hot that long. In fact, come over and get it yourself and see what happens. Just to finish my caffeine fueled rant, if you are going to complain about the temperature of delivered fried eggs, make your own darn egg for gosh sake. It's not like it's a mysterious recipe or anything. Butter or oil, pan, egg, salt and pepper. Hello!?!I had great, mellow, flavorful espresso with a proper crema. Then, perfectly piping hot and fresh fried eggs, extremely crispy bacon, tasty potatoes, and a boring slice of supposedly rye toast.

55,Valdaniel M.,"Queens, NY",329,5,0,5.0,3/15/2017,"This place is a great little gem on 3rd Ave in the Gramercy area and it has everything you need for a quick breakfast or relaxed, slow brunch. First of all, the food is great with a huge selection from eggs to crepes to burgers to paninis. They even have homemade soups and pastries, not just ""baked on premises"" but actually fabricated from scratch every day. Like a lot of coffee shops, the service is really quick and they have a high turnover rate, but at the same time the little dining room also has a large TV and free wifi, so they don't mind people sipping their lattes and working or just hanging out, which is handy for me because I tend to roost when I find a spot that I like. In my opinion the only downside to Sunburst is that they haven't opened one near where I live in Queens :)",5,,1

Updated review",Great selection of food. Good music. The staff is nice but every single time I order here staying or delivery they always messed up my order. There is not one time they have gotten my order right. I'm always missing something or I get something that I didn't order. When they forget and I tell them they forgot they still forget! Piece of advice for anyone who pick up their order. Make sure you check your bag and see if everything is in there. My last time here. Worst service.,,,
62,Jackii W.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,3/25/2016,"Oddly enough, I had one of the worst service experiences I've ever had in New York in this small, inoffensive looking cafe- and I grew up here.I came in on a Friday afternoon. Place was virtually empty. The guy at the counter kept asking me in an exasperated tone if I was staying or leaving while I was musing over the menu. He barked at me a few times even when he misunderstood my drink order. I stayed polite because, you know, New York can be a grumpy place to serve people.But then he came over to chastise me for getting the drink to go when I decided to stay. I ordered, I kid you not, an iced tea.If you have a policy about table service, then just let me know rather than ask me aggressive and targeted questions about whether I'm staying or going. It's a cafe. I was so shocked I didn't say anything - then he asked something to the effect of, ""did you hear me"" - at which point I just had to walk out.Wow. Whoever you are dude, you need to relax. And whoever runs this business, because that surely cannot be you, should seriously consider reshuffling their staff.",8,,

It was great because the soup came with two biscuits, but the delivery took almost 50 minutes. In regards to the food itself, there was a strange taste to the butternut squash soup. The first couple of bites were great, but after those spoonfuls, it was difficult to eat without the biscuit accompanying each bite. The biscuits, on the other hand, we're great!

However, I went yesterday to have breakfast, eggs Benedict, and it was sooooo good. I love being able to sit there and no one bothers you to hurry up.

My sister got the belgian waffle and I got the eggs benedict. Potatoes are usually just meh to me, but the red potatoes here were amazing. Reasonable price and if you order before 11:30, you get a free coffee or tea of your choice! The amount of tea on the menu would make any tea lover drool. The coffee based drinks are to die for. They were so rich and even though we ordered it iced, you still taste the full flavor. I thought the amount of ice they put in there would have watered it down, but nope! Still packs the full flavor. I got the iced chocolate almond and it was a rich decadent drink where you can taste each flavor. Same goes for my sisters hazlenut cooler.

I think I've learned my lesson and I won't be ordering from here again.For a place that calls themselves an ""Espresso Bar,"" this is some of the worst coffee I've ever tasted. I've tried their regular coffee, a mocha and a cappuccino, and they all taste watered down and flavorless. Now, for their prices. I usually am not down to pay $9 for a basic Caesar salad, unless it's really good. Unfortunately, this one is not. Everything about the salad is the opposite of fresh, and it tastes like it's been sitting in their kitchen all day.Yesterday I decided to order a crepe to give them one last try to see how it would taste---absolutely gross, which is what prompted me to write this review. The crepe was thick, hard and overcooked---the opposite of what a crepe should be. This place is incapable of making decent food or coffee. Will not be ordering from here again.",2,,

There were four people behind the counter and maybe they were changing shifts, not sure what, but I was just watching an empty blender container sit there. I couldn't tell if they were maybe out of fruit or just forgot I was waiting. I finally got rang up for my smoothie and small soup - $14-15. A tad much, but I'll pay for something good. I got back to work and took a sip of maybe one of the worst smoothies I've ever had. Not sure how you can screw up a smoothie. I made all my coworkers try it to confirm.

Unfortunately though, New York operates on delivery, and they've gotten me for my money too many times.

I had a turkey burger on a nice bun with large cut fries, and it came with a good sized Greek salad. Was delicious and for only $10 was worth it. Extra large iced tea was only $2.

There is also some outside seating on the outside corner of the building. Large flat screen on the inside has ESPN when I was there. Not the most aesthetically pleasing decor though, but just ok.

It is open later than most (until 11pm)2. It has a full menu; so you can not only enjoy some coffee a pastry, but also a salad or a panini. 3. You can sit outside (without losing the WiFi)Not a bad deal, is it?

On my last occasion, my brand new credit card wasn't working on their shitty, very old-looking POS system and the person was a dick about it.

Everything from the sweet to the savory and all in between, in one place at reasonable prices. This then seemed like a no-brained as far as an order for Seamless.I want to tell you how amazing this meal was, but, unfortunately I've been waiting an hour and a half and still no delivery. Dozens of calls all go straight to the busy tone. Whatever you do, DO NOT order food from this place.",2,,
116,dewey c.,"Orlando, FL",0,16,0,1.0,10/26/2014,"We gave this place two tries. Last Sunday and this Sunday for brunch. Both times we were appalled at the service. Today, upon arriving, the first thing the man seating us said was ""We are really busy so it might be a while."" After LAST weekend's experience, this was the last thing I wanted to hear.The place was packed. I get that. But there clearly needs to be more servers working the floor. Last week we waited so long for our food that we debated walking out. And once we were done, nobody returned (ever!) to give us our check. I had to walk ip to the counter to ask to pay. Not good at all.Today was much worse. We waited forty minutes for our food and when it came it was stone cold.I once again walked to the counter (this time carrying both playes of cold food) and said to our server, ""I can see that you are working an uphill battle here so lete just return this food and pay for our coffees."" Fortunately, Mandy is a good server who did what she could to appease me in that moment. She is obviously working very hard but with her hands tied. We are big on supporting independent businesses. Especially ones on expensive NYC street corners. They are disappearing quickly and we want them to stay. However, as busy as Sunburst's brunches are, they need not be bold in assuming that it will last forever. Especially when the service is so abysmal. Word WILL get around.Owners: hire a couple more people to assist Mandy. She is an asset. But rethink that rude dark haired guy running your floor. He let us walk out dospleased two wekends in a row. He is a danger to Sunburst's long term success.",2,,

The got our smoothies wrong, then out entrees, then when they gave me my eggs benedict it was in a puddle of water, pretty disgusting. I couldn't even get the English muffin because it was too soaked in water. It's pretty common sense to dry poached eggs off before you plate them. Also- there is a sign at the table asking for reviews on yelp and to text the manager (his number is on the sign) if you had any issues. I sent a text along with a picture of my soupy eggs benedict and didn't hear anything back. I would go to the Smith for breakfast. Much better quality and customer service.",2,1,
121,Chris G.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,30,0,1.0,2/11/2016,Went here to get some work done in between meetings around town. I walked up to the counter but was told I should order at a table if I was staying. It then took them 20 minutes to take my order in a mostly empty place. For some reason they left the door open for 30 minutes while they loaded in groceries...it was the middle of winter and about 10 degrees outside. Then they dropped a check before I was ready to leave and I was told that I needed to pay now because they were changing shifts. 1 of these things would not have ruined the experience but the combo of them all during one visit speaks volumes about how they view their customers. The coffee and croissant were not good enough for me to ever want to come back.,,,

The cafe style vibe and menu looked promising but I wasn't quite sure how to approach the whole ""hybrid"" table service they had going on. It's originally an espresso bar which I assume is counter service, but for food I was told to sit down and they'll get to us. The waiter was nice and upbeat. I ordered the Greek salad and a mango smoothie. The salad came in a cool wavy modern bowl but the salad overall wasn't anything special. The salad pieces were too big and contained mostly yellow crunchy stems instead of leafy greens. The feta cheese and olives were good though. The smoothie was decent size at $4.95. Getting the check was a bit slow and I could see why some other yelpers were frustrated with service. Someone else gave us our check instead of our original server and I think the outside tables may be stretching the staff a bit thin.

The bf had an omelette, and trust me, he's no foodie but even he said that it was very subpar.

The only reason is because the food is JUST good enough to warrant multiple trips. But it's as if this place keeps daring me to test the worst it has to offer, just to see if I'll return. If you want your order to come out right, just get something simple. Don't even THINK of adding one small variation to a boilerplate menu item... It ain't gonna happen. And at the end, make sure to add up the itemized check, the random price generator they use for their meals gets a little out of wack sometimes. As I write this, my rating goes from 3 stars to 2...it's just that frustrating. Just ate there this morning, and throughout the wait for my meal, 5 other tables came, went unattended by the staff, and left without even placing an order.

Again we had to flag someone down to even order a coffee, a cappuccino, and an egg sandwich. Egg sandwich came on an untoasted bagel, and we were told we didn't ask to have it toasted. Seriously?For some reason I stayed when my boyfriend left to work at his office and get food somewhere else. About 2 hours later I ordered a veggie burger that came with soup. Not only was the soup cold, but when I asked them to heat it up, they microwaved it with the croutons still in it. So then it was a bowl of hot mush. Grossss.

The brunch menu is far too extensive to make sense from a business standpoint, not to mention large menus always scare me into thinking that the ingredients are old and even if they were fresh I may choose a dish that isn't often prepared therefore it won't be cooked well. Sure enough my Greek omelette with turkey bacon wasn't anything special. Beyond that this place would greatly benefit from one of those temporary extra doors for the winter.

I ordered the Three Berry Smoothie and the Peaches and Cream smoothie through Seamless. Delivery was very quick, so I have no reason to factor that in to the quality of the smoothies. Second, this is my first Yelp review, ever. I ordered these smoothies last night, drank them (or a combined five sips from both), became sad and vulnerable, went to bed, then woke up this morning and created my Yelp account. The Three Berry Smoothie at least had the essence and quasi-flavor of the listed ingredients, but something wasn't right about it. It wasn't sweet at all, which seemed reasonable at first because I figured an espresso bar isn't the place to go for fresh fruit. However, as I took a few more sips, I realized there was a certain bitterness to the smoothie that I can only describe as possibly coming from the rinds or stems of the various fruits in the smoothie. Imagine the top plug of the strawberry in which the stem and leaves take hold being blended in with everything else - my only guess is that they just put whole strawberries into the blender. As for the peaches and cream, I honestly can't describe it considering I threw it out after one sip. Again, bitterness abound and no sweetness in this one, but it didn't even have peach flavor. It seems they blended some fleshy yellow plant mass with milk and water to create this concoction, which I can say with confidence was the most confusing smoothie experience I have ever had. TL;DR - I ordered the Three Berry Smoothie and the Peaches and Cream Smoothie for delivery and I would strongly advise against it.",,,

The service here is dreadful. I mean dreadful. And I'm not a person who uses the word dreadful. It takes at least an hour and a half to have a quick bite. The servers are just in their own world. And god only knows what goes on in that kitchen. Why does it take 20 minutes for me to get my cup of tea? But the cup is so cute. You know the big, funky kinds that only cool big city cafes serve their tea in. How does one stay mad when your tea comes in such a cool mug? The free wifi also results in people camped out for hours taking up valuable dining space. Forcing people who want to eat to sit next to strangers in close proximity who eavesdrop while you brief your friends about the glamorous (or hot mess of a) night you just had.",2,5,3

Updated review","Their coffee and tea selection is in my opinion, one of the best in NYC. They make it the way you want it. The flavors stand out and are not diluted down. The Swiss Mocha Almond coffee is friggin amazing, with soy milk and a dash of cream.. omg heaven. And they have the best cup lids in the world, I'm not joking! Go and see what I'm talkin about. Haven't had the cupcake since my last mistake, don't care to either. But they've got a great selection of items, good customer service and free wifi, which keeps me coming.",,1,
175,Anita T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,3,1,1.0,4/9/2015,All I wanted was one of their bagels and coffee before I left New York and they didn't open on time! Sat there and watched me wait out the front for 10mins before I eventually had to leave so I didn't miss my shuttle!,,,

The food is subpar and the last time I ordered for delivery it took them two hours to get the order to me. I had to call them to ask what was taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the soup that I ordered and didn't bother to try to call me to ask if I wanted something else. When I called, they claimed that, ""my phone wasn't working."" It was working just fine and right next to me the entire time I was waiting for them to delivery a soup and sandwich. Sick at home with a cough and all I wanted was some soup. Buyer beware.",1,1,

When I left, after a couple of hours of using their wifi and getting some work done, I left, and I asked myself, did I really pay $1.25 for my coffee!? Am I really in NYC right now? It was a good cup of coffee too. and filled all the way to the top for me to enjoy every sip. A very studious place, maybe because it's near two NYU dorms? But def not a bad place to check out if you're looking to get some work done or meet up with friends over a nice and cheap but tasty cup of coffee.",,,

Gross. Never again, I vowed (again!)Yesterday, since I obviously don't learn from my mistakes, I gave the food at this place one last shot - picking up a latte and a bagel on my way to work.  The latte was good as usual, but the bagel was atrocious.  So stale it was impossible to bite all the way through it.  Unbelievable!  Never again, for real this time.  They have good coffee, and free wifi (though the layout is so poorly set up that I've only tried to hang out and work there maybe twice in 7 years).  But their food is serviceable at best, and absolutely disgusting at worst...pretty crappy batting average in my opinion.",1,1,1

Seems to be a cheap safe bet. But dont come out of your way, the service the second time was poor. Staff didnt speak English but were happy shouting an eastern European language to each other across the cafe not caring it was loud and annoying. Coffee and tea are entirely normal.",,1,

Updated review","I keep coming back to this place because of the free [crappy] wifi and outdoor seating but it is seriously not worth it.Service SUCKS.  I repeat SUCKS.  Literally 10 mins before anyone even comes to give you the menu, and another 15-20 mins before you get your food, which will be cold, because it's not the kitchen's fault, it's the inept waitress who didn't pick up your food when she should have.Also, your order may or may not come out correctly, which will not be remedied by the friendly ""text the manager if you have any problems!"" sign, because they will ignore it.AVOID.  There are plenty of other fine options in the area.",,,
