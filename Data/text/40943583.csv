1,Anthony T.,"Jamaica, NY",244,288,591,4.0,10/19/2018,this is another restaurant i found while on my mealpal lunch plan.. i have tried the chicken caesar wrap with fries and its a great portion! the food is really good. I also had the turkey club sandwich with fries.  i would like to also check out the bar itself. they have any sports game up on the tvs that are available. will update my post.,,,
2,Scott S.,"Short Hills, NJ",4731,707,1335,4.0,10/26/2018,I've been picking up lunch here on Meal Pal.  Every time I come there is a friendly server ready to give me my order.  I have had the Shepards Pie which is a large portion and simply delicious.  I've had the fish and chips as well.  The fried cod was perfect but the chips (fries) were mediocre.  I've Laos sampled the chicken sandwich here and it was excellent.  The place is a welcoming Irish pub and I think it is a great place for drinks and food.  Check it out.,12,4,7
3,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",316,454,6448,4.0,3/19/2018,"I always do well in Irish Pubs - because they often have the best value for the food offered, either in portion or price.  This place shines in both.  Daily happy hour specials, lunch specials, and they offer just good pricing in general.While I didn't dine in today, I came here to pick up lunch to go.  The frontage and signage were sleek in appearance with black and gold lettering.  While not a new place, it's kept well as if it was.  Upon entering, the typical woodsy bar counters first catch your eye as well as the TV's.  They do show a lot of Sports Channels so I can imagine the crowds during game times.  I saw some comfy banquette seating in the rear/main dining area where I walked towards to pick up my lunch.  If full or really busy, they will open up the upstairs dining area too but for lunch, I noticed it was roped off/closed.  Also, noted from the signage, they offer it as the Party space.  So good for renting it out for groups.My lunch today, Shepard's Pie.  I can't tell you how much I like this meal (both from here and in general).  I am a fan of Irish food especially when done right.  This lunch portion was fairly large, came in a rectangular aluminum container - quite a hefty portion I must say.  I was very happy with it.  The meat was so flavorful and the celery, peas, and carrots gave it some nice texture, added flavors, as well as color.  Note:  the carrots were a bit al dente for me but I didn't mind overall.  That added to the textures.  The neatly topped mashed potatoes had a bit of browning on top - very delicious.  So my review is for my lunch ""to go"" experience as I didn't dine in. Next time, I will enjoy a sit down meal in their proudly displayed A rated restaurant...then I can rate it more accurately (for service and ambiance).  This review is strictly for the meal.  I shall return!  Looking forward to it.",6,4,4
4,Matt B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,96,89,4.0,2/26/2018,"Any bar that has Yuengling on tap gets a good review from me.Had a colleagues farewell here on Friday night, food was decent, wings and chicken schnitzel were strong. Service and beer were good, they could have had an extra person on the bar for sure.Outside of that, it was all pretty normal stuff. I would go back for sure. Hard for me to comment on much more given I just didn't try enough other stuff.",,,
5,Vivek D.,"Queens, NY",133,193,75,5.0,12/16/2017,"The company I work for has held their holiday party here the last few years simply due to the affordable pricing as well as proximity to the office.  We are always able to rent the top floor every year.  The floor holds about 120 or so people comfortably.  There's also enough room to setup a food table (closer to the stairs) and a wine table (closer to the booth).  With regards to the food, we were given an option of 10 or so different items.  Obviously that might increase or decrease based on pricing.  From my discussions with colleagues, people have enjoyed the various items - with the chicken tenders, rice balls, and shrimp being crowd favorites.  Most of the people really like the open bar and the bartenders are relatively quick and hospitable.  Not only are they great at serving drinks, but they're also great at helping us out with regards to setting up the video and allowing us to play music.  The speakers are nice and crisp (who wants to hear muffled music?) and there are 6 of them along the left and right walls (3 per wall).We've also congregated on the ground floor of the bar after the party ends.  While it's a relatively narrow bar, it's adequate enough to hold most of us.  Overall, no real complaints with the bar and is a pretty good spot for companies to reserve depending on the size of the party.",,,
6,Mark F.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",1,99,0,4.0,10/23/2018,Had a couple of beers and ribs and wings in here. Good stuff. It was late enough on a Wednesday so quiet. Service good. Beer good. Food good. Price average. I wouldn't object to going here again but there are lots of options in the five blocks NSEW of here. Nothing to make it excellent though.,,,
7,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,3.0,1/18/2018,"Your typical midtown New York sports bar with some class injected into it. It has an upscale feel to it without being stuffy. Service is impersonal but quick. Got the shrimp cocktail, which was solid and came with five medium-sized shrimp. My friend said the wine (Pinot noir) was okay. The space is long but not narrow, and is actually quite spacious, filled with many TVs playing all the sports. There was music playing, but not at a level where you'd need to yell. Not a bad place, but nothing memorable to it. But sometimes in New York, that's just what you need.",4,2,5
8,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,4.0,8/14/2017,"The Press Box is a fantastic place for a quick lunch in midtown! My friend and I came on a Friday afternoon with no reservations and to our surprise it was pretty much completely empty! We were able to get seated immediately and we opted for seating in the back at the booths. The Press Box offers both seating at the bar as well as the booths. The space is very large and they even have an upstairs. This spot could make for a great corporate event such as a Christmas Party! The decor of the place is your very typical sports bar. It has a rustic and sports bar feel to it. There are also TVs situated everywhere across the restaurant for those that come here to watch sports.For food I went with the lunch special which was the Tuna Melt for 12 bucks! This is completely a steal considering it was midtown NYC. The Tuna Melt is very big as well. It comes on two pieces of toast with a ton of tuna and cheese on it. If anything the cheese was almost to much but it ended up being very delicious. The dish also includes fries. WIN! Overall, I had a great experience it. The lunch specials are ridiculous cheap and has tremendous value for the price. I would definitely be coming back!",,,
9,Chike U.,"Englewood, NJ",348,32,101,4.0,7/13/2017,"The press box is a great lunch bar. It has standard bar food and the menu is exactly what would expect from any sports bar. I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich several times and it is definitely one of the highlights on the menu, I would recommend that you try on your first visit for sure. If you are looking for a lighter option, I had the Caesar salad as well as the goat cheese salad and they are both great options especially if you are looking for s light meal. The bread is also fantastic, better than the bread at most sports bars.The service was very good. They were extremely quick and attentive. Refills were coming at a rapid pace, and as customers we definitely felt as though we were being properly looked after.I would certainly recommend you trying out the Press box specifically for a quick lunch with a colleague or friend.",,,2

15,Ken P.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,251,189,3.0,11/6/2016,"Went here for the birthday celebration for my friends wife.  It was my first time in the bar so I was interested in seeing what it was all about.  It's a traditional Irish vibe bar and reminded me a little of the Perfect Pint and a Connolly's or Smith's which I have been known to frequent.  The only annoying part was that there were so many tabs being run for the group of tables that I had to keep going to the bar to get my beer and get scolded by the bartender for doing that when there was a server working the tables.  I think I explained this three times and after the second was ready to just leave out of annoyance.  LOL just let me have my beer mate.  For food I ordered up a chicken wings and found it a little weird that instead of 8 or 10 wings that I got 7.  I don't think I've ever found that to be the number before so I am making mention of it.  They were a tad dry as far as the chicken went despite being slathered in buffalo sauce.  Not the best wings to date but also not the worst.  Perhaps this was an overcooked batch.  I tried my friends Chicken salad since I was debating eating more of this kind of stuff as opposed to a burger and it was nice.  Seemed more filling than my wings were.  There were also jalapeno poppers and potato skins for the masses to have and these were very tasty.  They are two of my favorite things anyway so I am an easy sell.  There is free WiFi but there is limited access to charging areas which is becoming an issue for me as my phone gets older.  The battery is just dying too fast on me and I didn't see many plugs that a customer could access if need be.  We sat in the front middle section and while loud we all could converse.  There is a back dining room and an upstairs party room.  Considering how many were involved in this perhaps the upstairs should have been the choice as the various different circles all kept to the folks they knew but oh well, at least my friends wife enjoyed herself.  That is all that matters at the end of the day.  I'd go back here and try some other food and drink for sure.",,,

24,Jun C.,"New York, NY",26,176,107,4.0,2/22/2015,"When I used to work in the area, I would come here a couple of times a month for lunch.  It's set up like your standard Sports Bar, with several TVs along the wall and tables next to the bar.  There is a second floor as well, though I've only ever dined there once.  I always loved the food here.  The Press Box Burger here is quite delicious; I would order the burger prepared medium, which they cook so that it's juicy enough without being overly runny.  The Fish & Chips are some of the best that I've had in a pub, since they're normally hit or miss anywhere else.  I really liked that there was plenty of fish in the Fish & Chips, as opposed to other pubs that sometimes take a tiny bit of fish and batter/fry the crap out of it, to the point that it's like 80% breading.  I also remember tasting the Shepherd's Pie here and thinking that it was pretty good, even though I normally don't eat them anywhere else.  Will most certainly come back here for lunch the next time I'm around the area.  Here's a link to their menu: thepressboxnyc.com/files…The cost here is fare (see what I did there? lol) and pretty standard for a pub.  Be sure to take advantage of their $12 Lunch Specials!  I've never come here for drinks in the evening, but the way this place is set up, I would definitely do so if I'm ever out in the area on a weekend.  The place is pretty spacious, and I think it would be a great place to catch a game with friends over a few pitchers of beers.",2,,1

27,Sabá L.,"Manhattan, NY",8,25,22,4.0,8/25/2015,"They lose a star for the fake Irish sausages -- for shame(perhaps a bad day?)! I come here when I want to have a conversation over lunch with colleagues or be alone away from people I know but close to work. I've been coming here for over 5 years now. Press Box is a semi-upscale Irish bar in midtown east and is usually more professionals in their 30's+.My favourite is that the chef is very flexible. He lets me order pepper sauce with my fries anytime -- even though its only on the dinner menu with the steak. He also lets me switch rice for the french fries with the chicken curry (An Irish thing apparently). Food, for the most part is great for a pub.  Burgers are juicy, the shoe string fries addicting, even the salads are a nice size. The wings are meaty and spicy (gorgeous but messy!).  Steak sandwich is delicious -- I always ask for fried onions and mushrooms on mine with -- you guessed it -- pepper sauce on the side ;) But apparently everyone else prefers it with gravy?? Anyhoo, daily dinner specials have always been spot-on and good portioned.It is great spot to watch any sports event with plenty of TVs plus if your game isn't on, they will put it on.",1,,
28,Pamala S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,110,85,4.0,9/18/2015,"Warm ambiance, excellent service.  They make a really great crab cake, but it was small. The salad greens that accompanied it was delicious, however for me, the crab cake serving was too tiny, hence the reason why I didn't rate them 5 stars.  For the entree, I ordered the tuna melt which the server mentioned the staff enjoys on Fridays.  It was good, served open-faced and blanketed with melted cheese.",,,
29,Kara E.,"New York, NY",36,42,5,2.0,2/1/2015,"Hmph. I really used to like Press Box - for a Midtown East bar, it's ""classy"" (dark wood!), reasonable prices for bar food, and the crowd tends to not be a rowdy, ""let's go play beer pong, bro!!"" type. My friend and I went to Press Box to watch the BCS Championship Game and the service was laughable. To be fair, the place was packed, but the bartender could not be bothered to get us water, get us beer, let us order food. My friend wondered aloud if he just assumed that we were young and wouldn't tip (neither things are true) and then we debated existentially for awhile about proving him wrong and leaving him a huge tip. We had the time for this debate because it took him over 15 minutes to bring us the check. By the time, it got there, our decision was made.No thanks, Press Box.",3,,
30,Lei T.,"Manhattan, NY",26,30,18,5.0,1/18/2015,"The best mixture of restaurant and sports bar. In the front it's a bar and towards the back its a sit down dinning area with tvs. I always come here to watch the game because you can still eat a great meal while enjoying the game in a nice setting. The shepards pie and the bacon burger is a go to for me. The shepards pie is so filling! The mash potatoes are hearty, buttery and the meat filling is thick with a great sauce that's not too salty. The burger is exactly what you expect it to be. Big, juicy and flavorful! If you're looking for a place to eat good food and watch the game, you should definitely come here!",1,1,1

32,Travel Girl Z.,"New York, NY",382,50,1,3.0,9/11/2014,"Midtown East is not known for its great food, lounges or bars so I was happy to come across The Press Box. The wood was very beautiful and eye-catching when I walked in and well maintained. I immediately connected with the diverse group of people and energy. The bartender - Irish of course - was cheerful and excited about the menu. Therefore, I was excited too! I ordered the grilled salmon and veggies - yummy - and a few glasses of wine. An hour later I made new friends in an area I rarely frequent. Next I'm chatting it up with many interesting people who work and visit the U.N. I try to stop by The Press Box every few months and I even had Thanksgiving dinner there one year with a dear friend and her mother. It was perfect as we did not want to cook. The drinks are very reasonable for NYC, great game watching but arrive early, the locals are friendly, the food is good but quite overpriced.",2,1,

I could see that -- loosen the tie & belly up to the dark-wood bar for a pint. Though the place felt comfortable & welcoming, the food was not a standout. They had the special, a teriyaki steak & enjoyed it well enough. I ordered pasta w/ vodka sauce & chicken breast. Perfectly blah, meh.

34,Win L.,"Manhattan, NY",58,45,29,2.0,4/25/2014,"Underwhelmed.This Irish bar restaurant is located in midtown east where irish bar/pubs are a dime a dozen. With so much competition you'd think they would try a little harder.The space was very nice and a lot classier than most of their competition in the area. It's spacious and good for big groups. The lunch special is not too shabby, you can get any sandwich + soda (or iced tea) for $12. However most of the bar restaurants nearby you can get a burger + beer for $10 (I'm looking at you stag head). The food was what you would expect and it was decent. I think we just had a bad waitress (her name was maggie btw). She just had a bad attitude, was rather short with us and when I asked if I could get the free soda that came with the special (even though i initially just ordered a sandwich, they are both the same price) she simply replied ""no, it doesn't work like that"". I mean come on, it's a freaking soda from the bar. Not to mention that she automatically added 18% gratuity for our party of 5. All in all we spent a solid $20 pp for lunch here. So not worth it, like I said, these places are a dime a dozen in this area -- go elsewhere.",2,2,

There was such great food we all decided to share, to be able to enjoy it all. The crab cakes were filled with large chunks of fresh crab and cooked to perfection. The shepherds pie was the best I had ever had and the beef Wellington was so tender, I almost didn't need a knife to cut it. Just when I didn't think I could fit another bite, out came a choice of several mouthwatering, homemade desserts.  I think I gained 10 pounds just because I couldn't stop sampling the chocolate mousse and cheese cake.  The service was excellent also. The waitress was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.

Not sure when ""jones link breakfast sausages "" became bangers but they did today !!! According to the waitress the menu changed a couple of years ago, eh, we ate here in March and had authentic bangers, I don't think she liked having to actually wait on a table instead of hanging out at the bar with the lads, her answer to any question was an informative ""I don't know"" .

On a stretch of streets with bars catering more to the post college jagerbombing crowd, the crowd here is usually more professionals in their 30's+ on most nights.Some pros:  - Bartenders and staff have always been friendly and attentive.  And they pour one of the best Guinness I've had in NYC- Great spot to watch any sports event with plenty of TVs.  And if your game isn't on, they usually can put it on.- Food, for the most part (see below), is good for a pub.  Burgers are juicy, the shoe string fries addicting, even the salads are a nice size. The wings are meaty and spicy (try them!).  Steak sandwich is a pending heart attack (order extra gravy).  And the daily dinner specials have always been spot-on and good portioned.- Decor and layout has a clean look to itCons:Not too many, so let me stretch for some here...- You won't find any drink specials, but treat the bartenders right and you'll get a buy back.- Some of the common menu items are just ""eh"", such as calamari, nachos and chicken fingers.- Prices may seem high compared to other pubs in the area, but the quality of the food is better IMO.I do believe I'll continue to patronize this establishment.",,,

47,J. B.,"Nashville, TN",0,49,0,5.0,5/6/2015,We were impressed with the classy spacious bar and great service. The Chicken Florentine is yummy but our wilted spinach was a bit garlicky yet mixed well with the mashers. We'll be returning when we're in town!,,,
48,AJ S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",6,110,50,4.0,8/27/2012,"This is a pretty cool spot on Bar Row, only made cooler by its resident server supreme Whitney!Whitney was cool, engaging, courteous and attentive; she is the epitome of what all servers should be at all restaurants. Period! Whitney is the best thing in that place and I told the bartender Paul (aka. Pauly) that he needs to make sure management gives her a much deserved raise. The decor was mid-upscale, walls adorned by wood and mirrors, clean bathrooms that actually smelled good and featured a fine-dining area in the back away from the bar scene. My group of six appreciated having a space to dine comfortably and get our conversations going. My group seemed to enjoy there meals; Whitney made sure to accommodate one of my friends who had issues with peanuts in one of her entrees and had the chef  revamp her meal expeditiously. My Pat La Freida burger was good and I was surprised by the bun, which had a NYC-pretzel taste to it; it was an unexpected flavor I actually enjoyed. The honey mustard here was delicious: Now I'm wishing I woulda told Whit to throw some up in a to-go thermos for me. One minor issue with my appetizer; I always get a crab cake when I see it on any menu. I appreciated the big salad that came with the crab cake (and that the cherry tomatoes in that salad were cut in half for my cute little lips)... ...but the crab cake was a little too mushy. It seems like some horseradish-type of sauce was infused into the crab cake and I think that infusion is what led to the cake's mushy consistency. Whatever that sauce was should be put to the side and not infused into the actual crab cake.",1,1,1
49,Peter G.,"Shoreham, NY",1,20,0,1.0,11/4/2012,"My friends and I stopped into The Press Box for dinner recently, and it ended up being one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a very long time. Everything started out nicely: the dining room was fairly empty, the server gave adequate attention to me friends and I, and our food and drinks came out promptly. However, as soon as our food arrived, we seemed to become invisible to our server. I desperately tried to get her attention because I had ordered baby back ribs, and there was not one satisfactory component: The ribs were extremely chewy and the ""sweet and spicy"" barbecue sauce tasted solely of Frank's Red Hot, the mashed potatoes were lukewarm, and the steamed vegetables were in a strange state of limbo between half cooked and ice cold. My friend's Manhattan seafood chowder was also questionable at best, and my other friend's creamed spinach was so buttery it was treading on inedible.When our server finally returned, she sat our check on the table and was gone quicker than I could say ""excuse me"". So we paid the check and left a standard tip, though she hardly deserved it. At this point I got up, found the server and asked if I could speak to a manager. Her response was ""he might be downstairs"" then she promptly turned her back on me and walked away.",1,,
50,Jen R.,"Manhattan, NY",52,88,0,3.0,7/3/2013,"I just came here for a drink with a few friends and I enjoyed their space. The bar is nice and long and the ""bar area"" also has cocktail tables alongside so they can hold large groups of thirsty people. There is also a backroom and an upstairs. One complaint- the bathroom was upstairs? That seemed a little odd to me. The bartender was really nice and the music playing was right on point for my style: the classics, some 90s, some hits... just a really good mix.I would recommend coming here for a drink... maybe next time I'm here I'll sample the food!",,,
51,Christopher S.,"Minneapolis, MN",58,301,1175,4.0,11/24/2010,"Good food, good service, and it gets busy during dinner time...that tells you that even the locals like it here!It is a fun place with reasonable food ($10-15 per plate) and drinks.  Definitely not 'another Irish Pub' in NYC!",,,
52,Anna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,277,16,4.0,3/20/2012,"Pretty sparsely populated on a Monday night  - which adds to the star value. They have magic hat no 9 on draft. about 6 giant flat screen TVs playing every sports game possible - - seriously, even women's basketball - - who watches that? Our bartender was also a super nice Irish man (Ed), who had an affinity for playing The Black Keys- which adds to the appeal. (i may have developed a bit of a crush) It kills me that this bar isn't closer to my place. Didn't get liquor so I cant speak for the quality/price of those - - but I would definitely suggest stopping in here to grab some beers and hang with Ed.",2,,1
53,Kat J.,"Washington Crossing, PA",67,272,141,4.0,1/26/2012,"Very nice sports bar. Wood and exposed brick. Classy decor and patrons. Good food, great drink options. Staff is just ok - hence 4 stars. The one short-haired waitress seems to be having a bad day every time I'm there - kinda almost rude. The one younger looking bartender is super sweet and nice but can't seem to hear anything as every time he asks me if I want another pint of whatever I'm having, when I tell him ""I'm ok for now"", I get a refill :| Worse things can happen I guess ;) I really enjoy watching the Giants games here - they have Giants flags hanging outside their door so the place fills up with Giants fans. It was awesome to see them crush the Niners last weekend!! :)",1,,
54,John O.,"Parsippany, NJ",85,122,5,3.0,6/19/2012,"Nice dark Irish place, perfect for reconnecting with friends or catching the Yankees. Food...I went there for a company event and the foods were decent typical happy hour buffet style appies. But I go there primarily for ambiance and properly poured Guinness. Prices are typical Midtown bar prices. What do you expect?",,,
55,Anthony D.,"Vicenza, Italy",64,105,16,3.0,7/19/2014,"Went here to watch the world cup with some friends. The food was on par with most other bars and their beer selection was very good. Not so sure about the staff. I'm sure it was because of the amount of people there for the match, but it could have been better. The owner was good though, all things considered.",,,
56,Tara J.,"Manhattan, NY",57,110,3,2.0,7/3/2013,"This place looks great from the outside - like a low key, old fashioned pub - so we had high hopes when we moved into the area. But we went in with some friends on a Friday night and were pretty disappointed. The bar was completely empty, which was fine because we were sitting down to chat anyway. The waitress was a little pushy trying to get us to order right away. The beer we had was fine, but I guess they can't really mess that up too much. But the prices seemed way too high for the type of service and the atmosphere. We'll probably skip this place and try one of the dozens of other nearby bars.",2,1,
57,James T.,"Brooklyn, NY",307,31,2,1.0,3/20/2011,"How can you be named Press Box and have tables where you can't watch sports on any tv's? Sports bar fail.The food was overpriced, the service wasn't great, however, to be fair, it was St. Patrick's day. The one star rating is for a poor sheppard's pie and NO TELEVISIONS in view from our seats upstairs during march madness. Had to watch on an iphone.",4,,
58,Mark E.,"North Richland Hills, TX",29,34,1,3.0,2/21/2012,"I stopped here after a long day of walking around the city looking for drinks and a light dinner.  Prices were pretty average for NYC - a little more than I'd be willing to pay at home for pub-style fare, but not at all over-the-top considering the location.I ate in the back room area, away from the bar.  The atmosphere was nice and warm with the architecture of the building on display (lots of wood, exposed brick walls, etc).  A couple of people in my party ordered sandwiches (which I heard were very good) while my wife and I split some appetizers.  The portobella and goatcheese salad was pretty excellent.  The potato skins that we ordered were only 3 pieces for over $10 which was a little disappointing.It did have a good selection of beers and the gentleman who was working the bar while we were there poured an excellent Black and Tan.",,,
59,Ashley D.,"Houston, TX",0,23,0,3.0,6/30/2013,"Went here to watch the Confederations Cup final, great, easy place.  Located right by my hotel.  It was quiet which I loved, no loud noise, but a goopd amount of tvs and I was able to hear the game.  I had the fish and chips which were really good, awesome tartar sauce!  My mom had a steak with jalopeno butter, her only complaint was there was not enough butter for the whole steak.This place would have gotten a much higher rating except the fact that they charge you for every refil of soda and they did not tell us.  We ordered our drinks before looking at the menu (which the waitress says states they charge 2.50 for refills).  When we asked the waitress she did take the extra sodas off but became very rude and dismissive of us.  We did stay the whole game and after she cleared our food she never came back to see if we wanted or needed anything else.  Overall I loved the armosphere and the game but was VERY disappointed with the waitress and charging for the extra drinks.",1,,
60,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2242,478,3.0,10/9/2014,"Can't believe its been 20 years since my first visit, damn time fly's .This is the typical Irish pub bar restaurant with style.  The place is long and roomy and has an upstairs so you can spread out. TVs all over the place to watch the games. The crowd is Irish and WASPy  which is cool with me, no trouble no undesirables. The folks who work here from bartenders to servers are very polite and enjoy doing their jobs. Music is played at a balanced level so you don't have to yell to have a conversation. I found a little spot upstairs and had a TV all for Mr me. My server was a young pretty girl who had a heavy Cork County accent, I asked her was she French(i was just kidding with her ) she said with a laugh no Ireland.I ordered some Chicken pot pie, darn it was really good,and a very juicy burger(Damn I gotta stop eating and lose some weight). This place has some decent food, and another thing I notice is that Irish folks love to drink booze . If you happen to be in area ,try this joint good food, casual safe atmosphere,and roomy so you can spread your wings and catch a game and relax for a while.",3,2,2
61,Jean M.,"Manhattan, NY",12,15,0,5.0,12/13/2013,"My favorite place to get a burger in all if NYC! I usually just get the Press Box burger with the confit onions, delicious! Drinks are great and so is the staff. Bartenders are wonderful here! Perfect place to grab a burger, drink and watch the game!",,,
62,Stacey S.,"Manhattan, NY",246,37,2,4.0,4/28/2011,"Best salmon of my life.Don't ask me how or why, because I still don't understand. And I must admit I'd been refusing my boyfriend's pleas to eat here for weeks. I avoid eating at pubs unless I'm in the mood for a good [cheddar bacon] burger and fries. The sesame crusted salmon special listed on their board out front piqued my interest and I gave in. So flavorful and cooked perfectly, over a bed of fresh mixed greens. I'm honestly not eloquent enough to explain what made it so freaking good. I was giggling on my way out the door and vowed to make it my life's goal to reproduce that salmon in my own kitchen.At $21 a plate, it's way more than I'd ever care to pay for pub fare but give me a break. I'm still acclimating to this city's prices.",,,
63,ashley S.,"New York, NY",119,149,4,4.0,5/24/2010,"We were going to stop for a drink and then get dinner - guess which didn't happen? Yea no dinner. So it was pretty empty which I didn't mind since I didn't feel like crawling through a crowd to get to the bar or yelling over music to hear people. Naturally we met up with our friends who insist on ordering another round every time you put your glass down. So I think I had 4 - 5 drinks, a beer, and a shot of some nature. I don't really remember. I do remember a really drunk guy hitting on us and unfortunate for him we were with some agents - you really shouldn't hit on girls if they're with guys who may or may not have guns. So he got asked to leave. The bartender was great - it was one of the few nights I didn't get one vodka soda instead of my vodka tonic. Actually scratch that - I might have but I probably didn't notice. All and all it's a typical irish bar but the bathrooms here are pretty clean. That's always a plus.",1,2,1
64,Charles B.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,32,0,5.0,3/17/2011,"Ok, this got a boost from the fact that this is where I watched Barcelona advance past Arsenal in the Champions League. But still a good bar.My boy works close so I decided to watch here, tons of TVs and sound for the game was nice. Bartender went out of his way to get me a seat, nicer. Buffalo chicken sandwich was bomb, helped me soak up several Buds and some whiskey. Prices weren't bad at all for NYC, and I even got a beer on the house. Only downside was the drunken a-hole suits complaining about soccer in their whiny new york accents.",,,
65,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,5,0,1.0,5/5/2014,"Ask your waitress if they have specials on a Monday night at happy hour and she says,"" yeah, we have water with ice. "" seriously?! I don't even know why I left her a tip. Sports bars are a dime a dozen on 2nd ave. Never again!",1,,
66,Loe S.,"White Plains, NY",18,122,1,4.0,10/5/2009,"I am going to start this review by sharing a little 'theory' that I have about food: It's sort of a rule of thumb to find above average wings and fish 'n chips. So, here goes...It is my belief that, if a restaurant has malt vinegar sitting on the table, their fish 'n chips are most likely good. Further, it is my belief that if there is a roll of paper towels sitting on the table, the wings are most likely good.I put the Fish 'n Chips part of my rule to the test at the Press Box and was not disappointed. The outside of my fish was perfectly crispy and buttery and the inside just melted in your mouth. Mmmmm....This is definitely one of the better f&c meals I've had in a long time. So far, my theory is holding up rather well!Now, on to the rest of the Press Box. The pub was nice and clean, it's pretty much your average Irish style bar. The service was very good and the French onion soup was yummy. My only complaint was with the potato skins, which were definitely sub par.All-in-all, the Press Box is, in my opinion, one of the better bar food spots in the area and I will definitely be back for some more fish n chips.",3,1,1
67,Tracy W.,"Alpharetta, GA",118,146,29,3.0,2/6/2010,"Classiest sports bar I've ever been to. Only had appetizers and a small salad, but no real complaints about the food (decent food at decent prices). Would have liked to have seen a larger beer selection (some cider, maybe?) but I did manage to find something to suit.",1,,
68,Katie M.,"Manhattan, NY",17,24,0,5.0,9/6/2012,"I love the Press Box!  The food is great and it is never too crowded, I can always find a seat at the bar.  All of the waitstaff is super nice and easy to talk to.",,,
69,Maeve J.,"New York, NY",2,40,0,5.0,10/15/2010,"One of my absolute favorites. It's a fun place to gather and watch a game with friends. The food is above average for pub fare and the service - whether from the bartenders at the bar or waitress service at the tables is always stellar. Overall, I would rather light myself on fire than walk into most midtown bars. This place is the exception to that rule.",,,
70,Neil C.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,0,1.0,11/27/2014,"The food is not very good, and very expensive. The nachos tasted like they had cheese wiz on them, and the wings were very generic tasting. Nachos were $13, had high expectations about the place but was very disappointed. The inside and service and good, but price and quality of food is bad. Won't go back again.",,,
71,Vince L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,106,0,4.0,12/29/2012,"Friendly staff, good music, and easy going. Bar snack not bad.",,,
72,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,390,60,3.0,2/12/2010,"I went here one night with a group of friends for after work dinner and drinks. I was super turned off when I heard where it was, I don't like the after work crowd in the midtown area (or really any crowd there) but it was a majority vote, so I lost. We had a table in the back and a super friendly server. The menu had good choices, great pub food and I went with the chicken pot pie, which I saw and suddenly craved. The dish itself wasn't anything to write home about, as it was a tad watery, but it was good enough for the time being, and I ate most of it. It was a good space to have a few drinks, it wasn't too expensive and conveniently located to my friends who had to go to Grand Central and take a train home. All in all, I would go back in the early evening with a group of friends for some dinner and drinks if the location had to be midtown. I did really appreciate the good service too.",,,
73,Liz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",643,600,3,5.0,2/6/2009,"The best burger in New York, IMO, is the Boursin Burger at the Press Box. It's a patty pumped full of garlicky boursin cheese. Order it rare, take a bite, and let the blood and melted cheese stream down your chin, in dual rivers of joy.",4,5,7
74,Neline S.,"New York, NY",177,417,201,4.0,1/8/2010,"I discovered this bar through an Alumni event that was being hosted.  It's a nice classy place with a nice mahagony finish on the wall paneling (or I think it was)If you arrive at 6pm, there's no security to ID you but a coat check and upstairs are nice cozy tables and I think I saw a fireplace.  It can hold up to 100 people and it's a place to have a beer and catch up with folks.I do find the bar food pretty good as I had some calimari and mozzarella sticks.  I'll definitely back to have another Guinness.",,,
75,Ian M.,"New York, NY",8,5,0,3.0,6/14/2011,"I went because it is supposed to be a sports bar.  The tv's weren't bad.  Guiness was $7 which seemed high for being over on 2nd Ave.   Older crowd.  Nothing great, nothing special.",1,1,
76,Jeremy W.,"Hoboken, NJ",175,524,20,4.0,4/21/2009,"Nice pub, good menu, friendly service.  They also have all the sports cable/satelite packages.Went with a couple of buddies on Friday night and they were very accomodating with changing the TVs around so my buddy could have the Flyers and Phillies next to eachother, even though clearly everyone in this town hates Philly's sports teams.""The Post"" is an all time-great sampler with wings, skins, tenders, and mozz sticks for $30.  Very generous portions, and for $30, it fed 3 guys with a solid buzz.  Beers were also reasonably priced with a decent selection.Slides right into the top slot of bar food in this neighborhood.",1,,1
77,Ry G.,"Washington, DC",4,40,0,4.0,4/18/2010,"Came here with 5 guys to watch an NHL playoff game and got a table to the rear. The waitress was nice enough to change the channel so we could watch the Pens/Senators game and two groups near us were ""nice"" enough to complain to the same girl about the game being on the TV. +1 star for keeping the game on Not many sports bars I know of where the norm dress is a suit and tie so we all got some looks (from customers) walking in with jeans on. Also, not too many sports bars where you can get a prix fixe or serve their ribs with a spicy sweet&sour sauce. But they still had the traditional pub fare too, so nothing wrong with offering some extra options.Annoying fellow patrons aside (though they probably thought the same about us) ... nice decor, good food selection, a bit quiet for a sports joing but all-in-all a-ok with +1 star for the staff .",,,
78,Pamela H.,"Seattle, WA",223,145,11,3.0,11/14/2009,"We wandered in late Friday night, enticed by the safe-looking menu outside. Impressive decor for a pub, good lighting, clean, and friendly.  Strange atmosphere of an impressively loud sound system playing pretty good tunes, coupled with many, many flat screens showing various sporting events.  The food was less than inspiring, but not over priced. We were most impressed with our attentive server, who was probably bored due to the lack of customers seated in her section. Probably a better place to drink than to enjoy a good meal, but overall a nice little joint.",,,
79,Ian C.,"Long Island City, NY",54,386,3,3.0,9/25/2011,"I was here recently to meet up with a friend, so I'll keep this review brief. Good beers on tap, including the seasonal beer of Sam Adams (it was Octoberfest when I went). Beers were expensive, even at 5pm--$7 for a beer. No happy hour I guess. I don't know about the rest of the food, but the calimari was excellent. A little greasy, but quite tender. There's an upstairs area for private parties-- my friend wanted to check it out because there were a lot of good looking girls. Next time.",,,
80,Jade H.,"Flushing, NY",85,812,303,3.0,4/4/2009,Very nice pub restaurant. Clean and respectable. The food wasn't gourmet but it was done nicely. I had cod served over arugula. I love to eat arugula and they were very generous in that. The cod was a little less flavored. I guess the arugula had enough bite for both.The Chicken Pot pie looked beautiful with a very fluffy crusty crispy top.Not too loud and not too noisy.,,,2
81,Michael F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,4.0,1/31/2014,"I love this place. Good place to watch a game but I prefer the back dining room for dinner. The food is consistently good (whether it's a burger or legit entree), but it's the french onion soup that I think that stands out for me. I've been going here for five years and thought it was time to just throw in my review.",,,
82,John S.,"New York, NY",1,15,0,4.0,10/8/2006,"A nicer sports bar for adults...Really nice decor with lots of nice wood - with plenty of plasma screens, but with the volume set to a level where you can carry on a conversation.  Good food, with reasonable prices.  The sort of place where you can bring a non sports fan along (i.e. your girlfriend) without using up a lot of favors they might owe you...",1,1,1
83,Denis K.,"Manhattan, NY",70,376,87,4.0,1/12/2008,"A chill little pub that doesn't get too crowded. I met a group of high school alums here tonight. The Press Box offered a really comfortable atmosphere where everyone could talk.The high tables are nice and there is a wonderful dark wood paneling everywhere. I saw at least 3 flat screens from where I was sitting. The waitress dropped by just the right amount of times, not too much and not too little. I only drank beer, so I can't comment on the cocktails. Overall, good impression of the place.",1,,1
84,Jessica M.,"Norwood, NJ",10,71,0,3.0,10/9/2006,"This place is pretty nice...it's nice and small...wood paneled bar and floor..nice high top tables to watch the tube while your sipping your brew or cocktail..there are some nights where its too quiet (meaning I went there once to find it just me and my buddy, and some other wanderers with their ties loose and their wedding bands off- just kidding! but there were just some stray men around looking pretty sad... :T ) some of the cocktails were made EXTREMELY sweet to a point where my friend and I had to wash it down with beers since water wasn't doing the trick. It's a place I'd find more corporate types (though the crowd varied) and not a kind of bar where you should wild out and whip your shirt around like a flag. If your looking for a lazy night out, go to the Press Box.",1,,1
85,Simon M.,"Minneapolis, MN",30,4,16,4.0,8/22/2011,"Okay so this place is a bit more clean than other irish pubs in midtown but not pretentious. Very nice wait staff. Good TV's, nice decor. I and my gf had the Boursin Burger which is basically a Juicy Luicy and honestly it was effing amazing. The fries were okay and I say that because I am not a huge skinny fry fan but if you are they are good. Music was good. Price was fair and cheaper than expected given the atmosphere. The food is definitely a 4 and the service as well.",,,
86,Rob B.,"New York, NY",6,174,25,3.0,4/11/2011,"Yet another faux Irish Pub on 2nd avenue.  This one is a little more upscale than others and has slightly above average food.  Decent place for a pint and a pub steak.  However, there isn't much about it that makes it any better or worse than its many neighbors.",,,
87,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,3.0,5/29/2007,"This is an incredibly nice pub where you can eat grub, feel clean, and drink up some lager with a not too crowded afterwork feel and friendly bartenders.You walk in and with the heavy lighting and wood everything and the long bar and restaurant, it's just one of those places where you feel like you shouldn't be talking too loud. But don't worry, you can. You can gripe all you want about the day's news or about the game. Especially in this dead area, Midtown east, it's hard to find a place you can actually get behind in terms of ""hey I'd actually drink here"". The cleanliness and space make it ideal for afterwork.",,,1

91,Adeel K.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,47,7,4.0,5/14/2009,"I like this pub. It used to be my favorite place to go grab a pint of Guinness in the city and usually had a great time there. I am trying to stay away from beer because of the carbs, so I don't get to go as often now. The bartenders are very friendly too. The food there is nothing special, but then again its not bad either.",,,

Stopped in last week with friends and we had the Boursin Burger and the Press Box Burger on the menu and we all agreed that the taste couldn't be beat! The service was a 5 star, and extremely helpful with the wine selection as well as the menu. The atmosphere was cozy and could be romantic in the back were we were sitting if we weren't' with another couple. I read some of the other reviewers comments and have to disagree that we felt the the prices were fair and we will definitely return for lunch/dinner again. Also,had the mussels for apps and would suggest trying those, as well.Stop by and enjoy!",,,

I was kind of annoyed because I was on my sobriety kick, and ordered a diet coke when all my friends were boozing it up. It cost $3.00!!! I dont know, if I were a nice bartender I would have given to to me for free :) Plus, that is REALLY expensive for a diet coke!Still, it was a pretty low-key bar and we had a good time talking and hanging out.",,,

97,Pia S.,"New York, NY",1040,681,48,4.0,6/11/2012,"One of my favorite joints in the hood, especially on a warm summer night when they have the front floor-to-ceiling windows open. They make an excellent dirty martini and Valentino the bouncer is a sweetheart. My spot is at the low table in the front window (not a fan of the new high-tops so I hope they switch it back soon). Either way, have some great memories here.",,,
98,El G.,"Roswell, GA",0,16,5,4.0,3/8/2011,"Good low key spot to watch sports and drink some beers, very attentive wait staff.  didn't have any food but looked decent.",,,
99,K S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,12/11/2011,"Horrible service!! and overpriced. Me and my friends sat on the bar and unfortunately for us had the Irish guy for the bartender, he was so mean to us for no apparent reason (first Irish jerk I ever met), me and my friends were shocked, we left after one drink and only because it was so expensive we didn't want to leave before we finished it...",1,,
100,Michelle R.,"Broward, FL",1,19,1,1.0,7/14/2009,"There on Sunday, they close at 11pm.  Bartender, Paul, either not social and not knowledgable or just rude.  I am from Miami so I'm not easily offended but this guy did it for me.  He could not tell us other places to go (since they were closing at 11) and we were there on holiday.  No problem, Yelp helped us and we had a great time!",2,,
101,Alex W.,"New York, NY",101,78,0,4.0,4/2/2010,"Love this place.  Great sports watching place.  My buddy and I have a tradiltion of watching the Final Four every year at this bar and we get the nachos, burgers, and beer.  Nice bar staff as well.",,,
102,Matt M.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,116,0,5.0,11/19/2008,"Alltime favorite respectable Irish pub in NYC. Nothing too extravagant, just good people, great service, and THE MOST AMAZING BOURSOIN burger ever. They cook it with the cheese INSIDE the burger. Go. Now.",2,,1
103,m g.,"Morristown, NJ",12,120,4,4.0,7/12/2011,nice bar and very good burger.  could use bigger TV's,,,
104,Tony D.,"New York, NY",376,71,24,4.0,5/21/2009,"The food was good! I had hot wings, rib appetizer, and pork chops. The ribs were delicious!!!! I will be back. I went there a few other times just for drinks and enjoyed the candle lit atmosphere.",,,
105,Jeff K.,"Longmont, CO",61,64,2,2.0,7/28/2009,"Generic pub, generic menu, OK food with lots of TVs.  I had calamari for an appetizer, NY strip with chopped spinach and mashed potatoes.  Everything was OK, nothing bad, but certainly nothing special.  The chopped spinach was the highlight......",,,
106,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0,5.0,1/14/2006,I went with a bunch of sports fanatic guys to wach the final four of the NCAA tournament and everyone agreed that the Press Box had the best wings any of us had EVER had. Something about the buffalo batter and the amount of meat on each wing. The atmosphere was perfect for watching sports with your buddies.,,,
107,Jack M.,"New York, NY",16,3,0,3.0,7/22/2010,"A nice place for a pint, but I have had it with their lunches.  I'm writing because this is the second time in a row that I am still hungy after eating a lunch special. The portions are hit or miss, especially if something is the ""special"".  I ordered the corned beef sanwich topped with coleslaw and swiss.  It was more like a coleslaw sandwich that bumped into a few slices of corned beef on the way to the table.  Fish and chips were bad last trip.  They looked like three Mrs. Paul's fish sticks on my plate.  Stick with the burgers, they are decent.",,,
108,Amanda P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,52,0,3.0,3/25/2008,"I wish I could rate the food separately because I would give more stars...but the service was by far the worst I've ever had in my life. I can handle the slowness in getting the bill during a weekday lunch, but I cannot look past rudeness. The waitress charged an extra dollar for my friend's sandwich...when I politely pointed this out, she claimed it was for my soda, but that was included in the lunch special (besides, this place charges $3 for a soda). She got really huffy, let out an exasperated sigh, said ""whatever, you can have your dollar,"" and walked away. Then she threw the bill at my friend. I've never not left a tip, but this is one time I felt it was warranted. It's too bad she was so awful, because I would have gone back. I really liked my shepherd's pie and thought they had some nice lunch specials. AN UPDATE: I wrote to the manager about the service and he graciously apologized and invited me and my friend back for a meal on the house. Another star is your's, Press Box.",2,,1
109,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,4.0,8/14/2009,"Is Erin the best waitress in New York? Nope. I think Ellen at Fanelli's has that base covered. Marta at The Patriot gave her a run for her money, but she's since been fired, I hear. BUT, Erin is sure one of the top handful of waiter/tresses who has the personality to bring a smile to the lips of  even a Chicago Cubs fan. Right there! Joking, bringing us the right stuff. Telling us about her adventures in med-school. (She's putting herself through Columbia. Yeah!) Everything you'd want that's legal and proper to give on a first meeting. She made our night! The food was nothing special, although the Buffalo Chicken Tenders were above average, in both taste and serving size. The tap beer selection: Yuengling, Sam Adams, Brooklyn, Blue Moon, was  average for midtown. It if weren't for Erin, this would have been a pretty ordinary place, but it WERE for Erin and it was spectacular! --Drink Club NYC is a roving group of NYC drinkers",,,
110,Ed M.,"Maple Glen, PA",1,6,0,4.0,2/19/2009,"Great food, great service. I had the Shepherds pie and the Manhattan Clam Chowder. Both done to perfection. Will definitely return.",,,
111,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0,3.0,12/6/2005,"Although the prix fixe is a great price at $19.99, the food is lacking. My chicken cream soup was bland and the chicken was overcooked. I ordered the shrimp scampi for dinner and it was tough and did not taste anything. The veggies that came with my entree tasted as if they had gone bad. The dessert was also lacking - the apple crisp was more dry crisp with only a couple bites of apple. This is definately a place to go for drinks and then get dinner somewhere else! I have to say the seating at the bar and dining areas are very nice and the service is exceptional.",,,
