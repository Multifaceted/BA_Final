I also really enjoyed the shishito peppers but the cheese platter is definitely what would have me coming back. Seriously it had like six different kinds of cheese and decent portions of each kind. I had a nice glass of Riesling. I really liked the ambiance of this place but it was so so so hot. Yes, it was crowded, but they need to figure out the air conditioners. My entire party was literally beading sweat. Also tried two sushi rolls, and the one with crab was really yummy.",

It's not super traditional, as far as I can tell -- they season the rice somehow (I didn't get details). The guacamole was also quite nice, albeit slightly overpriced (but what good guacamole isn't?).The service was great. We had Yessica, and she was perfect.Excellent night. Will definitely be coming back.",

First, finding it could take you a bit... It's not under the walkway with Duane Reade, it's the East Walkway. Anywho, for a Tuesday night, it was packed! But not in an obnoxious way. The wine selection is great and the tapas are pretty good. We shared a cheese platter, the tacquitos, the baby meatballs and a few other plates--not the best thing you've ever tasted, but definitely satisfying. The waitress was friendly and chatty but didn't hover. Great place for after work happy hour!",1

With its black drawn blinds if you walk past quickly you might just miss it. The place has a chic vibe with hostesses that resemble eclectic  runway models. The crowd, however, appeared to be local finance industry folks. We had the shrimpCocktail which was ok. The real show-stopper was the Marguerite pizza!  Ultra thin pizza dough was similar to a super thin croissant and the sauce and cheese was spot on! This dish was sooo yummy we had to order it twice.  We also tried the cheese Pom frites with truffles.... Oh so delicious! The Tapas here do not disappoint.  For drinks we decided to go with a couple of bottles of the Malbec Red Blend which paired nicely with the pizza. We will be back.",

This really surprised me as anywhere else I've had cocktails in New York has been more than generous with their shots.

I ordered a moscow mule and a Dogfish Head IPA - they poured the beer in the Mule and tried to convince me it was the drink I ordered. The manager was zero help in resolving the issue, as I then had him then try the drink and he said it tasted fine. Not sure if he just hasn't had a moscow mule before but everyone else I had try it agreed that there was beer poured in it. Not to mention, the beer was 3/4 full when it was given to me. Never written a yelp review before but made an account just to say how terrible my experience at this place was. I will never give them business again after last night.",

17,,1/31/2018,1,1,"New York, NY",Gabby S.,0,1.0,10,"If I could give this establishment zero stars I would. I have never dealt with such rude and inconsiderate staff in my life. My two friends and I work in the neighborhood and decided to go to Lea after work to celebrate a birthday. Upon arrival they told us that we could not be seated because we didn't have a reservation. At this point, the bar was full and there were no available tables. That was fine. We went to the bar and ordered a drink and enjoyed ourselves. Shortly after, a table opened at one along the bench tables. We asked if we could be seated there and they said no because it was only for two people. We walked away and then the entire bench opened up and all the tables cleared out. We went back to the staff and asked if we could now be seated if you combine tables together since we have three people. They told us no, and I walked away. After 20 minutes, all of the tables were still empty and we went back up to the staff and explained that we would like to be seated, and they still would not seat us because they are only for two people. We explained that it was bench seating, you have no one sitting there, and we are not waiting for the two parties of 10-15 people to leave so we can be seated in the section that is for parties of over 2 people. They said that those are our rules, and I explained how their rules are arbitrary and are just prohibiting them from doing business. The staff was passive aggressive, unaccommodating, rude, had no customer service skills, and most importantly did not have any understanding of basic economics because all we wanted to do was be situated in a place where it was comfortable for us to order more drinks and food (aka generate money).",

19,,1/29/2017,10,,"New York, NY",Peter N.,0,4.0,88,"Lea Wine Car is less of a wine bar and more of the modern day equivalent of a speakeasy.  Finding it is a bit of an adventure in itself.Tucked away in the eastern tunnel under the Helmsley Building (next to Bobby Van's), you would be forgiven if you were to walk by it daily without even noticing it.  There's little in the way of signage and heavy drapes cover the windows.  But pick the right door to open, part the drapes, and you walk into the thick of a robust after-work crowd.With a drink menu that aspires to show some creativity and a small bites menu that includes sushi, Lea has the look and feel of a trendy downtown night spot.The only reason for four stars and not five is that it can get really crowded and therefore difficult to get the bartender's attention.  I prefer to either go early or late, so as to snag a spot at the bar or at one of the perimeter tables that have wait service.Cheers!",
20,,12/17/2015,75,,"Brooklyn, NY",Julissa A.,59,2.0,108,"I would expect more from this place. There is no bottled water, what wine bar doesn't have bottled or sparkly water? Getting my bartenders attention took too much effort(there was two bartenders). I ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc with an order or edema me,shrimp shumai ,and the shishito peppers. Decor wise it's a classics feel that I feel fits the area. What really would impress me is good service. Without good service accompanied by great food you just have a general establishment.

The wines by the glass are thoughtful, and thought pricey, no more so than other similar places. The server attire, dim light and hip music make this veer a bit towards Buddha Bar lounge, but it doesn't go so far that you'll have to dress hipster. I've always enjoyed the vibe, had a good time, and connected with staff, who strike a good balance overall between what Americans expect and what Europeans expect. Part of the charm, indeed. Also, a comment about the food: I've tried only a fraction of the menu, and it was all either ""just fine"" or ""very good"". Nothing killer awesome, but certainly of careful standard.

They had our table ready for us, but it was all the way in the back, near the coat closet and the bathrooms. It was nice to have a more private space, but it really sucked that it had to be in that area. They could've definitely put us in a better position imo.As for food, we ordered the fries, sliders, shu mai, and some pizza. Fries were pretty good as were the sliders. Shu Mai was very moist and soft, but it lacked in flavor. It tasted very bland, just like I had mush in my mouth. I can't remember what pizza I got, but the meat on it tasted funny. The crust and cheese were good, just the meat's a bit weird. The pizza was also a very thin crust, so for you thick fluffy crust lovers, this might not be for you. The bottle we ordered was delicious though. Not sure what we got, but it was very good.Overall, it was an okay place. Food was a hit or a miss. Wine was good, but that really depends on what you order. Service was pretty good though, so I will give them that.",2

I found Lea Wine Bar to be perfect for a smaller group looking for a classy yet intimate after-work happy hour location. The atmosphere is vibrant yet quiet enough for people to carry a conversation. The restaurant started filling up around 6PM when people head over after work. Lea Wine Bar is actually in one of the Grand Central underpasses so is a great location for those who have to take the subway or Metro North afterwards. The servers were all friendly and attractive women while the clientele were mostly men in suits. There is an expansive wine menu but there are also cocktail and beer options. My only gripe is no happy hour specials so expect to still pay the standard $20 for cocktails.

The service is speedy, the appetizers are good (though I wouldn't recommend coming here on an empty stomach since Lea's has a strong emphasis on small plates) and the Riesling is particularly amazing.

We asked to speak to a manager who told us there was nothing she could do. After a full 5 minutes of polite arguing she agreed to take off the cost of one glass of wine, but by that point we were so upset and offended it didn't matter.

49,2,6/27/2012,9,23,"Manhattan, NY",M. R.,18,2.0,114,"Sucks. Person I went with knew the place so I thought it would be all right. WRONG!!! NEVER trust (unhappily) married people when you want a cool place to go for a drink in the summer in NYC.1) Hostess was about 6' tall and so pretentious she looked right past us while we were standing in front of her. We asked for a table, she directed us to the bar tables so we would have had to stand. I asked for a table to SIT at. WTF??? 2) Server: Either very stupid or pretentious. We asked for water - she was confused. 3) She asked what we wanted to order - we asked for the menus: She was confused again. Tip to servers: That's how restaurants go - look at menu, order food. Unfortunately, I do not have menu super powers that allow me to instinctively know whats on the menu without looking at it first.4) We ordered drinks: she was confused again. We ordered a Corona and a Pellegrino which isn't that complicated to understand - or at least it shouldn't be in theory.5) Food. WOW - the food...Crab cakes - three small round pellets that looked like and tasted like cardboard. They came with pink tartar sauce which just added moisture to the horrible things on the plate. Thnk of overcooked Gordon's fish sticks and you'll know exactly what the crab cakes tasted like. Advice to the management: Please ""86"" those crappy two pronged wooden sticks used at state fairs for french fries that were sticking out of one of the crab cakes. I have no interest in eating off of anything that is the equivalent of a small tongue depressor.Ordered the gnocchi samples - decent, but soooo small. They are served in escargot dishes so ONE piece of gnocchi per hole. This means you get six pieces of gnocchi for a meal. YES - SIX PIECES OF PASTA for $8.00 bucks (Or order 3 dishes for $20)6) Food was served, we had to ask for plates, silverware and napkins. This turned into a production for server and busboy: they were both confused at this point. While I could have picked up the cardboard crab cake with my fingers, the gnocchi covered in sauce was not ""finger food"". Common sense is NOT a strong principle at this place.7) Server spent most of her time towering on her gaudy 7 inch heels and more concerned about walking around that actually working. 8) I flagged down hostess to find server, but she said she could take our drink order. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir. First she said OK, then she said ""we""re out of that one. So we pointed to it again, and she said ""No - sorry, we DO have that one"". (we only ordered a glass - not the bottle).9) Ambiance: Not classy at all. The music was so loud no one could hear anyone which may or may not have been a large part in the confusion that seemed to permeate the entire staff. Come on - it was 7pm. There is no need for music so loud it felt like my brain was being shaken loose from my skull.10) This is a place for suits after work who need to get one last drink in before they get on a miserable train to Westchester or CT and have to buckle into their prison cell of domestic drudgery for the evening/weekend.TONS of married guys trying to pretend they got game. Young lawyers pretending to be on an episode of Suits and very, very young people who work in finance pretending they will be a billionaire in the next two years if they keep hanging out with all of the assholes from their office after work at this shitty place.A few tourists and mid-western traveling salesmen types also lingering around which makes sense because of how close it it to Grand Central and not a big deal.Unless this is your only chance you can get a drink before you get on your Metro-North train or have just fallen from the sky because your airplane was plummeting toward Earth as a burning ball of wreckage skip it and try something else.

She ordered a spicy tuna and a yellowtail avocado, but received two identical looking spicy rolls.  After checking with our waitress as to whether those were correct, my friend was informed that she did not specify to make the yellowtail not spicy and spicy is their default version.  Never heard of that before.When my other friend and I received our rolls, we were even more confused.  She had an Alaskan roll and I had a Boston roll, and they looked identical.  And neither actually looked like one of the two.  Again, we had to ask the waitress because this didn't match our order, and she had the sushi chef come out...who proceeded to explain rudely that our rolls both had mozzarella cheese in them....obviously.  Both he and the waitress rudely told us that all ingredients were listed on the menu and each place makes rolls differently.No. the ingredients were not listed on the menu.  And, no, there is never mozzarella cheese in any sushi roll.Overall, terrible.  The service was super slow and filled with attitude.  And though I can only speak for one part of the menu, it was awful.",3

Bombay Sapphire- 0.25 oz. Dry Vermouth- Stirred Over Ice- 3 OlivesSimple enough, yes?Well...  Why is it that when PRECISE measurements are rendered, a bartender goes ahead and decides that the eyeballing technique of measurement would be considered an acceptable means of deployment?  The answer is clear, it's NOT and never should be!  If a bartender decides they don't want to measure and simply wing the measurements, this should be countered to the ordering party to allow for a change in drink preference.The result?  An overtly revolting Martini that rendered excessive contrast and burning feel through the improper balance in portioning of the Vermouth & Gin. Each of the spirits failed to complement one another but rather manufacturing a disfigured composition that was in many ways unappealing and not drink worthy.  Even the consumption of the olives presented with the Martini didn't help with the overwhelmingly improper execution of a classic mixture.$13.00 in the hole and I was down a good drink!  Despite leaving more than half the glass, the impression became clear...  The drink was not meant to be finished.  I immediately headed to the exit after this actualization...Notes on Lea:1) Crowded:  5:15pm entry into the establishment and seating was already unavailable.2) Don't even ask how crowded it gets at 6:00pm3) Whatever you do, do not order a Martini!",9

DIRECTIONS: Let me do my best to try and explain how to get here.  If you're walking west on 45th St. (meaning Grand Central building is on your left), you're going to make a right turn into a tunnel / walkway.  Once you're in there, I believe Lea is the third door on the right.  Of course, my friend and I had to ask three people to make it there ourselves.REVIEW: We hit the place up on a Thursday night, so it was pretty packed at around 6:30 p.m.  We waited for a table for about twenty minutes while sipping martinis.  I had a lychee concoction made from gin -- one of only two gin drinks listed.  It was ok, but nothing amazing.  My friend enjoyed her extra dirty vodka martini.  We were eventually seated and switched to wine (martinis are $12 a pop and most wines are $8).  I liked that there was a complimentary coat check since it was so packed, but of course you still have to tip.  It's nice to know about another stylish bar in the Grand Central vicinity, but I wasn't in love.  For one, while waiting at the bar, we noticed two men who weren't using stools, but had instead positioned coats over them.  I asked if the seats would be in use, and one hastily replied: ""Yes -- by our coats.""  (no hint of a smile)  Hellooo, free coat check, remember?  This rude exchange ALMOST elicited a less-than-ladylike from moi (grr).  Anyway, I agree with those who said the servers are lovely and the decor is definitely cool enough, but I don't know.  While this place has some good stuff going on, and I love me a fancy drink as much as the next girl, there was something about it that gave off a snobby, standoffish vibe.  Not really my thing.  That said, I'll probably give this place another chance on a Tuesday, when I understand ladies drink free (wine) after 8.",5

So after we order drinks, which were phenomenal I might add, our server tells us they have no  rice. Yeah. Half of their menu is sushi and they have no rice. Ok, fine. So sashimi it was. The sashimi was great. Fresh, delicious, excellent variety. The ceviche was also one of the most exciting dishes I've ever had. However, they need to try a little harder with the presentation on that one because laying some sashimi down in a plate and pouring your acid over it is lame. The goat cheese and prosciutto tortizza or whatever they called it was something I wanted to wrap myself up in and live inside. But seriously guys, make a friggen pizza crust. Don't just put it on a friggen tortilla and call that acceptable. It's not unique or clever. A million drunk frat boys are doing it all over the world. Make a real crust and you'll go from 8/10 on that dish to 12/10. All in all I thought it was generally over priced although it was very good. The staff was also lovely. I'd go back... If they promise to have rice and real crust. And C.M., you sound like a pain in the ass. And your precise instructions are nothing short of arrogant and insulting to the barkeep. Precise quantities. Take it easy, Copernicus it's a friggen martini. If you were at my bar I'd have thrown you out and said to find a liquor store and make your martini at home.",
97,1,4/9/2008,12,,"New York, NY",Jasneet G.,0,4.0,46,"Ive been to Lea twice. The first experience wasn't too special, but last night I had a fantastic time! I was really torn btwn giving Lea three stars and four, but my rule is that if I give it 3 stars I won't go back, but 4 means its good enough to check out again - hence, Lea gets 4. It's a hidden gem with a VERY corporate crowd (despite that, I still had a good time). The service was much better last night and the waitress actually knew what she was talking about. I have to say, the food was ridiculously good. I didn't have super high expectations, though, so that may have been a factor. We ordered the ciabattas (pick 3 for $11). We got eggplant and mushroom caviar, Tuna Tartar, and Brie and Beef.  YUM! The tuna tartar and beef and brie were my favorites. Then we got a margherita tortizza - soooo good. I will def be back for the food. Drinks - The wine was pretty expensive. The cheapest bottle of red they had was $48. The martinis were good, but kind of expensive at $12 a pop. This is where my MAJOR dissapointment comes in - they stopped the Ladies drink free after 8:00pm Tuesday nights! :( I was beyond dissapointed. I would def recommend this place for the food, but I think it really depends on what you order. The ciabbata, sushi, and tortizzos are excellent. I have tried some of their other menu items before and wasn't as impressed (rice balls, shumai, etc).",3

Seems to me that the last thing that a wannabe hotspot with a ""location problem"" needs is door attitude. However, the people at the door disagree. They separated the ladies and gents into two lines, let the girls in first, and made the men wait outside for a long period after, keeping both husbands from their wives and gay boyfriends from their gal pals. Couldn't tell you why, as it's pretty spacious inside. The final straw was that they didn't let my friend in despite her being on a birthday party list and everything, all because (we're guessing) she opted to hang back and wait with her boyfriend instead of slip in with the rest of the female pack. Seriously? How very, very rude. It wasn't even that crowded yet. Please get over yourselves, door-people. Pretty, pretty please....I did make it in and stay for a while and for my experience inside I award a bonus star--open bar (or at least open cheap vodka cocktails) for the first hour or so? --yes please!  In addition, the DJ was excellent--he even played the trifecta of middle-school-dance era (for me, anyway) reggae songs.
