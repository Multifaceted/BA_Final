Updated review","I haven't been here since this place used to be Piper's Kilt back in the day... Came here to watch the Giants game with my 9 year old daughter on football Sunday. Ordered the loaded waffle fries, they were AMAZING! Loved the flavor. The ribs were tender to the touch and were SOO delicious. The service was really good, Laura was awesome. I asked them to raise the volume so we could hear the game sound and they were more than accommodating!Unfortunately, that's about as good as it gets as things went downhill. We ordered the cheesecake and it tasted like it came from Costco. Basically it was so-so, but then again idk if spots like these are expected to have great desserts. ‍ Since I was with my daughter, I didn't want to drink alcohol so we ordered apple juices and seltzers. While I kept getting asked if I wanted refills (which customarily are free in this industry), I didn't realize I was getting charged for the refills on the seltzer. I can understand the apple juice. I can even understand actual soda because of the cost of the syrup. But seltzer?? I felt like I was penalized for not wanting to drink alcohol. -___-I may come back on a day I'm not refraining from drinking, but probably not best to come knowing I have to pay the daddy penalty if I don't grab a couple of beers. UPDATE 11/3/18:Came back to grab dinner tonight, had the chicken Parmesan and the loaded tots... they made everything AMAZING!! I'm so glad I gave this place another shot, I'm definitely gonna be here quite often now. Oh yeah; no refill charges so that was great. The whole staff really made tonight an awesome experience. Thanks guys!!!",,,
1,Ben E.,"New York, NY",18,22,0,1.0,10/27/2018,"It is such a shame that this is what has become of Piper's Kilt!  The food isn't nearly as good (it's now mediocre three star pub fare), but the low one star rating was earned by the manager.  My wife and I politely pointed out a discrepancy between the menu and our check to our very nice waitress, who sent her manager over.  It was a small discrepancy and he could have just adjusted it, so it was surprising that he even came to the table. It quickly became clear that he was there to press the issue and create an awkward situation.  He was amazingly condescending, and while he 100% admitted the error on the menu (he claimed it is too expensive to reprint them), he kept making remarks about the fact that we pointed out the discrepancy and he wouldn't leave it alone.  He wanted to make a point, and make us uncomfortable for pointing it out.   When I told him that I didn't appreciate his comments, he claimed that it's because he's Irish, and that he has a sense of humor.  Well here's a local tip from a lifelong New Yorker.  Here we don't find it funny to be condescending and petty to your patrons at a neighborhood place.  It's horrible customer service and a surefire way to lose business.",,,
2,Jenny W.,"Manhattan, NY",75,47,3,1.0,8/4/2018,"My husband, daughter and I made an impromptu stop in for brunch today. At the recommendation of the server, we ordered the avocado toast as well as the eggs florentine. When our food arrived, I was surprised to see that the $13 avocado toast was very small (one piece of toast) and that the home fries were so mushy (despite assurances from our server that they would be crispy). I cut into my poached egg to discover it was not poached at all, but rather hard-boiled. I alerted the server but told her that we didn't have time to wait for them to redo the meal, so said we would just split my husband's eggs florentine. Upon cutting into those ""poached"" eggs, we discovered that they were ALSO hard boiled. We called the server back over and she said she would mention this to her manager. We received a half-hearted apology before leaving hungry and annoyed (how hard is it to poach an egg??)It should be noted that while we were waiting for our food, the table behind us sent back their burger as it was not what they ordered, and as we were leaving the table next to us was complaining about a mix up with their meal as well. It looks like we weren't alone in our experience today and we definitely won't be returning to Tubby Hook Tavern.",,,
3,Carl T.,"Lake Forest, IL",0,4,0,5.0,10/21/2018,Fantastic Experience at the TUBBY HOOK this weekend!   The Pub was our 'Dartmouth Football Parents' Tailgate HQ before the game at Columbia yesterday.  The owners were terrific help - had 'all hands on deck' both in the kitchen and for bar service!  Folks in our group are raving about the pregame atmosphere that the pub provided - and just a short walk to the Columbia Athletic Campus.   Completely Recommend this spot for ANY pre (and post) game events in Inwood!  Go Big Green!,,,

6,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,3.0,1/27/2018,"This is the old Piper's Kilt space. I like what they've done with the space, how they removed the barrier between the bar and main dining space and opened up the area right by the entrance. I also like that the decor above the bar pays homage to Inwood's institutions. It's a good mix of the old and new. We came here on Sunday brunch and there was a healthy crowd but it wasn't packed. I like that your first mimosa is free with an order of a brunch entree. I ordered the breakfast pizza/flatbread while my friend ordered the avocado toast and my fiance had the breakfast hash. Food was good but not stellar. Service was a little slow but we weren't in a rush so we didn't mind it at all. Over all I wouldn't mind coming back again but as far as Inwood brunch spots go, it's hard to beat Indian Road café.",2,,
7,Bruce R.,"Herscher, IL",116,5,2,5.0,7/13/2018,Ate here again after great food last night.  The short rib french dip was so tasty and messy - a good sign.  Opted for the fries - very good.  Girlfriend said the coffee was great - and she's a snob in that direction.,,,
8,Elizabeth K.,"New York, NY",297,141,53,4.0,12/29/2017,Definition of your neighborhood joint that's perfect for a chill night with friends. Seemed like it was really all locals there and had a nice painting above the bar of inwood. Plenty of beers and cider on tap for about 7 bucks each and their wings were awesome. I couldn't finish them. So much food. Also their fries are on point. Don't think you could go wrong with a burger either. Highly recommend if you're in the neighborhood,,,
9,Caroline R.,"Manhattan, NY",133,194,246,4.0,11/29/2017,A lot of renovations have been made since the Piper's Kilt and the place looks fantastic. The menu is fantastic and I think that it is a great improvement to the neighborhood.,1,,
10,Randi G.,"Bronx, NY",44,83,69,4.0,12/27/2017,"I have a weird love for this place. The staff is always so nice, the food is always good and it's just a nice space to be in (I tend to go on of hours/not overly busy weekend hours). When I can't decide where i want to eat, I like this place - it has a little bit of your favorite gastropub staples: burgers, salads, fish and chips, nachos, fried chicken, etc. It's a good place to bring friends for brunch, lunch and dinner and never feel hurried over a good drink and meal.",,,
11,Hannah B.,"New York, NY",694,13,5,3.0,6/3/2018,"This place used to be mine and my bf's go-to neighborhood spot both for late night food/drinks, and especially for brunch. It used to have solid, tasty, comfort-food options at amazing prices. We would wait for them to open every Sunday so we could get in there first thing to cure our weekend hangovers.Lately, we have been unfortunately left completely disappointed every time. We keep coming back to give it another try, yet leave feeling dissatisfied and nostalgic for how it used to be. The chef removes all of the best items from the menu! It's so upsetting. They used to have the most incredible brunch chilaquiles w/fried egg, came in one day to find it was gone. We still returned a few weeks later to enjoy our favorite loaded tater tots and what were we told?--GONE! Off the menu. We left totally discouraged.We found that our usual choices were replaced by pretty forgettable breakfast tacos. I also gave the avocado toast a try, only to find burnt bread with avocado and freezing cold goat cheese with a mountain of sprouts on top. I also gave the burger a try and was essentially just served a pound of under-seasoned meat. Please bring back the best items!!!!! 3 stars for wonderful customer service. The staff here is always very kind, friendly, and attentive.",,,
12,Claudia S.,"Tarrytown, NY",0,16,0,5.0,8/15/2018,"I love great burgers and this is going to be my go place in Inwood, NYC. This is a typical American Pud in a  Spanish Neighborhood. It is right off A train Selec 12. The bartender was attentive, the food was great and  I like the feel of this place. I am glad I found my Burger join in this part of NYC.",,,
13,Gregory B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",64,1,0,5.0,8/21/2018,"Just moved into Inwood, and was looking for a local bar. I waked into Tubby Hook on a Wednesday evening and low and behold I find Jazz, the bar tender. She greeted me, asked me how I was doing and was responsive to everything i said. Which is saying a lot (I talk a lot). Cut to only 2 weeks later. I walk into Tubby Hook, I am greeted by a warm and genuine ""Hello, how are you"" and a Knowladge of what my drink is, it's Jazz. She commands the bar and is always on with whoever is at the bar. Be it someone how had been coming in for years or only two weeks.I come to Tubby Hook for Jazz and her always happy attitude. She knows and understands what matters, the customer. Much love to Tubby Hook and even greater love to Jazz. She has made Tubby Hook the bar I will continue to go to, no matter what.",,,
14,Ashley L.,"New York, NY",259,140,62,3.0,8/9/2017,"This neighborhood bar seems to be at a bit of a disconnect between what you expect and what you get. The ambiance: With a name like Tubby Hook, we were expecting some sort of British themed bar and restaurant, where the furnishing were sparse and old school, the crowd was a bit of a mix and match, and the food was kind of bland but plentiful. The ambiance couldn't have been farther from that. It was a gastropub, a bit too done up for the neighborhood and the name, and looked like it had been furnished by one of the tacky furniture stores on 207th. The outside seating was very nice. The service: Everyone was nice, and constantly checked if we wanted refills or food. The food/drink: The drinks were moderately strong. We tried the loaded tater tots which were quite good. I'll update my review if I ever come back to try more of the menu. I liked that their craft cocktails were whisky and gin based, that's a bit unusual and interesting.",,,
15,Mike L.,"New York, NY",64,6,11,4.0,3/26/2018,"This place has improved since the renovation. Although the booth seating was kind of narrow. Our Servers gave off great energy. I had the PLT ( Pork Belly Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich) It was really good. The fries that came with it though was decent, very thin. Had a Long Island Iced Tea Drink which was spot on and strong as it should be. Would definitely go back!",,,
16,Yanna B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11,27,9,5.0,2/6/2018,"I loved this place, i like the drinks and food.but over all the drinks is were so good. The waitres super great and attentive.

18,Sarah R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",103,136,1,4.0,3/15/2017,"Tubby Hook. Your name makes me uncomfortable. So did the waitress who told me way, WAY too much about her previous evening's debauchery. GURL. I just want to know the drink specials. I'm way out of my comfort zone but I... I like it.I've had some really special chill evenings here. Great drink specials with friendly (maybe a little too friendly) service that's quick and efficient. I'm not a beer drinker but I feel like the many different options they offer might change my mind. The layered tots were amazing, and the onion rings were so good. That perfect ratio of crunch to onion, without the effect of half of a slimy onion falling out when you try to take a bite. My friend's food was served lukewarm, but they heated it up for him real quick without blinking an eye. I appreciate places that can make it right and acknowledge their mistakes.It's a cozy, friendly neighborhood place. I will definitely be back.",6,5,3
19,Kim R.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,8,2,2.0,12/24/2017,"Before i start my review on the place i just want to say that on my visit i went to the bathroom and left my phone call connected while i ran to pee really fast and my brother on the phone heard the waitress complain about a tip and she was talking negativity... Het tough job i get itNot very nice.. before i left i decided  to tip unknowingly of what was said and left... So 3 stars for drink prices$$$ Hey drinks/beers are great i would try to visit during happy hr to see if prices are any better and the crowd is a bit more Lively. I visited on a Saturday night that was pretty dead with only 4-6 people in the entire place. So that set the mood to a already cold boring Saturday. The waitress served me a drunken grandmother that is made w/ whiskey and ginger beer. It was great tasting but prices man...12$ bucks and not as strong as my favorite cocktail called a  ""Dark and Stormy"" from Sage in BK... i also enjoyed the flower power and 90 min beer. (I think that's the name of the beers) Anywho ill try to visit during happy hr with a nice group to try some food otherwise a great addition to the area.",,,
20,Malcolm L.,"Queens, NY",44,59,68,4.0,4/11/2018,"Nice bar, good food and the service is good. Lots of tv around to watch the games. It seems to be a popular spot for college and locals in this area. Just wish parking was a lot easier to find but it's accessible by bus and trains.",1,,1

GrubHub even called them and they confirmed that the error was on their end, but wouldn't do anything to make it right. It's sad because I was excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, but I'll never order from them or go there again, especially since the food is pretty good. Only way I'll eat there is in restaurant.",1,,
22,Shannon P.,"Manhattan, NY",44,31,4,1.0,9/20/2017,"The worst nachos I have ever encountered. Inwood Local's are nearly as bad, but tonight's plate of nachos at Tubby Hook was a new level of hideous bar food. It tasted horrible. The chips were stale. The guacamole was bland. The chili was inedible. It was bad.I miss Pipers Kilt and feel like the new owners don't give a crap about what is being served. I've been many times and it's never been good. But tonight was the last straw. Screwing up nachos is just lazy. Period.",1,1,
23,Melisa M.,"Charlotte, NC",6,8,0,5.0,5/8/2018,Really good food and a break from the usual fare of the neighborhood. Great burgers and wings. The fried chicken sandwich is my personal fave.

24,L E.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,3,2.0,7/29/2017,"I am only giving this place 2 stars because I really appreciated our bartenders and their service. If it wasn't for them I would've gave them 1 star because it's the lowest rating. I ordered jack Daniel's honey on the rocks which on the menu says that's it's $8 but when the bill came, it said it was $10. I thought it was a mistake but when the bartender asked the manager, the explanation he gave was that the menu reflected ""shot prices -1ounce"" he stated that the drink I got was 2 ounces. This was total bullshit. When do you see ""shot"" pricing on the menu???? If you see the pictures I posted the menu clearly states ""drinks.""  What bothers me is the fact that management came up with such a dumb excuse and I'm wondering how many other people got treated like fools by this place. Smh shame on them .",4,,
25,Jesse L.,"New York, NY",9,29,6,4.0,7/30/2018,"Best burger in the neighborhood, and the loaded fries (used to be loaded tots) are excellent.

Definitely recommend!",,,
26,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,2/16/2017,"While appreciate what an institution Piper's Kilt was, and they DID have a really good burger, I'm still steamed over how the bouncer I always encountered was always so rude to my handicapped boyfriend when we went. (I don't hold grudges. CLEARLY. Ha! But, I digress...)Tubby Hook, taking Piper's Kilt old prominent spot on Broadway, is still a nice addition to the neighborhood: a good restaurant with a long menu and a lot of drinks to choose from! I've only had a few menu items so far, but my appetite has definitely been whet and I want more! I've had the Tubby Hook Burger, which is a bacon cheeseburger served with a side of onion rings AND a small bowl of chili. Stretch your stomach before hand. It's necessary. Ha! But it was a delicious burger; the chili could have been a tad meatier, but flavor-wise, it was so on point. I had a few bites of my roomie's Pork Belly Sandwich once, and it was amazing; the pork belly was perfectly crisp get meaty in all of the right places, and the sauce, with a bit of a bite to it, complemented the pork well. The staff is great and we got our food, drinks, and bill all in a very timely manner; we ate quick, but didn't feel rushed to leave as we finished our drinks. Nick, especially, is a wonderful and charming waiter, if I can give a shout out. (And I am!) If y'all go, you'll be lucky if he serves your table, definitely! Piper's Kilt, Inwood will always love and miss you. Still, the Tubby Hook is a good continuation of a cool neighborhood drinking spot with great food.",1,1,

The food (upscale pub grub) is a tad pricey but portions are generous, so you get your money's worth. I'm a huge fan of the fried goat cheese salad. The drink selection is not bad, either. They offer a range of craft beers and decent wines, plus a full liquor bar. A plethora of TV screens are mounted around the space, showing whatever sports events are happening, but it's mostly a place to just hang out, sip an alcoholic beverage, or meet a friend for a bite.

40,KAROL C.,"Bronx, NY",20,74,60,3.0,3/25/2017,"Well, first time here since PK'S closed. Nice to see they kept the chandeliers, most of the original bar area. No division between the bar area and dining takes some getting used to, personally I prefer the division.  Now the food. I had the Philly cheese steak, with salad and sprite. I asked for the cheese on the side because the menu stated, cheese sause. I'm glad I did. I was not sure of the sauce ingredients. The sauce was served in a small bowl, thick and jelled as it sat. I tasted it but did not care for the taste. Short glass for sprite, but I did get a free refill. The sandwich itself was not what I expected either. The hogie roll was not garlic toasted, just very lightly toasted, the meat did not seem fresh, and some pieces were too thick, chewy. The salad, which was pleasant, was served in the same basket as the sandwich, wax paper lined, so the dressing seeped through onto the table! The server, Nicholas, was gracious, and attentive, professional. Overall, I still miss PK's,and this was one time I was here, but not a fan.",1,,

I liked it and I liked the 'vibe of the place, but it's gone and there's no use comparing the two. They are just different things. THT has pretty decent food and the menu is a little adventurous. The beer menu is pretty diverse and good. I'm a fan of the trivia night, which can be fun.  And the service has been delightful and timely. It's also abundantly clear that a younger crowd of people are flocking to this place, which is good, until it becomes difficult to get in because it's one of a few ""trendy"" spots uptown. I can't blame THT for gentrification. It's not their fault. It's one of those small prices you pay for getting nice restaurants. You've got to take what comes with it. Let's just hope the prices stay as reasonable as they are now.",3,,

As the ""ratchet"" hookah serving places are slowly becoming less, this spot has a great energy. You'll feel pretty comfortable from just entering immediately. On the other hand, I really loved Piper's Kilt! Thanks for keeping some of the booths guys. But times change, and Tubby Hook is a great addition to this neighborhood. The food was above average bar fare, I had a short rib poutine which was pretty delicious! There was a fried chicken burger that I'm interested in next time. Besides food, the bar was pretty well stocked. Surprised me with their scotch selection.Can't go wrong coming here.",5,1,1

I heard from locals it was the same owners as Tryon Public House - a very generic bar down by Fort Tryon - so alas, the failures of this place didn't surprise me. Kinda just ""meh"" and uninspired in everything - decor, draft list, menu - and like Tryon Public House, quite over-priced. This is Inwood. Take your $14 burger back to midtown. Also, black suit security doorman on the weekend? Really? If you're in the mood for good lunch bar eats, alas, Piper's Kilt was pretty much the go-to in this area, but if Inwood Local right across the street is open, head there and get yourself a BLT and a beer or cider that isn't Brooklyn Lager or Angry Orchard. Better and less expensive.RIP Piper's Kilt. You and your cheap beers, burgers, and blue plate specials will be missed.This is a two-star review. but I'm leaving it at three stars for now because I don't like hitting new businesses with negative ratings right off the bat. Everyone deserves a chance for feedback and improvement. Here's to hoping that happens.",21,2,2
49,C M.,"Chicago, IL",0,33,0,3.0,11/10/2016,"Had mixed thoughts on Tubby Hook.First, we dined for lunch on the weekend - the place was pretty empty when we were there, and stayed that way throughout (which was kinda nice).  However, the service was just ok - waitress got multiple things wrong on the order...why not just write things down (pet peeve)?  On to the food: the burgers were good...not as good as Piper's Kilt, perhaps they cleaned away too much of the deliciousness from the grill when the management changed.  The fries were enjoyable.  I thought the beers were pretty overpriced for what they were and there is no happy hour.  That's a big downgrade from Pipers Kilt.  One negative, the water that they brought tasted seriously weird - enough to make everyone order something to drink at our table.   Finally, the price - I think the food is overpriced now.  Almost 15 bucks for a normal cheeseburger?  Please, that's rather insulting. Ambiance: this is an upgrade from PK, for sure.  It is much brighter and more modern.  PK was certainly an amazing place to be, but it wasnt stylish, lets be honest.  Overall, they have some improving to do, but I remain hopeful this could eventually be a very good option in the neighborhood.  It's just not there yet.",9,1,1

51,Soy L.,"Putnam County, NY",5,627,57,2.0,2/9/2018,"I was disappointed with my experience today. I ordered the Tubby Burger medium but it was prepared well done. The Mr. Tubbs drink was too watered down, and the side chili tasted like someone had put an extra jalapeño in a can of Hormel. I would bet anything that it was Hormel or Sysco (which is likely Hormel too). The margherita pizza tasted like the old chef Boyardee pizza. The sauce was good but the cheese was flavorless. My date liked the short ribs au jus. Service was inattentive, at best. At no time were we asked whether our meal was ok or whether we needed a soda refill. It was an overall disappointment. I really miss the old Piper's Kilt at this spot.",,,

Updated review","Going to have to dock a star off this place. It's not ready for prime time. The burgers are delicious, but the lack of sound organizational principles makes for a frustrating experience. Sometimes it's 'seat your self,' but other times it's not. It takes forever to get a menu or to do things like order a drink, etc. While I wasn't a big fan of the romanticized Piper's Kilt, it didn't have these basic problems. I'd go elsewhere for a few months until they get this sorted out.",4,2,
53,Aly M.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,0,3.0,6/20/2017,"Factor in the high prices and this place gets a 2/2.5.Here's the thing to keep in mind about reviews: these people don't care. There's just a general apathy to everyone who works in the place - an apathy almost laced with not wanting to be bothered. They look nice enough when you come in, but as soon as you sit down you notice it. Starting with the blasé hostess, to the ""why are you asking for more than a beer?"" bartender, to the manager having a meal at the bar, to the kitchen. And this attitude touches everything. I mean, everything LOOKS good. It has the cleanliness it needs to be a good eatery. The menu is refined and makes you think you're at a kitschy gastropub.But as well thought out as the menu is, they  lacked the foresight to know that you don't serve a $16 salmon burger in a metal basket. And how can you offer high brow items like shaved fennel salad and lemon caper aioli yet look at me funny when I ask for dijon mustard?? And then not have it anywhere in the restaurant?? And by the way - the lemon caper aioli is missing both the lemon and the capers!But I digress. The salmon burger, consistent with the theme of the mirage, looks sooooo mouthwatering when it comes out in its little concession stand basket. However, It seems the only seasoning they used in the fish was parsley. No salt. No pepper. No flavor. It was as dry as a cardboard box. As a chef, I know that you've got a problem when a customer thinks the best thing about the burger is the bread.There's a plus - Delicious bread!I haven't read any reviews about this place yet. I'm going to wager that most of the ones above 3 stars are raving about the tater tots. I'm guessing that because all of the regulars there seem to think the tots are the bomb. What does it say when the best rated thing about a restaurant is a bought food item?Maybe I'll go back in a few months for a beer. Perhaps beer goggles is what's needed to sleep with this dressed up corpse one more time.",2,,
54,Lou M.,"New York, NY",21,23,0,2.0,10/30/2016,"Be very careful how you review this place. For instance if you wonder why you don't get a pickle with your burger, or suggest the red wine isn't very good a person named Sean will call your girlfriend and ban you both from the bar. While that can happen in hours they seem less likely to issue you a refund on your 150+ bill.  If that changes I'll update this review. Be cautious folks.UPDATE - Spoke to Sean who felt it was proper to keep the money collected. Fair enough.",13,6,
55,Trey J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/31/2016,"Sat down unsure of what to expect from a place that had just re-opened a couple days prior. We were pleasantly surprised by the service, food and drinks. My girlfriend had the 'Don't Call Me Tubbs' drink, which is a whiskey, ginger beer concoction. She was very happy with how refreshing and crisp it was. I had a Six Point Bengali beer, a lovely craft beer. She had the sweet potato and squash burger, which she really enjoyed. I had the fried chicken sandwich, which had a nice jalapeño slaw which juiced it up a bit, elevating above a normal fried chicken sandwich. We both loved the handcut fries. The place was nice and busy, but the service did not suffer in any way. It was quick, friendly and helpful. It was great to see the owner run around helping when it got busy. Always nice to see everyone chipping in. We've been waiting for a place like this in Inwood, and we've finally got it. This is what we were hoping Tryon Public House would be when it opened. We will definitely be back, whether for food or just a round or two of drinks. Highly recommended.",5,1,1

61,Anthony A.,"Manhattan, NY",17,7,0,2.0,3/17/2017,"My fellow Inwood residents - do a double check the next time you pay your bill at Tubby Hook.  As long time loyal patron of the Kilt and now TH, I think the renovation is great.  The food is fine - it is what it is - but I am appalled at how they are gouging their guests on drinks.I stopped in last night for a nightcap with a friend and had my usual vodka soda.  I usually don't think anything of it but actually looked at my bill for once. It was then I realized that I was being ""up charged"" $0.75 for having club soda with my vodka.  Up charged for a mixer!  That is unheard of anywhere in this city (having been a bartender at many restaurant/bars across the city for several years).I will certainly think twice from now on about what I order at TH...or more importantly, if I even want to give them my patronage anymore.  That's just greedy business practice.",4,1,

64,Troy M.,"New York, NY",211,12,4,2.0,3/4/2017,"Piper's Kilt needed some updating and I had pretty much quit going because of their rude manager. I had high hopes for Tubby Hook and it's a let down. I gave them a few chances thinking it would get better and it did slightly but the food doesn't come anywhere near that of the Piper's Kilt. The burgers are decent but all of the food I have had is way over cooked, the french fries are just pretty bland and I hate getting served food in a basket on a greasy piece of paper. It feels cheap. I tried the fried chicken sandwich which sounded awesome and it was bland and looked like they cut a chicken finger up and put it on a bun.  While the beer list improved slightly it's still pretty pedestrian.",4,,

I was excited to see a new bar in town but after a few tries have been let down.  The beer selection is below average and the burger tasted frozen and was over cooked. I go to a bar to drink draft beer, but when I went there was none due to some problem with the tap. Weird things happen like you get someone else's dressing on your salad and your dressing as well, but that stuff happened a piper's kilt as well. The reason I would take a trip to pipers were the pitchers, Brooklyn brewery on tap and the burgers.. was like heaven.

75,Lisseth G.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,1.0,5/21/2017,"By far my worst experience in a restaurant ever. I placed a to go order for the tubby burger cooked medium and ordered one of their specialty cocktails while I waited, worst mistake I could of done. I do not remember the exact name of the cocktail, but it had lavender infused The Botanist gin, St. Germain, lemon,and a few other ingredients. It sounded delicious, but when I received it, it was awful. The flavors where unbalanced, the bartender was free pouring so that might be why it was off. At first I thought it was me, but after a few sips I knew it was not good. I asked her for a bit of simple syrup to see if it would help...but no still awful. I am not one to complain, so I completely stop drinking it and just drank water. At no point did the bartender check to see if the cocktail was okay, she just kept chatting away with other guest at the bar who I presume where her friends (based on the manner she was addressing them). After about 15-20 minutes she tells me the burger cannot be done. At that point I lost it. It took her that long to inform me, what type of service is that. The burger should of been done by that time. And I get that they were a bit busy (the outside was full, but the inside was mostly empty), but that is unacceptable. I asked for the check and paid for that awful drink. Before I left I informed the manager about my awful experience, but he did not care by his response and tone. What a complete disappointment.",2,,

I've tried the mozzarella sticks which were decent but I will miss PK's version. I had the mild wings but will definitely get medium next time. The fries were good too!

Got drinks right away and food was delicious. I ordered a burger  and it was like an orgasm in my mouth, I almost had to go to the bathroom to change my undies. After the first bite i I had flashbacks to losing my virginity. The cheddar cheese tasted like it was just churned in the Green Mountains of Vermont, the beef tasted as if it had been slaughtered that very day on a Japanese Wagyu cattle farm, the bun as if it was a baked by an artisan in the hills of Tuscany, the bacon so fresh it would make George Orwell weep. If Gordon Ramsay walked into this place he would be left speechless for the first time in his life. Ted Allen would chop himself after eating there. Guy Fieri's frosted tips would wilt upon tasting this awe inspiring burger. And can someone give all the uncultured, uncouth heathen, cry babies a warm bottle, complaining about how it's not the pied pipers kilt, give me a break. Wah wah wah, they don't have chicken fingers, grow up Peter Pan, chicken fingers are for toddlers. Wahhhh they put my burger in a basket, I need a plate! Deal with it you slob, put the food in your mouth and chew it, no plate necessary. Wahhh it's too expensive. Well cook a burger at home on your shitty George Foreman grill or get a new job you broke bitch. Overall very happy with this new addition to the neighborhood! Keep up the good work",3,5,
