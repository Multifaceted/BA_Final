0,Saddmun A.,"New York, NY",268,123,22,4.0,9/25/2018,"My friend suggested this spot after a great experience at another location. As a self-proclaimed salad connoisseur, I knew I had to see what her hype was about. Turns out it was okay! It works like this - you grab a salad bowl with greens of your choice, hand it to them and choose your ingredients and dressing, and then they chop it up for you. There isn't anything super special about the salads they prepare, however the salads are very reasonably priced. I stuffed mine full of a ton of stuff and it came out to ~$12. The staff however was super friendly despite being very busy during the lunch hour.",,,
1,Simon W.,"London, United Kingdom",117,528,91,4.0,10/10/2017,"Quite acceptable soups , salads and sandwiches; super efficient staff. Chicken noodle soup very satisfying ( at $6.25 for a 16 oz serving).",,,
2,Jacklyn S.,"Manhattan, NY",178,48,16,3.0,1/19/2018,"Ordered a chicken Caesar wrap through the new Ritual app... it tasted fine but there was no Caesar dressing, minimal cheese, and there were tomatoes in the wrap? Really not a chicken Caesar. Will not order again.",,,
3,Sarah V.,"London, United Kingdom",63,155,328,4.0,12/16/2015,"We stumbled across this place on the way to Times Square. We were up at about 5am because of the jet lag & it was one of the only places open!The staff were really friendly & talked me through the options. I went for a standard cream cheese bagel & a cup of tea (you can take the girl out of England...)Service was quick & it was reasonably cheap, I'm impressed!",2,1,1
4,Qian W.,"Queens, NY",327,350,61,2.0,8/25/2016,"Please don't order on seamless.I ordered a large chicken pot pie on their daily specials, except its not a pie... just the soup.",2,4,4
5,Sarah S.,"New York, NY",0,30,0,1.0,2/15/2018,Why is the cashier so hostile? Never smiles. Never offers to put your items in a bag or give paper napkins. Plus the guy behind the bread stand could take some basic lessons in English. Place of last resort.,,,
6,Praveen K.,"New York, NY",0,29,0,3.0,2/3/2018,Sandwiches are good but a bit pricy. My favorite is blackened chicken which is just chicken breast with a tomato slice in a baguette. Charging that much for it doesn't make sense. Tuna sandwich is good. Soups are a good option too.,,,
7,Veggie M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,2,1.0,11/13/2015,"I would actually like to give this place 5 stars cos the shop looks nice and the staff are so dear - but the lingering butt-like taste of chicken from their salad is still in my mouth. I'm a vegetarian, so I always order carefully. However, their salad bar is cross-contaminated and I got lots of chicken chunks in my salad. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why my salad tasted like butt until I spat out the mangled flesh of a chicken. Then I thought, ok maybe just one thing no problem, but then i took a big mouth of crouton - which was actually another fat chunk of chicken. I haven't stopped vomiting in my mouth. I have previously had a sandwich, which i thought would bring me better luck, but I think it was made on the same counter as pig, so yeah... not really an enjoyable flavor if you're not used to meat.It grossly unfair to pay so little consideration for vegetarian customers, hence the low rating.",2,3,

9,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,4.0,4/19/2014,"Dear Devon & Blakely, Thank you for delivering my spicy corn and crab chowder and kale salad, even though I'm just across the street. Thank you for massaging the kale in the salad, and not allowing it to be a raw bitter reminder that I'm only ordering a salad because my mother says I'm fat. Thank you for your delectable selection of English chocolate bars and super efficient check out ladies. Thank you for making your soups with love and variety. Thank you for the guy who mans your phone, who picks up quickly and is quick to correct any weird orders or sold out items. Thank you for offering plenty of cooked vegetable sides and giving me options to eat healthily without resorting to rabbit food. Your soups and kale salad make my tummy happy.For others considering this Devon & Blakely location, the food is delicious and the service is great. However, on the Midtown Lunch scale, its not very affordable, easily passing the $10 mark for a meal. I also dislike the layout of the store, which is very narrow and can cause some line up confusion when it gets busy. The salad line is right next to the beverage case all the way in the back, causing traffic jams. The sandwich line blends into the prepared salad line where there isn't always a person to help you out with that tasty kale apple salad. They do Seamless delivery orders (and I've never had an issue) but I realize that not everyone wants to pay for delivery. So this may not be a winner for everyone.",2,4,1
10,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,3.0,1/13/2014,"I come to Devon & Blakely when I'm in the mood for soup - they may not have as wide a variety as Hale & Hearty does, but I feel like their soups are actually heartier and tend to be a bit more flavorful. Aside from that, they're pretty much your standard sandwich/soup/salad lunch joint in Midtown. If there's one thing that's a negative standout, it's that their breakfast sandwiches are pre-made. Call me old-fashioned, but having an egg wrap that was clearly cooked sometime in the indeterminate past is not my idea of an appetizing breakfast. Neither is a breakfast sandwich that has tomatoes - but if you want it without them, they will simply open up the wrap and yank them out. Their lunch wraps are a bit more appetizing and varietal, although they seem to have a twist on everything (e.g. you can't get a straight tuna wrap - it'll have spicy tuna in it).That said, I do like their soups, and the corn bread you can pick up as a side (for $2.25) is actually quite well-done - not overly corny (ha, ha...) but not as buttery as a lot of your typical corn bread/corn muffins are. There are worse lunch spots, but at the same time, there are some that are probably better choices. For a joint like this, it's really a matter of convenience.",,2,
11,Mila K.,"ASTORIA, NY",123,83,19,1.0,2/19/2016,"Worst place ever. Food is disgusting and over priced. Everyone is so rude! I used to come here for their tomato vegetable soup on occasion and it was decent, but expensive. Today I came in for a pre made veggie sandwich with a pickle slice and it came out to $11! That's just crazy. I asked them if they rang me up correctly and they were straight up mean to me! I left without buying anything. Avoid at all costs !!",1,,
12,Chrissy C.,"Jersey City, NJ",339,403,17,4.0,9/13/2014,"I am a sucker for a chopped salad. There is nothing more enticing to me than picking out whatever I want in a salad and watching as someone beats the hell out of it, douses it in dressing, and then neatly serves it to me in a plastic bowl. It's like a party. Meat and vegetable fiesta!I recently started working over in Midtown, and when I saw D&B I was so nostalgic for my daily visits back when I worked in the World Fi center. I come here every Friday, because I am old and lame and bring my lunch the first four days of the week. My order is as follows: romaine salad, grilled chicken, avocado, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers and jalapenos. CHOPPPPPEEDDDD with salt, pepper and red wine vinegar. Voila! For $8.50, I am stuffed.They offer bread sometimes, but being gluten (and general carb-) avoiding....I decline.Solid lunch spot.",2,2,1
13,Yumi I.,"Brooklyn, NY",517,24,0,1.0,11/18/2014,"I've only tried their soups, and they're good. However, the staff at the register are the worst . They don't understand the concept of ""i want to pay separately."" Instead, they charge both soups on the same card, but swipes twice. Seriously?? This has happened twice. What's the point of that?? In another ""wut"" moment, I asked the woman behind the counter to put the soups in different bags (one is for myself, the other is for my boss) . She proceeds to take out everything in the bag and tries to put them literally in a different bag, until I stopped her. Another wut????? moment . The register staff here are the worst . They're all rude or lack common sense. Why does Devon and Blakely hire these people??",1,2,1
14,Stuart B.,"New York, NY",1179,586,39,3.0,12/30/2014,"I only come here to wait for a bus that my company runs which stops outside.  I've had muffins and coffee here.  Never had an issue buying these things and sitting inside until my bus arrives. They have limited seating, but this is not a sitdown lunch type place.  It's mostly for take out.",,,
15,Grace K.,"WHITESTONE, NY",190,70,0,5.0,1/29/2017,"Devon has a great selection, and service is fast and attentive, even during the busy lunch hours. I come on a regular basis for lunch to order a large bowl of their soup - I can choose from tomato vegetable, lentil, French onion, etc.",,,
16,Morgan D.,"New York, NY",81,138,203,5.0,10/13/2015,"literally come here every day for lunch. their cranberry chicken salad is delicious, also think their chopped salads are great as well - they have a variety of dressings which always helps. it's not too pricey - my salad usually ranges about $8;50 - 9.50 with several toppings.also LOVE their soups - new england clam chowder, lobster bisque, spicy corn and crab...all very delicious, great spot for a quick lunch to sit or grab to go!",,,

19,Nadia B.,"Princeton, NJ",357,542,61,4.0,4/23/2014,"YUM! Tasty and pretty cheap! It cost 10 bucks for a VERY healthy, filling lentil soup and tuna specialty sandwich. The delivery took maybe 20 minutes? It was really fast. Comments on the food, I wish they could call you and let you know they couldn't do one of the things I requested. Like, to add mayo or aoili to one of the sandwiches would seem pretty easy (and needed for sauce girls like me) but they didn't ! :-( i'LL SURVIVE since the food was still good. But still, maybe add a little bit of mayo/sauce on the side for me? Especially since it wasn't a pre-packaged meal like some of these delis have. The lentil soup was the stand-out for me. I usually have to add salt/pepper to make it the way I like it but this was delicious! I still like mine with a little bit of lemon/acidity (like turkish or afghan spots eat their lentil) BUT this was american lentil soup and I got over it... If you just got the soup, some corn bread, that would have been enough for a lunch. I will definitely be ordering from here... it's really healthy, filling, not too bad for the wallet and just overall a GOOD tasting lunch. Will be ordering their famed seafood chowder next time.",,,
20,Tom S.,"Minneapolis, MN",8,7,0,5.0,9/28/2016,"My first day visiting New York. Was looking for a small bite to eat. Walked in, it was crazy busy. They were very prepared for so many people.  I didn't wait more than 60 seconds for anything. And the soup and sandwich were amazing. We need one of these I'm Minneapolis. And when it came time to pay the woman was so nice. I'll definitely be back again!",,,
21,Jon K.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,6/18/2014,"To add some context I'm a pretty big soup fan, always have been. So I'm strolling through my lunch hour looking for a new soup spot and I see Devon & Blakely's sign outside flaunting the 12 soups available. I meander into the store, critique the soup display and purchase a hot, 16 oz. cup of Chicken Noodle. A Classic. Can't go wrong.Wrong. The chicken was diced and off-colored, dog-food-esque. Lack of carrots. No other veggies visible besides a scattered diced celery. Come on! If you're gonna make Chicken Noodle, make Chicken Noodle! It's the easiest soup and the best! A staple in the American Food department. Broth was okay, which is why I slurped the soup to the bottom. Also, free bread. Big plus and reason it gets a 2/5. This review is based off the Chicken Noodle Soup alone. I cannot comment on any of their other food options. Good, free bread.",,,
22,Robert L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,4,0,4.0,5/2/2014,Got a soup from here after an appointment nearby. Great soups and sandwiches. I ordered the turkey chili and it was good. Cornbread was awesome and there were crunchy bits in it..I dont know what it is but it was good. The spicy clam chowder soup looked good too,,,
23,Sean C.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,496,22,4.0,11/23/2011,"I like the atmosphere here. It feels very clean, the guys behind the counter joke with you and they don't skimp on the fillings. I had the italian but they seem to give you hearty helpings of meat.",,,
24,Phil T.,"Cleveland, OH",129,92,68,4.0,12/21/2011,"What I like:- This is my midtown soup spot. They make their own soups every day.  These are the best ""commercial"" soups I've ever heard.  I'm talking about the Turkey Gumbo and the Spicy Crab Chowder. Oh and for homemade they seem reasonably priced. Winning.- Salad ingredients actually seem slightly fresher than a lot of midtown spots.- Did I mention you can get soup samples? Did I mention this is my midtown soup spot for good reason? And they give you bread when you checkout? Icing on the cake.- ""A"" rating on the window.What I don't like:- Salads are a little pricey vs competitors.  And if you get there at peak time the guys are not messing around, it's like they hand out Red Bull's to the employees before lunch hour.- No hot bar that I saw, so if there's a last minute change of heart I'm S.O.L. Sandwiches are average to below average, so it's hard to go soup/sandwich combo.",,,

27,Brat T.,"New York, NY",0,241,1,1.0,2/27/2015,the ONLY reason to go is for the convenience of the location. Over priced for what you get. the chicken at the salad bar doesn't taste fresh and their breakfast sandwich of egg and ham really doest have ham but tomatoes. they use cheap cups for their coffee so the coffee starts to taste waxy after a few hours. the cashiers rush you and are rude.,,,
28,Jennifer Z.,"Oakland, CA",64,14,0,4.0,8/5/2009,"My coworker brought me here for our one-on-one (I'm an intern) at the beginning of the summer, and ever since I've kind of been hooked on it.  It's just another one of New York's many soup/salad/sandwich shops (think Pax, Europa, etc.) -- but I like it more, by far... Maybe it IS the wallpaper? Or maybe it was just their freaking delicious eggplant & hummus sandwich on soft, pillowy multigrain bread (yes, I used the word pillowy).Or their vegetarian lentil soup.  Not only is it delicious, but it's substantial and filling.  Mmm.  The salad man scared me today, though.  He was like the Soup Nazi from Seinfield, except with salad... These New Yorkers don't joke around, man -- you gotta know what you want in your salad by the time you go up to order.  They don't seem to tolerate window shopping.  =P",2,3,2

32,Tiffany T.,"New York, NY",32,230,2,5.0,10/5/2007,"I walked into this midtown lunch hot spot with a cheerful step.  Suits to my left, suits to my right, good eats straight ahead!  I surveyed the sandwiches, soups, salads and desserts.  What to pick?  Then I saw it.  Spinach and mushrooms topped with parmesan and sandwiched between a quarter round of dark brown-crusted bread with a light dusting of flour.  I wanted it.  Just the look of the dark crust screamed flavor.The deli guys seemed very used to the crowds.  He offered to heat my sandwich, which delighted me, but I later found out that the bagel toaster he used doesn't heat it through.  Just $5.95 for a quality sandwich.Just as I thought it would, the sandwich was delish!  Oh, yum, the best sandwich I've had in Midtown yet.  The veggies were cooked just right - not too salty.   Bread was chewy on the inside with a grain-y flavor.  Crust was crisp and had that chewy tear.  Cheese provided the perfect saltiness factor.  Yeah...good stuff...",2,,
33,Angela L.,"Highland, NY",3,113,57,5.0,10/25/2005,"Midtown East can be a barren place to grab something quick, and I offer you Devon & Blakeley as an above-par salad-and-sandwich place. I find myself picky with deli tuna, sensitive to too much mayo and boring bread, but D&B has a delicious tuna salad with just the right amount of celery mixed in, and a huge selection of fresh breads, from pumpernickel to French to Kaiser. Of course, their salads are good too (try the fat-free raspberry vinaigrette) and you must sample one of their many chocolaty desserts. A hint for those who work Midtown East: they also deliver/cater!",,,1
34,Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",42,308,54,1.0,3/7/2012,"I will agree with Sean C and say that their sandwiches do not lack hearty fillings and I will also agree with Phil T regarding the soup varieties. I work right around the corner as well, so this spot gets an "" A "" grade for convenience, but I cannot give this DEVON & BLAKELY located at 250 PARK AVE five starts like most other yelpers have and here is why. Their cashier's are absolutely rude and abrupt. I don't mind a joke or two at the sandwich counter, and honestly at the end of the day I just want my sandwiches fresh and filling. Jokes don't make up for the cashier's violently shoving napkins and utensils into your brown bag, practically throwing your change in your face, and abruptly and aggressively throwing your merchandise to the side and screaming, ""NEXT!"" in your face as I'm given less than a second to collect my change off the floor and pick up my expensive lunch that is now perilously hanging over the side of the counter. A soup and a sandwich will cost you $13 after tax. I do not pay $13 to have my hardearned money thrown back in my face as if it means absolutely nothing to this establishment. You want my continued business, then show me that you do. And I don't just speak for myself, I see this happen to customers whenever I am there for lunch. They have the most angry disgruntled looks on their faces, and when I ask them a question or try to strike up a friendly conversation, they stare blankly in my face as if they are exasperated that I am standing there.  The reception is absolutely nasty and delivers an ""F"" grade level of customer service. This type of low class behavior and terrible service reminds me why it's worth bringing my own home-prepared lunch to work instead of forking over my hard earned money at places like this. It would make sense if the lines at the cashier are unruly and they are trying to do the customers a favor by moving transactions along quickly and ""efficiently."" However, I have observed every single time that they will exhibit this same rushed, abrupt, unfriendly service even if there is no line at the register. It seems they are just generally unhappy people or this cafe's management  fosters a negative work environment for them. Maybe they are just inherently nasty. Really, does no one else see this?",2,1,

36,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1146,1258,14,3.0,1/23/2009,"BEST CORN & CLAM CHOWDER! I'm in midtown for a project so I thought I would stay somewhat close to my job, as duty calls. Thus, my visit here. First of all, you sound like a tag team wrestling duo. Either that or a personal injury law firm aka ambulance chasers. Anyway, I didn't know you were a chain, but your soup is darn good. Sammiches, well, let's just say my pressed sandwich was still cold in the middle and leave it at that. I ordered a large spicy corn and clam chowder ($6.25) my first trip there. It came with a slice of whole grain bread which was soft and fresh. The soup was quite jizzmatic, as it had kick as well as plenty of clam pieces. Not overly chunky, but just enough to satisfy as a light meal. Today I got a Chicken Milanese Sammich ($7.95) and it tasted like mush. Heck, there were beans in my sammich. Sometimes it doesn't pay to ask the amigo behind the counter for recommendations. I think I'll try their chicken/tuna/egg salads ($4/sm, $8/lrg) next week. Pricing isn't cheap, but it's a fast alternative for the grab-n-go crowd aka me right now. It is with great regret that I will have to downgrade your review due to weak sammiches. I should've known better, really. I'll stick to the freshly made stuff from now on.Pics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…",1,,
37,Jordan S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,4/24/2013,"While I agree with the other posters about the quality of the food and the oversized portions (especially in the wraps - not talking Chipotle sized, but definitely worth writing home about) the downfall to this place is the staff at the register. I buy the ""usual"" here at least once a week - and they're hardly nice but never have been rude. This last week, coincidentally, I've gone all 3 days and purchased said ""usual"" - for $7.95 plus tax (price written on wrapper by the assemblyman) - and my diet snapple (which is scanned via barcode, assumingly for inventory purposes). At any rate, my wrap increased to $8.45 today - I know, 50 cents is hardly worth raising a stink over, but I was just curious, ""oh, is this just Wednesday's price or was there a permanent increase?"" smiling sheepishly. She said they ""didn't raise prices and that I pay the same thing everyday."" I noted the two receipts from Mon/Tues in my wallet and tried showing her at which point she shoved my bag to the side and said ""have a nice day"". Luckily, its 70 out and I will have a nice day. Unfortunately for D&B, one day's $.50 gain apparently outweighs the next several years (if I live to see 30) of consistent business from their work neighbor- and yes, there's plenty of other places in midtown that sell the same thing. So long, DB, it was nice while it lasted.",,1,
