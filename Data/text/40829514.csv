0,心怡,"New York, NY",74,16,80,4.0,11/9/2018,"Simple carbohydrates give me simple happiness.My friend and I had brunch at Clinton Street Baking Company which is famous for its pancake, waffle and notoriously long wait.For weekdays, the wait is not too terrible, about 30mins and you can walk around in the neighborhood.The pancake I had is fluffy and not overly sweet. They mix blueberries in the batter as well. However, it taste a bit dry when you finish half of it.The French toast is even better. Crispy golden outside and tender inside, the brioche toasts is to die for. The caramelized banana and pecans make it even better.Overall the food are tasty, worth the 30 minute wait on weekdays but maybe not the 2 hour wait at weekends.Tip: cash only. If you really hate the wait and do not mind having brunch at night, actually their diner opens for reservation.",,,
1,Courtney A.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,114,82,3.0,11/18/2018,"We came here on a Friday morning to see what all the hype was about and sadly we were so disappointed. Nothing we got really jumped out at us and everyone raved about the pancakes and those were just mediocre too. We waited about 20 minutes outside in the cold since it was beyond packed in the waiting room. Then once our number was called we were taken to the area next door to the restaurant that looked like they had just opened it to seat guests. I got the buttermilk biscuit sandwich. The biscuit was so dry I had to drink my iced tea just to not choke on it. I would describe the house made tomato jam as literally just tomato sauce, nothing special about it. There was an abundance of eggs on the sandwich and those were cooked perfect. My boyfriend got the blueberry pancakes and bacon. He said they tasted just like regular pancakes and was not impressed. I say skip this place, there are way better places all over manhattan. They are also cash only, which I feel is dumb. For a restaurant as large as they are (not like they are a small food truck on the corner), why not accept cards? You almost feel limited to what you can buy and it seems to be an inconvenience because not every carries cash.",,,
2,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,50,2.0,11/17/2018,"This was mediocre at best.I was excited to come here because I heard good reviews. And mainly because we wanted fried chicken. And biscuits. And cornbread. We got the biscuit basket which was filled with mini biscuits (And not really in a basket) that weren't really that great just a little buttery but the raspberry jam was pretty good. The butter was in little packets which is not that high quality. The chicken plates we ordered (sandwich and chicken platter) was arrived semi warm after we decided to finish the biscuits even though we really just wanted our dishes delivered to us. I really wish they didnt wait for us to finish those biscuits before they delivered the food... we watched another table receive their food first even though their party came much later. The chicken was ok, the fried green tomatoes were too deep fried, not the fried green tomatoes I know of. The cornbread was so dry like the atacama deserts, we barely touched that. I don't think it was a cornbread even though we were promised a cornbread. The cole slaw was good but the honey tasted really weird... Or whatever it was.  We didn't really have a waiter but the bartender was really nice I think that's the only reason why I am giving a 2 star instead of a 1. She was the only lively person in the room. Super friendly and cute. The waitress/waiter was no where to be found and the hostess was ok... not that attentive. Honestly if you want biscuits and chicken go on a uber/lyft to pies and thighs in brooklyn.",,,
3,Maria G.,"Boston, MA",100,1005,5012,2.0,11/4/2018,"Another racist NYC establishment?Granted, my one-time experience here was years ago, back in 2015 or 2016. At that time, I didn't want to write about it. But now that I look back, I think it is important to make my voice heard on here.My Asian friend and I showed up at around 8:40 AM on either a Saturday or Sunday and there was already a line wrapped around the corner. I've heard so many good things about this place from my NYC friends and had always wanted to stop by. When we finally visited here and got in line, we were excited. The corner restaurant looked very well lit and seemed spacious enough for an NYC establishment. We were also excited about the food.A lady was directing the crowd, once it was around 9 AM. She gestured the white couple in front of us to go to the main section of the restaurant (to the left). When she asked how many people in our party, we said two, she said to the right. I was so confused and then realized there was a back room.Once my Asian friend and I sat down in the back room, we realized that most patrons (not all) in this back section were people of color. We felt kinda grossed out. But we decided to eat here anyway; especially we are used to being treated as second-class citizens from time to time. I was unhappy, but this was not my first time being seated in a like a colored room. My first time being seated separately from the white patrons at a restaurant was documented here, yelp.com/biz/le-cirque-n…That said, the food here was decent. I just don't know if I'd want to come back. I want to say it is implicit bias, but I don't want to accuse them being racist simply due to my one-time experience. Might be an off day. Hey, if I do return, I will make sure to bring my white friends, so I would have a higher chance of being seated in the main dining room?",16,9,10
4,Seth W.,"New York, NY",6,180,127,4.0,11/8/2018,"Traditional brunch but with a less frill-filled feeling. Generous portions, delicious food, and a decent wait. They utilize a text system/line viewing app to see where you are on the waitlist - pretty clutch. Go grab a drink in the neighborhood while you wait. Table pancakes. Huevos Rancheros.",,,
5,Hannah V.,"Flushing, NY",222,232,687,3.0,10/29/2018,This popular spot is always packed with tourists so I highly recommend coming here later in the afternoon or on a weekday to avoid the brunch crowd. My friends and I both got Fried Chicken & Waffle (I know I know but honestly they don't have that many options). I wasn't particularly impressed with this dish here. The fried chicken was crunchy yet you can find much better one at Sweet Chick. Am I the only one who doesn't understand the hype around here?,4,,1
6,Kimberly W.,"Brooklyn, NY",371,256,245,5.0,11/15/2018,Loved this place!  Saw it on both IG and Yelp so I felt fairly confident it would be good.  Came here for brunch and luckily didn't have to wait long.  I had the eggs benedict but I also wanted a pancake or waffle so luckily my girlfriend also wanted sweet and savery so we split the waffle with whipped cream.  I loved both of the dishes were so perfect.  The hollandaise melts in your mouth.  Waffle has a nice crisp and whipped cream was fresh!  Can't wait to come back again.,,,
7,Angela L.,"Washington, DC",183,103,113,3.0,10/23/2018,"I was so excited to try out this restaurant because it had been on my list for a very long time.  MY friends and I arrived at the restaurant on a Tuesday around 11.  When I was reading reviews about this place, I was surprised to see that there could be a wait even during a weekday, so I made sure to join the waitlist on Yelp while I was nearby.  Yelp allowed me to join the waitlist when I was a mile away from the restaurant.  We actually didn't have to stay on the waitlist for a long time.  There were three of us, and I think we waited for less than 30 minutes.  When we were leaving around noon, there was a fairly long wait although it was a Tuesday.I had the pancakes with the blueberries since I had read so much about it.  I don't frequently eat pancakes, but I didn't really think these pancakes were any special.  The service was okay.  I am glad I can now cross this restaurant off of my list.",1,1,1
8,Gabby F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",51,56,208,5.0,10/20/2018,This is the type of breakfast place you want to try. It's also the type of restaurant you go to and stuff your face and end up not eating the rest of the day. We were a party of 6 and we got seated fairly quickly but sometimes their lines are long. Their most popular dishes are the blueberry pancakes and the fried chicken and waffle. I definitely recommend getting either one or both if you're brave. The service was good and we were treated well. The food came out fairly quickly and everything ordered was delicious.,2,,3
9,Sandy L.,"New York, NY",206,63,137,2.0,10/16/2018,"A little disappointed today, coming back from LA. Been craving for this amazing pancakes. Had order a banana walnut pancake to go, my usual. After picking up my order, I wanted to just take a bite in the car. I realized, the second n third tier was burnt pancake. I told my boyfriend I'm going back in to exchange, cause when food is burnt or with charcoal you can't taste the real deal of the food. Nice enough the hostess went to ask for a exchange for me with the chef.  I would believe that they will do a better job the second time, so I didn't look inside the container until I got home. So sad $16-$17 pancake only have one that is edible",2,1,1

11,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",376,678,30533,5.0,9/19/2018,"a house built upon amazing pancakes, outrageously good waffles, other tasty breakfast comfort eats, and other savory dishes as well. Clinton Street Baking Company is a shining beacon of simple comfort foods...outshining many other places that sling similar dishes. simple pleasures are often not that easy to execute consistently in terms of food. thankfully CSBC does.cash is KING here--which means CSBC only accepts it as legal tender. sorry credit/debit card carrying peeps. loli don't understand why people wait on line on weekends for brunch when you can order anything from the breakfast & lunch menu 'til 4 pm all 7 days of the week and they even serve part of the breakfast menu as part of the dinner menu. a medium-ish space. friendly to eye in terms of color and decor. the set-up isn't all that cramped. you get sunlight on both sides of this corner joint. seating options range from small tables, larger banquette-style seating options, and solo seats at the counter/bar. basically, if there is await...you put your name on a list, the restaurant texts you when your table is ready--the wait really only happens for weekend brunch. there's barely any wait at other times. also, you could just do takeout which is a breeze. and if you live in the area, you can order delivery Mon-Fri for lunch and/or dinner.i don't look for a breakfast or lunch menu to be imaginative, at all. all i want it to be is GOOD, simple, and full of comforting loads of calories. and guess what? the food is GREAT, it's simply awesome and to-the-point, and filled to brim with savory comforting calories. without a doubt, order the pancakes at least once. i am partial to the blueberry ones + maple butter syrup. i find the banana walnut as well as the chocolate chunk to err too often on the sweet side for me. the eggs benedict will rock your morning and put you into a caloric coma. the eggs bennies are great with the maple ham or the +$ salmon upgrade. either will be satisfying to hangry breakfast fans.the huevos rancheros is totally under-rated. order it and be overwhelmed by a barrage of calories and sleepiness. don't underestimate how good this dish is. it doesn't disappoint.the burgers are delightful.the bacon, though, is underwhelming. not worth the side item order charge...it's neither super crispy nor superfatty...it sorta rides the middle of being just okay but is probably fab to pig rookies.the service? always good and genuinely friendly.drops mic cuz i'm dropping into a carb comai outzzz",19,14,16
12,Pamela T.,"San Jose, CA",553,3,4,5.0,11/6/2018,"I've always walked by this place on my way to brunch around the area and always noticed the huge crowd of people outside. They don't take reservations for brunch so this weekend I finally decided to walk in and put my name down! They use a nice app that tells you how many parties are ahead of you, which is nice so you can estimate when you should start heading back to the restaurant. At 11:30pm, there were 54 parties ahead of us, so I was able to go home, finish laundry, take a nap, and still make it back in time for my table to be ready.After finally sitting down, we ordered their famous blueberry pancakes and chicken & waffles with warm maple butter to share. I don't know if it was because of the 2 hour wait, but for someone who usually isn't a big fan of pancakes, these were a m a z i n g. The waffles went so well with the maple butter and juicy chicken, but I do wish they gave you the option to choose between white or dark meat like other places.Definitely recommend this place! But personally i'd come in the evening since they still serve their pancakes for dinner - without a 2 hour wait.",1,,
13,Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1705,1634,25452,5.0,10/27/2018,Excellent spot for breakfast in NYC. This place gets extremely busy and the wait could be long but it's worth it. I was by myself so I was seated quickly at the bakery's bar. I ordered an egg white Clinton St Omelet with bacon and cheddar. It what delicious as were the hash browns.,11,6,12
14,Magda S.,"New York, NY",76,160,390,4.0,11/4/2018,"Every time we dine at Clinton Street we love it. The food is so good and the staff is very nice. They don't have a gluten-free menu but happy to accommodate if need. And the honey bacon is just delicious. The wait is very long, but worth it.",,,
15,Tina T.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,36,51,5.0,9/18/2018,"Heard a lot about this place for bunch but I didn't want to wait in the horrible line so came here for dinner instead. Some people have a problem with breakfast for dinner but I, personally, am a HUGE fan. Made a reservation right when they opened at 5:30 pm on a Friday and virtually no one was there. There was absolutely no line for the entire hour or so that we ate there so if you want to try Clinton Street Baking you should definitely come for dinner! They start you off with their housemade biscuits which come with some butter. The biscuits were warm and delicious! For my main meal, I got the salmon benedict and the best part of the entire meal was the latkes! There is definitely crack in those latkes cuz the favor was amazing and you just keep wanting more! It's perfectly deep fried and every crunchy bite compliments the poached eggs!  My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles which was also amazing. The chicken is crispy and the waffles are soft and fluffy. The most memorable part of that dish was the butter they have on the side. It tastes like liquid toffee and I know it's not okay but I would totally put it in a cup and drink it... TL;DRSolid breakfast food. Eat breakfast for dinner. Don't wait in line.",,,
16,Dizzy G.,"Queens, NY",22,54,206,4.0,8/28/2018,"This was my second visit to the Clinton Street Baking Company, and I found myself pleasantly surprised with most of the food. My dinner date and I split: * Queso Mac - N - Cheese* Crispy Idaho Potato Skins* Veggie Burger with Vidalia Onion Rings* Classic Hot Fudge SundaeAll the food was good, especially the veggie burger, but the reason I gave CSBC 4/5 was because of the hot fudge sundae, which was a tease. It looked delicious and honestly sounded like a dream, after all, how could ""classic hot fudge sundae"" sound bad, but surprisingly it lacked any sugar or sweetness. Even though we devoured the sundae, we were surprised that the chocolate syrup and whipped cream were so bland. I'm chalking this up to an anomaly, so don't let the lack of sugar disused you from coming to the CSBC. A meal at the Clinton Street Baking Company is well worth it!",1,,1
17,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",135,110,275,5.0,8/20/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Monday afternoon and the wait was about 15 minutes or so. I wouldn't wait more then 30 minutes. Once we sat down our server gave us water and menus. We ordered the maple butter pancakes, chicken and waffles, hash brown, biscuit with jam and butter, and sugared bacon.The chicken on the waffle was FANTASTIC, it was perfectly crisped without being burnt. The maple butter was to die for. The pancakes with blueberries were to die for! The pancake was so fluffy and moist without being under or over cooked. The bacon was perfectly cooked and candied. The hash browns were great! The biscuit was good but we could have done without it. The coffees great and the watermelon lemonade was really good!Definitely worth trying! I know in the weekends the lines can be insanely long.",2,,
18,Eboni C.,"Atlanta, GA",21,66,228,4.0,8/18/2018,"This restaurant is located in lower Manhattan. It's a nicely sized restaurant but not very good for groups although they can be accommodating. My boyfriend and I came here around 9:30am on a Wednesday! The restaurant was already pretty full but we were seated immediately but that's the last time the staff were helpful. We waited 40 minutes for our order to be taken and another 30 to receive our food even though there were several tables that were helped even though they came after us. I assume they forgot about us. When we finally received our meal it was hot and delicious. I ordered the blueberry pancakes with bacon and my boyfriend ordered plain pancakes with a side of eggs. The blueberry compote was a little too much for my palate and I'd wished that I ordered the plain pancakes as well. A lot of people love the maple butter but I honestly thought a maple syrup would've tasted better. The butter had a nutty flavor that I wasn't expecting. The bacon was delicious and my partner said the eggs are some of the best eggs he's had in a long time. It's pretty expensive with a stack of pancakes being $16Overall the service was horrible but the food was tasty. The restaurant is always busy and the ""system is down"" so you need to bring cash to pay.",1,,3
19,Sameer M.,"Mississauga, Canada",3,25,165,5.0,10/21/2018,"First time in New York and friends recommended this restaurant for Sunday Brunch. While the wait was 1-1.5 hours, and the weather was a little chilly, we waited.The food was fantastic!!! The service was friendly and inviting...and there were patrons from LA and Australia that came to visit...gotta luv the Aussies..We had the Blueberry pancakes, fluffy, light and delicious. The sugar content felt light, which was a big plus.  You can eat these without the butter syrup.The chicken and waffles were amazing!! Boneless breast of chicken with butter syrup over a light and fluffy waffle...one of the best I have had.The last plate was the poached eggs, over smoked salmon (subbed out the maple bacon) on a biscuit.  Wow....wow. The hollandaise sauce had alot of flavour, the smoked salmon was fresh, and the biscuits were incredible.Honestly, well worth the wait...even for Canadians (Toronto) the wait was well worth it ...",1,,1
20,Omer M.,"Melville, NY",40,161,791,5.0,8/21/2018,Awesome breakfast place!I dined solo on a Sunday morning.  Got into line at 8:40am (place opens at 9) and there was already a line of about 30 ppl.  I was able to snag street parking at that time.  When the doors opened I was promptly seated at the counter.  Ten minutes after opening the place was packed to capacity.Started off with freshly squeezed orange juice - top notch!.  Based upon reading past reviews it appears that most people rave about the blueberry pancakes.  I was very tempted with many other items on the menu including the specials...however I gave in and ordered the pancakes.  Not a mistake AT ALL.If it's your first time to the restaurant order the blueberry pancakes.  Explore on subsequent visits but do make it a point to get the pancakes on the first visit.  I usually opt for an eggs/omelets at breakfast...not really a pancake-person unless it comes as a side.  These pancakes had a slight crispiness to them.  The blueberry topping was not overly sweet; the maple syrup was perfect.  It's so good that on future visits I won't even bother to try other items.Ordered a side of chicken sausage which was good but did not come anywhere close to the satisfaction from the pancakes.  Service was excellent.,1,,1
21,Connie T.,"New York, NY",273,118,288,4.0,8/2/2018,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday with three other people and had to wait about an hour and a half for a table. I did halfsies with one of my friends so I was able to try the chicken and waffles as well as the blueberry pancakes. The chicken and waffles was decent. I was expecting the pieces of fried chicken to be served with the bone inside but instead they were like chicken tenders. Even more disappointing, the chicken tenders were a bit dry.Luckily, I still had a half of the blueberry pancakes and it was perfect. It was very fluffy and moist inside. You could actually taste the blueberries. The warm maple butter that came with the dishes was delicious and amazing on both the waffle and the pancakes.",4,,2
22,Kanak K.,"Newport, Jersey City, NJ",13,2,9,5.0,11/4/2018,"Perfect place for lazy weekend brunch. I ordered two things (both vegetarian): Chocolate chunk Pancakes: Pancakes were soft and fluffy topped with chocolate chunks and served with a sweet sauce. I loved the texture and the sauce it was served with. A must try! Veggie Sandwich: Layers of sandwich had avocado, tomato, cheese, sprouts and mayo. It was tasty as well as healthy.

Definitely not a 'budget' breakfast place, but the food is excellent. I had a hankering for Japanese souffle pancakes, but when I couldn't find a place in Manhattan for it, decided to come to Clinton for a substitute. And their blueberry pancakes were delicious! Not as pillowy as a souffle pancake, but super fluffy, light and yummy. I didn't think I could finish it all, but... I did finish it all.We also tried the cheese grits and fried chicken. They were very savory and delicious as well. Topping off our filling and excellent breakfast were the mimosa and bellini.

He filled me in on the most popular breakfast and what they are known for...the blueberry pancakes with maple butter syrup! Boy did they satisfy!

The space is much brighter and larger than the old space which is still open but now serves as a to-go counter and bakery. Shortly after being seated, we ordered. My fiance got the huevos rancheros and I got the chocolate chunk pancakes. They were both great! The pancakes were filling and I could barely finish the entire stack.

29,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,7/17/2018,"This place is known for their brunch, particularly their pancakes. My friend and I came here on a Saturday afternoon at 1 PM and it was a 45 minute wait. They have red plastic benches outside so we were able to wait comfortably seated. The interior has nice natural lighting and is no frills, casual with wooden tables and red chairs. Don't forget: Cash only establishment! I was planning to order the chocolate chunk pancakes, but was too tempted by the one of the specials: Truffle egg with bacon and vegetables. I asked the waiter what he suggested. He made a great point to go for the special because they may not have that available again but I can always come back for the chocolate chunk pancakes. Along with the special, my friend and I decided to share the potato pancakes. The special had the fried egg with asparagus on top and the bacon with brussel sprouts, snap peas and other green veggies below it. There was a delightfully delicious truffle flavor throughout the entire dish. The egg was perfectly cooked with some green onion on top and tasty seasoning. I also loved the bits of thick cut, extremely crispy and flavorful bacon. It would've been nice to have more of that. The vegetables were also good - Quite fresh and sauteed well with lots of pepper and spices, but it was way too oily. While I really enjoyed some elements of the special, I don't know if it warranted the $17 price tag and may have been happier with the simpler, more tried and true choice of pancakes.Potato pancakes were served with sour cream and applesauce. There were only 3 of them and they cost $13, which I think is a little steep. I mean, for only $2 more I could have gotten pancakes. The potato pancakes were fried to very crunchy consistency which is the way I like it (though my friend didn't think they were good). They were extra crispy along the edges and the middle had more of a softness to it with yummy potato filling. The addition of sour cream and apple sauce enhanced the flavor and made it even better. I got to try a tiny bit of my friend's chicken and waffles. I thought they both tasted average, but the maple sauce that came with it was truly delectable - Thick, sweet and caramel-y! I also tried the yogurt + honey with granola and medley of fruit: Bananas, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple and cantelope. I really liked the wide selection of fruit that was included, but thought the yogurt itself was bland. The service was pleasant and unrushed, which lended itself well to the enjoyment of our time while there. I would definitely come back since I really want to get the chocolate chunk pancakes.",17,15,17

31,Jenna W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,28,43,5.0,10/29/2018,"This place was worth the wait (about an hour for a party of 2 around 10am for Saturday brunch). There is also an app you can download that shows where you are in line to be seated. The eating space was a bit crowded, and to get out of some seats you'd have to move your or another's table. We ordered the special of the Pear Waffle and the Salmon Scramble. The Pear Waffle special was amazing, however is very sweet and tastes more like eating dessert for breakfast (great for those like me who have a sweet tooth!) I will have to say that the caramel-like flavored sauce it came with was one of the best sweet sauces I've ever tasted, and this came close to the best waffle I've ever had. The salmon scramble had a very strong salmon flavor come through, but I recommend it to those who love salmon and savory brunch.",,,

There's a lot of whipped cream and the milk doesn't have a fake ice cream flavor.The Fried Chicken Sandwich is one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had in a long time. The chicken is cooked perfectly, it's tender while having crunchiness from being deep fried. The mayonnaise isn't overbearing and the pickled tomatoes add a unique, welcoming kick of sour flavors.",,,1
33,Heidi A.,"Mississauga, Canada",3,46,54,5.0,7/9/2018,"We loved this place so much we went twice on our trip and I will definitely come back here if I'm ever back in New York.Wait time:The first day (Friday) was about 45 minute wait at 10AM compared to no wait on the second day (Monday) at 12PM.Food:The blueberry pancakes was my favorite dish and already *know* I'm going to miss this considering I live in Toronto. The batter is amazing and is paired well with the maple butter that comes on the side. The blueberry topping however, got a bit overwhelming for my sweet tooth tolerance for me at the end. The second day we came here, I tried the chocolate pancakes, delicious but really decadent so I couldn't finish it. Chocolate lovers, this is for you. Could be shared by two people, it comes in a stack of three.I also shared the chicken & waffles with a friend. If you're feeling savory with a little bit of sweet, this is for you! The batter for the waffle is amazing and the chicken is crispy.Honorable mentions- my friend ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage and we all loved it.DrinksWe ordered the Con Leche-- IT'S HUGE.

Ordered the southern breakfast, biscuit with jam and butter. I opted for apple chicken sausage instead of bacon, and frankly wasn't crazy about it. But besides that- most insanely rich and delicious cheese grits, perfectly made fried green tomatoes, and crumbly delicious buttery biscuit with homemade strawb jam. Yas yas and yassss.

40,Jackeline F.,"Orlando, FL",44,94,194,4.0,7/15/2018,"LOVE! I discovered this gem via my friends IG. And I started planning and plotting on my next trip to NYC. First, it is NYC, so parking is a problem, I started praying for a spot the moment we stepped off the plane, lol. We went around the blocks a couple of times then found parking right in front! Second, the only payment accepted, CASH! And we did not know this, so for those of us who plastic dependent, bring cash. Third, be prepared to wait. This place is famous for a reason, the IG posts alone will make you drool and the wait is expected.  Fourth, we were seated by the window. A tight squeeze, real tight, the tables are only inches apart. When someone from the table next to us had to get up, we had to move a little and lean to the side. But alllllll of what I have mentioned, well worth it. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles, I ordered the blueberry pancakes. Goodness gracious! My husband orders the same thing where ever we go to breakfast & he said this was the best. The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Perfectly seasoned and cooked, no greasiness at all.The waffle the perfect amount of sweet & fluffy. My pancakes, those blueberries were like jewels that burst in my mouth. The pancake itself was fluffy, light and not too sweet. The maple butter syrup was a contrast in taste, a bit sweet and slight citrus, I can't explain, it was good!We will be back!

The maple butter sauce was definitely a highlight! I, not being a huge pancake fan (but not disliking them either), quite enjoyed them, though considering we had pigged out at 2 other food places beforehand, probably could have done with sharing 1 pancake between the 3 of us, instead of 1 pancake each haha.

What better way to start our day trip than some brunch. This restaurant definitely lived up to my expectations! I was really worried about having to wait forever but we (party of 2) were lucky to have gotten seated right away. The place was hustling and bustling at around 10am on a Friday morning. Even with the place being packed, our server was attentive and wonderful overall. I started off by ordering a Bellini. At $14 per drink, it was pricey but still very good! They accidentally gave my boyfriend a Bellini too, but it was not a problem, he gladly ended up drinking it too. I ordered their Blueberry pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs. My boyfriend ordered chicken & waffles with a side of hash browns. WOW!! My pancakes were the star of the show. The Blueberry topping was so so good as well as their warm maple syrup. The pancakes were very fluffy and light. I took several bites of my boyfriend's chicken & waffles. The waffle was also fluffy. The chicken was juicy and slightly crispy on the outside. We both agreed that all the food was great! This place is expensive for breakfast. Make sure to bring cash, it's the only form of payment that they accept!

The lines are long and the wait time can range anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. I do appreciate the fact that their menu is notextensive which allows them to perfect the few items that they have. I'm not a breakfast fan but I do enjoy brunch especially when I can have dinner in the morning. I just wish that CSBC offer more of a variety. He ordered the chicken and waffles and I initially ordered what I thought was a Shrimp Po'Boy. Our waitress confirmed our orders at which point she asked me what? I repeated a shrimp po'boy. His coffee and my passion fruit bellini came out. I didn't care for my tart drink so I called over another waitress to remedy the situation. I told her my drink was sour. She stated that it's passion fruit. Great, I did not ask her to reiterate what I ordered I just wanted something else. Nonetheless her response annoyed me. She changed it to a mimosa. Our food came out and that's when things took a turn for the worse. His chicken and waffles were perfectly executed. My ""shrimp po'boy"" was actually the ""shellfish catch of the day"". Confused by this I called our waitress over. She told me yeah we don't have shrimp po'boys and then pointed to a sign that read, ""filet or shellfish catch of the day"". I can't begin to explain how I felt once she said that. Quite frankly I wanted to folio but decided against it. Making a scene would have been pointless. I just sat there upset, annoyed, and betrayed. I didn't even want to taste my hunny's food because of this. Our waitress came by and asked if I wanted to change my order. I declined. I tried to suck it up and eat the ""seafood po'boy"". Unfortunately,  I could not. The catch of the day was inedible and was incredibly mushy. I ended up sending it back and requesting a replacement dish of the fried chicken sandwich. I requested chipotle mayo instead of the lemon pepper mayo. I also substituted the hand cut fries for sweet potato fries. This was much better but lacked seasoning as well. The chicken was fried perfectlyand the brioche bun was nicely toasted.",5,1,2

Was pleasantly surprised that they've expanded to a larger dining room since I came a number of years ago, and happy that at 9pm on Monday, as expected, there was no wait at all. We got the 2 dishes everyone says you should order: blueberry pancakes and buttermilk fried chicken dinner. Both were really great and I'm glad I had someone to split them with (the savory before sweets is key for me)! The chicken is on the oily side, but perfectly crispy when served. As part of the dinner you get wings, a leg and breast pieces, a small cup of coleslaw and 2 cornbread. Coleslaw was tasty but I found the cornbread to be a little dry for my taste (and it's savory, not sweet like the cornbread I typically enjoy). Pancakes are light and fluffy yet quite filling - and importantly, not too sweet even with the maple butter. I don't know if I'd endure the weekend waits for this, but coming on a weekday for dinner (if you're one of those individuals that can eat breakfast foods for other meals) was solid.",1,,2

Clinton Street has a selection of brunch goodies, including 2 types of southern breakfast options (mine include fried green tomatoes- YASSSSSS, baby!) and delicious Banana Foster French toast and fluffy blueberry pancakes.

Pancakes are the must and they are fluffy and buttery and delicious, but nothing stellar enough for me to wait 2 hours for. They also are just normal sized pancakes, I guess I was half expecting them to be the size of my head for how well known they are. The sugar coated bacon was delicious and highly recommend. I also got an omelette with cheese and caramelized onions, wasn't instagram pretty but actually pretty good. Did not like the hash browns, they were burnt and lacking flavor. Compared to some of the other reviews, I had really great service so that's a plus. Came on a Friday and only had about a 10 minute wait for 2 people.

The grits were so creamy and decadent -- not bland at all. The shrimp was a tad chewy but good flavor. Fried green tomatoes provided their perfect tang to cut through some of the fat, though i would've loved if there were more. I would get this again. They also provide complimentary biscuits to start which were great. They come out piping hot. Maple bourbon lemonade was awesome and more alcoholic than overly sweet.The only part lacking was service.

The waffles are amazing and the chicken was so good! So, get the chicken and waffles, the flavors won't disappoint.I had the southern breakfast and unfortunately I have had better fried green tomatoes. But the eggs were cooked perfectly and the sugar cured bacon was a real treat.  The grits came out cold and hard but the water replaced them.

We family-styled everything so I got to try a variety of their most popular items: 1. Spanish Scramble:  I usually actively avoid ordering scrambles since it seems to be just eggs+random leftovers combined together, but this was sooo good! Flavorful chorizo, loaded w/ cheese and veggies. Came with hashbrowns and toast on the side. I felt like I could eat the whole plate myself. 2. Fried Chicken and Waffles: Fried chicken was tender and flavorful, waffle was amazing, but missing a bit of the crispiness. All is forgiven once you drench everything in warm maple butter lol 3. Crispy Potato Pancakes (w/ smoked salmon and caviar): This dish is essentially two large hashbrowns each layered with a sheet of smoked salmon, sprinkled w/ chives. It comes w/ a spread of lemon infused sour creme (?) and caviar. This dish was good, but not mind-blowing. If I had to choose one dish to cut out, this would be it. 4. Blueberry Pancakes w/ warm maple butter: Really great pancakes! It's soft and not too sweet. I'm not a huge pancake fan, but these were yummy! 5. Seasonal Passion Fruit Waffle (passion fruit curd+fruit+whip cream): SOOO DECADENT, this is straight up dessert. The flavors are tangy, sweet, rich, and creamy. Can I buy a bottle of the passion fruit curd???! All the dishes here were top notch. It's pricey, but portions are big and if you come w/ a group, I recommend you share. I came w/ a group of 6 and we ordered 5 dishes and were all stuffed at the end of the meal. Cute, cozy ambiance w/ great lighting. I would definitely go back again.",,,

They didn't go overboard with cheese as some places tend to do. Everything people around us ordered looked good too. Will definitely be back to try other dishes!!

But I went on a Tuesday and just walked right in. The staff was friendly and quick to serve even though we walked right in that Tuesday it was still pretty full. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles was light crisp and fluffy the perfect compliment to the crispy juicy chicken that accompanied it. The chicken was well seasoned and with a nice crispy crust.Along with that a side of maple brown sugar cured bacon which was like meat candy that had me like a kid in a candy shop. It had a nice char with the sugars caramelizing over the salty bacon. One of my favorite things I ordered was one of the simplest biscuits with butter and jam. The biscuit was flaky and fluffy yet nice and buttery the jam it came with was amazing the perfect sweetness over the hot buttery biscuit. I could go back and just eat biscuits that's how good they were. Yeah the biscuits and bacon went so fast they didn't make the photo op.,6,1,3

So if you know you wanna eat here for breakfast or brunch, reserve a table in advance.Besides that, we did enjoy our food once we got in! To start our day on the right foot, we ordered ""Boozy Drinks"". I had the Market Bellini ($12) and the boyfriend had the Hard Blueberry Lemonade ($12). The lemonade drink tasted weak to him, but my drink tasted rather strong. I did enjoy it. Enough of the fruity, alcoholic beverage I was looking for with my meal. Boyfriend had the Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich ($12), he enjoyed his sandwich, though he couldn't pick that sucker up and eat it like one. To reduce the mess, he ate the sandwich with a knife and fork. He also thought the tomato jam would taste differently, but he wasn't complaining about it. Now I went the basic route. A waffle ($12) with a side order of scrambled eggs ($6). Best waffle I had in a very long time, of ever. Fluffy on the inside, nice crisp on the outside, truly worth the wait. The eggs were smooth and seasoned just enough to not overpower my waffle. Also! The syrup that came with the waffle had a butter taste to it and  creamy!They only take cash! Another warning.

They don't seat incomplete parties so make sure everyone gets there on time. I would say we waited about 20 minutes at 11am, which isn't bad for NYC.

The hostess tried to tell me that it was already 10 minutes and she gave our table away.Clearly this wasn't the case, and it wasn't. She was a stuck up jerk and after waiting for over an hour and a half she has the audacity to argue with me when clearly it shows I wasn't wrong.Poor poor customer service to have your hostess lie to customers face after waiting for an hour and a half. No apology, just made us wait long.Real jerks. Beware of this snobby hostess.",,1,
69,Marilu F.,"Hialeah, FL",457,678,3215,5.0,2/19/2018,"Believe the hype. These were the best pancakes I've ever had. I'm salivating just thinking about them.First thing's first - this is constantly time and time again recommended. I love brunch, kept seeing this recommended, was going to New York, so this easily went from being a want to a need. I read the reviews and planned or tried to anyway. Life's funny sometimes and it disrupts the order of stuff.I meant to go on Saturday but went on Sunday. Despite the rain, the place was packed. I say this honestly, go super early, as in before they open or use the NoWait app. I completely forgot about the app and ended up waiting around 30-40 minutes with my boyfriend.Once we were finally sat, we had our seats in front of the station where they make pancakes and drinks. We were attended by the lovely Olivia T., who took our orders. My boyfriend ordered orange juice and chicken and waffles, while I happily ordered a cappuccino and the blueberry pancakes I repeatedly saw in photos.I tried a bite of the chicken and waffles and they are the best I have ever had. In retrospect, I rarely, if ever, eat chicken and waffles, but the blueberry pancakes, on the other hand, were out of this world. Just biting into them made the entire wait we had worthwhile.Don't underestimate the food by the way. All the portions are humongous and just seeing the drinks at the bar, I can tell you that they definitely don't skimp out. If it weren't for the fact that we were on a tight schedule, this place would've definitely changed my mind. I kept seeing the mimosas and bellinis being filled to the top.Absolutely wonderful is how I would describe Clinton Street Baking Company, and from what Olivia T. told us when we asked her, it's usually pretty busy. I find it personally deserves it, and whenever I go back to NYC, this will be one of my spots.Hmm, a final note that is repetitive at this point in the reviews: CASH ONLY.",13,3,10

Updated review",Good grub. Just sucked because we waited 30minutes for our check. We asked the hostess since our waiter was MIA. She then avoided us and basically never came back. Didn't give us an update but you could tell there was some sort of mix up. People were panaicing. Then 20m later she came back and asked us what kind of card we gave.  We said no. We're still waiting to get our check... so they obviously lost or misplaced someone's card. When we finally got our check it was the wrong one. I gave up at that point.  good food but bad first impression Management never contacted us,,2,1
71,Tahini R.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,101,131,4.0,3/19/2018,"After reading amazing reviews and seeing some delicious brunch photos I knew I had to stop by and check out Clinton Street. Brunch is my favorite meal of the day, and I knew that this was the place I had to go to try some amazing brunch favorites of mine. My brother, his gf and I decided to check it out on a Monday, and despite it being a weekday, we had a wait of over 40 minutes, which was disappointing, but luckily there are tons of other great places near by to walk around and check out, so we decided to wait to try this food, we've been hearing so much about. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, my brother ordered the fried chicken and waffles, and his gf ordered the salmon Benedict. Overall the food was pretty good, but it didn't exceed my expectations. Honestly, I think that it's a bit of a tourist trap, hence why there were mostly foreigners waiting to eat there, probably after seeing all the instagram feed. I'm glad I checked it out, but honestly there are a ton of other brunch places that have better food in my opinion.",1,1,2
72,Lauren R.,"Brooklyn, NY",146,116,356,4.0,2/21/2018,"This restaurant is basically Lower East Side's pancake heaven. I first visited a few years ago and waited a LONG time for brunch.Now, I am much wiser and take advantage of Pancake Month in February. Every weekday in February Clinton Street offers a pancake special all day, including for dinner! Breakfast is my favorite meal so my friend and I visited for dinner last Monday. The menu featured Apple Pie Pancakes with caramelized local apples with cider glaze, cinnamon streusel topping and warm maple butter. Absolutely fantastic pancakes! I particularly liked the warm maple butter on the side. Clinton Street also gives complimentary warm biscuits and butter to start each meal which is a nice perk. The service was fine, nothing special and nothing worth complaining about.I highly recommend to visit on a weekday during the day or arrive right at 5:30pm when they re-open for dinner during Pancake Month. Their website and Instagram list the different pancake specials that will satisfy any sweet tooth.",6,,3

The food is still great and as busy as ever. I usually get the signature blueberry pancakes. Today I decided to try the walnut bananas foster brioche French toast, I was happy with my selection. I say give it a try. My husband stuck with the blueberry pancakes which by the way are huge & very good.

74,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,170,469,4.0,3/5/2018,"This place has a great reputation for food and an even bigger reputation for the line that usually forms outside. Luckily I came here on weekday afternoons, so there wasn't a line but still quite a few patrons inside. The first time I came for pancakes, and also some other dishes. Now I only come for pancakes (for the other food is good, just expensive and not quite worth the price). For a place that is usually crowded I'm not sure how there isn't more waitstaff available. We were seated quickly but no one came by for a long time, and someone who was seated after us was gotten to first. I'm not sure they have an actual order in how they serve people. Also our waters were not refilled once the entire time we were there. Eventually a busboy did come around to take our order, just that order of pancakes. It did take awhile but worth the wait (as long as you aren't to the point of hangry).The chocolate chip pancakes are fluffy and served warm. Tastes amazing. The best part is the warm maple syrup it comes with, the problem is I wish there was more than just the little side it comes with.  But at $15 for 3 pancakes I can't be frequenting this place all that often. But this will be my treat every once in awhile",2,1,1

The wild blueberries from main and the maple caramel ""sauce"". I'm taking one star off because of this place's popularity and how they can underestimate the time for customers. I have waited more than an hour for a weekend brunch. Tip: They serve their full menu all day long, like a diner. So its best to visit in the evening for pancakes for dinner :)",,,

Everything was so so so good.",1,,1
78,Daniel M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",86,488,695,3.0,7/12/2018,"Had 2 orders of the blueberry pancakes, 1 order of banana walnut pancakes, chicken sausage side order and the classic chicken and waffles. I will start by saying that thebesit for a Wednesday morning brunch 11am was not awful but it did take 30 minutes to wait for a table after we put our name down with the host. During that time we sat inside and watched people order and saw food fly by us. We were so hungry just from looking thay we could have placed our orders just by looking at the food. When we were seated our waitress was very friendly and courteous. We placed our orders and we had high expectations fornthe food based on the reviews and the hype from fellow yelpers. I must remind you that our table did not consume any alcohol and a breakfast for 4 was $100. Yeah and CASH ONLY PLEASE!I was very impressed with the high level of service from the entire staff including the server assistant. Everyone seemed to be working with each other very harmoniously.  Now let me tell you about the blueberry pancakes. The pancakes are good, they can be best described to be more like a cake based pancake. Yes they are fluffy but there is a heavy coating of butter on the pancake itself. The fruit topping was good but i did not like the funky brown syrup concoction that is served instead of traditional maple syrup. You get a stack of 4 pancakes which by any standard it is certainly a good size serving.  Can i honestly say that this is the best pancake i ever had?Probably not. The chicken sausage was a bit dry and warm at best. Could have done without it.  In contrast the banana pancakes were slightly better a bot more moist bit they too were served with the funky brown syrup thay resembles liquid peanut butter mostly because of the color.My wife seemed pretty happy with the chicken and waffles but in the overall, i cannot justify spending the money for breakfast. I.have to say the coffee was excellent very robust, aromatic.and intense on flavor. That is something i can appreciate as a true coffee lover.Finding parking was challenging even on a weekday. Honestly swrvice was top notch, price is expensive and the food is good but expensive.",2,1,1

The wait was over an hour but that app ""Nowait"" is great and keeps you informed! Don't forget this is CASH only which is very annoying but just come prepared!

Came with a party of 4 and only waited 15 minutes to get seated, not too shabby at all!We did family style and ordered the Banana Nut Pancakes, Softshell Crab Eggs Benedict, Salmon Eggs Benedict, and a Breakfast Plate with a Biscuit, Eggs, and Bacon. Overall I found the food to be pretty mediocre and some of the dishes were a bit too salty for my liking. The Salmon Eggs Benedict was my favorite dish out of everything that we ordered but unfortunately the eggs were also overcooked and not runny at all! The Softshell Crab Eggs Benedict was too salty and too overwhelming to finish. And the Banana Nut Pancakes was decent but definitely got too sweet after taking a few bites. It's also a bit inconvenient that this place is cash only.",3,2,3
81,David Y.,"Herndon, VA",143,11,10,4.0,7/23/2018,"On weekends the place opens at 9 for brunch. i arrived at around 9:04 and was surprised to see that the place was already pretty packed.I got the spanish scramble which came with a scramble of eggs, chorizo, and veggies, a hashbrown, and sourdough toast. The chorizo they had was very good with nice flavor and all the other items in the scramble were cooked well and complemented each other nicely. The bread and toast were pretty standard though I was slightly dissappointed with the hashbrowns. They didn't taste bad or anything but I personally would have preferred a flatter shape. It's cooked in the shape of a hemishphere which looks nice presentation wise but that skews the ratio of the fried crispy parts of the hashbrown to the soft insides. However that is just personal preference on my part.One thing to note is that for brunch they are cash only. Something I wasn't made aware of until the bill came and wish I had been told earlier.But overall I had a pleasant experience here and would come again to try their other dishes as well as their dinner menu.",1,,1
82,Liselle L.,"New York, NY",292,135,262,3.0,7/11/2018,"I've been trying to find a great brunch spot so I thought why not try out Clinton Street Baking Company? Well when I came in on a Tuesday at 12:00 PM, the place was PACKED. Another couple came in, and the hostess escorted them to their table. I was waiting on a friend, so my party was incomplete at the moment. However, the hostess didn't even acknowledge my presence, leaving me standing in the back corner. Then did I realize that if your party is incomplete, you have to wait outside - even when there were 5 chairs by the bathroom. I waited outside for about 10 minutes and then when my friend was here, then we were acknowledged and escorted to our table.When seated, service was quick, and I am sure they were happy to answer any questions we had. I ended up ordering a strawberry and banana waffle with banana-flavored bavarian cream - seems like a safe choice for somewhere I haven't eaten. When my strawberry and banana waffle came, I was shocked to see a heaping pile of bavarian cream, while only receiving 5 measly pieces of strawberry and banana combined. Back in Florida, any time I would order a waffle with fruit, the whole waffle would be covered with fruit! When I ate the waffle, it tasted somewhat doughy, which was okay at first, but as I ate more of it, I found myself to be forcing myself to finish it. The accommodating syrup was more like a butterscotch syrup - which tasted fine on its own but mixed with the waffle was a different story. I asked for more syrup, but then the server gave me another butterscotch syrup. I guess Clinton Street Baking Company doesn't have any maple syrup? That seems strange for a breakfast/brunch restaurant. Later on, something I noticed was that about 3 or 4 servers were chatting in the corner of the kitchen. I couldn't tell if they were just bored, overstaffed, or great at time management because they could afford to stand in the corner and chill. Overall somewhat of a dull experience that left me disappointed. If I do come back here, I would order something different. However, I don't really see myself coming back here. If you do come here, make sure to bring cash, as this place is CASH ONLY.",1,3,1

I didn't feel like having dinner for dinner, so the most logical thing I could think of was to have breakfast instead! No wait time. Yaaaaassss. Chomped:1. Blueberry Pancakes - these pancakes were fluffy af. They probably put cake flour in the mix, because the texture was so light and airy. Comes with a side of maple butter which complements the blueberry compote; both items which were surprisingly not overly sweet (a good thing!). 2. Buttermilk Fried Chicken - this is fried chicken done right. Popeyes, KFC, Los Pollos Hermanos and all them other fried chicken establishments should take some good hard mental food notes. The skin was crunchy, the meat was juicy, and the seasoning wasn't salty.Both portions were generous and left me stuffed.

By the time we left, however, it was completely packed with a significant wait. Definitely get here early, since they do not take reservations. (Also note that they are cash only.)My sister got a specialty waffle with passion fruit, which was great, while I stuck with the chicken and waffles, which was also excellent. They clearly actually cook their chicken in house (as it should be!). The highlight of our visit, however, were the breakfast cocktails. We tried the hot buttered rum and the Mexico hot coffee and both were sublime - right and warm and well-crafted. I would definitely go hack again if I was in the area and didn't mind a bit of an early morning wait.",1,,1

Note that this place is CASH ONLY so drop by an ATM beforehand if needed.  We ordered the wild Maine blueberry pancakes ($15), the eggs benedict ($18), and the chicken and waffles ($19). We also got two sides of the sugar cured bacon ($6 each). I felt like the majority of what we ordered was good, but not out of this world. It was pretty standard brunch food. I enjoyed it and would order it again, but have definitely had more unique brunches in the past. I will say that their maple butter is fluffy and delicious. But, the stand out item for me was the bacon. IT WAS SO GOOD. That was actually the main reason we visited this place, and it most definitely did not disappoint. It was so sweet and salty and good! So definitely give it a try. And for $6 you get a pretty hefty plate of bacon. If I were rating this place on the bacon alone I would give it a 5/5, but alas everything else, while tasty, wasn't anything super unique which is what warrants the 3/5 rating. All in all, come for the bacon. It will change your life.",,,

I made a reservation for Saturday dinner, knowing that they still serve the famous blueberry pancakes in the evening. They only take dinner reservations (5:30pm to closing), but turns out my reservation was not necessary since there were several unoccupied tables. The complimentary biscuits were such a wonderful start to our meal. They were warm and buttery - can't imagine putting any more butter on them. I think they should provide jam packets with the biscuits instead of butter, but that's just a personal opinion. Food did not take too long to come out. I kept eying my blueberry pancakes from a distance as our waitress carried them out because I was so excited to eat them. After some thorough nommage, I can say these pancakes were the best I've had in my entire life. The three big pancakes were crisp on the edges and fluffy in the middle. The blueberries tasted so fresh! I did not even feel the need to put any maple butter on because there were plenty of blueberries to provide the sweetness. Our waitress was nice and took some good pictures of my friend and I from different angles. Although the service was not as phenomenal as the pancakes, I have no complaints.

I had the Sugar Bacon Burger with sweet potato fries, and we shared an order of the Blueberry Pancake that came with their divine maple butter. The burger was pretty basic, but the sugar bacon was extraordinary, thick-cut and beautifully caramelized. The pancakes were fluffy because of whipped egg whites folded into the batter, but surprisingly bland. They really needed the butter syrup to heighten their taste. Use it wisely because extra butter will cost you, and then the blandness of the pancake starts to peek through.Overall a novelty to try once, and the LES lends a lot to explore afterwards, but I probably won't visit them again due to brunch/dinner lines and quality factor.",5,1,2

They truly are the best pancakes that I've ever had because I loved the blueberry topping as well as the buttery maple syrup that they have on the side (next time more syrup please!!). When I went by myself, I had no wait. The other time we went at about 9AM and had a 35 minute wait, which I did not think was too terrible considering it was a Saturday morning. If you happen to be on the lower east side, please eat here and order pancakes. You won't be disappointed! I however will say that for the amount of food you get, it is a bit pricey. Maybe it's because I'm used to the large generous portions of brunches down in LA, but I didn't think they were nearly as generous as the prices reflected.

Food: Both dishes came pretty quick and were both served with maple syrup! Fried chicken with maple syrup was a weird combination for me but it worked and tasted great! Although I would still rather prefer it with the Tabasco/red sauce they offer! What I love about the waffles was how surprisingly easy it was for me to knife through it! The taste of both the chicken breast with waffles was so flavorful and worked so well together! 5/5: I just found my favorite brunch dish here! The Fried Chicken Waffles were so good, it made the Blueberry pancakes look bad! Usually, I prefer sweet dishes but, to be honest, the pancakes were nothing special for the price! It does have a very buttery, pan-fried taste to it though. What stood out was the maple syrup which complemented well with the pancakes! 4/5!Interior: The overall location felt like a diner. It was packed but not too packed on a Wednesday afternoon. I really enjoyed the lighting given off from the big windows! Service: They were really attentive. A little bit too much to my liking.

Some of the best hash browns I've had in a while, which is saying a lot because I'm never impressed by hash browns. Glad I made the trip to come here so I wouldn't have FOMO for the rest of my life, but it didn't win me over enough to wait for 40 minutes at 10am/get cash out again.

(...after a 1.5 hour wait, obviously) They are present on the NoWait app, which allows you to virtually get in line as long as you're within a 1 mile radius of the premises. Unfortunately, it said Clinton had a ""special event"" the day I went and wouldn't let me reserve a spot. Didn't notice anything special event related when I got to the restaurant to put my name down though. My friend and I ordered blueberry pancakes and the southern breakfast. The pancakes are as good as everyone says they are--light and fluffy. The maple butter it came with was AMAZING. I heard multiple comments around me about how people wanted to drink it with a straw, and I would totally agree with that sentiment if I wasn't worried about the caloric intake. The blueberries were also flavorful without being overwhelmingly sweet!I liked the southern breakfast as well. It came with two eggs (I got them over easy), cheese grits, and sugar cured bacon. The portions seemed slightly disproportionate. The amount of bacon given seemed excessive for the amount of grits I got (I know, you can never have too much bacon, what is this blasphemy). In this case, I actually really liked the bacon but if you eat too many in a row, it gets a little sweet. I personally liked ""chasing"" it with a spoonful of grits or eggs, but I ran out with around a few chunks of bacon to spare. With that said, I did greatly enjoy all the components regardless. The fried green tomatoes were amazing and were gone almost immediately.Overall, it was definitely worth the experience! I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to wait that long again, but if I was in the area and the wait time was shorter, I would definitely swing by. Cash only.",5,1,1

Although it can get a little busy on certain days and times, the food definitely makes it worth the wait. Hats off to Clinton Street for being consistent",1,,
99,Krizia C.,"Manhattan, NY",318,311,190,3.0,2/18/2018,"Definitely a lot of hype around this spot, but truth be told I think it's overhyped. Is the food good l, absolutely. Best service, ambience, experience for nyc brunch? Definitely not. Let's start with the must knows: this is a cash only no reservation type of spot. There's no room to wait, sit at bar or even chat. You have to be outside on the street and if it's a cold winter day or hot as hell summer day it's not fun. The way you get a reservation is you stuff your self through the door to give  your number to the  hostess. Then you get a text and a crazy wait time estimate. For a party of 2 on a Sunday morning before 9:15 am it was 45 min wait time. We heard if you get there before 9 am there's a huge wait outside before it opens. Anyways once we were seated it's not a spot to sit review the menu and grab a drink and chat. The server comes up to you asks if you want coffee and to order... I guess they figure you're waiting so long you already know what you want to eat. As far as food, I think the pancakes or the French toast are a must!! The pancakes I think are the best I have had. They are perfectly cooked with a bit of crispy top, but still fluffy. The warm maple syrup and compote are to die for! This is the reason you come here. Everything else I honestly could say is good, but you can get at any diner. We got the classic country breakfast served with a massive biscuit. It's good, not amazing to wait in line for an hour.All in all I'm happy I tried the best damn pancakes ever. Would I wait again? No. I'll just do take out.",1,,

Some points I don't think other reviews mention:- Download the Nowait app as soon as you're within a mile, and put your name down. My wait was barely twenty minutes on a Sunday morning. It's very very easy and makes coming here a breeze. The host is busy, but she looks out for everyone. - Clinton St Omelette with spinach and mushrooms was awesome. The potatoes are great, too. Perfectly soft, but not mushy at all. - blueberry pancakes are among the best pancakes I've ever had. The maple syrup house sauce it comes with is unlike any other sauce. - coffee was not bitter, but delicious. All sorts of milk available, including almond. Tried the mimosa with the blackberry puree and thought it was delicious as well. - great for families and dates. I wouldn't come here with a group, unless you have a reservation.To conclude, this place brunches, and it brunches well.",7,6,5
102,Wei Teresa C.,"New York, NY",82,107,189,4.0,3/14/2018,"SO SO GOOD. I've been talking this place up to all my friends since I've been. I'm a big fan of breakfast foods, especially of the pancake kind, so I'm so glad a friend brought me here. We came on a Saturday night around 10 pm and the place was quiet with mood lighting and no line. The restaurant maybe had four or five tables full. My favorite part: they still served pancakes!!I couldn't decide between the blueberry or chocolate pancakes so the waitress recommended us adding chocolate to the blueberry ones. Great choice! The pancakes were soft and fluffy, raised, and just so good. Highly recommend. But my favorite part is the Boozy Mexican Coffee shake, which is chocolate and coffee ice cream, khalua, tequila, and cinnamon powder. These are all my favorite ingredients in one. It was perfect.This is a great place to take a date, and I highly recommend coming at night when the dining experience is more intimate and peaceful. There's so much on the menu I want to try, but I definitely don't want to be waiting forever for a table.The only complaint I have is that the waitress didn't tell us it would cost extra to add chocolate to the blueberry pancakes. I had originally thought that it would be a half/half topping. I wouldn't have had a problem paying it, I just don't to be surprised when I get the bill. I think it was an extra $3-4 for the chocolate topping.",,,
103,Daniel C.,"Honolulu, HI",697,659,1327,4.0,12/16/2017,"A place with so many positive reviews is going to be busy right? Well good thing we accounted for it before coming here. We allowed ample wait time and went during off hours to avoid long wait times. Our plan worked and we only had a relatively short wait. We were seated by the window which was nice. Our server was prompt at getting us menus and taking our drink orders when we sat. She was patient with us as we looked through the menu to make our selection. With how busy this place is, above average customer service.Mink ordered the Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter and I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles with a Clinton St. Bloody Mary to wash it down. Our drinks didn't take long to arrive. While we waited for our food, the place filled up fast and a line formed to dine here. Talk about good timing right? Our server got our order into the kitchen before the rush so we got our food quickly. The portions were HUGE! Mink's pancakes were very fluffy. My chicken was very moist and tasty. The waffle was soft and just paired perfectly with the chicken. There was also this red and greed hot sauce that I added to every bite of my meal. This place didn't disappoint and I see why they are so highly rated.",37,19,27
104,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,5.0,1/29/2018,"TLDR: the best fried chicken and waffles I've ever had; use the NoWait app to minimize wait time; cash only; friendly and attentive staff; large portionsLive close by to Clinton Street Baking Company and have always wanted to try it, but was discouraged by the long wait times. However, one of my friends mentioned that it was recently added to the NoWait app (where you can virtually put yourself in line if you are close enough to the restaurant), so decided to give this place a try on a late Sunday morning with my two roommates.We put our names down on the app around 10:45am and then headed over to the restaurant about 45 minutes later. Although the app said our wait time was up and to report to the hostess, we still had to wait an additional 30 minutes (unsure if this was due to the app or the restaurant). This was slightly disappointing, but better than the usual wait time.The restaurant was bustling with all tables and bar stools filled. Bright light was shining through the large windows and the place had a ""diner"" feel to it with wooden tables, regular and booth seating, a stainless steel counter at the bar, and chalkboards listing daily specials.While everything on the menu looked great, I knew that I had to try the fried chicken and waffles. My roommates opted for the crispy potato pancakes with house smoked salmon and wild maine blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter. Everything came out pretty quickly and was absolutely delicious. I had a bite of each of my roommates' entrees in addition to eating half of mine (had to take the other half to go since I was so full).While I'm not a fan of smoked salmon for breakfast, the crispy potato pancake was still delicious and served hot with the perfect amount of crunch. The blueberry pancakes were also great--sweet, fluffy, and decadent with the blueberry topping, powdered sugar, and amazing maple butter. The fried chicken and waffles were hands down the best dish out of the three and the best I've ever had. While other restaurants typically serve fried chicken on the bone, the fried chicken here was boneless, flavorful, and covered in a delicious glaze. Adding the warm maple butter and fluffy waffle completed the dish.I ate my leftovers the next day at work and all of my coworkers were commenting on how delicious it smelled. Head over to this place for the fried chicken and waffles and you won't regret it.",1,,1
105,Katy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",711,60,66,4.0,10/1/2018,"We came for weekend brunch and waited in line for 90 minutes, so by the end I was starving!The Blueberry pancakes were DELICIOUS, you won't regret ordering them. They're super fluffy and the blueberry compote on top provides just the right amount of acidity. I got the chicken & waffles which were okay, the chicken was kind of dry but the waffles were good. The best part is the maple caramel sauce.",,,

108,Oscar P.,"Manhattan, NY",137,4,0,1.0,9/7/2018,"This place could easily have been a 4 Star experience since the food was great,  but the customer service by the wait staff is completely unacceptable. We were seated by the hostess within ten minutes of arrival, which is a reasonable time. The issue arose when it took about twenty minutes for anyone to take our order, even though people seated after us had their orders taken before us. After our orders were taken, more people were seated and their food came out before us. After another twenty minute wait, I had to let the hostess know that the table to in front and behind us were seated after us but were already served and we were still waiting. Throughout the duration of sitting and waiting, the waitress never followed up with us on the status of our food, and seemed more concerned with serving her other tables. After my discussion with the hostess, the hostess went to check on the status of our food. Immediately, the waitress, Santa D, came out and essentially blamed us for ordering chicken and waffles and french toast, claiming that our orders were more difficult to prepare and had a longer wait. While this might have been the case (I am aware frying chicken is a significantly longer process than making a pancake), the accusatory tone was uncalled for, especially when it was forty minutes from being seated to being served. Added to the fact that perceptually, other people were being served before us.  I'm curious to know hownlong my wait would have been if I had not followed up with the hostess. To be clear, the hostess' job is to seat people, which she did in a reasonable time. The issue was with the waitress, whom did not appear to have an ounce of customer service skills. I hope you are able to remediate this employee, as the whole experience would be more appealing if they had some training in how to deal with customer grievances.",2,1,
109,Becca H.,"Hartford, CT",197,142,164,4.0,2/3/2018,"I've been wanting to try this brunch spot, and finally made a point of getting here on a Saturday morning. Luckily we planned for the long wait: 90 minutes for a table for two. So I'd definitely recommend getting there to put your name down, and plan something to do while you wait. Once you manage to get seated and order, the food comes out pretty quickly. Which is very necessary because after such a long wait we were famished.I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. Such a good decision! It came with whipped sour cream, guac, salsa, beans, and two sunny side up eggs on a tortilla. Filling and satisfying. We also shared a plate of the Blueberry Pancakes for the table. I think you definitely need to try the pancakes if it's your first time here. They are so buttery and fluffy! Great brunch and a must try, but not sure how soon I'll return. There are so many other great spots I need to try.",1,,

Well, my bad that I didn't look at the menu to see this was a full fledged restaurant, instead of a quick dessert place. While we got seated quickly, my dessert took a long time to arrive.

111,Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",205,509,2651,2.0,1/4/2018,"This place was packed on a normal workday morning. It was about 30 minutes wait time. Space was very tight. Someone almost knocked down my silverware with her jacket without apologizing. Maybe it would be better to visit here in the warmer weather seasons. The service was average. It took a long time for the food to be served, at least 40 minutes. For a highly rated and super busy restaurant, I would expect less or no mistakes from the wait staff. However, I asked for the blueberry sauce on the side of the pancakes when the food came out, the sauce was on top. The wait staff did apologize after and I got a new plate of pancakes with sauce on the side. The first table to the left of ours had to wait for a long time to get their changes. Oh right, this place was cash only, which was a huge drawback. If the guy didn't ask for it, they might never get it back. I got the most famous blueberry pancakes. It was pretty fluffy, sweet and not overwhelmed with baking soda. I still think the pancakes from Tops Diner in New Jersey is the best pancakes that I have ever had. I was glad for asking to have blueberry sauce on the side. The sauce was too sweet. The warm maple butter was definitely a huge plus for the pancakes. It was warm, sweet (yes, it was very sweet and I could only have a little bit) and flavorful.My husband had chicken & waffles. The chicken was well seasoned and crispy but waffles were pretty dry and plain.",2,,
112,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",379,78,1706,5.0,12/7/2017,"Came here on a late Sunday morning. Generally, I always see a crazy long line here so I was happy to see that I lucked out and we only had a quick 20 minute wait. It must have been a weird gap in between crazy wait times because soon after we were seated the line started building again. (Yay for luck!)The first time I ever came here was for brunch in 2015 with a bunch of friends as we were planning the bridal shower and bachelorette for another friend. It was in an older restaurant. I think since then, they renovated the place and made it larger because I didn't remember it being located on a corner before. It was much more spacious and the large windows allowed a lot of light to come in. I had the Southern Breakfast with two fried eggs, sugar cured bacon, cheese grits, fried green tomatoes... I LOVE fried green tomatoes and these were done perfectly crunchy. The cheese grits were cheesy but not overwhelmingly so and the bacon was thick and felt filling. I also had the watermelon lemonade which was light and refreshing. Despite how packed the restaurant became soon after our order was taken, I still felt like the staff was really good at being attentive and making sure that we got the extra ketchup and hot sauce we asked for. All in all, a good place to brunch if you don't mind the wait times.",5,3,3

Updated review","Since writing this review, I've finally gotten the chance to dine at the main restaurant, and one secret I've discovered is to go for dinner! That's right, though this place is a madhouse for weekend brunch, it's actually very chill for dinner, and they still offer their famous blueberry pancakes.I'm still partial to stopping by the bakery annex next door over waiting for a table if it's in the morning. My all-time favorite is their triple berry scone, though the chocolate chip and the goat cheese scones are also excellent. In my opinion, their scones far surpass their muffins. Thought those two new nuggets of info were worth an update. Enjoy!",11,1,7
114,Zach W.,"Baltimore, MD",40,162,251,5.0,12/9/2017,"Even though it was hard to find this place (how are you supposed to know what street it's on?!), it was well worth the adventure. The first thing you'll notice is that there's a line, which means that there's some combination of great food and insufficient seating, which is an excellent start. When we went they gave us some sample pancakes, and honestly it was worth the trip just for that. You know how pancakes are fluffy and light and sweet and delicious and make you consider how infrequently you eat pancakes and how maybe you should eat them more? These guys definitely made me reconsider my dietary habits, which is the best compliment you can give a restaurant I think. Eventually we got seated, and since they're famous for pancakes and I had just had my world changed, I ordered the eggs Benedict. My dining buddy got the pancakes, because she's sane, and she got the blueberry version, because she's healthy, and they came with maple butter, because screw that, you're having pancakes, not salad. They were glorious. Buttery, fluffy, sweet, I almost cried when they were gone, etc. You know, the usual. The eggs Benedict were also probably the best in the city, so I guess I didn't mess up too badly in my portion of the shared meal. It came with salmon and the egg was great, and it was an overall awesome dish. But yea, pancakes are the move for sure if you don't get to split two meals. Definitely worth a visit!",2,3,2
115,Faith C.,"Orlando, FL",37,14,43,5.0,7/2/2018,"Let me just start off by saying that Clinton bakery has the BEST pancakes in the WORLD! The texture of the pancakes are consistent throughout! I had the chocolate chunk pancakes. The chocolate chips are not only on top but inside the pancake batter as well. My uncle had his favorite, The blueberry pancakes. He said they were DELICIOUS! Appetizers are a good size. We had Potato skins with Buffalo hot wings! If you miss out going in the morning, don't ever worry, they have Breakfast for dinner!!! The most amazing thing ever!",,,1
116,Zhou W.,"Washington, DC",98,81,155,4.0,2/18/2018,"PANCAKES ARE BOMB. these pancakes are pillows of flour and butter. I recommend the blueberry! It also comes with a side of maple pecan butter that is somehow still good to put on top of an already good and balanced pancake. Other highlights: smoked salmon scramble was a good balance of creamy, savory, and fluffy eggs, the Spanish scramble comes with fantastic chorizo that has a perfect smoky flavor, and the hue is rancheros were also good. However, it's clear that the sweeter dishes are better. The banana French toast was a perfect combination of brioche, cinnamon, and almost caramelized bananas. Service is ok, but come here for the food. It's a nice place to hang out with friends. Also tip: if you have a party bigger than 4, open the no wait app at 10am if you want to place yourself in line. They are ridiculously busy, and the app will only allow you to reserve for a party of 4; just write in your actual party number in the notes. They will not reserve parties over the phone. Knocked a star off for this because i felt like I had to jump 5 hoops to get here.",,,

Classics done in a classier trendier way and so so good.I've gone several times and i will be back for sure (as I'm trying to eat my way through the menu). Their chicken and waffles, blueberry pancakes and banana walnut pancakes are my favorites!Be prepared to wait a little before being seated they are usually very packed and you usually have to try and kill 30 min- but it's worth it!! Also it's cash only which isn't great but just go prepared. Prices are pretty good because the quality and portions are great.I went most recently for pancakes month (every February)- it's the most amazing time of year- every couple days the pancake recipe is something new and interesting so hurry up and try it out before you have to wait till next year.The flavor o had was blackberry with blackberry sauce- so amazing I'm drooling thinking about it!!!!",,,

119,Tam N.,"San Jose, CA",515,304,760,2.0,12/4/2017,"For me to give a 2 star rating, it means I regret going there. As a NY tourist, I was told that the blueberry pancakes here were super good. I got there and was seated immediately at the counter since I was a party of 1. Parties of 2+ were looking at a 1.5 hour wait though.The waitress at the bar gave me a menu and took my order which was fine. But the wait for the pancakes after that was a whomping 45 minutes. I could see the guy making the pancakes too, and was left wondering which one would be mine. When I was finally served the pancakes, they were indeed good. But some of it was undercooked.. also, at $15 for 3 pancakes.. no sides.. that is pretty steep.Things to note:Cash ONLY. This was a bummer since I didn't realize this was the case... and I didn't realize until 30 minutes into my waiting.. They really should make it more clear on their menus that it's cash only. the waitress told me there was an ATM across the street but I chose to walk the 10 minutes to Whole Foods (to make a purchase and get cash back) and 10 minutes back instead of paying for the ATM fees.. because after the ATM fees, my breakfast of just 3 pancakes would have cost me $28 after tax and tip..heck no, I'll walk the 20 minutes. All in all, long wait after ordering, undercooked pancakes, and overpriced food, I left wanting more. This was not worth my time or stomach space tbh.",4,,

I read previous reviews of how packed this place could get so I planned on arriving close to opening time, despite it being a Monday. When I got there around 930, the place was already packed with people already waiting. My group of 6 was quoted a time of 20 min, which was not awful at all. I gave my number to the hostess and she said they'd text me when my table was next to be cleared so my party had ample time to be there. They won't sit you without a complete party so plan ahead!

Two of us ordered their drinks before I received my text saying my table was ready! 10 min wait yasssOur orders: - regular Benedict and a side of fruit - salmon Benedict with a side of hash browns- chorizo scramble with a side of fried chicken- buttermilk biscuit sandwich- southern breakfast- country breakfast- stack of blueberry pancakes for the tableOur eyes may have been bigger than our stomachs once we saw how much food we actually ordered lol. But everyone was more than satisfied with their order! My regular Benedict was so flavorful and the eggs were poached perfectly. I tried a bite of the buttermilk biscuit and it was buttery and flaky. The fried chicken had a great coating on it and it was amazing. If I'm every back in town, I'm ordering the chicken and waffles lol. The pancakes were so fluffy but very filling! I could only eat a couple bites. Eat it with the warm maple butter that is served alongside! They're cash only so bring tons because you're gonna want everything.

I tend to not bring expectation when I go into a place, unless I've eaten there myself.In this case, I was well warranted to not have too many expectations. The food was just subpar. it had very little flavor. It wasn't different from any other place I can eat or rather from anything simple I can make at home. When you have that happen to your food, why is anyone coming here over anywhere else?It was just, ok. Prices didn't feel appropriate, but that's because the food wasn't stellar. That may just be a nitpick. Try it for yourself, I could have been in on a bad day. I'll give it another try and update this review. But for now, meh.",,,

But service was still very friendly and quick due to the server assistants.  Based on the menu offerings there is not a lot indicating they are a baking company.  I would have liked to see more bakery options included with their breakfast entrees.  I got the country breakfast substitute bacon.  I REALLY enjoyed the biscuit included with this meal. It came with what seemed like a homemade raspberry jam, and was really delicious,  Everything else was pretty standard, eggs, hash browns, and bacon were all cooked well and good.  The biscuit and jam were the star though. They did have a neighboring shop which displayed all of their baked goods, but again would have liked to see more of those options on the menu included with the entrees.   We did wait a little longer for our bill, but we were able to ask a server assistant and got it right away.  Highly recommend for anyone in the area, and would hope to make it back on my next trip to NYC.",,,

I love that it is open to late afternoon and still serves delicious breakfast items. There are so many things that caught my attention but I went ahead and ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and the chicken and waffles. The pancakes, which I think they're known for, was super fluffy and delicious. However the best part was definitely their syrup. I would get the blueberry pancakes next time just so I didn't over do it with the chocolate and the syrup all mixed together. Pancakes aside, the chicken and waffles were definitely the highlight of my meal. The waffles were decent but the chicken was the game changer. It was crispy and sweet and all the things you would imagine chicken and waffles to taste like. The only downside about this place is it is cash only.

127,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,702,1560,5.0,11/17/2017,"There are perks to my inability to sleep in on weekends. Like, for example, waking up at 8:30 am on a Saturday and realizing you still have time to make it to Clinton Street Baking Company before it opens at 9.We arrived just a few minutes before 9, and were disheartened to see a line stretching around the corner. Fortunately, we got seated in the first round of people they let in.The menu is large, with classic offerings with gourmet country ingredients; imagine buttermilk biscuit egg sandwiches with homemade tomato jam, or wild Maine blueberry pancakes. A big focus on where the food is sourced from. Some nice-sounding specials and drinks. Boyfriend ordered the Southern Breakfast ($14), and I went for the Brioche French Toast ($14), minus the pecans. (The real reason for my relationship is so that I can always have access to one savory and one sweet brunch dish.)The french toast was big, dense, and delicious. Loved the carmelized bananas on it. It's a sugar bomb, obviously; I felt pretty gross after eating half of it. Caramel sauce on the side rather than syrup probably didn't help.Every part of the Southern Breakfast was well-rendered. Eggs were poached right, fried green tomatoes were crispy and hit the spot, grits were solid. The bacon was the best part by far.Service is very professional. It's not lightning quick to get your food since there are a ton of people here, but the kitchen and staff work hard. We ordered around ten minutes after getting in, and received our food about thirty minutes later. Once we finished eating, I think it took us about ten to get out. We must have been back on the street by 10, which is pretty fast when you think about it.Overall, had a lovely time here. Prices are reasonable once you factor in how big the portions are. Ingredients are quality and they are competently handled. This isn't the healthiest breakfast you'll ever have, but it is unusually good.

129,Kern C.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,216,37,3.0,1/4/2018,"There were afew positive elements from this restaurant and a couple not so positive . The positives are that this restaurant has great workers . It's evident by their hustle and their politeness. Another positive was the fact that they give great tasting biscuits before your meal and I was able to get some for the road as well . They comped my disgusting salmon entree . Their pancakes which I saw a lot of people getting smelled amazing and looked delish .The chicken wings were reallyyyy good .The negatives : The salmon entree was likely the worst salmon I have ever eaten . Before I could even get a bite in I was overwhelmed with a strong disgustingly fishy scent sorta like the scent you get when you are in the Whole Foods fish section. I initially overlooked it because of the crispy skin it had and i squeezed the accompanying lemon on it to cut the scent . That helped 0 percent . The fish was not cooked all the way through unsurprisingly and I was only able to get two bites in . Fortunately , I was able to sample my partner's chicken and waffles entree which was better but not stellar for me to bump them to a 4 star rating . The wait times for everything is ridiculous . For the wings , it took about 30 minutes to arrive and just as long for the entrees . It was not swarmed pack which is worrying if it eventually were to be . You can get unlimited biscuits but man can't live on biscuits alone . Overall this place is a solid 3 stars . Refrain from their salmon entree and eat breakfast foods and you should be A-ok .",1,,
130,Steve X.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,2.0,10/13/2018,"Got seated pretty quickly, but took a very long time for a server to take our drink order and even longer - 15-20 minutes - for the drinks to arrive. When they did arrive, the mixed drink was correct, but the bottle of wine was not correct - she'd brought a more expensive bottle. When we were finally able to flag her down and explain, it was clear that she didn't believe us (yes, that's what we do - order one bottle of wine and then take satisfaction in telling the server that they've brought the wrong one, LOL).Once that was all sorted out, we ordered food. And waited. And waited. When it finally arrived, it was - to put it mildly - underwhelming. Fish tacos were cold. Fried chicken sandwich was less than the sum of its parts (I mean, how do you screw up a fried chicken sandwich?).I applaud CSBC for having reasonably priced items on their menu - especially at a time when the EV is exploding with overpriced places - but, even at these prices, we felt overcharged (which we were - the server had left the more expensive bottle of wine on the bill).",,,

If you have to come for brunch, then I recommend getting in line by 8:30am at the latest to put your name down for when the restaurant opens at 9am. My party of five got there a little bit before 10am, and we got seated at 11:30am. Once you're in, though,the food is so good. We got the blueberry pancakes (lives up to the hype), the chicken and waffles (its made with chicken breast which is a thumbs down in my book. Wish they offered a white or dark meat fried chicken option, but otherwise it was good and crispy), the eggs Benedict (delicious) and good black coffee.The service was fine though somewhat scattered. My sis had to ask two different people for some hot water with lemon before she got it. Also there's only one shared bathroom for men and women in the expanded portion of the restaurant?! That makes no senseAnyways a good breakfast food served all day (lunch starts at 11:30). If you don't want to wait, come in the evening and get breakfast for dinner.",2,,2
133,Christine G.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,51,67,4.0,12/22/2017,"This place is excellent in terms of its menu selection, well lighted dining area, customer service, and taste. As you probably would expect  due to the major hype, the star of this restaurant is their blueberry pancakes with maple butter. Without hesitation, their pancakes are truly the best pancakes I've ever had in my LIFE. They're so fluffy, rich, and delicious. However, the only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 1 is because of the incredibly notorious long wait and when the food arrived at my table, it was not warm enough. TIP: download the app NoWait to make reservations at this restaurant ahead of time as early as possible (earlier the better, on weekdays even better!) I came on a Saturday morning at 11:00 AM, made prior reservations via NoWait, but waited close to 2 hours to get a table for 4).",1,,

Most decent brunch spots in NYC will have an outrageous wait anyway. The challenge is striking a balance between not coming here starving, but also being ready to consume a large amount of food. I've been here twice, and both times, the food was fabulous! I'm usually not too crazy about pancakes, but the ones here were fantastic. Did they secretly slip in some addictive substances? (Maybe in the incredible maple butter sauce that comes with the pancakes?) Their chicken and waffle was also amazing. Both fried chicken and Belgian waffle had the perfect texture, and there was a generous amount of both, along with the same addictive maple butter sauce that comes with the pancakes. Service was not remarkable, but not bad, and I was way too busy focusing on the food to mind. I will definitely be back!",1,,2

We only got one to share for the table - we totally regretted it! They were soft, fluffy, and the sweetness was perfect, subtle and lasting.The other food was good with generous portion sizes.

When I finally stepped in it felt a little surreal. I came here for an early-ish dinner, by myself, so there was no wait at all. I sat at the bar, and asked the bartender if I should get the blueberry or the banana walnut pancakes. She offered the perfect solution: both! So I got them mashed up in the same stack of pancakes. Honestly, they were borderline tasty WITH the syrup, and pretty bland without. I've had better pancakes at a local diner.I also got the mexican coffee which was... interesting. It wasn't bad, but didn't make my taste buds fall in love either. I think I'll come back and try other things on the menu, like chicken and waffles, but yeah, I've had my taste of the pancakes.",3,,
139,Jenai C.,"New York, NY",271,21,33,1.0,6/30/2018,Such a disappointment!  We tried to get into this famous brunch spot for a long time only to find that it was subpar food and bad service.  The homemade chicken sausage had nice flavor but was so dry it felt like I was eating styrofoam.  My eggs and biscuit were burnt.  How do you serve burnt food?!  The tomato jam was like eating just flavorless tomato paste.  Potatoes were just also burnt at the the top... no flavor.  You can see from the photo my meal looked less than appetizing.  My husband had the French toast which at least was edible but nothing special.  The waitress never checked on us the whole time we ate.  I honestly don't understand why people love this place.  Don't buy into the hype.  Don't wait 2 hours and Go somewhere else.,,,
140,Cristina G.,"New York, NY",0,13,5,5.0,7/24/2018,"Yes the hype is real. I've been here several times and the food is always great quality! I would definitely recommend the banana walnut pancakes and chicken with waffles. Huevos rancheros is also good. One time I had the eggs Benedict which were good too but a little pricey for me since hey didn't come with any sides (ie potatoes). Speaking of sides...definitely try the sugar cured bacon. I don't even like bacon and this bacon was delicious. The few cons- wait is exceptionally long. For me it goes by pretty quick since I usually have to find parking nearby. There's also a few cute shops in the area. Make sure you download their waiting app. I would pass on their drinks, save your cash for the meal. Another con - cash only. Again never really a problem for me since I always carry cash, but in a large group I can see it being a potential problem. Thanks Clinton for making my tummy happy :)",,,

The grilled chicken sandwich, also $15, but there's huge amount of chicken, and fries.

The chicken was pretty dense and not moist. The syrup was good but that's the same syrup for the blueberry pancakes which tasted better than the waffle with the chicken. The winner was the potato pancakes and splurge for salmon addition. I think even bigger win was getting a side of apple sauce for $1 to add to everything. It tastes like apple pie filling.

Instead of the pancakes which I was told to get once I got there, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros; you could taste the quality.  The guacamole tasted freshly made (it was not just lemon juice mixed in). There was plenty of salsa which I loved but I had to mix it around which I was okay with.

They have the options of swiss, cheddar, spinach, mushrooms, chopped tomatoes or caramelized onions. I went with spinach and mushrooms as my two fillings and added a side of avocado on the side.

They definitely didn't disappoint. The pancakes were light and fluffy. The blueberry sauce on top added a light tartness mixed with the warm maple syrup. Everything together made the perfect bite. The chicken and waffles also had the same maple syrup. The juicy chicken drizzled in the syrup made for a perfect combination of salty and sweet.

The blueberry jam on top pairs so well with the maple butter on the side, and the entire experience is just so delicious without being too sweet. I went on a Wednesday at 8AM right when they opened b/c I saw all the other reviews about long lines, and even at that time there were at least 5-6 other tables eating at the same time as me.

Also, since we were hungry, we went to the bakery next-door to have a little treat.There is no waiting room inside the restaurant, so we had to wait outside. Unfortunately, it was a little hot outside. There were a lot of people waiting outside and sweating. By the time we got our table, we had waited for a little over an hour. I had ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon. It was definitely worth the wait! The biscuits were flaky, the salmon tasted fresh, and the eggs and sauce were perfect.

Received service immediately, server was super patient as we took forever to figure out what we wanted.Ordered the Tortilla Soup and nibbled on wifeys leftover Blueberry Pancakes, soup was great but regretted not ordering her pancakes cause they were damn good. Very reasonably priced considering it's the city, if your picky or it's not on the menu just ask and they'll accommodate you. For sure will return and order more than just the soup, they have a wide array of breakfast items on their menu along with brunch stuff.

I didn't have particularly high expectations going in, since I had already been disappointed by a few highly-rated places in New York. Luckily, Clinton Street did not disappoint. If chicken and waffles are on the menu, chances are I will order it. However this time I wasn't feeling a filling chicken and waffles dish, so I ordered the Spanish scramble with chorizo. Since I did want to try their fried chicken (I generally like to judge places by how their fried chicken is), I ordered a side of it l. And boy was it light, crispy, and downright addicting. I could have eaten a few plates of fried chicken just by itself. But my scramble was flavorful and delicious too! On top of the tons of dishes and sides my 5 other friends got, we also shared the blueberry pancakes, which were extremely fluffy. The reviews raving about them are all accurate. To top off the great experience, we didn't have to wait long for a table of 6 at all. We arrived just after opening and were told to wait at the cafe next door; however our table was ready sooner than we thought so we didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes or so.

They have a system that texts you when your table is ready, and you can also download an app to see how many tables are ahead of you. We waited outside because the waiting area inside was crowded; when we got close to our estimated wait time of 45 minutes, I asked the host how much he approximated our wait time to be; he said another 10 minutes. I then asked if we could sit at the counter, and he said yes! Moral of the story--if you're hungry and willing, ask to sit the counter especially when there are open spots. One thing to keep in mind is that this is cash only, there is an atm across the street, but you can also hit up the Bank of America next to the train station before heading over here. We ordered the clam chowder bowl, chicken and waffle, and spanish omelette. The spanish omelette is not necessarily something I would write home about, but the chicken and waffle was delicious.

The sauce was really good and made the English muffin suprisingly moist and not too dry. The blueberry pancakes were also fluffy and moist. I can see why people rave about these pancakes.

Updated review",Blueberry pancakes...chocolate pancakes...chicken and waffles...peach Bellini....  you name it this place rocks. There are some places that just take you to another place of appreciation for breakfast. Heard of cloud nine?  Well come see what it's like. I'm still dizzy from the tender mouth watering fried chicken laid ever so gently across my perfectly made waffles. The delight in seeing my family enjoy the above mentioned pancakes left them speechless...literally. They actually were so intoxicated by the food I didn't hear from them for a week lol. Seriously this is the spot for breakfast and a great atmosphere. Enjoy #smallhornestyl,1,1,

The maple butter is to die for. The eggs, bacon, and whatever else is good. But the pancakes are the main show. Best pancakes in New York period. Don't walk and run to Clinton street to try it out for yourself",1,1,1
167,Linnea E.,"San Jose, CA",386,718,162,5.0,3/13/2018,"this is another of my go-to places in new york. love it. it's not a big place, so i've heard they can have a bit of a wait. plus people seem to hang out for long periods of time. personally, i've never had to wait, but maybe i'm just lucky (or smart enough not to go at peak times). i did notice last time i was there that hardly anyone left while i was there. like i said... they linger. service: pretty good. people are friendly. they mostly get orders right. if they mess up, it gets corrected quickly.food: ah, the good stuff. they've got it. pancakes are my favorite here... blueberry pancakes. with warm maple butter. omg. out of this world kind of goodness! it's super sweet when all put together, so i can't eat more than half of an order. and then there's the bacon. get a side of sugar cured bacon. so good! lick your fingers kind of good. bacon, pancakes, and a nice mimosa to bring it all together? yes... don't mind if i do! on the last visit my daughter tried the chicken and waffle, which she enjoyed. it's a LOT of chicken. i love that they don't skimp on portions... cuz... leftovers are awesome!if you haven't been... go. go now.",3,,2

There are others!"" HahaAnyways it's a delicious breakfast place and I love breakfast",,,

It got a small lovely touch on the inside and the service is fast and nice. We ordered the Blueberry Pancakes and an Omelette filled with Bacon and Muenster cheese. I only have two words for that: Daaaaamn goood! If you are searching for amazing food and a good quality brunch spot this is so far my favorite and best place to go to,1,,
170,Marlena C.,"Manhattan, NY",486,12,14,5.0,6/14/2018,"Chicken and waffle: The waffle tasted like any other waffle, what really set it apart was the syrup that it came with. The chicken was well seasoned and crispy yet juicy at the same time. Coffee Milkshake: When I first drank it there was a strong coffee flavor, but after a few more sips all I tasted was cream. Not the best milkshake I've ever had.",,,

Their biscuits are especially to die for! I can't get enough!! So many delicious options to choose from on the menu. It's hard to go wrong. Their customer service is also excellent! They don't take reservations so sometimes the wait for seats can be long but it is totally worth it!! Highly recommend this place for brunch!!,,,
172,Angela T.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",4,20,75,5.0,3/13/2018,"We came here on a busy Saturday afternoon but it was worth the wait. We waited a little over an hour, which was consider good since the host had told me 1.5-2 hours wait. I haven't been here for a while and the menu and brunch specials have changed a lot.We ordered:Brunch special: Oyster Benedict ($21)Blueberry pancakes with warm maple syrup ($15)Fried Chicken & waffles ($17)MochaRegular CoffeeIt didn't take long for the food to arrive. The coffee and mocha came first, I have never seen such a big cup of mocha before, but it wasn't too sweet and you can still taste the slight bitterness of the coffee. My oyster benedict came first, the eggs were perfectly poaches with a runny yolk. Unlike other typical benedicts that uses muffins, they used a buttermilk biscuit with sautéed spinach under the egg, along with the hollandaise sauce, it was the perfect pairing.  The oysters were perfectly fried to crisp. Next we have the fried chicken and waffle which was very typical. The fried chicken wasn't too oily unlike other places where they drenched the chicken in oil.  Lastly, the pancake finished off this meal perfectly after the savory food. The blueberries were freshly scattered on top of the pancakes.  Pancakes were warm, fluffy and toasty. Service was great; the waitresses were super friendly, always refilled our water and checked up on us periodically.  We would definitely return despite the long wait time.",3,,

Came with a group of 6 around 2 and was quoted an hour wait. We ended up waiting only 30 and were seated. The food took awhile to come out but everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. I was worried the pancakes wouldn't live up to the hype but they were indeed good. I wouldn't say they were the best pancakes I've ever eaten but they were fluffy and the maple butter syrup concoction was good as well.,4,2,3

A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this kitchen has achieved such success that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Here in Gotham, the space is comfy and the service, impressive. Light and lovely chicken tortilla soup sees a pile of fried tortilla strips over a hearty broth bobbing with carrots, celery and shredded chicken. But breakfast for dinner is always a treat here, especially when golden Belgian waffles are served with warm maple butter and buttermilk-brined fried chicken for a flawless union of sweet and salt. Speaking of breakfast, it's cash-only during the day but credit cards are welcome at dinnertime.",,,

And even now, I just went to the pickup place they have next door and ordered it to go (nn a Monday afternoon it was still 45-60 minutes to be seated). They have plenty of seats in the to go area but you can't eat the food there, which makes sense, otherwise it's just a bigger restaurant with the same wait time. The specials are not written by the register, but back by the bathrooms on a chalkboard painted wall. Makes no sense, so go check those out before you order!Hot apple cider and a root beer float while you wait are both good choices. The pancakes are delicious, absolutely done perfectly, this is the ideal other pancakes aspire to. It's still a pancake though, ya know? The banana walnut stack comes with a nice caramel-type sauce, although I preferred the maple syrup. Mixing them together was good too. The chicken sausage is skippable. Not bad, just a little on the dry side. The bacon rocks though (the picture doesn't do it justice). Sooo goood, perfect amount of fat. I actually ended up really loving the huevos rancheros. Soft scrambled eggs, fresh guacamole, tender and flavorful chorizo. I'd come back just for this and get my pancake fix at a diner.",,,

179,Annie C.,"Philadelphia, PA",339,122,187,4.0,10/30/2017,"We came here as out of town visitors on a last breakfast in Manhattan. They have a pretty strict policy on only seating complete parties. When we decided to get seated as we weren't sure our other friend would show up for breakfast,  the hostess was very ungracious about it and told us if our friend came she would be ""seated in the order of arrival."" A bit off putting as we were already a table of 3 people.The food was delicious and middle of the road price for NYC brunch. We got the banana nut pancakes which were came in an ample stack of 3, complete with banana syrup, and two plates with eggs /sausages. All were delicious and very satisfying.In short, one star off for the service attitude but great for food otherwise.",,,

But combine my starvation with a 1.5+ hour wait and a beaming yelp proclamation for their blueberry pancakes... I had to try it. Honestly the best pancakes I've ever had! Sooo fluffy and not overly sweet. the syrup was also made to perfection. If you've ever had the infamous blueberry donuts in Anaheim, CA.. that's what these pancakes remind me of.",2,,1

183,Amy V.,"New York, NY",189,42,38,5.0,5/29/2018,"Expect to wait around 30 minutes if you come here on a weekend for breakfast. This place is really popular. However, I think it's worth it because the food is really good. I ordered the super popular blueberry pancakes and my sister ordered the also very popular Chicken & Waffles. We also got the fresh squeezed orange juice. The orange juice is very pulpy so if you don't like pulp, I would probably not order it. But it was very refreshing and sweet.The blueberry pancakes are so good and worth trying at least once when you come here. It's made super fluffy but a little crispy on the outside so it tastes so nice when you eat it. The blueberries in the pancakes were so good. It was not too sweet but not tart either. The best part of the pancakes is the maple syrup!! It is very sweet but balances out the pancakes super well. Although it doesn't seem like a lot because it's two pancakes, it's super filling. The fried chicken and waffles are highly recommended by everyone because it's really good. Definitely worth getting. The chicken is tender and the crisp on the outside is perfect. It's also flavored with something else that makes the fried chicken kind of sweet in a good way. The waffle is ok. It's meh on it's own but they give you the maple syrup dressing (the same one as the blueberry pancakes) which definitely makes up for the lack of taste with the waffle. The chicken with the maple syrup is interesting. My sister who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth didn't like it but I loved it. This place is hyped and for good reason! I really like eating here. I admit that it is quite pricey but ultimately, I think it's worth it once in a while. I also find myself have random cravings for their blueberry pancakes after having it so I definitely plan on coming back.",,,

185,Daniela P.,"New York, NY",135,202,101,2.0,3/4/2018,"If you follow global icon Chrissy Teigen on Snapchat (before their dreadful update), you'll have seen that she shared that Clinton Street has the BEST pancakes. I took a screenshot, showed my boyfriend, and lived vicariously through that photo for months...Until, we FINALLY decided to make the schlep all the way down to Clinton Street Baking Company. We came on a weekday, in the morning, and it wasn't super crowded like everyone makes it out to seem. I'm sure they experience higher volumes on the weekends, but we didn't have to wait (and there were a few tables open). The hostess was nice, guided us to our table, and left us to ponder the menus. I decided on the Blueberry pancakes (duh!) and the sugar-cured bacon. My boyfriend wanted the chicken and waffles. It was set. We ordered and waited about 20 minutes for our food to come. I have to say, I hate eating out in NYC. The places are always overcrowded, so loud, and just obnoxious. Thankfully, the ambiance at Clinton Street Baking Company was completely different. They had music playing, but it was low, the tables were fairly spread apart, and the crowd was just mellow. I could hear across the table and actually have a conversation. When our food came, it looked delicious! But, I have to be honest. The pancakes did NOT live up to the hype. I'm not sure why, but they were not nearly as fluffy as everyone made it out to seem. They were very dry and thick, and I couldn't even get through half my stack (and I am a LOVER of pancakes). The blueberries were OK. The bacon was good (I mean, it's bacon), but my pieces were overcooked and slightly burnt, which made it difficult to chew. It wasn't very enjoyable. My boyfriend's chicken and waffles were alright. Nothing to rave home about. The chicken was definitely better than the waffle. I'm not sure what happened quality wise, but we really were bummed that our experience didn't seem to live up to everyone else's, especially considering that they were not overly packed. I'd love to give them another shot, but they're definitely not the cheapest place to go to. Facility itself has cute decor and the bathrooms were clean. All in all, I probably wouldn't go back.",1,1,2

The wait always deterred me, but my friend and I decided to bite the bullet and wake up at 8AM on a Sunday to get a table. The restaurant opens at 9AM, we got there at 8:50AM and the line was already wrapped around the corner. We luckily were able to get a table and were seated almost immediately.The restaurant itself is relatively small, seating somewhere between 20 and 30 people. The atmosphere is nice-a homey diner-like feeling. Our waitress was really friendly. The tap water was ice cold. Yada yada yada. I know all people are really curious about is the food. WELL. My friend and I both ordered the chocolate chunk pancakes (bear in mind that this is probably the 2nd time in my life that I've ordered something sweet for brunch-it's usually savory all the way). We also got a side of fries to split!The fries were delicious-crispy, meaty, and piping hot. We couldn't stop eating them. The pancakes were also spectacular-maybe not all that they're hyped up to be and not necessarily worth a multiple hour wait, but certainly delicious. Fluffy, warm, and with piles of chocolate baked into them. They also come with this heavenly maple butter, oh my gosh I could bathe in that butter. Warm, sweet, buttery maple goodness, it was the whole nine yards. Honestly though, no matter how good this whole dish was, it was incredibly heavy and rich. I started feeling a bit sick after half of the pancakes, and only ended up eating a few more bites before stopping. My friend half-heartedly agreed but still managed to eat all her food, so maybe I really am just more of a savory brunch gal. Tl;dr: good service, long wait, delicious pancakes. Come for the maple butter. Fries are also good. Cash only!",1,,

Blueberry Pancakes (4/5) - The pancakes are their specialty, so make sure to order a plate. I've had better pancakes where the blueberries tasted more infused with the pancakes but these were still really good. The syrup takes it up a level. Crab Cake Benedict (4/5) - This was a special menu item. Plenty of flavor and super filling. Bacon (5/5) - One of my friends ordered a plate with scrambled eggs bacon and I think hash.

I had the fresh grapefruit juice and it was yummy. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich (duh it's me) which came with home made fries that were perfect and a cole slaw with pickle that was really good. The LES pickle was especially good because it was tart and juice but not sweet. The sandwich itself was good, the lemon pepper mayo was so light and fresh when paired with the chicken which was a bit too heavy on the oil and not flavorful enough solo. The buns didn't seem too fresh honestly, but it wasn't bad. My friend tried the waffle with poached pears and liked that very much.The service is clean and prompt, but it's a bit too loud in there. I would most certainly go back for the brunch menu, which is what I went to try but by the time we got a table it was way to late.",,,

Got here around 7pm and we were seated immediately. Guess dinner isn't as crazy as brunch. Like most people, I cannot rave enough about their pancakes. So light and fluffy and perfection in every way. The maple butter syrup they serve it with is just phenomenal. On the particular night we went, it was German chocolate pancakes. There was caramel sauce on one side and chocolate sauce on the other. Large bits of chocolate chips and nuts on the pancake. We also got an order of the fried chicken dinner. So much chicken and overall just so much food. Really delicious fried goodness. Mixture of dark and white meat.

CASH ONLY!!!I've come here once for brunch, which had over an hour's wait, and for dinner which had no wait. If you're dying to try the food here, come for dinner as the menu is always available. The ambiance is markedly different for dinner - much emptier and their non-breakfast dinner menu is just not spectacular. Come here for brunch over dinner.Things I've had:1) Pancakes - 5/5. Out of this world good; terrific portion sizes, fluffy and light and what you'd imagine a perfect pancake being.2) Huevos rancheros - 3/5. Just ok; too much salsa made the whole thing a little soggy and there wasn't anything standout about it. 3) Southern breakfast - 4/5. they can make this vegetarian by substituting for veggies.

When we walked in at 1115, my friend and I grabbed the last two seater. I know Clinton's is notorious for having REALLY long lines, so I was super grateful that we didn't have to wait. Woot wootStaff was friendly. They came back super quick to take our order, without being pushy or rushing us. Hopefully they're the same way when it's crowded as well. We all know service can become less than subpar when crowds get crazy and the hangry comes out in everyone. Anywho, my friend insisted on trying the pancakes. Said they're legit BOMB here. But here's the thing. I'm a savory brunch kinda girl, but I do love a good side of pancakes to try (as a dessert amirite?). Well, unfortunately, they don't do half orders here bah. We each got a plate and finallyyy decided on the pancakes bc YOLO. I got the smoked salmon Benedict's and shared the blueberry pancakes. Okay, great review so far right? So why the four stars? Well, benedicts are 100% my brunch jam, and these ones weren't ALL that. SUPER SUPER thin slices of salmon lox. Like, were they in the dish?? Th eggs were perfectly poached, and those biscuits with it were amazing!! BUT that hollandaise sauce drenched on those suckers were basically yellow mayo. ACK. NO. Not disgusting, but no. BUT those pancakes...omfg. Soft and chewy on the inside. Perfectly crispy on the out! Crispy?! I know, right. Yes, the exact amount of crisp you didn't know you needed in a pancake. Blueberries and the dipping sauce were also tangy and sweet...great balance to the cakes. In the end, it made for a bit of an awkward farewell when the waitress dropped the check off and said with a stone cold face, CASH ONLY. Seriously, she yelled it. But okay, it's her job. And we didn't know. Had to go to an ATM before we could leave. It was fine, but slightly off putting. All in all, a solid 4 star restaurant!",,,

Perfect diner-type pancake consistency. The maple syrup is delicious. My only two complaints about the pancakes are the time they took to come out. As a reminder, they had just opened and generally pancakes don't take that long to come out. They're the quickest thing to make. Also, the blueberries were only in the center of the pancakes. Not evenly dispersed throughout, which is a shame because they are the star of the show. I probably won't return because I like my pancakes a little bit more moist and melt-in-your-mouth-like.
