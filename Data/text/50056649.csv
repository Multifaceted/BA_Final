0,Ava F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,33,20,4.0,11/8/2018,"This place is good for a quick food stop if you want a good meal, that's not too expensive. You can take it back to work with you if you are on your lunch break, or eat it there, even though this location has limited seating. I would say the selection isn't the largest I've ever seen but you have a decent amount of choices that you can modify to make it more to your liking. You can customize each bowl, or get it made already, and it makes the whole process really smooth if you're on a time crunch. The service is excellent, and they are so quick, we didn't even have to wait for them to make our bowls. The chicken is so tender, this has just become a staple for me for lunch time or when I'm just in need of a well-balanced meal to take wherever. Below is a picture of the Bueno Bowl, those beans were delicious. I would say it's just about the amount of food you would typically get for the price and it totaled to about $12.50. I didn't give it 5 stars because there isn't anything spectacular about the menu or the place itself, it's just a really good staple to have in the back of your mind when you're either out of inspiration, or need to go for a reliable lunch option.",,,
1,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,2.0,10/4/2018,Meh.That pretty much sums up this meal. I was super excited when I saw this lunch spot as I love chicken. I got the miso bowl which was tasty but nothing to get excited about. The portion was small and the price was fairly high. Nothing to write home about.,12,3,5
2,Tanzima R.,"Jersey City, NJ",32,122,65,3.0,6/22/2018,"Was in the area and came in for an impromptu lunch. There were lots of people here but the line moved lightening fast. The seating area and store in general is small - there weren't that many places to sit but hubby and I were able to grab a spot. Side note: decor at this location is very cute. I ordered the make your own bowl with herb chicken breast with 2 sides: roasted broccoli and brussels blue mix. Hubby got the grilled mojo chicken thighs with 2 sides: black beans and baby potatoes. The sauces we shared were habanero mango and maple chipotle. Both of our orders were served on top of a small portion of brown rice. I will admit that the food was tasty. This was the first and only meal we had eaten that day. And let me tell you, and hour or so after eating I WAS SO BLOATED. Like bloated I had never been in my life. And no I am not gluten intolerant. I had brown rice and broccoli just last week. Something made me hella bloated from this meal and I don't know what! None of the food groups I ate were new or unfamiliar to me. Now I'm sitting on my couch 5 hours later with my belly out, still bloated, unable to do anything productive.P.S. - my hubby was fine afterwards, only I became the bloat monster for whatever reason.",1,,
3,Lily C.,"Manhattan, NY",165,83,222,4.0,4/18/2018,"A great place to go if you want to have chicken with some yummy yet healthy sides! The chicken is nice and juicy. You can choose between quarter leg, quarter breast, half chicken or whole chicken (family size). There are options between chicken bowls and chicken salads. I've tried making my own entree before with a quarter chicken with 2 sides, and it's a decent amount of food. I've also tried a few of the bowls including the good bowl, bueno bowl and mo'miso. If you like chicken and want something on the healthier end, this is a good place to try.",1,,
4,Chelsea P.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,96,234,4.0,4/18/2018,"This place is legit right up the block from my job and I never thought to even stop here but I'm very glad I did today . It's a simple bright decor spot but I loved it . I got the Country bbq bowl . It had pulled bbq chicken , brown rice black beans and a apple coleslaw with cheddar . It was absolutely delicious . I feel like it's the perfect amount and it was so tasty . I really enjoyed the chicken I even loved the price lol. It's a perfect place to eat in the city . Not extremely expensive and you're getting all the food groups you need . I also like how you can make it a veggie bowl. So glad I came here and the staff is sweet !",,,1
5,Shayla C.,"Newark, NJ",366,42,73,4.0,3/15/2018,"This place is on par with the ""Dig Inn"" type of healthy quick food establishments of the world. There are lots of options on the menu from plates to salads to bowls to boneless chicken to bone-in chicken. And lots of sauce flavors to choose from for the chicken (there is no fried option). One thing I would warn you of is to make sure you're getting a hot side if that's what you're looking for! I got corn thinking it would be warm, but it wasn't.",1,,
6,Jasper D.,,13,19,4,5.0,9/1/2018,Their good bowl is delicious! Chicken is so moist and its best if you eat it while its hot I had a meal here twice already and definitely looking forward to some other items. Price point is not bad too for the amount of food you get. Ambiance is a bit meh but aside from the solid food for a good price.,,,

Updated review","It seems I left the first review at the wrong location. I'd hope a chain would be responsible for quality control in all of its restaurants- but that's not my place. 5/21Ordered a custom bowl, open up my lunch and there's a piece of plastic on my chicken + 2$ for a 1/4 of a not-quite-ripe avocado. Mushy brown rice as others have noted, not a deal breaker. However, as though that wasn't enough - hair. Hair in my bowl. I've literally had a more unpleasant lunch takeout experience",,,
8,Christina G.,"New York, NY",321,431,540,4.0,7/12/2017,"Came here to pick up lunch. Was impressed with the efficiency of ordering and getting my food as it was pretty crowded. I had the miso chicken bowl and also ordered a side of the Mexican corn. The bowl was super filling and had a nice variety of ingredients. However they prepare the brown rice base, I need that recipe. It was so tender and flavorful! I ended up barely touching the corn and saved for later in my company fridge. The corn was delicious and was actually tossed with shredded romaine, which was a different preparation that what I've traditionally ate with Mexican corn. Definitely would recommend if you're looking for a healthy filling meal option.",2,1,2
9,Achiaa P.,"New York, NY",213,153,574,3.0,9/5/2017,"I made a custom bowl of 1/4 chicken with 2 sides: the kale and butternut squash and the rice and beans, I also got a scoop of avocado for $1.40, which was ridiculous for the portion.(never thought chipotle would be better at  portions of avocado dished out)The chicken was cooked to perfection, it was fall of the bone tender and really well seasoned-definitely the highlight of the meal.The rice and beans was a 5/10. It could've used 2 pinches of salt even if it's a healthy place(healthy not bland)The kale and butternut squash was the regret item on my plate. It was extremely sweet- it has some cranberries or something in it- and it comes cold.All in all it was a filling meal with good portions and I'll probably be back to try some of the fixed bowls.",,,1

Updated review","Fields Good Chicken is my go-to lunch spot. The chicken is always fresh, delicious and perfectly seasoned!They have seasonal bowls which give you a variety if you're looking for it. I've only ever tried the bowls and it's a good balance of carbs, protein, veggies.",1,,1
11,Mike M.,"Denver, CO",289,38,0,2.0,9/24/2018,"This was just really an odd place.

12,Devonta W.,"New York, NY",355,80,185,5.0,2/13/2018,Hands down one of my favorite places in the city to grab lunch. The Field's Good Chicken is seasoned to delicious perfection.I recommend trying the Bueno Bowl or the Chicken with 2 Sides (broccoli and potatoes). During lunch the line goes super fast and after work it's great to just come in and sit down and have a meal.,,,1
13,Arelis D.,"New York, NY",43,76,368,4.0,7/11/2017,"I came here for lunch with my husband. We each ordered roast chicken.  I got mine with potatoes and he ordered rice and beans. The chicken was the star and was very juicy. However, the flavor did not blow me away. They give you sauces on the side. I got barbecue sauce and my husband ordered guacamole and the habanero mango sauce. The sauces were just ok, a bit too thin, and not exceptional.  Overall, it was good for lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",1,,
14,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",276,412,694,4.0,3/1/2018,"Number of visits: 8The office is right in the area and it is such a good way to get some source of healthy not so dead protein along with sides that are full of flavors. Order a quarter chicken, half of a chicken, dark meat, white meat, whatever you want and pair it up with your favorite goodies.I usually go for dark meat, their amazing broccoli and my full on addiction of kale and squash salad. So appetizing and a good amount food, sometimes I leave a little bite for later because it's just too much.For the first time today, I got me a bowl - they say the bueno bowl is the top seller and it is muyyy bueno. I skipped the beans, but it is still full of flavor, going to be difficult to choose with this and my go tos from here on out. Typically I order for pick up, but today I decided to go on line. The line moves so quickly during lunch time that it doesn't eat up too much of your time. I am fascinated by the way they operate, super efficient and I was out of there so soon!There are seating for small groups if you are to eat there. You can also snag a glass of water from the staff so it is a pretty solid location. I would share photos, but I was too hungry. Next time!",,,
15,Shannon c.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,10/3/2018,"I really loved this place when it first opened and into earlier this year. The food is good but the constant menu changes suck. I get mixing it up but at least keep some of the favorites. Nobody likes to go into their lunch spot only to find that your go to lunch has been removed, yet again. At this point there is nothing in the current offering that I would go for. Hope you guys eventually land the plane. Good luck.",,,
16,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,4.0,5/30/2017,"They have plenty of healthy options (you can check nutritional values in their website), but really flavorful!! Think of a Dig Inn, but specialized in chicken.For me it is perfect for weeknight dinner as it is a few blocks from home. It is a healthy casual place for take-out or also dine-in (at least at night they always have room). If I would work nearby I would probably drop by for lunch every week. So far I have tried:- The Good Salad w/o cheese: awesome! Healthy and mediumly filling (prob. bc I took out the cheese. I like they let you alter the ingredients.- Bueno Bowl: the name says it all, a Mexican inspired dish. Like a Chipotle, but with better quality chicken and no salmonella ;)- Half bird with one side of massaged kale and squash: loved it! Too bad you can't choose only white meat, it is literally half chicken (one tight and one breast). The fresh herb salsa verde and tangy BBQ are to die for! So is the massaged kale and squash! The pumpkin seeds gives it some crunchiness.Keep it up FGC!! We need more places like this around the city.",1,,

Little cubes of squash, delicately charred, transformed into orange nectary NUGGETS OF DELICIOUSNESS (sweet potato/candied yams flavor) it was really good-Aged Grafton Cheese. I'll let you find out.

They are very hearty and make for a great lunch option, perfect for this location. Try the Bueno Bowl ($10), which is like a great, lighter version of something you might find at Chipotle, with grilled chicken, brown rice, black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo and maple chipotle sauce.They also do whole roasted chickens and sides, which also look good, but the bowls and salads make for a nice, easy portable meal.",9,6,7
24,Jayson C.,"Jamaica, NY",14,176,426,4.0,6/6/2017,"I noticed this place on my way to other Ktown restaurants and finally had a chance to try their Chicken.The Rotisserie Chicken here are moist and flavorful.  It is alot better then Boston Market's Chicken.  The place is modern and clean with courteous staff.My only complaint for not giving it 5 stars is due to the price.  Half a chicken is $10-11 which is okay.  Once you start adding on a side it jump to 13.30 for 1 side & 16.50 for 2 sides.  So sample side portion added to it was about $3 each.   $16-17 dollar for a half chicken in a self service place is not cheap.My 2 coworkers ordered the Good Chiicken Bowl and they said it was good and they shared a side of  potatoes.   I had potatoes & the Mexican corn as my 2 side add ons to the half a chicken and ended up with more potatoes then corn.   The corn was sweet and tasted amazing. You can choose a free sauce and I had the Maple Sauce which was tasty.Overall if I would like to return here but probably will just get a chicken bowl or just the Rotisserie Chicken.  The Chicken is moist and juicy and tasted amazing.Adding 1 or 2 sides as add ons for $3 or $6 is not a good deal in my opinion for the amount of food they give as a side.P.S.  My next trick when I return - get a whole chicken and shareIf you get the whole chicken for $17.25 and share with a co-worker, you be getting the price down to ~9 for half a chicken each which is a good deal for Chicken of this quality.   Please click helpful ;)",1,,1
25,Elain T.,"New York, NY",594,166,121,5.0,11/22/2016,"I passed by this place so many times while it was under construction and didn't think much of it. My coworker came here last week when it opened and got the bueno bowl. I tried a small piece of the grilled mojo chicken and FELL IN LOVE, so I finally came today and found my new favorite lunch spot!1:45pm, no lines. It's a relatively small space with maybe 6-7 tables? Really lovely interior with a lot of character. I read on one of the plaques that the beams on the ceiling were taken from an old church in the Bronx.To order, an employee is at the front of the line with an iPad. You tell her what you want and proceed to the register to check out and wait for your food. I really like this process because it eliminates having to lean against the glass and shout to an employee or attempt to point to what you want and end up getting the wrong thing (literally me at any assembly line style place). I was in and out of there in less than five minutes!I ordered the boneless grilled mojo chicken served over rice with mexican corn off the cobb and steamed baby potatoes. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. The chipotle cotija dressing on the corn is to die for, and the baby potatoes are perfectly cooked (not too mushy, but they're not crispy). I also got the fresh herb salsa verde and really enjoyed how refreshing it is.",1,,

I had the herbed chicken platter with beets and potatoes. Comes over rice. White meat chicken is actually moist and flavorful. Rice is terrific, potatoes fingerling and nicely cooked. All told a good experience. There's water and cups after you pay, by the seating with the utensils. Iced cold and nice. Unless you like new age soda, save 3 bucks and grab a cup. Recommended.",1,1,1

When they first open the restaurant I believe the beginning of 2017 food was consistent. I eat in this restaurant at least once a week I noticed that after lunch 2p they get sloppy with their service. On Jan 2 , I ordered a Mo Miso chicken from the cashier  manager Mark. I noticed that the food server was emptying out the trash at dining area. As I waited patiently Mark took another 10 orders. Finally the guy the was emptying out the garbage came back to serve the 10 orders that were up.At no time did Mark try to help him get orders out. On top of that the guy who was making the orders try to do all 10 at the same time which made all food orders cold, so disappointed. The chicken is dry the rice is cold just terrible.

I got the Fields Good Cobb without the blue cheese. Then I had to walk down to the next register and paid. The cashier wasn't very inviting. No smile, no thank you, nothing. My lunch was about $12 and change. The salad came out fast. If you see my images you can see it was not presentable like the yelpers salad images. All the toppings were on the bottom with the white balsamic vinaigrette and the grilled chicken was on top. I wasn't aware I had to shake up the bowl myself. The bowl was also dirty with avocado all over. There was way too much dressing and the bottom half of the salad was drenched. The flavor wasn't spectacular on the chicken either. For the $ I expected better. Maybe I need to try other items but it was too much $ for me especially down the block I could've gotten a salad for $8-9 with tastier dressing and toppings.

Updated review","I walk past this place all the time on my way to Korea town in NYC. It's a relatively new spot in the midtown mashup of food. Looks clean and the storefront is clear and bright. I went in on a day where I was craving a sa dey for a late lunch then walked by this place thinking, this may be a place to get good fried chicken. Boy was I wrong! This place sells crafted market plates of chicken with an abundance of veggies and salads, nothing fried here. The service is friendly and service is fast. You walk up to a hostess and place your order on an iPad the. Move over to another line to pay and wait for your order to be made in the open kitchen.  I got the Zeus, which is of course Greek inspired, and it comes with brown rice and pickled veggies. The food was good but my biggest problem was the amount of vinegar in the pickled onions. It's so much song to it that hours later my lips are slighty burnt from the pungent flavors. I won't mind coming back here as long as they take it easy on the vinegar.",,,

My salad was great and very good portions of ingedients and chcken. The Bueno Bowl is DELICIOUS! If you live or work around this spot definitely great for lunch or a quick healthy dinner! So glad for more quick, healthy options in this area!",1,,1
49,Caroline H.,"Manhattan, NY",181,153,145,4.0,2/20/2017,"Really like this place.  The Bueno Bowl is delicious and filling.  It's kind of like a better, healthier burrito bowl.  Their salads are good too - I'd recommend the Cobb in particular.",,,
50,Nicole G.,"New York, NY",275,169,109,4.0,2/19/2017,Fields Good... more like Feels Good chicken!Tried the Good Bowl and it was great. Quinoa was tastefully seasoned and cooked perfectly. The squash had a slightly sweet-syrupy taste but nothing that felt unhealthy. The bowl was filling and quite satisfying. I appreciate the ability to order boneless skinless chicken breast as a healthy alternative and will be back to try that and the rest of the menu!,,,
51,Josh B.,"Jersey City, NJ",172,704,757,3.0,11/30/2016,"Rotisserie chicken purists will enjoy the well-prepared poultry while experimenters will welcome the sauces (a knockout maple-chipotle on tonight's visit.) And it wasn't a peak time but I was very impressed that the service was actually speedier than most fast food joints. However, the potatoes were problematic, with an oily seasoning and a deal-breaking al dente texture.",1,,1
52,Ericka N.,"Laurelton, Queens, NY",226,30,15,4.0,2/3/2017,This place is great. The chicken is fantastic- well seasoned and tender. They also have healthy and tasty side orders. Lots of gluten free options and they clearly label for allergies. They lost a star because they have run out of chicken a couple of times I've been there during the lunch rush. I purchased the quinoa bowls which were great but I was looking forward to the roasted chicken.,,,

54,Tiffany C.,"Staten Island, NY",3,26,7,4.0,12/1/2016,"I liked this place a lot more than I anticipated! Stopped in for lunch today - no line but I went at 11:30, earlier than the normal lunchtime rush. I was in and out in under 5 minutes.I ordered The Good Bowl (which donates $1 to an environmental charity) and a side of the Mexican Corn Off the Cob. Both were delicious, albeit expensive. The side of corn was maybe 1/3 cup size and is $5. The bowl was $10.-1 Star because of the price points and also because I wish they let you pick which chicken you can add to the bowls (I would've preferred white meat).Definitely would come back.",,,
55,J F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,91,0,3.0,12/12/2017,"Finally went after a friend told me he eats here 1x week. Disappointment. Disappointment.  I found it bland, i satisfying and not worth the price or calories. On the same note my eating partner thought it was "" pretty good"" and eats here often. Meh",,,
56,Andrew L.,"Manhattan, NY",173,31,0,5.0,4/28/2017,"I love this place. Great food: healthy and delicious. I Recommend the good bowl with the mango habanero. I wish I knew about this place sooner, you guys gotta start advertising or something!",,,
57,Aleksandr G.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,14,0,4.0,7/31/2017,"I really like their roast chicken. It's succulent and tasty. My only gripe is that the skin could use a bit less salt/seasoning! After eating it for lunch, I have to guzzle water for the rest of the day. I would definitely recommend balancing the chicken out with a starchy side or yogurt sauce to cut through the saltiness.",,,
58,Chris H.,"Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY",7,75,332,5.0,1/31/2017,"Honestly one of the most underrated places in the area. Not sure how crowded it is during lunch but I often come after the gym for some mojo chicken and a side of beets with goat cheese or broccoli. And man this chicken is incredible. I usually eat it without sauce because it's so good but I tried the habanero mango hot sauce and that's amazing as well. A full meal is $9.25, and the place uses compostable packaging, so it's basically a steal. Highly recommend !",,,
59,Eric N.,"Grayson, GA",56,5,0,5.0,2/13/2017,Great fresh food! They had great customer service and clean restaurant. It offers a great variety of sides with the rest chicken.,,,

62,Carl G.,"New York, NY",0,20,0,3.0,12/2/2016,Fields. Was fine.  The chicken  was quite good . Potatoes were nice. Just enough butter.  Broccoli was not very good The overly bright restaurant was not inviting.  The staff was a touch clueless.I will try some other items.Rotisserie chicken from fairway is a better deal and just as good,,,
63,Edgar B.,"Queens, NY",4,6,0,4.0,12/1/2016,"Its JUST TOO GOOD, this place is soooo great i cant even explain. The FOOD IS just as good as the looks, the people were very friendly and i love it. The food is also served pretty fast but with exellence.",,,
