0,Latia C.,"Hackensack, NJ",65,36,30,4.0,11/12/2018,"Had an ABSOLUTE GREAT time here!  Came for a girls night out for dinner last Thursday and we all completely enjoyed ourselves. I made our reservations through Yelp for 9pm and when I arrived the hostess was very welcoming. I explained that I was waiting for two of my friends to arrive (they came about 15min later) and she said it was no problem. Once they arrived we were seated in the back area along side the bar. Our waitress was very charming and engaging with us, gave recommendations on the drinks and food, and checked on us throughout the night. The food was SLAMMING!  We ordered their crab cakes, empanadas, chicken wings, lobster ravioli, salmon & potatoes, tiramisu, brownie, and a couple of drinks. Our bill was a little over $200 and it was worth it because we were all pleased. The manager spent time with us as well, had good conversation and some shots too! Only negative (which isnt a super big deal) was the DJ.  I enjoy throwback music, but the selection and transitions could have been better.",1,,1
1,Shannon C.,"Flatbush - Ditmas Park, NY",0,3,0,1.0,11/16/2018,"This place has gone sooo far downhill.  On a Friday night: The DJ is just fine, like blah fine, not even moving the majority of the room but the music flows together. The crowd is a bunch of people in their 50s, as someone well into my adult years this crowd could be my parents or uncles. The last time I was here the drinks were quite watered down. Tonight's atmosphere it's a ""fool me once... fool me twice..."" situation.Cover for men.Oh and one of the bouncers/security is always on a power trip... rejected from the Nypd can't get a job elsewhere butthurt level power trip.",1,,
2,Shanita M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",21,42,74,4.0,11/6/2018,"I had been wanting to try this place for some time being that Harlem is kind of my stomping ground....so when a co-worker recieved a promotion/transfer we gathered as a group to do his farewell here.....we all came together on Thursday after work.....to enjoy what was left of the nice weather....I was surprised to see so many people on a week day at the establishment......my group was able to get a back curved corner both that accommodated us well......With such a large party we opted for drinks....and shareable appetizers.....wings.....sliders.....and shrimp nachos......we stayed here for HOURS.....the drinks were nice and strong....but we had a wonderful time....I would recommend the ""Uptown Baby"" or ""Social Mint""......And for it to have been a Thursday...the place got packed......and the a mix of today's R&B mixed with 90's music I can not complain.As far as price....I can not truly say because we were a bigger party.....and we partied......our tab was extremely high....but for 9 people we snacked on appetizers.....had cocktails.....shots....and drink top shelf liquor and was ther from 5pm to almost 11.....the $1060 tab I found more than reasonable...Being that I did like this place but did not get the full experience.....I went back....alone and had the smothered porkchop with grits.....based on that meal alone I would recommend this place to everyone....Oh and shoutout to the bomb waitstaff.....I believe Jessica was our server......",1,,
3,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1723,618,4315,5.0,10/24/2018,I hardly go to Harlem... but I have been here a few times  but it has been years. Last time was recently for a friend's bday since she loves Harlem....I made reservations but it didn't seem necessary when we went around 6/7 pm since there were a lot of open tables but it did get busy at night Surprised that we were able to snag street parking not far away. But definitely check out parking times on an app to be sure. Service was excellent . We had Aundra and she was spectacular. Attentive and friendly!! She really made our evening a great one! We tried the crab cake and shrimp salad for appetizer which was pretty good! My friend had the shrimp and grits and I had the lobster ravioli. And we loved our dishes. Very yummy 90's hip hop and r&b was PERFECT.  Cocktails - I had the Uptown Baby and friend had the Lion. We loved our drinks. We also had some coconut tequila shots as recommended by our Bartender Aundra! Very yummy Would definitely come back again . NO DOUBT!,9,6,9
4,Kenya M.,"Rockville, MD",60,177,584,4.0,11/15/2018,We stumbled upon this establishment. So happy we did. What a vibe! Great music from the DJ. Nice drinks. And that turkey burger...better than I imagined it was going to be. Delicious! With the cranberry spread. Brioche bun. (I just re-lived eating that burger.) I can't wait to go back.,,,
5,Gary M.,"New York, NY",13,20,5,1.0,11/17/2018,"This is a mixed review because I love your food, Happy Hour, staff, and so forth, save this security detail, who is here at 11:37 pm on a Saturday. The treatment I have received is totally preposterous.",2,1,1
6,Alecia T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,6,7,3.0,10/21/2018,"I went on a Sunday Great ambience! Foot ball game was on , they had a nice big screen tv towards the back . Appetizer: Ceviche Mixto which was okay . Sweet and sour taste . Entree: Wild Mushroom Sandwich It was pretty good . W/ Truffle fries Drinks : social mule ( very tiny ) and Harlem sage . I don't think the drinks were worth $14 . They were ok. Better off getting beer here . My friend had the lamb chops and a side of mash potatoes. The food needed more salt to taste . And I felt the mash potatoes didn't taste authentic, more like out the box . Overall Cool place, good music ! Recommend going with friends to watch the game or just to hang out .",1,,
7,Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",71,259,941,5.0,8/13/2018,"LOVED this place!! I've been wanting to come here for a while since everyone I've spoken to from Harlem always raved about this place! I can honestly say I was not disappointed! We made reservations for Saturday evening and we were seated promptly by the window which I liked. Our hostess was very nice along with the staff. I ordered the ""Shrimp and Grits"" entree and my homegirl ordered the ""Lobster Ravioli"". As an appetizer, we ordered the ""Kale salad with crab cakes and shrimp"". We were both please with BOTH of our dishes as they were very good!!!! The drinks that we ordered were also very well made also. Since it was a Saturday evening, there was a DJ playing 90's hip-hop and R&B which had us JAMMING while we ate!!! This made the environment a lot of fun and enjoyable. Last but not least -our waitress ""Aundra""!!!? Was AMAZING!!!!! You would've thought we known her forever-she was SUPER PERSONABLE, accommodating, gave us options for food and drink choices-just overall a GREAT PERSONALITY!! If I was going to give this place 4 stars, ""Aundra"" easily took this place to 5+ stars due to her attentiveness! Overall, I was very pleased with my visit and will definitely be coming back (with more friends!!) for food and drinks!",1,,1
8,Yasmin A.,"New York, NY",204,169,309,5.0,8/25/2018,Came here for brunch with a friend. First time coming here during the day. Just as poppin as it is at night. Make reservations otherwise there is normally a good 30 minute wait. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. Mixed crowd of younger and older.The menu selection had so many good options I didn't know what to pick! I ended up getting a mimosa and the chicken and waffles. Mimosa had just the right combo of OJ and champagne. The waffles were fluffy and the chicken was crispy and battered just enough. The fruit nectar that it came with was the cherry on top! So delicious!Our server was great and friendly. I'll be returning to try all the other great menu options!,,,
9,Shivon R.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",4,69,127,4.0,10/1/2018,"This is a great after work, Happy Hour spot. It was very lively and entertaining with music playing. The music can be a bit loud if you trying to have conversation during the happy hour timeframe of 4-8pm. I came here before and it still remains consistently the same in terms of service, food and entertainment. One of the staplesIn Harlem when you wanna come get a drink with friends.",1,,

12,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",356,80,43,3.0,9/18/2018,"Came here for brunch after Red Rooster and Sylvia's lines were too long.  I was pretty disappointed because the service was slow, the food was expensive and nothing special, and the portions were small. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and it wasn't even legit chicken and waffles; he got a few pieces of chicken that were lightly battered. My other friend who ordered the crab cakes was still hungry after he finished the dish because it was really small. I ordered the shrimp and grits which were delicious! The portion was perfect for me, but I have a really small appetite so that's not saying much. If you are in the area, you should try Sylvia's across the street for some legit chicken and waffles!",,,
13,Matthew S.,"Austin, TX",101,33,15,5.0,10/25/2018,"Loved it! Even though we were sitting outside (gotta love sidewalk cafes in NYC) in the sweltering heat, it was worth it. great food, great location, and fantastic ambience.Will defo be back next time i'm in NY",,,1
14,Chloe O.,"Silver Spring, MD",78,74,411,4.0,4/15/2018,"If you haven't been here you should at least try it once! My cousin and I both went with the shrimp and grits. I asked for no sausage with mine, and they were able to accommodate me on that. The presentation was great and the flavors were on point. I loved their brunch menu options and the fact that their prices were very reasonable. I really enjoyed my drink - I wish remember what it was called. It was sweet, but not too sweet. I posted a photo, the bartender will likely be able to identify it. This place seemed pretty popular, I would say that you need to come before the rush. We lucked out on the wait. Because there was a table available right when I walked in, I didn't experience the long wait time that I anticipated I would. The vibes were nice in there. When we went, it was on a Sunday. I didn't notice a live DJ and the music wasn't as loud as some other reviews made it seem. Maybe the DJ is only there on Saturday's?The service was ok. Because it was packed in there, our waitress was busy. Definitely understandable.",7,3,2
15,Teniqua K.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,54,145,3.0,8/29/2018,"I visited this location with a few friends from out of town on a Sunday evening around 10pm 8/26/18 after visiting another Harlem spot. Upon arrival the security was welcoming and it was a smooth process getting inside. The Hostess was hospitable and very energetic. I loved the DJ he was playing hit after hit all night and he is also a great Hype man. We were told we can come right in...in which we did. We decided to sit at a table since the bar area was crowded. Not even standing space.  Okay once we sat our waitress who I now know to be Aundra (not because she introduced herself but due to the receipt at the end of the night) approached not to enthusiastic at all.  It makes you wonder why people chose this line of work when they seem annoyed when a person wants to place an order. My 2nd issue was the drinks- No Bueno! The Bartenders need to go take some mixology classes. I ordered an Uptown tea which had too much bitter. I had also ordered a White Sangria i had to send back in exchange for the Red Sangria which was no better- I could not even drink it. The friends I was with each ordered a Crown with coke and as they all sipped their drink their facial expressions changed and they all said it was not Crown in their glasses. The waitress stated it was Crown Blah, Blah, Blah she also went as far as showing us the bottle. *(I can show you a bottle.  That does not mean what suppose to be in it is in there.) The bottle had enough liquid in it JUST covering the  bottom. But the crazy folks I was with decided to order another round without the coke. They said ""maybe it was the soda they used."" Once their drinks arrived the waitress made an announcement of ""this is it for the Crown"". *People....how did they even get 3 glasses out of what was left in that bottle is beyond me. Again expressions changed. My friends was 100% sure they was drinking some cheap Whiskey rather than Crown Royal. We closed the bill which was $143 & change (gratuity included). Then one person in my party decided they wanted to eat before we went home so we decided to ordered some wings and some bottled beers. The waitress looked a little annoyed when we closed out that bill then ordered something else.  She was asked by a member of my party (visiting from Augusta) was everything okay and he apologize for asking about the Crown Royal. She replied she was fine and this is how she is all the time. She faked smiled and went back to her regular.  It wasn't about her smiling it was the behavior. Ignoring the patrons and the negative body language.We had the buffalo and barbecue wings and they was very good.  Overall it was a good experience. But when you visit a place you want your experience to be a great one. You can let a few bad drinks go but the personnel getting paid to enhance your experience need to be on point.",,,
16,Keke R.,"Addisleigh Park, NY",136,69,176,5.0,10/8/2018,I just want to say that Corner social was amazing. I took my friend out for her birthday and we ending up at the corner social where they definitely gave us the VIP treatment. The food was good the waitress was friendly and the music was off the chain oh the drinks were amazing as well. love love love this spot in Harlem plus the prices were great. I will definitely come back here,1,,1
17,Yaa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",199,97,232,3.0,7/9/2018,"I love, love Corner Social as a gathering spot. The DJs are normally pretty good and the ambiance is welcoming. The food, however, is not that exciting and is terribly inconsistent. One day it tastes fairly good, the next not so much. In other words, I would go to party and hang but not to eat.",5,1,1
18,Chanelle H.,"Hamden, CT",14,49,58,4.0,9/26/2018,"This is a Harlem staple. Good for brunch, drinks after work, Friday nights. The vibe is always good. The food is decent, I've had the crab cake and shrimp salad which is a 8/10. The truffle fries are quite good as well. I've also gotten the avocado toast which is delicious! The drinks are strong and good.  The service seems to be lacking when I go there. Always having to call for a server, never having your glass full. Other than that solid experience.",1,,
19,Robin T.,"New York, NY",287,306,640,5.0,6/14/2018,"I've loved corner social since I worked nearby in Harlem years ago. It was a favorite neighborhood spot that me and coworkers would visit for after work drinks, and sometimes celebratory dinners. I think with the ever changing (aka gentrifying) of Harlem, corner social has definitely become a more popular spot but I'm really glad that I can still stop in and see patrons who look like me having a great time. They have great drinks and prices are regular for Harlem, but def stop by during happy hour for some discounts. The food here is also pretty good. I've had wings and burgers and salmon and a few other things and have never been disappointed. The portions are super filling so you don't have to worry about being hungry afterwards. I haven't come on the weekend during brunch hours yet but I can definitely say the after work/ dinner vibe at corner social is amazing.",3,,2

21,Priscilla S.,"Bronx, NY",251,28,61,1.0,9/13/2018,"Decided to meet up for drinks at Corner Social with two of my close friends. Ambiance: We visited on a Monday, it was raining but it was still pretty lively in there. I'll start with the good because it wasn't all bad. I really enjoyed the atmosphere & music. It's pretty dark in there depending on where you're sitting, definitely not pitch black but be aware. There was a DJ which I thought gave a nice touch, he was mostly playing Afro beats. Food/Drinks: We ordered red & white sangria from their HH menu. The sangria was okay, the fruit is added at the very end which sucks because you don't get those pieces of fruit that are filled with alcohol. I ordered another drink which was pretty much a Hennessy mojito, I cant remember the name but it was soooo goood! We ordered nachos from the bar menu & they were pretty good, I can't complain. The menu was very limiting in my opinion, it was difficult to decide what we were going to order. At one point we were going to get food elsewhere but decided to just work with what we had because of the rain. My friend & I ordered buffalo wings with sweet potato fries. The wings were okay, good flavor all around. The fries were really really good, flavorful throughout & crispy. Our other friend ordered calamari with sweet potato fries as well, which appeared to be pretty good. When we were done with the wings we both started to feel ill. Theres absolutely no reason why I'm paying for food that makes me sick, NEVER AGAIN. My friend who ate the calamari was fine. Service: Our server wasn't really on us, she would stop by occasionally but we would actively have to ask for her or try to make eye contact with her. Overall, I won't be returning unless I need a Hennessy mojito LOL",1,,
22,Karen W.,"Manhattan, NY",229,67,11,3.0,9/17/2018,"This place is a solid go-to for a party night. If you're looking to talk to a friend or a date, skip it. The music and people are VERY loud.The food is pretty good and reasonably priced. You can have an appetizer and feel fairly full, and it'll be not super greasy. Nothing is GREAT, but it's all serviceable. Burgers are yummy, and I'd recommend those. Beer list is okay.Service can be a bit slow depending on what time you go.",,1,
23,Jefe D.,"Weehawken, NJ",210,129,100,5.0,9/19/2018,"Came here on a Monday afternoon and it was great! Met up with a friend and had some wings and beers. The bartender was very personable and funny. The layout is very nice, they have outdoor seating with views of the street. The wings were really good and hoping to come back and try more of the food and cocktails next time. Definitely would recommend this place if you are in Harlem!",,,
24,Holly S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",110,160,116,4.0,11/7/2017,"Yes it's very crowded and loud during brunch but as long as you're cool with that, this is a good place for brunch. They don't take reservations on weekends but you can call ahead and put your name in over the phone.We had a party of four for brunch. Calling ahead helped us save on wait time at the restaurant, but we still ended up waiting a bit when we arrived. It seemed best to grab a drink at the bar while we were waiting which helped pass the time.I thought brunch entree prices seemed a little high until I found out they include one drink... you can choose from a mimosa, bloody Mary, or beer and that definitely makes it worthwhile. A friend and I split the shrimp and grits and the chicken and waffles. I thought both were really flavorful and the portions sizes were good too.",3,,
25,Em L.,"Elmont, NY",2,18,0,2.0,11/13/2018,"So I called this establishment to make an 8:30pm reservation to celebrate my birthday last night (November 12th), spoke to the night manager Paul and informed him that a party of about 20 people would be coming, that we'd be eating and drinking and requested the large booth in the rear of the restaurant near the bar for seating and to convene. He ensured me that the rezzie was made and even gave his name in case I needed something. Imagine my surprise when I arrive and I have no reservation. Not only do I not have a reservation but Paul is conveniently on a ""conference"". Must've been an important conference to be taking place so late in the evening *insert sideye*. Fortunately, the area I requested was open and they tell me that half my party needs to be present, which they were. I didn't get offered anything for the inconvenience. I'm a pretty easy-going person and I've been here before and had good service. I enjoy the vibe, my party had a good time and our waiter was attentive - which is why I'm giving them 2 stars). But they need a serious lesson in efficiency and customer service.",,,
26,Durval M.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,14,12,4.0,5/8/2018,One of my favorite places in all of city. Very diverse crowd in the forever changing Harlem. The food is always tasty and the drinks are always on point.Highly recommend stopping by for their happy hour in which well cocktails are only $5. Bartenders do a great job of making those happy hour special drinks taste like top shelf.,1,,
27,Denise A.,"Greenwich, CT",31,13,6,4.0,9/15/2018,Food is pretty good and came pretty fast.  I would recommend the chicken and waffles that my husband ate and the classic breakfast I had was good.,,,
28,Brit H.,"Philadelphia, PA",32,49,145,4.0,4/14/2018,"I really liked the vibe here. Went here for a wedding brunch (a Saturday morning) last summer. The place was packed but our food came out fast. Our server was great too. No mess ups on our orders. The grilled toast was my favorite because I love bread! I ordered the crab cake and eggs. It's was cool, not nasty or anything. Some of us had the bottles drink. They were definitely bottomless! I will definitely go back, the dj had it really lit in there.",1,,

30,Caitlin D.,"Bronx, NY",2,15,15,5.0,8/25/2018,"Mark. Sweet sweet mark. He made this entire experience amazing! Me and my fiancé came here originally planning to enjoy maybe an app and some beers. But literally got blown away by how great our server was. He is so humorous, comfortable, and efficient. I mean yeah the food was good, not completely wow-able, but it was solid food and definitely the truffle fries were 5 star. I work in the service industry and if every server had Marks enthusiasm and conversation skills they would stay at their tables for hours like we did. All in all. Go to corner social, ask for Mark, and if he's not there leave until you get to be in his section! Such a great night, and he's even better at making sure you're happy at youre  table the WHOLE time!

32,Carli W.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,18,2,3.0,10/14/2018,I give this place 3 stars only for the great DJ and very friendly bartenders. I have come here many many times but have now decided I will not return to this establishment. The bouncers/security at the front door are extremely disrespectful and belittle the patrons. This has happened every time I've come to this bar and after this last time I'm just over it. Nobody deserves to be treated this way and it's clear that this behavior is fueled simply by their need to be in control and boosting their own egos. I would recommend corner social re-evaluate who's running the front door because they will lose you lots of business and treating people this way is inhumane. I over heard multiple conversations last time I was there complaining about how disrespectful the bouncers were. This is absolutely NOT okay.,,,
33,Kayla F.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",266,56,10,3.0,9/27/2018,"Every time I come to Corner Social, I have high expectations for a good brunch and leave feeling like I had just an okay experience. It isn't bad but it just doesn't compare to other brunch experiences in Harlem. The restuarant is cute but the food is only so-so.",1,,
34,Kelsey N.,"Katonah, NY",147,1,0,2.0,10/21/2018,"Super mediocre food for the price. I got the wild mushroom grilled cheese, and for 18 dollars I would expect it to be loaded with cheese, but it was really lacking.

35,Ed W.,"Manhattan, NY",177,354,19,4.0,1/17/2018,"This is a great place.  I came here on my birthday and had a really great time.I ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was cooked well.  It wasn't overdone and rubbery the way it so often is at other places.  For dinner, I went with the smothered pork chops and grits.  They were amazing.  The dish had two large pork chops and a really tasty brown gravy.  My one wish was for more grits on the plate; they were so good.I got a slice of tres leeches cake for dessert and it was possibly the best I've ever had anywhere.Our server was really nice, but she seemed to have a lot of tables so we didn't see her very much.The atmosphere is fun.  There is a DJ, but it never go too loud.I plan to come back again for drinks and dinner.  I really enjoyed it here.",3,2,2
36,Andrew P.,"Mitchellville, MD",292,327,490,3.0,7/31/2017,"After happy hour we decided to come here for food.  There was plenty of outdoor seating, and we wanted to take advantage.  We asked for outdoor seating, and we ended up waiting about 15 minutes.  When we were signaled to go to a table, they led us to a table inside.  They acknowledged we wanted to sit outside, but there was a miscommunication somewhere. So we had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to sit outside, despite seeing people who were there after us get seated before us... so that was disappointing.  We also saw some folks get kicked out while we were waiting... I think they almost caused a big scene.Once we were finally seated, it was getting really busy.  I ended up eating the empanadas and the shrimp mushroom spinach mac and cheese. I inquired about what price a long island would be, and the server said $12-$14... for NY, that's what I expected, and I agreed to it.  Unfortunately, it ended up being $17 and he didn't tell me the actual price before giving me the drink, so I really couldn't change my mind even if I wanted to.  Despite my total check being up there, I did enjoy everything.  I was also full enough where I could take half of the mac and cheese home, so I was satisfied.",1,2,

38,Brittni D.,"New York, NY",341,65,129,4.0,1/17/2018,I went during lunch time and it was pretty empty. I are the shrimp and grits - it was so tasty. This is definitely a re-order. I've had issues with with hostess in the past being extremely rude but my experience today was great. My only feedback would be to be more efficient with getting people their check after they eat. Took half hour to get the check.,1,,
39,Johanna R.,"Manhattan, NY",54,65,38,4.0,9/3/2018,"Okay so three star sucks but im going to have to keep it a hundred. The host that sits people down is sooooo sweet .. like he is always smiling and he is very freaking pleasant. He is the definition of great customer service and i hope he gets paid well and that he gets tips as well. He is the young man who sits you at your table and i think he takes orders for your server as well. Kudos to him. This place is always crowded so service here takes a long time. I think all the servers seem nice I just think that they neglect their tables for far too long. But their mac and cheese with bacon init is the bombbbbbbb. The calamari which i dont eat is actually not bad it comes with avocado sauce which is also good. If your a beer person , theres beer here . Their drinks ? Hmmmm I dont know I think I like them better for their beer than their mix drinks. The vibe is good is open for everything. The music you can barely here it , i think theres more conversation about housing deprivation than actual good music lol.  I started this review with three stars but i ended it with four because good customer service is important for me and for any establishment to have. Its soo hard finding people who like waitressing and when you got a good team, thats shit nobody can top!!! Ummm for my latinos that like to sip and dance and vibe to good music you wont find that here. But you will eat good, have good beer, and talk about things that is effecting our environments and current financial status ! Ok and thats important too !",2,,
40,Chrissy B.,"Queens, NY",16,113,189,4.0,7/10/2018,"My colleagues recommended this place for happy hour and I must say I enjoyed it. The price is a bit up there; they charge $16 for nachos and if you want meat on them it's an extra $8-10. The platter is good for about 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good. They have a fairly decent happy hour; alcoholic mixtures and beers are $5, wines are $6. If I'm in the area I'll come again but just be mindful of you're a party of 5 or more you may have a wait unless you make a reservation. I guess we got lucky because we were a party of 7 and was able to get seated without waiting. Just be mindful that they can only accept up to 4 cards for larger parties.",,,
41,Maly M.,"Teaneck, NJ",3,41,3,5.0,7/18/2018,Had their pasta special of the day: salmon with asparagus and fresh tomato. It was really good! My friend also enjoyed her crab cake dish. The service was nice. Good place to happy hour!,,,
42,Chelsea W.,"Manhattan, NY",7,27,10,1.0,4/29/2018,"This review comes after visiting Corner Social several times over two years. This place is mediocre at best. Food, drinks and service all around can be better. This spot doesn't really know what it wants to be. Sometimes it's a trap club sometimes it's a restaurant... mostly I am confused. I was once turned away from the door because I was wearing a hat. I'm a girl wearing a hat to dinner and was turned away by a bouncer. WTF? No I am not taking it off. Sometimes it looks like a club and people are literally dancing over people as they are eating dinner. They have not successfully pulled off the duality of Restaurant/club like Red Rooster has.  I've witnessed fights at the bar. Hot mess. Yesterday day I had one drink at the bar and an appetizer. The sangria was literally sugar water and the Ceviche was soggy.",5,3,

44,Annette B.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,1,1,1.0,9/28/2018,"Came to corner social for a quick bite, I'm actually here as I write this review. I usually don't leave comments but this time Seem their service has been spiraling down in a complete decline and that is unacceptable. My waitress (Abril) took over 20min to notice I was seated, then after I revived my food never checked back, the nachos I ordered were a bit dry so I badly needed Pico de Gallo, she was nowhere around. When I finally saw her, I requested the pico de Gallo, easy right? Apparently not. Abril (April) never returned, after I was finished eating, she then sow up apologetic, asked if she can offer some bread, she then sends dry bread to the table. I'm beginning to hate this place.",,,
45,Beenish H.,"Brooklyn, NY",496,259,703,4.0,10/11/2017,"This was an impromptu pop in after Red Rooster across the street. My first time here and friend seems to be a regular. We carried on with our Tuesday night shenanigans with drinks and food. I ordered champagne since I was in a celebratory mood after getting my Elite badge ;) and my friend a dark and stormy which he approved of highly. I mean who even orders those anymore, amiright guys? I'm more of an old fashion kinda girl, get it? Good.Moving on, we or maybe just I ordered the lamb chops to stay and the seafood stew to go. I know, I know, maybe I was being a little greedy but what if I got the munchies later (which I did fyi :) . Anyway, the main included four grilled chops accompanied by garlic spinach, mango salsa and balsamic glaze. I devoured this dish right down to the bone, no kidding. Sometimes I have no shame, don't judge. Lol. The seafood stew included salmon, calamari, shrimp, white wine, tomatoes, herb sauce and garlic crostinos. Another legit dish even though it was a bit on the bland side and the stew could've been thicker for my tastes. All in all, service at the bar was attentive, friendly and on point. There was a live DJ rolling old school jams, think 80s and 90s hip-hop and R&B. Live DJ was a pleasant surprise for a Tuesday night. Crowd was representing in numbers and friendliness. I'd definitely come back to this joint if in the neighborhood.",3,,2
46,Vashti S.,"Bronx, NY",38,2,0,2.0,9/20/2018,"Food and drinks are usually pretty good, but unfortunately the service has dwindled. Last FEW times I've been there, it's like your asking a favor just to take your order, get exactly what you asked for, and to even get the bill. The manager on duty last time I was there, didn't seem as though he cared to see if customers were being taken care of. I also must add that it was a Monday night, not busy, and there appeared to be enough staff. I noticed three people came in and was seated, they waited sooo long for someone to even come to them that they left. Another couple was there, in which no one came to them either, so the guy got up to get their own menus from the hostess up front. They should consider hiring more attentive staff because I do enjoy the food, drink, and music, and this is disappointing to say the least. :(",,,

It was just an ok burger, however, the customer service was excellent. I'll probably visit again and order their famous nachos.",,,

There was music but you can still talk comfortably and the lights are dimmed low. The food was pretty good, nothing AMAZING but simply good. I got the lobster ravioli which was great, it was a good amount to satisfy you not fill you up. My friend got the shrimp and pasta. That was good. Now the drinks were AMAZING! Strong Manhattan, perfect apple martini. It's in the neighborhood so I'll be back.",3,1,2

I decided to come here for dinner with an out of town guest and was refused entry on a Saturday night. My friend was wearing a hoodie and I was wearing a hat. I didn't know that there was a dress code for this place nor could I find the door policy online. So that was minus one star.Also, don't do the shrimp and grits. The grits are bland, tasteless and under seasoned. Now, I know they know how to season their food because I've had several things on the menu and it's usually delicious (lobster ravioli was so good!). When my server brought my food and I asked for salt, she asked if my food was okay. I told her it was fine but the grits were a little bland and under seasoned. She told the chef and the message that was relayed to me from the chef was ""we don't over salt our food here."" I found that a bit rude. So minus one star.",1,,

Luckily, it wasn't as horrible as I anticipated.I got the chicken and waffles, which were surprisingly good.  The chicken had way more flavor than I anticipated and wasn't dry.  Waffles were eh.  The fruit was also eh.  It was $16 for the plate, but it included a free drink.  You could choose from orange juice, a mimosa, or bloody Mary.  Don't get excited about the free drink.  They barely put any alcohol in it.  You're basically drinking orange or tomato juice.",3,2,1

Laziness? Absolutely. Not sure why he thinks that's ok considering people EAT at the bar. It's absolutely unsanitary and I'm just not sure why he thinks it's ok. Aren't managers supposed to set an example?I'm disgusted and won't be back.,3,,

Only issue I saw was only one working restroom with literally one stall so there was a line pretty much the entire time I was there.  I ate here once a long time ago and the food was good then.  I'll have to return to try the food again sometime in the near future.  I'd return for late night drinks and good music.,,,

If you are looking for good food or good service then this place is not for you; especially on a Saturday night. There is a cover charger to get in and when you do get in its impossible to move around. So much is spilled on the floor that it becomes so sticky that it makes you a little squimish thinking about what you could be stepping in. Where closed shoes  and this will relieve some of the fear of the unknown. If you are looking for a place that you don't have to be dressed from head to toe that has good music, this is a stop to consider. The music is really good, but note there is not much space for dancing.",1,,1

We were seated almost immediately on a Sunday which I found great. I ordered the crab cake and a drink, my daughter had the fried chicken and waffles. I loved my food however my drink was nasty. My daughter's waffle was great however the chicken was salty and her side of potatoes were flavorless and dry. Inaddition we ordered some bread we loved the last time and they were burned this time.

The brunch vibe has reasonable prices, good food, decent drinks and a friendly staff. I came Saturday at 1 pm and was able to be seated right away. The night time vibe has good dance music and a poppin crowd. There are a lot of attractive people(girls and guys) every time I come. I think after 11 or 12 on the weekends they charge guys $10. Girls are still free tho. The dance space at night is tight cause they do have tables but it's def a good little move if you want to drink, dance & be merry",,,

We ordered Chicken & waffles and the original breakfast (something like that)...it was extremely ordinary and mediocre. My waffles tasted like they were cooked by a 12 year old. Edible but just not appetizing. It was raw in the center and probably sat under the heating lamp for a good 20mins before making it to the table. Her food was even more basic than mine. Separating my meager chicken from my under cooked waffles was an island of canned fruit that I dare not touch. The waiter exacerbated the experience by being inattentive and uninterested.  We won't be back for food. Beer selection is decent though!,,1,

65,Monique M.,"Queens, NY",197,218,837,5.0,6/19/2017,"Visited this trendy spot for a birthday brunch + Meetup event. Although it was pouring outside, the place had a packed crowd. My friend and I sat at the bar waiting for our party to arrive while the DJ  put on some classic hip hop and R&B. Once our party was complete, we sat down in a spacious booth in the far corner of the bar. The space otherwise is fairly big and decorated with a pub bar/trendy feel. The staff are very fun, down to earth, and kind. We had no issues and honestly, what I appreciated most about them is their honesty. They let us know if something would cost more, if they had to add something to the bill, maximum seating time etc. There was no sugar coating or surprises and we were informed kindly, nothing rude about it. We started the table off with tasty mimosas and rum punch. All of which were good. The best thing about this place is the food. Like forget the drinks and whatever else, it's the food and the music that really made my experience. The waitress provided us with complementary bread which I think was some type of grilled garlic bread, it was ok. For the entree, I had the 'chicken and waffles' entree which came with a side of fruit cocktail. I have been searching for the perfect Chicken and Waffles in Harlem for almost a year and I'm telling you that this place, it hit the spot! The dish itself was appealing. The chicken was moist with a crispy crust and flavorful seasoning. The waffles were fluffy and fresh. I died that day when that entree crossed my eyes. I'm also an avid lover of fruits, so when they threw that fruit cocktail in there...I wanted to shout out ""yes!"". It was that damn good lol. Among my friends, there was more chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, and even a kale salad...no complaints, all delicious. After all that, you know what was just as great? I received a mimosa with my meal! That's right! For $16, I received a chicken and waffles entree plus an alcoholic beverage *drops mic*. They don't even do that at Applebee's lol.Throughout the experience, the staff sang happy birthday to our friend and even stored a cake for us until we were ready (be prepared to pay a surcharge for outside food). The music was so good too! A nice mix of hip hop, R&B, reggae, soca, and some Afro beats. There is decent amount of space around the DJ booth to dance and socialize too. I cannot wait to return here, this place is worth it so hurry up and go!",2,1,1

I was on my way to a totally different restaurant when I was recommended this place by a person in Harlem. An awesome spot.Upside: The food was amazing. I never thought I would like bay leave fried chicken but the way they made it was so good. The chicken was so juicy. The waffles were very thick & tasty. And I can eat that fruit salad all day long. I enjoyed the cafe late. Tasted really good with the food.Downside: I thought the size of the 3 pieces of fried chicken & waffles were a bit small for the price. Surprisingly the waffles was very filling so it worked out. I didn't have a server come over to check to make sure everything was good but on the upside luckily everything was good. I considered the fact that it was a Sunday brunch & extremely busy but with that said, I had a late & wasn't even offered any water until I had to ask for it. At the end of the day - I still enjoyed the place & I would definitely come back. Even though the service was a bit slow, the staff were still nice & I do understand that weekends are extremely busy for restaurants so I can't genuinely hold that against them.

71,George L.,"Manhattan, NY",25,66,109,4.0,6/17/2017,"Came out for a quick lunch before getting started with some errands. Nothing special going on.Food: ordered the grilled platter (chicken, pork chop, steak, sliced tomato, and plantains) and as usual...it was good. Everything is cooked how I wanted and the flavors were on point. Highly recommended. Service: I sat at the bar and I wasn't drinking alcohol so the service was ok for the most part. As a low maintenance customer, I thought the bartender could have been a little more attentive but I wasn't all that bothered by it. Crowd/Atmosphere: one thing you can pretty much bank on is that the music will always be good. Can't remember a time when I was there and didn't find myself singing the words and tapping my feet to whatever was playing. As far as the people there, typical lunch time crowd. You had he guys at the bar talking smack and watching sports, the liquid lunchers debating going back to the office, and the out of work early groups.

Guess the experienced servers were given the holiday off because mine was not good. There was no wait, my friend an I was sat immediatly upon arrival after deciding where to eat. The server took a while to come to the table and when he finally did he came and asked how we were doing and we said fine and there was an awkward pause with him staring at us like he was waiting for us to order. I spoke up and said so Whats your name to break the awkwardness. He said his name was Dean. I then asked how he was doing (seeing he didn't know how be more inviting, lol) we then ordered our drinks. I did not want avion tequila but wanted a margarita, so I asked if he had don Julio blanco which he went to check and confirmed they had it. I ordered don Julio blanco. when he brought the drink he said they were out of don Julio so I ordered the avion. along with our food. the server never came back with my drink. some time had passed and the food comes out with another person and the server I then asked if he could just cancel the drink. This guy was no where near attentive. he never came back to check to see if I got my drink nor did he even mention me not getting my drink (that I really did not want in the first place) when he brought the food.

Updated review","Came back to Corner Social for dinner thinking it would be way better than brunch. Sadly, I was mistaken. The hostess told us the wait time was 45 minutes so we put our name on the list. We came back after 45 minutes and asked the hostess how much longer it would be. He said we were up next. After a little over an hour, we asked again. The hostess then got an attitude and said, ""you're tables being cleaned"" Sorry, I asked you to actually do your job and provide an update and seat me close to the estimated time - I guess that was asking for too much. After another 15 minutes we finally got seated at a table right next to the crowded bar where ppl crowded around our table and tried to use our table as place to put their drinks. So yeah, the customer service here is lacking. A shame because the food is pretty good but the overall experience is constantly unokeas",,,

It was ridiculous that they even brought that plate out to us, but they surely did. At that time, we waited so long and were all starving. I was aggravated. They offered to redo it, but we didn't feel like waiting another hour for burgers and fries.

83,Lauren W.,"New York, NY",85,60,28,1.0,10/9/2017,"If i could give a 0 i would. 1) there is nothing on the website that states that corner social doesn't take reservations Thursday- Sunday. I kept trying to make a reservation online and it wouldn't let me. I finally called and they said they don't take reservations on certain days. Ok fine, state that on your website.2) i called and they assured me that i can come in on Saturday  for a table of 4 easily at 6:30 pm because it doesn't start getting busy until 8. I arrived at 6:30 and it was packed.3) my father needed to park and the 3 of us stood outside. They said they couldn't seat us until the entire party was there. Fine, restaurant rules. After standing outside for 20 more mins they told us they'll seat us even though my dad was still looking for parking.4) they sit us by the bathroom. Music is ridiculously loud so the conversation at the table was limited.5) we were assigned a waitress in training along with another waitress. I asked what was the soup, she said she didn't know. Asked her basic questions, she didn't know. Ok....6) there was a woman waiting by the bathroom with her daughter. She was screaming at her child as if she was talking to an adult. She was screaming at the top of her lungs, cursing at her and the daughter was crying uncontrollably. It alarmed us so bad that once she took her into the bathroom, i stood by the door to make sure she wasn't harming her because this woman literally was screaming at that baby like was about to fight one of her homegirls. Im all for discipline but it seemed more like verbal abuse.7) i hated the vibe so i asked the waitress to cancel our order cause i'm leaving. I got my bags and left.Note to CS- be aware of what is going on in your restaurant. You had no idea there was a woman screaming to the top of her lungs because the music volume was too high and it was busy/packed. Also, teach your waitresses the menu. I shouldn't know more than them.",1,2,1

85,Latoya W.,"Bronx, NY",241,159,410,3.0,8/22/2016,"Came in for happy hour drinks. The offered well drinks,  wine, sangria and beer. For fairly reasonable  price. They also had a special on a bottle  of moet. I believe it was 40 bucks don't quote me on that. It was a cool night out so we opted to sit outside which was great since it was nice out but the flies were all over the place. There were way to many I hope their is something they could do about that.Me and my friend shared vegetarian nachos  which were really good. It was definitely  enough for two people to share  maybe even a third person. I got the red sangria which was watered down on my perspective  so I changed to red wine. Happy hour is until 8pm.",1,1,2
86,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,120,201,3.0,10/23/2017,"I came here for a brunch on Sunday. This place has a very welcoming & spacious set-up.I want to start off by saying that our waiter Angel was excellent during our brunch. Very professional & attentive to anything we needed when we asked him.The food is reasonably priced,just about what you expect for a bottomless brunch. The brunch entree comes with either a mimosa,Bloody Mary,or beer. I had the Bloody Mary which was very spicy(exactly how I like mine). Then for an additional $15 you can have bottomless mimosas for 1.5 hours. What I didn't like about it was the timing of this place. We had a group of about 12. But when we got there,it took a a while before we received water and when we said we wanted to do bottomless it took another almost 15-20min before they even brought out our first drinks. If the place was packed I wouldn't have mind but the place was pretty empty and still seemed like everything was taking forever.But other than that,the food was good,the mimosas were good & strong,and I liked the set-up of this place.",1,,

91,Janet E.,"Bedford Park, Bronx, NY",119,7,5,3.0,8/30/2018,"My husband and i went to Corner Social in June with some friends for his birthday. The mood was set right. It was very crowded which means business is good. The music was good but it took some time to get a drink. The food also took some time to arrive at the table but it was good. The worst part about the night was a tall female hostess who appeared to not like her job and assumed everyone was drunk so she would come out to clients with a nasty attitude. She was unprofessional and spoke to some clients including myself and my husband as if we were stupid when we asked how long was the wait. Very uncalled for. The hostess sets the mood up for the night until she seats you however she set a bad mood for the night. We had to approach her three to four times to ask her simple questions and we were not even drunk. Her responses weren't something i would smile and be thankful for. I unfortunately was unable to speak with the manager since my husband was trying to convince me to ignore it but months later i feel that this review is due. We plan to return however I'm hoping if the same hostess is there, that she learns to love her job and not be such a grouch about it. People who lack customer service skills can ruin the flow of business.",,,

She didn't acknowledge us at all the only time she came to the table was to take the check. She was terrible!!! If you go there don't ask for Eileen. Meanwhile, her co-worker talked with us and even checked in on us behind her. Definitely wish we would have had her, our experience would have been MUCH better.

My friends and I jumped up from our table when we heard Rihanna (don't judge me while you read this review, yes you! Other people started dancing over their lobster ravioli as well).

The cerviche not so much but only because its really tart. The staff can be hit or miss sometimes but I still always enjoy myself thoroughly whenever I come. Everyone I bring there with me has a good time. The djs are always dope and its just good to see young, professional, brown folks enjoying Harlem dispite all the rage against gentrification. The saying ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"" comes to mind when I think about Corner Social. Its old and new Harlem all wrapped into one... iLove it.P.s. though... 1 bathroom is unacceptable. Somethings gotta give with that. Isnt that ahazard or something?  #QTNA",,,

Our waiter Zachary was excellent very helpful with menu our table wobbled Zac took care of it right away. We had the Calamari for the table.   I had the Salmon which came with Mash Potato and String Beans, Zac told us about a Special Drink called "" The Carde B""  he even did a dance when walking back to the table with the drinks which were really good.

Starting with the chicken and waffle, the waffle was entirely waaaaaay too sweet and dry but adding syrup was not an option unless all you want is sugar. The chicken and as too dry which didn't compliment the already overly sweet dry waffle. The mimosa is $10/glass but pitcher is $25 so we opted for the pitcher. The mimosa was pretty basic and mostly concentrated orange juice.  The chicken and waffle was served with a cup of fruit which was very refreshing. Overall I give them a 2 because of the service, great service (we had Starbucks and they allowed us to finish it in the store) and accommodating and the waitress/hostess were nice.

101,Molly P.,"New York, NY",4,39,9,1.0,4/22/2018,"I came here for brunch and was disappointed in both the food and drinks. There is no bottomless option, but you can order a mimosa/sangria pitcher for $25 or Bicardi rum punch pitcher for $35. It was 3 of us so we split a rum punch pitcher. It was straight juice. If there was any bicardi in there it was a veryyyy small amount. We all ordered chicken & waffles and the plate consisted of one tiny waffle, 3 chicken wings, and a cup of (previously frozen) fruit. I've ordered chicken and waffles from so many places and I've never been served 3 tiny grilled wings that you can buy from a sports bar on dollar wing night. Overall we spent $90+ tax and tip for the food and drinks and I personally feel ripped off. It's not hard to fry up some decent sized chicken.. advice to this restaurant, stop being cheap and trying to cut corners because you're not going to retain customers.",,,

Like a month ago I went there try to grub a fast meal close by my apt and when I went at the door the security guy told me that  I needed to wait for 3 hours to have a table(and I was like wtf is that seriously) so I took few minutes and I went inside to see if I could order a pick up. so once I got in I saw few empty table and I asked if I could have dinner there and the hostess told me yes(like I wasn't supposed to have 3 hours to wait). Since that day I didn't wanna go back but Friday night I was feeling lazy and I went back there.The dinner side wasn't so busy and after i seated I needed to wait 25 minutes for the waiters to come to my table and she came at me only because I was leaving the place.

104,Opiniated N.,"Yonkers, NY",1,8,0,1.0,1/15/2018,"I have never seen a more disappointing display of customer service. I believe this manager's name was Nino.I visited this bar on Saturday night with a girlfriend. We were seated at the bar around 9:45 and we each ordered 1 cocktail. At exactly 10:02 pm, a young man walks up to us and says that since we were not eating food he would have to take our seats. I was a bit surprised, we had just traveled pretty far and it was freezing out so we weren't ready to stand up yet, our toes had barely thawed out. I said that we would order some plates and asked for a menu. The bartender comes over and says he wouldn't be able to place our order and quickly calls the manager over.The manager was overtly rude and short with us. We said we didn't want an issue, but we had just gotten settled and just wanted a chance to finish our drinks so we had no problem with ordering food.He then said ""if you haven't ordered your food yet then you can't get it now"". At this point we were very confused because the kitchen was still open. I said to him, ""that's fine we will finish our drinks and be on our way"" He says to us ""do whatever you want but we're still going to take your chairs now"" Not ""sorry for the confusion, finish your cocktail then please give up your seats'Not ""ok this is the way we do it here, now you know for next time, I'll allow you to place an order""Just flat out no, and we're taking your seats.Then his employee literally stands there and waits for us to get up and grabs the chairs right from us.As if that wasn't embarrassing enough, Nino, an actual manager, begins to have a side convo with a customer next to us about how he ""doesn't like haters and has no time for people who don't know the rules"" I'm sure Nino feels as though his ""affluent"" position as Manager of Corner Social provides him with the right to be overly obnoxious and rude, but basic common courtesy and respect never goes out of style.Their central location assures that regardless of how they treat their patrons, they'll probably always have a crowd so he may assume that we are easily replaceable.I'm hoping that they provide Nino with some additional training and education as to how he could better resolve customer service issues.",2,,

So this is my 2nd or 3rd time coming here.  When I visit NY, I some times make my way to Harlem to enjoy the summertime atmosphere, vibe and food at the Corner Social.  My last couple of times here have a been a GOOD experience, so I am not going to rate them low because of THIS occurrence.Tonight my girlfriend and I came here just to get dessert!  The hostess was lovely and seated us right away at a nice table.  The view was great, the music was good and people were sexy.  Our waitress however, was just beyond sub-par.  My girlfriend ordered a drink. She asked for it to be in a chilled glass.  That seemed to confuse the waitress and so she explained to her how that can be done.  If you are a bartender, then you will know how to make that happen.  I ordered the Brownie A La Mode, which was heavenly.  However, once the waitress brought us our treats, she NEVER came back again to check on us.  I had to get her attention to order another brownie dessert.  When they cleared my previous plate, they took my spoons with them.  So, I was brought a new dessert with no dessert spoon.  Not a problem.  I could just never get my waitresses attention to even ask for a new spoon.  After waiting and waiting and our waitress walking back and forth nearby, but never looking our way to get her attention, I finally had to ask the Hostess who then brought me back a spoon.  After that, the waitress came over and checked on us.  By then we were fine.  Now the place had a nice crowd but it wasn't packed as I have seen it on previous occasions. Finally, I got the waitresses attention to get the check.  I watched this woman, not only go take orders at other tables, but also SERVE them BEFORE she came back with our check.  I waited so long for the check, which was only 2 brownies and a drink, that I went back to the Hostess and told her my dissatisfaction with our waitress and she offered to get the check.  As soon as I sat back down, the waitress came and handed me the check without even looking at me.  I will say, I normally tip well.  However, I will not give 20% to someone who is doing less than 10% service, though she did get at least that.  I also wrote on my receipt that I was 'very disappointed with the service.  very inattentive.""Again, I have been to Corner Social before and have enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, but this time, my service totally sucked!",1,,1
108,Adalberto M.,"Miami, FL",639,356,234,1.0,11/20/2016,"Traveled all the way to Harlem for some good soul food but opted instead for this place that looked interesting.On a Saturday afternoon the weather was nice so we sat outside to review the menu. To our surprise, and disappointment only the brunch menu was being offered, yet we found so many interesting photos on yelp that we could not experience. Oh well, on with it. Both brunch main items we ordered came with an included bloody mary, draft beer or mimosa. The bloody mary was weak and not creative, served with very little extra stuff. Their lager tasted like bud light. Do you see where this is going? Main item 1 was ""waffles and wings"" - $16. 2 waffles cut in half (so there are four pieces) served with their ""famous"" wings. In between the two items there is a house salad in the middle. Honestly this was the weakest attempt at chicken and waffles i have ever seen. The wings were very much glazed in their sauce and it just didn't feel the items belonged together. What is up with the salad?? The only high note was the lobster ravioli- $19. Tastes very good but a tad expensive. Harlem is an up and coming town from what i hear but be forewarned there is lots of activity on the streets. What took away from this experience was the loud and constant demonstrations from people with microphones and speakers voicing their opinion. This is not the restaurant's fault but it's best to go inside if you don't feel like hearing it. I should have gone with my gut and go to Sylvia's or Red Rooster.",11,,4

Updated review","UPDATE: Corner social reached out to me and expressed regret about my experience. After meeting with management, It seems I was dealt with a grumpy bouncer. I look forward to giving it another shot soon, but do take notice that there is a no hat policy of Friday and Saturday.Having lived in Harlem for two years, I'd actually been to corner social for lunch and enjoyed myself. With that, my buddy and I decided to finally grab drinks there last night.Approaching the door at 10:30pm on Saturday night, I began to pull out my ID, but before I could even get off a hello, the bouncer interjected ""No hats allowed, you'll need to take off your hat!"" (I proceed to remove my Yankees cap and show it to be harmless)He continues, ""I don't even want to see you take it off. Go around the corner and put it in your buddy's bag!""Well, at this point my thirst is zapped and I'm quite honestly embarrassed. All this for a baseball cap??I walked around the corner, looked my friend in the eyes and said, I'm not giving this place my business. We walked right by the bouncer and went to Babbalucci's next door, hat on head....Seriously, CS- figure out a better way to convey your rules. Because banning baseball caps is unusual, but OK. What's not ok is verbally accosting a would-be customer. You lost my business.",2,1,1

Expensive!!!The burgers were dry, crumbly and tasteless. Neither my cousin or I enjoyed out lunch. We waited just over thirty minutes to receive our food. The waiter was pleasant and did his best. But I will never eat there again. There weren't more than twenty people there for lunch, when we went.I sent an email to their contact address, bit they've never acknowledged it.

115,Shea C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,12,2.0,7/31/2017,"This place isn't good even on a Monday night. This bi%#ch named Rebecca was my bartender and she wasn't nice. It's not crowded, so why the attitude and the wait?! And there's this bald head bartender with muscles and tats that only seems to wait on male patrons. I asked him for a drink, he said ok after taking my order then walked away and started doing something else. Like walked all the way away. I actually thought maybe he was playing a prank on me. It's fine if he's gay, but don't discriminate against the female customer. Avoid both of them at all cost. The crowd was meh! But guess what? Go there on the weekend and it's popping like fireworks baby. César is the best bartender ever and he's quick. The rest of them are ok except for the two I mentioned earlier. You just gotta hustle to get through the crowd at the bar and you'll get the best drink of your night. But on average I would say it's turning into a hood spot. There's better next door at cove.",,1,

The first time that we went here was on a Saturday night and the DJ was fantastic. The wait was around 45 minutes and we were seated at the table behind the DJ booth. I ordered bread for the table and the alfredo pasta with chicken, perfect! The bread was worth every penny, soft and as warm as ever. I ordered the Social Mint cocktail and it was mixed to perfection. Needless to say, the vibe was so amazing that we returned on Sunday night. This time around there was no wait and the DJ was playing all Caribbean music. I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables, again amazing. I would definitely recommend Corner Social and plan on returning here.",1,,1

And it was also about to rain! It was drizzling outside! I decided to just wait for my friend to close their tab and wait outside, afraid that I may get denied entry. I later learned that the bouncer was on edge because someone threatened to pull a gun on him! Anyways, I went back the next night and it was a much calmer crowd. The music was good. The service was good. And the food was okay as well. I had the raw oysters, mussels, and my friend had the lamb chops. Those were amazing! The drinks were kinda weak but still okay.

122,Raven J.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,8,0,1.0,7/26/2018,"I would not go here again. The food is subpar and for their prices, it should be anything but that. Drinks are okay, only thing worthwhile was the sangria. The waitress, a young AA women, with the high bun and hoop earrings- avoid her section at all costs. She looked bored and like she didn't want to be there. I'm not expecting my waitresses/waiters to be overly friendly to the point where your enthusiasm is coming off fake but don't approach our table looking worn and tired. A smile goes along way in the service industry. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay, she practically threw the bottle in the ice bucket. She only checked in on us twice during our 2 hour visit. And at the end of the visit, when we got our check it was well over $100. Both myself and my boyfriend weren't surprised, we are used to spending money but something made me pick up and examine that bill because an order of nachos , 2 Caesar salads and a bottle of Chardonnay shouldn't cost that much anywhere, especially in Harlem.We had someone else's full bill placed on to ours. So it looked like we were a table of 4 instead of 2. Maybe the waitress was tired as I mentioned above but you must be careful when dealing with peoples' money, especially when it takes more than 48 hours for some banking institutions to refund your money. Sad part about it was the fact that she wasn't really apologetic, she still came off uncaring about the whole situation. I wanted to ask to speak to the manager but my boyfriend said, let's not be ""those people"", whatever that means. It's a decent place but spend your money and time somewhere else. And always check your tab....ALWAYS CHECK YOUR TAB.",,,

125,Kaan T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",25,2,0,2.0,7/8/2018,"We just get out from the restaurant. I wanna write a review roght after we get out from restaurant. You can imagine how pissed we are. So first of all everthing is over cooked. My burger came out Medium instead of Medium Rare, and also i didnt want tomato in my burger because i am allergic. So i asked to manager what temperature is my burger, he said open it lets check. He checked on the table and said that it is an Medium Burger and i said i ordered Med Rare  with no tomato. He took the plate to the kitchen and come back in a second, told me that he will make new burger just because i am allergic, and also he said it was Med Rare not Medium. I got the new burger with no Tomato. New burger was Medium too but i didnt even bother and eat it. Calamari was rubbery and over cooked, we didnt even complain about it. We got copule drinks. My 3 round of beer, I see a lipstick on my glass but i was almost done woth half of my glass so i didnt bother. I drank on opposite side of lipstick. When i ordered to new one to server, i said please be careful on that. Lipstick is not an issue for me but they have to be careful on that. On top of everything, we didnt get any discount, complimentary dessert/drinks (i dont even like dessert) or something else which we were not expecting to get something from them. And also we ordered Nachos which it was good. However we got our main course when we have more that half of big plate of nachos. How you estimate 2 people gonna finish that big Nachos in that much short time. That is insane. After that service and lack management/operation we just wanna leave from place asap. When we got the check, there is no comp or discount on the check. They still get 18% tips from us but that is first and last time they are getting it.I am giving 2 starts just for good intention of server.",,,

The right  ratio of bun to burger, toasted just right and full of flavor.I'm not a fan of mayo (aka aioli) but the cranberry aioli was very good.

The food is good, the drinks are good and the staff is pretty friendly (with a couple exceptions). My only complaint at this juncture is that you sometimes have to flag a bartender down to get a drink|place an order and even when you do, they forget!  Like literally... you'll be waiting for your order and it will never come until you remind them you placed it in the first place. I've actually had to remind two different bartenders on separate occasions about 3 times EACH that I ordered a drink|asked for a food menu. Um... horrible for business!  Hopefully, the service will be consistently reliable going forward. I mean, you're just losing money and patrons by not being attentive. Even with that said, I love this place and will continue to go unless the bad starts to outweigh the good.",1,,2

Doesn't break the bank.---Ok. I'm a Brooklynite, so few things will get me Uptown. Met a friend here for dinner and drinks (#reciprosity) and it was a solid choice. Food was good. Cannot vouch for their cocktails but had a few glasses of wine and they have a varied and affordable menu. My waiter was truly lovely. But good GAWD the DJ couldn't figure out volume control. Like... Seriously... I could deal with constant loud versus the flux in volume. I think he legitimately had an on and off switch as opposed to a slider on his kit. I'd compare it to the insertion and removal of my grandmother's hearing aid every 30 seconds. My friend and I sometimes struggled to hear each other speak. Which kinda sucked because we went out to catch up! But yes... Other than that, I'm sure I'd wholly vibe with this place on a Monday - Thursday. But seeing that it's far for me... I'll just leave it as a back pocket backup if I happen to be in the hood.",,,

We arrived around 9pm and some friends were wearing hats, the bouncer at the door stated there was a $5 hat check fee per person. They decided to put their hats in the car, when the bouncer saw this he told them they still had to pay the hat check fee because that was his tip for allowing them in...Another friend arrived wearing boots and was told they couldn't get in, the same hat check fee bouncer stated if she ""slides him a tip"" then he would let her in.I would have more respect for this establishment if they were to say no hats or boots after 9pm and stuck to this rule, but having that tip thirsty bouncer at the door was disappointing.  Not sure if they are trying to be a resturant or club.We were so turned off by this that we decided to head to Red Rooster's across the street and had no problems getting in.Likes..the food was tasty and the Dj was good.

Corner Social is a dark, loud, and lively place. The DJ was on 100%, I mean not one bad song played!!

147,Tina B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,40,0,1.0,2/21/2018,"I do not recommend this restaurant. I've eaten here multiple times, for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and each time has been a disappointment and massive waste of time. Don't bother with the chicken and waffles--the waffles were non-descript and the chicken was both under seasoned AND burnt. Also, service is extremely slow, to the point that the last time I went my table didn't even get past drinks and placing a single order for fries that took an hour to come. After waiting for over 45 min we let our waiter know we'd be leaving and asked for the check, and only then did they manage to get the fries out. And no, the restaurant wasn't even busy, in case you were wondering. It's almost important to note that this place is owned by the same people who own Angels of Harlem, which is known for racially profiling customers. Providing decent food, decent service, and basic respect for customers is the absolute bare minimum for any dining experience and the fact that the owners don't take any of these obligations seriously should be reason enough for you to bypass this place and spend your time/money elsewhere.",3,,

We sat outside because it happened to be 60+ degrees which is nice weather for February. I took away a star because for the prices the drinks are weak & this food portions are small. I spent $40 with tip for one drink that gave me no buzz and lobster ravioli that came with 6 pieces. I was still hungry. Also because of the neighborhood, it's a little ratchet. One table sitting out side was trying to run out on their bill and I imagine that's happened a few times before. All and all I would come back but maybe just for drinks inside to listen to the music.",2,,

She was unprofessional, and behaved like she was on something. The food was terrible (we ordered the Shrimp and grits, Salmon, and a side of spinach.) worst brunch I ever had and I would never recommend anyone to come here again. The drink had no alcohol in it (a two for one special of Avion) The service was so terrible. Just because it's Harlem doesn't mean it's acceptable.

Sometimes i come back on this particular day I came back to find out that there is a cover charge. I asked to speak with the manager on duty at this time. To explain I was just here and asked if I was required to pay$10.  Security guard (Pat) says he is the manager and what he says goes.  If you go there early for happy hour don't expect to be allowed back in. You must pay $10 bucks as per Pat (Security guard)  When did security start collecting money at the door of a restaurant. $10 bucks  isn't the problem but you would think if you was there not to long ago whats the problem. The way security talks to customers are unheard of and this issue is only on weekends.  Security sucks there and they treat customer like crap and please if your from the area and frequent during the week they make you wait look at you from head to toe and say wait. Security guard by the name of pat and his brother they  feel as if they can do what ever they want. If no customers go there who will they charge $10 and whowill security have to charge?,1,,

We had 5 people in total to ask the guy to relax, including security, but nothing happened. They allowed him to continue his actions, we paid our tab and tried to leave and still being harassed by the other patron which resulted me and girlfriend to be escorted out, while the nuisance remained inside.We both felt we received the wrong end of the stick. If you're going to have security, they should at least do they're job and not stand on the sidelines twiddling their thumbs. I am outraged.",,,
175,Quin S.,"Manhattan, NY",114,99,388,4.0,6/4/2016,"review for 6-2-16it was a beautifully sunny day and perfect to sit outside.  My mom, sis and I walked up to the front to read the menu and the smiling staff made it easy to decide, yes.  I've been here before and was considering a particular dish but they changed the menu - yet a great change it is.We shared the food pictured and everything was really good. I'm starting a ""find my fave truffle fries"" mission and this was a great kick-off.  Those fries are my standard.  I had a drink called the ""lion"" that simultaneously helped with my allergies and peaked my inner flirt.It was such a nice cool vibe.  I've always gone at night.  Had no idea the day time had such greatness to offer.  Arnold Schwarzenegger.",,,

177,Shar S.,"Marietta, GA",7,6,2,2.0,4/23/2017,This is my first time here and I have to say I was very disappointed in there food. We were there during  brunch I had chicken &waffles. The chicken had zero flavor what so ever. My waffles definitely tastes like rubber. The hostess tried to accommodate but even that it was still bad.We were seated immediately but I probably wont be back to eat.,,,
178,Ching J.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,14,2.0,1/26/2016,"No loud music, not even 15 people, yet I had to wait at the door for a while to be seated. They say I could sit ""anywhere"". But, they ended up not allow me to sit in 3 places which I picked. I was just by myself. It was 13:33 pm. I am having lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. The space is big and with a cool look. The menu is limited, the service is just soso. I had to change my wine glasses because it was dirty. Ordered mushroom and cheese sandwich, it is not bad. The bill is $26It would make me happy if the waiter and the bar tender would smile a bit.",2,,
179,Emmanuelle A.,"Bronx, NY",182,22,4,3.0,11/29/2016,"I would give this location 5 stars for their food, music, drinks and ambiance BUT I am giving 3 stars for the service - more so front of the house service. The girls in the front are very rude and seem a little stuck up. This place gets packed so I understand why people can get easily ticked off but some respect and hospitality should be shown to customers.I would make reservations so you wouldn't have to deal with attitudes for not having space. **IF YOU LOVE PASTA, ORDER THE LOBSTER RAVIOLI.

180,Shaun R.,"Brooklyn, NY",535,2,2,1.0,11/7/2016,"After spending all day writing fellowship proposals with a friend, we wanted to unwind and grab a quick drink. I also had a friend visiting, so I wanted to show them a good time.  We got to Corner Social roughly 8:30/9 on a Saturday night. We stood in a relatively short line we approached the door man, before we could even pull out our ID's, in a rather aggressive tone he barked ""Ya'll can't come in"". Confused, we asked why. He said ""no sports attire"". Even more confused; after seeing people with baseball caps, ripped jeans, tennis shoes, hoodies all enter before us we asked, ""Who has on sports attire?"" In an even more aggressive tone, he barked ""You have on sweatpants"". I informed him that I was not wearing sweat pants, but yet jogger cut trousers. Based on his body language, and tone, it quickly became clear he was using that as an excuse not to let us in. that we didn't fit the target demographic. The only difference  between us and the people he let in before us was the fact we were here black. I hate to boil it down to that, but facts are facts. It's sad that despite my friends and I positive social standing in the community we would be discriminated in such a manner.",20,2,1
181,Joe W.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",352,1,0,5.0,12/4/2016,Definitely enjoyed my time here at The Corner Social for my birthday Brunch. Camille the manager was very hospitable and Jess was our waiter and she remembered myself and my friends from the last time we were here.

182,Todd P.,"Holbrook, NY",76,23,0,5.0,7/15/2017,Yet another Harlem favorite as I am now a Harlemite resident here in the neighborhood. I got the lobster ravioli and my girl chose the pasta primavera. Both arrived to our table extremely fast for a busy Saturday night. Also has the best sweet potato fries here in NYC. Drinks will keep you ordering as they are strong yet well paired. Definitely good for family nights put or just good friends meeting up/ meet ups and dates.,1,,

We ordered our 4 meals, three came an hour later we were still waiting. I will give this place 5 stars if they had great service but they don't! Just don't come here starving because you won't get your meal at least for an hour!",,,
184,Lisa A.,"Milwaukee, WI",254,635,1083,4.0,4/18/2015,"Nice lively spot on the corner of lenox and 125th right off the 2/3 line.  Came here at 9:30 on a Thursday and it was pretty bustling but not so busy that you feel uncomfortable and can't enjoy yourself.  They take your number and text you when a spot opens up. We didn't wait long, at the bar or for a table (luckily we got a four top instead of the communal one).  I actually thought that given it was fairly busy, our service was great.For food I had a Portobello burger -- perfectly fine but there's probably more adventurous things on the menu.  They had a decent beer list but I tried two cocktails-- the Social Mint, good if you're ok with Hennessey, and the Harlem Sage, better but unfinished because although the drinks were $13 each they clearly did the trick and I was singing while the played Nore's ""whatcha wanna do"" sometime midway through said drink.They were (very) sadly out of banana bread pudding and nothing else caught my eye so we skipped dessert.I'd definitely return next time I'm in the neighborhood.",,,

186,Rikki V.,"Hempstead, NY",18,43,14,3.0,11/26/2016,"1:30AM 11/27/16---I literally just got home from this spot (and munching on my leftovers as I type)... Location: Super easy to get to. I was driving from Long Island and it took me 45 minutes to get there and 30 minutes to get home. There's plenty of street parking and a parking lot around the corner. Door Security: The gentleman at the door was very nice and warm. I greeted him and he said ""Good evening sweetheart, how are you?"". So sweet. Most door security personnel don't even speak. After checking my identification he opened the door for me and told me to have a good time. Atmosphere: Dim (maybe a little too dim). The music was playing. I felt at home. I can't remember what was playing when I walked in but I know that it was something pleasant to the ear. I'm thinking Bad Boy circa 1998ish?? Throughout my time there the DJ played Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, Prince and Color Me Badd. People were dancing in their seats. It was very nice. The music was a taddddd too loud but we made due. I had people dancing on my head when I was at my table. Maybe they should consider having a separate section for dancing so you don't grind your ass on others when they are eating. Table/Waitress Service: Our waitress was very nice (pretty, skinny, Hispanic (I think) with corn rows and beautiful nude eye makeup). I didn't get her name but she was prompt and attentive. Thank you for your service. Food: I had the spinach, mushroom and shrimp mac and cheese. My FAVORITE 4 things in one dish. It was delicious!!!!!!!!! It came out hot and cheesyyyy and spinachy and mushroomy. Big chunks of mushroom. Fresh spinach. The macaroni was cooked perfectly al dente (slightly under cooked) and the shrimp was delicately placed on top. Delicious. Magnificent dish. I would eat this everyday. Drinks: I had 2 Social Mules, which is a take off of the Moscow Mule. The cocktail came in a traditional Mule tin mug. It was very good but could have been stronger. I didn't have an inkling of a buzz. All in all, I would come back! Thank you for a great evening in Harlem World!!!",2,1,
187,Stacey A.,"Astoria, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,1/14/2018,"This was probably one of the worst brunches I've experienced. We waited 30mins for a table (tables were available for 4 people but since we were 2, they wouldn't seat us-even though not one party of 4 showed up). Once seated, we waited another 10mins for a server. The server barely engaged on a personal level. Service was terrible, not even mediocre, TERRIBLE. Our drinks arrived after our food (mind you, a soda was ordered which can easily be poured from the gun). The server offered no recommendations. I asked for condiments and those took forever to show up. Food: 1) shrimp & grits: lacked flavor, had large chunks of garlic mixed in. Decent portion size but for $19, I will pass. 2) chicken & waffles: the chicken is dark meat, 3 small pieces. It wasn't flavorful nor fresh. The waffle was reminiscent of an ego waffle and the fruit bowl (if that's what they want to call it) taste like some canned fruit. Not worth $6, nevermind $16.  All in all, I will not return to Corner Social.",1,,

190,Diego C.,"Round Rock, TX",50,183,133,2.0,11/23/2015,"I try to stay open-minded when I hit dives in New York but I just wasn't impressed with this one.  It felt like they are over-utilizing too little space.  There were maybe 100 people there, but if felt like 1000.  There are lots of tables but no where to really move or dance even though people try. The DJ was playing hardcore hip-hop laced rap music.  Deafeningly loud.  I simplified my drink order because the bartender couldn't hear me.  The bartenders were ok, but it took a long time.  There is really nothing spectacular about the venue.  For my Texas folks, it reminded me of Mash'd or Scruffy Duffies (with bad music).  Overall I was not impressed.Please keep in mind that my review is only regarding the experience that i had one night.  I don't know what goes on during normal business hours.  It looks like it could be a nice pub or tavern, which is how it is set up.",2,,
191,Quinntin S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,3,0,2.0,7/13/2017,"Went tonight (Thursday). Lively crowd. Super loud music. You have to yell to be heard over the music if your seated at a table. Service was slow and the waiter often forgot additional items or just didn't check back. There was a manager with dreads who pranced around with a like a Chinese fan popping it in patrons faces. When my table moved to the bar he hit me in the face with it and when I told him he just pranced away and didn't apologize. If that's how the management responds then it only makes sense that the service was deplorable as well. This used to be a great venue, I think it's still a good place to grab a drink on the weekdays but the quality of the venue in terms of service has hastily gone downhill.",,2,
192,Tara W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",82,1,0,3.0,4/3/2018,"I've been to corner social many times and previously been very happy but I can't say the same about my most recent experience.  It was a Monday night granted but there was a belligerently drunk group of people who ended up causing a huge scene.  Majority of the people confronting these individuals were the female wait staff and hostess and I was appalled to watch as these women spoke up with no support from male staff until security was finally called in.  My waitress particularly when politely speaking to this group of people was met with irate rantings, threats and a man screaming an inch away from her face.  I felt that the female staff here are not being properly supported nor protected by the management in this establishment and I greatly feared for their safety and their lives in the midst of this interchange.  As I previously said I've had positive experiences here before but this last experience just left me uneasy and very concerned for the women working there.",,,
193,Shara R.,"New York, NY",104,39,13,4.0,5/11/2017,"To me this place is a Harlem staple! We headed on over after a nearby brunch spot decide to do the absolute most. Basically what I'm saying is Corner Social is always on the ""go to"" list. One could end up frequenting this place because of it's variety of food, the service and the atmosphere. This was my first time visiting for bunch I ordered a veggie omelet, which came with a complementary mimosa and my daughter had no problem with the waffle. I would say the DJ was a little loud considering that the windows were not open on the day I went therefore, the music seemed to trap us or maybe engulf us. Yikes!  The server was amazing!! We shared compliments, short conversation and a few laughs. She was pleasant and very prompt. I like their uniform theme, on the day I went the theme was Great Gatsby.",2,,1

196,Portia D.,"Miami, FL",1,10,4,5.0,5/27/2016,"Beyond thankful for the crew at Corner Social. They made planning my birthday celebration a breeze! I spoke with Anahi just shy of a week after stopping by Angel of Harlem to see if I could host a gathering there. She politely told me that AoH would be closed on that Monday night but offered Corner Social as an alternative. She immediately sent an email to Camille (event coordinator) who responded the next day with availability and a designated space. When my friends arrived (I only RSVP'd for 15 and about 30 showed up) they were beyond accommodating. They showed us good time with good drinks and specials throughout the night. From the time I walked in until the time I left, the service was top notch. I could've asked for a better experience on my birthday! Thanks Corner Social!",,,
197,Allison B.,"NJ, NJ",353,83,38,3.0,10/27/2016,"This bar in Harlem was mediocre at best. The decor was awesome, and the crowd was trendy. However, everything else was average. The food was okay. Nothing was nasty, but nothing stood out as being amazing either. The drinks were strong, but not that tasty. I had a drink called ""the lion"" and it was disgusting. The only drink that was worth getting was the sangria. I also wasn't thrilled about the Saturday night DJ. He seemed to be the only person into the music he was playing . Although this place didn't live up to the hype, I will say the management was very accommodating. I literally planned my last minute bday dinner here, and they were super professional. I was able to book a reservation for 10 with less than one week's notice. Every other place I called was booked for on Saturday night,  but not this place. This place gets major points for that! Overall, I would come back here again to get cute, people watch, and sit at the bar. Other than that, I probably won't be back.",2,,

There was great energy in the place, we sat inside and were served immediately. We had oysters, zucchini and potato soup (fab!) main course lamb chops and spinach and mashed potatoes. My friend had lobster linguine.  It was all Great! Even the bread and our cocktails that they start you with were all good. Laura, our waitress and Nino, the manager were warm and welcoming.  The only issue I had in there that night was with the DJ.  I don't remember his name. He was playing all kinds of Prince music. I went to the booth to request a Prince song. I stood patiently waiting to be acknowledged, he looked at and ignored me.  Aside from that, a great night.  I'll be back!",1,,
