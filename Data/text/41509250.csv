0,Brad P.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,0.0,5.0,10/17/2018,Came here with some coworkers after a long week. Great food and atmosphere with great service. I enjoyed the wings along with the braised short rib sandwich. Both items were delicious. Nachos also looked amazing.Would recommend,,,
1,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",276,412,694,2.0,10/27/2018,"I pass by this location pretty often and see that there's always a big crowd around the door. They have an open area where you can people watch and being that the window is also open, it definitely allows for some kind of enjoyment in the midst of Manhattan. There are company events that get held here constantly and I have attended for one as well. Big crowds of people during this time, also problematic to try out the food that gets tossed around, but I did manage to snag a bite. I wasn't too impressed with the menu being that it was just bar food. I also came here for drinks with two girlfriends to catch up where we were at the bar. Service wasn't amazing, but we were left to chat in peace which I enjoyed. Probably would only return if I needed a local place to go only.",,,
2,Teresa C.,"New York, NY",153,466,1812,2.0,10/19/2018,"Mealpal Only:Chicken Sandwich - The bread for the sandwich was slightly burnt. Also the bread was similar to the bread for hot dogs. What I didn't like about the bread was that it falls apart as soon as you bite. In the picture, you see there are four sections or bumps on the bread. As soon as you bite it, one section falls off mid bite and you have a hanging piece of chicken sticking out from the sandwich and the bread probably hanging off from your mouth or ending up on table. The chicken itself is alright. I'm just glad the chicken wasn't dry. There was a piece of bacon in it which was a little on the soggy side. The jalapenos in the sandwich weren't very spicy which was good for me. The sandwich could use some extra sauce between the bread and the chicken as it was kind of dry and bready.",2,1,1
3,Tristan P.,"Boonton, NJ",199,239,83,4.0,11/2/2018,Nice large space that's great for a larger crew. Mid afternoon on a week day was a perfect time to stop in and the place was empty.

5,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,3.0,5/27/2018,This is a new addition (or at least new to me) to the Park Avenue South area. A co-worker and I were looking for someplace close by for a somewhat leisurely lunch (as leisurely as you can be in an hour) so we selected the Mason Jar.The place was empty for lunch so we were very quickly shown to our table. We had:- Bratwurst - very tasty with a few jalapeños. Very - Brisket Sandwich - my co-worker enjoyedThey had us out within and hour! I would need to try a few more items on the menu to give this place 4 stars.,7,2,5
6,Tommy S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",2,5,0,5.0,9/24/2018,"I've come here during a busy lunch hour, happy hour, dinner time - you name it - and have always come away having had a great experience. A big part of that is because there's always incredibly friendly staff ready to help (with fast service)!The Lunch Special (double-patty burger or a hefty grilled chicken sandwich) comes with incredibly good slaw & even A BEER for $16. A pretty solid special for the area so no surprise why everyone goes for lunch.  I also recommend the Aztec Bowl and Shrimp & Grits. If you haven't gone yet check it out soon!!",,,

11,Teniqua K.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,54,145,4.0,2/22/2018,"I was looking for a spot to have a quick bite to eat and i found this location thru Yelp. I was able to get a park directly across the street due to the schools  are closed for break. Once inside there was only two others individuals sitting at the bar. So service was quick. Our visit started a little rocky at first with our drink orders. I ordered a coke and my husband and son ordered sweet ice tea. When our drinks arrived my coke was flat and the tea required you to add sugar to make it sweet tea.  Hmmm. But we informed the manager and he corrected all our drink orders with can sodas. Our food order consist of the smoked salmon with mashed potatoes and green beans which my husband enjoyed so much he only offered me one bite. My son had the fries with 3 different sauces (cheese, chipotle and I can't remember the last), cajun wings (yummy), Mac & Cheese, and an open face smoked beef brisket with coleslaw (delish).Overall the food and atmosphere is definitely worth the visit. We had a few bumps in the beginning but it was rectified immediately with apology.",,,

The wings are some of the best in the  city. The burger is damn near perfect. Bar is great, plenty of seating both in the front and back of the restaurant. Always get great service, bartenders are awesome at recommending beers based on what you like. Can't recommend this place enough",1,,
14,Alex G.,"Marine Park, Brooklyn, NY",0,36,19,5.0,9/27/2018,"Best BBQ place in the city!!! Came here on a Sunday night for the Patriots game since they have a huge projector and TVs throughout the entire restaurant.

These guys have NFL Sunday Ticket and the manager was beyond awesome at making sure we had a perfect spot to watch, kept checking to make sure all was good, and truly made Sunday football day awesome! The waiter (Riaz) and waitresses are super attentive, great personalities, and the smoked wings were great! I've been some places in NYC and would not even think about going on yelp to say anything...and honestly, I don't typically, but I really felt like they deserved some stars and a big THANK YOU! Great place for grub, football and kindness!!!",,,
16,Megan F.,"Yorba Linda, CA",14,5,3,1.0,8/30/2018,"An empty restaurant should have been a dead giveaway. The servers were incredibly awkward and the food was even worse. It took over 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Once it did, everything was cold and terrible. There was also a bag of hair in the restroom to add to the experience.",,1,
17,Valerie V.,"Raleigh, NC",208,237,556,5.0,4/21/2018,"Two North Carolina girls in search of a cute New York spot to eat lunch and of course we stumble into a South Carolina inspired bar.  The staff was great. All really nice and attentive. We ordered beer each. Their lunch special is great - grilled chicken or a burger and side and a beer for $15. Great deal!  The sandwiches all come with Cole slaw which originally thought was weird but when it came out it was really great - but please note I did pay $3 extra for fries too. The grilled chicken sandwich was awesome. Simple but everything it should have been. Tender, juicy. The lettuce was finely shredded. The bacon was super crispy and I was in Heaven. I dipped my fries in the cole slaw- give it a shot. Amazing. I would definitely go back here if in the same area looking for a bite.",1,1,1
18,Sen L.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",42,48,62,2.0,11/1/2017,So disheartened by my recent experiences with Mason Jar. I work nearby so I get takeout from here maybe twice a month. In the past I fell in love with their pulled pork and mashed potatoes but now they are inedible due to the amount of grease in the food. The meat is swimming in a pool of grease and the mashed potatoes are thin and wet from the grease as well. I'm not kidding- see the photos I will attach. It was so bad this time that it soaked through my bag and stained my work papers (i didn't notice until i removed the container from the bag). The unfortunate thing is I know how good their food can be. Not sure if they changed the cook or not but I hate that this has been happening. This is the 3rd time in a row my food comes like this. I kept hoping it would get better but it hasn't so I will not be returning. I'm done with the platter of grease and the inevitable heartburn. What a waste.,1,,
19,Jackie R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,3,4.0,5/3/2018,It was a nice time with my family. They are get service and kind. Love the food and the drinks. Even my family love the place. We are planning to go again.,,,1
20,Abir D.,"Manhattan, NY",177,52,9,2.0,5/25/2018,"I usually don't knock a place for poor reviews from other yelpers, but i think the 2-3 star rating is very fair.A small group of friends & I went for dinner and drinks at 8:30. they were out of wings, beer, and ribs. on a thursday. in midtown manhattan.let me repeat: a bbq restaurant located in midtown manhattan was out of beer, ribs, and wings by 8:30pm, on a Thursday. I wanted to like the place but as the evening progressed, I became increasingly disappointed since all the good stuff was gone. what was supposed to be a long night filled with drinks & food at Mason Jar ended quickly by 9:30pm",,,
21,Jay G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",49,125,423,4.0,6/14/2017,"Been a big fan since it opened it's doors. Food has always been on point. My most recent trip down delicious lane involved the brisket, mac n Cheese and an ice cold IPA. Perfect combination. My buddy in town from Houston had the wings. He approved (which means a lot coming from a big ol Texas brotha)Watched one of the NBA finals games here, cuz they have a boatload of TVs. Seating is usually available. Wait staff is really cool and the bartenders are dope AF.Drink prices are exactly what you want them to be, so if you're looking for a Happy hour spot, this is the place for you. Beware the Friends extras gallivanting about, that's just midtown for ya.",4,1,1
22,Chelsea P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,4,1,1.0,6/25/2018,"This place is absolutely awful. They put cheap liquor in their expensive liquor bottles. I ordered a jack and coke and it tasted like rail whiskey. You can't fool whiskey drinkers people. The food took about two hours to come out, and my chicken entree was so burnt that I couldn't even chew it. They didn't bring my friends entree out until about 40 minutes after everyone else got theirs, so he had to eat alone. I wouldn't recommend going here even if you're starving and this is the only option.",,1,
23,Kelsey M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/8/2018,I have been here with Co-workers both for lunch hour and happy hour. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is delicious! Highly recommend for any occasion.,,,

We started with the strawberry lemonade vodka and a manhattan. I didn't love the lemonade & vodka because it had mint and I just don't love mint in drinks. Anyway, we then got the fried pickles and I got the pork sandwich with coleslaw and he got the half rack with coleslaw. We actually also ordered mac & cheese but the waiter forgot. We were so full we let it go. All the food was delicious and I definitely want to return. The ambiance was cute and I was definitely a fan that it wasn't super crowded on a Friday night.",2,,1
25,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,469,469,3.0,5/7/2017,"I came here for happy hour on a Friday night for Cinco de Mayo after work.  We ordered margaritas and tostadas since they had specials ($5 margaritas and $5 tostadas or $8 tostadas with meat).  The food was okay but without happy hour pricing, a pair of tostadas is $13 (additional $8 if you want meat) which is very expensive even for New York standards.  The service was good.  However, their bathroom was disgusting.  It clearly was not cleaned regularly.  One bathroom was out of service so they had 2 tiny stalls that I barely fit in even though I'm a 5'3 petite person.  I don't know if I'll be back.",4,1,2
26,Kasey R.,"New York, NY",265,197,1759,4.0,3/31/2017,Good location for Paint Nite! The bar has a separate upstairs areas that was perfect for the Paint Nite crew to enjoy our own class session.

27,Brenda O.,"New York, NY",348,5,0,3.0,11/27/2017,"Cute atmosphere! Tried a decent cocktail, did not try the food. They played great music! I will say that the service was poor. It was not crowded and I could not get a drink for 15 minutes while sitting at the bar. Throughout the night the bartender took so long to refill my drinks and she was unwilling to answer my questions about the drink menu! I would go back for dinner but not for happy hour with friends when I wanted to sit at the bar.",,,2
28,Tami C.,"Sandy Hook, Newtown, CT",108,1,0,5.0,9/25/2018,Mason Jar is my go to spot for lunch in the city.  The happy hour prices are great and the drinks are awesome as well.  The food is always amazing ranging from burgers to shrimp and grits.  Mason Jar is also a fun spot for major sports nights.  The bar might get packed but the service always keeps up!!,,,
29,Alison A.,"Manhattan, NY",361,84,138,3.0,2/15/2017,"This place is your average bar. Nothing that you can't find at another happy hour spot in NYC. It's pretty basic and every time I go it is usually for happy hour.Good place for a big group to go and the prices are perfect. I usually go with their well drinks that are $5 during happy hour. If not that, I will do house wine which I believe is $6.Usually I'll get an app too. Their fries are pretty decent. They used to have the best nachos, but took them off them menu, which might be why they aren't highly rated for me anymore.Best thing to do is come here for happy hour with friends. Wouldn't recommend it for much else.",2,,
30,Lori K.,"Philadelphia, PA",527,270,1800,5.0,4/13/2016,"I've been going to Mason Jar NYC sporadically for two reasons over the course of 2 years. Reason number 1 is that it is about 10 steps away from the Sign Language Center, an amazing school that teaches all levels of American Sign Language (ASL). I like to go here before I get my learning on. Reason number 2 is because I love BBQ. When I started coming, this place had a large menu where you'd find a variety of sandwiches, salads, burgers and BBQ items. I was a huge fan of one of their salads. I don't know what it was called, but it was a large portion that had fresh mounds of goat cheese and big chunks of deep fried bacon. I mean really now...deep fried bacon on a salad. You can't get much healthier than that!On my latest trip to this place, I noticed a lot of changes to the menu. After being seated near the large windows at the front of the restaurant, Dennis kindly explained that the restaurant had taken a lot of items off the menu so that they could explore deeper into the world of BBQ. Dennis, who I assume is a manager/owner (if he's not, someone needs to get that man in a higher position), checked in a few times with my table to make sure everything was going smoothly. It was...While I waited for a friend to arrive, I got some deviled eggs which came with a small salad. I always though it was hard to mess up deviled eggs, and so far I've been right about this. They tasted great, and the acidity of the salad dressing made everything even better. When my friend arrived, I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich (without the bread). It came with a small side of coleslaw and a side of my choosing, which was cheesy grits. The chicken was seasoned well, the slaw was crunchy and the grits were.....so damn creamy. My friend got some type of sausage which he really enjoyed and 2 different types of beer. I know nothing about beer so I have nothing more to say about that. I was so stuffed that my friend had to have some of my chicken. He wasn't able to try the grits because when anyone comes near my grits...well let's just say that no one has survived to tell the story. They were good. So good. I recommend this place. Go for the food, the drinks, the always friendly staff and Dennis. If nothing more, just go say hi to Dennis. He really was such a nice guy.",1,1,2
31,Russell S.,"New York, NY",2,4,0,4.0,11/19/2017,The food here is great. The drinks are good too. The staff is super friendly. The one thing I'll say is that the owner refuses to stock the bar. You look at the display of liquor it's abysmal. It makes it look like it's going to close soon. That owner needs to get it together.,,,
32,Jordan R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,8/27/2018,"I work in the area and stop in quite often for lunch, sometimes for an early dinner - solid beer and food selection (lunch special beer and sandwich is a great option), top-notch service.  Reggae jams on Tuesday evenings I believe.  Easy 4 stars, more like a 4.5.",,,
33,Raymond J.,"Estes Park, CO",18,197,423,5.0,12/30/2016,"This place was super surprising seriously great ribs, better than most of the Texas ribs I've had. Bourbon brisket was perfectly tender and moist, but I didn't get any of the bourbon rub flavor but very good. The sides we're all really good, mac&cheese great, cornbread really nice and lightly sweeten. A great find in NYC",2,,1
34,Matthew T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/19/2018,"Truly one of the worst dining experiences I can remember. We went in for brunch on a Sunday and found the restaurant rather empty (~10-15 people). After 38 minutes of waiting for our food after ordering we asked the manager what the status was and he looked like a deer in headlights and scurried away to go check. After checking, he told us it would be 4 minutes which was oddly precise and became more odd after our food was another 9 minutes bringing the total wait time to 47 minutes after ordering. Once our food was delivered we were shocked at what took so long as the food looked microwaved yet was cold to the touch. After mustering a few bites each we all couldn't eat any more and asked for our check. After this awful experience the manager comped our $6 worth of coffee (huge thanks for that) which left us looking for where to go eat after wasting $105 and an hour and a half at this dump. Avoid at all costs. Couldn't be more disappointed. Our waitress and the manager never once checked in on us to tell us there was a delay. I assumed this place recently opened by how awful the management was but I am now shocked that it has managed to stay in business for 8 years.",,,
35,Shelby H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/19/2018,"I've been living in Manhattan for a year and this was by far the worst food experience I've had. It took them 45 minutes to serve us our food and they never came to our table to check on us and apologize for the wait. When the food came out, it was disgusting. I had the chicken and waffle and the waffle was cold and stale and the chicken tasted like it had just been microwaved. The rest of my group and I had a few bites of our food and decided to leave. There was also a giant zip lock baggie of black hair on the counter of the bathroom. I will never come back here and I suggest nobody else does either.",,,

Not my favorite beers but hey happy hour is happy hour. Definitely would've liked a better selection of beers on special. I've lived in North Carolina for four years so it was nice to run into a Southern restaurant in NYC. I had the pimento cheeseburger with fries and it was a treat. I haven't had pimento cheese since I left North Carolina so having it on the menu here was a really nice surprise. The fries were also great- perfectly seasoned and crispy.,1,2,1

59,Scott G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",53,165,48,3.0,11/21/2015,"If I based this review solely on the baby back ribs (which were so damned dry) or the Mojito (simply below average), they might have actually gotten 2 stars. That might be harsh and untrue actually. The service was fine, though I was a bit surprised the waitress didn't offer any kind of compensation, even in the form of a substitution or a redo after I told her exactly what I thought of the ribs... but the pulled pork was heavenly. Probably a perfect 10. I told her that, too,  but still, if you're a bbq pave and someone complains about your bbq (the Cole slaw was pretty blah also but yknow, that's not the bbq), I'd say something should be done. So anyway, I didn't ask for compensation. I just likely won't return. If I do, I'll just get a crapload of pulled pork to go. I was part of a party of 10 or 11 and we sat all the way in the back by the projector screen on Thurs 11/19.",,1,

61,Delaney P.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,101,52,3.0,9/3/2016,Pretty average bar in the city. Prices are reasonable and the large list of beer offerings was refreshing. Our waitress was attentive and very quick with her service. They had a huge TV playing the US open which was a big plus. The bar itself was just nothing special - I had a hard time just remembering the name after I visited. The reason this is a three star and not four is how quickly they can run out of beers. The night I visited half the menu was not available. This was quite a bummer. Overall a decent place there's just better options out there.,1,,
62,Jen C.,"New York, NY",157,193,165,5.0,8/9/2016,"I came here last Friday night for drinks/dinner with a friend. For some reason, I've had a lot of BBQ/Southern Food recently without setting out to. I've been to Pies N Thighs, Blue Smoke and of course here and I liked this one the best. The others I went to were pretty lame, but this one won out for me hands down. This pulled pork was moist, flavorful and a nice hint of smoke to it. I devoured it. And the collard greens were perfectly tender without being overcooked mush. Super cheesy mac n cheese that actually tastes like cheese instead of just cream. Excellent beer menu which always wins bonus points with me. The space feels like your average midtown pub, I know, but it's really so much better than all the other forgettable junk in the area. Not to mention that not only is the owner (Dennis, I think? Hopefully single as well?) super genuinely friendly, but he's also a total silver fox! and from Jersey to boot! Score.I'll be back.",1,1,1

I was happy to find out that the BBQ is totally authentic and they smoke their meats daily on premises. Their happy hour is killer and it's ALL DAY 11-7. They have an amazing lunch special that includes a free beer! So I had the Cajun fried pork skins that were so delish! They were sizzling and popping long after they arrived and you really need a partner to share them because they don't skimp on portion size. I followed up with the pulled pork sandwich and was super impressed! It came with chips and guacamole. The guacamole was totally in point! Loved it!

The breakfast your way and eggs Benedict both came with home fries and salad and super yummy. I didn't enjoy the red velvet waffles as much as I thought I would ... It was very heavy and the texture was a little weird. The chicken was delicious! Their draft collection is impressive, and their bloody Mary's on point.

We even read the menu outside stating the hours... it was only 10:30pm... the hours stated they were open until midnight and the place was completely locked and closed down [found it odd that the A-Frame was still on the sidewalk].

Plenty of seatiing and flat screens with the games on.Sure, it's a midtownie scene with some of the usual meatheads that occupy these spots, and can be a sausagefest from what I have noticed the times I have been here, but they do have a pretty decent beer and bourbon selection.

Went through 4 different choices of beers off the menu before they actually had something i tried to order. Im amazed bow they managed to run out of bud light. Not to sure how thats possible for a NYC bar.Food: ordered a $100 sampler for them to tell me they ran out of ribs. They then came back 5 mins later to tell me they ran out of turkey to. In their defense its a smoke house and to run out of food is commonPositives: with that being said. Food was good. More than filling. Staff was friendly, very apologetic, and attentive. Good amount of TVs for sports. Great atmosphere with friends. Overall if the management gets their stuff together this place could be great. Theres no reason why you should run out of almost every single beer on your menu. For christ sake send someone next door to get some bud-lights from the grocery store if need be.

Sorry Mason Jar, I had high hopes for you but you did not come through with the BBQ. While the host, bartender and our waiter were very nice, the food was, in a word: disappointing.  Forget that we were a party of four in the back booth, I will just write about what I ordered: 1/2 rack ribs, mac and cheese and collard greens and cornbread and none of it was good. In fact, I took one bite of the mac and cheese and could not ingest another bite. It was rubbery and cold - never have I ever seen a sadder display of mac&cheese  A couple of bites of the collard greens (which still had stems on them making them very tough); and the half rack was burnt and tough. I should have sent it back instead of asking it to be wrapped. (which I ended up tossing in the garbage anyway at home). Now I'm not complaining about the other three persons in my party. My BF got a sandwich with a side and he thought it was ""okay"" - and the other two members in our party picked away and didn't say a word about the quality. But they did not eat half of what was on their plate and did not want it wrapped to go.Another incident (and we told our waiter) -- we ordered fried pickles and when a young man bought them to our table we had no utensils - when we asked for utensils he whined and told us that he was not a server and that it wasn't his job, but okay (like he was doing us a favor). It was comical, silly and unprofessional.",1,,

The boozy brunch option is $15 extra (in addition to your entree price) for 2 hours of unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. When we first arrived, they had just opened, so we were the only people there and the service was, of course, amazing! As more people arrived the service definitely suffered. It was hard to get ahold of our waitress to get more drinks / the check. The food was good, but not outstanding-- I had the Mason Jar Breakfast (brisket, eggs, bacon, toast, and home fries). It was pretty loud in side, so if you're looking to have a brunch where you can talk intimately with someone, this wouldn't be the right place. They did have huge booths, though, so if you're looking to brunch with a large group, Mason Jar would be a great place to check out!

The food came out quick, and we honestly could have stayed much longer than we did. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?A buddy and I opted to share two dishes, which, while on the pricey side, weren't what I could deem unreasonable for brunch in Manhattan. No pics this time unfortunately:Brisket Grilled Cheese: $15.00Breakfast Wrap: $14.00It's a close call, but fair. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?We'll start with the breakfast wrap, which was, in many ways, just average. The eggs? Fine, but nothing fancy, and that goes for the cheese and brisket. No real spicy uniqueness, and not really a situation where the components came together to make something that was more than a sum of the parts. My biggest disappointment was that all of the brisket was on one side of the wrap while all of the egg was on the other, so the situation didn't really come up where I could eat both in the same bite. The brisket grilled cheese, while a bit better, was still really just standard grilled cheese with some brisket stuffed inside. No real zing to the bread of flavor from the cheese. All in all? It was just okay. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?There are so many great brunch options in NYC that I can't say I would make Mason Jar a routine stop.

98,Steve K.,"CORTLANDT MNR, NY",64,557,1894,4.0,9/22/2012,"When the line at Madison Square Park Shake Shack was just too long, tried out Mason Jar NYC.The Mason Jar Burger, served with side salad (or fries) with swiss, fried onions, and bacon on brioche roll was most tasty, $11.Wide choice of brews on tap, including the fine Goose Island Ale. Most are $7 for a pint. Also, many bourbons and rye whiskies also to choose from, $8-11.Fairly dark in the back, which you may or may not like.Will return.",,,
99,Garner S.,"Princeton, NJ",94,96,61,4.0,10/5/2014,"UPDATE:After our bad experience a little while ago, Chef Arim invited us back to give Mason Jar another try. This trip couldn't have been more different. We had brunch around 1PM before a lot of the college football games started, so the restaurant was pretty quiet. The service was awesome, we had beers right away, and had a really tough time picking from the options on their new menu. Most of the brunch options feature BBQ from their new smoker (eggs benedict with pulled pork, for example). I ended up getting French toast that was breaded in corn flakes and stuffed with maple cream cheese and bananas. It was fresh, and awesome. The food came out really quickly, and wasn't too much or too little. There are a ton of wonderful places in Manhattan for brunch lovers. But if you're looking for a BBQ twist, and a good place to watch some sports, I'd definitely give Mason Jar a try. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Wait for it... Wait for it.... No really, you'll have to wait for it. Came here for football and drinks, and some brunch. The service was good, the servers were very accommodating, and the beer isn't terribly expensive. However, the food portions (even for brunch) were surprisingly small, and the average wait time on food was about 90 minutes. For a bunch of ravenous day drinkers watching football, lukewarm breakfast delivered at lunchtime wasn't really appealing. I understand if they cook the food to order in queens and then ship it here, but in a city with incredible brunch, The Mason Jar is an easy skip.",,,
100,Brendan G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,12/14/2016,This is a Hidden BBQ gem! Started with the fried pickles. Then got into the baby back ribs and brisket. Ribs were fall off the bone and tasty. Brisket was moist and had a great smoke to it. Their house made bbq sauces were a great addition. Also had the mac and cheese which was very cheesy! Will definitely be back in the near future.,,,

102,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401,5.0,1/11/2014,"I came in here about Friday afternoon during happy hour.  It wasn't too packed but the bar was almost full.  I was one of the first to come in to have a table and eat some late lunch, early dinner, whatever you wanna call it.First off. This place is two floors.  Mostly tables on the second floor.  It's super clean.  There are tables and chairs as well as these huge wooden booths.  It's very spacious.  There are also awesome paintings on the wall.  Very pretty.Our waitress was so friendly, always checked up on us and made sure everything was great.  Super polite.The portions here are pretty large.  All burgers come with fries and it's a huge platter of fries.  They totally stuff the burger and aren't cheap with filling it up with whatever you want.  At fifteen bucks a platter it's an alright price compared to your pizza parlor which may only be ten.  However, these are what I would call more upscale burgers.  A simple turkey burger already has salsa and melted mozzarella cheese (not like your typical American cheese) and avocados (yum!).  The drinks here aren't really as strong as they could be.  The margaritas at Chipotle are definitely stronger than the ones here.  But, still, they are much prettier than the ones in the plastic cup Chipotle gives you, so I guess it's fair play.Around five sixish it started filling up with dinner folks and the bar started getting crowded.  I'm sure a lot of people take off right from work and come here, still in their suits and things.  I'm sure this is your typical sports bar.  Service, as I said, is astounding and definitely one of the best things about this place.The only thing that turned me off a little was the bathroom.  The women's bathroom has two stalls, but each stall literally has about five inches of room between you and the door.  But it was still clean, automatic sinks and all, so good compensation there.",1,,1
103,Tykela P.,"Manhattan, NY",135,39,28,2.0,7/5/2015,"Brunch is my favorite meal of life..  And this place ruined  a good Sunday..  The place is pretty big and spacious,  there weren't many customers. In fact I think the only customers were the groupon/ living social folks.. I had the ginger mule which was the only thing I liked on my entire table. With only 8 total people at the restaurant  my food took over 15 mins to show on the table.  The red velvet waffles were nasty,  not sweet I needed sugar and a new waffle.  The chicken was not fried right it was sort of soggy,  and tasteless.  I hate adding salt to my food and this time I had to make an exception.  The salt didn't help much.  I was starving so I ate my food for survival.  My boyfriend had the brisket Omelette, and we are still looking for the brisket.  He also used salt and he is  health conscious self is also not a fan of salt. He felt that he could  make it better and he doesn't know how to cook.  His Arnold Palmer  wasn't that bad either..  Shout out to the bartender you're the best thing at the Mason Jar.  Ugh death to red velvet  waffles. Our sever was also sweet but I came for the food.",1,,

It's not Bottomless but the Mimosas were only $5!  We started off with the Deviled Eggs....really good and not salty. I had the Short Rib Grilled Cheese which came with a lovely salad my companion had the pancakes which came with a berry butter and we got a side of sausage.

It has delicious drinks, yummy food, not overly crowded, not too loud, and have a casual yet classy feel. I seriously can't think of anything bad about this bar. It's just so perfect for chilling out with friends in a relaxing and fun background and having great conversations!! Plus, Mar Jar is conveniently located.

Entrees, however, leave something to be desired. $8 extra for 4 tiny shrimp added to my salad? Feel like I was tricked into an upsell. Also $8 was a side of collard greens my friend got. We had a similar disappointment in the portion size. Hey, this is midtown, and cheap food is not to be expected, but I'm at least looking for quality. The tables could also do with a good cleaning. More than a few times in the night, my beer glass was stuck to the surface and needed a good twist to get it off and not spill everywhere.",,,

Being pretty health conscious, I tend to prefer sandwiches that are light on the sauces. But I'll say the garlic aioli was a bit much on the grilled chicken (some of the veggies/chicken pieces were drenched) and I had to wipe some of it off. Other than that, the flavors were great (plus points for the really good bread on the sandwich). My friend thought the pulled pork and macaroni & cheese were extremely good so I'll take his word for those dishes! Portion size was satisfying!  Other than that, servers were pretty attentive and this is a good option for a quick meal! Also seems like a good place for drinks/watching sports.",2,,

Platters may seem expensive...however, the portion sizes are massive. 2 of us had trouble tackling just one platter. The pulled pork was amazing and the cornbread w/ honey butter mmmmm mmmmm mm. The mashed potatoes were just ok, would've liked something thicker and possibly the skins from russet potatoes.

112,Cindy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,4,0,4.0,6/5/2015,"I came here with a Living Social for brunch - 2 entrees (up to $15) and 2 cocktails (up to $10). Drinks: BF got a spiked Arnold Palmer and I got a moscow mule type of drink. They weren't too strong and my drink was too sweet for me. Food: I ordered a donut burger with a side salad (out of guilt). OMG. As someone who would eat Cheddar Ruffles and Nutella in the same sitting (not together though now I'll give it a try), the donut burger was AMAZING. Perfect balance of sweet and salty and the patty very generous size. The food came on trays instead of plates so I was pleasantly surprised to see half the tray covered with salad vs a measly bowl. Granted it was just spring mix but still - size matters. BF had the chicken and (red velvet) waffle. I personally think fried chicken tenders are a cop-out for chicken and waffles but, he enjoyed it. And the red velvet waffle was delicious and not too sweet.Service: It wasn't busy at all when we went on an early Sunday afternoon. Half the time, I expect poor service as soon as the waiter sees my Living Social but I thought the ladies were very nice and attentive.Would I come again? For that donut burger - Hell yes! I'd probably get a $5 mimosa instead of a $11-12 specialty cocktail to go with it. It ain't fancy, but its a solid brunch spot without the wait.",1,,

My friends did and they agreed even though the portions are tiny. The main reason for the 2 stars is the watered down cocktails. I'm not a big beer drinker, so, I had vodka sodas that afternoon. Well, I had about 4. My friend had the same. Either our tolerance was way up that day or those drinks were weak and watered down. I think the latter.  We went to another bar after the game (Boxers) and ordered the same drink. Much stronger and not to mention cheaper. A real drink. I guess, stick to beer here and avoid cocktails? Oh and the music, way too loud.",,,
114,Andie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,638,92,4.0,3/4/2014,"I came here on a Tuesday night after work to decompress with a fellow coworker. When we came in, we were seated right away. While the front near the bar was packed, the upstairs and back room dining area was not. Our waiter was took our order and bought our food out quickly. While I can't say she was super attentive because once our food arrived she never came back around until it was time to order dessert and then get the bill. My coworker ordered a couple of drinks, which she complained was a bit watery.  My Shirley Temple was decent but that is very hard to screw up. The food was pretty good. My coworker got the fried pickles [she liked those], the cheesy bacon tater tots [loved them!] and the mac and cheese which was really good. I got two tacos [was a bit bland], the chicken tenders [really good tender & juicy] and the spicy cheesy fries, which lacked cheese. Our waitress was kind enough to add extra to our to go order. The red velvet cake was pretty tasty and standard. It was nothing super great about it.Overall, this is a great place to hang out after work and drink a couple of beers, watch the game and clog your arteries with fatty fried goodness.",,,

The brisket is just right and the smoke flavor is dead on. My group tried the new menu items tonight that all consisted with items from the smoker. I can tell they brine the meat before its smoked because it was all so tender. Let me tell you that the fried chicken and waffles my friend had was amazing and it came with 100% maple syrup, I couldn't keep my fingers off his plate. The draft beer was a great variety and our server had the answer to all our BBQ questions. they even put all the house BBQ sauce on the tables so we can choose our own.

I liked everything but nothing stood out. Not sure about the prices since friend paid.  I had ordered sweet tea but they ran out, so my second option - strawberry lemonade - was not bad.

Updated review","A bit of a disappointing brunch today, but not all terrible. Food was good: pancakes and stuffed French toast were both very good. Service was the main problem today, I don't like to complain, but it just missed the mark today and should probably be improved. Coffee was served without any spoons and there was really no attention to refills and it seemed to come as a surprise to our waiter that I would like a refill on both my water and coffee. It also took quite a long time to take our order and get the food out today. The service was also not terribly friendly today until it was time to pay (and tip). It wasn't awful, just not very good at all. I like The Mason Jar, so will likely still be back, but this experience was disappointing to say the least.",,,

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a #9 in a bottle. My total was $23, not too bad.The fries were awesome, but the pulled pork was too soft. There wasn't really a single meaty bite. The bbq sauce they provided was better then the sauce on the meat, but I adjusted it to my liking. It came with a few pickle chips and a 1/4 scoop of coleslaw. The coleslaw was good, but not nearly enough- especially because I like to put the slaw in my pulled pork sandwich. The bartender was cute, but not very busy and didn't say more than 2 words to me. She'd get a lot better tips if she interacted with customers just a little. I know it was early, and I can imaging cash just flowing when this place is busy at night, but a little effort on the lunch shift and she'd make a fortune.",,,

It was a bit disappointing that they were out of a lot of things we wanted.For a place called the Mason Jar, they don't have as many cocktails out of Mason Jars as you would expect. However, we did have the Mason Jar Lemonade - it was STRONG and DELICIOUS! Highly recommend to vodka lovers. Aside from that, it was a great sports-watching atmosphere and a great staff.

The second time I came back was even worse. The food took forever and wasn't even that good. And our waitress Jeanine was miserable - super rude and inattentive. It took forever to get more drinks and she never even took our finished plates off the table, so we were basically sitting in garbage. Plus the music was so loud we could barely hear each other.

If you're jonesing for an appetizer, try the mac & cheese, it's super cheesy and tasty (and portioned to share). Another of my favorites is the fried chicken entrée, which is served w/ Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes--seriously, it's amazing... it's seasoned just right, tender, and utterly mouthwatering. As for their BBQ, the only selection I've tried is the pulled pork, which is tender and tasty enough, but be sure to apply plenty of BBQ sauce... or just stick w/ the chicken. =) Note that Mason Jar also serves up some tasty drinks like the Mason Jar Old Fashioned, which is Yummy!

But we were craving some brisket and some football so we took our chances. And luckily it totally paid off. We started with fried pickles which were good. Not amazing, but definitely good. I ordered the brisket sandwich with jalapeños and two different dipping sauces w/a side of sautéed kale. She ordered the brisket grilled cheese with a side of mac & cheese. Both of the brisket sandwiches were ahhhmazing. Tender, flavorful, everything brisket should be. The kale was a little too salty but still ok. And the mac and cheese could've been its own meal it was so rich and delicious. Overall, maybe this might not be the best spot for brunch from what I've read. But if you want to watch a game at the bar, get friendly/fast service, and eat some beyond good bar fare then this is a great place to go. I'll see you again Mason Jar!",,1,

When it comes to brunch I'm usually throwing elbows to get into the door! So this was a surprise. The food is ok. I had high expectations because Mason Jar in my head says in my head, Delicious Southern Food! Sadly my search of authentic good southern comfort in NYC continues on.... :(It was a cheap deal $12 for a brunch item and a complimentary Mimosa. Like I said the food was ok, the biscuit to gravy portion wasn't great, I needed more gravy. And the biscuit was a little dry even with the gravy. The bacon was crispy.When they sat us in the back booths it was blazing hot, we asked the server if they could turn on or up the A/C. Thankfully, we got some air flowing. Service wasn't bad but it's wasn't over and beyond. Never came by to refill our water glasses or check back to see if we liked our food, little things like that count.

Updated review","I have no idea what happened to this place! Brunch used to be so good, so when I came this past weekend, I was pretty excited. Service was slow. Slower than slow. It took a good 5-10 minutes to get anyone to acknowledge us, another 5-10 to get a menu, then water, then to place our order and forget about getting our food. The food has declined to a point where I had a stomach ache the entire day. I had the english muffin burger. My burger was served on a burnt english muffin with an over cooked burger. The huevos rancheros was not only served with nachos (could have been a cool unique twist if the salsa was actually good). The meal was lacking so much flavor, it was a waste of calories. Even the Mimosas were awful. Pretty sure I got a cup of orange juice...So long Mason Jar and the brunch that once was good.",2,,

Despite the emptiness of the restaurant, it took 30-45 mins for our food to arrive, and when it did, my beef brisket wasn't even hot...it was actually cold in some parts. The sweet tea was nothing like real sweet tea...I wouldn't even classify it as northern sweetened tea, because it tasted hardly sweeter than unsweetened ice tea. When we asked for extra sweetener, the waitress brought us two new sweet teas instead. Other issues with the service: we ordered extra cornbread because the menu didn't state it came with the meal--it would've been nice for the waitress to tell us it did.

Updated review","I've reviewed this place a few times because I work nearby and probably have lunch here about once a week.  It's time for an update, unfortunately they just don't seem to be able to get it right and stick with the positives.Over the years the menu has changed rapidly and not always for the best (RIP salad with avocado lime vinaigrette).  They finally got on track with the food, plating, etc. but yet again they've made some changes and this time it's their pricing.  Let me reiterate, the food is good but the pricing is wack.Why is a pulled pork sandwich for lunch $17?  On their website this is priced at $11, the last time I had this it was about $12 on the menu in the restaurant prior to these price increases (the website in general is completely outdated with the menus for pricing and options).  We tried the Pork Po'Boy ($15 - comes with pulled pork, coleslaw and fried pickles), which is basically a pulled pork sandwich but you're obviously getting less pork for $15 vs. $17.  The sandwich was good but not sure it's worth $15.     No one is spending $17 on a lunch sandwich in a casual bbq place, why would you even think that was an option?  If a party of 2 comes in for lunch and orders this, maybe a soda, etc. they're looking at a $40-$50 lunch when you include tip....for 2 people.  I'll keep my rating at 3 stars because the food is generally good but certainly not worth the new prices.  There are endless food options and lunch specials in the area so spending this kind of money on a casual lunch seems silly.  Yes I understand this is NYC and rent is high, food costs are high but it seems like whoever priced out these $17 lunch sandwiches were also high.",1,,
153,Art L.,"New York, NY",66,357,334,4.0,1/13/2012,"My first impression of the Mason Jar was that I was in an after work, noisy watering hole. What was nice about the Mason Jar was the range of ages of their customers and the mix of people inside. Even though the bar area in the front was packed, we were able to make our way to the dining area in the back. There is also a balcony that contains another seating area, but it appeared to be closed when we arrived.  We were seated quickly and were given menus consisting of Southern fare.  We ordered two entrees, a full rack of ribs, which were split in two, about 8 ribs per rack, and a braised lamb shank entrée. For sides, we had grilled asparagus, mac and cheese, and cole slaw.The size of the rack of baby backs was impressive, especially at $24, which came with two sides. It was lightly drizzled with the house barbeque sauce.  At our table, we also saw five squeeze bottles of barbeque sauces. I concluded that the best of these were the house sauce and the honey mustard (yellow sauce).  The house sauce had a right amount of sweetness and sourness, whereas the honey mustard had some citrusy notes which made the sauce amazing. As for the lamb shank, it was tender from the braising, but the flavors were mild and gamey.  Two sides really stood out. The mac and cheese side was one of the best mac and cheeses I've had in a while.  The pasta that was used was shell pasta. I could taste some sharp cheddar and jack cheese and a delightful crust sprinkled with breadcrumbs formed on top. The cheese didn't overwhelm this dish and it wasn't a bubbling mess - two qualities that I like in a mac and cheese. What brought this dish over the top was the sharpness of the cheddar. Next time, I might order this as an entrée! The second side that was really good was the grilled asparagus spears. They were tender, not bitter, with the right amount of saltiness and had nice grill marks for good measure. Unfortunately, the cole slaw was just okay. Nothing really special about the dressing, which I thought was applied lightly.Service at the Mason Jar was very friendly and we were left with the impression that they wanted us to return. On top of this, prices are reasonable, plus happy hour begins at 4 p.m.! How about that?",3,,1

Also their beers are reasonably priced with a couple of specials all day.I was drawn to the $2 tacos on the menu so we ordered a few.  They were pretty nasty and we all thought they just threw some canned chili on a tortilla and called it a day. The server overheard me and told the manager who then looked into it. The manager found out that the guys in the back did throw chili on tacos so he made some fresh ones and they tasted pretty good. Yes, this means that their chili stinks. My other friends had the rueben egg rolls and buffalo wings and said they were good as well.It was great to see someone take pride in what they serve and to take care of their customers when they make a mistake.",2,,3

Updated review","Sadly this place has only gone downhill in my estimation from the first couple of times we ordered from there. They have increased the price of their short rib grilled cheese into the $16 range which is a little ridiculous for a fairly small sandwich. Last time we ordered from there, they ran out of the sandwich and asked us to order something else and we got a couple of burgers. One of the burgers was completely wrong and we had to have them resend it (poor delivery guy). The one that came next was essentially raw on the inside and I like my meat medium rare but I couldn't eat this. I have been here in person for drinks once and it was okay, pretty packed and it took a long time to get a server to come by. We probably won't order from here again....",,,

A bucket of bottles came with the bill. We didn't oppose paying for the bucket that we didn't ask for but that they charge us the same rate as a draft beer. The manager became hostile. We let it go because clearly he was trying to create a scene.  I went to go pay my tab and noticed him berating one of the bartenders. This is what really got under my skin and prompted my review.

Drinks- beer is pretty much the only thing worth buying here. The cocktails are overpriced, too sweet and very weak. After my first lame ice filled Arnold Palmer, I got my favorite - water down orange juice in a glass. Some people may think it a mimosa. The problem is they put a ton of orange juice and almost no champagne. On top of that, they mix it in a pitcher so it loses all fizz. Food- the food was ok at best. This place is southern themed, and it's clear the owner need to take a sabbatical to the south. Being a southerner, I have some thoughts on the food. The fried pickles are good, but are cut too thick, and need some seasoning in the batter. My bf had the brisket grilled cheese on Texas toast. I don't think they have heard the expression everything is bigger in Texas, as the toast was tiny. Definitely not worth the $17. I had the eggs mason jar. That was actually pretty good, so no complaints there.Service - very good. Our waitress was sweet and relatively attentive. Over all, our bill without tip was $72.

Good beer selection but overpriced-- generally $7-9 for decent beers. On the other hand they have a bunch of good bourbons in the $8-10 range, which is a much better deal. I got a pulled pork sandwich, which was edible but not the best I've ever had. The weird thing is that when we got our bill she charged us $1 more than it was priced on the menu. I pointed it out to the waitress and she acted like she didn't believe me, went to confirm with the menu, and came back with the explanation that they ""produce their own menus in-house"" so there are bound to be errors. What kind of an excuse is that? It's only $1 so it's no big deal, but really odd that they wouldn't just apologize and take $1 off the bill. And I'm not even blaming her; it's probably in their computer system and she can't personally change it. So be aware that the $11 pulled pork sandwich is actually $12, and it's nothing special.

181,Sherri H.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,383,147,2.0,1/8/2013,"A group of us met here before seeing Phish at MSG, and since it's a few blocks further it wasn't nearly as packed as the bars within a 2 block radius of MSG, so that was great.  But that was probably my favorite thing about Mason Jar.  That and our waitress was very nice.We were able to snag a huge table in the back with no problem on a weekday... but we got there at 4:30pm.  It definitely filled up fast after that with the post-work crowd.  Apparently this is a big spot for Rutgers sports-watching.  After a while the fans started not only taking our empty chairs (fine, but without asking: a little rude) while we were still eating dinner, but also a large group of them sat down at our table.  I mean, we weren't at a beer hall picnic table; we were eating dinner.  We were finishing up anyway so it wasn't a big deal, but it's one of the reasons I won't return. Anyway, we ate and drank.  If the crowd had been cooler, the food still wasn't anything to return for.  They had my favorite beer (Palm) on tap, but were out of it.  But they do have a pretty good beer selection.  The fried pickles were good.  The fish tacos were okay, not great - way too much sauce & cabbage.  My bf got the brisket sandwich and found it inedible, sadly.  After his stellar review, I didn't try it myself, but it looked more like deli roast beef than brisket.",2,,
182,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1076,1948,46,2.0,9/18/2010,"5 stars for the company2 stars for the venueAverage:  2.5 stars...After a nice birthday dinner celebration at Pocha 32, we ventured into this area with our hearts set on the wine bar next door. Unfortunately, they could not accommodate our party of 8. Reluctantly, we gave this place a shot. On a Friday night around 10PM, there were many empty tables in the front. Also, there were at least 10 TV screens. The host brought us FIVE dinner menus and ONE drinking menu.   The first page of the drinking menu gave a schedule for upcoming football games. Mmmm....perhaps that was an omen of things to come. The waitress was nice, but not very knowledgeable on beers. But I guess I should observe the clientele and make some astute observations before I order an Ommegang Hennepin. And not to judge the waitress from the get-go. The were also out of Purple Haze and although they advertised 2 kinds of Duvel, they only carried the Duvel Green. And also no Chimay. The waitress claimed it was a busy night. I beg to differ. She brought us our drinks and left us alone for about 15 minutes. Then she came back and asked, ""Is everything OK? Are you guys partying hard?"" Yes, indeed we were partying hard, but I don't think I have done that since I was a junior in college. ""Spring Break, woot woot!"" And that is all I have to say about that!The NY Yankees and B'more Orioles were playing the night I was here. Who won in the end? I didn't catch the score...",14,12,11
183,Jennifer C.,"Manhattan, NY",193,327,14,4.0,10/4/2012,"I REALLY like it here.The happy hour specials are good ($3-$4 for beers, $5 for well drinks) and the bar food is fantastic (especially the english muffin burger).  I've also been here for brunch, and this its really delicious too.Compared to other Murray Hill bars, the crowd is typically a little older and less annoying, which is probably due the bar's location between madison and park, rather than on Lexington or third.Overall, I would highly recommend the Mason Jar as a great after work drink spot.",5,1,1
184,Sylvia L.,"Essex County, NJ",100,228,36,2.0,6/23/2013,"The service was good and the ambiance was good (would call it an upscale sports bar).  However the food is really lacking.  We had the fried pickles, wings (asian style and buffalo), deviled eggs, mac n cheese, mason jar egg rolls & the peach cobbler.  The cobbler was warm and decent and the fried pickles were not bad.  The mac n cheese was also pretty decent.  I was not a fan of the wings (very vinegary buffalo wings) and the deviled eggs just were disgusting to me.  Let's say I would not go there for the food.  Happy hour drink specials are nice although $8 for a small, white frozen sangria doesn't sound like much of a happy hour to me.  I did not want to find out how much it normally cost.  Some of the other beer specials were $3, which is decent.",,,1

188,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",96,191,288,2.0,10/19/2012,"Was here for a birthday last night.  I wanted to like this place, especially since they serve drinks in mason jars.  They were busy enough for a Thursday evening, with post season baseball, college football, and nfl games going on at the same time.  The waitress could have been more attentive to / available for the party, it would've been better for the establishment, her tips, and her customers.  Everyone wins.  But that wasn't the case - it took way too long for her to come back to us to place new orders for food and drinks.  Maybe they just need to have more staff?I had already ate dinner so I didn't get to try the food, they ordered corn bread, fried pickles, deviled eggs, chicken fried steak, salad, burgers / sandwiches.  By the quickness of the speed the food was disappearing off the table, I'd say they were at least decent.  It took them literally 15 minutes to make my old fashioned (p.s. the old fashioned and manhattan is not served in the mason jar), and when it arrived in the small glass, it was bland and watered down.  The mason jar lemonade tastes like juice, and the mint julep was too sweet.  Stick to the beers if you're coming here, good for watching games and grabbing some casual grub - do yourself a favor and skip the cocktails.",2,,
189,Bobby L.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,0,5.0,9/2/2016,"Great place to watch a game. Drinks and food were better then expected, especially the Cajun rub wings.

194,Johanna G.,"Massapequa, NY",539,369,20,4.0,7/10/2012,"I like this place - and I love BBQ.  We've been here a few times.  Its right around the block from my office, so occasionally we'll stop in for lunch if its slow out.  I like that they have a pretty decent menu, and its not too expensive.  I generally stick to brisket, which is one of my favorite things in the whole entire world to eat, and their's is pretty good.We've tried the mac n cheese and I LOVE the little bowl it comes in - not to mention, its delicious and cheesey.  Their frickles are good - but they have run out of them every so often (which makes jo-jo sad).The portions are rather large, so if your eyes are bigger than your stomach (like mine) you'll have enough to take home.  They have a pretty decent beer selection AND they do beer flights (you choose a selection of beers and get these adorable little glasses).  I came here off a groupon for two apps, two meals and two beer flights with someone who isn't a beer drinker (I know, I don't know how we're still friends), and she even enjoyed the beer.  Enough to get her own groupon, and come back with me.  and meet for happy hour a couple times.You do get a weird crowd here sometimes.  I was there for happy hour and there were a decent number of douchebags and skanks crowding the bar, and a guy acting like he ran midtown drinking wine (who drinks wine at a bbq joint?  Oh yea, douchebags).  I've come with a couple different groups, and each one has enjoyed the ambience and food - never had a problem with the service being slow or anything like that.",1,3,1

Waitress was very nice and attentive. Food--Very average. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly good. I think they need to work on the food, places that are just average don't last in Manhattan. On a more positive note, the portion sizes were very generous and the beer selection was great. Overall, I think think this would be a great place to go after work or for happy hour. But this is not a destination for the night or for a great meal.",,,

198,M F.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,78,0,1.0,9/28/2014,"One star because the menu looked good. Zero for everything else.Tried to go here last night to watch the USC game. My boyfriend is a Gamecock and a new transplant, and wanted to hang out with some fellow Carolina people. I tweeted at Mason Jar asking about the game, no response. They did however, tweet on their own, so they just ignored me. Nothing listed on their twitter or website about the place being closed down to everyone except the USC Alumni group during game days. We get there yesterday, a little before the game even started. Maybe 1/3 of the tables are full, and the bar is completely full. The ""hostess"" stares at me, not asking if I need help for about a full minute as I'm confused as to where we can ask for a table for dinner. So I finally ask her if she works there and if we can get a table for 2 for dinner. She tells me, ""we're full right now"". And then explains that ""they"" rented out the entire place. I said okay, so is there a wait for a table or what. She tells me they rented it out ""indefinitely"" on game nights, but we can eat at the bar. Keep in mind, the only place that has people at it, is the bar. Literally dozens of empty tables in the front and the back. Too bad, because the menu looked good, and the place looked okay. But really? Not even to tell people that the place is booked? Poor service and execution. Oh, and the Carolina crowd there was pathetic. Douchey looking frat bros reliving their glory days, and sad looking ex-sorority girls who haven't gotten married yet, and in Southern terms are old maids at the age of 24. Bye!",1,,
