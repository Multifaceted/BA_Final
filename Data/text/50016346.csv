0,Su C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,66,188,4.0,11/4/2018,"I like this location in midtown east since it's a little quieter than other SS locations. The burgers are small but pretty gourmet style compared to other fast food burger chains, hence pricey but I guess it's worth it. Their burgers are colorful and very picture-like as the the color of buns, lettuce and tomatoes are very yellow, green and redish. I also like their fries, too. It doesn't have that frozen smell. However, they need to improve on their chicken sandwiches. I have tried the seasonal spicy chicken sandwich. The chicken was huge and well fried but god, it had literally 10 tiny pieces of coleslow and 2 pieces of pickles. They need to put more coleslaw or other veggies or something! This also goes for their regular chicken sandwich- they need to put more veggies. It's just all chicken. I usually end my meal with their custradish ice cream. It's very creamy. Also, my other favorite is the SS special mast brothers chocolate. It's not too sweet and contains more cacao ans it's got the perfect darkness to it.",,,
1,Lawrence B.,"Colts Neck, NJ",934,143,241,4.0,10/11/2018,Excellent place excellent food. Prices are fine beautiful location.  Only issue is you have to wait. I ordered an ice cream.  Somehow it took 5 min to put in a cup. They know they are slow so they add a texting service to let you know when the item will slowly arrive.,9,5,6
2,Steve T.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",68,59,23,4.0,10/1/2018,"This is probably one of the best ""fast food"" burger places around.  Their burger patties are cooked perfectly and their chicken sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.  However, still haven't tried one of their shakes yet.  I especially like this location because its spacious and has an outdoor seating area which is perfect for when the weather is niceService - 4Food - 4.25Decor/Layout - 4Price - $15 pp",,,

Updated review",I have such mixed feelings about this place. I signed up for the app again and ordered the hot chicken sandwich. The time options I was presented with when I attempted to place my order at 8:40PM or so were ASAP and 10pm. I couldn't wait an hour plus so selected ASAP. I then tried to check out several times but it wouldn't let me and kept saying pick a time. It was very frustrating . I then went to the store and found out I could only order the sandwich on the app not in store but the bloody app still wasn't working. SIGH. And after Yom Kippur too when I was starving! I'm going to add a star because Davon (manager) did let me order it in store. For full price but whatever. At least I got it. UGH THEY ARE NOT DOING PEANUT BUTTER SHAKES OR POOCHINIS ANYMORE. Because some people have peanut allergies. really?!  My poor dog. She loves this stuff. At least I won't be frustrated with the app anymore cause little reason to come anymore. Anyways Davin does rock. And the chicken sandwiches are awesome. My dog loves the pooch-ini and those tend to last her a week as she's a small dog so I tend to go to this location to pick stuff up for her. For some reason the fries tend to be cold these days (maybe they are busier in summer? Idk I can't figure out why the fries tend to be cold.) but lukewarm fries blows. I went back a few times after getting the app and I have to say that it generally makes the process much more tolerable. The wait times are supposed to be much reduced with the app though a couple times I went they hadn't even started making my order yet for some reason . Like today. Ugh I have a 30 minute window for lunch and most of it is spent waiting for something I ordered on the app and actually shows up on time for. You can bet they were not even apologetic about it either. Darn.,1,,
4,Evan R.,"New York, NY",429,307,36,4.0,9/28/2018,"I have gotten delivery from here and eaten in. They are very nice workers here and the whole ordering process is very smooth. I get the Veggie which is one of the best in NYC and my little meat eaters get hamburgers and fries. Unfortunately they are always sold out of their Shroom Burger whenever I try to get it, want to try that someday!",,,
5,Arshile K.,"Toronto, Canada",87,41,97,5.0,7/24/2018,"This is everything a fast food burger can and should be. Thin but flavour-packed patties, perfectly cooked so that the meat retains its juice but still somehow falls apart in your mouth. You essentially get two flavours - the smoky, meaty taste of the char and the richer taste of the centre. In place of binding agents, super gooey cheese is combined with tomatoes and lettuce to create a deliciously junky but fresh mouthfeel. The fries were nothing to write home about. We indulged and shared a frozen custard smoothie which my girlfriend found too sweet. It was okay - pretty much as advertised, the predominant flavour being of, predictably, of custard.This place gets a 5 star review for perfecting the fast food burger. Did I mention we each ordered another and didn't even hate ourselves (much) for it?",,,
6,Liz M.,"Manhattan, NY",40,123,23,1.0,10/28/2018,"I just do not understand the appeal. This place is packed all the time. Like line out the door packed. And so we went in today on a Sunday when it was empty, ordered at the kiosk and sat down. The burger was probably among the literal worst I've ever had. The meat part was like a dried out crunchy hockey puck. It was also completely flavorless. I give the fries some credit. They were standard crinkle fries. Tough to mess up. I will never be back to shake shack for that burger, especially when there are a hundred other burger options in the city.",,,
7,Michael Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",369,24,204,4.0,7/12/2018,"Classic burger meal. Definitely way different from your regular McDonald's meal. If you want to taste each ingredient in a burger, I would definitely recommend the Hamburger. It's that kind of combo. Your choice of single or double cheese burger piled with lettuce, tomato and their signature ShackSauce. It also includes pickles, onions, and add-ons such as cheese or apple-wood smoked bacon. I mean, hell yea, it tasted amazing.Ambiance of the place was very modern kitchen vibes. I felt like I was eating on someone's kitchen island. It was that slick.Get it with a side of fries. Fries were average, but the whole eating experience wouldn't be the same without them. I also got a small soft drink to top it off. Haven't yet tried the shake, but would definitely come back to satisfy another burger craving. Overall price came out to be $10. You're getting something worth your money. :)",16,10,16

10,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,472,472,4.0,4/24/2018,"I came here for lunch on a Monday since it's near my work.  Everyone complains about the wait but if you order on the mobile app, you just order on the app and pick up at the time you choose.  There's 15 minute intervals for order pick up.  I ordered a shackburger, fries, and a strawberry shake.  The shackburger is tasty and made to order so it's still hot.  The fries are frozen and not hand cut so I'm not a fan of their fries.  The shake is thick and creamy.  It's quite pricey for fast food but the app gives out 20% off promo codes now and then.",3,,

If I'm really bad, I'll grab a milkshake. :)This particular place gets stupid busy though, so get here prior to noon or face the wrath of the crowds and it will take about 15-20 mins for food and forget finding a place to sit.

13,Jason C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,12,1,4.0,9/21/2018,The burger was really greasy and tasted a little salty but was good.  My strawberry shake was excellent.  In fact it was so good that my daughter took it. I had to get another shake and I wanted to try another flavor.  So I ordered a coffee shake and wasn't impressed.  I love coffee nips and coffee ice cream but I think their coffee shake was just a bit to bitter.,,,
14,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1672,521,984,4.0,10/11/2017,"In the world of burgers, there are sub-planets of burgers. And shake shake reins high in the world of fast food burgers. It's no wonder they are the new Starbucks of burger town- I use this reference a lot. But only when it's true.The burger is pretty solid. Size, ample juiciness, oiled but not oily, sandwiched so neatly in a soft potato bun. If you opt for the shroom-burger, essentially a portabello pattied with a slab of cheddar breaded and deep fried- you are in for a treat. Add meat and forget about it. Wanna go all out? Get a shake too. SS shakes are thick and creamy not unlike a rich frosty with decadent flavor selection.  Their fries are a bit soft for me, but others seem to like them just fine. Just ask the hundred people ahead of you in line, on pretty much any prime-time weekday or night.",1,,

So I got there, waited on the line. 2 people in front of me. Not too bad. Ordered double shack burger, cheese fries, shroom burger, regular fries, and strawberry milkshake. Waited MORE than 10 minutes. So long that I could see the monitor in the kitchen turning red (I'm assuming if it takes them more than 10 minutes, their monitor turns red to tell them to hurry up). The food was delicious, as always, but the wait was stupid crazy. I work 10 blocks away so I have limited time to wait for my food plus wait on line to place the food. Besides the wait, the food did not disappoint.",,,
17,Zee G.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,61,123,5.0,6/20/2018,So I had the hankering for a chicken sandwich- I forgot to order online so I walked in.  Was happy they have kiosks and placed my order there.  Easy and quick.  It was 1pm rush on a weekday so the wait was longer but that was expected.  That's what you do when you want a tender chicken sandwich with the cherry peppers and herb mayo.  I don't get concretes here because it's waaayy to solid for me but a strawberry malted was the perfect companion.  Of course I'll be back and to lots of locations .,1,,1

Updated review",This location has a few updates. They added the kiosk for faster ordering pleasures. The food is freshly made and the service is always . I wish they had more seating. The prices are a little more than the other locations that's why I gave it a 4 star and not a 5 star.,,,
20,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1260,5.0,3/7/2017,I been a Shake Shack fans for years but this was my first time at this location. I came in on an early afternoon and the place was crowded which was great since we all know how rare this is. I ordered my burger and shake and waited anxiously. I like that they give you a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready so everyone isn't around the counter waiting.I took mine to go since I had somewhere to be and when I got to eat it about half an hour later the burger was still delicious and amazing as always.,6,5,4

22,Nikki V.,"Stamford, CT",753,611,1932,5.0,6/13/2017,"East coast vs west coast. Shake shack is a definite easy coast must, but there have been a few locations popping up in Southern California. I hadn't had the chance to try Shake Shack yet, so while I was in NYC I decided to give it a go since it was right next door to my hotel.Walking in, it seemed a little busy. I grabbed a menu and stepped in line. Every thing is a la carte...from the burger, fries and drinks. I order the shack burger with fries and I got a beer. It just seemed like the perfect combo. My friend ordered pretty much the same but got a shake which I guess makes sense because of the name of the restaurant. Aside from beers and shakes, there also a house red and house white wines and then your average sodas. We got a buzzer and found a place to sit. We were waiting at the long table which has no chairs, but luckily found someone who was leaving. The food came quickly and it was delicious!!!!! My friend said that at the Brooklyn location, you get more food (fries and a larger shake) but I thought what I had was pretty good. Now to compare it to in n out. This place was definitely 5 stars and really good but I'm a west coast gal and in n out is still better in my book!",14,10,13

I went during lunch this past Friday and it was really busy which was understandable. Being as it was my first time, I wanted to get the full experience so I ordered a vanilla shake, shack burger and crinkle fries. The fries were pretty good and the vanilla shake was okay but the thing that I didn't really enjoy was the burger. I'm not sure what happened but the burger just didn't taste that great and it didn't sit right with my stomach afterwards.

The delay was absolutely not the fault of anyone working there - they were working incredibly fast to get the food out! - but still, bummer.But! I went up and asked for a refund, and not only did the friendly staff get me settled up, they gave me a few coupons for freebies when I next visit. Sweet!

Very simple bacon cheese burger can give your mouth the time of its life! This trip we decided to go twice.. specifically to this location because the wait time is significantly shorter than other locations (like the time square and grand central location). We opted for the classic cheeseburger and the portebello mushroom burger. Both were very delicious. The portebello one had cheddar cheese oozzing out as you bite into it every bite. The classic bacon cheeseburger was juicy and was so proportionally well with the cheese and bacon. The condiments they put in and extra add ons also looks and taste so fresh. Like that is how a classic burger should look with the crisp lettuce and juice tomato! mmmmm We also opted for the cheese fries.. the first time we had it we shared one order... but of course my fiance eats all of them!! So the next time we go we decided to order our own. To die for, crinkle cut fries, fried to perfection with a oooeey gooeey cheddar cheese sauce smothered ontop.

Lemme just say, this place sells one hell of a burger.Eating the burger, it felt like the focus was all on the patty, and that's not a bad thing. The meat was mind-blowingly amazing, fresh and grilled to perfection. All the other ingredients in the burger gave that extra punch for a great burger. The lemonade I got on the side was also amazing. Fries were a meh for me, but no biggie. Overall I loved this place. Was it better than In-N-Out? Not quite. Would I come back? Definitely.",,,1
55,Lauren F.,"Chicago, IL",113,328,518,4.0,7/7/2017,"We came here after a night of walking around mostly just for the milk shakes, after all their name is ""shake"" shack! We were lucky enough to arrive right before a ton of people (about 5min). After placing our order we waited for about 10min which to me seemed like an extremely long time to wait for a milkshake. After taking my first sip I was not disappointed though. I ordered the chocolate milkshake and the only thing I regret was not getting a larger size! My only complaint was the long wait time, I would hate to imagine how long the people who came during the rush had to wait!",,,

57,Justin S.,"Dallas, TX",26,83,12,5.0,5/28/2017,They told me it tastes different in New York than it does at their new Dallas location. I scoffed and thought it was fine in Dallas. I tasted it in New York and scoffed at myself for not heeding their words of wisdom. The fries are always good with cheese on them. The current BBQ special is my favorite item on the menu. I would like to add that the team is incredibly cordial and go out of their way to bus your table before you get up to leave. Bravo for service!,,,1
58,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,3.0,8/6/2016,"Shake Shack is without a doubt fun and tasty. The customer service at this location is friendly. The ice cream is sweet and flavorful, like calorie bombs should be.What could have been better...They have a water tap and cups - great! But the tap wasn't working. I can't and never do drink soda so I ordered a water and was directed to the tap by the ketchup. When I told the women it was broken, she says ""that happens sometimes. You have to wait."" It's August and I'm dying of thirst. That really annoyed me. She didn't offer me a water from another tap. I bought a water from a deli on my way home. So annoying.The ""concrete"" blended ice cream cups are a treat. Pete and I like ""The Jitney"" which is custard, peanut butter sauce and a crushed Tate's cookie. We get a large and share it - it's $7.50.Fix the water and I'll be back.",5,2,3
59,Phil F.,"Vaughan, Canada",58,94,194,4.0,10/18/2015,"Fast food magic. Second time at a shake shack.  I was in need for a quick bite before heading to the airport. Got the shack burger, fries and a bottle of water. The fries are cool and crinkled. Burgers are juicy, made to perfection and the bun is the perfect amount of oily.  The actual patty has those nice hard crisp edges. On momma!My only gripe with this location, is the lack of seating. I understand their stand up bar concept but since people are eating full meals (sort of), more table seating is needed. Please. If you fix this, the elusive fifth star will be added!Gotta love the old buzzer pager system. The food comes out fast but not too fast so you know it's made fresh. If you have a salty, oily craving - do it!  What I also enjoyed was their separate line up for drinks and shakes etc...",1,,

But they've messed up my order twice in a row, which I'm sour about. Of the latest, I was given the wrong burger and my cheese fries came with cheese--but no fries. There were no more than 2 other people waiting on orders so I'm not sure how that happened. I'm also at fault for not noticing until I arrived home (I got take away both times), but I hope the employees will pay more attention.Update: For that trip I mentioned above, I checked my receipt because the charge to my card was definitely too high and I was charged for a Shack Stack ($9.95) instead of the single Shackburger I ordered ($5.55). I'm baffled at the multitude of mistakes that happened in one visit (and bitter that I basically paid $9 for nothing). Customer Service reached out with an apology and a voucher (before this update) to try another visit, which I do appreciate, but really. It doesn't inspire confidence.",,,

And they were watching us like Hawks ready to pounce on our seat if were dare leave a mere 6 inch of space anywhereI got in line and made orders for everyone including mine's, I got a SmokeShack Burger , Shack Cargo Dog , Shack-made Lemonade and Fries to stay and they gave me a buzzer for me and my buddies to know when our food was ready.  While waiting the place is getting more packed with everyone not on line was standing by the order pickup and registers (unfortunately right by the condiments too), holding their little buzzers waiting for their food. The crispy fries were on point! Perfectly fried, crispy, not oily, The Shake shack burger was juicy with seared edges. And the lemonade was nice but I should have gotten a larger size instead of regular..Keep in mind that there's is some outdoor seating in the area too if the weather is nice.

63,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,4.0,5/28/2016,"It is hard to compare shake shack and in-n-out, partially because I have been living in the big apple for a while and shake shack was the first burger that I classified as quality. On one hand, shake shack has got a much more sophisticated menu, even for burger itself (shroom, chicken, regular), and you can always substitute the bun with lettuce for calorie consideration (at the cost of tastiness). However it created a bit of trouble for someone like me that always have a hard time deciding what to order. In-n-out has been consistently sticking with its simple menu since its launch and seemed like people are still buying into the hype. On the other hand, shake shack did try a bit hard in terms of expansion (into the west coast), while in-n-out simply chose to stay as local chains.For me, my personal favorite is the shroom burger from shake shack and the fries (animal style) from in-n-out. They are the types of food that I usually try to stay away from, but more often cannot help but indulge on. Super long lines during meal times, be prepared for that challenge!",10,7,9
64,Karen H.,"Toronto, Canada",142,80,176,5.0,10/31/2016,"Everyone had recommended Shake Shack as a place to eat when they heard I planned a trip to New York, so I decided to see what the hype was all about. After going through some reviews on Yelp, I thought, 'It can't be THAT good.' I was wrong. So so wrong.I came to this location on 40th and 3rd because of it's proximity to my hotel. The wait was relatively short given the amount of people and the ambience of this place didn't make it seem like a fast food joint. The tables and floors were clean and it was arranged to give the perfect amount of space. It didn't feel cramped at all.I ordered a 'shroom burger since I don't eat meat and I ordered some fries on the side. The wait time was normal given the amount of customers they had. I'm not a huge fan of burgers and fries. Don't get me wrong, I like them, but due to health reasons, I can only indulge in it once in a while. After taking the first bite of the 'shroom burger, I was so impressed. The burger was AMAZING. It wasn't greasy at all, the toppings were perfectly wrapped together, and the burger wasn't falling apart as I ate it. The mushroom and cheese were perfectly blended in a patty that was fried to perfection. The fries itself weren't too oily and didn't leave residue on my fingers. It was a good portion size too. Not too much to make my stomach feel bad, but enough to keep me full and satisfied. I am actually kind of glad there isn't a shake shack in my home town because I would probably end up eating it more often than not. It was such a good meal and I can see why it gets the hype that it does. I'll be back for sure!",,,

But we were in the need of something quick and close. Got the shakestack and it was delish! Love the fried portabella and LOVED the gooey hot garlicy cheese sauce that oozed out of it! Pretty decent burger. That sauce makes it unique for sure. Cheese fries...not that big of a fan of the cheese (but take this with a grain of salt, am not normally that big of a cheese fan...although this cheese def tasted more artificial than I thought was normal?? Would rather have just used ketchup. Fries themselves are alright, not my favorite (fiveguys still holds that spot for now).Milkshake was decent. Got the black and white. All in all it definitely offered a little bit of uniqueness in the world of burgers (THAT SAUCEEE). A little pricey if you want to order more than a burger, but it's pretty heavy and filling for sure.",3,1,3

I found a great location near the Chrysler building that looks fairly new and way less congested than the other Shake Shacks in the city. They don't have much seating, but if you wait around, you'll most likely be able to snag a seat. Shack burger vs in n out: the meat patty at Shake shack is definitely better. It tastes of better quality and has more flavor. I also like the cheese that SS uses. American with a mix of their cheese sauce that they drizzle over their fries. Their buns aren't toasted like in n out's, and the burger is of a smaller size, but packed with good burger flavor. Mmmmm!!! I usually don't like crinkle fries, but theirs are crispy and not soggy.

Unfortunately, receipts vary in cost each visit, whereas the order does not. Strange. And thr cashiers can't comprehend they're using the wrong key... like Monique. They also skeet you:1) Order fries, sucks to suck but there will never be bag fries. Ever. 2) Order cheese on the side, no worries it won't spill because it's not even filled to the top! 3) Order double ice cream, they serve you one scoop and smile. What a joke.

I was hesitant to give it a second try after a dry-bun one I had in Brooklyn during the pilot fall 2015, but this one was glorious, with generous lettuce and pickles sufficiently drenched in creamy ranch to accompany the crunchy deliciousness of the fried chicken. A little dash of hot sauce spiced up the second half. Also got the cheese fries and was pleasantly surprised with the real cheese flavor and texture of the dippable cheese sauce in its small plastic dish. But still, the cafeteria-style French fries are not really my thing, even when they come out piping hot.For the finale...the shake of the week was dreamy and creamy, stumptown coffee and cardamom mmmm...We were there for the Delta AmEx Perks freebie and were impressed with the efficiency and kindness of the staff/servers despite the overwhelming burden of Shake Shack seekers. Overall, I was happy enough with my chicken shack that I would get it again, but neither of the other two items were amazing enough for a re-order.

75,Judy S.,"New York, NY",313,1107,1132,5.0,4/8/2015,"So let's first talk about how great the burgers are and then about the location.Shake Shack (in general): Their basic burgers, unfortunately, are just average. Whataburger (my actual favorite burger chain - so much cheaper and almost just as good) has them beat on basics for sure. BUT their specialty burgers are incredible! Seriously. Don't listen to the haters and at least give it a try - you will most likely not regret it! The Shroom Stack is the most glorious thing I've ever had. The Smokeshack is a close second. It's like comparing flavorful and savory. Any of their specialty burgers is a good choice. Their fries are also solid, but their shakes are extremely lackluster.This location:I used to live in Brooklyn Heights and work in Flatiron - both have a Shake Shack location nearby. While the Madison Sq Park location was always overflowing with people, the Brooklyn location rarely had a longer than average fast food chain wait. And this is also the case at this location! We went around 7PM and barely any wait at all! Definitely a not-so-hidden treasure. On the other hand, the Grand Central Terminal location is always incredibly crowded. If you're not trying to catch a train, just walk a couple blocks and go to this one - much shorter wait.",3,1,1

79,Christian B.,"Buffalo, NY",87,13,14,4.0,5/19/2017,"I've been in Manhattan for two weeks on a business trip and visited 3 different shake shacks for a total of 4 visits. This is an overall review because they were very consistent, however, this location was the least hectic so I enjoyed it the most.Shake Shack is awesome and lives up to the hype. While 9 bucks for a double bacon cheeseburger and 3 bucks for fries sounds expensive to my Buffalo, N.Y. sensibilities, it was an average priced lunch in Midtown. They go with the thin and greasy, yet substantial, diner style patties. They're always flavorful and noticeable despite the size. Each time I visited a got a double burger of either the smokestack or shroomstack variety. I preferred, neigh, swooned over the bacon and marinated and roasted spicy red peppers on the smokestack. Tons of umami flavor you don't usually find in fast food. The buns were well proportioned and substantial () and could handle the grease and cheese. The shakes I ordered were the salted caramel and the coffee shake. They're 5 dollars and probably no more than 10oz. Both were thick, delicious, sweet and filling. However, I don't think Vincent Vega would approve of me ordering one of these ""5 dollar shakes"". Not bad, but definitely skip this 800 calorie add on if you're not feeling bougie or having a sweet tooth craving. One time I ordered a concrete (their sundae) by mistake and it was delightful as well, although there were so many ingredients in I cannot recall them all to mention. There were chocolate truffles though.The crinkle cut french fries were tres décevant. Under no circumstances, except in instances of extreme hunger or tipsyness should you spend 3 bucks on them. They taste like crinkle cut fries you buy from the grocery store shamelessly and make in the oven. 5 Guys beats them like Ramsay beat Theon... Yeah, I've read that twice and it's not an overstatement.All in all, I crave their burgers (of which, there's 4 choices). The shakes are good. The fries not so much. But the burgers are so delicious that I'm still giving them 4 stars because that's what I (and you) should come for.",,,
80,Nick D.,"New York, NY",80,508,704,4.0,3/29/2016,"Came here with my boss during our lunch break because I've been hearing so much about their Chick'n Shack sandwich I needed to try it. It's topped with lettuce, pickles; and a buttermilk herb mayo. It was pretty good sized. Maybe I thought it could've been a little bigger, but I of course just can eat a lot. I don't know if it's a fair comparison, but all we were comparing it to was Chick-fil-a. In our eyes this sandwich at Shack shake was super solid but we did prefer Chick-fil-a's a little bit more. IMO, you can't go wrong with either sandwich.",2,,1

The cheese taste just delicious in this burger. This definitely qualifies as one of the best tasting burger I ever ate. The fries taste crispy and fresh. The decor gives this place a high end look.

I had a single patty burger with bacon, pickles and onions. The meat by itself was any different. Get a patty from a store de-ice it and put it on a burger.

The cashier let my friend try a sample of a few milkshakes and didn't seem bothered. I ordered the chicken shack per usual and it did not let me down. Perfectly crispy with just the right amount of garlic mayo and pickles. I could go on and on about the deliciousness that is shake shack fries, but you know the deal. While finishing eating, we noticed one particular worker who was going above and beyond to clean tables, pick up stuff from the floor , and ask people if they were done so he could take their trays. As we got up to trash or things, he came over and insisted that he do it for us. Little things like that make a huge difference.",1,1,1

Ordering was very quick and efficient. You just place your order and they give you a beeper to let you know when your food is ready. I ordered a single ShackBurger just to try for my first time. I also got an order of their infamous Cheese Fries and a vanilla Shake. The food was amazing. The burger was perfectly juicy and the cheese was perfectly melty. The fries were well seasoned and the shake was just thick enough. Every location offers different things whether it be a different Concrete flavor or a sandwich.

After waiting 20 mins to get our order and to have to then leave to eat because of a clear and intentional lack of seating, I was truly sad to discover they had forgotten an entire burger. Someone of us did not eat and went with our lunch. The decision to select a business for your meal, especially when you have little time to eat when working, is a special trust. When a resturant has no consideration for its patrons such as ensuring enough seating and double checking its orders, it is clear that they should not earn my business. This poor attention to your customers clearly shows how you value them. Disappointing.

When those days come, I shuffle into this Shake Shack.When I come here for lunch, it's usually with co-workers. The line can get really long but it's always manageable. It can feel like a table will never open up for your party of four but for the most part, customers are also people who work in the area so they don't dawdle that much and a table will usually free up by the time you get your food. I also occasionally stop by at night when I've had a particularly stressful day. Evenings are more chill and it's easier to snag a seat. Must say, it's also way less creepy (and not at all depressing) to dine here alone, compared to the Grand Central Shake Shack.I can honestly say that everything on the menu is good. I like to have just a Shack Burger, Chik'n Shack or (when I'm really hungry) a Shack Stack.No fries because I like using the stomach space for either a Shackmeister Ale or a coffee milkshake.

I don't like to out any worker in reviews but I'm at the point where the treatment was so bad, that any place treating their customers this way should be put out there.  Not to mention the soft serve portion was sloppily made with only about 6 spoonfuls and for some reason didn't even taste as good as it usually does.  This location is a block away from me, but they lost 2 ice cream addicts.

96,Richie T.,"New York, NY",89,62,131,4.0,5/8/2016,"I ordered the single-patty SmokeShack burger (cheeseburger with Niman Ranch bacon, cherry peppers and ShakeSauce) and an Oatmeal Créme Pie shake (there's only one size of shake).  I originally hoped to get the Roadside burger after seeing photos of it in these Yelp reviews, and was a bit disappointed to see that it was a ""limited time only"" situation and I'd missed it.Note to Yelp: can you implement sorting of photos by age so the above problem doesn't happen as often?Anyway, I like burgers that are oversized and super-juicy, especially if I am paying $10 for it.  So was a bit disappointed that the size was smaller than I expected.  The bun was good, however.  They use seedless buns here, which I much prefer.  The patty was just... fine.  There were good portions of bacon but it didn't seem that fresh.  The cherry peppers were a nice touch and saved the burger from being an also-ran.I would have given this a 3-star but the 4th is for the shake.  Oatmeal créme pie is legitimately innovative for a burger place at this price point.  That was one of 4 special flavors they had during my visit, and they seem to rotate the flavors every month.  Considering the name of this place, shakes are something I'd expect them to nail, and they didn't disappoint.",,,

Much easier to come here and enjoy your meal and not feel rushed out. The menu is a bit out of the way. I feel like it would be helpful if you could glance at it while you wait on line. I went on a Sunday night and there wasn't too much of a line. The employee at the register was upbeat and helpful. I appreciated his positivity. The food is good. The service was slow, but the kindness and patience of the staff made up for it. Vanilla shake was an A+. Would definitely consider ordering a beer at this location because of its atmosphere. This location feels less fast foody. Also , I enjoy the artwork on the main wall. It's gives this location a personal touch and more of a neghborhood vibe.",,,1

When we walked in, Bobby greeted us, (a real oddity for any fast food chain), so immediately it was a pleasant surprise. We didn't know he was a manager at the time, it wasn't until we complained about a burger that we found out who he was.

Ok, it was 5pm but seriously only two other people here!The burgers were good and the cheesy crinkle cut fries something different. The shakes are the best as I thought burgers were pretty comparable to other burger places in USA. Still a nice dinner and would recommend a visit.

We've visited New York before and we knew it's a go-to place while you're here.This location was a convenient 5-minute walk from our hotel. To our surprise, there was a minimal wait and we were able to find an empty table to dine in. This was on a Friday night around 6:30pm. We ordered two burgers and fries and it definitely satisfied our craving!Maybe we just got lucky, but from our experience, I recommend this location during peak dinner hours.  Shake Shack is basically the east coast's version of the west coast's In-N-Out. It's a well known fast food chain for a reason. I've tried Shake Shack in LA but it does not compare to the New York locations.I will definitely be back next time I visit NYC!",,,

Strawberry milkshake is to die for. They also serve wine and beer which I've never tried but always want to. Hot dogs and a chicken sandwich (which is good but second to the burger) round out the mix. Crinkle cut fries are not a fav but I like fries of the skinny variety.Lines are long but move quickly.

I thought it was going to be some overcooked, fast-food burger.  Well, it's kinda true. But it's a decent fast-food burger. It is certainly better than 5-Guys, McDonald's, and the other fast-food burger chains. My burger was good. The patty seemed juicy enough and even looked a bit pink. I was surprised that they would cook it to medium or medium well. My fries were freshly made and was nice and crispy. Everything tasted good there. My only problem was the waiting time and the seating. The wait time for these burgers were long. Maybe it's not fast food. They sure take there time to make the burgers look and feel like a fast-food burger.We sat near the entrance. The weather was cold, and they have huge doors. Every time someone came in, I had a nice gush of the freezing air from the outside. Oh well, what can you do? At least I had a place to sit.

123,Publius K.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,106,2,2.0,5/17/2016,"Since Shake Shack is a chain, this review isn't specifically for the 3rd Avenue location. That said, the location is fine- it is well furnished in ""Nouveau Brooklyn"" style, but like all locations is completely lacking in seating.While Shack Shack's burgers, fries and milk (sorry, ""custard"") shakes are all good, I can't understand the lines, lack of seating, and prices. Honestly it tastes exactly like 5 Guys, and almost everyone I've been there (I've also been to Madison Park, Vesey St and UWS locations) with says the same.The hype around this place is just that, hype. It's nothing special (In-N-Out in comparison is very special). So, you won't go wrong here in terms of fast food, but you will overpay and likely have to eat standing.",1,,1

AND I think because this location is less crowded, from the few times I've been, the service seems to be better - which is always a perk as I like being served by happy people - makes the overall experience better!If you're on the east side, I definitely recommend this location.Food:Shack Stack - always my go to and favoriteCheese Burger - my friend who doesn't like mushrooms got this and LOVED itFries - if you get with cheese, get the cheese on the side, otherwise it can be a little too muchCustards/Desserts - amazingly delicious, but a little on the sweet side for meDog Treats - absolutely adorable and are amazing gifts!",,,
146,Gravas E.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",8,26,28,4.0,5/31/2015,Always love going to shake shack. I'm glad that they finally opened one in this area.Great food as always but the staff is a little rude. They could be nicer. I understand the stress from the overflow of tracking of those ordering food everyday but that isn't an excuse to be rude.Love their shackmeister burger! For an extra dollar you can order extra shallots on the side! Which is good to add on with cheese fries.,,,
147,Gloria F.,"Brooklyn, NY",89,111,34,4.0,11/25/2014,"This location JUST OPENED. When I went, it had been open only 72 hours. I went about 1130 thinking I would beat the crowd. oh no...the line was out of the restaurant. Luckily, the line was moving quickly. Once inside, I see the design of the place. Ill say I was impressed: big wooden tables, beautiful low hanging lights, plenty of space for people to wait on their order to be made. There was a very modern looking mural on the wall. The whole lay out is quite tasteful.While in line, I received a free bite of their Concrete dessert. That made everything about standing in line better :) The cashier was lovely. I know she was probably overwhelmed with the amount of people coming in-one right after another. Her attitude was so pleasant. The kitchen staff can be seen from the customers in line. everyone looks like they are having fun in the kitchen. Seriously. I had an amazing experience at this brand new Shake Shack. The food, of course, did not dissapoint.",2,1,1
148,GiaB90 ..,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,4.0,4/18/2017,Food is great customer service is good as well. Only reason I can't give this location 5 starts because I don't know why my buzzer went off saying that my food was ready and I still had to wait another six minutes for my food. The girl tried to offer a drink for the wait but I declined. If I wasn't for her reassuring me I think I would of asked for my money back.,,,
149,Valerie H.,"Houston, TX",113,329,100,4.0,10/28/2015,"Delicious like all the rest. Not very much seating, or as big as the other locations. Lots of college kids and younger crowd. The staff was fast and friendly. The line moved pretty quick too.",4,1,2
150,Evelise M.,"Manhattan, NY",113,48,1107,5.0,4/25/2016,"Fast and friendly service. Wish there was a bigger space. There was an outdoor seating area before but it is no longer available as there is construction going on. My host, Yari was really friendly and helpful and suggested what flavor shake I should get. A bit pricey for a burger joint but well worth it. Can't go wrong with a burger and shake",,,
151,Sara S.,"Atlanta, GA",2,128,73,5.0,4/15/2017,Loved their shroom burger and shakes. When in New York must try for burgers... go to Times Square outlet if u want to see big lines,,,
152,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",50,140,439,5.0,4/29/2016,"I've frequented several of the Shake Shacks in NYC, but this one is one of the most gracious, humble, unpretentious burger joints of the chain. I passed by at 10:10am on a Friday, reading and knowing their start time is at 11am.  I saw a bunch of people outside enjoying shakes and fries. I thought, are they open? No line? So, I checked it out, door open, got a burger..yes, it's early but there's no bounds with Shake Shack.. Have you seen the 1 hr wait at Madison Sq Park? I questioned the early start time and the cashier said Early Bird Catches the Worm. I was to excited to dissect the many meanings in this one and happily ate my $5 burger with less than a 2 min wait. Best way to avoid the Shack line if you're fine with an early morning burger.",,,
153,Denise P.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,375,245,2.0,11/5/2015,"Based on today's lunch, I don't understand the love for Shake Shack. Mind you other than the outlet at CitiField, where I had an ok Chicago dog, this is my only Shack experience. I thought the burger was kind of gross. The fries however were great - nice and crisp - and the folks that worked there were super nice, making sure we had condiments, etc. There were not enough seats for the crowd at lunchtime and people were circling the tables like hungry sharks, making me feel guilty for trying to eat my food at a reasonable pace and chatting with my friend. At least the price was reasonable for quasi-fast food. I think I'll stick to Five Guys.",2,1,
154,Francesca D.,"Johns Island, SC",99,187,44,2.0,10/14/2016,"I really don't get what all of the hype is about with this place. Don't get me wrong, I love a burger and fries as much as the next person, but was underwhelmed by this place. The fries were good, but the burger was so greasy I couldn't even finish it. I will give it a 2 simply because the staff was friendly, the establishment was clean, good price point and quick and easy.",3,1,2
155,Kamael S.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",48,212,34,3.0,2/21/2016,"I still prefer my West Coast In N Out, but Shake Shack ain't so bad.  I usually get my burger wrapped in lettuce (buns go straight to my buns) and the staff is pretty cool about it.  Patties can be dry at times, but overall a decent fast food burger.",,,
156,Darren B.,"Austin, TX",356,947,2625,3.0,9/25/2015,"I really had no intentions of coming here. However, I had just gotten out of the gym next door, was really hungry, and it just made sense to give them a try. I went with a burger and fries and the food was pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but good, and the service was friendly. Plus the fries somehow remained piping hot and super crisp start to finish. After my first Shake Shack experience, I genuinely do not understand what the hype is about, but that being said, nothing I had was bad and if in a pinch again, I might try them again. It wouldn't be a destination meal though.",3,3,4
157,Terry V.,"Nashville, TN",366,341,405,4.0,11/29/2014,"On my friend's last evening in NYC, we decided to eat at Shake Shack for dinner. Even though there is usually a queue when passing by the area, it moves along quite so don't get discouraged even if you see a line. I would say we waited about 15 minutes which isn't bad.Make sure you know what you want to order because the cashiers are ready for you and ready to take the next order. We had a single patty, regular fries, and a black and white shake. The shake was DELICIOUS! Very smooth. Not too chunky and sweet but not overkill. I thought that the burger was going to be bigger so depending on how hungry you are, I would suggest getting two single burgers or going big with the double with bacon. The fries were crispy and hot which is always great. The food was good and a must visit while in NYC for a quick bite that won't break the bank.Everyone was friendly. The place was super crowded but we were lucky to find a table and enjoy our meal. People were eyeing our table as they saw us finish up too! I would definitely come back here and try out another shake or two.",1,,
158,Julien D.,"Paris, France",10,62,125,2.0,12/31/2015,"Many of my friends told me this is the place to enjoy a burger, ""best in the world"". Well no sorry it's definitely not! Fries are ok, better than McDo, but it's not ""amazing"". The burger was gross, the steak was full of water/fat, with a really bad taste. The buns were just very fat and flattened. I didn't finish... Pay 13$ for this? No thanks I prefer to try somewhere else",,1,
159,Christian C.,"Nax, Switzerland",0,11,8,4.0,5/2/2016,It would take a lot for me give 5 stars but this comes close. I just love Shake Shack burgers. So damn good. I like Five Guys Burgers as well but Shake Shack are just a little better. Meat is juicier and more tasty Fries are okay but are not that important to me. It's all about the burger. Service was friendly. I will come back here on my next stopover in New York!,,,
160,Irene H.,"New York, NY",207,1154,297,4.0,1/5/2015,"The Shack burger is currently my favorite burger and I feel so lucky to be able to indulge in it relatively often. I've rarely waited in line or seen a long line, but if you go during peak lunch time, be prepared to wait about 10-15 minutes. I have learned that the double is quite a bit of meat and not to indulge too often. The crinkle cut fries aren't my fave - I usually share. After going to In n out last week and encountering a salty burger, I'm all Team SS. I gotta say, I was slightly disappointed in my last Shack burger - the tomato was cold as was the bun. Noticeably cold.",,,
161,Ivo H.,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands",5,9,14,3.0,4/22/2015,Pro: Their applewood smoked bacon and cherry peppers were really tasteful on my double SmokedShack burger. And I really liked to have a Captain Lawrence IPA next to it.Con: The burger made the bun verry greasy. A bit too much for my liking. No sauce with the fries. Having to buy everything separately makes it pretty expensive for fast food.,,,
162,Patricia G.,"Orlando, FL",345,420,841,5.0,1/19/2015,"Burger Heaven. Shake Shack just gave Five Guys a run for their money on my books!I had passed this restaurant multiple times and never tried it because I thought it was just another burger joint and being in NYC, I wanted to have something a bit more unique. Then one day I was craving a burger and then there I stood in line excited to order. When I sat down and finally had a bite I then understood all the fuss about this place. The patty was so fresh and juicy. The bread almost just melts in your mouth. The Shack sauce is simple yet exquisite. The fries were in that perfect crispy/soft texture. I had to come back a second time. I heard from my cousin the mushroom burger was amazing for those of you wanting to try a vegetarian version. Can't wait to try out the shakes in the spring. So remember, want a good burger made fresh? Go to Shake Shack, seriously.",,,
163,Brandon A.,"Saco, ME",5,6,6,5.0,8/22/2015,"I consider myself a burger connoisseur, I love burgers. Local places, home cooked, chains, you name it. When it comes to chains, I've always been a Five Guys kinda guy, but let me tell you what....It'll never taste the same after eating at Shake Shack. The red chile peppers on the Smoke Shack burger....woo! And the shakes are on point, as expected. Would recommend this place to ANYBODY who loves burgers.",2,,2
164,Grace C.,"Richmond, CA",6,92,467,4.0,1/21/2016,"Like the atmosphere here, but I still prefer In-N-Out in every way (taste, price). The shake shack burger has more choices, but the taste itself is too salty and too greasy for me.",,,

166,Carolina M.,"Atlanta, GA",121,893,297,4.0,12/9/2014,"I don't know if all Shake Shacks in NY are equal, but this one certainly tasted better than the one that recently opened in Atlanta. The differences are subtle, but overall, it's a better burger. BTW, I'm only comparing the regular Shack Burger.The beef is more well-seasoned, the bun felt softer but still tasted better than a generic bun. Maybe it was more butter or something on the bun. Granted this isn't the original Shake Shack, but it's at least proven to me that there's a reason why people talk about it. I don't think the Shack Burger is the best burger ever or anything, but it's pretty decent for fast food.",,,

Often pass by but line is too long . Anyway, so I finally got to try it. The beef is definitely beef . Is it good? Yes. Is it worth it .. I don't know. There is no combo , you have to buy everything a la carte. Fries drink etc separate. Two drinks a fries two burger and a hot dog for $29. Sounds like the price I get in amusement park.. It Is a bit pricey for burger in a fast food place. However it does hit the spot, if you craving for some guilty food.  Overall is a good burger place. You should at least try it once. It is freshly made and Everything's fresh~ no complaints except the price... I like combos~ I don't know , what about you guys? Haha",,,

I like that they get a slight crust on the meat and still a little pink in the middle. Using a few thin slices tomatoes instead of one thick cut, genius!  seriously though. That keeps the burger from sliding all over. What makes this burger over the top? The most perfect bun! Nice and spongy to soak up the sauce and juices. Fries were good, crinkle cut happens to be my favorite style. The special shake was Strawberry with graham cracker.  if you're thinking about trying it, do it!",,,1

The burgers are delicious (even though sometimes it ends up getting cooked rare) and the shakes are to die for. I just tried the newest addition -Chickn shack and it was a bite of heaven. It was very juicy and crispy and the bun complemented it well. I eat chick fil a chicken sandwiches a lot and I feel that shake shack's chicken is a great competitor. -Also it's a few cents cheaper than chick fil a's. Just wish the mayo wasn't included (tastes a bit like tartar sauce), but it's tolerable",,,
180,Jill H.,"New Hyde Park, NY",46,8,0,4.0,7/17/2015,Pretty good food here. I was expecting something totally different. I love the fact you can have a shake with your burger. I am a simple girl who gets a simple burger with bacon cheese pickle and onion with mayo and ketchup. I must have my vanilla shake with that. And that is just what I did here. Nothing crazy but it tasted good. Try comparing them to five guys I don't know the difference. I have not experienced that just yet.  They will be next on the list of places to try. As for here give them a shot. I would def come back.,1,,1

I don't know why they don't just keep track of the busiest hours and prepare for that. A couple of times, the staff knows and walks by customers and apologizes for the wait, sometimes they offer free lemonade but it doesn't make up for the long wait.",,,1
182,Benjamin H.,"Boston, MA",135,255,14,5.0,7/12/2015,"The famed Shake Shack.  They are to the East Coast what In N Out is to the West.  I think this is a bit unfair, and I will get to why in a bit.  At least from burger worship standpoint, they are the equivalent.  By all accounts, Shake Shack burger is stuff of legends.  I love their burger.I got the double with bacon, order of crinkle cut fries, and a beer.  Yes, they sell beer.  My biggest problem with Shake Shack - and why I think they don't compare to In N Out - is that this came out to a $19 and change.  Now, the beer is $5.50 so that makes the burger & fries $14.  That's twice the cost of a triple meal at In N Out.  And not any better.  Burger is memorable, and are the crinkle cut fries.  But here are the major differences:- I think of SS's burger as really really good, char-grilled burger.  INO is definitive in its taste. Not necessarily better, but definitive.- Not sure if SS's fries are the same ""fresh"" as INO.  INO literally cuts the potatoes as they make them- Half the price- Shake Shack is more of a restaurant (except the Madison Sq Park location), INO is the best of fast food, although from ingredient standpoint they're more equalSo, while I love Shake Shack and I'm still giving it 5 stars, I'm still leaning towards In N Out if for nothing other than the price.  So Shake Shack is more like 4.5 stars, rounded up.  But seriously, $20 for a burger meal is... they wouldn't do well in L.A., I would think.Table-for-1 Factor:  Even though they are MORE like a restaurant, they are still more a fast food - order at counter, get pager, go get your table, pick up your food.  So, solo is just fine.",1,,

184,Ceida P.,"New York, NY",343,57,82,4.0,6/19/2015,This Shake Shack location is definitely the best one in the city. I feel like this location has more locals rather than tourists which is great.  The line and wait for food is never too long and the food quality is just as good as the Mad Sq Park location.I love the fact that its indoors and has some seating for whether you are eating alone or with a small group.  The main caveat is that finding a seat at this location is a little tough and you kind of have to be on the look out and grab it as fast as you can.Would def recommend to anyone in the area.,1,,
185,Jerry Y.,"New York, NY",133,60,51,5.0,7/21/2015,This is my favorite Shack in the city- there is hardly a wait and the likelihood of getting a table is greater than 50% most of the time.

188,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401,4.0,7/2/2015,"I absolutely love Shake Shack but do I love waiting in line for a burger?  Probably not.  Either way, the line here moves quickly, almost as quickly as compared to their 86th street location on the UES.  However, note that this place gets packed.  Like packed in the way that you'll need to stand around and pounce on the first table you see leaving if you want to take a seat there.  Like packed with everyone standing in a corner right by the register (unfortunately right by the ketchup too), holding their little buzzers waiting for their food.  Is it better than going to their Grand Central location?  Probably.  But if it's a nice day, here's a tip - there's a lot of outdoor seating in the area.  So order a burger and enjoy the weather if you can!  As for those who have not had Shake Shack, the way it works is that you get in line, order your food, and get a buzzer.  Once it buzzes, pick up your food.  Highly recommend the shakes - they taste just like ice cream!  And yes, it lives up to the hype - all the burgers are really as delicious as they say.",,,1

Apparently, they're famous for their classic burger and shakes.I ordered said items, and was excited to take it back and try it out. First observation, is the lines are outrageously long. Like stupid long. Waiting in traffic and every driver rubbernecking an accident long.The burger is very SMALL. If it was an iPhone it would be the 3G. And surprisingly greasy too. The flavored were there though, and it was indeed tasty, but definitely did not offset the 25 minute wait from getting in line-ordering-picking up the bag and the minisized burger itself. Overall it's nothing special, the cheese fries are pretty good but for burgers, very basic. Would much rather get a five guys burger instead for way less money and hassle",1,,
190,Lauren M.,"Buena Park, CA",286,226,82,5.0,6/10/2015,"I fell in love with Shake Shack.  As a native California girl, I feel almost sacrilegious for this saying this but... I like it better than In-N-Out.  The meat patty is delicious!  It's so juicy and full of flavor.  The buns are soft and chewy - almost like hawaiian bread.  They have different kinds of burgers so you can customize... and I love those fries!  Do not get the cheese fries, though!  Don't ruin the amazing simplicity and delicious flavor of those crinkle cut fries.  You must get a shake while you're here!  I tried the Peanut Butter Shake and the special weekly shake at the time... the Pineapple Upside Down Shake.  Both had very fresh flavors and tasted exactly how they're supposed to.How can In-N-Out compete with pagers for your food when it's ready, different flavors of shakes, patties to die for, and the opportunity to add bacon?  Done and done.  Bring Shake Shack to California, please.",,,1

Every time I come to this location my burgers are dripping with oil and grease. It's like they use too much and all that comes onto the bun and soaks my bread with oil. While writing this review someone from shake shack just walked over and asked how my burger was and I told her "" it's really oily and starting to make my stomach upset "". Her response was "" thanks for the info, ill work on that with my cooks. "" what a joke. No offer to remake my burger or anything. Shake shake you can do better. I know you can.",,,
198,Jennifer N.,"Huntington Station, NY",56,55,2,4.0,8/11/2015,"Food: I have to say, I really love the shack burger. It's the right size, it's cooked to the right temp, and it has just the right amount of toppings. I am also a big fan of the potato roll. My next favorite is the Shroom burger. A fried cheese stuffed mushroom? YES. The french fries are good, but I prefer the locations with the hand cut fries. I always get cheese on the side. As for the hot dogs, the chicken dog is definitely my favorite. Shakes: Oh where to begin. I really love the shakes. My favorite is combining PB and chocolate, because when given both options how can you choose just one? I also really love the strawberry.My only complaint about this location is that it's super crowded and the layout makes it seem worse. The line can get really long and people end up out the door. There isn't a lot of seating and I often see people sitting who aren't eating anymore. This isn't the staffs fault per se, but they should be trained on how to deal with people who are essentially loitering while others who are actually eating their food are searching for a seat.",,,
199,Tom H.,"Durham, NC",10,48,11,4.0,6/13/2016,Shake Shack shell shook my tripe. They really need to figure out a way to encourage turnover though because I waited a long time to grab a seat. Perhaps releasing a slow but continuous stream of carbon monoxide through the vents would do the trick.,,,
