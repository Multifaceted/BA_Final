0,Aimee L.,"Mastic Beach, NY",142,117,561,5.0,8/4/2018,"Restaurant Week FTW! (Inside the Marriott Marquis.)My first experience at a revolving restaurant and I loved it!They have a good wine selection to choose from, my picks being pinot grigio to start with and a moscato for dessert.For some reason, we had two waiters helping us so sometimes we would get asked the same thing twice. They were both pleasant though and even moved us to a table next to the window when it became available.With the exception of the hard bread we started off with, the food was amazing. Grilled baby octopus had an unexpected crunchy texture, filet mignon was cooked correctly, and dessert (cheesecake and profiterole) was the perfect ending to our meal. I even ordered an extra dessert to take home because everything just looked so good.I'm considering staying at the hotel next time so I can enjoy my food coma with a view...",2,,1
1,Chunjai K.,"Brooklyn, NY",250,221,1720,1.0,11/12/2018,I went to the view on my birthday. My feeling told me that this place is not for local people. Only one that I like about this place is the floor that turning around and I can see 360 degrees view. Food was just ok but overpriced. The ingredients were not fresh looked like came from can. The most disappointed thing was when I paid for high price of wine I expect them to give me wine from regular bottle not from traveling backpack size. They gave me the bottle and trashy looking fake glass of wine.Not worth at all compare to money I spent.,,,
2,Sabrina F.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",271,275,324,3.0,8/22/2018,"Solid 3 stars.Came here for my husband and my anniversary dinner. Though we had reservation and made not of our anniversary, we were told there weren't any window seats. We were hungry, so we were eager to be seated.The views are not impressive unfortunately. We went for restaurant week, and started with the octopus - or should I say what octopus? I know it was baby octopus, but we literally got one peace. I don't care how much decoration, ink, or arugula you put on the plate, one teeny piece of octopus is NOT okay!For the main course, I went with the steak, and my husband upgraded for the filet mignon. I'm pretty sure my regular steak was better than his! Steak came with potatoes and carrots, which are literally the same I buy in BJ's. Also - my potatoes and carrots were pretty hard. Carrots I ate, but I couldn't do the hard potatoes.We also got the lobster mac and cheese - EW! not sure what cheese they use, but it was bitter and all kinds of wrong. I had to return it which was a shame - we subbed for the crab cake, which I wasn't impressed with either.The part of our night was probably our waiter, Luis, from Ecuador. He was awesome - super attentive, and great energy.",1,1,

Although our waitress last night wasn't the greatest and you could tell she was disappointed that we weren't big spenders when it came to the alcohol the view and the amazing meal made up for it ! I got the crab cake for the appetizer , my boyfriend the shrimp ! Both delicious!! We both ordered the steak for dinner and it was amazing !! Great flavor and cooked perfectly ! Dessert was just as great (the cheesecake , chocolate ball and a little special birthday cake !) Compared to the other few places we ate at with similar prices and similar menu this topped them all !",,,
4,Ralph S.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,107,1,4.0,11/18/2018,"Was there as a guest of one of my vendors after attending the ISCE (International Security Conference East) at the Jacob Javits Center.  Our group pretty much filled the place.  Not a big variety on the buffet, but I guess that's the deal.  Nice deserts, drinks were great.  Service for the drinks was good, too",,,
5,Joyce C.,"Waldorf, MD",80,108,96,4.0,11/13/2018,"We accepted a recommendation from hotel staff on the restaurant and we decided to give it a try. Our reservation afforded us a table with a wonderful window-side view of the city. Our first look at the menu told us that the menus was ""per fixe"" and we had to get our minds right for the cost of the meal! Once we decided that a good meal in NY was going to be close to the cost of this meal, we settled in and went for the ride. The starter was a wonderfully prepared lump crab cake with a unusual slaw. Very flavorful with no fillers. The main course was a double cut pork chop that looked so wonderful o forgot to take a picture until after my first two bites! It was flavorful and well prepared resting upon a corn, potato and bacon medley. Dessert was a beautiful but confusing conglomerate of apple strudel with apple sorbet wrapped in an interesting coating. There was a lot going on with the dessert but ok. Our table service was attentive, respectful and elegant. Definitely worth the trip!",,,
6,Najwa G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",52,144,279,4.0,6/22/2018,"Went here with a friend and I'm really glad he took me- it really is a lovely place (despite some qualms, will get to that later). The place itself is beautiful BUT definitely do yourself a favor and go in the nighttime. It's not half as pretty as it is in the nighttime just like any skyline is to be honest. The place rotated very slowly (which is obviously a good thing) but you can tell that you're moving. The funny part is that the male and female bathrooms are on two polar ends so whenever I went to the bathroom it was either the first door I saw in the middle of the restaurant or the last door (probably didn't explain that right but if you ever visit this place you'll know what I mean).We got the 3-course prix fixe that I believe was a little under $100 per person. Yes that's pricey but I think on occasion it's worth it (depending on the place of course)! Anyways, for the appetizer I got the crab cake. Seriously, SO good. Perfect size and everything- loved it and can't say anything bad about it. For the entree I got the braised lamb shank. To be honest if the appetizer and dessert weren't delicious, I would've given this place three stars. The portion was great, way more than adequate. However, the lamb shank itself lacked any real flavor in my honest opinion. The couscous didn't help adding to the flavor either. I can't inherently say that the meal tasted bad, but one can't say that a flavorless meal tasted good. For the dessert I got the profiteroles. Whenever a restaurant has profiteroles, I am most definitely ordering them because 1. Hard to mess up and 2. Typically always delicious (as they are hard to mess up lol). Profiteroles are typically a cream puff with vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce BUT this place has a variation on the classic recipe which I ended up surprisingly enjoying a lot. The two major changes were dulce de leche sauce versus chocolate sauce and a raspberry-based cream puff versus the traditional plain one. I thought I would either hate it or love it and I definitely loved it- get this!!! The service was as expected (great, couldn't complain) and overall, I'm glad my friend took me here. To be frank I thought maybe the food would completely be a miss as I know the place is very touristy but overall I can't say I was disappointed. There are also many options for the appetizer, entree, and dessert i.e. definitely something here for everyone.",8,4,9
7,Angela L.,"New York, NY",289,221,186,5.0,4/24/2018,"If you want to impress your significant other, take them here. This lovely restaurant not only has amazing food but amazing views as well! And with a rotating floor, you get to see midtown Manhattan at different angles!I went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend and we loved the food. We made a reservation with Open Table which asks you what the occasion of your dinner is. So after we finished our entrees, they brought out a chocolate cake that said ""Happy Anniversary""! I was pleasantly surprised. On top of that, we had dessert that was part of the pre fixe. The dessert that has apple in it (I forget what it's called) was beautiful to the eyes and tongue. I had the salmon for my entree...GET THAT! It sits in a soup with noodles so it has an Asian flair. It was the best thing I've ever seen paired with soup. Enjoy yourself here, take pictures, try not to cry about the price lol.",4,1,1
8,Alex B.,"Queens, NY",142,51,176,3.0,5/1/2018,"Overall: I'm conflicted between amazing views hence the perfect name and subpar food for the price. Price is comparable to a 2-3 Michelin star restaurant; however food is not there.Hence, I think the lounge for drinks would be the best alternative to enjoying a nice view with a small bite rather than a 3 course meal or buffet. Atmosphere: beautiful views as you can see from pictures. Definitely perfect if you enjoy being within the New York City skyline, slowly cruising with views of the Hudson, East River, and everything perfect in between . Food:Okay- there is definitely better especially for the price. Again I really think you're paying to sit and admire the city skyline for a few hours rather than a  top notch food experience. Bread- standard - could definitely be more fresh, at least heated. 1st course foie gras - sweet pineapple twist, standard taste , side pita chip? cracker? Would pair with something more complementary like fresh warm bread.2nd course- Duo chicken with confit. Delicious , juicy paired with steamed carrots and spinach. Spinach is a bit salty. Good.3rd course - I got a cheese board- 5 pieces , was good... it's hard to mess up cheese boards... and served with crackers... could be more fresh. Service: water filled in a timely manner. Would likely return and spend more time in the lounge.",1,1,1
9,Bella A.,"El Cajon, CA",179,175,511,3.0,7/20/2018,"The view here was amazing! This bar spins and has a view overlooking the city. It was so nice to sit here and have a cocktail while watching the sunset!The service was okay and their food selection was not the best. They had a buffet which did not look very appetizing and they had 2-3 options to order if you just wanted to have cocktails and snacks. We trie the shrimp cocktail and I have to say that it was not the most fresh shrimp I have tasted. I really enjoyed watching the view and sunset while having a few drinks, but i would not recommend eating dinner here.",2,,
10,Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",595,524,3517,2.0,2/7/2018,"I came here with friends for the restaurant week event; this is not my first revolving restaurant since I have been plenty of times to the one in San Antonio, TX I was here to experience the food and a little bit to enjoy the view ofc.the place is located at the top of a hotel in the middle of times square and they have free coat check before taking the elevator to the main restaurant room. the elevators are super cool and look like those vintage mail capsules going through the pipes, pretty insane speeds they have these elevators. there are plenty of these elevators so going up is not a hustle like at the one in San Antonio that only counts with one elevator. the place is a very beautiful one, the tables are well set and the staff is super nice. the view is ok, the tables are not right next to the windows so the view is from a far. now lets go to the needy greedy. the menu and drinks.- PINEAPPLE CAIPIRINHA- wrong wrong wrong, I am Brazilian and I know a caipirinha when I drink one, and this was not a caipirinha, they made it with some cheap liquor that I am not even sure what it was, if they used cachaca they better rethink it. it tasted horrible. as we were there for the restaurant week the below are the items I picked from the pre fixed menu, I am not sure if they sell these on a regular basis but here is my take on what I had. - LOBSTER BISQUE- super salty! it had some butter also on the side for taste and beauty. it was ok but way too salty. - COD- it came with parsnip and some free risotto, both had no taste at all, another case of the missing salt in these sides. the cod itself was dry and I didn't even want to eat ti anymore as I was full of salt from the bisque.- PANNA COTTA - it is some relating thing and this was the only thing I truly liked from my meal, my friends did not like this one but I did. it tasted fun and came out so pretty like a tiny wedding cake. this desert was very delicious with a hint of vanilla and some eatable flowers (that I most certainly ate!) ***THIS ONE WAS NOT ON THE RESTAURANT WEEK MENU.- MAC AND CHEESE WITH BACON- this dish was pretty good. go figure, the one thing we had the was not on the prefix menu was something we all liked, but hey, it is pretty hard to mess up Mac and cheese. I was going to chose to come back here solely based on this experience I would not to, there are plenty better restaurants in the city that cost way less with way better food. it was ok to try once but I don't know if I would recommend for the foodies out there.",8,6,4
11,Dona F.,"Staten Island, NY",26,221,639,3.0,2/20/2018,"There were 8 of us here celebrating my moms 90th. The clear glass elevator ride to the top of the Marriott was lots of fun. Kind of like Willy Wonka. Amazing view from this slowly revolving restaurant. Service was good. We went for the price fix of $89 which will be more if you have a drink or two. Food was ok not the best I've ever had but an interesting selection. We had appetizers of shrimp cocktail, yellow tail tuna crudet, fried ravioli - all kind of small portions. Mains were salmon, braised lamb shank which everyone loved, seafood paella which was good. I had the filet mignon which was a bit over cooked even though I requested rare. The add on extras we had were baked potato with Mac and cheese. A little disappointing because it was dry.  The jumbo asparagus was delicious Desert seemed to  be everyone's favorite part. Panna cotta which is a pudding with fresh fruit was fantastic. Good cheesecake. NYC Apple wasn't really an Apple but chiffon flavored apple with ice cream on the side. Not bad. Very different. This place was just too expensive for me to go back to. I'm not a tourist but wanted a special place for my moms birthday which this was. Very memorable.",1,1,1
12,Michael G.,"Bellaire, TX",2,88,23,4.0,7/22/2018,"My wife and teenage son came here for dinner tonight and had a nice time - the service was very good as well as the food.  It's not a high-pressure or overpriced place for being in the middle of Times Square, as for approximately $90 each you get an appetizer, entrée, and dessert.  The food was very good: each of us got a filet, and our variety of appetizers complimented the meal.  You can order additional sides - we got an order of mushrooms - but it really isn't necessary to order the sides as your main course comes with sides, also.All-in-all, a very nice restaurant with a great view and reasonably priced.",,,
13,Dottie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",141,326,756,3.0,1/29/2018,"We only had drinks here and it was really cool! Great views of the city that changes every second because the restaurant turns slowly.

14,Zabrina L.,"Charlotte, NC",105,69,92,5.0,7/15/2018,"The view was simply amazing.  If you go to NYC, you'll definitely want this as part of your stop.  The drinks are great as well.  In case you don't know, the restaurant spins around so you can take in the views 360 degrees.",,,
15,Allison P.,"San Ramon, CA",105,55,264,3.0,8/11/2018,"We waited in line for approximately 25 minutes to take an elevator up to the lounge. The restaurant and lounge need a little updating, but the view is beautiful. The entire restaurant rotates 360 degrees over the course of an hour. The drink menu wasn't very impressive and a bit overpriced. We didn't order food, but were sitting next to the buffet that looked pretty standard. A good place for a quick drink and to enjoy the view.",4,1,1
16,Bridgette S.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",254,133,287,5.0,4/23/2018,"An extremely lovely restaurant to come to when you want to sit, enjoy company with drinks and beautiful views. The View is the perfect name for this restaurant as it is a revolving restaurant to view the city's skyline from the 48th floor of a hotel. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday for appetizers and drinks. We split the charcuterie plate and I ordered a margarita--very yummy, slight, citrusy and honestly quite strong, they did not skimp out on the liquor. My SO ordered a tall beer. The charcuterie plate included blue cheese, brie, proscuitto, salami, olives, bread (kinda hard and cold), and jam. Not the best platter ever, but definitely hit the spot :)) We had a lovely time here and I 100% recommend coming to this spot to relax and spend some time with people you love.",2,1,3
17,Yixuan H.,"Boston, MA",69,119,441,5.0,10/12/2017,"Unforgettable experience, above average food. Come for the revolving rooftop view of nyc. Service: 5/5My boyfriend made a reservation for us on a Saturday night at 6 pm - this was perfect timing since we got to see the sunset. I suggest making a reservation and asking for a window view. You enter through the Marriott hotel and take an elevator up to the 48th floor. When we got to the top we were seated immediately. The view when you first sit down is not that great, but it gets better as the restaurant rotates. The food was served quickly, and the waiters were quick to clean our plates. Servers were very friendly and accommodating to the customizations I requested for my meal.Ambience: 5/5Great great GREAT ambience. There are huge windows so that you can see the skyline. Can't remember if they played music but if they did it was not overwhelming.Food: 4/5Okay I will be honest I am not a fan of food at really high end places and have never really had great food at any place that has more than $$ on it. HOWEVER, I will say that my meal her was the best ""fancy restaurant food"" I've had. It's a set three course meal. I got an octopus and watermelon appetizer. It was interesting combination and thought it tasted decent. Boyfriend got the gazpacho - tasted average. For entree I got a lamb shank with creamy polenta and asparagus. I love lamb and I thought this was very well done. It had some sort of citrus seasoning, which tasted fantastic with the meat. The portion was also huge... The polenta and asparagus were very normal.  Boyfriend got some sort of cod dish. Was all right. We were pretty full by the time dessert came around so we shared a pavlova with a coconut and mahogany mousse thing and also a sherbet on the side. Very yummy. The sherbet was some.kind of tart grape flavor which we liked. We also got a cheese and crackers plate to go but forgot it at the hotel so we didn't actually get to taste it. But it looked very decadent!! Overall great experience. Very very pricey, but what do you expect for a place like this. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion :)",3,1,1
18,Javier M.,"Wayne, NJ",166,12,2,5.0,11/3/2018,"I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, and this place did not disappoint! From the views to the service to the food, everything was on point. They were even nice enough to bring us a happy anniversary desert cake at the end. I definitely recommend this place for any special occasion.",,,
19,Tiffany Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",137,200,364,3.0,3/25/2018,"Interesting concept for a restaurant. My husband took me here for my 31st birthday after a co worker recommended this place. The restaurant is located on the 47th floor of the Marriott Hotel smack in the middle of Time Square. Needless to say, If you're driving, I suggest you park somewhere far away and just walk...if you're from the area, you know what a nightmare Getting through Time Square is. Anyway, since we had reservations, we were immediately sent up to the restaurant. If you don't have reservations, you can wait in line to grab some drinks and enjoy 'the view'. Unfortunately, even with reservations, we didn't get to sit by the window which is really where The View is. We were given a napkin with what we're seeing as the floor rotates 360 degrees. It takes an hour for a full rotation (slow rotations) and you get a view with all the skyscrapers, Times Square, Hudson River, etc. Enough about the restaurant, the service, I have to say, was great...considering there was only two of them in the area that I was seated at. While the waiter was busy, he still made sure my husband and I had everything we needed. I wish I could say the food was amazing, but it wasn't something I'd go back for anytime soon. We opted for the pre-fixe menu which was $89pp...this includes your appetizer, entree, and dessert. I started off with a kale salad..then the seafood paella and finished off with the Panna cotta. Kale salad- not really all kale. It was just a bed of veggies with pumpkin and pomegranate seeds. My seafood paella...was good. But I really only ate the seafood: two scallops, 4 shrimps, two large steamed clams, on a bed of funky looking rice?  The rice was way too oily for my liking and I really couldn't stomach it after seeing all the oil at the bottom of the plate. My dessert I had to go which was OVERLY sweet. It was a vanilla pudding with fresh fruits and some sweet honey sauce that was way too over the top. My husband got the lobster bisque to start, which was different....it was very liquidy to be lobster bisque and very salty. The sirloin steak he got came with an awesome side dish of a baked potato with Mac n cheese and bacon-I mean this was probably the best dish.Service wise I'd give a 5 star because there were only two of them waiting on at least 8-10 tables. Food and restaurant experience, I gave 3 stars because the views wasn't that amazing..from my view, seeing the top of skyscrapers and looking out the window like I was staring at others eating dinner didn't do it for me. It was a nice experience and very thoughtful of my husband to take me here. Unless you're sitting by the table (which I don't think you can request), you'd have to get up and walk to the window to see 'the view'. I'd probably come back here just for drinks..I might have a better chance at getting a seat by the window to actually enjoy the view.",7,3,6
20,Betsy M.,"Vail, AZ",87,587,880,4.0,3/5/2018,"We locked in on The View after reading reviews and looking for a 'Time Square experience"" that was memorable.  I was hesitant in the 11th hour given it was my sister, me and her 2 very young kids (4 & 6) but we decided the splurge was worth trying to keep the kids wrangled in.You take a special glass elevator up to the restaurant, which is two stories... one for the lounge, the other for the restaurant.  The restaurant is downstairs, and we were warmly greeted by the hostesses who were incredibly engaging with the kids.  Our table was a great one, tucked in a corner right on the outer edge of the revolving restaurant.  The views are lovely, even though this particular night there was a winter storm occurring.  The kids were a bit disappointed that the revolving was not faster (which was pretty funny since it is definitely fast enough).The service was fantastic, and our server took great care of us and understood how to manage out table with the kids.  They brought crayons and a coloring mat for each of them, AND they had a great little kids menu which was unexpected but wonderful.  Additionally, they whipped the kids meals up quickly (pasta/olive oil and steak/mashed potatoes) and brought as soon as it was prepared.  My sister and I each did the prix fixe - starting with the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail, where the prawns were enormous.  It came with some delicious pickled cucumbers and toast.  One of us did the filet mignon, the other the top sirloin.  The filet came with their heavenly mashed potatoes (not sure how they got them so light and fluffy), the sirloin came with a huge baked potato that had their house mac/cheese on it.  We had actually ordered the mac/cheese shareable in case the kids were picky about their food.  It was very good.  For dessert we did the  cheescake and the Panna cotta, which were both divine.Overall this was between a four and five star meal.  The food itself was very good, but I can't go with outstanding in comparison to other meals I have had.  The ambiance and service however were on point.  The fact they were so great with the kids in such an upscale environment was meaningful.",3,1,3
21,Valerie H.,"Medford, NJ",0,14,0,2.0,11/13/2018,"On November 3rd, we came for dinner and a show for my son's birthday.  I would love to be able to give this restaurant a 4-5 stars review but..The food was delicious. Great sauces and a nice menu having something for vegetarians, people needing gluten-free food and carnivores, like me. I had the surf and turf both cooked perfectly and delicious. The sides were great (family style) and unique as well as the usuals.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip desert!  I think our table of six had every desert on the menu and everyone licked their plates!  Yummy!  Table service was great also. The rotating floor and the views are breathtaking.  If you can be there at sunset, you get a very dramatic show as the sun sets.  And the movement is not noticeable.  The floor moves very slowly and it is not at all disturbing. Instead it is fascinating and beautiful. Nice decor. Very clean and comfortable.  One problem, since we own a lighting design firm, they need new updated lighting. Especially the track lighting on the walls that play a huge part in the effect since there are short times when the view is blocked by buildings (2 times?) and the lighting makes the wall visible in the windows so you're not looking at a blank building and invisible when there is a view. NOW, THE REASON I GAVE YOU A 2 STAR RATING....I have very bad knees (both replaced) and ankles, making climbing stairs very painful.  When you get to the restaurant, the elevator ride, (glass encased elevator), is very exciting.  Don't face the window if heights or roller coasters are a problem for you!  You arrive on the 48th (?) floor and have to walk down a circular staircase to get to the restaurant.  Very painful for me but down is easier than up, plus it can be embarrassing to ask for a special elevator ride.   At the end of dinner we got up from our table at 7:40 because we had 8pm tickets for the show across the street at the Minskoff. I chose to ask them to take me up in the elevator they had for the handicapped at about 7:45.  At 7:55, after telling the host and hostess that I was still waiting for the 3rd time, I opted, unhappily, to struggle, painfully, up the stairs rather than be later for the show.  Thinking the entire time what a shame it was that after a perfect meal with my family, costing us about $1000 for 6, (and we don't drink much at all), that the only problem was that I had to PAINFULLY struggle up a flight of stairs rather than ride an attended elevator that would take me up one flight!  When you charge that much for a meal the staff should make darn sure the entire experience is as close to perfect as possible. Seeing 3 staff people standing around the host station as I waited anxiously, did not help.  They were polite and called 3 times for the elevator attendant.  After I limped up the stairs a staff person said ""Oh, I just went down to get you.  I had to wait for the elevator.""  I'm not sure how the elevators are programmed but being in construction my husband's private response to that was ""bull sh... they can easily fix that."" No one should have to wait 10 minutes for an elevator.  We had sent our adult children across to the theater so they would be on time for the curtain, but for me, it put a real damper on what was otherwise a perfect dining experience.  It's a real shame to spend that much on a dinner to have it end on a painful and frustrating note. People with handicaps should not be treated with so little regard and care!  Once we paid the bill and tipped generously, I felt as though your staff felt I was unimportant. In spite of their politeness and apologies, I felt embarrassed, frustrated and disrespected.I am happy to adjust this review once I see a response from your management.  I felt it was important that management know that there is a problem with your way of handling this issue, especially in the theater district before 8pm when most curtains go up!  Please respond and I will adjust my rating and hopefully feel much better about the experience at your beautiful, unique and convenient restaurant! Thank you and sorry for the length.Valerie H.",,,
22,Susan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,2.0,7/30/2018,"The only reason this place should get stars is the location. It is cool to be up high in a revolving restaurant, being able to see all of Manhattan.Even the decor on the inside of the restaurant, though, was lacking (the carpet that looked like it was from the 80's, for one). It is very clearly a restaurant in a hotel (it's located in a Marriott). It's pretty confusing to get to as well.My friend and I went for Restaurant Week, so I suppose it's possible we got less than average quality food because of that. However, the price was still in the $$$ range, and it was not a deal whatsoever. The vegetables with the main course looked like they had been cooked at least a day ago, the steak was decent but I've had way better for less, and the dessert (sorbet) looked like it was straight from a container. The drinks were ~$20, which is expensive even for NYC standards (the drinks were good, strong, but very small). We had a nice time because of the view, and each other's company, but that's pretty much it. The only other positive was that the staff was nice and the service was quick. This place could really benefit from a makeover and an updated menu, because it has the potential to be quite nice. How it is now, I wouldn't recommend.",1,,1

25,Christian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",672,199,205,5.0,8/7/2018,"I made reservations here for the first time to celebrate my lovely lady's birthday. This beautiful restaurant sits on the 49th floor of the Marriott Marquis hotel. Dinner in the reserved section is a 3 course prix-fixed menu. The main attraction to this particular restaurant is that the floor revolves and shows you a 360 degree view of the Times Square area. We had two servers who were both very accommodating and very nice. Our reservation was for 5:00 because we had tickets to see Wicked at 8:00pm. I mention that because I'm sure the ambiance is much more romantic in the evening overlooking the Time Square skyline which we were unable to see. Nonetheless the experience was magical. We ordered their signature drink ""The View"" and I highly recommend you try it. For dinner she had the Filet Mignon and I had the Lamb Shank. We both enjoyed our meals very much. We took our time enjoying our food and never felt rushed to leave. We actually spent 2 hours there enjoying the food and each other's company. For dessert we both ordered the cheesecake with strawberries, however they also surprised her with a mini chocolate birthday cake which she took home with her. The food was so good it nearly evoked a coma. We quickly asked for an antidote...coffee and was able to find the strength to leave. Everything was perfect for her to enjoy her birthday and that made me happy as well. We'll certainly be back to enjoy more menu items and the seduction of the evening ambiance.",,,
26,Kristín M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",121,73,105,4.0,2/6/2018,Went there for restaurant week last night (3 course menu for $42 wohooo!)The food was good (but maybe not extraordinary like I'd expect from a $$$$ restaurant) and the service was not nearly as good as at most places I go to in NYC. Maybe it was because we were there for restaurant week but it was really hard to get a waiter (to ask for water or for the check or anything). But the view was really nice. I'd go there again for the price I paid last night but maybe I'd choose another place for the regular price (but I'm also a student so...),2,1,2
27,Jadene P.,"Cincinnati, OH",74,66,38,3.0,10/14/2018,"Good service and interesting view.  Not the best sky view I've seen from a rotating bar, but the service was great.  Food and desert options were interesting and there's a dessert bar and food bar for those who are hungry.  It's worth stopping by, but not something you'll be crushed if you miss it.",,,
28,Chrissy L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",150,10,21,3.0,2/13/2018,"I was so excited to go here for restaurant week and my friends from Texas were in town so I thought it would be a perfect choice. The view of course is basically what you're paying for, especially if you are here for a regular dinner. The food just didn't leave me in awe like the view. The presentation was very nice, but the food should follow through from presentation to taste.I started off with the Lobster Bisque, my friend had the crab cake (+12). The crab cake was good because there was little to no breading so kudos to them for that. My lobster bisque was good as well, very rich and creamy consistency (not pictured). The bread they bring at the beginning was hard as a rock, honestly could've thrown mine in the microwave. For my second course I had the chicken (pictured) which was a huge breast and a few Brussels and fingerlings. The breast was overcooked, I know it's hard to get a huge breast to stay juicy but come on this is a nice restaurant. Also added a side of bacon Mac ($9), which needed a bit of salt but the bacon and little tomatoes on top provided this sweet and smoky taste, which I did like. For dessert I had the Pana Cotta which was very light and airy, not as decadent as I would've liked but a nice finish to the dry chicken. All in all I would only go here for ""The View"" to show people from out of town, but maybe just for dessert.",2,,
29,Theresa B.,"Washington, DC",637,487,1254,4.0,7/3/2017,"Okay so first and foremost, this is a REALLY EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT. It's a bit of a tourist trap, located at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, and our bill for two people came to $340. If you're no longer interested after hearing that, you're a smarter person than I am, and you should skip it.But if you come in knowing how pricey it will be and you're totally fine with that, I do recommend it for you. Cost aside, our experience was quite nice. Of course, the primary attractor here is the fact that the 48th-floor restaurant rotates. It rotates very slowly - about one rotation per hour, and it's not like you're looking out the window and seeing straight down, because there are tracks upon which the restaurant is rotating and the tracks are much wider than the restaurant. So if you look straight down, you're just looking at the bottom of the tracks.The views are pretty good - not top of the Freedom Tower good, but good.The menu was prix fixe at $90 per person. This included an appetizer, main course and dessert. Cocktails were $18-19 each.For drinks, I got the View Fizz and the Cocktail d'Estate, both of which were tasty but definitely did not contain $19 worth of alcohol.My meal: crabcake, aromatic duck, and cheesecake. I also ordered a non-included side of lobster mac and cheese because it's my favorite and at that point, realizing how much I was about to spend either way, the extra $23 didn't seem like it would make much of a difference lol. Everything was tasty enough. The rolls were super stale, but that was my only real complaint about the food. I didn't actually eat my cheesecake because they ended up bringing me a surprise dessert after overhearing it was my birthday weekend. Sweet gesture, and I'm not quite sure what it was - some type of large chocolate cheesecake torte - but it was yummy, and way too filling to leave room for the actual dessert I had ordered.We ended up getting a window seat, but if you don't, it's totally pointless. Had we not, we definitely would have just left.A nice place to go for a special occasion. Or a Tuesday, if you're Harvey Specter.",12,5,3
30,Alexandria D.,"Danville, CA",193,85,23,2.0,2/5/2018,"Great location and obvious view. We went for our anniversary, didn't realize it was restaurant week and opted to go for that menu. Our waiter was kind to me but very rude to my boyfriend, didn't offer the same additional commentary on the menu to us and we overheard him doing to other tables. My boyfriends steak was very bloody, too much for his liking so he asked for it to be slightly more cooked. The waiter said ""this is how we serve it"" despite us hearing him ask the next table over how they want their steak prepared. That kind of set an off tone for the rest of the night. The drinks were okay at best and the food mediocre, would not come back.",1,1,1

The view was good to begin with but later it didn't matter anymore. The dessert was horrible. For the price we paid, we didn't like much. The tip that we left was way more than a much tastier NY brick oven pizza. I would not recommend this place or go back. The drinks were separate charge and way overpriced. The service was great though.",,,
32,William J.,"New York, NY",276,112,78,2.0,6/13/2018,"Absolutely phenomenal concept for a restaurant, and the views are great, but the food is just not good enough to warrant the pricing. It's strange because the wait staff seem like seasoned professionals, and they allegedly have talented chefs designing the menu. Perhaps it's an issue with the line cooks or the ingredients. I'd recommend going for dessert only and doing the buffet. It's a third the price, the views are the same, and you're not putting up with three courses of disappointment.",1,1,1
33,Stephanie M.,"Jersey City, NJ",164,86,52,3.0,11/18/2017,"I'm only giving this place 3 stars because of the view. Yes this place is beautiful and while it is a  restaurant in the middle of Times Square with a breath taking view, the food really doesn't live up to the expectations. The food is fine not great or anything out of the ordinary. This place is really all about the view and the experience. Cons: it's extremely extremely pricey!! About $100 per person and you're really just paying for the view and experience because the food really isn't all that great.",6,2,2

If you have a chance to dine at this place you definitely should. It is a good place to go to for anything from a birthday dinner to a romantic date. I had the steak and it was tasty and cooked perfectly. The crab cakes were good and I also got to taste a friend's chicken which was also good. For dessert I had the cheesecake,I am not even a fan of cheesecake but I must admit it taste very good. I definitely will be going back here to dine.",,,
35,Jenny R.,"Newark, NJ",2,131,124,4.0,7/1/2018,The food was excellent. The appetizers were yummy and our steak was done to perfection. It was a big piece that I was unable to finish.

36,Alicia M.,"New Orleans, LA",1,67,31,2.0,10/6/2018,"This restaurant is located in the Marriott Marquis, which is where we stayed. They offer a prix fixe menu at $89/person. There are ample selections for each of the 3 courses, but the portions were small. The complimentary bread was really hard to chew. I was disappointed to find out that they added gratuity regardless of how many are in your party. We only had 2. The check said gratuity was already included, but that was a lie. When I got my hotel folio, there was an extra $40 added to the final price. The wait staff was okay and we had some long waits at times. The views weren't the best. The Marriott Marquis sits between and bunch of tall buildings, so that's pretty much what you're going to see, the inside of a bunch of buildings. Also, it's evident that the revolving restaurant was a modification and not included as part of the origins building design. I've been to several other revolving restaurants and they all had a circular shape. While The View is circular, it sits inside the square frame of the building. When we reached the corners, it was hard to see much past the cement and metal framing.",,,

Updated review",First of all they never told us that there's a cover fee witch is 8$ per person. Then the waitress was pretty rude and we waited for our check like 20 min. Not to mention that this place is not for everyone cause it makes you sick to your stomach. Me and my friends felt  sick for an hour after we leftAnd afterwords a terrible food poisoningNever again!!Stay away from this place,,,
40,Laura Z.,"Watertown, CT",15,9,1,3.0,9/23/2018,The view was amazing and literally just the view  . And that was just about it .  There was no directions when you entered the marriot it was hard to find .we were told go to the 3rd floor but no one explained that you had to go on a different elevator to the resturant.   And the food was ok but me and my husband spent $400  it wasnt worth it You are paying for the view not for the food . And the waitress seemed pushy.  She would say for example add this on for only 20 and then add this for 10 and when you get the bill your like what the heck .  When we called to reserve we asked about parking she said there is valet but did. Not mention that it cost $75. And since we were running late due to heavy traffic bc Broadway shows we parked there.  And after a while I honestly felt dizzy looking at the walls moving .,,,
41,Atlant S.,"Chelmsford, MA",1,13,7,1.0,4/28/2018,"While the view is amazing the VERY limited menu, and VERY limited buffet were just not worth the price.

42,Julie F.,"Manhattan, NY",17,106,105,2.0,4/16/2018,"Never. Again. Believe the reviews - the only reason to go is the view. Even that is a minor consideration when balanced against food choices prone to running out and incredibly rude staff with major attitude issues. It's like they know they'll get a tip regardless, hence just go through the motions. Oh. Wait. They do know. The kicker was the waiter putting a napkin in a fully grown person's lap way before the food came. Um. What's wrong with you?!?Was hosting a family from Europe and thought they'd enjoy. I could tell they were shocked instead, although they tried to hide it.The menu, too, is on the meh side. It's like a rotating TGIFridays more or less. The venue itself deserves a much better ambiance and staff. The entire time felt rushed and pressured. As I said: NEVER again.",3,1,1
43,Jose R.,"Miami, FL",0,44,1,4.0,6/29/2018,I made reservations with some doubt after reading the reviews but I was pleasantly surprised and had a great experience.

The only negative was the windows needed cleaning to remove weather residue / film to better appreciate the view during the daytime. I would definitely recommend bringing the wife/ girlfriend to watch the sunset.,,,

I can see why people give some bad reviews, window seats are about everything in this place, but you're not guaranteed even with reservation, so I would say make an early reservation and show up ON TIME - cuz there will be a lot of people checking in! Which probably is the only thing that made me gave it a 4.5 star... friendly staff, but checking people in is somehow really slow....otherwise it would be a 5 star experience.

47,Rona R.,"Alexandria, VA",161,84,819,3.0,2/23/2017,"My brother, sister-in-law, and I brought my mother here as a mother's day treat. Let me start by saying that this place definitely is beautiful, but with that, I'm also going to say (as other's have stated) I think it's a tourist trap. Definitely a bit expensive, at $89/person, this become a pricey outing and if you add wine or drinks, man it's and bank breaker.So a rotating view of NY huh? It's beautiful, definitely something to see at night. Again, this restaurant is one on my ""once in a life time visit"" list. While the restaurant was beautiful, the food wasn't something to brag about. I'm one to get motion sick very, very easily but the rotating view of NY was not nauseating at all. I'm glad to see that my mom was excited but none of us were impressed by the food, although I will admit that presentation was on point and beautiful. I also loved that they gave you cute napkins that were a kind of map of the area.Be aware that there are quite a few parking lots in the area but expect to pay. Word of advice, go online for those parking lots and see if you can make a ""reservation,"" this is sometimes cheaper or you mind find a coupon instead which is what I did - saved about $10 on parking which was great.So again, spectacular view, but the food...don't expect a magnificent meal for the price.",4,1,2
48,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19,5.0,4/5/2018,"This is certainly on of the most atmospheric restaurants in the City of New York. Where else in the city can you indulge in a delicious meal, fifty floors up at a revolving restaurant? Due to the tragic end of Windows on the World, this is the only restaurant in Manhattan with a great view of the city, besides the Rainbow Room. But the View revolves, and Rainbow Room does not. Anyway, the actual restaurant has an elegant ambiance, and is perfect for a dinner before or after a show, for a romantic meal, or traditional Sunday brunch. The restaurant itself has two floors. The upper level is the cocktail lounge, where you can go without a reservation. The lower level is the main dining room. I strongly recommend a reservation, unless you would just like drinks. My first time here was after a performance of the Phantom of the Opera for my birthday. That was thoroughly enjoyable, and I must say, every other time has been excellent as well. The service is prompt and attentive, the waiters respond to every need. I would definitely recommend the steaks. They are tender and flavorful. You can even cut them with the butter knife! And the desserts are something else. My first time, I ordered the Black Forest cake and it was to die for. They also brought me chocolate cake for my birthday, and it was also impeccable. The dinner  menu itself is a three course prix-fixe, for $89, not bad considering the quality of the meal. And the best part? The glass elevator ride up to the restaurant itself. You check in on level three and go right up an express elevator. I strongly recommend this establishment to anyone, absolutely anyone who sets foot in the city of New York. You will not be amazed, you will be astounded. Try coming after a Broadway matinee. It puts the cap on a perfect evening. Or come before an evening show. It sets things off to a great start. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1,1,1

They had a choice of dinner buffet or some starters. It would have been good to have a la carte option. My drink was refreshing and exactly like how I liked. The starter with pita, hummus, olives and eggplant was really good. I especially liked the eggplant preparation. Dessert lovers could do dessert buffet.

It took me a minute for my stomach to decide if it liked the rotating while eating and drinking, but in the end I definitely enjoyed seeing different views of the city.  They had a prix fixe menu and I selected the crab cake and the filet for my first 2 courses.  The crab cake was literally the best I have ever had.  Amazing!  So fresh and all lump crab meat, no breadcrumbs.  The filet was also very good and I substituted the roasted potatoes for the truffle mashed which were very good.  The dessert was also amazing, I had the chocolate sphere  The service was good, not great - but it was a slow time and I know sometimes that makes it more difficult to keep a good pace going.  I'd go back with my husband if we had the chance, but it probably wouldn't be one of our first options.",,,
55,Dez H.,"Bloomfield, NJ",84,140,88,4.0,2/4/2017,"Had the restaurant week  3 course dinner prefix deal. My options included crab  cake, skirt steak and a chocolate pudding.  The crab cake was pretty awesome with huge chunks or crab meat, no cheap filling that some restaurants use. We're talking the good stuff. The skirt steak,although the waiter said we couldn't order to temperature because it was restaurant week, I thought was a weird requirement but the steak was perfectly cooked. The baked chocolate pudding hmmm I didn't know what to expect but it basically came out as a brownie/lava cake. I guess if the two were to somehow have a baby lol. Hmmm lava brownie? Oh wow if that doesn't exist it really should! It came with ice cream and a toffee wafer. Delicious! I also had a berry martini  very strong but very tasty. Now onto the view, gorgeous! Everything that you would expect. I love that the place was spinning and it wasn't too fast either. I was worried that the spinning mixed with eating might create vertigo but we were good. Our waiters (yes there were two of them) Eric and Josh were fabulous. The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is:1) you have to go to one floor to check your coat then another floor and then another section. You basically are sent to two or three sections BEFORE you can actually be seated which is time consuming and annoying you're hungry or have a show to get to. I would recommend the coat check on either the ground floor when you come in or alternatively on the same floor as the actual restaurant. 2) the hostess was kind of snippy about telling us we couldn't have a seat near the window. I'm sure she receives that request all the time but at the end of the day the restaurant is called ""the view"" so it's honestly not a unreasonable request. Other than that  Bon appétit!!!",1,,

I had a champagne-tini and my boyfriend had a jack & coke. The buffet was amazing. Tons of options- pasta, salad, quinoa salad, root veggie salad, Asian noodle salad, cinnamon chickpea salad, rolls, and more. (There were meat options that my bf loved, but I'm vegetarian so I don't know what they were sorry!) Of course there were bunch of mini desserts and a chocolate fountain.

For the appetizer, I will recommend the shrimp cocktail for appetizer, filet mignon for entry (skip the seafood paella), and caramel and hazelnut filled profiterole for desert.

The portions were standard, not too big and not too small... filet was cooked perfectly and accompanying veggie/sauces were wonderful. We got 3 side dishes (mac+cheese and mushrooms were the best), and these were very generously sized - perfect for sharing amongst 3 hungry adults.Now, onto the view itself... the downstairs dining room rotates, which is really cool and great - but we are only on the 47th floor, so you're at eye level or below many of the other Times Sq high rise buildings and not the best views of midtown (Rock Center or ESB would be most pristine views)!!!

This is not a budget spot. Think of it as a drink and a show.",,,
68,Tarasinto R.,"Baldwinsville, NY",3,19,7,3.0,2/10/2018,"Searched for a nice place to have dinner with my wife with a nice view and this restaurant came up. We had pretty high expectations after seeing it's a rotating rooftop restaurant and is marked as $$$$ so we figured food would be top notch. We made reservations day before and the only time slot that was open was 930 so we took it. Atmosphere: The view was really nice, one of our favorite things of our evening here. The restaurant does rotate and you can see the surrounding buildings and areas. Luckily we had a good view for an hour and then visibility started to decrease to pretty much nothing but that's weather and nothing can be done about that. There was nice music and it's a good place for a date or special celebration. Food: we got to pick an appetizer, main entree and dessert. For my main entree I went with the filet mignon and my wife went with something of a seafood platter. We thought it was ok at best, definitely not worth $$$$! Our desserts were actually our favorite part of the meal, very delicious! Service: Our waiter was really nice and pleasant, no complaints there. Overall: I think there's a huge expectation from what it looks like and its description but for what we paid for our meal, we didn't think the price matched. We figured we are paying for the view pretty much. For that price, I'd recommend looking up something else.",,,
69,Courtney S.,"Concord, NC",79,23,27,3.0,1/24/2018,"The View here is incredible and the staff is super friendly, but in my personal opinion that was about it for me. The food was just kinda so-so. I had the beef tenderloin with the half grilled lobster, the meat was kind of bland and the lobster was pasty almost?  Hard to explain. The NY cheesecake is absolutely incredible though. You come here for the View itself though so overall I wasn't disappointed on my first trip to NY  :)",,,
70,Ven H.,Hong Kong,1023,279,1308,3.0,3/26/2017,"Overall ratingAtmosphere/cleanliness - 5Service - 3Menu options - 3Food - 3Price - 3Total - 17/5 = 3.4I went to the lounge for their buffet with chocolate fountain. There's also proper dinning in the restaurant one floor below, the lounge is more for drinks. Being a rotating restaurant in NYC, nothing can really top that atmosphere. I can see the fascination for tourists, a 360 view of the city, all our skyscrapers. However, for me livening and working in the city, I have seen better, I was expecting the restaurant to be a bit higher, overseeing the city, not with office buildings and hotels right in my face next door.For food, they have a small salad bar, 3 different entrees and a chocolate fountain and cakes. They were just meh. The place was very romantic, classy, and the rotating part was of course the best. It's not cheap though, it was $4x for the buffet plus one drink minimum.",10,2,2
71,Katie S.,"Aurora, IL",53,10,0,1.0,9/24/2018,I went to this restaurant as a group with several others.We were there on Saturday 9/22. When we were seated our waitress was not friendly at all and took our drink order. I asked for water and wine. After 15 minutes I still didn't receive my water. When I asked again she seemed really bothered. She walked pass our table 3 times avoiding eye contact - knowing we still didn't have any water. We received our food (buffet) and still didn't have water. We eventually asked another waitress who told our waitress. She finally brought the glass water bottle over. I told her thanks and she quickly walked away without any response. She never came back to our table nor asked us for additional drinks or more water since our glasses were empty. We had to track her down again to ask for more water that she brought to us a little (slightly) quicker than the first time. The second glass of water was warm and didn't even provide us ice. This lady really didn't want to be there and it was evident. I looked around the room to see that the other server with our group was happy/smiling/friendly. The food was mediocre. The only thing decent about this place is the view.,,,
72,Michelle h.,"Frederick, MD",36,48,56,4.0,2/12/2018,Such a great view and experience. It's pricey but worth it for the experience. We went for the Sunday brunch. The food was wonderful. I will say service was surprisingly slow. I guess because it's a buffet there are very few servers. But we had to wave down people to get drink refills. Our server was very friendly and nice but just not around much. I would love to go back and see the views at night.,,,
73,Patrick B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",4,20,17,5.0,1/24/2018,"On a normal night I might not have realized this place warrants 5 stars. However, we had a restaurant week reservation when they opened at 5:30. They have a waiting area if you don't want to get a drink at the bar or in the lounge and got us for our table as soon as they opened. We had Armando as our waiter and he was great. I told him that we were seeing a show and he made sure to get our food out as quickly as possible. The entire staff was very responsive to us. The rotation of the restaurant is so slight, you have to remember to look outside to not miss the incredible view. The restaurant week menu is basically a smaller version of their regular items. The lobster bisque was good, a bit heavy with the fennel in my opinion. The steak was perfectly cooked and the chocolate gingerbread pudding was the definition of the word decadent. They even put a candle in my wife's for her birthday. The restaurant is certainly pricey, but worth a nice night out (or restaurant week!).",,,

75,Michelle D.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",94,75,157,4.0,3/26/2017,I visited this establishment as part of my birthday excursion to NYC. I wanted to dine here so I could experience see all of the city from the 48th floor. It is well worth at least one visit. The building spins but it's at a very slow pace so you barely notice.The menu was easy...$89 - 3 courses with great choices in each category.  I also had a cocktail that was made well.Our server was a gem: she had our table and a table of 12 at the same time. She never missed a beat. I was impressed. I ca t say that is a place I would visit over n over again but I am glad I went.,3,,

We went for a full buffet, but were pretty disappointed by the range of selections in their hot bar. There were very limited options, and the taste were just ok. What WAS worth it however were the cheese and dessert bar. We couldn't get enough of it! Went back for seconds and thirds! So if you go to the buffet, make sure to just get the dessert and cheeses. Not worth paying extra for the hot food.",,,
78,Gloria L.,"New York, NY",134,105,7,2.0,11/25/2017,"Go if you're looking for a NYC touristy experience with views of Gotham City. Great views but a bit overpriced menu - $98 for 3 courses. At this price I can dine at a number of evergreen NYC  restaurants with excellent environs, food and service. This venue needs to be more competitive as the finishings are a bit dated. Yes the rolls are stale like other reviewers said. Our server Farukh was awesome. Our guest was from Buenos Aires. Our awesome server Farukh got his Argentine colleague to stop by to say hi. I thought the gesture was very thoughtful and kind. Fantastic desserts. We had a seasonal gingerbread chocolate pudding which was out of this world.",,,
79,Heema R.,"Queens, NY",31,5,2,5.0,1/7/2018,My significant other and I went here for our anniversary and it was an amazing experience. The restaurant spun about twice for the two hours we were there. The meal included three courses for two. Presentation was good but the main entrees could have been more put together. There were only a few options you can choose from most of which were sea food. I had the salon which came in extra large noodles and broth so it was like a soup. The experience in a top of the line restaurant is mostly what this place is about. Overall good experiences but it could have been better. The staff should have been more informative and helpful.,,,

81,Han D.,"Lake Forest, CA",61,263,751,4.0,6/12/2016,"Well, really 3.75 but I'm rounding up since I can't do partial stars. Depending on where you are in the hotel to begin with, you'll need to type in the floor number, 48, and you may be directed down in order to take the express elevator up.We only intended on pre dinner drinks in the lounge, not the restaurant so I'm only reviewing the drinks.Please note that if you are not a guest of the hotel, you will be required to pay a $8 charge regardless if you are just there for the view or if you will be drinking and/ or dining there. Luckily we were staying in the hotel so the surcharge didn't apply to us. To be honest I don't think that the rotating view would be worth the additional charge.I had the Perfectly French, I would say just ok and BF had the Channel Crossing which is basically gin and tonic. That was good and their limes were freshly sliced! For me that's key, especially if you're charging premium prices.The view was beautiful and they print the buildings that you view on your napkin so you can keep track as you rotate.  The rotating room is inside a square exterior so the view is semi obstructed unlike the Westin Bonaventure in LA where the rotating restaurant is framed in a circle as well.  Here you get corners etc, aesthetically not as pleasing.  Service was good. If we were staying in the hotel next time we'd probably come back.",2,,2
82,Kim A.,"Blairstown, NJ",0,36,61,4.0,12/30/2017,"We had drinks at the lounge. Drinks were good, but not strong at all for almost $20 each. We got lucky and got window seat. Buffet has most salad and different pasta salads. Only 3 hot dishes, chicken, mashed potatoes and beef. Cheese bar only has Brie, blue cheese and what looked liked Swiss-and crackers. But for time square worth the money. Beautiful view. They wave the cover charge of $8 if your staying in the hotel, which was nice. A full rotation is about 45-60 minutes.  Not my idea of a lounge as there were a-lot of kids. Worth visiting at least once.",,,
83,Joselyn H.,"Jackson Heights, NY",1,9,0,1.0,2/21/2018,"I literally paid $262 for the worst service EVER EVER EVER and food poisoning. I wanted to take my husband out for a late Valentine's Day celebration, I came across ""The View"" The pictures of the restaurant caught my attention and decided to look at the menu, seemed interesting and something my husband would enjoy. We got there and the MaitreD checked us in and said there was no tables by the window available and it was a 30-45 min wait. We decided to wait but noticed there was a lot of tables empty by the window... anyway I don't know how their sitting works but it was not a big deal, besides we were a bit late for our reservation. We waited upstairs at the lounge, nobody offered a drink or water... whatever... after 45 minutes we got seated. This is where the tragedy starts.The waitress was very sweet, unfortunately the service was SLOW, very very slow. She explained the menu, left and came back after 15mins asking for our orders. We ordered and by this time I was starving. The appetizers and drinks took about 30mins to get there, my husband had the kale salad which was just okay, my ravioli however was not. It was a ravioli with a sweet purée inside and a couple of pumpkin seeds, nothing special, I had one piece and couldn't have more of it, it was painful to eat. I decided to eat the complimentary bread and butter instead...For main-course my husband had the sirloin steak which again, had no flavor, it needed a lot of salt and seasoning. The only thing that helped was the chimichurri sauce. I had the filet mignon which was soft and not as bad, it was okay. Thankfully we ordered the potato with Mac n cheese which was the only thing I actually liked. NOW  this is were my experience got worst. We had been done with our drinks and food and nobody came to ask how it was or if we wanted another drink. It took so long for a person to come and clear the table when we were done with both courses we honestly were tired of waiting and wanted to leave without ordering dessert but decided to wait. Our waitress finally came and we ordered the dessert the chocolate gingerbread  pudding for my husband and cheesecake for me. As soon as I ordered I gave my waitress the card to settle the check, she asked if we wanted it after the dessert I kindly explained we needed to leave right after the dessert. She left and after 30 minutes the busboy came to give us the dessert menu and we told him we had ordered, that's when the waitress came and told us she was gonna check on the dessert and asked what we had ordered again (we knew she didn't put in the order) by this time I was already irritated and anxious to leave after all we had experienced and waited. We repeated the order and waited AGAIN. The check came of course before the dessert even got there. Now when we got the dessert  WE GOT THE WRONG ORDER! Are you kidding me? I brought it to her attention and she told my husband ""oh that's why I asked you again and you said the cherry basque cake""  I quickly intervened and told her that he said chocolate gingerbread pudding and even I repeated the order to her right after him to be clear. She told us to enjoy it and she would bring out the pudding, I was furious and just said we didn't want it anymore because we had to leave. She insisted but we were just sick of waiting for things and tired of them wasting our time. I took a look at the check to sign it and leave but when I did that I noticed the 18% gratuity was included I looked at the website and it says it's added to parties of 6 or more. I'm sorry but I know about the industry because I have worked in it for a long time and I understand sometimes you forget things and get busy. But for a $89   3 course prefix menu I expected a better service, maybe not the greatest but not this bad either. My tab came up to $262 now I would've spent a lot more if they came to ask if we wanted more drinks. It was by far the most ridiculous, comical and sad thing I've ever experienced in a restaurant, sorry but McDonalds probably has a better service. Now the perfect finale my husband missed a day of work because he got food poisoning! Bravo!  It sounds like a made up story because of how many things went wrong and how bad it was but I'm not making it up. What was supposed to be a two hour meal turned into a 3 1/2 hour nightmare.Never ever ever ever EVER going back.",3,2,

88,Star Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,1.0,1/13/2018,"PLEASE READ!! While it took me many weeks to decide whether or not i should write this review, i have chosen to do so. And the main reason why is because of the way i was handled after the incident. On Dec 22 2017. my 34th birthday. My husband decided to take me out to a beautiful dinner at this restaurant. I have nothing but good this to say about the food and my server. Super pricey but we knew that before attending. The drama began after we excited the premises, and realized about 20 mins later that i left the gift bag my husband gave me on the ledge of the table we were sitting.The gift bag contained a birthday card and a 250.00 gift card to MAC COSMETICS (my favorite). So one could imagine have nervous i was to have potentially lost it. We were just around the corner. So we rushed back ran down stairs to where we were sitting to find an empty restaurant, Only cleaning staff. Not surprised because the dinning area was closed when we left. however i know 100% where i left my gift bag. But i didnt see it.  We went back up stairs to look for any staff member that can be of assistance. Maybe our waitress found the bag and put it in lost and found. or something of the sort. Finding a hostess and explaining the situation we were directed to the ""Manager"". Which is where the trouble began. This women (for lack of a better word) was the must unaccommodating, uncaring, unempathetic trash bag i have ever met. Between her accusing me of first not knowing whether i truly left it there or not, and trying her best to rush us out the door. We were asking questions like ""are there cameras"" ""can you contact our waitress"" ""where do we go from here"" because i know without a shadow of a doubt that i left the bag on the ledge"" She was give me answers like ""well there nothin we can do tonight"" ""we are not responsible for people losing things"" and i get all that. i wanted to just feel like when i left you would even try and that wasn't the feeling i was getting. At one point seeing the frustration growing in my face she same ""maam , do you have a problem"" and my response was to repeat the same question to her. because honestly the way she was handling us i wanted to say waaaaay more but i kept me composure.After 10 minutes of back and forth with this disgusting individual i asked one last time to go down stairs and check again. She said that she already did and there was nothing there. I insisted and she reluctantly agreed. I asked her to show us our table according to my receipt it was table 12. When we go downstairs she say ""Heres table 12"" OMG. NO ITS NOT. We sat at a 2 seater this is a table for 4. I suddenly here my husband behind saying omg babe here it is under the table"" 2 tables away from where we were actually sitting . Low and behold theres my gift card!! great right.... WRONG. There was my gift card but it was only the gift card, taken out the gift bag and wheres vmy card. SO basically someone took the gift card out my bag tossed my card and bag. and when they got wind that i was looking for it. tossed it under a table. We spent 500.00 in this place and someone that worked there tried to steal my gift card. UNBELIEVABLE. I was livid. I told her that and she yelled at me telling me not to accuse her staff of stealing. That other people come to the diner. Even though there wasnt a soul in there when we left. I was disgusted.The next day I called bright and early. I left 4. not 1 not 2 but 4 messages on the directors voicemail. I even called during dining hours to see if i could speak to him. I wanted to look at cameras. I wanted answers. I wanted someone fired fore stealing. I wanted an apology if nothing else. and here i sit on Jan 14 2018. writing a review on yelp. because i have not gotten a return phone call. or email. nothingI conclude that they know what happened. They possibly looked at the cameras. Even though i got my card. Someone physically reached in my bag and tried to steal it. Threw away my beautiful birthday card that my lovely husband gave me like it was trash. and ruined what before was rather a wonderful evening DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY.and the manger Mary Ann, Mary JO, Mary Lou whatever the hell your name is, try not to be a bitch, next time a customer comes to you with a concern.

97,Pooja M.,"Fremont, CA",528,258,1050,4.0,1/9/2016,"Brunch at The View in the Marriott Hotel in Times Square when you're in Times Square NYC because there isn't anything else like it! Where else can you enjoy an amazing buffet style brunch selection in a rotating restaurant at the top of a hotel to see a 360 degree view of NYC?It takes about an hour to complete an entire rotation of the restaurant, so it's not revolving at a fast pace for anyone who may be prone to motion sickness. The food stations themselves, which are in the center of the circular restaurant do not rotate -- just the tables which are located on the outside of the circumference. The view truly is breathtaking, and you can see the Hudson River, the World Trade Center, you can see out into the other boroughs of NYC -- however, it's not ideal for taking pictures as the circular restaurant is built inside a rectangular hotel, so the view is a bit obstructed when you are facing one of the corners of the hotel. While the corners have clear windows, the infrastructure still partially blocks the view, and while you can still see outside into the city, you won't be able to take any clear pictures. As a photo junkie, I found this aspect of the restaurant to be disappointing.I was blown away by the food, as there was an impressive selection of various brunch items including pastries, various meats and cheeses, eggs served multiple ways, and there was a waffle, crepe, and omelet station where you can ask the chef to prepare your own custom item. My favorite station was the dessert station which had so many gorgeously decorated cakes, cake pops, a chocolate fondue machine and various foods like marshmallows and strawberries to dip into the chocolate fountain. There were also cream puffs, mousses, and the list goes on. I helped myself to two plates of dessert, as dessert is always my favorite part of the meal. Brunch on the day that we went (12/27/15) had complimentary bottomless mimosas, which I thought was a nice touch. The price for brunch was not too bad considering the stature surrounding this restaurant -- we paid $65 per person for brunch. Eating at The View was definitely one of the highlights of my NYC trip, and I would definitely recommend it as a must for anyone visiting the city in the future.",6,1,1

I explained about the inattentive service and untimeliness and she proceeded to tell me ""well, we advertise that the dining experience is approximately 2 hours, so you're just a bit over"".  I asked ""where was this advertised?""  She stated ""on our website""....I checked the entire website while still at the table....NO where did it speak of a 2 hour process.  So I brought it to her attention, and she stated ""oh, I meant open table's website"".  Again, I checked the entire website, with again NO 2 hour mention.  She offered to give us a free drink, but after sitting for 2+ hours, we were ready to go.   She then gave us a small discount on our bill.  When she came back with the check, we had even more conversation about the ""missing advertisement"" that she claimed.I COULD NOT BELIEVE that she blatantly lied, but I guess she did not expect me to check.  I was applauded to say the least.If you want to eat here, I suggest that you order your food to-go and eat in the comfort of your own home/room so you do not have to be concerned with the lackluster service.",,,

I decided to try out this restaurant during restaurant week, despite the reviews, for the experience and for my mom's birthday. I kind of wish I saved my money since mom wasn't here for this restaurant (she's a simpler kind of gal) and just did the dessert buffet for the experience (which I still plan to do with friends) and take mom somewhere else. I wasn't impressed by any of the food. I imagine maintaining and running a rotating restaurant at the top of a hotel in the middle of Times Square is expensive but I just think the entire experience should be phenomenal. Also, the service here isn't bad but there is a 2 hour limit for seating and I did sort of get the sense that they are trying to turn tables as efficiently as possible.I probably wouldn't want to do dinner here again but I'm down for dessert.",1,,1

106,Stovi A.,"Berkeley, CA",273,9,1,1.0,11/6/2017,"God awful from beginning to the end. I had the absolutely WORST experience ever at this restaurant! This dinner was supposed to be my proposal dinner to my girlfriend (now, fiance, with no help to The View). I made my reservation two weeks in advance and clearly stated that this would be a wedding proposal and explained how I wanted it to happen (also sent a follow up message to the event email). The manager waits until the day of proposal/reservation day to notify me that they couldn't accommodate my request. WOW!!! Possibly the biggest moment of our lives and you wait until the day of to let me know you can't accommodate my WEDDING PROPOSAL! Absolutely unprofessional and inconsiderate. That was part 1. I decide to amend my 8 oclock reservation and still go to the restaurant. We begin by waiting 20 mins for bread and water. Then we order a bottle of wine to celebrate and it took 45 mins to receive it, but not before the waiter gave our bottle to the table behind us that had just sat down. The service was absolutely terrible. He didn't check on us ONCE during that 45 mins of waiting for the wine bottle. When I asked him why it took so long and his reply was "" (with an attitude) I'm the only one working 17 tables. Don't you see me running around."" As I try to reply,  he immediately cuts me off and says ""You can just speak to a manager if you got a problem. I actually prefer you talk to a manager. Let him know this isn't okay"". The manager tried to reconcile the situation with complimentary drinks, but he didn't show much empathy or sincereity and my fiancé was fed up with the restaurant's service at this point. It took 1 hour for bread, water and wine. Who knows how long it would of taken to get the main course. I will not recommend this restaurant to any of my friends/family/colleagues ever until they undergo new management. - Disappointed Newly Enegaged Couple",10,,

I made reservations to celebrate my brother's birthday and we were served by Antonio. He was impatient when he had take our order, not so friendly and what when I decided to order a bottle of wine he immediately let's me know the price of an actual glass of  wine. He definitely made my family and I feel as if we we're not going to order food there or that we couldn't afford to be there. It was a very unpleasant experience. We had asked for water at our table and he only gave water to one of our guest, we had to call him over a few times. Very pushy server.. when we took a little longer than usual to decide what to order. We had a few questions about the menu been that it was our first time that we were there, it will definitely be our last... he even said "" Are you ordering or are you leaving, there's a buffet downstairs..It's an expensive restaurant the least they can do is have outstanding service,  not someone like Antonio..Table 12/1Server: 34015 Antonio",4,1,

We went for the buffet, they offered pastas, mushroom risotto, a chicken dish, a beef dish, and a dessert bar. The food was good, however I wasn't that impressed because it was limited options. As far as the drinks we tried one of their signature drinks, the fizz, that I really loved. It was a perfect place for a surprise engagement!!!

My fiancé brought me here for a surprise birthday dinner and overall we were disappointed in the staff and food quality! The staff was pretty much rude and not attentive. My fiancé made a reservation for a table for two and when we first came in they sat us at a 5 person table it was awkward and awful so we asked them to move us, which we then waited for 40 mins to get a table. No mention of my birthday from the staff until the dessert. The appetizer choices sucked, they need to add other options most definitely! Entrees were good but kind of flavorless we had to add a ton of salt and pepper but the portions were decent! Very pricey here but like I said it was worth it for the view and experience!

As someone who respected Marriott, I'm shocked by the fact they can put their name to the food quality that was served.My grade school kids spent the meal debating what food was better ""hot lunch from their school"" or The View food (hot lunch won 2 kids to 1.) My wife and I tried to come up with a restaurant that had worse food.It wasn't one dish, it was literally everything. On the bright side, we had fun daring each other to try things and enjoyed the locks of astonishment from other tables when they got their food.The service wasn't rude but they didn't really care. We didn't complain but our waiter who didn't really have a personality didn't acknowledge that we barely ate and didn't come close to touching either side dish. The interior is very tired looking as well (for those who care about décor.)Without a doubt, if you are looking for this kind of experience, go to an observatory where the views are way better and either catch some pizza and save some money or go to a nice restaurant where you get what you pay for!",,,

First, it's a fixed price menu so don't come if you're not hungry.  I had fois gras for my appetizer, chicken for my main, and coffee and chocolate pudding for dessert. The focus gras was delicious, but that probably had more to do with the fact that it was fois gras than anything else. The chicken was meh, and the dessert actually came as two separate entities on the plate rather than the dual-flavored dessert I was expecting. It was more like a lava cake and a sad half-melted ice cream on the side. Drinks and ice wine were great -- the cocktail and wine lists were good. Service was just okay...

Located inside the Marriott Hotel, The View Restaurant is on the 48th floor accessible by a fun elevator ride. We had a reservation and had noted in our reservation that we were celebrating a birthday. Our server was friendly and humorous. We were attended to, but not bothered. The selections from the restaurant week menu included:Creamless tomato soup- just the right temperature, tart but full-bodiedCrab cakes- I'm not usually a fan of crab cakes because I think they're too much cake and not enough crab, but these crab cakes were stellar! So much fresh crab meat!Butter poached Alaskan crab legs- a bit too heavy with the butter, but still delicious crab legs, nonetheless Flatiron steak- WOW. Was definitely not expecting the steak to be so perfect. The medium was cooked perfectly, and the meat was so tender and perfectly seasoned!Seared Atlantic Grouper- good, but not mind-blowing. The ratatouille that it came with was quite good. The chocolate mousse parfait and cheesecake were both delicious. Much to our delight, we were given a complimentary chocolate mousse cake with candles for our birthday celebration! That was so lovely of them, and definitely was the cherry on the top.We loved the rotating aspect of the experience, and really enjoyed seeing different views of the Manhattan skyline, though it wasn't as spectacular as I expected it to be. We did have a window seat, so not sure how much better it could get. I won't be back for the regular menu because the prices are more than I should be paying as a graduate student, for sure. But if another special occasion with an out-of-towner falls during restaurant week again, you bet I'll be back!",2,1,

It is very out dated and the rug is rather dirty. The service was good but the food was AWFUL!!! I literally took one bite of my filet Mignon. Everything was extremely salty and was terribly seasoned. It infuriates me that we paid what we did.

131,Lisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,2,1.0,3/9/2018,"We went to the view lounge to have celebratory drinks for a friend that just got engaged in the dining literally 15 min before we were seated at a table. When the waitress came over she asked for our drink order but we were so excited getting the story from the soon to be bride that not everyone was ready. I asked for a glass of water and she said she would bring it AFTER we ordered drinks. Well I'm getting sick so I had no intention of drinking alcohol but my husband and I planned on buying several rounds for the bride and groom to be. She comes back and we give her the bride and groom order and I say I'm not drinking just water to which she responds ""it's a mandatory drink order per person so you can order bottled water."" I order a mint tea as does my husband and still ask again for a glass of water.  She then takes everyone else's order (8 of total) then proceeds to say it will be an $8  charge PER PERSON to just have a drink in the lounge. That was never told to anyone in the party and we said the couple just ate here and got engaged here and we are here to celebrate shouldn't that cover it and she asked to see the receipt for proof. Again we are there to celebrate and the couple is literally basking in their post engagement glow and they couldn't find their receipt. She then asks for their last name and says well that only covers the bride and groom. We decide to suck it up and not ruin their fun and just pay the charge to enjoy our drinks. Then to add insult to injury she then asks for a room number. We weren't staying their so she says she needs cash or a credit card to secure the table. I say is this because of what our table looks like( mix of black and white people) do you think we are just going to run off on the bill? and she said ""basically yes. My husband again not wanting to ruin our friend's night hands her his card and she says ""We are going to have to call and verify that there is enough to secure a $50 deposit down"". She said ""it's not my rule its a corporation it's their rules"" and my husband asked for his card back since that seemed like a ridiculous request just to order drinks. It was incredibly insulting and we have never been treated so rudely and so poorly before in our lives. EVERYONE at the table was fed up and offended by these overtly discriminatory policies and when the waitress walked away to fill our drink orders we packed up and left. The bride and groom did their best to keep a smile on their face and as we walked out our waitress saw us and didn't even make an attempt to apologize. Little did she know that I have done several events at this hotel and have spent north of $50k hosting large conferences and seminars. I have extreme purchasing power and this restaurant has forever lost my business and those of any clients I work with in the future due to their disgusting behavior.  If your policies are real then you need to be more upfront from the beginning and more courteous when explaining them. If they are not real then you have a lawsuit waiting to happen due to your prejudiced staff and you need to clean house immediately. We took our business to the 8th floor lounge where we treated with the respect and dignity we deserved.  To everyone reading this AVOID THE LOUNGE AT ALL COSTS.",2,,
132,Betsy B.,"Tucson, AZ",44,485,777,4.0,2/15/2017,"The restaurant is located on the 48th (top) floor of the Marriott Marquis.  It's a little tricky to find it as if you enter at ground level, you need to go up the escalator (sign says it goes to the view).  Then on that floor you have to find the right elevator (there are 2) that says it goes to The View and punch in 48 for the floor.  The elevator is glass so you can see the interior of the Marriott as you go up.  When you arrive, you are actually in the bar and have to go down steps to get to the restaurant (if you need to go down on elevator, someone will take you down a level).  They don't open until 5:30 but if you arrive a bit earlier, there are some chairs to wait.  No-one offered to take our coats so doubt they have a coat check.  It would be nice if they did.  The restaurant rotates and during the meal you will make a full circle.  A lot of the view is other buildings but still kind of fun to see.  If you don't like heights, you don't have to look down.  We chose the prix fixe menu for restaurant week.  I had the baby gem lettuce salad as a starter which was quite good.  It had a nice mix of vegetables, walnut crumbs and a sherry pomegranate vinaigrette dressing.  For dinner I had the chicken breast that came with a ""savory bread pudding"" that was more of a stuffing but tasty and the chicken was tender and tasted good.  For dessert I had the cheesecake that had some strawberries, shaved cucumbers and lime.  It was pretty good.  A couple of days later, due to the snow storm and theater tickets on that block, we decided to go back with some other friends.  Had the salad and cheesecake again but for entree had the salmon.  It also was tender and had a lobster ragout sauce with yukon mash.  It was very good.   The service on both occasions was excellent throughout the meal and waiters were attentive to our theater timeline.  They have a nice wine selection as well.",2,1,1

The get a 5 for the view and ambience, a 3 for the services (to include the host/hostess).  Be a little more engaging with your group.  Point the 'Big' buildings as they come into view for your table.  Be nice to those that are just entering the restaurant, they haven't been there before and don't know where everything is - it certainly isn't intuitive to know to walk down a flight of hidden stairs to be seated for your reservation.",1,,

Tried the restaurant first and just walking through the ambience very down market and the food looked below par, so went to the lounge, buffet is worse than the any cheap chain, the family next to us took one mouthful and left, I thought them brave. We opted for the dessert and cheese option which was fine. Given what else NYC has to offer you have to seriously struggle to find any reason at all to contemplate the view.

We had some sort of gnocchi for an appetizer. For the main course we had salmon and hanger steak. The hanger steak was ok, but the salmon was a bit too bland. For dessert, we got cheesecake, a mango sorbet dessert, and chocolate cake. I do have to say that the presentation of the desserts are beautiful, but taste was just ok. The chocolate cake was a bit too sweet and the mango sorbet was just a touch too sour.I think this place would be great for tourists who wants a nice restaurant with a nice view of NYC but at the same time don't want to pay an exorbitant amount for dinner. However, I probably won't be coming back again.",1,,1
142,Travis L.,"Queens, NY",4,67,10,4.0,3/18/2017,"Our server Luis was amazing. His personality and character definitely made our dining experience spectacular. He always made sure everything was perfect and if it wasn't he made sure he came back with the same order the Exact way u wanted it on the house without taking back the previous order. Same for the drinks. The view was amazing especially with the revolving room, that was different and it was unique. I believe it was a bit pricey however. The food was good but not worth the amount we paid I believe. It was good for a one time experience. Would recommend for a special occasion.",,,
143,Yerim P.,"Orlando, FL",10,30,12,3.0,9/23/2017,"I came with my fiancée and we spent around $285. You're literally just paying for the view/experience. The food was alright - we both got a full course: appetizer, entree and dessert. I think the portions are pretty decent so we were both very full afterwards. Thankfully we got a window seat so we were able to look out at the view during sunset which was beautiful. Being honest, the food/experience is not worth the price tag that comes with it.",,,

146,Brent G.,"Greensboro, NC",0,3,0,2.0,5/5/2018,"The View was just that, and only that. A 48th floor circular moving restaurant giving you a nice view of the city, but the food was awful. A Pre fixe meal for $89 per person should be delicious, and this was not. The bread rolls came out cold, as if they'd been recently refrigerated. We had kale salad and  jumbo shrimp appetizers that were very plain and flavorless. My wife's  salmon tasted like it was brought in from Costco. I ordered the filet mignon medium, and it was over cooked and dried out. The food came very quick so it was likely ready before it was ordered. The waitstaff was very nice and accommodating. It's a nice place but not a great food experience.",,,
147,Luis T.,"Miami, FL",41,5,0,3.0,12/21/2016,"First ""The View"", the hotel is surrounded by buildings and the restaurant being it's on the 48th floor still gives a spectacular view of the Hudson River but that it's. Second the food, it's ok. Was not blown of my feet considering the ""a la cart"" menu and the price per person is $89. You are much better off eating in the buffet side for $40 per person and not get the revolving floor. Most importantly if I am paying that much per person at least serve warm bread. So basically you are paying for ""The View"" Enjoy.",3,1,

I went there for the evening buffet and since there is no reservations for the buffet, got there early, 5pm when it opened; thus seating was not a problem and was seated at a window table. The views are beautiful and since my visit was in the Fall, by 6PM, I was able to experience the sunset over Manhattan.The food is typical buffet food, heavy on the carbohydrates, but one goes for the ambiance and view, not the food. There is a regular dinner menu, but be prepared for steep prices. The drinks are on the pricey side, but again, one goes for the experience.",3,,1

We thought it would be a great opportunity to eat at the top of the Marriott Marquis at the restaurant called The View. We made a reservation on OpenTable for 5:30. The restaurant was not crowded. The buffet was pristine and untouched. We had a lovely table right by the window and could watch Manhattan and it's glory as the building turned very slowly. The hot buffet was lovely. They had choices like chicken cacciatore, pasta with sauce, beef Bolognese all kinds of lentils and beans and beets and a beautiful salad with bread and crackers. If you had room there was a lovely dessert bar that had a chocolate fountain with all kinds of things to dip in the chocolate like cookies and pretzels and fruit beautiful delicious strawberries. They also had little pastries to enjoy. Unfortunately my. husband and I were on diets so we didn't eat as much as we would have liked to because everything looks delicious. I'm sure I will be returning to this lovely spot in the near future. It was quiet pretty romantic and a very pleasant place to dine",,,

Some of our party were not amenable to a three-course meal at the late hour. Our server was surly and aggressive, insisting that we make a selection for each course rather than acceding to our wishes and just charging us for the three course meal, whether or not we were actually served each course. The food was unremarkable and for some of our party,  bagged to go. The two stars were given for the creative desserts, particularly the sorbet.

156,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",306,37,72,4.0,2/13/2016,"I went to The View restaurant to celebrate my birthday. Great experience all around. It takes a while to adjust to the restaurant platform that rotates in order to get a 360 view of the city from Times Square. The hostess was very friendly and promptly took us to our table. The menu is prix fixe for a three-course menu. We started with beet ravioli and prawns. Both appetizers were generous portions and a strong start to the meal. The beet ravioli really stood out with fresh beets and the pasta that was covered in a light brown sugar sauce. Entrees - we ordered the griddled scallops and the ribeye steak. The scallops were okay but a bit too dense; not a melt in your mouth texture. The spiced cauliflower and roasted potatoes made up for the underwhelming scallops. We rated the steak 6/10Dessert - nice range of options on the menu. I highly recommend the tipsy pineapple cake - it was a spice cake drizzled with a pineapple chutney with a delicate almond cookie on top. We also ordered the sorbet and ice cream that came with mixed berries. The waitress Rita was amazing! She was very attentive and always willing to suggest an item from the menu.  Pros - Cool concept, nice view, quality service and food, dishes were served to the table quickly Cons - Somewhat outdated decor, time needed to adjust to the moving platform (you might be dizzy for the first few minutes)",1,,
157,Vince N.,"Maui County, HI",488,1646,7062,3.0,9/4/2014,"We came in on a whim after seeing an ad near the elevators. ATMOSPHERE:It's a revolving restaurant that takes about 1 hour to do a complete rotation.  The views are amazing being on the 47th or so floor of the Marriott Marquis.  There are tables for two along the viewing windows and larger tables on the second and third rows in.  It's dimly lit and decorated with modern cues.  It wasn't crowded at all on a Tuesday night. MENU:Unfortunately it's buffet style eating only.  A bit steep at $38 for maybe 4 different entrees, salad bar, and dessert station.  We passed on food as it looked unimpressive and we're not buffet fans. BEVERAGE:Brooklyn Brewery Lager - Whew $8 a bottle (even for big domestic brands like Bud!?)  Oh well, we had a great time and that's what matters.  Imports are 50-cents more. SERVICE:Our server Pete was very friendly and professional.  TIP:They have an $8 cover charge if you're not a hotel guest, and there is a 1 drink order minimum for everyone.

Updated review",I invited my friend to dinner in honor of Resturant Week. We took advantage of the Resturant Week Menu. We were not disappointed with our food selections. Everything was perfectly cooked.  We both had the chicory salad and Sea bass. I also ordered a bottle of Cava. Here is where my experience turned sour. Once we were served it was like we no longer existed.  I am  still sitting here at 9:14 pm after being seated at 615 pm. My server never poutyred me a second glass from my bottle. We were seated next to a table of four that turned over twice. I asked for fresh pepper and was provided a salt and pepper shaker. Yet the second table of of four was provided fresh pepper when requested. I sit here embarrassed because I chose this place. And now my friend may never let me choose the Resturant for dinner.,,,

175,Dennis C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/26/2017,Last night I was celebrating my birthday and also my engagement to my future wife . I made reservations for approx. 15-17 people. However have never ever had such a terrible experience as I had last night . The service was extremely terrible . The food was average for the price that we spent approx. $2800.00. When it was time to pay the bill we asked if we could spilt the check multiple ways at which point we were told that it was impossible to do this . We asked to speak to a manager and a gentlemen by the name of Melvin came and told us that he was the manager . Then he changed his story and said he was the Captain in charge of services . I explained the situation to Me. Marcel but I was better of speaking to a deaf mute because everything I spoke to him about he had it go through one ear and out the other . He then told me to break up the check amongst ourselves and he would then review it and charge us accordingly. I have never been to what I consider a very good restaurant and have to pull out a pen and paper and start dividing my check . I asked Mr. Marcel for the manager and he told me that he was in charge . I then walked over to the hostess and asked to speak to the manager in charge and was directed to Mrs Nicole . Mrs. Nicole advised me that  Mr. Marcel was not a manager and that she had never Ever heard of a Captain position in her restaurant . Mrs.Nicole made no attempt to fix the situation but only made things worse by telling us that the menu has in fine print on the back of the menu that checks cannot be spit and if it is to be split for any reason it is at the discretion of the waiter . Are you kidding me ! Who picks up a menu and reads the back of the menu to see if we can spilt a bill . Mrs Nicole never made any attempt to fix the problem or try to accommodate our party. But to make matters worse Mrs Nicole writes a reply to a review that one of our guest wrote stating that we were happy with the services etc. let me make it clear that this is 100% untrue . I'm sure this establishment could care less of my review because I'm just a tourist passing by however I travel to New York on a constant basis and with a lot of friends . We will never ever come back to this establishment nor will I recommend it to anyone ! Horrible experience . What ever happened to taking care of the customer ?  You guys are in the business of catering to your customers and making them feel like royalty especially when we are dropping a whole lot of money into your business .,1,,

177,Kate B.,"Southlake, TX",80,209,139,2.0,8/23/2015,"Food was surprisingly good for a corny restaurant that has not been renovated since 1985. The salmon was good and the crab cakes were excellent. That said, the place is in desperate need of a makeover. For the prices they charge, it needs to shed the ugly brass and 26 year old carpet for something more modern. The price fixe meal was good but really too much food for a pre-theater dinner. They should offer a smaller tasting menu that would be quicker and smaller for these early, quick meals. Meanwhile the signage to get to the restaurant is abysmally bad. We had to wander around the lobby trying to figure out how to get upstairs. It all seemed more complicated than it had to be and reminded me of Disney circa 1989.",2,,

We both ordered to drink The View Fizz which has among other things mango puree. It was a bit overpriced at $16.00 but I didnt mind because it was really sweet but strong. We had the crab cake as the appetizer and it was good but not really worth the extra $10.00 since the portion was small. The salmon we had as an entree was also small, it had as a side green beans. Although everything was tasty and fresh, the portions are way too small to leave satisfied. I guess you pay for the view rather than the food.

180,Nhi P.,"Boston, MA",304,247,907,2.0,12/26/2013,"Ok. I'll admit, I made this reservation knowing full well that the food would be meh from all the reviews. However, I didn't expect that our view would be mediocre and that our service would be so rude! For one, I made the reservation for seven people two weeks in advance and asked for a table close to the windows since, as tourists, we really wanted to get that New York view. Let's just say, I didn't see anything unless I wanted to break my neck because I had to crane my neck at odd angles since they seated us next to one of the buttresses. That really upset me since I had wanted to give my grandparents' a beautiful view of the city at night. The decor was also a little outdated; that carpeting should go back to the 90's and stay there.Then, the service was just atrocious. We arrived roughly fifteen minutes earlier than our reservation, but still had to wait an additional thirty before we could be seated (which I found ridiculous since the restaurant was only 80% full, at most). Though, that probably wouldn't have bothered me much, to be honest, if the hostesses didn't break a cardinal rule in my book -- they started to smack-talk the diners when they weren't in earshot. Seriously? That's just rude, especially when done within earshot of another diner. It made the initial impression really off-putting. Our waiter was nice enough; he got a little miffed when only half the table ordered wine though. After he got our orders, he practically vanished for the rest of the evening and we were serviced by a secondary waiter for the rest of the night. I feel awful for not getting his name, but the second waiter was great; he was middle-aged, super funny, and friendly -- our glasses were never empty. The food was pretty good too. The menu is a three course prix-fixe at $79 per person. I forgot what everyone ordered, but the general consensus was that it was pretty decent. My lamb was cooked perfectly -- no smell and had great flavor. Dessert was a little disappointing for me though. Somehow, they managed to ruin tiramisu. Served as a glob of cream and topped with a chocolate disk and some flowers, it tasted awful; the flowers made everything taste so bitter that I couldn't even finish it (and I usually LOVE my tiramisu).For $80+ per person that night, I really expected something better. The concept of the restaurant is great and utterly unique, but it's execution and management is atrocious and I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone visiting New York when you can go elsewhere and get your money's worth. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because of the friendly waiter and my lamb. To end this awful review on a funny note, my grandmother got lost going to the restroom because they're located in the center of the restaurant, which doesn't move. So when she came out the same way, the restaurant had completely flipped around.

181,Kim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",469,1009,756,3.0,8/31/2015,The view gives it a four...the food a three.  Service is also a four.  If you are a tourist...well why not eat at a revolving restaurant during sunset.  Can't go wrong other than getting a little confused and sick spinning around and around.  If your a NYer....it took me leaving the city and 9 years later to actually do this tourist thing.,1,2,
182,Mike M.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,35,2,5.0,4/12/2017,"The View in a whole is a touristy restaurant. ""When you go to NYC go to the restaurant that spins around with views of the city"" type of place. However, there is more to this place than that. The food (which is pre-fixe) is STELLAR! Top notch food. The view(s) really ARE amazing, even if you have lived in this city all your life. And the service is excellent! It was my girlfriends 30th B-day and they made every part of it amazing. Even bringing a separate Happy Birthday cake with a candle. I mean, they went out of their way. Tip was included (18%) but I would have left more. Really good service. Great Ambiance. And really good food. Not just for the tourists! Trust me! However, for a pre-fixe meal for two, plus two glasses of wine, total damage was around $280 so be mindful about that. Definitely a $$$$ restaurant. However, you definitely, get what you pay for.",1,,2
183,Raymond F.,"Ellicott City, MD",0,27,18,3.0,7/6/2017,"As it's name implies, the reason to dine here is for the views of NYC.  The restaurant and lounge complete a 360 degree revolution each hour.  Situated on the Marriott Marquis' 48th floor, you can see far and wide.  Service was attentive but not intrusive.  They were not in a rush to speed you through dinner as I believe there are a limited number of nightly seatings. The meal itself was good but not great with a prix fixe 3-course meal the only option for $89.  (Two course child's menu for $30).  We enjoyed the view and dinner, but I think there are many more NYC dining options we may try in the future.",,,
184,Cindy U.,"Manhattan, NY",37,57,211,5.0,12/20/2016,Haven't been here in years. DARLENE in reservations is so Amazing. Very polite. Patience and was very helpful. Darlene deserves a raise. Will keep coming back after this experience. Can't wait to be there again for Xmas day brunch.,,,
185,Johanna R.,"New York, NY",0,4,4,5.0,1/1/2018,"I was prepared for a mediocre experience after reading the reviews here but my father was so excited to take us all here for the experience and so we went. All of us plus baby had an amazing time. The food was great, the view spectacular and the service was the best I have ever had in any restaurant. Whenever I take our 1.5 year old to a nice restaurant, I get anxious because you just don't know if people will be accommodating and your child will behave well as you go from course to course. Rita, our server, was charming, so accommodating to our child - she brought him strawberries so he was happy while we made our menu decisions. She bent over backwards for us all to have a great experience - simply delightful person. I had the fois gras appetizer which was fantastic - then the filet mignon and the cheese cake with marinated strawberries. I loved the entire meal. It was substantial for a high end restaurant. The rest of our group tried shrimp cocktail ( only disappointed it was only two big shrimp), lobster bisque (pretty decent), crab cake appetizer (very good), sirloin steak, cherry basque cake (divine, especially for my husband who loves cherries) etc. I can see that other reviewers wish for the menu to be more inventive, but I have to say everyone of us found something we were excited to order.  Now one note to the management - it's unacceptable we had to leave the table mid menu and spend 20 minutes traveling to the nearest changing table and then 20 minutes back. The food got cold and I saw plenty of other young families in the restaurant who have the same issue. For such a big restaurant with lots of traffic and the revenue they are creating here annually, it's not too much to ask to put a changing table in the restroom. You have to take two separate elevators and a significant distance through the building to find one. Annoying.",,,
186,Peg A.,"Irvine, CA",46,72,7,4.0,6/12/2017,They food is not the best but the ambiance and service was great! Loved our waiter. I wouldn't recommend the buffet though. It is good for date night and birthday! Visit in the sunset to get the best view. Worth trying.,,,
187,Laura O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,2.0,8/5/2017,"It is good to visit this place , but there is nothing that special like you are expecting for. We didn't like that we were charged tip for our server though we just got in and after we were done gave money to pay for our dinner and server didn't give us change , basically she got double tip . Very unprofessional. The food was good.",,,
188,Erica H.,"Pawtucket, RI",1,20,4,2.0,6/8/2016,"The view is amazing and the sunset was gorgeous. The food was pretty good...I've had better though. The service was terrible. The water  man (don't know what he is called) was better than our waiter. Our meal took forever to come out and everything else took forever (getting the check, waiting for desert etc). Our waiter was terrible and the place can use some updating. Way too expensive for what you get. Cool to go for the view...stick to the lounge for a drink.Oh by the way they had Christmas music playing..no joke. Santa Baby came on while we were eating. Weird!",4,1,
189,Cissy Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,18,3.0,10/12/2016,Nice view for sure! Good drinks and dessert. I wouldn't recommend the buffet dinner though. It's a good place for before/after dinner drink.,1,,
190,Sharon Y.,"Austin, TX",446,77,160,3.0,8/8/2016,"I like the concept of The View. This rotating lounge area is open to anybody as long as you purchase a drink, and there is a little napkin with references to the major skyscrapers around the city. The service was extremely slow, and at several points during my visit, I want sure if they had forgotten about my party. The drinks are pretty average and a bit on the pricier side--understandable since that's pretty much your ""ticket"" to view Manhattan's skyline. I don't think my experience here was amazing, but I like the idea that you can go enjoy the view and lounge with the purchase of a drink!",1,1,1
191,Rolf B.,"Wevelgem, Belgium",5,6,30,1.0,5/27/2015,"We already have many nice and welcoming restaurants visited in Europe and we would like to do this also once in New York.Pictures on Yelp are nice and ok so we are looking forward to this restaurant for a nice diner with some friends.Please find herewith some feedback:Negative points:- poor welcome- window seating? Ah we have a look for you.... No way, no window seating, even when a table was free later, difficult to change - no explanation about menu and ordering ... What do you want? Only menu, 84$..... Ok, sorry to disturb you waiter - meals were ok but not extremely good or nice.... Standard for this ""kind"" of restaurants (pretending the place to be)- staff isn't always friendly and they have the behavior they don't like their job.Anyway, way too expensive vs the quality and fun you get.Positive points:  - Euh , don't know.... Not even ""the view""",4,,
192,Mark E.,"Manhattan, NY",388,127,131,3.0,6/29/2015,"I've been to this place several times, every time friends or family visit they request places for great views. This place is good for the VIEW. Nothing else. The food is OK, but hey at least it's not terrible. I have been ordering the same thing for quite some time the Bitter squash chowder and the crab cakes which are average. The best time to get here is before sunset, your see the city in light, catch the sunset over the Hudson and get the night lights after dark.",2,,

195,David C.,"Mesa, AZ",47,144,17,1.0,4/3/2016,"What a poor experience... At first the bouncer let us in without charging us a cover charge because it was our anniversary. At least we thought, as absolutely nothing was mentioned about a cover charge. We sat down and ordered drinks and the server informed us that there is an $8 dollar charge per person as a fee to enjoy the view ($32 dollars total for 4 of us). The drinks are overpriced but we ordered some with the confidence from the server that she'll get verification from the manager that it's ok to waive the fee. Again, that was the impression we got. The server dropped the drinks off and we started to drink them. The manager came over, Brian, (skinny white guy with glasses mid thirties). And he informed us that there was nothing he could do about it and only if we were hotel guests, which we told them the truth that we weren't. He wouldn't budge, even considering the special occasion. The server came back after hearing about our conversation with the manager and without asking took our drinks away and said ""I guess you guys aren't staying"". And walked away with our drinks and and then whispered something under her breath, something like ""weirdos"", or something like that, I didn't her it, but she definitely mumbled something under her breath. Not cool. Not a good experience at all. I talked to her again and let her know this was not cool, and she said she was just taking the drinks away according to what the manager said. She also called my friend who a liar, which, even if my friend was lying about the cover charge issue (which she wasn't) the server should NOT call any customer a liar. Brian should not be the manager. He handled this VERY poorly. This place has a beautiful view. That's about it. Drinks are over priced and not that great. You can have a much better time at a dive bar or a pub with some nice Irish people.",9,7,
196,Barbara D.,"New York, NY",4,2,7,4.0,8/27/2015,"Nice view especially after sunset. We had the dessert and cheese buffet for 21$. Delicious cakes and different mousses and a good choice of cheese and crackers. The atmosphere is more like a restaurant than a lounge though... We left around 8:20pm and didn't have to pay additional coverage charge, which is officially being charged after 8pm.",,1,1
197,Ann K.,"Columbia, MD",60,364,722,2.0,3/5/2014,The view doesn't have that kind of New York view. I am disappointed. The $38 buffet doesn't worth it. $16 cocktail. It has contemporary 1980 feel with high rise view and that is it. I am not thrilled. The View in San Francisco has more upscale lounge than this. It is tourist trap for sure.The only good thing is it is close to Imperial Theater.,1,,
198,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,2.0,5/22/2015,"The View is decorated like opulence in the 80s - gaudy carpets, speckled beige walls... Service on a Wednesday night for a dinner reservation at 9 pm was surprisingly slow. The menu consists of a three-course pre-fixe for $83. The dishes are standard fancy American restaurant fare, with timeless, if perhaps uninventive classics. You can choose from crab cakes to salad to foie gras spread and many more from the appetizers. I got the foie gras spread with toast - it was rich, buttery, and quite tasty. I wish there were some tart cornichons to cut the fat with, but there you go.For the mains, you can choose between steak, chicken, pork and fish - I got myself a pork shank, which came huge on the bone, with sides of spaetzle and mustard greens. The sauce was savory and went well with the crispy/fluffy spaetzle, but the meat itself may have been a little tough.I didn't really care for the view. It made me dizzy thinking about how I was spinning round and round.",2,,
199,Tara B.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,0,1.0,11/27/2017,"Came here for Sunday brunch with my family of 10 and found a giant mosquito in my food. The head chef was embarrassed and said he would ""make it right"". I waited ten minutes and nobody came back so just paid and left. I left my number and room number I would be staying in and even emailed them and never received any response. Don't waist your money here unless you want bugs in your food and bad service.",,,
