The Jessica Rabbit spicy tequila slushie is a crowd favorite, and I can see why.Also tried a whiskey cocktail, and a gin/rum one and both were good. The gin one (Pleasant Demise) was my favorite.They also have a full kitchen menu, but we just got potato wedges to share, which were good.",,,
1,Toyin D.,"Edison, NJ",37,124,136,4.0,11/14/2018,"We came here on a Friday night to kick off a night celebrating a friend's birthday. This place has a cool speakeasy vibe, and has a nice seating area in the back; downstairs has a photo booth, which we didn't use. Music selection was really good on the night we went and we had fun dancing in our little corner. This place isn't all that big and on a Friday night it can get packed quickly. I can only speak on the cocktails. I had the ""flawless victory"" drink, which has pineapple, absinthe, ginger, etc. It was really good - sweet, refreshing, and not too strong, just how I like it. I only settled for one drink as one cocktail will set you back about $16-17 ($14+tip). All in all, great vibes, great ambiance, good cocktails to start off the night.",,,
2,Tony L.,"Brooklyn, NY",621,344,587,3.0,11/4/2018,"This place is a nice little secret in LES that doesn't get too crowded and the scene is quite good. The music is poppin' and the vibe is good. They also have a great outdoor patio area that gets packed pretty early especially in the warmer months.My first experience here was great - the draught beers were fine and the food we got was good, but the second time is why I'm giving them 3 stars. We came on a friend's birthday and they had the reservations set up and everything. For all intents and purposes, I should have had a good time.What went wrong? When you call yourself a cocktail bar, I expect good, well-balanced cocktails. My friend got a tequila mule and I a dark and stormy - simple ones that I thought I'd test out before diving into their signatures. The first time he made the mule, he messed up and used vodka instead, so he made us another - neither of our drinks were well-balanced and mine in particular felt layered. The top had a strong rum-club soda flavour, while as I drink to the bottom it became just ginger essence. It was really disappointing to have such simple drinks messed up from a cocktail bar, and it dissuaded me from staying longer.",2,,1
3,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,4.0,7/30/2018,"I visited Bonnie Vee on a warm day after being enticed by the premise of cocktails in the garden. They do have a rather large inside, but the garden is definitely where you want to be if the weather outside is nice.When I went, on a Sunday evening, there were surprisingly not too many people around inside or outside. The space was modern and trendy. The inside was a little dark, but spacious just like the garden. The seats outside were comfortable. I do hear it usually gets packed so maybe I just got lucky, but I'd definitely try to come during less busy hours for a more low key experience.The drinks themselves were great. The bartenders were friendly and were able to make me custom drinks that weren't on the menu and tasted great. Service was quick and attentive, even outside. What more could you ask for in a cocktail spot?This place is definitely worth checking out, both for dates and nights out with a group of friends. There is even a photo booth downstairs. Fun!",2,,1
4,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,5.0,7/25/2018,"What a great little spot in the LES with amazing cocktails and super cool atmosphere.I had come here as a late night visit and had such a great time. Would definitely return, I just hope not too many people find out about this gem!",1,1,2
5,Dawn Q.,"New York, NY",330,50,26,4.0,10/6/2018,I've been here for drinks a few times now. The best time to go is on a nice day when you can take advantage of the back patio. On a quiet sunday afternoon you might even get lucky and have the place almost to yourself. I've also come latenight and the indoor area is always popping but not overwhelming. The interior is dark but feels lively and welcoming. The drinks are all quite good - haven't had one I didn't like! Would definitely come back if I'm in the area.,1,,
6,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,1/23/2018,"Been here a couple times now; mostly using it as a low key bar to grab a quick drink or two with some people. Regular setup of a few tables in the back and bar seating up front.They have your regular selection of beer on draft ($7-8) and a few ciders available as well. My most recent time here, ordered the Carta Falco II ($14) - a strong drink with mostly bourbon and a hint of lemon. It's certainly expensive for how much you get, though it does pack a punch. There is a small food menu here as well which I have never tried (tacos looked interesting).The bartenders here have always done a good job, and the space has never been crowded as far as I've been there. Good meetup bar for a quiet afternoon/evening.",5,2,3

8,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,2/24/2018,"TLDR: well-crafted cocktails in a laid back atmosphere; friendly serviceMet a friend for drinks here on a Sunday around 6:45pm. Although the bar was pretty small, with only a handful of tables and then bar seating, it was mostly empty. We decided to grab seats at the bar and were quickly served water to start. Although I was originally planning on ordering a glass of wine or beer, it was apparent from a quick look at the menu that ordering a cocktail would be the way to go.To start, I chose the pleasant demise (wint gin, st. georges spiced pear, lemon, housemade grenadine, thyme peychauds bitters). With front row seats at the bar, we watched the bartender expertly craft our cocktails. The pleasant demise was multidimensional--sweet, fruity, bitter, and strong all at the same time. I really enjoyed the taste of the spiced pear. Next, I tried the clara barton (fig-infused vodka, pomegranate, burnt orange syrup, lemon, anise). This cocktail was also excellent, with a sweet, fruity taste.We wanted to order snacks as well, but unfortunately the kitchen was closed that day (the bartender told us it was the chef's birthday and that he usually works really hard, so they gave him the day off, which we thought was sweet). Overall, this place has great service and a seasoned bartender, making it a great place to chat with friends over cocktails.",,,
9,April T.,"Bayonne, NJ",94,58,35,2.0,7/19/2017,"I don't get all the 4-ratings here. This was a 3 at best for drinks and 1-2 for food.Firstly, the food was terrible! Got the chicken tacos and BV hotdog. Both were bland but the hotdog was next level disgusting.  It was greasy and not even a nice reddish color that an all-beef hotdog should be. The taco was a bland, drippy mess.  Neither was worth any money spent on it!The drinks were mediocre. Wine is very small for $8 happy hour price. Hubby didn't like the mule special and the Jessica Rabbit was only ok.",,,
10,Ilona N.,"Queens, NY",46,66,44,4.0,7/2/2018,"I came here last friday as part of a large Reddit group. Thankfully I work nearby, so I was able to grab a seat at one of the tables reserved for us (yay, social anxiety!) before the place got insanely packed.Happy hour deals are so so, $10 instead of $14 for a cocktail is alright. I highly suggest the Jessica rabbit slushy cocktail (tequilla, and a bit of spiciness!). It was a crazy hot afternoon, even at 6pm, and this helped a bit.The bar is very cute, and there is also a back area with some tables (it was too packed for me to check out). It does get a little hard to hear after people crowd in, and the music gets blasted louder, and louder.We ordered our drinks at the bar, and the bartenders were really nice. The $3 tacos for happy hour were delicious, and a bit spicy as well. They also have Laphroaig and Glenlivet Whisky (not happy hour, clearly) which makes me happy. I recommend checking this place out with a few friends. I'm sure during the week it's not as crazy as a Friday night if you're worried about space.",,,
11,Erica W.,"Long Island, NY",72,213,517,5.0,12/3/2017,"This rating is for the cocktails only. And they are AMAZING cocktails. I was confused because they said they ""ran out of"" the first cocktail I ordered, but my second choice was fantastic. I got one of the gin drinks, but my favorite was the Jessica Rabbit that my friend got. The ambience here is nice too, intimate but not too romantic. Staff are very sweet too.",1,,
12,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,325,577,4.0,1/8/2018,"Nice cocktail bar in the LES with a good vibe. We stopped in here for a couple of post-dinner drinks on a Saturday night, and were happy to get in quickly since there was no line when we came here. The bartenders are friendly and serve up some delicious creative cocktails. The space is nicely done, feels warm and could be quite intimate on a quieter night (though it was fairly lively and crowded when we got there). They also had a DJ playing some great music that added to the great atmosphere. I would stop by again if I'm in the area.",,,
13,Kyle M.,"Manhattan, NY",40,170,148,5.0,9/26/2017,"Really cool cocktail spot with awesome drinks. I had the ""lay your rifles down"" which is gin, cucumber, lime, tonic, and black pepper. It was a nice refreshing mixed drink. After that I pounded a bunch of $5 tecates which I always find awesome for some odd reason. It wasn't too crowded but crowded enough for you to feel like you were actually out doing something. It might have been on the less crowded side because it was an end of summer weekend that I was here. Check it out, it won't disappoint.",3,,2
14,Eunice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",178,231,104,5.0,11/5/2017,"Been here twice and I've enjoyed myself both times! First time was during happy hour with a friend and second time in the evening with a group. As a group we stayed in the back yard. It's surprisingly warm outside, probably due to it's surrounding of buildings.Amazing cocktails and strong. Very good ambience and noise levels for conversation.",1,,

Tonight, I was here to meet a friend for a brief hello that included a happy hour glass of rose wine. That's it. Every single restaurant/bar/lounge/speakeasy will most likely serve wine.Though the surroundings and vibe was chill and good music was being played, I would definitely have to return again to try their notable cocktails and/or light bite.Until next time.",,,
16,Jackie O.,"New York, NY",6,54,10,5.0,3/21/2018,"Needed a low key, good ambiance, and good cocktails spot. Found this spot on Yelp and it came through! Right at the corner of Stanton and Chrystie, the place is super chill. HH was great, but their regular cocktails are amazing. The Salt and Ash is a must if you like grapefruit and semi-sweet drinks, it'll be a refreshing summer drink (if it ever comes).There are several seats and they have small food options, which are also included in HH. We were there for 2-3 hours and the place was always half full, but everyone was able to get their own seats. Can't wait to go back!",,,2
17,Mark L.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,2/12/2018,"Bonnie Vee has been one of my go-to cocktail spots for years.  The vibe is low-key but on-point trendy and the drinks are solid.  I am a particular fan of the Salt & Ash and Flawless Victory.  Perfect for laid back afternoon drinking or after dinner chic.  Great bar all around.  I am only now writing this overdue review because I just hosted an event there for 50 people.  I would encourage everyone looking for the perfect place for their next birthday, party, etc. to do it there.  The event team was amazing: from Jason's responsiveness with planning to Chelsea and Reggie's flawless service night of.  I got lots of compliments from friends to the tune of ""this was the best-run open bar I have been to.""  Cheers and thanks to Bonnie Vee!",1,,1
18,Jill M.,"New York, NY",12,160,1,5.0,1/28/2018,Made a pitstop at Bonnie Vee on my way to a birthday party. Loved the vibe and Jason the bartender was so welcoming. I only drank prosecco so I can't comment on the cocktails but I am definitely going back to try them out. This bar is so cozy and I loved the music they were playing as well. I definitely want to check out the back yard too!Definitely recommend if you're in the neighborhood.,1,,
19,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,5.0,12/29/2017,"I came here for a friends birthday and stuck to beer, so I can't comment on the cocktails. The venue is small and fills up fast, there's DJ on weekends, bathrooms are downstairs. What stood out to me most were the amazing, personable, and professional bartenders working there. Even with your usual LES weekend crowds they made time to make eye contact and smile without breaking a sweat. They made everyone feel like they were getting personalized attention even when things were really hectic, I'd come back just for that reason alone!",1,,1

21,Ariella G.,"Brooklyn, NY",223,82,9,5.0,5/18/2017,"I LOVE Bonnie Vee. While I have seen people get a bit sloppy/ratchet on weekend nights, during the week the vibe is much more laid back and low key. I love a well-made cocktail and Bonnie Vee has anything you could want and then some i.e. the Jessica Rabbit - its a slushie version of a spicy strawberry margarita with a kick! Not to mention they have a solid happy hour on select food and drinks during the week until 8pm. Other than that expect to pay standard Manhattan prices on drinks ($12-$14).The inside is dimly lit and sexy while the back garden area is casual and comfortable with numerous couches that are perfect for large groups. While the outdoor area closes at 10pm on weeknights, it is a really nice place to come grab some drinks and enjoy this beautiful weather. Bonnie Vee is for everybody: First dates, third dates, Tinder dates, girls night out or solo dolo.",3,,
22,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,3.0,4/12/2017,"This is an averaged rating, as the spectrum of ratings range from 1 stars to 5 stars in different areas. 1 star for the grilled cheese sandwich. Why does one go to a cocktail bar and order a grilled cheese sandwich? Because it's on the menu, and if it is, then more than a kraft single and webers bread is expected. The bread was crumbly and NOT buttered (ok there, I said it). Multiple people in the party ordered this and they all came out terribly. 5 stars for the ambiance, cocktails, and overall service! Seems like the type of place where you can go have boogie drinks, but don't count on it for a birthday bash that includes dinner, as the grilled cheese fell very short.",4,2,1
23,Jeannine M.,"Bayside, NY",17,358,35,4.0,11/29/2017,"Came here with friends. The place is nice and the staff are welcoming. The cocktails were better than very good. They have ""slushies"" which you must try. I also want to recommend trying the warm pretzel if you come with friends to share.",,,

There weren't too many people when I got there which is just how I like it, especially when you're with someone else and are trying to talk. Great music and drinks.

27,Kathryn T.,"Manhattan, NY",352,411,2622,4.0,11/24/2015,"I'm starting to wander into the LES for cocktails and I gotta say, it is pretty great. Bonnie Vee is one of the places that should be on your list to check out. The best way to describe this spot is: nice vibes. It's lowkey and a good change of pace.I came here right after work to meet up with a friend of mine and catch up. We got there a few minutes after BV opened so it was pretty empty. The staff was really helpful and accommodating throughout our whole time there. That goat cheese and bread? It's essentially all you really need with a good cocktail. I got the Flawless Victory which was a great cocktail. It was strong -- maybe a little past the Negroni level of strong. It's overall a good spot to hit. It has cocktails at the levels of Employees Only and Bathtub Gin but isn't too much of a crowd/scene.",7,3,3
28,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",223,218,634,5.0,4/24/2017,"Popped in here totally out of the blue and boy were we glad to have found this hidden gem. The cocktails were unique and strong - but beware of the Hot Buttered Rum, this little guy is buttery-rich AF it might clog your arteries if you haven't been working out. I was secretly glad it was my bf who ordered it and not me because I wouldn't have been able to finish it. I also tried the Flawless Victory and Midnight Society and had a sip of bf's Untold Story - all excellent. Bartender was super friendly as well. Ambience was dark and intimate, good for a date spot. We didn't order any food but it sure smelled delicious whatever it was. Will definitely return if I'm ever in the area again and looking for a good cocktail.",33,15,25

The inside is dimly lit with some seating around the walls and a decent amount of standing room. My favorite area is the outside patio - filled with comfy outdoor couches and coffee tables with candles lit, its the perfect spot to relax with friends and be able to hear each other talk. Now to the important part: the drinks. I was blown away, every drink I tried was amazing. They're around $15 each, and worth every penny. Order the ""Flawless Victory"" and thank me later.",,,1

33,Marissa M.,"New York, NY",261,30,23,4.0,4/12/2017,"I hosted my birthday party at Bonnie Vee in November. Jason was so wonderful to work with. They reserved four tables in the back of the bar for my group (which the held despite us being a little late due to traffic) and allowed us to bring balloons and birthday treats with us. After the party, Jason followed up to make sure everything went well. Very nice touch!The bar feels intimate with dim lighting and small tables scattered around the edges of the room. However, as the night progresses, the music gets turned up and there is ample room to dance and mingle. The bartenders are friendly and were extremely accommodating to our large group.The cocktails are great and reasonably priced, especially for the neighborhood. They also have a decent selection of beer and a good happy hour from 5-8pm. In the summer, they have a nice garden area as well!Complete hidden gem. Will continue to go back!",,,1

I always end up suggesting it as a meet up spot and we never regret it. I could have sworn that I have ordered a cocktail called something like The Most Wonderful Drink In The World, and really enjoyed it, but can no longer find it on the menu online. Maybe this was a figment of my imagination and I just attribute the most wonderful drinks I've had to the talented bartenders at Bonnie Vee. Either way, you can't go wrong ordering from their inventive cocktail menu, though they won't judge you for getting something more simple from the bar either!",10,4,9

The drink of the day was an Old Fashioned, which I had and it was delicious and since that's my fave drink, I'm a bit picky. I also had a drink with bourbon, red wine and absinthe, which seems like the nightmare hangover of the century waiting to happen, but was surprisingly tasty and I felt great the next day. For food items, I tried the cheese plate which we shared. The Brussels Sprouts are surprisingly delicious, as were the tater tots. I was expecting whatever bar food, but the selections were all excellent. The best thing about this place is the awesome vibe and the friendly staff.

42,Alex V.,"Jersey City, NJ",310,275,502,4.0,9/7/2014,"Pretty nice bar, especially if you're looking to start drinking early on a weekend, since this place opens before most of the other cocktail lounges in the area. If you get a chance to come here in the summer, ask to sit outside in the patio. Very relaxed vibe, with a giant, artistic clock propped up above a stairway (which incidentally leads to the restroom -- didn't realize that until later).We did come here early and it was pretty quiet indeed, which was actually pretty nice.The quality of the cocktails was spot on. I really loved the Salt & Ash one. Really smokey taste and the light bit of salt somehow makes sense.The bartender-owner was pretty cool. The only thing is (and here's where he lost a star), when I was ready to close out the check, the first thing I mentioned was that I'd like a glass of water. He seemed kinda more focused on closing out the check than anything else, and forgot my water. And it wasn't busy (my wife and I were the only customers at the time). It's alright though, just wondering how he does when it's busy.",2,,

The music is so fun and after the crowd thins out there's some good times to be had dancing! I was there with a group of people of various ages and at some point every single person was excited about what was playing. I'm also loving that the bathrooms never have lines, are clean and well stocked. They close at 2am so you don't have to deal with super trashed people.

The bar tenders did not pay attention to the anyone but their own friends and the bouncer kept saying judgmental comments to the girls at the party for 'stumbling' in their heels. It ruined the whole vibe of the party. Ultimately the entire party ended up leaving to go to a different bar around the corner because the staff was so rude and made everyone feel uncomfortable.I would NOT recommend this bar and I am never coming here again.,5,1,

51,Alex W.,"New York, NY",61,163,132,5.0,8/16/2015,"Bonnie Vee's was nice enough to host an event on a hot Sunday afternoon to commemorate National Rum Month and we were lucky enough to be a part of that and check out they had to offer. They gave the first 150 guests complimentary rum cocktail slushies and rum infused cookies. Both were delicious and refreshing.In terms of ambiance, there is a neat garden in the back with plenty of couch seating that could fit a party of 7 together. The interior has a great rustic feel and although I thought the basement where the bathrooms were was just a tad dark (or maybe my eyes haven't adjusted yet from sitting under the sun), there is a photo booth down there where I can see two newly met strangers there have a little fun with.The other cocktails on the menu were crafted well and with great service, I could see this being a nice date spot.",,,

Checked this out on yelp and decided to give it a go because of all the great reviews. The prices for happy hour are ridiculous(even for NYC), and the wine/cocktails are not worth it. Not much to choose from in terms of bar snacks either. The malbec seemed like a very cheap bottle of wine.

Not your typical Friday night bar, but more of a classy bar that will still let you get wild and let loose. While they do have your typical jack and cokes and gin and tonic, they have an interesting cocktail menu with some different drinks. Most of the cocktails are specialties, but they're open to making you a concoction of their own. One of your higher end bars, but nice for a change of pace on a rare night out. The place is a big small and it does get packed, so get her a little earlier to enjoy some drinks and the vibe. Definitely check this fun, cool place out!",,,

Cocktails.  Drinks were a bit off balance for a place that bills itself as a mixology place.  A friend had to send back a drink because it was too tart and had no resemblance to what was ordered, and I had to ask for more simple syrup for mine.  About 2 and a half hours into our party, we were asked to clear the area with about 15 minutes' notice for a reservation.  This, after we spent about $300 in drinks.  Waitress made no effort to accomodate us further.  So in a nutshell, go for one standard drink (beer or wine) during happy hour at the bar and go elsewhere for the cocktails.",1,,

And I will happily return for many alcohols in the future.But if I can offer one piece of advice: Do not get the One-Thirty. I repeat, DO NOT DRINK THIS DRINK. There's a reason they reserve the right to refuse to serve it to you. It's essentially a boozier, classier Long Island Iced Tea,* and imbibing after having consumed many other drinks, it may or may not result in:1. Nausea.2. Memory loss.3. Nudity.4. Unemployment.5. The beginning and/or the end of many friendships, both desirable and undesirable.

The bouncers were actually pretty insistent we stop in for a drink. Ooookay, then. The inside was very elegantly decorated, and there was a great deal of intimate mood lighting. I tried the Flawless Victory, as I'm a big fan of bourbon-based drinks, and the name is pretty awesome. I really liked the bourbon bite, and that it wasn't too sweet, even with the pineapple and honey. The ginger kick was also something I didn't expect, but really enjoyed. The bartenders put a lot of time and effort into the cocktails, and it definitely showed.I ended up sticking to beer for the rest of the night, and the selection is pretty decent. Can't go wrong with a Bitburger or Goose Island IPA. I also saw that there was a food menu, but it seemed pretty limited to bar snacks and sandwiches.We were able to snag a couple tables in the back for a party of 6. Great to just chill back with a beer or a cocktail. I also loved that it wasn't too crowded, even on a Saturday night. I guess there was a ""private party"" but considering that they were letting other people in, seemed like it wasn't that busy.Quite curious that last call is at 1:45am. This is the city that never sleeps, right? C'mon son. This would be great for a weeknight date though, and I'll definitely be back to try the other cocktails.",4,3,3

But then it has these touches of glam in the lighting and wall coverings and then it was really warm and comfortable with the dark wood bar and ruby red tufted leather seating, I just loved it.  At only 3 months old, the place was really quiet on a Friday night, but I imagine on a beautiful summer day the place is going to be packed... bonus- they're currently completing work on their back patio.  Should be open by the time summer hits. Happy hour specials aren't too bad at all.  All wines and beers are discounted, as well as some food.  Parmesan Truffle Tater Tots.  Need I say more?  $5 during happy hour.  I do wish though they had tossed the tots a bit instead of just piling the shredded parm on top, I think it would have been even more effective that way.  They also had a Truffle Grilled Cheese that I imagine would also be amazing, right?  And that bad boy is $8 during happy hour.Oh, and the drinks they're serving up are delish.  Of course it was Yelp Drinks week so we tried their specialty concoctions: Pacific Front (Starr, orange liqueur, fresh lime, pineapple, fresh OJ, house made grenadine) and the Susan Travers (Starr, honey syrup, lemon, topped off with Prosecco).  Both were $7.  Their regular cocktail menu starts around $12, which for me is a little high, but I believe the quality is there.  The Pacific Front was so fruity and yummy.  If this is any indication of what's on their regular menu- I can't wait to try them all!",2,,1

I hear there's an outdoor area, but I didn't get to see it. That being said, the inside was cozy enough and there was space to hang out, even with our group of 7.

Updated review","Went back the other week and sat outside in the back garden. It was a lovely and nice surprise to sit outside on a warm night.This bar keeps getting better and the owners are obviously working hard to make improvements. The cocktails are excellent, service friendly and it feels really good there like a proper bar. Not a pub, not a wanky cocktail spot, just a really nice drinking spot to hang with friends.",,,

78,Kathy c.,"Manhattan, NY",6,76,24,4.0,8/14/2016,"Came here on a Saturday night for my fiance's birthday.  I had no problem making a reservation for space that same week for 10 people.  Our reserved seats were along the bar by the entrance with a wall sofa, chairs, and round top tables.  Venue was perfect.  We are past our young early 20 years, but still love to have a great time.  The place had a good crowd .. Didn't feel like we were at a college party, not too crowded, fun music, good drinks, and can easily dance or stand around and won't feel out of place. Music was a fun mix of hip hop and high energy hits from every decade starting from the 80's till today.  Everyone loved the music and had a great time dancing!The cocktail selection was good - we drank Jessica rabbits and the mule drink all night.There was a garden in the back, but we didn't check it out - it was 95 degrees with 100% humidity that day.  The air conditioning didn't quite keep up with the outside heat, as we were all a bit sweaty even just sitting around.  Had a fun time nevertheless.",,,
79,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11,5.0,3/15/2015,"What a lovely find! I came looking for a craft cocktail bar that didn't have the pretensions of a speakeasy (despite loving them) as I was just meeting up with friends to catch up and didn't want to deal with the anxiety of playing the ""will we get in and how long will it take"" game. Bonnie Vee fit the bill perfectly. For a Saturday evening, it was crowded enough for the bar to not feel dead but allowed for ample breathing/walking room. My friends and I were able to get a table within 5 mins of arriving.What else? Ambiance is relaxed and intimate. Decor evokes a wonderful 1940s charm that oddly enough, turns into 1940s Cuban charm when they start playing salsa music and you suddenly notice the wooden ceiling fans and indoor palm tree...though no one else seemed to agree with me.The cocktails themselves were pretty good, though I wouldn't say they necessarily stand up to those from other speakeasies/craft cocktail bars I've been to. I personally had the Midway and Clara Barton. Both had some sort of bitters in them, weren't overly sweet, and were fairly refreshing. It's slightly off the beaten LES path, but I'll definitely be returning. Plus, I still need to check out their patio area. Thank goodness spring is coming.",,,1
80,Charley K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",89,277,0,5.0,3/29/2015,"What a place to find on a Saturday night! Bonnie Vee is a great candidate for a first date drinks or late night cocktails. The decor and dim lighting evokes a off-the-beaten-path respite during the WWI era. The soundtrack is ""indiestream"" (e.g., Phoenix) and upbeat, but never overbearing. For a bustling bar, the service was attentive and speedy (and with a great sense of humor). Beyond a rotating selection of beers, Bonnie Vee offers some interesting and inventive cocktails. Strong, but tasty. (I particularly recommend the Midway.) This is a lovely new bar, I hope it becomes a standard!",,,

104,John C.,"Manhattan, NY",294,13,0,5.0,11/30/2014,"Almost don't want to review this place so that nobody finds it.  Talk about an atmosphere making you feel like you're in the 20's.  The lighting, the vibe, the music.  It's a classy feel and extremely low key, excellent for having a great conversation.  The cocktails are extremely well done.  Def a favorite and I hope nobody finds it.",1,,
105,Andrew R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,6/21/2016,"Went last night for the first time. Great outdoor patio with comfy couches & table service. Drinks were stiff, and snacks tasty. Will definitely go back.",,,
106,Kathy B.,"New York, NY",2,6,0,4.0,4/25/2015,"Cute spot and super friendly staff!! Looked into hosting a charity event here and they were prompt, accommodating and eager to support. Looking forward to spending some Saturday afternoons in their backyard!",,,
107,Jordan T.,"Koreatown, Manhattan, NY",0,21,0,5.0,4/18/2016,"Fantastic bar, amazing service. Great chill vibes, and the garden patio is beautiful and just has the perfect feel for a relaxing night outside of the hubbub of NYC living. Again, cannot say more about how great the staff is, seriously wonderful. Thanks!",,,
108,Paisley K.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",8,26,3,4.0,6/26/2014,"I was surprised at how good the drinks were here, and that is saying a lot because a) I am a snob about cocktails and anything one imbibes or ingests in general b) I barely even drink anymore and am not usually easily enthused by the quality of any given cocktail I may drink. I had the carefully prepared Pimm's Cupp and it tasted like roses, gin, juniper, and summer. The cucumbers in the bottom were so fun to fish out and eat. Atmosphere was great: dimly lit and furnished in rich whiskey tones, candles everywhere, and music tasteful and not too loud.",1,1,1
109,Evangeline W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,34,0,5.0,3/9/2015,"Came here to use the whiskey passport and got a Manhattan.  It was really good, and the vibe was really great.  Music wasn't too loud, casual atmosphere, and a really great cocktails menu. I would definitely come back here.",,,
110,Elizabeth V.,"New York, NY",248,94,61,5.0,4/23/2015,I sorta don't want others to find out about this wonderful spot!! Cocktails are $12 or $13 with wine reasonably priced as well. There is a beautiful outside lounge that stays open till 11pm! Definitely coming back on a sunny day!,,,
111,C. T.,"New York, NY",25,164,71,4.0,3/3/2014,"Loved our Sunday afternoon at BV.  Owner Jason was great fun to banter with and helpful with suggestions for drinks and small bites, atmosphere was welcoming, and definitely not the $$$$ listed.  Can't wait till their garden space opens up!",2,,1
112,Sunil G.,"New York, NY",8,145,17,5.0,3/26/2014,"Everything you want in a cocktail bar. The bartender knows what to make without pretending he has a PhD in mixology, absolutely no talking down and let me tell you the drinks he comes up with were great. Admittedly we did go on a very quiet Tuesday evening but I'm sure when we return it will be great as well.",2,,
113,Yael Q.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/22/2015,"Best date spot - amazing drinks and food, love the outdoor patio too, great vibe overall.",,,
114,Amy L.,"Alameda, CA",449,141,15,4.0,2/15/2014,"Cute cocktail bar with solid drinks and service, romantic lightning, nice tunes, no attitude.",2,,
115,Jenny K.,"Bronx, NY",31,12,0,3.0,3/15/2015,"Went here on Thursday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Apparently he made an attempt to reserve a table for us (us being approximately 12-15 people).  They were not able to reserve the table apparently because there were 2 other parties earlier but said we could take the table once one of those parties left...well duh. Anyway the drinks were okay, I had more than one ""Flawless Victory,"" the first time around it was delicious but the 2nd time it was too sweet.  The inconsistency turned me off especially, at $16 a drink they better get it right every time! I thought these prices were kind of high considering the place has a vibe/feeling of a dive bar.  It was definitely clean and the music not bad but theres way more spots in the immediate area with cheaper, consistent drinks and better service. I would probably not go back unless required to.",,,
116,Jordan P.,"Venice, CA",340,5,1,5.0,11/26/2013,"My new spot! Bonnie Vee is bringing Stanton back ;) killer vibes, great service, epic space.",2,1,1
117,C L.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,3/20/2015,"Hands down best bar in the area. Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, great staff. I can go and on. In warmer weather, be sure to check out the back patio area. There's also a photo booth downstairs by the bathrooms. Love this place. Can't recommend it enough.",,,
118,D H.,"San Francisco, CA",1,23,0,5.0,12/20/2013,"Wandering by on a Monday night with a buddy of mine who lives in the area, we decided to check it out. Glad we did.This place stands out mostly for what it's not, given the current, unfortunate trend of pretentious, douchey cocktail joints that take themselves way too seriously and really just end up making you feel uncomfortable and weird.Bonnie Vee is NOT that place. It's inviting, cozy, and classy, but most of all friendly. The two owners were behind the bar and although they obviously take their craft seriously, they are cool about it. They seem to me to be just a couple of very nice, chill guys who are trying to do it right and hoping to attract like-minded folks.The drinks we had were great, without over-the-top embellishment or some flashy display of showmanship to make them so. Tasty booze, period.Chatted with the fellas for awhile, downed our drinks, enjoyed a complimentary shot, and out we went with a friendly handshake and an invitation to return. We most definitely will.Check the place out, its cool, in a good way.",2,,
119,Katie W.,"Manhattan, NY",200,526,342,4.0,5/15/2014,"Heard about Bonnie Vee through Thrillist and decided to give it a try on Saturday night a few months ago with Mike B.  It was pretty empty but the bartender was great.  Told us about their original bar in Williamsburg and this new venture in the LES.  He explained they didn't have servers yet, but we could sit in the back lounge seating and just raise our hand when we wanted to order something and he would come over.  Dark, romantic feel with fun music, but not too loud so you don't have to scream over each other.  I got the ""Salt & Ash"" and love it!  So delicious and smokey!  Liked it so much came back the next weekend with friends and it was definitely more packed.",,,1
120,Arthur O.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",1,8,0,5.0,1/28/2015,"This place is a little cozy gem.  Intimate bar, convenient location.  Couches, great music, nice bartender. No TVs, no local yuppies, no sports junkies.  My favorite new new Nolita spot.",,,
121,Taneesha C.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",8,136,6,4.0,7/20/2014,"Great cocktail vibe with nice vibe and garden. Gin and Tonic was $11 and very well mixed.They also have a food/bites menu. I will definitely be back, Jason was there the night I went very cool bartender.",,,
122,Nate R.,"Englewood, NJ",6,36,8,5.0,10/25/2014,"Good beer, nice atmosphere and outdoor area. But best part is they have clean and well kept bathrooms. Seriously, for a bar in NYC on the les it's worth leaving a good review for.",,,
123,Allee S.,"Washington D.C., DC",227,16,0,5.0,7/21/2014,"This is a really sweet spot for a happy hour. I brought a few of my friends to the bar and we enjoyed the atmosphere, drinks, and bartenders. Highly recommend stopping by for a chill drink.",,,

126,Anthony C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,8/18/2015,"Just stopped in for an early beer. Not very welcoming. Bar tender disinterested. Went to One Mile House a short walk away on Delancey, much, much better; friendly and great beer selection.",,,
127,Clint H.,"Nolita, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/10/2014,We found this place on Yelp and were extremely pleased with the results. It's only new so didn't have that many reviews so as out of towners ( Australia) we were pleasantly surprised. Owners at the bar making the best cocktails we have had so far. Fresh ingredients and a lot of skill definitely worth a look if you like strong well mixed cocktails.,,,
128,Lauren J.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/31/2014,I've found my regular hang. Good drinks good people. Can't wait for the back garden to open in the spring,,,
