Updated review","Munchery is a prepared meals dinner-only delivery service which averages about the same as you'd spend ordering from a casual take out restaurant, if not a little less. But the food tastes ""cleaner"" or at least novel and different. The food is totally delicious, too. And they offer a fun, eclectic variety of food, which I like. There are many things I like I like here but the jerk chicken is particularly delicious. Entrees usually come with one, if not two, sides. There are kid-sized and kid friendly foods for working parents.They have drinks like Pellegrino and cold brew. They even have desserts. Order the broccoli cheddar soup - trust. Pro Tip: Copy and paste this link to save a whopping $20 off your first order, basically a free mealmunchery.com/invite/ZJ22…",3,1,
2,Joyce Y.,"New York, NY",108,40,11,3.0,10/2/2017,"Have used Munchery 2 or 3 times without issue. Delivery is generally within the window, the menu selections are good, and the food is tasty. It's kind of pricy - you're not really saving much by ordering Munchery over eating out. But they say all the ingredients are fresh, local, whatever. It is definitely a convenient dinner option. However, I started paying attention to calories recently (getting married soon - commence nervous sweating) and holy crap!!! I was not expecting to find that my Kale Pesto Cavateppi contains 66% of the daily recommended intake of fat (780 cal total, 43% DV sat fat).  Not that they advertise the food as being low fat or low calorie. Just a word of caution for those counting calories.",3,,
3,C O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,4,0,1.0,5/12/2018,"Shady. They charged me a meal, which never showed up and the next day announced that they were closing all operations. My account shows 'canceled refund' but the charge hit my credit card.Stay away from these guys.",,,
4,N F.,"New York, NY",79,60,55,1.0,11/9/2017,"I realized I was being charged for 8 months in an auto-renewed subscription. Once I realized it, I pleaded to customer service to understand that It was a mistake. Their emails all look like spam because it's titled from ""Chef Bridget Siegel"". They refused to refund the last 8 months. I do understand, but I wish they had some sympathy. And with a lot of healthy food delivery service competition I'm guessing they won't be around much longer. I called Amazon on behalf of our employee who can't speak English that well, after he unknowingly autorenewed to Amazon prime. I called and without QUESTION they understood and instead of taking $260 which they (and munchery) have every right in taking, they said they completely sympathize and refunded him. Mealpal is another great example. I bought a subscription but found out about a work trip that would not allow me to utilize all meals. Without question they refunded me with no qualms. Dropbox, same deal. Jibjab, same deal. A lot of companies have these auto renew subscriptions and many understand that people forget. Amazon said it best, ""it honestly happens all the time and we want to work with you, not against you"". Munchery has a lot to learn. They've lost a customer and probably many more with companies like Mealpal out there.",2,,

I'd like to stay a customer.",3,,
6,Waleska L.,"Seattle, WA",47,11,18,2.0,6/7/2017,"Munchery is making me miss ""Lish"" service. Whatever you do, do not order the ""Beef, Bean, & Queso Dip."" Unless you love eating fatty ground beef with sharp bones. The ""Beef, Bean and Queso Dip"" had a lot of thick pieces of gross tasting fat mixed with tiny amounts of ground beef. In fact, not much ground beef at all but thick fat. Also sharp bones that almost shocked me had I not being careful. The ground beef at my local supermarket tastes better quality than what was used in this dish. It was such a horrendous experience I do not want to order Munchery again. For the price paid for the overall Munchery service, this ""Beef, Bean, & Queso Dip"" dish was quite disappointing and small.The quality, taste, and portions of Munchery have unfortunately recently declined. I would had written a better review before. Something has obviously changed. Perhaps a different cook? Either way, there should be someone to check for quality levels because the dish I tasted was unacceptably unhealthy and disgusting.",,,

Updated review","Had used them since they started in NYC, never figured out their so called membership.But I wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole. The prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. Their chefs seem to think if salt is poured on it either improves or masks the food. With every new offering the sodium count increases. There is no quality control, the food sometimes has to be thrown out because it cannot beeaten.Forget it, I have complained so many times and have never received an answer. I paid the yearly fee and when I called to cancel was told that I could not get a refund but had to use it up.",1,,
8,D B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,32,183,4.0,1/6/2017,"This is our first week ordering from Munchery.  The food is a step above our usual take out, & our orders have been promptly delivered.

9,Leana D.,"New York, NY",36,169,121,5.0,6/29/2017,"All of the food is so good, there hasn't been anything that I thought wasn't absolutely delicious.  The food quality and taste is impressive and I love that when I don't have time to order/shop for groceries or cook that I can still have a delicious meal at home.  I do hate that I have to order it to work and then schlep it to the South Bronx to share with my husband; I would seriously do anything for them to service the Hunts Point neighborhood.",,,
10,Harvey N.,"Larchmont, NY",0,4,1,1.0,1/10/2018,"Munchers BewareI was given a Munchery gift certificate by a friend. In order to use it, I had to open an account and provide a credit card. The meals I received were ok but, frankly, not spectacular. It took me a while to use the full gift certificate. Recently, I noticed charges on my credit card and later realized that they had been applied monthly for the previous ten months. I called Munchery's customer service and received a call back saying Munchery, as a subscription meal delivery service, charged monthly fees regardless of orders and that I had been notified of these charges initially (which is possible) and through email (which I could not find). Seeing that I had not used this service in several months they indicated this would be my last month unless I chose to remain a customer. I had no desire to continue with the service.I have no intention to argue this further but I did want to share my experience which, like several other reviewers below, left me feeling unsatisfied and annoyed. Go in with eyes open.",,,
11,Paul D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,34,5,4.0,11/2/2017,"We have been using Munchery for almost 2 years, and they have honestly been a lifesaver since my son was born. The food is always consistent, occasionally we have a minor issue but their team handles it, they honestly give a shit, which is appreciated. The food itself is really good, with a lot of consistent weekday meal options. It's on the expensive side but the convenience factor for us wins out. Keep up the good work Munchery!",,,
12,Mary P.,"New York, NY",25,5,0,4.0,10/31/2017,This service is so cool. A great way to order in healthy food for a way more affordable price then typical take out. So far the meals have been super tasty and I love the convenience this provides my busy life.,,,
13,Alice Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",141,28,59,4.0,2/25/2017,"I tried out Munchery for free (just paid $2.95 for delivery) and for that price it was great. With the hectic schedule in NYC it is hard to find time to cook, so getting delivery of a good meal for almost-free is incredible. I got the pan-seared salmon over rice bowl because it was most  popular and the most expensive on the menu at $13. My expectations were thus very high so I was disappointed when the rice tasted a bit hard (old?) and the fish and roe were way too salty (but then again, roe is always salty). So I just made some fresh rice at home to balance out the salt, and it lasted two meals instead of one, and I see that as a win. The dish also comes with a dash of asparagus and pickled radish which was light and good. I also got a ""Mom's Secret Sauce with Pasta"" ($7, kid's meal) which had an *interesting* taste. Like I'm not sure if it had gone bad or if the taste was intended to be just very very peculiar. But I didn't get sick so it's a non-issue, I just wouldn't get it again. You can tell that a lot of care and thought went into the packaging of each dish, as they print out the name of the chef who prepared it, how to eat it (whether it is recommended to heat or not, etc), and the full ingredients and nutritional value of each dish you ordered. They even snuck in a free dessert for me to make my first experience ""a bit sweeter"". What a nice surprise!So one star off because I personally wouldn't get the same dishes again, but they have a lot of other dishes that look worth trying so I will definitely try something else. For almost-free, it's a great deal. They have a lot of different coupons for first timers and repeat customers but here is the best one I know of, for $20 off and free 1st month membership (no minimum requirement, but you still need to pay $2.95 delivery): munchery.com/invite/20of…You can easily get two dishes for free like I did, or a dish and a side or dessert. After one month, they will charge a $9 monthly fee if you don't cancel after your first free month. Keep in mind that they only deliver for a very late lunch or dinner time (3:30pm - 9pm), only on weekdays if you're in NYC, and you have to order at least a day in advance. The delivery guy texted a few times to give heads up before arriving, which was nice.",1,,
14,Lynne D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,3,5.0,4/26/2018,"I have been using Munchery for over a year and just love it.  It's incredibly convenient, there is always a good variety of meals to choose from, and the quality is not only very good, but consistent.",,,

The food comes to you cold and you have to assemble and heat things up.  It really is like eating leftovers.  I'd rather just order from one of the hundreds of restaurants that are in my neighborhood. On the plus side, I like how tip is included in the delivery, and they do have a courier deliver the food to you when you have it scheduled.",7,2,1

The portions are small, some of the food is really tasty but some just comes out bland.It's a cute idea, maybe it'll be worth revisiting down the road once they fix their kinks.",1,,1
19,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,4.0,6/23/2015,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I've never been a fan of these delivery services, I always feel like they're too ambitious in their culinary choices. But this time around I was pleasantly surprised.They had sent a promotional mailer to my office that had $12 off your first order, which is the only reason I even tried them. They charge a $3 delivery fee, so without the discount my order of an appetizer and entree would have come to $29 before tip- not the most affordable option for takeout. But then not bad for a steak and shrimp dinner, and certainly not in Tribeca, which is where I had them deliver to. It seems like when you order the day of, the choices get very limited. My first choices were all sold out by 2pm. So I went with the Creole Style Peel and Eat Shrimp ($9.95) and the Grilled Lemongrass NY Strip Steak ($15.95).Each item comes in fancy packaging with instructions on how to heat up your meal, both for the oven and microwave. I used the microwave and we have a very strong one, so I found that a minute for my steak was sufficient. In general, I'd advise to reheat the food gently. The shrimp were super tasty and tender! I was impressed with the quality. I prefer my peel and eat shrimp to have all their skin on- hell leave the heads on if possible! They just have more flavor that way, and these had been stripped to the tail, but were still tasty. The Old Bay remoulade was sooooo freakin good. Don't expect too much ""Creole"" flavor, or ""spiciness"" as the name suggests, but this is par for the course outside of NOLA anyway. You get 10 nicely plump shrimp too, so the price point is good. Overall nicely done. I didn't know the food arrived cold and when I discovered this was the case I was immediately worried about how it would hold up after being nuked. The good news is everything was delicious and did not taste microwaved at all! Not sure how this was possible but everything tasted very fresh. What I wasn't happy about was my steak being well done. I did not see a space on the site to specify how I wanted it cooked, but assumed anyone would know not to deliver a well done steak. The microwave only made the situation worse. The steak was VERY tough. Until I got to the very center piece I did not see any red- but once I did I found the flavor was really nice! The herbed butter they included was totally overpowering and eradicated the nice lemongrass flavor, it's not needed. The portobello mushroom and red bell peppers were delicious, but the star of the show were the mashed potatoes. The description said wasabi, which they tasted nothing of, but the garlic I did taste was great. Honestly some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, I just added a little salt and pepper. The service was great. Their earliest delivery time is between 4-5pm. I chatted with someone on the site asking if they could come closer to 4pm, and they said they would let the driver know but couldn't make any promises. My food got here at 4:10- score! They also gave me a free little snack cake for dessert- I'm stuffed!So the short of it is I'd be hesitant to order steak again till they work out the kinks, and for me I'm not sure the price point will end up being worth it, but it's a nice option to have and their food is solid.",7,2,3
20,Jessica T.,"New York, NY",164,168,1,2.0,6/13/2016,"I've ordered a couple of times. I have mixed thoughts.First of all, it works well if you order ahead. Otherwise you get hit with a 4.95 delivery fee, which is a bit much. If you work and have to stay late and it's not always foreseeable, I don't think this is a great service. You can't change the delivery time, and it's much more expensive to get it delivered instantly. The hour window makes this even more inconvenient because you become stuck at your apartment waiting for food. The delivery fee is in addition to the tip. It arrives cold. I get that's the point, but if I'm super hungry I don't want to wait to heat it up. I'm certainly not going to break out a pot like the directions suggest sometimes. If I wanted to cook, I would cook.Prices are reasonable, though the whole idea of membership for cheaper prices, disincentivizies the occasional user. Mostly, I got roped into the free month and forgot to cancel. Beware you actually have to email them to cancel, there is no button on the website.The food is generally good. I don't know how healthy it is. Some things seem shockingly low in calories, while other seem really high (1000 plus for a beef dish). You see the same things again and again though.",4,,

22,Nicole R.,"Manhattan, NY",269,4,2,1.0,3/27/2016,"Be very careful. The nutritional information is not accurate. Two times I inquired about specific nutrition information because the food tasted way too good to be that low in calories. 1) They mismark the servings in the container. I ordered potato bread. The website and box said there is one serving per container and that the calories were 100 per serving. After I emailed I found out there were four servings for container. Totaling 300 extra calories than advertised. 2) I love their yaki udon. It's delicious. I could not believe it was only 220 calories. When I emailed to ask about it they told me that the calories were not accurate. That they don't include the chili oil that comes inside the container in the total. No where does it tell you that. The calorie total comes to over 400 calories. After speaking with them they blamed it on a discrepancy between different chefs preparing the dish and wouldn't acknowledge that this is an actual problem. I only inquired about 2 dishes and found out both were calculated incorrectly. Would be scared to know the nutrition information for the other items I consumed. Bottom line. Food is delicious. If you aren't counting calories or worried about nutrition. Go for it. If you are, be very careful. For the record, I never posted a negative review on Yelp.",12,,

They only deliver within two time slots, so you have to order ahead. They give nutritional facts with macros. Tastes better and healthier than eating out.Doordash: Lots of food options but quality of food depends on where you live. VERY expensive delivery fee which makes it only good for convenience.

These include Freshly, Maple, Sprig, Spoon Rocket, and others I'm forgetting - I've tried every one more than a couple times, many times with the generous promotions and discounts they provide to 1st time customers. That said, Munchery for me is by far the #1 - I recently ordered a couple of their meals after not ordering from them for more than a year (after I ran out of promotions to exploit on all the food options out there), and my decision to return to Munchery did not disappoint. Their quality, taste and portion size is significantly better than the competition. I can personally vouch for this after trying more than a dozen ready meal services. Ingredients are high quality, healthy, not too salty/fatty/greasy and it just tastes good. I'm not just leaving a nice review so someone could use my referral code and I get $20. I don't care. This is a good company making good food, straight up. Personally I'm not into meal kit deliveres, I think they are overpriced and require tons of preparation.

34,Michelle F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,4.0,10/29/2017,"Munchery in NYC delivers pre-made food every night to your home/work. Although it is similar to ordering out or leftovers, I have noticed it takes a lot off my place (no pun intended). I no longer have to worry about what to eat, ordering, picking up, etc. I literally get home and the food is waiting for me and I just heat in their microwave/oven safe dish. The food is yummy and tastes home cooked, which is different from what you would expect from ordering out at a typical NYC restaurant. The only downside is that some dishes are high in calories/fat. While I do try to portion how much dressing/gravy/sauce I put, it still adds up. Also, the sizes of the dishes vary. Costumer service is good- they have been accommodating when I mistakingly bought food with bacon (which I do not eat) and have always delivered within the time frame.

I'm a vegetarian, so when I forgot to choose my meals this week, they chose my meals, 5/6 of which have meat in them. They don't let you choose any food preferences when you sign up (which would be great, because if I had forgotten to order, at least I could have received vegetarian meals), they don't tell you that they will choose your meals without notifying you, and they don't remind you to choose your meals each week. So now I'm being charged for 5 meals that I can't eat and will likely have to throw away.

(For the price, I would have been better going to my local deli and getting Boar's Head.)  It had no brisket texture and was absolutely tasteless.  I had to split the good pieces with the unappetizing meat so neither of us were the least bit satisfied.  And that big wedge of cabbage - tasteless and gas inducing.    (I wish I could show a photo...really bad.)Also, if you use a promotion or flyer, they force a membership on you (although the first 30-days are free).  I don't understand the value of the membership except that they apparently aren't making enough money on the food alone or their customer acquisition costs are too high.",,,

My boyfriend got the chicken and quinoa taco bowl. My salmon had to be reheated for 20 minutes before it was even room temperature on the inside, which was frustrating -- in less time than that, I could cook a fresh salmon. Both our meals were also VERY bland. For the price, I don't think it was justified. Once the meals are reheated, they just take like sad leftovers.All in all, I'd rather just order take-out or cook for myself.",,,

63,Lynette C.,"New York, NY",22,98,32,2.0,5/4/2015,"It was a bit off putting to get the food delivered cold. Yeah yeah I know, different delivery model, you don't have to eat it right away etc. But there's something about having hot food delivered hot whether on a table or out of a bag. For the Panang curry with shrimp, the rice for example, was just a hard glacier like leftover rice tipped out of a plastic Chinese take out container. The sauce was OK - more like a dressing than an actual curry. The honey tea braised chicken thighs were tender as thighs generally are, but somewhat rubbery after sufficient reheating. The sauce it came with had a metallic taste. Thus, the food most closely approximates reheated but leftovers, which I guess, is a novel spin on purchased food. With the $20 intro coupon, 2 mains still cost me $7 plus a tip for the delivery guy, so the economics of it are somewhat like 2 small meals for the price of one. Then you've got all this tree-killing packaging - fancy bag, a way too substantial cardboard sleeve around each dish, plastic tops ... I might give it another go, and just go back to takeout from the handful of restaurants in the nabe.",2,,

I work pretty long hours, and am enrolled in a part time MBA program, so I have zero time for cooking. I was tired of eating take out salads and wanted a healthy takeout option. After hearing about Munchery I decided to try it. I signed up for the free membership yesterday and ordered a meal to be left at my apartment between 6-7. The meal arrived timely and I got a text message. When I got home around 7ish I saw the meal next to my door. It was for someone else, and a different meal. I called Munchery immediately, i waited and got voicemail. I tried a second time, and got a customer service representative. He was nice, but it sounded like the type of thing that happens all night. He offered a full refund, some credit, and said he could guarantee a new meal to me by two hours at the latest. i told him that was too late for me. I told him this was my first time trying them, and honestly, I didn't think this was the right company for me. I told him to cancel my membership and give me a refund. He did so obligingly, without any other recommendations on how to solve the problem. Again, I think this happens on a highly basis. The best part was the confirmation email of my membership being canceled, he said I can feel free to sign up again WITHOUT a free trial. Considering they messed up my first experience, they should give me the opportunity to try them again in the future WITH a free trial. I think they have some growing to do before they can be taken seriously as an option. Luckily there are similar services now.",3,,

It seems a lot to me to think about what I want to eat for lunch the minute my day starts if I want my food delivered by lunch time. With that amount of work, I would rather walk out and pick up my lunch. The other thing that bothered me was the amount of waste the delivery created. I had three plastic containers, a box, and a bag. It seems that they could cut this down a lot. I think if Munchery is going to offer such healthy, vegan, gluten free lunch options then they should also work on reducing environmental impact by limiting packaging waste. Unfortunately, I cannot justify creating that much waste for my lunch alone.
