0,Tracy D.,"Merrick, NY",268,414,2032,4.0,9/1/2018,"I've dined here a couple of times for brunch. The restaurant was nice enough to accommodate our large party in the dining area. The dining area has a rustic yet industrial feel with lots of wood and metal elements. The menu changes from time to time, so you can always find something new to try. They also have specials to tempt you as well. I decided to order the short rib Benedict with home fries. The short ribs were tender and succulent. The poached egg was cooked perfectly as the yolk breaks into a waterfall as you cut into it. I tried their cocktail special of Rose & Party. It was very refreshing on a hot day with a subtle floral rose flavor with the tequila. Service overall is pretty good here. Looking forward to coming back for another meal.",3,,
1,Grant E.,"New York, NY",22,146,94,3.0,10/21/2018,"3.5. Service was a little lackluster and the portion is a little on the small side. The fries however are an absolute masterpiece and saving grace. In all honesty, the fries are good enough to attract me back. Although, I would probably get the fries to go and get my actual meal somewhere else near by. Average in the end and I don't know if I would come back. I wouldn't avoid it, but I don't know if I would recommend.",,,

Updated review","I came back with some family, they chose this because it was right across the street from Mercury Lounge and we were seeing a show there afterwards. The food is just across the board bland. I decided to try the mac n cheese again, and my opinion is the same. It's one note, under-seasoned, and I just didn't care for their choice of noodle (like a crinkly rigatoni cut in a half). It just doesn't hold the cheese well. I'm more of a creamy mac fan anyway, and this is baked pretty hard even if it doesn't look it. The fish tacos were also bland, the batter tasted like fried air. I don't understand how something deep fried could be so flavorless. The slaw it came with, even the ""spicy"" chipotle mayo that came with it wasn't spicy and just seemed out of place. Their burger was the high point of the night, mainly because it was smothered in delicious caramelized onions. Caramelized onions are like bacon to me, they instantly elevate everything. Prices are high. The tequila cocktail my brother ordered didn't taste anything like its description, and my beer wasn't cold. I don't think I'm giving them another shot.",2,1,1
3,One C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,3,5.0,11/19/2018,"Really great food! Love the decor with all the industrial elements. I had the fish sandwich which is one of the most popular items on the menu. Large portions served at lunch is always amazing. With free wifi, it also makes here a great spot to catch up on work. Table is large enough to complete work on a laptop or tablet and still have plenty of room to still eat. The staff was friendly. I ordered my meal on the Allset restaurant app and it arrived within minutes to my table. I must say the location appeared very clean and not noisy like some brunch locations here in NY. I will definitely come back!",,,
4,Kovi K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",77,37,134,3.0,8/21/2018,"Boulton & Watt has a cool bar vibe, but I would not suggest it for brunch. The portions are simply too small. After their steak and eggs, I was starving. The service was great with refilling the water and in general. However, again, this is a bar. The food wasn't good; the chairs are uncomfortable stools; there's the occasional fly.The Bloody Mary tasted good, but it was basic, without any veggies sticking out.",,,
5,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",273,84,162,4.0,6/28/2018,"A great English pub! I came here on a Saturday noon, and there were many empty seats, so there was no need to make reservation. The atmosphere is casual and cool, so good for meeting with friends and dates. As for food, the deal for brunch drink is great! The sangria I got was strong and tasty, and it was less than ten bucks. The baked egg I got was very yummy and fulfilling, but my boyfriend says the English breakfast that he got was okay. It is definitely a hidden gem, and I would recommend a visit for an experience of authentic English pub in nyc",,,
6,Olivia B.,"Boston, MA",451,55,106,2.0,5/3/2018,"Very disappointing service. Our waiter forgot to put in our order. 45 minutes had passed, and people on either side of us, who came after us, had gotten our food. He came out to apologize and asked us for our order again. The pickled pineapple came 20 minutes later, and was not enjoyable. We hardly touched it. The waiter charged us full price for our sides when we subbed them in place of home fries. We got no discount on the service or lack of enjoyment of our food, and were even charged too much because of the sides. Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place, but the service was terrible and really threw a wrench in our whole experience. Food was just ok. We asked for the waiters recommendations, and honestly the food was nothing special. Brunch is not this place's strong suit apparently, we should have tried it for dinner instead. Food - 3 starsAmbiance - 3 stars (decor of 5 stars, but very rowdy, disruptive brunch crew)Service - 1 star",2,,
7,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,4.0,6/8/2018,"I came here a long time ago with a few girlfriends for dinner. It was loud, dark and crowded and nighttime on a Saturday night didn't allow me to get the best impression until I came back here a few years later for brunch.In my opinion, or as the kids say, IMO, this place is best suited for brunch since you can appreciate the rustic interior and actually see and hear the person who you're dining with. The best part is that their brunch is from 11:00am - 4:00pm and even though it isn't bottomless, you can get the usual brunch drinks and cocktails for $6 along with some pretty healthy or not-so-healthy-but-YOLO main courses. It's safe to say you're better off coming before peak brunch hour but even if you don't, it's never too long of a wait and you can always wait at or enjoy brunch at the bar itself. The layout is pretty spacious and with windows everywhere, there is a lot of natural light pouring in. It's a very rustic interior with a cool, East Village vibe. Tables are evenly spread out and you can sit along the windows in high or low tables or at the midsection of the venue. This is a good call out because although it gets crowded everyone gets their personal space and I think that's pretty important to be able to enjoy a good meal. The service was on point and each server I've had was always very attentive and checked on us at appropriate times. That aside, let's get down to business: what do they have to eat here? My favorite dish is their crunchy quinoa salad with chicken. It's a super healthy option that doesn't taste too healthy. If that doesn't speak to you, you can also order a cheese steak special with a heaping amount of fries or the short rib and bone marrow toast (with eggs benedict on top). Of course, there are burgers as well and the portions are fairly large and it's over all very satisfying! Overall, this place has a very cool atmosphere and is one of the better brunch options along the east side of Houston Street.",,,
8,Michelle O.,"Las Vegas, NV",107,172,335,4.0,5/21/2018,"Stumbled upon this place after walking all over the city.  We were seated right away which was surprising because the place was packed!! This seems like a spot where locals go to to grab drinks and appetizers after work. The waiter took our order pretty quickly and our food also arrived quick. I was impressed especially considering how busy they were. We ordered the pickled green beans as an appetizer. I thought they were good. I had a mushroom pasta that was so dang good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My boyfriend ordered a burger. He said it was pretty tasty. The place dimly lit and and very very loud. I knocked off a star for the excessive noise. It was impossible to talk in there so we resorted to texting each other. It was worth it though.... seriously that pasta was amazing. If I lived nearby, I'd keep coming back so I could try everything on the menu. Too bad I live thousands of miles away. PS: Order the WILD MUSHROOM RICOTTA GNOCCHI",,,
9,Rachel G.,"New York, NY",405,84,36,3.0,8/3/2018,"I've been to Boulton & Watt a handful of times because it is near my friends apartment and I would say its an average bar. In my opinon, the prices for dinner are way too expensive. The food tastes great, but I think too expensive for the quality. As for nightlife, Its a dim lit place, and loud music. The vibe is usually overall good but personally I find it hard to see/hear people sometimes.",,,
10,Sweenly L.,"Brooklyn, NY",477,122,81,5.0,2/6/2018,"If I could come every day to have their brunch menu's French toast, and not break the scale, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD! This is my FAVORITE French toast in the metro NYC by far. It is cinnamon brioche toast, topped with strawberry/blueberry sauce and fruits, and dusted with a bit of powdered sugar. It also comes with maple syrup but I don't think it's necessary. The bread is the highlight of this dish. (I am a self-proclaimed carb queen!!!) The French toast is ACTUALLY STILL TOASTY and crunchy on the sides! /swoon. There is a perfect amount of sauce, making the innards of the French toast sweet, soft, and decadent. It's sweet but not dense or heavy since it's a thin berry sauce. All of the above, coupled with some fruits and the faint cinnamon flavor, is a great mix of texture and taste. Sheer perfection! Highly highly recommend.If you love bread, even their regular plain toast is bomb. Throw a little of that blackberry jam they give you on it (skip the butter because it's already buttered - thank you Boulton&Watt) and bam!! My boyfriend got the burger and added bacon. I took a bite here and there and nabbed a little bacon. The bacon is diced thick bacon, smoky and meaty, as opposed to usual thin crispy ones. Bacon is bacon is bacon and I enjoy them both! It is a nice change though from the usual. The beef tasted fresh in my opinion and I know he loved it since we ordered the same thing both times that we came.I definitely will come back soon for the French toast again! Décor: very rustic and earthy!Service: good; food takes a little while to come out but totally worth it; not much interaction with our waitress the first time but great service when we were at the bar the second time!Bathrooms, need a little work, dingy and makes me nervous to use it...",1,,

Updated review","Finally returned for dinner and had an awesome meal! Started with the dragon class cocktail, which was delicious. For food, I tried:+ short rib and bone marrow toast+ fried green tomato caprese+ mac and cheese+ brick amish chicken+ mahi mahi fish tacos+ crispy quinoa and kale salad + doughnuts Bone marrow was great but the flavor definitely leaned more short rib. I'd never had fried green tomatoes before and I loved them. Mac was solid and all of the entrees were great, though the chicken was probably my favorite. Doughnuts were perfection!",1,,
12,Corinna B.,"Manhattan, NY",65,176,585,4.0,2/12/2018,"Booked a table for 10 for a birthday brunch, were seated when half the party was present, and after everyone had ordered, we actually did receive all our food around the same time. Big thumbs up for that! Nothing worse than getting your food when almost everyone's already finished theirs. I was surprised that it wasn't too busy yet on a Saturday morning at 11am, but still the waitresses seemed kind of annoyed already, and that (plus the broken bathroom lock) is the only reason I am deducting a star. All you want for a birthday brunch is to have a good time in a welcoming atmosphere.I had the oatmeal raspberry pancakes with what funnily looked like mayonnaise but was delicious robiola cheese, and they were fantastic! Everyone went crazy about the eggs benedict, but I believe next time I'll go for the gigantic French toast which I saw at several other tables.",,,1
13,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,2/11/2018,"TLDR: dimly lit bar / restaurant offering classic American fare; good beer selection; large portionsCame here on a Saturday night with a friend around 8:30pm. While the wait time for a table was 45 minutes, we were luckily seated right away at the bar. Unlike some bars in the LES / EV, Boulton & Watt was pretty spacious, will plenty of walking space between the bar and dining area. The interior of the restaurant was very dimly lit with dark wooden tables, stools, and chairs.Many of the appetizers on the menu sounded great, but we ultimately opted for the fried green tomato caprese to start and both got the house burger as our main entree. For drinks, I ordered a beer on the specials menu that had hints of honey and floral notes while my friend opted for the rose cider. The honey and floral notes in the beer were very subtle and I found the beer to just be okay (disclaimer: I typically only drink IPAs). My friend liked the rose cider, which was fruity but not overly sweet.The fried green tomato caprese was well-portioned and served with cheese and balsamic vinegar. The balance of flavors in the dish (savory, sweet, acidic) was nice and the tomatoes were fried well with a crunchy as opposed to soggy shell. The burgers were also quite large and came with enough fries to fill half of the large plates on which they were served. Although they were quite messy to eat (especially since I added sauteed mushrooms and onions to mine), they were pretty good. Although we were sitting at the bar, it was difficult to get the bartenders' attention at times to refill our waters / ask for the check, as they were ""in the zone"" preparing drinks. However, they were courteous and it didn't feel like they were ignoring us, just simply busy. While I enjoyed my meal here, I'd probably only come back for drinks and appetizers, as the main entrees offered were pretty standard compared to the more unique ""bar food"" options.",,,1

Attentive staff (she literally managed 5-6 tabs out of a group of ~20ppl), reasonably priced drinks, the food looked good, and the music was downtempo and so chill.  Lots of rnb and some alternative music (think lykke Li or little dragon), which was perfect for 10-11pm.

The sausage that came with my eggs Benedict was hard, as if it had been left out for a long time. The seasonal sangria was just okay. The interior of the restaurant was very pretty, but that was the only positive in my brunch experience here. There are many other brunch places in the city that would be a better choice.

16,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10944,2.0,4/6/2018,"I came here for a belated birthday dinner a really long time ago and neglected to write a review. But the photos of the experience were still there and the memory never really left. Going in I honestly didn't do or want to do anything for my birthday and one of my friend's and her husband surprised me with taking me out to dinner. It turned into an awkward experience because we had a reservation for 3 and there wasn't much room for us to sit anywhere as a college frat party was going on with college football games and 20-somethings pounding back their mimosas and cheap beer. I like to brunch just as much as any jerk in Manhattan does don't get me wrong. But you couldn't hear yourself think or breathe inside the place. It was worse than being at a metal concert. And this was at like early bird dinner around 5pm, mind you. So we sat outside in the cold and received not the best service as no one wanted to really check on us. The cocktails and food were pretty good. Over-priced in my opinion. We went with the staff's suggestions and recommendations. Loved the mac and cheese bites which I don't even see on their online menu any longer. Their regular mac and cheese is also a solid option. Fried green tomato caprese was pretty bad. The mozz part was delicious and the balsamic drizzled on top but the tomatoes weren't really green at all and weren't firm. For my entree I went with a special for the month of pappardelle and shrimp with wild mushrooms in a tomato cream sauce. The pasta was a little soggy and the sauce bland. My friend went with the burger and it was over-cooked and not really the best burger. Her husband went with the brick chicken and it was dry but edible. As we were finishing there were discrepancies with the bill between us and the staff, which we figured out and settled on and left an enormous tip because everyone that was working that night was incredibly rude and it wasn't worth arguing over. Probably won't ever come back because it was an awkward and crap experience and I'm really not into dining with this kind of crowd.",5,4,5
17,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,4.0,11/5/2017,"Fairly easy to make a reservation here on Opentable. Came for Sunday brunch with a couple of friends the weekend of Halloween. Perfect hangover food. I ordered an iced coffee (they don't have anything but regular milk). For my entree, I ordered the mac and cheese with bacon, which was super creamy and delicious. Next time, I'd probably opt for without the bacon because it was the thick cut almost like ham chunks, whereas I prefer more crispy bacon. I ordered an over easy egg on the side, which actually comes with 2 eggs, and I put it over my mac and cheese. Insanely good and worth a try if you like runny egg over your pastas!My friends got the short rib benedict and the burger with avocado. The fries are crispy and tasty. They also ordered bloody marys and mimosas, which are only $6 each here. The waitress was friendly, and food came out quickly. The prices are pretty awesome, especially for Manhattan and in LES!

We ordered fish and chips, house made burrata, and brats in a blanket. The fish and chips with the brats are so heavy that you need the burrata to balance it out. Of course, wash it down with wine or beer. Delish. Friday night wasn't busy at all. We made a reservation for 8 and there were a lot of tables open. Service was good. Def would come back.",,,

The bartender brought me water but then forgot to get my cocktail. Sad face :(  he made up for it though and brought me a drink ""on him.""  It was a dirty martini. Perfectly made. You know I love my martinis.Food wise, I have to say the menu looked wonderful. Lots of good choices like burgers, steaks etc.  I wanted something different, yet on the healthy side. I asked for advice on the special cod dish which he said was a beautiful dish. I went for it and could not have been happier.  That fish was delicious. Covered in herbs and sauteed to perfection. Served over this lentil tomato hash that was to die for. I probably could have licked the plate.All in all I was very satisfied coming here. It was not too crowded on a Monday night, about half full. The service was great, attentive and not in your face. The ambiance is nice--a bit on the dark side but very homey and welcoming. Definitely try out B&W if you are on the LES.",2,1,2

Ordered the quinoa salad with shrimp and the eggplant Benedict's  tasty and decent quantity too. The bar has good beer and spirits this time around we rolled with cerveza ! Good selection. The food rolled out quickly which was nice made up for the wait time. Overall good spot gets crowded average age 25ish on brunch days. I like the senior citizen hours in this place.

24,Kathleen N.,"Long Island, NY",7,31,14,4.0,2/19/2018,"Came for brunch with friends on a Sunday. Definitely suggest making a reservation. This place is great for groups, or smaller parties. Sat us 7 at a long table that can comfortably fit & or 9, but anything past that would be pretty cramped. I saw other tables around the same size as ours with more people, it looked rather uncomfortable. Saw they had $6 brunch drinks (bloodys, mimosas), and started with their Bloody Mary. It was decent, pretty strong. Topped with pepper, and a sting bean & Brussels sprout. With brunch, got their mimosa, less the gin, and it was delicious. Can't go wrong. The menu was definitely different, a lot of things that aren't standard ""brunch"", but that's not a bad thing! I got the Boulton and Watt mac n cheese with bacon. It. Was. Perfection. Absolutely hit the spot. The cheese was melty and gooey, the bacon was in decent chunks (and a lot of it!) and tasted like it was smoked, which added a great flavor. Boyfriend got the steak and eggs, the steak was cooked perfectly and in a delicious sauce. Won't go into detail about what everyone got, but we all left happy and full. The waitress was pleasant and kind. With how busy/loud it was she didn't seem overwhelmed. None of the staff did and that's always good to see. If you're in this part of town, try it. It's different.

The jalapeno was super spicy. All were wonderfully pickled. I then went carb crazy and ordered their mac and cheese which was an appetizer but definitely big enough for one person to eat. It was delicious. The pasta was al dente and sauce and texture was super cheesy. Loved every bite. I also got it with a side of fries. I needed a vegetable of course!

For the pickle jar, I chose the pineapple with habnero, mint and basil. The habenero kick compliments the pineapple's sourness amazingly. And they come in a little mason jar! Truth be told, among the many lunch specials in the LES, I was attracted to Boulton & Watt because of the pickle jar. I clearly have an odd love for pickled vegetables. Aside from pineapples, there were also kirby cucumbers, beets, brussel sprouts and much more! For the beer, I chose the Ommegang White, which was the perfect ice cold beer for the perfect afternoon! Boulton & Watt boasts an extremely chill environment with its modern and rustic touches.

Pick your seating if you have a preference; the layout design then continues, with a sizable bar, a super-sized high communal table smack in the middle, counter-height tables and stools or regular seating, also. Right amount of warm lighting throughout, gives Boulton, a cozy and funked out feel. Menu seemed like a decent find and met us in between The Man's meat ways and my Seafood lifestyle on a Thursday night. Although good and crispy, I got no hint of Lobster in the Mac and Cheese-'Lobster' fritters and my 'Violet Light' cocktail, was doable but overwhelmed with ice. Our server Camilo, seemed to be on the shy side but was on top of all my questions- efficiently. My Tuna Niçoise Salad wasn't huge- yet decent, considering all the veggies and purple potatoes in it. The dressing? Fearful of it having mustard, was in fact, mustard-free and delicious. According to my husband, his Beef Short Rib, resting on Garlic Polenta and on a mound of Spinach, was ok (I'll admit, the Polenta looked delicious and if it wasn't for the beef and all that jus around it, I would've eaten it all). Not an extensive Dessert Menu, but enough to satisfy that craving. The delicious Brownie Batter was exactly that and again, Camilo came to the rescue and placed the Vanilla scoop that I didn't care for, on the side for me. I really liked Boulton- everyone was helpful with a smile and meal preparations were timely, and despite my love for hard rock music, it was just too loud and could've been lowered a smidgeon. But all in all, decent food and upbeat energy.",6,3,6
35,Priya S.,"New York, NY",214,151,94,3.0,12/22/2017,"A quaint little spot in the heart of the Lower East Side! In the evening there is loud music playing and a large bar with people speaking loudly so not the best spot for an intimate date. However, it is perfect for large group gatherings and birthdays. Food wise, the quality is slightly above average. Drinks, however, are subpar. The cocktail menu is not very extensive although they are generally known for their unique cocktails. The cocktails also weren't very strong- couldn't taste any alcohol (actually not even sure if there was any in them). Service was very good- the server was polite, attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful. The food and drinks came out quickly as well. Overall, not a bad spot especially if in a large group. However, I'd recommend getting regular drinks on the rocks and skipping the cocktails.",,,
36,Amber K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",50,79,138,2.0,6/23/2017,"Honestly not impressed. I'm not sure if I missed something based on their amazing reviews, but I was disappointed to say the least.I came here with a small group after having seen the positive reviews. We ordered some appetizers (fried calamari and guacamole). They were pretty basic, but for almost $12 each I expected more food. The calamari plate ended up being like half friend peppers as well, so I felt like we kinda got jipped with the starters. I wanted to try the mac and cheese appetizer as well, but had seen pics online of how small it was for the price and wasn't gonna go there...Now let's move on to the main dish. My 3 friends got the Mahi Mahi Fish tacos, which were pretty good, had tasty toppings, and came with 3 tacos for $18, alright we are in NYC I get it. While the toppings on the taco were good, I feel like they drowned out the taste of the fish so you couldn't appreciate it as much as I would have liked to. I ordered the Artichoke and Goat Cheese Ravioli expecting a unique dish. I did not like the flavor combo at all and the fact that it came with 5 small raviolis on a plate for $22 was pretty lame. My other friend got the Wild Mushroom Bolognaise, which came with more food for $19, but again was just okay and didn't have a ton of flavor.Our waitress was nice and the place was cool inside, but I didn't think it was worth it at all. Overall, I think Boulton & Watt is extremely overpriced for mediocre food that will leave you hungry at the end of the night.",,,

39,Kirsten S.,"Staten Island, NY",524,493,3228,2.0,3/16/2018,"This is tough I have no excuse for the negatives because I have been a team player and come back time after time for weekend brunch with friends that are big fans. The big huge awful thing here that makes it miserable to eat here is the noise. It's louder then bars, concerts etc. it's unbearable and so isolating. You spend the entire time trying to read lips but usually when here I just give up any chance of knowing what people are saying. When dining outside we were pretty neglected and forgotten about. So it's a lose lose indoor or out. The one thing that I think they must do great here are the seasoned pickled fruits and veggies. I love pickles but one of the jerks I use to dine with never let the table order pickle jars since he says pickles make him sick (I've seen this person eat cow brain paste) so obviously he's just an a$$. I did get to try the pineapple jar, to much for one person but quite unique. Wish I could have tried more. I've had the TRADITIONAL FULL ENGLISH2 EGGS ANY STYLE, HOUSE-MADE PORK SAUSAGE, BACON, STEWED BEANS,WILD MUSHROOMS, ROSTI POTATOES $16 which is the biggest dish on the menu. I could do without the beans. The omelets are meh a bit dried outThe cast iron cookie as cool an idea as it is nothing special. Never ordered or would consider getting it again. Table and chairs are so uncomfortable and you are packed in like veal. Shame , this had some unique drinks and pickles but it's just the mist uncomfortable setting.",8,,4
40,Cara L.,"Seattle, WA",5000,1028,3752,5.0,2/21/2018,"It's RARE when the actual meat patty of a burger blows me away, not just the toppings or the combination of the meat, bread, and accouterments. But, dayum. Boulton & Watt know how to make a great beef patty! My BF and I stopped here for dinner and drinks to meet my best friend while we were in town. She suggested this spot and one other, but after seeing the pictures on Yelp, I picked B&W. First of all, the photos of their fries were enough to convince me. But then a variety of homemade pickles you can order in jars?! UMMM HECK YES. Before I get too far down the food path, let me take a well-deserved moment to shout out their cocktails. THE MEXICAN REVOLVER IS EVERYTHING. I'm serious. Milagro tequila, ancho reyes, poblano chile, fresh lime, agave, prosecco--combine these and you have a cocktail that will knock your damn socks off. There was a taste of pepper, but no actual spice on your tongue. The sweetness of the cocktail was subtle enough to let all the ingredients shine through. And the prosecco added a perfect effervescence. I think I had four of these--but don't judge! We were there for a really long time, mmkay?!Now, the food--my favorite part! Their trio of pickle jars is the way to go. I ordered the green beans, cucumber, and cherry peppers. Each one was delicious, tangy, and spicy in it's own way. It was the perfect snack with drinks. The burgers were AHMAZING. If you read enough of my reviews, you know that I'm an American cheese on burgers fan. Again, don't judge me. I love fancy cheese, but American cheese has it's place--like on my dang burgers. Well, even without American cheese or any crazy toppings, this beef patty was juicy, tender, flavorful, perfectly seasoned and prepared. The bun was buttered and stood up to the juices of the burger patty like a champ. And the combination of cheese, beef, and bun was like a world-renowned orchestra in my mouth. And those fries?! SHUT. UP. They were shoestring perfection. I'm not sure what fat they use to fry them, but they're perfectly seasoned with salt and rosemary. And every single fry was crispy. I doubt this out-of-towner will get to come back, but I'm SO glad I got to come try Boulton & Watt while I was in NYC!",8,6,9

I would ding this review a star if the food and drinks didn't completely make up for it.Follow B&W on Instagram and you will see what I'm talking about.Mimosas, Bloodies & Sangrias are $6/each - so that's already a great start.

48,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,12/20/2017,"We were looking for a casual dinner after some drinks in the East Village, and I instantly thought of Boulton & Watt.  I had been there for brunch about two years ago and had loved the Baked Eggs and Mac N' Cheese with Mushrooms.  (The Bloody Mary and Sangria were not bad either!)  My companion mentioned that he thought the place was purely just a bar, but I let him know that they actually served terrific food that I was eager to try again.  We arrived at the roomy restaurant and were seated at one of the small wooden tables.  The space was very industrial with wooden and metal accents, dim lighting, and full-length, paneled windows on its two corner block walls.  While my friend went with a craft beer, I ordered the Dragon Glass cocktail, which started with Reyka Vodka and then added Amaro Montenegegro, hibiscus, lemon, and blackberries.  The frothy, bright pink concoction was served in a frozen glass packed with small balls of ice.  The cocktail was tart and fruity, yet still deliciously boozy.  A mint leaf was the perfect garnish to add another level of complexity.  In addition to our drinks, we decided to preclude our meal by sharing the seasonal Pumpkin Hummus.  The creamy, orange dip was topped with crumbled feta, dried cranberries, and toasted pumpkin seeds.  It was served with a large basket of what I believe was homemade, grilled flat bread, sprinkled with cinnamon.  The large slices of pita chips were an ideal vehicle for scooping up heaps of hummus.  In regards to the addition of the cinnamon, though I typically love the spice, I was not sure it was even necessary when the dip was sweet enough already.  I ordered the Vegetarian ""Spaghetti and Meatballs"" as my entrée and was very pleasantly surprised by just how satisfying it really was.  The spaghetti squash had been mixed with a tomato confit and a parmesan broth, turning it into more a risotto.  The accompanying balls were small bites of fried eggplant whose inside just oozed into my mouth.  My dining partner ordered the Crispy Quinoa and Kale Salad with golden beets, roasted butternut squash, avocado, cucumber, watermelon radish, and toasted pumpkin seeds, all tossed in a lemon garlic vinaigrette.  Though I only sampled the juicy grilled chicken that he had added to it, I know that he was impressed with the salad.  Boulton & Watt was a great restaurant that delivered expertly crafted cocktails and delicious food for both brunch and dinner.  Its casual atmosphere and affordable prices were other pluses that made this an ideal spot for any occasion.",2,,5

We booked a table in advance since we had a large group but there was enough space that you didn't have to wait at all. Though on sunnier days, I've heard it can get pretty packed. Everyone at my table seemed to get some form of grits. I went with the tickler grits that came with a poached egg, cheese and chorizo! It was delicious and tasted even more amazing when mixed all together so you can get every savory piece in each bite. To finish, we shared a cookie dessert in a cast iron skillet as a gift for my friend. It came with a small jug of milk and we got mason jars to share. It was a cute concept - you add the milk to the jars first and then let the cookie piece soak up the milk after.Good space that's not too loud. Overall, a really good experience!",,1,

54,May C.,"New York, NY",0,36,31,2.0,4/12/2018,"Sadly, this place was not what I was hoping it would turn out to be. I came here to try out their brunch menu, but was told that they only served brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. So I had to opt for the lunch menu section.         I ordered the eggs any style that came with avocado toast and watercress salad on the side. My eggs were a tad bit too oily, half my plate was covered in oil because of it. I thought the avocado toast was okay, my toast tasted mostly burnt, I don't know why. For appetizer, we ordered the regular mac&cheese. This was my favorite dish out of everything we ordered. It was hot & cheesy when it came out and I think it would've been better if they made it a little bit more burnt on top. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered steak&frites. It was not good at all according to him. The steak itself had too much sauce on it he couldn't taste the flavoring of the meat itself. The fries tasted funny, I couldn't tell what they used on top to season the fries.          After we were done, we asked for the check and paid. One of the servers came up to us and asked us if we were done with our plates. The face that he made looked like he was angry or something (maybe he was having a bad day?). When we left, both my boyfriend and I said bye and thank you to the server, and all we got back was a ""bye"" back. Don't people usually say ""have a nice/great day"" when the customers leave your restaurant? He sounded like he wanted us to leave. Overall, this was my first time here and I will never come back again after today. Bad customer service and food that didn't fit my taste at all.",,,

The mac and cheese came out while my girlfriend was in the bathroom, so between us, it was delicious and cheesy and warm and tasty....but officially, ""I can't believe they forgot it!""Next up was the dinner.

The girlfriend got the shrimp pappardelle, which comes with a tree worth of asparagus (asparagus grows on trees right?) The pasta was really great, the shrimp was tasty, and the asparagus was a surprising addition because I was not expecting so much to be there but I wasn't upset. We also got a beer because why not.

Its perfectly cooked & that egg & bacon makes it more flavorful. DESSERTS:Bite size caramel ice cream-- this one is really good. Its a little bit salty & sweet. Must try! Cookie with milk on the side-- big portion of cookie & can share with 3 to 4 people. Its soft cookie. The vibe is great! Its just a chill spot were u can enjoy your food & drinks. Shoutout to all the host & server thats really accomodating & friendly! I'm coming back for brunch. Yasss!",16,9,10
72,Nikita K.,"New York, NY",30,224,34,3.0,4/2/2017,"This place made for a delightful brunch. I'd give it 5 stars for atmosphere and service, unfortunately the food isn't quite that amazing. Staff are friendly and service is efficient, frequently filling bottles of water etc. They had the windows open, making for a nice sunny environment. We visited for brunch today, they have a large menu with a few specials. I tried the following:- baked eggs with farrow, kale, and ricotta- pancakes - toastBy far the highlight was the jam that accompanied the toast (ironically). Baked eggs were slightly over cooked and the ricotta was drizzled on top, not baked inside, which seemed odd. Pancakes were nice and fluffy, large portion for one person. Overall, standard brunch fare. Menu appears more appetizing on paper than actual taste. They also only have whole milk... if you prefer soy/almond etc you are out of luck.",,,
73,Irene W.,"New York, NY",157,63,54,2.0,7/16/2016,"This is my 3rd time here and I came here again because my first two experiences were great. However, this time it was kind of disappointing.First of all, the service was oddly...bad. I wouldn't say that it was extremely busy on this Friday evening since the restaurant wasn't fully packed yet at 7pm. Our server wasn't very welcoming and spoke so quietly that we had to make her repeat herself every single time she talked. And then she never came by the table again until the end when she gave us our check. Never asked how the food was or how we were doing. I had to flag down someone every time we needed more water. I still tipped but service definitely could have been better. Second, the food was just not good. Please do not order the Fish & chips. The fish had no flavor, weird texture and the breading was soggy....I only ate a few bites of it. I've had their fish tacos and mussels the last time I was here and they were better, not amazing. I think I would come again only for drinks and apps probably...not recommended for a sit down dinner experience.",,1,
74,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",774,173,56,3.0,4/1/2017,"For what it promised -- a typical bar with typical bar food, Boulton & Watt delivered fine. I went with a group of ~8 for my roommate's birthday celebration, and we were seated very quickly despite being extremely late for our reservation, so +1 on service there! I had the pan-seared Mahi Mahi fish tacos, which were solid. I didn't find them to be particularly flavorful, and they took a while to be brought out but all in all were a good meal. Most of my friends got the burger, and they seemed to enjoy it. While I can't comment on the burger quality at all, the fries were certainly really good! Their beer is brought out in these super large bottles which was pretty fun too.The music was extremely loud throughout the entire meal which actually made it very difficult to talk to my friends / hear what they were saying. I found myself generally shouting, which was somewhat unpleasant. It was also extremely crowded, with people standing up around their tables, etc. which made it feel less like a restaurant and more like a bar.",,,
75,Ashish D.,"Manhattan, NY",56,195,254,4.0,4/10/2017,"This is the perfect place to have brunch with a big group of friends, they accommodate large groups with the least amount of fuss, non of the pre fixe nonsense. We were a party of 14 and it was the easiest brunch experience I have had in Manhattan. They were able to seat us even though the entire party wasn't around and also come around to take orders multiple times as people kept coming in. They deserve major props for that. Food - We started off with the very inventive pickle jars, but apart from the pineapple with habanero, which is a must have, I wasn't too impressed with the others. Unless you are a big pickle fan, I wouldn't get too many of these. We pretty much got everything on the menu, since we were a huge party. My favorites on the table were BAKED EGGS, healthy and tasty, crispy kale, tomatoes and faro on top, I had my doubts about this because of the kale but it was fantastic. The PANCAKES, were another standout dish, made with oatmeal and served with some really nice maple syrup, it was a winner. The BAKED GRITS with mushrooms and ham was perfectly cooked and tasted heavenly, the poached egg was the perfect accompaniment. BOLTON MAC and CHEESE was fantastic as well, very adult, indulgent and you can get it with mushrooms or bacon.Apart from these we also had the regular burger, which was ok, the veggie burger was too big for my liking but my friends seemed to enjoy it. All the eggs Benedict-s were ordered and devoured, they were all OK.I love the fact that this place has enough options to satisfy the vegetarians as well as the non vegetarians.Their inventive menu along with the usual suspects like omelettes and yoghurt gets a thumbs up from me. Most of the mains on the menu are not more than 15$, which is very well priced.We also tried their very famous Cast iron cookie with milk, I didn't think it was anything to write home about, but it was a great idea for the whole table to share Drinks - They have 2 brunch cocktails for 6$, though not very big or boozy, but I would say very reasonably priced. I would recommend  their version of the bloody mary. They also have freshly squeezed organge juice which was very tasty. We didn't try too many of their regular cocktails, just something called the mexican revolver, which was OK.The ambience is that of a typical Gastropub or bar in the east village area, very open with lots of exposed brick, wood and metal. I especially liked their pulley ceiling fans. The service was great, very friendly and non intrusive. I am not sure how this place feels in the evening, but for a weekend brunch with friends, its perfect, very warm (literally with the huge windows) and welcoming, would love to go back.",,,

77,Tori M.,"Washington, DC",2,2,2,1.0,7/1/2017,"I never write Yelp reviews but my friends and I experienced such bad service last night that I needed to complain. This is only in regards to the service - not the food, as we just came for drinks. We were a group of 6 just coming in for drinks and sat at a regular table. Not only did we have to wait forever for our orders to be taken (and it was not busy at all), but when we did order drinks they took forever to come. My friend even went up to the bar to try to order there and the bartender completely ignored her. Again, it was not a busy night.The most inexcusable part was when the waiter finally came with our drinks, he dropped the tray and spilled all of the drinks on me. He immediately ran away out of embarrassment and I never received one apology - let alone a free drink or something for my troubles. I was completely drenched in alcohol.I am not one to complain normally - and I have eaten food here before and enjoyed it - but the service was extremely unprofessional.",3,2,
78,Jennifer G.,"Pawtucket, RI",26,385,745,4.0,2/28/2017,"We almost skipped going in as so many places look just like this. What a mistake that would have been. The food was on point from the perfectly cooked eggs, to the sauces and house-made sausage and bacon. I ordered the short rib and bone marrow benedict, my best friend ordered the cheddar grits with poached egg and chorizo. Both were so good! Service was just ok, as we were ignored trying to get drink refills, but we would definitely go back. You can also make a reservation on Open Table.",,,

I hadn't heard of it before but now will be sure to come back as well as quick to recommend. It's a great mix of bar/restaurant so would imagine coming here for a nice sit down dinner or hanging at one of the tables over drinks and a few apps. We ended up getting the following: to share:- 3 pickle jars (Brussel sprouts, cucumber, green beans)- Mac and Cheese- Blackened chicken - Fish tacos Can't complain about any of them but my favorites were the Mac and cheese and chicken. I don't even typically like either out at a restaurant but the Mac and cheese was really great- and specifically enjoyed the rigatoni noodles. As for the blackened chicken, it was perfectly spiced, huge portion and the potatoes put it over the top. Only complaint on the night is it gets super loud. But again, I went on a Saturday night so to be expected. Made for a fun atmosphere but was tough hearing people talk.",1,1,1

I wish they had the fried green tomatoes available on the menu but that may be a seasonal thing. However they did have the various forms of stone ground grits and cheese options. And my friend had something that looked like the dream state of texas toast. Either way, it was all good and yummy. I recommend everything but the skillet cookie with milk, which registered as a bit bland to me and with slightly too much baking powder.",,,

The corner restaurant with all open windows, cool interior decor, outdoor seating and awesome waitstaff complement the amazing food. The rosé sangria was awesome and perfect for summer. The Mac and cheese with bacon was perfection and the stone ground cheese grits rival anything in the south (and I live in the south and eat grits weekly and it is my favorite starchy side). I could have spent hours hear just having sangria or mimosas and obviously they agree with board games people can play!  I bought a shirt I liked I that match (mind you they don't just sell them, but did sell me one ) one of my favorites",,,1

It's the only sports bar near my apartment known for viewing games, so my friend and I came excited to watch the World Cup. However, when we were seated at the bar, we were instantly met with sarcasm and hostility from the bartender. He was incredibly rude and judgmental from the start, acting as if he didn't understand what we were doing there. Multiple times throughout our meal he made unnecessary comments and rolled his eyes throughout serving us. Incredibly disappointed and disgusted with his attitude and the service here because Boulton & Watt has other amazing servers. The bartender is definitely not one of them and lacks any sense of professionalism. Do yourself a favor and sit at another table or take your business elsewhere.",1,,

I ordered the veggie burger with cheddar grits. The veggie burger tasted better without the bun. The bun was too big and just added unnecessary carbs to my breakfast. The patty was more on the dry side so I was hesitant to let my date try my burger because I didn't want his first experience with a veggie burger to suck. He tried it and wasn't so fond of it. He had the steak and eggs and enjoyed his meal a great deal. How were these grits? Better than my first experience with cheesy grits in NYC but still not comparable to southern cheesy grits.

Both dishes were delicious. For drinks, I tried a citrus beer and my friend had a mimosa. Unfortunately, our table was wobbly and our drinks spelt quite often.

They also have an amazing Benedicts menu that all sound really good! We got the Mac and cheese, the baked eggs and the steak and eggs and everyone loved their dish. All the portions are a really good size.The cups of coffee are huge which is great.

Guac, burrata, the infamous Mac and cheese and sausage rolls. Food came out quick and was really tasty. My two faves were the Mac n cheese and burrata. Burrata was served over crisp bread with a tomato arugula spread, yum! Mac n cheese, oh so creamy. For entrees we got the chicken with bacon brussel sprout mashed potatoes (ya they were awesome!), fish tacos, and the pasta special which was broccoli rabe pesto and crumbled Italian sausage. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken entree (really juicey and flavorful) but the pasta special really stole the show! So. Much. Flavor.

The place was way too loud on a Saturday night. I saw a party change tables to be away from the noise and another leaving (probably because of the noise).Service was kind of weird. We finished our entrees but still had a ton of side broccoli and mac n cheese left. Instead of asking if we wanted to box it up, the busboy just assumed we didn't want them. He took our plates, then took the sides and stacked them on top of each other. Didn't give us a chance to say anything.. what a waste of food!The lobster ravioli on their specials menu is nothing to brag about. I wish it was creamier. Each bite was kinda just ravioli itself and it tasted ""dry,"" if that makes any sense...The crispy quinoa salad with steak is probably the best dish at the table!! It has a nice crunch and flavor and the steak makes you forget you're eating a salad.Broccoli as a side is a bit bitter.

Also had mimosas with our meal which were well balanced and tasty. My girlfriend couldn't decide on what to get between an eggs Benedict and pancakes so the general manager brought her pancakes FOR FREE after she placed an order for the Benedict.

It was really good except I did not enjoy the reddish sauce. It tasted a bit curry like- a tad spicy. My bday had the French toast. The flavor was delightful but the texture was not for either of us.

We sat at the tall tables near the large open windows and enjoyed the late September evening breeze. The restaurant featured exposed brick walls and has an industrial feel.Several items on the menu (and Yelp) looked good, including the kale/artichoke dip, curried mussels pot, Mexican corn, grilled swordfish, and chocolate chip cookie (baked in a skillet).We started the meal with a selection from the pickle jar: spicy pineapple chunks, floral fennel flavored delicately with grapefruit, and briny cucumbers. Each offered a very different take on pickles and we both agreed that the pineapple one was incredible - the best of the three.For the entrée, I enjoyed the duck confit and squash ravioli special, served on a bed of sweet, mashed squash. Each mouthful of the plump and well-made ravioli was bursting with nuanced and complementary flavors. Delicious. Also good were the Brussels sprouts with caramelized onion strings and bacon bites.

I've been enjoying the food and booze so much that I made it a point to come back for a post-show outing with my fellow cast members.The cocktails are really well made. That Mexican Revolver is spicy, refreshing, and goes down deceptively smooth. The Endless Summer and Franklin My Dear are both solid choices as well. I'm also a fan of their beer and wine selections.The Pickle Jars...sooo good! My absolute favorite is hands down the pineapple with habanero, mint and basil. It pains me to share it. I also loved:- jicama with grapefruit, ginger, chili and lime- brussels sprouts with mustard seeds, roasted garlic and dill- beets with peppercorns and red wine vinegarThe Cape Cod Mussel Pot is enormous..definitely enough to share with someone and the sauce is delish! The Mac and Cheese and the Tempura Mahi Mahi Tacos are also tasty options but I have to mention how satisfying the Escarole and Chicken Salad is.It gets sooo crazy packed on Friday and Saturday nights, but our server handled us like a pro.

The Bloody Mary's had just the right balance of tomato and spiciness; however, for a restaurant that prides itself on its pickled delights, they could've been more generous with the accompanying garnishes. The red sangria was perfect with fresh strawberry and raspberry. $5 drink specials FTW!Several of us had the Short Rib Benedict with bone marrow. We were looking for the bones but found the marrow was already in the mix. There was enough marrow to enrich the Benedict with deep earthy flavor. It was so good (see my photo)!Our waiter and waitress were friendly and always coming by. We were never long without a drink refill. The bus staff were helpful too.

The Industrial-esque theme of this place is indeed admirable. The brunch menu is simple and very easy to navigate. My eyes caught one of the three Benedict choices, the Braised Short Ribs and Bone Marrow on Country Bread served with Home Fries and Coleslaw. It was very flavorful and filling for its price. The $5 Brunch cocktail special of Mimosa, Bloody Mary and Sangria was an instant hit for our group.It was truly an inspiring experience, we will definitely comeback to try the dinner menu.",5,4,7

112,Sara B.,"Jersey City, NJ",3529,651,4948,4.0,5/4/2015,"My roomies and I ventured to Boulton & Watt for my East Village farewell dinner, you know, incase I decide to never return to one of my most favored places....not. I thought about sticking with a classic favorite but figured that it would be a good opportunity to spice things up and try something new. Looks like I messed up by keeping B&W on my ""to try"" list instead of going sooner- everything we ate and drank was top notch. I'd be remiss if I failed to mention the ambiance. Boulton & Watt boasts a large open space filled with long wooden communal tables, exposed brick walls and rustic decorations strewn about. We came in starving and ready for some grub, but the vibe makes for a great place to meet up with friends and have a few drinks.Now, onto the good stuff. Here's a run down of the eats:We started off with a more ""grown up"" version of pigs in a blanket - deliciously smoky bratwurst in place of a hot dog. Standard ketchup and yellow mustard? No way. These delicate little pastry puffs came accompanied with curried ketchup and spicy brown mustard. We had one each, but I'll be honest, I could have eaten ten.Me and my friend were both eyeing the fish tacos and the burger, so we decided to go splitsies. The fish tacos had the option of getting fried or seared. Fried is always the obvious choice for fish tacos. Sometimes fish tacos can be bite sized, but these were hearty and fresh pieces of fish with sliced avocado and aioli on top and a cilantro sauce on the side.  The burger was drool worthy. Medium rare and juicy with gruyere cheese, caramelized onions and crispy fries on the side. Nommm.  I didn't try the other dishes at the table, but everyone else was satisfied with their meal choice. The artichoke ravioli dish in a pesto cream sauce earned an A+ for presentation and the mussel pot was filled to the brim and had a thick broth.  And to wash it all down- I stuck to craft beer, but all of the roomies went with the Mexican revolver, which seems to be a signature drink here. I shied away because of the spice factor, but to my surprise it was actually very mild and refreshing.   Between the split app, an entree and 2 drinks each our bill was around 50 dollars a head. Pretty standard for above average food. I'll definitely be returning here again soon.",2,1,1

114,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1723,604,7753,4.0,5/25/2015,"We have been hitting up Boulton and Watt for brunch a ton. It's is surprisingly super affordable. It's not to hard to find a spot to sit either. There is also a wrap around  front patio which is a huge bonus when the weather is nice. And there are $5 BRUNCH COCKTAILS. I especially love ordering the Bloody Mary. It usually comes with a pickled brussel sprout and green bean but sometimes no green bean. I like their twist on some breakfast staples. They have eggs Benedict with little changes. I ordered the eggs poached over eggplant instead of the typical English muffin. It was also topped with fresh mozzarella and a tomato hollandaise. They were not too saucy. And I loved the eggplant substitution. The potatoes were also cooked well. I have also ordered the veggie burger here. It was huge! I like that it was homemade. It's a mixture of eggplant, garbanzos, kale and tzatziki. It was a little too big for my liking and almost too heavy.  However, I appreciate that I have an option here. The fries were the perfect side. Today we ordered the mac n cheese with mushrooms. It was $12 and it was super creamy. The dish had a yummy bread crumbs, seasoned with parsley, garlic and oil. We also ordered the addition of mushroom and they were seasoned perfectly and were obviously sauteed before mixing into the mac and cheese. I also liked the choice of noodle. They chose a rigged, circular, medium noodle, like a baby sized Rigatoni. I recommend this spot for group brunches, visiting parents or boozy brunches.Warning: The crowd can be annoying and you might spot a selfie stick.",1,,

I ordered the baked grits and mushrooms - crispy grits (very unique) atop a bed of creamy sautéed mushrooms and a poached egg. What a unique grits remix - it was delicious but very rich and creamy. Would've loved to have pair it with some spinach, kale and tomatoes. For the table we also ordered the baked mac and cheese with extra toppings. Again also delicious - perfectly cheesy and tasty. Will definitely be back do more. Greta for groups tough the high stool seating isn't very comfortable. The pickle jars are great as well. Give it a try! (They also have a tv for game days! )",,,

And those toasted crumbs on top added a nice crunch to each bite. Ooooh snap, the bacon was the icing on the cake! The quinoa salad was delicious in every bite.  Quinoa, sauteed kale, melon bits, slices of cucumber & goat cheese all meshed well together. And you have a little bit of sweet & savory to satisfy all your tastebuds.The before burger was surprisingly very moist. Unfortunately, it does get really messy since it breaks apart quickly.  But there's definitely lots of flavor in the patty. The fries are on the softer side.  Portions are large so you've been warned!Food? Delish. Service? On point. Perfect way to start the weekend!",2,,2

You mix it with cold milk and voila- you're in heaven! Definitely was worth it!! The only low side of the place is being super loud. You barely hear each other so end up shouting.

Overall, the combination of delicious food and great service means an awesome night.  The dishes were nicely presented.  Entree portion on the big side besides the house made duck ravioli that my friend had.  One little minor point I did not like was that for such a big restaurant, there was only one bathroom shared between the guys and gals so the line could get fairly long.",2,1,1

I'm into the old, rustic, southern-ish restaurant feel. Sometimes the place is crowded, and sometimes it's not. When I came in for brunch last weekend it was surprisingly not crowded, yet they seated us at the high chair communal tables. I would've much rather been at a private table, most of which were empty to begin with. I originally ordered the pulled pork benedict without the pork, so it would have been just with spinach, but the waitress suggested I order something else. She suggested the eggplant benedict, which was crispy eggplant, melted mozzarella, a poached egg, and a tomato hollandaise sauce. I enjoyed the eggplant and was surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I could've done without the cheese and the potatoes, they were too spicy and a little undercooked. I have also had the french toast here and it's very good. I am dying to come back for dinner to try the burger/mac and cheese/that cookie dessert! All in all, a solid place with decent food. It's not the best brunch I've ever had, but it's pretty easy to get a reservation and it's pretty reasonably priced, so it's a safe spot.",3,,2

We counted 18 open seats in the place. Second, do you honestly think it's going to take two hours to eat? Her snootiness wasn't necessary or appreciated. Our waitress came to the table quickly and was very nice. We both ordered the tickler cheddar & stone ground cheese grits. Now coming from the south and ordering grits can be dicey, but I went for it and I'm so glad I did.  The grits come topped with chorizo, charred tomatillo, and a poached egg. The dish was delish! I ate the entire thing which I rarely do. It's the perfect size and doesn't make you feel too full.

Especially the pickle menu.However, they've made some questionable staffing decisions. Especially in the bouncer. As my table was leaving (it was right next to the door) my friend accidentally bumped the bouncer with his bag. When he apologized, instead of accepting the apology, the bouncer agressively said he better pay attention to whose space he was in. My friend again tried to explain it was an accident but the bouncer wanted to hear none of it. Seeing that things were starting to get heated (and my friend getting frustrated) I stepped in to break up a potential fight (isn't that supposed to be the bouncer job?). I stepped in between them and asked everyone to relax that it was clearly an accident. My friend walked away, but the bouncer instead stepped closer to me and said ""you best back out of my face""Again, instead of trying to defuse confrontation (which I'm pretty sure is the bouncers job) he was instigating it. Eventually a manager came and defused the situation, but honestly it never should have gotten there in the first place. Still a good restaurant, just be sure to try and avoid getting to close to the bouncer who stands directly in front of the door in this crowded NYC bar.",,,

Well, we were very pleasantly surprised that our party of 4 was able to get seated immediately at 7:30 pm on a Saturday, and the food was warm, pricey, but delicious. Burger plate was a very large portion that came with a deluge of fries. Kale dip and brussel sprouts were great. Chocolate chip cookie for dessert came warm in a cast iron skillet and a glass of milk, which was really cute, but I think the best part of the cookie was that it was warm.I have intently studied the relationship between different pasta shapes and their role in cheese absorption that results in varying levels of deliciousness of mac and cheese. Pasta with a lot of ridges and nooks collect the melted cheese in a perfect cheese-to-pasta ratio, because no one likes a bite that is all pasta or one with too much cheese. Well, I have never seen anyone use rigatoni for mac and cheese before, but I emphatically applaud the chef's culinary choice to pair his melty white cheddar concoction with the unexpected pasta shape. The combination really worked, the pasta was perfectly al dente, every bite was packed with flavor, and no bit was without cheese. Adding the mushrooms are a must. Elbow macaroni is so middle school.   Be prepared to eat in the dark, so this is a great place to take a date or meet up with friends if you're feeling self conscious about a missing tooth or a new pimple that popped up overnight.",2,2,1

136,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,6/30/2014,"There's a lot of ""Perfect For"" categories that Boulton & Watt [1] could fall under. Perfect for: The first, second, or even third date, as B&W sports a laid-back, unpretentious vibe ideal for lingering and quiet conversations. Perfect for: an afternoon brunch with friends, when the group is looking for well-priced plates and drinks. Perfect for: a late night stop on a night out, when a final cocktail or glass of wine is the way to end the evening. Or, as in the case of my first visit here, perfect for: a raucous afternoon while watching the Kentucky Derby.My friend had enough foresight to make a reservation for four the afternoon of, and upon arriving, I realized what a good decision that had been. The entire venue seemed to be completely packed with people - sitting, standing, and walking around in their Sunday best. Our server was quite adept at navigating through the crowds, and we were able to successfully get in our drink orders as well as a few shared plates for the group.I was pretty happy with the Mint Julep, a drink special for the event that was priced at a mere $6 a glass. Served over the rocks, the bourbon base wasn't too strong, the mint garnish added some much needed zest, and there was just enough sweetness to balance out the drink. The food was pretty solid as well; the French Fries were cooked and seasoned with rosemary, satisfying when paired with cold ketchup. The Warm Kale and Artichoke Fondue was lightly baked so that it had a full range of textures in each spoonful, especially when topped on a slice of warm garlic crostini. And the B&W Mac and Cheese was similarly pleasing with an abundant amount of melted white cheddar, topped with a generous sprinkling of persillade bread crumbs.I unintentionally returned one late evening several weeks later with a group of friends; we ordered a bottle of Riesling to share, and wiled away the time laughing and talking. Perhaps because the restaurant was only occupied by a few other groups at the time, but we were given no pressure to order additional items or to leave once the wine bottle was empty. Thus, I can comfortably stand behind my opening statement: Boulton & Watt serves as a multi-purpose venue, ideal for many occasions and party sizes. After all, when you have a good space, adept service, and a strong selection of food and drinks, what else could you ask for?--[1] History buffs will also delight in knowing that the restaurant was named after Matthew Boulton and James Watt, two business partners in the 18th century.

Great choice-these were some of the best fries I've had in a while and came out piping hot. I ordered the salmon entrée which came on a bed of corn and salsa verde. I loved the corn and salsa verde, but the salmon was just ok. My friend got the brick over chicken with bacon and Brussels sprout mashed potatoes, which was great. They gave her a ton of chicken. One of the main reasons I wanted to come here was for the cast iron skillet cookie, so we gleefully dug into the amazing cookie with the spoons provided. This was probably the best part of the meal, and is a must have for anyone that has yet to try it. I loved the atmosphere in the bar/restaurant, but it did get very loud.

My only criticism would be the milk being served in a small pitcher.  We poured a little milk on the cookie and it ruined it by making it soggy and sopping up the flavor.  I think the milk is best drank on the side, but maybe that's just me.  The bartender was busy, flying around making cocktails and such so we can't really comment on service either although it appeared he had things under control.  The menu looks delicious.  I want to come back and try the food!  Cool, industrial vibe, too.  Very on-trend.",,,

Usually this type of dish is served cold but here it's served warm and it was so filling and tasty. My boyfriend had the veggie burger which he described as ""okay"". I had a bite and it wasn't bad, just maybe not our taste. Our table had two orders of the fried green tomato caprese appetizers because they were that good. For drinks, we all had Mexican Revolvers, which I highly recommend; just the right combo of sweet and spicy with a nice amount of alcohol.

Don't think I would come here for dinner, but if you're into a dinner and drink scene this could be a good place.I got the seasonal omelette which had pulled pork in it. I definitely ordered because of the pulled pork and while it was tasty, the portion and price left a little more desired. I think my 3 star review is more about value of this place than it is taste.Staff was super friendly and also very attentive, no complaints there!",,,

157,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3176,11053,3.0,8/4/2014,"Boulton & Watt seems to be winning in multiple regards. #1 is at attracting white girls. #2 is coming up with an extensive yet reasonably priced cocktail menu. and #3 is getting people piss drunk (watched a girl stumble out into the street, pass out, and then have an ambulance arrive... so that kinda drunk).The bartender with the afro was super cool, but everyone else behind the bar seemed to be (purposefully) aloof. The bar is long, but there are bulky stools and not enough room for more than 2-3 bartenders, so expect a wait.The two cocktails I had were the whiskey ones. The First Word and the Airplane! (their punctuation, not mine). I actually found both to be a bit too sickeningly sweet, the First Word less so. They're also both served out of coupe glasses, so I hope you're confident with your masculinity.They also serve their own blend of pickleback shots. We tried the habanero/pineapple one, and it just wasn't that good. Didn't have any of the kick of a pickleback, much less a spicy one. Disappointed with that one.",1,1,
158,Ann L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1000,402,1992,4.0,9/2/2014,"Pros:* Beautiful airy space with large windows, exposed brick, and industrial design elements. * Friendly and attentive staff * Delicious food and cocktails- my friends and I loved the Fish Tacos, Special Shrimp Flatbread Pizza (on the spicy side!) and Chicken Paillard. Served in generous portions and fresh ingredients. My drink Summer Sage was fruity and strong. Cons:* Beware of some of the surfaces of the large wooden tables as I got a dreadful splinter. I hope they cover these danger spots! Tip:* Breakfast menu served only on weekends- can't wait to try it out one weekend! Reading reviews, think it's better to come EARLY around 11AM to avoid the wait.",1,,

Bottle of wine is only $40 for the table - great to split with friends. Boulton and Watt has very successfully smashed traditional pub fare with fantastic Italian food. This week they had truffle mac and cheese balls - any chance to put on weight and do it with a smile? You bet i'm in. All joking aside, the pickles are phenomenal, beer is reasonably priced and all the appetizers are awesome. My usual go to dishes are the seared fish tacos, guacamole and the gnocchi. The vegetarian meatball entree is also delicious. I had the sunchoke gratin on the side my tacos and did not regret that one bit.",,,1

161,Charley K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",89,277,0,4.0,12/13/2015,"While a tad pricy, Boulton and Watt is a very good choice for dinner in the Lower East Side. Being a gastropub, the menu here is pretty extensive, and the device attentive, especially considering how busy and nosy the place can get. I didn't get to try the cocktails, but be warned, beers here are not cheap with the lowest price at $7.Upon recommendation, I ordered the burger with cheddar and caramelized onions. The patty was juicy and rich, and paired nicely with a soft, but lightly toasted bun. Very good, very tasty, if not that original. What WAS out of this world were the excellent rosemary fries, which were crispy and addictive. I also got to try the duck ravioli, which was creamy and rich, perhaps almost to a fault.High prices and noise aside, I still recommend Boulton and Walt for tasty food and good vibes on the LES.",,,
162,Adriana B.,"Union, NJ",198,26,0,3.0,2/10/2018,"To be honest, I was underwhelmed. The Mac and cheese was fine, but just that. The menu options were all over the place. I came for the cast-iron cookie and again it was fine, but just that. It was smaller than anticipated and it didn't taste like the dough had been fresh. Not my first choice in the future.",,,
163,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,4.0,9/3/2015,"Only stopped in here for a drink but I'd come back and check out their food. Their dessert menu also sounded pretty damn good. Who doesn't like skillet cookies? Anyway, on that Friday evening it was pretty chill. It wasn't crowded but also the place is pretty huge so there's ample seating. I had the Inspector Clouseau cocktail (Basil Hayden Bourbon, Lemon, Ginger, Lillet Blanc, Pamplemousse) and it was great. Of the ones we ordered, I think mine was the best. Refreshing, citrusy, and sweet, with a slice of candied ginger.Note: they need bag hooks at the tables!",1,1,1
164,Jordan E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,2,2,4.0,9/30/2015,After spending the day walking around we stopped in here for a drink and a bite. We started with a Mexican revolver and a beer. Both were a hit. We ordered the fried green tomato caprese and an order of guacamole and chips. The fried green tomatoes were amazing! We will be back for those.The other stand out was the whiskey shot with the chaser of pickled pineapple mint habanero juice. This drink changed my life it was so good.The staff was very friendly and made us out of towners feel at home.I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area.,1,,1
165,Philip N.,"New York, NY",8,149,26,4.0,6/28/2017,I was impressed with this place. Had the burger and got a helping of their pickles. Sampled a few of their drinks as well. All was good. The venue is pretty neat as well. Check it out.,,,

167,Lauren G.,"Brooklyn, NY",306,36,50,4.0,12/1/2016,"I came here with my team from work. I did not make the arrangements, my colleague who was in from Barcelona found Boulton & Watt on Yelp. this is a typical American (new) concept on the LES. It's a pretty large venue, tbh, but not very crowded for 7pm. It's a dark spot with this crazy mechanism for their fan 9worth noting, if you go you'll see why).I got two cocktails, they were both nice and tasty. The food was good too, however, all the options are pretty rich and cheesy or meaty. There really isn't anything light here. We got a whole bunch of smaller plates and shared. The spin dip is the only thing that jumps out to me as amazing. In reality, this place is a solid 3.5, but I'm nice so I round up.TLDR: Good place, nothing special. Great option if it's last minute since it doesn't seem to be very popular.",,,
168,Katy M.,"Chicago, IL",213,93,16,3.0,8/28/2016,"Came here with friends while I was visiting from Chicago. The food was great. The service was not. It started out okay. The server, female (I think her name was Susan) seemed really rushed. It wasn't busy. It was a Tuesday night. At the end of the meal, we asked to have my two friends' meals on one check and then mine on another. She brought out identical checks to each of us (itemized and everything). My food was not on any of the checks. When we told her what she did, she didn't acknowledge the mistake at all and just said that she'd go retrieve a new printed check. I additionally asked for a check of my own that had alcohol on one & food on another. She started to majorly throw some shade at that point and said that she was already bending the rules by splitting checks. Uh, the menu says checks can't be split more than 5 or 6 ways.... ours was split 3?! What the heck........?",1,1,
169,danica r.,"Berkeley, CA",256,9,0,1.0,7/25/2016,"I was here with a large group last Tuesday and the bartender charged my card instead of the card of another person in the group that I was with. Mistakes happen, sure, but when I discovered the mistake and tried to call the bar multiple times, nobody answered so I finally left a message. That was four days ago now and I haven't heard back. The charge was for $275, so not a small mistake. I could have disputed the charge with my bank (because I 100% guarantee they do not have a receipt with my signature on it), but decided to handle the mistaken charge myself. That night I had also tried to order a burger, which never got ordered by the bartender. When I asked the bartender about it he looked at me like I was stupid and said I never ordered one. Despite the fact that our group ended up spending over $500 there that night, he made no effort to make it right.Sure the food and drinks are good, but after spending 10 years in the service industry myself, no amount of good product makes up for terrible/unprofessional service, in my opinion.",2,,

171,Michelle M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,60,5,4.0,11/27/2016,"Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. I had the roasted chicken, which sounded like it might be a bit of a simple meal, but it was absolutely delicious and I was very pleased. My boyfriend got the fish tacos, which were good, but not nearly as good as my dish. We also got one of cast iron cookies, which was cool and creative, but did not entirely meet our expectations. Drinks were great and there was a great selection of all types of alcohol. The decor here is very unique and the service was great. My one warning is that this place gets very loud and the tables are very close together (we were less than a foot away from the tables next to us). It's good for a get together with a few close friends, but might be rough for a more intimate date night or a larger gathering.Overall, get a couple of friends and try it out. It has a great atmosphere and unique menu items that everyone could get into.",,,
172,Sam C.,"Manhattan, NY",529,52,27,4.0,7/4/2015,"This is definitely a new go to spot in the lower east side. Super casual, loud, and huge. We started with fried green tomatoes paired with fresh mozzarella and it was delicious. Entree's for 2 composted of ravioli (some vegetable ravioli) that was tasty and cooked well, and fish & chips which you can't really mess up. The star of this meal, however, was the cast iron cookie. CAST IRON COOKIE. A perfectly baked cast iron skillet cookie paired with a cold glass of milk. You don't even need to come here to eat dinner....just come here for that damn cookie.",2,,

I knew that I wanted the Quinoa & Kale salad and maybe the mac & cheese because the rest of the menu seemed too heavy for me. Wow!! Was I wrong. Everyone was so thrilled with all the dishes.  The cozy atmosphere and attentive service made the night extra special. We started with the mac & cheese, burrata, bone marrow toast, and brats in a blanket. I'm not a big meat eater but the brats in a blanket were absolutely delicious. We ordered the beef Wellington, squash spaghetti with eggplant meatballs, fish tacos, gnocchi, and of course the Quinoa & Kale salad. I wish we were hungrier; I wanted to try the butternut squash raviolis too.  Oh! And the hot apple cider hit the spot on a chilly night.  Thank you to the staff for a wonderful experience to help ring in the new year!",,,

The staff were friendly, seating us despite not having a reservation on a Saturday morning. Service was fast and our order of mac and cheese with mushrooms and bacon (for me) and seasonal omelette (for sis) arrived in good time. While we were eating the manager checked in on us (always a nice touch) and when he found out that we were looking for a cinema he went away again before coming back at the end of the meal with his recommendation along with how to get there (a single bus from outside the restaurant). A really nice unexpected extra service.No alcohol for us that day (had to keep our heads as we were both flying to our respective home cities!) I would like to go there for a drink another time though!",1,,1
175,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,10/30/2013,"After dining here a few times, I've found that  I really enjoy the rustic, slightly fratty environment of Boulton & Watt.The food is all very fresh, reasonably priced and well-portioned. They take the extra time to prepare certain things in-house, like the pickled vegetables and ground meats. Also, both the regular and veggie burger are well executed, and they both come with a huge mound of fries. Definitely appreciated, especially because burgers being served with fries is something that is becoming rarer and rarer in New York City.Music is always blaringly loud in the corners of the restaurant, so try to get seated somewhere away from the speakers. Also, they took away the pot pie from the menu, so I'm docking a star. That pot pie was probably one of the best I've ever had, so it was terribly disappointing the last time I was there and they had taken it off the menu. Please bring it back.Haven't tried the cocktails here, but they seem to have generally favorable reviews, so I'll have to try them next time I'm there. Seriously though, bring the pot pie back.",4,1,1

Points for being one of the only spots in the area that the kitchen is open after 11pm! Our tummies thank you. The Guac is solid. I'm a fan. This was my dinner and it was spicy and tasty! I heard the cocktails are good. The environment is good. Mostly young professionals who are out for a nice chill night out. You wont have to worries about sticky floors or trying to find toilet paper in the bathroom in this place...... def not a divey type of bar. I say this even though I had an economic dynamic profitability argument with some drunk dude that worked for Unicef. Apparently he didn't think Banks are needed. I guess he wants to be paid in chickens. NOT A SLAM ON UNICEF BY ANY MEANS. Just funny argument to have at 1am at a bar. #1st world adult problemsPlease look up at the bar.

180,Bianca B.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",3,33,11,5.0,12/1/2016,"Literally such an amazing place. My boyfriend and I tried this place a few years back when I found the place on Instagram... A photo of a delicious looking cookie skillet & a pitcher of milk... Yes. So, we went one day and it was jammin - the place, the atmosphere, the people. Everything was great. We were greeted by the most friendly staff and we instantly felt like we had belonged. Side note: you must order the fried green tomatoes, they are to die for. That also may be because I'm obsessed with balsamic glaze reduction! Anyway, we went back to this place again this weekend - for my birthday - and it was a Sunday night so they weren't busy at all - although their kitchen is still open til midnight! So, again ordered the fried green tomatoes, so delicious, and our waitress was a doll. We were practically the only ones in Boulton & honestly, it felt just like the last time.. Super cozy and homie, and the staff makes you feel like you should eat there every night. Again, we got the skillet cookie and it was delicious. Overall, such an amazing place - I rave about it all the time! A must try.",,,
181,Brittany R.,"Tenafly, NJ",1,9,2,3.0,7/16/2017,"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend because it looked like it had a nice ambiance inside and out (there is outdoor seating). They have cute ""jar"" menu items which are appetizers served in a jar. We ordered a single beet jar which was good but I ordered the steak for my main course which was around $26 which is a good price for steak, but not for a plate full of fries. The steak was well over cooked almost burned on the outside super dry no flavor and it was a terribly small portion the entire dish was a giant plate of fries with a few pieces of over cooked dry steak. Would not recommend for food, although they have some interesting plates I may try something new if I went back.",,,

I arrived to the restaurant a bit before my reservation time, and I appreciated that they still seated me at the table early while I waited for my friends.

It was a saturday night, so our server was super crazy busy, but still gave us the proper attention. We ordered from the pickle bar. As a non pickle eater, I did not partake, but my pickle loving friends said all of them were amazing. PS - They do pickleback shots here! (I'll take my whiskey straight though). Everything looked so good, I personally had a hard time choosing, but I heard the mac and cheese had to be eaten, so one of my friends and I decided to order some things and share. The new thing is to abstain from gluten, but kick your paleo diet to the curb for a night and get the mac and cheese. This is not to be missed. Perfect radio, perfect consistency. Not as heavy as most mac and cheeses are. We also got the veggie burger. It basically taste like a falafel... but a really good one. The birthday girl ordered her entree... the duck confit. It was the last one! Luckily birthday girl! Everyone was very pleaseed with their food, their drinks. For dessert (we were celebrating a birthday), we did three out of four desserts. The ice cream (yes please!), the cookie pan and the bread pudding. If you are into desserts, do it up!",2,1,3
185,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",883,399,423,4.0,5/9/2016,"Boulton and Watt is that type of laid back, unpretentious restaurant that you can go to for a casual nights out with your girl/guy friends for drinks and filling affordable food. The dress code here ranged from really casual to ready-for-clubbing. The music was loud and lively, and everyone shared communal tables. If you're in a big enough of a group with a reservation beforehand, then you can be guaranteed your own table.The food here leaned towards Southern, so lots of cheese and lots of deep-fried things with pretty decent sized servings. Personally, I'm not a huge Southern food person as I find it far too heavy, but I was able to appreciate the flavors here. We started with the artichoke fondue, pineapple pickle jar, and asparagus with bacon and sunny-side up egg to share. The artichoke fondue tasted like artichoke dip, so it was quite tasty, but I was not a fan of the really hard bread that came with it. The pickle pineapple was really refreshing and had a nice kick to it. A few of my friends thought this was spicy, but I really couldn't taste any spice. The asparagus was cooked to the perfect level of crunchiness and thus by far my favorite dish and probably the only healthy option of the night (ignore the part about the bacon).  For my entree, I had the shrimp pappardelle, an all around really flavorful pasta. There was nothing super spectacular about it, but if you're looking for something hearty, it will definitely do the trick There was so much in it - shrimp, asparagus, tomatoes, cheese, etc. - that my tiny self couldn't finish everything. Since it was my friend's birthday, the restaurant kindly put a big candle on her cookie cake dessert. The cookie cake comes with a huge jug of whole milk on the side - a really cute idea!",1,1,3

Waitress was so cold and actually rolled her eyes at us today just because we said we were still waiting for a friend. Food was decent but served cold. Got one of the Benedicts and the egg did not run, it was overcooked. Sangria was flavorless. Bathroom was dirty (no paper towels and the soap was watered down which made me weary).

197,Ashley A.,"Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY",90,111,189,4.0,8/6/2015,"I've always wanted to stop by this place as I live right around the corner. My roommates and I finally stopped by for a late night meal and we were very happy with our experience! The atmosphere is super cool and the establishment is huge. It's a great place to bring large groups, for sure.We ordered the brussel sprouts, rosemary fries, watermelon arugula salad, the bacon cheeseburger, and the calamari. Also, we shared a bottle of white wine for $35. The brussel sprouts were great--they came with bacon chunks and who doesn't like bacon chunks? The watermelon arugula salad was also incredible and, I believe, the special of the day. The feta cheese and watermelon combo was definitely a winner. The bacon cheeseburger was also super incredible. I've never seen a bacon cheeseburger served with cubes of bacon instead of slices of bacon, but this definitely worked! The calamari was pretty decent, not the best I've ever had, but the dipping sauce was great and had a nice, spicy kick! Also, the rosemary fries were a bit too salty for my taste.The service was great--the woman was extremely friendly and outgoing, which was awesome! And it was great that she would check in once in a while. My only qualm was that it was a bit pricey. I'd definitely be back though!",,,
