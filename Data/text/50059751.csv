Hungry cat much approves - I heart this place, will be back.",1,,1

Food: we both got the avocado smash with lox on toast and truffle eggs. Avocado smash was so fresh and creamy and perfect to complement the brine bite of the lox :) scrambled eggs were fluffy and full of truffle flavor! Drinks: matcha latte- not too sweet but with just the right amount of sweetness. Space: cute ambiance with marble tables and counter tops and eclectic coffee shop artwork, succulents, and tidbits making it homey. Acoustics good to chat with friend and no need to shout to be heard or feel like you are disturbing other patrons. Service: quick, professional, friendly.Price: $16 for avocado smash with lox and truffle eggs- not too bad considering quality of ingredients and amount given. $6 matcha latte- on par with other places here in nyc. Overall would come back to try other items on the menu or to just enjoy and sip another matcha latte!",,,

Updated review","In person this place is awesome!!!  For Delivery- I am extremely disappointed. The food was edible, and some of it good. What I am not happy with is how much it cost & the quality for the exorbitant pricing. The oats bowl was $9 and when we got it I was so shocked with how small it was and how it was watery. $9 I expect something much larger than 5oz of oats and watery milk. I understand that Nyc is expensive but there is a line. And they crossed it.",,,
3,Sravya R.,"Memphis, TN",273,30,35,3.0,11/9/2018,"It was a very cute place. I got a matcha waffle, and it was definitely subtly good, but not what I as expecting. I think I'm used to crispy and sweet with waffles. I couldn't taste the powdered sugar because there wasn't enough I think? Only thing I tried though. And it looked beautiful when it came out. Their strawberries used for topping were really sweet and good.",,,
4,Iamnee P.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",17,12,3,2.0,11/19/2018,"Went there yesterday with high expectation from good reviews here. However, it wasn't as great as we expected. I ordered chicken waffle sandwich, and I barely finished it even though I was super hungry, because the chicken was so dry and very hard to chew. I don't know you guys used old chicken or it was made from frozen meat. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs with avocado on the bread, and he couldn't finish it either. He said the eggs smell weird like it was cooked with an old oil. The avocado on the bread looked good but taste pretty bad. Anyway, the service was average and the atmosphere was great. I hope you can improve the food quality in the future.",,,

Updated review","At wattle again for lunch.  I can't describe how much I love this place. Sadly fletcher is gone. But Tom is is Australian replacement.  Today we had the charcoal ricotta pancake, Tuna sandwich, chicken avocado sandwich, and an egg (for my daughter)The tuna salad is OUTSTANDING. In a crunchy whole grain bread. The chicken avocado sandwich is also excellent. Pesto on the bread. Perfectly cooked chicken  I order the pancake because it settles my stomach. It is a very light flavor and needs to be dunked in maple syrup. Good coffee good food. Come here!",,,
6,Sara B.,"New York, NY",341,2,4,5.0,10/4/2018,Best coffee and brunch food in the city!! Love that it's small because the food tastes fresh and is thoughtfully prepared (instead of the other assembly line restaurants in the city)! Keep up the great quality and service!,1,,
7,Victoria T.,"Watertown, CT",107,79,416,5.0,2/16/2018,"My partner and I went here for a Valentine's Day brunch and we loved it. I had been following this restaurant on IG for a while since I had seen such cute photos tagged there, but it wasn't a neighborhood I went to often enough to try. On Valentine's Day girlfriend wishes count extra, though, so we walked from Penn to get our brunch on. Huge pro: weekends or weekdays, anytime, brunch is served. L O V E. Their insta has said special red 'beet' waffles were on the menu so I asked if they taste like beets. The guy at the counter said 'well, yeah'... and the owner said 'like beets, but doughy, and with maple, but... like beets'. I felt adventurous and honestly they were pretty good! They were only slightly beet-ish? Partner says they are definitely beet-ish, haha. The avocado toast and truffle eggs were a great savory options as well. Double decker avo toast - try eating it like a stack of pancakes! My mocha had a surprise teddy bear on it, which I loved. And then the owner surprised us with Australian Tim-Tams for our cute Yelp photos! Hey, can't 'beet' that ;) I hope I can go more when I'm in midtown east!",2,1,2

I tried their signature cacao waffle avocado smash and was not disappointed. The waffle is light and fluffy with just enough flavor and the avocado smash was delish! The cafe does have some cooling issues and can get pretty warm sometimes, but the food and coffee will not disappoint.",5,2,6

I had a cappuccino and the Aussie waffle (a waffle with a side of bacon and two fried eggs). The coffee was delicious. It was strong but not too bitter. The food was very tasty too. The price was about $15 total and it was a great price for a decent breakfast in midtown. Their menu was huge and I'd definitely like to return and try some of their other items. The staff was very friendly. I also liked that there was plenty of seating despite the small space. Great spot!,,,

Updated review","Oh okay. I spoke too soon. Initially I'd said that I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but that was before I had their avocado smash w salmon and truffles eggs. Oh my geezus. I can't even begin to express how wonderfully the medley of flavors complemented each other. Not only the flavors, but the textures really worked well too. Everything was so fresh and beautiful. I would definitely go out of my way just to have it again.  That time, I also got a matcha latte- a safer and more reliable option for me. I know what to expect and when one is good vs lacking. This one was wonderful! Plenty of matcha and plentiful serving size. My only critique would be to blend the matcha powder better before adding the rest of the milk. However, being packed w flavor trumped that small detail.But seriously. Try the avocado smash w salmon and truffles eggs. You won't be disappointed.",,,
15,Theresa E.,"Monroe, NC",252,135,94,5.0,1/30/2018,"In my never-ending search for a great Saturday brunch, I came across the menu for the Wattle Cafe on a Friday from a client and decided, based on the great items, I was going to give them a try.Me and several friends headed over there and my first impression was that although it was very small with limited seating, it was well appointed and clean.  The staff were very polite and helpful as we chose our beverages and food items.  I had the green tea latte and the truffled eggs avocado smash (at least I think that was the name!) and both were delicious and very reasonably priced.  The truffled eggs were not greasy and had just enough truffle oil to accent the flavor of the eggs without overpowering them.  The latte was delicious but you have to be careful not to leave with green lips!  My friends had various waffle dishes and everyone enjoyed their choices.  I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the menu items here.My ONLY suggestion is that they revisit their seating plan, as the food isn't really designed for take out, however it can be challenging to find a seat if you aren't there as a couple or a single.",,,
16,Jon Q.,"New York, NY",1,6,1,1.0,10/13/2018,"This was the most overpriced and disappointing smoothie I've ever ordered. It came out very thin, more like the consistency of milk than a smoothie. Decided to throw it out after a few sips. It was almost like they made it the night before and left it in the refrigerator. And rude employees",,,
17,Lucy L.,"Cambridge, MA",419,6,6,4.0,5/23/2018,"The inside of this cafe is so cute - my ideal aesthetics. I just wanted a light breakfast so I ordered plain waffles with fresh fruit and coconut. I'd say the presentation was amazing (A+ instagram material), while the waffles themselves were a bit dry and nothing too special. Overall my experience was great and the food was not bad, but I have marked Wattle Cafe as a place to return to, to try other items on their menu (seems like I have missed out on some great hits based on other reviews I'm reading)!",4,,5

19,Ashley D.,"Baltimore, MD",209,278,629,3.0,4/13/2018,"Cute spot, but honestly what's holding me back from a better review is the lack of a restroom. I would have enjoyed my meal much more if it wasn't for the fact I felt so preoccupied with how much I just needed to finish my coffee and food just to be able to use a restroom.Small cute cafe with some good food and Aussie inspiration. We had the waffle with fresh fruit and an acai bowl. I was a big fan of both. It's hard to go wrong with a well made waffle and something as refreshing as acai. Overall, the food was a great start to the day. If only there was a restroom...",1,1,
20,Tanvi D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,11/3/2018,"We had the smoked salmon and smash avocado with truffle eggs and the dark chocolate waffles. The smash avocado was amazing and the truffle eggs truly enhanced the flavour of the dish. However, the dark chocolate waffles were quite terrible. They were dry and pretty tasteless and disappointing. However, the staff was helpful when we complained and gave us some house jam for the waffles which was better but charged us an additional fee for the jam.For drinks, we had the latte and the milo milkshake (iced). The latte was great, however the milo milkshake could have been more chocolatey. The Tim Tams were a wonderful surprise and are must to try if you have never had it before.Overall, wattle cafe is a cute new addition to midtown, with great eggs and avocado and is worth coming here just for that.",,,
21,jill r.,"San Diego, CA",30,76,68,4.0,8/25/2018,So glad we found this little gem while visiting NYC. I was looking for matcha tea and found even more here. We ordered traditional matcha latte and a turmeric matcha latte. Both were delicious and the turmeric was exactly what I was looking for to help with inflammation after catching a red eye. What I didn't expect were the yummy waffles made with matcha or charcoal with pure maple syrup. Felt healthy and a little decadent for a Monday and i loved them. We didn't try the avocado toast options but will be on my to do list for next time. And the iced blue algae drink too!,,,
22,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,817,371,4.0,3/8/2018,"LOVE this midcentury modern coffee house with waffles and interesting baked goods. Apparently the owner, Ana, is one of those essential oils devotees. I think that's all nonsense but the great thing about this place on 33rd and 3rd is that you can enjoy a WONDERFUL waffle and delicious eggs for 6 bucks plus a fantastic cup of coffee served in a yellow cup/saucer without buying into all the bizarre concoctions. No refills and the coffee is so good that you must buy two. Still, for Murray Hill, this is a bargain breakfast place you actually want to hang out. The music is good (alternates between Sinatra and R and B and jazz). I happened upon it because my cat was getting a spa day at Walter's Pet Styles (the best groomer /daycare on the East Side!) and it was snowy and slushy. If I lived in Murray Hill, I'd be a regular. Can't wait to try other waffle combinations and coffees.",5,1,3
23,Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",722,338,653,4.0,8/8/2017,"Such a cute cafe serving some good lunch/brunch options - the roasted veggie sandwich I had was really well done and a substantial portion size. The addition of a light pesto and grilled vegetables made this an easy and hearty option for lunch. The husband had the eggs and toast with a side salad - pretty staple fare, if you're looking for a comfortable go-to brunch option. I agree that the coffees are a tad on the pricier side - but they are on point and really excellent. My almond latte was unbelievably good - delicate and rich at the same time and I took a sip of the husband's drip coffee and really liked it. Intrigued by the fruit infused tea and walnut almond date balls - both looked delectable. And yes Yelp check in gets you 15% discount.",19,9,18

25,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1146,813,3.0,8/9/2017,"This is a beautiful cafe, and I can tell that the owners put a lot of thought into the decor and menu. However, the items I ordered were quite pricey and left much to be desired. I ordered a tumeric latte for the beautiful color and an acai bowl, which cost me a hefty $15 (I forgot to use the Yelp Check-in 15% discount, darn it). Yes, their food is very photogenic - and I'm sure you can ask them to take extra care in preparing your items - but I was not impressed by my drink or my acai bowl. I'm definitely not used to acai the way they make it here. I expected more of a smoothie texture from the acai, but instead got a weird apple sauce texture. Also, what I thought was nectarine or mango on my acai bowl was actually really oxidated apples (totally caught me off guard when I took a bite). Not really what I was expecting when the employee at the counter mentioned 'fresh cut fruit'. Finally, I was expecting a little more thoughtfulness in the presentation of my latte, but all I got was a lot of yellow foam. I guess it was because the teddy bear latte artist was at the end of his shift for the day. Yes, I might have felt better about myself after the acai bowl (#powerfood #cleaneats) but I literally spent my entire time sitting in the cafe staring across the street at the Sticky's and wondering if I should supplement my 'meal' with an order of chicken fingers. Alas, this may be one of those cafes that look great on Instagram, but doesn't deliver in terms of their drinks or food. If you are in the area and have a few hours to kill or need a place to use wifi, this may be a good option, but even then, there are quite a few coffee shops along 3rd Ave. edit: if you want a fantastic acai bowl, head down to LES Pause Cafe (much cheaper and soooooo delicious)",3,3,2
26,Tara W.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",18,107,274,5.0,4/12/2018,"Good for brunch or breakfast. It's awesome. I love the place. It's small, clean and beautiful. I like both the chicken and the avocado waffles.",,,
27,James W.,"New York, NY",165,276,401,2.0,3/11/2018,"My friend and I came here yesterday for brunch. We planned on going to the movie theater after and wanted something close to the AMC Kips Bay down the street. After a thorough Yelp search of ""brunch places nearby,"" I found the Wattle Cafe, an Australian-inspired cafe with ""wattle"" as its country's namesake flower. The photos looked great and the menu looked even better. Originally from LA, I was happy to see that they offered a variety of healthy brunch options such as avocado toast, acai bowl, salmon avocado toast, matcha, and turmeric latte. They also had a few other Australian goodies like Tim Tams and their best-known waffles (which can be made with any of their sandwiches).My friend ordered the avocado toast with truffle scrambled eggs and a matcha latte. And, I ordered the truffle scramble with salmon avocado mash toast, acai bowl, and an iced matcha Americano. The cafe itself is clean, small, and has limited seating (can seat about 14 people), and my friend and I managed to grab 2 seats at the big round table at the center of the cafe.All of our food had come out pretty quickly and I was still waiting for my iced matcha Americano. Suddenly, the barista (tall gentleman with the man bun and an accent) comes up and asks how I would like the iced matcha Americano made. I stared at him and asked, ""what do you mean?"" He asks if I wanted the ""matcha powder in the water"" or the ""matcha powder in the espresso."" So, I've actually never had an iced matcha Americano before and this was my first time visiting Wattle Cafe, so I was a little confused why the barista was asking me how to make a drink that's on their menu. I told him to make the drink the way that they typically make it, and he responds and says that ""no one has ever ordered this drink before."" I found that hard to believe, but could be true. Even though patrons typically don't order this drink, I would imagine that a barista is trained to learn how to make every drink that is on their menu. Although I was looking forward to trying my first iced matcha Americano, I decided to change my drink order to something else. I asked him if he knew how to make a Turmeric latte (since I saw photos of it, and knew people had ordered it before). And honestly, I was disappointed in how it tasted. I didn't really taste the Turmeric at all.My friend liked her truffle scramble and avocado toast and matcha latte. I also thought the truffle scramble and salmon avocado toast was good, but was disappointed in the acai bowl. I hoped for a little more sweetness from the fruit and toppings (though there wasn't much of it) and I probably should've added some honey to it. And as I had mentioned, I didn't find the Turmeric latte as delicious as it looked in pictures on Yelp and Instagram.The seating situation is pretty horrendous. I don't think I sat a minute in that cafe without someone bumping into me. There was even a patron who thought it was appropriate to tell me to scoot my chair to make room for him to walk by me when there wasn't any room for me to move. In addition to that, there were people snaking around the cafe waiting to order, pick-up their order, or just hovering over tables waiting for chairs/stools. Despite the cafe being overly busy (so busy that I was picking up other people's coffee mugs and returning them to the cashier), there were some patrons who weren't eating or drinking anything and just hanging out on their laptop while other people were waiting intently to sit down. Where was the manager on this busy Saturday afternoon?       Since this was my first time coming here, I'm not sure if my experience was atypical. I really wanted to try the waffles as well as some of the other beverages on the menu, but I wonder if the barista is going to know how to make it? After this experience, I've become less inclined to come back.",1,,

The menu is rooted in Australian fare and call me uncultured, but I didn't  see anything uniquely Australian about the food (eg avocado toast and waffles seem pretty standard?). Everything is overpriced and the service is subpar. The cashier didn't communicate my order to the barista for a solid 4-5 minutes, out of pure forgetfulness - he wasn't even busy. The drinks aren't any better than those I've had at other coffee shops. I do appreciate that there's a wide selection of non dairy milk options - namely hemp, coconut, and oat. Additionally, there's ample seating and unique reading material on deck in case you want to post up for a while. Overall,  this place leaves a lot to be desired.

44,Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",858,1985,61,1.0,7/7/2018,"Review for coffee only, not food:       I'm not like most New Yorkers.  I'm too cheap to buy my coffee out every day (why pay $4 when I can grind some myself for 25 cents a day?) so getting coffee out for me is like a once every couple months treat.  I was really excited to try this place, I had gone in once before to look and the food looked amazing.  But the drink.  Oh my Lord, the drink.   There was nobody in there and the wait in a 100 degree space was crazy long (a/c must have been broker).  The worker looked at me like I had 3 heads when I ordered.   I was asking him for an iced coffee that didn't cost $6 - he said there was basic iced coffee I could get for $4.  When he handed it to me it was so light in color and mostly ice.  It also was about 3/4 full.  I asked for some almond milk.  Again, got looked at strangely.  I was starting to think there was something wrong with my face.   He took out the box of almond milk and started shaking it so that the last few tiny drops went into my cup, then handed it to me.   I had to ask for more almond milk.  Again, the look I got.  He opened a new box and again poured the most miniscule amount.  It still didn't fill the cup to the top.  At that point I gave up, seeing why people like Starbucks with their help yourself milk bar.                                                As for the coffee - it was the most horrible, bitter tasting 'coffee tinted water' of my life.  I couldn't even drink it and had to stop blocks away for a sweet treat to get the awful taste out of my mouth.   So much for the $4 iced coffee!",4,1,1

When you enter in the cafe the set up is really cute. They have marble countertops. A big table in the center with 2 long counters facing the wall and the street. Very insta-worthy if you're into that. I got the Cayenne chicken on a waffle. They said that I could have any one of their sandwiches on a waffle so I had to give it a shot. I mean who doesn't get the waffle option when they are given it?...and it was delicious. Like seriously delicious. It also filled me up which I wasn't expecting it to do. Definitely going to go back sometime soon to try another thing on their menu.",,,

My only complaint is when I was in there it was busy and got extremely hot very quickly.  I would like to come back on another day that was not as busy. They have tons of waffles to choose from.  They also have a variety of hot and cold drinks and pastries.  If in the area definitely check this place out!,,,

The atmosphere was welcoming with a shared table to sit at displaying multiple magazines. I ordered the avocado smash on sweet potatoes instead of bread. The avocado mash was great and very large but I ate it on two slivers of sweet potato. I wanted more sweet potato. My friend ordered the muesli and I tried some. I thought it was a nice portion and very fresh with the assortment of fruit mixed in. I would order the muesli instead next time.,,,
51,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",363,60,636,4.0,1/30/2018,"This is such a underrated cafe in the Kips Bay area! Not going to lie - at first I thought the sign said ""waffle cafe"", so I always walked by it thinking it specialized in waffles. My perception wasn't completely false though, they do have a small selection of waffles that aren't top-notch, but good enough to satisfy waffles cravings. Contrary to the very plain cafe sign, the interior is quite nice. It's filled with a bright and energetic vibe that probably stems from the yellow themed cups, dishes, furniture, and decor, and the staff is also very bubbly. I only went for coffee and waffles, but had a really pleasant time. There aren't too many seats, so you probably have to go at on off-time to grab a spot. The seats by the window are also nice, because you just get to shamelessly people watch. The menu was pretty extensive, and I saw a ton of people order breakfast and brunch. I think there is WiFi too, so it's definitely a great place to crank out some emails. Overall, this cafe has quality coffee and lots of healthy food options. I look forward to becoming a regular here!",1,,
52,Staci B.,"New York, NY",7,53,15,5.0,4/21/2018,Found this place by chance. It was either this or the Subway to doors down. So glad we did! Inexpensive and tasty food. We had waffles with scramble eggs and matcha tea. It was until we finished the tea we realized they had Milo. (We are Jamaican and Milo is a big deal for us.)So now we have a reason to come back.The place is quite small (i.e. tight) so hopefully it doesn't get too popular...:),,,

The skill the baristas have with creating pictures in the foam is crazy and has me questioning how more people don't come here for Instagram bragging rights alone. Not to mention when I got a granola bowl from here the other day the server preparing it was so sweet and told me he would make it as fast as he can because he knows it's right before work and didn't want to make me late. He was literally running back and forth across the kitchen. A+ for service!,,1,

Food menu looks appealing but I was only there to get a drink. I ordered the matcha latte. When I took a sip, it tasted ok, but the drink was not hot. It was just warm. I was so disappointed. Not sure if that's normal but I'm pretty sure I've had hotter matcha lattes elsewhere. I walked outside with my lukewarm drink in hand and it did not help keep me warm. I finished the drink walking in less than a whole avenue block cuz the temperature of the drink was so easy to gulp down.",1,,1

We asked why they're closing early and she screamed ""because I'm the only barista and I've been vomiting for the last week"" We only ordered a coffee, but after taking one sip we were both grossed out so we tossed the coffee. The owners seemed to be standing behind this barista and they had a weird interaction with her. The one sip of coffee I had was great so it's a shame we had this bad interaction",1,,

Australian style cafes are always the best, but it can be a hit or miss, however Wattle provided sweet and savory munches that really satisfied my stomach!!Coffee is given in huge proportions so that explains the price!What we got: Avocado Smash- creamy avocado spread with eggs that complimented the taste. The bread wasn't at all as hard as most avo toasts that I've eaten, so there wasn't a struggle in finishing at all with just a knife and fork! I'm appreciative of the radish and tomatoes presented on the plate. It's nice to have bites in between with the extra garnishes. The pepper flakes also gave it a really good kick  Banana PBJ- shareable and individually sliced, it was definitely much more scrumptious than any other PBJ you've tasted, especially with the fruits on it and the homemade jam was spot onnnnPresentation is also A++++! The staff is really friendly and encouraging of social media pics, which being a foodie means a lot hehe. Also when you check in on Yelp, you get 15% (sweeeet)!

The staff, including who I'm assuming is the owner, were very friendly. Their menu isn't as extensive as say Egg Shop, but it's plenty serviceable. Although they claim to be Aussie, and while the specks of tastefully distributed Aussie paraphernalia also suggests so, their food isn't very Australian aside from the availability of Flat Whites and Tim Tams, but I suppose that'll suffice.

Charging $11.00 for legitimately a couple of eggs, burnt toast and a disgusting salad should make someone ashamed.

100,Marlena H.,"Bloomfield, NJ",1,7,0,5.0,9/7/2017,Adorable little cafe that I often go to for a great cup of coffee (or matcha) and some delicious food to go along with it. I'm obsessed with their lox on a waffle! It has a very homey feel with a big communal marble table in the middle with books and magazines that you can thumb through while relaxing in the morning. Ana is incredibly nice and takes such care in her cafe and it really shows! Definitely stop by if you're in the area!,,,
101,Andrew C.,"Manhattan, NY",49,28,0,5.0,6/17/2017,"Great little cafe in the neighborhood. Both breakfast and lunch options are good, especially loved the cayenne chicken. Service also great. Only feedback is some nice blinds or shades on the windows would give it a cozier feel.",,1,
102,Jessica J.,"Las Vegas, NV",242,12,16,2.0,7/27/2017,"Ordered acai bowls at work today and couldn't believe how small they were- acai bowls are always a little expensive, but at least they're usually large/filling. This one comes in a tiny little cup and is $10! We were so disappointed, and they were so bad we both threw them out. What a waste of money",,,
103,Kiana B.,"Seattle, WA",2,16,3,5.0,5/13/2017,"Lots of great healthy options. I love the acai bowl here. It's a little overpriced I would say, but it was worth it.",1,1,
104,Deborah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,26,0,5.0,1/12/2018,Wow. I'd take a picture of the avocado smash but I ate it too quickly. They have turmeric lattes. YUM! Right around the corner from my OB. Pregnant ladies: come here after your appointment! Such amazing healthy food. An incredible find.,,,
105,Murad A.,"Gainesville, FL",0,30,5,5.0,4/30/2017,I had a great brunch and one of the best pour over cups in a while. The barista poured all her love into that cup. I will always remember the taste! A tiny and well lit location with a feeling of lightness and tranquil. I'd trim a star for overcooked poached eggs but i think it happens with new places and new appliances. All in all i left 100% satisfied,1,1,
106,Jane I.,"Long Island City, NY",3,25,54,4.0,6/9/2017,I had their turmeric chai with almond latte- they make their own concoction so it tasted very fresh.,,,
107,Joey C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",373,43,35,5.0,6/3/2017,Im new in the block looking for my morning boost. I suddenly passed by this cafe.  Pretty good espresso shot! Will definitely try pastries,,,
108,Ruth H.,"New York, NY",4,63,64,4.0,5/20/2017,The place is nice and friendly. The coffee is quite good but not the best New York has to offer. Food looks great. Ruth Haephrati. Michael Haephrati,,,
109,Edna M.,"New York, NY",72,23,29,5.0,5/5/2017,Such a clean environment. I love being able to eat somewhere that offers vegan options. Will be back!,,,
110,Matthew B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,43,5,2.0,6/1/2017,"Nice little spot, but iced coffees seem unreasonably priced here. $5 for a small, $6 for the large. As much as I'd like to give this place a try, with Perk offering Stumptown a couple blocks away at $3.50/$4.00, it's hard to justify choosing this place.",,,
111,Ling S.,"Southampton, NY",1,33,0,2.0,11/5/2017,"Found this place on seamless and it said it was open(both on yelp and seamless), after placing an order and order was even accepted by the restaurant...delivery guy called us and said the restaurant was NOT open, this was 10am on a Sunday. Don't put your restaurant on seamless and accept orders if you are not actually open!",,,
112,Gunj S.,"Wallingford, CT",1,5,0,1.0,5/21/2017,"I would not recommend Wattle Cafe until the staff takes a service 101 course. We put in our order of an Americano coffee, weekly pour over, BLT smash, and cayenne chicken sandwich with avocado. We were charged for all the above, along with an acai bowl we did not order. Note: at this point there were only a couple other customers in the cafe. As we took our seats at the side bar, we watched as orders after ours were also taken incorrectly. Once rectified, the staff had difficulty executing the orders. The gentleman who ordered after us, got our BLT smash and the staff was confused when he told them this wasn't what he ordered. When we said that was part of our order, they looked even more confused. Three incorrect sandwiches and 15 minutes later, the gentleman finally got his avocado smash (we have yet to receive our food at this point). There was a group of girls who had been at the cafe since before we arrived and we noticed that they had yet to receive their food as well. One of them even checked up on it with the staff a couple of times and had to remind them of what she ordered. We finally received the americano coffee. There's a general understanding that all cafe's will have an area for customers to add a dairy of their choosing along with sweetener for their coffee. The dairy was nowhere to be found. When asked, the staff again looked confused. We watched as two additional groups (one before and one after us) got incorrect, then finally correct orders. Twenty plus minutes into our wait and we had yet to get our food.When it finally arrived (in a to-go bag when we had asked for dine-in) I asked as confirmation that this was the BLT smash and cayenne chicken sandwich with avocado and one of the servers said yes. Seeing how the last 25 minutes had gone, I was skeptical. When I checked the cayenne chicken sandwich for the avocado (after paying the extra $2 for it), it was nowhere to be found. Was it worth it to go back to them and let them know of this mishap? No. We ate our sub-par, overpriced sandwiches quietly and left. Not only was the quality of service awful, but the attitudes of everyone who worked there made it pretty obvious that they were unhappy and deflecting that onto their customers. We will not be returning.",,,
113,Megan M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,12,0,5.0,7/15/2017,I came here specifically for the turmeric lattes and it did not disappoint. What was just as delightful was the Avo Smash I had on Day One and the Egg Croissant I had on Day Two. Will be back!,,,
114,Camille C.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,9,0,5.0,7/9/2017,I don't know how this place does it- but their eggs are seriously amazing. I know you're thinking... it's just eggs. But they're the best eggs I've ever had!! So fluffy and farm fresh.,,,
115,Jessica B.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,23,0,5.0,6/15/2017,Awesome spot to stop for a great cup of coffee! I had the Flat White and it was heavenly.,,,
116,Liz G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,0,3.0,7/7/2017,"Only tried the food. The cheddar biscuit was delicious but the salad was pretty bad. I had a chicken salad and the chicken, aside from being dry, was clearly old (the surface was tough). Seems like it would be a pleasant place to work/read though.",,,
117,Anna D.,,0,1,0,5.0,7/21/2017,"Enjoyable experience. After many years of travelling to New York, I've finally found a place that knows how to make great coffee. Also, try the yumstar breakfast burrito. No disappointment.",,,
