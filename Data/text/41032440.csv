0,Sheila G.,"Seattle, WA",433,52,196,4.0,11/11/2018,"I'm basing this review on two items: the scallops and the sea bass. If I was rating the scallops alone, I'd give them 3 stars.If I was rating the sea bass alone, 5 stars (6 if I could)! All together, my experience at Mercer Kitchen was lovely. Good cocktails (although they up charged me for a change in base alcohol for a cocktail on the menu), great ambiance and wonderful staff. The sea bass was incredible. Definitely a must have! The chocolate cake was also really, really good. I could've done without the scallops, but it was good nonetheless. I'd definitely go back here for the sea bass!",,,
1,Chris B.,"New York, NY",36,11,29,5.0,11/5/2018,"Mercer Kitchen is down the block from my office. Went for the first time, and I will definitely be back. Atmosphere is solid, downstairs from a nice hotel. Everything we got was tasty, prices were reasonable for the area. Recommend the Truffle pizza and Sashimi Salmon to start and Mercer burger for an entree (I think it was better than Minetta Tavern - sorry!).",,,
2,Jessica L.,"Manhattan, NY",208,98,156,2.0,11/2/2018,"Beautiful on the outside but it's meh on the inside. The experience I received from this place left such an impression on me I felt offended. My s/o and I arrived without a reservation and was greeted after 2 minutes by a staff who asked if we wanted to be seated near the front (aka upstairs) since there was a table available. While waiting for our table to be cleaned, a different staff member approached us and asked us ""how many?"", we told him we were already being helped and our table was getting cleaned, and pointed towards the table. With a tone, the staff replied with "" that's not your table, that table is for the couple right here"", however, the couple that was standing in the corner had just come up from downstairs and was getting ready to leave. I said for the second time "" we are being helped and we were told that table was for us"", the staff continued to say "" that's not your table"", until the couple turned to the staff and said "" we're not waiting, we're leaving"" and just so then the staff member who was helping us came up to the staff member and whispered "" they're waiting for this table"". To my s/o and I, we felt offended by the tone of voice the staff used to tell us the table wasn't ours. At least ask the other couple if they're waiting for a table before telling us off. That, overall, was a terrible way to start our night. Then came the food, the food was alright, nothing special about it to be honest. We ordered fish and chips and the truffle pizza. The pizza was mediocre for the price. The only good part was probably the Fish and chips, they were seasoned well and were made just right. Asides from that, I wouldn't come back again.",2,,
3,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",273,84,162,3.0,7/29/2018,"I would give them 3.5 stars. Food - 4 Service - 3 Vibe - 4.5Came here for nyc restaurant week. The location is superb- right in the middle of soho. The vibe of the restaurant is modern, fashionable and cool, so really good for a dinner date or a quick drink.My boyfriend got the octopus and avo salad, burger and chocolate cake. I decided to only get an entree, the hake.The food is good, but nothing spectacular. Just the kind of food you would expect from a somewhat fancy restaurant. My favorite dish is the hake. The fish is soft and full of flavor, and I finished the dish in minutes.My complaint is that the service is quite pushy: just to give an example, while we were still working on the fries, the ice cream and lava chocolate cake dessert was already served... since ice cream and lava cake both have to be eaten immediately, we were forced to give up the fries. I really don't understand while they do it, since there were plenty of empty tables.",,,
4,Peggy W.,"New York, NY",529,185,191,1.0,9/24/2018,"Beautiful restaurant with good atmosphere, but the food is subpar. I've come here for dinner for restaurant week and have come for normal brunch as well. The dinner burger is pretty good, and the fries that come with it are good, but nothing you couldn't get anywhere else. Brunch was very lackluster. The egg white omelette was a complete miss for me. It is quite literally an omelette and a tiny bit of spinach, without anything else like mushrooms, tomatoes, etc. I found the little bit of rosemary potatoes that came with it was completely overpowered by the taste of rosemary. The food barely filled my plate. I had to ask three times for hot sauce before anyone actually gave me any. Complete miss with both the food and the service on two occasions.",1,,
5,Shantel A.,"Bronx, New York, NY",9,23,63,4.0,10/16/2018,I was recently invited by a brand for an influencer dinner at the Mercer kitchen. I've always walked passed the restaurant and never get to eat there and this was my chance. I don't believe I've heard of any bad reviews from Mercer and I know why.I wish I remembered the exact name of certain dishes but i'm sure my photos attached can help decide what to eat when you pay a visit.For appetizers we ordered sashimi sushi. I am not a complete fan of sushi but I don't hate it either. However this was so good ! highlight of all meals.The prosciutto with three cheese pizza was super delicious and the bread was baked to perfection. It was not overly baked. The fish tacos were ok I've definitely had better but I didn't hate them. As far as service the staff was super friendly. Upon arrival I believe there was a mistake with our reservation so they immediately accommodated our large group for a private section.I would definitely come back again either for a date or just a small intimate dinner with friends.,,,

7,Rebecca C.,"Santa Monica, CA",1645,176,1774,5.0,8/24/2018,"I love Mercer Kitchen so much! If I could live in this place I would. I am into absolutely every single thing on the menu. When I was in grad-school I would come here at least once a week and when I come back to visit the city I come at least once. When you get to the restaurant you walk downstairs and they usually seat you within minutes of your reservation, if you read any of my reviews then you know how important service is and this place delivers. Absolute 5 star service and on top of it the food is to die for!I highly recommend you try the salmon sashimi - it's like nothing you've ever tried. It's crispy rice with a little spicy mayo topped with salmon sashimi and it's the best thing you don't need to add anything to it you can just eat it straight. I also love love love the Champagne salad - unfortunately I don't eat shell fish so I get it without shrimp and get salmon instead and it's the so yummy. The pizza's and pastas are out of this world. Honestly everything on the menu is amazing even the vegetables! I highly recommend you try this place out if you're in the area!",5,4,6
8,Peter K.,"New York, NY",76,1077,48,5.0,10/28/2018,"I went to this restaurant years ago and remember it was very good. A little high end, but very good food quality. Located in the heart of Soho.

10,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,5.0,8/15/2018,"Went here with a friend to check out their restaurant week menu on a Wednesday night. We had a reservation for 9, but had to wait about 20 minutes for our table to open up.The sliced bread and olive oil to start was nothing special. The bread isn't your typical french loaf, but was not memorable.As an appetizer, I went with the pizza with fromage blanc--wow was this tasty! The pizza was cooked perfectly and while the onions did not have a lot of flavor, the cartelized bacon was divine.For the second course, I got the pan roasted hake--this was also a very solid dish as the hake was well-cooked and had great flavor. My favorite part of this dish though was actually the chard and peppers mix as they provided the perfect accompaniment to the fish.To finish off the meal, I went with the chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. Though the ice cream was a bit melty and the scoop was small, it paired excellently with the molten chocolate cake that was perfectly oozing with chocolate. It really made for a delicious ending to the dinner.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by all of the courses here after reading mixed reviews online. The service was friendly and the food came out at a good pace. The portion sizes were perfect as they provided enough food, especially for the pizza appetizer, which was rather large. This spot is definitely serving up some great food and is worth checking out for restaurant week.",2,,
11,Janet Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,178,379,1.0,4/16/2018,"I honestly don't know what happened to this place. I use to come here years ago and the food was great. I just came here for brunch with a friend last Sunday and the food was downright disgusting. She ordered the organic omelette (with Goat Cheese, Rosemary Potatoes, Mesclun Salad) and I ordered the Tagliatelle pasta (with Mixed Wild Mushrooms, Jalapeno and Herbs). The omelette looked steamed or boiled, was pretty flavorless with a few pieces of boiled potatoes and a side of salad greens that looks like it was taken directly from a container and placed onto a plate. My pasta was even worst. It was so bland, I added almost the whole side dish of salt (which you have to ask the waiter for). Nope, it didn't help improve the taste. Maybe add some black pepper? Nope, flavorless and tasteless. Asked for parm cheese to sprinkle on top and hoping to god it helps improves the taste. NOPE, I gave up. Seriously, how can anyone mess up on pasta this bad? The tagliatelle itself was bland AF. The herbs? Yeah, what happened to the herbs? Oh and the mixed mushrooms? I found 3 pieces in total. Guess mushroom prices have gone way up? For $26, I felt ripped off. I asked the waiter to pack it up (thinking maybe I can still savage this dish at home) but he decided to clean the other plates while holding my pasta plate and I could see something dripping into it. AHHHH GROSS!!!This experience was cringe worthy for me. From the bland dish to the poor wait staff etiquette. FYI: I did not bring the pasta home, I threw it away at the Prince Station trash bin.",7,1,
12,Samantha L.,"Concord, CA",180,3,0,2.0,10/11/2018,"Everything on the menu looked really good. However, the burger we ordered was under cooked (like rare instead of  medium rare) and the ""seasoning"" on top of our salmon just tasted burnt. I had to pick it off for the salmon to be edible, but once the burnt crust was gone the salmon was very good. Before our meal came we asked what wine paired well with the salmon and the waited asked us if we would like red or white wine. Then he proceeded to just give us information about each wine. Overall when the bill came we were shocked by how expensive it was due to the low food quality. We would not frequent this restaurant again.",1,,
13,Satwinder H.,"Jersey City, NJ",22,30,87,3.0,3/11/2018,"We visited The Mercer Kitchen with friends for a spot of lunch and we came away feeling that this place could be great but there's a few easily addressable items holding it back. Let's start with the venue and service. The space itself is pretty cool. When you get to the restaurant, you pull back a heavy curtain, walk down a flight of stairs and arrive in a dimly lit, chic area and that's when you are hit with a cacophony of sound. This place is loud. If you're hoping for a quiet, intimate lunch, this is not the restaurant for you. This didn't bother our group so much, in fact it created a nice buzz to the place. We were seated very promptly and were asked if were ready to order drinks. We asked for a few minutes and after waiting nearly twenty minutes for our server to come back, we had to wave to get her attention.Now on to the food. We ordered a number of items from the menu:- Rigatoni with meatballs: Unfortunately this was my dish and it came out stone cold and piping hot in places. I sent it back immediately and it was replaced with a new serving. The rigatoni and sauce were good however the meatballs lacked any seasoning- Eggs Benedict: They were nice enough but the portion seemed kind of small compared to other brunch places (see picture)- Fusilli with added shrimp: This got a massive thumbs up from the table. Good portion size, flavorful and promptly scoffed!- Crispy Flounder Tacos: Another win! You only get two tacos, but they are big and filled to the brim. - Side of Sauteed 7 Grains: For 10 bucks, this felt like a tiny portion. Judge for yourself from the picture.Overall, aside from the hiccups, we were satisfied and in some cases delighted with the food. It did feel like once we had finished eating there was a rush to clear our table and give us the bill even though we were still enjoying our drinks and polishing off some fries.",2,,2
14,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,165,4.0,4/1/2018,"Came here on Easter Sunday. Pretty surprised we were able to get a reservation last second, but upon arriving we realized it wasn't very busy at all. I would probably rank this place a 3.5 if allowed, but my entrée was the deciding factor between 3 stars or 4 stars which leads me to my pro/con list....Pros:Truffle oil pizza is to die for !! Honestly, I expected this to be too heavy, but it was perfectly made. It was rich, but not in the type of way that makes you feel sick to your stomach. Pancakes were great as wellAmbiance Great locationCons:When we were seated, I had an obvious dirty glass set out for meOur coffee orders came out wrongService was mediocre if not poorThe brunch menu is lacking (two options only- pancakes or eggs benedict, which aren't original) Overall, I'd probably come back when I am in SoHo, but maybe for dinner and hopefully the service is better.",1,,
15,Ross P.,"New York, NY",39,125,101,5.0,8/7/2018,"I go to Mercer Kitchen often and feel that it is great for drinks with friends and dinner dates. As you walk downstairs to be seated, you are greeted by a lovely view of the kitchen. The restaurant is pretty dark but adds to the intimacy. My go to drinks are the Strawberry Royal or an old fashion. I really enjoy the shrimp salad with its champagne vinaigrette dressing. I typically order the delicious Mercer Kitchen Burger which is a most have in my books. Food and drinks are fairly priced for the area.",,,

18,Lexi E.,"Austin, TX",373,137,41,5.0,1/10/2018,"Intimate, warm two-story restaurant in SoHo.  Feels like a respite from the busy streets with candle-lit tables and soft ambient noise (not too noisy).  The table next to me is having an intimate business meeting about a brewery expansion.  Also pretty romantic feeling because it is so cozy with the dim lighting and comfortable leather chairs. Ordered the (elegant-looking) fennel salad and enjoyed it. Plus, it is Whole 30 friendly if you remove the Parmesan!",1,,1

20,Mila T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,19,7,4.0,7/28/2018,"Really enjoyed my first time at this restaurant. Even though it's currently Restaurant Week in NY, we decided to pass on that menu. Chose appetizers and desserts, everything was absolutely delicious. Decor is more modern industrial, not really my taste but fine. The staff is courteous and efficient, but not overly enthusiastic. I'll definitely return.",,,
21,Nat S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,70,19,3.0,6/17/2018,"It's a bit overrated. I ordered the baked salmon on a bed of mashed potatoes, it was amazing. But my family ordered the waffles and omelette which didn't meet the high expectations I usually have for this restaurant. The waffle had a very strange ""bready"" texture, not like the usual light and fluffy waffles. It was quite dense and an artificial sweet taste. The omelette I felt was portioned too small for the price. The decor and restaurant itself is beautiful, and the seating in the basement is awesome because the kitchen is completely open for the guests to see. Some items are good, some are bad. I'd definitely read a review of the menu items before you order. All in all, an okay place in SoHo.",,,
22,Eduardo C.,"Washington, DC",239,37,111,4.0,5/29/2018,"As an outsider (foreigner and visitor), I always had difficulties to find a very good restaurant in NYC (surprisingly), and I should read more about it. However, the food at Mercer made me happy that I could find something great around. We had:(1) Crispy Squid (3 stars): Standard fried squids. (2) Sashimi Salmon (4 stars): I really enjoyed this appetizer. The crispy Sushi Rice is a really interesting approach. (3) Rigatoni (4.5 stars): I always found so difficult to find a good pasta place in U.S. So, this dish impressed me! The pasta was well done, the meatballs were delicious, and right amount of spice.I heard that the truffle oil pizza is amazing, I want to come back and try!The cons were the service. The waiter was very slow and messed up with our rosé (our bottle did not finish, we told it was over, but we were sure it was not. And then he figured it out that he had the wrong bottle). I would come back for sure. I really enjoy the pasta and appetizers. My actual rating is 3.5.",1,,
23,Hamza J.,"New York, NY",9,50,53,4.0,6/8/2018,Came here with my uncle and aunt. We got a table reservation for 4 at 5:30. We ordered-Salmon sushi with sticky rice: 3/5. It needed wasabi and had too much soy sauce. Probably wouldn't order again Black Sea bass carpaccio: 4.2/5. Probably the best dish of the night. Comes with warm bread. Would recommend Truffle pizza: 3.5/5.  Not such a truffle fan but this was really good Black Sea bass: 3.8/5. This was pretty good. The portion was a bit small The warm chocolate cake was also really good.,,1,

But the food come on, hot dogs with $1 wonder bread bun, oh sorry the sausage is grass fed meat. I'll rather spend my money elsewhere. Seriously invest money on your recipes and hiring a better chef. Very disappointing Please look at this $15 personal size pizza... I think school pizza or the $1.50 slice of pizza on the street is better than this..  oh and that's how much cheese it had",,,
25,Nikki R.,"Manhattan, NY",400,152,126,3.0,5/29/2018,"Not bad by any means, but nothing particularly special for the price. The atmosphere is fun, it's an underground room decorated well, which gives it a cool vibe, and I was able to come here for brunch on a fairly quiet day. My friend and I both ordered a drink, which was tasty but nothing special; some healthy-ish bowls, which had good flavor but were small; and oysters, which were good if a bit pricey for brunch.Overall, can't say I recommend that strongly, but I wouldn't be against going back if a friend were insistent.",,,

30,Jocelyn B.,"New York, NY",7,126,58,3.0,3/12/2018,"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. Service was pretty mediocre. It took around ten minutes just to have our coffee and tea brought out. Once our food came out it took the waitress probably another ten minutes to come check on it. The man refilling water noticed our frustration and brought us the condiments we needed, but it should have been the waitress doing so!In terms of food, everything was just fine. Nothing to write home about. Know that if you order the French toast it definitely needs to be eaten with syrup or butter, otherwise it is dry. The omelette with guyere and spinach is good but quite small, and the serving size of potatoes is small as well. The mesclun lettuce side truly looked like the chef stuck his or her hand in a bag of lettuce and just threw it into a dish. Probably won't be back-- nothing was bad, but there are definitely better places to go on the neighborhood.",1,,

We reserved a few weeks in advance for my friends engagement and Mercer went above and beyond. Firstly, we started out as a small group that quickly grew. Mercer was super accommodating. Also, the customized menus and private space at the lower level was truly what makes Mercer a special and truly one-of-kind spot! Glad we spent such a special engagement dinner at this place. ALL of our appetizers, meals and even the bubbly was amazing! Mercer is really ALL that and some more! You truly won't be disappointed!",,,
32,Vaannila A.,"Louisville, KY",190,14,0,3.0,7/20/2018,"I came to this place for my friend's 21st birthday, and in summary, I think it was an OK place for a nice dinner with friends. I didn't have a bad experience, but there was nothing particularly special about the restaurant.I had the rigatoni with meatballs, and for an appetizer we had the watermelon. The watermelon was just standard with goat cheese, nothing special. The rigatoni was very dense and chewy, but it was very filling. I found that the restaurant was a little overpriced, considering there was nothing particularly unique about the food. We were seated in the basement area which had a particularly nice ambiance. There was low lighting, and it looked very modern and urban. The servers were very attentive and kind, and I felt we were taken care of very well. The one thing about the basement was that it was very crowded (we went at 8:30 on a thursday night). It was difficult to move around, and our table was seated right behind another table so we could hardly get out of our seats without ramming into the people behind us.",,1,
33,Sara H.,"Fort Lee, NJ",279,60,92,2.0,7/19/2018,"A good friend of mine always wanting to take me here because she told me their dishes are amazingly tasty. So, we decided to go on a nice weekday evening. I really liked their ambiance and interior design especially how you can see people walking the street above! The overall atmosphere of the place is moody and romantic but I personally thought it was bit small to move around. My friend suggested we get two of their shrimp salad because it is apparently the best salad she had in her life so we decided to do so as well as a burger to share with. When the waiter put down our salad, I didn't think the salad was worth $25 especially when the salad was an appetizer. I didn't think the greens look fresh enough; I had better and fresh greens. The dressing was pretty made by a ""famous chef"" as my friend said. Even though the dressing was tasty, I still didn't think it was worth $25. I honestly think the price is overrated for its lack of flavor, uniqueness and quality. I didn't find anything special about the place itself, service or the food. I had experiences with food, service and atmosphere. With three girls and having three dishes to share (two appetizer and one main), each of us spent $43 with tip. It was not worth $43.

35,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4420,4415,35720,4.0,6/18/2017,"I was surprised to discover after dining here that this was part of Michelin-star chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's culinary dynasty because by sheer coincidence, Jamie W. and I had just dined at Jean-Georges the day before (review: bit.ly/2rte9Z5). Now before you start rumors about me being so fancy schmancy, I have to admit I selected this place for an after-show dinner because they had a menu that appeared in tune with the dietary restrictions we were putting ourselves through in order to get healthier. In fact, we walked all the way from the Palace Theater in the heart of Times Square to this central SoHo location, so we could amp up our FitBit steps. When we approached among the stylish warehouse storefronts on Prince Street, we noticed there was no prominent signage, just some subtle lettering on the window that said this must be the place (photo: bit.ly/2sHcYtt). It appeared to be split into two levels as we saw the bar and what looked to be a private dining area when we entered the premises. I figured out that we needed to go downstairs to see the expressionless hostess about our reservation. Unlike Jean-Georges, it was dark industrial-chic with very low-level lighting and brick walls illuminated by floor lights (photo: bit.ly/2rEPS6w). An expansive dining room and a more casual bar took up the space downstairs.We were unfortunately seated next to a loud Italian family who looked like they were eating at home with a lot of broad hand gestures and sharp-tongued Italian shouting. We started by sharing the $16 Organic Shaved Fennel Salad with Arugula, Shaved Parmesan, and Mushroom (photo: bit.ly/2seQZsg). I believe there was just a light lemon vinaigrette coated on it, and it was just what we wanted. We also ordered the $10 Steamed Vegetables, which were mainly zucchini and yellow squash slices with baby carrots but again just what we wanted to have to eat right (photo: bit.ly/2sf6pwu). Our entrees came next, and we both went with fish.Jamie ordered the $30 Slowly Baked Salmon, a good-size filet sitting on top of Mashed Potatoes, Sugar Snap Peas, Fresh Dill, and Mixed Greens and drizzled with Black Truffle Vinaigrette (photo: bit.ly/2tBI4z5). It was genuinely flavorful with the salmon particularly moist and tender with a slight crust. I had the $26 Steamed Hake beautifully presented with Tarragon, Sesame Seeds, and Green and Yellow Wax Beans (photo: bit.ly/2tBRAlP). There was a bit of rice and a soy-like sauce, both of which enhanced the flavor considerably. Other than the loud Italians and the glum staff, we enjoyed the dining experience here. Merci encore, Jean-Georges.FOOD - 4 stars...Jean-Georges strikes again, not quite as unique but genuinely satisfyingAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...so SoHo, so rustically chicSERVICE - 3 stars...efficient but unsmiling, coolishTOTAL - 4 stars...stylish surroundings for such healthy eats",11,7,13
36,Sam E.,"Queens, NY",140,119,296,4.0,2/13/2018,"Went here for restaurant week with a friend and i thought it was a really solid meal. We started with the bacon and onion pizza which was, as expected, delicious and a great start to the meal. I got roasted peppers with ricotta which was solid but nothing particularly memorable. For my main dish I got the shrimp which came with interesting potato-like Jerusalem artichokes and my friend got the fussili pasta with Brussel sprouts. Both had lots of flavor and were well portioned. Last but not least was dessert which was surprisingly our favorite parts of the meal. I got the chocolate lava cake with caramel ice cream and she got the apple crisp a la mode. Both were seriously unbelievable, perfectly prepared and the quintessential versions of each dessert.

Entrees aren't large so you'll need to order some starters. Would definitely recommend the truffle pizza, burrata and seafood platter if you're feeling fancy. Forgo the tuna spring roll; it was bland in my opinion.",,,
40,Edward L.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,1.0,9/30/2018,"Worst service for any Jean George restaurant. They treat you extremely poorly with nasty attitude as if this were a bottle club.  We have never gotten a decent reception even when we have a reservation. The restaurant can be half empty and some pretty but scatter-brained hostess will make you wait for no apparent attitude and will not give you an explanation except to say that all the empty tables are ""reserved.""  Avoid this pretentious place at all costs.",,,

I got here 10 min early to scope out a spot for us. I was directed to the bar downstairs. It's perfect. Great bartender. Very friendly. I asked about an empty table near the bar area that would give us room to open our laptops and talk business. The hostess told me, no, I'm sorry that section is closed and you can't sit at a table unless you order food. Wow. I'm shocked that place like this would refuse me service for a business meeting for 2 people at a small table when there are 10-15 tables open. Do they realize I might be here often and planning events, etc.?  I'm very disappointed in the service. I'm including a photo of the place I asked to be seated.",4,,
44,Justin I.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,35,0,3.0,9/27/2018,Decent service. I liked the waiter but wasn't payed enough attention. Water got refilled once in the two hours. Food wasn't nearly as good as the price may suggest. Basically I'd spend my money else where.,,,

49,Ken C.,"New York, NY",0,29,405,4.0,6/14/2018,"We were very satisfied with all the food we ordered.  All tastes good ! The reason why I don't give 5 stars because of the service.  The waiter seems lack of patience and passion.  The problem is not just on the waiter who took our order.  Same problem is also on other waiters who clean up the table too.  They cleaned up the plates in rush and took the french fries basket away while it was still half full and I was still eating. If they have already done their best on customer service, it would be management problem and I don't blame on the waiters.  The food is good and I hope they can pay more attention on customer service.",,,
50,Katie G.,"Manhattan, NY",61,11,0,2.0,6/17/2018,"Not impressed - terrible service. I came here on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend for the first time. We were seated immediately and then sat at the table without menus or being greeted for five minutes. Once the server came by, we gave her our entire order. She proceeded to come back after taking our order to say that the appetizer we wanted was sold out and then came back again a few minutes later to clarify whether I wanted a sea bass carpaccio appetizer for my main course  or the roasted black cod entree. A side of mashed potatoes somehow never made it to the table - not sure if the kitchen lost it or if it was never ordered. We did not receive bread when we arrived even though all the tables around us did. As our table was being cleared, we asked the back-waiter and he confirmed all tables should receive bread when they arrive at the table. When the check was dropped, we were given the wrong check with someone else's already charged credit card. All around not a good experience. The food was excellent but service was pretty terrible.",,,
51,Lindsey R.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",159,234,555,2.0,8/18/2017,Cool atmosphere but the food and drinks are not worth the price. Drinks are $14 and up. They all sounded great but I want to taste a bit of alcohol especially when spending that much. I met up with coworkers for the burgers on the restaurant week menu. It changed so we ordered off the menu. Burgers are $24 and were good but not the best and not worth the price. We also shared a margarita pizza but it was just OK. I had such high expectations but was disappointed.,3,1,1
52,Daniela G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,122,388,3.0,2/25/2017,"Came here for dinner. You need reservations. We were lucky to be there late (9.45 pm) so we got a table with no res.Got a bottle of wine and they brought us small glasses (more for dessert wine). We asked and apparently they were out of normal wine glasses, but finally got us more or less normal ones. I wouldn't normally complain, but we go out for dinner and expect to enjoy the wine. Otherwise I would have wine somewhere else.Food was outstanding. We got the following for 2 people:Cured Meats And Local Cheeses ($18): three cured meets and three types of cheeses, with bread, honey, honey mustard, pickles and pecans. Really good to start with red wineTuna Spring Roll soy bean puree ($21): cut like sushi pieces, small portion, but the green sauce is delishCarpaccio Of Black Sea Bass with lime, coriander and mint ($16): Thin slice, but very tasty. Just expect a very small plate. Comes with warm fresh bread to make up for that.Shaved Fennel Salad With Arugula parmesan and mushroom ($16): loved this refreshing saladCrab cake with avocado: comes with a gingery juice that is delish!Pear tart: really great, not too heavy/sweet, a light dessert. Comes with gelato, can't remember if it was peanut or sesame or something unexpected like thatOverall, lovely place for dinner. Service was good and plates were well finished. Would have been 4 stars if it was not for the wine glass. Didn't expect that from a Jean-George place.",2,1,
53,Stacey F.,"Brooklyn, NY",298,232,97,1.0,8/8/2017,"Literally the worst customer service I have experienced in a hot minute. Food took forever (we had to ask where our entrees were an hour after ordering and 30 minutes after finishing apps...). We were told ""they are being plated."" 5 minutes later, when we asked for a manager, the manager said that the grilled chicken was taking a long time to cook and it would be out soon, no apologies. When the food finally came out, everything was cold. It was clear that they had lied to us and I'm not entirely sure why the food did take so long...And to top it all off, the food was definitely not good enough to make up for the poor customer service. This is one place I will not be returning to, and I do not feel an ounce bad leaving this one star review.",10,3,
54,Kena G.,"San Diego, CA",1,34,1,1.0,10/27/2018,"DO NOT GO!! Nightmare in every way!  We traveled from San Diego to NYC  for my birthday, and unfortunately chose Mercer Kitchen for the big event. What a mistake!1) We waited 20 minutes to place a drink order, after being intentionally skipped multiple times by the bartender. 2) The staff dropped the ball on the ""birthday"" - despite being reminded twice.3)  My credit card was not returned with my check. 4)  But the real kicker - THEY GAVE MY CHECKED BAGS AWAY!!! Yes - they checked in my bags, then gave them to someone else, then acted like I should be grateful they knew who they gave them to and I should be grateful they planned to get them back. The manager on duty was an absolute jerk - and I use that term only because others would not be posted. She should have been fired for her rudeness and handling of this issue. For over a month they gave me the run-around about someone had them, oh sorry he flew to Europe - and he will be back - oh he put them in a taxi and we can't find them.  I call BS on the entire story.They promised to make it right. Mind you these were purchases my daughter made as my birthday presents - so how could that even happen? A full month later, I get a check - for the exact amount of the receipts they demanded I submit. Not a dime for my jacket that was in the bag. Not a dime for being honest and not up-charging them for other purchases made the same day. Not a dime for - hey we treated you terribly, ruined your birthday dinner, lost your birthday presents, and told you a tall tale for weeks on end - and we want you to have this to make it up.  Nope. Nothing. A check - no note, and a whopping $258.36 refund of the purchases, 30 days later.There are so many fabulous places in NYC - go to any one of them - but don't go here.

Friendly and attentive waitstaff as well.I tried the salad with truffle dressing, bacon pizza appetizer, the Mercer burger, the mushroom pasta, and the molten chocolate lava cake for dessert. Standouts were the pizza and the burger, hands down. Trust Jean Georges to take fast food into gourmet food. The burger was amazing with fried onions and this delicious sauce. French fries were perfect. Somehow I still scarfed down the chocolate cake despite being incredibly full. The ice cream served on the side of the cake was amazing too.All in all, great evening here, and the location is on point. Will definitely be back.",2,1,1

60,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,3.0,12/26/2016,"Located in the heart of SoHo is one of Jean Georges Vongerichten's often overlooked restaurants: Mercer Kitchen. Housed in the basement level of Mercer Hotel, it's a ever-busy venue that caters both to hotel guests as well as the substantial nightlife crowd. The venue is chic and modern, offering a functional bar area and several communal tables, in addition to plenty of two-tops that are smartly arranged across the room, making it ideal for a number of group sizes and occasions. I came to get a late dinner with a friend one evening, and was grateful upon entering that I had made a reservation in advance; nearly every seat at the bar and chair in the dining room table was occupied.The menu here is more traditionally ""American"" than you would find at some of JGV's other restaurants. I have to admit that I missed seeing some of the more Asian-influenced dishes, but we were easily able to make our choices across several categories. If possible, I would recommend ordering the signature Salmon Sashimi, which takes six pieces of fresh salmon and layers them over rectangular blocks of crispy sushi rice. The additional texture and crunch in the pressed rice works surprisingly well in each bite, and the layering of a spicy mayo and ponzu round out the flavors.As for the mains, I couldn't help but order the Mercer Kitchen Burger, which takes a griddled beef patty and tops it with pepperjack cheese, sliced avocado, red onions, and a sweet-savory Russian dressing. It's sandwiched between two brioche bun halves and served with a generous side of french fries. I was a little disappointed to find that it had been cooked past my requested medium rare, but the beef had been well seasoned and the additional components worked to make for a satisfactory bite. And for dessert? JGV's classic Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake won't disappoint, and even for somene like myself who doesn't enjoy chocolate most of the time, I couldn't help but delight in how deliciously the warm, melted interior of the cake paired with the scoop of cold vanilla ice cream.There are, unfortunately, a few downfalls we experienced at this restaurant. We waited upwards of half an hour between our appetizer and main courses, and our server wasn't the most attentive in keeping us informed of the status in the kitchen. The fact that the venue is entirely underground and is usually packed also makes the average volume in here quite high; you may struggle like we did to have a coherent conversation. And, yes, given the location and clientele that the restaurant caters too, prices are on the higher end of the spectrum, so come prepared to do a little damage to your wallet.At the end of the day, Mercer Kitchen didn't disappoint per se, but neither did it offer much incentive for us to return. If you're in the area and in need of a more upscale venue to visit, it will certainly fit the bill - but for me, one visit is sufficient.",5,3,3
61,FU F.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,313,2751,4.0,2/24/2018,"Its unbelievable after decades Mercer kitchen is still on top of their game. Hostess wasn't the friendliest but wait staff made it up.

You can still have a normal volume conversation at your table. We ordered a 2 appetizers, the lamb chops, pork chop, mac & cheese, cheesecake and raspberry tart. The flavors on everything was spot on. The meats on the entrees were cooked perfectly. Very tasty and worth going back for another meal. It was actually my belated birthday dinner, but neither my friend or I told the restaurant. They must have overheard us and brought my dessert over with a candle... and they comped it, too. My friend and I were very confused wondering who's birthday it was haha!  It was a very nice touch and made for a memorable birthday dinner.",,,
63,Lili E.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",0,3,0,2.0,10/21/2018,I went to mercer kitchen for brunch with high expectations and it was a very disappointing experience. I've been before and the food is usually good but after today I can't say I'll be back. We waited almost 20 minutes for coffee and almost an hour for our food while two tables around us were seated and fed before us. The portions were tiny and unreasonably so especially for the prices charged. They comped two coffees at the end which was a nice gesture but for those prices it's just not worth it.,,,
64,Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",130,518,505,4.0,2/18/2017,"Had a wonderful belated Valentine's Day dinner here. It's very cool how the vibes are so different between the up and down stairs. It's more classy, family friendly upstairs with a nice library area in the back. The downstairs is livelier and trendy. We ended up sitting upstairs which was nice and quiet for conversation. We started with the clams for an appetizer, which were nice and fresh. It came with the usual sauces as well as a cute little bottle of Tabasco! I got the skate with green beans and rice. I was pleasantly surprised by the dish. The fish had a nice buttery taste with a good sauce and seasame seeds that added an extra level of flavor. My boyfriend got the burger with fries which he enjoyed. We also got a side of mac and cheese (mistakenly, had asked for the mashed potatoes) and brussel sprouts. The sprouts I really liked and it was presented with just pieces of the leaves so it was super soft. The mac and cheese wasn't bad but definitely don't order it. There's nothing special about it and could have been improved with more cheese!Still, great experience and a lovely date with the boo",,,

Dinner tasted good and our wine selection was on par, but when it came to dessert time, I was horrified and shocked by the fact that a STANDARD cappuccino was $7 and the hot chocolate was $8. I was not going to bring the issue up initially, but the waiter could tell I was shocked and asked me if there was an issue. I was going to say something, but he literally walked away mid sentence, completely ignoring me. I have never seen such a horrid reaction customer service wise. I live in the city and have never seen a coffee beverage cost that much. Even those trendy places that emblazon cappuccino foam with unicorn designs and Beyoncé's face cost less than that. Liquid gold better be in that coffee. Chef Jean-Georges' tears and sweat better be the full bodied foam on that coffee. The hot chocolate better be overnighted and imported from Europe.",2,1,

The saffron might have been some of the best on the market because was very flavorful.The peas were hard and under cooked and the fish itself was over cooked. My friend's branzino was absolutely spectacular.The place is fancy but still approachable with a nice vibe about it.If it was for the halibut alone I would give 3 stars but overall the place deserves a 4 for my experience.,1,1,1

71,Chloe C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,4,2.0,10/7/2018,"This place is all hype. I repeat, this place is ALL HYPE. People come here to be seen, not to eat good food. Ordered the lamb medium rare - came almost well done and was not served hot. It was also not evenly sauced, leaving me on a rollercoaster ride of unseasoned meat to hot sauce burning my tongue. My friend ordered the burger which she didn't even have the will to finish. The wine was disappointing, incredibly young and underdeveloped at $76 a bottle. Not a good selection for mid-range reds, and in general for the wines. Didn't order dessert because at that point I half-expected it to come from the frozen aisle of a supermarket. The extra star is purely for the interior design of this place - I love the aesthetic, but everything else was so incredibly disappointing. The service wasn't terrible but very cold-handed. The final nail was that I was handed the check while we were still finishing up... incredibly rude - for me it's the difference between a 25% and 20% tip. I left unsatisfied in every way and I hope to save some foodies the bad experience, or anyone who actually wants to get what they pay. I was expecting good things because of its reputation, but I highly suggest going across the street to Lure instead.",,,

It was my first time here with a party of 3, and we were awkwardly seated at a table that was meant for 2. My poor friend sat uncomfortably on a chair that was way too high for the table.We ordered the burger which was phenomenal. The pizza that was tasty. And fish and chips that was perfectly breaded.

Ambience is great - dark and moody with an urban upscale appeal. Food was delicious but overpriced (hence the 4 stars). We eat at expensive restaurants all the time in Laguna Beach where we're from and still found this a bit pricey. We had 2 appetizers (baked olives and shrimp cocktail which were pretty good), 2 entrees (my husband had a great steak but not the best he's ever had and it was $55, I had a $50 lobster tail which was succulent but not a very big portion and I had to request melted butter, and my daughter just had an artichoke and mashed potatoes). My side of steamed vegetables was literally just steamed - no seasoning or butter which was surprising. Our waitress was ok but definitely wouldn't describe her as friendly. Plus she put my half bottle of wine 4 tables away for some reason (even though there was room at our table for it) and my husband had to go looking for it to refill my glass. Weird.

The atmosphere is very modern industrial and the lighting is dim but not too dim. The service staff was all amazing and super attentive. We were recommended the steamed shrimp salad as an appetizer and it was amazing! The organic roasted chicken was also very very flavorful. The cod was cooked well but in terms of flavor was bland.

I cannot comment on dinner, as I merely came here for brunch, however being a Jean Georges restaurant, I'm sure it fares quite nicely regardless of when you come. The restaurant is located on the corner of Mercer Street, right in the heart of Soho - can't beat it. The inside is just as nice, as any Jean Georges restaurant will be! However, as a result, the prices are surely on the higher end. I had the Mercer burger ($24) which was solid, although I have had better for cheaper. The rest of the menu looked quite good as well, and perhaps even better at dinner. You pay a premium to eat at a Jean Georges establishment, especially in Soho but between the food, service and location - you really can't go wrong.",,,

For dinner I had this coconut soup that absolutely blew my mind. Cannot find it on their menu anymore and I'm sad about that. I remember having the first spoonful and my eyes growing big. Not kidding. For the soup alone I give it 4 stars. The interior is fabulous, it's just annoying to eat upstairs and by the door. (Especially if you do in the winter like I did. You'll freeze your ass off) If you dine downstairs it may be better. (That's if you don't mind it being VERY dark) I was also impressed by those bathrooms...

Granted, I wasn't footing the bill, and I probably would not be back unless it was for a special occasion, but the service, the food, and ambience was all a delight. We were seated in the basement, which I loved, and the staff was amazing and quite accommodating. Usually in ""tres chic"" places I feel overweight and underdressed. But here, I felt completely comfortable. No snobby waiters anywhere! Highlights of the meal were the truffle pizza, the raw tuna, the shrimp cocktail, shrimp salad, french fries, and coffee with homemade madeleines. Yum! Definitely not your typical overrated, overpriced hotel restaurant. An excellent meal for anyone looking for a sexy place to take a date, or to just enjoy a fun, fancy night out in SoHo.",2,,

I had the scallop entree and the molten chocolate cake fordessert. Oh. My. God. Delicious. And the service was fantastic. Oh! And I forgot...I asked the bartender to make me a mock tail. I had a lime ginger thing. Sooooo good!!!! Love this place. I don't understand why it has 3.5 stars. It should have five. It's so delicious. Also, as a side note, if you're someone like me who likes dressing up for dinner, you can absolutely walk in with a Marc Jacobs runway gown and fit right in.",,,
82,Marina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,354,892,4.0,7/20/2016,"Mercer Kitchen is another one of those Soho haunts where you go to see and be seen. Thankfully, the food is pretty awesome too, and it's a great spot to impress a date with a fancy dinner. While the upstairs is more bar-oriented, downstairs is super chic, with low lighting, candles, and a modern rustic decor.I've only ever been here late nights when the restaurant is nearly empty, but this has never detracted from our food or service. We always start with the tuna spring roll, which is lightly seared tuna in an eggroll wrapper, served with a really delicious soybean puree. It also comes with a super spicy sauce with a wasabi kick, which I avoid every time.For mains, the salmon with corn pudding and cherry tomatoes in a light vinaigrette was especially tasty. It's a smallish portion, but super rich and perfectly cooked to medium. I've also had the steamed skate with sushi rice and broccoli, and while I didn't enjoy it as much as the salmon, it's a good light option.I've never had dessert, but they have plenty of great drinks, including a really refreshing cucumber martini. The service is also always fantastic, albeit very formal. I'd definitely come back again for a special occasion, but they do participate in NYC's Restaurant Week if you want a 3 course meal without destroying your wallet!",2,1,2

I really enjoyed the urban vibe and spacious downstairs basement of the the restaurant. We arrived around 12:45pm and I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant wasn't insanely crowded, as Mercer Kitchen is a popular spot. We started with the burrata. Absolutely amazing! I loved every bite of it. My brother enjoyed the turkey burger. I tried a few of his french fries and they were absolutely delicious. I had the kale salad with chicken, which was a very generous portion. Perfect for lunch!

The service started off great, but then our server disappeared and didn't stop by to ask us for coffee/dessert for like 1/2 hour. We had to tell him. This place gets crowded. Excellent food.

87,Crystal P.,"Mineola, NY",518,753,1166,5.0,3/5/2017,"Last year I wanted to come here for breakfast but we were all the way in midtown so we didn't. Finally this year in the area we walked right over this morning for breakfast. Goat cheese in an omelette is one of my favorite dishes so of course I had to get that. I also love a good hot chocolate and they definitely had it here. My hubs loved his pancakes, and this place is just gorgeous. My hubs also said the downstairs part looked amazing and loved the bathroom so there is also that. Only thing which wasn't that bad is you walk in and it's sort of confusing like um hello? No one there and you sort of wonder if you're supposed to go downstairs or just stand there. (you wait there) Another couple actually left because no one came over and they saw us also just standing there, and they were like ""yeah forget this"" but whatever we understood it was busy, they obviously didn't lol.",2,1,4
88,Lydia B.,"Wayne, PA",220,240,867,5.0,3/6/2018,"I was really impressed with our delicious lunch at Mercer kitchen. We arrived after mid day and waited 25 minutes for a table. The restaurant was hustling and bustling. The dining room we ate in was underground and the window on the ceiling had a few grates where you could see people walking above. I had the delicious lamb sandwich on lightly toasted thin bread that was not overwhelming.  The others at my table had the Burger and a great looking chicken sandwich. Each of us had a different cut of french fry with our sandwiches. One standard yet yummy, One came in a crisp house cut potato chip, and one in a crispy yummy waffle cut. We loved the variety and our server brought us a chipotle mayo for dipping that was so delicious. If everyone orders a different sandwich I recommend getting different types of potatoes like this.  There were other delicious items on the menu and people around us were nibbling on wonderful looking artichokes. We saw some other appetizers like tuna over crispy rice that also looked appetizing. I will absolutely go back to Mercer kitchen the next time I'm in NYC. FYI Mercer kitchen is right near the Angelika theater, so lunch and a movie might be a fantastic option. Plan accordingly.",2,,2
89,Mary C.,"Manhattan, NY",157,275,591,3.0,3/5/2017,"One of the more ""meh"" Jean-Georges restaurants for sure. Located in the heart of SoHo, the restaurant is always packed -- especially during brunch times. I've been here for brunch twice and dinner once, and I think the service for dinner is much better because the waiters aren't trying to serve 100 people mimosas and eggs.The Mercer Kitchen is trendy and casual, but it lacks the finesse found in other Jean-Georges restaurants. The salmon I ordered was too buttery, and the staff isn't as coordinated.I don't have too many complaints for dinner but brunch time is always a mess. I understand that brunch is difficult to juggle, but you end up waiting an hour for small slabs of avocado on not toasted bread that costs $23. When I for an hour and that was what received, I was very disappointed. There is nothing too innovative about the menu either.Mercer Kitchen will continue to thrive despite its mediocrity, but I think I'm going to pass next time.",2,,2
90,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,185,527,2.0,2/18/2017,"Where do I begin? I came here with my boyfriend, my boyfriend's friend and my cousin for a friday night dinner and we were all disappointed by the service and lack of operational efficiency. Despite attempts by management to fix their mistakes, they never really made up for all the mess they created.On the plus side and the only reason it's getting 2 stars, the food is actually very good. Everything we ordered was well executed, so at least the chef is doing something right.We had an 8:30 reservation and we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. Everyone was apologetic about the wait and when we finally sat down, a few minutes later someone brought us a pizza with compliments. When we got our bill at the end of the night, we saw that the first thing on the bill was the pizza, I mean seriously? We didn't even order the pizza and it came out on the house and you're going to charge us for it after everything else that went wrong?It took 30 minutes for our drinks to come after we had complained, and they didn't come until we were done with our appetizers. We ordered our second round of drinks shortly thereafter so we'd at least have them for our main courses. Well it still took about 15 minutes for our drinks to come out again.For appetizers, we ordered the sea bass carpaccio, salmon on crispy rice, tuna spring roll and burrata. We told the server that my boyfriend has a gluten allergy (celiac) and he said everything except the spring roll was gluten free. Great! Well, not so great. The salmon crispy rice comes out and there's definitely some sort of soy on it.At this point a manager has gotten involved and he apologizes and notes that the salmon is not gluten free. Not a big deal, but would've been nice to know. We specifically tell him, okay at this point we're not sure what is gluten free and we flagged that my boyfriend had ordered the lamb for his entree so to make sure that it comes out gluten free. He also says that they have gluten free bread he'll send out for us. Well that's nice, it would've been nice to have known and have had the server offer it to us at the beginning. Well when we got the bill, there was a $2 charge for bread sticks on our bill. Seriously? First of all gluten free bread is not breadsticks, and secondly if you are going to charge us for gluten free bread, don't offer it like it's free.For our main courses, my cousin and I shared the burger because we weren't that hungry anymore, and my boyfriend and his friend ordered the lobster. About 10 minutes after we ordered the mains, the server came back and said that they were out of lobster. It was 9:30 on a Friday night.When the main courses came out, they didn't have silverware on the table, and we had to ask for it. The lamb came with a side of what looked like deep fried onions and they had told us previously that they don't have a separate fryer. We flagged the manager down again and he said I am 90% sure these are gluten free, and he also had the nerve to tell us that it turned out the salmon was gluten free because the chef had used gluten free soy/ponzu sauce and a different wrapper for the rice. Hmm, why should we believe you? Do you want to know why we don't believe you? Because when we ask you to be 100% sure that the onions were gluten free, you said you'd confirm and come back to us. Well the manager comes back and abashedly notes that he can't guarantee they're gluten free and takes them away.At this point the manger acknowledges that things have been a disaster and ""wants to make things right."" So we are offered free dessert and again they forgot silverware until we asked for it. But at least this time the dessert was gluten free, and whatever the butterscotch dessert is, is heavenly.My boyfriend was in the bathroom when the desserts came out and the manager asked in a tone that indicated the items we would request would be on the house, ""is there anything else I can offer for you coffee, tea, after dinner drinks."" We asked for another butterscotch dessert. When they brought out the bill, the dessert was on there!Right before we asked for the bill, the manager once again offers if he could do anything else for us. So, with his insistence, we ordered 2 espressos and a shot of patron. You guessed it, these were on the bill too! They ultimately corrected the bill, and so we paid, but then when we looked at the bill closer right before we left, we realized that they over charged us by a drink and none of the drinks that were on there were ones we actually ordered. Since we assume the price of drinks are all about the same, this probably was only a $10 over charge, but on top of everything else that went wrong it was the icing on the cake.Management needs to get their act together. The food is good, but that's about it. If they try to make things right for a customer, don't end up charging them for the items at the end of the night. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back.",5,5,3

I actually came here for restaurant week, but of course wasn't interested in anything on the restaurant week menu so i ordered off the main menu. The waiter was rude, and was clearly rushing my girlfriends and I through our meal so we purposely kept ordering wine to prolong our visit. To start, I ordered the burrata with heirloom tomatoes. This is what saved this place for me - it was so good! I love a good burrata. As my main, I ordered salmon. The salmon was good but it was a little bland for the price.

94,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",773,173,56,1.0,2/5/2017,"My experience at Mercer Kitchen was extremely disappointing, poorly handled, and quite frankly significantly below what I expected from a Jean-Georges establishment. Despite having emailed management with my complaints over a week ago, I still have not received a response.I made a reservation at Mercer Kitchen with the intention of enjoying the restaurant week Sunday dinner menu. Given that both the website and the official NYC restaurant week website assured us that Sunday dinner was offered, my friend and I fully expected to receive the restaurant week menu when we were led to our table. However, the restaurant week menu was not available. The waitress informed us that the website was incorrect, and that restaurant week was not offered on Sunday. Although we showed her the website which clearly indicated otherwise, she insisted that there was no restaurant week menu and that we were confusing The Mercer Kitchen downtown with the ones midtown and uptown. The website clearly indicated that it was the downtown Mercer Kitchen (i.e. the one we were at); however, we let it go. After we paid for our meal, we mentioned to the hostess on our way out that the website was incorrect, as we wanted to make sure the misinformation would be corrected in the best interest of future diners. At that point, the hostess said that the restaurant week menu actually was available, and there had been a mistake in the kitchen earlier. Apparently the kitchen believed they did not have the ingredients for restaurant week available. The hostess had just finished printing off the restaurant week menus that would be available from that point onward. Naturally, we were quite disappointed, given that we had come expressly for the restaurant week menu. The revelation indicated to us that our waitress was not providing us with the full information (i.e. that the kitchen had a mix-up), and furthermore we had to pay more for a lesser meal than we had been planning to that night. Although the hostess apologized, she did not offer to seek her manager and generally was not very courteous toward our complaint. My friend and I left the restaurant feeling misinformed and mistreated.",4,,1

The restrooms are located on the same level to the right of the dining section closest to the kitchen. There are no walls but I believe a glass or some furniture sectioned off the restaurant in two (2).

A few steps above decent and trendier fare that is more gastropub-like than creative.Main points you should know:1. Reservations are def necessary. The wait and crowd can be too overwhelming.2. The downstair vibes are better than the upstairs. Downstairs = trendy NYC restaurant. Upstairs = typical (more) upscale restaurant vibe with white linen.3. Plates are more shareable. No matter what you order, it's pretty easy (and recommended) to share. Portion size is moderate.4. It's a good deal if you're dining with a group of 4 to 6. You can get a lot of food and variety for a relatively fair price.5. Don't have high creativity expectations. It's pretty good for what the dish stands for.

If the food wasn't good, this would have been a 1 Star. To have to basically beg for the menu is crazy! And then waiting on someone to fill up our water for twenty minutes. Given that there were at least 3 other waiters that walked by our table and 7 bar backs, there should be no excuse to have to wait any longer than 5 minutes for water.

Asked for 1 egg and got 2. Cool! Asked for toast and got I un-toasted break. Asked for a coffee 3 times.

We cancelled the bacon but they brought it out anyway after we had finished the meal. 4) To have excellent chef's come out of this establishment and to have subpar food was shocking.

My glass smelled like old soapy rag. Too. Another 25 min to get two omelets, two egg omelet (not 3 egg) with just lettuce on the side with awful lemon so sour dressing - they squeezed a lemon on lettuce (greens) as if, it were dressing. And count them 8 small potato (homefries). That waa brunch???? The meal for 2 was $45!

Thank god we didnt want any as it was another 30 min before they came back to see if we wanted to order desert!.

You go downstairs into the super busy dining room filled with lots of white people who just finished work. 3 drinks at the bar cost $50-$55ish (ugh), but they were delicious. I don't typically drink bourbon, but their blueberry bourbon drink was amazing, as well as their passionfruit whiskey fizz. The bill at the table in total was a tiny bit over $200 for 3 people... whoa. But we did get an insane amount of food (2 apps, 2 restaurant week, 1 $50/$55 entree, and 2 drinks). They sat us at a corner seat, which was really nice. Service was only good because they checked up on us (it's really sad that I'm used to servers not checking up on me that it's considered ""good"" if they do at least one table touch lol). There was a new server training who was nice and I wish him the best of luck! The server we had didn't take orders with a notepad, and it was weird because we did order a lot, and she did forget something. But it's ok.  The food took F O R E V E R to come, but I think it's because it was restaurant week and it was busy... that's me trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. ""The Mercer"" burger/sandwich on the RW menu was good but looked like a grilled cheese with a meat patty garnish. They did give us a TON of fries in a flower pot which was a little weird in a cute-at-the-same-time way. I would only go back for the drinks and to try out the rest of the real menu, but would truly be disappointed if the food took as long as it did next time.",,,
116,Jacqueline L.,"San Diego, CA",102,199,232,3.0,1/17/2016,"Our group had a 9:15 reservation, by 10pm we had finally been seated but no drinks received and we didn't order. So I wasn't happy to start. The decor was very trendy and the space is big.Our service was a bit lacking....one of our first drinks was missing, and our server came to our table probably 2 times. Also when our cheese and meat plate came out   no one explained what we were eating which is just 101...come on people!Food wise...eh...the crab fritter was fishy, my hake was cooked well but lacked imagination and flavor and had way too much celery on top and the plate had too much liquid on it. My sea bass carpaccio though was amazing. Mint, lemon it all worked.Lastly, the manager was very sweet and at the end of the meal brought us out bottle of champagne for our birthday girl which was a nice end to the meal.",1,,
117,Robert C.,"Kezar Falls, ME",30,26,30,1.0,3/6/2018,"I will never eat here again !!! I had made a reservation for 3 people on a Sunday night. We arrived to be led to a table which was the size of a round cocktail table set for 3. The restaurant was not even half full and there were plenty of other larger tables. I refused to sit at the tiny table and asked for another larger table. The hostess did not seem pleased and led us to another 4 top that was fine. A woman came and took our drink order and when the drinks arrived, my dining companion discovered after a few sips that there was no Tito's in his Tito's and cranberry juice. When we brought it to the waiter's attention, he said oh, it is just cranberry juice. Sorry.... STRIKE 1. Ordered a meat & cheese platter for the table,  It arrived and look very good with 3 cheeses, 3 meats and accompanying garnishes and condiments. Being inquisitive, I asked what types of cheeses were on the platter. The waiter had no clue, so he went and asked someone else. He then brought another waiter to our table who told us that 2 of the cheeses are from a goat and the other from a cow. No varieties, names of the cheeses, nothing. Apparently, no one in the place knows what varieties of cheese they serve.  STRIKE 2. Accompanying the platter was some rustic wheat bread.  The bread was stale and cold in the middle, as if it had been in the freezer previously and recently defrosted. STRIKE 3. I get it - restaurants have bad nights, but this is all getting annoying at this point.  We have finished our appetizer and have now waited over 30 minutes for our entrees, which included 2 burgers at $24 each and the Pork Chop at $37. The manger comes over and apologizes that there was a problem with their printer and that our entree order never made it to the kitchen. She is very polite and apologetic. I personally informed her of all of the mishaps that have led up to this moment and she apologizes further and offers a round on drinks or dessert. We accept and move on.  The entrees arrive about 15 minutes later and they are fine. Nothing to remember, but fine. We were given complimentary coffee, capuccino and 3 desserts as well as 2 free drinks, which made up, somewhat for the bad service and delays. Upon paying for the bill, after thinking this meal could not get any worse, we paid in cash and credit card. 2 thirds in cash and a third in credit dard. When the waiter returned for me to sign my credit card receipt, I noticed that the whole bill was charged on my card!!!!I brought it to his attention and after much apology, he adjusted it. It still is showing as the original amount today, but I hope it turns out to be the correct amount so I don't have to call them to have this resolved. It seems that there are too many hands in dealing with a table. We saw at lest 5-6 different people at our table doing different tasks. They need to get their act together, if they want repeat customers .",,,

The place is quite big and noisy but didn't bother anyone as we wanted to celebrate anyways.Service was ok but they didn't seem to be interested in why we hadn't touched our pasta - both the rigatoni and the angle hair pasta had a funky Gorgonzola like taste that wasn't mentioned anywhere (the menu stated aged parmigiano- which tastes totally different)Salmon and burger seemed to be tasty though.The wine we ordered was ""out of stock"" so the only alternative was a Tempranillo for $80, so $30 more than the one we initially wanted - and then we even had to ask for suitable red wine glasses as they usually serve their wine in tiny white wine glassware.Overall was not what we had expected and weren't happy when we left . I wouldn't recommend or come back.",,,

122,Nophar H.,"Manhattan, NY",99,44,13,3.0,4/17/2018,"Ugh breakfast sucks here. Overpriced and really not good. The Gruyère omelet has no cheese in it and came with tiny portion of potatoes and cherry tomatoes that had no salt. The avocado toast was just one tiny slice of bread with avocado and again bland tomatoes. The pancake was dry and bitter from extra baking powder. And they have no fresh juice!! Really?!? Way way too hyped and too expensive fore what it is, at least for breakfast.",,,
123,Adam B.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",14,37,412,3.0,6/27/2017,"The food is good but the portions are pretty small. I ordered the pancakes with fruit. Some of the other orders placed at our table were avocado toast, the Mercer burger, and the roasted lamb sandwich. I enjoyed the pancakes but wished there were more of them to enjoy. Everyone pretty much felt the same about what they ordered except for the roasted lamb sandwich, which seemed small to me but to each there own. The mercer burger comes with fries so if you want to feel satisfied when you are finished I think it would be a good choice over the others mentioned here.   Of course one could always order appetizers as well, or sides to come with the main meals. Had I known how small the portions were I would have definitely gone that route.",,,1

126,Susan M.,"New York, NY",0,8,8,2.0,3/28/2018,"Mediocre experience. My husband and I took our teenage son to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary with a late lunch today at Mercer Kitchen. I made sure when I made the reservation and again when we arrived to mention that we were celebrating but received absolutely no acknowledgement from anyone with the exception of the hostess' lukewarm acknowledgment that she had a corner booth for us(no big achievement given the time-3:15 pm). The waitress had no personality-she seemed incapable of warmth and had no ability to make pleasant chatter-again, completely ignoring our milestone. The food was also mediocre at worst, blah at best-with the exception of the shrimp salad. The fusilli dish my son and I planned to order was no longer on their menu even though the website hadn't reflected the change. What can I say - I feel shafted and made a mistake in choosing Mercer Kitchen, I feel like I wasted my special (and pricey) anniversary meal. I won't be returning and do yourselves a favor and try somewhere less pretentious and more interested in making their customers happy. This place is just cranking it out and going through the motions. Lastly,  one salad, 3 cokes and 3 lunch entrees set us back $150 -no liquor!",,,
127,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",532,293,1896,3.0,9/13/2016,"I tried not to have high expectations for one of Jean Georges restaurant because high expectations often leads to disappointment. Around the area and spontaneously decided to come here for lunch. The ambiance throughout the restaurant was very chic. The main dining area is actually downstairs. As I checked out the menus, nothing really appealed to me as everything seemed typical. They participate for restaurant week lunch as well. (Not sure about dinner) I really had no idea what to order so I decided to just keep it simple with some appetizers, a salad and a pizza off the ALC menu. The entrees and sides did not appeal to me. I had some raw seafood and I just wished the runner or server had came over to let me know what kind of oysters I was having, it matters. Even so, the oysters and clams were very fresh and satisfying. I highly recommend the crispy rice salmon sushi appetizer with the chipotle mayo and ponzu sauce, amazing combination right there. The server recommended the shrimp salad which sounded basic but I trusted her. I had my dressings on the side just in case I don't like it. Don't kill me if I say I don't like champagne, but I really don't so I was hesitant to try it. Let's just say, the champagne vinaigrette (it's creamy), was one of the best dressings I have ever had. The truffle dressing fell short though, what a disappointment. I love truffle, black truffle, white truffle, love it all so no doubt I was going to get the black truffle and fontina cheese pizza. It was a tad bit too oily, came in four slices and just perfect for sharing. Overall, the service was standard, and I would definitely enjoy lunch here if I'm around the Soho area.",2,1,1
128,Shauntrice W.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",1,27,6,4.0,7/21/2018,"The Mercer Kitchen was exceptional. We all started with a COCO NOVA cocktail. I mean you guys know how I feel about my cocktails + it was my birthday + we'd shopped til we dropped + WALKED those NYC blocks and needed to be refreshed. This was the perfect spin on a sunset passion colada, a coconut flavored drink with a hint of strawberry. It left us with a very nice buzz. We then ordered from the PRIXE FIX Menu which included an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. The PRIXE FIX menu offered two choices for each course. As an appetizer, patrons could choose from 3 cheese artichoke flower pizza or a refreshing heirloom tomato salad. The same applied to the entrée and dessert. Patrons could choose between the grilled lamb chops or the cod, and for dessert between the fresh fruit sorbet or the blackberry cake with ice cream. I chose the heirloom tomato salad, the grilled lamb chops, and the fresh fruit sorbet. The heirloom tomato salad was paired with an oil and vinaigrette dressing and topped with raspberries and orange peppers. The salad was very good. Light and refreshing, but the tomatoes were kind of overkill. Of course I chose lamb chops for my entrée. They were prepared beautifully. The perfect pink center (Medium), a nice char on the outside and tender inside. The chops were presented with a tomato barbecue sauce and were accompanied by mint green beans. I CLEANED THE PLATE GUYS. The earthiness and crunch from the sauteed green beans paired nicely with that soft mint taste was DELICIOUS. The lamb chops and that barbecue sauce made me want to lick my fingers and plate, but I have manners! The server came by after he noticed our plates were empty and asked were we ready for our desserts. I couldn't wait. I was so anxious and pleased with my choices thus far, I dove right on in and didn't even get a picture of the sorbet. Spoon in hand before the server could place the bowl on the table, I was excited. The sorbet flavors for the day were mango, raspberry and blueberry. That too got devoured like the rest of the meal. I would definitely recommend The Mercer Kitchen and return for another go round when I visit NYC again.",,,

Music is not too loud but not quiet either. It's a nice spot to grab dinner with your girlfriends during the week. Food was great and dessert was even better!

Some bonding time was much needed, at the same time, we're so sick of having dim sum every week with my dad, anyways. Sorry dad, ditching you today. So, we came in and got lost getting to the lower level on the elevator. We got to level B and then realizing they were on level K. K for kitchen? Who knows. Haha.Apps:Market Vegetable Carpaccio -- The color of the thinly sliced vegetables looked so vibrant, it almost looked like candy. Crunchy veggies tossed in a sweet and tangy dressing, appealing and appetizing at the same time.Pizza with Peaches -- ripe peaches atop goat cheese, so sweet, yet savory. The bottom of the crust was way too oily, though. Mains:Naturally Raised Chicken Breast -- The cream corn complimented the moist chicken breast, seasoned well. Simple dish done right.(The Mercer) Burger -- still juicy even though I asked for well done. Loved the crispy onions, creamy avocado was the perfect touch.Desserts:Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake -- Classic; warm, gooey molten cake side by side a scoop of soft creamy ice cream -- so satisfying.Cherry Berry Soup -- chilled cherry berry juice great for the a summer day. Sweet, chilled soup filled with ripe fruits in every bite. Hit the spot, it was my favorite dish of the entire meal.Our lady server had the sweetest smile, very patient, yet also accomodating.

135,Anthony G.,"Elizabeth, NJ",1,6,2,4.0,2/14/2018,"Visited The Mercer Kitchen for Valentine's Day. I made a reservation two weeks prior using the OpenTable app. On the way there my girlfriend and I were running 10 minutes behind, we called the restaurant to notify them and they were very understanding. Once we arrived everyone from the front door to our seating table was very polite & friendly. Our server Raymond was outstanding and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. We followed each one of his menu suggestions without failure. Raymond recommended we try the sashimi salmon appetizer for the table, my girlfriend had the organic pork chop with smoked chili glaze, and for myself I got the Mercer Burger. For dessert I had the carrot cake and my girlfriend had the warm valrhona chocolate cake. Everything was delicious and flavorful! I highly recommend this restaurant. If I could give it 4.5 star rating I would, the only reason I do not give it a 5 star is because the menu can be limited. A must try if you are looking for a great time in the Soho area !!!

137,Jeffrey S.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",1728,512,281,3.0,7/10/2016,"Had a really nice brunch here this morning but I felt a little sore in the posterior afterwards. As someone who eats out constantly, I know quality and I'm always willing to pay for it. I also realize that sometimes ambience or location are going to add to the overall expense but again, as long as it's not egregious, I'm generally happy. Ordered a yogurt parfait with fresh fruit compote and granola. Now, I understand that I'm in Soho. I also understand that I'm sitting in a beautiful restaurant among equally beautiful people but $15 for literally 4 ounces of yogurt with some stuff on it is obscene. Same with the $19 piece of Burrata mozzarella, $19 waffle and $15 for a few very average muffins.  Manhattan is not without spectacular brunch locations. The vast majority offer either decent food at acceptable prices or excellent food at ridiculous prices. I'm not sure if the former quality at the latter price will be a compelling reason for me to return to Mercer Kitchen. Perhaps if it was the only game in town but clearly it's not and there are way better choices of where to spend your hard earned money.",9,4,6

While there were available/empty tables  at 3pm on a saturday afternoon, I was told there was a 45 minute wait. My husband walked back in after we walked out and spoke to a female blonde manager and asked if we weren't sat down due to his gender preference and portly size. While she said this was untrue, the whole face control and profiling was very true. There was no reason we shouldn't have had the opportunity to sit down when there was open tables. It was disgusting and this restaurant has no class, together with an attitude. Just to mention we are pretty well off, so it's a loss for them. So horrendous I was appalled. Here's something to take home for the employees at Mercer Kitchen: Don't judge a book by it cover. Make sure you are wearing a Birkin and a 10 carat diamond if you wanna sit down here.

I ordered a rhubarb concoction and either it wasn't made right or the flavors got lost in the making and did not match the description. We ordered the Salmon sashimi and the truffle fontina cheese pizza as apps. The salmon sashimi was tasty. The contrast in textures and temps were creative and exciting. Pizza was good too but I didn't taste much truffle. As the main we all ordered the salmon entree except my husband ordered the fettuccine. Pasta was made fresh and so good. The salmon was a let down because the server described it as a savory dish; came with a small piece of salmon with a corn pudding that was so sweet. Not the least bit savory and not what I was in the mood for. Server was a bit of a novice. He didn't know much about the menu. He was pre-occupied with cleaning up the bar and going home. We were neglected as a table and had to get up to ask for them to take our order and get the check and pay. Overall the experience unfortunately outweighed the average food.,3,,

We were pretty crammed in there...As for the food, I myself, ordered The Mercer Burger, which tasted great, was cooked properly (medium) and sat a top a metal riser to keep the bottom from becoming soggy, along with a side of fries. Really tasty, but definitely not worthy of a $24 price tag. Like seriously, get over yourself, it's a burger! To wash it down, I had the homemade ginger lime soda, which was crisp and refreshing. I took a bite of my friend's fish and chips and it was quite honestly the best I've ever had... the batter was super crispy and cooked to perfection. Definitely what I'd order the next time.

Instantly she smiled and said ""Oh yeah we can do that no problem,"" and never came back, of course. We had to ask someone else for our bill so we could get out of this hell hole. I would never come back even if you paid me, it was a waste of my time and energy. Honestly you can make pretty much everything on that menu in your own kitchen, so there's no point.

When I took the first bite, it was extremely cold as if the bread came right out of the fridge and the burger was sitting out for some time. I called the waiter and explained the situation. She said she would have the kitchen fire up a new one. When it came out the 2nd time around - the fried onions, avocado and aioli was served on the side. I removed the top bread and to my disappointment I saw the original burger patty ( w the original cheese slice) with a bite taken out of it. After closer examination, it seemed the chef literally scraped off the dressing, onions and guacamole, mircro-waved the burger and put it onto a new bun. I was shocked that a restaurant of this caliber would do that, even after the waiter saying they would make a new one. On top of that, the burger wasn't even hot. I was so disappointed and frustrated with the kitchen. The manager came to apologize and asked if they could make another one or if I wanted to order something else.

149,Emily L.,"Newark, DE",4,5,2,4.0,12/6/2016,"Great location. The place was just as busy as you'd expect at noon on a Christmas season Saturday, so a table four four in the trendy/dim/exposed brick downstairs section had an hour wait. We were awesomely able to put our name in for the equally great upstairs section, grab a [delicious] drink from the cool downstairs bar (group photo by the bartender included, dad with the clutch move), and were seated in 15 minutes or less. Pear Aperol cocktail, Bloody Mary, Dark & Stormy, and G&T - good lookin' team. Staff was comfortingly professional and pleasant. Dad awkwardly told our waitress she had Cameron Diaz's smile. The bread (served with YUMMY olivwas burnt on the outside which I LOVED. I ordered the lamb sandwich, which was absolutely perfect, top to bottom - perfectly crunchy bread, arugula, roasted reds, and a green aioli. I will think of this sandwich forever. Side of yummy, tiny (thinkMcDonald's-looking) fries. Sam's turkey burger, with red peps also, was ""PHENOMINAL"", which I agreed with. Loved his fries too. Dad loved his fish n chips. His only complaint was that his glass was too big for his pour (bottled - lol great job dad). Lisa liked her marg 'za, and we both liked our Cab. My only complaint was the 10 min wait for the women's bathroom. But that's the vicious cycle you have to concede to if you want drinks that good. Overall, this was my (and Sam's) favorite place the entire [very busy and delicious] NYC weekend. I'd recommend this place to anyone.",,,

153,Avi A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",114,16,0,1.0,2/15/2017,"Service here is terrible. Was with some friends the other night and they were talking about how bad the service is at Mercer Kitchen. I didn't know what they were talking about - but I was soon to find out.Came for lunch. We were sitting for 10 minutes before the waiter approached the table. Guy tried to just take a drink order, based on how long it took him to come in the first place, I wasn't going to let that happen. He never ended up bringing the coffee that I ordered. He never came back to the table to check on us, not once. He'd walk by, just look at our table and keep walking. Never refilled anything. After we finished eating he looks at our table as he's cleaning the other table and says ""going to clean your table next"". He still had no intention on checking on us, refilling any drinks etc. I looked at him and said ""your service has been terrible."" I continued and said ""you haven't checked on us once. I never got my coffee. You haven't refilled her drink."" His only response ""refills aren't free"". Haha you piece of shit. The refill doesn't need to be free, we might still want one. Loser. He didn't care. I had to still interject and say ""can I have some more water"". That wasn't going to happen otherwise either. What's your response to that dickwad? He's the Indian looking dude with the white goatee. If you see that he's your waiter, just leave.",2,1,1

I've been here numerous times through the years but she was the best.This place still remains popular among both tourists and locals. The food isn't innovative but it doesn't claim to be and it will please a mixed crowd. Last night I had the burger for the first time and i was slightly surprised at how good it was. Umami all around.  Fries were plentiful but came out cold. Seafood tower was good and fairly portioned. There are a handful of *super* low, uncomfortable tables right down the steps. If I were a five year old playing house I would have been psyched to sit here but unfortunately I'm a grownup paying $17 for cocktails. These tables have no business being here for anything other than a quick drink. The bussing staff was ultra aggressive in clearing things to the point it was annoying. We had just finished a glass of Champagne and gotten our wine glasses for the bottle with dinner and someone started taking the wine glasses away. We still had food on our appetizer plates and they tried to remove them. Lots of awkward hovering.  The desserts are basic but again, crowdpleasers. E.g. Valrhona chocolate cake.  The people watching is fun. All in all they're not blowing the doors off the culinary world but you know what you're getting and it's a good, predictable standby.",,,

The burrata with cranberries was excellent, but where Mercer Kitchen truly lost stars for me was the frenzied service. A friend and I were mid-bite of our appetizer when our entrees were placed on the table and our appetizer plates were taken. This repeated at dinner, when a bus boy tried to take my friend's plate when she was still eating. I was truly disappointed in the service in comparison to other Jean-Georges restaurants I've dined at, and would take this into account before recommending Mercer Kitchen over ABC Kitchen or another comparable locale.",,,

This is a tactic used by some restaurants to 'assist' lingering customers to the door, however when you charge $700 + for a diner, then provide a $700 plus experience.  Very disappointed and would never recommend this place for that reason alone.  If you want to go home early, don't open a restaurant, period.  PS if you like it Russian sauna hot, then ignore this review and dine like a swine.",1,,

I have walked by on prince a million times and had heard great reviews from people I had to try it for myself.So my boyfriend and I decided to snag a Friday night reservation at 8:30pm for dinner during restaurant week. We showed up around 8:15pm and were told to wait promptly at the bar, which we did.The bar is fabulous and the bartenders at Mercer Kitchen are so kind and great at what they do. Good thing considering we had to wait an hour at the bar before finally being seated. To be honest, I would've showed up late if I had known I would be waiting forever for my reservation. According to the hostess, no one would get up from their tables after they had paid the check. Aggravating.Once we were finally seated we were handed the restaurant week menu which had a large array of choices. My boyfriend and I got something different for each of our courses. This allowed us to really taste everything they had to offer.The food was superb. I wouldn't expect bad food from a Jean-Georges restaurant. Every single course we ate was great and convinced us both that we need to come back immediately when it isn't restaurant week and eat for real!Overall, I love the interior and the front of house staff was extremely nice and hardworking.Will definitely be coming back!

They didn't even notice of course and we had to hand point it out - I really appreciate them coming put to apologize, even the shift manager. The burger itself was not cooked to the level requested - medium rare , the one recommended by the waitress herself . But the worst part of the whole dinner is that mercer kitchen decided to provide us with desserts on them ( again really nice and really appreciated ) however our waiter literally took everything from out table in the most aggressive way while we are still eating the burgers !!!!!!!! Left us with what we are still eating on the table didn't clean up and just threw the deserts on the table - no explanation , again !!!! We are still eating on the table our fries from the entrees !!!! And desserts were just thrown there.Needless to say the ice cream parts started melting.

Not a big deal, we asked to hostess to seat us anyway, even if they came back to set it up, and she agreed.Then some kind of supervisor/ manager comes in and asks us why were seating, with a really bitchy attitude. I said we were just seated, and she said they don't seat people until its set up and if we could please get up? I said no, we asked to be seated and hostess agreed. She said, ""I don't believe so"", I asked, what? She said I don't believe my hostess would do that. I repeated what I had just said, and she just left.

Updated review","My third time here at Mercer's and was Pretty disappointed. I made a rsvp at 7:45pm for 2 on opentable and got seated around 8:20pm. The wait was way too long. If the place is packed, then they shouldn't have offered rsvp at that certain time. Management could've been better esp at the bar. Everyone was crowded over there even the people waiting to be called for seats. The bar is way too small to fit or have so many people stand around waiting for a table. We were literally blocking busboys and waiters passing by. On another note, food was enjoyable. We ordered the seafood platter, carpaccio appetizer, 2 mocktails, salmon and a pasta. No complains except for the salmon being a tad overcooked. Don't come here when you're hungry. Long wait for seats and service. Even the busboys were more attentive than the waiter.",1,,

199,Andrea M.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,21,3,3.0,8/2/2016,"Dinner for two on a Monday night during Restaurant Week. The ambiance was great - trendy but not too loud, perfect for a date. I enjoyed the cocktails - I had the lychee prosecco and my boyfriend had the bourbon with blackberries. Both came out quickly and were worth the price. For the first course, we ordered the beet salad and the pizza with spinach. Both were delicious but the pizza was surprisingly outstanding. For the entrée, I had the chicken with lemon with balsamic radicchio and my boyfriend had the steamed skate which were both very mediocre. The radicchio was very acidic and bitter - barely ate more than 1 bite. For dessert, we tried both options and again the dishes were average but satisfactory. Overall, the meal was fine for the price but memorable for the wrong reasons. The only standout dish was the pizza.",3,1,
