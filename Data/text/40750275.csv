0,DJ H.,"Shakopee, MN",2,313,1240,3.0,3/10/2017,"I'm normally not a ""hotel bar and lounge"" type of guy but this place is actually pretty nice. We were staying here at Crowne Plaza so it was very convenient for an evening drink and snack.Beer wise they only have a few decent taps, but not bad. They also have a full bar selection with many options.Food wise I had the fish tacos that were actually quite good. My daughter had the lobster roll which was also good, though the bun was pretty generic. The chocolate cake dessert was decent but quite small for the price.Prices are a bit high but not as high as you would expect for a place in the Times Square area. Also, the feel of this place is casual and laid back, so it is a nice respite if you are looking for a break from the craziness of the area.",2,,2
1,Sean C.,"Kissimmee, FL",265,91,212,2.0,10/5/2018,"First, don't come here if you are on a tight schedule.  It. Is. Slow.  They are slow to acknowledge your arrival.  They are slow to take your order.  The food is slow to arrive.  They are slow to bring your check.  Everything is slow.  In such a fast paced city, it is jarring to go somewhere this slow, especially if you have somewhere to be. I would avoid it.  But, you will say, I want to use my $20 credit from check in...so did I...and it's not worth it.As you can see, I tried many food options, since I had a bunch of 'free' money to spend.  All of the items I had were okay..or fine..or tolerable. The best item was the Cobb Salad - but, you can't really mess up a salad.However, you can mess up a quesadilla - no taste! A turkey club - even less taste! But, those French fries were pretty good and you get a small bottle of unopened ketchup.Dessert was pretty good.  That's how I spent the last of my money since the food was miserable.  The chocolate cake was pretty nice overall.   My recommendation is to find better food...and stop here for dessert.",2,,
2,Eiluj N.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",0,36,1,1.0,9/7/2018,Used the coupon given to us at check in and felt as though we were being looked down on for using it! Waiter took it upon himself to included a 15% gratuity on the bill for the two of us. The joke was on him when I picked up the cash we left on the table which was even more than the 15% he forced on us.,1,,
3,Angwyn H.,"Lynnwood, WA",22,4,2,1.0,3/15/2018,"I came to this bar in hopes of getting a couple drinks before I turn in for the night. When I first came, I was left standing for a really long time. Finally, when I was seated, I was being roughly touched by a waiter who was a bald man, who told me that it was someone else's table even though I was first in line and had waited for a long time. Eventually I sat down and ordered whiskey on the rocks but that alone took 30mins to prepare. Service is terrible and drinks were mediocre, 10/10 would not recommend. Don't come here, you're wasting your time and money.",1,1,
4,John T.,Hong Kong,23,270,1235,2.0,5/1/2016,"This is located in the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel; it is the hotel bar. It has the feel of the hustle and bustle of a busy hotel. Does not feel like a place to have a quiet, relaxing drink. The drink choice is fairly limited, but some items on the menu out of stock. Aslo tried the buffalo wings, which was on the dry and salty side.",1,,
5,Linda C.,"Walpole, MA",36,28,0,5.0,12/10/2017,"Really enjoyed our after theatre drink and dessert. Our waiter Tony was great. Attentive and knowledgeable. Atmosphere was very nice, lots of candles and little lights. Will definitely go back next New York visit.",,1,1
6,Kari C.,"Rochester, NY",240,677,2130,3.0,5/20/2016,"Broadway 49 is located in the lobby of the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Times Square. We typically avoid these types of bars due to inflated prices and lackluster food, but stopped in here because drinks were comped by the hotel during our wait for check-in. We received two paper vouchers, which were handed over to the bartender. The selections, with the voucher are limited, so we went for the house wine. The bartender was very friendly and we ended up ordering a second round of drinks, which was something like $13.00 per glass.",4,2,4
7,Tamara C.,"Sun Prairie, WI",73,332,459,4.0,4/12/2016,"This bar/restaurant had a great grilled ceasar salad. If you're choosing to stay in, you can find something to eat here, be it a burger, salad or just appetizer. If you're looking for a ""wow"" factor, this isn't the place. It's very spread out on the same floor as the reception area for the hotel.",2,,1
8,Kelly B.,"Macungie, PA",9,371,9,3.0,11/5/2017,"The bar/restaurant at the Crown Plaza Hotel. Has been updated since I was last here. It's much more modern, with tables, bar top tables and the bar. Wine and beer list quite limited. We went for drinks and dessert, after a show. Both were good. Prices a tad high, but it is NYC. Service was excellent. Will be back, if I'm at this hotel.",,,
9,John L.,"Boston, MA",247,49,0,4.0,9/9/2017,Really great food and drinks! A little pricey but very convenient if you are staying in the Crowne plaza. Right in time square with tons of shows and things to get to in a few short minutes,,,
10,Don Z.,"Liverpool, NY",48,36,57,4.0,8/6/2016,Since I was staying at the Crown Plaza and receiving free drink tickets for being a gold member . I decided to check it out. I don't typically frequent hotel bars/ restaurant but I sure glad that I did. I ordered an appetizer which was fresh and equally good. The bartenders were very nice and attentive. The prices were reasonable for its location. You can also sit by the window that overlooks broadway.,,,
11,Ryan C.,"Butler, PA",128,73,85,4.0,6/9/2016,"Really nice place to hangout it you can't make up your mind where to go! I had the artichoke, bacon,  and arugula flatbread with my two complimentary Blue Moon draft beers. Enjoyed the basketball and soccer on the TVs and capped the night off with Tito's vodka on the rocks!",,,
