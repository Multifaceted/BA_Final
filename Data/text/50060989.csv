0,Tom L.,"Herndon, VA",6,6,0.0,5.0,9/20/2018,"The wife and I were in the city and looking to grab a quick bite and found this place on Yelp. We could not be more please, the food was just great, and price was downright cheap. We loved just sitting and enjoying the waterfall; it for sure helps charge the batteries to tackle more of the city.Would recommend this little hideaway to anyone looking for a quick bite and some serenity!",,,
1,Brian M.,"New York, NY",107,249,389,4.0,8/5/2018,Awesome little spot in the city. Little window serving up big flavors. We went in the pouring rain and still had a great time. It's a little slow serving but totally a cool experience. I recommend it in a nice day.,1,,3
2,Aaron H.,"Round Rock, TX",1,27,0,5.0,11/10/2018,"Tucked in on the inside of a private park next to the Synagogue, this is a hidden gem!  Great food with a lovely outdoor atmosphere.",,,
3,Nathan B.,"Meridian, ID",2,120,1,4.0,9/5/2018,"Simple, if not limited, fare done quickly in a quiet little corner of Manhattan. Finding the location was easy but the restaurant (stationary food truck?) took a bit. Friendly, quick service. Good food. Quiet place to unwind and relax a bit to the sounds of falling water.",,,
4,Bernice R.,"East Haven, CT",1,18,21,3.0,8/12/2018,"I enjoyed the location of this spot, it's nestled away in small park with its own little waterfall. You don't hear any of the street traffic and it's a nice break from city life when you just want to enjoy a bite to eat. If you're in a rush- this spot isn't for you. We ordered a bacon egg and cheese croissant and the loaded plate, and waited over twenty minutes for the food to be done. The food was meh- burnt bacon, decent eggs. The drinks were amazing- I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for a cold smoothie or refreshing drink on a hot day.",,,
5,Stesha L.,"Durham, NC",0,3,0,4.0,10/4/2018,"Visiting from NC with family. Had pancakes and breakfast roll/sandwich. The sandwich was devine; soft bread roll and delicious eggs and bacon. Kids couldn't get enough. The pancakes were burned on one side, which we like brown but this was too done. The quaint park by the waterfall where you could sit and eat was beautiful.",,,
6,Claudia C.,"Miller Place, NY",22,115,113,5.0,10/18/2017,"5 stars because although this place is just your standard deli food with your standard deli prices, the people working there are always super nice and fast with the food. Not to mention this is probably the world's most convenient location for a little concession stand. The waterfall is beautiful and blocks out all the noise of the city. This is the perfect spot to come to relax, meet someone, or study and grab a bite to eat I'm actually surprised that the prices are not super high because of the location and convenience but I'm not complaining.",1,,
7,Audrey F.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,7,5.0,6/13/2018,Carol's is amazing!!!  My son had her pancakes and we ordered a side of scrambled eggs as well. He said her scrambled eggs were the best he'd ever had!!  I need to get her recipe!  LOL!  My husband had the oatmeal and I have the garden omelette and both were equally as good!  Great coffee too. I highly recommend!  Not to mention the amazing ambience!!  The waterfall and trees are so relaxing.,,,
8,Christiaan M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",13,105,435,5.0,10/23/2017,Amazing spot to just chill and have a latte. It's in a park that has a gorgeous waterfall and right now its all decorated for Fall with pumpkins.,,,
9,Angie A.,"Downey, CA",0,5,0,5.0,9/9/2018,"Great customer service. The oatmeal and the bacon, egg and cheese croissant were delicious. Relaxing waterfall patio and affordable prices!",,,
10,Aayush R.,"Downtown, Albany, NY",40,2,0,5.0,9/8/2018,Just visited here for brunch as it was close to our hotel and was absolutely blown away by the ambience. Such peace and quiet in Manhattan is a rare find. Ordered buttermilk pancakes and loved them. Will definitely visit again when in NYC. Highly recommend it as a brunch spot during the non-winter months.,,,
11,Miriam E.,"Oakland, ME",64,1,0,4.0,7/24/2018,"Found this because we didn't want to wait in line for a bagel around the corner, we were happy to discover this little oasis in the city.",,,
12,J N.,"Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, NY",0,63,0,5.0,7/5/2018,"Anyway, this is such a gem and such a beautiful place to have breakfast because how often can New Yorkers get to eat with a waterfall next to them.? Carol's Cafe is basically like a stand in a public park. It's a bit tricky locating this place but try to find the sign out on the sidewalk to help you find it!  Got their yummy Vanilla and Cinnamon french toast for about 6 dollars and it came in 6 slices, which was more than enough! Definitely come if you're looking for a cheap breakfast around the neighborhood and for a good view!",,,
13,Melody W.,"Chicago, IL",2,118,40,3.0,6/3/2018,I wouldn't call it a cafe. It is more like a food stand. Food is expensive but taste good. The sitting area is very nice too but I think the sitting area is a public area free for everyone .,,,1
14,Luke N.,"Cherrywood, Austin, TX",0,5,0,5.0,8/31/2018,"An absolute oasis. Carol's is located in a small enclave with a waterfall and nice greenery. But the food is what blew me away. For a fraction of the price we would have paid somewhere else, my gf and I got French toast, bacon egg and cheese sandwich, and the chicken tikka masala w/ naan. Excellent all the way around, and some of the best French toast I've ever had. Carol rocks.",,,
15,Dian C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,40,2,5.0,8/29/2017,Seated at the waterfall. Zen like setting. A very nice place. Variety of foods for breakfast or lunch including smoothies and hot beverages all very good. The owner is really nice! I would come back many times.,2,,
16,Ognjen M.,"Copenhagen, Denmark",2,7,21,5.0,10/23/2017,Good breakfast and coffee in this little cafe. Is a cozy place in Greenacre Park. I god eggs and pancakes and it taste good and my americano was perfect.,,,
17,Elizabeth D.,"Cary, NC",1,79,2,4.0,7/19/2018,"Gorgeous outdoor setting with a waterfall. The cafe is a booth that serves good coffee and decent omelets. The pastry wasn't terrific. Service was very nice. Good value. If it's nice weather, it's a good spot to grab a quick bite.",,,
18,Eren T.,"Bristol, VT",25,11,8,4.0,9/18/2017,Nice atmosphere reliable prices and quiet in NYC! :) indoor would be better but it's still ok :),,,
19,Melissa C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,7/7/2018,Beautiful location. It's in a little park/patio area. Food was good but they wouldn't let me put my own sugar and cream in my coffee.  Staff was really nice though.,,,
20,Melody Q.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/25/2017,"I work next door to Carol's Cafe and I have my breakfast with them every morning! They have an awesome breakfast special -Coffee and a pastry/bagel for $2.50 !!!!! You can't beat that! I love going there every morning and getting my breakfast in the park while seeing the waterfall and beautiful flowers. Not to mention, Julie who works there, is an absolute sweetheart! Good food, good people, and an amazing view! Its a must go !",1,,
21,Paul C.,"Carrollton, TX",0,6,0,5.0,7/31/2017,"Stayed at Pod51 across the street. This awesome little cafe is set in Green Acre park. A small adorable setting with tables and benches to enjoy your breakfast. We had the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant and the french toast. It was awesome. The also have lunch, a great smoothie selection, as well as ice cream. Highly recommend.",2,,
22,Boaz P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,12/1/2017,Place is nice. Waterfall in constructions. The pancake was bad. The sandwich was fine.,,,
23,Freddy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/20/2017,"This is my favourite breakfast place, their coffee is amazing, I personally recommend their french toast, however everything these lovely couple make is super tasty. Julie and Anup are extremely warm. Not to mention this cafe is inside a hidden jem in east midtown a garden with a waterfall!! A must!!!",,,
