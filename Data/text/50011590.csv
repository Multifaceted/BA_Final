The space is beautiful, big, airy, well lit, a far cry from many cramped restaurants in New York. I definitely recommend reservations in advance. For dinners, the papardelle is amazing, one of my favorite dishes, as is the duck. For lunch, both the pancakes and burger are great. I have to admit that I don't really like any of their appetizers or salads though. However, at the price point and for the amazing ambience and service, this restaurant deserves five stars. Also, the bread is AMAZING. My favorite bread in the city.",,,
1,Blaine D.,"New York, NY",285,22,39,3.0,11/10/2018,We went to upland for brunch on a busy day so this review is in regards to brunch only. I thought the ambiance was great in the restaurant and it had a great vibe. Unfortunately it was a busy day so we felt rushed throughout the meal which took away from the experience. Food wise we ordered the burger and the frittata. The burger had good flavor and I would recommend ordering it for any meat eater headed to brunch at Upland. The frittata however was visually flat and just average - this is a dish you can miss.I have heard great things about their dinner menu and will hopefully be back to try dinner as well.,,,
2,Crissy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",104,42,13,4.0,11/9/2018,"Popped in here for a business lunch - I'd heard good things and wanted to check it out without footing the bill myself. It was generally good - marg pizza was great, very classic, and the salads were pretty good. The pastas were just fine. I don't know that the food is up to the hype, but a solid meal. I'll be down to come again for dinner and see how it differs, but won't go out of my way to come again.",,,
3,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3651,952,2091,4.0,9/9/2018,"Great place for lunch. It had an open concept with high ceilings. It is not stuffy in here at all. Beautiful restaurant.The three of us sat at this U shaped booth. I ordered the lamb pita which popped out at me based on its uniqueness and the fact that I am greek and know lamb. There are a lot of flavors going on here but they work. The lamb was also tender it suited the dish. The fries looked like your normal fries but they were a step above. I liked the crunchiness of them and they had just the right amount of salt. They had three sauces on the side, one was a green sauce that was good, the other was ketchup, and the third was this funky sweet sauce. It wasnt my favorite to be honest so I stuck with the green one.My colleagues said the burger was good as well. The burger itself is a thinner patty so they generally serve it medium. The flavors worked and the fries as I mentioned were a great compliment.I will be back. Solid business lunch.",17,4,13
4,Lo P.,"Manhattan, NY",1048,77,586,5.0,8/22/2018,"Upland is as solid as it gets for dinner of any occasion. The ambiance captures you from the moment you walk in with its high ceilings, preserved lemon wall and my favorite, the bathtub floral centerpieces.  The food and service are top notch. I base my expectations of the restaurant off of the bread they provide and my my does Upland deliver. A fresh loaf of warm potato bread with sea salt on top - I LOVE BREAD. For food don't miss: cacio e pepe, sausage and kale pizza, pappardelle, crispy mushrooms and salmon. For dessert don't miss: the warm cookie basket, chocolate mousse, and the labneh cheesecake. Upland, don't you go a changin.",2,,1
5,Nhu H.,"Chicago, IL",189,106,116,3.0,10/20/2018,This place is so overrated. The interior and decorations were gorgeous but the food was just meh. My friend and I came here for dinner and started with the whole crispy mushroom and ordered the duck and cod as our main entrees and were not impressed. It was just ok. Nothing special to talk about. Kind of disappointing considering all the positive reviews on yelp.,1,,
6,Miriam M.,"Manhattan, NY",311,287,527,5.0,10/24/2018,Boyfriend and I went on a rec from a friend of mine.Place was packed even on a Monday night so I recommend rezzys. Beautiful and clean interior we opted for these small bar seats since there was no wait. The food and wait staff however were phenom.Started with the duck wings- omg the sauce. And the cr4ispiest skin. Just sad that it didn't come with more. HE had the cioppino and I had the fish encrusted with flax and the charred cabbage and farro. Both were really good. Finished with the chocolate cake. Wine list was good but a couple glasses def set us back some big bucks. Probably should have opted for a bottle.,,,
7,Adam H.,"Medina, OH",112,159,40,5.0,10/20/2018,"Amazing experience. I would certainly come back again. We even saw a couple celebrities dinning here as well, so must be decent at least!We walked in and we're seated promptly and had the bread that was served us, it was absolutely delicious.My entrée was fish that was served with a house made sauerkraut and spring peas, because that was what was in season. The menu changes rapidly based on seasonality and I appreciate that. The house made crowd was very well done not too sour which is good. Everything was cooked perfectly and prepared and plated to perfection. You could certainly tell you're dealing with world-class chefs. We kept our visit short and didn't get any dessert, but certainly would have because you know that this place would have knocked it out of the park. I would certainly come back as this is a menu you want to explore over and over again.",,,

The restaurants is cute and such a great spot to hang with friends.Doughnuts (4): Basket comes with I remember 2 - 3 different flavors of doughnuts. The donuts are fluffy and delicious.Spaghettini (4): Slightly saltier than I like, but I still finish this dish almost within minutes!Sausage + Kale Pizza (5): Great to share for the table. Lots of flavor and perfect amount of seasoning.",1,,1
9,Tash G.,"Mississauga, Canada",6,74,49,4.0,10/8/2018,"The food sounds really basic when you read the menu but oh man did they do an excellent job with the basics. I would 100% go back here. We ordered three dishes between four people: The margherita pizza, a pasta, and the fried chicken burger. The only one we would not recommend again would be the fried chicken burger, it didn't taste anything special but the other two were amazing. The service was fast and friendly, the ambience was nice. Overall a pleasant experience with no complaints.",,,
10,Chirl P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6,36,107,3.0,9/22/2018,"Came here for dinner because of how highly recommended this place was, and it did not live up to the hype for me. The interior, atmosphere and the service were probably the best parts of the place for me. The restaurant is beautiful and so classy, and the staff is so knowledgeable and courteous.  They really know the ins and outs of the menu, and know a lot about the wine selection - big plus! In terms of the food, i thought it was average. While they did have some interesting dishes, everything was too salty for me and didn't taste as good as I thought it could be. For how expensive this place, I don't think I would be back again.For 3 people we ordered:-Whole crispy mushroom, hen of the woods, cloumage&herbs ($24) - Interesting dish because I never had this mushroom before, but it was really dry. I wish it came with a sauce or something.-Crispy Duck Wings ($20) - Good flavors and cooked well, but was too salty. Would recommend!-Peekytoe Crab Salad ($26) - Probably my favorite dish of the meal. I loved the flavors and the different textures. Would recommend!-Flaxseed Crusted Cod, cracked wheat risotto, mushroom conserva + smoked cabbage ($34) - Really salty but I liked the texture and the cabbage. The flavors were great, and I liked the flaxseed crust which is something I've never seen for cod before.-Pappardelle, spicy sausage ragù, kale + parmigiano ($25) - A little too spicy and salty but the pasta was very fresh.-Upland Cioppino, clams, red shrimp, mussels, white fish, jumbo lump crab + gochujang ($37) - I didn't get to try this, but my friend really enjoyed this dish.",1,,
11,Elizabeth D.,"Queens, NY",143,122,150,5.0,11/12/2018,"I came here for lunch and was not disappointed! I sat at the bar and ordered the Estrella pasta. Even though it took a little longer than I anticipated for the pasta to come out, it was worth it. It is pricy for the portion of pasta, but it's actually delicious. The chicken liver was cooked perfectly and the pasta itself was DELICIOUS! I love more herby, buttery pasta and this did not disappoint. I was stuffed and could barely finish my portion of pasta. I will definitely come back to try more dishes!",,,

Updated review","I'm not sure why I expected this restaurant to NOT be fabulous because it kinda was. Every single bite was just so good. The highlights for me were the Branzino, the lamb and...the bread. I know, who cares about the bread? I guess I do. Reading the menu, it wasn't obvious to me that this restaurant is best enjoyed family style, but our server advised us to try it. The portions are actually quite large, and sharing is the way to go here. The branzino, for example, was a dish for two, but there was easily enough for my group of four girls.We shared the branzino, lamb, the Caesar salad (not traditional but traditional flavors and YUMMY), the fried mushroom appetizer (this wasn't my favorite, but everyone else raved about it), the cheesecake dessert (very light and nice), and of course the bread which is warm and comes with delicious butter! We also ordered a bottle of NY wine. The wine wasn't very good. I thought it might taste better after food. No. Probably my fault, though the sommelier said it was good.  Anyway, I guess that's what happens when you say you don't want to spend over $100. We were still talking about our meal on day 3. I wish I'd taken more or even...any pictures, but I do NOT think you'll be disappointed. Note to restaurant: I know it's sometimes just a little perk, but when it's someone's birthday, it's really a nice gesture to offer a free dessert. Maybe it's just a California thing...???",2,1,1
13,Angie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,15,28,3.0,10/21/2018,"I really wanted to add Upland to my fave restaurants in NYC list but it fell short in...well everything. The food was inconsistent. The little gem salad - could have been the new ""it"" salad if not for the overt tart flavor that lingers in the end. Too much acid made my eyes water as I swallowed. Maybe more avocado, less vinegar. The upland burger was delicious - savory, creamy goodness. Fries were good as fries should be.  The  farm egg omelette was a salt stick. The line cook must have forgotten he salted the egg already and must have forgotten that there's also feta cheese that adds saltiness but he must have gone back and salted the eggs two more times, at least. Not kidding it was a salt stick. Also the color of the eggs was peculiar. Aren't eggs supposed to be yellow? These eggs where white rather than yellow. Donuts were good. The vanilla bean frosted one was our favorite. The ambience is kind of interesting. All sorts of clientele from the truly young (crying babies) to uber well dressed wealthy people. The jars of preserved lemons were pretty - very Martha Stewart but they're not central to the menu. They're just decoration. In fact the lemons and the ceiling were the only ""California"" inspired aspects of the restaurant. There's nothing ""California"" inspired about the menu. Now service...Service is 3 stars and inconsistent. We were seated within a few minutes of arriving - good. We ordered an iced coffee and a hot flat white with almond milk. The iced coffee was dropped off without cream or sugar.  Instead of a hot flat white with almond milk we got an iced latte with regular milk. The good thing is that the waiter recognized the latte mistake and came by to apologize and bring out the hot flat white. We told wait staff when they came to take away plates that the omelette was inedible but the man said ""really?"" and looked skeptical. We paid for our meal and before we left we told our head waiter that the omelette was terrible  and that the line cook may be making mistakes on salting the eggs. He looked confused as if not sure how to progress. We said thanks and left. Perhaps this restaurant should train waiters on how to communicate customer feedback re: food to the kitchen so the same mistakes aren't made all day.",3,,
14,Joe S.,"New York, NY",290,9,13,5.0,9/9/2018,"Walking in at 1pm on a Saturday we were told it would be an hour wait to sit inside, thankfully there were 2 seats open at the bar though and we didn't have to wait a minute!As you can tell from pictures the ambiance created by their walls of backlit bottles and low hanging black lamps is wonderfully New York. Very chic.I kept it simple just ordering eggs and sausage with a cappacino - no dissapointments. As a side, I really enjoyed the crispy baby potatoes that came with. Will 100% be back soon!",,,1
15,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4581,2942,8899,4.0,4/24/2018,"Dear Kyle,Thank you for being our server the other night.* Upland is a stunningly beautiful space, with high ceilings, excellent light, and a very attractive menu...but our meal still wouldn't have been the same without your energy and good humor.**Of course, your recommendations were spot on (we particularly enjoyed the cacio e pepe, the duck wings, and the cod...although, the best bite may have been that perfectly fluffy potato bread and butter we started with, I assume because you love us), and I'm glad that Upland's food mostly lives up to the promise of the hype. But it's the little things that made our night. I sincerely appreciated that when we asked after my missing glass of gruner, you didn't put the blame on the bar, or make excuses. You just admitted you forgot it completely, and made us laugh in the process. What I'm trying to say is that even though you're not perfect, neither am I. Let's spend the rest of our lives together.Or alternatively, I can just stay married to my wife,*** you can keep being the outstanding human you are, and maybe I'll see you at Upland again sometime soon. ______________*I imagine you actually get paid to be there, but I don't want to assume anything.**Your friends at the hostess stand were also wonderfully friendly, despite me arriving with a backpack like a child.***Unless YOU were into our happily ever after.

16,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",962,976,2710,4.0,4/5/2018,"It's another popular Stephen Starr restaurant which is apparently loved by the Obamas as well as the Clintons. The restaurant is gorgeous, there is such a beautiful layout and such a relaxing and open feeling to the restaurant that is really calming. I also loved how there were seven total bathrooms, yes seven total bathrooms, one being handicapped. In terms of the food, I felt the apps really shined, the homemade brioche was excellent, but the entrees were OK to just good.The food:Crispy Duck Wings- Lemon, olive oil + yuzu kosho. Duck wing- This was the surprise dish since I wouldn't think to get duck wings, but they were the favorite appetizer of the night. The meat was really tender and juicy and I thought the flavor was great but I felt it was really expensive for such little meat. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Whole Crispy Mushroom- Hen of the woods, cloumage + herbs. The mushrooms were made really well. They were perfectly fried and not greasy. The bottom of the mushrooms had a nice artichoke heart like feel to them. The yogurt sauce was a nice accompaniment. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Nantucket Bay Scallops- Citrus ponzu, meyer lemon + horseradish. I really loved the flavor of the scallops themselves and the cook on it was really nice but I felt the citrus ponzu and meyer lemon completely overwhelmed the dish. All I tasted was the grapefruit instead of the scallops. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Beef Tartare- Black trumpet mushroom, puffed farro, anchovy + egg yolk. I enjoyed the meat aspect of the tartare but I didn't like the puffed faro, it really reminded of eating the semi popped popcorn left at the bottom of the popcorn bag. I wasn't a fan of this dish. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Flaxseed Crusted Cod- Cracked wheat risotto, mushroom conserva + smoked cabbage. I really enjoyed the fish port of the dish but I felt the sauce was kinda off and sour in a weird way. I didn't think the sauce and cod meshed well at all. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Angus Skirt Steak- Black garlic, romesco + bunching onions. The steak was cooked well, it was a nice med rare. I liked the romesco, it had nice big chunks of almond but I was expecting more flavor from the sauce since romesco normally packs a punch. I also thought it was kinda weird how they served it since it was folded in half. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Roasted Lamb Shoulder- Sweet potato, sprouted lentils, aji dulce + cilantro avocado pesto. I was shocked I didn't like the lamb since lamb is one of my favorite proteins. I am guessing it was a roasted piece of lamb that they finished on the grill, but for me, it didn't work. The lamb had a lot of burnt pieces as did the sweet potato. I just remember having a charred flavor throughout the dish that I was not a fan of. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Honeycrisp Apple Tart- Salted caramel + vanilla ice cream. The apple tart had good flavor and I really enjoyed the ice cream but this had weird burnt pieces as well. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",11,6,9
17,Susan F.,"New York, NY",1,125,638,4.0,8/4/2018,Upland is a very nice restaurant. The room has high ceilings which makes it pretty noisy.   We sat by the front window and my seat was overlooking the beautiful bar. We were greeted by lovely hostesses and seated immediately. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming. The food is very good.  The caesar salad (not really caesar) was huge and delicious. The hierloom tomato salad was excellent. The salmon and cod were cooked and seasoned well. The duck was overcooked so too dry.  The runners were friendly. We will definitely return.,2,1,1
18,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",47,123,407,3.0,4/8/2018,"I really wanted to like Upland. I'd heard amazing things about the place and the menu seemed really good. The vibe of the restaurant/general ambiance is super nice, but I felt like the food didn't live up to the hype -- it's good, but not as good as I thought it would be.For brunch, had the farm egg omelette (bulgarian feta, spinach + mixed greens 16) and it was a pretty generic omelette (and definitely pretty small)For dinner, had the whole crispy mushroom, crispy duck wings, bucatini cacio e pepe, and pappardelle. The mushroom was probably the most unique/tasty thing we got, and the duck wings were pretty good too. The pastas were tasty but not significantly different from other places I've tried in the city.All in all, pretty good food but not that stand-out compared with other restaurants/on the pricier side.",2,1,2

The restaurant is gorgeous and warm and filled with warm colours and lovely decorations and all things lovely. The food was incredible & waiters were awesome. This was dinner time. I set that scene because unfortunately I was not as impressed with lunch..at all. While what we ordered was yummy (Cacio e pepe was the best!!!) the brunch at this establishment is just kinda lacking. Really just not an interesting menu at all and it was 2:30 pm and I was hungry...Just a little disappointed with the brunch options. Also, my server hardly paid attention to us. For the first 20 minutes that we were there he seemed calm but kept coming up to us saying he'll get to us in a few minutes and checked on his other tables many time. All is well though because I love Starr Restaurants and realistically I'll probably come back for dinner again :)",1,1,2
23,Derek S.,"San Jose, CA",5000,2167,8652,3.0,1/28/2018,"Came by for dinner the other night with a reservation from OpenTable. The restaurant looked fantastic on the outside and the vibe on the inside was quite unique and comfortable.The meal started off with the complimentary house-made potato bread which was the highlight of the meal. The bread was very soft on the inside with the edges were wonderfully crispy.Ordered the duck wings that Yelpers were raving about and it didn't live up to the hype. The wings were too salty and the meat was overcooked...Moved on to the porchetta and it was also lackluster. At $35, portions were on the light side. The loin part was dry and overcooked while the shoulder was more acceptable with a fattier cut. ...I've had much better porchetta. The crispy pork rinds were tasty though. ...the dish did mention bok choy that I didn't quite seem to find...Service was prompt and courteous by the waitstaff.~$75 after tax and gratuity for dinner.",11,3,6

Upon entering, we sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. It wasn't tooo busy when we were there on a Saturday at 11 but definitely filled up quickly. The pancakes looked delicious, so I ordered them and didn't realize how filling they are! There's three huge pancakes, and they're delicious, but I only finished about 60-70%. One fault is that the wait for the food was so long (probably 20-25 minutes). Our waiter did come by to say that's not normal. They at least did have the correct orders and the food was tasty when it finally did arrive! I'd come back and try the eggs benedict next time!",,,

If we would not have made them, it was over an hour wait. Yuck. Now, onto the FOOD...we had done a recon on the menu before we came, so we already knew what we were ordering. Although the both of us started going back and forth on a few because the food the kitchen was pumping out were such good looking dishes and one looked better than the last! Of course, donuts for our appetizer were a must. Three big chef selected, dense donuts. OMG..these were awesome. For our brunch, we ordered their Bucatini Cacio e Pepe (which is a type of pasta, in case no one knew) and the Farm Egg Omelet. The pasta was plain and simple...Romano cheese and black pepper...a dish worth every single bite. It SOUNDS plain, but the simplicity of it was fantastic. The Omelette was so light and fluffy and had just enough feta and spinach in it. Most places love to stuff the heck out of Omelettes. This was perfect. Neither of us walked out with stuffed bellies, but yet full and satisfied. I would recommend this place to anyone. Service was superb and the food as well.",1,1,1

The bar is small, but the perfect pre-drink dinner spot. For an appetizer we got the falafel. It came with 3 huge portions and this amazing tahini sauce. They were perfect crispy on the outside and with the combination of the sauce it was the perfect bite. For dinner I got the sausage and kale pizza. My friend had gotten this entree last time and I just had to have it this time. The kale had the perfect buttering taste/crunch to compliment the sweet sausage. The pizza was also the perfect portion to share, or if you are feeling ambitious, you can eat it on your own. I am dying to try the burger,so I will be back!",1,1,1

30,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,5.0,11/28/2017,"Upland is the perfect dinner with your boss spot. The location near Madison Square Park is polished and hip but not too date-y. The menu is filled with upscale crowdpleasers. Service is pitch-perfect. The prices are higher than you want to pay, but not so high that you feel like you're taking advantage of your boss.Oh, and the food? The food is fantastic.I made a reservation a couple weeks out for a 7:30 pm weeknight table for two. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and was told our table would be ready exactly at our reservation time-- they run a tight ship here. We were told we could get drinks at the bar, but it's so bustling you're better off waiting.Once seated, we ordered and received our first glasses of wine swiftly. Staff is well trained to answer questions about the drink and food menu.I started with the whole crispy mushroom ($21). It's a sight to behold, an almost alien-like growth on your plate. It tastes homey, though; earthy and salty with a kiss of smoke. The texture was perfect, and the swirl of white sauce was more than decoration.For my main, I did the smoked Long Island duck ($36), and wow. I eat duck frequently and I was impressed. It had the texture of a rare steak, and an even better flavor. The veggies on the plate were the perfect complement. It even held up to reheating the next day, as I was bursting at that point.I was pleasantly surprised by Upland. Not because they're doing anything new-- you can't throw a stone in this part of town without hitting a place with octopus and farro on the menu. But they're doing it so well. Execution is very strong here, from the design to the pacing (a perfect 1.5 hours) to the food. Also, the wine I had here was lovely, though pricy at $12-19 by the glass.I wouldn't hesitate to return here. Hopefully the bill will be on someone else, like my boss, but it is worth the price.",4,2,2

I went with two friends and we decided to share a bunch of dishes. It was a great decision as we were able to try so many things! We started off our first course with...-crispy duck wings: they were excellent! It was actually my first time having duck and I loved it. The skin was crispy and cooked perfectly. I also really enjoyed the sauce the wings were in. -margarita pizza: simple, yet perfect. The pizza was light, but delicious. The crust was my favorite part. Our entree course we had:-cacio pepe: I personally really enjoyed and had this dish the last time I went. Really like uplands take on this simple dish. -gnocchi: I didn't love, but I did really like. My friends I dined with liked this much better than the cacio Pepe though, so I guess it's all personal preference. -crispy mushroom: not even quite sure how to explain this dish, but it was AMAZING. I can go as far as saying this is the best mushroom I've ever had. It's perfectly crispy and SO delicious. For dessert we shared the milk and cookies. I honestly wasn't expecting the cookies to be so delicious, but they blew me away. Specifically, the oatmeal. This cookie was veryyyyy different than any other oatmeal cookie I've ever had. I really loved it.Highly recommend trying out Upland. I'm already thinking about the next time I'll go. It's difficult to make a reservation so I suggested making one in advance.",1,,2

Also the atmosphere had the perfect lighting and very spacious.",,,
35,Kirsten S.,"Staten Island, NY",524,493,3228,2.0,11/13/2017,"I think Upland is highly overrated. It's high ticket filled with a bunch of actors and up n coming techies waiting to be spotted. I've been dragged here a few times by people before who come here for status not quality. The Shishito app was not good. Steaks have always been overcooked. The pasta is hit or miss. No consistency. It thrives on trend status. It's very very loud and impossible to have a conversation. We first came here to meat a long time family friend who use to be Mr Pretentious Manhattan, so this would be right up his alley. At the end of the meal he looked to us and said ""why did we come here?"". It was to pretentious for even him. This is not my scene sorry",4,3,1

37,Erin-marie P D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,20,4.0,10/1/2018,"Friend of a friend recommended this place. I was a little worried from reading reviews that even with a reservation there would be a a 15-30 min wait. Luckily this wasn't the case, even when my friend was 15 min late. Really enjoyed the venue, a lot of natural light comes from the windows and it's pretty roomy. Definitely perfect for meeting with friends or  dates. I ordered the sasuage and kale pizza. Loved that the kale wasn't overbaked, the dough was moist and chewy (if you prefer thin crust, would not recommend) and crispy and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. It didn't look like that filling (size of a typical personal pie), but in reality because of the dough, I could only finish half of it. The only reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because the service was average. For a place like this, expected the server to come more often than she did. Also, nearing the end of the meal they tried to subtley shuffle us out even though the place was half empty (we went late afternoon).",,,

To start, the complimentary potato bread was delicious. I loved the addition of the sea salt on top of it. My boyfriend and I shared the gnocchi and pappardelle- both were amazing, especially the pappardelle. Forgot to take a picture of them before we dug in! Neither of us were hungry enough to try the steak, but I have heard great things so I will definitely be coming back to try it.I loved the cozy atmosphere in this restaurant. The lighting and overall vibe is perfect. So glad I finally tried this restaurant after admiring it so many times when I walk by it! Upland, keep doing you!",1,1,
40,Sabina K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,65,0,3.0,4/27/2018,"Came here for brunch after rave reviews from friends. Ordered the spanish fritatta, which was incredibly heavy (should have expected this, as it was slathered in mayo). The flavor was good, but the dish was cold which kind of took away from it. My husband ordered the spaghettini, which was hot, fresh and flavorful- I was definitely jealous of his dish. Generally I appreciated the open, beautiful restaurant and ambiance. I'd be willing to give this place another shot, and pass on the frittatta next time",2,2,1
41,Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",665,162,694,5.0,10/13/2017,"Amazing food in a beautiful venue! Their menu is seasonal and the lunch and dinner menu differ slightly. Regardless of what time of year or time of day you come, you're bound to have a lovely meal.Here's the list of things I've sampled from the various sections of their menu.From the PIZZA menu: 'nduja pizza'nduja is a type of sausage so the casing has been removed and pieces of 'nduja are sprinkled on the pizza. Great for sharing.From the ONE menu: beef tartare, whole crispy mushroom, seared octopus, and crispy duck wingsBeef tartare has crispy bites mixed in to the gooey egg so it creates an interesting texture. The mushroom is a whole hen of the woods mushroom - the king of the mushrooms! It's paired with a creamy sauce and looks like a black cauliflower. Octopus is paired with bites of the pomelo (similar to grapefruit), which makes each bite pop. The duck wings are phenomenal - reminds me of mini turkey wings that fall off the bone.From the TWO menu: bucatini cacio e pepe, estrella, pappardelleAll are amazing! Their prized pasta dish is the bucatini - simple pecorino romano and black pepper but so creamy. The estrella with chicken liver is super chewy and has flavor throughout. The pappardelle with the spicy sausage ragu, kale, and parmigiano is equally wonderful! You can't go wrong with any of these dishes.From the THREE menu: upland cioppino and skirt steakThe cioppino is a seafood stew, paired with a grilled slice of toasted bread. It's quite tasty, but you have to be in the mood for a very seafood-heavy dish. I probably won't get this again, as it's a little salty for my taste so I ate the fillings. It's peppered with clams, mussels, a shrimp with the shell still on (head and all), and crab meat - yum! The skirt steak is so soft and flavorful. I didn't even need a steak knife to cut into this!From the VEGETABLES menu: blistered shishito peppersGrilled peppers topped with bottarga are the perfect side dish to complement your meal.All in all, a fabulous meal. Anything you try is bound to be delicious!",4,1,5

Started off with some complementary bread, was warm, soft, and sooooo good. Wanted to eat the whole roll of bread, but kept myself from becoming full. (Literally wondered if I should have asked the waiter to box up the leftover bread... it was good). Had the peekytoe crab salad with avocado. The sauce was a bit overpowering, it was some type of aioli mayo sauce. Not a lot of crab. They also served it with some fried puff (acts as bread or cracker to eat with salad) but felt really salty and did not eat that much. Ordered the cacio e pepe. Simple, al dente, not too overpowering with oil or cheese. Simple and elegant dish. Also had the flax seed crusted cod. The exterior of the fish was crispy and the cod was soft. Good seasoning. The garnish of the dish leaned to the saltier side with a bit too much acidity for me. A bit of the garnish with the cod complemented well, but we could not finish all of the garnish. Definitely want to come back to try other dishes!",2,1,1

I love the atmosphere in here, it gives off a Cali vibe which I love! Food was good, we ordered the quiche lorraine (which was delicious) and the upland cheeseburger (also very good). And we ordered mimosas, which were ok, they were a little too dry for my liking but it did have freshly squeezed oranges in it. Maybe the oranges weren't sweet or something. We also got a side of bacon and they were so crispy which is just the way I like them!  Service could have been a little faster considering there wasn't that many people in the restaurant when we first walked in.

51,Jen S.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",165,229,700,2.0,7/14/2018,"Nope, this place did not live up to the hype. It was busy on a Fri night and we sat outside. The noise level was high on the inside, so I didnt mind too much. Service was ok, the selection included pizzas, apps, pastas & main courses. Wasn't too inspired by the selection and opted for peeky toe crab, spaghetti with clam (special) & lamb shoulder. Potato bread was a nice touch but sea salt on top was too much salt. In fact the dishes tended to be overly salted and seasoned in general. Peeky toe crab was the hit...fresh avo, chunky crab & chicharron worked well together. The spaghetti was way too salty, spicy and overworked. Similarly the lamb was overdone with intense salt/sweet marinade that could have been any kind of meet. When this happens I think that either the chef doesn't know how to subtly balance flavors or they are making ingredients that are not fresh. For the price, not worth it. Will probably not return.",1,,
52,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",357,80,43,4.0,4/1/2018,"I came here for brunch with a friend. The hype for Upland is more for the ambiance than the food.

The restaurant is so beautiful, with a wide open floor plan and sun streaming in the huge widows. It is well-decorated with a fresh farm to table vibe. Bottles of wine line the counters and flower arrangements sit in the middle partitions between booths. I would definitely come back to grab a coffee and dessert with a friend.

55,Matsuko F.,"East Side, Vancouver, Canada",61,3,3,3.0,10/15/2018,"Came here for brunch and it was pretty mediocre. We had a salad that was incredibly bitter, oily, and peppery. The ""grilled bread"" (read: toast) is pretty difficult to eat, too. They picked a bread with a thick crust to begin with, so toasting it makes the crust very difficult to bite through. Also ordered medium-cooked eggs and they came closer to soft. There were also a lot of staff, but the service was kind of slow.",,,

Updated review","Been here for lunch many times and they were consistently good experiences.   Decided to drop by for brunch the other day and it was interesting once again.  Started with a bellini for moi and mimosa for him which were nice and strong on the bubbly.  I had the eggs in hell which was a bit on the light side satiety wise but the seasoning was nice and picante along with a cilantro presence.  Although I requested medium for the sunny side up eggs, they still came out runny much to my dismay.  Waiter offered over medium instead of sunnyside up initially so maybe I should've gone with that. He ordered the cheeseburger which was very good even though American cheese was the only option and kind of a cheap cheese.  Fries were good, pickle to cucumber ish. Also had the buttermilk pancakes with berries to share which was super delicious.  Good service, nice decor, always too loud but it's a busy resto what do you expect.  Overall, I was still hungry after the eggs, the burger needs more cheese options and the pancakes and cocktails were awesome.",1,1,1

58,Aaron K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,62,0,4.0,8/12/2018,"Tip: Ignore the address. The entrance is on 26th street, just east of Park Ave. South.Had a very pleasant evening. Party of four. Early reservation (5:15 PM) on a Saturday night (the only reservation we could get on 3 days notice). We were seated immediately but at this hour the place was already half full. We were given a seat along the back wall which worked out well (quieter than being up front). Conversation easy even for two of us who are hearing impaired.Service was attentive. They took back my wife's martini which somehow was not to her liking without an argument. At one point, I dropped (and broke) a water glass on the table. Staff arrived to help in less than 30 seconds.Dishes were all well prepared and interesting. I have perhaps a strange recommendation. The cookie plate for dessert was fabulous. Large enough for four people plus, great variety, all delicious.Dinner for two (with 3 drinks) several small dishes, plus 2 entrees, one dessert plus tip was $175. Not inexpensive, but we did not feel ripped-off.We shall return.",,,

That being said, the ambience is pretty clean and modern. We got a reservation for 6 for brunch on Sunday. They have a very large selection of cocktails and other alcoholic beverages here. I had the breakfast stout which had heavy tones of malt and coffee.For my entree I got the porchetta sandwich. It was pretty good but isn't as much pork as you would think. It came on a nice ciabatta bread with a perfectly fried egg.Some others got the kale and sausage salad which was very good. There isn't as much kale as you would think and the sausage is delicious with the white sauce topping.A couple other people got an omelette and a burger, both of which looked good but not outstanding.The prices are around $15-25 for an entree. Drinks can be $9-15 depending on what you get.I would come back again if I was looking for solid brunch food.

And portions are very generous also (unlike nearby trendy restaurants).The ambience is pretty cool, day and night. Night is my favorite time to go. There is this orange tone and lighting is enough to see what you are eating, but dark enough to make it cool/romantic.Background music is perfect, also covering nearby conversations as the place seems to be always full. And in case Obama was dining no State Secrets would be revealed (Obama dined here with Michelle before exiting the WH).Food was truly amazing. The complimentary potato bread was very good. For appetizer, we shared the Beef Tartare ($18) with my boyfriend and loved the puffed farro that comes on top. He then had the Margherita pizza ($17) - even though I tried to convince him to try something else. The pizza was great, Marta level. I had the Little Gem Salad ($18) and loved it! Was afraid it would be too little, but the portion of avocado and ricotta salata was very filling. We wanted to save space for dessert, happy we did as we enjoyed the Labne Semifreddo with cherries and pistachios ($13).For wine we had the Rioja ""Viña Alberdi"", La Rioja Alta, 2010 ($69), following a nice conversation with the sommelier (which was nice to see was a female). Really enjoyed the wine and it is a 4.1 in Vivino. Another lovely Sunday evening in this neighborhood.

It is a little loud, but the seating is great so you can hear your party.   The service is perfect from the time you sit down until you walk out.  Started with the Sherry Painkiller which is a great coconut drink from the islands with a twist.  The duck wing appetizer is a great starter.  However, if you don't like spice it might not be for everyone   Finished the dinner with the Cheeseburger and it was amazing.  The fries were ok, I would change them out for a salad on my return. The apple pie dessert was super but switched out the ice cream for vanilla.  This was a wonderful lunch, but book your reservation on Open Table because walking up doesn't look possible.",,,

The restaurant decor and layout is great. We were seated at a very nice curved booth for four which is great for catching up (we were with my parents who were visiting from London). We got the customary mini loaf of bread (or two), which was great and a nice touch. I went for the lamb and bean dish. It was well presented and tasted great. Plus I was please to get a lamb dish.

The lighting set the perfect tone, the decor was beautiful and homey, and it was quite roomy. We started off with a few appetizers like the fried mushroom (deliciously light and crispy), grilled octopus salad, and fried duck wings (had a little kick!). I got the bucatini cacio e pepe which was amazing. The pasta was cooked just right and it wasn't too creamy or anything that would make you sick if you ate too much. My colleagues also got pasta dishes that they enjoyed as well. We topped off our meal with the milk and cookies which were three huge cookies that we were all able to share. Great food, great service and great ambiance. Would totally go again and recommend!",2,1,1
74,Alex S.,"Orem, UT",273,399,516,4.0,5/7/2017,"Another one of my friend's suggestions for while I was out here. I looked at a lot of the pictures here and I was a little skeptical (turns out not everyone on yelp can take great pictures). When we rolled up to this place I felt like I was in the typical upscale environment that New York restaurants everywhere seem to be replicating. Thankfully I like this type of look and it makes you feel warm and cozy.So how bout that food huh? Not so fast you glutton. The entry cocktail was delightful, as usual I do not remember its name but it was my favorite mix of sweet with a little kick of some random ingredient that I wouldn't be able to name.Burger - they only have one burger on the menu which... scared me a little. Because I was like am I being one of those idiots who just gets a burger because I am scared of other food? The answer is no, obviously, if you think I'm an idiot... it hurts, just a little. The burger was amazing. Two patties perfectly cooked with avocado, this delicious avocado sauce, cheese, and each bite was money... money... money. Topped off with a cute little Californian flag. Even New York knows what the best state in the union is. The Margherita Pizza - It is small but enough to fill up 1.25 people. This isn't a baby joke or anything just, don't try and split this with someone get something else. Sweet and salty from the tomatoes and mozzarella. Perfect crisp on the crust and everyone was happy.THE VERDICT:Another awesome New York establishment that is dealing out exactly what the people need. Now you might not be able to go here on the reg, but you definitely should try it if you ever have the chance. I felt just as high class as any person should while they are here. I was just missing the sports jacket. And the 150k salary a year.",4,3,2

76,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,4.0,5/21/2017,"Really liked Upland a lot. Dinging it a star because there were just a few dishes that were slightly below expectation and the price was a bit exorbitant, and the place was very loud. Other than that great meal.We started with the brussels, duck wings, and shishitos. The brussels were the bomb dot com. Only lightly cooked with some sliced chilis and citrus. Very very good. The duck wings were also good. Thing like chicken drumstick sized. Yum. The shishitos were meh. Not nearly salty enough, which you would think botarga would fix but that wasn't the case. They were just boring. Then we got the chicken liver pasta and the bronzino. The chicken liver pasta was outstanding. It was nice thick pasta, a little under cooked so it was still doughy. Yum. Perfect texture to hold all of that chicken liver which I love in literally any preparation. This one had chicken liver with butter and a whole bunch of parmesan cheese. I was in heaven. The bronzino for two was also awesome. It had a fennel leek vinaigrette with meyer lemon. Could have fooled me. It was this super buttery umami flavored preparation I've ever had. Tasted like there was hondashi all over it. Salty and unctuous. Also huge. They weren't kidding when they said it was for two. It was huge. Overall awesome meal. Some parts were slightly lacking, and I don't give five stars unless its perfect but i would definitely go back again. Also the prices, somewhat overstated for the quality but when someone else pays I'll let it slide :-)",2,,

78,Natalie C.,"Little Neck, NY",6,6,1,4.0,7/7/2018,"We were celebrating my husband's promotion, and decided on Upland after having a great experience at the Miami location while on vacation last year. We were seated promptly and received the booth we requested. Our server was a sweet girl, although she must have been new as she wasn't the most knowledgeable about the ingredients in the items on the menu. The manager, I assume that's who she was, kept coming over to make sure we were ok. The whole staff was very attentive to the tables and made sure our glasses were always full and our table was neat. The icing on the cake for me, was the manager congratulating my husband on his promotion as we walked out the restaurant! Loved that she paid attention to the Open Table notes. I've worked in customer service for over 10 years and this restaurant definitely tries to take the extra steps that are unfortunately rare these days.",,,
79,jac n.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",48,132,0,2.0,10/27/2018,"It wasn't terrible, but for NYC, it is subpar. Took a bit to get waters and menus and while our server was super nice he just wasnt around.The food was fine, but really lacked the right flavors. Chicken wings were one dimensional and needed sweetness, the pizza was essentially just a less good version of garlic bread and the tar tar was good but was not served with crackers or bread which was weird. I was also pretty disappointed that they don't have the burger during dinner--that was the entire reason we came. It's my bad for not checking, but when you're featured on multiple best of NYC burger lists, maybe offer the thing at dinner.",,,
80,David L.,"New York, NY",833,1138,1105,5.0,5/3/2018,"Upland is all kinds of wonderful... High-quality ingredients in comfortable surroundings...What made this one of the most pleasant meals I've had in a very long time -- three of my favorite food items (nduja, hen of the woods, and razorclams) beautifully prepared in generous portions in a beautiful environment (tall ceilings, large tables, lots of elbow room, wide aisles) & friendly service... Very simple, but all too rare, unfortunately, these days... With all of these amazing aspects, a lot of places would become affected and pretentious and inaccessible, but that is the antithesis of Upland; everything was very amenable & enjoyable, and to be honest I was actually completely surprised by the massive size of the main courses. For example, although nearly $40 for skirt steak definitely isn't cheap, there was a lot of it, and it was sensational, and the accompanying spreads and vegetables were similarly remarkable in quality and quantity. Same with the AMAZING gochujang bouillabaisse  Everything we had was fantastic, and I absolutely cannot wait to return when I head back home again.",1,,3

It was relatively empty when we first arrived, but people started arriving about 30 mins after we sat down.We shared the beef tartare to start, and then I got their estrella pasta with chicken liver, sherry, rosemary, and sage for my entree. The beef tartare didn't come with any bread, which we thought was strange. We asked our server if the dish came with bread, which he said it didn't, but he'd be happy to get us some grilled bread if we wanted. My estrella pasta was absolutely delicious - loved the combo of chicken liver, parmesan, and herbs!I highly recommend this place for lunch. If only they could open up in Vancouver...",,,

85,Moses A.,"Middleton, WI",2,69,120,1.0,8/12/2018,"We read the rave reviews of Upland's burgers, and that drew us there in the first place. As it turns out, burgers are strictly a lunch thing, and no exceptions are made. I suppose we could/should have called and asked for more details, but there are plenty of other things on the menu so we stayed. The little gem salad is, in fact, a little gem. The crab salad leaves a lot to be desired, and is served with an inedible deep-fried concoction (that to this day I can't identify, except by its dreadful flavor). One of us ordered the cod, which was rather bland (but as it turns out was the star of our three entrees). Another made the mistake of ordering a pizza, which arrived so overdone that half the crust was burnt and the rest of the pizza was dry as an old shoe sole.  The entree that left our table just the way it arrived was the Chicken--a dish described in great detail on the menu. Alas, the details don't mention that the chicken is literally infused with cilantro; not topped with it, but tasting entirely like cilantro. No mention of cilantro on the menu description (and this is an ingredient that some people love, and some people absolutely despise.) When our server took the virtually untouched plate from the table, he didn't bother asking whether there was a problem with it (or rather asking what the problem is, since no one pays $34 to have chicken brought to the table just to look at it and send it right back).  This was a really poor choice of restaurants in a city with many exceptional ones; the food was appalling and the server clearly not the diners' advocate to the kitchen. The person who manages Upland should be punished for the lack of oversight, preferably by being forced to eat that chicken.",1,,

The drink menu is well appointed with some good beers on tap, a good wine list, and a nice selection of cocktails. We ordered a few dishes scattered through the menu and shared them family style. They were all delicious. The duck wings and the sausage and kale pizza particularly stood out. The wait staff was fantastic the whole night. Very pleasant and helpful, and the pace of the meal was perfect, not rushed and not drawn out. I will definitely be back, probably for a special occasion",,,

91,Mike H.,"New York, NY",389,63,814,4.0,3/1/2017,"(This review is for brunch)Upland has a very posh looking decor with hundreds of jars and wine bottles on the wall. The restaurant is very nicely lit and very representative of the high end Manhattan life.Just like any other NYC brunch place, we had to wait a little bit before the four of us can get seated. But the weather was great so we didn't mind so much.The brunch menu is great, they serves some of the usual brunch items like pancake and egg benedict, but if you like savory food, they have pasta, hand-made pizza, and great burger if you are an avocado fan. Every plates we had are well seasoned and tasted great. The staff are really friendly and if they see you taking selfies, they will come over to ask if you need them to take it for you.Tips:+ Good place for family+ make reservation, or try the bar area which I believe is first come first serve",2,2,1

Every single entree was absolutely delicious!  I know this because I snuck a bite of everything.. The steak was so flavorful, medium, without being chewy.  My salmon was also very flavorful, and I cook good enough salmon that I rarely get it while out to eat.  But the duck dish stole the show.  Unlike many duck dishes (ok I rarely get it because it's usually so expensive) that I've had, this one had a great size serving!  We also got the broccolini as a veggie-- the char was great, but we each only got a couple of bites.  I would definitely recommend this as a special occasion kind of place!  It's a bit pricier than most nights out, but the food quality definitely is worth it.  And the view is spectacular!",1,1,1

The bread was warm - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and served with butter and herbs. For the main course we got the Pappardelle which was delicious - the spicy sausage ragù was cooked to perfection...a dish you can't go wrong with!! We also got the Creekstone Farms Skirt Steak which surprised me in the best way possible - the presentation was impeccable and it was cooked perfectly. Some of the best steak I've had and only for $36 compared to most steak houses where it would be slightly more expensive.

A must try) and falafel (A++)... then the bucatini (no complaints) and the upland ciopinno (50/50 ..the shrimp needs to be semi peeled for easy access to the sweet meat).   I would suggest maybe allowing a choice to thicken the broth and add a side of pasta that would be killer!   I almost forgot the potato bread it's amazing don't let a bite go to waste!!!!

101,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,4.0,1/5/2017,"I'm a little upset that it took me this long to discover Upland. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the casual, but elegant atmosphere was so inviting, despite it being packed for the New Year weekend brunch crowd. Add in the open kitchen concept, the entire basement devoted to having multiple restrooms, and that wine cellar - Upland is just absolutely gorgeous and by far one of the best ambiences I've experienced. A last minute decision to dine here, we had a 3 pm reservation, but couldn't wait that long to eat, so we walked in earlier at 12:30, attempting to get seats earlier. Unfortunately, all the tables were taken / reserved, but luckily 2 bar seats opened up the moment we walked in! Highly suggest you do that instead of wait an hour for a table as the bar seats do open up / turn around quick - within our hour of dining, half the bar seats opened up and were immediately filled. For my love for burgers and pizza, we ordered the kale & sausage pizza and the upland cheeseburger to share. For its $20 price tag, the pizza was well suited size wise. Taste wise, it was amazing. Somehow, the little pieces of sausage were so flavorful - think crispy brunt pieces, but they're not actually brunt. Another thing about the pizza that we enjoyed was how cheesy each slice was, without being overwhelming cheesy and overpowering for those non cheese lovers like us. Another Yelper had mentioned this pizza resembled an artichoke dip on dough - it definitely was! Each slice had multiple grab your phone, capture this pulling string action. The kale was crispy as well, but as a kale lover, I actually could have just ate the pizza without it as it didn't really do much for me. Now for the burger - easily one of the top 5 burgers I've had. It's one of those burgers you'll go back for when you crave a simple beefy burger done right. No overpowering sauce or salty toppings. Just a pure you can taste the quality of the beef plus slices of avocado to compliment it. Yes, you'll be wearing this burger's drippings on your hands / arms. The crispy and perfectly salted fries justify its $21 price tag - don't you just hate when a place up charges you $20+ on simply just a burger?! We all know you can't have a burger without fries. My only compliant is that I wish there was a more generous portion of the fries. It's a bad thing that I discovered Upland (bad for my boyfriend) because we'll definitely be somewhat regulars!",1,,3

Others may enjoy it more, just wasn't my ""cup of tea"". Husband ordered a pasta (I'll have to get the name). But it was okay. Oh yes we ordered duck wings for an appetizer. They came out pretty quick but I just can't get with duck. My husband enjoyed them, though they weren't the best duck ever. We were told this is a popular item there, so you may like you may not. I can't really say. It's an ""acquired taste"". The restaurant is very warm and welcoming for a high end pricey spot. Was busy enough to not be too stuffy. Glass ware was certainly on the high end side and everything was clean. Lighting was also dim, which I appreciate at night. The tables are a little close to each other, which I notice a lot in recent visits to restaurants, but I do not necessarily care for being this close to my neighbors. It looks like a great place to have a date or go out with friends for wine and drinks. Really nice atmosphere and I believe the food is good if this fits your pallet, expect to spend more than $50 each on a full meal.",1,,

Currants and heat didn't harmonize as I expected. Abundance of viscous oil overshadowed the fish, made this unenjoyable (their new Crudo has Meyer lemon and cashew..hopefully for the better)BUCATINI CACIO È PEPEThis, THIS, will be my last meal on earth. From the first bite, I was amazed. Sumptuous. The cheese is artfully done, perfectly melted and crumbled cheese, butter & salt; fresh ground pepper add to it a vivacious SPARK. Upland chose the perfect pasta to complement its Cacio e Pepe variant; a bucatini with a canal running through the middle catching that pepper and those cheese crumbles. This, IS GROWN UP MAC N CHEESE. The textural contrast of the al dente pasta with the creamy sauce is DIVINE. And fresh shaved pecorino catapults this dish in the stratosphere.

Our server was friendly and was always checking in on us.Cons:The food.  I'm wondering why the reviews rave about the food. Am I missing something here?  Let me start:5 lettuce Caesar salad. I like the idea behind a ""5 lettuce"" Caesar but the flavors were all over the map. I didn't know the star of the dish. The problem was the different types of lettuce had different flavors and they were competing with each other and the dressing. And the flavors didn't mesh well together. The salad itself was under-dressed....as in, there wasn't enough dressing on the salad!  Gnocchi.  The gnocchi was cooked in a way that the outside was crispy.  It was strange...I've never had it that way.  It was good....just different.  I liked the sauce too but I didn't like the Gnocchi and the sauce together.  I think Gnocchi is best served in a butter or cream sauce.  Overall the components of the dish were good...but put together is was....strange.Duck.  I had this for the main course. It was ok.  Parts of my duck were cold. Not warm, but literally cold.  And it came with a white type of cream sauce. Belch.My husband had the pork belly with beans.  The dish was good, but his pork belly was overcooked.We opted out of the $14 cookies.  $14 bucks for cookies. No way.The cappuccino was good.  So, that was a shining moment.Oh, and the portion sizes were outrageously big.  I was disappointed.  And I'm pissed I spent $250 bucks on that meal.

We didn't make a reservation but were seated at a table for 4 without much wait as long as we were able to leave in an hour and a half before the next party arrived. (They weren't pushy at all though when we lingered a bit.) The waiters were nice and helpful. The menu can definitely be pretty pricey, but my friends and I ordered pizza and pasta, which are the cheaper dinner options. I personally shared the green zebra pizza and chicken liver Estrella. (About $20 each) The green zebra is a white pizza with green tomatoes and fabulous. Their pizzas taste super fresh, and the bread is great. We weren't sure what pasta to get, and the waiter recommended either the Estrella or pappardelle because they're both homemade pastas. I went with the Estrella because I don't like spicy and the pappardelle had spicy sausage. The pasta dish was great, very good portion size, soft and fresh, and the chicken liver was ample as well. Also the bread and butter they give you before the meals is super soft and delicious :) they will give you more if you ask too. Overall, atmosphere is also SO CUTE. They have jars of lemons all across the walls that are backlit, and the place is super cute, sleek, and romantic but also good for groups. Will definitely be coming back!

Nice atmosphere and full house.A couple appetizers were ordered to share around the table of 6 as starters. I actually can't really remember any of them that well which means I wasn't really too impressed. It was something along the lines of a salad, some sort of pizza or bread focused appetizer and couple other things.For my dinner, I ordered a glass of their Malbec to enjoy with my Wagyu Steak dinner. My Wagyu was 100 dollars for the dish. I loved the marbling since I'm a huge fan of fat but the steak wasn't very tender and on the chewier side. I think the problem was that I didn't think it through and got it rare. Should have gotten it medium rare to enjoy the fuller potential of the steak. I loved the garnishes that came with the steak. I say garnish because the side accompaniments were pretty small but it matched really well with the steak in flavor that it stood out to me. Just wish there were more greens incorporated into the meal to make it more balanced in a crunchier texture. I wouldn't say the meal in itself is filling for a 100 bucks but then again I'm paying for the wagyu. If you don't mind spending money, I would recommend this dish and it would definitely leave you room to crave their desserts which were on point. Theres a ridiculous amount of restaurants in NY, but majority are not even decent. I'd say this place is worth checking out.",,,1

The atmosphere is my favorite thing about this place, and I would say it's probably one of my favorites in the city. It feels like... well, it feels like a few different things, all odder than the next, so please don't judge me. It feels like: a bar in a fancy spaceship (y'know, one that would try and recreate natural light for Vitamin-D deprived people), a bar inside a sunrise, and a bar outside the gates of heaven (this is based on the color palate). There's just something lush about that yellow, gold, and wood combination that floods the senses in the best way possible. It feels dark, but warm and comforting. It feels bright, but moody. Maybe I just need a backlit wall of jarred lemons in my house. Maybe it's the winter in Maine induced seasonal affective disorder speaking. Whatever it is... I like it. - Downland1. Ugh. The overwhelming odor of fish.2. The service was so slow. Though she was friendly, our bartender seemed more interested in talking to the other bartenders then actually making our drinks.

Given the stellar reputation and the incredible looking menu, we decided to throw all caution to the wind and play ""menu roulette"" or ""waiters choice"" where we put all of our faith in our waiter, Woo, minus a few requested exclusions. This turned out to be a high-reward for the high-risk strategy, as Woo completely nailed it! Literally delivered 8 for 8 perfect choices across a 3-course dining experience. Starting with the Little Gem, Local heirloom, & Striped bass crudo, we were off to a running start. Each of which were inventive and delicious. Next up, the pasta course with Cacio e Pepe, Spaghetti Vongole, & Ricotta Gnudi which were each unique and mouth-wateringly tasty.

I do that thing on dates where we share everything. So I guess I was a vegetarian that night. The space feels big but intimate. The yellow lights made things almost golden, including this girl's hair. We sat at the bar and ordered the Green Zebra pizza and a salad. The back bar had a bunch of bottles on it that I don't know. The bartender, I think his name was Elliot, said they were Amaro. I'm still not sure what that is but now that I think of it I will google it.Amaro is an Italian herbal liqueur that is commonly drunk as an after-dinner digestif. It usually has a bitter-sweet flavour, sometimes syrupy, and has an alcohol content between 16% and 40%. I'll try that next time. My phone was about to die but I was informed the host stand will charge it for you. They gave me a ticket like a coat check.

A little pricey at $21, but it was worth trying. The patties are thin so they come a bit overcooked. Not typically a fan of American cheese on burgers, but if that's your thing, it's cool. Also has avocado on it. I've seen it listed on some best burgers lists.

The bread was too hard and lacked in flavor. French fries on the side were great.Service:1) Server forgot to bring out the grilled chicken addition to the salad.

Updated review","Came back for brunch, this time with the rents. Perhaps my expectations were too high - the waitress at my previous dinner here had told me to make sure to come back for brunch - but the brunch food and experience felt completely flat compared to the fantastic dinner I had enjoyed few months before.We ordered the smoked salmon pizza, porchetta and egg sandwich, and the Upland burger:The smoked salmon pizza was..interesting. The first slice was fun for exploring smoked salmon on your brunch pizza. But after that, the flavor got old and there was no savoriness, or 'umami', I guess, to make us reach for the next bite.The porchetta and egg sandwich was cooked well and looked pretty on the plate (I asked for greens instead of fries). While the pork and egg combo tasted great, the bread had too much butter and spread, and started to get too soggy. Also, the pathetically dried up pieces of arugula limped off the sandwich every time I bit into the sandwich. Upland burger was probably the best of the three dishes, though still not memorable. Each layer of the burger was individually good - bun was well-toasted, patty cooked medium rare, veggies fresh, avocado a wonderful addition - but the holistic burger experience was just not there! Recommend this dish if you are at Upland for brunch, but it's not mind blowing.Nevertheless, service was impeccable and ambiance lovely. Would come back again for dinner, but can think of many other places worth my time and wallet for brunch.",1,1,2

We will definitely go back for that again. We got almost everything on the dessert menu. I love the refreshing sorbet which came in grapefruit, pineapple and lemon flavors.

Lovely staff. We got a few salads and a the garlic white pizza to start. Those were fresh and yummy as was the starter bread.  I got the Amish Chicken entree for a main and it was dry and needed salt. The accompanying salad was good however the description said ""zucchini"" but I got one thin slice in my salad.  My friends got the steak and they enjoyed their steak, especially the romesco sauce.The chocolate mousse cake we got for dessert was really good. The cookies and milk were okay. The cookies were a bit dry as well.I think there are better restaurants in this price range.",,,

153,ChingWa C.,"Manhattan, NY",140,164,271,4.0,1/7/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our move to NY. Like what Wendy L. had mentioned, this place indeed offers an elegant and inviting atmosphere. The restuarant wasn't so crowded when we went (Saturday night at around 7). I didn't order a cocktail because I didn't feel like drinking, as usual. I was a little confused about who our waiter was, because there was this one waiter that greeted us after we sat down, and he also kinda went through the menu with us. But he never came back to take our order or to refill our water............ However, he did serve the other tables   around us well. Well, whatever.For appetizer, we ordered the crispy mushroom. It's definitely good for two / three people. Half way through us two sharing the mushroom, I was a little full. The mushroom was so good! I love the crispiness of the top (didn't like the bottom part so much). It almost tasted like chips. After that we had the Estrella, which is pasta mixed with chicken liver. I ordered it because I saw a lot of pictures of that on Yelp. My suggestion is, if you don't like the texture of chicken liver or any animal liver, don't get it. I don't like the texture of it, and have never liked it .... and still got it anyway. It was ok, the taste of it wasn't too strong. I would rather get the pasta with sausage. Lastly, we ordered the duck. I don't know if it's because we questioned the waiter how big of the portion of this duck would be, when the server placed the dish on the table, we were astound by the portion size. It was massive, but my boyfriend enjoyed the dish a lot. It was a little too fattening, the taste was ok. I think the food here is ok, but the atmosphere of this place is perfect for a semi formal occasion.",2,1,2

I was not disappointed!The ambiance in here is awesome--dim lighting but not too dim, with a lit-up back wall and bar. As for the food, my boyfriend and I shared the little gem salad (great but nothing out of the ordinary) and the whole crispy mushroom (aka ""hen of the woods""), which was a delicious and pretty hearty, too. Definitely get the mushroom! For dinner, he had the skirt steak (I tried a bite and it was delicious) and I got the kale and sausage pizza, which was great, too.

It is the most clever design, with high gloss paneled walls and hundreds of jars of pickled lemons on brass shelves with light shining through them. It creates the most amazing glow and this space wins best restaurant design ever. Servers are cool, friendly and so on top of things. The menu is full of large plates for sharing. Our starter salad actually served the whole table! We started out with that and one of their pizzas. Everyone got plenty. For entrees we got the Cacio e Pepe (of course), the duck (perfectly prepared rare) and a chicken liver pasta (yes!) that was otherworldly. We were stuffed and happy. Coffee and dessert rounded out the awesome experience. Honestly I will be here at least one night every time I come to New York!",,,1

157,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1044,25538,4.0,1/25/2016,"Upland has been on my ""to eat"" list for quite some time now. I remember when they were the new kid on the block and NY Times mentioned that Upland's owner and impresario in chief was Stephen Starr - the man behind restaurants such as Morimoto and Buddakan. Upland feels fancy, without feeling sterile or unwelcoming. The back of the bar has shelves with perfectly lined up jars filled with preserved lemons. Each jar sits in front of three tiny LEDs lights and the effect given is one of a very warm and glowing wall. The way it illuminates both the bar and main dining room is unique, creative and beautiful. Plus the way it plays with the copper trimmings of the bar and other decorative pieces around the tables is nothing short of stunning. I was beyond excited to finally have the opportunity to check Upland out when a business lunch came up and we needed to pick a nearby restaurant suitable to talk shop. I work across the street from Upland and having already been disappointed by Park Avenue Spring/Winter/Summer/Fall and recently-ish enjoyed Hillstone, my coworker and I decided on Upland since neither of us had been.The menu here is simple, but solid. Upland's chef, Justin Smillie, really liked to play around with Italian flavors but create dishes inspired by classic urbane Californian cuisine staples (unfortunately not San Diego-an cuisine, no burritos with french fries in em' here kids! Lol). They boast a very worldly 500-bottle wine list (with several of them being priced at $50 and below, which is impressive given the caliber of this restaurant), but I enjoyed a simple glass of white to go with my light and classic pasta dish.My coworker enjoyed their Grilled Chicken Sandwich (came served with brussel petals, parmigiano + dijonnaise), my business associate from another company absolutely loved his Upland Cheeseburger (this is only cooked well-done because the burger itself is composed of 2 rather thin patties - all grass fed beef with melted American cheese, peppadew peppers, fresh chopped greens and avocado).I went with their Bucatini Cacio e Pepe which came with a generous amount of pecorino romano cheese and black pepper. Cacio e Pepe is such a simple, yet light dish (which I've also made successfully myself with regular spaghetti) but with bucatini (also known as perciatelli, is a thick spaghetti-like pasta with a hole running through the center) is was even better. This isn't a pasta type that I often see in restaurants and while the portion size initially looks like it could be better, it's a very dense and filling type of strand pasta and it was cooked absolutely perfectly al dente.Service here was warm, friendly and efficient. Everything about my dining experience here was flawless...except that I was too full to have a go at their desert menu. I look forward to coming back here again soon because their Roasted Porchetta + egg sandwich has my name all over it and so does their brunch menu :).",4,1,1

For food, started with the doughnuts and they were fresh and had yummy toppings but not sure if they were $10 good. Our mains were the burger and salted cod/eggs. Again, just ok. Nothing too stellar or outstanding. My neighbor also ordered the burger and hers looked great. Very tall, meaty, and loaded with veggies. Mine did not. Definitely some quality control issues. We saw our main waiter a total of three times. Thankfully, they have people who refill water and coffee (you're lucky if you get a refill on this one though).

The cacio e pepe is the best I've had (dare I say, I enjoyed it more than Lilia's). I hate pizza, but the sausage and kale pizza was perfection and won me over. The crust had just the right amount of chew and salt. The estrella chicken liver pasta was scrumptious. If I had to choose a ""weakest"" course, I'd say it was dessert but the dessert is definitely worth ordering here. We tried the labne semifreddo, which reminded me of an icy, greek yogurt-y cheesecake with a fantastic pistachio crust and cherries on top. The cookie plate came with three cookies-- hobnob biscuit (reminds me of a brown butter oatmeal cookie), chocolate chip, and a brown sugar (tasted like a snickerdoodle). It's hard to mess up warm cookies and milk-- easy crowd pleaser. Portions were generous for upscale dining. Service was excellent. The restaurant is warm and cozy with rose gold decor. The crowd is dressy casual, mostly suits at lunch, but certainly not stuffy. It's impressive for a date spot or nice dinner out. It's not too loud, so you can hear everyone at your table.

After 15 min on the phone with various people we were refunded the money for the dinner we didn't eat and informed that they had ""no idea"" where our card was.  Unreal.  We are super understanding about stuff usually, but they clearly didn't care in the least that our experience was totally abysmal and didn't even attempt to make things right.

170,bruce s.,"Englewood, NJ",33,403,16,2.0,3/11/2018,"Our party of 6, including myself, enjoyed Upland more than my two star rating reflects. But upon conclusion of the meal, none of us were talking about the nice service, cool vibe or pleasant meal as much as each of us were about how heavy handed the chef was in salting each dish. Nothing was inedibly salty but at the same time, the taste of salt seemed to permanently and take over each dish ordered. We started off sharing the pizza (good but not great, a bit soggy and overwhelming garlic taste) and a bunch of other appetizers including two different pasta dishes. Everything seemed a bit rushed in how they arrived together (pasta was asked to be a separate course) but no single dish disappointed anyone. My entree was the lamb and was a solid good. Everyone else at our table also were pleased with their entree as well. We occasionally complain about over salted food when we dine out, and, when I remember, request 'no added salt' when ordering, but this was really unlike anything any of us remember elsewhere. Not sure why chefs feel the need frankly and fail to allow the taste of the dishes ingredients to shine more on their own.Btw, the bread served was amazing.",,,

Ordered their signature dish, hen of the woods and it was bland, so bland that we couldn't finish eating it. Also ordered the shishito peppers. How can you screw up shishito peppers, right? Drown them in bottarga. Who knew. Also ordered mortadella pizza. Except, no one told us that it comes covered in shaved fennel. Fennel is not listed as one of the ingredients on this pizza. Fennel is way too strong of an ingredient to not disclose. And the pistachio pesto was overwhelming even with the fennel all plucked off.

Updated review","I had to come back to write an updated review as I recently went back for my dad's birthday and my experience was a bit disappointing. Service was not up to the standards that it has been that past couple times I've been here. He was inattentive and all over the place. He never asked us if we needed anything else and we had to constantly flag him down for more water. For the food. we ordered the fluke as an app, the lobster spaghetti and cacio e pepe and the ribeye and duck for mains. The fluke sashimi was delicious as was the lobster spaghetti and cacio e pepe. The wagyu ribeye was the huge disappointment. For 95$, I expected this dish to be for two and have more than 5 pieces of meat and a sprinkle of the salad. I understand its wagyu but I don't think this is acceptable. I highly recommend NOT getting this dish as the meat was not even out of this world. It actually was chewy and kind of tough. Definitely not what I was expecting after paying 95$ for one dish. It still bothers me that I paid for that dish... so please listen to me and do not order that dish! Lastly, the semi-freddo and hazelnut budino desserts were also not memorable. I should've just ordered the cookies again... I still love this place and most likely will be back but this past experience was just very disappointing so I had to come and knock a star off...",,,

Make a reservation before you come!Ordered the doughnuts which were clearly just fried and delicious. My favorite was the almond. Also had the porchetta sandwhich with the fried egg which I would totally recommend. It was so good. The guindilla chilies that were pickled added a nice sour spicy flavor. The menu says that there's arugula on it but there was only 1 piece of arugula on the plate. Was still so tasty that I goblbled it up.,,,

PROS:- Bill Pay Buck cocktail $15 [Tito's Handmade Vodka, Aperol, Ginger, Lime] - probably the best thing I had the whole meal. I really like the ginger and lime in the drink. 4 STARSTHE OKAY:- Sausage + Kale Pizza $19 (young pecorino, stracciatella + parmigiano) - The cheese is very strong. One thing I didn't like about this pizza was that the SAUSAGE was very DRY. I do not recommend getting this. 3 STARS- Crispy Duck Wings $18 (lemon, olive oil + yuzu kosho) - there are only 3 pieces. If you want 4 duck wings its $24. It was definitely very crispy however I think the Asians make the duck better because 1) its juicier 2) its more moist. The duck wings here are a bit on the dry side. 3.5 STARSCONS:- OVERPRICED for mediocre food. - The guy who led us to our seats forgot to give us our lunch menu. He only offered us the drinks menu.

It could have used some topping, however I am so grateful I had the chicken on top. The chicken might have been the best I have ever had with being super moist and juicy, the small amount of skin they gave you added a delicious crunch.

The space is beautiful and modern with high ceiling and an open layout - very different from the usual dark, narrow NYC restaurants. - whole crispy mushroom: hen of the woods, cloumage + herbs ($18)- seared squid: fennel + orange ($19)- bucatini cacio e pepe: pecorino romano + black pepper ($19)- estrella: chicken liver, sherry, rosemary + sage ($21)- atlantic halibut: summer squash, seabeans, meyer lemon butter + crispy shallot ($36)- grilled long island duck: nectarines, whipped gorgonzola + savory granola ($36)All were relatively traditional and well executed. We especially enjoyed the crispy mushroom, the duck, and the bucatini.",1,1,2
187,Allison G.,"Jersey City, NJ",20,23,0,5.0,2/7/2018,"Came here for date night. I wanted to try everything on the menu! The homemade bread was outstanding, with a salty crust on top, and our server was excellent--just attentive enough without being overbearing. I had a tasty tomato-based seafood stew and their twist on caesar salad, both of which were done very well. Salad was enormous, however, so I'd recommend maybe getting that with an appetizer as a full meal (rather than as a ""starter"").",,,
188,Kat M.,"Washington, DC",2,8,0,5.0,8/23/2017,"I spent the past four years in Philadelphia, where I developed a taste for many of Stephen Starr's restaurants across the city (especially Fette Sau and the Continental Midtown). My first time at Upland was a summer Thursday at 8:15pm with a party of six. The restaurant was buzzing and gorgeous.The bread and butter served before dinner was beyond delicious. Many of us agreed it was the best bread we have ever had, or close to it. The group got a variety of pizzas and pastas - all good. No wrong choices here.There is something really special about being treated to the level of service and care they have at Upland, from the cooks in the back to the attentive front of house staff. Upland is an essential New York night out for those who care about being taken care of.",,,
189,Pearce D.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,173,489,4.0,2/15/2016,"Great atmosphere and food- will need to go back to try out some more...Got the Bucatini, Crispy Mushroom and Brussel Sprout pizza, octopus and Duck wings. Had been excited for the mushroom but was a bit underwhelmed with it- it's essentially just a big, baked mushroom. The best of the food by far was the duck wings- super tender with a ton of flavor. Can't believe more places don't have these. There's certainly other better Pizza/Pasta type restaurants that also aren't as expensive (ex Otto) but Upland does provide a nice twist.",,,
190,Dan P.,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",146,287,439,5.0,6/24/2017,"Lunch solo  - ""new American cooking"". Great space, friendly service, all around the kind of place I'd love to come to regularly. The food - hearty, rustic, and still very creative.One of the best beef tartares I think I've ever had - flavored with black trumpet mushrooms and anchovies, topped with puffed farro, and an egg yolk. Spicy, tangy, yum - I could eat that again and again. Glass of Evesham Woods Pinot Noir 2014 from the Willamette Valley to accompany lunch.And, an order of ""crispy duck wings"" - each the drumstick of the wing, three of them, as big as a chicken leg. Tender, probably confited, coated in a spicy, peppery crust and then shocked with a good amount of yuzu, the Japanese citrus. A complete wow - I was nibbling those bones down to the nub, in fact asked the waiter to take the plate away before I ate the bones themselves.",,,1

Updated review",Upland used to be a star in the causal dinning scene in NYC but lately it's going the way of many corporate establishments with too many of units. The consistency of the product and service are suffering from the lack of professional onsite management.  That being said if you arrive at the right time of day and day of the week and stick to their strong dishes you can still have an an enjoyable experience.   If you want anything fried arrive early in the service.  Stay any from the Cacio e Pepe it's just not good.  The Pizza is great as well as the other pastas.  The duck wings and the hen of woods should disappoint anyone with taste buds ..lol. Steaks and Burgers are great but skip the fries.   Hopefully some adults that own and manage the corporation will read this and take action.  It would be a shame to watch Upland descend to the low lands.,,,
192,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,8/31/2015,"A solid place in the landscape of the Flatiron restaurants. When I first came here a few months ago for a business lunch, I had a great experience and I recently came back for a Friday leisure lunch. Upland has a great modern, upscale feel, and as someone who's somewhat OCD about order and symmetry, the rows of jars of smoked mozzarella and wine bottles lining the walls really appealed to me. Maybe a little too much. The menu focuses mostly on fresh Italian, with a bit of American and even Asian flair here and there. The Upland burger is one of the better double-patty burgers I've had in a while. You would think that two patties would be a little too overwhelming, but they use thinner patties, which was great, and with the toppings (avocado/peppers) and crispy shoestring fries, it's one of the better burgers I've had in the city. It's on the steeper side at $20, but overall, a satisfying meal, especially for lunch. You shouldn't come out of your way here for it, but it's a good choice for an above-average burger.This past visit, we went a little deeper into the menu, sharing the duck wings and the sausage and kale pizza. The duck wings weren't very pretty, since they looked kinda like half-eaten drumsticks, but the meat, which was seasoned with yuzu and lemon, was very tender and delicious, with that rich flavor that only duck has. The sausage and kale pizza was great too, as the richness of the sausage paired really well with the bitterness of the roasted kale. Moreover, the crust of the pizza was crispy and hot, and the cheese quotient was just right. Better than the a lot of the pizza/flatbreads I've had at actual pizza joints.In general, the prices are a bit higher, but you can be assured that the preparation and choice of ingredients are better than most, so personally, I can let it slide. The service is pretty efficient, but not really particularly warm or friendly. The waitstaff seems very focused on churning out as many table services as possible. That being said, I've always had a good experience, so it's absolutely fine. The place is often busy, so I'm sympathetic to the need to multi-task, provided the overall level of service doesn't suffer as a result. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice lunch and I'll definitely be back to try the dinner offerings and the cocktail menu.",14,10,13
193,Lea D.,"West New York, NJ",55,11,0,1.0,12/3/2017,"Went to Upland for brunch with my fiancé for our anniversary. We found the ambience and service to be pleasant however the food was terrible (and definitely over priced). We ordered two dishes.. the eggs from hell and the fritata and both were extremely salty. We also got a side of fries which were actually really good. After paying almost $80 for brunch it's shame when u leave hungry (ie, we didn't eat our food). Definitely will not be coming back and would not recommend this place (at least not for brunch).",1,,
194,Brad W.,"New York, NY",367,245,492,5.0,7/23/2017,"Truly one of the best restaurants in Manhattan and the country. Making a reservation is totally the move, but, on the Sunday night I went, it wouldn't have been much of an issue. Great cocktail menu. To start, the potato bread is delicious. Next, our margherita pizza was super good. My friend and I loved our entrees (octopus and the cacio e pepe) and left Upland raving about how delicious of a meal we had. As they are up for a Beard award, make your reservations ASAP.",,,

197,Danielle R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,9/21/2017,"I went to Upland for brunch with a friend on 9/14. This is my third time dining here (the first two times I went for dinner)Scene / Atmosphere: I absolutely love the atmosphere at Upland. The interior is lined by shelf after shelf of preserved lemon jars, each illuminated by lights. It gives off a light warmer than anything I've ever seen in a restaurant. Truly unique.Drinks: My friend got a Bloody Mary and I got this super refreshing ginger, lime, soda and vodka cocktail. Food: We both got the Eggs in Hell, which was amazing and I got a side of bacon, which was incredible. Service: The service is always great at Upland. Very attentive and knowledgable staff. Price: Typical for brunch and then dinner is obviously more expensive.  Overall: I'd recommend Upland to anyone for dinner and brunch. The combination of the California and Italian influences and the beautiful ambiance make for a wonderful dining experience.",,,
198,Jason L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,7,7,4.0,3/3/2018,"Crispy duck wings are my new thing! It was interesting I first thought those were some big a$$ chicken wings because I wasn't the one who ordered food. I was just stunned for 5 seconds after the first bite--the skin was so crunchy and flavorful.        Duck was tasty and moist too, but to be honest, all the money is at the skin. The Margherita pizza was also great. Bartenders were pleasant. I went there with my guys just for drinks at the bar so not much to say about the table service. Will definitely come back for a whole dinning experience and more of those duck wings.",,,
199,Bonnie M.,"South Pasadena, CA",0,39,30,5.0,2/14/2018,"Didn't have time to take a photo, as we were a group, but every dish we ordered, eating family style, was incredible. We ordered the hand of the woods mushrooms which are deep-fried and come with a side of cream sauce that complemented and balance the dish. We also ordered the simple pasta because you know and black pepper as well as the margarita pizza and roasted carrots. We are meat eaters but the meat wasn't missed because the flavor was so good. This will be a new New York go to restaurant for us on our next trip to the city.",,,
