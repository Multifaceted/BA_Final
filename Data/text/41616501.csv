0,Leila G.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",459,298,60,4.0,8/21/2018,Not a whole lot one can say about argo tea... It's pretty standard. The high ceilings are nice and it is a solid place to get work done. I almost always find a place to sit. Once there was an origami club meeting there and that's pretty cool.,,,
1,Sara H.,"Englewood, NJ",10,306,857,3.0,11/13/2018,"Great place to sit down to and take a sip a drink. (The establishment is pretty spacious considering that it's located within the city.)(Just as a heads up, Argo tea is a cashless store - make sure you have your credit cards!)The establishment offers abundant drinks with options of being served both warm and cold. The service was very friendly but extremely slow. Though there were only 1 person in front of me, it took them over 6 minutes to order my drinks. Additionally,  the store is not really maintained cleaned. The condition of the tables was unsanitary.",1,,
2,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,3.0,11/5/2018,"I've been here a bunch of times over the years and my experience has been pretty consistent. The teas themselves are pretty good. They have a large variety of both hot and cold, sweet and non sweet teas so, no matter what you are looking for, there is likely to be an option for you.I've tried a variety of their flavors and have always enjoyed my tea. However, I find that they are often out of some flavors, especially when it's a seasonal flavor.They have small snacks and pastries here too. I have only tried them twice and both times were decent enough. The matcha muffin was my favorite.As far as the staff goes, it's hit and miss. Some people are incredibly friendly and make the experience great, others look like they really don't want to be here.They do let you stay a while with your drink while you work, which is always a plus for me.",,,
3,Henry M.,"New York, NY",490,188,838,4.0,1/2/2018,"CASHLESS. Argo Tea does NOT take cash anymore, so you must pay by plastic or phone. They really incentivize you to use their phone app, where you could join their loyalty program. After drinking a certain amount of drinks, you get $5 credit after a certain number of drinks or gifts.They really try to make it customer friendly for people who stay at the place. For the regular teas they have on the menu, you could get refills by having the tea served in a mug. Refills are $1, which is a real steal. They also provide sample drinks, but usually two flavors. The cookies are to die for. Great way for a mid-afternoon study break or tea time. This is Argo Tea after all. Staff is generally nice and if you go there enough they might even recognize you by name. Great place to mill around when it rains, avoid the extreme cold/heat, or to just hang around. Note: some of the outlets do not work.",1,,

8,M M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,109,0,2.0,8/4/2018,"I went here (and one of their other stores) to buy loose leaf tea.  Argo should not sell loose leaf tea because it's hard to find someone in the store to help you and to help you properly.To buy loose tea you stand on the same line as you do to order a hot or cold drink.  The problem is, when you get to the register, it means someone has to leave the counter to help you because the loose tea is not sold at the register, it is at a display a mile away from the cashiers and the worker's are not so trilled to do this. They say, OK, give me a minute, I'll be right there as they shoo you back to the loose tea display/case, which b t w, is a nightmare in and of itself, especially the stupid way the scale is placed.  So nearly five minutes later this guy comes over and I ask him for 1/4 lb of the hibiscus apple tea and he opens the canister and there is none in there to be sold.  He says he has to go downstairs to see if he has any more.  WTF, don't you check your stock and inventory regularly enough to know you have no hibiscus tea to sell ?  When he finally comes back with the tea, he now has to 'load' it into the display, that's another three minutes, then he can't remember I said 1/4 lb, so he asked me three times, finally scoops the goods into the bag, weighs it and sends me back to the register.  What I did notice is that it looked as though the hibiscus and the apple had separated, as one must be heavier or thinner than the other.  I did not think much of this, but it had negative effects on the taste which I note below.Paid and left.  The guy never checked off the brewing instruction boxes on the bag.  Now I had to add more time to this and go on line to see how they suggest the hibiscus be brewed.  When I finally got around to making a pot of tea, it was clear that this bag contained 99% hibiscus and virtually no apple.  I guess he never mixed the goods before scooping them out for me.  As I said earlier it appeared that the hibiscus and the apple had separated in the canister it's dispensed from.  I buy loose tea at two other places in the city.  I've been pretty satisfied with them for years.  I thought I'd give ARGO a try, but I've been sadly disappointed.",,,
9,Becky S.,"Columbus, OH",93,73,134,5.0,8/5/2017,"Really cool tea chain that rivals Starbucks. Has a relaxing atmosphere and they use loose leaf tea and nata de coco (instead of tapioca) in their boba. Would go back just for the nata de coco - it has a chewy texture that breaks apart within 5 chews and feels somewhat healthier than tapioca. They also offer sample teas in the front which is an awesome marketing technique and also made me, the customer, very happy. The chai was delicious!",,,
10,Big M.,"New Rochelle, NY",49,40,3,4.0,4/15/2018,Mojitea with seltzer.  Sooooo good.  Super nice server who suggested the drink and even offered to take it back if I didn't like it.  Clean place with good vibes.  I'd go back.,,,
11,Alysha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,94,77,5.0,1/6/2018,Love the selection on this place's menu. Many of their drinks are vices you can't find at any ol coffee shop or even Starbucks. Good environment with plenty of space to sit (in new york that's a hot commodity) and work or charge your phone or what have you. Definitely would recommend!,,,

I pulled up my LevelUp app when I noticed the sticker on the storefront, and was excited to see a $5 free credit waiting for me. I ordered a hot Matcha Vanilla latte (a Teappuccino), since it sounded warm and comforting. It was both of those things, but definitely a little heavy, which I wasn't hoping for, as I was already pretty full It came out to be free with the LevelUp credit, and I got a bathroom code and wifi code, too. I found a seat by the door, which was this awkward seating with your backside on display through the glass window behind you.The conveniently later hours than the coffee shops around, fast wifi and the LevelUp credit were what drew me to Argo Tea. It's definitely not bad, with some interesting teas, but nothing extraordinary.",1,,
15,Sammy G.,"Manhattan, NY",26,132,64,2.0,10/5/2017,Extremely under staffed.Came in here around 4pm today and there was a HUGE line with ONE staff making the drinks/taking orders. Ridiculous. It took a good 6 minutes to get my drink. Unacceptable coming from a chain store.,2,,

20,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",399,484,1233,4.0,2/24/2017,"I LOVE tea. Some more than others. There are several tea parlors around NYC and surrounding boroughs but still not enough. For instance, there should be more Argo locations since Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are on every corner/block. But there aren't.I've been to  this Argo location many times.The staff are always very knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions regarding their  tea but also about my own particular preference. I don't like anything super sweet or containing so many calories that it qualifies as a meal.I've ordered many hot and cold versions at Argo tea cafes and was always satisfied. I particularly like their feature teas (located on the wall) since I can have them sugar and calorie free. Argo has many delicious tea varieties (and small bites) and their prices are reasonable.Now, we just need to see more around town.",,,
21,Nhi D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",277,202,416,4.0,4/25/2018,"At this location, Argo Tea seems to exclusively serve NYU students. There's always be a line! And Download the Tapingo app to order your drinks beforehand(esp if you're an NYU student because the app allows you to pay by dining dollars)Argo Tea serves high-quality teas from around the globe. Although it's not cheap, I know I'm paying for the prime quality. Earl Grey Creme is my absolute favorite. I almost always order this drink everytime I pass by Argo Tea. Although it's not sweetened, I can taste a hint of sweetness of vanilla. In the winter, I have it hot. In the summer, I add ice and a splash of skim milk. A perfect subtle drink to soothe my thirst. Argo Tea also offers coconut bubble as topping but I want to keep my drinks simple and healthy; otherwise, I'd just go to Boba Guys which is a block away haha! Greentea Strawberry is another great option for anyone who's looking for a natural(but not at all bland)cup of tea :)I always order my drinks to-go, as this is clearly not a quiet study place for me!",,,
22,Tina C.,"Merrick, NY",18,122,394,3.0,9/10/2016,"This place used to bigger and better back in the days when it included the moleskin store space. They used to feature more variety of local artworks and there were so many tables to sit. Nowadays it's a mad rush for a seat. They do have wifi (password is on the receipt) and outlets are available through the tables and walls. I bought their English breakfast loose tea, it was good. I've had a few of their signature drinks; I feel like they are a hit or a miss. My streak with them has not been that great. I come here for the vegan green tea muffins. Once I branched out my repertoire of tea I think they are kind of just average now. They used to feature a larger merchandise section of tea pots and travel mugs too. It's always crowded due to its close proximity to NYU. They have a rewards program on their app. On your birthday they send your email a link to a five dollar credit which is nice. There is only one bathroom and it's usually clean.",2,,

I was looking for a place to do some quiet work and have a hot drink. Unfortunately, almost every chair was full and I really needed an outlet to sit next to. While I was ordering with a lovely man behind the counter, one of the other employees came over to me, unprompted, and told me that he saw me looking for a seat so he had scouted a few options for me. It was so kind and un-NYC of him! He said that, if I wanted, he would either put my belongings there for me, or stay up at the counter to wait for my tea while I snagged the seat. I have never experienced such personable service, especially at a peak hour from a place that is so busy.",,,
26,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,4.0,3/29/2016,"I was wandering around Union Square on a Saturday while hungover & dehydrated from the night before when I came across Argo Tea.I had tasted tea samples at the Argo location in Flatiron, but had not actually had one.  Being completely dehydrated, it seemed like the perfect cure.So many options between:- Tea Sparkles:  use sparkling water base- Tea Squeezes:  use lemonade base- Bubble Teas:  Taiwanese tea using tapioca balls- Teappuccinos:  use black teas & milk baseDecided on the White Peach Tea Sparkle, which was white tea, peaches and sparkling water.  At first, I was just happy to be drinking a liquid other than alcohol, but after a while, I realized it actually wasn't that great.  That being said, I finished it as I needed the hydration.But wanted to try another, so I ordered the Hibiscus Tea Sangria, which was fabulous.  ""Hamika"" (Jamaica) as Hibiscus is called in Mexico is one of my favorites.  It had hibiscus tea, apples, oranges & pears, and sparkling water.  Was excellent and hit the spot.  Wish I had gone with a large one of these in the first place.The ""Tea Squeezes"" looked pretty good as well, but are teas mixed with lemonade, so are more tart, and have more calories 190 vs 140 for the ""Tea Sparkles""The location was nice as was the design and feel of the place.  Lots of tables and chairs to sit at, which I did, for over an hour, as I recovered from my hangover lol.The food looked pretty basic and not that great, similar to the snack boxes you get at Starbucks, so I'd stick to the teas here.  And they have a lot of loose leaf teas to choose from to take home, which I did.The cost is pretty high - like over $5 for a Large, which is pretty pricey considering how cheap tea and water is.  I think that's a big reason for the negative reviews on here, cause otherwise it's a very pleasant place.  But even me, who doesn't knock a place cause of cost, can agree that this place is expensive for tea.Overall though, if you're looking for a place to chill, relax and re-hydrate from walking around Manhattan, then this is a good spot.",8,5,8

Their hibiscus tea sangria is delicious. The almond latte is average. And the drink took a while to be prepared. They use illy coffee. It is a nice spot with a good amount of seating. Good place for working. I see a lot if outlets around me to plug in. Also a good place for meeting friends and hanging out as there is a wide variety of both teas and coffees. Drinks are highly customizable. I do give them kudos for having THREE non dairy milk options! Almond soy and coconut. Yay!! And they have vegan muffins , cookies and bars. So glad to see they have vegan pastries. Starbucks to this day, still is behind on that aspect. Overall Argo is like the Starbucks of tea. They have unique tea drinks and I would say their tea drinks are better than their coffee drinks. This location in general is nice and big but service is a little slow. Still a good spot!",,,

It offers some very nice seasonal drinks and also has some staple teas that all are very refreshing and unique. It's also priced much more fairly than other caffeine-drink chains (*glares at Starbucks*). Their food options are also quite nice, especially their muffins that pair well with the tea. They even have an app that lets you pay through it and collect rewards, like other chains (*glares at Starbucks*). Their seating area is quite cute, but always seems to be packed with people, so I usually just take my drink to go. I'm definitely a fan of Argo Tea, simply because I believe it offers a nice, healthy drink option for all of those out there trying to find things other than coffee.",,,

I tried the sparkly peach which was a combination of white tea, fruitiness, and carbonation. It was okay. Honestly the description/name made the drink sound a lot better than it eventually ended up tasting. I thought that the actual tea flavor seemed a little stale/artificial and the carbonation added a strange quality to the drink instead of enhancing it. I'd be curious to try other flavors though!

Updated review","This Argo is very close to the NYU one on Greene, and boasts an awkward, tiny 'order ready area', where the side door opens inward and into the table where folks can sit in a nook, creating a traffic jam of nonsense.Staff was pleasant and patient, serving up a decent small chocolate mint white tea (yes, I know). Their parfait, however, left a nasty residue on my hands and came in a terrible vessel with an odd spork knockoff.Transaction Amount $4.84Credit Applied -- $4.84Total Spent $0.00BTW this is a dup2 decent and substantial cookies - oatmeal and chocolate chip, warmed up:Transaction Amount $5.33Credit Applied -- $5.33Total Spent $0.00Flax bar -- pretty tasty, though overpriced and basically just sugarTransaction Amount $3.76Credit Applied -- $3.76Total Spent $0.00Pistachio Macaron -- Transaction Amount $2.01Credit Applied -- $1.24Total Spent $0.77Chocolate chip cookie -- not warmed upTransaction Amount $2.67Credit Applied -- $2.00Total Spent $0.67Transaction Amount $6.53 - croissant and 'chocolate truffle' aka fudgy brownieCredit Applied -- $6.00Total Spent $0.53Transaction Amount $3.76 - pomegranate pistachio raw bar - didn't deem me worthy of any pistachiosCredit Applied -- $3.76Total Spent $0.00Transaction Amount $3.76 - ginger raw barCredit Applied -- $3.76Total Spent $0.00Transaction Amount $2.67$1 Credit -- $1.00$1 Credit -- $1.00$0.24 Credit On The House -- $0.24Global Credit -- $0.43Total Balance $0.002 cookies for $0.33Transaction Amount $5.33Total Rewards -- $5.00Birthday -- $5.00Total Balance $0.33Spiced Ginger Raw Bar not terribleTransaction Amount $3.76Total Rewards -- $3.76$4 Loyalty Reward -- $3.76Total Balance $0.00Transaction Amount $2.67Total Rewards -- $2.24Take a Tea Break -- $2.00$0.24 Loyalty Reward -- $0.24Total Balance $0.43Transaction Amount $5.33Total Rewards -- $5.00Come Visit -- $5.00Total Balance $0.33Transaction Amount $2.67Total Rewards -- $2.00Loyalty Reward -- $2.00Total Balance $0.67Total Rewards -- $2.00$2 Credit -- $2.00Total Balance $2.19",1,,

I can usually count on his descriptions to guide me well, also as to exact steeping recommendations. If he's there I usually ask him what he's been drinking lately, and often let them guide me. Shawn, Lauren, Catherine, and Erika are so welcoming that this Argo is my go-to place when I've got concentrated work to do, and don't want to hole up at home. There are many regulars there--because we feel welcome.",,,

Updated review","In this case the price on the board says 2.25 for my small tea. It rings up as 2.45 plus the tax. That's kind of bs. Then they take your card and manually type the numbers into their cell phone, which is probably connected to the unsecured Argo wifi. Seems like they could do better all around. Very disappointed in these two issues. On top of this, the place is as runned down as most STARBUCKS. Only thing good is the wifi.",1,,

Updated review","Argo gets 5 stars because customer service is awesome, the coffee is better than Starbucks, and it has bathrooms, wifi, outlets, and coffee all in one place.  A lot of Manhattan Starbucks and coffee shops have none of those things.  Plus, they have tea, which I sometimes get for a change of pace.  Ambience is solid, nice low key music on at all times.  I'm quite productive here.",,,
51,Morgen B.,"Brooklyn, NY",154,817,4,4.0,4/9/2014,"I really like this space, it's big enough to actually accommodate the influx of people you'd expect in the union square area, yet designed well enough so you don't feel like you're sitting in a cafeteria. Kudos.The staff are professional and fast, and my tea is amazing! Make sure to ask for the wifi code and keep your eye out for a seat - this place is packed!",3,,2
52,Ahmed M.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,230,350,4.0,11/27/2014,I honestly never heard of them until recently.  I was walking around Flatiron and saw some people walking around with a cup in their hands.  I decided to walk inside because of the free samples.  I was able to sample 3 different iced teas before buying.  These were the best teas I've ever had! I bought the Carolina Honey tea and it was da bomb.  Every sip was good and I made sure to get over sip out of it. I ate the ice too!.  The only thing I did not like was the Price!  I will go back though.,,,
53,Darlene Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",514,1137,61,3.0,8/22/2015,"It was a pretty warm day and my friend and I wanted to get something refreshing to drink. We found our way in to Argo and they had a beautiful wall of teas to chose from. Teas for days! Eventually I went with JASMINE GREE TEA. Yes, the tea was a bit simple, but it was very well made, and I would definitely make a trip to this spot again soon. Service is great, and it makes your visit that much more enjoyable. ENJOY!",1,1,1
54,Deanna A.,"Brooklyn, NY",516,115,58,4.0,1/21/2016,"I love the concept of Argo tea - coffee isn't one of my favorites so it's great to have an option of mixing and matching tea bases, milk, flavor shots etc the same way that others find joy in coming up with elaborate latte orders. I went with one of their recommended drinks - a hot hibiscus apple cider tea drink. It was crisp and sweet without being too sweet. Next time I look forward to concocting my own!I visited this location on a bustling Sunday, and you could definitely tell that you were by a college! Despite the busy and bustling atmosphere, service was quick and it was exactly what we needed for a hot to-go drink to hold as we walked around the neighborhood on a frosty day. The moleskine store next door adds to the collegiate vibe - and they seemed to have some great cross-promotional offers too!",,,
55,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",550,836,2196,4.0,7/31/2012,"I've heard of Argo Tea before, but didn't know there was actually a cafe in NYC. I love tea and couldn't wait to try it.As I was passing by in the neighborhood on a hot afternoon recently, I decided to stop in and see what Argo Tea Cafe. First, I was blown away with all the collections of tea products they had and accessories and I noticed that there was a lot of people with their laptops and enjoying cups of tea. There is an array of teas to choose from. The one that caught my eye first was the Hibiscus Chiller  which was hibiscus iced tea with apple cider. In my opinion, it tasted just like apple juice, only lighter in concentration. I really enjoyed the tea and it was inexpensive as well - $3.75 for a medium sized iced tea. I can't give an entire 5 stars yet, only because I haven't sat at Argo Tea Cafe and really experienced the ambiance of the cafe. I'm excited to try some of their other drinks, so it looks like I will be making another visit at some point.Teas to try: Carolina Honey Breeze, MojiTea, Tea Sangria. They even have a hot beverage called: Red Velvet (MUST TRY!)",,,
56,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,3.0,8/22/2013,"Wandering around the Union Square area the other day I happened upon this Argo Tea Cafe. I still think these places are the bastard redheaded stepchild of Starbucks and The Coffee Bean. Sorry, but I'm a coffee guy first, but will take in a spot of tea now and then. Brightly lit screens showcasing images of pretty looking drinks with funky names, calorie counts, and prices. Display case full of delicious looking pastries. Free wifi with purchase. Seating area in another room to the right with tables and chairs spread around.If you are more of a tea person then this place is right up your alley. They even have bubble tea here. I am a coffee whore but will cross over to dabble in a little teabagging action now and then. Heh heh heh!Argo Tea Cafe carries quite a diverse selection of loose teas, along with many hot and cold tea concoctions to choose from. Most of the drinks are on the healthy side using natural, fresh ingredients, and free of artificial flavorings, colorings, or additives. Liquid cane sugar is used as a sweetener. There are many different ways you can have your drinks prepared to your taste and preference. I ordered an iced chocolate mint tea made with skim milk and black tea. I'm more of an iced coffee and tea drinker in the Summer. Not cheap at almost $6. Ouch! I know it might be more for quality but $6 is a bit much. The counter staff was helpful, and made my drink quickly. Like I said, I'm still a coffee guy and will stick with that as my first choice but this is not a bad alternative as a change of pace once in a while.",6,4,3

Updated review","I must update this review... Cashier totally remembers me every time. I apparently come here too much. Gotta lay off the tea, I tell myself as I approach the cashier. He says, without looking up, ""What can I get ya?"" then he looks up and says:  ""Oh, hey Sash."" Whoa- wait, double take. ""Um, what? How do you know..."" He smirks. It's sort of creepy... and I think, only my really close friends and family call me ""Sash"" so it sounds too strange coming from a stranger. I kinda want to tell him, don't call me Sash please call me Beyonce Fierce, my alter ego... but I don't. ""How do you know my name?!"" I'm incredulous. ""Oh, you remembered it?"" I say stupidly. He nods. ""Well you come here all the time..."" (I told you I gotta lay off the tea) ""...and well, you're a very pretty girl, how can I forget your face?"" I blush. Aw- how cute. Let the conversation ensue. He thinks I'm Italian, I tell him I'm Puerto Rican, he speaks Spanish I do too... and I then complain that the chai tea was too watery last time but I wanted a chai. He makes me some ""special"" chai... You don't want to know what made it special. HA.  He told me, I unfortunately forgot. It was really good though. Kudos, mister. You are now why I updated my review. Congrats.",1,1,5
58,Avi K.,"New York, NY",65,6,0,2.0,10/29/2016,"Likely the worst bubble tea I've had. Tapioca balls are very stale and taste like they have artificial sweetener in them. Even if the teas are good, don't put something on he menu that you are bad at.",,,
59,Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",664,841,861,3.0,3/10/2011,"What I like about the Argo tea chain (of the 2 I've visited) is that the staff is more than willing to help you with your selection, and explain all the concoctions they brew up here.  Honey this,  Red that.   A Teapachino!?Who knew!?Well their over compensating ways, make me feel like I'm not the only dofus getting caught up with an alternative to coffee.These stores are nice and have a warm feel.  Somehow more comfortable, and definitely less crowded than coffee chains.They give you a varying and cryptic wireless password on your receipt, which can only be used on a single device.This location, the worker chastised me for snapping a couple of pics with my iPod touch.  ""Sir...No photos allowed"".    REALLY?    3 Stars for the quality of what they offer and a nice comfortable environment.",2,,
60,Anna A.,"Corona, NY",0,39,5,2.0,10/4/2016,"I used to love this place. The past 2 times I've been here, the line has been insane, even though nobody had ordered anything particularly complicated to make. In addition, the iced teas I received (white tea and ginger peach) were WAY TOO STRONG. I like a bitter tea, but as someone who frequents many Argo Tea locations, this tea was way too strong and not like the standard teas in the other locations. The first time I thought it was a fluke, but now I'm pretty sure it's just poor management/employee knowledge of how to make tea. I won't be back.",,,
61,Marie T.,"New York, NY",336,771,3000,4.0,8/21/2013,"Although their specialty are Teas, they do offer coffees and the such.I haven't tried their hot teas because I'm not a fan of hot tea in general.But, their cold teas are unique and not too sweet at all !  They have fancy loose tea dispensers where you can fill up your own bag of tea leaves and a large selection!I personally LOVE their bubble tea.  It's not the Chinese bubble tea balls that you get in Chinese Restaurants but instead, they are square shaped and from the Philippines.  You get to choose the milk and syrup you'd like in your Bubble Tea but I prefer no syrup and regular milk.  The Bubble Tea square bits are enough sweetness, so no extra syrup is necessary.You can ask for a free wifi code at the cashier when you make a purchase, but you only have a 2 hour time limit.  There is more than enough space to bring your lap top in to do a bit of studying with many outlet plugs if needed!Its generally $1.50 more than getting an ""Hibiscus Iced Tea"" at Starbucks, but it's the quality you're paying for.I've never tried the food.",,,

Coming from VA, where only coffee shops are available, I definitely appreciate Argo and there great selection of teas (hot & cold). This is definitely the ""Starbucks"" for tea drinkers. If you're craving tea and don't want your typical flavor teas such as Earl Grey, green or black tea from a bag, then i recommend you to stop by here!This place also has amble space, a great ambiance, 2 hours free wifi with purchase, tons of tables, making it a perfect space for studying.",,,

They couldn't stop raving about how amazing this place is.  As soon as I walked in I felt a warm welcome. The person behind the counter gladly told me which drinks tasted well with soy milk and then I decided on the vanilla earl grey iced tea with soy. I was a bit timid to taste the drink as I had read a review that the drinks were too sugary but my drink was just right. I swallowed the small I ordered in about 3 big gulps.I was told that I need to try the hot red velvet alas it comes with white chocolate so no can do with this milk allergy. I also tried to sweet hibiscus sangria, it was good but a bit acidic.I wish we had this shop in LA but then I would be broke.",,,
70,Jamie Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",158,19,2,4.0,12/24/2014,"My friends and I stumbled upon this place when we were looking for a place for a warm drink. The Carolina Honey tea was surprisingly delicious! I ordered a small cup of it, which I regretted later on. The atmosphere was nice and modern. There were also free samples of the seasonal special teas and they were delicious too (one was white frostea chocolate and the other I forgot the name of).

72,Mimi T.,"Tokyo, Japan",321,187,36,1.0,5/4/2014,"Argo tea is a great place to get work done. Unfortunately their coffee and their tea is not so good. Their tea is so oversteeped it's bitter and the coffee, I don't know what's in it, but every time I get it, I get a stomache from the acidity of the coffee. And I keep thinking if they make the coffee fresh, it shouldn't be bad. Nope. Also if you want free wifi it's available but you have to ask for a wifi code at the register and it only gives you 2 hour blocks. This is handy if you have papers to write since it really makes you buckle down and not get distracted, but at the same time it can hinder your work process. Now while the coffee and the tea is a little off in my taste, I have had some of their signature drinks (tea lattes, etc.) and they weren't too bad. People seem to really enjoy their signature drinks, so perhaps this is a place to get mixed tea drinks instead of straight coffee or tea.",5,,
73,Tim B.,"Newport Beach, CA",767,324,46,3.0,5/22/2014,"I love studying here. It's a great place to sit down and get work done, because of how spacious it is. There are not too many places in NYC with that much seating, 2 restrooms, and multiple outlets. That being said, the drinks are very mediocre. It seems like they add a lot of fructose to sweeten up their drinks. I think you'd be better off ordering something simple, like an iced/hot tea, or coffee. Of all 3 ""specialty"" tea drinks I had, none of them were very good.",1,1,1

Updated review","Considering my last review for Argo is from 2010 (almost two years!), I guess it's about time for an update: The place can get pretty crowded now. If all seats appear taken AND there is a long line at the cashier, I don't even bother. Otherwise, a short wait usually scores a seat, if not on the low corner chairs, then at the communal table.Wifi is pretty stable throughout the store. Ask for a wifi code when purchasing for 2 hours via webbeam. The cushioned booth-like seats do not have electrical outlets. The communal tables have outlets on the side, under the tabletop.I typically order the hot teapuccino or hot earl grey vanilla creme. Skip the coffee. Food choices aren't really worth it, but if you must, the muffins are okay.",2,,1
75,Sarah P.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,25,2,5.0,3/23/2016,"I can't speak to the coffee, but Argo has awesome teas - both to drink there and loose leaf to take home. They also have little sample stations where you can try some of the loose leaf teas. And some of their baked goods are vegan! I ordered an iced strawberry green tea latte with soymilk and bubbles, and while it was slightly sweeter than I'd have made it, it was still completely wonderful. I'd imagine it would be easy to ask them to add less sweetener or to add more milk to balance it if you prefer less sweet. Nice open/relaxing atmosphere, too - a good place to read or work quietly.",,,
76,Kristen V.,"New York, NY",3,30,24,5.0,3/19/2016,This Argo tea location on university place is the best! As soon as I walked in I noticed three different tea samples but could find a cup to try them with. I turned around and one of the employees was right there to provide one to me. I opted for a hot strawberry green tea and put a hint of honey in it and it was delicious! Such a cute environment to relax and do work at. Definitely crawling with NYU students.,,,

I think normal milk would have been much better. They have a wide variety of teas but no menu that describes their flavors, so I kind of felt like I was flying blind. It is great that they have non-dairy alternatives like almond milk and soy milk. Also the store was pretty messy.

This means there are lots of people in line ordering tea. This means that waiting for a simple small cup of tea can take 15 - 20 minutes. In my experience, indeed waiting that 15+ minutes for a small cup of tea (YES, the proceeding WAS based on a true story!), I was mentally able to calculate my budget for the week, think of all of the errands I needed to run, return overdue text messages and check Facebook on my iPhone approximately twelve (obsessive) times in a row.Glad to know there is an Argo in this 'hood, but I'll happily stick to my favorite one near Columbus Circle for when I need my fix.

I'd try to detour around 11th Street or walk down Broadway just so I wouldn't have to see NYU students huddled inside doing work (and taking advantage of the air conditioning) during a beautiful 95 degree summer day (a treat since I'm from Texas). But eventually, I gave in. I wanted to see what all the hype was about or at least why this location was always packed, and I finally figured it out - copious outlets, wifi, a ton of seating, and basically a war room for students and young professionals who needed to get work done. Unfortunately, the tea and coffee drinks weren't part of the allure, or at least not for me. I tried the mate latte, which was pretty watery in my opinion and nothing special. Other drinks on the menu sounded decent, but nothing special or at least nothing that actually highlighted tea, but instead boasted sugary syrups. If you need to get work done, this is the place. If you're looking for a good tea or coffee drink, walk a few blocks to one of the many East Village coffee shops.",1,1,

Their drink menu/screen is cool, but it's just a picture of the drink and the calories listed under it based on the size of the drink. It would be nice to know what exactly are in these mysteriously colorful drinks.Argo has mugs for purchase...as well as different kinds of loose tea, which I liked. They also have some pastries, chocolate chip cookies, chips, etc.There are plenty of places to sit.

There also seems like there's a table size for everyone. Group study session? There are several large square tables with built-in outlets. Working solo? No problem when there are so many small tables for two. There are even a few large comfy chair options if you feel like lounging with a book or magazine. The space itself is well-lit and clean and the music promotes a modern, chic vibe.The tea and signature drinks themselves seem overpriced and the staff could be a bit more enthusiastic/friendly.

The drinks are tasty and refreshing I highly recommend this month's drink teana colada it's a mix of pineapple, coconut and chamomile tea .Personally I like to order and dash off because at times the place can be crowded with students and or  college staff working on papers or personal work. Oh yes can't forget they have wonderful Free samples inside usually of 2 drinks being featured for the month . It's a great way to taste 2 flavors you may never have thought to try. Oh yes if your into apps , there app is great offering a $5 credit to purchase your first drink when you link up your card to the app.Easy as scan and go .

Tea tasting like Cappucino?  You get to order the style of tea you want and choose your milk, flavorings, and so on.  The Red Velvet with 2% and white chocolate is the way to go.  With the help of Argo, i was able to forget that for a couple of minutes, my bum wasn't freezing.",,,

119,Auron S.,"Manhattan, NY",25,8,0,3.0,12/28/2011,"I used to be the mayor of this place on foursquare in the summer because I came to this place religiously to get work done. Why am I not anymore? Well, as spacious as it seems, it is overcrowded during the entire week with NYU students and makes it rather hard to get anything done as it just loses the nice ambience it had. There's my big warning for you if you were planning to find a place to get some work done on a weekday.The tea itself is kind of on the expensive end of things if you get their special brews that are on the screen with the fancy titles, but there are the typical teas you can ask for on a smaller part on the other side of the fancy menu which is much cheaper. I recommend the Carolina Honey (Hot or Cold), Strawberry Green Tea Creme (Hot), Earl Grey Vanilla Creme (Hot), and Hibiscus Tea Squeeze (Cold.) There is a membership card that you can sign up for for free if you ask, that way you can get a free small drink every 10 that you buy (you need to pay a little extra if you burst the free drink's price range.) The food here is okay, for the price of the stuff you get, you might as well walk to some food cart and get a bigger portion because their little boxes of pre-made heated up food is not very filling, even it might seem like so.  Their baked goods and treats aren't too bad, but then again, overpriced, it's cheaper if you get the tea and the food because there's some small discount you get.The bathrooms never seem to be clean anymore in this place because the baristas are overworked taking orders from customers. I feel bad being the person to tell them that the toilet isn't working or whatever, but I guess someone needs to inform them. It'd be nice if the place had a slightly bigger staff but it is what it is.If you're planning to be working a little late into the night without distraction or need to do a small meeting, this is a place for you because it quiets down a lot after dinner time. There are also plenty of other Argo locations in NYC now, so do look for the other ones and see what your preference is. My latest Argo digs might be the one around 26th street, also nice and quaint, without all the people and fuss.",1,,

I think that having a tea lover bring me here to  try some of the very unique tea blends this company has to offer made the difference.  The general ambience of how the place was designed with the high glass windows and the many local art displayed, made for a very good experience.

The baristas are friendly and their service is excellent. As of late I've been fascinated with the Asian phenomenon of bubble tea, and at Argo it's particularly good, which can't be said for many of the bubble tea joints that are popping up all over the city.  The prices, however, are a bit high, and they actually charge for internet, which these days seems criminal.

134,Abe G.,"Manhattan, NY",484,93,7,3.0,3/9/2011,"Maybe it is all of their magical properties, but tea shops in New York seem to be becoming a profitable venture lately. Tea has always dotted menus at cafes and coffee shops all around, but now stores that offer tea as a focal point of their menu are becoming as popular as coffee joints. Argo, the newest addition to the NYU area, is right on University Pl. &  11th St. and will completely shatter any kind of preconceived notions you had about tea shops (assuming you had some already).Even if you're not a tea-drinker, step into Argo for a minute just to look at menu. They have all sorts of teas, ranging from pomegranate to white to boba (or bubble, as you east coasters like to call it). More than that, they have an excellent assortment of savory and sweet snacks like quiches, cookies, and pies to accompany your drink. If you're like me and to brew your tea in the comfort of your own dorm, they have a fairly large selection of both loose-leaf and bagged tea, too.More impressive than the selection of teas is their myriad of accessories: you can purchase (for a ridiculously high price) tea pots, high tech tea infusers, and every kind of tea cup under the sun. A tea drinker's wet dream. Rest assured that in no way do they sacrifice quality for quantity, as a cup of Argo tea is extremely well-brewed with the true essence of every leaf coming through each and every sip. A true gift from the gods.But reader beware: do not come here if you are looking for a relaxing atmosphere to sit back, do some accounting homework, and enjoy a few cups of tea. The atmosphere here is anything but relaxed.  If you can hear anything over the thunderous roar of the machines inside Argo, there will be no shortage of conversations to eavesdrop on. Amidst the hollering of the staff, the gazillion people speaking loudly at the store, and the din of the artillery-like drink machines, it can be hard to sit down and unwind, but perhaps this is intentional.Maybe they wanted to free tea from its oppressive chains of pretentious shacks where Regina Spektor constantly flows through the speakers (yes, I am talking about you, Tea Spot). Lots of people are ditching their lattes in favor of something lighter, with a wider variety of flavor. Maybe tea shouldn't be restricted to be enjoyed only when one needs to relax or take a break, tea should be enjoyed whenever, wherever, and Argo is helping usher that movement in.",2,1,

People were working by themselves, meeting with friends, or doing group projects. Wasn't too loud, but wasn't silent like a library.- communal tables- a man playing a guitar in the larger room.

Now for the tea: I wasn't too impressed sadly.

142,Abigail M.,"Manhattan, NY",36,48,10,5.0,4/25/2013,"Argo Tea is unique, cute and filled with unusual and delicious drinks. It is sort of like the tea version of Starbucks. They have a Teappuccino, I was curious and I tried it... it was just as good as it looked. They have comfortable seating, excellent croissants and the staff has always been exceptionally sweet, funny and friendly.",1,,1
143,Angela I.,"New York, NY",46,52,0,1.0,12/7/2010,"Argo Tea, why do you suck so much when I'm trying so hard to like you?I've given this place so many chances since I live right down the block and they've disappointed me in food, ambiance and service.Specialty drinks taste really awful, overly sweet and in a way almost blasphemous to real tea drinking.  Standard steeped teas are good but almost $5 bucks?! No thanks.This place is always so crowded and even with the stingy 2 hour wi-fi limit the place manages to be packed and the many tables make it hard to walk through the mass of people.The service is shotty and no one is ever friendly when I come in.  I ordered heated food once and waited over 15 min until I asked about my order.  The food was left in the microwave and was wilted and dried out. The server didn't care at all and didn't even apologize. She was even annoyed that I was even asking about my food in the first place.  That was the last time I went to Argo and my final. I'm boycotting.",4,2,
144,Charity B.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,1,0,3.0,4/4/2011,"Ok, so this is generally a great place to work/study. Love that they have plenty of outlets for laptops, good table space, and you can literally spend hours on end, occupying space and they don't seem to mind.The cons:Con #1. The bubble tea is horrible! Leave it to the vietnamese Argo!  I don't like the ""jelly"" and the flavor I ordered was watered down and really sweet.  Con #2. Stank help.  I understand that Argo is making tea cool ie inflated prices , fancy tea leaves for sale & other tea contraptions, that crazy flat screen that flashes the menu...I get it.  But the help is still stank...aside from one girl that helped me, I typically get alot of 'tude with the tea.  Argo employees, do us a favor and stop taking yourselves so seriously. Maybe it's the little black bandanas you have to wear or the general sense of tea superiority if you will... Either way...get over yourselves.",1,1,

The dish was pretty damn good, and for only $5.50 it was economical. The place has three seating areas -- a main one with tables, chairs and booths, a secondary area with tables and a couple chairs and a third area which has a long bar looking onto the street. Service was kind of slow; the folks behind the counter were friendly, though.I didn't use the WiFi. I'll probably come back here.",1,,1

It gets a little crowded but I've pretty much always been able to get a spot, albeit Saturday day is a little tough. Very novel drinks which makes this place fun. Yes it can be quite expensive, almost 8 bucks for a large teapacchunio, but as other yelpers (yelpies?) have pointed out, your essentially paying for the atmosphere, big shared tables with amble room to spread out stuff, good lighting, friendly staff, and free wi-fi (with purchase). Bathrooms get a 3/5 star, they're nice, but need to be maintained a little more, though the place does get quite busy.The food is alright, there miniature pannini's are kinda fun, though not super cheap.

However the wifi only lasts 2 hours (at most) and often is VERY slow and the prices there are definitely very steep for a specialty tea.

153,Tempest B.,"Portland, OR",232,369,86,4.0,8/10/2010,"Argo Tea is popping up everywhere, but I won't complain. Better this than Starbucks. I love that this location is so much bigger. Three giant tables with outlets plus plenty of other seating. They need the space for this neighborhood. Though I will say that even when NYU is in session and there are tons of people in here I can usually find ONE seat. If you're bringing a group, try to get here early. But I've never walked in here and not been able to find anywhere to sit, so it looks like they correctly judged the amount of space necessary. Good job.Excellent teas. I've tried every signature tea on the menu and love more than half of them. My standard is the teapuccino with hazelnut, red tea, and half and half. I also really like the Carolina Honey, Earl Grey Vanilla Creme, Red Velvet, Mate Latte and tea sangria. The Armenian Mint is also excellent hot or cold.Tasty, if overpriced food. Though since they introduced the Tea Bites I've been less annoyed about the food offerings.Wish they hadn't discontinued the chocolate brownie thing. The replacement isn't nearly as good.Also, don't ever ask for Almond Milk in any drinks. Whatever brand of almond milk they use is gross, gross, gross. Good almond milk is amazing and a great soy substitute. Their stuff is a crime against almonds.Good ambiance.Decent hours. For this location I'd actually except it to be open until midnight on weeknights and 2am on Friday and Saturday, NYU students are all pretending to be Hemmingway and need their late-night cafes. Honestly? I much prefer Vagabond Cafe across the park. If I'm even in the general vicinity I will go there before I come here. But this is a good second choice.",12,2,10
154,Elisabeth C.,"Summit, NJ",342,378,37,5.0,11/27/2012,"Love this place. When I am in the city, I am going to go there in lieu of Starbucks when possible. They had a helluva lot of teas to chose from - many were ready brewed, but I went for something that needed to be brewed for me - Jasmine white tea. It was one of the best cups of tea I had in a long time. fragrant, brewed perfectly, just awesome in every way.  The vibe in the place was awesome and the seating ample. We sat for a long time drinking our tea undisturbed. The cups are really pretty, the staff is nice and helpful. If I had any feedback to improve the place, I would say that the menu is confusing. I wanted to get a tea not on the posted menu but it was not until I got up to the counter that I asked about it and I saw that they had large selection of loose teas to brew just for you. Even then, I had no time to give the decision any real consideration by reading all the flavors of the teas available because there was a long line behind me and I knew what kind I wanted anyway. I would like to have a list of all possibilities before I make a decision - and there was just so much to choose from, it could be overwhelming. Starbucks is about coffee, and even though they are creative about what to do with it and have many offerings, the world of tea has so many more options that it is difficult to know what you want before making an informed decision. They have coffee here also and many options for that but I was interested in tea and that is what you want to gethere because it isn't available in most places like it is here.I would look at the loose teas before getting on line if you have the time. Even the menu that they have posted above the counter which alternates in display from cold to hot drinks is really confusing. There are just too many options, but I love having so many options so I am not going to complain. It reminds me of Chipotle, the first time I went there I did not understand how to order but the second time I was totally aware of what to do. Now I will look around at Argo tea before i make a decision.I would order unsweetened drinks and sweeten them yourself. I had a cold fruit and tea drink over the summer that was incredibly sweet and almost undrinkable.",1,,1
155,Lilly A.,"New York, NY",351,33,0,4.0,8/7/2010,"The quality of tea is excellent here. I've tried the hot red and black teas, which have a lot of flavor without being too strong. I also tried the iced apple hibiscus tea, and that was good too.One thing about Argo Tea Cafe you might not expect is that despite its name, they also make a delicious cup of coffee. In fact, Argo not only has an extensive menu of specialty tea drinks, both hot and iced, they also offer hot and iced coffee drinks too. The menu for the coffee drinks is more limited, but it's there nonetheless. It's a relief to know I can come here with tea and coffee lovers alike!The food is good. I tried the turkey and cheese sandwich, which had a lot of flavor. The vegan muffins are good too, although a bit dry. I don't think I'm being unrealistic to expect more from a vegan muffin. I will say that when fresh out of the oven, and not sitting behind the chilled case, the vegan apple hibiscus muffin was definitely better than good.The desserts were nice too, though I can't say any were the best I've ever had. The rugalach had a huge oil slick at the bottom, and it was a little too doughy for me, and the chocolate brownie was a bit dry and crumbly.Argo gets points for playing mostly instrumental music. Although the music can also be a little loud, it's nice not to hear anything too distracting when I'm eating lunch and trying to have a conversation with friends.Another thing I love about Argo is the helpful staff. They patiently explained the menu to my friends who had never been there, and they even offered us samples.There are only two things here I'm not crazy about. The first is that the wifi doesn't always seem to work. The second is that you need a token to use the bathroom. The doors don't lock on the inside, and it's hard to feel secure in there when I'm afraid of someone walking in.If you are looking for a casual, fun place to have a light meal or a snack, along with some yummy tea, Argo Tea Cafe is the place. I can't wait to come back and give their little teapot grain salads a try!",4,1,6

The prices are definitely not worth the amount of tea you get and it's definitely not worth the taste either. I know a million other places you can go to for tea with just as much but A LOT cheaper. It's sad. I walked in before, looked at the prices, and then traveled to the side to look at the tea sets and pretty tumblers. The prices for those are ridonculous. I left empty handed.",,1,

Argo Tea is expenSIVE!Strike 1: One day I ordered Armenian mint. Ingredients: Peppermint. I guess by ""Armenian"" they just mean ""Super Cool Deluxe Mo Money Sucka!"" Vacant marketing makes me gag. Smelled nice enough. I peeked in the cup to see what the tea looked like: no tea bag. I like to let my tea brew a long time, and sometimes I like to re-use the tea bag. I know, it sounds so ""grapes of wrath,"" but Argo stripped me of that freedom (I mean, teadom--wa ha ha). Strike 2: Another day I ordered a mojito-like drink. You know the drill--mint, lime, sugar. It was far from fresh-tasting and sweet like candy. Grr. Strike 3: One time I ordered a chessy muffin thing and it took 5 minutes to get it (they were warming it up) and then I  got it and it was the wrong thing. The staff was super friendly about it, and so was I, so they got me the right muffin. Then it took another 5 minutes to warm THAT one up. Ugh. Argo ruined a pretty floor, deprived me of tea bagging, and took all day to reheat a muffin. Go to Recess. Go to Grey Dog. Go to Starbuckers.",1,4,2

My red velvet was fine (sweet and with a tea like texture, a perfect mix between red velvet cupcake and tea), but she didn't like the coffee here. It was a bit too bitter/ dark, and even when she threw some out and put a lot of sugar and milk in it, it was really a bit much for her. It is a very cool place to come in and sit down for a while. They have seats everywhere. You can have a conversation for hours. There are also many college kids doing work on laptops there (similar to Think Coffee nearby).

The quiches are only average, and I want above average for that price. The ""teapot"" salads aren't enough food for that price. The did renovate the old Dean and Deluca but I think it looks better. The beautiful ceiling is still there, just a new color.

I did a review of it a while back, here.yelp.com/biz/argo-tea-ca…So of course, when I was in the neighborhood, I stopped by the University Place Argo and the beverages were hardly recognizable!  I recommended it to the group of friends I came in with, and I felt awful that they ordered sub-par tea because of me.I ordered one of my stand-bys, the White Tea Acai Squeeze.  It was awful, bitter, and undrinkable.  I tasted my friends' drinks too, and found very similar problems there -- they were all too bitter and overbrewed.All Argo cafes use a concentrated brew of teas to make their ""Signature Drinks"".  You can see them in glass pitchers behind the counter.  To make concentrated tea correctly, you have to use a LOT of tea and brew it for a short, standard amount of time.  From the awful bitter tea I tasted, it seemed like they were trying to skimp on the tea and instead brew a small amount of tea for a longer period of time to achieve the same effect.  It doesn't work that way.So seriously, do yourself a favor and take about a 15-minute walk to the other Argo if you have time.  You can thank me later.",,,

A variety of healthy tea-based drinks with creative names (i.e., Mojitea!), really friendly baristas who patiently help you as you work out your indecisiveness from the huge selection of teas and flavors, and a large, clean, spacious lounge space complete with free Wifi for being productive or otherwise. What's more, there's a sizable selection of healthy sandwiches and baked goodies that are all made in-house.I like this location even better than its original Flatiron one because it's more centralized and offers more seating area.

I paid $3.21 for a cup of iced tea that tasted like it had been sitting out for hours in a dirty pitcher. I usually refrain from putting sugar syrup in my tea however only after several shots of syrup and a handful of lemon slices was it palatable. The environment was nice enough.

They also, like most Argo tea cafes, have a wall full of loose tea dispensers filled with classic teas to exotic flavors. All in all, Argo tea is a refreshing take on specialty drinks.",1,,1
187,Jamie H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,3.0,12/25/2011,"First, the Argo Tea Cafe has outstanding drinks across the board.  I am in love with their Ginger Twist and Mojito drinks.  They have a great selection of sandwiches, snacks, and sweets.  They offer gluten free and vegan options.  Also, their loose tea is selection is decent.  The strawberry green loose tea is quite tasty.However, this particular restaurant is very slow.  They do not process orders in the order placed.  The last two times I was there, I had to wait 10 minutes for my drink.  Customers who ordered after I did were served before I was.  Ironically, I ordered hot tea both times, which takes much less time to prepare than the specialty drinks.The service is much better at the Argo on 7th Avenue by Columbis Circle. Bottom line: if you are in a hurry, don't stop at this location unless there is no line.",1,,
188,Julian T.,"New York, NY",2,8,0,2.0,12/17/2010,"Despite the chic interior, Argo Tea Cafe definitely failed to deliver.I cam here to utilize the ""free wifi"" that was advertised and to catch up on some studying. The ""free wifi"" only comes when you buy something at the bar (which I was going to do anyways) and comes with a code that is only good for two hours. Being an avid coffee drinker, I ordered a regular coffee and was greeted with a cup that was only comparable to chain coffee (starbucks status). So if you're looking for a good cup of coffee, this isn't the place for you. The seating area was pretty crowded but we were able to find a table quite easily. There were a good amount of outlets around the store which was definitely a plus. The huge qualm I had with Argo was that they started to blast the AC when it was pretty cold outside already. I know it's a tactic to get people to leave... but when there's already a two hour limit on wifi, there isn't much you have to do to actually get a person to leave in that duration...I'm probably not coming back here. It's not a comfortable study space and the drinks are lackluster... I'll pass.",,,

190,AJ C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,0,3.0,3/13/2011,"I used to love the University Place Argo when they first opened, but since then it's just  been stressfully crowded and loud every time I step inside. I don't mind the fact that the prices are a bit more steep, because I'm paying for the novelty of some of their concoctions that isn't available anywhere else. My favorite would be an ice Tea Squeeze -- lemonade and hibiscus tea. The flavor is really strong, and you'd prefer for it to be a little bit diluted, go for the Tea Sangria, which is kind of the same thing but diluted with soda water and little chunks of fresh fruit inside. The Carolina Honey (black tea with honey) and iced Vanilla Chai are also my favorites. Their ""bubble"" in the bubble tea is not tapioca -- it's chewy bits of coconut jelly, which I thought would be really strange but ended up being pretty good. The one thing I never really loved about the place was that the food never tasted good -- especially for the prices they charge. Everything tastes microwaved (whether they are or not, I don't know).Ask for a wi-fi code at the counter -- it'll last you for two hours.And sign up for a LoyalTea card -- 10 drinks get you a free small drink (or a large drink if you pay just $1). This is definitely worth it if you come every morning for a coffee (not great), and it's nice that you're rewarded in some sense for giving them so much business (unlike other nearby franchised coffee shops).",,,

Updated review",I have no idea how it is that Argo manages to make such disgusting tea.  I went once before and had a bubble tea which was vile and thought that maybe I was overreacting and so I tried again... I ordered an ice green tea with bubbles.  1. The bubbles are sweet jelly bits.  Not tapioca at all.  Gross.2. The green tea tasted like dirty water... diluted with soda water! Who puts soda water in iced tea?!?!  And how is it possible to make green tea taste SO BAD?My drink was undrinkable and I threw it directly into the trash.  Disgusting.,,,
192,N. J.,"Durham, NC",1,14,0,2.0,8/19/2014,"This review is just for the chai. Even with soy milk, my cold chai was watery. It was overly sweet and tasted more fruity than spicy. Wasn't at all what I had hoped. The shop itself is airy, sunny, and a great place to do work. But their tea drinks more closely resemble mocktails than actual tea. Depends how you like your tea--strong and robust, or just in the drink somewhere, even if you can't taste it.",,,
193,Rashelle I.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,2.0,11/12/2014,"As much as I enjoy tea, Argo Tea just isn't that good. I'm not sure if it's the freshness of the tea or the preparation, but everything always seems watered down to me and the flavors aren't that bold or exciting. Too bad, because I really like their space...",,,
194,Kate N.,"Manhattan, NY",3,11,0,1.0,5/1/2011,"Do NOT order the bubble tea, because instead of bubbles (or tapioca pearls or boba or whatever) you will get fruit flavored jellies at the bottom of your cup, which is an unpleasant surprise when you are jonesing for those satisfyingly chewy black spheres of awesomeness. The jellies taste especially gross with black milk tea, which is unfortunately how I ordered it. Maybe they would be better with green tea without milk. But how can they even call it bubble tea when those jellies are cut in rectangles?? Basic geometry, come on.",1,,1
195,Maggie P.,"Oakland, CA",39,198,0,3.0,9/29/2011,"We don't have Argo Tea on the west coast and god knows why because it's mother truckin' delicious. I went through a boba tea phase in high school but once I got to college, I couldn't find a place that had it unless I wanted to travel to unchartered territory. Argos are scattered all over the city but this is the one I usually end up at. I was shocked to find that the boba technology had changed from five years ago - now the pearls aren't just flavorless tapioca - the ones at Argo are sweet and taste like coconut. The problem with Argo is that unless you know how to order, the choices can be really overwhelming. Not only does the electronic menu change every 8 seconds, but even if you think you want just a milk tea, you need to know the following:1. What kind of milk (soy is the best in this situation)2. What kind of tea (I go for black)3. What flavor (passion fruit is outstanding)4. Do you want bubbles?Once you get that down you're good to go, but a lot of people don't really comprehend, which means the line can move pretty slowly. I've also never had great customer service here. More often than not the people who work here act like you're disturbing them on break, take forever to make the drink, and they never put in enough ice.",,,
196,Monica L.,"Sunnyside, NY",0,22,1,2.0,2/1/2012,"Oh Argo, I've given you so many chances but I just have to quit you. Overpriced and overly sweet tea, incredibly slow service, sullen baristas. These things do not make for a happy experience. I admit, you have a couple of teas that are wonderful including Limoncello and Fruit Sangria, but that just isn't enough anymore. No, I don't have an extra hour to wait for my drink or enough liquid assets to buy it.  Good thing y'all are in NYU territory.",,,
197,August G.,"Manhattan, NY",21,57,1,4.0,8/30/2011,"I like this place for the mere fact that they provide me with two hours of wifi. I've honestly never get anything other than a seltzer, but the internet is never slow, and there are usually open tables.",,,
198,Dominic R.,"New York, NY",6,28,0,1.0,9/11/2010,"Remember when this was Dean & Deluca? The room was beautiful, light and airy with a fantastic ceiling. Well now it's a very average tea shop but they've totally ruined the room. The ceiling is excrement brown when it's not covered by cruddy panels. Even the big windows are obscured by signs. But enough about their vandalism, what about the food/drinks? Expensive and totally forgettable. What is memorable is the gag-inducing stench of baked foot rot that came out of the oven every time it opened. I presume it was some sort of aborted attempt at a cheese-based snack. It was so horrible I started to salivate with nausea and had to leave. I wish Yelp had negative stars.",1,1,1
