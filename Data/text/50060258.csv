1,Vinnie V.,"White Plains, NY",193,4,0,5.0,11/2/2018,This is the best place for brunch in Fidi. My go to is the French toast and pulled pork benedict. You really cannot go wrong at this place. Anything on the menu is going to be enjoyable. Service is on point and the vibe is relaxed.If you live in Fidi and you are not going there once a month you are doing it wrong...,,,
2,Paula F.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,304,2211,4.0,10/20/2018,"Great little eatery with a fun and very social vibe!  My bf and I visited this restaurant on a late Saturday afternoon.  There were a few tables outside, and shared tables and counter seating inside.  We opted for first available and had an approximate 15 minute wait. Ultimately, we ended up at the counter and were able to watch the food and drinks being prepared.  The menu had a small but wonderful variety of breakfast and brunch options.  There were a few good vegetarian options available (See menu photo).  We opted for the Beef and Bacon Burger (since they were out of waffles) and the Mushroom Bruschetta (without cheese).   I loved my bruschetta.  It was tasty and satisfying.  My bf said the burger was good.  Customer service was super friendly, fun, and helpful.  The guy making drinks (from New Zealand) made sitting at the counter fun.Pricing was reasonable.If we had more time, I'd visit again to try more things.  Rounding off from a 4.4, this eatery scored a strong 4.",1,,1
3,Azy B.,"Nutley, NJ",3,21,23,3.0,11/14/2018,I have been there yesterday. They DO NOT have Decaf and they don't NOT have turmeric latte. Apparently they had in the past but not anymore,,,
4,Rachel R.,"New York, NY",5,49,57,4.0,10/8/2018,"I like to take out-of-towners here for brunch cause everything is really cute and aesthetic-y from the way they hang their bacon to their tabletop arrangements. Plus afterwards you can do touristy stuff in Fidi. Place is tucked away off of a busy street in Fidi and it isn't huge so be sure to get here early. Stuff I've ordered before:Hanging Beef Jerky-comes with four bacon looking pieces with three dipping sauces. Pretty satisfying and a great app to share with others. Mushroom & Pesto Toast-Tastes just like how it sounds, yummy for  mushroom lovers. Avocado Toast with Added Bacon-Pretty standard. The seeds and tomatoes are a nice touch. Matcha Latte & French Press: Both were good. Service is always friendly although they do get busy at times. A solid Australian brunch joint!",1,,

I ordered the avocado toast I added egg Benedict and bacon. Omg it was soooo good ! Had so much flavor in it. I'm visiting from California so I doubt I'll be coming back anytime soon but I'd def suggest this place to anyone who lives or is visiting here. Live ya best life homies",1,,1

Updated review","I've returned twice since my original visit, and each time I was impressed with the consistency of the quality of all the dishes across the menu.  At some restaurants, you find that there are the preferred dishes to order on the menu, and the other dishes, mostly there for show, usually lacking in flavor, quality, focus, or some combination of those.  With Hole in the Wall however, it seems that every menu item is well-thought out and deftly executed, as I have yet to discover a dish I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  I still found that the fly problem hasn't been resolved as noted in my prior review, but the positives far outweigh the only negative I can think of here.I got the chili scrambled eggs on my first return visit.  The eggs were just as rich and decadent as those on the brekky roll, with the addition of the subtle kick of chili, balanced with a hint of lemon grounded in the leafy flavor of the micro greens.  This dish took a rather ordinary breakfast concept of scrambled eggs and turned them into something both flavorful and complex, neither being common adjectives for the humble scrambled egg. I definitely suggest this dish to open your mind to the creative potential of what is otherwise considered a common breakfast staple.  The only downside of this visit was the seeming surprise at my ordered a cocktail (the Speechless, a peach and gin drink).  The restaurant didn't seem prepared for the order, and was out of peach puree, a key component of the drink.  My next visit, I utilized the waitlist feature through Yelp, and whole heartedly endorse it.  Be sure to check in with the host by the time listed on your Yelp app, and you'll receive a text once your table is ready.  It really improves the customer experience in what would otherwise be considered an inevitable negative of the visit; the wait for your table.  Our server was incredibly personable as well, and made the atmosphere more comfortable. I ordered the waffles, taking a risky sweet turn compared to my usually savory breakfast preference.  However, Hole in the Wall did not disappoint, as the waffle, a denser, Liege waffle-style biscuit and which appeared to be decadent beyond belief, was actually nicely balanced with a cream cheese type topping, a berry reduction drizzled along with some butterscotch (I think; might've just been caramel). all topped with a banana and a side of syrup.  As mentioned, I'm not usually a sweets person, but if you find yourself so included, this is the perfect dish to get your sweet fix without fearing you've induced a sugar coma.  I also tried the pulled pork benedict, which seemed (from my two bites my girlfriend would deign to give up) to be a richly spiced and filling (though could've perhaps done with more hollandaise).  All in all, despite the admitted negatives, Hole in the Wall is a five star experience for the consistency.  Delicious, creative, and consistent quality make every visit a  positive experience, and the service is always great.  This should be your go-to brunch spot in the neighborhood.",,,
8,Meridith G.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,87,12,5.0,9/15/2018,"Impressed. Previous Yelp! reviews helped me choose this place when I'd just had an appointment in FiDi on a weekday and was quite hungry. A few things I really appreciated:1. Really nice servers. Cheerful!2. Clear menu, indicating possible allergens -- I have an extreme tree nut intolerance, so ordering food is always a little bit of a mine field. My server was so accommodating on this, and he completely volunteered -- I didn't have to ask.3. They had oat milk for coffee. I like oat milk with my tea, and I never expect to have it when I'm in a restaurant. Impressed.And then there was my food. Holy... IT WAS SO GOOD. I hate that I enjoy avocado toast as much as I do, but this place really brings it to another level. I added a poached egg, and truly... it was utter perfection.",2,,
9,Sarah H.,"New York, NY",218,136,278,4.0,10/16/2018,"This place is pretty small so there can be a wait! I came here by myself for brunch and waited about 20 min, if I'd come with other people it probably would have been even longer. I finally was seated at the counter, where I ordered coffee and the mushroom bruschetta. They have some different coffee and espresso options but I just went with a regular batch brew. It wasn't anything special but it got the job done! The mushroom bruschetta on the other hand was delicious. It had a pesto base, portobello and button mushrooms, and I believe it had truffle oil too. It's a decent sized portion, not just small appetizer bruschetta. I would definitely get it again if I come back. The service is a little slow and not that attentive, but everyone was friendly. It's a nice looking space but everyone is packed in on top of each other due to how small it is. Still, I enjoyed myself, and would come back when it's warmer to sit outside.",4,2,4

Updated review","Decided to give this place a second shot! This time I ordered the brioche french toast and it was perfection. Beautiful presentation and great taste-- not too soggy and perfectly sweet. Came with strawberries and black berries, which were the perfect combo with the pecan ricotta. My friend, the same friend that got the slightly charred brioche French toast last time, ordered a power bowl this time. Once again a beautiful presentation, very hearty and very filling! If you're looking for a solid, savory breakfast (that can honestly be shared between two if you've both got small appetites) then that's a great dish!Many thanks to Tom, the manager, for being so gracious and inviting us to come back!",,,1

15,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",62,267,845,3.0,7/8/2018,"I had brunch with girlfriends at this small and cute cafe on a 90 degrees summer weekend due to the great foodie pics and reviews on Yelp. We were seated indoors but the mosquitoes were our neighbors, they were buzzing around trying to hustle for a piece of toast, omelet, meat or perhaps swimming in a pool of foamy cappuccino is their idea of summer fun. There were a few nuisances - no ice in our glasses of water. There was an air conditioner in the back (near the ceiling) mounted on the wall but it was still not cool enough. Food was decent but standard in my opinion for my restaurants that serve brunches around FiDi. For the prices and accommodation, most brunch places around FiDi offer a small basket of bread, ice on the water and AC (that actually feels like there is AC) indoors. Hence 3 stars. Apologies to our mosquito friends - looks like we won't be seeing each other anytime soon.",,,
16,Brooklynbaby R.,"Manhattan, NY",55,196,23,3.0,9/16/2018,"Alright after finishing a 7 mile run this was our destination. We were a party of 10+ very hungry adults. I got 2 coffees and a spicy egg sandwich with bacon ($30). She forgot to put our order in?!?!We're 10+ people how can you forget that, we're kind of hard to miss. Finally we got our food and it was very good. The eggs were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and level of spice was on point. They gave us 5 croissants for the table for our trouble, it was a nice gesture but no not good enough. For overpriced eggs I must say I'm put off on how they handled this.",,,

The baristas are always very friendly and I love getting samples of the pastries which are very good. They have a range of different beverages to choose from and I really like their coffee. It is always made well and not burning hot but hot enough. You can start a punch card here and when you have enough punches you can get a freebie! They also have matcha lattes and chai lattes which are both pretty good. They also have a variety of alternative milks to choose from for vegans or lactose intolerants.

The waiter and waitress were all nice! [might need to wait during lunch time] there is some waiting about 20 mins I would say.

21,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",453,537,935,4.0,8/12/2018,"Continuing the growing trend of Australian influenced cafes and brunch spots, Hole in the Wall presents a solid offering of Australian café brunch staples including a scrambled eggs dish that packs a nice spicy punch along with the standard fare of avocado/brekkie toasts and protein/salad bowls. This is definitely a good change of pace and brunch option for residents in the FiDi area. Though my favorite part of Hole in the Wall is a shout-out to Yelp for providing the option of getting onto the waitlist while checking in on the app. This saves a lot of wait time especially at other similar spots like Two Hands or Banter where you have to be present just to put your name down on the waitlist and then wait 60 mins for a table.",2,,1

Everything on the menu sounded delicious and we definitely had a tough time deciding what to get! Of course, we each had to get our own coffees too. The coffee was pretty good but on the slightly acidic side to what I prefer. For food, I got the zucchini & halloumi fritters with an added poached egg. My friends got the chili scrambled eggs, wild mushrooms & avocado, and the brioche french toast. Everything was yummy and all the ingredients were fresh. I also felt that all their dishes, though using simple ingredients, were quite unique. The combination of flavors in each dish were also thoughtful and well balanced. We had no complaints at all.Overall, Hole in the Wall is a solid brunch place. I already know what else i'm going to try when I come back next time!",2,1,2

The glitch was unforseen and beyond his control but he did his best to make up for it by offering us each a cup of specialty coffee on the house.  When our meals finally came they were exquisite... Like, ridiculously delicious and beautifully presented, with an array of quality ingredients.  When our check was presented, in addition to the coffee on the house, he took 50% off the total bill.  Yep, that did it...

The cool thing is that we got to check our place in line via Yelp. Our table was available at around the 25 minutes mark. The bad thing is that they send you a text RIGHT when your table is available, so we had to sprint back to HITW from the Seaport since they only hold your table for 5 minutes.Food was amazing (flavor-wise). I got the Yelpers-approved Pulled Pork Benedict. I received only ONE poached egg with my Benedict. The second egg was more of a soft-boiled egg; it didn't have a runny yolk like it should've. For a whopping $17, I expected better. One of my friends ordered the exact same thing, but she received 2 beautifully poached egg. Where is the consistency? I didn't send the food back, nor did I make a scene to our waitress, because I'm not that kind of person. (My rule of thumb: If it's still edible, I keep it...) Anyway, there was a hearty amount of pulled pork on top of the toast. It was sweet and tangy and after a few bites a surprising heat kicks in. Kudos for that!Also, our waitress was great.

This place is more of a cafe, but they do have alcohol and we had the bloody Mary which was very yummy and pretty and the bacon that was in there was delish! No food to munch on on the menu to go with your alcohol. This is again like a cafe, not your usual place to come for drinks However service was awful. Don't know what was going on but all the staffs were busy on their laptops. We were just left there. No napkins, and when we needed another drink, we had to flag them down hard to get service.

When we first checked in, there was a long wait so my friends and I decided to walk around the area and wait for a text message to indicate that our table was ready. In the most dramatic fashion, we had walked a few minutes away from the restaurant and then got a text message saying our table was ready and we needed to get back in 5 minutes. So ridiculous as we were told it would be a 45- minute wait. Like, plan your shit better cause making me run back to the restaurant is a really good way to piss people off. Moving on the space -- I thought it was a cute place but the table was sticky and literally we were the only table without a vase of flowers. These are small details but they matter. Several menu items were not available as they ran out. I ordered the eggs benedict on top of pulled pork which was tasty but I shit you not, it was just a sizable piece of bread with the pork, the 2 eggs, two tablespoons of a bean and onion salad and a slice of lemon. No salad, no hashbrowns, nothing but two tablespoons of wimpy salad -- in a $17 dish. I mean it was delicious and the lemon worked great; there were also pieces of apple and that was amazing too. I don't have any doubt that this place has very inventive combinations but, I don't think I'll be back.",,2,

35,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",465,862,4808,3.0,12/5/2017,"I was randomly looking for a place for brunch around FiDi and found Hole in the Wall. The place is located in an apartment building. It's a little bit hard to find because the front is blocked by plywood/OSB walls. I was intrigued since I've never been to any Aussie cafe or restaurant before. All the servers here are Australian so you can enjoy some Aussie accents as you dine.I was surprised at how crowded the place was. They have mostly communal tables and the entire restaurant was full when we put our names down. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait long. Only about 20 min. You can put your down name and number and they'll text you when there is a spot. You can also check where on the waiting list you are.For starters we ordered the Hanging Bacon Jerky. The bacon was really nothing more than 4 dried strips of bacon on clothespins. It came with curried egg salad, a Bloody Mary sauce, and Sriracha mayo. I liked the egg salad, but was not a fan of the other sauces. The annoying thing was that the bacon was very dry. I guess some people like their bacon drier, but given it was described as jerky, I thought it would be somewhat chewier. I don't think this was worth $12.I ordered the Beet Cured Salmon which comes with zucchini & halloumi fritters and smashed avocado. I added a poached egg for an extra $3. I really liked the fritters even though they were not crispy despite being fried. The salmon tasted strange. It had a weird rubbery taste to it. My dining partner ordered the Pulled Pork Benedict and neither of us was a fan of this. The pork was under-seasoned and made the bread underneath very soggy. I did enjoy the slightly spicy and pickled beets that came with it. Get the homemade Tim Tam for dessert! This was my favorite thing we ordered. I love tim tams so ordering this was fun. It comes from the fridge, so it is hard and cold. It's quite hard to cut with a knife so be careful. I think this place would be a great place to come if you live in the area, but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here.",8,2,4

Updated review","For months this has been my go to place for brunch, but the quality is really going downhill lately. Today I had the pulled pork benedict, which I've had 3-4 times before. Mine not only came out kind of cold, but both poached eggs were overcooked and the yolk was hardened. It was essentially two boiled eggs on top of pulled pork. A real tragedy. The pulled pork was seasoned well and tastes great, but could not salvage the eggs. We also ordered the chili scrambled eggs, which I think could have been seasoned a little more. This one also came out kind of cold, and the bread underneath was already soggy when we got it. A really disappointing visit. At least the mocha was good as usual.",,,

Quite the contrary, although they might have been inspired by the construction that completely hides this Australian haven!Currently a little hard to find due to the building construction, I found this place situated in the lobby of an apartment complex. I was greeted immediately with menus and was asked if I'd like to order a drink. I went for my usual, iced espresso. And eventually ordered zucchini (cheese) frotters with smoked salmon over light salad w dressing. It was absolutely delicious. It's not very cheap but the a good portion. I saved half of my dish for a second meal. Plus you're paying for the ambiance, excellent service, and amazing food and aesthetics (from the restaurant interior and also beautiful food set up).Another place I will hide out at to find some solace!",1,,

40,Leanna W.,"Pasadena, CA",76,379,97,3.0,12/8/2017,"Hole in the Wall - a tasty place that has a ton of potential, probably between 3-4 stars. My sister and I stumbled across the restaurant after an early morning on the Brooklyn Bridge - we were hungry and ready to EAT. We literally were the second customers of the day as we got there right as it opened, so we were seated immediately. As there were few options that did NOT include a sizeable amount of red meat (more on that in a bit), I settled for the açaí bowl - which was AMAZING. So refreshing, so filling, and such a perfect combination of fruit, granola, and açaí mix. Happy happy happy. My sister got the chili scrambled eggs, which were a very large portion of scrambled eggs, bacon, and avocado on toast, and very tasty and savory. So...two stars docked for a variety of reasons. First of all, a lot of the food was quite heavy on the meat; very few vegetarian or vegan dishes. There were indeed a few, but many many more bacon-predominant dishes. Secondly, they were horrendously understaffed - we had to constantly flag down the waiter for everything - our coffee/tea orders, our food order, our check. The restaurant itself was also stiflingly warm and muggy, despite it being a cool morning. As we left too, the line was VERY long and there is almost no area to sit and wait, and tables are crowded one by one next to each. Most of the waiters have Australian accents, which is always a bonus. Lots of lucrative potential; maybe we had just an off day there in terms of the staffing. I think that with the above things ironed out, along with some better vegetarian options, Hole in the Wall will be a winner.",1,,

It is a 'hole in the wall' compared to some other places in the city but the space doesn't feel dingy.

The waiting area in the restaurant is probably made for 10 people max and there were 25 squished in there. I felt bad for people eating at tables near the door because the people, that were waiting, were over flowing into their space and the door opening and closing was making them cold. I would suggest a larger waiting area away from tables were people are eating. The food was really impressive and tasty and the espresso martini was so delicious! The prices were a little high for my liking for brunch food since it's not expensive to make. I would go back for the food possibly if they adjusted their prices but not the atmosphere.",,,

Servers were friendly!I ordered the açaí bowl ($10) which was delicious. Topped with blueberries, kiwi, chia seeds, and granola, it was actually a pretty big bowl compared to how it looked. I also tried some of the Hanging Bacon with the 3 dipping sauces ($12), turns out the dipping sauces were (by my taste, it wasn't written anywhere) something like sour cream and onion, chipotle mayo, and curry. The bacon itself was salty, like beef jerky style (which is how it's advertised). The homemade Tim tam ($4) was my favorite. Tasted just like a regular Tim tam but bigger and Home made!",1,,1

Updated review","This is updated review. Previously I'd said one star for the service and five stars for the review, averaging to 3 stars (rounding up). HOWEVER, this is where the update comes in: They have changed the menu and the ones I've tried so far have not impressed me. Presentation is mediocre compared to before, as is taste. RIP, old chili scrambled eggs. RIP, old mushroom dish that I can't remember the name of. RIP, old menu. It is also more overpriced than before since we're getting less quality. So now: Still the 1 star for service, 3 stars for food if I'm being generous. This unfortunately averages to a 2 star rating now. I will keep coming here only because the location is convenient for me.",1,1,

Updated review","Great Aussie atmosphere and food hidden away on a quiet block downtown.  Food was delicious, staff was busy, but accommodating.It was a little hot inside, but that was because of the steamy August heat.  Great coffee, eggs, toast. Went back for a dinner when it morphed into something else, but was a lot of fun and delicious.I am a fan.",,,
49,Shirley Z.,"Manhattan, NY",195,92,27,4.0,3/31/2018,"Cute little brunch spot in FIDI. Get on the waitlist before you come because there is going to be a wait, it's packed! The space is more than a hole in the wall but definitely still very tight. Most likely you do have to squeeze and share the communal table with other parties, sitting on stools with no back, which can be kind of awkward and uncomfortable.However, we really enjoyed everything we ordered. Food is delicious and was made with fresh ingredient; I'm not a huge coffee fan but their flat white tasted amazing. I got the pulled pork egg benedict - so good and very unique. We also wanted to get the Tim Tam but unfortunately it sold out :( Solid brunch place. I just wish they can more room and prepare more Tim Tam :)",10,3,8

51,Cathy J.,"New York, NY",249,166,91,4.0,10/29/2017,"This cute, bright Aussie brunch place is currently hidden behind loads of construction, but it's worth traversing the wood and beams to find! We came around 1pm on a Sunday. The place was packed, but we put our names down and 20 minutes later were seated at one of the large community style tables inside. Our waitress seemed very uninterested in being there that day, but what can I say. Having just moved here from LA, guess I should just accept that this is the culture here -- service in NY does *not* come with a smile?Drinks: Mum's apple pie was incredible. So so tasty, and really very much like pie! Friend found it too spicy -- it's very cinnamon heavy --  but I was a fan. Spiked hot toddy is also nice for a hot boozy breakfast drink. For the non-alcoholics out there, can't go wrong with the americano.Food: The acai bowl was freaking delicious and honestly a work of art. Highly recommend! Looking around our table at everyone else's meals, everything is generously portioned and beautifully plated, actually. Friend loved the breakfast focaccia, and the zucchini and halloumi fritters w/ poached egg were super unique. I found prices quite reasonable and you get your money's worth. We all left happy and stuffed, with no room to try the Tim Tams. Got to return soon!",1,,
52,Sophie P.,"Boston, MA",1017,406,1692,3.0,9/18/2017,"Hole in the Wall really is a hole in the wall tucked into a tiny corner of FiDi. They offer some outdoor seating, bar seating, and normal seating suitable for groups and parties of 2-4. I opted for the BREAKFAST BOARD ($15), which came with a tiny cold croissant, small avocado toast topped with arugula, pepper flakes, and pepitas, and the smallest yogurt topped with house made granola and a couple fruit. These are your classic brunch items altogether on a board, but the execution and portions could've been better!This is a great spot to get away from the business of the Financial District. All of the servers and hosts here have Australian accents! The minimalistic vibes and decor inside transport you to a cafe usually set in SoHo/Nolita, and is perfect if you work here or live in the area.",12,4,10

I think I detected an Aussie accent? The waitress was a bit more detached and seemed to be stretched between too many tables. I ordered the acai bowl which was five stars on presentation. It was so pretty and at only 9 bucks it surpasses comparably priced ones at juice shops and actual hole in the wall spaces in the area.The interior is well designed with lots of light and plants for all your Instagram worthy photo needs. The French toast was equally pleasing to eye and decorated with flowers as well. I see this as a nice place to pop in after my next run across the bridge.,3,2,2

A little off the beaten path in FiDi, it is tucked inside a building and there was construction going on in front of it. But once it was found I was very happy. Went on a Thursday morning, there was no wait, we were seated right away. When we got there were STARVING. Our eyes were much bigger than our stomachs. I started out with an almond milk latte - I really enjoyed it. Then we ordered:- Hanging bacon jerky - I didn't expect it to be cold, because it's bacon but it was good. The dipping sauces really made it. Cute for an Instagram picture but wasn't wow'd but it. - Smashed Avocado - this was one of my favorite things we ordered. I didn't expect it to be so huge! I loved the goat cheese on top, and a decent amount of the avocado spread was on it. Also the bread was perfectly toasted. Next time I will order this with a poached egg for sure. - Pulled Pork Benedict - I am a sucker for Benedict's. This one ranks up there. The pulled pork was delicious and the eggs were perfectly poached. The bread it was on was the same as the avocado toast. I am a fan. Would definitely order again. - Chili Scrambled Eggs - may have been my least favorite of the meal, would try something else besides this. I will definitely be back!",,,

Wonderful outdoor seating with friendly staff and not too bad of a wait on Saturday afternoon.Menu consists of regular brunch favorites then some interesting options sprinkled in. Decided on the Breakfast Brioche ($10) and a Turmeric Latte ($5). Drink comes out first; not too hot and a satisfying orange from it's namesake. Taste is rich but warming, settling the stomach before the meal. Sandwich includes a sunny up egg, bacon, mayo, and spinach all inside a soft brioche bun. A filling bite for sure, though a lot of the egg yolk ran off the sandwich as soon as I chomped into it. Again, service is great and we got our food fairly quickly after ordering.

The food didn't take too long to arrive either. The Breakfast Focaccia was served on a little board and it was HUGE. For the price amount, they gave a good amount of avocado, scrambled egg and bacon. The combo of those three items tasted amazing. The Pulled Pork Benedict came with a LOT of pork and there was a little side of beets, which was a nice touch along with the tiny apples on top of the poached egg. The prices were fair but a little too expensive for my broke student taste.

The hollandaise sauce (?) is also superb in tying the whole dish together. the açaí bowl was pretty standard but i wish there were more fruits on it! the granola had a fantastic almond taste and were very fresh and crunchy. the açaí bowl is not very thick, more smoothie like. added bonus is that literally everyone here has an australian accent !!! loved the experience!",1,,1
62,Dawn H.,"Queens, NY",19,91,340,3.0,8/8/2017,"Place was spacious, there's outdoor seating if you want some sunshine (3-4 tables for 2). Had this place bookmarked and I was excited to finally try it. We ordered the beet latte, turmeric latte, hanging bacon, pulled pork benedict, and breakfast board. I was never a fan of beets but my friend wanted to try it so here we go! Color was vibrant and it froth pretty well but beet flavor was very faint. Don't recommend. I had a good turmeric latte before but this one... it was horrible! Latte didn't cost much but it was SO watery, can barely taste the turmeric and it wasn't warm enough. Maybe it's the soy milk? I literally got warm water mixed with a bit of turmeric and added foam? They used the pacific brand soy milk FYI.Hanging bacon came with 4 slices and 3 different dips. Tomato salsa kind of dip, spiced mayo and an egg yolk (it wasn't really a dip because you would have the place the crumbled yolk on the bacon). Bacon was best eaten alone, sweet, salty and a bit smoked. I love the taste alone but I prefer the meat a tiny bit leaner because the meat part was super yummy! Presentation was unique and this is the selling point of a normal brunch place, it sold me! Breakfast board was ehhh. Cold croissant. Mashed avocado was flavorless, just some pepper flakes with a few arugula on a tiny toast. Avocado was fresh though. House made granola came with fresh fruits and yogurt. Pulled pork benedict had a lot going on. Big portion with decent amount of pork topped with 2 perfectly pouched eggs and hollandaise. Sweet thin apple slices on top made the difference and the surprising tasty beet relish. I didn't know how greasy the pulled pork was until I was almost done with the dish. Can cut back on butter and oils..Overall staffs were friendly, if I ever stop by I would love to try the Australian coffee.

We were seated inside, although the doors were ajar, giving the place a lovely open feeling. We ordered: 1) A flat white ($5) - delicious, strong yet gentle. Beautiful milk art on the top (so instagrammable)2) A bloody mary ($11) - this bloody mary kicked my ass. Definitely did not skimp on the vodka. I can drink like a sailor but halfway through and my hangover from the previous night was gone and I was rearing up to drink all day. Delicious, though, and love the bacon in it.3) The pulled pork benedict ($17) - this was easily our most disappointing dish. It wasn't bad, necessarily, just unimpressive. The hollandaise was eh and the pulled pork was pretty dry. That being said, the eggs were poached perfectly. 4) The french toast ($14) - came with bacon and some fruit, and was pretty delicious. Was also absolutely stunning in terms of presentation. The food was realistically just a 7/10, and just minimally too expensive for what it is.

It's pretty good with Kale, quinoa, egg, a type of pressed chese I don't know but taste good! It's healthy (even though I went out for cakes afterwards) My friends got french toast (only one toast). It's just regular your brunch cafe. No need to travel all the way down, but if you are nearby. Why not go for nice/healthy brunch place with good coffee.",1,,
78,Thais S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,10/6/2018,"This place was nice, although hole in the wall places usually are a bit run down but still good so the name made me question it. We sat outside at the table next to the door. There were a lot bosses stacked next to us which was kind of unappealing. Our waitress was really nice and gave good recommendations when we had trouble deciding. I had the shrimp and crab roll, which the waitress said would be creamy. I just didn't expect it to be that creamy. It's on this kind of tough chibatta like bread I guess and it was really hard to eat. It comes like a burger or a sandwich and is heavy on the avocado. You can't eat it that way because everything falls off but it's hard to cut with a knife. Still a really good choice taste wise.",,,
79,Sara G.,"Manhattan, NY",101,225,8,4.0,5/7/2017,"This is a great option for a casual weekend breakfast (and probably good for other meals, as well). I wouldn't describe it as cozy, but it is very cute in an Instagrammable kind of way: bright, airy, filled with copper accents and pastel dishes.I had the Avo Smash #2 which was a good serving. I added the egg and felt very full at the end. It says feta cheese on the menu but I am pretty sure it was actually goat- definitely didn't have that salty, tangy flavor you think of with feta.I also had a flat white which wasn't as silky as the best I've ever had but was still good.For avocado toast with the egg, flat white, and tip I spent $24.",2,2,1

I got my coffee at the end of my meal, after I finished my food. Come on.. it was one person serving like 25 people. that's now how it's supposed to go.  This is either the servers fault or mgt.  Hire more servers!  To make matters worse, there is like maybe one good seat at the bar area (out of like 5 chairs) the rest of them, have almost no space for your legs. It's very uncomfortable. Anyways, back to my episode.. so guess who is sitting at the only good seat at the bar? An employee of the restaurant (mgr maybe?). There he is clicking away on his laptop.

81,Lorita H.,"New York, NY",9,16,60,2.0,12/3/2017,"Do expect a long wait if going on weekends, and it's overrated.The restaurant is taking more customers than its kitchen capacity, or they are simply not good at managing orders. When we waited outside for a table and ordered a coffee, it never came because the coffee was sitting at the counter and no one told us it was ready until we checked 20-30 mins later. After we were finally seated after a one-hour wait, we were told the orders would take 30 mins to prepare, and those were just most ordinary breakfast dishes. We had high expectations because of the long wait (for the seats and the food), but the food was just mediocre......They do have very good coffee. But sorry would never come back again.",1,,
82,Marianne S.,"Queens, NY",148,440,1006,2.0,10/19/2017,"The yelp photos looked promising and perhaps that why I was so disappointed here. I expected too much.Firstly, there is some contrstruction going on so it wasn't the easiest place to find, despite a black sign posted up front directing people towards the establishment.Secondly, it was hot as balls, the weather outside was mid 60's and inside was a freaking sauna. It was super uncomfortable, the closer towards the back the hotter it was.Around 12, there was a lot of people here around and that was good. We entered and seated ourselves. The decor is very simple-woodsey. I could see everything happening in the back, which normally is okay but I rather not see the bugs crawling in the pantry room. Kind gross. Once we maneuvered our way through the compact tables, the waiter just came up to our table and squirted the top carelessly. We asked if we could have the table in the corner-she then proceeded to squirt that table too. And wiped it down. It was awkward. She came back with menus and left.I ordered the mushroom and avocado toast with a poached eggs. My friend also ordered another avocado toast. For a drink I had the bacon bloody mary.The food was okay-very simple. Something I could've whipped up at home. The drink was think-however the cold sweet bacon was yummy.Overall?

83,Quay X.,"Mountain View, CA",0,73,0,1.0,6/21/2018,"Like an oasis in the desert, this place is not what it appears.  They have the marketing right for an Aussie cafe -- plants everywhere, hip furnishings, serving a menu with ""brekky rolls,"" avocado toast, and power bowls.  And I was pleased to find this in the otherwise staid financial district. The problem?  The food is bad. My power bowl advertised sweet potato, broccolini, avocado, corn and black beans, and a poached egg.  I opted to add mushrooms, bringing my total to $19.  But the mushrooms were flavorless, the corn and black beans were straight out of the can or jar, the broccolini boiled into a mushy pale abyss. None of the finesse or freshness of ingredients to justify the price.  And the hodge podge of ingredients lacked any coherence in the bowl. This power bowl was far from electrifying.",,,

The place looked lovely, around 9:30am there were about 3 small empty tables in side but I was informed by this tall lady that they were only for bigger parties, and I could take place at the big table inside! **RUDE**. Within the next 5mins my cousin arrived and we sat at the big table. I didn't let that tall lady kill my morning, as I was excited to try their menu. I was not disappointed! Even better that one seated another lady took care of us, with an amazing sense of service.I've tried the cappuccino with oats milk sooooo yummy! My cousin had an espresso, but she wasn't impressed by it. We both had the Power Bowl and were absolutely in love with it. Not only was the presentation top, it tasted so good.

Everything we've tried is super tasty-and we've tried a lot! My go to is the mushroom avocado toast which is no longer on the menu because they redid their spring menu (sad face) fortunately, there are many other items on the menu that are delicious. We've had the avocado toast, pulled pork toast, burger and breakfast sandwich. All very tasty.",,,1

Food is fresh but unfortunately overpriced like many spots similar to it.  Hospitality is warm except- oddly, like another reviewer said, male servers are all nicer.  I thought maybe because I'm a female but the interactions did not vary with other tables. There's one girl that's consistently miserable for no reason. Hate, hate when the check is brought to me without being asked. Like ok, you don't want me to spend more, bye.  I'm sticking with a higher rating because it doesn't represent the general business and food quality. But she should change that. Because to someone else, it will.Also, wear your hair up and don't wear your nice coat.  No ventilation in there and I come out with a food smell with strength comparable to that of kbbq sans garlic.",1,1,1

Updated review","Im feeling so much love for this place right now. The decor and music just makes you feel warm and happy. I came here once after a night shift for brunch and my turmeric latte was delicious, my pulled pork Benedict a bit on the dry side. What bumps this place up is how it consistently delivers good coffee when we need it at the hospital. Thank you!!",1,,

Kinda hard to find cause there was some construction going on, the place gets a little full and because of the size there was a wait. The servers were nice and the food was pretty good. Not my favorite eggs Benedict but it was alright. The bacon presentation was probably my favorite thing about the brunch lol.",,,
90,Meghan B.,"Denver, CO",233,15,6,5.0,5/4/2018,Such a cute place for brunch! Quick service and cool hipster vibe. I loved the plants and the lighting. The food was also great and so were the drinks.

91,Brittany G.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",302,65,9,5.0,3/26/2018,Amazing small brunch restaurant.  All of the ingredients were very fresh.  We ordered the avocado toast and the chili scramble and have no complaints at all.  The staff was super friendly and attentive :),2,,
92,Holly M.,"New York, NY",41,105,175,3.0,11/11/2017,"Busy little ""hole in the wall"", but the wait was not too bad. It's an Australian joint that's just a bit over priced, but it was pretty good Avo toast i suppose. It great if you live in the area and want a low key brunch spot, but I wouldn't travel just to try it. They did forget a drink we ordered and added it to the bill, but they were nice about removing. They certainly don't have the best costumer service, but it wasn't rude. I would probably not go there again because if the price, I piece of toast with avocado and seasoning is certainly not worth 11 dollars in my opinion.",,,
93,Arielle R.,"Great Neck, NY",0,7,7,4.0,8/1/2018,Such an adorable breakfast/ lunch scene. Waiters are very nice and quick. I had the Avocado Toast & LOVED it!! Didn't take too long for the food to come either. Very hipster and cute. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.,1,,

Very  efficient servers, rich options on the menu, tasty food, and a great morning vibe. Food: Chilli Pepper Scrambled eggs- Perfect consistency and chilli pepper was just the right addition.Also got a latte which was one of the best I've had.

Yesterday was not too hot, so it was the perfect day to try a  non-air conditioned establishment. Pulled pork Benedict and avocado smash were fantastic. Chilli scrambled was also very good! It's a somewhat small dining room with a few community tables, but you can put your name on the wait list online so that helps.",,,

Full disclosure, I work for an Australian company. Mostly, it's a good solid spot for things like avocado toast, chili scrambled eggs, breakfast sandwiches on brioche, fresh squeezed orange juice, and quality caffeinated beverages. They do bacon really well here.Kind of pricey but on par with everything else around the Wall Street area.",2,,2

I gave it a 3 because the service was great as the host and waitress were very attentive and nice. We got the pulled pork Benedict and it was ok. Nothing special.

108,Michelle S.,"Woodbury, NY",447,15,16,4.0,7/31/2017,"I came here on a Sunday around 11 AM for brunch, and I was pretty pleased. The place fits its name as a ""hole in the wall"", being located within a quiet alley. I chose to be seated outside (a bit of a mistake as the sun was blaring and they don't have any sort of cover to provide shade), so definitely be cautious about that if you come on a sunny day! The wait was long for only having ordered two dishes and a latte (main reason for knocking off a star). However, the food allowed the place to redeem itself. The beetroot latte is a beautiful red-pink, and tasted extremely creamy (with strong hints of the beetroot). I happened to enjoy it very much, but it definitely isn't for everyone. My favorite was the French toast. It was just right in terms of quantity (two medium pieces), was the perfect amount of sweetness, and was accompanied by fresh fruit and the most amazing caramelized bacon ever (and this is coming from someone who usually hates bacon). In addition to this, we also got the acai bowl, which was good and refreshing.The service (aside from the wait time) was great, and the food aesthetic is definitely there.",2,,1
109,Katrina B.,"Orlando, FL",4,15,2,5.0,7/10/2018,Found this little gem on Yelp. We wanted something different from the normal breakfast. This place was just what I was thinking of.  Food was awesome as well.,1,,
110,Sharon L.,"New York, NY",191,105,162,2.0,1/23/2018,"I utilized the ""waitlist"" mobile service to put my reservation in the queue, which worked out perfectly when I arrived - there was a table for two cleaned and ready to go. Thanks, Yelp, for that feature. The restaurant itself is brightly lit and charming - green potted plants, white-painted park bench seating. It's an open kitchen where you have full view of the chefs making your food, which is a plus (don't want any ""Waiting"" style accompaniments to your entree) - on assessment, the kitchen space was clean and spacious.Unfortunately, I cannot give stars solely on atmosphere and decor.Let me preface this with saying that it was a $50 breakfast for two. I ordered the breakfast spread, which comes with granola, avocado toast, and a croissant. Not only was the croissant small but it was stale. There was no buttery taste to it that you'd hope a croissant would come with. The granola was served in mini cup (probably the best tasting of the three options). The third, the avocado toast, was extremely disappointing. Clearly, if you follow my Yelp reviews, you'd know that I order the avocado toast at any bfast/brunch establishment. I'm a generous reviewer as I am a big fan of the combination. Usually when you slap the two together it's delicious. However, my avocado toast was served on dry toast, and the avocado spread was made from a way-overripe avocado that was more brown than green. Visually offputting, and it also tasted funky. Was it a bad avocado? Why was it used in a customer's meal??My husband ordered the chili style eggs on toast with a side of baked beans ($3 for this side, which unmistakably came out of a can) - laughable that they call it a ""side"" because it was served in a ketchup-serving mini cup. $3 would have gotten us 6 full sized cans of baked beans. By principle, it was not okay - we are not at Nobu or Per Se.",2,1,1
111,Wen Na Z.,"Ticonderoga, NY",428,110,139,4.0,9/22/2017,"Due to ongoing construction, the joint almost takes a literal definition to its name and can be easily missed. The place is relatively small, but embraces the hipster vibes, and creates aesthetically pleasing presentation of their food. We came around 1pm with a party of 6, and despite being busy, we were quickly seated once our entire group arrived. I ordered the acai bowl which was delightfully refreshing and tasted almost like a strawberry banana smoothie. I also tried the zucchini fritters with smoked salmon, but I would say the salmon was a little too salty for my liking. Note: They do not take reservations by phone call and can get quite busy, however they will take your name down when you arrive and let you know when there is a table available for you.",,,

113,Erica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,29,0,2.0,12/29/2017,"A few issues, primarily with the service.  As some people noted before, it is a little hard to find because of the location in a building and the construction right outside.  It is also pretty small.When I arrived, I came inside and noticed most of the seating is communal.  There wasn't anyone greeting at the door so I wasn't sure how it worked.  I saw a waitress (she was short, with pixie style hair cut and dark hair) and I asked her how did the seating work.  During this time, I also noticed that a table opened up so I asked her if that table was available.She had an instant attitude and said,  ""that table is not available and you should wait here.""  I looked around and did not see anyone waiting and there wasn't any seating available where I was standing.  I also added that I needed a table for two and she answered with the same attitude, ""well, you can wait until your guest arrives and we will seat you"".  As I turned around to awkwardly stand by the door and taken aback by the unnecessary rudeness of the waitress, a waiter happened to come from the back and asked me if I am being helped.  Strange, since the waitress totally ignored me when I arrived.  I told him actually no, I am not being helped and I asked him if there was any seating available.  At the same moment, the rude waitress piped in and said, ""that table is already taken...I am using that table"".  However, the waiter spotted another table that was available and he sat me down and gave me some menus.  As I sat waiting for my friend, the waitress never stopped by my table to ask me if I wanted anything.  Nothing.  My friend finally arrived maybe about 10 minutes after I sat down.  During this time, she begrudgingly placed a water bottle and cups.  We looked over the menu, and she didn't come back.  The waiter came by and he took our orders.  I saw some people who sat after us, get their food before us but at that time I was already over it.  Finally, our food came and surprise, surprise...there wasn't any silverware.  So, I asked the waitress can we have silverware and with an attitude, she replied ""I am bringing them"".We ate our meal, I had the brioche french toast and he had the pulled pork.  It was tasty.Finally, it was time to pay.  No one came to our table to ask if the food was okay or if we needed anything else.  We had to flag down the waitress to pay.  She came over to the table with the credit card machine and the bill.  While my friend was literally signing the tablet, she shoved it to him and said here and walked away.   I will say to be fair, it was a busy day and they seemed a little understaffed.  I would of been more understanding had it not been for the lack of customer service skills from the pixie cut waitress.  The waiter was just as busy as her and he was pleasant.It is a shame because the food was pretty good and the presentation is nice however, the menu is a little pricey.  The problem is that there are a lot of delicious restaurants where the staff have better customer service skills.  Maybe it was a one off and I may try them again, we shall see.",4,3,

With all that said, I probably won't go back here the next time I'm in the city.  It was okay, it just didn't wow me.",,,

Updated review","I saw the hanging bacon jerky with wooden clips pictures  on yelp, and had to find out what it was like to eat it! My boyfriend and I came here two weekends ago - on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't crowded (thank god), but I'm sure it will once when everyone finds out about this place. I'll give it a few weeks!We of course had the hanging bacon jerky. I had the green bowl (kale, quinoa, poached egg, yoghurt..) and my boyfriend had the pulled pork Benedict; both of us had the Aussie iced coffee (which was coffee with coffee or caramel ice cream). Both dishes were AMAZING and it's obvious that they use fresh ingredients, and made sure the ingredients used were proportionate. The hanging bacon jerkys were great- very chewy indeed. The mix of fat and lean meat made my bacon experience very enjoyable. :PGetting to a hole in the wall was quick, although hidden next to a parking lot. If you go I would highly recommend for you to sit outside!",3,1,2
125,Diane K.,"New York, NY",216,108,702,4.0,8/16/2017,"Another nice brunch place in the financial district area. It's a cute cafe style place located on the first floor of a building, sandwiched between two taller buildings, hence, the name of the restaurant. I love the interior - everything wood! It's got this simple and clean feeling when you sit in on a Saturday early afternoon. They seem to attract the locals, dressed up in sports outfits with their bikes parked in front. They serve brunch until 4pm! They have a good brunch selection and its popular dish is the hanging bacon jerky (didn't try it but everyone around us ordered it). Their daily smoothie ($8.5) was SO GOOD...it contained some mango or pineapple sort of tropical fruits...forgot the exacts. But it came in a small masonry jar so it was on a pricy side especially when you couldn't get enough of it. Boyfriend and I got the ""Beet Cured Salmon"" and ""Brioche French Toast"". The beer cure salmon was one of a kind - that was something that stood up. Both dishes were overall really good but their portion ran small. It is definitely a neat place to grab something colorful and semi-healthy.",,,

The homemade Tim Tam was really really sweet, but good with coffee.There were a couple of hiccups, however. The mimosas, which the menu says are made with fresh squeezed orange juice, were actually made with Tropicana out of a bottle. Fresh juice would've made for a much tastier drink. Additionally, we ordered a cappuccino and ended up getting one with Nutella inside. It wasn't awful, but definitely not what we were expecting.",1,,

Wait time was horrible, and we miamians had to wait outside in the 25 degree weather... while starving... and pregnant in my case, so already off to a bad start. Luckily we were sat within 15 minutes when the wait time was said to be 30 minutes. Hubby had the pulled pork Benedict and a Bloody Mary while I had the breakfast focaccia, no alcohol for me :( but I must say both meals were delicious, his Benedict was a little better than my focaccia, and my meal was awfully messy (definitely not first-date brunch meal material). However I had to take off a star for the lack luster service. Absolutely no one came to check on us to see how we were doing or even if we liked our meal, but the moment the check was dropped you better believe they were looking for that payment method like hawks.

The pulled pork Benedict was amazing! Succulent pork and great hollandaise sauce.

My friends enjoyed their eggs benedict and chilli scrambled eggs as well.  The real highlight of the meal was the bacon, as well as their flavorful espresso drinks.  Because we all live in the neighborhood and this is a solid brunch spot, we will absolutely be back.",1,,1

I ordered the french toast and it was really good. It comes with bacon on the side so its worth the $10. It tasted like coconut which was different but pleasant. It wasn't too sweet and had just enough syrup. Fruit was also very fresh. They don't have bellini's which is upsetting but their mimosas are okay. They have an espresso martini that is apparently their most popular but I personally did not like it. The espresso taste is very strong and then there is an overwhelming liquor taste. Both my friend and I could not drink it. Disclosure, I'm not a huge drinker so maybe thats it. Overall, I would come again in the far future since I live close but the menu is limited enough that I won't come often.",,,

The photos on yelp made the place look like it had an open bright atmosphere, but when we arrived, it wasn't so. The outside wasn't inviting, and the inside was much darker and cluttered than I thought it would be. We decided to stay anyways, and we're very glad we did! The food was very good! The guys complained a little about the portion size, they wanted a little more to eat that what we got, especially for the price. But overall everyone was very happy with both the food and drinks.

I've had the beet cured salmon and the zucchini fritters - both of which look super weird when you get them but they are tasty. Their food is their saving grace because their service is pretty bad, even with the multiple times I've come here. I noticed they never write down the orders and you should never ask for a special order because they'll butcher it. They'll never check on you and they'll forget to bring you what you asked for. Additionally, I walked in alone once hoping to take something to go, and they didn't even acknowledge me. Just handed me a menu and walked off. Not a bad spot if you're looking for a cute local brunch spot but not worth an effort to come here.",1,,

146,Stacey S.,"New York, NY",108,41,47,5.0,4/30/2017,"Sorry to say how GOOD this place is. Sorry because it's across the street from my apartment and too many good reviews and it will fill up ;)It's only their third day so I wouldn't normally post a review yet. However, these adorable Aussies seem to have their act together already. As a vegetarian who is dating a carnivore, it's always nice to find a place for both of us that's not a compromise. Hanging bacon with multiple dipping sauces for him and avocado smash with a poached egg for me. Thumbs up for both. Matcha latte was nice, most people will find it to be well balanced, but for my taste I will be asking for some extra Matcha next time. The baked goods are from a mixture of places like Balthazar and Colson. The bread was the perfect compliment to avo smash - it held up well with the right balance  of airy and crisp. The space is light and airy and benefits from being set back from the street with ample outdoor seating already built in if you want to grab your coffee and treats to go. Good tunes are playing and thankfully it's not too loud. Waitstaff is smiling and eager to please. Single bright Gerber daisies adorn each table for a little splash of color in an otherwise wood, white and copper motif. Which is a fine backdrop to the fresh, simple but delicious brunch we devoured.Yet to come: family table in the front, outdoor seating, expanded menu and hours. I will continue to update this as I plan on being here often.* update: I can assure Henry that my reviews are not 'dubious'. . Although I disagree with much of his 'not so stellar' review, I did agree that the matcha was definitely on the weak side. Keep in mind this is a soft opening and they had been open less than 4days. I have to allow time for a new place to find their footing. Good news is that they have since doubled the Matcha serving. So, what matters to me is- do they take feedback well and respond? Yes. Yes, they did.*update - family table is in - great alternative to my usual Starbuck's wifi.*Update - portions have been enlarged. They listened :)",3,1,1
147,Miriam M.,"Clearwater, FL",139,9,5,5.0,12/8/2017,"This is an amazing brunch place!!! We highly recommend their coffee drinks and the mushroom avocado toast. We also loved the banana bread toast! The service was very friendly, and we loved the Aussie vibe.",1,,
148,Elesi D.,"Tampa, FL",61,151,823,5.0,12/22/2017,Its different. Its Australian and its difficult to find due to construction work right outside the building. We came across this place through yelp of course and we walked in to be seated. Not in a Saturday morning as this place requires reservations on weekends. Who knew? Well we waited for about 15 mins and we were eventually seated. Their simply made wooden seats aren't the most comfortable but it grows on you as time passes. The menu was interesting and I wanted to try something interesting. I ordered a breakfast kale salad which was amazing. The kale was fresh and eggs were fresh and the flavors were amazing and filling as well. I also tried one on their breakfast sandwich since I thought the kale salad would not be enough. The salad was enough and the sandwich was good. Service was quick and friendly. This is the type of breakfast one needs to have to add a boost of brain power to a hectic day,,,

Many FiDi coffee shops are not big enough to allow for seating, let alone a meeting. I love the out-of-the-way places in FiDi and this did not disappoint.The Australian staff was very friendly. I had a cappuccino and it was everything I needed: creamy, sweet, and refreshing. The space is brightly lit, and the tables spacious enough for laptops. I forgot to take note of the outlets, but I didn't have any issues.This is a good example of an all-day cafe that also serves alcohol.  While my meeting soon came to an end and I didn't stay, I could see this being a good place for group outings where not everyone drinks, or for film crew meetings (like mine was!) where day soon turns to night and it's time to have fun.",,,

Both the service and presentation was on point. I had the avo #2 with a poached egg and tried my gf's breakfast bowl. Both had great flavor. We also ordered the bacon jerky for the table... really unique and although not apart of my standard diet, I had to give it a try. These little strips are perfectly crisp, with the right balance of sweet and salty the sauces are as equally unique as the jerky itself and offer a nice complimentary flavor... 3 sauces each with a very distinct profile. Definitely a must try for your first time here of with a group. And the halloumi is grilled to perfection, just as one would expect from this Australian inspired gem!Overall it's a great vibe with plenty of healthy and indulgent options to appease any crowd. It is quickly becoming a neighborhood hot spot... even came back the next day for coffee and an acai bowl. By next month I'm likely to become a regular at this rate.

Our drinks were great (fresh orange juice, coffee whiskey cocktail, cold brew) and the food was even better. The pulled pork Benedict was phenomenal - definitely our favorite dish - and the avocado toast and clothesline bacon were awesome, too. As for pastries, we tried the almond and chocolate croissants and homemade Tim Tam. The almond croissant was the better of the two, and the cookie was so good.

Especially with all the construction that was going on, it wasn't the easiest to find this spot. However, if you just follow the signs and keep walking inwards, you will end up at this beautifully lit, simply designed brunch spot. As I said, it definitely lives up to its name and there are not many tables. My sister and I luckily went earlier in the day on a Saturday but the place was soon packed with people waiting outside. I ordered the mushroom toast and my sister ordered the pulled pork benedict with a flat white. We, of course, had to try the hanging bacon jerky. The food did take some time to come out and our entrees came out before the bacon appetizer came out. However, everything was made up with the food. My entrée was generously portions with two huge pieces of toast loaded with mushrooms, a poached egg, arugula and spicy peppers. I love spice but I had to take off some of these peppers and give them to my sister who thought needed some spice in her dish. She thoroughly enjoyed her pulled pork benedict and we both loved the bacon. It was fun, whimsical and tasty- I mean, when can you go wrong with strips of bacon. It was a win in my brunch book and will definitely be back!",,,

I ordered the bacon jerky of course and the homemade Tim tams as it was a must try according to most of the reviews. Both items arrived pretty quickly. I ate the bacon jerky first. It came with 3 dipping sauces in what appears to be curry, sour cream and onions, and spicy mayo. The name does not lie, it is jerky bacon. It was pretty good and unique, definitely something instant worthy but not all the hype it made it to be. I didn't really taste much of the sour cream and onion sauce. To be honest, I think the jerky is best alone without any sauce. The homemade Tim tam deserved praise. Was like a bigger and better Tim tam you get from the supermarket.

In hindsight, we should have.Once inside, the waiter ignored us for a solid 5 minutes, walking by us several times without greeting or seating us. The one good thing was their coffee, which was excellent.The French toast was decidedly mediocre. They also tried to serve it without the bacon. When I asked if this wasn't supposed to have bacon on it, the waitress matter-of-factly said ""yes, I left it off"" and unapologetically brought over a little side dish with bacon (which was the redeeming ingredient of the dish, but then again it's hard to screw up bacon).If you're looking mediocre food in an uninviting ambience with horrible service, this is the place for you.",,,

175,Margi T.,"Saratoga, CA",83,448,76,4.0,9/15/2017,"This place is too hip for me. Just being honest here.We took our kids here for brunch on the weekend. The outside seating is lovely, except we were scorching in the June heat. Market umbrellas would have been a nice touch. My vampire-like kids couldn't hang and ended taking their plates across the courtyard, into the shade. I ordered the boys berry smoothies, which they oddly refused to drink. I took a sip and understood why. I wouldn't even drink it and it was hella expensive.The smashed avocado toast with goats cheese, arugula, sunflower + pumpkin seeds, and egg was as fab as it sounds, of course. My husband and boys enjoyed the fancy hanging bacon with dipping sauces. The brioche French toast was a little over the top for kids. Kind of bummed they don't have some more kid-friendly menu items.Lovely place to brunch if you're young, hip, and don't mind dropping $100 on breakfast for 2 adults + 2 young kids (ouch).",1,2,
176,Jessie G.,"Manhattan, NY",1051,4,5,5.0,1/25/2018,Sooooo good. Great FiDi brunch place. You want their hot sauce. Unclear what the hot sauce is.... all I know is that it is amazing and I'm not above drinking it.,,,
177,Jennie K.,"San Francisco, CA",5,6,1,5.0,5/24/2018,I had the avocado toast with poached egg and an iced coffee. Everything was amazing! Great quick service and friendly staff.,,,
178,Christine D.,"Sun City West, AZ",0,2,0,5.0,6/23/2018,"Great place for a wholesome late breakfast.  They were happy to let us split a benny, which was an ample breakfast for two. Nice staff; great food,",,,
179,Laura P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,342,0,4.0,8/17/2017,"Another Aussie cafe for the win! Hole in the Wall is a great addition to the financial district, serving up coffee, breakfast, brunch, and lunch dishes until the kitchen closes at 4 pm. You can stay for another couple of hours after this munching on pastries and drinking beverages. With all the construction in the area, it's really well hidden under the scaffolding, so watch out for one of their outdoor signs pointing you in the right direction.Matching the quality and vibe of other Aussie cafes around the city, Hole in the Wall has food that's both instragram-worthy and delicious. Pretty good is great and all, but if the taste doesn't match, what's the point? Each dish is carefully crafted to consider both flavor and visual appeal, so the dishes are colorful and carefully assembled.All the classic options are available: eggs, toasts, oatmeal, fruit, pancakes, etc. And the nice thing is that they do the classics really well. The avocado toast, a dish so overdone these days and often extremely mediocre, is delicious here. Crusty bread, avocado, lemon, olive oil, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, red pepper flakes, and goat cheese. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are spot on.The croissant is another example. Though they don't make it themselves (who does), the one they serve is very good quality. Buttery, flaky, crispy, yet soft. Hole in the Wall values good quality.If you want a little bit of everything, I'd recommend the breakfast board. It comes with avocado toast, granola, and a croissant. Each one of them is small, but together it's a decent size. The granola is home made and comes with orange and yogurt panna cotta. The avocado toast is the same delicious one as described above.The acai bowl with coconut, home made granola, chia seeds, and seasonal fruit, is another popular choice. It's also quite beautiful. And if you want bacon with flare, you've got to try the hanging bacon jerky that comes hanging on what can only be described as a miniature clothes line with clothes pins.Hole in the Wall has two locations: midtown and downtown. The midtown location is really just a tiny coffee shop. The downtown location has proper seating, both indoor and out. From the vibe and ambiance of the place, you would never think there was full table service, but there is. It's super casual and laid back, you'll never be rushed, but servers are always available if you need something. The staff is also very personable and friendly.I'm happy to see this place thriving and they have plans to expand even more. Especially if you're in FIDI, definitely go check it out. It's one of the best, most innovative things around in an area that has a total dearth of good options. Though I was disappointed that they didn't have vegemite on the menu, they have more than enough good stuff to make up for it!",3,,1
180,Hamilton W.,"New York, NY",45,166,9,4.0,10/13/2017,"literally a hole in the wall right now since the outside is construction. Walk through the cheap looking wood walls, and make a left. Slightly expensive for a sandwich but nothing too crazy for the area. Also get the nutella latte, it's heavenly.",,,
181,Anthony V.,"Miami, FL",1,12,16,4.0,11/30/2017,One word amazing and super nice staff. Options had me confused which is always good because that means they have good options. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting or living in New York. Just go you will not be disappointed.,,,
182,Amanda M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/18/2018,I called in my order for take out and clearly said no nuts I am allergic! I ordered the French toast without the pecan ricotta. I immediately smelt nuts on the chocolate crumbs when I opened the box. It does not say there are nuts on the menu. I kindly called back to tell the girl that I said no nuts and she gave me an attitude when I asked them to make a new one. This is how you kill people. Please adjust your menu to show all ingredients. Please hire competent employees who know how to take an order correctly. With that said I live upstairs and will not be eating there ever again!,,,
183,Hal R.,"Manassas, VA",49,32,27,4.0,12/19/2017,Chai latte was great. Egg toast and French toast were both great. Music was a little loud but aside from that a great atmosphere and delicious food!,,,
184,Stephanie A.,"San Jose, CA",23,53,3,5.0,5/6/2018,"Omgosh this was delicious!! I had the mushroom & avocado toast with a poached egg. The attention to detail was superb, especially the pesto drizzle along the edge of the cobalt blue plate. My husband and son loved the French Toast. Although not a large place, they got us a table pretty quickly and were very friendly. Already looking forward to going back next time we are in town!",,,
185,Jonathan G.,"Glen Head, NY",0,29,3,5.0,5/4/2018,"The atmosphere at ""Hole in the Wall"" was terrific.  It gave off a young, hip, trendy vibe.  The clientele were all people in their 20s and 30s.  The servers were extremely friendly and kind.  The seated us immediately and poured water for us before we even sat down.  They came by frequently to take our orders and refill our beverages.  The hanging bacon was not only an artistic and novel way to serve bacon but also a delicious dish.",,,
186,Ms. J.,"Irving, TX",1,124,18,4.0,11/17/2017,"Decided to try Hole In the Wall based on Yelpers' overall rating.  Short and sweet... Awesome, but pricey, food!Great spot if you love fresh, flavorful, unique food... and, don't mind paying a premium for it. Come prepared to spend $20 - $30 per person for brunch and enjoy the hip vibe. We made food selections based on Yelp photos and staff suggestions. We were very pleased with everything.  - Tumeric Chai (missed the photo opp)- Tumeric Latte (will make you want another)- Zucchini Fritters (yummy, fresh off the grill)- Smashed Avocado (heaping with tasty toppings)- Chilli Scrambled Eggs (it's a meal, not just eggs)On Sunday, be prepared for at least a short wait.  It's a fairly small place, hence the name.  There's bar counter seating in addition to tables, making it fairly tight quarters to navigate. But hey, you're going for a meal, you're not moving in. GO. You will be glad you did!",,,
187,Brian W.,"Pompano Beach, FL",8,11,6,5.0,8/6/2017,"Hole in the Wall had a short wait for brunch, but my wife and I were able to order a Bacon Bloody Mary and Whisky Cold Brew while we waited. Both were amazing. The bacon is candied and was delicious. We both ordered the Brioche French Toast which had bacon, mascarpone, berries, crumb and maple syrup which was outstanding. The mascarpone was very creamy and buttery, and was the perfect touch. There are two communal tables, a bar and a bunch of private tables. We sat at a communal table and had a fun time meeting and joking around with the others at the table. Lastly the ambiance was really bright, open and welcoming. Highly recommend trying this place out. Cheers!",2,,
188,Katherine C.,"Black Mountain, NC",1,47,25,5.0,2/20/2018,"At first I wasn't sure about this place. The decor is simple and the menu leaning toward brunch. But as we ordered food and started talking to the friendly Aussies working there, we began to REALLY enjoy ourselves. I had the zucchini fritters with smoked salmon. My husband had the truffle bacon burger. The food was delicious and made with really good ingredients. The highlight was talking to the Australians who frequent Hole in the Wall. This place is much like the café culture in Australia. Excellent coffee is served along with good food and adult beverages-all with a happy atmosphere. When I'm downtown, I'm coming back over and over again! So worth it!",1,,
189,Jordan S.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,10,9,4.0,2/22/2018,Food was good. Coffee presentation was very nice and tasted good. Service was awesome. A bit of pricey but food is pretty generous and you can share.,1,,

They do not take reservations but the wait isn't long and certainly worth it! We have been going there for two days straight. Ordered wild mushroom toast-excellent , avocado toast-isn't bad, pulled pork eggs Benedict-very good, and of course their special hanging jerky-should try!",,,
192,Hanna S.,"Barrington, IL",5,21,175,2.0,3/18/2018,"After being quoted a 45 minute wait, we called at 45 minutes later asking where we were on the list. We were told no more than 20 more minutes. 15 minutes later, we walked back into the restaurant and in person asked how much longer and we were told most likely another 30 minutes. I cannot knock how polite the people are. We were offered complimentary drinks for while we were waiting. However it's so cramped in there, there was nowhere to even drink the drinks if we wanted them. We ended up leaving. I'm in NYC for 48 hours and I wasted almost two of them walking to/waiting for this restaurant. Shame though, the food looked great. It's imperative they either expand, work on wait control, or actually accurately quote waits. Very unhappy.",,,
193,Amanda G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,37,20,4.0,2/6/2018,Best breakfast spot in Fidi. Huge fan of the açaí bowl. Only downside is that the line is always SO long.,1,,
194,Carol C.,"FLUSHING, NY",52,29,3,4.0,4/2/2018,"The food here is tasty and the portions are large. It can get quite busy, so service is slightly below what I would expect. I have come back for the avocado toast with mushrooms (not the actual name of the dish, I think). It comes with two large slices of bread, avocado, arugula, egg, and red peppers. Would recommend for an unrushed brunch.",,,
195,Vanessa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",558,45,26,1.0,6/20/2017,"Looking for a great place to brunch? Well keep looking further cause this is definitely not the place. I really tried liking this place upon arrival, sadly the only thing that caught my attention was the cute decor. Upon arrival my husband and I only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table and at that point it started to sprinkle. Which okay that's normal here but I expected them to offer us a table indoors just in case it started to rain. Eager to get some food in our system before the long day ahead we just kind of shrugged it off and tried to ignore the minor sprinkle as we ordered. Our server came to take our drink order and my husband ordered a macchiato while I tried to order a mimosa. The server proceeds to tell me they ran out of orange juice not even bothering to add an apology. Obviously I was a little peeved at that fact, like ok you ran out of OJ? Just go buy some more at the store around the corner, running out of something that important when you're still a new location just doesn't sit well. She then offered a margarita instead which I had trouble locating on the menu but I was like sure whatever.When she comes back out with our drinks at that point the weather had started to pick up and you'd think it would be common knowledge to offer bar seating or other indoor alternatives but nope. She takes our order, Brioche French Toast for both of us, and walks back inside. At this point my husband and I were really annoyed because one, the macchiato my husband ordered came in the smallest cup you've ever laid your eyes on and two, rain water was seeping into our drinks. I hurriedly tried to take a drink of my margarita to preserve the taste but I guess the rain was trying to do me some justice because that margarita was the worst. I even had my husband take a sip because I thought I was imagining this brunch getting worse by the second but no he agreed it was a no go for him. Finally our food arrives and the servers try and act as if they can't see all the outdoor guests getting damp, never mind the fact that service is a lot better indoors since they rarely check up on you outside. As soon as they set our food down I mentally checked myself out of this horrible brunch. I guess when you order the Brioche French Toast they literally mean ONE slice of toast. It's not even the thick filling kind, it's one small slice of bread with flowers/plants sprinkled around! Which hey if you're here for the gram you won't be disappointed by the presentation of the food. They also only give you ONE slice of bacon. Let me tell you that French toast was demolished in 2 seconds and we were eager to leave and find more fulfilling food. Once the check arrives we cringed at the price, somehow our total of around $60 wasn't feeling justified. We were fully aware of the pricing of this place and normally wouldn't be bringing it up since my husband and I dine out A LOT. We've definitely paid our share of expensive dining but this was very hurtful to pay since the service sucked, we were soaked, the drinks wore horribly disgusting and the food was only okay. Nevertheless my husband took care of the bill and even left gratuity which was completely undeserved in my opinion. When the server picks up the check, and I'm assuming notices the gratuity, is when she bothers to notice my untouched margarita and offers us seating inside while I finish up my drink. NO THANKS MISSES, I couldn't leave fast enough.$60 for some mediocre drinks and two thin slices of semi-flavorful bread, nope.",10,3,1
196,Ada Y.,"New York, NY",78,6,4,2.0,4/14/2018,"great quality food but service was meh... too many staff but lack attentiveness. We wanted to split the bill between two cards, but the server came back demanding that we tell her how much we'd like to tip .......awkward......I asked if we could do it after. she said no. Bills came back she charged me more than my friend. I still gave her 20% tips anyway, but disappointed with the experience. I live half a block away and will likely go to another place next time.",,,
197,Bianca C.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,100,37,4.0,1/7/2018,Good food and good service. Definitely make sure you get something with bacon here because it is delicious. I especially loved the hanging bacon with all the sauces. Yum! The avocado toast was really good too.,1,,1
