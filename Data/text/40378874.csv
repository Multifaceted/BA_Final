0,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",180,220,726,5.0,11/10/2018,We came to Terra Blues very late on a Saturday night- around 2 am and there was no cover charge. The place was empty but the Jazz band was still going strong. We stuck around for a drink and loved every bit of our time here. Soft mellow and low key- unlike what the scene was over here few hours before. A great place to end our night.,1,,
1,Ian D.,"Manhattan, NY",26,2,0,1.0,7/2/2018,"Terra Blues is not handicap friendly.  I wanted to attend with a guest with a handicap who couldn't stand during the performance and required a seat.  Terra Blues could not offer me a seat reservation after 7PM.  Without a reservation I couldn't risk having my guest show up at Terra Blues and not have a seat available.  The unfriendly staff at Terra Blues, however, was unsympathetic.  As a result, we chose to attend another more handicap-friendly jazz establishment, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.Replying to Ilan:Terra Blues is certainly not a handicap friendly establishment and you should be ashamed of your response.  It is not handicap friendly if after 7:30pm you accept walk-ins but don't provide chairs to handicapped walk-in customers. If you allow walk-in customers then you should be providing the necessary services to handicapped walk-in customers. Despicable!!!",,1,
2,Via G.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,156,8,5.0,11/4/2018,"Yes! Amen sistah!This place has the best bands and live music especially jazz & blues. The drinks are double pours so take it slow because the bartenders hook you up royally. There is a tremendous selection of whiskey/bourbon/rye. Live music here touches your core!! It is a must in NYC. If you want a table, get reservations. Otherwise you can hang at the bar with the cool bartenders and enjoy the music just the same.",2,,
3,Holly N.,"Chicago, IL",276,114,95,4.0,3/17/2018,I love this place.  We visited from Chicago.  The music was amazing. The setting is very intimate.  The place was packed.  Drinks were pricey and or server was a bit rude but overall I would definitely come back.,,,1

I will definitely be back.. Let me not forget to mention how attentive the waitress was..just an update, the performance was by Saron Crenshaw, the band is absolutely amazing",,,
7,Veronica B.,"Long Island City, NY",12,86,35,4.0,4/9/2018,"Great music, great ambiance, great service! A classy place to listen to live music. Usually places like this lack service.

9,Dasle K.,"New York, NY",668,275,1667,3.0,12/22/2016,"Really chill place for live music and fun. I came here around 9pm on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too packed. $10 cover, which I thought was reasonable. They have an extensive alcohol menu (whiskey, wine, some beers, etc.) but no food! They sell peanuts/almonds though, which we were not interested in... the prices were just OK, and actually quite pricey for this area (e.g. $8 beers, $9-15 wines by the glass.)I didn't really like the first solo performer too much, but the band who performed second was pretty good! The only issue I had with this place was... between the first performer and the band that came up, there was about a 45 minute delay... I think they were setting up?! This was pretty frustrating because we weren't planning to stay all night. Overall, great value for a jazz bar but the performances are hit or miss. Not sure how busy it gets on weekends, but I would recommend coming here closer to 10-1030pm on weeknights. 3.5 stars.",2,,
10,Scot W.,"Bloomington, IN",12,135,13,5.0,7/5/2018,"Great atmosphere, excellent music, and fast, friendly service.  I really enjoyed Irving Louis Lattin's set; a good mix of old school music (Tell ol' Bill, for example) and songs not typically in the blues canon (such as Elton John's Daniel) along with a few of his own songs. Seems like they generally do an acoustic performance early in the evening and then close the place down with a livelier electric performance. The waitstaff was friendly, refilled water frequently, and checked in for drink orders at good intervals. The room was excellent for the type of music being performs: dark, with only candles for lighting plus a dimly lit stage. Definitely worth a visit.",,,
11,Ruth C.,"McAllen, TX",244,496,459,5.0,1/25/2018,"It's a cozy place with a bar, few tables, and live band. It's a super classy feel, and the drinks were pretty tasty.",,1,1
12,Uri D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,1,5.0,10/31/2017,"This is probably the most amazing blues place in NYC, with a full bar of wonderful drink to get you going into the spirit of blues. The musician are top of the line performers, and the sets are long enough for a long evening. Perfect atmosphere, quick service, clean. Don't miss it, a once in a lifetime experience.",2,,

16,Yezhuo L.,"Manhattan, NY",46,3,0,1.0,5/14/2018,"Music is good, manager is terrible. He said no video and no flash. So I took a picture with no flash, then he came made a fuss about it. And based on how many pictures are posted here, there's no question he's just being ridiculous.",,,
17,Michael B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",83,92,0,3.0,9/9/2017,The music is good but the cover was too high and the drinks aren't cheap enough for what it is IMO. The bands seem to cater a bit to the Dad-Rock crowd so hipsters need not apply but it's fun for the average Joe and makes for a decent night out.,1,,
18,Linda M.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,180,484,5.0,4/11/2016,"Loved, loved, loved this experience.Covee charge was well worth it. I climbed the stairs to discover this gem. While waiting for the band to start they played music by Freddie  King and other greats!  I got a table right away and was quickly taken care of by the waitress.The band was incredible!  Saron Crenshaw was great ans created a fun and interactive experience for the audience.  What a wonderful evening!",2,,
19,Faith D.,"San Francisco, CA",7,20,6,4.0,4/30/2018,"What a great place to be! We caught the early show. It was a great night with a talented musician and great atmosphere. Just a note for tourists such as ourselves, this place doesn't serve meals. We'd definitely come back.",,,
20,Joe R.,"Miller Place, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/22/2018,"Best blues in the city. Like going back in timeOnly draw back. They need to police the room. Bridge and tunnel people too loud, have no respect for the musicians",,,
21,AA K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,4/30/2018,"Terrific music, great ambiance, impressive whiskey/rye/bourbon selection, and great service. True blues and jazz clubs are unfortunately a dying breed In nyc, thank god for terra blues and their terrific line up of talented artists. The talented Ray Schinnery is on of my favorites, and definitely worth seeing!",,,
22,Michael M.,"Orlando, FL",5,75,0,5.0,11/27/2017,A very nice intimate place to listen to some good blues music. We saw Saron Crenshaw last night and he is something special.. Boy can he play the guitar! The drink prices are reasonable and the staff very friendly! This place we always stop by when in New York City( Greenwich Village). We'll be back again for some more blues fo show..,2,,
23,Nicole I.,"New York, NY",1,49,0,4.0,2/3/2018,"Heard two shows hear; both were good old-fashioned blues.  Seems like a solid bar with a well-behaved crowd, appropriately decorated with dark wood and deep red accents.  I wish the crowd would dance a bit, and that they had better beer on draft.  But I guess you come here to listen to the music, so...",,,
24,Mike S.,"New York, NY",0,17,2,1.0,4/14/2018,If you're a middle aged dad who listens to classic rock I guess you'll have a good time.  Not for anyone under 40- mediocre blues act on a Friday night at 10pm not worth the $20 cover,1,1,1
25,Brielle B.,"Manhattan, NY",590,134,26,5.0,5/5/2017,"Other reviewers have it right, so I sound like an echo: lively music (always a packed house), extensive whiskey list, great experience. Prices are steep, but hey - it's NYC. This will quickly become one of your go-to spots.",,,
26,Debarghya D.,"New York, NY",20,32,112,5.0,4/18/2016,"Expect the average age to be bald with small remnants of white hair. If you're going in a weekend night, expect a crowd. No matter when you go, expect dapper music. You won't get much better for a $15 cover. Don't expect food, only liquor.We weren't able to get reservations on a Saturday night - they only take reservations until 8pm, so we showed up at 830 for the 9pm show. Surprisingly, despite the nose in hair crowd, the waitress was very generous and sat us down in the first 5 minutes a few tables from the front. If you think you don't like blues, youre probably either wrong or desperately need to ramp up your music taste. To be fair, I never thought my 20 something self to be a blues fan. But the atmosphere is absolutely electric, people clap to the music, and your hair will stand on their ends. 10 on 10 would go again",4,,1
27,glen n.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,44,0,5.0,11/1/2017,"We saw Saron Crenshaw put on a very good blues performance at Terras in October 2017. The club is very small and crowded- get there 20 minutes early. The night we were there the cover was $20pp cash only. The service was good, the acoustics and sound system was good, and the club had a nice feel to it.Surprisingly, the liquor was very well priced- we had two different call cocktails and they were $10 each. That is amazing for any club anywhere and unheard if in NYC. We were at the 10pm show and were encouraged to stay for the last set. The place really emptied out at 11:30- it was a great night!!",,,
28,Ezgi C.,"Miami Beach, FL",21,29,47,5.0,3/25/2017,"I had an amazing night at this place. I will definitely go again. The service was great. I listened to two bands that night. Their stage was very very good, played very well, songs were great. Entrance fee is $15 and they have a large bourbon selection. Their price is reasonable.",,,
29,Dan H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",420,863,175,5.0,10/12/2015,"I thought I was finished with my NYC reviews, but we had such a great time here on a Friday night this past August I felt I needed to give them a shout out.Everyone from the manager, and especially our waitress were consummate pros. The space itself is very nicely appointed and the sound system was excellent. We just had drinks during the show, and they were all delivered quickly and with a smile.The Michael Powers Frequency Band was the act that night and these guys were incredible. They play there periodically, so if you see them on the calendar don't miss their terrific performance. This a very cool area of Greenwich Village with a ton of bars/clubs and restaurants within a few blocks, and practically all of them were packed with happy shiny people dressed up for a night out in the big city. That's it for my NYC reviews, promise.",12,10,10
30,Taryn C.,"New York, NY",274,729,37,3.0,10/23/2016,"Nice place to catch some blues. Little pricey if you don't plan on staying all night.  So just stay a long time.  I believe if you don't sit at the bar, there is a drink minimum.  Don't quote me on that though.",2,,
31,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,5.0,9/13/2015,"Terrific place to hear some great blues or jazz. Terra Blues is an intimate, cozy place that, unlike some other music clubs in the city, isn't too cozy.  Service was very good, the drinks were made well, and the music we heard (Holy Crow Jazz Band) was outstanding. (The band was as good as anything we've heard on our visits to Frenchmen Street in New Orleans, and that's saying something!) The crowd was courteous and appreciative.One tip: You can make reservations for a table up until 8 or 9 pm (depending on the night) through email, which can assure you a better seat. The place is narrow, so if you'd rather be up front rather than in back and you don't mind arriving a little early, the info for making reservations is here: terrablues.com/about/res…",3,,1

If it weren't for his friendliness and the hilarious measures he took to convince us, I would not have set foot in Terra Blues. I'm glad I did. The atmosphere was nice, and it was overall a pleasant experience. I pass by this place all the time, and never go in, but I'm glad I did. Thanks a lot, Zach! You're the best.",,,

37,Eduardo E.,"New York, NY",18,29,21,4.0,5/5/2017,"Last night I heard amazing blue songs in this cute little dimly lit bar with a stage.  The cover was only 10 bucks and the drink prices were standard nyc, some drinks even as cheap as 6 dollars.  We take for the acoustic show and it was definitely worth it.  Our first server was great, attentive, quick and definitely in the zone..  The second one that took over after she left wasn't as great.  A bit aloof, confused and maybe even a bit say? It took away from the show a bit to be honest, but everyone has bad days for sure.  They have nightly shows at 7pm/ 9pm/ and a band at 10pm.  It's worth checking out if you love blues music or music in general.",,,

40,Camille G.,"Paris, France",3,104,323,5.0,12/11/2015,"Terra Blues for your music fix!If you cannot live without music, this is your home.For a very reasonable cover charge, you will forget everything around you and be transported by the perfect sound and voice.I have been there at least two or three times. Service ok. Place a little narrow but it works. Drinks ok, a bit on the expensive side, but if that's the price I have to pay to keep listening...You can totally come on your own, but I would choose to come early for a good spot, the room is not really big. Also, not good for talking - you will be reprimanded... you are not supposed to speak during the performance. Just sit back, relax and enjoy. So choose carefully the type of people you are bringing with you to the Terra blues.Waiters a little bit pushy for you to reorder drinks, and also for you to contribute to the tip jar for the artists every three or four songs. Nevertheless, the quality of the live music makes it a must-go and must-return in New York. Even if you are just in the city for the weekend, do not miss out on this. I promise to you, you will come back.",5,2,
41,Heather R.,"Bedford-Stuyvesant, NY",148,246,62,4.0,1/30/2016,I went last night and the music here was really great. I could have just sat and listened on my own comfortably if I had been alone.

We lucked out on timing as one couple was getting up...score! Table seating looks to crammed so it's a good choice to sit at the bar.  $10 cover charge is nice if it goes to the musician. Drink prices are a bit steep. Make sure if you sit at the bar and leave your change on it (and it's not the tip), take it off the bar...they will take it (i.e. - drink was $8, gave $20...change was $12...was listening to music...didn't put my drink down...a minute later went to grab my drink and the change was gone...)...no biggie.Music was entertaining. The blues guy engaged the audience. It's in the village so the area is crowded and full of 20 somethings...the bar was a bit of an older crowd.",8,,6

48,Lex J.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,5,3,5.0,9/7/2015,"We went on a Monday night and the music was a true blues feel.  If you're in to whiskey, this is your place!!  They allow you to bring your own food (outside food; no outside beverage).  The ambiance is perfect, with small candles all over and red lights around the perimeter to set the mood. $10 cover and you can come and go as many times as you please.",2,,1
49,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1372,384,370,3.0,2/16/2014,"Terra Blues is a Greenwich Village blues bar on Bleeker that actually has decent live blues musicians. We came on a random weekday night, paid the small cover charge, then listened to a few acts. Each act was superb, even the opening ones. I am no blues expert, but I am a musician so I feel qualified to judge here. These blues acts were far better than most of the bars I have been to around town.Inside the Ambiance is kind of divey, but in a good way. There are no neon lights or anything like that, but it is dim and dark, loud and has a weird layout. The main focus here is the stage though, so it is understandable. Small candle adorn each table and provide the only light in the stage area besides the dim stage lights.Drinks were average priced, though poorly made. The tout a ton a whisky and bourbon drinks and claim to be a whisky bar, but my old fashioned was muddled with cherries, had crushed ice, and was not mixed very well. I wouldn't come here just to drink, but I will come back for some blues and a few rounds when in the area.",6,5,4
50,Lina H.,"Oslo, Norway",1,10,7,4.0,11/10/2014,"Intimate, good ambiance, loved the atmosphere. Had reservations and got a table by the stage. Listened to Mack Jr and Solomon Hicks.

51,Alicia R.,"Northvale, NJ",12,29,7,5.0,7/25/2015,"On a Friday night, this is where you need to be. The band, The Michael Powers Frequency Band, was sweet ear candy goodness. The good sounding blues will mesmerize you. The venue is comfortable, more than cozy and definitely not cramped. The Wildberry Martini was not overpriced and tasted good. The band connected to the crowd and vice versa. There was an all around good vibe with great music, good drinks, and people that mirrored every aspect of NYC. Cheers to Terra Blues! I will be back soon.",2,,2

54,Dennis K.,"Dallas, OR",4,39,0,5.0,6/3/2015,"You know those dark and intimate blues clubs you typically see in the movies? This is one of those. The liquor flows like water and the music is authentic, mesmerizing, heartfelt stuff that transports you to another place in time when archtop guitars and tube amps ruled. The bar is upstairs from the street, so it's easy to miss if you're walking by real quick. We paid cover of $10 ea. to get in, but well worth it. And, as with most places in Manhattan, the service really shined.   *A special ""thank you"" to TC and Toni (whom we met on Letterman) for the tip - thanks for helping out a couple of tourists from Oregon.",4,,
55,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",44,182,85,5.0,7/23/2013,"Awesome place for live music! I love coming here Mondays. There's the Terra Blues Band that plays weekly. A group of my friends come here sometimes to do blues dancing (a partnered dance style). ou can comfortably fit 2-4 couples to dance in the bar part by the entrance, while the band plays their 5-10 minute songs. The staff is pretty nice, and I have a large amount of respect for people willing to move gracefully around us dancers and still be friendly to us. They are also really quick on service.I'm not positive about this, but I believe the band records every time they play- to keep track of what works and what doesn't- so they are constantly paying attention to how their music Really affects the audience.",8,3,3

The server we had was very friendly even if she was not yet familiar with the whiskeys. But she did provide a guide that described each one.The space is nice, one of the few not in a basement, but the $15 cover seemed a little steep for an early show with a blues harmonica player.

The cover was reasonable ($15) and we were seated at a table. There was no pressure to buy drinks (I had a cocktail but my friend just drank water) and the waitress was really attentive. The second time I went was a totally different story. Came to an earlier show to see Bobby Radcliff. The cover was again $15 (surprising as it was 7pm) but we paid and went in. We both had a beer and were just listening to the music. It was really early so maybe only 3/4 of the tables were full. The music wasn't as loud or as good as the last time I was there PLUS there was reverb from a band playing downstairs, but no one fixed it! This all I wouldn't have minded, except the waitress had the nerve to come over and point us to a notice on the menu in -2.5 font that said there was a minimum/ person for drinks! We had already paid $30 to get in and each ordered a drink! We hadn't even finished our original drinks yet! THE MUSIC WASN'T THAT GOOD and it was still only 7:30! She was generally horrible and ruined our experience. Needless to say we left without hitting our ""minimum"". It was 7:35pm. ) 0 Stars. Unfortunately I won't be back.",1,,

He deserved a table which I definitely suggest as it can get very crowded at the bar. The drinks were tasty, though a bit pricey but I've come to expect that at most music venues. The music was awesome and definitely the star of the evening. It's not background music, it's a show. Only negative, they really cram people in so you get to know your neighbors.",1,,
59,Mary F.,"Bentonville, AR",1,5,0,2.0,5/10/2015,Are you kidding me? First time to terra blues and it doesn't live up to the legend. The show started 1 hour late and with a completely different performer. We came to see Clarence Spady but Andy Story came on stage. He is ok but not who we came to see. Topping it off is the worse service ever in a blues club. We have been to Many blues clubs across the country and this one doesn't measure up. 2 stars only because we have a soft spot for musicians trying to earn a living in pitiful places.

60,Margo I.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,56,14,5.0,7/4/2016,2 words - SaRon Crenshaw!!!! I love terra blues. It is a very authentic blues bar in the heart of the bustling Greenwich village. I go on Monday nights for the blues of SaRon and his band. It's always a good time. You have to buy tickets at the door but it isn't expensive at all.,,2,
61,Sean B.,"Oakland, CA",118,1051,57,4.0,12/4/2012,"The good:1. Every night they have 2 acts. The first is generally a one-person acoustic set, the 2nd is a band. Good balance. 2. $10 cover is reasonable considering the music is good and goes from 7:30 to 3:30 AM. 3. You can bring food into the place (I wish I would have known this prior to my visit). Even though it is under the ""Restaurant"" category here on Yelp, Terra Blues does NOT serve food. 4. It is very clean. Probably the closest a music venue can get to being spotless.5. Quick service.6. Friendly patrons. Everyone sitting by us introduced themselves and were extremely polite. It was a bit surreal. I've had similar experiences in New Orleans, but nowhere else. The not-so-good:1. The chairs are uncomfortable and the seats against the wall are quite short. That was our only frustration with the place.2. The draft beer selection is very, very average. The beer options in general aren't so great. The only one that sounded good was Harpoon IPA. The rest? Dull city baby! The beer prices in general are expensive too (Bud Light for $6- uh hell no.  Corona for $7? Yeah right, especially when the aforementioned Harpoon is the same price).In short, Terra Blues is a nice spot to listen to some live blues music while having a pricey cocktail or macrobrew.",8,1,
62,Claire B.,"Manhattan, NY",34,103,18,5.0,5/20/2016,Wandered into Terra Blues with a friend on a quiet Friday night around 2am; we had no expectations and were quite pleased with our late night discovery.

She was surprising me,with her favorite place.......hiding behind mischievous grins...I heard the wail of a blues guitar and shivered, she held me tighter because she thought I was cold.She introduced me, to her friend there, we shook hands, and she took me,In.To the cacophony.The bar had cups of fire, and I tried to explain, with a dried, crack tongue,that somehow, what we heard now, was how I felt whenever I thought of her name.My words weren't so smooth then, but it's ok she mouthed...I...you too.I smiled and looked away...as the blues continued to play...Xmas 2007 NYC",2,,4
65,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1704,228,5.0,7/19/2012,"Terra Blues is such a special place that it's both wonderful and a shame how empty it can be on weekday nights. Every night, there are world-class virtuoso musicians pouring out their heart and soul on the small stage, amazing guitarists, keyboardists and drummers. But, since the blues are an acquired taste for many, this little gem stays blissfully accessible and protected by the indifference of twentysomething ragers downstairs at Wicked Willie's and Peculier Pub.They have a nice drink menu and you can always grab a Scheider Weisse or Aventinus, close your eyes, and enjoy the show. The house band is awesome!",6,1,3
66,Gregory B.,"New York, NY",30,57,7,2.0,9/30/2014,"Terra BluesI'm giving this place a solid 'meh'.$10 cover? To keep the college kids out I guess? How many college kids are going to come to an authentic blues bar with expensive drinks anyway? It doesn't help keep the hipsters away.I was with my party in the rear most bar seat and we still got shushed by the management to keep our voices down. I understand that and like respecting the music but if the one tourist family sitting behind us was that interested in the musical experience they probably would have sat in one of the 30 empty seats in the front of the house.What really left a negative impression for me was charging me $3 for a club soda. My party paid $40 in cover, plus you're slinging vodka/sodas for $8 out of a bottle that you paid $30 wholesale for. Give the one guy not drinking (or the DD) a break.I would go back if I am looking for a 'can't decide what I want' blues experience. If I want to sit at a table and order drinks while I watch a show I'll go to BB King's. If I want to not have anyone talk and watch traditional Jazz I'll go to Smalls.

68,Steronimo G.,"Sacramento, CA",0,29,2,5.0,4/9/2016,"This tiny venue is a gem for the music lover. Saw Jr. Mack play acoustic blues. For a $15 cover, I got a seat within 20 feet of a Grammy nominated blues musician. Performance and sound quality were fantastic. The drinks menu is pretty good too. That said, it is a little tacky that there's a cover charge, and a two drink minimum per set, and a waitress walking around after every set with a big tip bucket. If you're prepared for this and enjoy great music, you'll have a great time. If not, you might be disappointed. The music was good enough to warrant five stars.",,,

76,Kat D.,"Cranford, NJ",0,13,0,5.0,12/13/2013,"Terra Blues is one of the first places I popped into when I moved to the NYC area almost 7 years ago. I went there alone on a packed Saturday night, no seating available, and a tight standing area around the bar. There was a very good reason for the limited space that night....Saron Crenshaw!Good lawd. If you have any appreciation for live music, blues music, guitar talent, or exceptional keys/drums/bass, you will love this guy and his band. From the minute they set foot on stage (usually around 11pm) it is pure entertainment. Saron is truly remarkable as a musician. His charisma, talent, and energy is incredibly magnetic and EVERYONE in the venue will be gettin' into the performance. He often comes into the audience and engages them too, playing with his teeth, etc. It's glorious.Even though my first experience was from the crowded back section of the venue, I danced around and had a wonderful experience. I have seen him play many times since then (making sure to get there early for a seat up front), and it is impossible to not enjoy yourself during a show there.This may seem like more of a review for Saron, and it kind of is, however I've seen several other blues artists at Terra Blues and they are also amazing. The manager of the club will even come out and play trumpet with the acts, it's just a fun time overall.Drinks are normal NYC prices, and space is also tight but it's not a big deal. Yes they pack people in, but it's not like you're stuck in your seat. If you need to get up and move you are able to do so, and it actually adds to the fun to be seated with other people who are also having a great time. Make some friends!You really can't go wrong if you go here at any time, even the acoustic earlier hours are great, but my favorite time is for full band performances at the later time slot (and if Saron is playing, that's my ultimate favorite).",3,,1

79,Bora G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,42,22,4.0,12/8/2013,"Cool place for live music. Paid a $10 cover to watch some blues from 7-11pm. Great drink selection with standard manhattan pricing. Clear they are going for a very intimate ambiance with narrow tables and shallow candles providing most of the table-lighting. Decor is pretty authentic with music related art covering the wood walls of the place. The crowd was in the 30-40 age range. Our party of 6 was comfortable and the wait-staff was very attentive, perhaps too much so - in appearing disappointed when we did not want to immediately re-order drinks after seeing whiskey and beer glass almost empty. It didn't vibe well with the very laid-back feel of the place when the waitress interrupted conversation and enjoyment every 5 min. That one complaint was a consensus within the group.",2,,

81,Stephanie M.,"New York, NY",74,618,4,1.0,5/27/2011,"I hate to give such a bad review because the venue was nice enough, but the way my family and I were treated by the server was inexcusable. My dad and his gf came to town to visit wanting to see a blues show and handpicked this venue. After 5 of us paying a $10 cover at 6pm, we ordered a round. My dads gf, unfamiliar with nyc, paid cash. As soon as the server left said she thought she didn't tip enough. I said no big deal, we'll tip double on the next round.  Our server though found it okay and necessary to say to MY gf that she was not tipped enough and to lecture her on standard tipping policies. A) we are well aware and my gf is a hospitality professional- so super aware B) I think its standard to at least wait until the next round as I was aware and ready to take care of her. Not to mention my gf said to her on the way in that they were visiting from out of town!Needless to say, it ruined our entire experience and evening . It was embarrassing and extremely unprofessional. Could have been a regular spot to take visitors but now knowing that servers are rude I won't be back.",6,2,
82,David S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,0,2.0,3/28/2015,"The only reason Terra Blues gets 2 stars here is because of the 5-star music and terrific waitress what was helping us tonight. Too bad this experience was ruined by one out of control patron and the complacent management/security team. He disturbed the show consistently for the 1.5 hours that we were there, ""brushed the shoulders off"" of one of the lead musicians (who was visibly uncomfortable), led multiple parties to leave their tables from the best part of the venue, and climaxed his drunken rampage with inflammatory and homophobic remarks directed to my fiancé and me. All of this went down in the the most visible table in the house and not once did we see anyone from the venue come by and attempt to control the situation. Upon complaining, all we got was a complementary entry promise for future visits...yeah right.",2,,
83,Vanessa B.,"Austin, TX",198,190,32,4.0,1/31/2015,"Terra Blues is exactly what I was looking for on my trip to Manhattan. Dark, intimate, sexy, with fantastic musicians and a laid-back vibe. We went on a friday night, and somehow managed to snag the best table in the house; right in the middle but towards the back, so we weren't hemmed in. This place is tiny, and the tables are close together, but that seems to be the way it goes in the city. Our server was delightful and attentive, but hoowhee those drinks weren't cheap! I think $12 a pop, which fir backwoods hicks from Austin like us was a shocker. But as I told my date, top-notch talent, a beautiful setting and all in the heart of the most vibrant city in America don't come cheap. I wouldn't come here as a regular drinking spot, but it's a must-do for out of towners.",3,1,1
84,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,4.0,12/13/2012,"It would seem odd to withhold a star for one reason only, but it cannot be overemphasized that the seating here is so uncomfortable that it seems to have been designed by some lunatic specializing in sedentary torture. The seats are so short that, even if you're not large assed (which sadly I am not), you feel like you're perched and pitching forward on a tiny bench, only you can't find your balance point because of the rigid wooden back behind you. This goes both for the hard, lopsided chairs and padded benches lining the rigid walls.Other than that, Terra Blues is a treasure. As you walk up the stairs, a guy with an Australian accent lures you as if you need convincing to go on in. $10 to the doorman admits you into a space that smells like clean, freshly waxed, mahogany. ""This place is awesome!"" I shouted prematurely to my friend walking in behind me. I realize I did this simply based on the smell of cleanliness, authenticity, history, and quiet class in the air.We were early, so were able to sample several chairs until we gave up looking for comfort but settled for the best view. When the 7 p.m. show began, a godlike voice over the PA system (turned out to be the owner/manager talking into a mouthpiece from behind the old wooded bar) warned everyone to be quiet during acoustic sets out of respect to artists. I liked it here already. I also liked that there was no food service to distract from the music, but only likeable cocktail waitresses bringing forth too-expensive drinks, forcing me to go for a neat Corsair Triple Smoke from Tennessee because if I'm going to spend 12 bones from my broken bank, it's going to be on an artesanal Southern whiskey and not 1.5 Coronas, for Christ's sake. Irving Louis Lattin took the stage. He was obviously a man of great acumen, but seemed a little distant. Meanwhile, a table of assholes who had chosen to sit front-and-center were talking loudly through the whole thing. One woman was particularly vocal, discussing someone's divorce. To my joy, a staff member walked over and gently told them to shut the fuck up. To my dismay, they continued talking. As Lattin warmed up, though, I started to tune out to jerks. The bar was smartly set up far in the back, where people boozed up and where a lady looking like Dolly Parton in Stevie Nicks clothing slowly gyrated to everything. The performer warmed me over with a non-tacky, soulful version of Joe Cocker's ""With a Little Help From My Friends."" (Yes, I know it was written by Lennon McCartney, but let's face the fact that Cocker brought it to life).At 10 p.m., Lattin took the stage again, and this time, the front-and-center people were a dude in a fedora who was deliberately all about the music, and his stupid bitch girlfriend, who took flash photo right in the musician's face, prompting the otherwise sedate man to snap, ""Please try not to BLIND the performers."" She ignored him, Instagramming her shot o her iPhone, and later did the same thing again. The couple had a pizza with them (so this place is bring your own food), and made a bit of a to-do about how to balance the cardboard object on the tiny round wooden table. Lattin was on a roll, now, getting into serious blues but peppering in unexpected faves like ""How Sweet It Is to Be Loved By You"" (which apparently was written by Marvin Gaye!) and the surprise ""If You Could Read My Mind"" by Gordon Lightfoot, to which I held up my table candle.At some point, a loving but not annoying couple actually asked if they could sit down in front of me. I was shocked that they'd asked, rather than taking pleasure in obstructing my vision without asking. They took a seat, and weren't in my way at all, but INSISTED on buying me a drink, too! The last time I received such an act of kindness was when some guy paid my toll back in 2005, and it wasn't in New York City. Tears rose to my eyes at their consideration, but I blinked through them and past their nuzzling silhouettes towards the stage.Sometime later, the Jr. Mack Band came in with their hopped up guitar licks and rumbling bass and fiesty drums. Suddenly, the whole place was crowded like a juke joint in the delta (just kidding, I don't know what that's like, but the house was packed with people who didn't seem like city types - and I mean that in a good way). People were laughing and talking and drinking and stomping and so on. As for my friend and me, it was time to make our exit and find sustenance. I preferred the earlier end of the evening, when you could sit in a clean, ornate, warmly lit space without the noise of (too many) goddamn people cutting the air between you and some heartfelt man-and-guitar - a real escape, enhancing the inner freedom live music provides.Next time, drink first, show up early again with a bowl of hot gumbo, mentally prepare to transcend the agony of the seating, then take that  front and cente table so as not to have to watch the potential foolishness of the odd jerkoff in the audience.",12,11,6

We walked in pretty late -- 11ish and it was packed.  So I would make a reservation or come early to make sure you get a seat.  But even standing was fine - but I was sure amazed of the servers ability to make their way thru the crowd with a tray full of drinks.

91,Kevin J.,"Philadelphia, PA",163,554,104,4.0,8/4/2010,What a fantastic venue to sit and relax and hear some great live blues music. The cover is reasonable and it is often waived before 8PM. Once you decide to walk in the Terra Blues is so worth the price of admission. If you still have never seen live blues music you should go try this venue especially on a Monday night or weekend. As far as NYC is concerned Terra Blues is the best spot for live blues music. I am never disappointed with this venue. Most of the Performers appear to have weekly residencies where they play multiple sets. In between sets they spin classic blues tracks over a speaker system. Some have been there a long time but there are some guest musicians and up-and-coming names as well.,4,,

Little did I know it was Saron Crenshaw who pretty much lives at Terra Blues. I visited the venue soon after and it was a great night. I arrived early to get a seat which, on the weekend, is necessary but they won't allow guests before the performance which seems strange. Regardless, the music was incredible.

Choose a seat on the side if you want to be able to talk (quietly!) with your friends. Choose a seat in the middle if you want to really get into the music. The bar is extensive but a bit expensive. If you're into beer though, they serve Chimay Blue. Can't really beat excellent blues while sipping on a Chimay Blue in a great atmosphere - that's my ideal Saturday night.

My one complaint would be that the door at the front is horribly placed and a waitress opened the door right into me and spilled her drink in it likely spilled on my shoes. $10 cover at the door was not unreasonable for the amount of live music that this place offered. Very intimate setting and I hope it continues to thrive. Another waitress kept messing up our drink orders because she was either new or incompetent. But we did not let it ruin the night.",,,
105,Julia D.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",445,302,16,5.0,9/14/2011,"With the preponderance of jazz venues in New York, it's almost easy to forget about the good ol' blues. But Terra Blues, in particular, is a spot that will have you coming back as often as possible year after year. The venue is so enchanting that it almost takes you back in time, and the only thing missing from the air is the smoke. The cover is always $10, and they have two shows per night with two different bands, one at 7 PM and one at 10PM. I've been here more than 10 times and I can honestly say I've never seen an act that I didn't like. And people I've brought here, who originally thought they didn't like the blues, come out of Terra Blues wanting to learn more about the genre. Terra Blues is so intimate that you really get to know your band (or your one-man-band, as was the case last night). They will tell you stories both musically and verbally in between songs, and you'll feel like you really get what they're playing to you, as you sip on your scotch or bourbon*. Additionally, if your sensory needs are STILL not met, the sexy and dimly lit ambience allows you to get to know your partner better as well, if you catch my drift. So take your date, take your friends from town, your friends from out of town, take your mom, your grandparents and your enemies (but not your kiddos); I truly think that almost everyone will enjoy a night at Terra Blues.----* The drinks here are pretty pricey, but you can sip on one drink for quite a while, and I definitely recommend trying the Oban Scotch ($14).",8,3,4

I understand that more people equals more money but once you get a few feet back the bar area isn't crowded, it's just the reserved seating that is sardine-like. Not exactly what I was expecting, even in NYC. Couple that with the front-row chatterboxes we had less than an arms length away and it become downright miserable.

120,julie s.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,121,0,3.0,6/1/2010,"I have to say, I kinda love this place in spite of its best efforts. I'm used to my blues bars being in basements. This one is actually not but they decorated it like it is--dimly lit, lots of texture and gargoyles and such on the walls and ceiling. It's really a great environment--dark, and great acoustics. And the beer/cider selection is pretty excellent--I was impressed by the quantity and the quality.you can get in for free under certain circumstances, but even if you don't, $5-10 for several hours' worth of good live music is totally worth it in my book. My big gripe is with basically everyone who works here. wtf, a blues bar full of old dudes with excellent taste in hats and the staff is entirely malnourished hipsters? It makes no sense. All the dudes have ironic scraggly moustaches and all the women are trying way too hard. But aside from the cognitive dissonance, this place just doesn't seem to get WHY people love small mildly-dive-like bars--people go to blues bars to get good music and chill out and that's about it, ya know? We want to be able to (a) hear the music (b) dance (c) easily get our booze and (d) kinda hear/see the person we're flirting with. The service is pretentious and horrible. If you get a table, don't bother with the table service--we tried, but then when I asked the waitress what beers they had on tap, she gave me a really dirty look, pointed to the menu, and walked away. And never came back. The couple sitting next to us said they'd ordered drinks and it had been literally a half hour and they hadn't gotten them. So go directly to the bar. But still expect it to take forever--it was only moderately crowded when I went here but it still took the bartender a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge I was there, let alone take our order. There were, like, 3 other staff members standing there ignoring me, too. The bartender was really sweet but it it just took SO LONG. I have been in crappy dive bars with twice as many people in them and gotten served in half that time. Also I hate the way the front is set up--it's all tables from the end of the bar all the way up to the front of the stage, which means the dancers are stuck basically in between the bar and the wall. The floor is shockingly nice for dancing, too, but we don't really have the space to have as much fun as I'd like. And because access to the front is blocked, the only way to tip the band is to wait for the cranky waitress to bring around a bucket. Oh yeah, they do that too--in addition to the cover and the drinks, someone will periodically come straight up to you with a bucket and ask you if you want to tip the band, and even if you just did, or you just said ""hey I've got no cash now but I will later,"" they'll come back to you like 5 minutes later. I think we were asked like 5 times. I'm sure I'll be back because I want to enjoy the music and ignore the staff, but man. They could do themselves a whole lotta favors by not trying so hard.",4,,

130,Iddqd I.,"Malden, MA",7,33,1,1.0,5/23/2011,"Nice music and atmosphere: tasteful decor and lighting. It was especially good at the beginning of our night there. But as the night progressed, we discovered more and more nuisances, and at the end we decided we would never want to go back there. First of all, the service there is odd, bordering on rude. The waitresses wanted to be paid up front for each round (which we found weird first of all - cannot they keep track of how much we drink and bill us at the end of the night? or open a tab? I know it may be difficult and confusing, but most places like that manage to do so?) Once we paid our waitress, she awkwardly waited for the tip. It made us feel very uncomfortable. I have never seen such behavior anywhere else. It happened several times. At one point, when my friend counted out few one dollar bills to give to the waitress, she continued to stand there until my friend gave her another dollar! It was very obvious and awkward. On top of this awkward bill-right-away-and-wait-for-tip dynamic, the waitresses were rather unfriendly (short answers to our questions, zero smile, etc). Another thing was the size of the place and the amount of the people they let inside. It became so crowded and loud at the end, just going to the bathroom was a painful and long process as you stepped on everybody and had to push several people to make a step. Finally, it was expensive. We were drinking wine, which was plain and nothing special, but really steeply priced. To that, add the high tips forced by the waitress (as in the situation I described above). Not to mention the cover charge, which was on the higher end. ON TOP OF THAT, the waitresses were going around with a big bucket, asking for the tips for the artists. We did give it first time she came around. She came around again later and we acted uninterested - we already spent so much money on the things I mentioned earlier and gave a nice bucket tip earlier. Instead of having a skill of reading peoples' body language - it was clear we did not intend to give a bucket tip this time around - she continued to stand around there awkwardly, sticking the bucket out until we had to literally tell her we were not going to do it this time since we did before and we felt it was enough. She gave us a funny look and walked away.These factors are enough for me not to ever want to go back there. It's not worth it to be squeezed in the small place with high levels of noise, and spend tons of money for an unfriendly service that makes you feel uncomfortable and awkward.",3,,

The place is cozy and by cozy I mean narrow as hell so I hope you like the people you are there with because you will be close to them. There always seems to be impromptu acts that show up on stage. It seems that folks get together during the day at Washington Square Park, find that they can groove together and work their way on to the stage at Terra. On one of last nights in New York (right before my move to the desert) A group of friends did what we did best... bum around the Village. We were going from the Belgium Beer Bar across the park to hit up some bars on Bleeker. Well on a Saturday night you cant walk through Washington Square park and not smoke a joint. So we do, and start listening to this guy blow a mean sax, I mean this guy could blow. We begin to pass around our herbal jazz cigarette and this guys says he is going to head over to Terra to see who is on stage and if he might be able to ""squeeze in a few notes"" We head over to Bleeker and find a table right up by the stage and immediately flood our table with beer. our new buddy from the park goes straight for the stage and nods to the guys up there and hops on. they begin a slow somewhat moving jam that I couldnt quite place my finger on. then this guy starts to blow and woah!

I would say half or more of the numbers I've heard here were Hendrix covers or slightly hot-rodded versions of the classics, but that's more than fine by me. The blues is about saying what everybody's already heard or everybody already knows themselves and showing them how strongly they feel about it. I will listen to most anything if the guy saying it knows his way around a stratocaster the way Michael Powers does.As I commented to the friend I stopped in with last night, the fact that it gets so crowded in there presents a real quandary for me. On the one hand, people SHOULD be flocking to hear such good music and it's nice to see that kind of success for the band.

There was an infectious passion that spread from person to person across the crowded club as the band danced through its set list, unlike almost anything I'd ever witnessed at a show.Update: the guy I saw there was Clarence Spady. I'd link to his MySpace page, but Yelp can't handle the weird characters in the URL so go Google him.",,,

The beer selection is also good, and the prices are average. It's a small place, so you may or may not get a seat, but I think shows are generally better when you're crammed into a tiny venue. There's a cover, but hey, it's the village and this is live music.",1,,1
154,Mariya A.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,2.0,1/24/2009,"Small, scruffy, way too crowded with a less-than- classy crowd.  I LOVE the BLUES, but was unable to hear it due to a semi-permanent damage to my ear drums in the first 5 minutes of the performance.Louder doesn't mean better!",,,
155,jen d.,"Abilene, TX",51,49,1,5.0,2/12/2013,Really good live music. Better place for a date vs. 1-3 friends. A large group of friends would be comfortable as well. MUSIC WAS SO GOOD. there was a $10 cover drinks were NYC typical price $10-$15. I really loved the music best LIVE music I've seen in a while.,,,
156,Kristyn M.,"Boston, MA",12,88,0,5.0,3/22/2010,"Always a must-visit on my NY trips. This place is a hidden gem with some unbelievable blues. Have gone on both a weeknight (sadly empty) and a weekend (quite busy, can be tough to find a table) - even when you're not listening to their prime weekend acts, the music is still extremely high quality. The drinks are drinks, not outrageously priced, service staff mostly friendly. But does that all really matter? No. The music is what it's all about here, and that you shall get.",1,,
157,Necator N.,"Manhattan, NY",5,118,212,4.0,3/15/2010,"Amazing place! AMAZING! (why am I only giving it 4 stars, then? read on)The music you will be lucky to listen to is unbelievably wonderful. I think I am lost for words. Bottom line: you can listen to some top-notch blues here. I have been many, many, many times and have never been disappointed. I think they open at 7 pm or so (and if you come that early, you will not be charged the $10 cover charge that applies if you come later, say at 9 or 10 pm). The first session is an intimate solo performance - he or she performs for about an hour or two.Then there's intermission, and the second session (9 pm - closing time) is a blues band. This is the main attraction usually, so the place gets totally insanely crowded, but the crowd is generally friendly, and composed of true blues lovers, so I don't mind it - I feel I am among friends. One ""minus"" is the drinks. You are forced to buy a number of drinks dependent on the length of time you stay. I have two problems with this. First, what if I don't want to get drunk (and I would, on 4-5 drinks)? I did try to offer them just money without the drink, but that didn't fly, so I purchased the drink and didn't consume it. Second, the drink selection plain sucks, and the drinks are very expensive. There isn't a drink on the list that I enjoy, and the only time I ever buy these drinks - is when I am at Terra Blues!But do, do, do come here! Who cares about the drinks! Music is simply heavenly!!!",,,1
158,Simran K.,"PRINCE, NY",0,2,0,5.0,9/1/2012,"I'm in love already. My first Saturday night in NYC I find myself in Terra Blues. This is the backyard bar you've always looked for. This is the place that you must make your usual. The music is phenomenal, how could you not love well played, classic blues? The service is amazing and everyone who works there is always willing to make a new friend. If you're ever looking for a place to find yourself during the week, look no further than Terra Blues.",,,
159,Vanessa M.,"New York, NY",0,100,0,3.0,7/6/2012,This place is fun. Live music and everyone minds their own business. The crowd is older (if you are into that).,,,

162,Pierre Trudeau I.,"Phoenix, AZ",110,370,70,5.0,9/2/2008,"This was a fantastic, unpretentious, laid back blues bar that I enjoyed from about 2 am to 3 am on a Sunday night/Monday morning. Some day I'll be back.",2,,2
163,Jes S.,"New York, NY",6,16,0,4.0,2/2/2007,"Terra Blues is the sort of place you can wander into with a pretty good guarantee of hearing a good band.  Even their house band is decent. The only real problem is that being on Bleecker means many out-of-towners end up here at the weekends, so the bands feel the need to provide the more classic blues tunes for the paying public. In fact, I'm pretty sure someone plays Hey Joe every night.  It may be one of the greatest songs ever written, but even Jimi didn't overplay it this much!  It also gets very crowded, but be patient.. you can usually score a table by clever positioning at some point during the night.  During the week, however, you're more likely to hear tunes you haven't heard for years or even never before, which is pretty cool .. It may well be that all the great blues songs have already been written, so it's a treat to chance upon one you haven't come across!",2,,
164,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,3.0,4/17/2007,"Okay place to see some very loud, blistering live blues, its a smaller, darker venue as you go upstairs on a really crowded block. The bartenders don't appreciate any comments about their tattoos even if they are compliments, so I wouldn't suggest bringing them up. I went on a not so crowded night, it was Thursday I think, and it was fine. There were a few groups, some at the bar, and i sat down to have a pint of guinness and sit back and let the guitarist blast some really furious chords.",1,2,
165,John S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",10,171,19,4.0,3/10/2008,"It's extremely difficult to get the vibe of a place when you are on a date with such an interesting woman. I mean most of the time I knew there was music playing, but I hardly heard anything that was going on. For a Monday night, the band was very good. This is definitely a venue that should be checked out. Good service, nice decor, cool people (not stuffy at all), and good music. I mean what more could you want? Oh yeah. I really bet you'd love to go with my date for the evening. Pshhhh. Good luck. You'll just have to settle for good music and a cool vibe.",1,,2
166,Melissa W.,"Belmont, CA",31,281,0,3.0,1/17/2007,"Too small considering they have great live music on a Saturday night for a decent cover price. By the time the band actually started to play I was drowning in the crowd, and I'm 5'7""! I chugged my drink so I could get out of there and waited happily outside for the rest of my party.",1,,1
167,Allie C.,"Paris, France",376,522,242,5.0,7/14/2008,"This place is awesome. In the middle of NYU college kid mecca, this is a more mellow, blues kinda place. It's really dim and romantic. There were two performers on the back stage playing the sax and guitar. Very chill. Very laid-back spot. Would def come  back!",1,,
168,Jeff M.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,296,1,3.0,1/31/2009,"I understand the blues scene in NY has made Terra its version of the Blue Note: an efficient turnstile for local and touring acts that's amenable to tourists and bobo's (clean and price insensitive). We loved the space and the one performer we caught, even if the subdued and sober audience felt like a poor accompaniment. But if this is a dependable roost for musicians like him, then there's no room for hating on the Terra.",,,1
169,Ken M.,"Gardiner, NY",15,2,0,5.0,11/30/2008,"When I am in the city this is THE PLACE for blues music. It is never disappointing, whether I see a friend play,  someone I am familiar with or someone who is new to me. It has a great low-key vibe, the wait staff keep the drinks coming without being obtrusive and since they don't serve food  they have no problem letting you go out and get a slice of pizza etc and letting you back in.",,,1
170,Fritz N.,"West Chester, PA",5,58,0,4.0,1/18/2009,"Been there twice, both on a Tuesday.  Once with a cover, once without.  Once packed, once empty.  Same great band.  Jr. Mack and The Terra Blues Band.  GREAT band.  Drinks are pricey.",,,

173,T. F.,"Sarasota, FL",0,136,0,2.0,11/29/2010,"Did we catch this place on an off night?  There were 2 superb blues groups playing BUT... the miking and amplification were so brutally overdone that all we could hear was a thunderous roar from the speakers dangling from the ceiling and flanking the stage.  The nuances of a steel guitar, the moan of a mouth organ or the subtle drive of the bass were totally lost.  Add to that a very smarmy male staff at the door and a poor (for NYC) selection of brews and alcohols and one has to wonder why such fine musicians choose this place for what --at least on this occasion- turned out to be an overdose of volume.  For the record: having lived in Baton Rouge LA I know a thing or two about delta blues and how they're played.  Again: great music drowned out by over-pumped decibels and a male staff on Teutonic steroids.",,,
174,Dora G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,3.0,2/2/2011,"I was a little skeptical about this place at first.  I got lured in by a greeter standing at the bottom of their steps saying some cheesy line like ""Terra Blues . . . best blues in NY!""  Despite the hyperbole, the place had a good feel with descent seating (about 60-70?), OK sound, and good music (at least the nights I visited).  I've been back several times and the drinks and cover aren't that expensive.  They get good acts, but you've got to shell out money to see them.",,,
175,Jessica W.,"San Francisco, CA",546,323,27,5.0,3/18/2009,"cool blues bar with a mellow intimate vibe. seated area in front of the stage is cramped but that contributes to the ""intimate"" nature of the place... candlelight all around makes it a good romantic/date place as well. bar area is in the back, drinks are pretty standard and they come around to the tables to take orders pretty consistently too.",1,,1
176,Alex W.,"London, United Kingdom",9,34,2,5.0,1/28/2010,Great live Jazz/Blues bar. We went as a large group and had a blast.,,,
