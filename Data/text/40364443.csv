0,Anne H.,"Chattanooga, TN",118,161,40,4.0,11/7/2018,"Solid four stars for Serra, which is pretty darn good for a touristy-type restaurant in the City. Went in last night with the family, including my baby girl. This location of Eataly is currently offering promotional menus at their restaurants for $18 and $28 so needless to say, the place was packed even on a random Tuesday night. After walking through the busy and LOUD downstairs area, I originally thought we might have to find someone else to go for dinner. However, I stopped and asked a host what he suggested... what restaurant he thought was best, where they could accommodate our party & baby,etc. He was lovely and so helpful in walking us over to the entrance to Serra. The hostess at Serra said there would be a 30 minute wait, but we could proceed upstairs. As soon as we got upstairs, we were so relieved that it was decibels quieter than the main floor. Whew! AND, even better, they took us to a table right away. As we had probably pushed baby girl a little too long between meals, this way certainly appreciated. After being seated, we were pretty quickly attended to by a water stewards, servers, and bread/food runners. We ordered a bottle of wine (also on special for $25 a bottle) and a number of appetizers and small plates to share-- the arugula salad, a meat platter, the mixed raclette plate, wagyu beef skewers, burrata with beets and polenta for baby girl. Though the food is not mind blowing, everything was tasty, and we especially loved the most simple dishes of arugula salad and the charcuterie plate. And the service was on point. We would certainly not hesitate to return next time we're in town.",1,,2
1,Adrián R.,"Brooklyn, NY",134,7,3,3.0,11/18/2018,"To start off, the ONLY reason I wouldn't give this place more stars is because it is overpriced for the portions given. My boyfriend made a surprise reservation here for Saturday afternoon because of an article he saw. The article highlighted the picture perfect restaurant because of its seasonal decorations. I quickly understood why because it was like walking into a winter wonderland. The place had a rustic feel to it and Italian vibes left and right - it was the perfect photo op. We came at just the right time because from November 5-18, they were offering a prix fixe menu so to save some money, that's what we ordered from. There were three appetizers and three entrees to choose from for just $28 per person. We got the apple salad and the buffalo mozzarella as appetizers and for the entrees we got the pork sausage and the chicken. The food was pretty good but definitely not what I was expecting as they were very small portions.The beers we drank were about the only good thing we had but it seems like most people only come here for the experience and not really for the food. Now that I've already gone, I really have no need or desire to go back.",,,
2,Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",221,404,327,3.0,11/14/2018,"Beautiful ambiance. Stronnnng almost nauseating cheese aroma.The rooftop restaurant is gorgeous and the decor changes with the seasons. The menu is interesting, and the portions weren't as large as we had hoped (came for appetizers and wine). The raclette with potatoes was the star of the apps! The wagyu skewers were a little chewier than expected. We also did a meat and cheese platter which was microscopic. The wine was fresh, but no ice bucket was provided.",,,
3,Stephanie C.,"New York, NY",248,22,25,3.0,11/14/2018,"Went here on a Tuesday night with a party of 5 (made a reservation by calling even though it said it was fully booked on open table). The decor was PHENOMENAL like this is a place I would take friends visiting NYC if they wanted somewhere beautiful and instagram worthy. However because it was so dark outside, pictures didn't come out well unfortunately.As for the food, my family and I did a mix of the restaurant deal at the time (2 courses for $28) and some dishes on the menu.Insalata di Mela- raddichio,fennel, apple salad (3/5): Not bad! I'm not a fan of raddichio because it made it very bitter but that's just my opinion. Otherwise fennel apple and mustard are always great combosBuffalo Mozzarella (3/5)- good mozzarella but it was very cold when I got it. Which sounds weird but I've been to restaurants downstairs in eataly and they always serve cheese room temp because that's when you taste the flavor the best. Mozzarella just came with salt and pepperZucca Arrostita (5/5)- honeynut squash filled with a hazelnut filling(?) this was so so delicious. Perfect fall flavors and the squash was very well cooked.Pollo con lettichie e cavolleti (2/5)- chicken with black lentils. I wasn't a huge fan of this. It was small portions of dry chicken and flavorless lentils. This may have been because it was the restaurant fest deal but otherwise i wouldn't get it againCavolfiore Fritto (4/5)- fried cauliflower. This was delicious!! The risotto sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the fried cauliflower. The capers it came with worked well with it but they provided a LOT on the plateProbusta con polenta (4/5)- sausage with Italian cornmeal. This was also very good! It came with one medium sized sausage, pickled cabbage, mustard, and this creamy cheese polenta. They provided a lot more polenta than protein (but it was delicious) Panna cotta (4/5)- delicious dessert. It was very sweet though Tiramisu (5/5)- usually not a fan of tiramisu but this one has more chocolate and coffee flavor! Really delicious Overall this was a BEAUTIFUL restaurant and would absolutely come back to see what it looks like in the daytime. However I thought the food was good, not outstanding in any way, and pretty pricey for the size and quality. I did come during a restaurant deal so I would love to come back and try a restaurant dish",,,
4,Khusbu P.,"New York, NY",188,175,352,2.0,11/18/2018,OMG. THE FOOD AT SERRA ALPINA IS SO BAD. Please do not go here for dinner. Costco meatballs taste better than the meatballs here. Only go for drinks and the beautiful decor. There's about an hour long wait for a table so put your name down and walk around downstairs.,1,,

Updated review","Still dreaming about the arugula salad I had here last week! Simple, sea salted, and the perfect late lunch meal paired with burrata. My friend and I met up around 4 p.m. before a nearby event and decided to head up to the rooftop of Eataly for a quick bite. This was my third time here and it doesn't disappoint- we were seated quickly and attended to with consistently refreshed water, a lovely autumnal view, and fresh Italian fare. While it probably gets more hectic at peak dinner/lunch hours, it has a relaxed and welcoming vibe for locals and visitors alike. A few of the menu items we weren't familiar with, so we had to ask- ingredients we assumed were vegetables turned out to be beef. Definitely clarify if you have any doubt or dietary restrictions!",7,2,6
6,Tash G.,"Mississauga, Canada",6,74,49,4.0,10/8/2018,"The view at this restaurant is AMAZING. Very fall, very festive. It is the perfect place for brunch/lunch! The spiked cider (hot or cold) is delicious and a must try for sure and the food was also delicious so no complaints there. We ordered several dishes between four people and I would say the only one we could've lived without was the pesto pasta. It wasn't anything special. The service was slow and normally I would complain but we were in no rush and the ambience was nice enough we did not mind waiting at all. I highly recommend this place if you want the fall feels and good food to go with it.",1,,
7,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,9/26/2018,This absolutely is one the most gorgeous rooftops. Of course this place isn't much for the view but for their own seasonal decor. I just met my friend last Monday for quick drinks and damn the fall decor!! We were absolutely mesmerized. Its just so so gorgeous! I can just keep gushing over the decor! They have a customized fall menu with fall themes drinks. Each one better than the previous! I tried their local hot apple cider. Try it! It'll give you the proper fall feel making your transition from summer fall extremely pleasant and exciting. The ambiance it great and so is the service. You get a good service even at the bar. The server would gladly recommend you food and bring out whatever you ordered.Love love love this place! Highly recommended! DO NOT give this place a miss this fall! I am surely coming back again this time for a full course dinner.  I can't wait to see what they will bring in winters.,2,,1
8,Sharon M.,"Jacksonville, FL",54,176,1048,4.0,10/7/2018,"Recommend the bruschetta which features a salami topping but that pasta & eggplant - yum! BRUSCHETTA CON 'NDUJA  Grilled House-Baked Otto Bread with Salami. It's not your typical bruschetta served as single bite sized servings. It's a bigger portion, more rustic plating and you cut/break off pieces. PACCHERI ALLA NORMA - eggplant, tomatoes and ricotta. Worth ordering again. I think I expected more views from the rooftop but otherwise service is just right here. Our server Nicole was helpful to provide recommendations, checking in, refilling drinks and was prompt to take additional orders when another set of guests arrived to our table.",,,2
9,Caitlin D.,"New York, NY",167,75,56,4.0,9/23/2018,"Honestly, I've been to eataly's various seasonal rooftop restaurants a few times and it was always good but never a place I'd recommend people make a planned effort to get to. I was here last night though with my mother and it was definitely the best menu I've seen from them and all the food we had was amazing! I would definitely recommend a visit for the food as well as the ambiance. The food is definitely a little pricey; but not abnormally high pricing for NYC. Also get a bottle of wine, it's a much better deal than their by the glass pricing.Service was definitely slow(we were there for over an hour before we got any food) and at times I felt our waiter was a little curt. Supposedly there was an issue in the kitchen which caused the delay although a part of me suspects our order just didn't get put in until well after we ordered since the kitchen mix up only looked to affect our table.The only other con is just how tightly packed in the tables along the wall are; each table is no more than 6 inches apart so it's borderline communal dining; my mother and I  hopped tables so we landed at the end of the row which was much nicer- that way we were only listening to one other conversation instead of conversations on both sides of us.",,,
10,jonathan G.,"Belleville, NJ",243,44,84,4.0,10/26/2018,This was a fantastic find in Eataly. The ambiance was upscale and cozy. It felt like being on an Italian roof top. The menu is a bit limited but still very delicious. The charcuterie plate was very fresh and the pairings were perfect. The wine list was extensive and also had pairings to go with it. I would definitely recommend this place for a date. It was on the expensive side but worth the quality.,,,
11,Kate S.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",0,16,5,2.0,11/16/2018,Italian food for sure. But this is not my style. I should stick with the ground floor and have regular pasta instead. Portion was just tiny for the price. One thing I noticed that Some of the waiters wears sunglasses!,,,
12,Cynthia L.,"New York, NY",599,23,5,2.0,11/11/2018,"Food was ok - the pork shoulder special was delicious. The fusilli  was pretty good. Got some other dishes that I honestly forgot about because 1) it wasn't very memorable and 2) we went for a friend's birthday and discovered they have a cake cutting fee. First they said it was $60. Then they said it was $5 per plate and then $5 per slice. As in... each time they bring the knife down, you're $5 more broke. What? Place was beautiful at night I guess.",1,,
13,Vanessa L.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",157,303,973,3.0,7/19/2018,"This is a long overdue review. I was finally able to visit Eataly and I love pasta. My bf and I decided to eat at this place and have a nice lunch on the rooftop. The wait wasn't that long at all and we just shopped around downstairs while waiting. I got pasta that had squid, clams, shrimp with a tomato based sauce. My bf opted for chicken. Keep in mind that these portions are pretty small. To be honest, I didn't think my dish was all that. It wasn't as flavorful and I was expecting more to it. I think my bf kinda enjoyed his but it wasn't something that was super fantastic. We both definitely expected something better out of this place and was kinda disappointed. I think we would've liked one of the places downstairs better but overall it was an alright experience enjoying the nice weather upstairs on the rooftop.",2,,1
14,Brooklynbaby R.,"Manhattan, NY",55,196,23,2.0,10/23/2018,"I'll start by saying aesthetically this place is really pretty. The rooftop is great and I liked the rustic vibe. The food eh was unfortunately underwhelming. I choose a Sicilian dish, I know it well. The sauce lacked flavor and I must say I wouldn't have choose the type of pasta he did. I really had high expectations as it's really hard to mess up eggplant, pasta and a lite sauce. We were a table of 7 and waiting well over an hour for our meal which only added to my disappointment of the flavor being less than satisfactory. Typically I greatly dislike commercialized restaurants because they creat American style dishes and this place just proves my theory. The manager was very nice in compensating us with drinks, we actually almost left because we were so hungry and waited so long.I wish I could say the food was worth the wait; I'll pass next time.",,,
15,Inna Z.,"Manhattan, NY",13,139,340,3.0,11/12/2018,"We made reservations during restaurant week on a Sunday at 1. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it was definitely worth seeing, but the portions were tiny. We all ordered a chicken dish on the 28 dollar special menu. It's chicken and it costs them next to nothing but the amount on our plates was a joke. My appetizer was ok but my husband's appetizer was also tiny. I had iced latte and it didn't taste good at all. I guess it was a bad idea to come during the restaurant week.",,,
16,Deb E.,"Guilford, CT",8,152,254,3.0,7/10/2018,"I've had this place on my ""list"" for years and finally got there last Saturday. Bad on me but I really thought the rooftop would have been more open, it was not open at all and it had barely an outside view. FYI. It was ok but not great. The wine was expensive but good we had a Gavi or friulli I can't remember which. Food is small here and we had pesto fusilli the only pasta on the menu, lamb skewers, beef skewers, fried artichokes, and a bread basket. The artichokes were absolutely the best part but a super small portion for more than 2 to share. The pesto was our number two - the rest was not memorable at all. Service was ok. Not very interested in us brought the food then we didn't see our waiter for a while and then we were ready to get out of there.Spendy small portions and just ok. Glad we tried it but it won't be on my regular rotation.",1,,
17,Cat K.,"Vienna, VA",201,53,74,5.0,11/11/2018,"Pricy as expected bc of prime location. The restaurant itself is upstairs on the rooftop. Expect to be content but not full when you leave. Most people go mainly for the ambiance. Had a great time and very well cooked food for restaurant fest. Me and my friend had prix fix meal. I requested the pimento on the side bc I don't eat dairy. It was also my friends birthday, so they gave her a free dessert and the cake had a small candle on it.",,,
18,Seho M.,"Gill, MA",155,54,57,4.0,11/9/2018,"I found this restaurant to be rather good. Given that it is currently Autumn, there were many fall-inspired dishes. My table got a lovely smorgasbord of meats and cheeses - the meats were delicious! The salads were okay. The braised pork shoulder was phenomenal! Practically melted in my mouth. Not too happy with the service though. They seemed as if they were not content with their jobs.",,,
19,Tian Q.,"Manhattan, NY",81,173,384,4.0,6/26/2018,"Came here in a Saturday night with no reservation, was told it will be one hour wait but we only waited 20 minutes. We ordered the pesto pasta, prosciutto, wagyu skewer, and meatball. We wanted to order the bread and the seafood pasta but they were sold out. Pesto pasta: so refreshing! It was not heavy at all, it has a grassy after taste to it but I didn't mind it. Prosciutto: for $9, I was expecting a few slices of meat, probably 3 max, but we got a whole board of prosciutto. I was shooked. It was totally worth it. Wagyu skewer: it was very tasty. But it was a tiny bit over done for me, because wagyu is suppose to be very tender and melts in your mouth. Meatball: good portion and tender. The flavor was very nice. We also ordered froze and cider. They were both excellent!Overall, I will come back, it's a very chill place to have some prosciutto and wine to chat. I will get the bread next time since it was sold out, so sad.",1,,
20,Anatoli L.,"Stamford, CT",98,321,350,2.0,5/6/2018,"Interesting experience. We went to the restaurant specifically because it is advertised as ""roof-top"". It is rooftop all right, but there is no view really of any kind - a little bit of the building In front, and that's all - if you are hoping for a nice view of the city, this is no the place. Good beer and very good wine list, good number of wines at $50-$60 - we had an orange Trebbiano wine called Rhesan, and it was very good ($50). The service was really indifferent. We were told that we need to place the whole order at once and the waiter can't add anything later on. The charcuterie board arrived without any explanations regarding meat and cheese, and it was served literally without bread (tiny piece arrived for 4 people to share). The burrata was served just by itself with some olive oil, no salad or anything else with it - and Trader Joe's sells better tasting burrata than what was served. The only plus was deep fried artichokes. Overall, really lacking the service.  No view and food leaves much to be desired. Not recommended.",2,,
21,Katherine L.,"Arcadia, CA",287,386,244,2.0,8/5/2018,"This place is located at the rooftop of Eataly. Through the entrance of Eataly, you can first put down your name for a table then walk around the store before going up to the restaurant. You also have the option to hang around the bar area upstairs and enjoy the ambiance before your table is ready. I was pleasantly surprised when my table was ready earlier than expected. We were seated right away and our waiter came and greeted us. Water was brought to us very quickly,  but then it all went downhill. Our server just disappeared on us for at least 15 minutes and left us alone, clueless on what's going on or how to order. We ended up flagging someone else down and he was kind enough to take our order for us. However, the poor service from our server continues as he failed to bring us the complimentary bread until we asked, and brought it out well after our meal arrived. I expected much better service at an upscale place like this. Other than that, food is great. Would've known what their speciality is if our waiter tended to us more. Their beef skewers are pretty good though.",2,1,1
22,Rasmeet S.,"Ann Arbor, MI",232,20,7,4.0,10/13/2018,The decor is gorgeous -- if you love seasonal themed stuff you will like the ambiance here. The food was okay. We liked the small plates we ordered to start (potatoes and fried cheese). The cider was good too. I liked my pork shoulder but my husbands steak wasn't that great and the plate was mostly arugula.,1,,
23,Laura J.,"Seaford, NY",30,125,91,2.0,7/10/2018,"I'll start with the good:The bar/restaurant itself is beautiful. You feel like you're in a garden enjoying some food and drinks with friends. They have a retractable roof which on a nice day would be great but unfortunately we were there on a rainy day. The service at the table was wonderful and food was pretty good. Definitely order the cocktail with the rosé popsicle. It was refreshing and amazing. One of the best cocktails I've had in a long time. Now the bad:It. Was. Hot. Not only was it a rainy day but it was a humid day. That retractable roof almost acts as a greenhouse roof and seals in all the heat and humidity. Just sitting at the bar we were dripping sweat. They have fans but they barely helped. The bartenders weren't friendly at all and acted like we were a bother. Mind you, this was 1:00 on a Friday in the summer = empty. When we sat down the waitress informed us that they were out of Burrata, out of one of the two pasta dishes on the menu, out of a 3rd item on the menu (I can't remember) and out of one of the frozen drinks they serve. They were only open for an hour and a half!! With the abundance of restaurants downstairs in Eataly, the rooftop ambiance isn't worth it. Try something inside.",4,,
24,Charisse S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",130,192,359,4.0,5/4/2018,"This was my first time attempting the rooftop at Eataly during spring/summer weather. Generally speaking, Eataly is a huge tourist trap with hordes of people milling about that tend to ruin the experience of shopping or dining in there. Today wasn't exactly an exception but we decided press forward anyway because it was nice out.Once you're seated it's actually quite pleasant. The ceiling is beautifully decorated with plants and lights that weaved through out. The music is set at just the right volume so that it isn't drowning out your conversation and it isn't unbearably loud even when the dining area is full. As for the food, the menu has a lot of seasonal, healthy garden/farm to table options and the cocktail menu is interesting. It's not the cheapest place and the portions are on the smaller side, but I'm sure people know that already and it makes up for it by delivering quality food. For drinks, I went with the Sole Italiano-- very balanced drink that's refreshing on a warm spring/summer day. Not too sweet or too bitter. There are also some frozen drink options that I'll try when I come back at some point. For food I wanted to keep it light, so I went with the Pork and Veal Meatballs (POLPETTINE ALLA GENOVESE) which were much better than I thought they would be. It was highly recommended from the waitress. It was filling without being heavy and just the right portion. So to sum up, the best way to guarantee a good experience here is to make a reservation for a table or to come here at an off peak time. It's as simple as that. You can't just wander in between 5:30-7 and not expect a large crowd. What will happen is that you'll be standing in a very narrow bar area trying and most likely failing to get the bartender's attention while being constantly pushed and shoved by people coming and going. I look forward to returning soon.",,,
25,Bethany N.,"Gilmer, TX",366,80,186,5.0,10/3/2018,"This place is PERFECTION!! The rooftop at Serra is made to look like a greenhouse and is so precious. It's all decorated seasonally and they do an impeccable job with it. The food is also DELICIOUS! Loved that Serra is above Eataly because I had an opportunity to roam around before and after eating. Such a great place for small or large groups, but definitely a stop. I will be back!!",,,
26,Rebecca C.,"New York, NY",284,323,7,2.0,9/16/2018,"People mostly come up here to take photos and leave. I wish I did that after I sat through an overpriced, oversalted lunch. Staff is friendly enough, but the wait time to get any service is somewhere between too long and eternity. Decor is beautiful, hence why there are so many photo mongers, but not really a must-visit place for me.",1,,
27,Merrill R.,"Manhattan, NY",156,7,0,2.0,11/19/2018,"I've been here every year for the past 3 years, and every year the service declines in favor of being more instagrammable. You walk in and it's completely beautiful but also completely packed on a Monday night at 9:15. I made this reservation for my friends and I about two weeks in advance, and it was either 9:15 or 4:30. I'd like to give our server the benefit of the doubt, and say that he was overextended rather than inattentive. A lot of what happened was beyond his control, but overall I think they've still got some kinks to work out operationally. - Out server thought the first bottle we ordered was out of stock, which it was. He returned for us to reorder 15m later. He thought the second bottle we chose was out of stock (it also was) and informed us they were turning over many bottles. It was rather frustrating. He ultimately brought something that was good, in our price range, but that took about 30m in total, and then another 10 before he came back for our food order. We also didn't get anything to keep the bottle chilled. - We we're hungry so we did ask for stuff to come out as it was ready, but the order didn't make much sense. The arugula salad (arugula, shaved parm, balsamic) was the second to last to come out. The raclette trio (prosciutto, roast potatoes, pickled veg) took 10-15 more min than the raclette with roasted potatoes only, and 25m more than the raclette with prosciutto only. - The raclette was served on cold plates, so in a rooftop restaurant with only space heaters, it congealed rather quickly All in all, much better for drinks and snacks than actual dinner.",,,
28,Katie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",250,31,2,3.0,10/2/2018,It would be challenging to anyone not to love the rooftop at Eataly. What an adorable space. Serra has a happy hour 3-6 Monday to Friday. Though the restaurant might like to remind the bartender. He charged us full price for 2 Aperol spritz. The refund came swiftly. But who forgets that your on happy hour??? The menu looks great and the spritz was perfectly made to the point i could almost imagine I was in northern Italy. On the whole a great experience I can't wait to go back.,,,
29,Alexis S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",15,224,16,4.0,6/30/2018,"My dad I came here after walking through Eately and wanted to check it out. The space itself is very cute with plants and lots of natural light filtering in. NOTE: there is no AC as far as I know, but they do have ceiling fans to keep it cool, so if you are coming on a hot day, you might feel like melting. Nevertheless, the drinks we had were refreshing and the food looked good as well though we didn't eat anything. I would definitely come back here again to try out the food and take in the ambiance.",,,
30,Sung K.,"New York, NY",242,520,0,4.0,6/24/2018,"Just checked out the bar scene today and loved the atmosphere. Extremely cute place that makes you think typical/basic brunch vibes - except you see a lot more families and tourists mingling with good looking people. Service can be slow (couple of bartenders for the entire place, and they seemed stressed) and prices can be a tadddd bit higher than normal, but  imo it's worth it for the vibe.Good catch up place or even a light drink after or before dinner at nearby restaurants.",,,
31,Ali B.,"New York, NY",233,79,236,4.0,6/23/2018,Came here for lunch on a work outing and thought it was a great rooftop location. There is plenty of seating and a beautiful ambiance. Would absolutely recommend the frosé - not even sure of the ingredients but it was delicious. The menu had a great variation of veggies and entrees had pasta and meat. It doesn't have he widest selection. I would say to see what you want to order prior to going. Would come here again definitely!,,,
32,Helen W.,"San Francisco, CA",338,144,99,5.0,5/22/2018,"Outstanding food, drinks, and ambiance at this rooftop (covered! with fans and heat lamps, if needed) rustic Italian pop-up. Come to savor your food, linger in good company, and fall in love with Eataly all over again :)FOOD: My only regret is that my stomach could not hold more.- Starter (free) foccacia--usually I don't comment on house bread, but this was one of my favorite items at the table. Translucent with the gift of EVOO and so soft, we easily went through 3 rounds of this stuff!- Pane (whole wheat bread) made with house starter, served with EVOO, lardo (pure fatty goodness), and butter.  Crisp crust just shy of too hard with a moist, wholesome interior that paired so well with the olive oil. Arrived warm :). - Cheese sampler--yes. Our favorite were the Parmesan (what a glorious and underappreciated cheese) and the Bufarolo (a cousin of Taleggio with a creamy start, all of the tang, and none of the after burn/sting of Taleggio. Completely in love). Other cheese were excellent but not notable (medium-hard mild cheeses)- Fried green tomatoes--surprise hit at the table. Delicately breaded, packed with flavor, and all on top of a gorgeous green puree (pea/mint? Whatever, it was deliciouis). - Asparagus--executed well with generous amounts of olive oil and a medium amount of cheese. While tasty, this did not feel as special as the other items. The most interesting feature of this dish to all at the table was the chop pattern (diagonal into short, bite-sized segments)--we'll be replicating this at home to remove the screech factor of dinner knives on the plate. - Fusilli with fresh pesto--pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly al dente (I have found there is even a range within al dente, and I appreciated that this was on the softer side of al dente, allowing us to better appreciate the tenderness of the fresh pasta). I have never seen a noodle so perfectly coated in its sauce (what's their secret?). Smattering of pignoli over the top was artful and tasty! The olive oil left at the end excellent on the pane and the foccacia :). - Desserts did not appeal to us (tiramisu + fruit was too innovative for us), but luckily a quick journey to Eataly downstairs + Tiramisu della Nonna + Madison Square Park = perfect recipe to close out the night!DRINK:- Sangiovese--at $40/bottle, this was a steal and paired well with the meal. - Frosé--rosé/vodka popsicle served in a glass of sparkling wine ($15)--this is culinary and mixology innovation! The popsicle was so fun and well executed (delicate, citrusy flavor complemented the rosé)--all the fun of childhood for grownups. Awesome dessert option!SERVICE: Nick was attentive and humorous. We appreciated his empathy when a member of our party feared she could not drink while on her course of antibiotics (happily some manufacturer site research revealed this to be a myth) and menu/portion recommendations (prevented us from over-ordering). Reservation: Loved the text notification when it was time to go up. We waited for 30m (no reservation) after a 6pm walk up, which I considered an absurdly wonderful gift. You should pay a visit before word gets out! Bar: No reservation required (you can take the elevator up to 14) and you can order off the menu! Only issue was service--it was woefully understaffed ~8:30pm (1 bar tender; 30 thirsty humans). Some staff arrived in time to help before too many people got antsy, but this was a gap in an otherwise perfect experience. AMBIANCE: Enchanting is the only word I have--the delicate lights strung from the clear ceiling, the lush (fake, so don't look too closely) hanging plants, the rustic plant prints framed on the wall... it felt like a fairy tale I didn't want to end. Lovely place to catch up with friends or take a date! I'm surprised the other pop-ups are rated so lowly on Yelp--Serra is a treasure!",2,,1

I had high expectations as Eately is one of my favorite places for Italian food in the city, but I was extremely disappointed at the rooftop. I read the poor reviews on yelp and was hoping they were wrong, but after my dining experience at La Bierria, the 2.5 star overall yelp rating is pretty accurate and I would not come back. First of all, the menu is extremely limited and only had a couple of entrees. It was mainly appetizer selections of cheese/antipastas/salami, etc none of which I wanted as a meal for dinner.  When I went, I was surprised the restaurant only offered 2 pasta selections as I thought it was an Italian restaurant. We decided to try one pasta dish, but it was extremely bland and the pasta unfortunately tasted like paper. We could have had ten times as better pasta from the Olive Garden. We also ordered bruschetta, but the tomatoes tasted like they were from a can.   The rooftop has a nice ambiance, but the food failed to deliver, and it was way over priced for the small portions and lack of flavor. Recommend spending money at a different restaurant with better quality food. There are much better places to eat in the city.",4,1,2

Upon first glance, I fully loved the ambiance here; they've made it beach-themed, but I doubt it's always like that. It's very fun, colorful, and classy, yet I didn't feel out of place going in leggings and a crop top. They know they're very popular, but they're humble about it. Our waitress, Sherry, was a doll. Read the specials to us, and the kale salad appealed to me, so we split it for an app. I ordered the swordfish and friend ordered the branzino. I liked my swordfish (and the small portion size, as I wasn't that hungry, but if I were, I wouldn't have been satisfied), and also tried the branzino (duh) and liked it, too. Seemed like pretty standard meals. I guess I'm giving Birreria three stars, because nothing really blew me away. It was forgettable. I could get the same for cheaper elsewhere. It was a solid meal and I'm glad I tried it, and it was overall a three-star experience.",4,2,3

Updated review","Ok, I have to admit, we were comparative dining here with last year's winter edition. It was nice to be out under the sky. I loved the apple brandy spiked hot apple cider. Everything else was just ok...some of the dishes were the same as winter's menu but it felt like the presentation was lacking.  The decor was really fake, I mean I know it's fake in the winter but this was like cheap fake. Our cheese and meats came on two separate ginormous platters ....with nothing else on them. Afterwards the server brought out and unceremoniously dumped a small dish of jam ""it's for cheese"". Had to ask for bread. The server, while effective, raced away as soon as anyone said three words. Fried cheese dish came out cold. Dessert menu was so unimpressive we skipped and instead went downstairs. Sure is off the mark this year. Sads.",,,

We got a couple of meats and cheeses to try at the bar, and it came with an apricot spread and focaccia bread. I also tried all of their ciders and my favorite one was the one from Italy.",,,

The venue is hotter than I liked even though it was only like 65F outside. I guess it's because they got a lot of sun, but it has bad ventilation? Now the food: we got the pork shoulder to share as the appetizer. It came with a bed of arugula, and the shoulder was delicious. It has crispy skin and moist. I got the seafood pasta and that was done perfectly. The pasta texture was al dente and the sauce had great finesse.Their service was OK but a bit slow.",1,1,2

My friends and I made a reservation for 8 pm on Friday. When we arrived our table was not ready so we got a drink at the bar. The bar was way too crowded and the space is not air conditioned. It was too crowded and too hot. They should really limit the amount of people heading to the rooftop. It was pointless to have a reservation because the table wasn't ready until 8:50. We had to wait 50 minutes for a table with a reservation! When we sat down, our table was facing this very aggressive fan. The menus were blowing and we were very uncomfortable. At first, the management had said we cannot shut the fan because it will be too hot. After speaking with them and expressing our unhappiness, they finally shut it off. The food was very underwhelming and disappointing. We ordered the bread with lard and it came with olive oil and butter. The presentation was horrible. Then we ordered 5 cheeses and 5 cured meats for 50 dollars       . I felt like I could have put together a nicer board myself for way less than 50 dollars.

My friend and I shared a bottle of sparkling rose and a plate of 5 cheeses. The cheese was delicious but the focaccia was the highlight. Holy cow that stuff is like crack!

Updated review","I should have taken the negative reviews seriously, but for whatever reason, I had some hope that eataly's new-ish rooftop would be something other than a tourist trap. There's little point in making a reservation here, as we weren't seated until 45 mins after our 8pm reservation time (I admit, a friend of mine was a bit late, but we waited at least a half hour when she actually did arrive). We hung out at the overcrowded bar while we waited for our table. I had an aperol spritz, which was standard. When we finally were led to our table, we were told that we'd again have to wait another few minutes because another party ""took our table."" We were unclear what this meant at first, but quickly understood that another party took our original  table bc the table we were sat at had a huge, powerful fan blowing straight at it. I'm not one to complain about this stuff, but after our menus flew off the table and my eyes starting running from the wind, I asked our server what we could do. After being turned down twice, the manager finally came over and shut the thing off. No apology. Despite how unpleasant this was, the way this place is decorated is really lovely, so it's a shame the rest was such a bust. After ordering the cheese plate, charcuterie, and bread w lard, (and artichokes that never came), we decided to stop there. Not sure how you manage to make a standard cheese and meat plate bland, but it was accomplished. Despite the poor experience and underwhelming food, our waiter was lovely. Skip this spot. There are better rooftops.",2,,
50,Alison R.,"New York, NY",0,9,80,3.0,7/17/2018,"This rooftop is definitely one for the tourists. When you first walk in, it looks instagrammable. The bar was packed, but my friend and I were lucky enough to snag a high-top in the seated area that was still eligible for bar service. The drinks are okay - we opted for a carafe of the Flatiron Fizz for the best bang for our buck. We ordered a side of dip and focaccia - the dish arrived with two lousy pieces of focaccia that barely made a dent in the dip. On top of that, trying to get more bread was a headache. We asked 3 different people and 20 minutes later we got the extra bread. Service was less than ideal.",1,1,
51,Mary C.,"Manhattan, NY",157,275,591,4.0,8/19/2017,"A rooftop on top of Eataly with no view but trendy nonetheless because of the rooftop and Eataly hype. The bar is always crowded, but there are tables available for a seat down meal. I thought the service was great and chill, which was perfect because I came on a Saturday afternoon. My friends and I ordered the frose (highly recommended), oysters (they use Island Creek oysters!), prosciutto and the chicken thigh. The chicken thigh was very good.Overall this was a chill experience and perfect for a summer afternoon.",2,,
52,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,390,4425,3.0,7/18/2017,"I never knew that there was a restaurant on the rooftop of Eataly so this was a cool find. While I really enjoyed the decor and thought the food was decent, the service and expensive pricing was not to my liking. However, given the prime location and the fact that there is seafood on the menu, the prices are somewhat understandable.Upon arriving at Sabbia, the front desk had a lovely bouquet of colorful flowers on top and there was a wall with Sabbia spelled out in neon turqouise, as well as beach balls all over the wall leading to the outdoor bar and restaurant. The space was fairly large with many little tables and huge beach umbrellas to provide shade. The place had a beachy feel and casual atmosphere. We were seated without having to wait and were given complimentary bread in a brown paper bag, which was pretty tasty.I shared the Fritto Misto alla Ligure, which consisted of assorted fried seafood lingurian style, which was a good thing because it cost $26. It wasn't huge, but since I wasn't super hungry, it was enough for the 2 of us. The dish included calamari, white fish and shrimp. There was no accompanying sauce with it and to the food's credit, it actually didn't need sauce. My friend and I added some lemon to the dish and that helped bring out the flavors. It was delicious, especially the shrimp and calamari. Everything was fried to perfection with incredibly crispy batter and was well seasoned. The waiter got one of our orders wrong and was not attentive. Throughout the time we were there, whenever we needed the waiter/waved him over, we were pretty much ignored, including when we wanted to ask for the bill. The hostess was very sweet though. Still, I would not return.",12,11,10

I think this is the cutest picture-perfect rooftop I've been to!It got pretty crowded, but my two friends and I managed to find a little space by the bar. We tried 6 different kinds of bruschetta and got a carafe of the beach plum spritz ($30).",2,,
54,Jaron A.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/21/2018,"This place is vile, and that's a huge disappointment, because if you've been to Eataly, you know that it is a magical wonderland of the best Italian ingredients to be found in this country. I guess the trip from the ground floor to the roof is an arduous one, because nothing they serve up there is comparable to the things they sell downstairs. Honestly, it was just like the Olive Garden on an off night. Except with way ruder service. The wait time was ridiculous. They quoted an hour, but it was closer to 2. And they never apologize or assure you that you haven't been forgotten. They just let you languish in a pile of angry people. My girlfriend, who is generally quite reasonable, became murderous and nearly unhinged, because we left a better restaurant on account of a longer wait. There was blood in her eyes and some on the corners of her mouth, mixed with froth and poison.And for those a-holes crowing about how lush and green it is in the restaurant...I mean, sure. It's full of green plastic plants. If plastic does it for you, then knock yourself out.The food is so utterly forgettable that even though we went there yesterday, I'm having a hard time remembering what we ordered. Here, I'll try. Fava bean puree: Meh. Beef skewers: Ok, but how can you mess that up? Salad with arugula and market vegetables: Gross. They use an anchovy vinaigrette that is all anchovy. Meatballs: Frozen, I'd wager. Gross. Pesto pasta: Definitely not fresh. Undercooked and dry. The wine was good and our actual server was, too! I forgot to say that as I was droning on and on about the terrible hosts. But overall, this feels like a tourist trap, and I'm ashamed to have fallen into it. There are a thousand better italian restaurants in New York. There are three better italian restaurants in this very building, in fact. Don't go here. Go anywhere else. Really, anywhere else.",3,3,1

We asked if we could move and where moved immediately no questions asked. Everything was excellent up until that point. The service was sub par. We got the menu and truthfully didn't understand 75% of it. We ended up ordering the Bistec Fiorentina which is priced at $145.00 even though it's not listed on the menu. The server told us it was enough for 3 people and it came with vegetables and a caprese salad. That was not the case. Took about 45 minutes to get our food and turns out the caprese was not part of the meal. Luckily the server notified the chef and they brought out one complementary.

The only issue I have is that we ordered the 5 cheese plate for $17 at the bar, waited 30 minutes only to find out that the waiter did not put our order in. After waiting for nothing, we decided to close out and leave. The waiter offered to put an order in when he found out he screwed up but we were already leaving.

I didn't eat here as the menu didn't look too vegan friendly, but dishes ranged from cheeses (duh), cured meats and fresh seafood.  I think the prices were on par for the location/scene.  You're really paying for this atmosphere and the fact that you're at Mario Batali establishment.

While there, they pulled the rooftop back and we had a better view of the city. If you're looking for a drink with a cool atmosphere, definitely go here. The food was just okay. We got the quail legs and wagyu steak. It was the most expensive just okay steak I've had in a while. The food was underwhelming. I'm a big food lover and I even had a hard time finding something on the menu that I really wanted to try. Seemed like a limited menu that was kinda out there. Maybe, I just didn't have the right thing? But with as many restaurants as there are in Manhattan and rooftop bars... I think I'd try somewhere else.",,,

There is no view, but the outdoor seating is still really refreshing and nice!Our waitress was really nice, attentive, and helpful. We wanted to get formaggi (cheese) and salumi (cured meats), but didn't really know what we liked. We let her decide, and everything she picked out was really delicious! My friend and I both also got pasta dishes. One of was seafood, and I forgot the other one, but I remember both were really delicious as well.",,1,

Updated review","Came here for a speakeasy event. I'm not sure what ""Sabbia"" is (maybe the restaurant portion?), but I used to just the Eataly rooftop as just La Birreria.Either way, it started out as a beautiful night. It started to downpour, but luckily they have a retractable roof, so extra points for that!The roof is pretty big, with some cabanas but mostly small-ish tables. No real views of anything though, unless you want to look at the back of other buildings.There were a few problems with them being short-staffed, and their slushy machine breaking, but I'll chalk that up to the event and not the venue.One thing I can blame them for was their bathroom light was completely off, and there was no clear light switch. A friend told them about it, and they said they'd turn it on, but they never did. I did get to pee by cell phone light though.",,,
74,Benji D.,"New York, NY",176,13,0,2.0,6/9/2018,"This place has the potential to be a great rooftop trattoria but it is a let down for a number of reasons:- wait times are ridiculous- one hour long for 6pm dinner. They had tables that sat empty for at least 15 minutes, all while customers ready to sit and pay were told to wait- overpriced for what you get -they are SO cheap here, they even refuse to bring you more bread. - they only had TWO pasta options- two?!!! Shame. What a waste for an Italian restaurant that is upstairs from a full gourmet Italian food market. - food here was unremarkable. The fava bean dip tasted like grainy  hummus. Don't get it! - too loud and lots of kids around the place which is great but just muddles the romantic atmosphere Not sure I'd ever go,back. It's a beautiful summer rooftop if you just want to grab a drink. Don't bother eating here. Better Italian can be found in NYC.",1,,
75,Kay L.,"Denver, CO",4,171,3,2.0,6/2/2018,"Decent food and absolutely terrible service. Food wasn't good enough to put up with indifference a second time especially after an amazing experience elsewhere last night.To expand on the short review written on my phone: Great idea, poorly executed. We arrived on time for our reservation to be told our table wasn't ready and would be another 15 minutes. We were sent to a packed bar, where people were standing shoulder-to-shoulder. Once our table was ready, it took ages for our server to arrive. When asking about wheat in dishes, I was told to stay away from the bread and pasta dishes (helpful) and when I asked about the fried zucchini blossoms, which I assumed were breaded, I was told she didn't think they were. Aren't servers supposed to know their menus? After checking with the kitchen, she returned to tell me they were breaded.  So in place of that, I ordered the same potato dish my husband had, assuming the portions were small. We received two huge dishes. Why wasn't I advised of that? I would have picked something else. We had enough potatoes to feed three or four tables. I got one club soda--and would have ordered another, proper drink, but our server vanished. My husband's beer glass sat empty. Near the end of our meal, they started closing the roof up--I assumed it was raining. So when she finally came back (first time during the whole meal) and asked if my husband wanted another beer, I asked if it was raining--thinking that we might have coffee and dessert if it was. With an indifferent shrug and ""I don't know"", I asked for our check and we left. Food was fine but I have no intention of returning to Eataly's rooftop restaurant. There are far too many good restaurants with good service in the neighborhood.(Oh, and it's weird to me how few people realize all those plants are plastic.... Tacky.)",1,,
76,Cecila G.,"New York, NY",5,38,8,3.0,6/3/2018,Nothing spectacular about this spot. It's above Eataly which of course has amazing fresh produce and delicious little restaurants downstairs. It doesn't have great views and there isn't a lot of space to enjoy drinks at the bar. Its always so freaking hot up there too. I feel like it doesn't really know what kind of rooftop it wants to be - there is dining on the right filled with families and kids with really great food and then bar can kinda get rowdy and plays loud music. I recommend coming by for a drink or two before going to your main spot or eating there for lunch with co-workers or a client.,1,,
77,Richie R.,"Philadelphia, PA",114,139,15,2.0,6/16/2018,The decor is beautiful. The setting is magnificent. The drinks are refreshing. But the food? Do yourself a favor and don't eat here. This place is great for having a drink before dinner. But the pasta was bland and over cooked and the rest of the items were small and overpriced.,,,
78,Floyd S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,4.0,9/27/2018,"My friend recommended this place, and it ended up being a lot of fun. We ended up sharing a cheese place, an apple salad, some pork, and bread. The food was all tasty (the bread was massive!). She had a frozen rose, and I had a cider which were both delicious! (Hers tasted like an adult slushee). The place was very lively, even on a Thursday night. I appreciated that our waitress didn't try to rush us out. The only cons were it was a lot more closed than I thought a rooftop bar would be. There was wasn't as much of a view as you hope to get when going to a rooftop bar. (The decor was nice - lots of vegetation. There just wasn't really a view). And it was a little loud, so sometimes it got hard for us to have a conversation.",,,
79,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,256,201,3.0,4/27/2018,"Perhaps I'm just not the type of person who is going to love Eataly, apart from the occasional Nutella pastry or gelato. Fiancée and I came here the other night (Wednesday) with reservations. We were early, and seated right away. First off, it is LOUD. Like, can't hear your partner, waiter, or yourself think level of volume. There's no carpeting or anything and it's all enclosed so yeah. No intimate conversations here, folks. It also made ordering awkward. We came on a night where they had a special distiller event, and were offered samples of the three special cocktails they had that night, all made with the distiller's absinthe. The cocktails being priced at $8/ea also made it a nice incentive to order from the specials, as most others started in the upper teens. I had one made with red absinthe and it was very well made and enjoyable. The food was really good for the most part. We had the wagyu beef skewers, fried zucchini blossoms, Otto bread, prosciutto, vegetable tray, and the cheese flight. Overall my favorite were the fried zucchini blossoms. A lot of the cheese served on the tasting was very mild (only one hard cheese, and it was subdued) and there was a ricotta on it as well which I thought was... odd. The thing about it was if we hadn't ordered the bread, we would have had no other way to eat it as the cheese was only served with a small portion of fig compote. The prosciutto lacked the salty flavor I associate with the meat and was more of a fatty/rich taste. Different than expected, but, I did end up buying more downstairs. The wagyu skewers were good but small- though it would be a crime to screw up this beef in my opinion. Some reference of size of items would have helped on the menu (there were two skewers of 3 small pieces each) The vegetable tray was okay- perhaps ordered a little early in the season for good options? The zucchini blossoms I'd order again in a heartbeat, but those were really the only stand out ""wow"" bites I had here. So. Loud. Eataly prices. Good food (some not great though) and crowded. Overall, a place I'm glad I've been to, a unique experience in the area, but not one I feel a need to go back to.",1,,

We ordered the beer battered Piave cheese, the kale salad, and the pumpkin ravioli. The cheese appetizer was amazing...never had anything quite like it. The salad was simple and fresh. The kale was not too wilted but not too crunchy, had beets and feta cheese...flavors complemented each other perfectly! The ravioli was a bit on the small side in terms of portion, but tasted yummy. Service was average...all in all a great lunch on a beautiful day.",1,,
83,Betsy K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,2.0,9/9/2018,"Most disappointing. The quality of the food do not measure up at all. At Eataly we expected much more. This is nothing more than a rip-off joint out to make as much profit as possible without providing much quality at all. The home-made bread was very good, though portion for $6.00 is skimpy. The meat skewers were dried out and all the food was only luke warm. For $16 and more a serving , the pasta dishes were ok, but also not warm. Favs bean appetizer was not well-seasoned. Burrata mozzarella was good, but small for price. Iced tea was good, but no refill though charge was $6.00 per glass. Outrageous. the ambiance calls for far more attention to the quality of the food. this is an embarrassment to NYC restaurants. Are the owners interested in nothing more than making a quick buck?",,,
84,Diane Y.,"Elmont, NY",64,153,545,4.0,10/18/2017,"I came here with two friends on a Saturday not knowing hot big Eately was and I was overwhelmed to hear that there are 7 restaurants. When we heard that there was a rooftop one we figure'd we'd have to wait a bit but we were surprisingly led to a table within 3 minutes of leaving our name! We sat at a table with a nice view of the bar and the raclette station and had the sun shining on us on a warm fall day.  The server was quick at first to take down our order though it was difficult to get his attention when we needed the bill as it got busier around 3/4pm.  We ordered the cheese plate with asiago, ricotta, and gorgonzola as well as a plate of prosciutto, we also tried the steak kebabs and the fried cheese balls.  Everything we had was fresh and the serving amount was great for the three of us to share.  The atmosphere felt upscale and the decor was bright and had the right amount of coverage so that people could still be up there on a rainy day.  I'd love to come back here and have a drink at the bar, it seemed that it was busier than the tables when we got in!",,,1
85,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",155,353,1310,2.0,7/7/2018,"I always like to find the positive in all situations,  so I'll start by highlighting the good parts of our underwhelming experience last night. This rooftop restaurant is very charming with a rustic theme and flowers hanging from the ceiling. Visually it's a very cute place, great spot for pictures! It's located in the rooftop at Eataly, right across from Madison square park so great location. Our server was very nice. So why the 2 stars? Where do I begin, our reservations were for 8pm, we didn't get seated until 8:45 due to our table not being ready. What's the point of taking reservations when you don't honer them. After asking several times about the table, we keep getting the same response that they were cleaning up. At no point was an apology given for the delay. Once the hostess walks us to the table we see that it is still being cleaned, apparently the group that was there moved to our table and we had to wait even more. We quickly discovered the reason why the party moved themselves. There was a ceiling fan blowing straight at us,  think of Beyonce's fan at a concert blowing straight at your face. My poor friend's eyes were burning and turning red from the hurricane like wind. We asked several people if they could  turn off the fan, after about 15 minutes of sitting there beyond uncomfortable the fan was turned off. We ordered the cheese plate and the charcuterie, and the bread with lard. There was no effort put into these plates,  just tiny pieces of tasteless cheese put on the board. Despite the delicious sound of bread with lard, that was also meh. We didn't even bother ordering more food because if you can't even get cheese right there's no point in risking more bland food. The decor is nice but they need to get it together! You can't have bad service,  bland food and a fan blowing in your eyes! Not a pleasant experience!",3,1,1

87,Allie R.,"New York, NY",302,99,19,2.0,8/21/2017,"I honestly wish the other reviews on this page were wrong but they just aren't. Long story short: the service is average at best, it is so loud you can hardly hear the person next to you, the views are nonexistent, and the food is overpriced and under-portioned. When I went to Sabbia, it was raining so the roof was closed. This would have been fine if it was not 200 degrees inside the restaurant. They only have a few fans placed around the restaurant so you would get a little breeze every once in a while, but not often enough to be a comfortable temperature. It also took the hostesses a weirdly long time to seat us even though our whole party was there and there were a ton of empty tables.The drinks were good - no one had anything bad to say - but they were overpriced.We ordered a lot of appetizers because nothing really sounded great as far as the entrees go. So we got a bunch of cheese, the anchovies bruchetta, meats, bread (they provide this with the meal), and some oysters. Everything was fine but nothing was ""wow!"", which was disappointing for the price. We ended up spending over $200 on 4 drinks and some appetizers...seems crazy to me!Overall, the place was FINE. But I was hoping for great. This might be a cool place to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon at, but if you are looking for an all-around enjoyable dinner, there are way better places (probably a ton right around the corner!).",2,,

91,Amit P.,"New York, NY",222,4,0,1.0,7/9/2018,"This place is awful. Get a drink here for the decor but avoid dining here at all costs. This was by far the worst and rudest service I've had in New York. We originally sat down for drinks and appetizers when our server Jessica informed us that if we don't order any food in addition to the bread and charcuterie we'd already ordered we would be asked to leave the table and go to the bar.Fine, no problem. It's a busy day and they want to turnover the table. I get it. However, even after spending over $150 on food where we were still constantly rushed by Jessica, we were just handed the check. We still had full drinks and food left. We hadn't even looked at the check, as we were still working on finishing our food when Jessica came back and tried to collect the check. We informed her we hadn't even looked at it yet. I thought spending $200 at least bought you some time to finish your food. Also upon looking around no one else was being handed their check and most tables also had just ordered drinks and appetizers.

93,Sam S.,"Seymour, IN",110,6,3,1.0,10/20/2018,"I wish I could give this place zero stars because the employees were so rude. First, we put our name in for a table for three and were told we had to wait an hour and fifteen minutes. We took a little bit to walk around on the bottom level, eat something small, and snack. We then decided to go up to the top floor where Serra is located. We walked up to the bar to see if we could get a drink while we waited and a bartender came up to us to assist us. We were really excited to get a drink with cider and then pick if we wanted brandy or bourbon. My friend picked one of the bourbons and she was told they were out. So she thought about picking the other bourbon, but resorted to the brandy. The bartender said, ""I'm going to give you more time to marinate on that because you seem like you can't make a decision and you've made three different decisions in the past minute."" We thought he was joking. He wasn't and walked away. Then we decided to just wait on the couches for the remaining 45 minutes. After waiting forever, we were finally seated and so excited. We planned on getting drinks and desserts for all three of us. The waiter asked if we had questions and I asked for the dessert menu. He said that we had to order dinner because they were too busy right now to just serve drinks and desserts. We offered to buy appetizers too and he said that wouldn't work. So, in the end we were forced to leave unless we purchased a full meal. I have never heard of something like this and will not be returning because of it. If they are going to enforce this type of rule, they need to let customers know ahead of time. Very disappointing!",,,

We were seated at a table in full sun on a 95 degree day when there were other tables all around us that were shaded. The waiter offered no options or suggestions from the menu when we asked for assistance. He just pointed to the only pasta they had left for the day and said ""we're out of the other stuff."" They kept our water filled but never offered anything from the drink menu. For a bar, you would think that offering drinks would be in their best interest. Especially on a hot day. We ordered from the cheese and meat section for an appetizer but he offered no suggestions or descriptions of what we were ordering. He just stared blankly until I told him what I wanted. Once the waiter took our order, we didn't see him again until he brought the check. I don't mind paying $100 for 3 small plates of pasta and an appetizer if the service is good. But the service was exceptionally terrible. I tipped the guy 20% because I'm not a jerk but the poor service made the high prices seem like a slap in the face.

Not only did we have to wait over 90 minutes for a table but the hostesses were extremely rude, dismissing us when we checked in and seating other parties before us. The food was decent but beware of 'small plates' - the pasta dish couldn't have been tinier and at $18 for less than a cup of noodles, it's a joke. Could have bought it from the market downstairs for half the cost. The dessert menu? It's literally four items made from the same two day old custard with different flavors mixed in. The 'tiramisu' didn't even have lady fingers! Don't waste your time or money here. Seems like Eataly has gotten lazy and can't be bothered to offer quality on their roof.",2,1,

98,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,3.0,8/10/2017,"Sabbia is the summer pop-up restaurant at La Birreria, the rooftop beer garden atop Italian food mecca Eataly. In other words, it's an establishment inside of an establishment on top of an establishment, which at the end of the day, is all the same establishment. Hence why I could use my $200 Eataly gift card here, and it being an pricey tourist hot spot, also why I spent entire said gift card, without even trying, on a lovely Saturday lunch and drinks for two.But before we get into what that bought me exactly, allow me to set the stage. Yes, all things Eataly are bound to attract out-of-towners, but New Yorkers aren't immune from rootfop fever and love to flock to haute high altitudes come summertime. However, Sabbia is a rooftop bar without much of a view. Striped, white and yellow awnings hang overhead, which justifiably block diners from the sweltering sun, but also block any kind of skyline vistas in the process.In terms of decor, Sabbia (meaning ""sand"" in Italian) seeks to embody the look and feel of the Old Country's seaside resort towns. Having been to the Amalfi Coast years ago, I can vouch for it being just Epcot-y enough to pass in terms of style and motif, with those aforementioned, on-trend awnings and kitschy signs that say ""Spiaggia Naturista"" and such. But that's where the fantasy stops. Despite its lack of views, you are still on top of a tall building in Manhattan, and sadly not sipping spritzes on the beach.That said, if anything, the food comes closest to transporting you to Southern Italy, as it most definitely should. Here's what we tasted, ranging from Mmm to Meh:Piadina Crudo (DOK Dall'Ava Prosciutto San Daniele & Stracchino, served with Arugula Salad) - Thin, pressed flatbread paired with high quality cuts of meat and cheese, while simple in concept, made for a near-perfect summer sandwich. How I wish this was available at my local Italian deli and not on the 14th floor of Flatiron real estate.Panzanella di Anguria (Watermelon, Housemade Rustico, Cucumber, Mint, Basil & Ricotta Salata) - This was a special when we visited, but a quick check of the menu online suggests this one's been upgraded to regular status. And rightfully so. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and the mix of fruit and big-ass bread chunks hit the spot. This coming from a guy who admittedly couldn't care for watermelon normally.Crispy Potatoes - A self-explanatory side, served with some confusion. We had an allergy at the table and apparently they are cooked in some crustacean-tainted oil, so we opted to pass. Then they were brought out anyway, but the runner told my wife not to eat them. We again said, ""no thanks"". Then, apparently not admitting defeat, they came back to give us boiled potatoes instead, which we were told were safe for both of us to eat, and which we were honestly still pretty damn good. I imagine the crispy kinds are even better.Birreria Flight (Four 4 oz. beers) - Half Italian brews (Birra Del Borgo Enkir and Baladin Nora), half Dogfish Head (SeaQuench and Romantic Chemistry), given their corporate partnership with Eataly, the range of flavors was fairly narrow, and while refreshing, there were no real favorites to come out of the tasting.Polpo Alla Piastra (Seared Octopus with Chickpea, Almonds, Marinated Peppers & Taggiasca Olives) - Maybe I'm just over our eight-legged friend, but this one was a bit unmemorable (but by no mean inedible).Margarita - Meh mostly because I didn't order it. I asked for a Beer-arita (not the Bud Light variety, but Sabbia's special blend of Dogfish Head Namaste, Espolón Reposado, Luxardo Triple Sec, Lime & Honey, with a Chili Rim). And while at first, I thought it was just heavy tequila, light on beer, I quickly realized there was no beer in my drink at all. Womp.You'll have to hop a plane to summer and celebrate Ferragosto the way Italians do, but Sabbia is still worth a quick subway ride for good food al fresco. Of course, having an Eataly gift card helps. Having one with $200 on it is even better.",,,

The temperature difference from outside to on the ""rooftop"" (which was more of a closed in greenhouse) made it hot, muggy, and super sweaty. We couldn't even enjoy our food & drinks as my group of friends wiped sweat from their foreheads trying to position themselves under the couple of fans they had going which did little more than push the hot air around. We finally left because it was unbearably hot up there. We wanted to stay and order more because our beer and apps were fantastic. Sea quench by Dogfish Head was on tap (one of my favorites) and we started with two bruschettas from the ""Bruschetta Bar"" up there. They were both excellent but the real star of the show was the buffala mozzarella... oh my goodness! Fantastic.I heard the roof is retractable so perhaps on a nice day this place would be awesome.

103,Alyssa Y.,"New York, NY",72,256,39,3.0,7/22/2017,"Everybody hating on Sabbia for food clearly doesn't know the point of this rooftop: i.e. for millennials like myself to meet up with friends in the summer and day drink overly sweet frose and average wines/beers. Granted, occasionally that agenda is impeded by a swarm of tourists.If you're looking for good Eataly food, go to the downtown location, which has consistently better food and service in our books.  If you want a sceney, cute rooftop that's not gauche like 230 Fifth and in the vicinity, this may be your best bet (or walk up to Arlo NoMad).",,,

To our dismay, the bartender, James, was extremely arrogant and behaved in a way very unbecoming of the restaurant. I couldn't even order a glass of wine without him giving me a hard time about my lack of intimate knowledge of wine. I don't go to a bar to get an earful about wine, I go to have a drink and relax. Not everyone that goes to a bar is as knowledgeable as a bartender, that's why I'm not a bartender and why I go to bars.",,,

We waited 2 hours for a spot on their cheery rooftop (best part of the whole place), had a cocktail and it was all downhill from there. The chicken dish I ordered was microscopic - 5 tiny bite-sized pieces of chicken served with some olives and tomatoes - the most unassuming and flavorless Italian cuisine I've ever tried. Incredibly disappointing after reading Lidia's (the founder) book. $50+ for perhaps the worst Italian food ever, that left me quite hungry as well- honestly an Olive Garden would have been a significant step up from this place.",,,

Also got a couple slices of prosciutto. Not bad, not great, just ok.For our lunch entrees we got the grilled shrimp which were actually amazing! The shrimp tasted so fresh. The grill definitely gives it more flavor.The octopus was another winner which came with a warm bean salad.  I never knew beans could taste this good and it almost overshadowed the excellent octopus. We also had the orzo salad which tasted great with the octopus. Not sure if I'd come here again. Food was great, but sucks getting stuck sitting at the worst possible table.",2,2,2

Unfortunately we did not and got there around 7 pm so getting a spot at the bar wasn't happening. It was hard to find a spot for the five of us and the waitress was pretty rude to us and saying that we had to sit in chairs not facing each other? Because they didn't want to crowd the space. My coworker complained and they gave us a really nice high top. This is where the experience gets much better - the waitress was super nice and we all got really amazing cocktails. I will say they are pricy but it's a rooftop so go figure. I will say that you don't get much of a view which is a shame...We got an awesome cheese and meat platter which didn't disappoint.

They have this barred cover over the entire area and you can't see a single thing. The food is wonderful though. I will give them that. I had this braised pork with this sweet glaze and these sautéed vegetables. So tender and delicious. The wine was great and the cheese plate with honey for dessert was just as delicious.

Our waiter told us one of the cheeses was ricotta but there was no ricotta in sight. I would've loved to ask about that but the waiter was non-existent. The crispy potatoes were also extremely bland, without even salt, and pasty. The worst part of all was we ordered a bottle of wine which our waiter told us they ran out of. He suggest another bottle but failed to mention that it was 11 dollars more expensive. When we pointed it out to him after the bill came he brought the manager over who rudely asked us what was wrong. When we explained the situation she said ""well, yeah I guess it isn't your job to ask what the price is. But 11 dollars isn't a big deal to me, I can take it off if that's what you want."" The situation and the way it was handled was very unprofessional. Lastly, I don't want to tell the restaurant how to run their business but I can't imagine that turning the lights open and folding up chairs and tables while  customers are still eating is not advisable. Perhaps simply stop seating at closing time? But do not kick out paying customers.",,,

Updated review","Came here for brunch over LDW. This is the rooftop of Eataly. The space itself is super cute and done out wth very summery decor. It felt like we were somewhere else which is alway nice. We weren't seated in the shade and they said they would bring umbrellas but never did - this wasn't a huge issue for me it's a rooftop bar but the table next to me looked like they were going to pass out and were fanning each other with the menus for half the meal. At one point they even fanned me - no complaints there!  We started with the shrimp - really good, well seasoned with lemon zest. You get 4 pieces per order which I thought was decent. We each had the gnocchi. It was light and sauce was delicious. I had a personal carafe of the sorrento spritz - boy that went down well. Fairly sweet and very refreshing - not sure how much alcohol was in that. The Bloody Mary was pretty subpar - watery and neither of us could drink it. The service was a bit slow and the server seemed overwhelmed but overall it was a good experience and I would come back even if just for the ambiance and decor!",1,,1
118,Luke B.,"New York, NY",275,317,1942,3.0,7/11/2016,"La Sabbia is Eataly's rooftop pop up restaurant. Designed for summertime dining in Manhattan, the rooftop is drenched with sun and decked out with Italian beach themed props.  A great spot for drinking Rose or Italian beer, however I found the menu to be a little underwhelming.  I ordered a salad with tuna.  At over $20, it was little more than fresh mixed greens and tuna (seemed to be the canned variety) on a small piece of toast.  My companion ordered chicken, also a little meagre in serving size.   I am a fan of the Eataly concept downstairs (a large market place of fine Italian produce and all things from the Italian kitchen), however found the roof top pop up to be a little Mamma Mia!",2,2,3
119,Mae S.,"Reims, France",0,3,0,2.0,9/18/2018,"Went on a Tuesday night with a large group and was not waited on for 20 minutes after being seated. Finally after we asked other servers twice our waiter came over. We ordered the 5 meats and 5 cheeses each for $25 and the portions were so small, all 7 of us couldn't even get each slice of cheese. It was ridiculous the portions for the prices. For our meals we ordered the small plates and when they say small, they mean it!!!! But for a large price tag. This roof and atmosphere is great, but the service, prices and food are very below average.",,,
120,Joanne K.,"Woodside, NY",381,500,987,2.0,8/9/2017,This place gets an extra star for the waitress. But my god was the food super bland. Better to stay downstairs and have pasta! I think the best thing we had (which is still mediocre) was the chicken thighs. And i would never pay 22 dollars for chicken thighs at a restaurant however my 11 year old son ordered it! I do not recommend,5,5,2
121,Karla A.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,258,315,2.0,8/22/2017,"My friend made reservations for us. We arrived a little after 5:00pm on a Friday afternoon. The night was super muggy and hot. There were impending thunderstorms we were bracing ourselves for. We were seated promptly and quickly realized we would need to pull our hair up cause it was super HOT. The fans didn't help much. We tried the 5 bruschettas, shrimp, steak with arugula and frozen aperol. Everything was pretty tasty. We knew it would be pricey, obvi. But the portions are comical. I probably wouldn't go back to pay so much for so little. You could argue its more quality over quantity but come on.",2,,1
122,Jen B.,"Austin, TX",12,166,108,3.0,4/19/2017,"Tried to go here but was just too packed. Dining was reservation only. We asked how long the wait was and they said unless you have a reservation, can't wait for a table. Bar is first come first serve. It's a tiny bar area. There wasn't any room to stand and have a drink. So we left. One thing I noticed was that the roof is enclosed and it was really HOT! And there isn't much of a view. I didn't try the drinks or the food so maybe not a totally fair review.",,,
123,Isabel S.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,0,2.0,7/25/2018,"my best friend and I went to Eataly for an early dinner to celebrate my birthday. I was so looking forward to visit this restaurants because it was highly recommended by a friend that I met during a trip to Italy. the decoration is amazing ""you feel like you are actually in Italy"" . the food was good ,the drinks was Great, but the service ...... the service was not great. we got Tyler as our waiter and we felt like he was not friendly at all and we felt rushed. he rushed us thru our dessert and when we where ready   to order our coffee he brought us the check without us asking for it. HE TOTALLY RUINED MY EXPECTATIONS. not sure if I would return. Beautiful place but service sucks.",1,,
124,Steph C.,"Houston, TX",273,193,205,2.0,9/26/2017,"One of the few times I didn't look up reviews beforehand, and one of the few times I tipped less than 15% at a restaurant for a good reason.  We came mid afternoon on a Saturday mostly for drinks, but I had the pricey Octopus / Peach / Arugula Salad (pretty and pretty yummy, but again, pretty pricey as wel)l.  What I didn't like was the waiter clearly acting disappointed we didn't order more food.  At $16 a pop for drinks, I think he ciould've learned to contain his displeasure a bit better.  He also forgot a drink order (we were charged for it anyway - removed after I asked), never came back to check on us ONCE after our order, and I had to stop another waiter to ask for water refills on a very hot day. There are TONS of waitstaff and the rooftop was not busy, so the very lacklustre, apathetic service for such an expensive menu was inexcusable.  He only dripped feigned hospitality right before he gave us the bill.  Really, really not worth it unless you have a thing for being ignored.  Cute decor.  That's about it.",,1,
125,Stephanie S.,"Miami, FL",470,416,820,4.0,10/8/2017,"Ate lunch here yesterday with my girlfriends for the first time. We were walking around central park, and had planned to come to Eataly for lunch, not realizing how large it was, or that there are 7 different restaurants within! The moment we heard roof top restaurant, we were sold. We made our way up to the penthouse, and placed or names on the waiting list. We were told about a 20 minute wait, which in essence was great because it was a busy Saturday afternoon. We decided to go to the bathroom to wash our hands. Literally within 2 minutes of being in the bathroom, we received a text that our table was ready. It was great! We were seated at a spacious round table towards the center of the restaurant. Our waiter came over and took our drink order, and then we settled on some small plates. We shared a 3 cheese board, prosciutto, fried cheese curds, and wagyu beef skewers. We were also given bread with fig compote. The 3 cheese we selected were ricotta, gorgonzola, and asiago. The gorgonzola was my favorite. The ricotta was too plain, I wouldn't get it again. The beef was good, not the best. I really enjoyed the cheese and prosciutto. I paired it with a glass of Rosé and it was great. The setting is very pretty, perfect for groups, or even a nice date. I look forward to returning when in the area again.",,,
126,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,2.0,5/21/2016,"I really wanted to like this place. Eataly's rooftop La Birreria recently transformed to an Italian seaside setting and launched a new menu. We tried a few dishes for lunch:BOMBETTEGrilled Bensmiller Farm Pork Shoulder Stuffed with Caciocavallo & Fried RosemaryPOLPO ALLA GRIGLIAGrilled Octopus with Cannellini Beans, Red Onions & Aceto BalsamicoMELANZANE ALLA GRIGLIA Marinated and Grilled Eggplant with Couscous, Roasted Tomatoes, Pine Nuts, Golden Raisins & MintPESCE SPADA ALLA BECCAFICO Grilled Local Swordfish Stuffed with Breadcrumbs, Garlic, Onions, Raisins, Green Olives & Lemon, Smothered in Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Fresh Herbs The dishes sounded amazing but they lacked flavor. The octopus dish had many pieces of octopus and was pleasant. The eggplant and swordfish required olive oil which we added although a little salt could've helped too. The pork was dry and bland. Perhaps if I was looking to just add weight to my stomach I would mind chewing on the food here, but it was a nice day at a new restaurant (Albeit just a new theme by the Batali & Bastianich crew). I've dined at the various establishments at the ground floor of Eataly and at La Birreria before and enjoyed the food.Perhaps the heated section I was sitting in threw off the experience, but my inaugural visit at Sabbia was anything but refreshing. Service by our busboy was excellent.",1,,
127,Jimmi D.,"Littleton, CO",28,87,55,2.0,7/27/2016,"Guys, ok so two stars may be bespoke to my visit but I can't justify more.  The good news - six of us arrived sans reservation at about 7:45 and were immediately sat upstairs (this place is a 14th floor rooftop restaurant).  That was great.  Not so great was our server - she carried a massive air of indifference about her.  No ""welcome.""  No ""how are you?"" - just straight into ""you want tap water?""Oh well - bitchy waitress aside I'm forgivable if the foods good.  Well, the menu is extensively seafood - one gripe about the menu is that the dish descriptions only list general ingredients and leave you wondering what you're going to get if you don't speak Italian.  A good server would help a little.  We ordered the meat and cheese antipasti app - the variety of cheeses and meats were amazing.  But, again, the server did nothing to explain which was which - we could decipher this mostly but didn't want to bother her with our rookie questions.The crown jewel of my two star review was my main course.  I ordered Fusilli Allo Scoglio - seafood pasta with marinara.   The dish was terribly salty - I mean, ""oops I dropped the shaker in your dish"" salty.  It was not good.  The rest of our group ordered steak and one ordered the eggplant dish - they were satisfied although didn't feel their dishes were distinguished.Overall - nice ambience.  Terrible service.  Lackluster food.  Meh - I'm not the first to bitch about their service though.  They need to fix that.",,,
128,Kirsten C.,"Denver, CO",9,169,32,2.0,9/17/2017,"Very disappointing. I previously saw poor reviews but I tried to find a silver lining. Ok, I really just wanted to eat outside on a rooftop. The decor is great - I will give them that. The meats and cheeses were good (but that's not rocket science). Bruschetta arrangements were fine, bit incredibly tasty or unique. I was with three others and they all wanted steak. The waitress suggested that they order the 32 oz ribeye (that wasn't on the menu) for $110 instead of the 8 oz each for $33. They said that made sense. She came back saying they ran out of the 32 oz ribeye but they did have a 39-40 oz they could have for more money (obviously :/ ). To make a long story short, the medium rare steak came out way to medium well. Awful. I had octopus which was good and not salty (which I always enjoy), I recommend coming here for drinks, maybe some apps, but you can skip dinner. Sorry Eataly.",,,
129,Davood S.,"New York, NY",2,5,4,3.0,9/8/2017,"Don't get me wrong- there are a lot of good qualities about Sabbia but also a lot of bad qualities; hence, the 3-star rating.I went on a Friday at 5. The ambience was nice as the atmosphere is light and airy. The decor is a little tacky but cute: think Outback Steakhouse but with repurposed objects that you would find in a small Italian seaside town. Problem- the place there is a lot of tourist-hype so it is extremely packed and loud. Even if you manage to find a table (think 20-30 wait) there's the sense that people are watching waiting and listening to you for the slightest sign that you may soon be leaving, thus making your table available.Then there's the price. You can find 3-5 varieties of wine for under $40 but average is from $80-90 range. The regular menu seemed way overpriced: not expensive but overpriced. We decided to order the oysters. They tasted gritty and metallic and were about $3 each (this was at happy hour time where you can find good quality $1 oysters in Flatiron). The shallot vinaigrette was nothing to write home about. Even the ice melted with 20-30 minutes and it was only 70 degrees (20c) and windy. Since they did not enjoy the oysters about half of our order of 18 oysters were drowned in cold water. Lastly, the service. It was fast but the server gave us a too cool for school attitude. He always looked angry but he was kind of sexy-angry. Thus, we named him ""hate-fucker."" I asked hate-fucker if he thought a table would open up soon (after waiting about 20 minutes)- as not to pester the guests enjoying their drinks. He rolled his eyes and said ""not likely."" Three minutes later... he sends two girls who just strolled in to a table where the patrons were about to leave and so I had to spend about 15-20 minutes, with a thumb up my ass because there's no room to wait for a table, until a new one opened up. Hate-fucker was still very attentive so we gave him a 20% tip. Would I go back? Yes but not frequently and only on a weeknight after 9pm.",,1,

And there are some pop-up rooftop restaurant that you can find, which will be a bit more unique, since it will be available a limited time only. I found a beautiful looking pop-up rooftop restaurant at Eataly. When you reach the rooftop, you are transported to this bright, beautiful, beach-y setting that is just very pretty to look at, and feel happy and fun just being in this space. There are Sunbrellas to give enough shades, fans to keep the air moving, and colorful umbrellas hanging upside down...The waitress was nice, she answered our questions about the menu, nice amount of information and recommendation. We haven't heard too much of a high review on the food that they serve here (or the service on that matter), so we did not come here with high expectation, and we did not come here hungry. LOL.Overall, we had a good time on the rooftop. It was a bit windy, but that didn't bother us too much. our seat had a nice sunbrello, creating cooler, comfortable shade which was great. The service was slow, which we expected. It seemed like they didn't have many servers for the space. I heard our waitress conversing with Italian customers (at the next table) in Italian. I wonder if all the servers speak Italian at Sabbia? That will be a cool touch. The food was small and pricey, again, just as expected. What we didn't expect was that they were all pretty good, we enjoyed everything that we had here. The best thing was their Cannoli Siciliani, this was really great!

I described Eatly as the love child between a museum and an ethnic grocery store. After sharing a lovely 2.5 hr meal (we were not rushed at all), we then walked around Eatly and enjoyed exploring the nooks & crannies. This place is a lovely choice for winter fun.

Not at all. You'll leave aggravated and disappointed. This place is running on brand recognition and not much else.We started at the bar with drinks as we waited for our table. Barely any room to stand in the bar area. For the atmosphere this place tries to promote (reflected in their menu prices as well), why aren't they capping people at the door when the bar gets too crowded? We were told an hour wait for our table and ended up waiting an hour and a half. On top of that, we were 3 people and they decided to give us a 2-person table. Even when the table next to ours left, instead of pushing it over to make adequate room for us, they just sat another couple down! One of my friends is a vegetarian and asked if she could get the bruschette sample platter to be just the vegetarian ones. Apparently the answer here is ""No, because the chef doesn't want to"". W.T.F.Their pasta plates are so pathetically small. My vegetarian friend paid nearly $20 for a dish that was basically noodles and tomatoes... and 4 pieces of cherry tomatoes at that. What a rip off.When I asked for my plate to be boxed up at the end of dinner, the kitchen only gave me half of what was left! What in the world is that?? Luckily the waiter was able to get the kitchen to replace what was thrown out, but still...seriously? This is OK for the Batali empire??We were also charged initially on the bill for focaccia that we ordered but never received. All in all, the money spent on coming here is totally not worth it.

Beware of overzealous bartenders. I got sprayed with watermelon puree all over my shirt (new and white of course) To their credit they were very apologetic and quick to offer to pay for my dry cleaning.

Downstairs, the host was rude about letting us get to the elevator and insisted we wait in line to ensure we had a reservation before going up to the real hostess stand. Annoying, because I had the reservation on my phone as we walked in. When we got upstairs, something was seriously wrong the the air-flow, it was hellishly hot and humid (but it wasn't even this warm outside so...that was an issue) and all of the fans they had on were faced at the employees rather than the guest tables, and only some of them were turned on. It must have been 90 degrees in there despite it being 80 outside. So to beat the heat my sister and I started with the frosé which was so delicious and refreshing! I started with the arugula salad which was lovely on its own, though the option to add chicken would have been great. Next I had the paccheri pasta - large rigatoni-like pasta with fresh roasted cherry tomato, chile, & basil. The pasta flavor was great and SO fresh tasting that I wanted to love it, if not for it being so unbelievably undercooked. This was no al dente, but true gets-stuck-in-your-teeth almost crunchy undercooked. I looked to my sister in law who also ordered it....same issue. At this point we had suffered enough so we ate half and got out of there before we had a heat stroke, but normally I would have sent it back. Come to find out a few weeks later - one of my friends had the same experience and both she and her mom sent theirs back. Gosh, definitely err on the side of slightly overdone than crunchy, my friends. Everyone else enjoyed their meals, mostly salads and panini, and didn't have any similar issues. I'd love to come back if only because it was such a cute little rooftop pop-up I want to give it another chance - maybe I'll just order prosciutto and frosé!",,,
141,Alec M.,"New York, NY",29,21,28,2.0,9/28/2017,"Eataly is awesome! This place isn't... The only reason I gave Sabbia 2 stars is because it's a rooftop and its ambience. Otherwise, this place is overpriced and the food is very underwhelming. You also know a place has a corporate, and unaccommodating service level when the server asks ""does anyone have any food allergies?"" and when you ask if you can add protein to a salad they say ""we can't do any substitutions unfortunately.""We started with the Gamberetti alla Bagnara spiedini. It was literally four shrimp on two skewers that tasted like they had lemon squeezed on them. That's it... For entrees I got the Fusilli alla Scoglio, which was described as ""Local Squid, Gulf Shrimp, Little Neck Clams, Tomato & White Wine."" There was one small piece of squid tentacles, 4 pieces of shrimp, which was one tail that was butterflied and cut into four pieces, and two small clams. I left hungry, when I wasn't that hungry to begin with.My girlfriend got the Insulata Di Rucola, aka a pile of arugula with some shaved cheese and dressing.... $15. We got one drink a piece as well and somehow managed to spend $90 at what felt like a Bahama Breeze on a Manhattan rooftop. I am so disappointed because I had high hopes. That said, either walk down Broadway and you'll pass several restaurants within 5 blocks that will blow this place away. Il Pesce downstairs is also a decent option if you're into seafood.",,,

The day was beautiful and the restaurant's roof was open. We've been here before. We inquired at the desk downstairs in Eataly and were told there was an hour wait. But, we could just go up to the bar, which we did. The bar was packed on this gorgeous Sunday afternoon, but we managed to find some space and order drinks. I got curious and got out the OpenTable app on my phone. The time was 3:45 and they had a 4:00 reservation available. We grabbed it and were seated a few minutes after 4. We waited about 10 minutes before our waiter showed up. His attitude throughout the meal was as if he was doing us a favor by serving us. He disappeared for long periods and his coworkers stepped in to take care of us. They were all quite nice.

For cocktails, we ordered the Salty Bloodhound & Calabrese Sunrise, and they were okay... not too memorable. Honestly, it's a great place to just drink & talk because you want a good pic-worthy rooftop to hang out on during the summer, but if you're looking for exquisite, well-crafted cocktails, this really isn't the place for you.

I went to Birreria for dinner with a girlfriend yesterday and actually contemplated asking for a refund! The food was inedible (Burrata had a terrible aftertaste and was served alone, with no bread or anything else), Meatballs were room temp and looked/tasted days old also served alone with no sauce. Pasta was undercooked (not al dente, but harder and chewy). We ordered three appetizers and 2 entrees. They brought out one app and an incorrect entree. I sent it back, then within minutes they brought the correct entree (which leads me to believe they precook the food and leave it sitting out until someone orders it). My friend's entree eventually arrived with the other two apps. After finishing our terrible meal, the waitstaff left our plates sit in front of us for no less than 25 minutes. They only cleared them after we asked for our check. After we left, we discovered that our waiter charged us both twice! Once for $40 and another time for $75 ($75 was the correct charge). Now I need to call the restaurant and dispute the $40 charge, which is just what I want to do because I have absolutely nothing better to do with my time.

It's close to where I live, centrally located, has lots of great beers/wines, and has a fairly large, nicely laid-out rooftop space. That's kind of just what you want in a casual hangout for post-work drinks and the like. However, just about everything else about Birreria is severely lacking, which is a crying shame.First things first, it gets crazy packed here. The clientele is a mix of out-of-towners, tourists, and people who don't know how to drink anywhere except a rooftop. Yet, you'd think that even for a fairly touristy place, the food would be good since it's on top of a humongous market with great ingredients. However, most of the food we had was about the same quality as you'd find at any pub, perhaps even a little worse, and the portions are deathly small. Oy. That's a shame. Service has always been spotty, and while the servers are more or less friendly, they're far from efficient. It's also strange because the bar area always seems to have reservations, but no one shows up to these tables for hours and hours. The prices aren't good for beers (or the food), but the selection is pretty nice, and they always have a few good beers on tap that are harder to find.You should come here if it's a nice day during not- peak hours, and you aren't interested in eating.",47,34,43

Well, FINALLY someone actually did say ok, and off we went on a lazy Sunday afternoon to Birreria for some drinks and charcuterie, and--unbeknownst to me at the time--disappointment. First off, the bar is always packed--like just ALWAYS. PACKED. Reserve a table if you don't feel like fighting for space at the bar, as if you were in some commonplace, dingy pub. Secondly, the service here is quite slow. We put in our order for some meat & cheese, focaccia, and drinks, letting the server know that we would order more if we needed--he seemed disappointed. The Focaccia was two measly slices for $5, and it wasn't even warm--hard pass. The meat & cheese were all delicious, but would have been better with drinks. Why did we not have drinks? Because our drinks came longgg after all of the food was gone, and we were sitting there for quite some time. Even if we had wanted to order more food, the thought of waiting even longer dissipated that hunger quickly. Our server was nowhere to be found most of the time, and we needed to hunt down a manager to get us our check. This took another 20 mins, and yet another 20 just to pay--we ended up just going to the register ourselves. For a place that is supposed to synonymous with the Eataly name, this definitely did not live up to my long-held expectations. Maybe I'll just stick to buying pasta downstairs.",,1,

Besides that the food was just mediocre and over priced considered the small portions.  I think if you are in New York and want to try it do it, but just expect to pay alot for mediocre food that will leave you hungry because of the small portions.  I will never go back.  It was nice night in New York and a beautiful place, but thats about it.",,,

I was happy that my husband and I made a reservation, even on a Wednesday evening (because we overheard that it was a 45-minute wait otherwise just to get up to the bar!). I was happy with the service, I was pleased with how the place was decorated to give that beach vibe in Manhattan, and, most importantly, I REALLY enjoyed the cocktails. I had a peach plum spritz with lemon juice, and he got the Italian Stallion: both super well-mixed! It's the bombette and the 5 pieces of cheese that, as tasty as they were, I don't know if paying $32 for those two items was necessarily worth it. My bottom line is to give it a shot!

When we arrived the hostess curtly informed us that our reservation was canceled, because we were late. It was 10:32--we were TWO minutes late! No apologies, and the only explanation she gave was that the restaurant was hosting a private event and she was told no customers were allowed up after 10:30. If there was in fact a private event, why were we able to make reservations on OpenTable? And why did the restaurant not contact us to inform us we either had to arrive early or cancel our reservation?It was very frustrating to have made these plans for our big Friday night out only to be turned away upon arrival.

They are currently rebranding the Birreria as Baita (maybe to somehow avoid all the other poor reviews) and so many things were not even available on the menu (including the raclette!).Service: pretty poor, they messed up our orders a couple times, still charged us for everything and then had attitude when we asked for the extra charged items to be removed. We bought a cake FROM eataly for the very purpose of celebrating a birthday with some dessert. We got charged an extra $35 for literally buying the cake FROM EATALY...This is an Eataly restaurant, so the stinginess with that type of thing was really poor.Food: considering this is an Italian restaurant, they should really have gotten some basis right. My pork shoulder was just all right, nothing special, definitely not worth 30 dollars. The kale and beet salad was 95% kale, so they skimped on any other ingredients.

Absolutely beautiful view, and one of the best meals I've ever had. Before our meal, we had also the whole meat platter and cheese platter to share between the table- definitely a nice variety of consistencies in cheeses and tastes of meats (I had thought it couldn't get better from here on out- but I was wrong- the meal was even better!). The steak was cooked perfectly, and I tried the lamb chops which were really freakin great as well. My only complaint is how does a restaurant in Eataly not have several pasta options?!?!?! I was SO confused by this, and disappointed. However, though disappointed, I was at least happy that pasta wasn't there to direct me away from the great meat options they had. Definitely seems like it gets packed, and even though we had a reservation, we didn't get in right away... but I promise, it's worth the wait. Pretty pricey, so I'd probably be back just for occasions. If you are in Eataly and looking for a nice sit-down restaurant (rather than the casual spots they have in the market), this is the place for you.**EDIT - Got to revisit this place years later, just for drinks and apps. Loved the meat and cheese plate once again. I got froze and it was delicious and HUGE!! $17 for the froze but at least the size made it worth it.

The moment we heard roof top restaurant, we were sold. We made our way up to the penthouse, and placed or names on the waiting list. We were told about a 20 minute wait, which in essence was great because it was a busy Saturday afternoon. We decided to go to the bathroom to wash our hands. Literally within 2 minutes of being in the bathroom, we received a text that our table was ready. It was great! We were seated at a spacious round table towards the center of the restaurant. Our waiter came over and took our drink order, and then we settled on some small plates. We shared a 3 cheese board, prosciutto, fried cheese curds, and wagyu beef skewers. We were also given bread with fig compote. The 3 cheese we selected were ricotta, gorgonzola, and asiago. The gorgonzola was my favorite. The ricotta was too plain, I wouldn't get it again.

You go to Eataly for the experience (which I admit is pretty fun), but there are definitely far too many good Italian restaurants in New York for one to waste time here. Our group of six started with a Riesling and the assorted platter of meats. You can get the exact same selection at the Piazza or any of the other restaurants downstairs. I was annoyed that there wasn't an option for both meat and cheese (unlike at the places downstairs), so you have to pay more if you want to get both.For our mains, we almost all opted for the seafood fusilli. Having recently had the fusilli at Marea, I may have had pretty high expectations, but the fusilli here was so plain and mediocre that I could have whipped it up myself at home. There was barely any seafood, the sauce was standard tomato, and the texture of the pasta was not al dente. It was not worth the $21.The rooftop also didn't offer any impressive views, so I'm not sure why I paid a premium to eat here. Next time I come to Eataly, I'll stick to the shops downstairs.",2,,1
173,Josie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,139,266,3.0,9/14/2016,"Good selection of beers on tap, but there are definitely better rooftops. Since this rooftop is fully enclosed, you won't get the open air or panoramic views at every turn that I personally seek out in the summer. Think this spot would be most enjoyable if you're actually getting a meal, otherwise the bar is super crowded and there are no areas with extra seating unless you're eating. Also this is probably the hottest tourist spot in Manhattan, so I tend to avoid. Expect at least an hour wait to be let up.",,,
174,Sarah C.,"Albertson, NY",210,37,59,3.0,9/4/2017,"My friend & I went on a Friday night around 8:00pm. Entrance was within Eataly, and you have to take an elevator to their rooftop bar floor. Ambience was pretty & hip, although there were so many people it did get kind of loud. This is a casual place just with fancy prices, so if you want a nice one-on-one speaking to someone location, this isn't the best... unless you don't mind speaking very loudly. The food was tasty, but not so tasty that the price was worth it. The appetizers and main dishes are not cheap here. The most affordable pasta was $18.00 and it didn't seem so big. I got a Granchio fritto from the appetizer menu & it was very small. For an appetizer costing $22.00, I expected a bit more, but that might be the American talking in me. A Fagioli & Tonno dish was $20.00 (give or take, don't remember) and it really did not have much content. The slices of tuna did not look appetizing, my friend didn't really enjoy the dish, because it was mostly beans. Meanwhile, on the menu it had said quinoa & other things. I wouldn't come here for dinner, but it is a great place for drinks, small bites, and the hip manhattan ambience.",1,,1

176,Tori K.,"Rhinebeck, NY",116,4,0,1.0,8/1/2017,"I would give anything to give 0 stars.Some of the worst customer service I've experienced in my entire life. I wish I were exaggerating, but not even close. Having worked in nearly every position of the restaurant business (hostess, server, bartender, runner, etc.) and having lived in the tri-state area for 30+ years I thought I'd experienced it all. This restaurant is unforgiving and unworkable - having arrived early to my 7pm reservation starving and ready to sit and enjoy a beverage with 3/4 of my reserved party they refused to seat us. Having faced the 'your whole party must be present to be seated' rule an innumerable number of times in my dining life I was ready for them (beyond it being a rule I've NEVER understood. People who sit order and eat... therefore your revenue is higher- therefore your business is better... therefore your clientele is happier, etc. etc.)... I stated numerous times that I would order for the whole table- I would order 4 person's worth of food or they could kick me out. Yet, the manager insisted they wouldn't seat me and that all orders had to be placed at once (even though I reiterated over and over and over again that they WOULD be). I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants in New York... nay, the World,  and I assure you- they let you order whatever you want- whenever you want- yet, Sabbia would only let us order upon seating. So out of exhaustion, we decided to wait at the bar for our 4th party- whom we also informed the front desk would only be joining us for dessert in the first place.  There, we placed our orders for drinks... only 1/3 drink orders were even available ($15 drinks) of course 2 of our desired kegs were tapped and unavailable (at 7pm on a Tuesday).Finally, our 4th party showed and we were seated.... and starving. Immediately upon sitting I asked to place an order for a cheese plate- yet the waiter refused to take my order... further, incomprehensibly insisting that all orders had to be placed at once for the kitchen. I asked the question as to whether, 'what if I remained hungry after ordering and wanted to order more?' I was answered by the waiter- 'We only take orders at once and if you order during the meal it will take an additional hour for your extra courses' At this point , at a total loss for any hope, understanding, or CUSTOMER SERVICE, we proceeded with our order. Mozzarella-bland, focaccia- greasy and not worth the money, the 3 cheese plate- a disgusting rip-off, the arugula salad-decent, and the 5 course bruschetta taster. One of the bruachetta toppings was stone fruit- something my good friend at the table is DEATHLY allergic to- I asked-'may we please replace this with a different bruachetta as she's so allergic'.... having known the answer of. 'NO' before I even finished asking I started laughing. No, even though my friend was deathly allergic- the kitchen and the CHEF refused to replace that ONE particular bruachetta with another. INCOMPREHENSIBLE. I am insulted, appalled, and have never been as upset about a dining experience as wretched, unforgiving, inhospitable, and quite frankly in the end, unenjoyable/un appetizing in my life. Beginning to end this restaurant made everything as difficult, unpleasant, unhelpful as possible. I am beyond passionate about client/customer service-  whether you be a tourist destination or not- people should be treated with respect and care and tonight we were treated like garbage. I wish I could take out a full page add in the NYTimes to express how disappointed, insulted, upset I am with this worst NYC dining experience of my life.",3,,
177,Erica J.,"Lynnwood, WA",173,109,57,4.0,8/15/2015,"We came to Eataly, and specifically Birreria, based on some friends' recommendations. We didn't make reservations and it was a Friday night, so we expected a wait (if we could get in at all). The hostess said it would be a 90 minute wait when we checked in at 8:30 PM. We poked around Eataly--it's amazing--and then got a drink next door while waiting for her to text us when a table opened up. After only 45 minutes we got a text! Score!Birreria is on the 14th floor rooftop of the Eataly building. The view of the lit buildings at night was quite spectacular! We got a carafe of wine from Tuscany and they served bread/olive oil. I ordered Wagyu steak with onions, mushrooms and pea purée. My hubby got the pork shoulder. We also split a side of mashed potatoes that were prepared with olive oil. We both loved our meals and the potatoes were the best!! Absolutely delicious meal!Birreria lost one star just for the service. Our server was very friendly but she seemed to be stretched too thin. It took about 20 minutes to get a drink order going with her, and then we waited much longer to get those drinks. The food came out much faster than we were anticipating, which was good and bad because we wanted to relax and savor our last dinner in NYC. While we were eating, we saw two different couples get up and leave before ordering due to lack of service. We felt bad for them because they chose to walk out on a wonderful meal!I would highly recommend Birreria and Eataly in general!!",,,

The bar area can get a bit crowded raising the temperature of the area. Get ready to stand if you're going for drinks only; chairs are for those eating only. Crowd at the bar ranges from young to old, locals to tourists.Service: Bartenders were friendly and attentive. Don't hesitate to ask for a beer sample if you're torn about what to order.I would love to go back for the food.",1,1,1

Updated review","Bottom line: A good experience as usual here at the newest incarnation of La Birreria. I like the lively bright summer theme. They had very flavorful eats and cocktails as we have come to expect here. Again, there can be a bit of sticker shock if you don't watch out. I'm a fan!The Deets:Sunday found us going up again to the 14th floor of Eataly NYC to enjoy a trip to La Birreria rooftop. Being a fan of the regular/original core format and the past recent colder month iteration of it in Baita at La Birreria, I was intrigued to find they had switch themes now to Sabbia at La Birreria this past weekend. Instead of Baita's winter Italian Alps type of theme, Sabbia is a bright summer beach type of atmosphere. I like the new changes in decor and look...bright, very upbeat and ready for the warmer months. We stopped by for a few drinks and some light eats for a Sunday Funday. Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu selections also. We had good service on our visit this time. You will recognize a lot of the selections on the menu from the original but of course there are some additions to appeal to the theme. We started out with Ferrari sparkling wine cocktails for a Sunday afternoon. My citrus one (Ferrari Brut NV, Lemon, Mint) was a winner with me, outstanding and refreshing but a bit of a sticker shocker at 15 bucks a pop. You got that right...I only had one of those tasty drinks. We opted for a carafe of Berry Bollicine (Serafini & Vidotto Bollicine Rose, Mirto Amaro, Strawberry, Peach, Niasca Mandarinata) to finish out with. To eat, we enjoyed a three cheese board then also ordered the Manzo E Bagna Cauda (Grilled Snake River Wagyu Beef with Seasoned Olive Oil). This one was just like the full entree version of the Wagyu Beef I've had here before, and it did not disappoint, excellent. Definitely a nice afternoon here all in all.",1,,2
181,Karen L.,"Dallas, TX",454,526,3115,4.0,4/8/2015,"The beauty of New York is that you can turn any and every corner to find something great and delicious. In this concrete jungle, you're often bogged down and forget to look up! Well here we are. Top of the building, with Eatly just below, Birreria is a great little secret. This beer garden has plenty for you to choose from. Pair it with a cheese and meat plate. Pick something delicious as your entree and when you're done, go back down to Eatly for some coffee or gelato! The view is nice, who doesn't like a pretty sunset or view of the city that never sleeps?",1,1,2
182,Laurice S.,"Chicago, IL",213,106,224,4.0,3/25/2017,"Long overdue review. This place can get crowded on a weekday after work. Great place for lunch with friends as well. Also, if u decide to come here on a sunny day it can get really warm up there and there are limited tables in the shade. They have a good selection of beers and wines. The cheese boards are delicious and pastas were good.",,,
183,Brielle B.,"Manhattan, NY",591,134,26,5.0,7/11/2016,"This place is an awesome date spot - but make sure you get a reservation. They are hard to come by, even over a week out, for a normal time. We are not too specific, so a 9:00pm reservation on a Saturday night worked just fine.The food is phenomenal - but the portions are generally small, and pretty pricey. That is my only hesitation for the 5-star rating. If you go super hungry, you might be disappointed by the skewered shrimp appetizer, which comes with four medium-sized shrimp. The sardines are delicious, though, so get them!This place is also a seafood-lover's heaven, but it might be a challenge to find enough to eat otherwise. The roof is open, the fans are blowing, the seafood is delicious and the rose is cold. What more can you ask for? I frequent Eataly's restaurants, and Birreria is an excellent summer-time addition.",,,
184,Holly B.,"McClellanville, SC",1,31,77,2.0,5/12/2016,"Surprised and Disappointed. Saw negative responses on Yelp -- thought we'd give it a shot because the space is really fun and had an excellent experience at one of the other eatery corners downstairsOrdered the gnocchi, the quail and the eggplant entree and the olives and the lmozzarella. About to order a glass of wine -- the waiter grabbed the menus and left. Gnocchi was okay but no depth of flavor-- was mostly done by the time we could flag down a waiter for grated cheese. Three fat slices of undercooked flavorless eggplant surrounded by flavorless clumps of cous cous made up the $25 entree. The seared quail was soggy and gamey tasting, the artichoke fava purée underneath proved tasteless as well wasn't sure what it was until I remembered the menu promised artichoke and fava bean so assumed that it was hidden in the purée. Mozzarella was tasty. Olives subtle In flavor. You know the waitstaff knows it's not great when they see 90% leftover quail on the plate and don't ask how your meal was. Usually a sign the establishment doesn't care either. The dishes looked pretty but failed to engage the palette. Feels like the chef set up a summer restaurant concept and then went on an extended vacation--not sure who is watching the quality here.Would be great to hang out and drink-- order a $8 bowl of olives and some cheese maybe, enjoy the sun and sky and the feeling of summer.",1,,

186,R R.,"Red Bank, NJ",9,111,160,4.0,8/22/2016,"I had a late reservation here on Saturday night. We actually checked in at 9 and were seated before our reservation time at 1000. This was my first time to the NYC midtown Eataly. I have to be honest I liked the Chicago one more.As for my restaurant experience I thought it was nice. The decor was fine. The rooftop was ok. It was a crazy humid night and there was no air moving so I was hot. Drinking a bottle of red made me warmer. The wine selection is good. If you are a wineo like me you know you are overpaying for a bottle.Our server was ok. She seemed to get lost and take awhile getting back to us. To be fair it was still packed at 1000 at night. Not sure how many tables she had.The food was excellent.  I won't be able to remember the names but I'll try and describe them. For my app I had grilled shrimp. The were perfectly cooked and delicious. My wife had the pork poppers. They were fried and stuffed with some cheese and chirezo I believe. My brother in law had the oysters on the half shell, also delicious.For an entree I had the pasta with seafood which was very good, my wife had the steak which she enjoyed, my brother in law had the swordfish. He said he'd be back. The food was delicious. I'd most likely go back. Next time I'd check out their new location down town.",,,
187,DarlaUlrich L.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",246,47,21,3.0,5/26/2016,"This restaurant is a pop up. The food is over priced, but the rooftop dining area is amazing for drinks in the summer. We ordered the cheese plate and we were less than impressed. When it is the regular restaurant, we used to come and order the cheese plate and the charcuterie plate. This restaurant was strange. We got our cheese and they were so plain. One of the cheeses was a blue type and was soft, that was good and flavorful with a strong tang taste. The other 4 were hard cheeses and TASTELESS. I can't be anymore literal about that. One of them, I was extremely confused as to why they took a toddlers cheese and sold it to us. It looked and tasted just like a cheese you give a child. No taste whatsoever. The charcuterie plate was really good. They did a nice selection of mortadella, a dry salami, coppa, prosciutto and a couple other nice slices. What a meat plate should consist of. The wine selection is amazing. The rose section had maybe 7 different varieties. Some dry and some sweet. They are in order from sweet to dry. To me, nothing is better than a good rose on a rooftop on a hot day. The decor of this place is really adorable. Very summer style. They drape a thin blanket on your chair to wrap around you for sun protection. They had little signs telling you the direction for different cities. They gave it a nice beach feel. We also ordered these beef skewers which were amazing! Very tender and the flavor was perfect. Again, the portions are very small and the price is insanely high. I wanted to order oysters but $18 for 6, I can find oysters a lot less than $3 an oyster. The service was so-so. I fell like this place usually has that type of service due to the popularity of the rooftop as well as the high tourist volume.",,,1

I made a res on Open Table for 4 even though we were 4 adults and my toddler (they didn't have a res for 5 available). They were very accommodating and gave us one of the 6-top cabanas in the back. Our waitress was nice enough but service was slow. She said the kitchen preferred if we placed our entire order at once rather than putting in our bruschetta order first, which seemed silly to us, but fine. We ordered a shared bottle of the cucumber Spritz and it was delicious. My friend ordered the peach, which she figured for $8 would be a special preparation. Nope, just a peach cut into chunks and put on skewers. And not even a whole peach. And it wasn't even a good peach! We sent it back. The bruschetta was good, as was the bread we requested for the table (not brought automatically as it used to be). My eggplant was delicious but at $25 seemed overpriced. My husband enjoyed the Branzino and thought it was better than the ones he'd had at other restaurants recently. My friend's pasta dish was good but very small. The fior de latte gelato was soupy so we just had two scoops of the chocolate, which was fabulous. It was just a hit or miss meal. The ambiance is great. The drinks are great. Some of the food was great but mostly overpriced. Next time we'll go back to La Pecora Bianca when we're in the mood for an Italian outdoor meal.",,,

Beers are ranging from 7-11 dollars and whatever, it's NYC so let's charge this much.The food is the deal breaker completely. My friend and I ordered the plates of cured meats and it was 25$ for 10 thin slices!! And the meats were not even that great, just average but to charge this much was ridiculous! 12$ would have been overpriced on so little. We also ordered the Wagyu beef skewers which were good but again 10$ for 2 small skewers.The reason I am giving them 2 stars and not 1 is because the manager and the bartender were very nice and gave us our money back on the plate of cured meats. I would most likely never be back there though",6,1,

The colors are bright and inviting and we happened to have a beautiful warm sunny day for sitting outside. I would say it was very sunny and the umbrellas didn't cover enough but my friends and I didn't mind it since the weather was perfect. I had the beer flights and they were all great just would have liked them to be colder, especially since it takes me a while to drink four flights nowadaysThe food was bland and left very little impression. We shared the campania bruschetta, paccheri pasta, crispy potatoes, and the melanzane. I didn't enjoy the flavors of any and felt the pasta was too al dente for me and the eggplant seemed raw. The potatoes were not crispy and had no flavor did I mention they had no ketchup! Never been to a restaurant without ketchup! Would only come back here for drinks on a nice day.

We had our hotel concierge make a reservation and were told we were all set, so we checked in at 6pm for our 6pm reservation. Told they would text us when our table was ready. I checked a half hour later, there were 3 people still in front of us. Ok fine. Another half hour later at 7pm I talked to the manager who told me the person at the desk never should have taken our reservation, and the hotel concierge said it was just for drinks. GREAT, could have maybe told me that AN HOUR AGO? She was not helpful or overly apologetic.  She said she would give us the next table. She sat us about 10 minutes later. Not an offer of a glass of wine considering our table was 70 minutes late, not overly apologetic, she basically laughed it off. Poor management skills, poor organizational skills. It ruined the night. Its a pretty rooftop, but the chaos is not worth it. Food is OK.",,,

They are severely understaffed, it took me about 20 minutes to order 2 drinks at the bar, and when I finally got my drinks the bartender took my card and had to wait another 20 mins to get my card back with 2 extra drinks added to my check! So I had to, again wait for the manager to fix my check! All I wanted was to enjoy a drink after a long day of work. I don't mind paying rooftop prices for my drinks, but not in this place.

I got one of the house Brewer beers which was solid, and our group shared a cheese and meat place as an appetizer. All of the items were Beth tasty, and I would be happy making a whole meal of those apps! I ordered the chicken for my entree which was also very tasty- the skin was nice and crispy and the fregola underneath added a nice element of chewiness to the dish. The only suggestion I have is to add more of some kind of green to the dish? There were little bits of asparagus in the fregola, but I probably could've counted the little bits which probably added up to maybe half an asparagus spear. Overall, Id probably come back here on a sunny day for the ambiance, although I'm more anxious to try all of the yummy things at the restaurants downstairs!",,,

Half our appetizers came after our entrees. The portions are teeny tiny for the $. We had to keep asking for more foccacia bread for the table given how many apps we ordered. No bread was served with cheese and salami plates. A teeny tiny piece of foccacia was served with a fava bean spread. You had to pay for a significant hunk of bread, which came with lardo, olive oil and butter. For these prices, that could have been on the house. Again, the food was tasty and fresh, but because of the awful disorder and the feeling of being ripped-off by the portions, I won't be going back.",,,
