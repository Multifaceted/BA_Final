0,Lindsay R.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",2,5,10,4.0,5/20/2018,"My boyfriend and I came to Luke's last night. We started off with the spicy calamari (easily the best calamari we both have ever tried!). Being from Staten Island that is saying A LOT since we are known for Italian food. The rest of what we ordered was very good right down to our Key-lime Pie which we shared for dessert . Overall, great atmosphere and our waiter was amazing.",,,
1,Jackie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0,1.0,11/11/2018,"A few of us stopped in for a drink after work this weekend. The bartender treated us very poorly, he seemed angry that there were customers there on a Saturday night. He served us our cold drinks in hot glasses, one of which was shattered. When I pointed it out, he simply transferred the drink into a different glass without an apology. Two draft beers and a Tito's ran us $32 which seems high for the casual pub vibe they have. This service may be the worst I've ever experienced.",,,

3,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,4.0,2/20/2017,Really good energy here. Came here after a recommendation to try the burger. This seems like a neighborhood spot attracting patrons of various age groups. Lots of young professionals crowded the bar and saw groups of families and couples  enjoying their meals in the dining section. I got the classic burger medium rare with bacon and avocado - it was very good. And fries were great as well - must've been double fried - crispy just the way I like them.Service was attentive and hospitable. Nice spot - am interested in trying out other dishes (entrées) on the menu,3,,2

Choose something else, seriously...",,,
5,Andrew B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,1,2.0,7/8/2018,"Depressingly disappointing. There is a place for substandard bar food. But when you make crappy food from a bag charge for crappy food from a bag. Don't charge me like you know what you're doing. I mean they try ... I take that back, they put non bar food on the menu, chicken pailliard, chicken francese etc but they prepare it like bar food. The salad is obviously from a bag and the chicken pailliard was so dry it was like leather. The only redeeming items were the the service and the beer, though it was small 8oz instead of a standard 12 but the price was not. They charged as if it were 12.",,1,

From tomato soup that tasted similar to what I eat back at home to amazing apple pie that sometimes is on the specials menu.Whatever you will choose in between you won't be disappointed: fresh salad, great bar food, meaty burgers. You can't go wrong here. Luke and his staff are very friendly and professional.Highly recommend to come by Luke's when you are in this hood.",1,,

Updated review","If it's been a year since I have been to this restaurant. My original review stands. I would like to give it -5 stars. Noisy, very small portions and way too expensive. Tried the fried chicken again, it was mediocre at best. Since the side order of macaroni and cheese that comes with it was exactly 2 tablespoons I decided to order the mashed potatoes. Had to ask for gravy.They were just lukewarm, and though I don't like all the salt that most restaurants put in the food, these had no taste at all!The other thing is they only sell Pepsi products. No Coca-Cola.Definitely not going back. Definitely not recommending it.",,,

The burgers were cooked to perfection, the flavors were very savory and the draft beer selection was great too. Beware: it's pricey for a pub - though maybe not for 3rd Ave (prices do go up as you head toward Madison).... In sum, we'll be back and can recommend it.",,,

Outdoor seating on nice days.Happy with their Soup, Salad, Apps, really very decent all around including service.Try the specials, if nothing jumps out at you have a Burger, they're perfect.

The food we ordered came extremely well done or came other than the way it was asked for, and had to be sent back. The food was disgusting even after it came out the second time. To top off the bad food experience, the waiters ran to kill a cockroach half way through the meal. Spare yourself the time and the money and do not eat at this establishment.

17,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,5/18/2015,"Admittedly, I have an odd first memory of Luke's: The first time I ate here, back in June 2008, it was the night before my scheduled splenectomy, and it was my last meal before I was made NPO for surgery. I remember eating about half of the menu due to this; I just wanted to stuff myself. Ha! Other go-'rounds were much more civilized. Heh.Luke's really is just a good local spot. It's around the corner from an aunt's U.E.S. apartment, so I've visited with her a few times. It's a no frills restaurant with a pretty basic yet delicious menu. I've had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, served with ample avocado and a perfect char grill to it. I've also had the Chicken Salad; upon ordering, I was expecting to be chopped chicken and mayo on a bed of greens. Instead, I received chunks of grilled chicken on a bed of greens with sliced carrots, cucumber, and pickled ginger. Wow! It's both filling and relatively guiltless, at least as far as Sunday afternoon lunches go. Last time I went with my aunt, she got the Turkey Club, which was great, but falls under the category of ""Club Sandwiches That Try To Hard"". No sandwich should stack up to 8 inches tall. Just...keep it simple. Service is great, friendly, and quick. Even as the Sunday afternoon crowd trickled in, service was not affected in the least. In a city full of too many options and menus filled with too much fusion, sometimes the simplest is the best. Burger. Fries. Soda. DONE. Good.",5,1,2

Came in and everyone was at least sixty years old and when we left it was a wannabe club mammogram. Squaky bitches that aren't as hot as they think they are, obvious local trash, and hanger on's trying to get drinks. It's next to a hospital so be prepared for shenanigans.

A word of advice... if you order medium rare burgers, you will get medium rare... more rare than medium. If you are skeeved out by blood on your plate, I'd suggest ordering the burger a little more well done.Probably won't be back for a while only because it's a bit far from where I live.

We found this place on a whim and decided to check it out.When first entering we were greeted by a very friendly waitress.  Since it was half empty ATM we just picked random seats to eat at.  Not really a drinker, but their choices in beverages seemed ideal but my first choice was denied since they ran out, so I settle on a Blue Moon.  The lack of nonalcoholic beverages on the menu was a concern since my dad doesn't drink.  He didn't ask about it and just settled with water.We got calamari for the appetizers.  I'm not a fan on squid, but everyone else loved it so I won't dock it.  I got the classic burger, my dad a buffalo burger, my sister a tuna sale, and her BF some salmon.  I thought the burger was excellent with ground Angus Steak but it was annoying that no sides were included by default and the onions/tomatoes were on the side.  The salmon was cooked perfectly according the the BF; he claims it's hard to prepare seafood without messing up.I wouldn't come back here even if I lived here, mostly since it's hard to justify over $10 burgers.  Maybe on a birthday.  Still it was good service and good food.",1,,

I've been coming to Luke's for the last 5 years. It is a true New York classic. Great bar also. This place is pretty small and gets extremely busy during dinner hours. sometimes the food takes a bit long to come out but it is always worth the wait. My girlfriend and I love the buffalo shrimp appetizer on the bar menu which you can also order at a table. The salad selections are awesome which makes it a good lunch spot also. My favs are the Cobb salad and the Napa salad. Sometimes I go in around 6 PM to avoid the dinner rush and just eat at the bar. Great food overall.

On Saint Patrick's they price gouged 'Coors Light' making it more expensive then some high end bars in New York and they did not know how provide proper service with a packed bar.

Everyone got the turkey burger (as per our server's recommendation) and I got the tuna salad.  The food here is pretty standard and easy.  Nothing very innovative but solid dishes to fill you up.  Everyone raved about the burgers and my tuna salad was a typical tuna salad.  On a Sunday at 3pm, the place was pretty empty and we got a great table outside.I would recommend if you like what I mentioned above.",,,

50,Jessica S.,"Sag Harbor, NY",70,9,0,3.0,12/12/2012,"I've got to say, the inconsistent reviews are pretty much on spot with the inconsistency of this place. I've dined at Lukes every night of the week, and regardless on whether it is a Friday or a Tuesday, it is legit a grab bag on whether or not your order will be correct or your beer will be cold. 7/10 times my food is good; however, the service- overall is pretty bad. From the owner to the servers. The owner hires very young people and the staff changes every 5 seconds which explains why one day I'll have amazing service and the next it'll be the worst service I have ever had in my life. So my advice for you: Throw away all expectations. If you want a good burger- this is def the place to go. It is pricey, but they will make you really whatever burger you desire. If it isn't correct, send it back- but I don't know if you want to risk that ha. Overall, great burger joint. Not too pricey- and with the right company, doesn't matter how long you wait for your food.",2,,1

Updated review","Prices went up, even as they now serve MUCH SMALLER PORTIONS (the cobb salad, chicken sandwich, chicken fingers, steak, brunch), and, really, worse bar service. They just don't have well-trained professional bartenders who look to serve as you enter or watch for empty glasses.   Go to J.G. Melons or anywhere else for a cocktail! -beyond a gin & tonic. They had a good place, now management is cutting back on virtually everything. If you've been there yourself, see if that isn't true for you -and if it is, say something! Finally, I voted with my feet. Their burger remains a redeeming feature. Better than Doc Watson's or Melon's, fair priced. Otherwise, this grill is priced with older,more established people in mind -who may not notice about a 30% increase in their tabs.No credit cards accepted.",1,,

(See photo accompanying this review).  I protested this meager portion to the manager who only offered more for an additional $2. The oil in roasted vegetable sandwich had blotted nearly thru its roll.  The chicken sandwich lacked flavor whatsoever. Even our sodas could have been measured in cc's, they were so puny. Why so stingy?!  They're sodas!!!  Only my Monte Cristo grilled ham, turkey and Swiss sandwich proved palatable. This culinary fiasco totaled $56 sans tip.  Avoid.Luke AlbertsBrooklyn, NY",1,3,1

Then our burgers, salads (chicken Caesar, thanQ very much), fried chicken or the Mike Wallace meatloaf arrive and all is good.And then we go back to slapping ourselves in the head wondering why Luke's doesn't accept credit cards.Eh. It doesn't much matter -- there's a Chase across the street. It's basic, above-average eats in a bar environment with maybe 20 tables from which to choose.

Unfortunately, this is an experience that I wish I had avoided.For starters, I had high hopes for the Caesar salad. I found it to be mediocre at best. The dressing seemed like it came from a can or bottle. The croutons were awful. Note to self: don't order Caesar salad in a bar & grill.The French onion soup was watery and under-seasoned. The cheese was not properly browned. It was more like onion soup with cheese globbed on top - yuck.Worst of all? as an aficionado of Arnold Palmers, I know a good one when I taste it.  This was a horrible excuse for mixing lemonade and tea. and what's with the parfait glass serving? Is that small portion designed to force me to pay each time I get a refill? That's the reality of it. BTW - don't expect anyone to tell you that refills are not gratis.Service was workmanlike - not abysmal but not good. atmosphere is good and this place has a lot of potential.  they just need to get the food, drink and service right and it could be a nice, even classic place.In previous trips the burger has been great.

80,L B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,26,2,1.0,7/5/2012,"Worst poop ever. The only thing that would've actually made this worse is if they had served actual poop.I should've known it was going to be bad because when we walked in there were five old people who looked like props, sitting at the bar. I would've bet they had been there all day and they probably go every single day, essentially making them bar room fixtures. Other than the furniture, no one else was in there. As I said, I should've known.When we looked at the menu, my wife noticed there was a note that said they didn't take credit cards. Uhhhhh...what? Still, we stayed. It was hotter than the devil's butthole outside, and I was tired from walking. My wife ordered ice tea. I ordered run of the mill tap water, but what I got was soapy water. Not visibly soapy, mind you, but there was a distinct soap taste, leading us to believe that the dishwasher didn't rinse properly. Because I'm a chicken and we hadn't gotten our food yet, I didn't want to tell the waitress that my water tasted soapy because 1. I'm sure she wouldn't have believed me and 2. I was quite convinced she'd spit in my food after that because she wouldn't have believed me. So, my hero of a wife ordered a water for herself so I could drink that one, instead. It was only mildly better.Considering we were the only eating customers in the joint, there was an unusually long wait for our food. Of course, it may have just felt unusually long since our waitress decided to stand ten feet away and stare at us. I'm not talking a glance every now and then. I mean, full-on, no blinking stared at us, like slow bus special stared at us. I don't know if she was trying to mind melt us, or if she was just bored, but good god it was unnerving. I'm pretty certain that after our food came, she stood there, staring and counting to 120 before she could race over to ask us how everything was. Then she went back to staring at us from ten feet away. And, mind you, she did this until the end of our meal, when new victims finally came in.We both ordered cheeseburgers ($8.95 for the burger and a buck for the cheese), as well as sides of fries (a whopping $4.95 each). The burger came on one plate with a huge sliced onion and tomato (no lettuce), and the fries came on another.The meat was so flavorless I started to think it would've been better if the waitress had spit in my food. They used zero seasoning, and it's not like the beef itself was good enough to warrant not doing so. But I was saddest about the fries. How do you screw up fries? They LOOKED great: crisp and perfectly brown, slightly glistening from the oil. But they had no flavor whatsoever. I mean, they didn't even taste like potatoes. They may as well have been cardboard fried in oil and plopped on the plate. To give you an idea of how bad this food was, I'll let you in on a not so little secret: I'm a chub. I'll eat pretty much goddamned near anything, but I did not finish those fries. FRIES! And I didn't finish them. They could kick me out of the fat club for that.Our bill came to 35 bucks and change. We spent 35 bucks and change on poop with a side of stalker.",,4,

I went here two days ago with the family and we did not have a good experience. First of all, the prices have gone up. For what you get and the type of atmosphere, I just don't think it's worth it. Second, our waitress was the worst! Not a word was said to us, not ""hello"", nothing. She just came over and put down the menus. It was just weird. After a while, she came over and asked us what we wanted to drink and then left to get them. No small talk at all. She brought us our drinks and we all said ""thank you"" and got no response. She kept going back over to the bar to hang out with the manager (?) and dance in place. Keep in mind we were the ONLY table of people there. She then came over to take our order and just said ""OK"" and reached for the menus. Again, just weird. My husband said ""wow, she has no personality"". I went to the ladies room and when I got back, the manager had seated a couple who came in at the very next table. The man and woman were an older couple and they took a while to take off their coats and get settled. That meant that I was just standing by my table waiting to sit back down because they were literally right next to us! The entire restaurant was empty and they were seated right next to us?!? It made no sense. The food came and the waitress never asked us how it was, did we need anything, etc. We had drinks, appetizers, dinner and the bill was pretty high. When it came time to ask for the check, the waitress came over to the table and put the bill in front of my husband and walked away. No ""thank you"", no ""have a good night"", no ""come again""...NOTHING! I told my husband not to tip her well, just give a standard 15%. I don't know what he ended up leaving her but he usually tips 30%. Stupid woman could have had a better tip if she just gave a rat's behind. As we left, we passed her and again nothing came out of her mouth. My husband said he will never eat there again. From the bill, it appears that the waitresses name is Faryn (WTF??).

My man is SO cultured.We found Luke's after asking two doormen at nearby hotel where we could find a dive bar. They looked blankly at us (There ARE no dive bars in the Upper East Side, Missy!) and told us to keep walking down 79th -- we MIGHT find something a few blocks down. OK. Luke's was close enough -- tables didn't look too fancy, and there were TV's in the front and back.Drinks were a little pricey, but tasty enough. I also ordered fries and a slice of apple pie to keep me entertained while the BF remained engrossed in the game. The fries were soggy, but very nicely potato-y -- obviously, all fries are potato-y, but you could TELL these were once actual potatoes. Nice! I was far less impressed with the cold, uninspired, processed-tasting apple pie. It was tough and the apples were sour.

There is good beer on tap (I stick to the Sierra, though the Warsteiner is nice), a decent array of bottles, and the drinks are well-made. Get there early if there's a Yankees game, as the place fills up. It's not a sports bar, but they support New York teams and have a couple of flatscreens.

They did have an Irish special but I had already tasted a little of corned beef that day and ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich for like $8- and it was pretty solid. Not a huge fan of the sneaky ""Do you want fries with that?"" when it ended up costing about $3 more, but I should have read the menu, I suppose.I think they also had coors lights for $3 or $4, I cannot remember exactly but either way, it was a welcome site. All in all, I was pretty content with my meal and if you're in the area and you want something quick, sure why not. However, bring cash.. they don't take cards because ""it cost too much for them"".

110,Pam A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,4/10/2011,"Just left dinner at Lukes and our current mood is annoyed. Food was fine but not close to impressive, especially considering a chicken sandwich with no side of any kind was $13. Add onto this fact, that credit cards arent accepted - which we were notified of at the end of the meal.  So my mediocre chicken sandwich cost me an additional $6 in ATM fees from the bank across the street (no ATM inside). They charge enough for chicken on a basic grocery store bun to afford credit card processing fees.",3,,
111,Thomas C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,12/16/2012,"After we got the pre drinks, it took 20 minutes before we had to ask the waiter if we could order (!) - then he comes to the table and looks stupid at us. The funny part is that there was probably five or six people at work just talking with each other. Great service, last visit.",,,
112,Food B.,"New York, NY",0,33,1,5.0,1/15/2008,"I've been going here since it opened in the early 90's I believe.  It has always been a consistently good local place.  Good burger, as others have mentioned, as well as salads and brunch.  They are very accomodating with kids when we go, although we tend to order in from there most of the time these days.",3,,1
113,Kathleen S.,"New York, NY",26,409,63,4.0,12/21/2008,"Great place to have in the neighborhood--for delivery and meeting friends for brunch. When I order in, I get the cobb salad which is very yummy and comes fast.  The people who answer the phone are always nice.   Had brunch there today and our waitress was very attentive and the food was great.  Our orders were kind of detailed and specific and it all came out as ordered.   You can see a tv screen with a game on from whereever you're sitting, without it being obtrusive.   Nice clientele and even Santa was sitting at the bar!  Sort of like a very upscale pub, I guess.",2,,
114,Arik C.,"Arlington, MA",194,157,64,4.0,1/15/2007,"Great burger!  Enjoyed a bacon cheese burger that was ordered medium and came out medium rare.  pretty tasty for $7.  Onion rings were the small shredded kind and I wasn't a huge fan but have to go back and try the ""Mike Wallace"" meatloaf.  Turns out Mr. Wallace is a good customer.",1,,1
115,Jay G.,"New York, NY",18,321,359,4.0,2/12/2007,"Casual place with a nice bar. The crowed is a little older late 30's +, but a nice place to have a few drinks and a burger. The meatloaf is good, not as good as mom's...And mike Wallace? i've never seen him...",1,,1
116,Mia-Mia B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,71,0,2.0,12/17/2010,"Food was decent. I had a salad to start which was great. Porkchop was really just okay. Not a lot of flavor (I like mine better). My bf's pulled pork sandwich and fries were good. The bad? cash only. When I told the waiter, woudl be nice to let ppl know, he was snotty and said it's on the front door and on the menu.  Had to run across the street to the Chase ATM and pay a $3 fee. Front door sign? So small and on the second door. Which i didn't' see because the delivery person opened the door and pushed past me to get out. The menu? I definitely didn't see it on there. Waiter was super unfriendly after that. Won't be going back. Cash only irritates me (I'd love to be paid in cash also). Food is definitely expensive enough to warrant a credit card machine.",1,,
117,Ruthy E.,"New York, NY",12,48,1,4.0,1/9/2006,"The first place I had dinner upon moving to NYC!  Nice casual place to go to for a couple of beers and a burger.  The fries are a little too thin for me, but still tasty!  I would get the Bleu Burger over and over again...mmmm!",1,,
118,Michelle B.,"Southampton, NY",0,5,0,4.0,12/3/2011,"Great low key neighborhood spot. Good food, nice staff, food is varied enough, typical burger pub food but with some flair",,,
119,Diana Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/2/2013,"my husband and i thought we'd start the new year off with a quick dinner at one of our local restaurants.   the food is always delicious---specials are interesting and luigi always there to welcome you with a smile----and remembers your name !!!!  you are not going to get a better or more juicy cheeseburger anywhere----simple roast chicken is cooked perfectly and not dried out---waiters go the extra step to make sure you are pleased.  we often see the same diners when we are there, as we locals know a good restaurant when we find one.   portions are good--food is fresh---any problem or complaint is immediately rectified.if you have children they will enjoy the choices for them--my grandchildren come in for sunday brunch from mt. kisco--and they always want ""johnny"" to wait on them!!!luke's is a good solid upper Eastside restaurant---good dollar value, and don't be surprised if you see a yankee baseball player once in awhile!Every night there are salad, fish, and meat specials to round out the menu---if you are in the neighborhood give Luke's a try---you will not be disappointed.",,,
120,Nick L.,"New York, NY",1,3,0,4.0,3/27/2008,"Luuuuuuuke's Bar and Grill. I used to live on east 84th street, and I would come here for my drinking and snacking needs. Its worthy to note that my drinking needs far outweigh my snacking needs, but Luke's delivers on both fronts.         The restaurant itself sports about 20 tables and a bar. Sometimes it gets pretty crowded, but even when it does the staff is always kind and do their best to get you seated as fast as possible. While it is designed like a pub, the food is of a higher caliber than one would find at your average ""we have food too"" bar. But that's expected, it's also a restaurant. I usually stick to the pulled pork and the BLT's, which I think are the two best things on the menu. They also make a nice juicy burger but I'm a sucker for the pork.        The drinks at Luke's are about the same quality and price as your average pub. Which is a good thing. The bartenders are always always always friendly, and will send free drinks to you if you're friendly back.. They don't accept credit cards but they do accept house charges, so if you frequent this place it would be a good idea to set one up.     Bottom line, it's a nice place, good to go with friends, have some beer, some food, and just chill out. Or get wasted. Your call.",,,
