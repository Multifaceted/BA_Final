0,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,10/15/2018,"TL;DR: Come for strong drinks, good/cheap manicures, great comedy.Beauty Bar had been on my radar for a long time and I wanted to check it out for its historic value, but much of what I'd read about this place indicated that other than the vintage dryer chairs, there's not much worth checking out.  On top of that, the consensus seemed to be that service was awful.My friend and I showed up on a Friday around 7:45pm.  It wasn't too crowded at the time, and we were able to quickly get to the front of the bar and purchase our tickets for a manicure and a drink for $10--what a steal!  There were two manicurists on duty at the time, and patrons are called up by order of ticket purchase.  There were a couple of people ahead of us, but we didn't mind waiting since we got to spend the time sipping on our drinks and taking obligatory photos with the dryers.The place is very divey and ironically, there is very little that is beautiful about Beauty Bar.  But the vibe is fun, the crowd is varied and chill, and there is a little bit of something for everyone.  In addition to manicures, they also had comedy in the backroom, and later in the evening, a DJ.  We were here for several hours and were entertained the whole time!I didn't find the service to be as bad as I expected, based on past reviews.  The bartender was an older woman, and she was great; funny and quick with the drinks.  One of the manicurists (short blonde hair) was really friendly.  The other one (I was told she's the manager) was less friendly and engaging, but still not outright rude.  The quality of the manicure was not the best I've had, but for $5, who can complain?  They use professional grade products that are free of a lot of the chemicals you would find in other polish brands.  And it lasts forever!  1.5 weeks later, my nails still look great!",2,,3

Booze selection is not extensive.  Bartender was nice enough.  Music not loud, something modern. Entertainment several nights a week is the big draw.",,,
2,Eli G.,"Grant City, Staten Island, NY",37,12,5,1.0,7/6/2018,"This place is a shit hole that pretends to be a bar that pretends to be a shit hole. They can paint your nails, add soda to a vodka of your choice, and that's pretty much it. Trying to describe it in one word would result in ""dirty"" or ""nasty"" or ""gross"". Cleaning ice making machine is optional.The place smells like mold.I did enjoy mi time though, but who would read to here?",1,1,

There was even a movie playing in the background. A few of us had stopped by out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised with all they were offering. That being said, it is a pretty narrow in the front half and the room in the back provides a bit more space but that's where we ended up watching the comedy show. I really liked the old school hair dryers they had against the wall. Makes for a cute photo. Overall nice place to stop for a while.",1,,
4,Jimmy S.,"New York, NY",15,35,95,3.0,6/16/2018,"My first time at this place and it isn't my type of bar. When I walked into the bar there was guy getting a manicure. That's not something I'm used to seeing at a bar. In the back is the dance floor and it's a 80's vibe. This bar is set up like a salon, hence the name of the bar. Overalll it's an descent bar.",,1,
5,Mandy F.,"New York, NY",1283,84,142,3.0,5/9/2018,"$10 for a ticket to get a manicure AND a drink???? count me in. I came here with a girl friend because we read about this deal on line and wanted to check it out. You really can't beat that price, esp around the east village area. We came in around 6pm on a Friday and it was pretty empty. The place was a bit dark when we walked in, but we were quickly approached by a not so polite worker asking us for ID. like relax, we were still confused if this was the place or not. We looked around and saw the sign that said to purchase manicure tickets at the bar. So we went up to the bar to purchase tickets. The bartender helped other people who came after order first, but we were just like whatever no big deal. She gave us the drink menu and the manicure. The margarita was nice and strong and we sat down at the table waiting for our turn to get our manicure. We waited maybe 20 minutes and was #7 and #8 (walked into the bar when they were calling #4) which is pretty quick. When it was me and my friend's turn, the lady was nice to introduce the colors to me and help me choose between two colors. And then after that, she just never spoke to me again except when I tipped her. So I just expected she wasn't in the mood to speak bc she probably does this all day, until the person that went after me got to her seat and she was laughing and talking to him the whole time. (not a big deal either, but I would def tip more if she was friendlier) It was done in about ten minutes because I didn't need any filing or cutting of my nails. I wish they had a place for me to dry my nails because it got ruined when I went to get another drink. This place is worth the $10 for manicure and a drink, but the service from the busboy, bartender and manicurist is eh.",2,,
6,George B.,"New York, NY",3,113,79,2.0,4/21/2018,Stopped in for a drink after seeing they have happy hour till 10pm.  I decided to go with a rum and coke for 5 bucks and boy was it very water downed .   I don't think I ever had such a water downed  well drink before .    The place was packed with no seats . The back wasn't open so ended up standing and walked right out after finishing the drink .,1,,
7,Jeff N.,"New York, NY",66,14,2,2.0,6/8/2018,How did my favorite 80s dance club turn into generic modern nonsense? Are you kidding beauty bar? You used to play great and classic 80s tunes. Went in recently and it was hardly distinguishable from any other typical bar that plays the top 40s. You have lost your way and I will not be returning.,1,,
8,Meghan M.,"New York, NY",230,37,52,5.0,11/11/2017,"I LOVE BEAUTY BAR! Before I tell you everything about beauty bar that tickles me, just know this place is divey and it only has regular nail polish not gel (though it does use a high quality brand). Beauty bar just won't be the best mani you have ever gotten since there aren't upgrades.All that being said, this place is a blast. For $10 you can get a mani and a cocktail or glass of wine or beer. I did the martini, which in my opinion was no frills but delicious. Pretty dry and strong which is how I like them. Just remember that in addition to the $10 you need to tip the bartender and manicurist and I personally believe that each needs at minimum a full $3 tip so don't be jerks. I waited around 40 minutes to get a mani, there's only one manicurist, so don't come here if you're in a rush. The decor is fun as well- glitter old-fashioned signs, pink and blue neon lights, and old hairdryers. It was a beauty parlor for 40 years and a bar for 35. It's a little 60's nostalgic in the sense that the bartender and manicurist will give you a little bit of diner sass, but not to the point that it's bad service-- and honestly, if you're from NY you might not even notice.",2,,
9,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,3.0,6/19/2018,"A decent bar. There's the beauty aspect where people get manicures while drinking? But I bypassed all of that to go dance. Toward the rear of the building is a room in which the DJ primarily plays hits of the 80s, mixing 90s and 00s songs in. It's a pretty cool setup and the aesthetics paying homage to a vintage hair salon. My friends and I were entertained most of the night and the drinks were reasonably priced. Probably my only complaint is how sticky the dance floor can become when multiple drinks have been dropped - all by accident of course - and the house mop they use to clean it up seems to make matters worse. Aside from that a good time if you're feeling nostalgic about the 80s or if you just want something different.",,,
10,Jessica N.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",327,69,126,3.0,4/19/2018,Went there for a party and it wasn't bad. I can only rate the drink and bar service since we didn't get food from the actual location. The drinks were okay. I don't think it was mixed the right way since I usually get my usuals. The bartender was very nice and was willing to try his best to make the drinks I had asked for. In the front it was very crowded and no one knew if there was a party going on at the location or not. I think there needs to be some kind of communication so people that are part of the party are aware that they are in the correct location. Overall it was okay for drinks and service was nice.,1,,
11,Maria V.,"New York, NY",23,17,15,4.0,12/8/2017,Cool place.. despite a lot of the reviews I read about the staff being nasty I had a great experience- the bartenders and manicurists were friendly. Music was great and drinks yummy Nails were done well for only $10 for a cocktail and mani (excluding tip) ...only thing is the polish dried with bumpy air bubbles in it so maybe they need to upgrade polish brand?,,,

We've been to Beauty Bar a handful of times, typically on the weekend, but we were in the area and wanted to check out their happy hour specials.Almost immediately after walking in and putting our stuff down (the bar was empty) the bartender started barking off demands to see all of our IDs. We're all the appropriate age and supplying our IDs isn't a problem, but why are you yelling when we've just walked in?He snatched them from us and used a flashlight on them (as if we're all teenagers attempting to sneak in for a beer on a school night???) and started taking our orders very unhappily once he realized.... we were legal.While one of us was ordering he'd walk away mid-sentence. When I ordered he interrupted me to yell ""WHERE IS MY TIP?"" I don't know if this man has a Napoleon Complex or was doing an impression of his doppelgänger, the Chuckie doll, but his attitude is very aggressive and weird. The majority of my group refused to tip him for making us feel unwelcome. I've worked in the service industry and my guilt forced me to give him a dollar he did not deserve.Also the drinks sucked.",7,3,

Wasn't that funny. Should really just be two stars, but the extra star is for originality.

17,Jessica B.,"Huntington, NY",101,130,113,5.0,6/21/2017,"This is my favorite bar in New York City, or really in the whole wide world.  I'm not your typical club going young adult.  I'm not really into your typical club scene.  This place is different.  It has a great vibe for a number of reasons.  First, I think the bar prices are reasonable for Lower East Side Manhattan.  There are no great happy hour prices that I know of, but I think their fair.  They have a fun Martini and a Manicure deal (I think it's $20), which is pretty cool, too.  My favorite part about this club is the music.  At 11 the dance floor opens and you're literally taken through the decades.  There are very few clubs that I know of that play everything from the 60's to contemporary music (especially contemporary rock).  It's my favorite place to sing and dance all night long.  Be warned, the dance floor gets REALLY crowded (and sometimes a little sweaty and smelly), which might not be for everyone.",3,,

You don't go there for the drinks, the cleanliness or the decor specifically but its beyond AWESOME to see such a strong-female establishment. There are pics of Rosie the Riveter and the like, all the bartenders are female and it was apparent to me that the space welcomed everybody regardless of your preferences, clothing choices etc. which was very pleasing.I don't know how they make money at this place - for $10 you get a yummy drink (and you can pick what you want) + a manicure. It's not a fancy manicure but they did cut and paint my nails and do my cuticles and whatnot. Heck, there are places where you can't even get a drink for $10 let alone all this.

Got my nails done for $10 w a free drink (cocktail,beer, or wine).Place is unique with a rock style vibe to it. It was Friday night so it was comedy night! Some of the comedians were funny especially the Indian female (girls were funnier than the guys). The place received a 4star because of the service. Bartender was great but the manicurist on the other hand, could've been friendlier and welcoming! Although we had a conversation (mainly sparked by me), I felt as though she was tired and annoyed and therefore came off as displaying a bitchy attitude. The place is worth visiting if you want to enjoy and have the experience but I will not be returning despite the fabulous $10 deal of a manicure and a drink.",1,,1

She barely said hello before grabbing me kind of abruptly and made no pleasantries; just chatted with the person next to her the whole time. At one point I thought she'd said something to me and I asked her if she did. She acted appalled that I dare interrupt her conversation. My nails turned out nice but she was kind of intense on my hands; then when she was done she pasted on this 1000-watt smile expectantly, as though saying, ""you're going to give me a big tip now, right?""

Before 9 you can get a $10 manicure that comes with a drink--what a deal!  I knocked off a star because the bartenders are a tad rude as other yelpers have mentioned. We gave one of them our order three times before they finally remembered that we had already ordered and we're waiting for drinks. However not off putting enough to ruin the experience.

I honestly love the concept of this place with the retro vibe; however, I had the worst experience here. So there was a free comedy show taking place in the back room and the so called comedian was extremely rude and racist. He called me a Trump supporter when I was asking him where he was from. I was asking because I was genuinely curious to where he was from. Is that a racist question to ask? I understand that in comedy shows, the comedian wants to shine and not have any interruptions but he was extremely rude. My boyfriend also bought each of us a ticket to get manicures with was $10 each that came with a beer; however, the manicures were horrible and the girls who did our nails were rude as well. I don't understand why people even come here with the rude service but I'm warning you, do not come here if you want to experience good vibes. Definitely not worth your time.",4,1,1

It was Friday so the wait for the manicure was an hour and half. I didn't mind since we were going to be drinking and chatting anyway.They had a DJ that played cool music and the time flew. Beware they don't announce the numbers so pay attention to what number they are up so you don't miss out on your manicure.The manicure its the greatest its more of a polish change but I'm not complaining they did a great job and I really enjoyed my drinks.After we got the manicure we ventured to the back where they had live stand up comedy. The comedians were a hit or miss but again it was free so I'm not complaining.Overall I had a great time and this is a great place for cheap drinks, cheap manicure and to spend some amazing time with your girlfriends.",10,5,7

(literally - they actually have a woman doing manicures, and when we were there a girl was getting her nails done).The drinks go with the theme, too - Shampoo, Red Head, Platinum Blonde (me!), and Hot Pink, for instance. Those are the ones we got and all were good. The red head one tasted sweet and delicious, the shampoo one was okay, platinum blonde was again delicious, and hot pink tasted pretty good but it was sweet and didn't seem to have much alcohol. Then again, none of the drinks seemed to - guess that's what you expect from girly drinks at a beauty bar ;) so we got jager after that and were all set.Place gets pretty crowded, interestingly enough around 1am even more than midnight. Crowd is white average-looking young, I'd say. So above average looking if you factor in the young part. Supposedly it's supposed to cater to a gay crowd but I didn't really see that. Decently hipster, though not as much as other places in the East Village or LES.And finally, dance floor - people get wild, and no cares are given!

I waited about 10 minutes, the manicure itself was pretty quick.-No nail driers. You gotta kinda sit around and air dry them. But you'll forget, because you're probably already tipsy. Damn that free drink!Service is hit or miss. The first bartender was super down to earth and friendly; a shift change brought two crass barkeeps.Two single bathrooms, and the line can get long. $25 credit card minimum. Ambiance is sparkly.

Yeah, that set the tone for me. And through the years the place has changed, but one thing for sure, it is almost always a fun time.

I really only go on Friday or Saturday nights after they've opened up the dance floor (after 11PM). Don't worry about the late start--if you're anything like me, you'll be staying here until they close at 4AM! It is so easy to get swept up in the endless jams! The most recent song I ever heard played at Beauty Bar was ""Mr. Brightside"" by The Killers. It's mostly tunes from the '80s, in my experience, with some '70s disco, Motown hits, and alternative '90s thrown into the mix. I absolutely love it. However, I would not recommend coming here every weekend (as I so ambitiously tried to one month) because the playlist gets repetitive. You WILL hear most of the same songs here, which is great when you're in the mood for those songs. This is the perfect place to come with a group of friends. If you're in a pack of three or less, it's easy to get swallowed up into the crowd. The dance floor is small and crowded, but if you get there early enough, you can really secure yourself a good corner. Drinks are perfectly acceptable, for the kind of price you expect in NYC, so nothing new there. You'll definitely want to drop by the dance floor at least once in your life. I will certainly be back someday for the $10 drink and manicure special.",1,1,1

A few folks meandered outside gaping inside but doubtful. However, I'm so glad my awesome company for the evening led me here. The back area was closed while we were there but the front space was more than suitable for us.  (I also love this place because the bartenders carded me-- YES!!!!)Their signature Cocktails are varied and aplenty. But of course, they have your Standard concoctions as well. Place was clean and had an eye catching decor that was almost as interesting as the crowd and bar staff. If you dont like tattoos--- dont come here. Having said that, they wont judge you but you will have to leave your ID to start a tab. They serve peanuts, goldfish and other snacks throughout the bar. There are enough good food options in the area for them to forgo serving meals.Crowd is unique and full of individuality-- but most importantly friendly!! No pretentious suits or uptight jerks to be found here. Definitely no B&T crowds here either. Happy Hour is almost all day long and almost all drinks range from $5-10. Cant beat that. They have a cocktail & manicure special for $10 which was perfect to spruce up my chipped manicure. Rachel the manicurist is a darling who did an awesome job. Not sure why others had issues with the manicure--mine is still on point three days later.Bathrooms were small but adequate and very clean.  It doesnt compare to a fine restaurant but it gets the job done. I will definitely be returning, no doubt about that. I Reserve my 5th Star for when I get to see what that back spot's got.",12,10,9

I have always kept that in the back of my mind every time I've come back to this bar.Last night I was  here on a date, and having never gotten up from my seat, with my bag at my feet the entire night, somehow my phone and wallet were both stolen out of my bag. The manager helped me track my phone and it was still in the bar, but he refused to make any sort of announcement and actually snapped at me that he couldn't search people.When I got home, my credit cards were charged with around $900 worth of charges at Duane Reade, Walgreens, and CVS. If you want to listen to loud music while you get light headed from chemical fumes, I suggest you keep anything valuable in your underpants.

The place looks like a dive bar but cooler. Seats look like hair dryer stations on one side and bar on the other side. They have a special mani and martini for $10.00 (well drinks) specialty drinks add $2. Who can beat that price? Bree was our manicurist and she was so awesome! Very sweet and very interesting to talk to. She did and awesome job with my manicure! Who doesn't need a drink while your nails are getting done? In the back there is a small room where there is a dance area with DJ. The night we went, which was Monday, they happen to have a burlesque show going on. Met some great people from the area and even had a dance competition with one of them LA vs NY, ha. We both one drink tickets.  The show itself was awesome and afterwards my cousin and I danced for a bit before we had our last drink and headed back to the hotel as it was our last official night in NY. Drinks are cheap and they have great happy hour specials and the locals are not snobby. Highly recommend to anyone visiting NY to add to their bucket list. A word of warning, we came to the Beauty Bar on Saturday and you couldn't even walk around it was so crowded. They had 3 manicurist but the wait was 30 min just to get a manicure. Granted we got there about 8:30ish. So if you are going to visit the Beauty Bar on a Saturday night, I recommend you go early and get your spot. The decor seems like something straight out of the 70's but it was so awesome and original and I love places like that.  Just a heads up, careful with your credit card, they will ask you how much you want to tip before they run you card. This can be a problem if you are a bit, you know tipsy.",1,,

Last night when I visited the bar I saw him again and confronted him about his shitty behavior. He to my surprise admitted what he had done and was unrepentant. The bouncer and the manager got angry at me and my boyfriend for confronting him and took us out of the bar. We tried to explain to him what happened but the manager would not listen and told us that I couldn't report something that happened a month ago. To our dismay the manager told us he knew the guy who shoved me for 20 years and he was a regular so instead of taking my concern seriously he backed up his friend.

It was a great place to see a different type of bar and talk with all the fun people there. The venue is a bit on the smaller side but you can definitely make your own dance floor.

They had a comedy show in the back which ended right when we got there but then they converted the room to a dance floor. They played a little of everything from each era, 50s-2000s.

Now, this is not one of those places where they will do crazy acrylics or pedicures or anything. It is your basic file and polish, but they do a good job and the price can't be beat! In the front they also have a bar and some table areas set up by the wall with retro hair dryers (great photo opp!). And by party in the back, there is a bar and a DJ and the whole place just turns into a dance floor where they play all the retro hits you know by heart.

Unfortunately, my night took a sudden turn as soon as I came upon Beauty Bar.  As I approached the bar and snagged two gin and tonic's that my friend had bought for me and himself, I was immediately escorted out of the bar. Every time I attempted to calmly explain that I had simply grabbed drinks that I thought were mine, I was told that I ""stole"" them and that the bartender was not allowing me back in the bar. I repeatedly explained that I would pay for the drinks if I had made a mistake (although my friend had already paid for them, as he tried to explain to the bartender and bouncer) and was met with rudeness and threats. Furthermore, my friend had to fight to be allowed to bring my jacket out to me as I was standing outside in subfreezing temperatures.Here's the bottom line: Beauty Bar is an overpriced, shady establishment to begin with with little to offer in any regard. There's not much reason to come here in the first place but the point at which they treat their customers without respect is where I draw the line. If you like being abused and mistreated, well then Beauty Bar is the place for you!

Kind of a funky cool retro decor as you feel as if you are partying inside a throwback beauty salon from the 60's-70's. Those daring enough were actually getting their nails manicured here - in the dark. WTF?Hey, there is a DJ spinning cool R&B and rock tunes from the 60's so that was all right. Plus, the drinks here are pretty cheap overall, as our two pints of beer were only $5 each. Hey, it was a PBR and a Blue Moon, but what the heck. Bartenders seemed nice enough too.Decent amount of spots to sit in around the bar, with a bunch of seats under hair dryers that you can picture the girls of the Brady Bunch sitting under. Large back room area also that was closed the night we came here. We were there around 8:00 and it was not too crowded but getting there. We were able to score a few spots under the hair dryer and chill out for a bit. Beauty Bar has a fun laid back vibe. Cool gimmick, but my girl had to notice and proclaim - ""Why do all the other guys in this place look really effeminate? Even those with girlfriends look like a chromosome away from being a women.""  Bwahahaha!",10,9,8

The clientele is a bazaar melting pot of people, varying age ranges as well as types of people. It's hard to explain but I have the best time when I come here. The drink prices are fair. I don't really care for the smell of nail polish but manicures is part of what makes them the beauty bar so I can forgive. It also fades quickly once they wrap up. The bathrooms are gross but that is to be expected. Overall I love this place and I go any chance I get (which isn't often but when I go it's always memorable!!).",,,

Updated review","Had an amazing time here on a Friday night. Beauty Bar is one of those places that pulls off an inspired idea. When you walk in, there is a bar to one side, but an old fashioned salon on the other. Old style chairs and a couple nail polish counters (where people can get glitter face paint applied) are against the walls along with a few sofas. While the place as a whole takes a while to heat up, it is worth the money wait. Arriving at around 10, the back dance floor was still closed off, but it was opened shortly after, as more college-aged people arrived. While there were a few older people around, this is definitely a younger crowd. What makes this bar special, however, is the fact that they only play oldies. The DJ wasn't afraid to mix it up, he played everything from the Beatles to Joan Jett to Fall Out Boy. The bargoers are for the most part highly energetic and the vibe reflects that. My only complaint is that the alcohol is far too expensive for the kind of atmosphere they are trying to project. $7 beers and $20 minimums for credit and debit cards pretty much ensure that everyone there only buys one drink, if any at all.",,,
85,Marjorie S.,"New Lots, Brooklyn, NY",11,46,30,5.0,12/20/2016,Not the fanciest place but guaranteed to have a good time. Manicure and a drink for $10. Have to say that my manicure lasted almost two weeks. They have a comedy show too. Not to impressed. Will definitely come back. Like the vibe,,,
86,Angie H.,"Irving, TX",24,35,10,3.0,6/17/2015,"The manicure is nothing special, not quality nail polish, bubbles up for some odd reason like you showered right after painting your nails. Tried it twice, both times had to remove it the next day.I mean what was I expecting? $10+ tips for a drink and perfection. Let's be real. Saw the comedy show it was good, interesting crowd. You'll see.",1,3,
87,Marisa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,612,638,5.0,12/30/2013,"I have been coming here for near 10 years and it is fairly reliable. They have some manicure tables up front but the smell of the nail products isn't really a problem. PBR on tap, full bar, nothing fancy but very fun decor. The back room has pink sparkly walls and dancing some days. Otherwise there is still a DJ in front, and they card before you get in. It can get crowded in the front, and unless the back is open there are only 2 unisex bathrooms. It's a pretty unique place so if you haven't been its worth checking out, because this is the original. Beauty Bars are supposed to have taken over spaces that were formerly actual beauty salons, complete with the salon chairs and this one has really cool novelty beauty products scattered around. Before I ever came here I thought it would be...'girly'? if that makes sense, but its just a regular cool bar where you could potentially get a drink AND get your nails done, drink decent priced booze and if you are lucky get some dancing in...and Happy Hour til 9!",1,,1

90,Juliette J.,"Fort Lee, NJ",348,397,502,4.0,8/13/2011,"Came here on a Friday night with 4 grown ass men who had no idea how to react to this 'girly' nail salon slash bar.  They all gave me that 'we should effin leave' look, but I straight up ignored those fools, bee-lined to the bar and ordered the first round of drinks. 1 gin and tonic. 1 vodka pineapple. 3 beers. $18. Yes, one - eight.  5 drinks for $18. Three rounds later, said men were as down as they'd ever be to get their nails did. Mmmm hmmm. The smell of nail polish + whatever incense they have burning to combat the nail polish smell can be a bit nauseating at first, but that becomes a non-issue after a couple rounds of ridiculously CHEAP drinks.  And the 40's style music can be a bit blah, but it adds to the charm.Hunger started to ninja chop the ish out of stomachs so decided to leave and missed the chance to hook up our nails. Next time. Yep, there definitely will be a next time.   Go here for happy hour [5 - 9p] with your peeps, chat it up, get sauced, get your nails did, then move on to another spot if you're in the mood to shake your tailfeather. Definitely a great place to start the night.",1,4,2
91,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,3.0,7/1/2013,"$10 for martinis and a manicure. Get your nails did. Sip on a martini. Beauty Bar is one of those strange yet oh so interesting retro-inspired bars that are worth a visit. The first time I came across Beauty Bar, I wondered, what's in the name, and it turns out it's literally a beauty bar -- Or rather, let's call it the ""beauty saloon"". A bright neon chalked sign boldly advertising specials including a free comedy show for the evening was enough to convince myself to check into this rather unique but not so bad happy-hour joint. If your olefactory senses are super-sensitive, then you might immediately be deterred the pungent aroma of nail polish lingering in the air. Surely, it will pass over within minutes, but just be warned. Girls, you can get your nails done here while sipping on a cocktail -- a special of $10 for martini + manicure is well-promoted. The crowd of this place on a not-so-late Thursday night was lively and happening, a mix of young and old, guys and gals. I actually didn't get my nails done, but immediately hit up the bar for the beer special -- $3 for beers and $4 for well drinks -- not too bad at all for happy hour. They have PBRs on draft for about $3, which is pretty good for this part of Manhattan. The place itself has an interesting spin on a salon shop plus bar. They take retro 50s/60s elements of the hair and nail salon, and combine it with a bit of a divey lounge vibe. The very back of the bar has a dance floor with disco ball and all, but the night I was here, they were doing a stand-up comedy show for free in that area. Overall, Beauty Bar is a pretty fun, neat bar, and if you're looking for a more interesting, unique venue to kick back with some drinks, then this place is a viable option for happy hour.",3,,1
92,Danielle C.,"New York, NY",1,9,0,5.0,6/6/2016,"Highly recommend hosting a private party here! We rented the back room with the dance floor, DJ booth, and bar. The pink sparkly walls and 80s themed decor give a great vibe to a party. Oh, did I mention the open bar? That definitely added to the ""great vibe."" Hosted the event for an hour prior to the room opening up to the public, so it felt like the party continued all night long.

93,Andrew B.,"Washington, DC",997,7,0,2.0,12/28/2016,"The Beauty Bar is a fabulous concept, with an amazing lineup of drink specials and wonderful ladies who will rock your nails out. However, for my first experience, I could not have been more let down. I understand bartenders can get overwhelmed, and that there is a time to fraternize with them and mingle, and then there is a time to order your drink and be direct to the point with what you want. I came in for a college reunion, my two friends and I ordered drinks, and the bartender could not have been more rude, condescending, arrogant, and just plain old mean - literally, in the three continents I have ordered drinks on, I have never met a more unpleasant human being behind a bar. I write poetry, it's what I do, and at one point I was sitting by myself, away from all of my friends taking a minute to think and write a haiku on a napkin about whether there was something I did to have caused this man's superfluous emotional reckoning to be taken out on me. He straight up grabs it from me and throws it away. Then my friend sees what happens, confronts him, and then writes ""you're shitty"" on a napkin and says how about you throw that away. He then says loudly and aggressively, in a not so crowded bar, ""okay, so now you're insulting the bartender, you all CAN LEAVE!"" And then proceeds to call the bouncer over. Say what?! I have never been even close to being asked to leave any establishment, let alone a bar that has 10-15 people in it. I went straight up to the owner, who was also the DJ, and told him about this experience, the only thing he offered was an apology and said that this was so unlike his bartender. Trust me when I say, my nails look okay, but I will never ever recommend this place to anybody that has a heart or kind soul, it was truly and honestly one of the worst experiences I've had at any bar in over 19 countries; so much so that this is the only time I've felt the need to leave a review on Yelp. I hope this bar, and this bartender, find the joy that they are seeking, because they certainly won't be taking mine anytime soon.",5,,

It was too late to take advantage of their $10 martini and manicure, but even at 10:30 PM, the venue was popping.  There were heaps of people both inside and out, making it very difficult to walk from one end of the bar to the other. I wish I could remember the type of music they were playing... I just remember it being loud enough to drown out conversations that other people were having around me. It's a great concept with the salon chairs, drying stations, and 80's decor; and best of all, it makes for great photo opportunities. But, why does it wreak of body odor? It's so incredibly stuffy and stinky at Beauty Bar, that 5 minutes in, I had to walk out. Or I was going to have to be carried out on a stretcher. Also, the bartenders are douches. They aren't even hot. Inexcusable! And the crowd is very downtown- lots of tattoos and facial hair.",3,1,3

Then the bartender was extremely & unnecessarily rude to me when I was asking about when we would be going, because what I was told on the phone was different than from what this guy was saying. So rude to the point where I almost walked out. Thankfully Rachel was able to work something out and got a third person to do our party due to the bartender overselling tickets that night when a large party was coming in at 10.

One in particular was a bit rude and seemed annoyed by asking for a suggestion from their martini list. Fine. I skipped it and went with my regular. Music was fun but the place started to get packed. Where you really couldn't move and you're getting bumped around. I got my drink and the glass was sticky. I kept it. I was so excited at the option to get a free mani with my drink so I bought a ticket and waited. Which was really no problem since we were hanging out. My number got called and I sat down in the retro seating with the friendly manicurist. I chose my color. She put on a base coat. Slapped on the polish. Then finished with a top coat. I was cringing as she was doing it. She got it all over my skin and cuticles and relied on a wooden stick to wipe it off. This was no manicure by a pro. It was like having 1 of your girlfriends paint your nails at a 12yr olds slumber party. Gross. I swore I'd take it off the next day but just didn't have a chance and noticed it had already started chipping before Monday. Don't come here for the mani's, that's for sure. FOR MENThis is a great place cause it's 85% women so I'm sure you could strike up some conversation + there was a bachelorette and I'm sure that's a popular thing there.

The first one I had from her lasted 2 weeks with almost no chipping--amazing considering I wash my hands A LOT and manicures usually last MAX 2-3 days on me before chipping.

Instead of being like oh no it's cool no worries, she grabbed me by my shoulders and said I needed to wait online. I immediately shook her off, asked her wtf she thought she was doing touching me and I apologized again because I genuinely didn't know there was a line. She kept trying to apologize but at that point this girl looked so dumb to me that I laughed in her face, had my friend cancel the drinks, and we left. If you want to hang out with a bunch of girls with crew cuts and guys that look like they're under 21, this is the spot!!!!

I was supposed to attend a private event but when we arrived, to the dark smelly bar, we were told, quite rudely.  that the private event room was closed and the only way we could wait for the rest of our group is if we ordered drinks right away.. mind you there were 60+ people in our group and 1 bartender. Not only could the front of the room not handle all of us, but there was no way the bar could handle the orders. As I did that night, i'll take my business elsewhere next time im looking for drinks in the city. No thank you Beauty Bar, no thank you!",3,,

126,Elizabeth F.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,5,0,4.0,1/1/2016,"First experience at a real bar (just turned 21) and I seriously dig the vibe! I think I'm a little too young to fully enjoy the experience as the atmosphere consists of mostly 30+ year olds but the place is quaint, retro... In the sea of heads singing along to 80s punk rock my friends and I were the only people who didn't know the lyrics to the majority of the tunes while on the dance floor but the alcohol definitely helped. The drinks were palatable but I can only compare them to mixed college house party drinks given my lack of experience at actual establishments. My girls and I sat at the bar for a while and had a great time. The staff is lovely, bartenders are absolutely the sweetest... I had such a stellar night! If this is how it is to be a full-fledged adult then I think I'm okay with that.",,,
127,Rosemarie H.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",97,188,2,1.0,4/11/2016,"I use to like Beauty Bar a few years ago and now it's just an embarrassment, either that or I was much to drunk a few years ago. That being said my one friend wanted to go someplace where you could dance, and I thought well why not beauty bar, it's not clubby and it plays a ton of different 80's music. We go in for a little bit, it appears dirtier than I remember it to be and the people are a bit pushy but whatever it's a bar you can't expect for it to be perfect. After standing in the bathroom line that is located in the worst area ever, in other words it's a line that goes directly in front of the bar, that makes no sense at all. Was it always like that? We then leave and eventually venture back a few hours later. That's when disaster hits, my roommate gets into the bar just fine and the bouncer then goes on to scrutinize my I.D. I mean I get it, that's your job and I get I have the old NYS I.D. still, but it's not like NYS is sending me a free updated version of the new I.D. and it doesn't expire for another 5 years so why would I pay for it? Honestly though he stared at it, then scanned it (the scan said it was fine) and then stared at it some more and I look exactly like my I.D. So there is that. I started to say that I was already here earlier that evening and was willing to show I have other things with me with my name on it when my roommate came back and gave me a look and went to ask me what the problem was. The bouncer then proceeds to yell at my roommate saying why did you give me that look, meaning him, and he needs to watch who he gives looks to. So it seemed like the bouncer was trying to start a fight just because he was having a bad evening, which isn't cool. The whole point of a bar is so people can come have fun and if the first person someone sees is aggressive for no apparent reason then why is anyone going to want to come back here, actually why would they even stay and give it a chance? My roommate then went to find the manager and inform him of the situation. Hopefully he took care of it but honestly who knows since we immediately left. All I know is that I won't be back and won't be recommending Beauty Bar to any of my friends.",2,,

Updated review","I was so excited to update this horrible review with a positive account. I really was. My boyfriend, a girlfriend and I finally returned to Beauty Bar after a 2 year hiatus due to the overly rude staff. It looked like we had the same guerilla bartender, but there was a polite female there to compensate. We got our drinks and proceeded to dance in the bar that was at half the capacity it was at 2 years ago on a Saturday night. It seems their reputation is catching up to them. We were having a good time, and were getting ready to leave when the bouncer came up and told us we had to leave. ok? Apparently the DJ was rough with my boyfriend  on his journey back to the DJ booth, and was unhappy with the situation. I was there the whole time and oblivious to what was going on, so it could not have been that bad, but they proceeded to kick us out, and not explain to me why. This bar is the WORST. They are bringing in significantly less business than they were two years ago, their whole staff is arrogant and rude, and they do not appreciate good, local business. I have said it once and I will now say it again. Of all the places to spend your money in NYC, please make this the last on your list. It is  sure to be an unsatisfactory experience for your entire party.",5,,

144,Darwin G.,"New York, NY",277,966,67,4.0,9/5/2011,"A really cool bar with a dance floor in the back. It is themed as a beauty salon so it has old fashioned large metal hair drying machines that you see ladies use. On certain nights, you can pay to get your nails painted, while getting your drink on.The front part is good for drinks and sitting around. The back area is large with a projector screen and perfect for getting your dance on without the whole situation of having to getting into a club (getting decked out, signing up for a list, waiting on line, paying a cover, etc.).",,,

It was a great time!What sold me is the $10 mani/drink special..It was the perfect opportunity to enjoy my night and get a nice Christmas themed manicure.They were playing great 80s and early 90s music and it was fun to spend an hour or two there.

But we managed to secure a little area by the mani table to hang out and have some breathing room. Don't expect much, it was just being in a bar with a girl doing nails.",,,
151,Kathleen S.,"Teaneck, NJ",134,45,51,3.0,12/20/2013,"Skip the $10 martini and a manicure. It's not worth it. They should call it an express manicure because the manicurist didn't push or cut my cuticles nor did she brush the dust off my nails from filing so now there are tons of tiny bumps under my nails. It's not pretty.Other than that, I can only speak for the prosecco I had, which was great. However, I wouldn't go back again. The idea of a $10 mani with martini is awesome, but it is terribly executed and the decor isn't appealing. I would have given this place 4 stars if I got an actual manicure.",,,

So yeah I got my jacket and peaced out.  I wouldn't even go here again for a friend's birthday or something.  Actually, no, I would because I'm a good friend but I would get drunk somewhere else beforehand and/or bring my flask.So in short, BEAUTY BAR 86s WOMEN FOR CRYING LIKE WTF DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!",9,15,1
154,Laura G.,"New York, NY",167,187,32,3.0,3/8/2015,"This place is very eclectic, a novelty... I'd say it's worth coming here just to try out! Great value, one drink and one manicure for $10. Drink was pretty strong and the manicurist was the sweetest. Unfortunately, the manicure itself had a lot of bubbles in it and it's hard to not smudge it before it's dry. By the bar it's really chill and they let us bring in cupcakes for my friend's birthday. They have even little tables and seating that's not at the bar itself. As for the dancing, the music was good (cute) but after a bit you start to realize this type of music isn't as conducive to dancing as you'd think. Dance floor was packed, hard to find space. Surprisingly young crowd given the music scene. Although this place has a girly vibe (eg. pink sparkly walls by the bar), there were plenty of guys there. It's good for a girl's night. I wouldn't come running back here, but $10 for a drink or a manicure in the city is a steal so getting both at the same time (albeit both mediocre) makes it worth considering retrying.",,,

Every time I tried to sip my drink she would impatiently tut and clap her hands or even pull my hand back to her. It was so dark in there I couldn't see the nail polish colors to begin with but when I left and saw the job in the light, I might as well have done it myself.

My friend had a bottle of very good, expensive gin in his bag when we got there and the bouncer, who at first seemed really cool and friendly, told us we could leave it behind the bar and take it when we were leaving. When we left we forgot it and  when we went back for it a few minutes after closing they showed us an empty bottle and they did so in a taunting manner.  Basically waving it in in our faces and saying too bad ....  Maybe we were wrong for leaving it and maybe it's some bar rule that they have to dump it but the way they handled the situation was unacceptable. They were totally unprofessional and treated us with no respect.",2,1,
164,Allison K.,"Bay Ridge, NY",98,31,23,1.0,8/7/2014,"I came here one early evening with my best friend for the $10 martini/manicure. I genuinely really wanted to love this place because I mean, $10 for a martini AND manicure? That's a great deal and worth a try. I hyped my best friend about it and she too probably had higher expectations for the place. THIS IS NOT A NAIL SALON! It's a bar, where there's 2 tables given to the manicurist to get the job done. It has old hair salon equipment and gives a vibe of a run down hair salon that only your grandmother would maybe get her perm at. But again, it's a bar.  When we came in, 5:15ish PM, there wasn't a soul in sight, except the bartender. She informed us that the manicurist didn't get in until 5:30 PM and served us martinis while we waited. The martinis were subpar. Nothing special or worth remembering. The two ""manicurists"" took their sweet time for set up. My best friend had a little bit of gel manicure on and they refused to soak it off. They then went on a rant about how bad gel manicures are for you nails. My friend just suggested them to cut off since the gel manicure was only at the tips. They had a tray of Zoya nail polish, too bad they had no idea how to execute the color well. They should just advertise that they paint nails NOT an actual real manicure. My manicurist, the sarcastic redhead (who also said she was she's the manager of the bar on some days) did my nails, but let me tell you, it was more like she butchered them. One look at my nails she said my nails were in bad condition. She's not supposed to cut cuticles (store policy) but she said ""the manicure would look like shit if I don't cut them."" So she pushed my cuticles with every ounce of anger she had and used NO CUTICLE SOFTENER, if I wasn't so intoxicated from dinner earlier that evening I probably would've cried from the pain. I bled from 6/10 fingers. She then decided it was a good idea to wipe away the blood with NAIL POLISH REMOVER!!! Salt on an open wound? Yes, feel my pain. I bled for days because the wounds kept opening up. Then she thought it was a great idea to just paint over my wounds and blood. My best friend said her paint job was awful too! Bubbles and unevenness that my 2 year old could've done... Seriously. I think that's why they offer martinis before your manicure, in hopes of you getting drunk enough so you don't notice the awful paint job they call a manicure. Although it was a great concept, the way the ran the place, should be illegal. It is just NOT a good idea to put unexperienced ""manicurist"" in a dark bar.",2,,

The back room is hoppin and the DJ has always got something on to move to. And the drinks are not that expensive! I can't quote prices, but I've gone there, wet my whistle, and left not feeling jipped.

Let's just say, it was worth the $10 deal, but  that came with some baggage: a) an unfriendly manicurist, who almost filed my nail away, and b) a bartender who just had to remark that ""that drink doesn't include a tip with the $10, hunny"" (as if I wasn't going to give him a tip, and as my drink was spilling everywhere). It was OK and a cool NY experience (the idea is very unique), but I'd rather just go to a nail salon and get  a regular mani/pedi and call it a day. Admittedly, I've heard it was fun later in the night (we only stayed for that one drink, around 10 pm, before the back was open).",,1,

The concept is awesome- drink and get your nails done- but the manicures are so shitty and ruin your nails. I regret that I didn't just save the $10 to buy more drinks during happy hour. It's not a bad place, but I would just stick to the drinks. Their happy hour pricing is pretty cheap.",1,,

174,Judy C.,"Munich, Germany",123,698,136,4.0,1/16/2011,"I know that if I am in Union Square in search of a fun dance party, then I can rely on Beauty Bar to do just that.  After a disasterous start at a nearby club on a Saturday night, my friends and I resorted to Beauty Bar to make up for it.The place is indeed fun and charming.  The decor of this place presents the fixtures of a salon (salon chairs, a wall of past sterilzers, etc) that is one of a kind.  I haven't had their manicures there, but it seems like people like it there.The front is a decent sized bar area where people can comfortably sit and stand to chat with others, and the back is the dance floor with a smaller bar.  I like the dance floor--it was crowded when we went Saturday night but not obnoxious.  Weeknights are much emptier, but it is still a good place to hang out.  Drinks are decently priced ($7 for a Stoli-soda), and I get them quite easily without a long wait.Of a couple of times when I've gone, the DJ mixes 80s (mostly new wave), some 90s, and indie pop songs.  I have definitely heard the same songs played and same reactions that come out of the fellow dancers to those songs (an example is the crowd's singalong to Aha's ""Take on Me""--""IN A DAY OR TWOOOOOOOOO!!!"").  Regardless, it is just fun to watch.Thank you Beauty Bar for saving my potentially unpleasant night.  I'll be sure to come back to see you soon!",,,

Music from all decades, sweaty people, groovy decor, loved it. My friend exclaimed ""It's like a Sarah Lawrence party in the 70's"". Bartender in the front bar was kind of a douche, wee bit pretentious and not friendly. The one in the back room was nicer and she actually smiled. Two places to hang up the coats in the winter months, jam packed, but you don't want to be holding anything so you can dance the night away! Bathrooms are typical college bar status, smelly and always a line but I did see a barback continuously filing it with toilet paper. I've never had issues with the bouncer, he's joked around with me and we chatted when I had to escape the heat from inside. $20 CC min & they keep your ID so don't forget that shit. My whiskey+coke cost $7 & a Stella was $5 I think? Definitely an experience, tho I'm not sure I'd ever jump for the $10 mani. Sounds like an infection waiting to happen!",,,

I think there were two ladies giving manis, so we sort of nursed our drink so that the 6 of us could all get our nails done. The ladies were nice though!

I wasn't expecting a great manicure, but I thought I could get my nails painted decently and not leave bleeding. I was wrong! The manicurist, while very friendly, broke though my skin while filing my nails, and then very painfully (and unevenly) pushed back my cuticles. Now they're all jagged and look worse than when I came in. To add insult to injury, it's been about 5 hours since the incident and my nail polish is already peeling off around all of the edges! Didn't even last a day! It's a lovely gimmick to give manicures at the Beauty Bar, but it doesn't seem safe or sanitary to have that sort of situation going on. It's a dark bar, with a teeny little light coming from a side angle for the manicurist to do her work under. And based on my experience and the results, I really wonder if this person had a license or any training. My friend had her nails done too, and both of our nails came out poorly. Nail polish on the skin, areas of nail with no polish at all, and of course there was the blood. You're better off just getting the drink and saving yourself the agony.

Dancing to awesome 80s and 90s music is the best way to end the week. Be on the look out for Flock of Seagulls (the DJ with white hair who only spins the 80s. Doesn't have a Flock of Seagulls haircut but it was the closest, drunk comparison at the time and it stuck). 2. Gorgeous bartender in the back room. Hook her up (tips wise!) and she will show you love. Seriously! Went up to her, asked for an Alabama Slammer for my friend and she gave her something even tastier. She also remembered how I take my G&T. I would marry her something fierce. 3. Great crowd. The bouncers are always friendly, as is the crowd. You can always find someone to have a good conversation with. 4. The movies they play in the back room. Trying to figure out what it is, is half the fun. Occasionally they play well known movies like Warriors and Mommie Dearest. To which you can then scream out the dialog if you know it. And now for the bad:1. People who stand in the middle of the dance floor and don't dance. Seriously, guys. People came here to dance. Get out of the way. AANNDD thats about it.

I went to this bar randomly with a friend wearing a hoodie/baseball cap.The first doorman said nothing about me removing it.I even left the bar and came back and STILL,NOTHING was said.Then suddenly,a massive guy around 6'3"" approaches me saying,""You're gonna remove your hat or you're going to leave.""This would have been FINE if it wasn't for the fact that he was 1 INCH from my face and body,speaking to me like I'm part of a notorious GANG! After telling him to ""Get out of my face"" NUMEROUS times,and refusing to remove my hat, I SUGGESTED that I finish my drink, BUT... WHILE standing near the door....THEN I will leave.But he didn't hear that I'm guessing since he was YELLING over me the ENTIRE TIME.He then proceeded to get PHYSICAL attempting to pry the class from my hands and we began to openly scuffle! :o Finally,he decided to STOP,and say...""You know what?I'm gonna let you stand near the door and drink that drink.""

I have never experienced this at a bar before.In NO WAY was this the proper way to handle this situation ESPECIALLY when I was MORE rthan willing to leave,BUT AFTER I consumed MY drink that I BOUGHT.

I came for a gf's birthday last week. Eventually, my bf and his posse came, and to my surprise, they decided they all wanted manicures as well (I think it was the excessive drinking they did beforehand). To partake in the festivities, you ask the bartender for the deal and order your drink and in return get a manicure card. The card has your number, and the number display is behind the manicurist. When we first arrived, there were two manicurists. However, around 11 (which is early!), one of the manicurists left. To give you an idea what this meant, I was number 32 and the number was on 27. The boys were numbers 34 and onwards. We quickly realized we weren't all getting manicures before we left. Like gentleman, they waited until I got my manicure (which ended up being 11:45). The manicurist was extremely sweet, and it came out great. All in all, the place has a weird crowd, the music is way outdated, and depending on when you get there, you may not get the manicure you came for.

If you go early (before 11) be prepared to get high off the noxious fumes of nail polish, which don't add as much kick to the cheap beer as you'd think. Beauty Bar is like a cheap corner whore.

Occassionally, a manicurist or two will be on duty. $10 mani + a complimentary cocktail.

The girl who does the manicures (Lucy/Lesile?) is super cool and chill. This is a great bar to go to even if you don't do the manicure.
