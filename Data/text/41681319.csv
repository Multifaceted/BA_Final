He really took care of us and was hella cool. We ordered the clams and cured meat board. Both were safe for those gluten free diners. The clam sauce was delicious and the size of the clams were huge-- bigger than many oysters I've had. We also ordered white wine, prosecco, and whiskey sours. All were delicious. The ambience is cozy. I'd definitely come back and recommend!",,,

I tried the smoked cantaloupe burger (yep, a thick slice of cantaloupe that's been smoked for days) and roasted potatoes (with a delicious sauce). Both were delicious. Wait staff and owner were very friendly. The hostess girl could've used a lesson on friendliness but maybe she wasn't feeling well that night.",,,

Not only did you change the goat neck recipe, but you served unacceptably different portion sizes. Top was ours for a group of 4. Bottom was the table next to us for 2 people. Also, your server, Heidi, was extremely unhelpful and rude. ""I wish I could say something else to you but I can't"" - great customer service. Get it together, or more folks like myself will not be back.",1,,
5,Tina W.,"New York, NY",438,908,1237,4.0,7/18/2018,"Ducks Eatery is absolutely a hidden gem!! A tapa place that you never wanna missed.Location: Place has both indoor and outdoor area for dining. I would say indoor dining area is very romantic whereas outdoor dining area is absolutely chill for fun, especially during the summer time. We had our reservation before actually visiting there. Even though we were late, waitress was nice enough to keep our seat for another 30 mins. Food: We were there right before their happy hour ( ended at 7???or 7:30???) Alcohol was pretty cheap at that moment and of course we could not skip this cheap deal. Also, three of us basically ordered everything in their menu and everything tasted fabulous. We all love their oak BBQ, fried artichoke, and chicken wing!!Beignets were something you should never skipped after all the great food.Service: Seems bit disorganized in such a small area. We were trying to order another rounds of wine but it was hard to get waitress/waiter's attention at all. They were quite busying greeting potential customers...Price: $$ at most 30/person.Overall: Good, I would recommend to visit during happy hour - plenty drinks, great tapa, not-so-effcient service. WHY NOT ??",3,3,5
6,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",218,345,514,4.0,6/26/2018,"I've been dying to go to Ducks for quite some time, as any well-received, New Orleans-influenced location piques my interest. Happily, almost everything here lived up to my expectations.  Generous happy hour ($3 genesee, $5 wines and a $6 specialty cocktail). The cheap booze paired nicely with a few shared small plates (salted cucumber appetizer was particularly inventive and refreshing) and some excellent, nicely-spiced rice and beans with chunks of lamb for dinner. Service was incredibly quick and friendly, even in a quite crowded restaurant. Unfortunately, the one disappointing mark was the thing I was most looking forward to, and ordered light to save room for--the dessert. The beignets were soft on the outside, but chewy and dense inside--complete opposite of the texture I'd expect from some glorious fried dough. And the chocolate espresso dipping sauce had an odd flavor and paired poorly. I wasn't expecting du Monde, but...these need to be revisited or replaced. Maybe some chocolate pralines or a king cake if you want to keep the Big Easy connection.",3,1,2
7,Matthew F.,"Stone Harbor, NJ",0,6,0,2.0,11/11/2018,"My first and second experience here was really great. I was super stoked to come back again. The goat neck was unique and really great. This time the goat neck portions were really off when the necks came out from the kitchen. The staff was like it is what it is. End of the day the item is 37 dollars, so it kind of was lame the staff didn't try to defuse the situation. You were good ducks but I'm done, have fun with your watermelon instagram trap. .",,,
8,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,3.0,9/3/2018,"Been here for brunch twice now. The menu has some pretty unique offerings. Old school southern food with a twist. The place has a cute rustic vibe. Service is good and it wasn't that crowded both times I came here, but I've never been super impressed by the food. Definitely not dissatisfied but not itching to come back either. Just pretty good and a decent option if you're looking for a brunch spot in EV and didn't plan with a reservation. Prices are reasonable.",3,2,3
9,Jillian L.,"New York, NY",386,311,118,3.0,5/11/2018,"If you've seen some of my other reviews, you'll know that I'm a big fan of large format dining - sharing large plates or big cuts of meat. I stumbled upon Ducks Eatery on Yelp and saw that everyone was raving about the goat neck.I made reservations on OpenTable and the restaurant was relatively empty when we arrived on a Friday night. Do not be alarmed but Ducks Eatery is the epitome of a typical NYC restaurant. The tables are inches away from each other. I saw the Triple D recap of Ducks before I came, so I knew we had to order the chicken wings ($16) and the goat neck ($37). The chicken wings came in four huge pieces. I'm talking drumstick and wing in one. Definitely not a first date kind of dish. I thought that the chicken wing was alright. I wasn't a huge fan of the rub they used. On the other hand, the goat neck was super tasty and comes on top of a bed of fragrant rice. I love herbs, so I appreciated the huge handful of cilantro on top of the neck. While good, I felt that half of the neck was juicy and tender and the other half was tough and dry. Overall, I thought our dinner at Ducks Eatery was just okay. The tables are a little too close for comfort, the servers was struggling to navigate the crowd, and the food had some hits and misses, but for me there were just a few more misses.",3,2,2

Updated review","Not quite a BBQ joint, but Ducks Eatery has plenty of fried, grilled and braised meat options for carnivores all over. I had their St Louis Ribs, which was pretty good. It was seasoned assertively and had some kind of a creamy drizzle sauce on it. I also tried the wings, which had a really unusual spice seasoning - it had sweet/floral notes where I usually expect spice/smoke. I had a glass of Malbec to go with meat, and while I know red wines aren't meant to be chilled, it tasted a bit like earth soup during the high 90s weather that evening.They did not seem to have much ventilation going on inside the restaurant that night (no AC) so I chose to sit outside.",1,1,1
11,David N.,"Manhattan, NY",188,384,153,2.0,4/21/2018,This place has gone so far downhill that it is an accomplishment in and of itself. Came here with 6 people and it was so bad we all had to laugh.1. Took an hour before they told us that they were out of fish meaning no one was even trying to cook our order for that long2. Food when it did come out came out with 5-10 minute pauses between dishes3. 2 people's eggs had shell in them even though one was scrambled and the other was poached4. The poached eggs were hard boiled and yet  amazingly still cold5. The side salad was plain iceberg lettuce with a flavorless dressing6. The staff acknowledged that everything sucked and comped the food which is still too expensive if you ask me8. Was told that it's not usually like this. I suspect the cook didn't show up so maybe the delivery guy or someone else with zero training had to cook the food. Luckily it is not too far from Joe's pizza so grabbed a slice. Avoid this place unless you wanna wait a really long time for cafeteria food. Actually some cafeterias are good so I shouldn't compare them to this slop.,2,1,

13,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",36,173,149,3.0,8/27/2018,"Nothing really stood out except for the cantaloupe burger, and of course the watermelon ham. Flavors were good, though. Deviled Eggs. pickled rhubarb relish. - I believe they should have wrote deviled ""egg"", because there's only one egg cut in half. Relish was good. Chicken Wings. oak smoke. jerk rub. chive. lime. - the chive seemed to make this dish better than it would be without it. Smoked Cantaloupe Burger. crispy caramelized onion. hot ranch. lettuce. sesame. - pretty good, tasted better than the jackfruit burger I had recently. Whole Smoked Watermelon ""Ham,"" came with: Dirty Rice. smoked lamb. andouille. pickled okra. rice. - not sure if the meat was left out because it's just the side for the ham, but it was still tasty.Butter Lettuce. sugar snap pea. smoked ricotta. green dressing. - pretty plain. Roasted Potatoes. pickled baby fennel. rosemary. burnt orange. - the orange must have made it really good, because I don't care for rosemary or fennel. All in all, I wouldn't go back a second time, but it's a good experience. I was expecting the watermelon ham to be sweet and taste more like watermelon, so that's probably why I didn't like it as much. It tasted more like a radish.",,,
14,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,4.0,1/13/2018,"Ducks Eatery is one the many gems you can find tucked throughout the east village. This specific place had come highly recommended from a friend so we popped in here on a Thursday night.The restaurant is very small and intimate, so at any given time it will never really be packed. We grabbed a table in the corner and dined in what was a laid back but awesome atmosphere. They play pretty good music in the background and also offer outside dining in the warmer months. I had a order of wings to start and they were delicious. They had a Smokey taste but were heavy bbq'd and tender. I also had a brisket sandwich with a side of collard greens. The brisket was very good as the sauce was delicious and the brisket itself was cooked well. The collard greens were also good and had a little spice.This is a great choice amongst many in the east village. Small, delicious food and great for outside dining in the warmer months. They also have good wine and beer options. Cool spot.",2,1,1
15,Eric G.,"Gulfport, MS",2,28,19,5.0,9/17/2018,"Saw a video about their watermelon ""ham"" and knew I had to check it out! Unfortunately they only make the watermelon ham by reservation and they have a waiting list! I did however have the ribs and they were awesome! I'm a Texas boy, so I'm picky about my barbecue. These ribs were crispy outside and tender inside! I inhaled them!  I had a chocolate dessert, but can't remember the name of it. The service was spot on and they took really good care of me. It's a smaller space, so definitely make a reservation or get there early!",1,,
16,Jon W.,"New York, NY",3012,290,1008,4.0,12/6/2017,Duckin Tasty!This small eatery in the east village has some delicious options. When you walk in it has a small bar with dim lighting and a bunch of little tables so it can get cramped on a crowded night but it is worth it. For a duck restaurant they only have 2 duck entree options which i thought was weird.We ordered some whisky and spicy pickle back shots to get the dinner off to a great start. For the appetizers we got the spicy jerky which was actually pretty bad. We also got the Red Beans 'n Rice which had smoked lamb. cumin. cilantro. rice. and was just a flavor explosion and the lamb was just amazing i didnt expect beans and rice to be that good. For dinner we split the Chicken Wings. with hickory smoke. jerk rub. lime these were true chicken wings you literally got the entire wing of the bird and their jerky rub was great. We also split the Smoked Whole Goat Neck with royal curry. bing cherries. rice for two. This was my first time eating goats neck and tasted very fatty to but also delicious. I did think though the portions were all pretty small and was hungry after.In short:- Tasty Food- Smallish Portions- Nice Servers,15,4,14
17,Nea E.,"Long Island City, NY",180,3,31,1.0,6/3/2018,"Terrible.1. They forgot to serve the oysters we ordered. 2. They never came back to refill water. 3. They ran out of Pato Blanco; it was 6:30pm. 4. They ran out of Duck Salad.5. The server bare handed picked up a chew bone when it fell off the plate to the table; he never washed his hands. I was watching him the entire time I sat on my table. 6. They have light fixtures just blocking the drink menu. Other than that, the lamb and rice is good. That's about it.",3,,

20,ImHungry S.,"Long Island, NY",1,7,3,5.0,10/9/2018,My boyfriend took me here for my birthday based on a food network review he saw on tv.  Wow.  The duck neck is what they recommended online...wasnt sure how I felt about that until I walked in and saw that almost every table ordered it. That gave us confidence! ;) (always afraid to order something we will not be happy with.. Especially since it was a large entree for 2)Never would I have thought that would just fall off as soon as you put your fork to it.  So tender. We have been dying to go back. Just saw online that the watermelon dish is a must have and has gone a bit insta-worthy. 5 stars all the way,,,

23,Peter A.,"New York, NY",111,120,28,2.0,5/11/2018,"The goats neck is great. Recently though, I find that this place has been diminishing in quality. I've probably eaten here close to 10 times. It used to be the ONE restaurant I'd recommend my friends go to when they visit. In my last 2-3 visits I've found their food to be inconsistent and lathered in salt. That's not how it should go down... I'd be willing to revamp this review when they get back to what made them a go to spot. Maybe they'll extend me an invitation and I can make peace with wanting this place to excel... with its exposed brick it is a quaint haunt in the east village. Don't let me down, eatery of the duck.

25,Luigi C.,"Queens, NY",31,98,125,1.0,7/26/2018,"Dinner at Ducks was acceptable. Staff was welcoming and attentive, they have a happy hour from 5pm-7pm. At some point my friend forgot what she was drinking which was a Berry Margarita which had me think, this place is a little over complicated. We shared a bottle of wine for 3. Oysters were great during HH, $1.50 each and they were good and so was the cucumber app which was covered in a good tasting green sauce. The 1* is for the large meals we ordered, none were up to par with the pricing nor the taste. Each one of use received something that we did not expect and also we left hungry. Cost of meal for 3 was around $180.",1,1,
26,Adam S.,"New York, NY",1542,292,2047,4.0,2/2/2018,"Disclaimer: I used a Gilt City experience here. Ducks Eatery had been featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, and I had been wanting to give it a try for some time.  When it popped up on Gilt City, I purchased a Dinner experience that included a pretty significant sampling of their menu.  While they were out of some things, we had a great experience and I'm sure we would be back.  Ducks isn't a large space, with two small tables in the center and the rest of the tables against the wall around them. So on a busy night, I imagine it's hard to walk between.  However, we came on a Monday evening and it was manageable.  The server was super nice and came with helpful recommendations.  She was patient, attentive, and welcoming to our Gilt City voucher, yet not aggressive at all. For drinks we tried the Kataja, a gin-based drink with celery, juniper, and lemon, and the Duck Buck, with bourbon, ginger, calamansi (a type of citirus fruit), and soda. The cocktails were nothing to write home about, but they were alright. Onto the food: We started with the Pickle Jar - which included pickled jicama, okra and and baby carrots. Followed by the Celery Root and Fried Artichoke vegetable plates. Both vegetables were sizeable portions and were truly decadent. Admittedly, the pickle jar just whet our appetite for the stars of the evening: the vegetables and the meat dish.  Speaking of....the meat: Chicken Wings.  Now, you only get 4 full wings, but they are filling and full of flavor.  So good, and worth every bite! We finished everything off with Smoked Pot de Creme, made with chocolate, chili, and salted caramel whipped cream. I mean, I would've licked the jar....Definitely a great experience overall and would go back.",11,,5
27,Gerrie L.,"New York, NY",492,73,49,3.0,4/7/2018,"3.5 stars.I came here on a Friday night with two friends, around 6:43PM. The reason why I remember the exact time is because the host got low-key sassy with us. They asked if we had a reservation, despite the restaurant had mostly empty tables. We said no. They pondered for some time and finally was like ""okay, I can seat you if you can finish by 8PM."" Okay, sure. We finished right on time, and there were still many empty tables. It's nothing they said, but the way they said it just felt rather rude. The place is indeed very small.We ordered some oysters, goat neck, and the St. Louis ribs. This restaurant LOVES cilantro, and unfortunately, I do not because it tastes like soap. I am reminded fondly of my kindergarten years when my teacher would threaten to wash my mouth of soap, and my parents actually did it. I didn't eat the oysters because I don't like oysters. It's fine. My friends reported they were tasty!But I did eat the goat neck. The goat neck was the star. I highly suggest getting it. It's definitely enough for three people, despite the menu saying two. I guess if you just get the neck, maybe then, but if you're three with an extra dish, it's too much? I can't math. But the goat neck was delicious! Pick out the vertebrae and you're good to go. It melts in your mouth. I will point out that the menu says it's ""curry,"" but in most cultures, ""curry"" implies that nearly the entirety of the dish is in the sauce. However, in this goat case, the sauce is only on the meat. So I don't think it's an accurate name. If this were Chopped, major points probably would have been deducted. Cilantro adorns the rice, much to my soapy disdain, along with something that looks like raisins. It's a lot of cilantro. Like, a lot.=We also got the St. Louis ribs. They were decent, but personally, I didn't like them. Comes in 5 ribs. To me, they just tasted like ""true meat""? I don't know how to describe it. Like, there was no flavor, other than MEAT. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't GREAT, ya feel? It's a cute place! I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were in the summer. I mean, I know it's technically spring, but it snowed last week, so what is the truth. They kept the door open even though it was pretty chilly last night. We got the table closest to the door. If I got the seat closest to the door, I definitely would have been miserable. For all three of us, it was $76 without tip and tax.",,,

29,Sijia Z.,"New York, NY",328,22,43,3.0,1/30/2018,"This place has some delicious southern brunch options yet it doesn't have a line! Shimp & Grits: it was pretty delicious, if minus the shrimps. The shrimps were overcooked, very very dry and bright white color from the inside out. I felt like the shrimps were too dry to belong to this dish. Despite the shrimps, however, the cherry tomatoes added some mild sourness to the grits and smartly balanced the salty and cheesy taste. The chorizo was slightly hot, creating a different layer of the grits. Although overall it's a bit too salty, I liked the grits a lot.",1,,
30,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,1/10/2018,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Tuesday night. Tuesday night is brisket night and I have been wanting to go here for so long, so was happy to finally have the opportunity.We started off with the pickle jar, which was an assortment of mixed veggies that were pickled. Star anise (which has a bit of a licoricey flavor) was a big component of the pickling liquid--so needless to say it was not my favorite.For my main meal, I decided to go with the 50/50 brisket plate with 50% fatty brisket and 50% lean brisket. Lesson learned--go with the fatty brisket!! The fatty brisket was so flavorful and tender and had a nice spice rub to it that was absolutely delicious. The lean brisket was good with the housemate BBQ sauce, but the fatty brisket is where its at.I also had a couple bites of my friend's duck pot pie, which was decent, but nothing to write home about.Overall, this place isn't too big, but the vibe and atmosphere are lively. The fatty brisket is a must order and definitely is in the running for best brisket in NYC. Service was friendly and attentive and food took a bit of time to come out, but it was worth it.",,,

32,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,4.0,4/23/2017,"Above average brunch with a differentiated menu, which I definitely appreciate.Pumpkin waffle with fried duck confit -- the waffle was light, and the walnuts and fixings went well with it.  I was really excited about fried duck confit instead of just fried chicken, and it did not disappoint.  The skin was crispy, and the meat was still juicy inside.Brisket hash -- I really enjoyed the flavor, although the brisket could've been a little more tender and soft.  Good meat to potato (btw it's purple potato!) ratio, i.e. healthy portion of meat. Eggs pontchartrain -- I only tried a bite of my friend's, but the egg was perfectly done.  The fish was flaky and a tad bit salty, but overall good.  I heard the maple sweet potato home fries were too sweet though.Beignets -- since beignets are one of my favorite things (I've been scouring the city trying to find good, authentic ones), I obviously had to try these.  They weren't bad, but were not fluffy and airy enough.  The chocolate sauce on the side, although not authentic to beignets, was pretty delicious though.Overall good quality and fun meal, and I'd be interested in coming back to try dinner as well.",4,,2

37,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",381,1268,914,4.0,8/29/2017,"Ducks Eatery is one of those places you go and there is zero pretense.  The interior looks like it could have been a bar at one time with brick walls and ceilings and the hint of older businesses of the past painted onto the walls.  There is a small bar and a few tables inside.  There is outdoor seating as well, fenced off with a wire fence that I'm sure is missing pieces.  It is all terribly charming in an ""Old New York City"" sort of way.It was a beautiful evening so my girlfriend and I wound up sitting outside.  The staff was on point the entire evening, checking on us, bringing our food in a very timely manner and refilling water.  Kudos to them for great service!  But let's get to the food shall we?SMOKED GOAT BUNS: rosemary. orange. squash. whipped mustardThis was an interesting dish.  Having grown up partly in Chinatown, I was used to meat in a bun, and that is basically what this was.  The texture reminded me of a roast pork bun, but the flavor of the meat was more floral and less gamey than I expected.  I did not get much of a flavor from the whipped mustard but the texture was nice.CELERY ROOT: wakame butter. preserved meyer lemon. togarashi. burdock.Cut into slices with (I *think* fried fennel) on top, this was a fascinating dish that was surprisingly bright and savory all at the same time.  This was a very different dish than I expected and I liked it.SMOKED LOCAL CARROT: charred leek dressing.Local carrots were right!  These carrots were not the manicured,  uniform looking ones you see in supermarkets.  Instead, these were different sizes and they had the rustic look of those you would buy at a farmer's market.  They were cooked perfectly and smoked was right!  They had a very smokey but sweet flavor and I was pleasantly surprised by them.CHICKEN WINGS: oak smoke. jerk rub. chive. lime.This dish comes with four large chicken wings.  I do not mean just a segment of a wing that is called a ""wing"", I mean the whole thing including the tips!  The seasoning on these were absolutely delicious!  They were smokey, spicy and savory all at the same time.  Even better they were nice and moist and not dried out at all.Ducks Eatery was fantastic and I look forward to going back in the future!",3,,
38,Jake S.,"Boston, MA",30,33,0,4.0,3/15/2018,"Ducks is a low key, small (15-20 seat) creole/southern based restaurant in East village. They're serving really well prepared and tasty dishes. I keep coming back for the ribs - they're particularly large and have a wonderful smokiness and tenderness. They also have a Tuesday brisket which is next level. I recommend getting it fatty, as it's tastier. They also had a frisée salad with a creamy lemon vinaigrette, smoked duck and pomegranate , which was bomb. The drinks are inventive and well priced. Have had several great dinners here and one average brunch.",1,,1
39,Joe S.,"Watertown, MA",155,17,0,5.0,2/1/2018,"Being from the south (well, having lived in the south most of my life at least) BBQ is something I take rather seriously. All too often you find upstart restaurants that feature (and often bastardize) BBQ by either disrespecting ingredients or showing a tremendous lack of understanding of the process and what makes good BBQ, great. You're usually left with over-sauced and weak meats - a caricature of 'meat mastery' that ultimately leaves you feeling gross and like you're owed something. This is the opposite of our experience at Duck's. I've worked in food service for well over a decade (which was a good 15 years ago) an experience that never truly leaves you- constantly looking at points of service and various flavor acrobatic failures. It was a delight that I could just concentrate on the food and my good company rather than the annoyance of being overlooked or underserved. In fact quite the opposite, and had even met the amazing Chef Will and talked tastes which, as an aspiring home chef, was a real treat. Now down to THE BUSINESS:ATMOSPHERE: COZY - very prototypical Manhattan sized space but not at all a typical vibe (fantastic laid back music was a nice touch. I like me some non pretentious jams). It was full on a Wednesday and while boisterous not large enough to feel cavernous and loud. Like being in someone's backyard popup. SERVICE: EXCEPTIONAL. Friendly, approachable, delightful and most of all - Complete and efficient. I've been to some of the finest restaurants in the world and rarely experience such a tight match of service and experience. Well done. WHAT WE ORDERED:DRIIIIINK:::::::::::::::::COCKTAILS - their house cocktail was amazing. Something you could easily slurp down all night - I can't remember the name but it was first on the list. Another was a green colored drink with bacon dust that was spicy but very refreshing as well. A liver moisturizer for sure. FOOOOOOOOD::::::GOAT NECK- must must must have. Decadent but not overly so 'like the most amazing pot roast you've ever eaten' but with rich and interesting flavors that toe the line between southern bbq and Jamaican flavors. Dat RICE tho. Just give me this once a week and I'll be good I promise. CHICKEN NUGGETS - made from smoked cantaloupes. WTF why are these so effing good? The sauces that came with them were super familiar and fun - nothing overly fancy but straight up good. Excellent to share. One recommendation to the kitchen: give them a little more time to chill out as some of the pieces were a bit liquified (beware balls of fire). CANTALOUPE BURGER - also seriously good. Tasted like a burger from a greasy spoon with all them comfort notes. It even tasted like it had cheese on it but .... there was no cheese. This was a bit mind bending actually. Smoked and crispy bits from the fried onions. WINGS - perfect expression of Jamaican flavors. Excellent texture and crispness - love me a dry rub over a sauce most days. Something of a wing expert so heed my words. RIBS - they were solid flavors but I think we waited a little too long to have them so they cooled down a bit but strong flavors-we'll balanced. Personally I like a dry rubbed rib but the sauce on them was a nice tang that helped bring them up to par with everything else. Meat just collapsed off the bone- great flavors but I'd try and eat these as an app first while the nuggets cool down. I feel like I missed out on their prime flavor window. COLLARDS - solid standard greens. Which is exactly what we wanted. Execution is not something this place is short on. BEIGNET - these were probably my least favorite thing of the night. Flavors were there but they were a bit more 'biscuit' in texture and mouth feel. The chocolate sauce accompanying them was fantastic though - but the beignets were literally flat and potentially over baked/fried. I'm used to cafe du Monde in NOLA and these might need some more time in the test kitchen. (Yes we ate them all because they were still delicious). POT DE CREME - oh Jesus. Yes yes YES god YES.  OVERALL:Familiar flavors with complex attitudes crafted and served by the best kind of people you want to give your business to, because quite frankly they are 'the business'. BONUS - we got to taste some pastrami from their other restaurant and it was quite possibly the best I've ever had in my life. PRO-TIP: come on Tuesday for the brisket. It's only served that day. Also they do pigs and rabbits but they need to be ordered a week ahead. Check online. Definitely make rezzies.",4,2,2
40,Diane Y.,"Manhattan, NY",2,17,4,5.0,9/25/2017,Maybe the best restaurant in the east village.  It's super casual and relaxed but the food is out of this world.   It's a tight space full of friendly staff and folks from the neighborhood.  I highly recommend the goat neck for the adventurous and the Yakamein soup for everyone else.   The cocktails are also very fun and you can't miss.  They also have a sidewalk cafe which is perfect this time of year.I'll be back soon to try brunch which I imagine will be epic.,1,,

There seemed to be more emphasis on the rub than ya know, traditional spare rib flavor...like I said, it was good but not really what I was looking for/expecting.We also got the jerk chicken wings. I liked those...but man did it look like I was suffering from jaundiced fingers...my fingers were stained yellow for 2 days. Other half was not a fan...he doesn't do spicy. I warned him and he assured me he'd be fine...I'm not a fan of the whole plates of meat and sides thing separately here. Each thing should come with a side, but that's just my opinion...just beware if you're super hungry it could get pricey really quick.",1,1,2
42,Andy P.,"Chicago, IL",67,14,9,1.0,8/18/2018,"The jerky was super tough and over seasoned.  I love spicy food and buy Tabasco by the gallon, but the heat on the jerky was not pleasant.

44,Adam S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",179,3,1,1.0,6/19/2018,"I used to go to Ducks all the time. It was my go - to in the East Village for dates, happy hrs, and my primary recommendation for anyone in from out of town. Ducks peaked in quality 2014-2015. The goat neck and cherry basmati rice was killer, as were the St. Louis style ribs (which, frankly, rivaled what I've had in St. Louis). The bone marrow was second to none, and the pigs ears were a great way to turn people on to the snout-to-tail philosophy. Then Ducks nose-dived into a mountain. Now the service staff are too consumed with personal conversations and screwing around behind the bar, usually drunk and consistently inattentive. I typically like and enjoy a rambunctious wait staff - I like a wheelin' and dealin' staff that slugs drinks and powers through whatever drugs they've ingested to get through their shift.However, at Ducks orders go missing, food is overcooked, and you won't get out of there in under 2 hrs. even when the place is empty. The food simply isn't good enough to overcome the terrible service and absurdly cramped - even for NYC standards - seating arrangement.RIP Ducks Eatery.",2,,
45,Ashley V.,"Rossville, Staten Island, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/7/2018,"After waiting 35 minutes, in a  90 degree nonairconditioned shoe box, to have our order taken (several people who were seated after us were serviced first so I believe the waiter forgot about us) we were told that they were out of the ONLY vegetarian/ vegan meal on the menu. As a restaurant that is being advertised as a vegetarian/ vegan friendly venue I am HIGHLY disappointed. We drove 50 minutes out of the way just to walk out. Not to mention that after being told that their ONLY vegetarian meal option was unavailable, I was offered a cucumber as dinner. A cucumber. Needless to say I will not be coming back nor will I be recommending this sub par service to anyone. I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant.",3,2,
46,Daniel B.,"Vernon Hills, IL",200,190,57,3.0,5/19/2017,"I made a reservation at Duck's Eatery with 5 of my friends. It's a very popular place, so you may be quoted a long wait time if you don't have a reservation.We got a variety of dishes, such as Goat neck, Chicken Wings, and the Ribs. The food was pretty solid. My wings had layers of flavors, as the jerk seasoning on them really gave it a smokey taste. The goat neck seemed to be quite a bit of food, so two of our friends actually shared the dish. The Ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and were made in the St. Louis style, which I believe is a dry rub?The service here was somewhat lacking. I don't know whether it was because they only had one server checking up on all the tables, but it took a long time for us to actually order, and we couldn't actually find our server when we were ready. For the same reason, it took a long time for us to get our check completed. Not a huge deal, especially since we weren't in a rush, but this could be a problem for those with plans later on.",1,,

All the food was good. I wanted to try the goat neck because I read it was delicious but I wasn't so daring. The chicken wings by far were my favorite. They had jerk seasoning on it. Not drenched in sauce and the sauce was very flavorful. Duck salad was good. The greens were bitter and balanced nicely by the cranberries and apple pairing. Beans and rice packed a lot of flavor! Nice little hidden gem",1,2,1
48,Vince N.,"Maui County, HI",488,1646,7056,3.0,7/9/2016,"My spouse wanted to come here after seeing them on Diners, Drive In's and Dives.  ATMOSPHERE:The space is tiny, and they sure cram everyone in.  So much so that servers are always squeezing in between to access other tables, forcing you to constantly scoot in, lean forward, or even stand up and move your chair.  If that's not it, you may encounter that impatient and rude Asian girl we did who was such in a hurry to get out of the place.  It took all my restraint to not blow up on her.  I stayed silent, ignored her whining, and my nephew took care of it with civility.  There was a heat wave in the area, and they have no a/c.  1+1=2 lol. MENU:It's a complex mix of foods with heavy Thai/Asian style influences on many dishes. BEVERAGE:Martini - They could not do a straight up martini.  It came to the table twice in a dirty style.  Our server was so humble about it and even took it off our tab without even asking.  Thank you!Dale's Pale Ale - There are so many beers I haven't tried in this world, it's always a fun experience doing so.  This one in particular, very good!  Mild, good flavor, a slight aftertaste. FOOD:Chicken Wings - You get 4 whole wings for $14.  The seasonings were good; savory, a little sweet, a little tart, and best of all, very crispy.  This was my favorite dish here and highly recommended. Little Neck Clams - Though it doesn't state it on the menu and wasn't relayed by our server, this is a super spicy dish, about a 4.5 on a 5 heat scale.  It didn't seem so spicy at first, but the heat slowly escalated and I ended with a burning & sour taste on my buds.  Apparently the 2 corn cobs that came with it were extremely more spicy because it was soaked in the fiery sauce.Collard Greens - Compared to my extended family's version, theirs was a bit too vinegary for me, and didn't come out hot.  No serving spoon was given so we did the communal fork thing. Red Beans 'n Rice - My second favorite dish.  The meat was lamb and didn't taste gamey at all.  Mixed in with the beans and seasoning, it tasted like one of my Hawaii favorites of chili & rice.  Highly recommended!Smoked Whole Goat Neck - The star of the show, literally, and the main reason why we came here.  Oddly this dish came out last, with an almost ""did they forget about it"" moment.  It's a huge portion good enough for 4 maybe even 5 to share. If you saw the Triple D segment and how it's prepared, you'd never guess that all those spices were in it.  Overall flavor was very subtle, not gamey, and borderline boring.  It was nicely prepared and super tender, no knives needed.  The continent of rice underneath it was more of an absorber for us.  Potatoes would've been a better accompaniment. SERVICE:Our male server was very friendly, professional, patient, and checked on us often. TIPS:They only take reservations for parties of 4+. Sit outdoors to avoid musical chairs. OVERALL:Nice menu but definitely hyped up by TV.",3,3,3

50,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,3.0,4/7/2017,"As some people know, I will seek out anything that even remotely claims to identify as Cajun or Creole. I have a chronic case of homesickness for a place I've never lived in, and that's my drama. I came into Ducks knowing I wasn't going to be having gumbo and Abita while listening to Kermit Ruffins, but there is part of me what always hopes. And it really is OK that it's not those things. The music was fantastic. The service was great. But the food is pricey, and while it was good I wouldn't say this is a destination for me.Me and my partner ordered the oysters, four for $10. It comes with a delicious jalapeno mignonette and a solid cocktail sauce. They oysters were a little briny with a sweet finish, I liked them. He ordered the ribs with a side of collard greens. Delicious (but room temperature) greens, with quality bacon towards the bottom. Mix up that bowl before eating to get the good stuff properly dispersed. The ribs had a dry rub, I'm more of a sauce fan but they were very good quality and extremely filling. I ordered what I felt I had no choice but to order: fried duck confit. paté butter. smoked tomato jam. pecan on some kind of waffle. I mean, with a description like that what else would I have gotten? And it was good. Filling, hearty, not overly decadent considering what it was...but it just wasn't giving me that ""Oh"" moment. That's a stupid sounding thing to say, but it's true. The duck skin was crispy, the meat within tender, the pate contrasting so well with the pecans soaked in syrup, the waffle was good. I could not identify the tomato jam by sight or taste, but with all that going on I'm not really surprised. At $28, all the parts were there and I just can't say what was missing. We both ordered cocktails, him whiskey, me mezcal, and could taste very little liquor in either. I don't really have a bad word to say about Ducks, I just think there are other places I would rather spend $100+ on a meal for two.",1,,

53,Gavin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,67,161,2.0,9/4/2017,"Came here on a Friday night. Drinks are pretty good, food is less impressive to a point that I find it disappointing.We ordered a pitcher of watermelon cocktail pairs with couple entrees and appetizers to share. For appetizers we have chicken wings and lobster sauce grilled corn. The chicken wings are overly saucy and sour. It totally took away the grill wood fire taste that one should be able to get from a grill wings. Worst of all, that lobster sauce with corn is just a nightmare. They mixed in too much of herbs in the sauce and it would only give me a mouth full of raw grassy taste with no hint of lobster to be found anywhere. Unfortunately, the Tate is so unbearable that I could only take one bite and leave it.For entree, we have the goat neck and barbecue ribs.  First of all, I have to give them credit for the goat neck. It is soft and juicy. The meat just fall off the bone and still packs the right amount of lamb flavor and fat for each bite. The ribs on the other had is extremely disappointing. Even though a little fat is normal in BBR Rib, a Huge chunk is just not justified. I would say only half of the Rib is meat and the other half is just pure fat, and they are not situated in a balance manner but rather each on their own end. Very much like Trump supporter and protesters, there is no middle ground.Given that they have failed on some of the most basic cooking techniques on couple dishes, I would have given them 1 star, but the goat Neck and the watermelon cocktail deserve an extra star.",1,2,
54,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,936,2.0,7/15/2016,"The goat neck dish was good and the drinks were surprisingly good. The red beans and rice dish was flavorful but amongst the rice were random rock hard pieces. I'm sure if there were grains that just didn't get cooked or if they were overlooked and stuck to the bottom of the pan. Also, the red beans were way under cooked (the table agreed). Not at all impressed, especially for a dish that is signature to the cuisine.Also the place is cute but really cramped and crowded. Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen but I also found the price pretty high for the quality and amount. Also, the service was so-so.

I came here with one other friend but would recommend making a reservation and coming with a group of people as portions are large and meant to be shared. Food was absolutely amazing. I would describe it as southern BBQ with southeast asian influence. In some ways it reminds me of Pig and Khao or of Fette Sau with an Asian twist. Goat neck and pigs ears are must tries! Goat neck was tender and the coconut rice that came with it paired well. Pig ears were crispy and came with lettuce leave wraps. They occasionally do a pigs ear special with corn bread, which I would not recommend ordering. I also loved the yakamein soup and the cured and preserved charcuterie plate.",2,1,1

Updated review","We came in today Ina stormy day. It's my birthday, but bc of the weather, only a couple and us were dining there. The service was a little slow (I meant the food came about 20 min after we ordered), but the food was amazing. I love the shrimp and grits! Very creamy and rich in flavor. You can feel the grits bumping in your mouth, unlike some other kinds of grits where the grits were ground completely. The shrimp was also tender and big. My friend ordered the Eggs Pontchartrain, which was yummy, too, especially the trout in it. The ambience was nice too. Overall, it was a great experience despite the blizzard outside.",1,1,1

72,Gus W.,"Columbus, OH",531,515,724,5.0,1/6/2016,"I caught this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and it really intrigued me, since I was heading to NYC, and it looked like it had some pretty interesting fare. It didn't seem like the typical restaurant on DDD, so maybe that's why it stood out. The place is pretty tiny, but we ended up getting seated at the bar immediately, and that was probably because it was a bit later on a Tuesday night. It did end up filling up while we were there.First off, everyone working here was super friendly, especially the bartender. Not only did he make some great cocktails, but he was very funny and easy to talk to. Kudos to that guy for being sociable and for also helping us decide on some meal choices!We ended up starting off with the okra and pig Ear small plates. The okra didn't wow me, but my sister loved it. The pig ears were awesome in my book. Beware though, they're incredibly crunchy to the point where you might feel like you're about to break a tooth. You'll have to get used to that part, but the hot sauce and pickled cabbage that accompanied it made the dish so delicious!Duck's is known for the goat neck entree, but I ended up going with the red beans and rice, since that's one of my favorite dishes. This one is made with lamb rather than andouille sausage, and it's so so good and tender. It was probably just the right amount of food too after eating the appetizers. My girlfriend had the chicken wings, and I would have eaten all of those too. I'm a huge fan of any kind of good jerk rub, and the chicken was incredibly juicy. I had a small bite of my sister's brisket sandwich and loved that as well. It comes on an English muffin which I haven't seen before.Side Note: Brisket is available on Tuesdays!!I was pretty full by the end and didn't get to try the beignets, which I really wanted to do! Hopefully it doesn't take as long for me to get back to NYC as it had up until now, and I'll pop in here for dessert. I highly recommend anyone in the city or visiting to check this spot out.",1,,1

I like to look on the bright side though: Usually they at least show up, and being early affords us the opportunity to drink and chat up bartenders (two of my favorite pastimes). Here at Ducks, the cocktails are good, and when I asked her about the menu, the bartender let me know that:""It's all about the smoked meat here. If you're smart, you'll go meat-heavy...wings, ribs, etc. If you're cool, you'll get the goat neck.""Well, I always go meat-heavy, and I've always wanted to be cool, so we got that goat neck.* A seriously hearty portion for two, this cut is fatty and delicious. There's so much meat on this thing that I wish I had a bit more of the glaze that was on the outside for a dipping sauce, but we cleaned it down to the bone anyway. The cocunut rice below is buttery as hell, but a nice accompaniment to the tender meat just the same. As far as I can tell, just about everything Ducks serves is damn good. The wings are very well-executed, and I hoovered up the leavings of my friend's duck and waffle as well, and the flavor was outstanding. The jerky was interesting, if not something I'd revisit, and I can't wait to come back for the ribs. I love ribs. Thanks for a great meal Ducks, and please get some air conditioning. _____________*Unfortunately, my wife has since informed me that I am not cool, and especially not because some bartender goaded me into eating a goat neck.",16,19,14

For only 3 people, we ordered a ton: crispy pig ears, dehydrated short rib and smoked whole goat neck. The crispy pig ears were good but nothing really amazing. The dehydrated short rib was a pretty big rib with lots of meat on it -- the mint vinegar it was served with was delicious!! The goat neck was HUGE and fall-of-the-bone tender with great flavor that wasn't too overwhelming with spices. The whole meal was delicious! Although the others in my group loved the goat neck -- I absolutely loved the beef rib. I'm a sucker for beef ribs!!",3,2,2

We ordered two cocktails to start. Duck buck which was great with the ginger and the Paloma which is in a tiny glass but packs a lot of punch. Strong and bitter, which I liked. We got the shrimp and grits and added an egg. It came with sausage and three heads of a shrimp, but two little pieces of shrimp were inside. Basically a bowl of grits for $16 plus the add on for the egg at $1.50. Kind of a let down. Ordered the beignet and chocolates. They were hard and not actual beignets.

Be a little adventurous and you won't be disappointed!!I ended up going by myself on a Tuesday night, which is brisket night, so they were quite packed. Plus there was a big group there for a company dinner. The placed is pretty small....so be warned you might have to wait. I ended up waiting a little over an hour, but it was well worth it. The guys running the place were all very nice, checking in on me and made sure that I got a table when one came open. It gave you the feeling of a bunch of friends that just love food and opened a place together.I had the St. Louis ribs, and a burnt-end rice dish. The ribs were excellent! Perfectly prepared, with a little bit of fat and lots of flavor. The rice dish was pretty good, but had a little too much picked ingredients for my taste, but I was so full from the ribs that I wasn't phased.It has a relaxing atmosphere, great service, full bar, and some great food. The only disadvantage to going alone, was that I didn't have anyone to share with as there were so many things I wanted to try! Will definitely visit again the next time I'm in NYC!",1,,

After watching their episode on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and reading the great reviews about this place, we were excited to finally try it. We're fatties so we ordered fat on meat on fat on meat - the bone marrow, ribs and the goat neck. The ribs came out first, the spices were good but the actual rib was a little dry for my taste. Keep in mind their bone marrow recipe has changed. It is no longer topped with ricotta but replaced with a strong fishy anchovy taste. After our first bite we thought the bone marrow tasted spoiled.  We actually called our waiter over and he explained he's received the complaint from other customers as well. The goat curry came out next, the flavor was on point but the dish itself is very heavy and oily so I was only able to enjoy a few bites. The standout from the entire meal was the rice! I guess that's a compliment coming from an Asian.",1,,

A friend and I ordered the Red Beans n Rice ($12) and St Louis Ribs ($13), and both of them tasted so good. The star of the night was the ribs, where the hickory smoke dry rub for the ribs was so ingrained in the meat and even the texture of the rub seemingly tasted good. The meat is cooked to perfection and was so tender. The restaurant is a small cozy area with a warm glow from the lights and candles, an ideal environment for a date, if that's what you're looking for. I would definitely come back here again.",1,,

The meat (pull pork style) was so tender and tasty, I also love the crispy pig skin. Friendly staffs and pretty good service. Cons:This is a small restaurant and tight spaces between tables.Not sure if it was because we went on a 3rd straight day of the summer heatwave, the place didn't seem to have strong enough AC. It was way too warm inside and we were all sweating during the whole dinner. However, I still give 4 stars because the good yummy food made up for it.",,,

Their menu is made from fusion spices, unique ingredients, and prices that match it's portions. I had their Duck n Waffle which was surprisngly disgusting. The meat was cooked well but I didn't like the soggy KFC type skin as well as this black liquorice pepper spice blended thoughout the whole dish. Even the soggy waffle underneathe was nasty. I didn't like the spices blended within this dish. They could've totally made it much better! for $28 I was pissed off.

Jerky: He was a fan, but I found this stringy and overly chewy. I wouldn't order this again.2. Meat charcuterie plate: This was pretty good overall. The quail eggs were a disconcerting shade of green, but the smoked meats, duck butter, and andouille sausage were standouts. This doesn't come with enough bread, though, so we ended up having to ask for a second portion of bread. The second portion of bread came out crazy-burnt, which rendered about half of the bread inedible.3. Chicken wings: These were crazy good! I'd definitely get these again. The sauce is perfect, and the flavor is phenomenal. These were actually a mid-meal addition to our order, because we smelled another table's wings and had to try them for ourselves (that tells you a lot, I think, about how good these wings smell).We ordered the following entrees:1. Duck and waffle (him): He was a huge fan of this, and pronounced the duck and syrup both phenomenal.2. St. Louis ribs (me): I thought these were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I'd probably go with something else next time.We had the following drinks: 1. 12th Street Sour (him): He liked this. I didn't try it.2. Wooly Jumper (me): I was a fan of this cocktail, and would definitely have had another if we weren't outdoors and I didn't want a cold beverage in the rain.Honestly, this would have been a solid four star review, but something really irritating happened. We originally wanted to order the dehydrated short rib for a starter, but we told it was out. About halfway through our meal, I noticed that the couple next to us seemed to have this dish (and they'd sat down after us, and obviously ordered after us, as well). I asked, and confirmed that they did indeed have the dehydrated short rib. So, either our waiter lied to us (unlikely), or he didn't have any real idea of what was and wasn't available (highly probable). In either case, it was mildly irritating in that we didn't get to order something we wanted to try, even though it was apparently available.",,,

Immediately upon arriving the bartender seemed rude but I figured he might be busy so I let it go. About 15 minutes after being seated someone came by who couldn't remember the happy hour specials but wanted to let us know all the kegs were kicked (how does that even happen? Simultaneously?). We eventually got our food order in, settled in to chat and around 7:30 realized there was nothing coming our way - even though the two tables around us (who had been seated after us) got theirs and the waiter had asked if it was ok that two dishes came out before the rest. We weren't even a large group - a 4 top. We flagged down our server, who seemed genuinely confused, and then had him return and tell us they were out of what we ordered - despite the table next to us getting it - without even some apology. The space is also tiny so when I say the table next to us I mean literally next to us - in order to leave they had to move. I don't know what's going on with the service but after an expensive cocktail hour we decided to leave. My friend put it best ""that looked like some great food, too bad I'll never be back to try it"". There's too many good restaurants within just 5 blocks of this one to even bother wasting your time hoping you get a ""good"" night.

The food may have actually been pretty good, but the service and other things threw us off a bit. The wait for the food was pretty long, but the waiter made sure we knew they were working as fast as they could. I loved the decor (recycled chairs maybe?), but at the same time didn't; it's a cozy space and the set up felt a little cramped especially since the chef tripped on my chair as he went to greet someone at the table next to ours...We ordered the Duck and Waffle, Yakamein Soup and Red Beans with Rice. I personally liked the Duck and Waffle, perhaps the best dish out of the three. The duck was flavorful and paired well with their unique pesto and puree. It wasn't amazing, but they made it right. My friend thought the Yakamein Soup was good, but the flavor wasn't as strong as she would've liked, maybe just a preference thing. My other friend just didn't like her Red Beans with Rice. I don't think having it served in a plastic Chinese bowl complete with the plastic spoon helped either.

100,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11026,4.0,6/17/2015,"So I made a mistake. I had Ducks Eatery bookmarked because they were crowned 2014 Brisket King of NYC, but I didn't order the brisket. It was even brisket night (Tuesday). So basically, I'm a failure.However, whenever the Duck Gods close a door, they open a window. And that window was a selection of other delicious meats.Not quite sure what Ducks Eatery is. I mean, Yelp says they're French. There was a sloppily drawn fleur-de-lis on their chalkboard, so I guess it has some French influence. They were serving food out of those Asian bowls you get at Chinese restaurants. And the menu had a lot of BBQ, so kind of southern. Let's just call it fusion to be safe.Onto the food.For starters, we had happy hour oysters (Rocky Points at $1.50 apiece). They came in these giant pots full of ice and were pretty good.Also had the crispy pig ears, which were in these little lettuce wraps with a sweet sauce (like hoisin sauce you get with Peking duck). They were also good, if you're not one of those weirdos who gets creeped out by texture.Decided to do three ""small plates"" just to try things out. We couldn't leave a place called Ducks Eatery without trying some duck so we went with the Smoked Duck Salad. Let me just say that ""small plates"" was a misnomer. It was a heaping plate of greens, apples, and black rice. All with thinly sliced delicious smoked duck on top.Our last plate was the bone marrow. Incredibly buttery with ricotta and for some reason, oysters. But it all worked out. Delicious, and probably the biggest bone marrow I've ever seen.All in all, just a few small complaints. Seating is a bit tight, and the tables are too close together. So waiters and other patrons will inevitably bump into you, which is annoying. They also advertise that they have cocktail specials for happy hour, but it's really just one drink - the Duck Buck. It's decent, but I didn't want another one.Would definitely come back to try the goat's neck curry or the brisket, as it seems that's what they're known for! I'll return with an appetite!",1,1,

One of the biggest bone marrow I've had. They also don't charge for extra bread. EntreesYakamein soup was southern american and asian fusion. The noodles tasted like Japanese ramen and were extremely well cooked and chewy. The broth was a bit sour though... The best part were the clams- super juicy and sweet.  It made me wish I ordered the clams instead. Ribs were dry and hard to eat. Duck & waffle was definitely a MUST TRY. The duck was a bit over fried, but the pumpkin waffle was very fluffy and tasty. The parsley cream didn't mix well but the waffles were so amazing it made the dish worth it.",1,,

It's a BBQ themed restaurant (surprise surprise) so everyone better be on board to go meat heavy.It's a small and quite compact place so I'd recommend coming in with just a few people. Sure, they can seat large groups, but make sure you make a reservation and prepare yourselves to be tightly squeezed. I also came during a snowstorm and though they projected a fireplace on the brick walls, it was actually really cold inside. I wore my jacket the entire time I was eating. Pickle jar - will help cut the fatty contents from the rest of the meal. A palate cleanser almost.Rainbow trout salad: Get it if you want a salad to start. It's salty, tarty, fresh and interesting. I didn't think pomegranate seeds, kale and smoked trout would work, but it does. Or Ducks Eatery makes it work let's say.Chicken wings - MUST. Chicken wings with a jerk rub like you've never had before. Tastes smokey enough to trick you into thinking you're eating ribs, but you're not. I'm not saying it's jerk chicken, but it's a play on Jamaican and all-american BBQ flavors. Sticky, messy and delicious. Also our waiter was extremely considerate and gave us an extra wing to accommodate the number of people in our group :)Rice and beans - this is not your ordinary grandma rice and beans. Beans are definitely cooked in smoked BBQ meat flavors because it comes through. Hearty and homey. I love it.We also ordered a bottle of Grenache to go with our meal which was perfect.

For food we ordered:Brisket: Did the half lean/half fatty - I was hesitant to do the fatty but it was definitely the better of the two. It's not like fat you find on a steak (chewy and you don't want to eat it) it's just super tender and falls apart in your mouth. (only available on Tuesdays) Pig's Ear: HIGHLIGHT of the show. I would never had ordered this but the person I went with did and it was amazing. It comes in lettuce wraps and small crispy pieces of pig. They are just seasoned amazing - go out of the box and try this! *highly recommend* Goat's Neck: First time also trying this and didn't love it, didn't hate it.

110,James W.,"New York, NY",165,276,401,2.0,6/17/2015,"I came here for brunch this past weekend. After reading the Yelp reviews, I was excited to see what all of the rave was surrounding the famous pumpkin waffles and buttermilk fried duck. As someone who is a big fan of fried chicken and waffles, I could not wait to feast on a tweaked version of the classic fried chicken and waffles. The dish was conceptually interesting, but failed in its taste. The pumpkin waffles were delicious (very pumpkin-inny tasty), but the buttermilk fried duck was so salty that it overpowered the waffles. Salt was all I could taste in the dish. I finally had to just eat the duck and the waffle separately, which defeats the purpose of pairing the two onto the same plate. When I eat fried chicken and waffles, I love eating the two together slathered in gravy and maple syrup. The combination just works! But, I'm not sure what went wrong here.    Pumpkin waffles and buttermilk fried duck is like the ""ugly cousin"" to the class chicken on waffles. It tries too hard and it's awkward. However, I liked the restaurant's ambiance, and I'll admit that the menu has some interesting dishes that I would like to come back to try.",,,

Updated review","I tell everyone this is one of my favorite restaurants. I have not been unhappy with any of their dishes. Some may not be my favorite, but it's just personal taste and not execution. Service is always lovely and everyone always had a smile on their faces. I finally made my way over for brunch and the boy had shrimp and grits while I had the eggs Pontchartrain. My dish was perfectly executed. Poached eggs with runny yolks, super crispy skin on the trout while still being moist (especially for such a lean fish), the sweet potato hash was roasted and slightly sweet.  The hollandaise was flavorful and brought it all together.  That being said....i was jealous of his dish. It was a small pot worth of grits with halved mini  heirloom tomatoes, three huge shrimp with heads on and chorizo chunks. He kindly have me some but I wanted him to eat (aren't I nice?). So I tried to keep my jealousy to myself. Definitely getting this next time.",3,1,2

114,Joan H.,"New York, NY",208,484,3,5.0,12/27/2016,"OK, every goddamn thing on this menu is AMAZING.  Just pick anything or everything and you won't be disappointed. Cocktails are also lots of fun here and the bartenders love to experiment - so go nuts with the beverages as well. Love the exposed brick, cozy atmosphere.  Tables are tight - but it's a lovely place to catch up with good friends, or a romantic spot (but don't go if you're worried about getting your hands dirty).  GOAT NECK is a must try.",2,,
115,Catherine H.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,11/15/2017,"Ducks is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Every single item I've ever had off the menu has been amazing. The goat's neck and red beans and rice are dangerously good. The Duck Buck and Paloma are refreshing, delicious and go wonderfully with the whole menu. It's worth saving room for dessert if you can, the pot de creme is totally worth it.",,,
116,Mariam B.,"Vancouver, Canada",338,154,122,5.0,5/13/2016,"Okay this place is getting 5 stars because of the goat neck dish. It was amazing!!!! So tender and the coconut rice was the perfect compliment. I was so taken aback by how amazing this dish was! Just get it. Please ! I mean the chicken wings are good, but only 4 come with the serving so I don't know if it's worth it. The waffles and cornbread were recommended by the waiter but again, it was nothing compared to the goats neck. In summary, get the goats neck with coconut rice. It will blow your mind!",,,
117,Oriana S.,"New York, NY",141,45,240,3.0,2/26/2017,"Second time  here but this time for  brunch.  Come here early ! They don't take reservations for less than 4 people . It's a really small restaurant so prepare to be close to strangers . Server and bartender were pretty nice ! My boyfriend and I shared the biscuits with honey butter, which were a flaky like a pastry . I'm used to having fluffy , soft biscuits so these were okay . He had the brisket hash with sweet potatoes and red potatoes . Flavor was great but the brisket was a little dry and over cooked . My shrimp and grits were good but the Sausage was tough to bite into . I had a mimosa which I wasn't a fan of because I barely tasted the calamansi juice . Overall ok but a little disappointed compared to the great food for dinner . This place is great for dinner , not so much for brunch .",,,
118,Isabella S.,"San Francisco, CA",464,184,61,3.0,2/5/2016,"I'm really struggling here. It seems harsh to give Ducks Eatery 3 stars, but my experience here last weekend really didn't warrant 4. Duck's is a cozy little spot that you makes you feel all warm inside the moment you step in. Candle lit and tightly spaced, it is perfect for a date or smaller parties. I came here with a girlfriend and we settled in to catch up on our lives lately. We ordered the pig ears, which I really really really wanted to like, but they were literally fried to a CRISP, and not in a good way. It reminded me of that dramatic scene from Harry Potter where Voldemort screamed in excruciating pain before dissolving into sand. (Did I just make that up???) At 25 going on 52 I actually had trouble chewing the hardened bits. My canines definitely didn't like me that day. While pretty, the red cabbage and the green lettuce didn't really complement the pig ears in any effective way. They were probably just as confused as I was as to why they were there. Still, my Yakamein Soup was pretty solid. The broth was hot and heavy and the few fat clams swimming in it made me really happy.Maybe I'll come back to try something else. Maybe something duck to honor the namesake. Until then, 3 stars. Sorry, Duck.",1,1,1
119,Jacqueline L.,"San Diego, CA",102,199,232,4.0,5/10/2015,"Ducks Eatery, a bohemian vibe type of restaurant, had a nice brunch menu to offer. It was a beautiful day so all open doors, nice music playing, and good service made this a  pleasant meal. Out of the four of us who went, 2 loved their meals, 1 liked, and 1 thought so so.The Bloody Mary's were great, although the okra needed to be a bit more pickled, it still had a bit of that slimy feel inside. The eggs Benedict with ricotta cheese was awesome and I asked that they make it on a biscuit which they did (!!), and it was also baked really well and the overall meal had a sage/lemony bite to it which I really enjoyed. The brisket in the hash was good on its own but overall that dish not mesh well together. The shrimp and grits were tasty but they did serve a lot of actual grits, and they could tone the amount down.",,,
120,Jane V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/16/2017,"Love this place and recommend it any day. Their happy hour is the best, which is a huge afterwork plus before work week dinners. Having searched the city far and wide for happy hours, this one is the best, with creative, delicious cocktails that are also affordable (instead of the standard ""well drink"" happy hour boredom around a lot of the city). Besides having a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere, and a menu basically full of all things that I love (especially the wings, my fave, and the clams, to die for), the cocktails never disappoint. I'm a little biased, to be fair, but I absolutely love it here and look forward to stuffing my face here and savoring their drinks whenever possible.",,,

Reservations at 5pm and when we arrived  the staff was very pleasant. Our server did an excellent job describing the menu from our cocktails to our meal. The Goat neck is a MUST it surpassed my expectation indeed (I was a tad skeptical) the meat fell right off the bone and the coconut rice was wonderful. The mussels and clams were SPOT on with a delicious smoked taste that was not overpowering. This was a perfect amount of food for sharing. We enjoyed the menu and the cocktails and will recommend to others! A very enjoyable evening.",,,
122,Alice M.,"Queens, NY",164,19,33,3.0,7/31/2016,"3.5 stars. Came here for a Friday dinner date after working out. He got a pale ale and I unintentionally opted for a strong tequila cocktail called the patonera.We shared the ribs, duck and waffles, collard greens, and local mushrooms. The highlight was the ribs. They really hit the spot and were on the fatty side which I loved. Per the signature duck and waffles: the duck underwhelmed me but my partner loved it. We both liked the pate it came with. And the jam-ifed waffle which doubled as a delicious dessert! The sides were nothing special and were overly salty. Overall, I wasn't wowed given the price (over $90 pre tip) nor the wait for food after we ordered. I'd still come back to try the goat neck over rice, and get a sweeter cocktail!",,,

We also got the smoked brisket hash (very good!) and the benedict de Marie Laveau (also very good, although I found the country ham to be more like prosciutto, which I don't love). But the beignets... to die for.SERVICEOur server was awesome--helpful, fun, and just the right amount of attentive. One of the better services that I've had recently.AMBIANCEWe sat outside, which was nice.

126,Alan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,681,3400,4.0,12/30/2014,"I came for my 27th birthday. Woohoo!! This restaurant is quite small, but has very nice, cozy feeling to me. Dimmed lights to make the evening lovely for any group. The menu is quite unique. You will see some dishes that pop up in your eyes and makes you think, ""really."" The ones that made me think was the goats neck and bone marrow. Makes you want to get adventurous. Since it was my birthday, I didn't want to get to adventurous. Maybe a little. We started off with small plates dishes.Started with Rocky Point Oysters- jalapeño mignonette. It was happy hour, so every oyster was $1 each. Sweet!!! This is an amazing start off my dinner. The oysters were so fresh. Very briny. Delicious oysters. Made me say Mmmm...Next came the Crispy Pig Ears- bibb, lingham's hot sauce. pickled cabbage, sesame. Very crispy with a little heat and vinagery taste. I like the idea of using the cabbage has a wrap. It was quite good to me. The Smoked Mussels with chili oil, house cultured smoked butter, toast, maple, chive. The mussels are served and put in a sardine can. It had a fresh salty ocean taste with a slight hint of spices. The Bone Marrow- smoked wild oysters, salt cured blood orange, whipped ricotta. Holy moly!! That is a huge bone marrow. Comes with oysters on top. It was creamy and buttery. There is a lot of bone marrow flesh. The dish was okay to me though it didn't really bring out the bone marrow.Onto the big plates.The Chicken Wings- hickory smoke, jerk rub, lime. Yummy wings. It was smokey, tons of flavor, juicy, and crispy. The Yakamein Soup- brisket, clams, sora noodles, pickled greens, coconut milk. After having so many savory dishes, this was the perfect dish to end it. Some how my meal turned asian because we got asian bowls and chopsticks. Lots of noodles in the bowl. The broth had a good vinagery and sour taste to it. It also had a little kick to it. Nice and flavorful bowl of noodles. The service was good and on point. Dishes came out right away as soon as we finish a dish. The dishes were also presented very nicely. The restaurant is more like a tapas place. Definitely share the dishes. A place for an adventurous meal. A very lovely Birthday meal for me. I shall return to try out the brunch menu one day.",1,,1

128,Katherine R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,0,1.0,7/4/2017,"This place was disappointing in terms of food and service. Appetizers came after entrees, and we were repeatedly asked ""are you still working"" while mid-eating and mid-conversation. I have much respect for service industry professionals and hope this doesn't sound jerky.. I just feel like a cardinal rule is you don't cut people off in the middle of a sentence and that happened like 3 times, again  hope this doesn't sound rude, we weren't a high maintenance group I don't think and we ordered enough drinks and food that I didn't think it was warranted to try to rush us out with so much food still on the table.

129,La V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,4,2.0,3/3/2018,"I tried really hard to like this place. Our waiter was great and the drinks were great, but we couldn't eat several of our dishes because they were just so bad. I hope it was just an off night for the chef. The smoked mussels were cold, the celery root was fishy, the ribs were fatty and not very flavorful, the red beans and rice was just awful - the rice was uncooked and the rest of the dish was like licking straight cumin with no salt. On the positive side, that cantaloupe burger was something out of this world. Go here, order 2 of the cantaloupe burgers and some drinks and get dinner elsewhere. Sorry.",,,

131,Wahed K.,"Astoria, NY",669,759,1573,4.0,9/14/2015,"I have been here once for brunch and once for dinner.  I can't remember the last time I had brunch at a place where every single item was good but that's how it was at Duck's Eatary and despite my fear of this being another celebrity endorsed, over-hyped joint, these guys delivered. My first time there was with a group of 10, which is really tough to do at this place because they are TINY but they were able to accommodate us. We took turns in trying each other plates. I tried the Benedict de Marie Laveou, Pumpkin Waffle with buttermilk fried duck and the Smoked Brisket Hash. They all had good flavors and and smoked brisket hash got a few oohs and aahs at our table. I wasn't entirely convinced by the buttermilk fried duck but I think I can be made to come around for that. Duck has a very distinct flavor and I feel like frying it takes some of that away but what do I know? I'm just a yelper.The brunch inspired me to come back for dinner and order the whole wild hare which serves 2-3 people and needs to be pre-ordered at least a week in advance. I believe it is first grilled and then roasted. The sauce that's on it tastes like the same sauce that's on their buffalo chicken wings. It has a deep, rich smokey flavor and I think I would like anything you put this sauce on. The dish came with wild mushrooms, among other veggies, and I think they were even better than the rabbit itself. Since our dinner party had a group of 4 and the rabbit dish only serves 2-3 (really just 2), we also tried their buffalo chicken wings, pig ears and the smoked whole goat neck which also serves two. You kinda eat the pig ears like a taco by wrapping them in a pickled cabbage leaf. Different from the Chinese way I'm used to having but good. We had gotten the smoked whole goat neck after reading all the great reviews on this site but it was ultimately a let down. The flavor of the yellow curry was weak could have been better developed. The coconut rice should be more flavorful as well. I would definitely recommend this place. Just need to watch the size of your group as they are pretty small. Service wise, they were great and there are enough good dishes here to make multiple trips.",5,2,4

133,Michael M.,"Union County, NJ",1997,134,823,4.0,8/15/2015,"Ducks Eatery is an awesome place.      I was looking for a nice quaint restaurant in the east village to celebrate my birthday and I found out through a yelp friend about Ducks Eatery.  After reading her informative review and seeing some pictures of some great looking dishes I made 8pm reservations on a Thursday night for a party of four.  Upon my arrival I was greeted by a friendly hostess who had a table waiting.      Ducks is a very cozy and relaxed eatery.  Their tables are small enough to accommodate a party of  two.  If your party is larger I recommend you make a reservation.  They also offer outdoor dining in the warmer months. For appetizers we went with: Shrimp Chips,  They are a light fluffy chip that taste like shrimp. Price $5.00.Rocky Point Oysters with jalapeño mignonette.  They are 3 per serving at the price of $8.00.Hickory Smoked Chicken Wings, with a jerk rub, lime and cilantro garnish. Price $12.00.  All were excellent but as for the shrimp chips I could have done without.For entrees we went with:Goat's Neck served as a portion for two, but if your appetite is hearty, the portion is good for one.  It's seasoned with yellow curry and bing cherries over coconut rice. Price $ 34.00 and worth it.  The meat is so tender, it falls right off the bone.St Louis Ribs that are hickory smoked with a dry rub. Price $13.00. Very good.Side's:Nasi Ulam, fried shrimp and rice seasoned in fine herbs, coconut and sambal.  Price $8.00. It was packed with a lot of flavor. Collard Greens made with Benton's Bacon.  The flavor of the bacon consumed the entire dish.  It was delicious. Price $ 7.00.Cocktails:  I had the ""Currant Farmers Market"" which is seasonal and made with blueberry jam, red currants and gin.  Very flavorful drink. Price $ 14.00.I also had the Watermelon Gimlet cocktail.  It's made with Gin, watermelon, lavender and lime.  It's another seasonal drink on the menu and worth the $12.00.  Dessert: I had the Beignets.  Which are a fried dough shaped like a pillow and alone tastes like a zeppole.  It comes with a rich chocolate espresso spread that is delicious. Four pieces per serving.  Price $6.00.I was pleased with my experience and would definitely return in the future so I can try other options on the menu.",41,27,39

Heavenly, just tender, luscious goodness), smoked pot de crème is my favorite dessert now and the beignets were perfecttt pillows with a killer espresso chocolate sauce.

The bartender was great and some of the wait staff were super friendly. Even though they took longer to seat us than they originally anticipated which I guess we did go on a Saturday night. But still, we had to ask them 15 minutes AFTER our original time.A few things happened that were irritating:1. We took our seats at the bar during our wait. Within minutes, my date and I were asked to move a few seats down make space for an incoming group. Um, could have easily moved that group to the other end. (Being the two black people there, not sure they realized how this looked. But we did, and we definitely side-eyed.)2. Trying to rush us out after dinner in the most tactless way.

138,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,4.0,7/21/2015,"It's very telling that while I was eating here, I was already making plans to come back. First of all, what kind of restaurant is this? French? Cajun? Fusion? BBQ? Heck if I know, but the food was delicious! We started with happy hour oysters at $1.50 a piece, which doesn't beat all the dollar oyster places, but they were still good. Instead of doing mains, we shared some small plates. We did the crispy pig ears, the smoked duck salad, and the bone marrow with oysters. The crispy pig ears, which we chose since it sounded interesting, came chopped up on Asian-style lettuce wraps. They were good, but I'm not sure if I'd do those again. After a while, the crunchy-chewy texture was getting cumbersome to eat. Smoked duck salad was a huge portion of greens, black rice, yummy black garlic, and apples, with a layer of thin slices of smoked duck. Definitely a winner, and both filling and refreshing. I pretty much have to order bone marrow when it's on the menu, and this one did not disappoint. Two large bones with lovely puffs of ricotta and topped with smoked oysters. Basically three things I love all on the same plate. How could this ever go wrong? I do have to take off a star though, because the atmosphere kind of sucks. The music was blasting way too loud and was giving me a headache. Also, seating is extremely tight and uncomfortable. To top it off, the servers had some spacial issues and kept knocking into my chair when they went past me. I must have grabbed for my bag at least 5 times as a server plowed into my seat back. Seriously dude. I'm ready to throw some serious elbow action if you keep giving me whiplash.Definitely going back for the brisket (only on Tuesdays!) and goat neck curry.

Updated review","First thing first. The food amazing. Shrimp chips, oysters, bone marrow, duck and waffles and finally the goats neck. The bone marrow was succulent. Just so tasty, I wish we had had more of it. So good. The duck and waffles was good--the liver butter and waffles were unreal. I found the duck a bit over cooked. It wasn't bad I just didn't feel like I could die a happy woman with the duck as my last meal. The goats neck. That was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Why have I not had that before?  This place is easily a 4-5 star place. Why only 3 stars? I'll tell you. I called to make a reservation for 3 people on a Monday night. I was told that since it was a Monday night it would not be a problem. Guess what? It was a problem. I got there get and was told that  we would have to be out  by 8. I'm livid about this. I could have lied and made a reservation for 4 when we were 3 but i opted not to. (That's not how I roll) We ended up sitting outside so it was fine but I found it annoying.  Next time to avoid being annoyed I'll say I have a party of 4.  Great food though.",1,2,

142,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,4.0,7/8/2015,"I'd heard of Ducks for awhile now, but never realize that it was this place.  For some reason the signage doesn't really stand out to me and it is sort of a small place.  Regardless it is nice in a casual way, especially the outdoor seating area in front.  This is perfect for brunch on a sunny day--which is exactly what I was here for.  Service was friendly and effective without hovering too much.  Beer selection was pretty good; I kept things simple and grabbed an IPA form Schlafly that was good.  While I expected Ducks to be decent, it definitely exceeded my expectations; this is a good example of the kind of great place Yelp can help you dig up that you might miss otherwise!For my meal I got the Head-On Shrimp & Grits, which also included homemade andouille sausage, cheddar cheese, heirloom tomatoes and scallions.  To make it even more gluttonous and thus helpful to my diet, I added a fried egg.  While I wasn't wild about the head on part (doesn't bother me but awkward to eat) the dish itself was great.  First and foremost the grits were great and the shrimp were large.  The andouille was exceptional, and added a great flavor contrast along with the tomatoes.  My friend got the Benton's Bacon Benedict, which included an english muffin with poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and maple sweet potato home fries.  The bacon was thick cut and serious stuff, but the sweet potato home fries stole the show.  I wonder why more restaurants don't offer sweet potato home fries instead of their white, starchy counterparts.Very impressed with brunch; this is a good choice if you're doing a non-boozy brunch and/or are on a date.  You can also definitely tell the place is owned by Jews given how kosher-friendly this is.  Jokes aside, the menu is legitimately interested and a bit off the wall (there's a dish named Deez Nuts) which is right up my alley.  I will be revisiting for dinner and I may bump this up then.",3,1,1
143,Olivia C.,"Rockville, MD",725,215,507,4.0,7/12/2014,"Come early and come hungry. This was on my list of places to check out  because I was interested in the goat neck for two (curried and over rice) YET after we saw everyone ordering the crawfish special (we went on a Thursday night) my friend and I had to.  To start, the wait wasn't too painful- slightly busier dinner time rush but hostess was super attentive.  We got some diet comes and the carbonation seemed a bit so we switched it out no problem.  We got an order of the pickles (okra, string beans, watermelons, etc) which I wish was a bit saltier and less sour and the ingredients were interesting but probably will not order for myself next time.Ordered some chicken wings and even though they looked a little burnt...they were amazing!  Spices cooked right into the crispy skin while the meat was juicy.  It was like a marriage of tangy Thai spices with the gentle embrace of a Caribbean  breeze...if it's too busy next time, I will try to get a to go order.The crawfish was spicy but just right! My dining partner and I had to rush to sooth our burning mouths with ice cream afterwards but it's probably bc we were taking full advantage of the flavorboom broth.  Seriously insane but in such a good way.  Corn was super sweet, potatoes were just the right size, and the pot for two was plenty. I trust ducks eatery will keep up the good work because I can't wait to try everything else :)",1,,

The duck and waffles were unique and stood out on its own with the tender meat and tasty accompaniments like the parsley butter sweetened with honey. A definite must - try to change things up from the typical chicken and waffles!!",,,

146,Muhammad H.,"Brooklyn, NY",50,77,55,5.0,1/1/2017,This place is amazing. I saw it on DDD so I had to go check it out. I got the slow roasted goat neck over rice. It was amazing. So full of flavor. It was a lot to eat. I'll definitely be coming back for a second round of it.,,,
147,Rena Y.,"Calgary, Canada",134,159,765,4.0,6/25/2015,"Ducks Eatery is a great little restaurant to try out nose-to-tail dining. Unpretentious, with a warm, LES-esque ambiance, the menu is not typical of the neighbourhood.Here you'll find crispy pig's ear prepared sliced, fried, marinated and wrapped up in perfect pieces of butter lettuce. Also notable, if not the headliner, is the bone marrow dish, served roasted, gelatinous and hearty, with a sprinkling of smoked oysters and a delectable white cream sauce. We also had the fried duck with waffles. It was a fresh take on the overdone fad of fried chicken and waffles. The parsley butter with honey, topped cold, balanced the salty, meaty punch of duck and the sweet waffles. Give this place a try! It will be memorable at the very least.",2,,1
148,Raymond H.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,280,176,4.0,10/14/2016,"I was honestly trying to go elsewhere on a Friday night, but the wait at the other restaurant was going to be a minimum of thirty minutes, so we took the trek to Ducks Eatery and got seated for two without a wait. We were debating between getting the goat neck and the duck waffles, but we settled on the goat neck. The special of the night was brisket so we also decided to order some of that. The brisket was okay as I have had much better. The goat neck though, wow, that was a winner. The coconut rice was just delicious and had occasional clumps that were crunchy which added a nice texture. The goat neck itself was just heavenly. It was just beyond tender and just so flavorful. Definitely worth getting if you decide to come to Ducks Eatery. Overall, I'd say it was 4 star worthy because of the 3 star brisket and the 5 star goat neck.",,,
149,Anju M.,"Manhattan, NY",21,144,120,3.0,6/25/2016,"This should be 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow half stars. After coming here just for drinks and smelling all the deliciousness in the restaurant, I went back for dinner. They don't take reservations for groups less than four, so my boyfriend and I showed up at 8 pm hoping to snag a patio table. The hostess said 5-10 minutes for the wait, so we decided to just have a drink at the bar while we waited. 10 minutes passed by, and we saw two tables open up. But we weren't seated. Then the hostess almost sat us at a table outside before apologizing and saying there's one more group ahead of us. To her credit, she did bring out a complementary charcuterie plate. I would give five stars for that: I especially liked the duck sausage and the cheese. When we finally got seated, we ordered the ribs, collard greens and cornbread. The ribs were delicious but there was let much meat attached to the bones! A lot of it was fat. The cornbread was extremely salty. I couldn't have more than two bites at a time.I'd say the collard green was the best dish of the three - not salty, but perfectly steamed. And the touch of bacon (also high in fat) added good flavor. When we got the bill, they accidentally charged us for two extra drinks we never had - bough they did sincerely apologize and corrected the problem very quickly. Always check your bill!Overall, the atmosphere is great on a Friday night, and it's nice to dine outside in East Village and watch all the people walk by. I like their cocktail list as well.",2,,

I've tried everything on the menu for those days except the granola. Ive only gotten a drink once but it was the kiwi one and it was great. Everything is honestly amazing.My two favorites:Eggs ponchatrain- perfectly cooked trout with poached eggs and the most delicious creole hollandaise. Shrimp and grits- the creamy most flavorful and amazing grits I've ever had. I could eat bowls full. Very filling!The pumpkin waffle with the fried duck is definitely rich but not overly sweet. The duck is always super tender and perfectly fried. There portions are very generous.I've honestly never had anything here I didn't love. There is one server who always works lunch and she's awesome. Their coffee is also French press I believe and it's really good also free refills so that's nice. The outdoor seating is a nice option because the inside is a bit dark even during the day. The decor and general atmosphere is cool though. I like their plating style. It's rustic but still fun. Love this place and I will definitely go try their dinner menu soon.,,,

I have lived almost upstairs from here for a year and have been wanting to go in for months. Finally, my two roommates and I went around the corner and sat at the bar. We didn't get a friendly smile, we were ignored when we asked the specials and when we asked questions about the speciality drinks, we didn't get the correct answers. I asked if the margarita that had habanero in it was spicy Bc I was looking for spicy and he said yes. It was so sweeeeeet. And, my roommate got an apple pie old fashion? And, it just tasted like an Evan Williams old fashion. We originally went because we googled the cocktail menu and we were sadly disappointed. My other roommate enjoyed the oysters on special and the wine on special. We started to get hungry, but the service was so uncomfortable and rude- we left and went around the corner. Maybe I'd come again if I got another bartender.",,,

156,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,3/25/2015,"COME ONE, COME ALL! Actually, on second thought, maybe don't. This place is SMALL. So maybe just come two at a time. Regardless, come here, people. This place was packed at 8:30 on a Tuesday night. When we arrived, there was a 20 minute wait, but we were fortunate enough to find two seats at the bar. I ordered the Duck Buck (bourbon, sweet ginger, calamansi, soda) which was simple yet great. I of course had to ask what ""calamansi"" was (it looks like ""calamari"" at first glance so I was a bit perturbed), If you're curious, it's a kind of citrus fruit. I also tried the Dandylion (rye, yellow chartreuse, lemon, peychauds float), which was a speakeasy-grade cocktail. Very different from the first. I'd definitely recommend if you're a rye drinker.Quick note on the ambiance before I get to the main event: Yes, this place is pretty cramped. I had to be very aware of my personal items at all times in order to avoid smacking fellow patrons in the face with them. Other than that, the feel in this place has an awesome vibe. I'd say it's trendy but down to earth. Tables are close together (if you didn't get that already) but I didn't feel like I was all up in anyone else's business. The service is top notch too. Our server told us that we were very fortunate to have come on a Tuesday night, for Tuesday night is brisket night! He said we wouldn't regret ordering it, so we did - more on that in a moment. Food came out and was cleared quickly. No complaints there.Now for the food! It was so difficult to decide. We are two people who really really love food and really really love trying everything that we possibly can, so the decision was not an easy one. My dining companion had been here once and tried the goat neck (raved about it) so we ruled that out for novelty's sake. NOTE: you do not *need* to do the whole shared plates thing here, but it's highly recommended. So everything was to split. We ended up getting the special brisket (half fatty, half lean), the smoked mussels, and the collard greens with bacon. Everything was amazing, but I need to give a special shoutout to the MUSSELS. I grew up going to Martha's Vineyard and getting mussels fresh out of the water - no preparation, very bare bones. These are unlike any mussels you have ever had. First: they are smoked and served *cold*, and they come with toast topped with smoked butter. Shellfish lover or not, this preparation is unique and mouth-watering-ly good.  I was stuffed by the end of the night. Could not fit another bite of anything in my stomach. But I wanted to more than anything. YUM.",7,4,3
157,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,7/26/2013,"My friend who lives nearby recommended this place. I find myself coming here more and more often for happy hours. Just the right amount of divey and pretty awesome food. They have $2.00 Genesee cream ales during happy hour, similar to a heavier PBR. Not bad, especially for 2 bucks. I tasted some of the specialty drinks, which were pretty unique and delicious. Gonna have to stick to the beers, simply for the deal, but if you want to mix it up a bit, the drinks are quality.Granted, the portions aren't that great here, and I'm not exactly sure what they're trying to do with the ""Asian"" side of the menu, but the food they do serve is very tasty. The last time my friends and I went for happy hour, we got a free lamb merguez corn dog, compliments of the chef. Delicious. A bit more texture than a regular corn dog and higher quality meat. We also got the wings which were very crispy and delicious. If you're out in the East Village with a small group of friends, definitely hit up Ducks for some cheap beer and quality food.",6,,2

Not only that but being my first time, my waiter was super attentive and thoroughly explained the menu to me which I think was great and think everyone in the service industry should do so. Ordered a few appetizers but my take away was definitely the goat's neck. I would like to say I am pretty adventurous when it comes to eating. When I dived my fork into the plate, pieces of the goat's meat were just falling off and my first bite had all the right flavors in it. Also, the dish was huge so I would recommend sharing it with someone. Menu is very different which was great, perfect for anyone who is adventurous like myself.

162,Edmund T.,"New York, NY",318,43,4,1.0,1/8/2017,"Some reviews on Yelp just can't be trusted. Ethnic food reviews by people who've never had the authentic versions before, reviews on restaurants in Brooklyn that are purely based off hype, reviews written by out of towners, and now I've realized after 13 years of living in Manhattan, reviews on places in the east village. Back when I first graduated from college with my first job that paid peanuts and everything in the city was fresh and new, the east village was kinda cool. Now that I'm past my mid thirties with a much better job and a more refined tastes, a place like Ducks Eatery is just unbelievably sub-optimal and in my opinion does not come even remotely close to 4 stars (cause 4 out of 5 stars should be pretty fucking solid).We didn't have any altercations with anyone at the restaurant and we didn't have an exceptionally bad dining experience due to some one time issue. This review is based on what I believe is their most standard service (not a friend of anyone that works here) for a first time customer. No arguments, complaints, or unpleasantries were exchanged or affecting my review. Decor/ambiance/service: 0 stars. This place needs to decide if it wants to be a restaurant or a bar and stick with it cause trying to both just means they suck as both. Upon entering the tiny restaurant, you are greeted by no one for 5 min as there is only 1 hostess, 1 bar tender, 1 waiter, and one bus boy for the whole restaurant. You will stand at the door looking like a fool for a while as you try to identify which person you should be speaking with. Clearly, the owners tried to maximize profits by adding way more tables in the restaurant than there was meant to be. Good for him; bad for us. Navigating between the tables is practically impossible and I'm only 160 lbs. anyone bigger can avoid this place because you will feel very embarrassed when trying to get to your seat/bathroom etc. The place is dimly lit for a romantic feel but it is countered by the booming 90s gangster rap (I love Wu Tang Clan when I'm listening to music but that is not my soundtrack of choice for dining out) that is blasted out of low-end speakers. Effectively, this creates a loud, drowning background music that mutes all conversations in the restaurant. By the end of the meal, my party got so tired of trying to yell over the music that we ended up just not talking until we left the restaurant and went somewhere else. In terms of service, I've already told u exactly how many people work here, the size and poor layout of the restaurant, factor in the fact that this is east village and most people here are only staff looking to make a quick buck as their so called music/acting career doesn't pay bills, you can figure out how the service was so I won't elaborate on that. Food/drinks: 0 stars. One yelp reviewer said adamantly that ""every goddamn thing on the menu is AMAZING"". I honestly think that person needs to try eating at better restaurants or just stop reviewing all together. If I picked up a piece of shit off the street and told them it was an exotic dark chocolate from Africa, said person would probably say it was AMAZING as well. We started with the pickle jar, the beef jerky, the oysters, and the beef tartar. I honestly think the only decent item the whole dinner was that damn jar of pickles. The beef jerky was tough as hell and the taste wasn't memorable; one of my guests was slightly older and could not eat this at all as eating this is something like eating flavored rubber, dry  tough and way too hard to chew/bite. The oysters were just oysters; you didn't have a choice to what kind of oysters and unless u went cheap and bought bad oysters, it's pretty hard to mess up oysters. There was nothing special about the oysters. The beef tartar, omg the beef tartar. There was potential here as the seasoning for it was pretty good but it fails epically in the meat used for the tartar. The beef is cut into slightly larger than normal cubes/chunks and is full of tendons making it very disgusting. Similar to the beef jerky it's like eating flavored rubber. Clearly the owner sprang for the cheapest cut and completely ruins any potential this dish had. For our mains we ordered the smoke dry ribs and the goat neck. Both were too fatty and greasy, tasted bland and one-dimensional, and poorly presented on a plate. We each ordered a cocktail but passed on getting a second round cause honestly, they were about the worst cocktails we've ever had. We didn't bother giving dessert a try as everything else failed. To sum it up we left this restaurant hungry and dissatisfied as we weren't really able to converse and catch up as intended. We quickly dashed to soba ya and had some really delicious food there followed by drinks at hi collar. Shoulda went with that itinerary to start with. I won't be back and god damn kill me if I ever recommend this place to someone.",5,,

Many people review the watermelon drink but I strayed and did not get that. I did taste it and it was really my thing. I prefer a little more sweetness in my drink.  I have no adversity to ginger, if you do then the Duck Buck is not for you. The bartender made my sweet by adding more of that ginger sweetness to it.The Periodista is more a straight stronger drink. For apps- Shrimp Chips...which we call ""prawn crackers"". Had this many times at my aunts home. She fries them up. I have to find out where she gets them from. Hers are more flavorful.Pig ears- This was served in lettuce wraps. I did not eat the lettuce.

I could eat it with a spoon (not sure if they have it on the normal menu.. they were out of the regular pig ear appetizer and replaced it with a cornbread with pig ears inside).

I ordered a cocktail WITHOUT the bourbon, I am very sure the waiter knew this, since he repeated the order back to me and said as much. Upon tasting the drink it contained the bourbon!!! Whilst this isn't an issue for me, I'm glad I'm not a recovering alcoholic/someone with strict religious practices where alcohol is not permitted, because if that was the case, an apology just wouldn't have cut it for me!Onwards though to the food, which like I said was amazing! Three of us went and ordered the shrimp chips, smoked duck salad and goat curry to share.The duck salad was dressed in flavors that I hadn't tasted before on a salad. Perhaps the black garlic. The berries complimented the earthy flavours of the dressing, introducing a refreshing lightness. The black rice gave the dish some bite and added a nutty grainy texture. I have been wanting to visit here for months. So I had really built the goats neck curry up. In my head this thing was going to be phenomenal. And upon tasting it? If possible, it was even more so. The meat was fall off the bone tender. It was smokey, giving it a southern feel, but then the flavors of the yellow curry come through. This flavor combination really works and wow, just wow, it's like an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. I really wanted to try the dessert but was far too full. Maybe next time :)",,1,

I passed by this place and decided to step in for a quick meal and was pleasantly surprised at how good this is. The only downfall that this place had for me was that the seating outside was not the most ideal I sat next to a pile of trash bag in the middle of the summer and whether or not I moved inside, the smell was pretty bad. The glass door was also cracked as if someone threw a rock at it. The sidewalk is also not leveled so the table and chairs are a little bit uncomfortable.

Everything was so mushy I just don't think it's worth the money. I'm by no means a cook, but I feel like I could've done a better job. All in all, the price isnt worth what we got.

Dim candle lighting for dinner surrounded with brick walls and a projector running in the back. Service: excellent, they time the food just right! Once we finished a dish, they would bring the next one over. Tip: I suggest eating family style so you can try all the great dishes.  Just for taste:1. Crispy pig ears:An absolute MUST HAVE. This appetizer has a great flavor to it. The ears were made to a perfect crisp, mixed in with the pickled cabbage, and placed on top of a lettuce for you to wrap. Be careful, the sauce is very juicy and may drip out of the lettuce, so I suggest you keep it over a plate.2. Yakamein soup:LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the brisket in this dish! they make it nice and tender and surprisingly it complements well with the soup. The broth is thick with a sweet and sour taste. The noodles were like any other ramen noodles, but it was still worth it because the broth and meat were so bomb!3. Red beans and rice:Good flavor, wasn't my favorite out of the things I tried, but still yummy and flavorful. 4. Oyster Happy hour for $1: Tasted fresh, I am glad it was happy hour when I came.

176,Joe R.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",20,6,1,4.0,1/16/2017,"I've been to Duck's a few times now so this review is long overdue. If you have never been and want a good comforting bite to eat with a friend or a date, go hear and get the Smoked Whole Goat's Neck!!  You get an actual goat's neck on a large plate, surrounded by a bed of very savory and soft white rice!  The goat's neck itself is so tender you could literally drag your fork from the top of the neck to the bottom and the meat would come right off the bone, so easily, onto the rice, and BOOM, you have yourself a forkful of savory and comforting goodness!  Soon after your first bite you'll wish you ordered one for yourself, but believe me, its enough, as the dish is made for two people.     Other good dishes I would recommend are the smoked brisket - which is so juicy and tender; North Country Rice has a lot of flavor but still subtle and tasty.  Also try the Chicken Wings and the Watermelon Gimlet for a refreshing drink!The restaurant itself is small so the seating is a bit on top of each other, but its well worth it for the Goat's neck alone!!  Dim lighting and large windows at front of the restaurant add some natural light during brunch.  The open faced brick walls add a nice touch to the place!       If you want to eat here on the weekend, I recommend you make rezees.  Duck's is a popular spot in LES.",1,1,

The inside was full so we were seated outside, not a big deal but we were seriously struggling to see what we were eating because it was so dark! BONE MARROW topped with tomato sauce ($18). It was good but I don't think it was worth the price, seeing how little of the marrow we got. And later after we finished devouring it because it was so little of a portion, we found out ours did not have oysters when the menu mentioned it. So that small plate was so not worth it. GOAT NECK with coconut rice ($34). This is the highlight of our meal. The meat was super tender with the right amount of fat/meat ratio, the rice had the right amount of seasonings and their hot pepper is really spicy, but goes so well with the meal.SERVICE was wonderful. The waiters and waitresses were all attentive and friendly.OVERALL this is just one of those restaurants I would try once and not again because it's so pricey for so little. But I do recommend the goat neck, it was pure deliciousness.",,,
178,April P.,"Manhattan, NY",333,233,309,3.0,6/2/2015,"Came here tonight for my birthday and it was sort of a hit and a miss. While I usually love cozy atmospheres, it was a bit too cozy here... To the point where I couldnt get to my seat without interrupting peoples dinners to ask them to scooch in. I ordered the duck buck drink and I absolutely loved it! All the drinks looked great and I wouldn't definitely come back to try the rest. We were starving so we ordered some shrimp chips and they were pretty good, but nothing special. I ordered the bone marrow because it seemed like something interesting and I love trying new foods. I would definitely say it's an acquired taste..... I returned it immediately blechhhh. Very rich but lacking flavor. I instead ordered the duck salad which was okay. Again it kind of lacked flavor. Couldn't even tell what the dressing was supposed to be because it was so bland. BUT! The side of collard greens was AMAZING and my boyfriend got the rice and beans which was also delicious. I found it weird that these two dishes were so flavorful while the others were so bland almost like I ordered from two different restaurants!I'm willing to try some of the other dishes over time and the staff was very friendly.",,,
179,Gina K.,"New York, NY",530,172,922,2.0,2/24/2015,"Brunch Review Only:I certainly walked in with high expectations since Duck's is so highly rated. I knew I had to order the Pumpkin Waffles ($14) with the additional Buttermilk Fried Duck (+$8). For a $22 brunch dish...blah, the disappointment. The pumpkin waffle itself is crisp when you first bite into it, but gives a slight gooey chew I love in a waffle. Definitely on the crispier, light side though, which is good considering the praline syrup and pecan butter add the heavier richness to the dish. HOWEVER. When you add in the buttermilk fried duck, the dish is NOT cohesive.The buttermilk fried duck is very peppery and has a biting salty exterior, with a moist chicken interior. Again, the duck itself was cooked well, but when paired with the sweetness of the waffle, there was nothing tying the two components of the dish together- it needed some sort of sauce to meld the flavors.In fact, I ate it separately after a while because it just wasn't working.It was a very bizarre, off-putting flavor combination. (It comes nowhere close to my all time favorite sweet potato waffle + fried chicken at B4~!!!!!) I had a bite of my roommate's Smoked Brisket Hash, and my other friend's Eggs Pontchartrain, which were both pretty exquisite. -------------I absolutely have to come back from the goat neck curry and pig ears because.. it's too enticing to not. Hopefully I will have a better experience *cross fingersUpdate is to come.",1,1,
180,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",445,352,1499,3.0,4/21/2015,"My boyfriend came in after seeing it on Diners, Drive ins & Dives. Guy raved about the Goat's Neck, so we  definitely had to try that. The Goat's Neck was delicious. The meat easily fell off the bone and the yellow curry rice was a perfect addition. It had so much flavor! Our server said we got a particularly large goat, so yay us! It was satisfying and filled us both up. However, the goat's neck is the only reason I'd come back to this place. The rest of our experience - eh. The place is pretty small, and there is not much personal space. We even had to carefully place the food on our table so that everything could fit, not that we ordered that much. We didn't even have silverware until we flagged someone down. We only ordered the deez nuts as an appetizer. Hated them. My boyfriend said they were just eh. And we like everything :( Maybe we should've gotten something else, but the server said the rest of the appetizers were boring. Didn't wanna be judged for that!",,,1

Updated review","This place is great!  the chicken wings are delish...whatever spices they put on there make a fireworks of tastiness in your mouth!  The rainbow trout was also surprisingly good.  I know, I know, it's not duck, but we had to try it.   And then what can be said about the goat's neck?  It is probably one of the best dishes in the city...the meat just falls off the bone and the taste is to die for!   The beignets took me back to cafe du monde....not as large as those but probably tastier.   and the waiter is hot;0",,,

This was my favorite meal during my last trip to New York. I know it's a bit premature to rate a restaurant I've only been to once so highly, but I loved the food and can't wait to return.",2,1,2

Smoky, lightly curried, served on coconut rice,It was really quite big and tasted really quite nice. We finished the meal with the pot de creme,Sweet salty and creamy, a choco-caramel dream.The atmosphere was dim and cozy, vaguely 'speakeasy,'Overall Ducks Eatery earns four stars, easily.",1,1,

The entire brunch was essentially burnt and tough and covered in an overwhelming spice. This is true for both my and my girlfriend's meals. I had the brisket dish (extremely fatty and tough), she had the Benedict (only the plain egg and muffin were edible). I was really in shock given the other reviews and my building anticipation. Very surprising!! And it took forever to come out, to top it off....",,,
186,Cait C.,"New York, NY",148,118,98,3.0,5/9/2015,"They are still figuring it out. This place has some good ideas and the location and outdoor seating is great. However, the food is not quite there yet.Shrimp chips: bland and given as a free starter at most places - can avoid.Pickles: okra and maybe celery root? They were sweet and tangy pickles.Trout salad: the seeds on top were a bit stale and chewy. The trout was similarly very tough. The dressing seemed like it was just mayonnaise, really needed a vinegar or something.Clams: the peppercorn and yellow corn broth was delicious but the clams were too chewy.White wine was good.Made it out for 45 a person.",,,
187,Marian Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",163,4,130,4.0,9/3/2015,"I came here not sure what to expect because I wanted to take my parents out to dinner somewhere not too dressy since my dad hates dressing up but still a unique dining experience because I was raised a foodie. I called ahead to make a reservation in an hour, but they told me to come in and wait because I called too late, so I did. I ended up waiting another hour because it was a small joint, and no one wanted to leave. When we sat down in the shaky tables outside on miss matched seats, there was no doubt there was a certain charm to the little place. The staff was very accommodating and nice, very attentive to your needs. In fact one of them took some time trying to stabilize our table which was very sweet! The menu was unique and surprisingly not at all extremely expensive as I had expected. It was mostly a drinking place so most of the food was small and shareable, but I have to say everything was worth it. We had mussels from a can with toast that just had the perfect taste. The mussels had no metallic, fishy taste at all but instead a nice mild flavor, and the texture of it on top of some crunchy toast was on point Next were the lettuce wraps with pigs ears and again the texture was fantastic. The ears were incredibly more spicy than I had expected, but with the freshness of the lettuce it just combined perfectly into my mouth. We also got some chicken wings and ribs which were amazing of course, incredibly tender and flavorful. Last minute we had some oysters and they were so fresh and lovely, I couldn't get enough. Though the waiting was unbelievable long to the point we almost went someplace else, the staff and food totally make up for it. The venue is really cute and unique, though one problem might be the fact it's so close to a tight road as most New York restaurants and one car that evening was burning up and the smoke was everywhere and the smell was horrendous, but otherwise very great venue. I recommend it for a small group of friends looking for a night out.",,,

Since it's just starting to get nicer out, we sat inside, but when we left the outside area was packed.We ordered a round of bloody mary's, which is the way to go. They were perfect--thick, the right amount of kick, and large. I had the Benton's Bacon Benedict, which was amazing. Two poached eggs on top of thick sliced bacon, and a heap of maple sweet potato home fries. You best believe I tried to finish everything on my plate, but ended up taking the home fries to go.Service was great--our waitress was friendly and checked in on us many times. It's a small place, so groups of 4 or less seemed to work best. A very cute spot for a serious meal.",,,
189,Diane Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",239,1123,116,1.0,10/23/2014,"Ugh, I hate when my experience differs so much from what everyone else.Food was 1.5 stars, service was 1 star, and ambiance was 1 star.-Goat neck was wayyyy too salty and a bit stringy. Some parts were tender though, and the rice was good.-Wings were fine, nothing out of the ordinary.-Ribs were dry and on the spicy side.-Shrimp crackers are the ones that Chinese people eat during Chinese new year. Felt like a rip off since these are so common to me. But, um, I guess they were seasoned, so maybe it was worth it?-Bone marrow was mehhh, the orange rind and ricotta threw me off and took away from the simplicity of marrow.-Duck and waffle was very sweet and the duck was mostly dry. It also comes with a green creamy sauce that is very overpowering.The waitress might have been super busy, but she could have at least been more welcoming and crack a smile here and there. I definitely did not feel like my business was appreciated. It also took forever or flagging someone down just to get more water.The restaurant itself is pretty small and the tables and chairs are very close together. Don't expect a lot of space. And it is super dark and loud. So if you don't want to see or hear who you're with, it's perfect. But if you want to carry a conversation, you will have to scream. My throat is actually a bit sore from having to talk so loudly.The worst thing was probably the bathroom. It smelled like a hamster cage. Really gross. And the bathroom wasn't even visibly dirty, just had a nasty hamster smell. At least burn a candle or something. Weird.",4,5,1
190,mish i.,"Washington, DC",15,24,0,1.0,9/20/2017,WHY?! Why does this place have 4 stars?  2 of us ate dinner this past Friday night.  We were seated outside fast enough but holy moly did the rest of the evening stink.1. All of the draft beers were tapped.  Odd. There are no more kegs in the restaurant on a Friday?  Only sub-par canned beer options.  Ended up ordering a nice wine instead.2. Only in NYC would you be allowed to serve someone a few measly sticks of jerky in a tin can and charge $$$$.  It was not good.3. Artichokes are not meant to be burnt beyond belief. Get a new line cook.  They'd already run out of other appetizers on the menu.4.There is a meat plate - its fine.  The 2 dips/ sauces on it are not good.  5. Sub-standard service.  If you're going to charge $$$ you need staff that don't keep bringing other peoples food to your table asking if this is what you ordered.  Train your staff better.  Or maybe you have such a high turnover rate you don't have the time?Such a disappointment.  We felt cheated out of our $100+ dinner and left hungry.,,,

193,Mary T.,"New York, NY",1,28,52,5.0,1/2/2017,"This is a small (cozy) place with some outdoor seating. Casual but can feel very intimate, especially with the dim lighting and close seating.Had to make reservations beforehand since I had a group of 9 and it was easy to do online. They were very accommodating despite me calling 2x to change the time and size of the party. They had put together a few tables to accommodate the group and it was perfect; any more than that would have been really tight. We did have to wait about 15min for our table to get set up but that was okay given that a few people in the party were running late.The group ordered all of ""Plates"" and a few of the ""Small Plates"".Plates:Goat neck- AMAZINGLY TENDER, the meat just falls right off the bone; I expected this to be much bonier (having had other neck dishes- good stuff) but it was very meaty, almost like a lamb shank; served with fragrant coconut rice that soaked up the mild curry sauce the meat was cooked in; the bing cherries brought some acidity to this savory dish with its slight sweetness and tartness; topped with cilantro giving it some freshness Red Beans 'n Rice- beans cooked perfectly, soft but not too starchy; flavorful on it's own but had most of this with the goat neck to provide some diversity to the meat and rice dishDuck and waffle- thumbs up for this twist on the usual chicken and waffles; the meat was tender, the batter was on thick end and could have been crispier but still good; the pate butter was umami and so good; tomato jam was sweet and very concentrated in flavor; I had this dish a while after it arrived so the waffle was cold and a bit soggy by the time I had it but the density was enough to complement the duck well, can't remember if it was flavored with herbs but that would have been cool Yakamein Soup- delicious dish hitting different tastebuds; was a vibrant contrast to all the meat and starch dishes we ordered; citrusy/tart, similar to tom yum soup but creamier (coconut milk?) and savory; noodle were al dente; brisket were tender and tasty; it was very sour which could have been brought down a notchLittle Neck Clams- amazing peppercorn broth that was great for soaking toast with St. Louis Ribs- smokey, tender, good amount of meat on the boneChicken Wings- smokey, tender, a little sweet and sourSmall Plates:-Crispy Pig Ears- can't even tell they are pig ears; cut into thin strips, fried to a crisp and seres with lettuce and pickled cabbage; really good crunch appetizer-Smoked Mussels- smokey, meaty mussel meat in chili oil; toast with smoked butter and chives that blends well with the smokiness of the mussels chili oilFood and drinks were slow to come out at first but then started coming out much more rapidly.Ducks Eatery does a great job turning otherwise unconventional dishes into highlights (goat neck, cripsy pig ears) and putting a unique spin on classics (duck n waffles, pate butter).",1,,

I don't know if they have a new chef but my dinner last night was not good. The smoked duck salad was ok, but I remember it being better the first time I had it. This time not sure what changed but it was certainly saltier than it should have been. The duck and waffle was a favorite of mine, but dude heavy on the salt. The duck was so over salted it was sickening. It tasted like someone dipped it in the ocean. The skin was good, and so was the waffle, but all I tasted was salt. What is the point of spending time cooking something if the end result is the pure taste of salt. There is nothing I hate more than a salt happy chef. Not everyone enjoys salt as much as you. To my surprise the ribs were the total opposite of being over salted, they tasted like bland boiled slabs of meat. While tender, Where was the flavor and the sauce? Saint Louis rub? What rub? We had to ask for some sauce to dip it in. Ducks I'm sorry this dinner was so bad I had to un-bookmark you.

We started with the buttermilk biscuits which were hot, flaky and fresh out of the oven, served with butter and honey. Our food came out quickly, even though our biscuits came out before our friends'. My husband and I then shared the ricotta grits which were in the difficult to achieve ""Goldilocks Zone"" (not too think, not too runny). It seemed like they were cooked overnight in heavy cream, unlike many places that use water and think that they're not committing a crime against humanity by doing so. The ricotta really amplified the flavor and texture of the grits, too. I ordered the brisket sweet potato hash. It had a little heat, but not too much, and the brisket was tender and pulled apart like it should. The fried eggs that came on top were cooked perfectly, and the sweet potatoes were nice and soft without being mushy.They open the front windows all the way on nice days and have a small patio, which is a welcome addition in NYC. Too bad the servers left so much to be desired.",4,2,3
