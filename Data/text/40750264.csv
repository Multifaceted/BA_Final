0,Sil N.,"Long Beach, CA",8,149,499,3.0,1/25/2017,Service was alright. They should work on smiling and being more polite. Buuut on the other hand their food is great. My fianc√© and I went on our last day in New York to get their chocolate chip pancakes and we ended up placing an order to go to bring back home.,,,

All I wanted was a pastry and some coffee how can u fuck that up?! The cashier told us that the mochaccino was out of season (hmm it was early march when we were there) and proceeded to give me a dish I didn't order (the same one my friend ordered which defeated the purpose since we wanted to sample one another's!)and tried to cop an attitude with me!! Bitch pease, I'd stay farrrr away from here for all except the most basic of needs!",1,1,1
