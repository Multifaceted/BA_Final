5,Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",236,84,78,1.0,2/10/2018,"I went here once before and the experience was pretty mediocre, but decided to stop in today because I was hungry and in a hurry. Spoiler alert: we ended up leaving before orderingWe were originally offered a table by the door, but we asked to sit elsewhere because it was chilly outside. So the host walked us past several open tables and almost spitefully brought us to a back room with the lights off, then turns them on to reveal an employee sleeping in a booth next to his beer. Not exactly what I had in mind for boozy brunch. Anyway, it smelled like a high school locker room so we left before ordering. Definitely don't plan on returning.",2,3,1
6,Katie L.,"New York, NY",251,233,532,3.0,1/5/2018,"One of those diner places you frequent after a night out in the city, when you can no longer distinguish good food from bad, or won't have any recollection of it the following day.They're open 24 hours, so a good spot for a visit after traipsing in Murray Hill. I came with a group of friends and sat in the back area. Clearly they get a lot of late-night business, as we were just one of many large groups chowing down.Gemini serves basic diner foods, including my cheeseburger deluxe with all the fixings and large cut fries. It was a run of the mill burger, but tasted great then and there. Thank you liquor. The front dining area also has a large desserts case. Why I didn't get a slice of pie I don't remember, but maybe on the next post-midnight run.",2,3,

This was the only place that was close by that seemed decent so we walked in and I'm glad we did. The service was very good and the prices were decent. We ordered the healthy smoothies to cool down. We had the Hawaiian vacation flavor which was so good! We also ordered the mozzarella sticks which were very tasty. I would recommend to a bite to eat with friends and family in the area.,,,1

We could not find anything open and while we headed toward another place that was closing, they recommended we come to this diner. And my goodness, we're so glad we came here! The server was awesome! Our food was great too! We had the Matzo soup, a salad and a sandwich. I normally would not eat at a place that has 3 stars on yelp but i was really hungry!

On many occasions, we've received our food in less than 20 minutes. The most we've ever waited is about 40 minutes, and that's rare. All of the food arrives hot and fresh, and they have a great menu. Italian, Greek, American, etc. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it's always a solid choice! Even the delivery men are nice. If we order breakfast, they hand me our newspaper as well as our food.

The chicken and rice had no flavoring at all and no sauce was included. They could have at least drizzled lemon on the rice and chicken. It was the most bland chicken and rice dish I have ever tasted. The chicken was hard to bite through and tasted burnt on some spots. I was disappointed because it was a large portion size and I hate food going to waste.On a positive note, I loved their fruit smoothie; it was fresh and flavorful. The food only took around 15 minutes to be prepared. The packaging was thoughtful and included lots of utensil packs. Overall, their portion sizes are pretty big and their menu is extensive. I would recommend ordering any pasta and smoothie.",4,1,1

I then had to call delivery.com and they explained that if I wanted a new order I would have to pay.

21,Kelsey O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/1/2018,"This is the worst dining experience I've ever had. We were 4 people ordering late night food. Our waiter came over and was taking down our order, when I went to order an egg wrap and he walked away. Didn't come back to our table again. We had to ask the manager and other waiters if he was still around. When we finally located him, he told us he was no longer taking our order. He then PROCEEDED to take everyone else's order in our section and kept ignoring us.MANAGER did nothing and refused to help.FINALLY a second waiter comes up to our table after 15 minute and was super rude to us. He kept interrupting us as we were placing our order to say ""hurry up."" We couldn't believe it! Then he left - we thought just maybe this time we had finally ordered. Only for him to come back 10 minutes later asking what did we order again. Then threw his pad on the table and told us to write it down. We were SHOCKED. I've never in my life been spoken to that way at a dining establishment in NYC. I'm in the customer service industry and we just couldn't believe it. Not to mention, that the manager just kept telling us he couldn't do anything and that they were very busy. We finally had to call it quits and simply get up and leave. AFTER 40 MIN of being discriminated against , I would NEVER give them business. Disclosure: as we were walking out, another group from the back of the restaurant did the same thing. They had been waiting for 30 minutes to order, and the server said the diner ran out of food. #UNBELIEVABLE",,,
22,Nora F.,"Sunnyside, NY",80,625,4622,4.0,9/14/2016,"I came here with my good friend and her lovely mom who I call ""mom too. Her mom wanted to take us to a nice and beautiful fancy place but I said don't worry much as long as we can relax and the food is reasonably good, I'm fine. So my friend suggested this diner. Surprisingly this diner makes a pretty good omelette! Mom and I had cheese omelettes. I liked! My friend had a nice vegetable omelette. Looked delicious too. The diner is quiet and quite relaxing. It has a beautiful Spanish-Mediterranean style paint. Good service. We had a great late lunch. Worth a try. Sometimes we think we can't get good stuff at diners but these days even diners are trying to compete. There's some diners that still maintain the classic style breakfast and serve good coffee. Explore before diners decide to go away.",,,
23,Elisha N.,"New York, NY",11,9,10,1.0,5/1/2016,"No stars for them but have to give them one to post. For the second time I placed an order on Seamless and an hour and a half later it still didn't show. Had to walk over in the rain to find out what was going on and saw my order was on the Seamless list as pending after I received a message that it was on the way and was told by the manager that they were busy. Of course I canceled the order and received a 15 minutes later saying they canceled it because they were too busy. So.. If I didn't go in, I would have waited an hour and 40 minutes after I ordered to hear from them (pic attached).Here's a tip. If you're going to be on Seamless, make sure you can handle the volume and don't lie on your listing about your delivery time. ""We're too busy"" isn't an acceptable excuse to leave people waiting.",2,1,1

I like the tuna sandwich and I like the burger and fries.  We tried the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  Basically, the chicken was inedible, dried out and like rubber.  The salad itself was barely passable too little feta, and poor salad items.  The pita I paid for ($4 for three pitas) was like cardboard. Neither of us could watch it.",1,,

My friends and I have made a habit of waking ourselves up on sleepy weekend mornings with a Gemini meal and have never been let down. Good stuff to get: the pizza bagel (mounds of cheese and sauce on a decently sized bagel), the silver dollar pancakes (around 7 dollars and you get a huge portion), or any of the burgers. what sets this place apart for me, though, is the atmosphere. the space is large, and the staff is super warm, so its a good spot to grab diner eats without having to feel like youre being rushed out. what im saying is im guilty of spending many post meal hours lounging here just drinking coffee. all in all: a well run, homey place.",,,

If only I had better recall of reviews from 13 months ago.My entree may have been to simple to gauge Gemini's virtuosity, but I will say the bacon was delightfully crisp. The service was spectacular. In a perfect world, the toast would have been pre-buttered but this may well be a nod to cultural trends in consumption of high-calorie bread toppings.",1,1,1

The only complaint from our table of 5 is that the home fries were bland. I had the turkey BLT wrap and it was really good! The service, however, kinda sucked. I think they're super overstaffed - we saw at least 3 people standing and texting during our entire visit. Our waiter answered every question with an ""uh huh"" and came off obnoxious. The bus boy was terrible - he had a pissed off look the whole time. I wonder what him and his girlfriend fought about. The diner itself is big and has lots of seating. Our group fit comfortably at a table. It's also close to the hospitals so you can get a quick bite to eat here.",1,2,2

The host at the door began to prepare the tea as the people who worked in the kitchen were busy cleaning/prepping for the next day. Mind you it was about 10:40 on a weeknight  so it wasn't super busy. Only problem is the host has the mostest, a nasty cough that didn't stop while he coughed all over my cup, not to mention the fact he didn't  wash his hands at all. I had to stop him and tell him I didn't  want the tea. I then told him why.  He seemed astonished that I  didn't want my tea with a side of cough.

Odd combo but the tummy wants what it wants. My expectations were low & I was really surprised by the food & service. My order was delivered very quickly, the delivery guy was pleasant, beautiful transaction.I busted this bag open at my desk & started with the bagel. The pizza bagel was open faced & almost looked like lasagna they way it was topped with cheese in a pool of red sauce. It was delicious, would totally order again.The mozz sticks...you can't really mess this up but these were breaded very lightly which was great. Very yummy. Their red sauce is good too so, perfect combo. Would totally order these again too. Thanks Gemini Diner you saved the day!",3,1,3

37,Jay M.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",123,691,1384,3.0,7/10/2015,"Decent diner. It's on the corner of 2nd and 35th, so it was a few yards from where I needed to be earlier. The diner itself is nice. It reminds me of the Mark Twain Diner but not as spacious. The service was fine. The guy who took my order initially forgot my toast, but he brought it out after 15 minutes or so.Breakfast Wrap (scrambled egg, bacon, cheese, scallions) ($7.20): For $7.20, this was really small. Think of a small flour tortilla--the Mission brand--then filled with the toppings I listed and rolled. Aside from it being an undersized wrap, it didn't come with much, either--two slivers of pickle and a spoonful of cole slaw. Taste wise, the wrap was alright. The bits of bacon were pretty salty, but came in thick chunks. The sliced scallions were fresh; crispy and strong in flavor. I didn't bother with the cole slaw or pickles.One thing I don't understand is the menu itself. This is the first diner that I've been to that only gives you a breakfast menu even though it was near lunch time. Every diner I've been to allows you to order a burger, steak, or whatever else is being offered at anytime. However, the menu I was give only had breakfast items and drinks, nothing else. Perhaps it was missing a few pages. Overall, this is a solid dining option in the area; it's open 24/7.",,,

I was staying nearby at the Affinia Dumont on 34th Street and had an hour before I had to get into the office. I wasn't in the mood for a hotel-type buffet after a weekend of culinary debauchery, but a modest omelette would suit me just fine. This corner diner feels like it has Greek origins since they feature several Mediterranean specials, but there's also quite a few seafood, Mexican and Creole specials not to mention burgers, pasta and ""diet delights"". So what do I know?I was happy to see a full page of breakfast specials including my perennial favorites liked corned beef hash & eggs and French toast, I decided to be relatively good and order the $9.55 Egg White Vegetarian Omelette, which came with toast and a whole lotta home fries that were a tad on the greasy side (see photo). Overall it was pretty decent but nothing that excited me much. There were plenty of chopped vegetables inside, but there was a flatness to the flavor of the eggs that did make me wonder how fresh they were or if they came from a packaged mix. Still, I have to admit they hit the spot when I wanted something on the lighter side.FOOD - 3 stars...diner fare that met my expectations and nothing moreAMBIANCE - 3 stars...basically the same diner you saw on ""Seinfeld"" or in ""Frankie & Johnny""SERVICE - 2.5 stars...not too friendly but certainly fast enoughTOTAL - 3 stars...if you want the standard NYC diner experience, you could do worse",7,5,6

In addition, the delivery was fast. I would so order from here again. I love a place that can make good eggs and bacon.",,,
41,Maria D.,"Newburgh, NY",192,17,11,1.0,9/13/2016,"Honestly, I am so disappointed with this place... My friends and I went to this diner after we attended the festival over Labor Day weekend. To start it was beyond packed, so I understood why the service was slow. But we waited over 10 minutes to get water! We even got up and got the menus ourselves. Our waiter was just very inattentive and he had a very bad attitude. I get it's late but don't take it out on me, you'd be there whether I came in or not. After we finished our meal it was another 20 minutes just to get the check, which again I had to physically get up to pay because the waiter was just walking around not even asking anyone how they were doing or if they needed anything. While waiting for our other group of friends to finish I ordered a wine, and my friend ordered a mojito. For any of you that don't know mojitos are made with rum, lime juice, club soda with a dash of sugar(simple syrup) and mint leaves as garnish with a lime on the rim. Now my friend wasn't expecting a fancy drink but it was awful. It tasted like artificial lime juice with rum. As for my drink, the wine glass was broken I didn't even take a sip because if it broke in my mouth I'd be very upset. When I brought this to the attention of the manager on duty or the owner, I'm not sure who he was, he got very loud and said "" Not to worry we'll take care of it"" all while ripping up the check and causing a scene. I had the respect to go up to him while he was alone in order to avoid a scene but it happened anyways.It also doesn't make it better that my friends waited almost an hour to be served, didn't enjoy the food and told the guy and was berated. All were willing to pay but honestly they shouldn't have. And while they were all arguing some random guy walks out the back exit and this ensues more chaos. I can't say I'll ever want to go here again because I'd love to give the benefit of the doubt, but after that whole ordeal with whoever was there I'll pass. I do believe sometimes customers are too entitled and I don't like being one of them, but I refuse to bring my business, especially as a former waitress to a place that treats customers like garbage.",2,,

Luckily, there are many options to find healthier eats if you take the time to explore a bit. It's almost like spelunking, as you never know what you might find in the most obscure of places.As I was walking around the neighborhood I work in looking for a decent spot for lunch I came across Gemini Diner's menu in their window and saw some terrific lunch choices so I went on in. The diner itself is that classic no-frills NYC diner. Not trying to be all trendy or modern gourmet. It's like you are sitting in snapshot of a 1970's diner, a little aged, but very clean. In fact, as I was enjoying lunch here the staff was constantly cleaning and wiping up the place. Enjoyed lunch I did! Gemini offers up a nice selection of lunch specials in the $7.95 range that includes a soup or salad to go along with an entree choice. For this meal I had a bowl of lentil soup and an egg white vegetarian wrap. I was offered the option of getting french fries or fruit, so I went with a nice sized bowl of fruit they give you here. The lentil soup was thick and full of lentils - nice protein option. The egg white wrap was full of vegetables and tasty. The fruit was actually quite fresh too. More than enough food here as the portions filled me up just right for lunch without feeling weighed down. Healthy eats at a reasonable price point.Service was fast and friendly. Lots of seating in a clean environment. Food tasted good. Great prices for lunch specials. Can't ask for much more than that. Just a solid old school diner here in NYC.",14,4,9

The service was poor, the waiter was like hard of hearing. Literally I had to move a bit and make direct eye contact to get his attention. I ordered the salmon Caesar  salad with dressing on the side. The grilled  salmon was excellent but the salad not. When it came the dressing was on the side, the salmon hot and delicious but the lettuce? It was watery and cold! I ate what I could and ignored the rest. My mother ordered a mushroom omelet with mozzarella cheese, literally all was there was a omelette, nothing special. Her friend a whole wheat waffle with fresh fruit again nothing special!  As an appetizer we had cheese fries! Um so listen, don't order! Not the best! The fries were good (average) store bought baked fries with extra salt, a bit too salty. The cheese?! Yuck! The cheese it was mozzarella and tasted too gummy, maybe it was that pollo string cheese melted? I didn't like it and made the fries too salty, my mother wolfed them down with a chase of Aqua. She was starving by lunch time so it didn't stop her from devouring them. Overall come back just maybe for brunch or breakfast instead ?",1,,

That is just not courteous and it's bad business to treat a customer with disrespect as if I asked for the entire order to be replaced, which I would not do, if it came to that point I'd just simply leave the establishment.  With that said, I feel restaurants/eateries should train wait staff to be courteous and not take things personal when it should always be kept professional and ensure you cater to the needs of a paying customer!",2,2,2

Finally, he answered. When ordering our coffees, I asked for brown sugar. They, like many diners in NYC, ""didn't have any"".  Most New Yorkers know this line is a lie.  We shouldn't take them for their word because if I had ordered oatmeal, it would have undoubtedly been served with some. The food was good, which is why I will give the restaurant two stars.  After delivery of the food, the waiter never checked on us and when we wanted the check, he was nowhere to be found for a bit.  We ended up standing up to leave and I asked the manager for the check.

Our waiter forgot our waters and didn't offer to refill the drinks. Because the wait was so long a lot of patrons left before their food came out so the waiter gave us free cheese fries, another table got some sliders, and etc. I got the Gemini sampler. It looked delicious and it was hot on the outside. The buffalo chicken was hot on the outside and freezing cold on the inside. When we told the waiter just for the health and safety for future customers, he said the chicken is precooked so it wouldn't get us sick. Sick or not, I don't pay to eat cold chicken. We told the manager and luckily he was able to take it off our tab. The nachos we ordered were also burnt.

It is a little more expensive than your average diner, but then again, consider what ""average diner"" means in Manhattan, and consider Gemini's portions.  Was it the best diner experience I've ever had? No, but this place is pretty no-frills. Combined with good food in big portions, how much closer to perfect diner-ness can you get?

Once it arrived, it was enough to feed 3 people. The sausage is one of those actual large encased type...i personally really liked it. Bacon was made well, the croissant sandwich was delicious.

The eggs were cooked alright but the cheese was definitely tragic. The omelet just had veggies stuck in and 2 slices of kraft cheese. It probably wasn't even kraft because it tasted even more fake. There was an overload of fake cheese and not enough egg or veggies to balance it out.,,1,

I have the feeling the menu hasn't changed in decades and that's a good thing. I'm sure it was good then, and it's certainly good now.Gemini reminds me of one of those diners you may have gone to as a kid, and when you went back as an adult it was exactly the same; grizzled chef churning out burger platters and omelettes, old timey Greek cashier, and bustling wait staff refilling your coffee and water. I find that most diners in Manhattan are very mediocre and overpriced. Not so with Gemini. The food is always good and fresh, the menu is extensive and the prices are pretty fair. Plus, it's open 24 hrs a day, always good to know! The service is great here (even when they're busy), and the food is usually out toot sweet.

Or breakfast in the evening, or a tuna melt. But I hate sub par diner food. We went to Gemini for brunch. It wasn't terrible, it wasn't great. I got eggs florentine with home fries, which I ordered off the brunch menu. Plus side: I also got a mimosa with brunch. It was good. The eggs were fine too. Minus side: the home fries. I love home fries when they are crispy and golden, burnt on the edges, crunchy sauteed onions...I could just eat a plate of good home fries and be one happy little camper. But these were plain. They were mushy. No golden crust, nothing like the potatoes I know and love. Heartbreaking, no, disappointing, yes. If you're like me and brunch isn't complete without a nice side of potatoes you might want to look elsewhere. The service was good, the atmosphere was generic diner. We did get a lot of food and the price was reasonable, but what's the point in quantity if the quality is lacking? Overall, I'd say this is good for a quick meal any time of day (open 24 hours), and the food is decent but not exceptional.I won't discourage you too much from going there (hey, maybe you're not going there for the home fries), but I won't be making a trip back there anytime soon.",1,1,

When I called to ask for something else to be delivered I explained that I had ordered for many yeas, the manager argued for a long time saying, ""No one else complains, we sell a lot of them."" This is the typical response from cheap managers who rip off delivery people because they have already paid for their meal before they see it, unlike at the restaurant where you can send it back if it is bad or not cooked right or not as described. The problem is that more people don't complain so they get away with serving frozen fried chicken or fish when it is just so much better to make it fresh. They are mediocre at best and the cooks are clueless. This is one of the worst diners in the city and the worst in Murray Hill and they need a manager who knows something about food and a short order cook who has some clue.

And their bathroom's at the basement; the men's bathroom liquid handsoap needed to be replaced.. service was OK; i noticed a number of regular customers who showed up, were already around when we came and who seemed to linger longer than new customers like us.",,,

We read the reviews and decided on Gemini. What a find! I ordered the bowl of chilli and a side of sauteed brocolli - I was delighted that they did not serve the chilli with rice. Always too filling on rice and I would rather have just the chilli. The portion size was good and very filling. I ordered their smoothie for dessert which was filling and only managed to drink 1/8th of the cup. I brought the rest home. I ordered for delivery through Seamless web today and received my order within 20 min. I ordered a BLT on wheat, no mayo. The sandwich was fresh, bread was toasted and very delicious.

When I say refuge I mean that it's a cozy atmosphere (it's a diner!) and I can sit here with a book for hours and no one is hustling me out the door. The wait staff is very attentive and they come around consistently to check up on your meal or to ask if you would like another beer (yes, please). The portions are massive and I treat myself to something new every time I come to Gemini Diner. There was this one evening last week when I had a ""memorable"" day at work, and I wanted to drown myself in comfort food all night, which is exactly what you can do at Gemini Diner and you will certainly get your money's worth. A plate of penne a la vodka sauce is enough for two people(or three) and their brownie sundae's are portioned for four people, and yes I devoured all of them.  To protect my weak sensibilities and to avoid further ridicule i will leave it at that.

Similar?  No.  I scanned the menu and saw several other chicken entrees.  Now I had to deal with a long delay to place the new order.  When he  returned and took my new order he  told me this chicken dish would take 45 minutes.  So I picked another chicken offering.  This came out as dry and tasteless as you can imagine.  It was bad.  I wanted to just leave but had another long wait before the waiter returned to check on me.  The place was empty at 6:45 and I could hear him talking off in the distance.  During that wait I could hear a phone call where the owner(?) was explaining to a person who placed an online order that the item they picked out was also unavailable.  I had planned to talk about my unhappiness when asked if everything was OK but nobody asked.",,1,

I have tried more times than I would like to admit to make this restaurant work for me as it is so close to me. Consistently, the service is horrific. We have literally begged. Please, a knife, a refill, a clean fork, not what I ordered, mayo, mustard, not the way I ordered, extra charges for everything, no substitutes.     Anybody there? Anywhere? Anybody? Can I serve myself? Please just let me serve myself.    The menu selection is huge. What happens when your menu is that large? Nothing tastes good. In fact nothing tastes is a better description!     The desserts always look good. But by that time I am literally begging someone for my check.
