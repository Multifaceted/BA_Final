0,Stacy C.,"Corktown, Hamilton, Canada",0,1,0.0,5.0,7/11/2018,"Found this gem on the first night of a 4 night trip to Manhattan. We returned every day since. Our barman, Shane, was  such a pleasure to chat with. So friendly and hospitable!!! We felt so welcomed and comfortable. If we lived in the east village this would be our local, for sure. The pub is clean and just modern enough, but with some traditional charm. Fish tacos are awesome!!! Although this was the only food we had, we saw other patrons' plates and everything looks amazing and the plating is very cool. Thanks so much to Shane for the laughs and hospitality. You made our vacay even more memorable!!! Stacy and Jay from Hamilton, Ontario",,,
1,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3176,11053,3.0,11/9/2018,"Man, the table czar at this place needs to chill the F out.Grabbed a table while my friends were waiting at the bar, and this lady comes over and says I can't sit there because it's meant for 6 people (it wasn't). I tell her we're 3, and then she says fine. Then she goes up to a couple sitting at a 4-top, and she moves them to the back. Someone else comes in and grabs that table. Then she comes back and yells at us for ordering at the bar since there's table service.I guess she's just trying to earn her wages.Anyway, good whiskey selection. Buffalo wings and nachos are both solid. Lots of TVs to watch the ol' sporting games.",1,,

My friend asked the waitress for recommendations for food, the waitress said ""Be ready with your order when I come back"", and left! Just left the table! When the TVs were stuck in the middle of the game (literally) and the guys next to us asked what's going on and she waved them off and said it's being handled. Again, said it and left.Now, I know the place is packed but there is absolutely no reason to be rude AF. Never coming back here again.",4,4,4
3,Dia Q.,"New York, NY",123,99,201,4.0,8/30/2018,"Recommended. I came here for the Nixon Cuomo debate and it was a fun atmosphere. It's a typical Irish bar but new. I like the more subtle color palate and the hardwood furniture. I LOVED that under the bar, they not only have hooks but they have power outlets, amazing! You never have to stress about staying connected. The bartender was really nice and filled my water glass when needed. They have a room you can reserve semi private events that's nice and has a couple of tvs. I had the fish and chips and it was pretty delicious! The fries were tasty, though a little cold and soggy. I still ate them because they're gooey in the middle. The fried fish was piping hot; a stark contrast from the fries. Nice and crispy. If I had to be nit picky, I think there was a little too much baking soda as it had a slight, just slight starchy metallic aftertaste. They have brunch at which you can get a free drink with your entree. Come here!",1,1,1

The bathrooms were super clean which I find comforting, because if a bathroom is dirty, God knows what the kitchen looks like.A group of guys were at the bar and they looked like they were having the time of their lives! Their positive energy kind of set the fun, upbeat tone for the afternoon.Burgers and fries were good, as was the beer. I'm not coming here on a diet. I believe they have outdoor space but it was too cold when we were here for al fresco. I would DEFINITELY return here and eat outside. Prices are commensurate for the locale and product.",1,,

7,Donnell S.,"New York, NY",361,18,26,4.0,2/26/2018,"Note: The ONLY reason I gave this place 4 stars (instead of 5) is because I missed the kitchen by 3 minutes, to put in another order of fish tacos. Yea...they're that good.Let's get right to it, yea? My current nighttime co-workers and I came in here after our bid, for a quick drink and snack... I'm still here (at the time of typing this message). What did I order, you ask? Ohhhhh the house Merlot, which was on Happy Hour for an enthusiastic $5 *smiles*. It made the start of my night.I proceeded to order the FISH TACOS and FRIES, while contemplating if I should tack on the guac & chips or the Arnie's nachos, which also looked quite delectable, by description. After deep consideration, I figured I'd wait until I finished the tacos before I order anymore. Well...I should have made two orders of said fish tacos. They. We're. AMAZING! Anyone who has read recent reviews of mine know that I love bursting, yet balanced, flavor. This had it. I devoured the two tacos, finished my wine and headed to the bar to order more...at 11:03pm. Just missed it; hence, the 4 stars. It's nothing personal. I just personally wanted more fish tacos. I'll live. But you should stop by and give them a try.",,,

Great drinks. I had a gentleman jack on the rocks and it was real good but why do you need to charge for ""on the rocks""! It is just ice (frozen water dammit!). My son had an old-fashioned.

12,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,3.0,6/13/2017,"Friday night, looking for a bar to watch the NBA Finals. Unlike some other spots in the area, this place still had seating and plenty of TVs playing the game.Got a small table towards the back since there was a strong crowd near the bar. Waitress came by surprisingly often considering the amount of people, and was honest in saying the food will take a while to come out. Settled on sharing the Arnie's Nachos ($10) and Chicken Wings ($9). Value-wise, this place is spot on - both are quality sized dishes. Nachos are warm, and layered with guacamole, sour cream, salsa and chili. Wings are large with a bit of a tang, though extremely salty (better dunked into the ranch sauce). Beers are your normal selection; got a few Bronx Pale Ales ($7) while watching the game.For your basic pub that isn't too crowded, a solid establishment to watch sports.",2,,

To my surprise, it was about 5pm, a decent crowd on a Monday, one bartender and she held it down(meaning she carried the weight of the crowd). Happy hour! I get so excited when I can partake in HH festivities. $5 dollars beers/wine/ well drinks and $2 off appetizers. My cousin and I pigged on on our pub date. We ordered 2 blue moons, wings, fries and fish tacos. Grabbed our drinks from the bar and headed out to the small beer garden. There was not a soul outside, but my cousin and I felt we needed to soak in as much vitamin D as we could on this day. While catching up we took photos and enjoyed our drinks until the food arrived and then, silence happened. The bartender checked on us even though we were the only ones outside and the food was good. Happy girls during happy hours! Thanks",3,1,

16,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,3.0,1/25/2017,"Came in to watch the Steelers get their butts handed to them in the playoffs. From the outside you wouldn't know this was a sports bar, it's easy to pass by and not notice it at all. It's painted white, with big windows, and almost looks like a cozy, farm to table joint. The type of place that sells local jams and lets you know the name of the cow you're eating.Inside it's a standard sports bar with sports bar food. Plenty of TV's to see the game wherever you're sitting. The bus boys can be somewhat aggressive when bringing your food out, I don't care how busy you are, a plate of food never has to be passed over my head in order to be placed in front of me. Unless you feel like footing the bill for the cleaners should you spill it all over me, but either way it's not something you should do. The food itself is standard bar fare. I'm not a fan of Buffalo sauce but their wings were nice and tender. Burger with caramelized onions, bacon, and swiss was fine. Not the most exciting beef but you won't leave hungry.They have a garden in the back with more seating but no TV's. Every door in the place requires a hefty push or pull that makes you feel like you're going to tear the building down by its foundations.",4,,

The bouncer decides to move in from outdoors but keeps the door open. After about an hour I ask, does the door have to be open? He says yes, because body heat (though the bar isn't really all that crowded). I say, ""but it's cold where I'm sitting literally next to the door"" (I'm wearing my heavy winter jacket inside at this point). He says, ""it's not that cold"".

24,Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3920,6727,28891,5.0,7/6/2015,"I have a removable skin graft. It's pretty awesome. I'm OK looking without it, but you would not want to see me with my Graft-on. Total. Freaking. Nightmare. People.This place used to be called Lunasa, so let's do some Lunasa jokes.If you are on a space shuttle and need the toilet, then you probably should use the ""Loo NASA."" Whereas at this bakery, you should take your Key Lime Pie to the toilet with you. It really is that good. In fact, it's one of the best Key Lime Pies I've ever eaten in my life.My experience of this place has been pretty good each time I've been to watch soccer here. Food was okay. Average. 3 or 4 stars at most. But the service was always good, the drinks aren't too overpriced, and the football is phenomenal. I love the crowds and all the people from around the world and how intense the atmosphere gets. So for this reason, I have to give it a 5.My best experience here was for Liverpool v Manchester City with a girl I adore (but sadly she is married to my brother, grr), plus my brother, plus another girl I adore. It was a really great time. It was the first time I ever met my brother's wife actually, although they weren't married at the time. Needless to say we had an amazing time. Coutinho's late strike won it for Liverpool and it was one of the best memories I have of watching football, ever. We really thought we were going to win the league.We did not.But it's not the fault of this place. 5 stars.My first review in awhile. Only a few days but it seems like forever.And if I seem particularly happy today it's because I was just with a girl and I'm basking in the warmth of the Graft-erglow.",18,23,20
25,Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",97,1542,40,3.0,8/28/2016,"I liked the bar's beer garden in the back. There were several long tables, so they could certainly fit at least thirty people back there.

26,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,5/6/2016,"I'll be honest--I like the Grafton. I 4.25 stars like Grafton, maybe even 4.5. But I'm giving it a 5 for one simple reason--well, maybe 6 or 7 reasons--the group of Tottenham Hotspur fans in the back of the bar, comporting themselves with the utmost class and dignity. That's right, unlike its sister bar in Chelsea, Smithfield (a dear, dear bar for futbol fans), Grafton is smaller but attracts a disproportionate number of Spurs fans. Even during games against POOL, mind you, and this at a Liverpool FC BAR!Apart from that, everything about Grafton recommends itself. A nice balance of regular beers and rotational pours/bottles from the likes of Ommegang and Rogue. Lovely pub fare punctuated at brunch-time by the deliciously decadent breakfast burger (topped withapplewood-smoked bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg over easy on a toasted brioche with fries & trimmings). Friendly bartenders and wait staff who are game and generous even with hard-drinking non-regulars (we got a comp round of the goof stuff).Use but don't abuse the Grafton folks. It's so accessible right now. Let's patronize but keep it that way.",3,2,2
27,Jessica P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,69,147,4.0,9/11/2016,Good spot. Good wings. Friendly staff. They also have Bavarian pretzels which are pretty great. They come with spicy mustard to dip. Perfect with your favorite beer!!,,,
28,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1213,6241,4.0,12/16/2015,"Heading to an Irish pub on football Sunday is always questionable. Do they have enough TV's? Will they play out of town games? Comfortable seating? Should we drink whisky for breakfast? Luckily, the Grafton turned out to be the perfect spot this past Sunday (to answer those first Q's, yes, yes, yes, and... well, yes). First off, it's a few notches nicer than your average public house. Being that it's new, the place is clean and doesn't smell like years of beer spills and shame. The menu is also perfect for brunch; burgers, eggs, salads, apps. Nothing too crazy, but all done well. My order of BBQ wings (super sweet, in a good way) and the veggie full Irish (two eggs, baked beans, mushrooms, grilled tomato with home fries) were the perfect accompaniment to a well poured Guinness. On football Sunday, select beers, mimosas, bloody's are $5 and you get one free with the order of a burger or eggs. Perfect. Overall, the service and vibe was great (including the manager who put on an out of town game for us) and I wouldn't hesitate to watch some football (american or rest of the world) here in the future. Bonus: pretty cool patio area out back, though our football addiction kept us insideNote: For you premier league fans, it's a Liverpool bar",16,12,16
29,Cheyenne B.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,71,11,4.0,1/30/2017,"Definitely liked the vibe of the place! Came here for the football game a couple of weekends ago. It wasn't too crowded, be it wasn't rowdy or frat-like. Plenty of space but had people to contribute to the fun. Me and my friends split some pretty good nachos and fries, and the drink were fairly priced. Overall, I'd come here again for a couple drinks before going out downtown.",1,,
30,Aine L.,"Queens, New York, NY",89,7,0,5.0,8/27/2017,"Was in the grafton not long back with a few of my friends. We sat at the bar and to our delight had an Irish lad serving us, from what I remember his name was Shane from the west of Ireland like myself. We were all starving and couldn't decide what to eat. Shane suggested the turkey burger and fries and to add bacon and all 3 cheeses, cheddar, American and Swiss. It was heavenly. They also have a garlic dip that isn't quite like the garlic dip back home in Ireland but it was pretty damn good! It's a pretty cool bar that would be nice for a few drinks too.",,1,
31,Nicole R.,"Union City, NJ",220,140,357,3.0,4/10/2016,"Stopped into this place while trying to kill some time before catching a show nearby.  It's located right on 1st Ave in an area where they have other bars and restaurants.  We sat ourselves on the opposite side of the bar where they have a line of stool style seating.  They have tables in the front and back areas for groups and reservations which were all occupied.  The cocktail waitress walked past us at least 3 or 4 times without greeting us and offering any type of assistance.  I ended up going to the bar on my own and placing an order for drinks and food with the bartender and told him where we would be sitting.The bartender was super friendly and the drinks we ordered were good.  The food came out about 15 minutes later and this is the sad part of my review I'm afraid.  My burger which I ordered Medium came back extremely Well-Done.  The cheese did not look appetizing and the toppings (onions, lettuce, tomato) were nothing special as add ons.  No amount of ketchup or additional sauces could have helped this burger.  It tasted like a burnt patty straight off of a grill when you're at a BBQ.  The meat they use is from Pat LaFreida so this was disappointing that they 1. overcooked it and 2. added no seasoning whatsoever.  The burger came with a side of fries which were pretty good but kind of cold upon arrival.This is a small pub with a fair share of TVs.  I would recommend it if you're looking for a place with one other person to have a beer and watch a game but not for the burgers.",1,,
32,Alessandro C.,"New York, NY",356,41,2,4.0,11/14/2016,"Honestly, went in thinking this would be another East Village bar taken over by the frat boy epidemic but was happy to find out I was wrong. It turns out that it was just a good old regular chill bar with all kinds of people. Don't get me wrong there were some bros, but also a heathy amount of artsy types too.The interior has a nice rustic trendy industrial feel and soft lighting. There were TVs playing ""the game"" on so if you like sports but aren't too excited about sports bars this is your spot. It was a pretty big space. Never felt like I was going to bump into strangers.The staff was pretty great and friendly too. Always making sure we wanted another round of drinks at just the right time. They must only employ psychics because she always knew. My only concern about The Grafton was that they stopped serving food at like 11:00PM so I wasn't able to try the food. I believe in keeping the kitchen open till 12AM. Drinks were moderately priced and they had a pretty good slection of wines. This is the place you want to be on a chill weeknight with some friends.",2,1,

Updated review","I went for dinner and drinks the other night and we had a nice time - I wouldn't recommend it as a dinner place - but it's good bar food. They have burgers and appetizers (wish they had a veggie burger!) but, I did think it was a little overpriced. Drinks were well priced for the area. I had a glass of red wine for $9 my boyfriend had the beer and shot ""rich man"" deal for $12. We shared the chili and it was filling and a big portion for $9 and fish and chips $15 - the fish was fried in a good, light batter and you're given 3 pieces. We had a super nice waitress... There's a little back space that you can rent with more seating and there were liquid stains all over the walls and it's just the worst thing to sit next to when you're eating or drinking, but it can get crazy in the area! Grab the beer and shot deal when you go!",,,

41,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,10/19/2015,"The name of this place is just asking for it. But there's literally no subtle way to weave in the word ""graft"" here (I've spent an embarrassing amount of time thinking about it) so I'm just putting it out there really blatantly. Now that I've gotten that over with...I had a two-star experience here but it had nothing to do with the Grafton. It had to do with the delusional clientele here rooting for the WRONG TEAM. So despite having my night ruined by fans of this certain team - the team I hate most in all of professional sports - I can recognize that the Grafton is actually an awesome spot to watch a game. Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30 to get a couple of drinks and watch one of the two Championship Series (I'm trying to keep this as vague as possible - not trying to make enemies on here). The place was pretty packed, but we managed to come right as another party was leaving so we lucked out there. I'm a big fan of the layout of this place. Its sheer size is reason enough to try it out for a big game. Most of the sports bars I've been to in the city are significantly smaller than the Grafton, which can make for a pretty uncomfortable game-watching experience. If I'm going to a bar specifically to watch a game, seeing the TV is kind of really important. This can actually be a lot to ask for in some spaces. My friend and I were sitting across from each other at a table, and we were both able to watch this particular game on two separate TVs. Easy (as it should be). So you've got tables of various sizes, TVs aplenty, a pretty normal amount of bar seating and some standing room. No comment on the food here (looked like your usual pub fare to me), but I was pleasantly surprised with the cocktail options here. I never expect much in the cocktail arena (pun semi-intended) when I go to a sports bar, but they offer a number of interesting - dare I say....creative?? - drinks. In actuality they're nothing special, but A++ for effort here. The menu on their website isn't updated for fall, so I can't give you names/specifics, but I'll try my best. My first cocktail featured jalapeno-infused vodka, which was decent and very refreshing. My second was a whiskey/cider ditty, which was also decent. So while cocktails aren't necessarily the draw of this place, they're certainly a lot more interesting than those you'll find (if you find any at all) at other sports bars. Just BTW for all of you pumpkin-loving folks: they DO have a pumpkin-forward cocktail (I believe it's vodka-based) that the party next to us was oohing and aahing over. Given that there aren't many options as far as sports bars go in the East Village (at least in my experience), I'd say the Grafton is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",10,4,9

45,Terence K.,"Jamaica, NY",5,82,65,4.0,5/28/2015,"This is an okay Irish bar in the East Village.  It was previously called Lunasa, but recently renovated.  Refer to Lunasa reviews and photos for help, as the establishment does not seem to have changed much since the update (yelp.com/biz/lunasa-bar-…) - though I had only been there a few times before the changes.I did not try the food, so I can't review that.  I did see it pass by and it looked good-but who knows.The beer....it's a mesh of mainstream crafts, like Brooklyn and LaGunitas, and mass produced beers, like Miller.  If you want crafts, go around the corner to Proletariat-but expect some crowding there.  The place has standard low to mid range liquors.The place has good music that's not too loud (apparently a playlist created by the boss's wife).  Lots of televisions for sports.  And a good amount of seating (including outdoor seating).  They have board games on the side of the bar, so that's fun.The clientele, on a Thursday night, seem to be regulars.  Mostly mid-30s plus, males in business attire.The staff are perfectly nice, but not very attentive on a slow Thursday.  Flag them down if you need attention on a quieter night.",3,2,

47,Ryan B.,"Greenwich, CT",0,12,6,4.0,12/24/2015,"Good drinks, outdoor patio, friendly barmen, good vibe and good food. Simple place with lovely people, just the way I like it. For me it is their steak and eggs, but if I had too much to drink, than no food, just more beer ;)Full over the weekend, not that packed at weekdays, but both are cool. Summer outside drinks are the best. Nothing special, nothing disappointing, good place for drinks.",,,
48,Tian C.,"New York, NY",89,42,37,5.0,7/27/2016,Good priced drinks and great bartender! Found this place with my coworkers after work (:,1,,
49,AJ J.,"Manhattan, NY",2,60,19,5.0,8/15/2016,"Great place to hang out, have a few drinks and play games with friends.  Staff is friendly.  They had no problems letting us bring and serve an ice cream cake - they even let us put it in their freezer prior to the big reveal.",,1,
50,Nina D.,"Houston, TX",52,3,0,5.0,11/28/2015,"My friends took me here to watch a game. Great bar and staff. Good beer selection, lots of screens and pretty much the best soft pretzel with sweet mustard outside of Germany!!! Love this place and will definitely come back on my next visit!",,,
51,Joe K.,"Merrick, NY",17,43,2,5.0,1/10/2016,"Burger was excellent. Excellent medium rare cook, fresh toppings, and a really big burger for the sides. The server was also extra nice and helpful. Overall great burger experience",1,1,1
52,Seamus R.,"Los Angeles, CA",266,15,1,5.0,11/19/2016,"Best full Irish breakfast I have had in the city. Good space friendly tenders, and best of all Sky sports on game days.",1,1,
53,Kathryn C.,"New York, NY",0,6,3,5.0,8/23/2015,"The freshest pint of Guinness this side of the Atlantic!!!!!!!!Beautifully finished decor, multiple TV screens and a lovely outdoor courtyard with picnic tables. Friendly staff, who are always up for a laugh. Great menu - the full Irish breakfast is legit.",1,3,1
54,Amanda C.,"San Francisco, CA",1273,1264,5301,3.0,6/21/2015,"Came here after eating next door at Noreetuh. The bartender wasn't friendly which docks a point and barely someone that came around to ask for our orders of drinks. Bought 6 shots of Patron for $72 (including tips) which is average for shots. The bathroom was not very clean, but what do you expect at a bar. Noise level wasn't too bad and a variety of different channels playing on all tvs (which is a plus). Probably won't return though",3,1,1
55,Sam H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,4.0,12/22/2016,"This is a well done English pub that separates itself from the formulaic America-English pub. Great place to stop off straight from work. Decent happy hour prices and some solid beers on tap, not a massive selection but more than most. Cozy, friendly bar tender, nice long bar and large leather booths. Feels very genuine. Fish and chips were pretty good. Menu is somewhat small and heavy on aps and snacks, vegetarian should be fine with about 60% of the menu. No loud booming music, lots of TVs for sporting events. $5 dollar bear of the month is a great deal, seems of have good deals for soccer games. Just my taste.",,,
56,Adrian T.,"New York, NY",254,203,0,4.0,9/13/2015,Great place to catch the game. Pretty clean for a sports bar. Food was ok and drink prices were reasonable,,1,
57,Brandon M.,"Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan, NY",27,50,2,3.0,6/5/2015,"Great vibe, had a blast watching the Rangers game. Service was average, as was the food. I'll be back though",1,1,
58,Lisa L.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",4,83,11,5.0,7/5/2015,I used to come here when this place was lunasa. I have to admit i like what they have done with the make over! The food is good and they have a great selection of drafts. I prefer coming here on Monday for Happy hour cause they have really great wine for only $5 and the bartender Nicole is always very friendly and efficient and it's never too crazy busy when a big game is on so i can always get a seat at the extra long bar. Check it out! I think you'd love it too!,,3,

60,Ben D.,"Garden City South, NY",191,4,0,5.0,9/2/2015,Great food at a great price! My BF and I bought the coupon (10 for 20). The waiter was friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place:,,,
61,Brian J.,"Whitestone, NY",77,337,3,3.0,6/5/2015,"The place is cool, but nothing special. No real happy hour specials which sucks. Have gone here since it was Lunasa and hoped there would be changes. My friend likes it so he always picks it. May need to revoke his picking card for a place with appetizer and beer specials.",1,,1
