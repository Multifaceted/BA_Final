0,James G.,"Manhattan, NY",155,97,55,5.0,5/19/2018,Food is great. Especially the catering.Eggplant and chicken is top notch. Neighborhood gem,,,
1,Christae E.,"New York, NY",18,47,23,1.0,8/10/2018,"DO NOT COME HERE!Very poor experience here this morning after trying it again after a poor previous experience.I order 2 eggs (.95 each) and a side of bacon ($1.95) and the employees charged me almost $6, which is not right even with tax included.Same thing has happened before when I have purchased lunch. Their employees are dishonest and will not honor their signage. I will never return and not be encouraging others to patronize such a place.In addition to being overpriced, the portions are small and food is mediocre, at best.",1,,
2,Noquisi B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/27/2018,"I never got to try the food because i ended up returning my order because of the terrible customer service. The cashier lady was nice but the guy taking orders & making the food needs to really not be conmunicating with people & work the stock room or something.I barely could get eye contact while my order was being taken which almost had me walk out right then & there because I got a very unfriendly vibe. I asked how much a bagel with eggs, sausage & cheese costs & he says ""5 & change"". When i get to the register the lady tries to ring me up for 7 & change. I'm like uhhhh the guy just said 5 & change & the lady says ""oh you got an extra egg"". I go to the guy & he, once again not giving eye contact with arms crossed, says ""oh you got an extra egg"". However, I never asked for an extra egg. I walked out for 20 feet & realized I simply can't be deceived & gotten over on by a rude ass guy for something I shouldn't even be eating in the first place! lol.This is my 1st ever review mainly because i didn't like having to return an item like that but I want other people & the owner/manager to know that someone else needs to be taking orders because i can't be the first person to get a cold vibe from that guy who works sunday morning. I also wanted to make sure my story gets heard & not dismissed, as ""some dumb black guy"" returned it.On top of that I just simply don't understand why I can't be told the price when I ask for it. Instead I have to get to the register & honestly, i would have just walked out if I was told my order would be that price, sparing the business the hassle of making something that no one buys. Seems really mischievous & deceitful to me to not state the price when someone asks what the price is, and to not give customers what they ordered at the price stated. I will never step foot in there again & make sure everyone i know does the same. If everything is going to be overpriced, 7 dollar bagels & rx bars for 3.79 (which are $2 at trader joes), then you at least need to have some somewhat friendly customer service.Hopefully I've helped your business improve & ward off people who don't want to overpay for food made by rude people.",1,,
3,Corinne M.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,98,8,4.0,5/8/2018,"I honestly don't understand some of the bad reviews but every experience is different. Ordered a custom sandwich, salad and seltzer. Order was accurate & received the right dressings. Reasonably priced for this area especially. My delivery was quick and well before the time they quoted me.Ham, soppressata, fresh mozz, roasted peppers & basil on a hero for $10.50 - and its delicious!",1,,2
4,Josh S.,"PRINCETON JUNCTION, NJ",126,3,0,1.0,10/11/2018,"Got a bagel with three eggs, ham and cheese. Should have cost around $6. Lady charged me $9.25. I thought it was pretty steep and asked if it was right. Then I looked at the menu with the pricing and realized she ripped me off. She looked right at me while I was figuring it out too with a pretty salty look on her face. Just moved into stuy town and was looking for a good well priced place for breakfast. This ain't it  Food was okay all things considering.",,,

Updated review","Bruno's has the best pizza in NYC!!!Bellissimo!!!!I visit Bruno's at least three times a week! The food is out rages! And the staff is very clean, helpful, and friendly!",,,
9,Dayna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,8,5,1.0,12/29/2017,"I've been coming to Bruno's for about 3 years now. Usually would order breakfast and occasionally I would order for lunch or stop by to pick something up. Their omlettes we're usually pretty good but that was always hit or miss. A few weeks ago, I tried their eggplant parm panini. It describes itself as eggplant, cheese and Bruno's famous marinara. I absolutely loved it! I loved it so much that I got it again the following week and even asked for an extra little cup of sauce (marinara) and there was no issue. The following week, I went back for it again. I enjoyed having this for lunch once a week. I asked for the extra sauce again and they said no problem. I got back to work and opened the bag and there was no extra sauce. I let that pass. But the panini itself also had no sauce on it. Usually I deal with it when they add bacon to something I ask them not to put bacon on or if they've overcooked the omlette (even one time had egg shells throughout my omlette). I decided to go back because I paid 9 dollars and wanted the sandwich the way it's supposed to be. The lady apologized for forgetting to throw the extra marinara but I told her that the Panini itself had no marinara on it like it's supposed to. She told me to open it and pour the sauce on. So I left and got back to work and poured the sauce on. Only to find it was SALSA. Like for chips or tacos. Not for an eggplant parm. Threw it away because I couldn't stomach it. It's now about 2 weeks later and I decided to give them one more chance. I asked for the eggplant parm panini and this time i watched the guy ladle the marinara into it. Got back to my desk... and this is not marinara. It's a chunky spicy salsa loaded with green peppers and onions. Moral of the story - NEVER AGAIN.",,,
10,Jay G.,"West Babylon, NY",79,102,209,3.0,7/25/2017,"This place was just mediocre to me. I've been living here for a while and finally tried it out for lunch. I got a sandwich to go. I got a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomato. The turkey was just Okay, kind of bland and dry. The lettuce wasn't the most fresh and the guy forgot to put honey mustard on my sandwich. Place is just Okay. Go if there's no other option, but wait, there's chipotle next door!",5,,2
11,Anthony A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",97,1,0,1.0,7/22/2018,I can't believe this place charged me $1.75 for a $1.00 bottle of Deer Park water. You are a bunch of thieves!!! Too many of you basic businesses overcharging for their items. If you can't afford the rent then move!!!,,,
12,Justin W.,"Huntington Station, NY",1,2,0,1.0,9/26/2018,Food is average at best. Staff is very unfriendly-seems like they don't want to be there. Been there about 3 times now. Had to wait once for help late in the day when the entire place was empty and staff was not busy. This is the closest place to my apartment for a quick bite to eat but I will start walking a little further for better quality/service.,,,
13,Marina D.,"Manhattan, NY",716,16,1,1.0,6/25/2018,Don't like this place at all. Always gets my order wrong and the food isn't good at all,,,
14,Jonathan E.,"Manhattan, NY",440,17,5,2.0,6/27/2018,"Bruno's gets the two stars for being convenient for people who live in Stuytown. But food-wise they're mediocre at best. Quality of the food is no different than any other deli, but you end up paying a premium for their decor. I wouldn't suggest any of the pastas to anyone, but if you do come here give the steak quesadillas a try.",,,
15,Jessica S.,"Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY",146,15,0,5.0,5/29/2018,"Consistent go to for all things breakfast to dinner. Plenty of variety and 95% of the time hits the nail on the head.

16,Jun Z.,"West New York, NJ",162,6,2,1.0,12/28/2017,"We ordered $1300 worth of catering from Bruno's for a holiday lunch at work. The food was a disaster; chicken was undercooked, meatloaf was too saltyand their customer service was terrible. Will not recommend",,,
17,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1212,6226,4.0,11/28/2016,"Bruno's seems to be the land of 1000 food items, but if I were you I'd stick with the eggs. Not that the other items are poor, but it's rare to find a legit breakfast platter in NYC for $5 that includes meat, potatoes, cheese and toast. Literally the SAME order costs $12-15 at the coffee shop down the street. $12-15 for eggs? gtfo. Big ups to Bruno's for keeping things affordable. Though I'm not in the area in AM'S often, this will be my breakfast spot whenever I'm around for sure.   Bonus points for having tables both inside and outside.",14,7,14

Came here for lunch upon the recommendation of a friend, and I was super impressed.Very large, great natural lighting, lots of tables, nice and clean!  The employees were also very nice!  Service with a smile =)Ah the food...This place has a ton of options!  Lots of sandwiches/paninis, 'kitchen stuff' like mashed potatoes and accompanying food, pizza, smoothies, a cafe, dessert, and so much more!  I opted for a Sicilian Slice, garlic knots, and a Hawaiian smoothie.  The crust was amazingly buttery and crispy, and the cheese was layered on thick.  Delicious!  The garlic knots were pretty good and pretty large.  4 for just under $2, not bad ^-^  The Hawaiian smoothie was pretty tasty as well.  Not overbearingly sweet and really refreshing, especially on a hot day.  Fun Fact : They have Belly!I'll for sure be back to try other things!",3,1,1
19,Dania A.,"Bronx, NY",2,16,0,1.0,1/24/2018,"I ordered online....1/2 an hour before my lunch break....food never arrived. Called the restaurant directly 4x and all I got was I'm sorry but the delivery is on its way. I ended up canceling on my 4th call since I only had 15 minutes left  of my lunch hour at that point and would not have had enough time to eat if it finally arrived. Ended up getting McDonalds (UGGGG) since it was the quickest place I could run out to. My delivery shows up 3 minutes before I'm due back at work and the driver gets upset at me for not taking the order after I told him I canceled. He said that he was late because he was stuck in traffic, mind you this place is 14 minutes away from my office and I ordered 1/2 an hour before my lunch hour actually started. I cant even give this place a star but am forced to give at least 1 !!!",,,
20,W M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,6,1.0,6/12/2018,"Got a tuna fish sandwich and paid $9.53 ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.

Don't bother going to this place for a sandwich clearly they are ripping people off go to Subway at least they list their prices. PS the tuna fish sandwich was dry as sand.",,,

They're not tiny slices either, they're pretty big and it's thin crust. New York style kind of lunch, all free. Can't complain right? This isn't Grimaldi's or Lombardi's but atleast it's not burnt or a hard crust. There's a fair amount of sauce and cheese, with the seasoning you can definitely add more flavor to it.

The cheese is stringy and there's a perfect amount of sauce in the pizzaI got two slices free with a can of soda thanks to the belly app but they have lots of other optionsNOTE: They also offer take home prepared food and I saw that the grilled salmon was only 5.50 per pound which seems like a really good deal!,5,1,4

Variety of healthy food options- there's mini bar of hot food entrees, create your own salad, sandwiches/panini's, burgers and pizza. My favorites are the pizza and smoothie. Love the thin-crust Hawaiian pizza but also the simple classic cheese pizza. The cheese, crispy crust, and tomato sauce are of the right amount and makes me want to grab another slice!

Their coffee is pretty top-notch for a deli and they have plenty of seating.They also have a very expansive lunch and dinner menu, with paninis, Italian food (obviously), and many other options.

Where do I go that will have a variety of food options that won't make my tummy turn when 2am strikes? Bruno's.I haven't tried many items yet but I frequent the salad bar. They have a number of different types of lettuce to choose from and the soup/salad guy tumbles it all together into a container that will stay fresh and tasty until I am able to enjoy it hours later. The vegetables always look fresh which says a lot for coming at 6:45pm when typical lunch time has been over for hours already. I've had a few pastry/desserts that are kept in the front by the register. (Hard to pass up sweets when they're looking you straight in the eye at check out!) Some of the baked gourmet cookies are hard as rocks. This isn't something I will judge them on since I am going for these items so late in the day. And I've repeatedly purchased!I will be back.

They often have 4 or 5 people standing around while no one helps you. Today they were just outright aggressive about giving me a 10% (44 cents in this case) discount because I live in stuy town. The day before I was given the discount and told it was a new promotion then was yelled at when I asked about it today. I didn't even care about the discount just don't like being yelled at by the person I'm trying to give money to.Summary: they need to learn about customer service.,,,1

Updated review","Like the place, but they recently started emailing promotions - which none of the staff are aware of, so when you try to use one of them, you either can't or the staff looks at you like you're lying.They recently emailed a promotion where you could get a $5 giftcard if you wrote a Yelp review.

51,George T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,22,5,2.0,11/13/2015,"Just ordered lunch from here after a long hiatus and now I remember why.  I'm not a very demanding customer and I rarely complain.  However, we ordered 8 various types of Italian hero's and I specified 2 things and 2 things only.  Wrap the sandwiches in paper, not saran wrap (it makes good, crunchy  Italian bread, soft and soggy).  Second, was to use seeded semolina bread on all of the hero's.  They failed on both, although the receipt/order had all of the correct information on it.  The guys making the sandwiches clearly just don't pay attention I have no idea  how a good Italian deli wraps their sandwiches in saran wrap.  It defies logic.  It just doesn't work.  The deli ingredients were all very good and of high quality.  But it ended there.  Clearly not a place you want to order delivery from, they just don't get it right.",1,,
52,Marcelle C.,"New York, NY",45,46,5,2.0,2/23/2016,"Went there for the first time today and ordered a grilled cheese deluxe (I'm surprised that they don't have a veggie burger option). On the menu, under the burgers and grilled cheese, it says that all above include tomato and lettuce. I confirm with the guy at the register and he says that it does not include tomato and lettuce... Dude, it says it right above your head! I point that out and he continues to deny it. What?! I'm so confused... But whatever, add the lettuce and tomato and charge me extra. At this point, I decide I won't be back...Place is small and ordering and waiting for the food is just dumb. I guess if you just HAVE to go there, order ahead of time or sit down... It's difficult if it's normal lunch time or if you don't plan on staying. Food was ok. Stingy with the cheese but good job with the bread. A lot of fries but kinda bland so ask for salt or make sure you get ketchup.",,,

Recently ventured inside and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and deserts they offer, and happy to announce I am indeed a fan.All of their prepared entrees are delicious and I know this will sound a bit weird but the Italian breads they use and sell are really good. Crispy on the outside, soft doughy inside, a nice crackle when you engage. What I mean is this, if I need bread, I go to Bruno's.The place itself is still pretty bland and lacking over-all curb appeal, but I prefer more steak than the sizzle.

56,R Y.,"Manhattan, NY",43,271,342,2.0,4/3/2012,"This place got an average of 2. Their pizzas were 3 as whole and red velvet cupcake 1.My friend and I walked in here wanting to munch on something small.We decided to go check out their pizzas because they looked so delicious! Their slice with tomato, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato sauce was pretty good. The sauce was seasoned and the tomato slices were placed on the slices very pretty. However, wasn't a fan of the fact that where ever cheese was, there was absolutely no sauce. If anything, more sauce would have been better for this crunchy slice. We also grabbed chicken slice and like many breaded chicken cubes on a pizza, theirs was dry. Still, the sauce on the pizza was good. Their crust is more thin than thick and crunchy than chewy. Overall, pizza was a 3. Now, for the cupcake. My eyes went over to the variety of pastries they were selling. After reading the review on the red velvet, I bought one. Sadly, it was dreadful. I have no idea which cupcake this other reviewer got her red velvet, but there is no way it could be from this place. The cupcake's frosting was gummy and when you poke it with your fork, it bounced back like rubber band. Also, the red velvet cake tasted old and the little edges sticking out was hard. Must have been old cupcake. eww..I may walk in again if I'm around the neighborhood for their ravioli. It is called the King of Ravioli, right? So, their ravioli must be great-right??Well, overall, pizza was edible but that red velvet cupcake is something I want to forget.",,,1

Part of me thinks I should have known better getting a pastry from a place where pastries are probably an afterthought. But there was no expecting how stale this thing was. This pastry tasted like it was from a few days ago. I've never had a pastry this stale. The cream tasted like marshmallows that were mashed up and mixed with whipped cream. Disgusting. I'm giving them two stars because the staff were friendly and the place was clean with lots of seating but I certainly won't be back.",1,,

For example the pizza's a good price, they've also got a pasta lunch special with a good amount of pasta for about $6 which includes bread. You can also get half a sandwich and they have a good selection of those. The salads are expensive however, and the dressing does not taste like the right dressing. I once ordered Ceasar dressing and it didn't taste like it at all. It wasn't creamy enough. My salad ended up like $10.50 when by my house I get one for $7 and that includes all the toppings I get(chicken being the most expensive obv).

Better than your average lunch time deli, but nothing truly stands out. Everything looks really good and you can get a soup and salad combo for a under $7.

One with prepared food like jerk chicken, cajun salmon, string beans, etc. Another with pizza, pasta, garlic balls, etc. Another soup, salad, sandwich station.

(The guys at the deli are friendly, but slow!)I have yet to try the ravioli, but there are boxes of it in the cooler. Looks like lots of yummy flavors including pumpkin, spinach, lobster, and of course the typical meat and cheese.

Used a groupon here, but what I got wasn't even worth the half price. What I got-1.) A white slice with tomato- the poorest looking slice of the whole pie, with almost no tomato slices on top. I was instantly peeved. It was only so-so anyway, and even the best tomato slices wouldn't have saved it. Still, I wanted my damn tomato.2.) Some garlic knots- Meh. Only saving grace was the generosity with the garlic.3.) -A mini ciabatta loaf- stale and hard, almost inedible.4.) Frozen cheese raviolis- these are the only reason I even bothered with 2 stars. They are pretty damn good ravioli, albeit somewhat under-spiced even for plain ricotta cheese raviolis. Paired with a good tomato sauce or some aromatic basil, garlic, olive oil and generous sprinkle of salt for a more delicate, fresh flavor.Since I already paid for a second groupon, I'll go back and do my best to not judge based on my poor first experience.

87,Ryan G.,"Manhattan, NY",20,51,17,3.0,5/9/2012,"Well now...Before I'm even starting this review I'm sad.For it is my duty as a yelper to be honest, and I don't want to be. This place is a conundrum. I'd rate it a 4 and a 1 in two different reviews if I could.I'll make this quick and start with the the good things.+Location and layout-  Out door seating. huge open inside. Lots and lots of visible food which I like, so you see what you are getting.+Coffee is exceptionally good.  Worth coming here just for the coffee. Even some of the wacky flavored stuff I've tried here was great.+Quality of food. Pizza here in particular along with the pre-made italiany stuff and salads are solid. You really can't go wrong with anything. With its huge selection food does range from good to very good according to the day and item not the greatest consistency of the same item from day to day though.Now the bad-This place is too busy for their systems... Actually, what systems?!?!  It's as if the management not only never ran a (gourmet) deli before, but they've never even been inside one. This is the root of all other evil here I believe.-It takes serious aggression to just order a salad sometimes. The pizza section being the easiest.   Every section is different, its almost impossible to even buy something at one station and also want something from somewhere else unless you are willing to not only pay twice, but wait on line twice.-Some people on staff act as if customers are an inconvenience, because they are. Really they are. This place does a lot of business in catering I think because everybody helping customers is also helping put together other orders. Everybody is always busy doing something. Its impossible to tell who's next in line because there is no line and its impossible for the staff to tell who is suppose to be next. So everybody is trying to get their attention and you can never tell who is suppose to be helping customers. Side note* Managers will be walking around ""supervising"" bs-ing with each other or staff or customers they know instead of doing ANYTHING. If you mistakenly get the attention of one of them to start saying what you'd like, you'll get a stink eye and still no service.-Nickel and dimed.   I'm not looking for them to give the world away for free... but on a number of occasions being charged for things like a side of honey mustard I feel is a little much.Even with all the difficulties this place has, the food overcomes the bad and it is worth checking out if its not lunch rush time.",2,1,1

I can't say is the best in NY because I don't usually buy fresh pasta ( but I have done sometimes in the supermarket and they were nothing special).

They ask how you want your burger to be cooked and you can choose to either have fries or onion rings. The burger itself never disappoints. They put the cheese in the middle of the well-seasoned patty, which is a great touch. The fries are really good here, very crunchy and once you eat one, you end up eating most of them before even touching your burger.

One day, my friend an I went in for a quick lunch. We both got pizza. I was planning to get original, but I saw this slice with veggies on top ( LOADS of veggies ) and I couldn't resist.

Can't complain about the pizza counter service, but i haven't really been there at rush hours.  The prepared fish/meats/veggies counter came in handy for a big dinner party we were hosting, the tilapia and salmon were both very nice.  Even bought a great flourless chocolate cake there as well.  The paninis are tasty, and so are the sandwiches, both fair values.  I find the ready-salads a bit overpriced, as well as the bottled drinks, but the handmade pasta in the same section is excellent.  I bought the linguini and it went really well with my own pesto. The ready-made three cheese ravioli is also excellent.  The soup bar is also a good deal and always tasty.  Good chowder and chicken stew.  Nothing here is mind-blowing, but a great option if you're short on time and ideas and in the stuy-town/gram. park area.",3,,1
