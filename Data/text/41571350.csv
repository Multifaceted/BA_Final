0,Stephanie G.,"Walnut, CA",0,7,5,5.0,8/6/2018,"I""m so glad that we decided to stay in the Roosevelt Hotel for our five-day stay in NYC! The staff were super friendly and accommodating. Even though the hotel was very full the weekend we checked in, they tried their best to get us into our room as soon as possible and they offered to keep our bags - which was very helpful and allowed us to explore NYC in the morning before our check-in. Everyone we encountered was very nice and we made nice conversation with pretty much everyone we encountered. During one of our stays, we ate at the breakfast/brunch restaurant at the hotel. One of the chefs, Fernando German Solier, came up to our table and greeted us. He was very friendly and the food he and his staff prepared was absolutely delicious! He constantly came to make sure that the food was up to our expectations - and it always was! I definitely recommend the Tuscan toast, which was avocado toast and had edible flowers. The breakfast buffet was fresh and really satisfying and filling. We also had dessert prepared by Antonino, which was absolutely delicious! Our waiter, Tomas Jorge, was also wonderful and helped make our brunch awesome! There were so many people who came to our table and made us feel welcome to NYC - I wish I could remember all their names, but we will definitely always remember how they made us feel like family! It was clear that the staff works amazingly together as a team. The rooms were very clean. We got two queen beds which were also clean and comfortable. The staff responsible for cleaning the rooms always left the room spotless. It was nice to have a clean and cozy place to come back to after a long day of walking around the city. In addition, the hotel has a nice gym that we made sure to take advantage of. The location of the hotel is also really great. There are several stores nearby and we were also very close to Grand Central Terminal, which takes you virtually everywhere within NYC. We also used this to get to JFK airport, which was very convenient. Overall, I'm very glad that we chose The Roosevelt Hotel as our home during our trip in NYC! I would definitely recommend anyone to stay there and to enjoy everything the hotel provides, especially the yummy food! Thank you again The Roosevelt Hotel Staff!!!",2,,
1,Cassie M.,"Minneapolis, MN",22,176,735,2.0,10/31/2018,"Don't let the stunning hotel lobby fool you, though it is stunning. The guest rooms, not so much. I'm sure this place was nice in its prime. But let's be real, that was probably like 90 years ago. The website boasts, ""a taste of old school New York continually serving guests since the Jazz Age of the 1920s."" It's 2018. I like music from the jazz age, but not my hotel rooms. At first I thought the negative reviews on here were too harsh, but after four days, they proved accurate. Poor service, limited amenities, some outlets in the room did not work, and overall overpriced. Rooms are reminiscent of something more on La Quinta's level but for $$$ level pricing. (No offense to LQ.) Customer service is abysmal from the front desk staff, particularly Manana, who is absolutely unwilling to help, but eager to push you aside and tell you to wait for somebody else who may be available in a few minutes. If you're coming for a great central midtown Manhattan location and a place to lay your head and rest your weary feet, this will do the trick. If you want anything else, like a pretty room, or a coffee maker, or wifi (that doesn't cost $19.95/day), or a bathroom that is larger than your wingspan, or your shampoo restocked, consider looking elsewhere. If you do end up here, you can request a coffee maker from the front desk to be be delivered (otherwise not included in room), although you may have to keep requesting coffee to be restocked daily as well.",,,
2,David E.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,13,0,1.0,9/17/2018,"Appears to be just milking faded glory. The service was unacceptable for the price. Check in on a Thursday night took 20 minutes. The bored slightly rude receptionist was chewing gum and talking to a coworker while reluctantly and slowly handling guests without speaking to them. Security desk was unstaffed 3 out of 4 nights I entered the hotel. Concierge was not polite. Doormen never greeted me and never said anything beyond telling my driver to get lost. Despite three cabs waiting out front they were unable to get me a cab to soho, apparently all waiting on only airport fares. Rooftop bar has disappointing hours so I never got to visit it - closed Sunday night, closed at 10 on Friday night. $40 facility fee is completely unjustifiable nonsense for what is provided. Room was sort of ok. Clearly an older property, lobby looks grand but rooms are small and worn and bathroom barely fits the toilet and tub. Drape was frayed and partially falling off hangar. 9th floor had enough street noise you want to remember your earplugs. Location is excellent. Room seemed clean and there was hot water, so minimum standard was met, but for the price the service was unforgivably disappointing. I have been treated much better in every random holiday inn I have ever stayed in. There are much better choices within two blocks which still value their reputations.",,,
3,Alexus H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2,5,2,1.0,9/1/2018,"3After a redeye flight from Arizona, I was so excited to check into this hotel as the pictures via Priceline were amazing. My husband is an expert bidder on the Priceline secret deals and has never failed to win amazing 4-star hotels. When we arrived, the lobby was breathtaking. However, when we got to our room, we were in for molded carpets, a sub par air conditioner, peeling walls, dusty vents, and outlets that did not work. My in-laws had checked in two days earlier and immediately had to complain to the staff that their room smelt of urine. The staff was incredibly rude and insisted it was my in-laws' sense of smell rather than the hotel. Nonetheless, they moved them to a different room--which still smelled like urine, only a little less. Also to add to their disappointment, behind the bathroom door was a chunk of dust, hair, and mold all wrapped into one. Despite staying at the hotel from Sunday evening through Thursday morning, the chunk never left the premises. We have since complained to Priceline as this is not a 4-star hotel and should not be rated at the same.",3,,
4,Tina B.,"Waldorf, MD",0,22,34,1.0,11/17/2018,I will never stay at this hotel again. The location was great but that's about it. The price of the room is way too high for the service we received and the condition of the room. Our first room had a horrible smell so we asked to be moved. The second room smelled better but looked just as bad. I wasn't expecting a large hotel room but this one...well take a look at the pictures. There wasn't even enough room to open the bathroom door all the way. Cleanliness is not a priority either. It was just gross. I would advise staying elsewhere.,,,
5,Neil L.,"Central Business District, Worcester, MA",491,2,1,2.0,11/4/2018,A disappointing hotel. Rooms are small and need renovation. Hallways seriously need paint. Room was unavailable until 3pm. No free wiifi. No coffee in room. DONT BE FOOLED BY THE LOBBY,1,,
6,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",395,4085,7998,1.0,6/20/2018,"Gosh, everything on the first page of photos on this Yelp entry is so staged and so misleading. The typical room here is a tiny affair with little wiggle room, beaten-up furniture, next-to-inoperable ventilation, and rancid decor. Don't even get me started on the bathrooms where the tubs are cracked and the walls and ceilings chipped. Matt T. is also on point when it comes to being shaken down by the bellhops for bag storage. While it is an unspoken courtesy to tip, it's downright tacky to demand tips up front, no matter how many of your guests come from places where tipping is not the norm.The mandatory ""amenity fee"" is an added insult, especially if 1) you don't use said amenities and 2) said amenities aren't worth using anyway. These days, anyone can tether to their own cell phone for fast, reliable internet access, while all the free walking opportunities that the city offers will be superior to any exercise that can be done in their joke of a fitness center. Even if many other NYC hotels are engaging in this amenity fee extortion, most of them are legitimate ones and not borderline dumps like this place.It's all a class action lawsuit waiting to happen. District Attorney Vance and Attorney General Underwood, are you listening?",10,3,4
7,Baltazar R.,"Beaverton, OR",69,159,1210,1.0,1/21/2018,"SERVICE: Awful for many reasons:-  Front desk clerks seemed to have no training on greeting guests, something you expect as a minimum in any service industry. No smile, distracted all the time, conversing on cell phones while attending guests.- The greeter at the front door is always pushing for their own taxi service, to a point where he said ""I'm happy whenever an Uber is not booked"". Long story short, taxi driver charged $30 more than an Uber, in ""toll fees"".- Good luck getting service in the restaurant bar!INFRASTRUCTURE: Old, pretty old.- Out of 6 small elevators (Place is old, so max of 6-7 people per elevator), only 4 are functional at a given time.- Showers' temperature is hard to control. Expect bursts of cold and scorching hot water while showering.- Upon arrival, the smoke detector was beeping. A new battery was enough to fix this.DECOR: Beautiful. However you don't need to spend the night, you can just come in and have a drink to enjoy the view of the lobby. LOCATION: Good. A few blocks from Times Square.PRICE: Great price for a Manhattan hotel but expensive for what you get.",4,1,
8,Naoki Y.,"Houston, TX",124,21,40,1.0,6/5/2018,"Worst hotel ever!!! Terrible from inside and out. I tired to ask a doorman a question he just ignored me, the front desk had a slight attitude and was rushing us to next customer. Then we get to the room get worseeeeeeeeee.The room was so small nothing like on Expedia and all the wall has been painted over and over again without properly removing paint.all the trims in the room were falling apart. The door jam hinge is broken with screw popped off. Not to mention our view was s roof top with a homeless persons tent area we have to look at.Becareful!!! The restroom vent doesn't work so that causes mold all over the paper wall I  the restroo. That has not been replace for decadesThis place is a shot hole for the price you pay. They detract you with the glamorous lobby but the everything else is falling apart along with staff",6,1,
9,Lori M.,"Milwaukee, WI",263,309,268,1.0,12/9/2017,"I hate to give one stars honestly I'd give it no stars if Yelp would let me. We were so excited about staying here from the pics and the website but it turned into a nightmare! Lobby was very beautiful with Christmas lights and the bar so it was with high aspirations we hit the up key and then we waited and waited and waited. 15 minutes later we got on an elevator.We walked into the room where there was a glass sitting outside the door. We thought okay weird but went in to the room. Small room looked like an old Best Western. Next I went to the bathroom, no bath just a shower...a shower that had mold and hair on the tile....Really! 400 a night room for a ""cozy king""! Hubby called the front desk and the moved us immediately to a ""supreme king"".The supreme king was in the 9th floor with horns blaring from the street. There was a refrigerator beside our door in the hallway. My husband called down to ask them to move the refrigerator from the hall. We walked into the room and there was a bed a clock and one picture, it was just sparse.By this time it was midnight so we just dealt with it. I went to the bathroom to wash my face and open a washcloth with makeup all over it! Where is quality control? There was mold coming out from behind the peeling wallpaper and dirt on the vents so thick I felt unhealthy even spending one night.The bed was okay kind of hard but we could sleep in it. Hubby tried to go to get me a coffee and danish the next morning and had to walk down 9 floors because an elevator didn't come after 20 minutes. The cafe was wiped out of any breakfast food. Did I mention the refrigerator was still sitting outside our door?We decided to leave the hotel cancelling our next three nights. They did let us out of the ""cancellation policy"" but only took off 25% for the night we stayed. Usually I would never ask for a discount but dirty rooms and having to move hotels should have been a much deeper discount! I am sure at one time this was a grand hotel but the owners need to start refurbishing and check into the mold situation. Also housekeeping obviously needs some quality control training to make sure rooms are clean and free of tripping hazards like refrigerators by your door .",7,,2
10,Kim H.,"Dallas, TX",72,4,0,1.0,10/28/2018,"I was so disappointed in this hotel but mostly in the staff here. I know New York hotel rooms are typically small, but this one is the smallest room I've stayed in, the worst room & probably the most expensive bad experience I've had at an average of $600/night. I can't deny that the location & lobby are exquisite- that's why they get at least 1 Star. My bathroom tub had half of the lining scraped off, the carpet was dirty as were the drapes. The best word to describe the room was dingy. That's not event the biggest problem! The electricity went off in my room for hours each night! I was in a small dingy room by myself unable to turn on any lights - it was eerily scary! When I talked to the hotel staff at the front desk & told them about the they seemed indifferent. It's as if it happens all the time & for $600/night in midtown I shouldn't also expect electricity. When I asked to move rooms they told me I couldn't because the hotel was overbooked. I also asked them if I could just cancel my reservation for the following two nights so I could find a room with electricity all night, they told me I could only cancel the 3rd night. I was stuck having to stay there because I didn't want to pay $1200 for a room that night to get a new one elsewhere & pay for the 2nd night at The Roosevelt. In fact I left New York a day early toAvoid having to stay here the last night. I'm very disappointed that a hotel that is iconic in New York could have such bad service. It's clear that they aren't hurting for Customers, but they couldn't pay me to stay here again & I urge you not to stay here!",1,,
11,Rachel L.,"Bellaire, TX",481,2,0,1.0,8/24/2018,"Walked in and thought, wow this is beautiful! Don't deny that the location is great and so is the lobby, but that was all overshadowed by how horrific the rest of my experience was. To start with, I had paid for my entire stay on Booking.com but got hit with a surprise facility fee for $50/day. According to the paper I received, the fee was for the gym, discounts, wifi, and phone calls. Except surprise surprise because when I tried to use the wifi I was asked for $20. Also, by the way, who charges for phone calls in this day and age? So for the next four days I literally did not touch anything in my room (not the phone, not the tv, not the wifi) and yet the following day I was hit with a $380 charge. Fast forward and in the four days I stayed there, they charged me $1022 for no reason. I called multiple times and got a variety of answers. The first time I called about the facility fee, I was told that it was a deposit and that I would be returned my money after checking out, provided I hadn't used the discounts, wifi, or made phone calls. On top of that, I confronted the front desk about the rest of the fees, and I was told that they returned all my money and that they were so sorry for the inconvenience that they wouldn't charge me the $250 facility fee (wow how so generous, am I right?) Long story short, still waiting to get my money back, have not enjoyed my stay (the lobby is deceivingly nice and is not indicative of the rooms), and have been wildly impressed by how poorly this entire hotel is run.Even checking out, the woman was downright rude and kept repeating, ""No charge!"" despite the fact that I've literally had $1000 taken out of my account by them in the last three days. Won't be back and will be telling people about my experience at every opportunity I can.",2,,
12,Aidan E.,"Pennington, NJ",175,5,0,2.0,11/15/2018,"Upon arrival to The Roosevelt Hotel, I was very impressed with the grand lobby and great location. However my impression did a 180 real quick. The sheets are equivalent to shower curtain liners, the bathroom is a shoebox, and the staff at the hotel bar are rude and inattentive. This hotel has great potential but not until they take a trip to Sleepy's for some quality pillows",,,
13,Cheinette V.,"Colorado Springs, CO",8,25,10,1.0,10/24/2018,Had to stand in line for 20 minutes. Staff was extremely rude. Did not get the room we were promised. Horrible place.  The pictures do not look like the website!!!,,,
14,J Z.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,23,3,3.0,10/19/2018,"The facility fee $40 which I never used was a joke and a rip-off. Overall, disappointed including the front desk and door men. This was my 5th time staying there. The first time was 1994. I remember the elevators were still old in a good way back then. I'm not sure if I will ever stay there again. I hope the management will see the reviews and make an effort to improve.",,1,
15,Margaret S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/25/2018,"The worst customer service I have received in long time. Called to speak with reservations who didn't let me get a word in edgewise when attempting to add a name to my reservation. Then told me to call back and hit 8 to be directed to the front desk for them to change it. Spoke with someone at the front desk named Lisa who unbelievably rude, aggressive and should not be permitted to work in the hospitality industry. I haven't even checked into the hotel yet and immediately regretting my decision to stay there. Will be having a conversation with the manager upon check in. So disappointing.",,,
16,Rachel L.,"Baltimore, MD",148,331,681,4.0,2/11/2018,"I have always considered New York City to be one of the greatest cities in America - sorry Baltimore. So when The Roosevelt Hotel invited me to for a two night stay, I was more than thrilled. NYC is home to some of the most creative and inventive food on the East Coast. Plus the hotel is seriously stunning. My pictures don't do the place justice. And fun fact, my Grandparents came here on their honeymoon at least 60 years ago!The Roosevelt Hotel is located in Midtown just blocks from Grand Central Station and Times Square. So of course I made it a point to visit both during my trip. I also grabbed breakfast both days of my visit at The Roosevelt Grill inside of the hotel.Their breakfast spread is seriously awesome. They have a breakfast buffet which I opted not to do in favor of the Roosevelt Favorites. The first day I started with The New Yorker. It was smoked salmon served with a toasted bagel and cream cheese and it really fueled me up for the day ahead. The salmon was so fresh and I was able to pile it as high as I liked onto my perfectly toasted bagel. And yes, this was the real deal New York Bagel - not a roll with a hole as I refer to most of what they're serving in Baltimore. It was firm with a nice chew without being doughy. Really the best kind of bagel around.My friend ordered the Roosevelt Eggs which I had a bite of (she also ordered them the second day for breakfast). They're an order of eggs your way and she went with scrambled eggs and a side of bacon which is such a classic combination. The bacon was thick cut and crispy. It was beyond perfect. The eggs were also pillowy soft and scrambled to perfection. Breakfast is one of life's simple pleasures and The Roosevelt Grill executed this dish perfectly.After trying the eggs the day prior, I knew I needed to eat them again and ordered an Omelet. The Roosevelt Grill has a few different options that you can add to the eggs, I went with cheddar cheese, asparagus, peppers, and mushrooms. I customized the omelet to my liking, so of course I liked it. Plus there was plenty of cheese oozing out, the ideal brunch.",2,,1
17,Carlie S.,"Winter Park, FL",413,93,252,1.0,1/16/2018,I hate writing bad reviews but everything about my stay here was miserable. I booked this hotel through Priceline.com which I also wouldn't recommend. The only pro if this hotel is its location. It's 2 blocks from Grand Central station and a great food hall. The cons: - Insanely crowded. At almost every hour of the day there's a line in the lobby waiting - minuscule rooms - terrible consumer service - high cost for what you get - elevators are a nightmareSorry but if you're considering this place run away unless your room is stupid cheap and you can handle all the reasons why people are rating this place so low.,6,1,3
18,Matt T.,"University, Denver, CO",0,3,0,1.0,6/20/2018,"This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed at, ever. The rooms are dingy and dated, the ventilation is awful so the whole place smells, and the service is unbelievably bad.

No glassware, no minibar, no amenities at all. Nothing upgraded.  Just big, unusable space with shabby carpeting and 30 year old wall paper.  I'm 100 yards from the elevator. Terrible.",,,
20,June S.,"New York, NY",189,551,4066,2.0,6/14/2017,"We stayed at this hotel for just one night on a weekend. We had a Superior King Room.The first thing we noticed was the check-in process. It was VERY slow. Not that there were many people trying to check in-out, but it took a long time for each customer to get checked in or out. When it was finally our turn, they first could not find our reservation, which was very alarming, but the staff went back to speak with the manager, and it was sorted out without issue. Then the elevators. Even though they seem to have plenty of elevators, they are super slow. Expect a good few minutes minimum to catch an elevator. And I hope that one is not completely full... And the lights inside the elevators don't work on most of them, so everyone kept pushing the floor buttons... The room was vary nice size, big and spacious, great amount of natural light coming in from windows. We had a large bedroom, living room, and two bathrooms. As you might have read from other reviews, they are in fact, outdated from top to bottom. The furniture, floor, everything. This includes the walls and windows. Unlike the newer hotels or newly renovated hotels, the noise from the outside comes in more than it should... And as the building right next to us were under construction, we hard construction noise from early morning into the night.And yes, the location is great! I loved that about this hotel. We could walk to many great restaurants, shops, Bryant Park and such. It was great. As we checked out in the morning, we asked if we could leave our two little bags with the front desk for a couple of hours. They instructed us to go to the porters's section, and they also told us that we need pay a holding fee for the bags. It doesn't matter how large or small the size of your bag is, the fee was the same. I do think it is time for them to really consider renovating. I understand it is costly, but you will gain more happy customers...",4,,
21,Oscar G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,4,0,1.0,10/10/2018,"I forget a pair of shoes, a belt and my son forgot his new stuff animal that he won at Dave and Busters. Emailed security to see if my items were found. I sent 2 emails and I finally had to call to speak with someone. I was forwarded to the voice mail of Diane Perkins. She was not avaliable so left a message. She did call me back and left message letting me know that she responded to my initial email 16 days after; which I never received. Long story short don't forget anything in your room because it will be stolen. I don't care about my stuff but when my son is asking me about ""Sharkey"" on an almost nightly basis, it breaks my heart. He worries if he's not scared and if they are treating him well.

YES.First of all, you're literally right there, all the shopping, all the things to do! If you want to find a nice hotel to stay at for your first trip to manhattan, I say go for it. I booked through Priceline, and got a very affordable price for a 5 night stay. I wasn't disappointed at all. Checking in, I was surprised to get a king size bed! My Priceline check in was only for a queen. I did not complain at all. During check out, it was simple, I didn't have to pay a dime since I paid Priceline.Here's what I did love. We checked out at 1130 (they allowed us late check out to get pushed until 12. I just needed leeway to finish packing. But we checked in our luggage's with the bellhop! Free service, we just tipped, of course. That way we still had more time to explore and eat lunch before our flight. I didn't have to change or anything, so it was perfect to leave our bags there. I didn't want to waste a single minute. Here's a couple small reasons why I give it 4 instead of 5...As a woman, getting ready in front of a mirror, there was no where to put my things near the sink in front of the mirror, so I had to sit on the floor and get ready with the mirror on the outside of the bathroom door.Another last thing, they were doing maintenance on the elevators so there were only 3 working elevators during my stay. It called for longer wait times to get down and back up, but It didn't ruin our itinerary.Overall, i don't regret staying here one bit. It's close enough to everything that I wanted, without being so crazy in the middle of Times Square! I saw the hotels around there, wouldn't feel comfortable hauling luggage into such a busy area! This area is busy, but the entrance into the hotel is kind of off to the side so getting of an Uber wasn't rushed.",5,1,1
26,David W.,"Newburgh, IN",47,263,2398,4.0,8/8/2018,"We were 3 nights here and had a wonderful stay. The staff were all friendly, especially the maids and the folks at the front desk. The room was clean. The AC worked fine. I recommend that you put something on top of it to keep the curtains pushed against the window. I think this helps keep it cooler because the air is directed into the room and not behind the curtain. There is a safe in the closet. The refrigerator worked fine. Plenty of water pressure. No problem with having hot water. I wish they would put a small table in the bathroom to set things on. There is limited counter space in there. My one complaint is that I was required to pay the daily fee for Internet. No exceptions. I didn't need it.  I was unaware of that when I booked my room. I used it and it was very fast, so at least I can't complain about it. The hotel is very close to several midtown attractions.  It's an easy walk to Times Square, and right around the corner from Grand Central Station. I would definitely stay here again.",3,,1

Many great attractions are within walking distance including Times Square and Grand Central. I highly recommend it.  My only knock, thus 4 stars instead of 5 is that it needs renovating. Older decor, carpet needs replacing, as does the air conditioning system. Those are all minor however based on my overall level of satisfaction. Enjoy your stay.",1,,

The room we had the first night smelled like smoke to the point where it seemed like a chain smoker had been in there before us.  We immediately tried to switch rooms and couldn't because they were sold out. The next day when we tried to switch rooms we were given attitude about not packing up our things and storing them in the lobby early in the morning so they could switch us. We did eventually get into a nice room but not without issue.The staff at the lobby bar are incredibly slow and spent more time ignoring us and serving us. One night we waited so long at the bar for service that we wound up leaving after 20 minutes or so after being ignored by all the bartenders and waiters.Finally, it seemed like only one of the elevators was working in the hotel. The wait time for an elevator was 5 to 10 minutes and even then we were grateful to be on a high floor so we could actually get on the elevator. They got so full so quickly based on the delay that people on the floor 10 and below just had to wait longer.I have stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel before. It's in a great location and it's got a great bit of history. But if the customer service, quality of accommodations and elevator time doesn't change, I will not be back.",,1,1
32,Ishmael M.,"Los Angeles, CA",288,18,0,1.0,2/11/2018,"They charged my card 5-6 times for one night. Then reversed the charge (allegedly. Still waiting on the money to show back up) and comped me a room for another night. Sounds good right? NOPE! They charged me AGAIN for that room. There are about 10 different managers I've dealt with in the past 24 hours so hard to keep track or keep anyone accountable. I'm waiting for a call back for them to resolve this. I'm LIVID. Terrible! They just charge away!UPDATE: 3 days and funds have still not be returned to my bank account. Catching my flight later and had to book a room somewhere else for one more night on credit as the Roosevelt Hotel has stolen a few hundred dollars they're claiming to refund me. The person who initially checked me in a caused all of this was a clerk named Paulette. It's been downhill from there and multiple incompetences. Manager, Dennis is polite and helpful but he's about the only one & even still, defended and made excuses for the Roosevelt failure which as a customer is the last thing I should have to deal with.",5,,

Low expectations are very helpful here. Location is great next to Grand Central. Lobby is nice and not an embarrassment if you need to meet someone there.Expect to take the stairs a lot if you want to get anywhere, so bring comfortable shoes! I was on the 9th floor and took stairs up and down most of the time - the elevators are sooo slow at nearly all normal hours. I was amazed the one time I didn't have to wait.Felt bad for the Delta pilots that stay here, they're regulars and used to the elevator issues. The elevators are a common bond you'll have with all the other patrons here. Budget extra time for check out: (1) elevator for luggage, (2) front desk line can get long, and (3) valet often takes a long time & need to request car from front desk. Don't expect any special service. Seems like the employees don't really want to be there either; can't say I blame them. Daily resort fee might be mandatory.There is some strategy with the elevator - most importantly, get in no matter if it's going up or down. Or else you could waste another 15min for the next one.",3,4,

She then told me that she would go speak to her manager for my simple request, only to come back another 10 minutes later and tell me that she was wrong and that I was right. Doormen did not even acknowledge any guests the entire time that I was there. I then was charged $120 after checking out because they did not return my security deposit after I left my room spotless and left the maids a hefty tip. Will NOT be returning!!!",,,

It's fairly easy to get to.  They only offer valet parking, running $50-$70 a night, depending on the size of your vehicle.  Check-in was average...they were fairly busy.   Office staff were courteous.  They have six elevators, none of which are very fast.   I was staying on the sixth floor and I found myself walking down the stairs instead of waiting on the elevators.  I stayed in a room with two double beds. The rooms are average, not overly spacious.  No fridge or coffee maker in the room.  I requested a fridge (at a charge $25) but never got it.  I requested extra towels one night and they brought them quickly.  Never used room service but it is available.  They charge a $25 per day ""resort fee"" that includes your wifi access and fitness center.  My favorite thing about the hotel is the location.  Located in midtown Manhattan only a block from Grand Central Station.  It was easy to get to all the major attractions on the island.  Lots of great eating and shopping nearby.",6,,1

41,Ula Z.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,9,14,1.0,8/3/2017,"I would give them a zero, but since there is no zero option I guess I have to go with one star!Today I am very disappointed! I've stayed at a few different hotels in New York City and Roosevelt is the one I chose to stay at this time because of the convenient midtown location. I've stayed before and while it wasn't 5 star, It was ok. But now its different. It's in old hotel and I get the whole nostalgic thing  and all. I love nostalgia, but old doesn't mean it should be broken down!!!!Let's start with my getting out of my taxi. I watched the doorman who eventually assisted me with our bags finish his phone conversation before he could get to my family. It was a good minute wait. Then I get to the lobby and we checked in.  Agent was nice and said she got us a deluxe king room on the 14th floor. I was good with that! Happy...it sounded good. So  I turn to get on elevator and my 4 year old points out ""mommy look at the big tape patch on the floor."" I look down and in this amazingly beautiful carpet that spanned the whole floor of the check in area, there was what I guess is a tear with some ugly brown tape all over it.  That made me wonder how could such a magnificent place not fix the carpet. I mean this was the area at which point the hotel was to impress me with first impressions. I let that go, because things happen right??!!!So I get to the room and my jaw dropped because I was surprised as to how much if a dump the place has become.  Regular room, but it was certainly the little things that caught my attention.I felt like I was at a motel and not a hotel. I would have rather stayed at a chain brand than get this for my $250 a night. So the outlets don't work (but they put an outlet strip on the floor like In was in some office), curtains are dirty with holes in them,  lamp shades are cracked and look nasty, carpet is rotted and peeling off the base of the wall, bathroom floor is dingy and tub is dirty.  Then what really pissed me off is that someone else's hair was in the sink, meaning they didn't clean it out and then the phone in the nightstand doesn't work. Why is it even there? Buy worst of all, it was the mildew in the shower around the handles (got an ADA room for whatever reason and I don't  know why). Obviously it could be cleaned off because I simply wiped some of tje mildew off with paper.   Please see the picture. So basically housekeeping isn't taking the time to clean something so simple. What else is there that I can't see?Oh and then we tried to get a cup of tea and milk for my son and how about there is no room service after 11pm. This is not the Roosevelt Hotel I knew and loved. This is a dump now and I will never stay here again. I'm very very dissapointed. I wish I could get my money back and go somewhere else. Don't stay here, but if you do, make sure it's not room 1404!!!!Shame on management for not maintaining the valor the hotel use to have!  The location is the only thing appealing about this place. Don't believe those staged photos on the website. So fake!",2,,

47,Van P.,"Sterling, VA",1,23,40,2.0,12/3/2017,"I came here with my husband because this is where my company booked for our NYC trip. To start we thought the Roosevelt would be really nice since the outside had that old time feel to it. The inside though was outdated and the whole hotel looked like it was way past its prime. The lobby area was nice but very dark, very little lighting. The registration area was this long desk. The first registration desk lady we had was fairly nice however, the hotel messed up my last name...so we had to wait for her to figure it out to get the keys to our room. Once we got the keys, we waited for the elevator and let me tell you, those elevators are SO. SLOW. One of the elevators to the far left was a much older one and it felt rickety and unsafe. When we got to our room, it looked pretty basic. Old, nothing really to write home about except that it really needed renovating. The ceiling paint was cracked. Every time I sat on the toilet, it made this really loud sound and felt like it was going to break. The smell in the room was musky and old (I feel like I'm really over using this word but really, the place was old and super outdated). We had paid to store our bags before check in and for the hotel to bring to the room. It took them 3+ hours with several calls and we were repeatedly told that they were being delivered. Well, we went downstairs again and the bell hop guy directed us to where the bags were and lookie there, our bag was JUST being loaded to bring upstairs. What was most disturbing was that we walked up, found our bag and grabbed it and walked away and no one said a word. -__-When we checked out and stored our bag again, we were told the hotel would load it to the bus for us. They didn't. We were told to go grab our bags right before we boarded. Yippee, slow service and obviously incompetent staff. The only nice people were the cleaning maids. The rest were lazy and mediocre. If it wasn't a company trip and I had to stay there, we might've checked out and went somewhere else. One thing going for this place though is the location. It was right in the middle of everything and it was easy for us to get places without using a taxi or Uber.",2,2,1

And greeted us with .. so your the brown water people! Like he was annoyed. Then telling me this is an old hotel, which I understand already and we got it on discount and we should expect this kind of things to happen. He never once apologized , he just made excuses and he kept saying I was giving him the ""shake down"" and if I thought I was. Getting a discount I was mistaken and we could move out! He said they'll move us but we already had rooms next to each other and our stuff was all in shambles because of work and shopping. Mind you, this was in the lobby In front of everybody at 11 pm at night! Im going to call my credit card company and disputed this.

Bellhop guys and registration ladies weren't very helpful. We had problems with our bags, much like other reviews, and waited forever for the elevators to arrive. I probably aged as much as this hotel has just waiting for my ride to my floor. Our hotel room was small with two beds. Good thing there was only two of us or this place might've felt really cramped.

I would've gave a 5-Star rating but something rubbed me the wrong way.When we checked in 2 days ago, the receptionist asked if we plan on using amenities such as the gym, which would be an additional charge under what they call a ""Facilities Fee"" and we said no.Today, when we checked out, we were told that we have to pay a Facilities Fee. I asked why since we declined days ago, and we were told that if you book through 3rd parties like Expedia, we will have to pay the fee. I told her we booked through Groupon and she said all 3rd party bookings will have to pay.I then told her that we were 'asked' if we want to pay it when we arrived and we firmly said no. She acted like she has no say so on the charge. She couldn't even answer why an employee would give us the option to pay this fee, if it is 'mandatory' through 3rd parties.Even weirder, my gf asked if we booked directly through the hotel, do we have to pay this fee and she replied yes. Fishy right? First you say it is mandatory through 3rd party bookings only, the. Your story switches up? Ok.

The location is great for shopping and dining, and it is just a short walk from major tourist spots like Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave and the Empire State Building. Rooms are clean and well maintained, and despite the age don't smell old or musty. The only downside is that the elevators can get packed at peak times.

Eventually, I get my room key and head upstairs and my room door is cracked open! I head downstairs because I don't feel safe going into an open room as it is after 1am and I am alone. I noticed the woman who was in front of me is also there again saying he gave her the key to someone else's room because the top latch was locked and she couldn't get in. I tell the front desk guy my dilemma and he brushes my complaint off and says ""oh, it's probably just housekeeping. You can go in."" I ask if I can switch rooms because I'm not comfortable going into an open room for security reasons and he says there are no available rooms and he'll just send security with me. Security escorts me in and the window is wide open and it smells funny in there and there was this odor reducing machine on the table trying to air it out. Why would they think it's ok to put a guest in a room with an awful odor???Room #2: Next, they give me a DOWNGRADE to two double beds, and this room smells even worse than the other but is filled with air freshener in an attempt to mask the smell, but the security guard and I can barely breathe!

Definitely way better then expected! Not too sure why everyone else had a horrible experience...Pros: service was easy and polite. Check in was quick and we were given two free drinks coupons  at their bar which we definitely used along with late check out. The bar was fun and energetic. The room was clean, very large (king superior) and bed was cozy. It wasn't loud nor really hard to sleep in at all. The hotel is centrally located to shopping and restaurants. Hotel overall was beautiful and elegant, nothing too fancy but still elevated. Cons: the elevator was a bit inconsistent but wasn't horrible- they had signs posted everywhere informing customers that it was in transition for being upgraded.Yes- the elevator was crazy, the hotel is very busy and it's a little bit more dated but charming. But after staying in two other hotels (Hayden Hotel and Paramount) this was a palace for what you can get in the NYC for such a approachable price. Lots of what people are complaining about the hotel are complainers and don't really have anything to do with the actual experience or room. I would recommend staying here and would stay here again.

On top of all of that there was Hair left stuck to the shower walls. I'd had enough!I called down to guest services and asked for a manager, explained that I was not at all happy with this being my first time visiting, paying $700 for this! Manager immediately upgraded my room to a deluxe double bed room.Coming into the new room a little bit happier I now take a shower and I repeat SHOWER!! The tub starts filling up, the water was not draining, and things started coming out the drain, after I finished showering it took 30 minuets for the water to drain.At this point I am not at all happy with my stay here so far, and yes I will definitely be speaking to higher management, because I think it's a bit ridiculous to be charged $700 plus a $97 fee for amenities and not have your room be in top shape.

When I am in NYC spending my own money - not expense account money - I want a decent place to sleep that is clean and safe and a place to enjoy a cocktail before bed and a location where I can walk to Broadway plays or my favorite jazz club. It is old. The rooms are small. You will not run into Paris Hilton in the hallway. It is NY and people can be rude. But at this price in midtown Manhattan what are the alternatives? If the people giving this place ""one star"" can suggest a nearby alternative at the same price with big rooms and elegant service and marvelous views out the windows, I would be interested to hear about it. There are some better hotels nearby, but I would rather spend $165 a night at the Roosevelt than $500 a night at the high end alternatives.",1,,

66,S M.,"East Point, GA",20,23,0,5.0,11/19/2017,"I had a week long work conference here the week of Nov 12 and than stayed the weekend after to be a tourist. These room were by far the largest Ive had in any NYC hotel. The staff was friendly, personable, and did their jobs well. The cleaning staff work surprisingly quickly and effeciently. My room was clean and tidy every day. The building exudes the character and history of its many years. I found all the amenities and services available during the conference to be first class. I highly, highly recommend this hotel.",,,
67,Vikrant B.,"Carrollton, TX",36,5,5,1.0,12/22/2017,"The worst hotel to stay at in New York. When we stayed the elevator did not work, they had no room service, room is big as my closet. There are many other better options to look at next time.",,,
68,Kierra S.,"Gainesville, FL",1,18,0,3.0,1/15/2018,"I'll start by saying The Roosevelt is very fortunate to have its name because that's what is carrying this place. We booked a week long stay for NYE in August when things were starting to fill up. We chose the hotel based on the value for the location and after reading the reviews I kind of knew what to expect. Considering how little time we were actually in the hotel most of the issues were not a huge bother to us. Here were the big things : The elevators! For the most part the waits were bearable. However there were a few days when the hotel started filling up that elevator wait times were exceeding 30 minutes and when one finally arrived it would usually be full. Which means on a few occasions we trekked 15 flights. It was not awful for 26 year old me but I really feel for people traveling with children and elderly. Rooms: they're basically falling apart. Wallpaper peeling, could use some updates, furniture chipped, bathrooms could use some new grout and paint. However, the size of the room was incredible. Super spacious room and bathroomAnd the closet was pretty big(but also in awful shape). Staff: hit or miss. The cleaning staff we encountered were all great to us as well as room service. Everyone was kind and always offering to help or see what we might need. The front desk is up in the air. You either get superb service or downright rude. If you're staying for a while be sure to check out the bar next door, Vander. Don't waste your time in the overpriced bar in the lobby. The atmosphere, prices, drinks, and service in much better just a few steps away. The location is great and I really liked the holiday decor, it gave the hotel a welcoming feel. It's a quick walk to most tourist attractions and once you figure out the subway it's really a breeze to get around. Overall, the bad things were what I expected from previous reviews and the good things made it worthwhile. I'd probably stay here again during a less busy time of the year.",,,
69,Teja P.,"Philadelphia, PA",269,1,0,1.0,9/17/2017,Extremely overpriced for the quality of service and experience you receive. Have to pay a mandatory $30 extra dollars for wifi (only 3 devices) and few other pointless amenities. Bathroom was rusty and dirty. There was nothing to see from the window. A/C seemed to have been manufactured 30 years ago. Would certainly not recommend this hotel.,2,,
70,Cory C.,"New York, NY",5,1,0,1.0,2/18/2018,Ive never written a review before but this has to be said. DO NOT stay here. The managers and staff are absolutely disgusting people that have no manners or courtesy. Check in was at 3 - we arrived at 5 and waited 2 more hours for our room to be ready. Only to be kicked out immediately with no warning for playing music. Our luggage was taken and thrown down the hall as the security and manager yelled all sorts of insults at us. I'm pretty sure that is not allowed. We are now pressing charges for how our youngest was handled by security. Stay here at your own risk.,3,,
71,Emily G.,"Folsom, LA",0,26,0,2.0,3/5/2018,"Upon arrival, I really had high hopes. The Roosevelt presents itself well and has a gorgeous lobby, restaurant, and seating area once you walk in. But after check in & receiving our room, everything went down hill from there. I have many complaints about this hotel. While I can understand that this is an older, more traditional hotel- it is necessary to maintain upgrades for your guests. With just a few simple observations, I noticed peeling wallpaper, stained bed sheets and towels, and a window that wouldn't stay opened. Also can't forget that this hotel has 6 elevators, but only 2-4 of them work at one single time.. leaving you waiting for the elevator for easily 15-20 minutes at a time. I stayed on the 15th floor and I probably could have taken the stairs in the amount of time it took for the elevator to come. Another huge problem presented itself right after our first night. We placed the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door (where you would assume to place it) thinking that we'd get just that.. no service, no maids in our room. We were wrong. We came back from a full day to notice that our stuff was moved around and the maid service had obviously let them selves in. This happened every single day we were there, with the last day being the most uncomfortable. Even with the do not disturb sign being placed on our door, the maid service let them selves in but this time we noticed that my dirty clothes from the bathroom were picked up and thrown onto a chair full of clean clothes, my toothbrush was touched and put head down in a cup next to a friends used razor. I was honestly appalled and super uncomfortable to still be staying in this hotel. We attempted to call the front desk/housekeeping multiple times but never received an answer. Leaving us no choice but to walk down to complain face to face. We left our complaint with the front desk, who promised to handle our situation, stayed our last night and left with relief the next morning. While we booked this hotel blindly due to the affordable pricing I found online and the perfect central location, I can honestly say that I will never, ever stay in this hotel again and I will not recommend this location to anyone.",2,,
72,Angel Amara P.,"Bronx, New York, NY",37,30,3,4.0,5/11/2018,"So I wasn't one of the hotel guests ... I went to the bar located on the main level of this hotel. We were amazed that they were able to make a blue margarita; if you go out often then you know why that's so astonishing. I had a quesadilla which was amazing and wings which were soooooooo displeasing which is why they didn't get a five star review. Our server was ""David"" and he was amazing. He was observant enough to our needs and answered all of the questions we had about the photos hanging on the walls, the drinks and liquors and even the meals. I will be returning for the drinks and even maybe the quesadillas but not the wings.",,,
73,Crissy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,70,0,4.0,11/15/2017,"Not a bad stay.I saw all the bad reviews, so I was really worried headed for my NYC trip, as we were booked at the Roosevelt.Maybe it was just my lucky day. The elevators weren't as slow as some have said (at least, not on the day I was there). The room, although older, wasn't as gross as others have said. Again, maybe I lucked out with a decent room. I was just glad it wasn't like the Hotel Pennsylvania near MSG, because that place was a dump.We had breakfast at the hotel, and they had some very good quiche. I love quiche. I'm a big fan of great quiche. So the fact they had quiche for breakfast was a big plus for me.The wifi was slow, unfortunately. But overall, my personal experience wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.",,,
74,R C.,"Charlotte, NC",0,6,4,2.0,8/22/2018,Perfect location for our trip. Room was clean but furniture and room finish was well worn. No in-room coffee set up. Shower reached tepid temp at best. Good AC.,,,

76,Victoria R.,"Portland, OR",387,22,8,1.0,2/15/2018,Run. Just run away to the nearest even motel would probably have better service/more amenities than this place for the price. And no WiFi. Smallest room I've ever been in (literally hit my elbows on things constantly and I'm only 5'2). They wouldn't even bring a wheel chair for my sick mother. Piece of WORK this place is.,2,,

78,Kaelah T.,"Melbourne, FL",167,5,0,1.0,7/9/2017,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. I stayed here for a few days & every day I witnessed someone being even more rude to customers. The manager DENNIS is a complete prick & has the biggest attitude towards everybody.I did a cash deposit one night on a Saturday due to my card being stolen, which was very nice. Come Sunday, I went downstairs to recheck in & he would not allow me to do it again knowing that the bank isn't open on a Sunday & I could easily do a card deposit on Monday when I received a temporary card at the bank. He was in NO way helpful.Then on top of it, every time someone walked away from the front desk, the woman were always talking bad about the customers.The elevators take forever, they do not work.The rooms aren't very clean either. Most importantly I just have never stayed ANYWHERE in NY with terrible customer service. The Wellington hotel has better customer service than them & that's a low blow.",6,,

82,Alice C.,"Austin, TX",3,9,3,3.0,8/14/2017,"Our flight got in early in the morning, but our check-in time wasn't until 3pm. Thankfully, the hotel offered accommodations to leave your luggage so you can spend the day exploring the city without worrying about your stuff. The bellhops were very friendly (and they work for tips). When we got back to check-in, we ran into a bit of trouble since the room we were given was still occupied! The staff fixed the problem immediately and got us an empty room on the 18th floor. Unfortunately, two of the elevators on that floor were out of order at the time that we stayed there, and the elevators are already quite busy and crowded in the mornings. If you get out before 8am, it shouldn't take too long to get down, but we left at 8:45am one morning and it took about a 15 minute wait for the elevator (we had to skip the one that opened since it was full and wait for another one). It's understandable since the hotel is large and has many guests, just keep in mind that if you're staying on one of the lower floors, it's a good idea to just take the stairs.The room itself was clean. The outlets in the lamps didn't work very well (we plugged our phones in to charge and it does charge, but extremely slowly - think, 1% every ten minutes). It's better to just use the outlets in the wall. The bathroom was clean and there were plenty of towels and cups. You can control the temperature of the room too. It wasn't exactly the most spacious, but for New York standards it was a good size for 4 people. At one point, we called the front desk (they stop answering calls at 11pm so keep this in mind) to get some shower caps. Half an hour later, they still hadn't brought them up, so we went down to get them ourselves. Another half an hour later, someone showed up to bring us shower caps, but when we opened them, he had brought us cotton buds instead!The location is great! You're right in the middle of Midtown so it's easy to get around. It's also a block away from access to Grand Central Station (you have to walk a bit underground to get to the recognizable part). Although it wasn't exactly an exceptional hotel experience, it was conveniently located, clean, and we didn't have to worry about our stuff.",1,,
83,Mishari A.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,306,94,2.0,8/3/2017,"I'm posting pictures of our first room that they gave us with broken mirror, missing drawer under the TV, and some open cables. This place was recommended from my best friend and he told me it's old and I understand how old it is, but at least we're in 2017 Safety matters sometimes when it's a first time visit and a place still got the classic smell of 90's. I've been calling to fix the drawer for 3 days and they just too lazy to fix that so they gave us another room. OK the new room looks good but guess what the AC in the room has no switch ln the wall so I have to control the cooling temperature by opening the old school box placed next to it which I found it because I wasn't born in this century. Careful with the door when you leave the room some doors aren't closing well and this could be the last time you see your items if someone wants to steal them. Don't believe any pictures unless if it was posted from yelpers not the hotel it's perfect rooms just for the pictures not for you. One more thing that I didn't know at first that if you booked from Expedia you can do a late check out or upgrade the room which is the only great thing here. They don't offer free umbrella if it's raining outside like other hotels, and they don't have private airport shuttle they only call a company to pickup you up or you have to get your stuff to other locations to go to the airport. You would pay a lot for tipping the luggage men and doorman so keep the cash with you. Last advice get your final bill before you leave.",1,,
84,Justin A.,"Sugar Land, TX",217,59,323,2.0,6/14/2016,"This place looks great on the outside and in the lobby.... But it stops there. The second you leave the lobby you will be able to tell. Everyday during 7-10am and 4-8 pm the elevators are soooo crowded. The programming algorithms for the elevators are terrible. Each cart wants to be the most efficient cart and pick up everyone from the top floor and down. So living at one of the earlier floors, you may have to wait for 3 or 4 elevators to get down. It is so dumb. And when you have luggage.... It's even worse. I opted out and carried my 40 pound luggage from the 5th floor down the stairs.The rooms were okay. Not spectacular. It was neat and rustic but you can tell that it's old. The air conditioning unit itself is like an air horn then you have the New York cars honking non stop and the jackhammer construction on all night. The bathroom is so small; it's like being on a cruise. The tiles feel old and dirty and while showering, you can barely turn and cannot extend your arms at all. I'm only 5'7"" so anyone taller will be even more cramped.",,,

He sent us to two places that were closed?  We did not appreciate the walk and then the fact they were closed for the day (one until dinner).  We first asked how the hotel lounge was.  He said they served food.  I asked if it was decent.  He said, ""I am not sure, but I have never heard someone complain.""  Not a great answer if you are trying to get people to stay at the hotel and eat.  For the recommendations, maybe he should introduce himself to google and Yelp.  They list hours of restaurants and save guests from going on a goose chase for a meal.",,,

Behind the times with amenities, poor customer service, and huge lines for bellman and usage of elevators were the downfalls.

If you have a do not disturb sign on your front door, the cleaning service will still wake you at 8:30 in the morning to see when you are checking out (at least they did a with me). Not cool. Ugh, I hate giving low ratings but honestly, the only endearing thing about this place is the location. That's it.

Receptionist left me at the front desk while she went up the stairs for at least 10 minutes. After her return she told me that they were sold out and housekeeping is cleaning up my room. Oh wait a minute.... I had reservation that I had booked days ago and now the hotel is sold out and now housekeeping is cleaning up my room??? Ok something doesn't make sense.

The elevators took FOREVER and when you're staying on the 15th floor, the stairs aren't really an option, especially if you have things you're carrying. There was no information in the rooms about the restaurants even within the hotel let alone outside in the area, so it was difficult to figure out.

I can't speak for everyone else here, but my stay at The Roosevelt had me sleeping like a baby. My room was quite spacious, it had a flat screen TV, though no coffee maker and the internet was not free, and the bathroom could be a little bigger, and the air conditioner could be a little easier to adjust, but overall, it really wasn't that bad.  My check-in was easy, the doormen were friendly, and location I believe... is the best!!  They are located where you can walk to fantastic places to eat, or simply catch a quick ride to wherever your hearts desire!!Perhaps, The Roosevelt Hotel might at some point, decide to do a make over.

103,Danielle L.,"Houston, TX",43,130,62,2.0,9/4/2016,"I knew prior when I chose this hotel that it was a really old and had a lot of history. However, The Roosevelt takes the meaning of ""Historical"" to a whole new level. Do not let the pictures online of this hotel fool you, because you find it very glorious, old money New York. No, it is far from it. When you first walk in, there is a lot of marble, oriental style carpeting, and gold accents. The lighting is very dim in certain areas especially the lobby. The elevators are located directly across from the lobby's check in counter, which are very slow.   Upon checking in, the service from the staff was good, not exceptional, but good. I grabbed my keys and went up to the 9th floor to my room. When I stepped off the elevator I was hit in the face with a terrible smell of mildew. The room doors are old, wooden, and heavy, so when they closed, they slammed loudly against the door frame. Not something I would want to be woken up by in the middle of the night. Well that happened a lot. The room was the other problem, chips in the wall that appeared to have been painted over and over again so the chips looked like craters on the moon. Wallpaper bubbling and peeling, old carpet, furniture left unmaintained, and outdated power outlets. At least the linens seemed well washed and smelt fresh. I feel that if they were not, I would have checked out immediately and stayed somewhere else. At one point during my stay I was using the desk and sitting in the desk chair. However, I kept feeling this itchy feeling under my left thigh. So I reached under to scratch it and cut my cuticle and top of finger. While saying a few choice words, I got up and took a closer look to see what just cut me and found that it was a nail sticking up through the cushion of the desk chair seat. Luckily, I had no infection from the cut, but it hurt for a few days as any cuticle cut would. The bathroom looked almost like it could have passed for being condemned. The tub had rust and paint peeling in it. You had to stand in your own dirty shower water because it would drain. The toilet made you cringe every time you flushed it, because it filled up slowing with swirling water like it was going to overflow. Not exactly the kind of feeling you want to happen to you on a midnight trip to tinkle. I do not recommend this hotel at all. The only thing I feel it has going for it is the location. It is so close to a lot of different sights and great NYC landmarks.",9,,3

108,Roy G.,"Oxnard, CA",1,16,4,1.0,12/27/2017,"All of the two star reviews here are on point. Beautiful building outside, old and tired inside.  Here are the ""highlights"" of my family's stay:1. Concierge couldn't answer our simple question of which direction was a restaurant we wanted to check out because she was closing her desk up and late for her train. In fact, she didn't even look up at us while she was locking her desk drawer. Really?...10 seconds to point thataways was a bother?2.  Room was dated. Electrical outlets were loose (if they even worked) and our phone chargers kept falling out of the plugs. The one that actually worked was behind a 200 lb dresser so we could barely reach it. 3.  Toilet was not secured to the floor tightly and every time you sat or stood up the tank lid rattled against the wall. I'm shocked that the seal of the toilet wax ring hasn't broken and caused leakage with that much movement over time. The shower head stem was protruding from the wall about 3""...how does THAT even happen? Wallpaper and trim moldings were old and in need  of repair. 4.  No one explained about the $35 ""Facilities Fee""....PER day...whatever the heck that was. 5.  Maids were not too accommodating and basically asked us what we thought we needed inside.  I assumed they were going to go in and clean the place?..we saw the same small stain on a pillow case throughout our four day stay. 6.  The window seal was so bad that we could hear everything going on 10 stories down as well as letting in the 21 degree weather inside the room. It literally sounded as if they were open a crack. 7.  ....and yes...those damn elevators! Six, small useless boxes that took forever and a day to arrive, and when they did, the doors opened up to reveal 6-7 compressed sardines staring out at you like they were thinking ""Don't even think about coming in here!""  On average we waited 15 minutes per trip. I saw many people just head for the stairs. What does that say about the service when you're 10 flights up and even the elderly are pushing those Stairs doors open? The interiors of the elevators were dated. One of them had the plywood ceiling peeking out under chipping paint. 8.  No employees at the front entrance to either help you with luggage, or to help you hail a cab. 9.  One bright spot in this old mess: the waiter at the Madison Bar in the lobby: Jose. Attentive, on time, took care of us. Great employee.  But, the other waiter?..slow, lazy, forever to reappear. Shucks. Will not be staying here again. My $275 +fees goes way further at a Courtyard Marriott or W, and you ALWAYS know what you're getting.",,1,

110,Mariam J.,"Manhattan, NY",5,17,1,1.0,12/25/2017,"If I could give this hotel zero stars, I would. This is by far the worst hotel I've stayed in, in NYC. The hotel is managed by Interstate Hotels and Resorts and from my research shows Chris Hosmer as the general manager. Good luck trying to find a place to complain or someone to complain to that actually cares within the Roosevelt Hotel or Interstate Hotel and Resorts. It seems almost intentional the poor quality and trashy rooms and the rude management. The rooms are old and musty. The ac/heat barely works. The elevators give you anxiety. The management team could care less about their jobs or guests. There is absolutely no oversight. Beware if you can get the room for about a hundred a night, may be worth it for the location, but if you're looking for a nice comfortable hotel, this is not the place. Highly discourage anyone from staying here.",,,1

113,Neal A.,"North Attleborough, MA",51,8,0,2.0,12/7/2017,Very disappointed in this place. First was that the elevators didn't seem to be working every morning. Was on the sixth floor and walked down every am for coffee because only two of six elevators were working and they were always full. Waited 15 mins and finally just walked down. The first nite we were there they had a great selection of draft beers at the bar. The next 3 nites they had nothing! Apparently the drafts have not worked right since July. The bartenders are as frustrated as the guests. With the amount of money they charge to stay here you would think they would fix that! Spoke to the night manager at the bar and he said too bad. Wish I had gotten his name! So had to settle for warm bottled beer as they were selling it so fast it couldn't get cold! This place is relying on its location and reputation to get people to stay here. Gets two stars because of the employees!!,1,,

It's just a few blocks from Grand Central and is within walking distance to Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. The bathroom is small and it takes a while to get an elevator. The hotel only has room service for breakfast even though the room has menus for all day dinning. The bar doesn't do take away either. The room service tray left outside the room across the hall was there for over 12 hours.,,,
116,Mare L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,0,2.0,10/17/2017,"There are many reasons to forgo this past-its-prime hotel - from the outdated furniture and tuned-out staff members, to the fact that the place has no security or even a doorman to hail cabs or hold the door for you. (If the hotel does employ a doorman, we didn't ever see him/her during our three-day stay, and we were in and out a lot.) But in case you were thinking of giving this hotel a whirl, here's what our stay was like.My husband, who had already checked into the hotel before my two children and I arrived and was working at a conference nearby, had left his spare room key for us at the front desk. But when the kids and I arrived, we asked the woman at the front desk - who was not assisting anyone at the time - for the key, she pointed to the long line of folks waiting to check in and said we had to wait just like everyone else - basically, repeat the process my husband had just endured a couple hours earlier. After waiting in the long line, we were finally granted access to approach the woman, who merely opened the drawer in front of her and handed me the key. Why she could not have done that earlier, without making us wait in line while several other people went through the entire check-in process, was beyond me. On night one of a two-night stay, my 11-year-old son went to the bathroom and flushed the toilet. Thanks to outdated plumbing, the room was quickly flooded with toilet water. So we called housekeeping and said we had an emergency and to please send someone up. Fifteen minutes later, the only person that had showed up at our door was the guest beneath us who said water was now dripping into his room through the ceiling. We apologized profusely and called downstairs again - Where are you guys?!?! Someone eventually showed up, but by that time my husband had already opened the toilet himself and stopped the water from gushing out. The staff member took a look and said housekeeping would be back to clean up the room. Fifteeen minutes later, still no one was at our door. Did I mention that it was almost 11 o'clock at night and we were exhausted? So we made another phone call. Eventually someone showed up to supposedly clean the bathroom, but after five minutes in the bathroom walked out without saying goodbye and leaving the door to our hotel room propped open. Another twenty minutes later, he still hadn't reappeared. So we called housekeeping yet again. Why is the floor still wet? Why didn't anyone bring towels? They said someone was coming up shortly but - you are beginning to see a pattern here - it took another 15 minutes for someone to return with towels. And they never did get the floor dry. Coming back from the dinner the next evening, my husband and I wanted to inquire about a restaurant reservation. So we stood in front of the Concierge desk, where the concierge was chatting with another staffer. My husband I literally stood in front of both gentlemen for a good two minutes and neither of them - I repeat neither of them - turned around to glance at us, never mind end their conversation or attempt to acknowledge us. So my husband said, ""I guess you guys don't want to help us!"" and we walked away. They looked at us briefly and then went on chatting.A few mintues later, after we had returned to our room, I wanted to use the gym. But the problem is, there was no directory in the room. So I called the concierge. Not that I expected anyone to answer - what with the two men at the concierge desk having more important things to discuss down there. And guess what? No one answered. So I pressed another button on my phone labeled ""Guest Response"" and - surprise -- no one answered that call either. So I tried the concierge again and miracle of all miracles, someone answered this time. ""Yes, hello, do you guys have a fitness center?"" I asked, in the sweetest voice I could muster. The guy on the other line answered, ""Second floor,"" and then hung up on me before I could finish uttering the words, ""thank you."" Apparently, some people who work here need a few lessons at charm school.Bottom line, we will not be returning to the Roosevelt. There are much better, hipper, friendlier hotels in town and we will be checking in there.",2,,1

127,Stephanie D.,"New York, NY",830,341,44,3.0,6/5/2016,"A very historic hotel in an EXCELLENT location. However, for a 4 star hotel it could use some sprucing up. The amenities are old and the bathroom is really really old. We're talking grout and old showers with the lowest water pressure I've ever experienced at any hotel. However, the concierge is extremely helpful and arranged airport transportation services for our family of four to LaGuardia airport for only a $45 flat rate and was very prompt even at 5:15 am. The location is perfect--right in the middle of Midtown Manhattan. You're a short walk away from Times Square, Rockefeller center, Broadway, Central Park, one block away from fifth avenue and grand central station. Whatever you want, you're in the middle of Manhattan so more likely than not you're near most of where you want to go. Many places are walkable from this hotel. It's Manhattan so it's going to be loud. Our first night there was drilling all night and the AC is really loud when it turns on. The elevators going up are extremely slow to arrive at lobby but going down is a quick ride somehow. The maids are really friendly and nice though and do a great job of cleaning.

However, we would hit 6-7 floors at least each time we went down and the elevator was jammed packed by the time we hit the lobby. Every single time.  There were numerous people on the middle floors that had to wait through multiple elevators to get down.  Overall, the location was really good but until they upgrade the rooms a bit and improve their service, I'll be looking elsewhere.",2,,

The pictures of the rooms were deceiving, our room looked nothing like them (I wish I took pictures), it was old and out dated, and was small with paper thin walls, you could hear everything going on outside and in the hallway ... maybe I'm used to staying in a Wyndham time share, since I'm an owner, we split our visit with the two, we didn't have enough points, so that's why we had to stay at the 2 different places.

It's also the favorite hotel of the ever so popular Marilyn Monroe. It's just a small list of the history that is Roosevelt Hotel. It's as old as the city itself, you can even seem it as a historical building as it stands right at the heart of downtown Manhattan. Just like any other hotels, it has elevators that take you to your floor where your room is located. There are rooms where it has a bed or two. It has a bathroom where you can shower, brush your teeth,,, do the number one and number two. There's a flat screen on the wall if you fancy to watch some programming. It even comes with a window! Wow!!! What more do you want?Yes it's an older hotel, it might not have a new things that most modern hotels carry. Like space,, that's probably one of the things a lot of people write about here on yelp. Then there's me who will remind people once again that you're not in Kansas anymore Toto. You're in NYC, where space is at a premium. My bed was clean, my bathroom was clean and my toilet flushed. Check, check, and CHECK!

Go out and experience what NYC has to offer,, by then end of your holiday, I guarantee you wouldn't have even begun to scratch the surface of that there is to see and do here in New York. Let me give you a hint, Time Square is only a few blocks away. The most stunning lobby in the world is here as well. Perfect place to meet up, have a spot of tea and link up with friends and family.

138,Bern A.,"Corpus Christi, TX",76,6,8,1.0,11/26/2017,"The hotel is close to grand central and other attractions. That's why i give it a star for location. But honestly, $230 a night is ridiculous. The elevators feel like they will drop you any moment. My room is dingy and smells like a really really old closet. you can see that they try to do spot repairs on the ceilings, floors and in the bath but the truth the room needs to be ovearhauled. But its an old hotel so i guess its acceptable. But one thing that ticked me is that my friends reservation includes breakfast but mine doesnt. I told the receptionist at the breakfast area that i DO NOT have a breakfast voucher. So when we got to the table, the waiter poured me a cup of coffee and again i said I'm not gonna eat breakfast. And he did'nt say anything. After that, the receptionist went to make sure i didn't get a plate and he told all three waiters which was very audible ""she doesn't have a voucher, dont give her anything"". After that one of the waiters approached me and said "" mam you're not gonna eat?""

141,Elizabeth K.,"Commack, NY",153,9,1,1.0,2/19/2018,"Fun girls night that turned south. Our experience was terrible from the start. Check in time is listed at 3pm and when we arrived around 5:30pm our room was not ready. We were given drink vouchers for the inconvenience and told that it would be a 40 minute wait. 40 minutes passed and we reported back to the front desk only to be told that it would ANOTHER 40 minutes. It wasn't until 7pm that our room was finally ready. The front desk manager, Tyera, delivered our room keys to us and said we would receive a significantly discounted rate. Upon arriving at the room there were two bags of dirty linens and trash outside of our door. Later in the night around 9:30pm, security arrived at our door regarding a noise complaint. This wasn't surprising because the walls seemed paper thin. This was the first and only warning that we received. Upon talking with security and ensuring that we were on our way out for the night, the room holder entered the room to inform guests to quiet down only to hear the security guard instantly yell down the hallway that it was the last straw and we needed to leave. Security and management took it upon themselves to enter our room and throw our personal belongings into the hallway even though we all complied and began to pack. Personal insults began flying, including the same manager (Tyera) saying ""I wish i wasn't a manager so I can say and do what i want to do to you"" as well as calling each of us ugly.  Both security and management acted in a way that was childish and completely unprofessional. The situation escalated to the point where one of our guests was physically pushed by security which was completely unprovoked and police became involved. We are currently pursuing charges because of the events that occurred.",2,,

They are located in Midtown Manhattan within 2 blocks of Grand Central, 10 minutes walking time to Central Park, shopping, 15-20 min walk to Times Square, Empire State Building and more! Not only was the location great but the hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. We did have a chance to eat at the rooftop bar Mad 46 and the drinks were great pours and the food was super yummy!

And contacted the GM about this.I just checked the Travelocity website and my receipt. On my receipt, I am told that upon check in, I would be charged $14.95 for in room wifi. Why is this? Why don't you allow your guests to choose if they want WIFI or not? Instead of taking the initiative and charging them? Also, why isn't this listed as I book (and it doesn't because I just checked)? It is only listed AFTER I book a room at your hotel.When I checked in, you offer free coffee as an incentive for throwing the additional charge in there. Have you thought about those guests who do not drink coffee? My guest and I discarded both tickets. So basically we paid an additional $32.66 for a service we did not want or need to receive coffee that we did not drink because NOT EVERYONE drinks coffee.Also, I heard that guests can request coffee machines in their rooms. So this, I feel, is just another way for you all to collect additional money from guests if we want to check in. I am not happy about it and I will be reporting your scam.You've lost my business going further.Finally, when I was at check in and asked for a manager, why did no one know who the manager was? The lady had to speak with the front desk manager (who I said I wanted a REAL manager). That's embarassing.I sent a message to the GM. He responded two days later. His resolution - he would offer me a better room (should there be one available) at a discounted rate. I just provided you with bullet points of every issue that I had AND you know that I traveled four hours to arrive here. Why would I take a ""discounted"" rate when your staff has zero clue of what they are doing? And your Yelp reviews have 2 stars. I will go with somewhere else.",,1,

This Hotel has gone toThe dogs and I don't mean well kept dogs either.  I can't begin to tell you the garbage this hotel offers. First off, I'm not a first time guest who had a bad experience. I've stayed here several times over the years so I've witnessed the demise.  The main rug in the Lobby is held together with duct tape and this is not a joke.  Half the elevators buttons don't work and my room looks like a scar face movie from the 80s. My lamp shade is broken, hair in the tub (not mine by the way), the electrical outlets don't work and they have about 8 fire detectors on the wall! I guess they decided to update to meet code but failedTo remove the old ones. All restaurants close At 11:30pm including roomService. So, getting a snack for my 4 year old was a mission. The staff and bellhops act as if there starving for a meal and the waiters in the lobby are unhappy with their jobs but they've been with the hotel for 20 years.  I'm not comparing this hotel toThe Plaza but even the Marriott down the street has a better environment. Also, it's a very large hotel with hundreds of rooms so the lobby feelsLike grand central. I'm writing this review from the lobby bar and watching the twoBartenders attend to the same 2 female guest in attempts to get lucky. The sad part is, the bar is full with paying guest who can't get any service. The bartenders shouldKnow these ladies are working girls and they just want money not their time.

This hotel has three $ signs, that means it is not a cheap hotel, actually pretty high-cost. BUT, their overall service is worse than Motel 6. I understand how tough updating the facilities is. But for service, come on!! They can do much better than this. I am 200% sure that this hotel's managers or supervisors have never seen yelp reviews nor tripadvisors' ever.1. Be aware of staffs. I tried to check-in at 3pm, but they said the room wasn't ready because our room was one bedroom suite. Ok, I get it. I came back 1hr later, still not ready. Came back 2hr later, not ready. Finally the room was ready after 3 hours. We finally checked-in at 6pm. When I complained, the very rude staff was trying to make us to understand that No Hotel can get their rooms ready by 3pm. And she said we don't understand the industry. Well. Sorry, I thought they should make their rooms ready for customers who got on time at least. The rooms which are not ready can get done later for people who check in late.2. Carry enough $1 bills and $5 bills in your pocket.  While I  was waiting for few hours because the room wasn't ready, I had to store my luggages in their facility. When I was handing my bags to them, they asked me for tips, which I completely understand, and I was going to tip them regardless. I tipped him $5 for 3 carry-on suitcases. After 2 hours, when I was trying to get my bags back, the same staff was starring at my hands for 3 seconds. (I was going to tip him $2 anyway, cuz I tipped him $5 earlier.) But I guess he couldn't wait for 5 seconds. He finally said to me ""I work for tips"". No ""Excuse me"", No ""Please"". It was just ""I WORK FOR TIPS!!"". He made $5 + $5 within 10 seconds. I know NY, I come to NY for work 2 times a year. But I have never experienced this kind of rude service and rude hotel staffs ever. I came to the States in 1995, and been traveling quite a bit, but this hotel is the WORST.3. Room: Carpet,,,,is the worst. Moist everywhere. Bathroom is super outdated. And the room stinks all the time.4. Rooftop Bar: Funky business hours. They open from Mon to Thur? or something. They never open on weekends. If this is their biz hours, they shouldn't really post it as their ""it spot"" on their website.5. Elevators: They pretend all 5 elevators are working good, but not true. I stayed for 4 days. Only 2 out of 5 were working, and they took FOREVER. Think about the size of the hotel, and only 2 elevators....Good luck.6.

164,M B.,"Taylor, MI",0,21,9,4.0,1/30/2016,"Stayed during my last trip to NYC. I needed an early check-in so I called the hotel to see if that was available.  The nice lady who answered the phone said that she would try but she couldn't guarantee because check-out wasn't until Noon (i was calling at 10:30 am) and check-in wasn't until 3pm.  I decided to go over to the hotel anyway - maybe I could drop my luggage and sight see until check-in.  Arriving by Uber, I was greeted by the doorman who opened my car door and welcomed me to the Roosevelt, taking my bags and walking me inside the hotel.  The hotel lobby is stunning - looks like something out of a classic movie. I walked up to the front desk and gave her my name.  After checking her computer, she smiled, gave me my room key card and said enjoy your stay Ms. (last name).  Needless to say I was excited at not having to wait until 3pm to check in!!  The room I reserved for 4 nights was a King room and it was a LOT larger than a lot of the other hotel rooms I've stayed in while in NYC.  I had heard from other people staying at the hotel that their rooms were really small.  I was very pleased with my room.  The view wasn't much:  one window looked out to an office building (so I kept the drapes drawn on that one so not to give the workers a free show! And the other one looked out over another building's roof top.  But I wasn't really interested in the view. I could go out into the city for that!  Grand Central Station is right down the street! The bathroom was a decent size with a shower and tub combo (a rarity in NYC hotels!). Water pressure in the shower was a little low but nothing that made it frustrating to take a shower.  I never tried the hotel restaurant although I did order room service my last night there:  fish & chips with salted caramel cake for dessert - a bit pricey ($45 not including tip) but it *is* NYC and everything is SO much more expensive. The food was good, came in a decent amount of time, was still hot when it arrived.  The waiter who served it was very nice and professional.  There were several places in the massive lobby where you could sit in overstuffed chairs and relax - I sat there for a while reading a book one night and it was very comfortable. I passed by the bar, didn't go in (I don't drink) but it seemed small, loud, noisy.  I went into the small store that they had off of the lobby - bought a bottle of water to break a $20 so I could tip my Uber driver.  The water was $4.50!  Wasn't impressed with that!  Needless to say I purchased any and all waters from the Duane Reade that was around the corner.All in all, it was an enjoyable stay, very comfortable.  The price was per day was VERY good considering it was NYC. Everyone at the hotel was professional & went out of their way to accommodate me.  Its out of the way from the touristy part of NYC (Times Square) but my Uber ride to Times Square was between $8-$10 so its easy to get to. I will definitely stay here again.",2,,

Upon check in I was told that I would have to wait until 3 for my room and they would call when it was ready. I never revived a phone call. The sheets on the bed were inside out which makes me question if they were ever washed, the motel I stayed at in the Philippines was nicer. The towels in the bathroom had mascara on them the trash had trash in it. After being in the shower for less than two minute the water turned ice cold. Seriously the worst place I've ever stayed. I had a leak in my suite case and while waiting for my room I asked the man in the gift shop for a plastic bag to put my busted face wash in, he wouldn't give me one or let me purchase one unless I bought something else. The man at the front door doesn't look you in the eyes or smile. Hospitality is the business of a hotel.

There's no denying that the location is great. Check in was irritating. It begins at 3 PM, we arrived at 5 PM and were told that our room still wasn't ready? I mean, it's a little ridiculous considering it's been hours since people checked out... so we were given a room with only one larger sized bed instead of two smaller sized beds. Whatever, we kind of just brushed it off we were only staying one night anyway. Our stay was fine, parking wasn't too expensive, and we all were comfortable. When it came time to check out, they tried charging my sister's credit card with some unknown, unexplainable fee. The concierge was SO rude to us, and I could tell it was because we're younger and viewed as irrelevant to their business. Well, after a long while of arguing with this woman who CLEARLY had no idea what she was talking about, the problem was resolved.

173,Angie G.,"Boston, MA",2,77,152,4.0,4/7/2018,"Stayed here for one night in NYC. Hotel had decent reviews online, and also a decent price. Over all I loved the hotel itself. It has an old feel and charm. Not too too far from Times Square. Check in was easy. Only 2 elevators were working because the rest are under construction. First things first, our room key cards didn't work right when we went to our room. Had to travel back and forth to get the keys fixed. Our room (2 double beds) was very out dated, and it smelled of wet clothes. The bathroom was also out dated, and the tub was kind of yucky. My friends and I did not mind because it was only one quick night. Staff throughout hotel was kind and helpful. Gift shop is beyond expensive. Check out was easy as well, but I got hit with a surprise valet charge. I understand if you have to pay for valet, but it wasn't advertised on Expedia or in my itinerary. They hold your bags for you even after check out, just tip the bell men. If you're looking for top luxury, maybe this isn't the place for you. I would stay at the Roosevelt again in the future.",,,
174,Monica E.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,5,1,1.0,8/28/2017,"Aside from the location don't waste your time staying at this place. The air condition was broken in our room and had to call twice to get it fixed. The front as well as their lack of management was slow and rude. The said ""hotel manager"" was snarky and condescending. Explain to me why only 2 of the 6 elevators were working, beyond me. Overpriced parking and it took 40 minutes to retrieve our car. Very unorganized and unpleasant experience. You might as well pitch a tent in the city you would have a more delightful experience.",,,
175,Kate S.,"Portland, OR",45,267,52,4.0,11/2/2015,"I'm pretty surprised by all the negative reviews because for the price and the location, this is a hell of a nice place. It's not the Ritz with all the fixings, but the building itself is beautiful, my friend and I had a nice clean room to stay in, and I guess we got lucky with the elevators because they moved along briskly. It is also right next to Grand Central which is perfect if you need a place to crash in the city after a late night and don't mind a Holly Golightly saunter back to your train.Our room was a corner unit with a great view among the midtown skyscrapers, a huge comfortable king size bed, and a large bathroom. I've stayed in brand new apartments in way worse condition than anything I saw here. The Roosevelt is basic, but comfortable and it's everything I needed. Whenever someone tells me they're traveling to New York, I always advise staying with friends and family to save money. But if you want a piece of history for a decent price, whether you're traveling by yourself or with friends, it's worth the Roosevelt.",3,,2
176,Thomas G.,"Manhattan, NY",258,3,0,1.0,11/10/2016,"Would strongly urge anyone considering staying at the Roosevelt Hotel to look elsewhere. Never in my life have I experienced such consistently poor service from a hotel. All the front desk and bar staff that I interacted with were rude and condescending, and put off the attitude that my presence was a bother to them. The room itself was dated, and clearly in poor condition. Paint and wallpaper are chipped and peeling, and both the kitchen faucet and shower head were broken. The quality of furnishings seems  akin to a best western and the room is poorly laid out with one small, dirty window overlooking the street. Finally, the elevators were consistently slow. I've stayed at hostels in the city that had cleaner, better-kept rooms and much friendlier service. AVOID THE ROOSEVELT AT ALL COST- I know I will next time I stay in New York.",3,,
177,Ernesto U.,"Mesa, AZ",3,14,0,4.0,8/17/2017,"Actually I enjoyed my stay here.  The room was nice and clean.  The beds would pretty comfy. I was able to watch my dodgers game on espn. I mean we didn't say in the room much. Why would I be in the hotel if I'm in NYC. Time square is 5 mins away. Only things I didn't like.   That daily service fee. 25 dollars for wifi I DIDNT USE. a gym I DIDNT USE. And something else.  And of course parking.  I've never paid that much for Parking.  Maybe cause this was my first time in NYC.  Also.  They didn't have a mini fridge.   So with a toddler and having to keep milk cold.  Well that sucked.   Atleast they offer a small bucket, to put ice in.  And that's how we kept the milk cold.  Also thanks to the guys outside my girlfriend dropped her phone in the sewer "" best part of the trip I must say"" but they helped her out and opened the sewer and got it out. Thanks to whoever that was. So would I say here again. Sure why not. IF I EVER GO BACK TO NEW YORK. ""If""",,,
178,jac j.,"Herndon, VA",3,118,80,2.0,7/25/2017,"The Roosevelt Hotel room was clean but no dresser, no coffee maker but they did have a safe and a hair dryer (essential tool).  The elevators were extremely slow.  One day we waited 20 minutes before the elevator came.  Also, believe it or not, the stairs were not easy to find.  Last thing is we were sitting in the bar one night around 10:00 pm for a late night snack and 3 young men were picking up another kid who had passed out.  They tried for 15 minutes to revive him and get him into a chair without success.  The hotel manager came over and recommended they call 911.  They refused and said they wanted to take him up to his room.  The manager got them a wheel chair and they again lifted him and put him in the chair where he proceeded to slide out twice.  The guys laughed as did the manager and people in the bar.  This is a dangerous situation and IMHO, should have been dealt with in a more mature way.The classroom we were in for 4 days had little A/C but the hotel never moved us to a better conference room, although they were all empty.  Not sure why. . .just now it was uncomfortable.  The conference received a stand-alone A/C but it was quite noisey.  Not coming back only because we expected better from The famous Roosevelt Hotel!",,,
179,Sherie A.,"Springfield, VA",23,28,34,3.0,2/4/2017,"The hotel was ok.  Location great.  Because of the protest they shut down streets leading up to the front of the hotel.  So, we parked 5 blocks away and walked to the hotel.  When we got to the lobby of the hotel, it felt like 90 degrees.  Our room was decent.  I'm not sure about the bed skirts cause it had a streak of white substance that I didn't want to touch!",,,
180,Melanie L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,92,11,1.0,8/12/2017,"If I could give this place less than one star, I would. The only good thing is the location, only a few blocks from Grand Central.  Other than that, this is basically a dilapidated Motel 6. I'm sure it was something in its day, but that day is long gone and they've done exactly nothing to bring it into present day. From the old window air conditioner, the slow draining and old tub, to the barely working elevators, it's not worth the $200 plus a night.",,,
181,Adam D.,"Napa, CA",0,9,2,2.0,12/11/2016,"While the lobby is beautiful and location is good there were big problems with our stay:- with several elevators broken we (and the rest of the guests we saw) spent half an hour just waiting to get up or down.  3 times we took the stairs because we got tired of waiting.  Every other guest we met was equally irritated and delayed.- the cleanliness and quality of the room was poor: empty water bottles left inside, peeling wallpaper, broken toilet handle - not good- the key cards often didn't work meaning we twice had to go back to the last lobby and wait in line. We watched a women frantically try to get into her room so she could pee but get told by staff that she had to go back downstairs. - the bellmen were awesomely helpful but counter staff were often rude and unhelpful. Check alternatives before booking here.",1,,
182,Kylea D.,"Columbus, OH",298,14,2,2.0,11/20/2016,"Room was misrepresented online. We were disappointed upon arrival. Room was dirty. The heating/cooling vent was rusted and buckled in, and portions of the wall were discolored. Not the worse hotel I've stayed in, but I didn't feel like the room was worth the amount I was paying per night. Unfortunately, when I voiced this to the hotel staff they had very little remedy options and frankly were rude. I wish they would have been more accommodating or apologetic. They had no resolution to our issue other than paying an early departure fee with no help to find a more suitable hotel. Not wanting to loose money we stayed. What saved this place was the location - walkable to all the staples of New York. The lobby was beautiful and the lobby bar had a great atmosphere and great drinks. Probably won't be back to the hotel unless it is to get drinks at the bar.",2,,
183,Opal T.,"Atlanta, GA",305,236,447,2.0,9/14/2015,"Old hotel... Old rooms... Old news. Don't get me wrong, it is sufficient - but just so old school I can't get over it. I've stayed in the rooms and have been to the bar. Not impressed. There are other, better traditional NYC hotels. The bartenders are on the slow side... No sense of urgency, but solid cocktails. I had a stiff Manhattan. Almost made me forgive the carpet in the bar.",3,3,2
184,Justin W.,"Baton Rouge, LA",26,2,0,1.0,4/18/2017,"Never going here again in my life. The hotel's only feature worth mentioning is location - being near Grand Central Station. Otherwise, there are better hotels that maybe are cheaper and better like Holiday Inn. The list of complaints in order of appearance:1: Reception - Horrible, staff acted like they didn't give a f*ck. Waited for a room for 3 hours after 12 pm, and some of the people I saw didn't get their room till 5:00 pm. Every time I met a staff member, they would not be welcoming or smile at all.2: Elevators - Forget them at all, you would better off taking the stairs. Only 5 out of 6 worked and the wait for one was from 5-10 minutes. One in every two elevators that appeared also would be filled. 3: Rooms: Not all rooms were made equal - some were large, were small,  had microwaves, had fridges, or bathrooms that varied in sizes. But all had one thing in common - ineffective temperature control. The controls for temperature were ancient and you were screwed with either a freezer or sauna for a room.4: Accommodations: Wifi for 15.95 a day for only 3 MB is BS. You literally can go a cafe with free unlimited Wi-Fi in a 5 minute walk. Housekeeping was also a joke - Room wasn't even touched till the 5th day. Vending and gift shop overpriced as h*ll, as you basically have no great source for drinking water.Overall, best stay away from this hotel.",5,,

Fifth, it took about 25 minutes to check in.

191,Leeza G.,"Jupiter, FL",4,1,0,1.0,8/20/2016,"If I could give this hotel zero stars, I would. This was a terrible experience from the very beginning. I'd like to start by saying do not be fooled by the ambiance when you arrive at this hotel. We arrived at this hotel at around 10:30 p.m. and waited about ten minutes for an elevator. When the elevator didn't come, we decided to tote our heavy luggage up the stairs. We then waited about another 40 minutes to check-in. Note that there was one woman working at the front desk for a hotel that was completely sold out. The woman working the front desk then had the audacity to complain to ME that she had to work an ""emergency"" shift and still had wet hair. We waited about another five minutes for the elevator. We were cramped into the hot, stuffy elevator with about 10 other people. This appeared to be a pattern at the Roosevelt. We finally arrived at our room. WOW! This room was not at all how it was pictured on the website. Wallpaper was coming off, the AC unit sounded as though an airplane was taking off, rooms and bathrooms were musty, smelly and old, and above all, I felt as though I was sleeping outside in a construction zone. I've never heard so much noise in my life- jackhammering, beeping and the sound of cars roaring by really provides for a great night's sleep. Needless to say, we checked out almost immediately. The manager was nice and completely refunded our reservation. I would not recommend.",4,2,
192,Savannah G.,"Kansas City, MO",22,7,9,5.0,3/2/2018,I stayed here in October and it was great! Hotel is older but you cannot beat being less than 2 blocks from Grand Central Station and less than 1/2 a mile from Times Square. I was going to stay here this weekend as well and prepaid for my hotel months ago. With the storm I was unable to make it and the Roosevelt gave me a full refund. This will definitely be my go to hotel when visiting NYC!,,,
193,Chris G.,"Birmingham, AL",31,196,10,3.0,8/1/2015,"Don't get me wrong. I love old hotels. I love them for their quirks and eccentricity. But the Grand Dame is sorely in need of a facelift. From indifferent air conditioning in the meeting rooms to hit-and-miss hot water in the bathrooms, to antiquated elevators that take forever, the Roosevelt is one of those hotels that just needs a fix -- and fast. The toilets that run. The lack of adequate lighting in the closet, etc., make this a hard hotel to like. I'd love to say that the Roosevelt makes up for it with the desk staff, but that's hit-and-miss as well. Look, I realize that I'm from the South, which evidently makes me fair game for the smartasses of the world. But when I hand over my drivers license to the desk clerk for verification, I'd prefer for her to not wrinkle her nose and mutter ""Alabama"" under her breath. I really like the lobby, by the way. It's definitely a trip back in time. But it also has a bit of dinginess about it, sorely underlit. The rooftop bar is very cool. And the location is terrific as well. I just think a little investment on the owners' part would turn this storied property back into a memorable stay.",6,4,1
