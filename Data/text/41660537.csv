This was more or less the conversation I subconsciously had with my friend after we got off of work Friday night. I usually make people come below 14th street when hanging out so for once I decided to make the trek north. It wasn't a bad idea. We went to one bar and then we were trying to figure out another place after 7pm for one last drink. Insert, I randomly remember coming here years ago, they have to still be cheap. I mean ""TRASH"" is in the title. Moral of the story: the place is actually nicer than you would think. Yeah, it still has that motorcycle metal bar kind of vibe. They have skee ball! The drinks are pretty cheap. It wasn't happy hour and I still paid only $4 for a beer. My friend wanted to charge more on his card since there was a $10 minimum and got a round of shots. For cafe patron tequila it was only $5. Horrible wonderful life decisions. Also, the bartender noticed I didn't want to really spend more money and just refilled my beer cup half way. Quality service.",3,2,3
1,Fred A.,"Manhattan, NY",399,152,0,3.0,8/28/2018,"This place is so divey, I don't even know where to start. Just look at the name? It's not even trying. Or it's trying so hard with the name it's ironic? I don't even know anymore.The bartenders range from awesome, friendly, generous, to this one older guy who's honestly a real nasty pain.The customers range from locals swinging by to, well, I don't know. Not UES. This place is honestly an enigma, but a much needed mystery to the Upper East Side.",1,1,
2,Jerome T.,"New York, NY",99,372,3046,4.0,9/24/2017,"When I leave here, I feel like I need a shower. And I check my bag for bugs. For the UES, this is about as shitty as it gets. Cheap beer, check. No food, check. Regulars who look at you weird when you walk in, check. Cool, slightly salty bartenders, check. Lot's of TV""s to watch your fantasy players get injured, yup. Urine and puke on the floors, probs. Do I recommend this dive bar, check.",7,5,2
3,Tamara G.,"Cranberry Township, PA",13,120,460,4.0,5/7/2018,"Great dive bar on UES with good live bands & friendly bar staff. I was there on Cinco de Mayo from 9:30-1am. Crowd was a mix of 20's to 60's. No one was obnoxious or crazy. Front of the bar is for chatting, back of the bar is for those who wanna hear the music. The ladies room for a NYC dive bar was surprisingly tidy. No cover for the band, but you should throw some cash into their tip jar, bands are working ya know? Anyway, definitely recommend American Trash if you like a dive bar vibe, great live music (Saturday was blues) & decently priced drinks.",,,
4,Elizabeth D.,"Plainview, NY",73,198,119,3.0,7/15/2018,This is a classic. It's a NYC dive bar. It's a great place for some drinks. I like it. I'm glad they changed the name back to the original! It gets funkier in the later hours. All depends on what your looking for.,1,,

The beer prices were about average for a divey bar in Manhattan ($8 for a Guinness, $5 for a bud). I did not partake in the 4 shots for $12 deal, but that's a bargain.The crowd was very friendly, very into the music, which was great. I don't go to the Upper East Side much, but I'd definitely go back to American Trash. Seems like a great little neighborhood bar.",,,
7,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",268,434,978,4.0,11/3/2016,"Great very casual bar upper east with always friendly service, a jukebox, pool and skeeball!This is always a fun stop when in the mood for some bar games. I only stop by when there is not a heavy crowd and the games are available, so that is my only experience, sans any crowd.Interesting decor hanging all over the walls Including a mini race car, and two things I noticed the recent visit - crutches and heels from the ceiling.  Bartenders always nice, friendly, and the peeps I've seen hanging out there also seem friendly.  I brought some out of town friends here after they ran the NYC marathon last year and they also loved the chill casual vibe staying out much later than expected after post marathon exhaustion.They are also one of the only bars I know that serves my favorite beer, Chamay, in the pretty Chamay glasses.Recommend for a casual bar with bar games.",8,4,8

We didn't have a plan and decided to check it out since we heard live music. The band was SO good, really playful, played all kinds of music. People were actually dancing, me and my hot date were dancing the whole time bouncing around like loons. Bouncer was very nice, bartenders were fast, drinks were good and also cheap, and they had lots of Halloween candy that I could eat in between goofing off in the dance floor. Overall a great find!",1,,
9,George D.,"Manhattan, NY",33,5,3,4.0,11/5/2015,"Skeeball is expensive, but the beers are moderately priced. Gives off a rapey vibe, without the fear of actual rape. This place is only 2 on the jabroni scale.",,6,

AT THE SAME TIME)The crowd seems super chill and the drink specials are really fair-priced. I guess the only downside is it's in UES. But not really a downside at all.

13,Will T.,"New York, NY",1,15,13,4.0,12/7/2016,"This bar was a couple blocks from my apartment so I must've been here 2-4 times a month.  Every time I came, I expected there to be more people due to the low prices (considering its the UES).  Never got packed, always a friendly vibe, pool table was well shared, and even the patron is cheap.  Totally recommend for a relaxed evening with a friend or two. Especially if some of the more upscale bars like Pony Bar and Bar-Coastal are packed.",1,,

15,Katie H.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1239,688,492,4.0,6/27/2013,"Typical dive bar on the outside. Fun, quirky, sports bar on the inside. Can't give your typical impression of the place since I went for an Elite event and it was just a bunch of foodies rather than the usual crowd. From what I've read in the reviews it seems like this place attracts people of all ages. But I can definitely give my first impression, which was a positive one! I don't mind dive bars but usually don't like the lack in size and space. Some of the past ones I've been to have literally been the size of my hallway and can get packed FAST. This place however, had plenty of room for mingling. There were flat screen tv's outlining the ceilings with re-caps of all sorts of sports. It was cool that they were showing rugby from the usual American sports. Yay variety! There was also barstools among a pretty wide bar stretching from one end of the place to the other. Also, I saw some booths and additional seating in the back for those who don't like the high-tops. And a pool table!* Kinda dim inside to set the mood and again... plenty of space to clink and drink or get your groove on if that's what you kids like to do these days.**American Trash is a pretty cool spot on the UES. Will be back again to see what the usual crowd is like.*Really wish I was good at pool. I wanna be one of those pros that flick the ball up in the air over two others and then right into the corner left pocket. *sigh***Did I really just say that? How old am I?!",2,1,1
16,Anna S.,"Queens, NY",51,81,10,4.0,6/15/2015,This place is funny. The decor is interesting and there was a band Saturday night which gave a fun vibe. We had a nice time. They had beers and cocktails. We ordered vodka and cranberry which were fine. Have fun here ! : ),,,

19,Heather G.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,16,2,4.0,2/10/2015,"OK, so you will probably wake up hungover and miserable after going to this place. Because 4 shots of random mystery alcohol for $12. But at the same time, you can also be quite drunk for the price of one drink at some other bars. And beyond that, I have always had a good time here. The music is usually quite good. Lots of songs you forgot how much you loved (including lots of 90s music), or you can do the jukebox at 50 cents a pop for most songs. I also once went here when there was a live band doing covers of old songs, which was quite fun too. Basically, just a fun, welcoming atmosphere all around! My friends work on the UES, so we spend a lot of time up there, and this is the least pretentious and most fun place around.Oh, and since they don't serve food, you're allowed to bring in food from outside. I recommend 3 Star Diner across the street. Best to go there early in the night, at least before you start on that second or third shot of apple whiskey/coconut rum/cinnamon tequila.",1,,
20,Michael F.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,483,12,5.0,2/8/2013,"$12 for 4 shots. Bartender remembered me 3 weeks later after meeting me once. By name and drink. Everyone's friendly and accommodating. Music is a very mixed bag, but there's a jukebox if you need to assert your will. They're willing to set up beer pong or flip cup tables if you're so inclined (not a fratty bar at all though.)Best part is Red's in the back. Really friendly Buffalo style hot dog place, slightly slow service. It's just one dude. A huge variety of hot dog styles (banh mi, loaded potato, hoisin, bbq, etc.) Buffalo wings. Beef on weck. All of it's delicious and a few steps above comparable bar's food.",1,,

24,Mark L.,"Chicago, IL",4,3,0,4.0,5/2/2014,"I love American Trash, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I live in Chicago now, so I haven't been there since the former owner sold it a few years ago. I lived a few blocks away on the UES for 15 years and this was easily the best place on the block. Most people call it a Dive bar, but it's really a Biker/Rock and Roll Bar. It has a great atmosphere and it's the kind of place that feels right at home at night when the vampires and weirdo's come out, but go there during the day or happy hour and it may feel a bit funny. You may think it's a strange clientele, but that's because  you haven't spoken to anyone there yet, they are all down to earth decent people that just don't happen to be conservative by nature.If you feel uncomfortable there or that you are being treated poorly that's a good thing, it probably means your being a typical UES kiddie a-hole and you are not welcome. They are subtly trying to get you to leave. It's like a test if you stick around and don't act like a jerk they will accept you. Most of the bars on 1st and 2nd avenues are the same old post collegiate crap bars, so this place is like an oasis in the desert. It will be a sad thing if this place ever closes.Mark L",1,1,1

I totally agree with the other reviewer's description of a Cheers-like vibe ""where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came."" Alla is my favorite bartender.

27,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,8/5/2011,"Seems like this place has been around forever. I remember coming here years ago when it was more of a biker rock and roll kind of bar. Even to this day it is almost the same, except the crowd is a little different. What is good is that you won't find the UES frats and preps singing along to Bon Jovi here. I like walking into a bar for a cheap PBR and hearing AC/DC or Bad Company.Sometimes the crowd can be kind of sketchy here, and a mix of young and old. Can be confused with a dive bar but it really isn't. Pool table, internet jukebox, and bands sometimes play there on weekends too. Nothing too noteworthy on tap, but a decent bottled beer selection. They do have some bar food on the menu, but I have never eaten here. Also has a happy hour and shot specials. Not a bad bar if in the area and looking for a mellow place to call it a night at. At least you can hear some decent tunes here if you prefer rock.",3,1,3

But seriously, once you get past the bad bar smell, you can focus on how dirty the place is. I learned about a good beer called Shock Top. With a slice of orange, it was a nice treat. They do sell food, but I'm not that ballsy. There are plenty of HD TVs so you can catch the game. There was also an interesting mixed crowd of borderline homeless and upper east siders.",1,6,3

Now that I know, I will surely be attending as much as possible. Everyone was really welcoming. The acts were swell. It was what I think people would call a ""singer-songwriter"" open mic. The man who runs it, Dan, seems very kind. I'm a singer and he said he'd be happy to accompany me. How wonderful and giving is that? The vibe there was really nice in that way, and everyone is supportive. I'm not sure how many of open mics are, but I suspect they aren't all this way. If you're a musician and you want to test out your songs, get feedback, or just do what you love and perform for live people, I would recommend this open mic.

I was there with my best-friend and the behavior we witnessed by the bouncer was disgusting. An individual came in and she couldn't find her idea. So, I heard her say ""I don't have my idea, but I'm 27"" and the guy she was with was just joking with the bouncer and said ""if we find her idea will you buy her a drink?"" The bouncer gets off his seat and starts getting in this guys face, and is telling him it's time to leave. I see the girl grabbing her friend's arm and I heard her saying ""okay, I'm sorry, he was just kidding, wouldn't expect you to buy me a drink"", then the bouncer starts pushing this man and calling him a ""f--king f-ggot"", this man was clearly not gay, but my best-friend is and he was repulsed by the bouncer being so ignorant, and using such foul language.  Once the man and his friend left, my friend said something to the bouncer about how he shouldn't use that word, because you never know who is listening and that the bouncer was a representative of the bar, and to that the bouncer replies, ""if you want to spend your evening at a bar that gives a f--k that you're a qu3er, go to the village and hangout with your own kind"". I will never ever go back to this place and I'm going to make sure everyone I know hears about this!",24,2,1

Nothing has changed inside the place.  They have an open mic on tuesdays which can be real good. They have live music on the weekends. Jukebox. Pool table.  Really great, attentive bartenders. There is always an amazingly ecclectic mix of peolpe there - Middle-aged men drinking hard before going back to their studio apartments they can barely afford after the divorce - A couple ghetto style guys glancing around their ladies if they have any there that night - an old lady about 5'1'' who drinks whiskey straight all night - A girl or two who just aren't in the mood and came to the trash to havea  stiff one or two.  Its a colorful place and a goddamned good one for tying one on and escaping the normal UES crowd.",2,4,1

I thought the bar was fine for the purpose it served, cheap drinks, room to stand and listen to the band, and not an over crowded bar. I was able to walk in, find a place to lean, get a beer easily at the bar and comfortably listen to the music. The music wasn't too loud, either, as so many live bands in small spaces are. I would consider it a dive, but with clean bathrooms, which is always a plus! All in all, I thought it was a good, mellow, unpretentious place on the UES. I would go back.",1,,
59,Michael F.,"New York, NY",519,391,85,4.0,3/26/2009,"The door to the bar opens, and there it is, wafting right in your face: the smell of stale beer. The good thing about this bar is that it's an oasis in the middle of the sterile upper east side. It looks like it should be somewhere downtown. Genuine dive bars with decent prices are a rare commodity in this nabe. On a weekday night (at least the Wednesday night when my friends and I were there), it's fairly civilized, and the smell abates once you spend more than 10 seconds inside.It's pretty spacious and has a decent pool table, and I'm betting that it gets packed on a weekend night, which begs the question: Is it double jeopardy to go out to a UES bar on a night when it is also likely overrun with bridge and tunnel douchenozzlery? Methinks yes. I'll stick to coming here when I visit my friend who lives nearby.",6,5,5

'be there'. Dark and dingy it may be, American trash has the best digital juke box with a wide selection of albums, a rather large variety of drinks, a pool table and some booth style seating for the more intimate.The decoration is very typically what you'd expect from an American bar, just not on the Upper East side of manhattan surrounded by the wealthy Italians. However not to say it's a bad thing at all it brings the bar great character and brings a feel of relief to you after a days work or in my case a day in the sun in central park, with the most relaxed atmoshphere and the decor which takes you to a far away place perhaps to some, high school back in so-cal, it really is a great place for beginners to the drinking scene, and perhaps for those who are not up for a eventful night out on the town.Happy hour here is seriously a happy hour!American trash??

67,Andrea D.,"New York, NY",31,41,0,3.0,4/20/2008,I disagree with those who think this bar is a true dive. This is an UES bar trying to keep up with the real dive bars in the LES.
