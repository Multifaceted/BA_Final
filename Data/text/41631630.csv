The band plays in 1 corner and the rest of the crowd creates a half circle around them. We went to Stage 1 since it was free although at the end of the show they have a recommended donation of $10, so I'd recommend bringing cash! There was also a one drink minimum which is extremely reasonable and loosely enforced.Listened to two different bands, one was pop rock and another was new jazz. Very different styles and extremely refreshing to watch. I would definitely come back here for more live music and would be even tempted to check out stage 2 / 3 at some point if I know the artists there.",1

Place is tiny, plainly decorated with wood, dark paint, tall windows and music instruments in front of a small stage.Their was a few tables to sit but right in front / next to the musical instruments so you'll definitely need ear plugs. Drinks were standard city prices but heavily watered down.Cool experience. Worth a try!You rocked Kenny!",1

I've discovered some great artists here (Crooked Coast; Camelo). I'd recommend previewing the artists via the Rockwood website (artist links embedded) so you know which stage (caution: stage 2 and 3 require separate cover charges; stage 1 is free) to be at and when.,
4,,6/24/2018,354,,"New York, NY",Katie H.,100,5.0,204,"Found this place while looking for live music options in Manhattan, specifically cover bands. While Rockwood didn't have that, they do feature really good small artists. They have three separate stages (two of which were cover-free). The venue was small and intimate, but I never felt crowded. There is also a one drink minimum, but I never felt pressured to order. It was a nice, relaxed atmosphere to listen to some unknown but talented musicians.I didn't go down to stage three where they had a cover, but I enjoyed stage two a lot. They had good acoustics, and it was a pleasure to get to see two different bands with varying music styles live.The people in this venue seemed like they were here to have a good time listening to good music. It wasn't pretentious at all, and everyone was respectful to the performers and each other.I would come back for sure!",2

Drinks can be ordered and the music was pleasant.  Enjoyable time, but one can't hold a conversation if you're looking for thA little bit of rock style, but down under.  Underground and aspiring artists making their way in NY!

I love the variety of music that shows up on stage and I love that stage one has no cover fee.This is a great idea for date night or even just to pop in to see a random set on a Tuesday. The drinks are moderately priced, I mean, this is New York and you are getting a show, so it's worth it.The only thing I would say is GET AIR CONDITIONING. It gets so humid and stuffy in there.This place definitely isn't spacious, so you get to know your neighbor pretty fast.All and all, still an amazing venue jam packed with great artists. 4.5/5",1

Rockwood reminds me of the bars and places you'd go to see music in Austin or Nashville, intimate and full of wood paneling with an occasional sound interruptions delaying the show. I really haven't had a bad experience at any of the stages thus far.It's a ticketless enterprise and some of the shows are give what you can/suggested donation. Each stage (there's 3) varies in size but all have a bar. None serve food (that I know of) but beware that Stage 3's basement show is a 2 drink minimum. Also Stage 3 is located on Orchard Street around the corner from Stage 1 & 2 located on the eastside on Allen Street.

It's not terrible but there have been (and still are) a lot of better places -- both to play music and to see it. Stage 1 is just a mess; you're basically fighting for space to stand in and most of the bands who play there aren't worth your time anyway. Stages 2 and 3 are definitely somewhat better. Even so, you're not going to catch too many of the really good artists at Rockwood. Also, it's inconveniently located and the staff members think they're doing you a favor by getting back to you. Oddly enough, the people at both Joe's Pub and City Winery are easier to deal with -- not to mention the bands are better and the ambience nicer. Skip this place unless you have a good friend playing there.",
15,,8/7/2017,58,,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",Candra S.,142,4.0,87,Attended an acoustic performance here last night on stage 2. Rockwood has 3 stages (1-3). There could be multiple performances going on so you'd need to check their schedule. Some are ticketed events and others are not. The rooms are small so they provide for an intimate experience (a plus). My sister goes their quite often and enjoys it. She is in a wheelchair and able to maneuver the space. Drinks were ok. On average they are about $10 which is typical... They don't serve food which would be a great addition to their services.,3

The bands are great, even on the no cover stage (stage 1), and the bar is very cozy and nice. The only thing that was a bit of a turn off was the service, since the folks who work there were not very friendly. In the second night, my wife decided not to order a drink and the waitress rolled her eyes and went away, even though we had donated pretty generously to the band. When I paid for my drink, she didn't even bother to offer me the change.From music standpoint though, it's one of the best.",

Updated review",521,,"Fresh Meadows, NY",Eric Y.,1453,3.0,145,"I finally got another chance to attend a show at Rockwood Music Hall again; This time I was at Stage Two watching Ben Alessi perform. Having been to two of their stages, I have to say that stage two has much better production value. This stage seems better equipped to accommodate a band, the lighting rigs seemed to have a better range and the acoustics were significantly better. One of the problems with their smaller stage was that the audio seems I loved that stage two had a balcony section for VIP, the view up there must be a lot better. Paying a small cover fee of 5$, I was able to see Ben Alessi perform live. I look forward to seeing what this artist has to offer in the future. I hope that Rockwood continues to offer up and coming artists, its a great chance to catch an intimate show with your favorite artists before they get too famous.",2

I was there to see the Amazing Gem, Victory Boyd, she was everything I need on a Monday night. I loved the intimacy of the venue it gave off a nice homey vibe. There's standing room, limited seating, full bar (cash/card), and the space is well kept and clean. I will probably come back.My problem was with the server that night. (here's the run down)I'm sitting up stairs and the server comes over to take my oder and I notice her holding a card reader. I ask, ""Do you take cash?""she says, ""Yes"" I proceed to order and then she says, ""but do you have a card so I can keep your tab open?""Not really seeing the problem at the moment I go into my purse to look for a card (mind you I just had to report card fraud on my main card and I don't like to carry all of my cards at once) I couldn't find my other card at the moment. So she says, ""It's ok, just don't leave without paying."" That was the kicker - like wow this was some discrimination BS! I still did the two drink minimum and tipped her well because over all I had a nice time. I hope that what she did wasn't normal protocol. But what she did is Not ok and needs to be brought to her attention. Peace",2
19,,6/5/2017,117,1,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",Jesse R.,19,3.0,464,"An intimate venue to see a show at. Multiple shows in a night means you can see a lot of music in a pretty short amount of time. I always have a problem with the cost of the drinks. $10 wines mean I have a hard time sticking around for more than one. And it's not like I'm swirling my glass in Venetian botanical gardens. It's just kind of a dark bar space.  Annoyingly, most shows have drink minimums (God forbid you sit down) so it means the wait staff will be harassing you during the shows to ensure you reached your drink minimum.I just want to pay to see the music and be left alone.",2

Both shows were great, and the cover was only $5. Despite the small space the sound was good. There are a few tables around the stage and some seats at the bar, but most people stood and a few of us danced. There's a small dimly lit but clean bathroom in a corner. A beer will run you between $6-$8 and they do have cocktails, as well as a water cooler you can help yourself to. UFO on tap. Nice venue, I'm sure I'll be back!",4

On my first visit, I only saw Stage 1 and Stage 2 - Stage 3 had a cover and we were so impressed by the bands on the other stages that we felt no need to go over there.The bouncer was super friendly, stamped our hands, explained where each stage was and let us right in on a Saturday night. It seems like Stage 1 is almost always free, and Stage 2 is sometimes free later at night. You can check on their site to see if you need to buy tickets for a specific set or not. Even if you do have to buy tickets / pay cover, it's always very fairly priced for some great talent. Drink prices were surprisingly good for a music venue as well, I paid $6 for a bottle of Fat Tire which happens to be one of my favorites.Stage 1 is pretty small and was packed, but Stage 2 was a good space and we could enjoy the music without being crowded in at all. Even when I wanted a drink I was able to get right up to the bar and get served right away.Definitely a great experience with some super talented bands. It is so awesome to know that I have a great music venue like this so close to my apartment - you can look at the lineup of bands literally any night and you'll find a talented band that you'll enjoy. I'll be back - and often!",2

My experiences have always been great. I've just never felt compelled to write a review until now. About a week and a half ago I emailed the dreaded info@ email address asking if there were possibly a ticket available for a sold out show. Would anyone even see the email?? My heart hoped someone would read it AND actually respond but my head knew better. Alas, my head was wrong. Someone did respond. And pretty quickly. It wasn't what I wanted to hear, though, that the show was indeed sold out. No tix avails. Then the respondent asked if I wanted to be put on a waitlist. He said he would notify me if something opened up. I said YES but was a little skeptical. But hey, I didn't even expect a human to read the email, let alone respond, so why not keep hope alive, right?You probably know where this is going because there are 5 stars in this review. HE ACTUALLY NOTIFIED ME WHEN A TICKET BECAME AVAILABLE. What the what?!?! Yes, I know that is technically his job and what he should have done. Too often, however, folks don't do their job. I can add great customer service to the list of reasons I keep coming back to Rockwood Music Hall! Big shout out to Nate Kreichman for restoring my faith in info@ email addresses!",8

Refused to serve my second drink because I wouldn't tip her because of her rudeness!!The good thing is she didn't single me out - it wasn't personal. She was rude to a bunch of people.

I was advised there was a one drink minumum per set. I order a UFO White. But couldn't fade the idea of being heckled for a drink through each set so although I wanted to see new acts I left shortly after his. I wasn't told of any drink specials but I did see a sign outside that mentioned 2 for 1 drinks when leaving. Hopefully that wasn't the case and I wasn't told of the specials. Outside of the bar offerings, the sound quality is ok. Better than average but it seems like the sound quality varies depending on the stage. Stage 3 seems to have the best stage while stage 2 seemed a bit too low. He had an acoustic set which should be fairly simple to control, again not sure but the sound quality in 3 seems miles ahead.

A couple of years ago, I would have given 5 stars for sure. Although, lately I have been super unsatisfied with my time at Rockwood. The first point that really ticked me off is their drink minimum. I went to a Sunday night show at 10pm, and there was a 2 drink minimum for the 45 minute set I was seeing. Not to mention, the set didn't start until about 10:20, and I wasn't allowed downstairs until about 10:15. I'd rather not get drunk on a Sunday night right before work. On top of that, since the shows are usually only one set at a time, the waitress has to interrupt everyone watching the show to get their second drink order. Rockwood seems to be much more interested in making money than showcasing the amazing music they have coming through their venue and this makes me really upset. They recently re-branded (maybe a year ago?) and made their prices much more expensive. As a performer, it is already difficult to get friends/fans to come out to shows. Rockwood is definitely not helping this cause by putting extra cost commitments on attendees and making it difficult for them to enjoy the show they came out for.",6

45,,1/8/2017,54,1,"New York, NY",Lisa e.,20,3.0,298,"This is a review for the bathroom at Rockwood. Yes.  I said, '....for the bathroom'.Let me cut right to the chase: If you are claustrophobic, you must be aware of something regarding the bathroom.As of January 8, 2017, there appears to be only one (windowless) bathroom at this venue, located just past one end of the bar.  This bathroom has one lock, and it's a very unusual lock.  It's sort of like a brass half circle with a groove cut out along the curve of the half-circle.  Inside this groove is a very tiny knob...hard to get a good hold of...that you must then slide around the curve to Lock/Unlock the door.When it came to Unlocking the door, I had a very difficult time.  The tiny little knob felt 'stuck' in the groove.  I had to try multiple times before it finally Unlocked.  Not only that but, while I was trying to unlock the door, I subconsciously realized that 1) I would never be capable of breaking down the door myself,  2) there was no window, 3) there was loud music on the other side of the door which would mean that initially, others may not realize I need help and  4) if/when the Fire Dept were called, it would take at least another few minutes to get to me.  For claustrophobics, finding themselves in this kind of a situation is extremely traumatic, even with only seconds into the situation!If you go to this venue and see this type of lock is still on the bathroom door, proceed with caution!+++++++++++++++P.S.

I went to see St. Lenox, who is fantastic, but I would have preferred the show to be anywhere else. When I found out about the show on the band's Facebook, I went to the venue's website for more information. It said that the show was free, which I thought was pretty incredible. I did find it pretty odd that they stacked the shows one per hour. The show before the one I wanted to go to was ticketed, so I didn't arrive until right before the show began. It was on Stage 2, and when we went in, we discovered that the show wasn't actually free, as advertised, because you were required to buy a $10 drink ticket. Not expecting to have to pay a cover, I hadn't brought cash, and you couldn't use a card, so I had to go take cash out from their ATM to pay for a drink ticket for a drink that I didn't particularly want anyway. (UPDATE: Their ATM says it has a 3.00 fee, but when I took out $40.00, it ended up charging me an additional $2.50, so the total fee was $5.50. Fucking seriously?) Absolutely nowhere on RMH's website does it say anything about drink minimums. It literally says ""All shows are free unless otherwise listed with a 'Buy Tickets' option or a cover charge."" There was no such listing on the show I was going to, and yet...To make things even more annoying, the whole drink ticket thing is a racket as well. The beers were in the $6-$8 range, which means the venue is pocketing the remainder of your $10, and cocktails were all more than $10. I would've loved to sit down, especially because the stage is pretty low, but the tables all had signs that they required a 2 drink minimum, so literally no one in the crowd sat. I understand that approach at venues that serve food (people who want food usually need a table to eat off of, after all), but requiring buying extra drinks to sit down, and leaving literally all of your seating empty, is pretty ridiculous.There was a tip jar for the band brought around by a waitress, so I know the musicians weren't seeing any of the money from the drinks forced upon us, and then the set, which didn't start right at 8:00 either, was ended by whoever was working the sound board around 8:40, much to the protestations of the crowd. There was a ticketed show at 9:00, so they hurried everyone out and cut the set short. I understand wanting to get everyone their stage time and keep things running to a schedule, but I can't help but feel I was conned into paying for a show that was shorter than it should've been. I would have been happy to pay for the show if it meant that the artist was receiving some or all of that ticket price, but I'm unconvinced that the artist would get anything from RMH. I did put money in the tip jar, and I hope that actually ended up in the artist's pocket and not the venue's or the dick on the soundboard.This was my first time at this venue, but I ran into a musician friend of mine there who also said that he hates this venue and wouldn't have come except that he really wanted to support Andrew Choi (St. Lenox), and I totally agree. It would take someone I really, really adore playing here to get me back. There are so many better, less shady venues that won't hit you up to buy drinks during every set or just call a spade a spade and charge a cover and not shove you out the door because they need to con more people into $10 drink tickets. There are even better venues within walking distance. (Mercury Lounge is just down the street! Cake Shop and Arlene's Grocery are just around the corner! Sidewalk Cafe is a handful of blocks away and also has free live music and a purchasing minimum that they fully inform you of UPFRONT by including on their website ""Kindly observe the two-something minimum""!) I hope that no other artists I really love play this bizarre, rip off room.I also totally forgot that my friend had a hair in his draft beer.",5

One waitress to handle all orders.  People did't get their first drink until 2/3's into the performance.  There was a performance before and after ours.  Talk about a bum's rush.  We went to see a Minneapolis based band with a group of friends.  Ticket prices were reasonable at $15 each.  But because of the late start, the band's performance was cut short.There is no management.  Thankfully, the patrons are reasonable and intelligent people which is not the case of the owners or managers.It's a fire trap in the making - I was hoping for a fire marshall to come in, look at the lobby and demand the place to immediately close.  The lobby was so packed with humanity, if a person fainted they couldn't fall or even lean over.  As far as I'm concerned, once was three times too many.",

I really enjoyed coming here and plan on coming back!Here are my TIPS (mainly for the 'free' stage)- There are 3 stages at Rockwood. One you pay for (usually) one that's free, and one that's a mystery to me- You enter on Allen street- There are new bands every hour that perform in the 'free section'- They request 1 drink per set, but don't enforce it. Don't be a jerk.- Drinks are cheap. Good wine for $10 a pop, poured with a heavy hand- Waitress will come around with a bucket for tipping the artist. Show your support! - There are seats along the bar and a couple tables, but it's really smallA perfect evening would consist of: drinks at blue ribbon beer garden, dinner at sons of essex, music at rockwood, then go play arcade games at two bit.

Bravo! Very knowledgeable guy and super professional.   He even gave us tips for where to go to eat after the show and it was perfect (a place called Marshall Stack, right down the block - always ask a big guy where to eat!)The downstairs room is Stage 3 and it's very intimate and cozy.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful (not pushy).  I recall the least expensive beer was 5 but I chose what turned out to be a delicious Pinot Noir served in a proper wine glass.   The sound in the room is warm and perfect.  Maybe the best way to describe it would be like listening to live music with those pro type headphones?This is my new favourite place.   It has a diverse crowd, serious live music all night long and a terrific staff.  Oh, yeah - the bathroom I used was SPOTLESS ...I didn't think this was possible for a rock club.   What else could I want?Rockwood Music Hall get ready because I'm coming back!",1

Tickets were a very reasonable $20 but there was a 2 drink minimum and drinks weren't cheap - where were those $5 cocktails everyone else is mentioning? Second time we saw American Nomads on Stage 2, the smaller of the upstairs venues. There is a balcony with a few tables, big bar, and dance floor. Again, no $5 cocktails but tickets were only $10.  Sound is fantastic. My only complaint - and hence 4 stars - is that they seem to schedule the shows very tightly together and rush patrons out after each show ends. Very wisely however they rush you into the adjacent bar, which does not have $5 cocktails but it does have a screen projecting the act currently playing (although oddly they have music playing so you can only see but not hear them).",1

I had the Dark and Stormy. One of the best ones I've had, with the nicely spiced Kraken rum. I had two. These were 12 bucks a pop but eh, what the hell. They were yummy. It's a solid venue.

Rockwood is perfect for nights when you don't know what your plans are but want to do something fun and low-key with the potential for finding an artist you'll love. No plan or commitment needed, just walk in whenever. Each hour from 6pm - midnight brings a new artist to either of two rooms (stages) - so, no time for encores. For Stage #2, a handful of shows are longer and ticketed. Check the website, pay cash at the door.Most of the gigs I've seen here have been indie/folky/singer-songwriter. No fist pumps or mosh pits anytime soon - but a great environment for sweet, intimate shows with great energy. At both stages, there are sometimes a few small tables right up against the stage, and at the larger Stage #2, more seating on the balcony and a bit of standing room. For both stages, the 1-drink minimum is barely enforced. Drink prices are... well, a Corona was like $8. But the show is free!This is not the fault of the venue, or even in their direct control... but one thing I consistently notice here more than any other venue is the general lack of racial diversity. There are younger people, there are older people... but... uh, I'll be blunt - it's really white. Readers of this review, whoever you are, you will enjoy Rockwood, so go patronize this place and help them mix it up!",10

A friend of a friend was performing there, and I was excited to see her in action.  Immediately upon arriving, I went to the bathroom to straighten myself up and to powder my nose (a girl has gotta look cute, after all). The thing I instantly noticed was that the bathroom light was sooooo dim so the room appeared really gothy and dark. I could barely see myself in the mirror, and I really had to look down on the floor so as to make sure I did not step on anything unfamiliar. That was really uncomfortable. Might want to use a flashlight when you're in there. After the bathroom, I went to a downstairs room for the performance. There was a $10.00 drink minimum for each person, which was kind of annoying because I wasn't really thirsty and I did not feel like drinking. All in all, I had a good time, mainly because my friend performed. The vibe of the room was cool but really cramped and small. There were several people blocking my view for minutes at a time because there were not enough seats in the establishment (apparently they sold more tickets to the show than there were seats). I will probably not be back at the place for a while unless they have a happy hour special.",6

One of them is much bigger than the other one (I think it's 1, but I can't remember) but they're both equally great for performers. 3 is a bit of a different story. It seems to be for the overflow from 1 and 2 as well as a dowstairs stage that's for a quieter more acoustic performer. I went to it last night and it was in a sound proof room in the basement. There was only light on stage and tables with a candle to set the mood. It was quite different from the other - much more zen (I guess) and not much bar. They did have a server that came around and took orders which was nice. It saved us from disrupting the performer and from walking up and down stairs repeatedly. All in all I really like Rockwood music hall and for all my musician, band playing friends out there - you should definitely book your next gig here :] Enjoy!",6

The stage can fit a full band and is raised a little which makes it good for you to see above more taller individuals. I have always experienced a great vibe from the band and audience alike.The staff are pretty efficient. They come outside the bar to take orders and will deliver you your beer.

112,1,11/14/2012,287,1,"Astoria, NY",Puja P.,79,5.0,124,"Someone here has a great ear for sound, so consequently the venue regularly hosts fantastic live music.  Don't expect the specific artist you came to see (if you came for a particular person/band/group) to do encores beyond the hour they were allotted.  Each night's schedule is booked back-to-back, so performers can only do encores if their prepared set is over early.Stage 1 is teeny tiny.  That paranoia you're blocking someone's line of vision is not all in your head, because you are totally in the way, unless your alternate form  is miniature and collapsible.  Stage 2 is perhaps double the size of S1, but still provides an intimate experience with a little more room to breathe.For the free shows, there's a 1-drink minimum/set (an hour), but so worth it.  The drinks don't have to be alcoholic, and virgin drinks start at $3.  Great ginger ale (seriously, please try it!).  Waiters/waitresses are ready when you are, and are very good about keeping orders straight and getting them out promptly, making it easy to buy drinks for others or the performers if you wish.  One weird thing I was asked once: ""Do you want to take the drinks over [to the performers] yourself?""  Uh, definitely not.  That's creepy, as well as the difference between, ""Cool set, guys, thanks for a great show!"" and ""I promise I didn't slip anything into these drinks...but drink up, would you?""Oh, and if you plan to stand outside for any reason, you must stand behind the rope, smushed up against the building with your friends and strangers, smokers and non- alike.  This might include the percussionist for (and filterless brother of) the performer you went to see (Marc Scibilia), and having to explain to him that you were not brandishing awkward sanitary products out and about on the streets of Lower Manhattan.  As it goes....The behind-the-ropes restriction probably has something to do with legal issues/sidewalk hazards/etc. because the bouncer was very concerned about this.  I don't know.",1

A different band goes on every hour, and there is no cover charge which is amazing in itself.  We got there around 10, which seemed to be perfect because it got pretty crowded after we settled down.  You could dance downstairs or if you're lucky find a stool on the yore balcony an watch the band from there.  Nice to see a bunch of bands and not have to pay 15 dollars to get in.Very fun and beers only cost us 5-7 dollars each.",8

I saw her initially at Postscript Coffeehouse and ever since, I have been stalking her on FB and whanot. I'm kidding. I came tonight for a 9pm show and I love this space. I have a thing for wooden floors. I don't know what it is, but I love them. Immediately, I get this visceral action of wanting to lay right across the floor and rub my fee on the wooden slats. Sigh. I know. I have issues. The space is extremely cozy and when we arrived, it was extremely packed. All the tables close to the stage were filled and actually I find this a poor use of space. If you're having live performance, all the space should be standing except for maybe a few stools on the periphery. That's just my personal preference. There is also a second floor and you can see the people sitting on the second floor, it was like a balcony space. Next time, I want to sit up on the second floor. I must say that the acoustics here were excellent, can't say the same for Mercury Lounge which is close by. I could actually hear the vocalists clearly and the percussionists were not drowning out their lead singers. Once again, Margaret was phenomenal. When she did the cover of Lauren Hill's Ex-factor, my eyes got really watery and I had to really fight back the tears. Once again, she managed to pull at my heart strings!I love this venue and will be back for future shows. It also helps that this place is FREE admission but with a one drink minimum.

It was my first time witnessing this so I was pretty excited and they were really good too.  They sang in Spanish mostly so I had no idea what they were singing about, but who cares..it's all about instrumental! Shows are free, but there is a one drink limit per band I believe and there are waitresses that goes around to take orders or you can order at the bar.      Both Alecia Chakour and the Mariachi band in one night made me believer that this venue has good taste for who they book, so I will be back for more.",4

First and foremost the music is amazing and always has been. This is mainly why I still give two stars. What makes me sad is the changes in how the place is run. They've recently implemented a policy in which you have to pay at the door in cash even though they accept cards at the bar. I bought a ticket online to see a band I really like right after work. I arrived and was told I had to pay a cash drink minimum up front. I'm okay with the minimum, they've always had it. But I paid for my tickets and had to run around to look for an ATM before they'd let me in. Then to sit up top pay separately again. Then the waitress bothers you every 5 minutes while you're trying to enjoy the music with a full drink. Bring back the old Rockwood. The music is great but the experience has really gone downhill and is distracting to enjoying what I've always come here for: great music.",2

Great close atmosphere with great energy, everyone was happy to be there and be alive. Walking in and hearing some fantastic music and talent is super casual.Tonight I heard the tail end of Miwa Gemini, listened to Jessy Tomsko's whole set, and heard the tail end of Woodbine Falls. I got a rosé for $10, which helped direct the vibe even more. The entire time, I just felt like I was in this warm place with passionate people who are just there to enjoy. My two friends loved it too. No doubt about it, Rockwood has a knack for booking talent. And, incredibly, it attracted people of all ages.

The sound guys who work the shows are true professionals and talented at their craft. They also have an on-site piano that is raised up during shows that don't need one.

Came here for the first time last Friday and I can't wait to come back:- super easy to get to: it's right across the street from the F subway 2nd Ave stop- there's 3 stages: stage 1 is free, stage 2 is usually free but sometimes might have paid shows, and stage 3 are paid shows only. their website tells you who is playing on each stage everyday for the next two months- stage 1 and 2 are easily accessible from the street, all you have to do is show your ID to the bouncer and get a hand stamp which allows you to hop between the two stages. the bands are literally playing right in front of you when you walk in, you can even see the bands playing through the street window. we went back and forth between the two stages throughout the night and people walk in and out through sets as well so don't feel bad if you come in during the middle of someone playing- really intimate setting and surprisingly good sound for such a small venue. in stage 1 even if you are standing at the furthest part of the room you are probably less than 15 feet away from the stage. stage 2 is bigger and they also have a second level- drinks are not expensive: we got hoegaadens for $7 a pop, not bad considering we didn't have to pay cover- while there is no cover, on the night that we came the waitress came around with a bucket for tips for the band which we happily contributed to. not sure if that happens all the time since i've only been once- good crowd with a lot of diversity, probably mid 20s and upwards to people in their 50sOverall just a great place to listen to live music with no fuss",1

It was a last minute decision to go and it was a Sunday so I was really hoping to have a good experience. It was BEYOND. The tickets were $15 which is pretty standard. Usually with these live music events you can't even see the acts it's so crowded. This venue is intimate AND it wasn't too crowded. I couldn't believe that I could actually SEE the show. The waitresses are also very attentive. They make sure your drink is full throughout the show. The price for drinks (beer)? $6-$7 but that's expected for something like this.

Each room was designed and tuned by master acoustician John Storyk. I've heard that the owner Ken Rockwood is also a musician and it makes sense.

Have been craving and been on the hunt for live music lately but spring/summer weddings and other expenses are keeping me from splurging on concerts so Rockwood is a great fix! I've been in the city for a good 4 years now and never heard about this place until the end of last year. I feel ashamed because I consider myself to be at least somewhat knowledgeable about the must see places in this city, but having visited Rockwood for the first time a few weeks ago I feel like I've been living under a rock. Anyway cheers to this discovery. You have two options here where you can either go to the stage with no cover or pay just a little bit for the other stage to see (I'm assuming) a more seasoned band. Every day they have bands playing all day and the entire schedule is up on the site. We saw 3 bands that night on the stage with no cover and they were all great. The venue is a bit small so not ideal for big groups. Also all the staff are so chill. The doorman asked me if I was 21 to which I replied ""of course!"" As I proceeded to pull out my ID he stopped me and said ""alright don't worry about it you got the asian persuAsian"". Hah. I'll definitely be back to hear an act on the other stage and it's nice to know I can get my live music fix without breaking the bank any night I want. Highly recommend!",1

Free of charge. They have a happy hour 2 for one special too. Friday and Saturday nights get extremely crowded, but the energy in the room permeates the walls, and enters your body making you dance like no ones watching. I promise you won't leave the place without falling in love with a new band- as I said before, It's all about the music.It's the only venue for live music in the city with no cover, so the drink prices are really of no importance to me. It's the only place in my favorite city where you can hear live folk, rock, bluegrass, indie, and punk in one night, without having to leave your seat.  Get there early if you feel the need for a seat though, the tables come and go in minutes.

In addition, there is no cover- which is awesome.Also, I am a sucker for cool indie bands/guitarist (my favorite), and this place always seems to have a decent line up.

We went back Saturday night and it was like night and day.  We started off in stage 2 to see Robbie Gill who was awesome.  It was pretty crowded and hard to get to the bar so we decided to just wait til after the show and check out stage 3.  (This place has a lot of rooms.)  Stage 3 is a giant beautiful room that could be an awesome after show hang out, except the bartender was beyond awful.  So rude.   My friend ordered a Manhattan, she looked at us with a blank stare and just turned around.  She then proceeded to SHAKE the Manhattan.  I was a bartender for a long time, how do you not know that you're not suppose to shake a Manhattan?!  The poor girl clearly couldn't handle the whole bar, she looked flustered and I never saw her crack a smile the entire time we were there.   It was disappointing after having such a great experience in the smaller rooms to have such an awful experience in the larger ones.",2

I like that, for the most part, you can come in and watch talented musicians perform for free. It's balanced out by the fact that you're paying NYC prices for your drinks. Stage 1 is the smaller of the two stages but still sounds good. They get a lot of very small, very talented independent acts in there. Stage 2 is one of my favorite rooms in the city. It's loud and electric and beautiful. Both the bars (these are completely different rooms and separate from the bars in each of the stages) are pretty comfortable, well lit and have a friendly staff.

My first foray to Rockwood brought me a similar sense of thrill and enjoyment of a large concert hall but on an obviously much smaller and more intimate scale. A few weeks back, I went to see an amazing up-and-coming artist, Dan Torres (check him out!), perform his one-man show and it blew me away. Notwithstanding his smooth and lush, soulful vocals, but the acoustics here are outstanding! Rockwood has sparse seating, and standing room is tight as well, but if you can literally squeeze in during a gig, you'll soon find it monumentally worth it, even if your toes get unintentionally stepped on a few times. Heads up to the ladies.. it's really unadvised to come here with bags and bags of shopping. There's a huge chance that your goodies will get trampled on. Leave the retail therapy for another day. Last note, the floating bartender is as amiable as one could imagine, and you don't feel at all as if she's working for her tip.

Squeezed myself onto the balcony and watched the band before her while I settled in with a Stella from the tap. Because there are so many bands seats become available if you're vigilant and I managed to nab a seat for the performance. Incredible sound system, great vibe from the crowd. No cover,one drink minimum which is very doable and allows for a tip for the band when they come around with the tip jar.And the area is hopping so when you need to satisfy the drunchies you have lots of options.",3

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we walked into this gem down town. The band we jammed to was awesome! We will definitely be back!",1
187,1,5/17/2010,110,,"New York, NY",Linda W.,138,4.0,491,"I attended one of my favorite singer & songwriter, Juliana Riccardi's show back in April. She remain one of my contacts as an independent artist/band (increasingly popular as she's rising to stardom) for weddings and live events. I'm very happy & excited for her! As an upcoming artist, she is putting up more live performances and shows for her fans. Her folksy and sultry voice is what sets most artists apart. Whether it's a cover of a song or her own music, her talented voice is very distinctive from other musicians. She always add her own twist to acoustic, pop, instrumental, and various genre to songs. In addition, her band is formed through a close knit group of New York artists and musicians. I was very excited to watch her perform some amazing vocals and original tracks that is rare compared to other shows. If you have a deep appreciation for indie or folk and jazz music, look no further, Juliana Riccardi is the new comer to watch out for! Listen to some of her preview tracks on: julianariccardi.com/liveI love the intimate setting of Rockwood Music Hall. It's small and tiny compared to Bowery Ballroom. It's a great place to discover an underground community of talented musicians. This is the music venue to find local or upcoming artists. I'm not big on the social scene (drinking or chatting, not recommended for this venue) especially when I'm listening to live music. Once the music starts, I drown everything out. ;) I love attending small performances and shows. The room was just perfect for witnessing a live performance and a great show! I'm looking forward to more of her upcoming performances. Her show was a big hit that night!",1
188,2,3/26/2012,39,1,"Voorhees Township, NJ",Daniel C.,41,4.0,373,"Saw The Vespers  thevespersband.com  here on a Saturday night. They were in a word, awesome! Shameless plug. The crowd is a noisy one, and if you stand in the back, it will be hard to hear the music. 25% of the crowd is there to drink and talk and the performer is just background music for them. We did get one of the few tables in front. A cosmo and a glass of wine were $20 before tip.The waitress was careful not to interrupt us during a song.  The lighting on the band is so-so, but the acoustics were great. The intimate environment is great as you are really up close and personal with the artists.The crowd consists of mostly younger folks..my wife and I were surely the oldest people in the house!",1
189,1,10/20/2011,10,2,"Chicago, IL",K S.,0,2.0,52,"I traveled from Chicago for a show and I found the venue to be just ""okay"".  It was very cozy/small, but I was early enough to get a decent seat.  The show that I attended did have a cover/ticket price.  I was surprised to hear of the 1 drink minimum upon coming in, since that was not indicated on the website when I purchased the ticket.  When I hesitated to order, the waitress suggested that I get a non-alcoholic beverage, so I asked for a bottle of water.  She took my card and THEN she said I had to spend at least $10, so she could run my card for $10 for the $3 water, or I could buy 4 bottles to meet the minimum.  After paying a cover to enter, I find that to be utterly ridiculous.  The sound was good, the band sounded great, but with so many acts on the line-up, we had to clear out of the venue immediately after the show and go elsewhere.",4
190,,11/22/2014,43,,"ASTORIA, NY",Jamie S.,8,4.0,37,"Love Rockwood Music Hall. Another one of my favorite Lower East Side live music haunts. I've seen shows both upstairs and downstairs (Rockwood 3) as well as just popping by for a late night drink. It's a great space for all of the above! Prices are reasonable, good views of the stage are plentiful and the staff is friendly. If you're seeing a show upstairs, keep in mind that they have servers making their way through the crowd taking orders. Sometimes, when the server is nowhere to be found, it's just easier to go to the bar. No problem. Definitely a great space for live music.",
191,,6/10/2014,5,1,"Sunset Park, NY",Yuxin G.,8,4.0,8,I went there on the communion day which holds every first tuesday from September to June. There are some pretty good band in various genre. And it is easy to switch from one stage to another. You always can find the one fits you. Stage 3 is more like a jazz bar and best with jazz or folk music. Stage 1 and 2 is like multiple uses.,1
192,5,9/4/2013,22,7,"Jersey City, NJ",Tim H.,26,2.0,72,"I have been to Rockwood Music Hall twice now, to see a friend's band play. Both times were on a Saturday in the afternoon, which I saw as an amazing excuse to day drink in NYC. My first visit, we arrived at 3:15 when my friend's band went on at 3 on the small stage to the left. We could barely get in the door, and could not get a drink until the break between shows. Once the set was over, there was about a 15 minute intermission and people began to move around so we were able to get a few drinks for the next show, and post up closer to the bar for the next performance.On my second visit, my two friends and I wanted to avoid the congestion of last time, so we arrived at 2:30pm, 30 minutes before the first opening set. We sat at the bar, made friends with the bartender and enjoyed bloody mary's, and a few organic IPAs on tap throughout the show. The bartender was a nice girl, but she did have a little bit of the ""hipster/holier than thou"" thing going on. We really enjoyed the show, and our day drinks and once the show was over, we began to make plans for where to go next and pay our tabs.This is when it got uncomfortable:We each had four rounds of drinks on separate tabs which totaled around $35 per person. I had left a $5 tip (over $1 per drink) as did my friends and grabbed my jacket, when the bartender leaned over the bar and said to me ""was the service not up to standard?"". I was very confused, thought a minute then stated that I gave her $5 for 4 drinks. She told me that I should have tipped 20% if the service was satisfactory!!! I smiled and walked away literally shocked. I don't care if you are are pouring gold out of the beer tap, and it costs $1,000 per pint, I'm still going to tip you $1-2 a round... I'm happy to tip 20% when I'm eating a meal, but I'm sorry hun your pulling a handle and dispensing beer into a glass, I think your being compensated adequately. It's not my fault you splurged for the Williamsburg loft on your bartender salary and your having trouble making ends meet, so please don't take it out on me. We left, and waited outside for the rest of our group while the bartender stared at us through the window. I will continue to tip a bartender $1-2 per drink regardless of where I am because the price of the drink does not effect the time it takes to make it! Overall, I wish I could give Rockwood 4 stars, but because of the demanding bartender, it will have to stay at 2 stars for now.",3
193,6,8/5/2009,719,7,"Brooklyn, NY",Rachel A.,1720,5.0,1501,"(Picture me with a megaphone.) Attention all music lovers!! Live music at Rockwood starts at 3!!!!I usually wait until 10 PM for music at the little venues. Now that I know Rockwood Music Hall hosts artists starting at 3, I can start my day early and enjoy bands/singer-songwriters from afternoon till night. Rockwood is an unassuming spot in the Lower East Side. If you don't have the address handy you may just walk right past it.Before I divulge into the acts, there are a few tokens I'd like to mention about Rockwood that made it stellar.1) The bathroom. I get really excited during concerts. And just like a dog overcome with excitement, sometimes I have to pee. I really love live music and hate to miss any part of the show. Thus I wait until it's over to use the loo. In this case at Rockwood, I decided on a quick bathroom break only to avoid a massive line at the end of the show. There is one unisex bathroom at Rockwood for however many people they could pack in there. It's not a lot of people but it's enough to build a long line if everyone decided to use the bathroom at the same time.Luckily, I didn't miss anything. The bathroom was in the corner and close enough to the stage that you can still hear the music, if not better, through the closed door. Thumbs up for the acoustics at Rockwood Music Hall. I may not have seen the artist but I didn't miss a beat.2) The curtains. If you're not lucky enough to get a seat, you stand. I was standing with my friend against the window when she started to complain that it was hot. I didn't feel like moving so I ignored her. (Yes, I am a bad friend.) She started to tug at the curtains to shield herself from the sun and the bartender took notice. He drew the curtains and voila! Instant mood lighting and shade!3) The bartender. He's awesome. There was one of him and probably 40 of us. He went up to each and every one of us for drinks and even fetched napkins when we asked. Give this guy a tip.4) The treehouse. Treehouse? Well not really but I like to call it that. It's where the sound and light guy hangs out. He climbs a ladder and gives the stage special effects. From time to time you will see him swing his legs as he hangs from the treehouse.And back to the artists. Rockwood Music Hall is a wonderful spot to support your local artists and enjoy a show. I went to Rockwood for the Run Jax Run Benefit. Jax rounded up a few of very talented musician friends, one of them being OG Yelp's very own Drew B! Check out Rockwood's little bar area next door as well. The fun just never stops at Rockwood and rumor has it that a few really famous ones grace the stage from time to time.",8
194,1,9/21/2012,90,,"Fort Bragg, NC",Albert O.,3,5.0,17,"A friend and I randomly stumbled across this bar looking to catch some live music, and were absolutely blown away. This is by far and away the best spot to watch up and coming NYC talent with a beer in your hand. Though the staff is limited, they do a great job of making you feel important -- extremely friendly and attentive.I would only recommend coming here if you are coming to appreciate the music -- it's a very small room, and if you try and engage in a loud conversation with your friend about how awesome the place is, you may quickly be hushed by fellow members in the audience. It is less a place for socializing and more for watching and listening.Definitely try and get there early as the place can get crowded very quickly!",

Updated review",753,,"Boulder, CO",Melanie Rose P.,22,5.0,193,"It's been 4 years since I started frequenting Rockwood, and boy has it turned frequent. Between the local artists I've become fans of, musician friends I love to support, surprise big name shows, and the fact that there's a variety of good music literally all night, every-single-night...it's turned into my go-to, absolute favorite place in the city. As for stage 1 vs 2: The sound at stage 2 is the best I've heard in NYC, but I prefer the energy and feel of stage 1.Drop in and see for yourself. Bounce between the 2 stages - you're bound to hear something your ears like.",4

199,,1/17/2016,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ahmed S.,0,2.0,3,"This place has great music all the time, I'm very regular at stage 1 & 2 and always go there for beers and live music. However, yesterday we went to the bar at the back, above stage 3. First I order a Jameson on the rocks and the bartender charge me $13 for a drink, then a I order a non alcoholic ginger ale for my pregnant wife and she charged me $6 for it. In my opinion the place is not that fancy for these prices, I don't understand why the prices are so high at the back bar. I give its 2 stars for the good music.",
