Updated review","I stopped by again for a sit down experience.  There was plenty of space for diners on a early Sunday afternoon, and I grabbed one of their summer menu items, the breakfast burrito, to try.  The interior remained relatively quiet but busy throughout our stay, which maintained the perfect balance between ""too noisy to work"" and ""so quiet it's awkward."" As per other Yelp reviewers, I did witness one patron get asked to move to the ""laptop only"" section, which despite the ""inconvenience"" to the laptop customer, really does facilitate conversation and engagement at the non-laptop tables.  The burrito itself was quite delicious, though decidedly different that a standard breakfast burrito of a traditionally Mexican bent.   While this burrito did in fact come in a tortilla, and with guacamole, this is where the clear Mexican similarities ended.  The pineapple salsa added a burst of freshness to the somewhat oily nduja (an Italian spicy pork spread that truly did add an appreciable spice to the burrito).  The patatas bravas weren't readily identifiable, and the included herbs added another layer of unique flavor to the burrito.  The eggs were not overcooked or dry, thankfully.  At $12.50, it is on the more expensive side of breakfast item, but it is certainly filling and the quality does not disappoint.  My one somewhat curious observation is that it is clear those at Black Fox can cook, and it is clear that offering food seems to be a goal of the shop.  The kitchen, however, seems very small, or lacking in equipment, to really unleash the cooking potential at Black Fox.  Perhaps this is an effort to keep it more coffee shop than brunch location, which I can't quibble with, but I'd love to see the cooking potential released at some point.  Regardless, thanks again for another great experience Black Fox!",1,,1
1,Puxan B.,"Trocadéro/Iéna, Paris, France",40,53,241,4.0,10/31/2018,"Near the financial district and not far from Chinatown, this Coffeeshop offers a variety of black coffees (drip, espresso, latte, vegan options) as well as pastries, breakfast food, salads and even Spanish omelettes (tortilla). Great spot for a quick bite, breakfast or just a coffee. Friendly staff too!",,,
2,Alex S.,"New York, NY",657,16,70,4.0,10/28/2018,"Strong coffee, good service & food is excellent. The only issue is their prices. I guess $5 cold brew is the norm now but I don't enjoy spending the same amount on my coffee as my entire breakfast. Not to mention their BEC is about $13 bucks.... coffee is bomb though so I keep coming back. Doesn't hurt that it's in my building, on my way out to the office haha. Other then price I have no complaints, true 4*! Oh yea some of their ""specialty"" coffee and espresso blend drinks are upwards of $8. Take into account before arriving.(Purely my opinion but the steak sandwich is the home run, not sure how they pump it out as the kitchen is very tiny but in my opinion it's the best bang for your buck here)",,,
3,Sumire M.,"New York, NY",2,29,3,3.0,9/17/2018,"Too expensive for a latteThere is an overly enthusiastic, overbearing male barista that is kind of off-putting every time I interacted w/ himHe talks when the customer doesn't want to talk and provokes when the customer doesn't want his unpleasant banter. It made me wonder - does he actually like his job? That, on top of the expensive latte, makes this Australian not run for the moneyBreakfast egg sandwich on a Saturday morning with a pot of tea here can be an occasional splurge",4,1,
4,Helen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,438,1260,2.0,8/2/2018,"The cup of coffee is see-through, not a good sign. It's indeed as weak as I thought it'd be based on the translucent liquid. The cold brew is slightly better with maybe two shades darker brown compared to the drip. It also was a smidgen better in flavor, definitely less acidic than some coffee shops found across the boroughs. Flat white was better than anything we ordered so that's a plus. They had to close early due to a staff meeting, which is rather odd to do but it's their turf so fiiiiiine. Place wasn't selling good coffee anyway so it wasn't tragic that we had to leave. What is tragic is the brew. Basically I was lead down this path in search of an excellent cup of coffee, but alas, I was lead down with lies.",4,1,
5,Rachael M.,"Narberth, PA",2,40,1,2.0,11/13/2018,"A latte with almond milk costs $6.53 without tip - they charge $1.25 for nondairy milk which is absurdly expensive, and the drink wasn't very good. Very overpriced for a medium quality coffee. I won't be returning.",1,,
6,Demi H.,"New York, NY",6,69,52,3.0,10/5/2018,"Cute little spot! Great vibes, very comfortable and the baristas are very kind. The coffee though is awfully expensive, I had their ""epic"" cold brew which was 5 and change. Pushing it for me. They also don't have WiFi which is a big factor for me - I like to go to coffee shops and get some work done. There's other great spots around Fidi so I dont think I'll be back. Ambiance and service is 5 stars, but the price and WiFi issue forces me to bring it down to three. I'm very happy I came here to check it out though!",1,,1
7,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",103,125,32,4.0,8/20/2018,"The ambiance of this place along with the decor is one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. The staff is friendly and the coffee is high quality. It can get really freaking busy and crowded inside due to the neighborhood and the proximity of its location to the Wall Street 2/3 subway exit. I love the Acadia (sp?) pastry here. Absolutely to die for, like a croissant fell in love with a hazelnut granola bar. It can be a little pricey -- but that's FiDi for you. You can only work on your laptop at the tiny counter up at the front by the window, which I think has 6 seats which can fill up fast. So if you are looking for a place to work for a while, be aware you may not find a seat here. But definitely worth checking out! Can't wait to head here for a weekend brunch--'cause the menu looks lit.",,,

It was very crowded and loud, so definitely not a good place to work anyways, not even for half an hour. Kitchen was already closed at 3:15pm.This could be such a cool spot, I really liked the interior design, but definitely overpriced, plus you'll get a weird look when not adding any tip.",2,1,

I did not know they would charge so much, let alone charge at all!  ($5.75 for cappuccino with almond milk....) Pastries slightly over priced. Cute place, nice decor. Just that options are limited at 10am on Sunday in this area, and thus, sometimes very crowdedIt's a 3.5 for me, but I'll be generous, since they are generally nice here.",3,1,
11,Sabrina P.,"New York, NY",29,41,4,4.0,8/31/2018,"I really love this place for all reasons mentioned but it's more like $$$ - this is inaccurate! Don't get me wrong though, the quality of the food is great.The only part really I'm bummed about is the WiFi. A place that can charge prices like these should not cheap out on telling guests to use the attached building's WiFi which 75% of the time is so shoddy anyway.WiFi may be a minor factor elsewhere...but for a nice coffee shop I'd say it's kind of a big deal.",2,,1
12,Luke B.,"New York, NY",275,317,1942,5.0,1/10/2018,"Excellent coffee, true to good Australian form.  Order a flat white or a late from here and you'd be forgiven for thinking you where in Fitzroy Melbourne.  Fair crack of the whip!My simple order of a long black was consistent in form.

13,Noel E.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,1,0,3.0,11/15/2018,"Really good food, cool atmosphere but the price rating is VERY misleading. Has one dollar sign indicating low cost but I paid $15 for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich........I usually pay $3",,,

The ambiance is beautiful and the music is perfect for relaxing or getting some work done.The coffee? Amazing. Everything from cold brew, drip coffee (Americano), and espresso beverages (cappuccino) are extremely high quality.They serve some good looking pastries and Underwest doughnuts. I also tried a slice of the Spanish tortilla, which was pricey but delicious.The service is awesome too. The staff is super friendly and if you decide to stay your coffee is brought to you with sleek presentation.I think this is one of the best coffee shops in FiDi!",,,
15,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,4.0,9/11/2017,"Black Fox Coffee makes a good pot of coffee, and it better be at $3.50 for a small.The exquisite Art Deco building at 70 Pine provides a backdrop fit for a high powered film noir meeting over hushed tones with hell bent urgency, and that'll be exactly how you'll feel with all the Wall St pretension of working lap toppers.  It's a scene, and you can be apart of it at the cost of $8 for a breakfast sandwich or $4 for a muffin, think of it as a built in cover charge or the subtle wrath of fire from a voluptuous femmes fatale.From a misty shadow -""You might be asking me why I asked you here.""",10,4,10
16,Angelina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",209,9,10,5.0,6/2/2018,"This is my favorite Fidi coffee joint. Lots of delicious drink options like fresh sodas, Date lattes, malted hot chocolates. They always have amazing baked goods, but I think the absolute best thing they have is the almond croissant- I've never had one better, anywhere. They also serve a fire breakfast, I highly recommend the avocado toast with bacon, eggs, and chili oil. It's amazing. There's also mad seating and has a buzzing vibe that's never too loud, so it's great to do a quick coffee meeting or get some work done",1,,
17,Nataliya M.,"Brooklyn, NY",282,69,300,4.0,5/12/2018,"Black Fox Coffee is a perfect breakfast or coffee break option for those working on Wall Street. I stopped in here for an iced Americano and a breakfast sandwich before starting my work day and was not disappointed. The seating area was surprisingly crowded for an early morning, but there were still plenty of seats open. I opted out for grabbing a window seat and watched people hurry by outside as I enjoyed my sandwich. The croissant was flaky and perfectly toasted, while the sharp cheddar and ham added just the right amount of flavor. After sneaking in a quick chapter of my book as I finished my coffee, I felt relaxed and ready to start my work day. Overall, very nice experience.",,,
18,Ruby C.,"Manhattan, NY",15,113,1524,4.0,2/1/2018,"Stopped by twice for lunch with my sister and I really enjoyed this place. The only down side would be that the prices are a bit high, but since I don't work in the FiDi area, I can't afford to be having lunch here all the time. But it is a nice spot to stop by once in a while, EXCEPT during lunch time on weekdays because I notice it does get quite packed. The first time I came here, I got the avocado toast, sweet potato toast, orange salad, and a nitrogen cold brew. The coffee was first to come and I mainly ordered it for my sister since I am not a big coffee drinker, but this was really good. It was super smooth and I can totally see myself drinking this without milk or sugar. (which i usually need when it comes to coffee.) The rest of the food slowly came one at a time. The orange salad wasn't really our thing, but it was still tasty. It was pricey for what it was. It wasn't really filling, but it had buttermilk with sliced oranges and pumpkin seeds. It was also drizzled with a bit of olive oil. The toast were really good, but the best one was the sweet potato toast. It was sweet, savory, and a little tangy. If I remember correctly, it had chunks of sweet potato topped with some ricotta, parmesan, capers and drizzled with some honey. I honestly wish I didn't share the toast with my sister haha. As for the avocado toast, there was not as much of a wow factor but it was still good. The toast had sliced avocados with pickled jalapenos, hard boiled egg and smoked paprika-lime vinagrette. It wasn't as flavorful as the sweet potato one, but still tasty. I also stopped by another time for lunch again. They were doing a promotion so they had $2 flat whites and a free brownie with it so I grabbed that deal along with a Shrimp Roll. When I read shrimp roll, I was thinking the rolls you get at Luke's lobster but theirs were on a toasted brioche bun I think. There were also a lot of shrimp in the sandwich which made each bite super satisfying. The bun was also toasted and super flaky. For $16, it is pricey, but then they also did put a good amount of shrimp in it. As for the flat white, it was good, but since I'm not a coffee expert, I can't really judge for that. The brownie on the other hand was amazing, especially paired with the coffee. My sister was the one who told me that I should definitely get them when I was about to pass. Even though it was a small brownie, it was rich and decadent. The top looked like a bar of chocolate while the bottom had a cake like texture. When you eat it though, it's on the denser side, but it melts in your mouth compared to the texture of regular brownies. It is sweet, but with coffee, it's a perfect match. I do really like the food and drinks here, but my only thing is that it is pricey and it does get packed so if you want a nice quiet spot to chat or do work. Other than that I would probably come back, but probably off peak hours.",3,,2
19,Samantha P.,"New York, NY",0,21,5,1.0,6/11/2018,"Soy chai is good but apparently medical service animals are not welcome here so if you have a disability or disabling medical condition requiring you to have a service animal, best to go elsewhere. Shout out to the barista who made me feel like my disability was a huge inconvenience for them. Didn't even get to finish my second drink because I just felt unwelcome and wanted to leave after that. Good times.UPDATE in response to Daniel: Wow thanks so much for explaining all that! Lol. The thing is my dog is a seizure dog, he detects impending seizures for my safety. As such he is a service dog and NOT an emotional support animal. I tried explaining that to you in person when you kicked me out, but you were too busy telling me about all your years of experience in the food industry and how you know the laws regarding service animals. Whatever, man...I just really don't have the patience to deal with ppl like you. Also, Cafe Grumpy has way better chai lattes than you guys.",2,2,1

Then my food came out and all was forgiven. The breakfast burrito with potatoes inside and diced green pineapple salsa...I would move to the city just for that! Then the epic cold brew coffee came out in this mason jar and jolted me back to life after a long night in the city!I am forever grateful to Black Fox for allowing me to start my Friday on the highest of notes.

I ordered an almond cappuccino & chocolate chip cookie (served warm). The coffee was very good. I love the design in the cup (so purty ;)). The cookie was really good- soft, thick, warm & gewy chocolate. I couldn't eat the whole thing myself! No worries there because my bestie jumped right in to help me out! The service was good. Very classy & simple contemporary decor. Probably one of the coffee spots with more seating, but not large by any means. I would recommend & return.",1,,2

Each time I've come, I've received both my food and drink easily within 5-8 minutes, no matter how busy they've been. The food is solid, especially considering how small of a preparation area they have. The mood is calm and quiet yet facilitates whatever activity you've come for. Their employees are accommodating and considerate. I was pleasantly surprised when I came in with my 10month of daughter and one of their employees, Chili, brought her a small empty cup to play with. So thoughtful! Their house made nut milk latte is a bit pricey, but always good!",,,

Baristas are so professional and I really appreciate that because they respect the art of making coffee, they're passionate, extremely knowledgeable and work so, so hard. Try out different things, they love to try new menu items and they always have the best recommendations! Really passionate and creative atmosphere. BEST place to start your dayP.S they have lots of milk alternatives and GF pastries :)))Pro Tip: if it's crowded on a day you try it out or if you're ever in a rush, order before through the  ""RITUAL"" app. But I'd still recommend dining-in one day because their interior design and flowers are phenomenal.

One of the best I had when I was visiting New York for work. I really enjoyed their food, too. My only criticism is that it is expensive. It also is not a place to work, since it is relatively small. They even have signs up that request that if you are working on a laptop, to sit at the stools by the window instead of a table. If you want to grab coffee and sit down briefly with a friend, this is the perfect place.",,,
32,Michele S.,"PECK SLIP, NY",3,18,2,4.0,3/11/2018,"Delicious beverages and food. People need to realize that they are not Starbucks and they are not a library. A lot of the negativity seems to be from people who want to sit with laptops for hours and this is not that kind of place. They have a few spots that are open for laptop use - specifically the bar that faces the street. This makes sense since those are not ideal seats for sitting and talking to someone you are with over brunch/coffee anyway. If these spots are all taken, sorry you need to find somewhere else to take your laptop or patiently wait for a spot to open. Personally, I rarely go here to sit and work I go for the delicious menu items.And a few times I that I have gone in to work I have always found that as long as I am respectful of the establishment's rules they are happy to accommodate me. By the way- this place is literally across the street from the atrium next to Deutsche Bank. Therefore, if you are so desperate for a place to sit with your laptop you can grab your coffee/food to go and cross the street and grab a seat at one of those tables.

Oh well - no baked good for me.I tried the $4.50 drink I just purchased, and yes it had that flavor.... but not my style.  I had to come back to the office and add some milk to mine.  I wouldn't recommend this place.... but maybe it's good for lunch!?  I just don't think i will make my way there to try it again....",3,2,2

You can sit wherever you like and a waiter will come bring your drinks and food to you. The food menu is kind of in an inconvenient place though. It's right behind the counter and when there is a long line you're basically holding up the line. It gets confusing. I would come here every morning to get breakfast/brunch! I love their BEC and their smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and toast.Their BEC is bacon, eggs, cheese with salsa. it's interesting but also delicious!! Their smoked salmon with eggs and toast is delicious as well. These two are my go to's!!Their lattes and flat whites are also bomb! Probably one of the best coffees i've had.

So today I'm more than happy to run here and eventually got a taste of their famous flat white.Probably due to the fact that I was sitting inside rather than grabbing to go, my coffee was really foamy and the latte art well-drawn. The balance was also quite right, that I first discovered a bit of bitterness while left with sweetness afterwards. This special combination completely took charge of my tastebuds and I was left fully convinced. Loved each single sip of it!I would have to make sure that I come back sometime future, just to have a difference experience of their latte, or even espresso. In my opinion, a good coffee shop simply brews coffee; while an outstanding one tries to attach their coffee with emotion. Black fox certainly belongs to the latter and I hope to see more of it!Don't miss this hidden gem if you happen to be in this neighborhood.",14,9,8

The high ceiling, big space, wood interior, and big windows are nice pluses! Barista warmly welcomes you upon entrance. I got an almond flat white to-go (although I would really love to hang out and spend more time here!). I appreciate the fact that baristas spend time making you a nice latte art even though you ordered it to-go! One sip, I can taste passion in it! it is very fruity (citrus taste?), rich, foamy with nice chocolaty/nutty aroma. That was not it... The after taste is sweet, which is similar to how good teas make you feel sweet but not thirsty in the end.Highly recommend this nice coffee shop for coffee lovers/meeting/friends gathering.

The coffee here is good, certainly not the best in New York, but decent enough that I wouldn't mind spending an entire morning here. Another reason to spend a morning here - the food. They have a great selection of breakfast items to suit all appetites, both in terms of pastries to snack on or more savory entrees like avocado toast and egg scrambles. The avocado toast was unique in that they leave the avocado in bite-sized chunks (as opposed to a smooth paste) - it's different but nonetheless delicious. The space is quite big and there is a lot of seating - a great place to relax with a book or a friend.",1,,1

Where was this delectable melt-in-the-mouth croissant all my life, that has totally ruined my morning exercise routine?! (And sans any of that gack fake almond essence that makes me gag every time! Who created that stuff anyway!)I digress. So yes, if you haven't already guessed, I love the spot. Not only is it one of the rare spacious cafes in FiDi, but also has great coffee (flat white yum!), a expansive menu for both baked yumminess and a full meal (love the bagel , avo toast and overnight oats) and very friendly staff (read - staff smiles despite annoying mom bumping people with her stroller in queue and hoping people will hold doors for her..) My only complaint is that the banana bread can do with a little more banana... I have been there 5 times this week, baby in tow. My morning walks have been sabotaged by a map-my-way-to-black-fox.

For a minute I felt like I was back in Seattle, where the coffee is unmatched. This is not a chain starbucks type establishment. The coffee is, however, very expensive for the size, as are the food and pastries. I've only tried the almond croissant so far, and it was absolutely divine. Why minus one star? The first three times I came in, they didn't have any croissants or cookies left. Finally this most recent time I was able to get one. Also, the baristas and the girls at the register are not friendly. A smile or a ""how are you"" would go a long way.UPDATE: Today I went back and my latte was actually a normal size! Before they were giving the lattes in what looked like tiny espresso shot cups. Perhaps they have now fixed this.UPDATE 2: Recently I went in for another coffee and had a casual chat with one of the workers. I mentioned that the chocolate chip cookie I'd had during my last visit was really dry/hard and I wasn't sure that I wanted to try it again. As I was about to depart with coffee in hand the worker ran up to me with a complimentary cookie to make up for my last experience. What great service!",2,1,

I think the lunch options look delicious and hopefully warrant the purchase, if anything just to treat myself one time.I'm a latte drinker so I can't comment on the specific tastes of the coffee, although I am aware they often offer unique beans and roasts often hard to find and very are limited to region and seasonal availability. I enjoy the fact that they have an espresso and coffee offering menu for your choosing despite I don't always understand how that translates into the taste. What ends up happening is that I order a latte but don't know which espresso for it to pull from. The staff should be a bit more receptive of this and eager to offer their suggestion. Their latte was right on point in terms of taste, temperature and texture. Kudos for the added latte art!",,,
97,Frances M.,"Foggy Bottom, Washington, DC",44,2,0,3.0,6/24/2017,"They have great coffee and nice staff. Well, a little pricy. It's Fido. I give it 3 stars bc their scramble egg needs a lot improvement. It was just a lump of Truth is everything related to egg needs improvement.",,,

They change their food menu fairly often (every couple of months) so there's always something new to try. The staff is all super friendly and accommodating. Have visited 20+ times in the area since I live close by. Great addition to FiDi. Would recommend to anyone in the area looking for a great breakfast or a quick coffee.,,,
105,New York City84 W.,"New York, NY",5,38,5,1.0,4/27/2017,"I lived next door for nearly 7 years long before this ""coffee"" shop ever came. The avocado toast is good, sure, but pricey, yes. Stepped in today with my ESA dog I have for seizures and the gentleman turned me away with even a doctors note from someone the next street over. I was literally there yesterday and today going to place the order, step outside and wait for it to come out to respect the fact that its a food establishment. A dog for seizures is not a health code violation. I've brought him anywhere and everywhere you could imagine, even to have medical procedures, and was turned away at a rando coffee shop... laughable. Never going back, sorry not sorry lol",,,

110,Lo B.,"New York, NY",0,14,17,4.0,2/9/2017,"Updated Review: Visit at least several times / wk since my initial review. Service has definitely improved. Not to mention they now know me by name and have since memorized my order . One of my fav coffee spots. Because it is located a block from my apt, never sit in but seems to be a very cool place to work and/or people watch. Uh, when did this spot open? FiDi resident and just finding this hidden gem. I live less than a block from Black Fox. Stumbled upon it by accident while walking Pine. Super bummed I waited so long to find it. First order was a sweetened iced latte and it did not disappoint. Craving another. Starbucks who? While I can never give up my Blue Spoon honey lavender latter, Black Fox is now 1 of my 2 fav local coffee spots. Was eyeing a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on someone's plate earlier today. Definitely giving it a try tomorrow.Update: So I went back today for a sandwich. Too many issues. Ordering a sandwich requires too much time and patience. Over 20 mins for a BEC. First gave me the wrong sandwich. Second, got home only to find no cheese on a Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich!! Clearly some issues in the kitchen. Will stick to drinks from here on out.",1,,1

114,Kevin K.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",31,64,1,5.0,1/19/2017,Awesome shop. I've been a few times and they do the multi roaster model well. Roast beef sandwich was very good too.,1,1,
115,Hannarae N.,"Boston, MA",359,26,3,5.0,2/13/2017,"Expensive but worth it - never knew iced coffee could taste so good before black fox. Their almond croissants are to die for. They have freshly baked chocolate cuip cookies in the afternoon, around 1:30-2pm, which are heavenly. If you are looking for water, dont go here - they only carry the expensive glass bottle type.",1,,
116,Melissa H.,"New York, NY",72,119,53,5.0,11/18/2016,"I cannot say enough good things about this coffee shop! The highlights: convenient to many working in the Financial District, spacious with lots of seating (though not too noisy), super friendly staff, excellent coffee (though don't expect an in-and-out quick experience), and they take credit cards. Cons: only one - no chai latte on the menu, but I'll live. This is my new favorite spot!",4,3,2
117,Ned E.,"Chelmsford, MA",0,7,0,3.0,4/23/2017,"Consistently delicious overnight oats and almond croissants. CC cookies are a real hit or miss. Couple of times they were flat and tasted disgusting (was told they simply did not rise, not that they were actively missing baking soda and sugar). The coffee and tea takes a significant (and unnecessary) amount of time to prepare, and it is too cold 50% of the time for some reason (for the green tea, at least). Also, they never heat your pastries unless you explicitly ask. Its a nice treat once in a while, but tips are not deserved because the inflated prices cover the quality food and the service is consistently poor and very slow.",,,
118,Rachel L.,"New York, NY",21,153,411,4.0,2/15/2017,"This coffee shop within the 70 Pine Street apartment is a little on the pricey side given it's in FiDi, but I do like how spacious the shop is, making it a nice spot to linger in if you'd like to do some work or reading (there are newspapers and magazines for you if you did not bring your own book). You can sit by the window, at the communal table in the middle or the smaller tables by the sides of the café. My first visit, I had the 70 Pine bagel (i.e. bagel and lox with cream cheese, arugula, onions & dill) and a flat white. The second time, I had the almond croissant and an Americano. The 70 Pine bagel was good, but given the price point, I was expecting more lox. The almond croissant was better! I think this is one of the few pastries made in-house, the rest are sourced from other bakeries. I was excited to see that they have some pastries from Arcade Bakery too. Third visit, I had the yogurt with poached pear and blueberries, which made for a great light & healthy start to the morning! This is one of the better coffee places in FiDi, and with the quality of the food offered, I will definitely return again.",,1,

I've never done work here, but there is definitely enough room to find a table and stay for a while (they have ""for here"" mugs for this purpose). It would be a good place to meet a friend for coffee.Coffee:*I've only ever had their iced latte* - the iced latte was amazing! Not bitter at all.Price:A bit pricey, but nothing crazy for the area. Definitely worth it if you care about the quality of your coffee.Food:I haven't tried it yet - but they have a variety of options. There are a few items that would be enough for a full lunch.",2,1,
121,Dana C.,"Chicago, IL",12,42,9,1.0,7/15/2017,"I am sitting here with possibly the worst cup of coffee I have ever had in my life - and that includes the one I got at the truck stop in Kansas where I saw a guy in a ""Keep America White"" t-shirt eat 18 White Castle sliders in under five minutes. Never before have I felt so bitter (much like the taste of this coffee) about wasting six (!!!) dollars on a ""large"" almond milk latte (which is only 12 ounces because everyone knows that anything generous enough to make you happy is against the Hipster Code of Self-Imposed Ironic Deprivation and Ennui). I'd ask for my money back, but I don't think the baristas can hear me, as their heads seem to be inserted very far up into a place where the sun doesn't shine. Apparently instead of asking ""Do you have any cinnamon,"" which merited the blankest stare since Professor Lockhart got his memory wiped, I should have asked ""Do you know when the aliens are coming to wipe this pit of sadness and shame from the face of the earth"" - perhaps that at least may have given me a tiny sip (still probably larger than this coffee) of satisfaction.",1,,

I got on line to order and there were a few people waiting ahead of me. After waiting for a while the line wasn't moving. The cashiers were just standing there talking to each other and not saying anything to the people on line. So one cashier finally looks and me and she softly whispers ""we're closed"".... so I'm like it says your open until 5:30 and she said they were closing early. I have no problem with them closing early, I believe it was a holiday or a day before a holiday, but tell me when I walk inside, don't let me stand on the line for 15 minutes before saying anything. They saw me walk in and didn't say anything, I guess they were too busy chit chatting. The group in front of me were being serviced so I don't understand why she waited so long to say anything. Very disappointed because I really wanted to try the coffee but I will never go here again.",,,

I have no idea what I just ate- the chicken was full of flappy skin and sinew and the whole sandwich was dripping in mayo. Each time I took a bite it just fell apart. There also was a grainy mustard and some sort of green bean concoction on the sandwich- no mention of this on the menu.
