0,,11/12/2018,66,,"Brooklyn, NY",Brandon G.,142,4.0,218,One of the smaller venues I've been to that house Broadway shows. Very clean theatre and prices are on par with all other houses.The seats are a little small. So take advantage of the intermission to stretch your legs. Staff was very friendly and helpful and Waitress was a good show.,
1,2,9/16/2018,549,2,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",Lana L.,3296,4.0,420,"My friend and I saw Waitress here last night. We arrived at around 7:50pm for the 8:00pm showing of Waitress. There was a line down a third of the block, but it moved quite quickly and only took about 5 minutes to get in, then another couple minutes to find our seats. We had orchestra seats (row J). Sound quality was good. The theater was not large and there wasn't much leg room (and this is coming from a tiny person), but it was pretty clean and had a classic look and feel with the red and gold. Bathroom lines during intermission moved quickly.",3
2,1,8/31/2018,0,,"Buffalo, NY",Denise G.,23,4.0,38,No bad seats!!The sound was great; the view perfect.The only negative was the very limited bathroom facilities and difficult concession location.The staff was friendly and helpful.The location of the theatre ... convenient.,1
3,9,8/21/2018,369,2,"Troy, MI",Rebecca A.,214,5.0,142,"I visited this quaint little theater while visiting NYC and saw The Waitress. It was amazing. The acoustics were absolutely stellar! Katherine McPhee's voice gave me chills. I honestly can't say too much about the theater other than the sound quality and the view (we were in the upper mezzanine and could see perfectly) since I didn't use the restrooms or get up and walk around during intermission. I will admit, I was surprised at how small it was when I first walked in, idk I guess I was expecting some giant auditorium. But this was actually the perfect size- it was just small enough to feel intimate and so everyone has a great view.",5
4,3,3/4/2018,419,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jenny T.,220,5.0,86,"Waitress was amazing! The acting was extraordinary, the voices were beautiful, the story was captivating, and there were tons of hilarious scenes.They serve mini pies for $12 each at the entrance of the theater. My lemon pie was delicious, but my sister's salted caramel pie was way too sweet.I recommend using the restroom before arriving at the theater or right when you enter the theater. The line for the female's restroom was about 60 people long. There was no wait for the male's restroom.",5
5,16,12/3/2017,2967,9,"San Francisco, CA",Tiffany D.,7458,4.0,2180,Nice theatre!  Seats are appropriately laid out to see the center stage!  Commendable layout. Typical theatre and classic look. Watched Waitress here and it was a heartfelt show.  I love Broadway musicals.  It's applicable to lessons and journeys in life!Theatre represents the stages in life.,13
6,1,2/1/2018,382,,"Irvine, CA",Kathy T.,879,4.0,296,"This theatre is definitely small, but I think that allows for most of the seats to have a decent view not too far from the stage. I arrived around 6:30pm for the 7:00pm showing of Waitress and there was already a line down the block! They started letting people in a little before 7 and the show probably started sometime between 7:15-7:30pm. The line for the restroom gets long, so if you come after 7pm, you may or may not have time to use it before the show starts. I had Orchestra seats (Row L, Seat 18/20) and the view was great. At about $229/per ticket, it's definitely not cheap, but Waitress was worth it and the seats ended up being great for me! It's a little tight, but I'm small, so it wasn't bad (the people in front didn't block my view either). You can't really see the far right side of the stage, but luckily for me, there wasn't much going on there (just the band playing).NOTE: I was hoping to go to the merchandise store after the show, but sadly, at the end of the show, everyone was directed to exit out of the building -- so if you want a souvenir, get it before the show or during intermission!",1
7,,6/6/2018,385,,"Jamaica, NY",Gabriella T.,164,4.0,144,"I loved this theatre when my family and I went to see Waitress (which was absolutely phenomenal)!!! It isn't too large, yet isn't too small.. the perfect amount of room to feel comfortable but still a great view from the top section! The only downside is that there is only ONE bathroom which obviously gets incredibly crowded before the show/during intermission. Also, there was a problem with the credit card readers when I was there which was a big inconvenience for people who wanted to buy food/souvenirs and didn't have cash. The drinks were awesome but at that Broadway price point of course. Service was very sweet. A good theatre overall!",
8,1,9/29/2018,0,1,"Wilmington, NC",Cochran D.,4,5.0,35,"Every seat is excellent.  Don't worry about your seat location.  This theatre is smaller than most, which is a GOOD THING. There's one bathroom for men and one for women.  I recommend women bolt from their seat immediately as the intermission curtain comes down.  The staff said that nearby restaurants allow the use of their bathroom too, so that's an option if you are late. Take your ticket as you will need it to get back in.  Staff does a great job. Theatre is cozy and a wonderful experience.",1
9,,1/2/2018,359,,"Manhattan, NY",Angela K.,119,2.0,368,"Waitress is a wonderful show!With that being said, I'm only reviewing the theater. What type of theater/venue nowadays doesn't take electronic tickets? There's nothing on any ticket that says it has to be printed out, yet they wouldn't even try to scan my electronic ticket.If you bought your ticket from Ticketmaster, you are in luck since the box office will print it for you. Otherwise, they direct you to the Edison hotel next door, where they charge you - I saw a ton of people going through the same thing because they bought their seats from SeatGeek or some similar app.Buyer beware - make sure to print your ticket. I'm surprised since it's now 2018 and they still can't accept electronic tickets when every movie, other Broadway/off-Broadway show, and sporting events have all been able to easily scan tickets off of my phone...",2
10,,3/8/2018,428,,"Rockville, MD",Larissa J.,701,4.0,434,"This is one of my favorite theaters in all of Manhattan because it is where Waitress is playing currently. I absolutely LOVE that show!!! What I also like about this theater is that there are NO bad seats, every single seat in the place is a good one. The only problem is that because it is so small, they can't let people in until very close to the start of the show so you may have to wait in a long line before entering. Also, because it is a small theater, the bathroom lines are insane, THE GOOD NEWS though...the staff is so fabulous at getting people through the lines quickly!Again, I repeat there are NO BAD SEATS in this theater so if you get the chance to see a show here, you will not be disappointed. You may be disappointed though to find out that you can not recycle your plastic cups that they give you for drinks...that's a bummer! I brought mine back to reuse and they threw it away and gave me a new one. They didn't even ask if I wanted my original one...they just tossed it and then my new one got stepped on so I left with nothing...oh well! I hope that they let you reuse sometime soon!",
11,1,1/6/2018,171,1,"Dunellen, NJ",Nikki C.,35,4.0,37,"Saw Waitress last night, it was a great show! Five stars for the show itself.Subtracted one star for the theater solely because the seats were cramped and tight. There wasn't even much room to get up and get past the people sitting next to you, so once you're seated you're stuck. I know this is due to the age of the building itself, but wasn't very pleasant.On to the good parts!We sat in the front center mezzanine, row B, seats 107 and 108 and these seats were THE BEST. I originally wanted to sit front and center but I quickly noticed how close those seats are, practically on top of the stage. For the price of the orchestra seating you shouldn't have to break your neck to see. Admittedly, I do not attend many Broadway shows so I don't know if other theaters have a similar set-up. I definitely recommend front center mezzanine, worth the cost of the ticket. If you can't get this section, don't worry too much. The theater is very intimate. Every seat would be a great experience.The attention to detail in the beautiful art and architecture of the building itself was breathtaking. It felt like I stepped back into time. The staff was very friendly! Everyone seemed to be in a good mood and enjoyed working there.",1
12,,7/27/2018,40,,"Johns Island, SC",Julie L.,15,5.0,6,Saw The Waitress last evening and it was great. The theater is small but all seats are good. We sat in the front mezzanine and I would sit there again.  The show is phenomenal and would highly recommend seeing it.,
13,,2/3/2018,159,,"Los Angeles, CA",Liezl E.,246,3.0,537,"I won't review Waitress because that show deserves 5 stars. This is just for the building itself. The theatre is small which is cool for viewing any show that you're seeing here, so don't be afraid of buying the cheap seats. I'm just here to warn you, go to the bathroom before coming here. There is a limited amount of stalls to accommodate the amount of people in this theatre. You will spend your entire intermission in line. Also if it happens to be cold or raining or have any sort of weather, you will be stuck in a long long line to get inside the theatre, and it's all outside and uncovered. They search your purses before entering, so you may be stuck outside for a while. The cast of Waitress does sign after the show.  If you race out after the show is done and snag a spot on the fencing placed outside the stage door, the cast makes its way down the line to sign and sometimes take pictures.",
14,,6/21/2018,53,,"Warrington, PA",Courtney C.,739,2.0,330,"Went here to see Waitress the other day and this is definitely one of the worst theaters I have been to. The building is small, I understand that it is old so some of the issues with the theater have to do with that. Like the extremely tight seats and aisles. It sucks because when you spend a lot on a ticket (and find out later you could have got it discounted) you expect to be a little more comfortable. Viewing wise- it was fine, it's small enough that probably any seat you take will be good to view the stage. The BIGGEST problem was the bathrooms. And the staff handled this terribly. First of all, the large majority of the people at this show were females. So why not open up the men's restroom? The women's restroom wrapped around the upstairs twice. Which yes all the ladies had to walk up the stairs and then wait on the stairs and get called to their spot in line. If the line is that long you should do something about it. They could have easily sent all men to the accessible room downstairs and when someone who had a handicap needed it, allowed them to use it first or just send in a few women at a time to the men's as it empties and then as a man comes up make sure all the women are out and send in the guys and keep that up. Surely with all the staff they had controlling the ladies room line they could have devised a better plan to help the ladies out. Also the 'attendant ' in the women's restroom literally only barked at us for open doors and did nothing else and had a tip jar out. I'm supposed to tip a lady for yelling at me that a stall is open? No thank you. The prices of the food and drink were also expensive. $14 for a mini mason jar pie. Also if you are trying to reduce your waste don't be expected to be allowed to refill your own cup rather than use/buy their cups. The only saving grace was at the very end there was a nice member of the staff who offered to take our picture. It's unfortunate how awful the theater was especially since this was my mom's first time going to broadway - I had purchased GOOD tickets for her birthday -   and she had to experience such a lousy theater. Oh and like I said we later found out about all of the discounts that were being offered. INCREDIBLE show, lousy theater.",
15,,6/10/2018,20,,"Branford, CT",Richard A.,657,4.0,353,"The theater was a typical Broadway theater. The staff did a good job on crowd control and was well organized during intermission. Like most Broadway theaters, the men's room was small. I thought this one was not only small, but cramped.",
16,4,7/21/2017,345,3,"Downers Grove, IL",LOIS B.,108,3.0,953,"This is a relatively small theater.  I would think that there are good sight lines from everywhere.  A frequent problem in theaters is temperature control.  I found that I was comfortable in this theater.  There was ample leg room.  Nicely renovated.So, when an employee tells you to leave at intermission and go to a restaurant to use the facilities, that says A LOT.  Fortunately, for this performance everyone was able to attend to their needs and get back to their seat for the second act.  Other reviews stated that did not happen for them, most unfortunate.Lobby area is VERY tight with a small concession area.Also, at the end of the performance, the staff was most generous to allow us time to take photos while most of the audience raced for the exits.I would attend another performance at this theater but limit liquid intake.",3
17,1,10/1/2017,180,,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",April L.,1606,4.0,223,Great venue to see a play.  Not a bad seat in the house.  The theatre had a great sound system and was very clean.  We went to the Brooks Atkinson to see the play Waitress and it was very entertaining.  It was very funny and had a cute storyline.  My cousin and I enjoyed it very much.  I highly recommend this play.,
18,,2/12/2018,31,,"Brielle, NJ",Damian S.,0,4.0,8,"My family recently went to see ""Waitress"" at this theater. (We we're thrilled to see Sara Bareilles and Jason Mraz!) It's still a gorgeous theater with beautiful ceilings. We sat in the side front mezzanine (row B) and all except the end seat had a great view! The end wasn't bad, just couldn't see the far right of the stage. The sound was terrific.The seats themselves were comfortable, but there was not enough leg room! My husband is 6'0"" and was really wedged in. At intermission he switched to the end seat and that helped.I noticed at intermission that the line to the ladies room was extremely long. I would definitely recommend this theater. If you can afford it (we couldn't) get the orchestra seats.",1
19,,6/30/2017,46,,"Manhattan, NY",Julianne G.,601,4.0,257,"// WaitressI saw Waitress starring Betsy Wolfe and she was fabulous in it! The entire cast was very strong, with the lead, Becky (Charity Angel Dawson), and Ogie (Christopher Fitzgerald) being stand out. The doctor (Drew Gehling) was a terrific actor and there were many giggles and ""aww""s at his charming awkwardness. The songs were great and it gets even better in the second half! // TheaterI didn't bother to try using the bathroom during intermission but my friends said the line was ridiculously long. What I liked about this theater is that it's enclosed by curtains during showtime so you don't get distracted by people coming in late. The theater itself was gorgeous and we sat in row H orch and had a perfect view!",2
20,,6/21/2017,156,,"Brighton, Boston, MA",Laresa M.,518,5.0,91,"My best friend and I saw Waitress here this past weekend while spending a long weekend in NYC for her birthday. The theater was smaller than I anticipated but sat quite a lot of people as it was packed and the line for the ladies restroom was exceedingly long! This theater is gorgeous! I loved the decor and feel of it all. We had great seats in the center of the 4th row so watching the musical was even more fantastic at that view! The live music on stage wasn't too loud or overpowering. It was all very well balanced. They had food and Waitress swag in the hallway of the balcony as well as the line for the bathrooms. It was only slightly cramped with all of that going on. The swag for Waitress was really cute with the pie theme, as well as the pie themed drinks and mini pies to eat! Overall, the theater was great and the musical Waitress is definitely a must see!",1

Updated review",17,,"Haddonfield, NJ",DeAdra W.,1,2.0,75,"So what I'm learning is that the customer service at this theater is just an overall issue. As shows come and go, I found myself back at this theater over the weekend on account of a generous Christmas gift from my boyfriend (We are both big Sara Bareilles fans- run, don't walk to see Waitress. The show is the loveliest thing and the music is superb. Jason and Sara have amazing onstage chemistry, so I was thrilled that we were able to catch them both during their limited runs in the show.). I went to the hotel bar pre-show to get a drink and one of the adorable little souvenir pies being sold (Waitress... pie shop... get it?). My drink, my tiny pie, and I made our way back to my seat in no time and I enjoyed my drink and the show. It wasn't until I got back home to South Jersey the following day that I noticed the double pending charge for my pie and my drink on my bank account.I called the theater just to confirm that only one of those charges would go through and was told by the woman who answered the phone that the manager Chris was on the floor as the show had just ended that day. She sent me to his voicemail and I left a message describing my situation and left my name and number. Crickets. I called back the following day and was told that he wasn't in because the theater was dark that day. I sent an email to see if anyone there could assist as it wasn't a direct email to the theater but a general Nederlander organization customer service email. Nothing. Thankfully, the situation sorted itself out, but here I am, days later, with literally no communication from the voicemail that I'd left or the email that I'd sent.Moral of the story, if you must visit this theater, use cash. And pray that you don't need any type of customer service help because you won't get it. Such a shame because the show itself was fantastic.",
23,,7/4/2017,280,,"Queens, New York, NY",Angeline P.,93,3.0,499,"I saw Waitress here with Sara Bareilles, and I had a great time. The only problem is that if you're sitting in the first two rows on the right side, you're going to have your view obstructed by the other people on the stage. I wish I'd known that before I shelled out the tickets -- the theater is small enough that even sitting in the mezzanine in the center might have provided better visibility.I read the other reviews before coming, and I avoided the bathrooms during the show. Instead, I spent it in line buying merch, and smelling the lovely apple pie they were baking in the lobby. It was a great life choice.",
24,,4/24/2017,384,,"Mount Pleasant, SC",Kelly C.,673,4.0,802,"Pros: This is a very small theater with no obstructed views and no bad seats. The seats are comfortable even though they aren't particularly roomy. Unlike some other theaters, you don't have to be a mountain climber with extra lung capacity to get to the top rows. There is a bar upstairs that serves food (like pie in a jar!) and two different booths selling mementos. Cons: There is only one men's room and one women's room for the entire theater and the lines are FOREVER long. Definitely use the loo before you get into the theater or be prepared to miss chunks of the show while you're waiting in line.",2
25,,6/17/2018,42,,"San Diego, CA",Steve A.,41,5.0,42,"The theater was beautiful and very ornate. It was a perfect venue for seeing the play ""Waitress"", starring Katharine McFee.  The play, as well as Katharine, was outstanding.",
26,5,4/25/2016,481,4,"Philadelphia, PA",Michelle P.,6454,3.0,1246,"I went to see Waitress the Musical during the last night of previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. The ticket scanning and bag checks were like a well-oiled machine and we were able to walk right on in. The view from the front row of rear mezzanine were great. We were high up, still had a great site-line of the entire stage and wonderful acoustics. The front of the section was just a curtain, so we were able to stretch our legs during the show. The theatre gets docked stars for the bathroom experience. Like other older theatres, there aren't a ton of stalls in the ladies' room. There's also not a ton of space to wait. I felt like cattle standing in a line that wrapped around the mezzanine floor. Once in the bathrooms, the split doors opened in towards the toilet. Awkward! There was overpriced food, drinks and souvenirs. Yada, yada, yada...you know the drill. I wish I could rate the show on this listing, because that would get 5 stars. The theatre itself was a solid 3.",11
27,,4/13/2018,12,,"Richardson, TX",Kimmy K.,10,5.0,33,"Went to see Waitress -- loved it!!!! Small theatre but honestly almost all the seats will give you a good view with the set up. Of course I forgot my tickets on the kitchen fridge, but will call ended up being a breeze. After the show was over, I wanted to watch it for a second time. Fantastic!",
28,,1/26/2018,0,,"Calgary, Canada",Jocelyn B.,0,1.0,3,"DO NOT PURCHASE BACK ROW ORCHESTRA LEVEL TICKETS!Paid $480+ for two tickets to Waitress, for Row O. Sight lines were good (I am 5'1), however my experience was heavily impacted due to the fact that the standing row, (which is not on Ticketmaster.com, where I bought my tickets) was sold for my show. Throughout the whole show, I had someone breathing over my head, so much so that I could feel the enviable ""breeze"" on my head that was coming from their nose and mouth as they leaned over the bar directly behind me.When I addressed this issue to the Front of House Manager at intermission, he suggested that I come back another evening, and he would kindly arrange to have two chairs placed against the back wall for us, as he was not able to provide us alternate tickets. We were to ask for Chris 15 minutes prior to the show, and we would be seated, behind the standing row. That's right, seated behind a row of standing individuals where there is no pitch in the floor, about 2-3 feet away. These chairs were set up for the show I attended. Chris argued that this would provide a view about the same as what I had originally purchased. I was disappointed with this solution, as I had planned, and paid for a reserved, ticketed experience, and expected any efforts to remedy the situation be of the same like quality.Lesson learned: do not pay topdollar for show tickets at the Brooks Atkinson theatre when this row is offered, as if the show is sold out, the Nederlander Group will sell the space behind you for about $30. That's how much your business means to them. Your business isn't appreciated, so much that they need an extra $30.I feel as though the Nederlander should have just charged me the extra $30 to avoid this whole situation. Given the price of the bar, merchandise, and snacks (we had $12 pie in tiny mason jars), these sorts of situations likely reveal an organization's true culture.Given the hard work the performers put into the production, it is a shame Nederlander doesn't make a bigger effort into to providing a more honest experience for patrons with reserved ticketed seats.",1

We saw Waitress here and I would highly recommend it. I'm a huge Sara Bareilles fan and the music and lyrics are definitely very her. We were in the orchestra, 4th row, but for this show specifically, I would recommend sitting farther away and higher up (loge would be ideal). The cast tends to focus their line of sight and singing upwards. Also, find somewhere to eat some pie afterwards, because you will probably crave some after the show (though they were selling mini pies in a jar for $10 a pop. I gave in and bought a cookies 'n cream).Like everyone else said, the bathroom sitch is a cluster, so plan accordingly (i.e. don't drink a bubble tea right before the show like I did).",7

My daughter selected the show for my surprise Christmas gift December 2013. She knows how to pick them!  I loved the singing and dancing. The Jazz at Lincoln Center all a Stars performed. I'm a big fan of the Jazz age. Really enjoyable. The previous show I saw at this theater was a tribute to the Beatles. I thought it sounded like it would be a good show. My daughter gave me the choice of show for Christmas 2010. We finally cashed in my gift in April 2011 when I made up my mind to see the tribute. She was not thrilled with my choice. I must say it was not one of my peak show experiences. She was right! For a small venue I remember the acoustics were lousy. It was a performance of Beatles wanna be and historic footage of the real Beatles. It was a nice flashback but disappointing. The theater was comfortable to me both times. I liked the intimate atmosphere. No outstanding review of the venue here. I let my daughter pick the show the next time.....,14

Lol. I couldn't wait for intermission just so I could get up and stretch my legs. I know the theater is old but a little remodeling to give more leg room wouldn't hirt either. Another problem was that the four of us were separated... two of us were on the right while the other two were on the left.

I have never experienced worse customer service than from what I recently witnessed from the staff at the BAT. From the customer service agent over the phone, to the agent in the ticket booth to the ushers, every single person was more rude than the last. Here's a little backstory: My wife and I got engaged at a Sara Bareilies concert. When I found out Sara would be taking over the leading role in the Waitress musical I immediately purchased tickets intending to surprise my wife for her birthday. I purchased tickets for the show on April 8. On the morning of April 8, Delta inexplicably cancelled our flight. Long story short my April 8 tickets were not going to be used.After finally getting our flights rebooked, we contacted Broadway.com (where we purchased the tickets) to see if there was any way we could use the tickets past date. We were informed by Broadway.com that all shows aside from Hamilton are eligible to use the tickets past date. Broadway.com told us to call them on the day-of and they would contact the theater. They did warn us that it was the theater's discretion but to their belief, every show besides Hamilton was offering this ""reaccomodation.""Since we would be rebooking our entire trip just to see this musical, we had to be absolutely sure we would be able to use our tickets. We decided to come on a Wednesday which offers two showings of Waitress. We found the theater's phone number and contacted their customer service line. When the phone agent picked up the phone, it sounded like I was disrupting her day. I told the agent what had happened and was not only told no past date tickets would be allowed, but yelled at by the agent for even asking. She also mentioned that it was not the theater's discretion, but the production company. When I asked for the production company's phone number, I was told that no phone number existed and was hung up on.Look I get it, Sara is a bigger star than your insignificant theater is used to accommodating but that does not mean you don't have to treat customers with respect.  I also understand that it was not your fault that Delta cancelled our flight.We eventually ended up purchasing two new tickets for double the price I paid for the original tickets. Again, I understand not the theater's fault. When we went to pick our tickets from will call, the agent in the booth was also extremely rude. He said one word: ""name"" when we gave our name he pulled out the tickets and dropped them in the ticket slot. Nice work buddy!After being rushed into the theater like a herd of cattle we found our seats. The seats were in the orchestra section and were so off to the right that we could not see the whole set. Basically if anyone was stage right, we couldn't see them. My third interaction with the theater staff came at the first intermission. After going to the bathroom I made my way to the end of the concession line. After waiting 5 minutes in line, I was approached by a theater staff member and rudely told that the end of the line starts at the end of the stairs. When I asked where that was she simply pointed downstairs. When I began to make my way down the stairs I asked another usher where the concession line was and he pointed me to exactly where I was standing. By the time I made my way back upstairs through the crowd, 20 additional people had joined the line where I had just waited. When I asked the usher who told me to go downstairs why she told me to go downstairs, she ignored me. My hope for the Brooks Atkinson Theater is that Waitress leaves your theater. The show itself was incredible! However, part of  attending a broadway show requires you to deal with theater staff members. If the staff members are as rude as they were at BAT it takes away from the overall experience of the show. If your staff is not equipped to handle the new surge of customers because of Sara then I advise you seek help or additional staffing so you're not overwhelmed. Nobody should be treated the way we were treated.",7

With that being said, I had a major issue with the theater starting the show before my wife could use the restroom after the first act. There needs to be open communication with the director and staff about the issues they have by not being able to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. We paid a lot of money for my wife to miss the first few minutes of the second act because the restroom lines were sooooooo long. Very unprofessional.",

I think they shouldn't dear people there then, on these seats or around that area. We initially got an apology, and a promise to lower/switch off AC in second half (which didn't happen). After some gentle nudging that it's not acceptable to have an AC compete with the sound of the stage (it's a musical!), we were offered seats at a next show. We'd much rather have our money back, especially since we had brought a friend from out of town, who can't benefit from the new seats.

After we were herded in we went directly to the rest rooms before taking our seats in order to minimize our wait time in a restroom line. There was no line for the men's room but the line for the women's room was about 25 minutes despite the fact that they had a woman stationed in the bathroom calling out the number of stalls when they were ready. The stalls were so tiny I could barely bend my knees to sit down or stand up.

Looking at the seats around me the view from the orchestra was great no visible obstructions. I would have likely bailed at intermission if the show hadn't of had a great first act.

Further, the actors were well equipped to make cool usage of mundane objects as a 2012 MacGyver for props with the audience's power of imagination as gloves for birds; rope to depict ocean waves; and rope for a mirror. As per Playbill Vault. com, the stage frame is hand crafted adorning the proscenium with kitchen timers, bottle caps, ropes, zippers, cork, buttons mold in relief sculptures from thrift shops.  The giant pineapple is taken from the story as props which is implemented as an element onto the proscenium.  Good acoustics and lighting but there is absolutely no leg room nor elbow space for theatre patrons.  Albeit, I'm a petite person but my legs were restricted for the entire performance's duration--bears uncomfortable.  For the big bone... I can imagine the level of discomfort restricting physical movement as one can surely be the maestro of complaints!Evidently in conjunction with the uncomfortableness, the temperature dropped as I required my coat to provide warmth.  Facilities are on the upper level where there is a water cooler by the sinks.  For the women's stalls, like the theatre seats, bears no space for movement as you're refined into a microscopic box of double doors which thankfully open outwards.",1

A pineapple?Along the lines of an old school theater you also get old school seat sizing - cramped and crammed in! I swear, people back in the 1920's must have been mini-sized when they set up the seating here. The chairs are comfortable though, and they had nice cool air conditioning running. Good sight line from where we sat in the audience just under the first mezzanine, but the acoustics were kind of muffled to me in this area and at times it was tough to understand some of the actor's lines.Don't get me started on the bathrooms.

83,1,11/15/2010,184,1,"New York, NY",Jacob Y.,120,3.0,467,"Rock of Ages?  WHAT?  Seriously?  What the heck, a friend was in town and we went to check it out, considering I am a sucker for classic rock music.  Yes, the 80s fall into that category (my God, I am getting old).So the show, despite the cheesy advertisement was not bad.  Entertaining at least and the music was as I expected.  And yes, quite comical if I must say so myself.  I guess I must yelp the show too, so stay tuned.The venue...well...I got one of the limited seat views on the balcony.  Kind of reminded me of the seat that Lincoln had before being shot...but I digress on that conversation for another review.What I really got turned off on was the lobby area on the second floor.  During intermission, it was almost impossible to walk through it.  Very poor layout.  And with everyone getting drinks (yup, it's sort of that type of show), it was packed to the brim.Then again, this is expected in NYC on Broadway where the theaters are quite a bit smaller, in comparison to other cities like Chicago, where the theaters are ginormous.At least the few drinks I had made me survive through the hoards of people!",1
84,,6/4/2009,184,,"FOREST HILLS, NY",Mike B.,174,4.0,1505,"Gotta agree with the previous posts - Rock of Ages was incredible. But I already reviewed that on a separate site, so...The theater was pretty good. Great sound system and acoustics, seating was comfortable if a bit tight. It's a good, no-nonsense theater with a simple layout.",
85,1,6/9/2012,1524,,"Bronx, NY",Jordan W.,3777,2.0,1242,"This place was pretty decent on 47th street in Manhattan.  I got to check out the play Peter and the Starcatcher.  The seats were actually great and it was interesting to see the 'low budget effects"" that were incorporated in the scenes.  The seats were not that bad in size either.  At some plays I have really felt like the person next to you is litterally breathing on top of you still not enough room though for most big guys.  I still did not feel 100% comfortable but I was surrounded by yelpers after all.  Not exactly such a bad thing.  The bathroom for the men was very narrow just to enter the place and just tiny over all.  Not alot of room when you were entering or trying to leave, especially during a short intermission.",2
86,,6/16/2008,849,,"Alameda, CA",Jennifer A.,51,4.0,1782,Sitting mid-level Mezzanine wasn't bad at all!  I was able to see everything very clearly.  Pretty detailing on the lights and walls.Saw Grease which was a great production!  Lots of energy!,
87,5,3/26/2009,84,6,"Brussels, Belgium",Natalia M.,3,4.0,86,"Much credit goes to the Brooks Atkinson Theatre for the ""Rock of Ages"" (rockofagesmusical.com) show i went to last night!!! What a great space, and friendly staff! The bar/concession stand was cheaper than in most theaters i've been to and the service was quick and helpful (they had Blue Moon!!!). I was sitting in the back to the left in the orchestra and the view was full and unobstructed. My only gripe: Who plans the space between rows anyways? Smurfs? Men with freakishly small...um... legs, seeking to remake the world to their measure?!?! *shurg*  I would've died in the small space allotted for legs in the rows... or would've had to wrap my legs around the head of the person in front of me to be comfortable (win/win?)... either way I'm glad I had an aisle seat. The show itself was super entertaining and the music was great!",5
88,,7/1/2012,0,,"Frederick, MD",V F.,6,4.0,53,"We saw Peter and the Starcatcher here a few nights ago. This is a beautiful old theater and we had fantastic seats, front row center mezzanine with a great view, so no complaints there.  The leg room was a bit tight, even for me (I am not tall).  Just like every other theater in the area, the restrooms were small and inadequate, especially the women's room.",
89,,4/8/2010,331,,"San Diego, CA",Amiee L.,904,4.0,523,We saw Rock of Ages here and it's the best time I have had at a musical in a LONG time!Would love to see it again but we didn't have time on this trip....a great theater to see it.....The only downside I have is that there was ONE bathroom upstairs and the line was LONG.  If you are serving us huge mixed drinks at our seats maybe another bathroom might be nice.,
90,1,2/21/2011,84,1,"New York, NY",Harrison E.,16,2.0,222,"Great acoustics, however, the seating is terrible. While there are no visual obstructions, but the seats are designed for people under 5 feet tall--I'm 6'2"" and skinny and the seats were barely wide enough for me--forget about legroom.",2
91,1,9/22/2011,0,,"New York, NY",Julie P.,0,1.0,6,"I went to see the Wednesday matinee of ""Relatively Speaking"" yesterday. The play was fine, but that is not the point of my review. The theater bathroom situation for women was so abominable that I just had to tell you all to be very careful. There is only one main restroom and it's upstairs in one corner with 6 stalls (or so I was told...I never made it in there.) I was sitting downstairs at the other end. When intermission started it was close to impossible to get even to the end of the line, which was going down the stairs. I waited the whole intermission and was still at the opposite end of the theater when they started with the warning chimes. I never got to use the facilities and all of the women were so angry and rightfully so. A few went into the men's room, but then that line was ridiculous, too. I have been to many theaters in many cities all over the world and this is an ongoing problem. However, this particular theater takes the cake and gets the award for the worst treatment of its female audience of any theater I have attended. So hold it in ladies! and don't expect to be able to enjoy the show. I plan to avoid this theater in the future.",
92,,3/26/2014,10,,"Chicago, IL",Minnie G.,0,5.0,27,After Midnight featuring Babyface and Toni Braxton was fantastic!  I smiled for the entire show.  Fantastic music and outstanding dancers.  We had great seats but I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  If it comes to Chicago or I go back to NYC I will see it again.  Don't miss it.,
93,,5/31/2011,44,,"Wanaque, NJ",Wendy P.,1092,4.0,275,Great little theater...I think every seat has a good view...We saw rain and it was a good show but pricey....,
94,,6/15/2010,54,,"Manhattan, NY",Jasmine L.,0,4.0,645,"I got to see ""Rock of Ages"" here and it's a beautiful, old and intimate theatre, which is great because as long as you're in the orchestra or front mezzanine, you'll have fantastic seats!",1
95,1,5/11/2008,54,,"Princeton, NJ",Janelle M.,109,4.0,459,"I don't think there's a bad seat in this place.  Of course, it helped that we sat center stage in the second row!  Not a ton of leg room for the taller folk, but still a really good place to see a show!",2
96,,5/30/2009,112,,"Chicago, IL",Andrea C.,1,5.0,470,i think that my view of the theatre might be biased by how much fun i had watching 'rock of ages'....which is HYSTERICAL and a MUST SEE for anyone in nyc (80s hair bands?! yes.)the theatre itself is very very nice...definitely very well taken care of. my only gripe? the ladies room...so small! we almost didnt get to the bathroom before intermission was over! sheesh!-great acoustics-awesome super friendly staff-fun upbeat atmosphere and easy to navigate-good concessions!-ROCK OF AGES is AMAZING. i cant say enough good things about it!-having a celeb SIGHting of susan sarandon and tim robbins wasnt too shabby either :)brooks atkinson! a+!!,
97,1,4/21/2008,173,1,"San Francisco, CA",Stacey C.,14,4.0,353,"You're the one that I want!  I went to watch Grease here recently and fell in love with the theater.  Even though we were sitting way on the left edge of the balcony, we could see everything.  I don't think there's a bad seat in the house and the acoustics are really great.  Watch out for the ushers.  They're incredibly rude and they'll snap at any moment.  No pictures, cell phones, no putting stuff on the balcony ledge, like your playbill.  They will really get you.  But I guess the staff is really efficient that way and likes to keep things flowing.  Such as the bathroom attendant - I've never seen a line so long for a bathroom!  About 30 people in line stretching from the bathroom door all the way across the theater.  They have an attendant telling you what stall to go in.  And there are people running around before the show and a guy yells out from the snack tables, ""take your time, you still have 20 minutes (although really it's 5 minutes).""  Overall, a really great day at the theater.",2
