0,Yan W.,"Fairfax, VA",212,908,562,3.0,4/14/2013,"Of course it's expensive, it's a cafe in a zoo, but the staff were really nice to me.  Expect to pay about $13 for a drink, soup, and fries.  All were ""carnival"" quality.  Again, it's a zoo, what should i expect - not much.Luckily for me I went the day before Mayor Bloomberg was going to ban large sodas, so they were giving out their souvenir 32 once cups.  Sometimes you're just hungry at the zoo and have to eat.",4,,2
1,L D.,"New York, NY",2,45,14,1.0,9/9/2018,"I wish I had though to take a photo of our food.  It was embarrassingly bad and small portions, and for the price, almost laughable.  We live in Manhattan and are used to high prices, AND, we have a WCS membership so we get a 10% discount at the cafe.  For a 5 people, 3 adults & 2 children we ordered 4 food items: 5 piece chicken fingers with fries (for 2 children to share) plus 2 juice boxes for kids1 pre-packaged caesar salad plus 1 bottle of diet coke2  panini sandwiches for the other two adults.  These were so tiny, I thought they had made a mistake.  Imagine a panini at a normal NY cafe -  now cut that in half - and THAT is the portion size at the zoo cafe.  Another way to think of it is to take a round piece of panini bread and cute 1/4 of it off, and put a miniscule amount of filling inside - gee, hope that fills you up!  Our bill was $47.96 (and it would have been almost $54 but don't forget, we are MEMBERS and so got the 10% discount!)    Thank goodness 2 of the adults had water bottles with us and didn't have to buy drinks!  NEVER AGAIN!  We could have walked out to the basement food hall at the posh hotel on 59th St (basement of the Plaza Hotel) and had better food for less, and then come back to the zoo, considering our family membership gets us free admission.  Lesson learned.",,,
2,Kristen L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,0,2.0,11/15/2017,"Quite possibly the worst french fries I have ever tasted in my life. I don't know how you can mess up fries, but they certainly do. Avoid at all costs",,,
3,Stephanie G.,"Clifton, NJ",117,119,52,2.0,2/25/2017,"Nothing special here but for food inside a zoo it gets the job done. There are 5 options: pizza, chicken fingers, veggie panini, hot dogs or double cheese burger combos. 13.99-14.49 ish. It's expensive considering the quality of food is poor and just quick eats but it comes with a drink too. No views of anything interesting, just a food court.",1,1,
4,Richard B.,"Bronx, NY",968,997,600,2.0,2/14/2016,The prices are astronomical. I would recommend your force your kids to wait till you leave the zoo and go eat somewhere else. Some of the employees are not very friendly and do not pay much attention to what's going on around them. Seating can be very crowded at times.,3,1,
5,Sarah L.,"New Britain, CT",47,224,520,2.0,12/7/2012,"After eating here, I was kicking myself for not packing a lunch to bring with us into the zoo, but it was a busy week and we had to leave early that morning to get into the city so I didn't get a chance to pack a lunch and we didn't have time to leave the zoo and then come back to finish our visit as we had tickets to a show later in the afternoon.I had the Cobb salad. The salad really wasn't great and there were only two choices for salad dressing. My husband had the chicken parm panini, which was meh. I tried to get fresh fruit, but all the pieces in the basket had mold starting to grow on them so I passed on the fruit. The other options were chicken fingers, burgers, and fries. I posted a picture of the menu so you get an idea.When we go again, I will be bringing a lunch or leaving (since we will have more time) to head over to Arthur Ave to have some authentic Italian.",8,1,
6,Michael G.,"Bristol, CT",30,23,1,3.0,7/10/2016,"Good tasting food (burgers,chicken,pizza) but the prices are overpriced. It's for all the tourists visiting the central park zoo to throw their money away.",1,,
7,Ana M.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,4,0,1.0,5/11/2015,Bad bad bad!Got food poisoning there yesterday Mother's Day with my child.I ate the burger and 1.5 hour later I started to throw up badly!Don't eat there!!!I already filed a 311 complaint.,2,1,
8,Linda I.,"Centreville, VA",26,15,14,3.0,9/17/2015,"The cafe is average with food quality. There are a few refrigerated choices that are healthier than chicken fingers and fries.  They had pretzels with hummus, salad, organize milk, and deli sandwiches.  The food and drinks are overpriced.  Great spot to take shelter from the hot sun, definitely not my first choice first lunch.",,,
9,Nike C.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,55,143,4.0,6/1/2015,"A great place to have a bite. I met my friends from Massachusetts here for lunch before we toured the Central Park Zoo. The food is hamburgers, sandwiches, salads. Everything was fresh and tasted good. The prices were fine for Manhattan. My out-of-town friends thought prices were high. When we finished visiting the zoo, we stopped back at the cafe to get drinks and relax a bit.",1,1,
10,Phil D.,"Binfield, United Kingdom",1,6,0,1.0,4/18/2014,Not a nice place which is a real shame given the great location. It's fast food but no pizzas were available and the hot dogs and burgers we had were cold and greasy. Not recommended.,3,,
11,Cindy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,83,193,3.0,5/16/2014,"Expensive of course.....it is in central park and a zoo next to it. Need to being out more tables! Its also nice that strollers need to be kept outside of cafe, there is alot of kids here. So not crowded at all inside",2,,
12,Jose P.,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",0,2,0,1.0,8/27/2013,"first, very expensive for  cold food pizza was cold, burgers were cold, chicken cold, the salad old over all very bad experience",,,
