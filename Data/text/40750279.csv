0,Eric B.,"Hyde Park, VT",0,9,0.0,5.0,1/26/2018,"We stopped in after a travel day fraught with delays, so we arrived at the adjacent Riu Plaza over two hours later than expected. The ""Happy Hour all day"" sign in the elevator looked like just what we needed. Over 3 days we sampled and enjoyed the various special drinks, a killer Long Island and a very tasty Mojito. But what really got our attention was the Spanish Sandwich on the bar menu. It was just amazing!  Nice ambiance, attentive wait staff and a beautiful view across 46th St at night made it a great place for drinks and informal dinner.",,,
1,Kelly S.,"Frederick, MD",51,24,50,2.0,2/28/2018,Eh.... service wasn't great. Glad I came during happy hour because I wouldn't have paid full price for the level of quality provided. Pretty disappointing,,,
2,Cecilia T.,"Wilmington, DE",0,1,4,5.0,9/30/2017,"Definitely 5 stars! I honestly loved this restaurant! Our waiter, Rayder, was super sweet and helpful. Amazing service and food. The place itself is so beautiful. Very modern and chic. Nice place to just have lunch or dinner and chill out. (Fries are great). P.S. Our waiter was also very cute~",1,,
3,David T.,"New York, NY",50,26,1,5.0,11/2/2017,"We came for the lunch special, which is 15.00 for salad buffet, entree, and dessert. The salad buffet was really fresh. Our entree was personal pizza and we were so stuffed that we had to bring half in a box. The staff was really nice and attentive. The decor is really nice and the bathroom is super clean and has square toilets.",1,,
4,Joan K.,"Manhattan, NY",6,5,0,5.0,12/8/2017,This is a great location to meet your friends and/or family.  Fashion Restaurant is a lovely room with spacious tables.  It's Happy Hour all day.  The food is good & a nice salad bar which is affordable.,,,
5,Sirk J.,"Round Lake, IL",3,80,3,1.0,10/26/2016,"We were trying to find a place to eat but I needed to use a bathroom. So my party of 4 came inside the restaurant to check it or and possible get food. When we walked in and asked for a bathroom, I was asked by the rude bartender if I was gonna spend money at their place. I said sure I'll get a drink. With additiude I was told where it was.    If someone wanted to use my bathroom I would take them to where it was and show them. It's not a choice, such as sitting somewhere and using wifi, or just a place to relax. It's the bathroom. All humans need to use them. We can't control that our bodies need to use them. So to punish someone and say, oh you can only use a bathroom if giving us money, is really crappy. We won't be eating here and we will be are to let others we know about it back home.",1,,
6,Anira M.,"Monterey, CA",0,26,11,1.0,3/26/2017,"Went to grab a bite to eat before leaving for the airport, it was 11:58am so we walked inside (the doors weren't locked), host comes walking towards us and yells, ""Not Yet"" and pushes us back out the door. So we looked around the sign that says when they will be open (figuring we were at least an hour early or something) and we find it in the lower corner by a plant and it says it opens at 12pm...we were literally two minutes early and he was so rude to us. If they weren't open yet, maybe lock the door? Two minutes later my dad goes in and there's nobody in sight, after a while (12:05pm ) the same host guy comes out and talks to my dad, my dad comes back outside and then the same host props open the door with that plant and then says follow me and seats us. The food was ok, are server was nice, but I wouldn't have eaten there if we weren't in a time crunch.",,,
