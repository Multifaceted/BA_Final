0,Alexa C.,"Miami, FL",406,932,1629,4.0,9/11/2018,"One of NYC's oldest bars and rumored to still be haunted by an 18th century poet who was buddy buddy with Edgar Allan Poe, I had to check this place out for myself to see if the spook factor was real. Covered in wood and embodying that old NY feel is exactly what I walked into. Not exactly he place to order a martini but I'm not traditional so I did. I wanted something vanilla vodka and was offered a French martini but it came without the chambord. Still, it was great and invited some quirky conversation some nearby frequents at the bar. Directly located right by the Village, this place is a great start or end to a heavy day of drinking. Rumor has it, a shot will be served at the end of the bar for the ghost of the poet that still has presence here. It's historic and has no bells and whistles so if you're looking for an aesthetically pleasing visual experience, keep searching- this is for us gritty folk. Cheers",1,,3
1,Daniel W.,"New York, NY",116,1,0,1.0,9/4/2018,"Dear rude waiters and waitresses: when a customer complains about you ignoring them and not providing hospitable service to them, that reflects badly on the establishment you're working for.So here's what happened to me two nights ago: I went to the White Horse Tavern and let's just say that I won't be going back there again because of the bad customer service that I received. Two waiters that I came across didn't give me a very warm and welcoming reception, especially one waitress who was kinda cold and rude to me. I could tell by her demeanor that she didn't want to help me. Then when I was sitting inside the restaurant at a table, one of the other waiters walked past me multiple times without even acknowledging me. The way he was ignoring me, I thought he was just another customer. A third waiter named Dave had to help me and that's when the second waiter who kept ignoring me finally pitched in. My thing is, the whole time you were walking past me while I was sitting at a table clearly visible, you couldn't bother to acknowledge me and ask me if I've already been helped by someone? It's not like he was busy carrying around food so he had plenty of opportunities to assist me.By the end of the night I ended up giving them a $1 tip because they didn't deserve more of my money after the shitty service that they gave me and I wrote a lengthy note on the back of my check expressing how bad it was. Dave was the only one who gave me good service and I appreciated the friendliness and the hospitality that I received from him. As for the other two waiters, they weren't that great, especially the waitress who acted like a bitch to me when I tried to ask her for help before Dave came to me. It was so bad that another customer noticed me sitting at the table by myself not getting served, so when he saw that waitress outside getting ready to come back into the bar, he said to her ""Hey he needs a waiter"". That's when she said ""I'll help you in just a moment"" with a bit of an attitude, but then ended up never even helping me the whole night. Like if you can't do your job properly and treat every customer with courtesy and respect, then you don't need to be in customer service. The second waiter wasn't as bad as her, but he still didn't provide the best customer service either. Walking past a patron multiple times while they're sitting at a table by themselves and not making it your business to make sure they've been assisted is poor service. Never again will I eat at this place or let shit like this happen to me again.",1,,

4,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,1/2/2018,"Just because it's a historical bar, it doesn't make it a great bar. One of my friends thought it would be cute to have a village pub crawl of places he always wanted to check out during the holidays. In sub zero weather. And I quote ""It will be pretty"". I couldn't feel my face by the end of the night if that's what he meant by pretty. But this was one of the spots we checked out because it's been around since the 1880s. All of those seriously f*cked up writers and musicians used to hang out here: Dylan Thomas, Hunter S. Thompson, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac. You get the idea. Things that suck about this place: It's cash only. I came in here with literally $1 left in my wallet because I'm super smart. I'm happy my friends have money sometimes. The beer selection is pretty mediocre, which is expected for an old pub. But meh beer with meh prices equals meh. The horses everywhere - I got it. White horse. Sweet potato fries that someone ordered - surprisingly good. It comes with a spicy honey mustard sauce and that was bomb shnickedy good. Overall, I'm glad I checked out this place finally. It's kind of a one and done type of place though if you just want a basic over-priced Guinness or Sam Adams or typical Irish pub food. Also, don't confuse this with the other White Horse Tavern in fidi. Different pub but also has been around for close to eighty years.",3,1,3

There were 5 of us and it's 5/5. We were allowed to sit near each other but not together since they don't have a table to accommodate us. Apparently that also meant different severs. Turned out that the same server helped us! ""Helped"" lmao.It took forever for her to get her shit together. The menu was limited as you can expect from a tavern which  is ok. The food took quite a while and I ordered a sandwich.Well it was barely a sandwich. It came on a pretzelRoll. Lmao laughable. What a shitty sandwich and sooo not worth the wait. We didn't see the waitress for a while and only to drop off the check. She also NEVER RETURNED WITH MY CHANGE. Helping herself to almost a $30 dollar tip on what should have been at most $18.

My friend said the French dip was dry, but it was still edible and the au jus was good. I ordered a medium well burger and my friend ordered a medium rare burger. However, my friend's burger turned out medium well and mine was charred to a crisp. Can we say carcinogens? We still had fun as our server was super nice and the drinks were good too.

11,Sarah O.,"Mount Sinai, NY",331,1,0,1.0,4/29/2018,"This place deserves 0 stars. The service from the bartenders was absolutely appalling. I've never been so disgusted with a bar. The bartender addressed my friend as an ""idiot"" when asking for his order and he then rudely yelled at the women next to us when she asked to close out her tab. ""You want to close out your tab? WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT!""The first bar tender told us they didn't ""do"" tabs here and then the next bartender proceeded to open tabs without our knowledge. They give you back your credit card as if they closed it out (without showing you your receipt) but it's really a lie so that they can up-charge you once you leave. So remember to ask for a receipt if you unfortunately end up at this bar. And not to mention they wash their glasses in dirty soapy water and then reuse them. Please don't waste your time here.",2,,

Lots of beers on tap, fully loaded bar and really nice staff, the bar eats aren't awful and it definitely has an old school vibe which I like.

He proceeded to rudely tell them ""well you're sitting at my bar"". Really?! Do you not see the drinks in everyone's hand? First and last time at this place.

Bar goes on a surprising while.  The front of the bar seemed like the most fun area as they were playing some awesome music. Alas, no room at the inn.  White Horse is Cash only which is a negative to me in this day and age but I get it, it costs money and takes time to run cards.  Our service was fairly decent, certainly nothing to complain about.

My dad asked for a scotch, and being a friendly, fun guy, after taking a sip, joked to the bartender, ""This is great! Do you make it here?"" The bartender grabbed the glass out of my dad's hand, threw it down on the floor and screamed at us to leave. He didn't just yell...he became completely unhinged. The bouncer escorted us out.

When asked by the bartender how it was, i said 'to be honest, its nothing to write home about'. Instead of asking ""why?"" It was a bad, he immediately asked me which burgers i like in the city.I replied with 'pj clarkes and jg melon', to which he laughed and said 'oh yea, frozen patties'Now, i could have replied telling him why those places are so much better than this places, or that i actually cook for a living, but  i left it alone and figured id write a review here for future customers who actually might care as to why they would be wasting their money (cash only) here.First of all, it took 25 minutes to actually come.When it did arrive, the bottom of the plate was full of all the moisture the meat left out, leaving the bottom bun completely soggy. (Note to sub-par cook- try letting the meat rest after cooking it before plating it on a bun)On top of the late, soggy bun (which are those you find at a deli), the fries were definitely frozen and dry as a shoe. The meat was among the driest ive ever had, and completely underseasoned- meaning no salt or pepper of any kind.So, all in all a really bad burger that im still having trouble digesting.To the bartender, this is why it was crap- and why you not only have any bragging rights, but should also reconsider your profession.To any management reading this, although you might have lost me as a customer- it doesnt mean you have to loose others because of simple mistakes being made behind the bar and in the kitchen.",3,1,

We sat down outside and after ten minutes of waiting around and no one coming to our table (lots of wait staff walked by) we went inside to order. It seemed pretty obvious that we were a nuisance for being there. We were able to order an app at the table outside once the staff saw we already had beers. We had the jalapeno poppers. Wow, they kinda sucked. It was gross chunky nacho cheese with pickled jalapenos... No wonder they had to deep fry them, there was no way there were going to sell those two things any other way. Bleh. No good. This bar is also CASH ONLY. Yup, 2015 and its CASH ONLY. Not to mention that the ATM inside only lets you take out $50? What? Honestly, the only thing this bar seemed to have going for it was a killer patio, which I get it, it's a hot commodity. But do yourself a favor and skip it for a place with nicer staff that takes credit cards...",4,,

Unanimously we found the energy dull. We happen to arrive during a shift change over. Our second sever was so unpleasant. She never smiled, she acted irritated, she seemed unhappy - we felt like we are imposing on her time while she was working.  The gratuity was included -we paid the 15% gratuity and that is all.As a former local, I find it totally disappointing - the vibe was different, the service was different and there was no music just plain sucks.",3,,

61,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1,4.0,8/3/2014,"The mozzarella sticks are reheated, the hamburgers come out of a frying pan that probably has grease remnants from the Regan administration and the free cheese puffs are probably purchased in bulk from someone's cousin who knows a guy, but The White Horse has an atmosphere that is so impossibly/improbably against what reigns in the Financial District that one has to be impressed.The drink prices are rock bottom. A $3 Yuengling (at all hours) isn't a good deal for the Financial District, it would be a good deal in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx or even upstate. The draft selection is wildly different upstairs and downstairs, although the service (not the fastest but quite friendly) is the same. Upstairs you'll find a dartboard (use at your own peril, as when it gets crowded people tend to walk in front of shots) and a jukebox. Downstairs there's a separate jukebox and the kitchen. Apparently the third floor sometimes opens for private functions and heavy seasons.The crowd is impressively diverse for the white, professional financial district. It's the cool offices, the place where the junior staff complains about their managers, where the NYU students priced out of the village, the old timers who hung on to their rent controlled places after Sept. 11.

We came here because it was a gorgeous day out and they have a good amount of outdoor seating.  Plus, 2 of my friends were already there. However, they were seated at a 2-top.  We spoke to the bouncer about our situation and he allowed our groups to combine at an available 4-top.  Two of us sat at the table while the other two went to smoke.  After a few minutes, the bouncer started asking us if the two other people were in fact going to come back.  We were like, yes, they are just down the block smoking.  Few minutes later the bouncer asked us again if they were coming back and we replied with the same answer.  He asks a third time and proceeds to say how he doesn't appreciate being lied to, he doesn't think they'e coming back, he saw them walk north (when in fact they walked south), he doesn't see anyone smoking down the block.  Then goes, ""Guys, you need to move"" and forced us to move to a 2-top table.  We had already ordered and received drinks before he forced us to move.  Of course after we moved our other 2 friends came back.  By that point though we were so pissed about how we were treated we left and enjoyed the rest of our evening across the street at Frankies.  It seems like they are generally strict about seating here.  Fine.  However, the bouncer could have handled the situation in a different manner instead of basically calling us liars.  Plus, no other parties were waiting for a table!

We sat outside and a young blond waitress came up didn't introduce herself and asked us if we were getting food we said yes and she brought us menus and plopped our silverware on two napkins in the middle of the table, what a bad start. After about 10 mins she came back and with a stone cold face asked ""Are you ready"" my girl and I just sighed and ordered. I asked her for mayo for my sandwich and she said I'll bring it on the side and left. She brought me my iced tea with no sugar or lemon and I had to wait another 10 mins before she even came outside so I can ask her for some she brought me two packs that felt like they had liquid spilled on them and dried afterwards I don't even use it. I drank my tea without sugar. Then she brings us our food with no mayo, turns and rushes away I was left with an open mouth. I was having such a bad day and she was making my night worse all I could do is breath and laugh. When she came back I asked her for mayo and with an irritated face she brought me three packs of the to-go mayo packs and plopped them on the edge of the table and left. We just shook our heads, ate our food and asked for the check which took close to 20 mins because Blondie disappeared but I figured maybe she went on break. Anyways its sad to say the only time we got a smile was when she saw the tip I added bc I tip no matter what. It's even sadder that I'll never come back here. I was really excited and then terribly dissapointed. The only reason I even gave it two stars was because the food was good.  It has such great potential lost on people like her.

Drinks were ordinary as well. It's actually sort of nice you can just walk in, pick a table, and figure it out afterward.

He then claimed that we had to be on a single check because its cash only. I should clarify I do not mean everyone wanted separate checks rather there were two separate tables. It seemed odd that he was rude about making this declaration when we all would have been fine with that anyways. The waitress however was the opposite of the bouncer. She was really nice and seemed a little new, but was fairly attentive. The only odd thing was that she was very concerned about whether we really needed a menu or not. Maybe the place has limited menus??I might stop by again if friends ask. Also, they will remind you multiple times CASH ONLY. It is impossible not to remember that when you are at this bar.",2,,

Uruguay soccer game of the FIFA Confederation's Cup.  We ordered drinks and asked if the TV broadcasting a replay of a PGA tour tournament (that no one seemed to be paying any attention to) could be changed to the soccer game.  Our server said she'd check.  Fifteen minutes later, no TV change so we asked a different person who replied ""We're busy right now.""  Okay.  We got our food.  It was fine, nothing special but we weren't looking for special.Ask #3 to... a bouncer?  I asked, ""Could the golf game be changed for the soccer game on ESPN2?""  He pointed at the TV and said, ""That's the golf channel.""  ???  At this point, the soccer game was going into extra time.  Let me emphasize- No one was watching golf.  The other TV had the Mets game on and people were clearly paying attention to it.  Had the Mets game been on the other TV we probably would not have asked for it to be changed.  Had people been watching the replay of golf, we probably would not have asked for it to be changed. Ask #4 to our original server.  She was a bit huffy but asked the gentleman bar tending to change the channel.  This is where it got absurd.  He said: ""No, this is America.  Home of the brave.""  WHAT.  Zero points awarded for even trying to make a logical argument about someone watching the golf... no one was watching the golf, I promise.  But, you do have to be very brave to watch golf, I guess.",4,4,2

My friend went over and politely asked if the group of 3 girls would mind switching with us.  The girls said as long as we had a 4 person table (and not a 2 person table) they would be willing to switch with us.  Which we did... maybe problem solved?! To make sure we weren't stepping on any toes, we decided we should ask the host if we could do so.  He rudely ignored us and pretended to not hear my friend who was speaking calmly and respectfully I might add.  Eventually he said that fine, if the girls at the table said it was ok, then ""whatever""...... so the two tables switched places.  No one was bent out of shape or annoyed and actually the girls at the other table said to us, ""no problem at all!  We were wrapping up anyway.  Enjoy your night!""We weren't sitting at our table 2 minutes before the waitress for THAT table visibly started yelling at the host.  We discussed amongst our group of 5 and decided we should settle our tab from the previous table as we wouldn't want to mess up anyone's tips.  What we weren't expecting was what happened next.The waitress came up to our table, in a fury and before anyone could say anything she said the following in a raised voice:""What you guys have just done is unacceptable.  I have been waiting on those girls for the last hour.  They told me that they only moved as they felt pressured to do so from you guys.  They are actually NICE girls and you forcing them to move is not ok.  I DO NOT WANT TO WAIT ON YOU AND YOU ARE NOT WELCOME AT MY TABLE"".  This waitress said this to 5 people who had been nothing but pleasant to everyone involved.  5 people who asked everyone politely if perhaps they might be willing to help us out.  5 people who were settling in for an evening of drinking and food.  This was one of the most outrageous displays of rudeness I have ever encountered.  And to her own detriment, I might add.  It didn't take us long to gather our stuff and move to another bar down the street, where, we ordered food, and sat chatting over drinks until well past midnight.  Our original waitress apologized to us on our way out, but quite frankly, this was some of the most obtuse, illogical behavior I have ever witnessed.  Not to mention completely rude and undeserved.  At no point had we made a scene or been rude to anyone.  We purely wanted to have some drinks, sitting outside, and enjoy ourselves.  But what we got was some of the most outrageous behavior from a waitress I have EVER experienced.  I used to love White Horse.  I will not be going back there again until they, once again change hands.  Which, thankfully, I don't think will be too long from now if they keep up their amazing customer service.",2,2,

To quote Baz Luhrmann, the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience, and I will dispense of this advice now: (1) Don't come to the White Horse expecting to find a struggling writer.  Today's writers are far too whiny and fragile to share drinks with a politically diverse crowd of older men. (2) Don't request Journey on the jukebox. This advice goes for all bars, but especially the White Horse, which has an 'over 25' policy for a reason.  (3)  Don't come expecting haute bar food, ya foodie!  (4)  Don't ask for a Mexican beer or any other drink with a fruit garnish.  (5)  Don't come here for a first date, but don't date anyone that wouldn't come here on a second date. The White Horse is perhaps most famous for being the place where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death and Jack Kerouac sat alongside Norman Mailer, but its more than just a historical anecdote.  It is a time portal, a welcoming respite from the West Village's rapid Tory Burchization, and a all around fine place to enjoy a beer or whiskey drink and reminisce about Old New York.",9,7,7

181,Mark T.,"New York, NY",327,96,17,2.0,7/2/2010,"Ah, the White Horse Tavern. What can I say? It's history is really cool, and it is such a part of the neighborhood that I feel guilty giving a 2 star review. But, hey, I used to be a baseball umpire, and all I can do is call 'em as I see 'em.Beer Selection: week. Admittedly I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to this, but really there isn't a great selection here.Food: Nacho's: I've started a list of reviews regarding nacho places and let me tell you, the nacho's here are bottom of the list. Chips from the grocery aisle, with a little cheese thrown on them, topped with still very cold sour cream, and something that resembled guac, but had no flavor whatsoever.Burgers: Again, I have a list going of burger places and this will not be high on the list. I ordered medium-rare, my friend ordered rare. He got what I wanted, mine was too done. It is fatty and greasy, and not a lot of taste-bud bursting flavor.Atmosphere: It's good, very laid back, and the outdoor seating is good too. You will have a bit of a wait for outdoor seating during prime hours on a nice summer day.",3,,
182,Mike O.,"Brooklyn, NY",210,1721,570,3.0,8/2/2011,"On a hot Saturday we took respite here and found a little corner all the way at the back that had the best a/c in the joint. It was quiet, and we enjoyed our drinks and our conversations. Then a pub crawl group showed up, and it's theme was the literary bars of Greenwich Village. It sounded cool, and we leaned in as the leaders presented their information. The idea of the pub crawl was cool, but listening to these two people try to be funny was obnoxious. They seemed like would-be actors, but unfortunately were not would-be comedians. Watch out on Saturday afternoons for this crowd because apparently they come every week. Perhaps some weeks that have cool pub crawl leaders. Anyway, it's a historic bar where Dylan Thomas, Jack Kerouac and others drank themselves to death. Sounds romantic, eh? I prefer McSorley's for historic New York bars, but if you can stay away from the pub crawls, this bar might actually be better in terms of space and variety.",,,
183,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",55,533,110,2.0,8/29/2013,we walked by on a recent night and with such nice sidewalk seating for a beautiful evening how could we resist. so we walked in. we sat. we looked at the menus. we sat. we looked around for a server to flag. we sat. and then we left. nice location. nice outdoor sidewalk space. but not for us.,,,
184,Michael B.,"White Plains, NY",0,44,0,1.0,5/28/2013,"Absolutely disgusted by this place. A group of 10 of us were there for a friends birthday. Within 30 seconds of us walking in, we were yelled at by the bouncer for standing near the dining area. Not *asked* to move elsewhere, but literally yelled at. The bouncers are jokes. Avoid.",,1,
185,George B.,"Bronx, NY",191,167,92,3.0,6/5/2011,"On a nice day the outdoor seating made this place pretty nice.  The food was pretty good, too bad everything wasn't as perfect as the weather.  1st. In 2011 I don't carry much cash in NYC, so this place not accepting credit cards really sucks along with the waitress that can't tell when patrons are done with their meal and  are MIA",,,
186,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0,3.0,8/4/2013,"This is a fairly good bar to get a drink at in the West Village. Pros are good crowd, relaxed atmosphere, great location. Cons are its cash only and tends to draw a baby friendly crowd which I personally don't want to be around drunk. Still, not a bad place to get a drink and enjoy some West Village history as this bar has been around for decades and has tons of Village lore in its veins. Outdoor seating can be a big bonus.",,,

188,E. M.,"Manhattan, NY",14,130,55,2.0,8/1/2014,"I've read some reviews that mentioned there's recently been a management change here and I could tell by my experience last night. The male host was unfriendly and almost threw a tantrum when we wanted to fit 5 people at our table. Little advice: More customers means more money for the bar. Anyway, our waitress was actually friendly so I feel bad she and other staff have to work for these unprofessional and amateurish management/owners. I'd only come back for drinks to be outside, but it's tough to give money to this place. The food is mediocre and they throw on an 18% gratuity hoping you'll just pay it. This place used to be great but now sends the message that it doesn't appreciate the customer so I probably won't be back.",2,,

190,Andrew S.,"Queens, NY",484,38,130,3.0,5/18/2011,"Best Bloody Mary in New York City. Perhaps it's because they made it maybe 3 years ago and it had a chance to ferment - adding to the already sizable amount of rail vodka they dump in. Either way, they are amazing. The food, well - not really anything amazing but let me tell you! Chicken Sandwich please! They are really that good. This place is brought down by the fact they have a bunch of stupid unicorns or something hanging all over the place. Yea, I get the White Horse thing but it's a bit too creepy for me. 3.5",,,
191,Reg Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",14,177,4,3.0,7/12/2011,"It is a pub, it serves beer, not much else to say. The servers can be rude, but this is NY. That said, if there hadn't been people that hung out here, it would probably be 2 stars. There are better places in the area. I take out of towers here just to show them where Dylan Thomas allegedly drank himself to death, which is quite the accomplishment",,,
192,Jacqueline C.,"ELMHURST, NY",0,7,1,1.0,7/9/2014,"The place looked nice from the outside, so my friend and I decided to sit outside. I ordered a chardonnay and she ordered chianti.  Both drinks were underpar and cheep tasting wine. We then ordered chips and salsa. What came out should have never have come. They were Tostitos and Ortega salsa. This was confirmed by the waiter, who could care less and was inattentive.  I never write bad reviews but I wanted to save the next person from wasting their money. Sorry",2,,
193,Emilia S.,"San Mateo, CA",367,383,35,4.0,2/18/2010,"What happens when you mix three California girls, Google maps on a BlackBerry, a destination in the Meat Packing District, and a huge bottle of wine? You get three cold drunkies roaming the streets of the West Village with no idea where they area, who end up at the first bar they see because it's dark and scary out.I probably shouldn't write reviews of places I visit when I'm drinking, but from what I remember, we had a good time. We got a table pretty quickly after my friend convinced the guys at it that they were done with their beers. I somehow ended up with a gin and tonic, sending incomprehensible Facebook messages to coworkers...I (think I) liked the crowd and the place wasn't too dressy, but just a good chill bar. This is definitely the sort of place I like to hang out at...maybe even with a few less glasses of pre-partying wine.",2,,3
194,Michael K.,"New York, NY",24,82,1,3.0,5/25/2010,"I give this place 3 stars.  I had chicken nuggets, and I don't really know why.  They were okay.The outdoor seating is a plus, and it's certainly not pretending to be a gourmet restaurant, so I give it points for that.I guess I would go back here to drink outside but probably not to eat.",1,2,1

196,Stefanie B.,"Manhattan, NY",219,92,6,2.0,5/6/2011,"The White Horse's big claim to fame is that they've been around awhile and therefore have a history- Jack Kerouac and Bob Dylan are named as previous patrons and the story that Dylan Thomas died after drinking there seems to be pretty well-known.But history doesn't count for much if the establishment is not staying up to par. This place claims to have the ""best burger in the West Village"", a ""killer jukebox""  and to attract people from ""all walks of life.""  In reality? It's not that great.Is it the worst bar I've ever been to? No, but it's certainly not good. It's just another cash-only bar in the village with plenty of room to watch the game or grab a drink outside. It's OK. It's average.My question is- why bother going to a bar just because it USED to be a favorite of 50's and 60's Bohemian notables? I'm sure Kerouac, Dylan, and Thomas all frequented other NYC bars at one point or another. And if they're not around any more, it's probably because they were passed on to new ownership or closed before they became just another mediocre place to grab a beer- which is what the White Horse Tavern is.",,,
197,Guy T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,43,1,1.0,7/12/2013,"Went on for lunch. Ordered the Kielbasa sandwich with potato salad. The kielbasa was grilled with a few lightly caramelized onions, two packets of mustard and a scoop of plain Jane potato salad. The roll was so hard an stale, I tried to cut into it with my knife just for the heck of it, couldn't do it. the mustard packets has mayonnaise from the salad all over them. the waitstaff cleared the table when she brought the check and never asked how everything was, could no have cared less.
