0,NIcholas M.,"New York, NY",54,28,14,5.0,9/19/2018,"Best Burger in the East Village. Always friendly service, and great delivery.  I usually get ""the Black Iron"" Or the ""Blue Cheese"" - both are great.  Quality meat, well made burger.  The onions rings are a bit hit or miss.and the fries are okay.  Nice place, good atmosphere.  It's not bad for kids, if you go early. Later ( after 8) it turns into a bar with burgers ( really good burgers).",,,
1,Fred A.,"Manhattan, NY",400,154,0,4.0,8/28/2018,"Very solid burger. The meat patty is just high quality, nothing else to it. Solid bun, too. The fixings were pretty basic, which some love for burgers. I'm a bit of a sauce sort of guy, but still really appreciated it. Not the best burger in the world, but definitely in the top tier.Nice backyard area for drinks in the summer. Friendly staff. Big fan, especially if I'm in the neighborhood.",,,
2,Shev O.,"New York, NY",96,168,229,4.0,8/12/2018,"Saw their new place in Atlantic av and decided to try the original, because they didn't open yet! Our pick up was super fast - from phone call, to get our burger took 6min! Super fast.So we order their main thing- black iron burger. I like how they packed it, so even in the car, it's nice and no mess to eat it. Beef patty's was cooked perfectly like we asked. The flavor was really very good, and combination of sauces was really nice. We payed $15. The only thing that, I we think that's it's little bit overpriced. But we will definitely come back to try different burgers, maybe at that time, they will open Brooklyn location.",,,1
3,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,4.0,5/13/2018,"This is a great burger option!We came around 7:30 on a Saturday night and got on of the last tables. They have high too two tables and a couple bigger tables in the back, and seats at the bar. You can see them cooking your burger right up front, which is interesting because they have some detailed complex burgers coming out of the kitchen. I ordered the veggie burger and my friend the masterpiece. Obviously the masterpiece was the way to go, it came with a fried egg. My veggie burger was definitely good! But never will compete with a legit burger. Our fries though... they should call it black iron fries, that was def my favorite part. We got the ai oil fries and those were amazing.... you can't not order fries and I recommend the ones with all the stuff on it... the fires themselves were like the skinny McDonald's fries.Service was really friendly and pretty fast!",2,,
4,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",5,51,83,5.0,4/17/2018,"Nobody beats their meat, indeed! Delicious burgers and the most amazing fries... I love a place that can offer various dips for friesThe venue is small but cozy and I've never had a problem finding a seat. The bar is fun since you can watch the dude cook your meal up. Nice vibe, good food, relatively quiet space and great to catch up with friends or just to enjoy a quiet burger.",,1,
5,Emanuel A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,2,1.0,6/24/2018,I didn't eat here but I did call in for a side of fries to add to some homemade chicken nuggets. Figured I was in for 3 dollars and change and a decent sized side of fries. Show up to pick up my fries and get hit with a $7 bill for some very ordinary fries. I got a beautiful corned beef Reuben sandwich with a side of fries from Delicatessen in SoHo for less than $7 using MealPal. This place could learn something from them.,2,1,
6,Michael T.,"Chapel Hill, NC",342,6,3,5.0,10/16/2018,Best burger in Alphabet City and their chipotle wings are pretty good too. Go with an appetite as their burgers are double stacked. The sides are solid but definitely don't go alone as they're more than enough to share and priced appropriate to the size. They have a decent beer selection and daily happy hour from 5-7pm. It's a small space so don't go with more than 2-4 people. I definitely recommend it over Royale.,,,
7,Louise H.,"New York, NY",197,24,14,4.0,7/8/2018,"Tonight I ordered delivery from seamless and it was super yummy!I ordered herb garlic fries, a 6 oz. classic burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, and truffle mayonnaise, and a root beer. All together it came out to $23.46 + tip. I ordered my burger rare and it actually came rare. Many places will cook burgers medium rare instead, but the black iron was true to its word! The burger was amazing and the truffle mayonnaise was delicious. The fries were very good, but a bit soggy. That's to be expected with delivery fries, and they were still yummy. I'll definitely order from them again when I'm in the mood for a burger!",,,
8,Marie-Madeleine G.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,78,145,4.0,4/23/2018,"Let's do this right. People, I go out far too often to be disrespected at a food establishment. I may be be rude with my friends because that's our relationship, but when I step in a eatery, that's out the window. Now, I had a group of 14 with me. Reservations had already be made that if we arrived between 1845 and 1900 we would be seated. We arrived at 18:50. Why are you telling me that you had to give up my seats because it's a Saturday evening? Now normally, I'm by myself do this wouldn't be an issue. But there are 14 of us. Absolutely not. My friend, who is very much like me is flipping out, which is what I would normally be doing (but I had a paper due, so no). We're told to wait 20min. A few minutes later, after she went off, they realized they chose the wrong people to mess with. We were seated in 13min. You're probably wondering why this review has 4 stars when I started off the way I just did. Thank the waiter Alvie. He stayed on top of EVERYTHING. The attentiveness was insane. Not for those too lazy to read back story-- here's the food review. I don't like burgers so I had the BIB Chicken Burger: oh my succulence. It came with avocado and I cried from joy. Some of the other choices made included multiple Masterpieces, which I heard was one of the best burgers they've had, and the Little Italy. Starters included the loaded fries- AMAZING; Ai-Oli fries-- these were alright, not bad but not great; and the buffalo chicken-- YESSS. I had a side of sweet potato fries that completed my heart: perfectly soft and crispy at the same time. My bev: Allagash-- a wheat beer. I'd been craving this, so I was glad they had it. So a FOUR it is. The one start demotion is for the initial contact, but otherwise a solid meal. Thanks again to Alvie for stepping up and d",2,1,1
9,Taylor D.,"Centereach, NY",65,52,210,5.0,10/2/2017,"I'm so glad I tried Black Iron Burger while I was in the city this past weekend. The restaurant is really cozy and the staff are friendly. The restaurant was empty on a Saturday afternoon and we were able to get a table right away.They serve some speciality burgers, but also have options to create your own. I ordered the Mushroom Truffle burger and also tried both the regular and sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked to order, perfectly medium. The bun was soft and buttery, The truffle tapenade and the truffle mayo were incredibly tasty, and if you like mushrooms you should absolutely order this burger.  I'm not usually one to order sweet potato fries, but these were to die for. Perfectly seasoned and slightly crunchy but soft on the inside. The french fries were cooked the same way only super thin. The portions here are great, too. I will absolutely be back here when I'm in the area.",9,3,8
10,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",155,353,1310,4.0,7/29/2018,"We came in at 1pm when the place was practically empty but filled up quickly once we were seated. They have a great selection of burgers with interesting combination of ingredients or you can customize your own burger. I chose to go with a very simple burger with cheddar cheese and pickles, we also ordered French fries. My burger was cooked perfectly medium rare, the pickles were sliced very thin just how I like it. The burger was very moist and juicy and tasted delicious! The fries were thin, crispy and very flavorful. I love burgers and this place did not disappoint! Good thing they have a generous supply of napkins by the tables since you will need them after biting into the juicy burgers. Our server Marlon was very attentive and friendly and added to the great experience. Definitely looking forward to coming back next time I'm having a burger craving.",2,,1

12,Alice X.,"New York, NY",110,86,190,5.0,4/8/2018,"BIB ME. I love this place. It's right down the street from my apartment but I haven't tried it until recently. It is SO good. The fries are fresh, crispy and the sauce that goes with it is to die for. The burger is fresh, perfectly medium rare and all around amazing. Staff is nice, quick and they didn't mind that I murdered their napkins. I will DEFINITELY be back....maybe tomorrow",1,,

14,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",62,267,846,4.0,3/11/2018,"Our friend recommended this burger joint as ""one of the best burgers in NYC"", since our other mutual friend is visiting from London, we had to try ""The Masterpiece"" burger. We walked here after drinks at the local bar nearby.Previously, I had a big brunch so I was going to take a bite or two  highly recommended ""masterpiece"" burger. After waiting for a good 20 mins since we had a large group, the burgers finally arrived. There were two meat patties, cheese, fried egg on the masterpiece burger. I took one butte and the bun was brioche and the meat patties were so juicy I had to finish half of the burger. So I did. Then we ordered another one, the hash brown burger which came with a sweet sauce sandwiches between the two meat patties and sprinkled with sun dried tomatoes minus the fried eggs. Overall the quality of meat - certificated angus beef were a winner. One thing that would make the dining experience more enjoyable was the bar was very small (it is a dive bar) and the kitchen area is extremely small so the smell and smoke was all over the bar.  My hair and clothing smelled. It was so stuffy I couldn't wait to leave. This experience would have warranted 5 stars if it weren't for the extremely uncomfortable seating arrangements,  crowded space, smell from the mini-kitchen area. I would come back again but will probably sit near the bar or front entrance.",1,,
15,Craig F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",14,21,7,4.0,9/11/2018,"Cool Little restaurant, with a hip vibe. Excellent Burgers, and fries. A bit on the pricy side for a burger, as literally everything is ala carte. But it was really good!",,,
16,Daniel T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",15,1,1,5.0,7/26/2018,"Best burger of my whole life. As a side I would definetly recommend the onion rings. Whenever I'm in NYC, I will come back.",,,
17,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/28/2017,VERY good burgers and sandwiches.

19,Michael C.,"Oakland, NJ",0,12,1,5.0,9/22/2018,"Without a doubt, no hesitation, the best burger I've ever had. Mostly because of the truffle mayo, but also because of the perfectly sized portions. The onion rings were the best I've ever had also, being thinner than most and freshly fried. Nothing was too oily, but just enough to be creamy and delicious. All with very straight forward and respectable customer service and waiter/waitress interaction. Will definitely be back multiple times.",,,

21,Alan B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",292,437,12,5.0,10/4/2017,"I would start my review by saying don't judge a book by its cover; on the exterior this looks like a dive bar. And to be fair, it kind of is. But once you are seated and start having their burgers, you will know they are all business on the food. I came with a group of 7 and were lucky to get seats together (there are mostly little tables with bar stools). I began with some awesome wheat beer that they had on tap. The table mixed it up with IPAs and pilsners, and everyone was pretty satisfied.For the main entree I went with the Muhsroome Truffle Burger. Despite being only 6 ounces the beef mixed with the mushroom duxelles, truffles, and swiss cheese went down oh so smooth.  The servings of fries are large portions, and I would recommend splitting them. I went with the garlic fries, and preferred them over the plain one my friend chose.The server/bartender was a funny guy and made sure the drinks kept flowing. To me this place surely lived up to the hype before coming. Oh, and remember to bring cash (no credit cards allowed). I have surely found my favorite burger spot in alphabet city.",3,3,2

Definitely check this place out if you are having a serious burger craving.",1,,
26,Cal A.,"Toronto, Canada",0,17,0,5.0,10/7/2018,"The best burger in NYC without question. The Black Iron Burger itself is absolutely amazing. The hot, melty beef is unparalleled anywhere. It is so perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of pink in the middle and char on the top. The ridiculously high quality beef with the melted cheese and caramelized onions are absolutely perfect. The double patty makes it really well portioned with the amazing cheese fries as well. It's seriously incredible and the best burger in the big city.

They offer their draft beer in three sizes: Half Pints ($4.5), Pints ($6.5), or Pitchers ($40). I had a Hofbrau Original Lager and the Masterpiece Burger ($10.5). It is a damn good burger. The bun was straight out of the package taste. The two 4 oz patties were juicy and flavorful. The Swiss cheese was melted. The Stout Caramelized Onions were salty and sweet. The bacon was thin and crispy. The fried egg was the perfect sunny side up. The Golden yolk was exactly what I wanted. There is no sauce on this Hamburg Sandwich so opted for some table hot mustard.

Maybe I got ahead of myself but the Masterpiece Burger was really really heavy. Most of the burgers are heavy on the menu but I figured I might as well go all out. I also tried the Black Iron Burger and wasn't a fan. My friend loved the horseradish components of the burger but it really threw me off guard. I have nothing but praise for the Herb Garlic Fries.

They have a full bar and a bunch of small tables with wait service and as soon as you walk into the bar you can smell burgers on the grill and stale beer that is probably all over the floor.  I was able to get a table right away and I was hungry and got the The Black Iron burger which is a Double 4oz Patty, All Natural Beef, Double Horseradish Cheddar, Stout Caramelized Grilled Onions, Special Horseradish Mayo. That sounds good doesn't it? and I got the herb garlic fries on the side because fries do not come with the burger.The burger was cooked to perfection and was incredibly delicious and juicy with ever bite.

The burger is always cooked perfectly, the meat itself is tender and bursting with flavor.

I decided to check it out on line myself and told him I'd like to visit.So glad we decided to stop in. Upon entering the place, it was very tiny. Cozy but small. Music was good. Sports on the TV's all around.  Great ambiance. Nice and clean.He chose the Masterpiece and I had the Black Iron. Side of onion rings and sweet potatoe fries. All of which were delicious!! Service was great and pretty quick. The guy who served us was pleasant and when we left thanked us for coming. Will be back for sure.

It's a bit tiny and cramped but the vibe is subzero (that's how chill it is) and it's so worth a trip here.The service was real fast and efficient; we ordered and got our beer in about 5 minutes and then our food 10 minutes later. My friends and I split a pitcher of Hofbrau Oktoberfest (yessss for darker, bitter beers) and then each got a different burger off the menu and split some Cajun fries and sweet potato fries on the side. The fries were good, not too greasy and just the right amount of seasoning, but the real winners of the show last night were the burgers. We didn't do any burger swapping so I'm not quite sure how my friends' burgers were, but they went with Classic and Black Iron, so I'm sure it was relatively solid. My burger was out of this world - I've had pretty good burgers in the past, but the Mushroom Truffle Burger was somethin' else. It was the perfect amount of savory and gooey and a little tart and the truffle oil complemented the burger in a way that could only be termed divine intervention.Probably one of the best meals I've had in a while - so pleased with this spot.",1,,

75,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",439,503,263,4.0,8/17/2015,"We popped in later on a Monday evening around 9pm, and found this place comfortably full. There were a handful of TVs, some music going in the background, but overall a very casual and comfortable spot.  There was 1 waiter running the show for all the tables, so it took some time to get menus, orders, drinks, etc. but that was ok.We started with the chicken wings that were fried and excellent.  We also got an order of garlic and parsley fries that were good along with some onion rings that were not covered in massive amounts of batter as I expected, so they were also surprisingly light and good.  For the burger, I ordered 'The Masterpiece' that was excellent.  It was cooked medium rare as I asked and had a good assortment of flavors and textures.  To wash it all down, I got the homemade chocolate milkshake that was perfect.Overall, with a beer each and after tax and tip, it came out to about $25/person which I thought was very fair and reasonable for what we ordered.  I will most certainly be back, even if I am not in the area and just looking for a good burger.Buon appetito",3,,
76,Greg M.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,3,1,4.0,2/10/2018,"Great burgers & fries !!  BIB has a number of signature burgers you can view on their website - but if you prefer a classic you can build your own to your liking.  I had the Mushroom truffle which is rich in taste and super juicy.  Both burgers were perfectly cooked. I would suggest dining @ restaurant as the open kitchen smells great. That said,  watching prep delivery orders prepped while dining at the bar I think the take-out option looks just as good (even for burgers with egg).  The onion rings are great - its a light flakey coating that pairs well with their aioli dipping  sauce.  The manager/staff is great - we were treated to a free round of wine/fries post burger while we chatted at the bar.  Been here 5 times and its delivered each time.  Solid burger spot (never tried the chicken but looked great)!",,,

Our friend did a quick search and found BIB near the art show we were attending.  It's small, stool seating, and cash only, but the menu drew our group of six in anyway. I had the black iron burger- all of their burgers are two patty! It was topped with horseradish cheddar, horseradish mayo, and stout caramelized onions. I ordered mine well since pregnant ladies aren't supposed to have undercooked meats and it was thoroughly cooked, still juicy, plus had a nice  crunchy char on the outside. An excellent burger though I would have liked the horseradish a bit spicier. We shared the aioli fries, herb garlic fries, and onion rings. Plus 2 pitchers of beers for the drinkers. It was about $25 each for each of us to roll out of there full and happy.",7,7,6

She suggested that we should ""build our burguer"" and end up paying arround ten dollars more just to do it the way we wanted. All of this just because we wanted a different cheese??? We did the substitution   A month ago and she kept arguing that ""they changed their policies a year ago"".Since the very begging the waitress who later identified herself as a manager of the three location had a really bad attitude, she was rude and rolling her eyes which is extremely disrespectful. So we decided to just don't order anything, not just for the fact that we couldn't change the cheese but for the poor customer service.",,,

From the outside, it's more like a bar serving beer than burgers. The inside is dim but on the cozy side with bar stools and high tables (which are sticky from settled oil splatter).There are a variety of burger selections but you're not overhelmed with too many choices. We ordered the Black Iron Burger and the Hashbrown Burger which are moderately priced (definitely on the higher $$ side).No doubt that the burgers were very juicy and tasty. If you're a calorie counter, these burgers are not for you. But if your a red meat eater, you'll definitely enjoy the meal.Black Iron Burger isn't a ""family friendly"" type of restaurant because it's more of a bar serving burgers.

This place is the truth. Everthing from the beer options to the loaded fries was exactly as advertised; amazing! I had the awesome turkey burger with the herb garlic fries and my friend had a regular burger with the amazing loaded fires. The food arrived at our table fresh, hot and loades with flavor. I must confess, I was not expecting much but isn't that typical of those hidden gems.  Yes, if Black Iron Burger Shop sticks to what they have been doing, I'm convinced that they will remain a hit!

Smaller place that probably only holds 15 people.  My favorite part of the meal were the aioli fries. $8. It was the perfect amount of aioli and bacon to let the fri taste show. They were a little crispy and very good. Get them!! I also had the black iron burger which I highly recommend. $11 It was very juicy with a subtle grilled onion and aioli taste. The onions were caramelized just right.  I could have used less bun but overall it was a very good burger.They had a great selection of beer. $7. I had a lighter German Oktoberfest beer and a left hand milk stout. My girlfriend had the toasted lager from blue point. Service was pretty standard.

91,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",376,679,30567,4.0,1/19/2016,"not sure why it's called Black Iron Burger then again i don't care bc the burgers are baller, the sides can be mains, and the milkshakes bring everyone to the yard.... seewhatididtherei order Black Iron Burger East (Alphabet City) via seamless and visit the brick n mortar location fairly regular when i am HANGRY!the space itself is softly lit, but still fairly bright...your snapchat and instagram pics will need the flash though. the space itself is pretty small. however they utilize it well. the front area is dominated by the bar and grill. so for you solo types you can sit at the bar, drink beer, savage a burger and watch the game on the flatty above the bar. there are also several two-top high tables who don't need to be close to the bar. there is one or two four tops in this area that can prolly seat five if you squeeze in. pushing further back there is another four-top, another two-top, and a booth that probably seats 4-6 (this is the only backed seating) everything else is bar-ish stools with no backs.the decor/ambience is very chill and subdued. dark and medium woods throughout. fairly subdued lighting. some eclectic decor pieces and the casualness of handwritten specials etc. on the wall mirrors. there's fair amount of mirrors and reflective surface to give the space a lot more size. well played. condiments line the walls in holder (ketchup, mustard, n grey poupon/you don't have to wait on staff...you can dress your burgers, fries, and onion rings yourself...plastic forks, spoons, knives, napkins and such are there as well. ) the food? great as long as you have your expectations in check and choose things that you like to eat. if you are looking for cheap burgers, go away. if you are looking for $9ish-$10ish burgers made from antibiotic/steroid free meat then you're in the right place--and that's a great value and taste to be had in the east village. it's clear they use premium natural ingredients as it comes through in their burgers and sides. my current favorites here is the HASHBROWN BURGER (sloppy patty goodness: two 4 oz burger patties, cheese, tartar sauce, and a crunchy thin potato pancake...YUM! The PATTY MELT, giant burger patty, swissh cheese, caramelized onions on buttered rye...burger melt my appetite with an overload of meat n cheese. And finally THE MASTERPIECE: two 4 oz. patties, swiss cheese, grilled onions, fried egg and BACON, giant burger for a giant appetite...well worth the calories! ha. you can also do build-your-own burgers here. the sides: if you like ONION RINGS, get'em here. they are fresh and made to order. YASSSS. and the Loaded Fries are amazing: smothered in cheese, bacon, and ranch sauce...the sides are very shareable and perfect for 2-3 people who have also ordered burgers. the beer selection is solid. nothing blew my hair back, but the beer choices pair nicely with eats. i like me some McKenzies Hard Cider with heavier burgers and the Left Hand Milk Stout when i'm just snacking on sides. ORDER. A. MILK. SHAKE. DO. IT. sweet smooth thick sugar dairy death by straw, MY RANT about other CHEAPER burger places: why are people complaining about the prices at Black Iron Burger? ever wonder why OTHER places with cheaper burgers don't state that they use steroid/antibiotic free meat...umm, it's because many other burger places don't..these burger places use terrible quality ingredients...so have fun with the Big C. that's why i love Black Iron Burger: they use quality ingredients and deliver a value for a decent price. keep in mind Black Iron Burger is a true sitdown burger meal experience...it's not fast food. the staff. very casual. chill, friendly. they make mistakes but are quick to remedy. like the last time i was here. we ordered beers. and were informed something was out. waitress was on top of it with our beer order quickly. or they mischarged another tables bill on the credit card, but were quick to catch the error afterward and give us receipts showing the error and correction. there do seem to be a fair amount of credit card issues at this place, so mind your bill carefully and make sure you were charged the right amount after you leave. i don't think anything nefarious is going on just a touch of mistakes by greener staff.overall i'd say Black Iron Burger is a solid date night, grab burgers n beers after a rough work day,  or small group hang. you can watch sports here but i wouldn't camp here bc it can get cramped. Seamless ordering from here has been error free--and the burgers n fries were piping hot. i do wish that the happy hour and specials were better priced...they seem pretty meh to me. drops mic because these burger require two-hand handling!i out.zzz",28,25,27

The Black Iron Burger was like a gift from God, and The Masterpiece was like if Michelangelo could turn the Sistine Chapel ceiling into a burger. The Onion Rings were great with a really tasty homemade ranch aioli and the Garlic Parsley fries were the perfect pair with either burger. Not to mention they had an extensive craft beer selection and the pricing was extremely reasonable, ESPECIALLY when compared to other restaurants lauding the ""best burger in NYC."" Last but not least, they've got milkshakes made with homemade ice cream. If this doesn't prove you need to go there and try it for yourself, you probably don't deserve it. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone!",,,

They want the place to do well and they do well by you. I've gotten 2 pints on the house just sitting here. I'm cute, but these guys are genuinely great and the burgers are delicious. I've been to the other location in Chelsea and the device is also friendly, but this spot is a little more tucked away.

111,Elvin M.,"New York, NY",23,1,0,5.0,5/25/2016,"By far, one of the best burger spots around. Our waiter Marlon was a great host. Alfie, Jason and the rest of the staff were great hosts. Everyone was very attentive and courteous.Now to the food... I ordered The Black Iron with everything in it. It was delicious. The beef was nice and tender. Also ordered the Ai-Oli fries; they were delicious as well. The bacon and the ranch dressing on top give the fries a great taste.Overall my experience at The Black Iron Burger Shop was great and would definitely recommend any burger lover to stop by and try them out.We'll see you guys soon!",,,
112,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",264,538,119,1.0,11/22/2015,"After having such a great experience at the Black Iron burger location in Midtown, I decided to check out this location three weeks later and oh boy, was it a major disappointment!First of all, the restaurant itself threw me off - it's a very old school looking pub-type restaurant, which was totally not the case in the Midtown location that I went to. There are only a handful of rickety tables and chairs, and it's relatively cramped in there as well.The first red flag was that this location did not have the Wasabi Burger in its menu, which was the only reason I wanted to come back to Black Iron so soon. This is hugely deceiving as I would only assume that the same restaurant chain would carry the same burgers, which I even confirmed on its online menu (for this specific location). So I settled and got The Masterpiece with jalapeños (which was an extra 25 cents). After my boyfriend and I already placed in our order, our waiter decided this was the best time to let us know that their credit/debit card machines are down and they are only accepting cash (even though Yelp stated that this place does take card, and so did the other location) and that there is an ATM machine outside of the restaurant. We already put in our order at that point so we were pretty much forced to take out cash. On top of that, these ATM machines are so sneaky that my boyfriend was charged twice for taking cash out...so he paid $5 to take out his own money. Wonderful, right? It gets better.I also want to keep in mind that we came on a cloudy Saturday afternoon, so it was not packed at all - there were only 2 other tables besides ours. Some other red flags:1. It was a longer than expected wait for our food, strange since since we both asked for our burgers to be medium rare. At least 20-25 minutes.2. Our server initially gave us another table's order - honestly, how do you mess up on this when you're manning the only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant?3. I never got the jalapeños that I asked for in my burger and on top of that, the ""hash brown"" on my boyfriend's burger was actually a measly lump of potato, which we actually struggled to find in the burger at first (yes, we looked for it after not finding the jalapeños in mine)Don't get me wrong, my burger was great (perhaps a little lacking in the salt department), and the loaded fries were good too, but the overall experience of the restaurant and the service itself really made a huge difference. I came in hopeful and left extremely disappointed and agitated. Black Iron, you were a very promising brand, but you have some serious consistency issues.",1,,
113,Mahnaz N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,5/24/2016,"This location is small. They don't have the wasabi burger like the uptown locations. I asked bartender, Pablo, which was the darkest beer and he immediately let me sample three before I decided. You may read elsewhere online that they don't take credit cards but they most certainly do. A little disappointed about the wasabi burger but the ""masterpiece"" was great!",,,
114,JiaChen X.,"Manhattan, NY",212,4,0,5.0,3/24/2017,"Best burger joint in the east village. I get either the chicken club sandwich or the masterpiece.

It wasn't only mine either, my friend's burger also had cold buns. The yuca chips with guac weren't bad, and the fries were eh-- thin, straight cut, too hard.

121,Alena G.,"Brooklyn, NY",273,149,17,4.0,3/17/2014,"Note: this is a 4.5-star review.Got a Groupon for 2 drinks, 2 sides, 2 burgers (some $ limits on those items, but you can pay the difference if you opt for the more expensive options) for $18 which, you'll learn, is nothing for the quality of the food we received.The place is really small, laden with TVs and a great music selection. A ketchup addict myself, I was psyched to see the falls lined with Heinz bottles. I don't have to feel exceptionally awkward requesting extra condiments! Woo hoo!We ordered a Sprite and a Crispin Cider (drinks come in handle-less mason jars, very cool) and got to reviewing the menu. I ended up going with the Masterpiece and the loaded fries. The Boy had the Black Iron burger and the onion rings.We passed the time (seemed to be a 15-20 minute wait, but you can watch your meal be prepared right in the bar area) by sipping on the drinks and watching the Amazing Race on the TV. The burgers came out first, smelling heavenly, and the sides followed (not) shortly after. Breakdown:- The Boy had the horseradish mayo on the side, and I suggest you do the same, if you can't handle the heat. Us, Russians, dump horseradish on everything, so it was a nice little condiment to have on the side. - The Masterpiece was delicious and cooked to perfection. Not too overwhelming size-wise, but more than filling for a late night dinner.- LOVED the loaded fries. Get them.- The onion rings I could live without - too thin and crispy for my taste.There was some confusion about the Groupon at the end, but it was resolved with an unprompted $5 gift card and a new bill. Overall - this place serves a great burger and yummy sides. Small venue, but cozy for a dinner for 2.",3,,

I normally get the ai-oli fries which are delicious or I get the onion rings which are thin and crunchy and the onion doesn't pull out of the batter (which I hate!).

123,Jess G.,"New York, NY",137,142,277,4.0,3/30/2014,"Do not be fooled by their small space bc this place is constantly packed with ppl enjoying a delicious burger/fries. The burgers and the fries are out of this world! I would stick to the masterpiece $10 and the loaded fries $6 (comes with a sauce and bacon on top). This combination is seriously a heart attack waiting to happen, but the tasty meal is just so worth it! They also have a number of diff beer selections in addition to wine, soft drinks and shakes. (The portions of the fries are rather large and could be shared btwn 2 unless you are extremely hungry then I suggest getting your own side order). I did notice ppl walking in to take advantage of their pitchers and their TV with no need to actually order food. They also play background music (top 40) making this a delightful place. I have been here for lunch/ dinner and have found it to be just as equally packed. I suggest traveling with no more than 4 ppl bc there will be no space for a large group to sit together. Waiter is also attentive. He is constantly walking around and being available but not annoying by repeatedly asking if you need anything. I really appreciate that of a place! Seriously, just go!! It will not disappoint.Side note: there is a $18 groupon available that includes a burger, side, and drink for two...maybe want to check it out!",2,,1

It was a dingy, little hole in the wall place and one of my friends said they have amazing burgers. They have a beer bar with a pretty limited selection of beers. I ordered The Masterpiece burger and it was quite good, but not mind blowing. However, being as hungry as I was, I gulped it down in just a few large bites. I also ordered wings. They were not pre-sauced which was a bummer. In this instance, the pro was the very good burger. The cons were the wings and lack of beer/ drink selection. 3 stars",,,

When he brought us our drinks, there was a piece of dry lettuce on one of the glasses. When we brought it to his attention, he stated, ""well, it's on the outside of the glass,"" as he was trying to get us to accept a beer in a dirty glass with dried food on the rim. Are you kidding me? I was about to knock the little guy on his ass. When we were done with our food, the waiter was nowhere to be found for 10+ minutes, so we had to go to the bar to ask for the check. I will never come back to this place again and it has actually left me with a poor impression of the East Village in general. You get what you pay for.

He'll definitely take care of you while he's there during your meal.I recently moved away from the area, and the only good news is that perhaps I will loose a bit of weight without BIB being so close.

Let me tell you, the first bite was some greasy goodness. I love me some burgers that ooze and drip all over the place, and this delivered. My hand was greasier than Uncle Jesse's hair from Full House! Oh and the meat was cooked perfect and the saltiness of the bacon went well with the sweetness of the caramelized onions.

The food is really solid, the environment is fun, the quality is high.The burgers seem well-loved by meat-eaters. My veggie burger was totally decent, made super-enjoyable by the condiments (as you may know, I live for sauce.) The patty itself was nothing to write home about, but I'm used to that -- and really, it wasn't BAD! Just a little dry and not that flavorful on its own. The buns are awesome though, as are the selection of toppings and sauces. We had onion rings too -- they're very thin and flavorful. A small portion (which I actually prefer, but some might complain about. Seemed like the right amount to eat, which is kind of a lot less than you're usually served.) The place is cute -- pretty small and I don't think there are any regular chairs to sit in -- all stools. So if you have any physical issues that make bar stools uncomfortable, it's a good thing to be aware of. We sat in the one booth there, which is cute, though pretty smushed in the corner, and only comfortable on one side! (It was fine, really.)My one complaint -- which is really not BIB's fault in particular -- is that our waiter called us ""ladies"" even though we weren't all ""ladies"" and frankly, even as a ""lady"" I don't appreciate this convention. We mentioned it to  the waitress, and she was very nice and apologetic about it, so I don't mean to criticize her in particular, but I'd love to see the norms in the service industry get a little less hyper-gendered in the coming years so I figure it's worth noting here.",,,

152,Jana W.,"San Diego, CA",35,29,37,5.0,2/11/2015,"Apparently for a long time this place hasn't had its act together, but they've sure got it figured out now! I can't believe I didn't know this place existed until now. A lot of people claim they know where to get the best burger in New York City (no, not Shake Shack), but this place is right up there with the best of them.I went there with a friend. We each had a burger and split an order of Herb Garlic Fries, and a pitcher of beer. It came to about $30 each, including tip. Obviously you can cut the price way down if you nix the beer. The fries were good. Nothing to write home about, but definitely enjoyable. But oh the burgers! I got the Black Iron Burger. I was afraid that it might be a little too heavy on the horseradish, but it was balanced perfectly. The bun was light and soft. And the double patties cooked to medium-rare perfection. My friend got the Wasabi Burger and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.It's a little hole in the wall, so it's small and the seating is a bit cramped. But that just adds to the character of the place, which was nice and casual, in a divey intimate kind of way. We were there on a Tuesday night so there was some seating available, but I imagine it probably gets pretty packed on weekends.Our server was nice and attentive. No complaints there.Also, they are no longer cash-only so feel free to bust out the credit card!All in all, it was a great experience. It's hands-down my new favorite burger joint. I will absolutely be back, especially since it's only a few blocks away from my favorite bar, Double Down.",1,,1

157,Karly B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,9,4.0,4/14/2013,"Strolling in the East Village, we craved a Burger. I had read about Black Iron in Zagat and was excited to try it. We showed up around 4 and had the place to ourselves. We opted to sit at the bar instead of the hightops surrounding it. It is a pretty small space with a casual atmosphere. Ketchup and mustard line the walls, there are drawings of butchers knives and photographs of burgers and really good music playing (Funk, Aretha Franklin and Michael Jackson).     The bar, only serving wine and beer, had 10 really good beers on tap and Daryl (our awesome bartender) there to pour them. After settling into our beers we started to look at the paper menus. If you are going the burger route, you have to option of building your own or choosing one of their specialty burgers. They also have a variety of sandwiches (like a Lobster Roll Bahn Mi!) and yummy appetizers.     I decided to build my own burger. Got a cheddar cheese burger with bacon, grilled onions with spicy mayo and an order of fries. T got the A.BLT (yes that A stands for avocado!!) Once our orders were in we got to watch our food being made.The tiny open kitchen is behind the bar and it fills the place up with the smell of beef, which is always a good thing.    With our mouths watering from the sight and smell of our food being cooked right in front of us we finally got to dig in. My burger was cooked to a perfect medium (just a little pink) and topped with everything I wanted, served on a toasted bun. The A.BLT was also very good. The fries were nothing to write home about, but the spicy mayo was addictive.     After we finished our food the place really started to fill up. We contemplated ordering a milkshake for dessert, but decided to just have another beer and chat with Daryl. That one more beer turned into a few more and we left pleasantly full and a little bit buzzed. Black Iron is exactly what it looks like; a no fuss burger joint with great food made the way you like it and yummy beer to chase it down with. The service is really approachable and friendly and the cost totally reasonable. I will definitely be back to Black Iron.",1,,1

I was told that I can go right outside and use their ATM where their business will BENEFIT FROM ME by charging me a service fee for their mishap. I tried going to other ATMs in the area but none of them were working, even the Chase ATM at Duane Reade a few blocks away. 3. I was charged twice for the using the their ATM!! 4. They brought the WRONG ORDER to my table and when we received the right order, there were side orders MISSING. The ADDITIONAL TOPPINGS on my burger WERE MISSING TOO. This was during the day with one other couple in the restaurant for a TOTAL OF 4 CUSTOMERS. BUSY? NOT AT ALL.ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER REVIEWS BELOW, THERE ARE MANY FAKE REVIEWS!!!! Someone at this place is periodically adding reviews so this place can maintain at least 4 stars on Yelp. Stick to Umami or Shake Shack and not this sketchy establishment.

Too much oil, couldn't even finish it. The beers were okay. But with tax and tips, we end up paying an extra 12.00 dollars. He added an automatic gratitude of 20%.

Came here on a Wednesday night (2/10) and the place was packed! We were a party of three and to my surprise the server that has served me at the midtown location also happened to be here! She immediately took care of us. Told us it would be 15 minutes or so. While waiting we were mesmerized because this location is so small and you can see the kitchen! Yep, you can see the whole magic!- the kitchen is super small and you there were two cooks just synchronized doing a bunch of burgers, fries everything to perfection! They have their game on. The most amazing part? We noticed that our server happened to be running the whole place by herself! This girl had everything on point. She never left a table behind. Mind you the bar was full, the floor, and she was doing the drinks too! To any other server this would have been an impossible task, but she was never seeing angry, or annoyed. She was always smiling! Always checking on us and everyone. Best service. Very people's person. Kathy you rock!  I don't know if it's me, but the burgers at east village location happened to be tastier than any of their locations. Maybe it's because you see how your burgers are cooked, but the meat was juicier.

The Master Burger had bacon and fried egg, and in this case the hardest thing to nail is the egg. The chef cooked it to perfection- runny yolk with a fully cooked white. Kudos. My Black Iron had horseradish cheddar and horseradish sauce, which was spicy but not overwhelming. It's strange how you don't see horseradish much on burger menus considering how well it pairs with beef. Kudos again.The burgers were so good I almost forgot to mention THE BEER.

The United States of America and Russia were in a nuclear standoff until Vladimir Putin discovered the legendary sword of King Author, Excalibur, which had been lost since the Dark Ages. Upon pulling Excalibur out of stone it had been lodged in beyond time, Putin unleashed the spirit of Samael, the Great Seducer and Destroyer, the Chief Ruler of the Fifth Heaven, the Archangel of Death, which latched on to Putin's soul. ""I shall grant you immeasurable power, if you aid me in eradicating the plague that is human emotion,"" Samael offered Putin.""It's a heavy cost, but I'd pay it gladly,"" said Putin.200 years later...Humankind is devoid of feelings. Putin, a now demi-god, has instituted a mandatory daily regimen for a chemical injection of a compound produced by Monsanto, Prozius, which blocks all human emotions. Enforcement officers, known as The Talmud, are trained since birth to detect and eradicate anyone who is not taking their medication; any 'feelers.'You are The Absolute, the highest ranking of all the Talmuds, feared across the planet by all. You are on a routine raid,  neutralizing members of the resistance at one of their headquarters, the Black Iron Burger Shop. Famished from combat, you grab The Black Iron Burger that was sitting at the bar, a 8oz double patty all natural beef with horseradish cheddar, caramelized grilled white onions and horseradish mayo. It is the greatest thing you have ever tasted. It makes you...feel. ""Sir I'm reading a spike in emoti..."" says an enforcer as you shoot him in the head and proceed to eliminate the rest of your squad.

And open up more Black Iron Burger Shops.Halfway across the globe...Vladimir Putin's eyes slowly open as he rises from a coffin made of dragon bones. ""The time has finally come, he is here,"" he hisses to himself. ""I can feel his awakening. Is this the best you can do?

They blue cheese is not spread out evenly so the part that lacked it was also dry. Luckily I did have a coleslaw side. It was refreshing and fresh. The fries are very crispy and a little salty.

When you come here don't expect to be seated at an elegant table with superb service because you will be super disappointed. Come here with no expectations except for singing taste buds. Who needs a good server when your mouth is so happy? Seriously ignore the eh service, ignore the eh appetizers and enjoy the Delicious burgerEnjoy!!",,,1
198,Wilson C.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,33,2,4.0,6/22/2013,"I was stuck between 3 or 4 stars for this but decided to lean towards a 4 because of the bad ass name and convenience of being right across my friend's place and us being lazy to find food around the East Village.  Black Iron Burger puts itself out there as a burger joint (which is the main reason we decided to try there) rather than a bar, but once you step inside, it has a tight, small bar atmosphere.The burger was on point and was cooked very well.  Although it did take awhile for our order (not to mention, they were very busy on Saturday night), it was worth it at the end.  I ordered ""The Masterpiece"" (and indeed it was) which had an egg, two patties, bacon, onions and cheese and completely satisfied my burger craving.  It wasn't on their online menu, so I'm guessing there are more burgers and other specials on their physical menu.My friend and I picked up our burgers to go but stayed in the bar/shop and it was very small inside and had small tables so it would be a good idea to go with only a friend or two.  I didn't get to try the fries or onion rings they had, so I will definitely look forward to that the next time I'm in the East village and craving a big, fat, mean, juicy burger.",2,,1
199,E W.,"Fort Worth, TX",9,58,0,5.0,2/24/2014,"Seriously.....OMG!!!!! The burgers are insanely good. Off the charts yummy. The shakes are incredible. The atmosphere is chill, laid back and relaxing.I always get the horseradish cheddar burger with the caramelized onions and a chocolate shake. When I don't put ketchup on a burger...you know it's amazing.Love coming here for a lil bite in an unpretentious relaxed atmosphere. Staff is very cool too. Helpful, not overly solicitous and warm.Can't wait to go back again.",,,
