The number of times I've passed it on the way to Murray's bagels is embarrassing.The staff is nice and service is quick! I got The everything bagel with egg cheese and sausage, toasted with a fresh squeezed OJ for a little under $8! This hit the spot & i will def be back!",2,2,3

They didn't have Salt Bagels. Grant got an everything Bagel with Bacon, Eggs, and Cheese. I had Chorizo, Eggs, and Cheese on an Egg Bagel. They were smaller than usual. The eggs were freshly cracked and cooked. The meat was lacking and cheese was barely melted. Overall, it was okay but definitely a quicker alternative to Murrays Bagels down the street.",3,2,1

Updated review","No joke, BEST coffee and non rip-off pricing. The place looks like a nothing hole-in-the-wall but they kick Murray's tuchas all the way with their superior coffee, bagels and authentic Mexican Soft-Corn Tacos that few know about. Usually, I order in from here, wish they'd update the place but love the eager-to-please hombres here! Mil Gracias!!!",1,2,
6,Alisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",138,49,65,1.0,6/10/2017,This place is unclean. The person making your bagels does not change his gloves and when I informed them of a cockroach on their counter he said oh okay thank you and shrugged it off. I got the f out of there before - I knew for sure I'd get sick if I ate there.,4,3,
7,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,3.0,8/20/2016,"Went here in search of the best bagel in NYC--unfortunately, I still haven't found it.I decided to go with a toasted pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese. While it came out extremely quickly (2 minutes?), it lacked the freshness and size that some other places around the area have been able to achieve. Nonetheless, this place is great on the weekend as there was barely a line and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes.",1,1,1
8,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,123,70,2.0,12/9/2015,"Do not take this place for a real bagel shop. It's not. They have a basic selection of starchy bagels, though I don't know where they are trucked in from... the word 'bagel' shouldn't even be in their name (it's more of a quick/greasy lunch & sandwich joint). I think they offer nova salmon, but I didn't trust it here. I'll save my craving for another venue. Would I return? Ha. There are too many good (& legitimate) options nearby, at least for breakfast. Lunch? I'll pass. I don't know who is boosting this place with 4-5 stars, but whoever it is, please stop comparing places to the Path Station holes you frequent. Come above ground, come up for air, and treat yourself better. Don't give a place 5 stars just because their dingy fluorescent bulbs aren't burned out.",2,3,

Don't be fooled by the appearance, looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is outstanding. - Bagels are fresh and flavorful- Breakfast sandwiches are simple and delicious- Mexican dishes are AMAZING! The tortas, burritos and nachos are to die for... much better than any Mexican restaurant in the areaThey pay attention to special instructions and the staff is SO friendly, both in person and when delivering. 5 stars for sure!!",1,,

Updated review","So I don't pop in here very often, as it may have sounded in my initial post. Stopped in yesterday after a long hiatus, and frankly I am not seeing where I justified the 4th star. The bagels are average. Yes, it is conveniently located right outside the PATH station, but there is a better bagel just 1 block south. It took me until today to walk that extra block...",2,,
16,Sam L.,"Wellesley Hills, MA",234,2,0,2.0,6/15/2017,"I went because of the Yelp reviews, but left disappointed. I was looking for a better deal than Murray's with an equivalent quality but did not find it. The bagel tasted store-bought and was dry and lacked flavor.",,2,
17,Jackie M.,"Chicago, IL",194,479,220,4.0,8/1/2014,"Got off the Path looking for a bagel shop and I didn't realize i was standing right next to one!There are a bunch of signs with plates of delicious looking sandwiches and fries displayed on the window, on the street, inside all around the walls, that I didn't think there were bagels until I yelped it. So much food and everything looks super appetizing. Got the lox and bagel - yummy! There's so much to pick from besides bagels.",1,,1
18,Obie F.,"GA, GA",121,3,1,3.0,12/14/2015,Food quality okay but cashier was too distracted to get my order right on first or second try. Then ended up with such a pathetic little smear of veggie cream cheese on my bagel that had to ask for more. Disappointing.,,,

Updated review",Not only is the food amazing (best bagels in New York) but their service is incredible. I'm not used to nice people in nyc and Bagel Buffet has the best customer service. I've ordered from here 20+ times and they've always arrived way earlier than expected. I love this place and definitely recommend!!!!!,,,
20,Nicole H.,"Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,0,1.0,11/6/2016,"Placed an order on seamless.. gave me hot chocolate instead of coffee, and whole wheat bagels instead of plain. The bagels also were hard and seemed like they were days old. Speedy delivery but I wouldn't order or go here again.",,,

Overall HORRIBLE customer service!",,,
23,Jennifer M.,"Belleville, NJ",389,686,35,5.0,2/28/2014,These are the best bagels around. I order off of seamless at least once and week and the delivery is so fast. Always less than a half hour and they've never messed up my order.Highly recommend.,2,,1
24,April Y.,"New York, NY",11,14,7,5.0,2/27/2015,"Really good bagels here. I usually get the lox spread on a savory toasted bagel and it's great.

25,Andrew K.,"San Francisco, CA",71,55,0,4.0,2/20/2013,"Small deli on 6th ave just south of 14th st. most people walk by, but the regulars keep going back. While it's called Famous Bagel Buffet...don't let the name fool you....the tacos and tortas here are amazing! I got back each week and either get a set of tacos or a torta (usually salted beef). I have a friend from mexico who also goes back weekly for his torta fix. i recommend this place to everyone in the neighborhood.",2,,1

I almost don't want to write this review for fear of it being discovered, but it's seriously the best breakfast place I've tried in my three years in New York. I order it on the Seamless app on my phone before I stop at the subway and it's always waiting for me when I arrive at my office. Personal favorite is the whole wheat everything bagel or the egg, turkey bacon and cheese sandwich but it's all good!",1,1,1

35,Michael M.,"New York, NY",55,40,0,2.0,10/26/2014,Not sure why this place has all the positive reviews. Second time I've been here for breakfast and was disappointed. A bacon egg and cheese sandwich (which only comes with a single egg so it's pretty much just a piece of toast) and a cup of coffee cost $8. I'd be fine with if the sandwich was amazing but it's far from it. Much better off going to Murrays or the old sandwich shop.,,1,
36,James C.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,11/9/2013,"This place is so much more convenient and less stressful than going to Murray's down the street.

It is always cheap, always tastes the same, and the same dudes that always work in there are so sweet. Â My only complaint is how giant the menu is...I can never decide what I want and then I get the same thing every time (the chicken pita wrap special with white sauce) and it's always delicious. The food also comes out really quickly, like in less than 5 minutes, which is a plus because I just order it there on the spot. Â The bagels are really good too, and even with a fancy spread, are cheaper than Murray's which is a block down, and takes way too long. Bagel Buffet represent!",2,2,2
39,Josh C.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",1,6,0,4.0,3/28/2012,"I really like these guys. Honestly, not the best-est-ever bagels in the world, but they're good enough. And when it comes to delivery they are on top of it (most of the time). A lot faster than other places that are the same distance or closer to me. And they're nice dudes. Plus, they're delivery minimum is like six bucks and I'm a cheap bastard. Works for me!",,1,

43,Lisa J.,"Springfield, NJ",0,10,0,2.0,8/31/2011,"I used to like their bagels toasted with cream cheese and jelly. One day i went to the store to order it. They didnt have the plain bagel so the guy at the back took the sesame bagel and scrapped the sesame off the bagel and served it to me as plain. I found couple of the sesame on top of the bagel plus now their toasted bagel is like eating a HARD ROCK! They are over priced you will be spending about $7 with bagel, cream cheese and jelly with ice coffee. I now Stopped eating from this place where they dont value the customers.",,,
