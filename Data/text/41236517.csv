0,Tiffany B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",4,14,0.0,4.0,11/11/2018,"It's hard to give a review for a place like this. It's true that the people working at Amrita aren't the most warm or welcoming people. But don't take it personally. Also, I don't always need people to be. The coffee drinks are good, but what really draws me in is the QUICHE. The quiche is always excellent and delicious and I have dragged people there just for the quiche. Lots of tables, always a hodge podge of people there.",,,
1,Gidgets S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,56,0.0,3.0,9/8/2018,"I came here on a weekday evening to get some work done on my laptop.  The lights were dimmed and the atmosphere was dive bar-like, however; this didn't bother me at all and I didn't feel out of place or unwelcome.  The place is spacious, so there were plenty of tables available; some people were drinking at the bar and socializing, others, like me, were working, and all seemed to be coexisting fine.  The food was ok.  I ordered a meatball sandwich with a side salad.  Standard bar food, good portion, average value for the price.  You have to order your food at the counter and pay for it there, too.  My only issue with this is, when you pay your bill on the ipad, you're pretty much forced to tip at least 18%.  This seems a little absurd to me, given that you're not even really being served.  I would still return to do some work over a beer or coffee, although I would probably not order a full meal again.In summary--Pros:-you can sit here for a long time doing whatever you like (socializing or working on laptop) without being bothered by the staff, at least during non-peak times-reliable wi-fi, not spotty at all-friendly, relaxed, casual vibeCons:-understaffed; not much service available-you still have to tip a high percentage even though you're not being served-average quality food-not the greatest value (not expensive, but not cheap either)",,,
2,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,8/24/2018,"Chill spot near Morningside Park where there's not much else around. Tasty strong sangria that will sneak up on you.Laid back and chill vibe. To me it resembles a dive bar version of Starbucks. Kind of like a cafe and bar, but certainly not fancy at all. My one gripe is that they need to crank up the AC. On a warm night when I was there it's not fun to be all sweaty and try to enjoy your drink.Bar snacks, pizza, sandwiches, and other assorted food items to nosh on. Full-ish bar, beer, coffees, and sangria. Not too pricey but not really that cheap. Kind of in the middle for what it was. Happy hour helped.Plenty of seating although it's not that large of a spot. Outside seating on the sidewalk too. Free wifi is available. Bathroom located in the back behind the bar was surprisingly clean. Some flatscreens with news or sports playing. A really relaxed locals joint.Say hello to Gio the bartender if he is on duty. He's a righteous dude.",27,15,24
3,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",452,484,1951,3.0,3/25/2018,"This place really deserves more stars for a number of personal reasons. However, I'm not certain those reasons would be equally as appealing to the average crowd. Cafe Amrita is a cafe by day and a local hangout for those who get it's vibe by night. When you first walk in, you may be fooled into thinking that the laptops, coffee and pastries indicate that this is a mom and pop version of Starbucks. If you believe this, you'd be missing out on a unique experience. They have a varied menu which includes breakfast items, sandwiches and finger foods.  Their coffee is decent but I mostly stop by this place in the afternoon. They offer Stella Artois on draft and have a fully stocked bar. The service is always friendly and relaxed. I find myself having conversations with staff and other patrons in a way that makes this place an inviting cafe in my travels.The well maintained bathroom is in the back beyond the bar.  They feature a number of televisions that readily offer sports and/or news and usually honor channel requests.It is not for everyone but at the same time it has a little bit of everything.  This winner definitely fits the bill with affordable prices and a happy hour that can't be beat.",16,7,11

They have a surprisingly large selection of Mexican apps which I will be back to taste test - guacamole, salsa and tacos. Their sandwiches are a favorite among the regulars. The grilled chicken panini was ordered again and again. There is also beer on tap, espresso based drinks, teas and pellegrino. As well as an assortment of baked goods.

7,Megan O.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,27,0,2.0,9/25/2018,"Came here for lunch with my mom and husband on a Saturday afternoon. My mom and I ordered sandwiches and my husband ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. My husband's pancakes came right away but it took forever for my mom and I to get our sandwiches. In fact, I eventually walked up to the bar to get them because I saw them sitting there and no one was bringing them even though there was table service.  My husband's bacon came with the sandwiches nearly 15 minutes after his pancakes.  The server said it was because it was busy but it was not really busy at all, there were lots of empty tables.  Also, the bathroom was out of toilet paper.  So the service was bad but (credit where credit is due) the pancakes were really good.",,,

It was a quiet evening with just a few people in the cafe. About an hour passed before a waiter approached her and demanded to know what she bought and why she was sitting there. She told him she purchases a cookie an hour before and that she was simply getting some work done. He curtly responded 'Well, that's the point. We're closing in 20 minutes.' She would have very well understood she needed to leave due to the hours but the fact that he said it so brashly and assumed she was just loitering makes me and my sister think twice about ever stopping here again. Politeness goes a long way and should still count for something, even when it's late and you as a worker are tired. We are still customers who deserve respect.",1,,

The bagel was perfect. Chewy, warm and crisp on the outside and the butter tasted like real butter. The latte was so so but it wasn't atrocious. I rate it 2.5/5 but went up to 3 stars as a lady had a service dog and wasn't harassed about it and it was a good sit down spot.

The food here is decent and is fairly priced, so for college students in the area or first-time visitors looking for a nearby place to eat, I highly recommend! I got the broccoli and cheese quiche with an iced coffee with caramel and cinnamon, also very tasty. But if you're looking for something fancy, I would look elsewhere.

Deducting two stars for the staff - rude, unhelpful, in no hurry to get to you.

It is been few early mornings in a row I have been there because I fall for the coffee. But today I wanted to share my disappointing experience and feedback, maybe management can take as advises. I run into the coffee shop a little bit before 7:30am on Wednesday morning, see 2 employees inside, the TV turned on, but doors closed, after knocking with insistance for few minutes, finally the women indicated me with her 2 hands fully open the number 10. In between, there is no hours on the door. Well, here is my point, you have 2 employees in the shop, even if they are doing some set up for the opening. Why are you turning down customers?There is not even a table service, you can order your cup of coffee at the counter on the to go. There is also seatings inside and outside after you order at the counter. The food is industrial pastries, my idea, they should replace that by fresh viennoiseries with good croissant. Also do a deep cleaning, but overall the atmosphere is great. Too sad they operate without consistency and random store hours.",,,

My friend went to the bar to order a chicken Caesar salad wrap for me. First the waiter brought a tuna fish wrap; I reminded them of the order. Then he brought a Caesar wrap. Without chicken. I brought it back to the bar. ""Oh,"" the bartender said.

It has a decent amount of outdoor seating next to the park, which makes for a pleasant experience when the weather is nice. And it has a chill yet interesting indoor vibe. But the service is subpar. There's a woman at the counter who seems too hard pressed for time to take your order. As if you being there is burdensome to her. And there's a guy who goes around during the weekend and asks people to put away their laptops during brunch hours. I think that's a fair policy, but they never specify what brunch hours are. So they can ask someone to put their laptop away at 4:00, when in most people's minds, that's not brunch hours anymore.",,,

I get the chai tea latte and go sit down to get started on some of my work. The chai tea latte was middling to bad, and definitely disappointing for the steep price of 5 dollars for a medium.

It took over 30 mins to get it on a baguette and cold! The manager (new guy) proceeds to tell me that's a new kind of ciabatta and at that point I was starving so I started eating it. Please look at the picture and tell me that is not a baguette! He must have felt bad because he came to my table later and reimbursed me for the sandwich but I was still mad at the service and the fact that he lied to my face.

This past weekend when I went there was a new lady I've never seen before. She made me an awful chai latte. I asked for almond milk and happened to be watching her make the drink, which she used whole milk for. There's a reason I asked for almond milk and I also paid extra for it. I'm glad I saw her do it because I asked her to make it correctly. It essentially tasted like water and chai concentrate. It was such a bummer and a crummy start to my day.

I ordered a double cappuccino which was fantastic, and and egg and ham sandwich on a croissant which they prep from scratch just behind the bar. The atmosphere was quaint and homey, with a wooden bar and tables and even a bookshelf with books in the back. There's no sense of pretentiousness that you sometimes find in hipster cafes. Staff was very friendly and quick to get me my order. Also, they play good music at a medium noise level. Giving 4 stars only because I cannot speak to their consistency over time or across the menu.

58,Boomer L.,"New York, NY",1,13,0,1.0,12/16/2016,"This place has subpar food and a decent ambiance. I could deal with that for a place to just hang out and write etc. The music during the day and the early afternoon is just great--a mixture of all kinds of pleasant jazz.But they can do away with the awful hip-hop music they start playing after 3 pm when the night- shift takes over. For some reason, they feel that music and that volume is appropriate for a cafe-bar, because, I guess, that's the volume that they themselves enjoy listening to music.And they have to do something about that cashier. Yes, the one that everyone talks about in their reviews. The one that intimidates. The one who has the face of someone biting on lemons. The one who makes no eye contact with you. Seriously, none whatsoever. I was there the other day and made note of zero eye contact throughout an order that was a minute long. She looked down, she looked up, she looked at the cash register, she looked at the credit card, at the menu, at the coffee mug, but never at me--one of the ones making her job possible.  I really don't know how any business keeps a person like that employed or why it doesn't train them better. Would a sit-down with the lady really hurt to teach her the way to deal with customers, to smile, to be cheerful, to be, in short, decent.Please, Amrita Management, do it for the betterment of your establishment and for the customers who you would like to see returning.Don't be lazy. Don't fire her. Just give her a few lessons, give her a raise, and think about the customer.And watch ""Mr. Selfridge"" in case you don't know how to treat the customer.He's the guy who came up with the phrase ""the customer is always right."" He was definitely right.",4,,1

As a soccer fan, I appreciate that they are always showing games on the weekend. Their coffee and other warm drinks are definitely a step above massive chains like Starbucks, while their food is decent and reasonably priced. Bacon and egg breakfast sandwiches and the chipotle chicken panini are highlights. The greatest strength of the place is its vibe and sense of community. Never too quite, never too loud. Perfect for any time of day. If you are just going to eat brunch or dinner there are definitely better restos, but for a place to hang out this can't be beat.",1,,1

I mostly go there for drinks only. The staff is always relaxed and friendly, they just chillin lol, but i really have no problem with that. I usually get the red sangria, they have the white one too but not as good. It is the best i ever tried, strong too so you can't have more than 2 otherwise call your friends to come get you:) The place always plays music, different genre but later at night it gets louder. They also have outside sitting in the summer and the crowd varies from young people to older and even families with kids. Later in the evening the crowd changes to friends hanging by the bar and dates at the tables. Definitely My favorite place in that neighborhood to relax after a long day at work.",,,

I think you have to be a regular to get a smile from the cashier and it isn't the least expensive place in the world, but it is tasty. I suggest you go there with a friend after a nice walk in the park ( either Morningside Park or Central Park).

67,Kelsey H.,"New York, NY",134,41,0,3.0,7/24/2015,"*Closer to 3.5 stars*I like to come here for a casual lunch, no-frills brunch, or quick and easy dinner. The pesto chicken sandwich is quite tasty, especially with mozzarella cheese, and I'm a fan of the chipotle mayo chicken sandwich and caesar salad as well. At brunch or breakfast, the sausage egg and cheese on a whole wheat bagel is surprisingly good and large enough to share if neither you nor your dining partner has a big early appetite. As other reviewers mentioned, the woman who works the front counter is typically unpleasant, making you feel like your very presence is a bother to her. Although the other workers around her are busily and cheerily working, she is unfortunately the face of the business, and sadly her expression is usually sour. Their level of service would be more important if there were literally any comparable competition in the area, but there is a dearth of casual cafe eateries around (that serve alcohol!) If one opened up, maybe they would feel more obliged to serve smiles with their sandwiches. Until then.",4,,

Updated review","Same problems with understaffing in the past.  I raised my rating to three stars because the espresso (Danesi) is really excellent. But with new competition by Starbucks a few doors down, they had better step up their service game.  I stood in line forever, and after I ordered my simple double espresso, she proceeded to TAKE TWO MORE ORDERS before making mine.  I don't come here more often because I usually don't have time to waste.",1,,

73,Easy D.,"Queens Village, NY",35,33,22,4.0,4/16/2015,"This was my go-to happy hour spot when I worked around the corner. Mostly functioning as a cafe, they also have a full bar with the usual selections of domestic beer on tap. They also have the usual cafe fare here; sandwiches, great coffee, and some baked goods. My favorites are the chipotle chicken sandwich and the avocado salad with chicken. They've also got some of the best guacamole in the area, something that always surprised me considering the plethora of Mexican joints in the neighborhood. Nothing about this place screams excellence, the service is slow and they are often out of some menu items they offer. But the friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and free wi-fi make up for it.",2,,

I took a closer look and there were spots of white mold along the top of the quiche. I called to speak to the manager who initially said it was just pieces of cheese. But white fuzz is not cheese. Also, people are not joking when they say the service here is horrendous. The female cashier who was taking orders, had no idea what she was doing. There were three people in line when I got there and there were ten people in line by the time I left. The only ray of light was the male barista who was extremely friendly and attentive.

This was not a full service restaurant where I would be glad to leave a generous top for good service, this was a cafe where I had to go to the register to order and receive a number that I took to my table and had the food dropped off. There was no service after that, so the entitlement astounds me.

79,Nic B.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,1.0,1/18/2015,"Waiting a ridiculously long time for food with NO care or sympathy from the staff really gives people the time and motivation to draft a well-deserved negative review. Since I will never return, I will write this mostly so that other unsuspecting customers maybe do not have to experience the same hell of paying alot of money for food they could make at home or get at other options nearby. and not be TRAPPED while waiting for food you paid for. Some businesses or employees (esp in NYC) have such attitude as if you do not matter one bit. They assume people will keep coming regardless of what kind of service they offer. I guess some employees figure they commonly get this behavior from other service employees so they think it is ok to do the same at their jobs. it's NOT ok. Besides simply not going back, honest reviews are one of the only ways to discourage this type of attitude and behavior.Mistakes happen and I totally understand that, but what makes the difference is HOW you are treated by the staff. If she was nice, considerate or apologetic, we would have happily waited even longer than we did with a smile on our faces.But from the beginning, the asian girl at the register had a really bad attitude. after placing our order, she didnt say anything and there was a number sitting on the register so we asked ""is this our number?"" which she confirmed with a terrible attitude as if it was a stupid question.So off we go to wait for our food. It was not too crowded. After a long while, we were delivered someone else's food who ordered before us...so we figured our simple order was next. After another LONG while, we inquired about our order and the girl said with attitude ""they're working on it!"".After another LONG while, we over-heard another nicer employee discovered our order was never placed! Well, there were few customers and it was a simple order so we figured they would quickly make our pancakes and omelet. Other orders were delivered to people who came in way after we ordered but no sign of ours (which should have been expedited) so I walked back to the kitchen asking about our order since it was another employee who caught the mistake so perhaps they did not clear it up with the kitchen. The asian girl and her friend chatting in the back seemed annoyed I asked again so we got that scary feeling they might do something to our food, if u know what i mean. Well, we were too hungry to ask for a refund so we took our chances and ate when if finally came out, but NEVER again. I sincerely hope this review encourages this employee to reconsider her attitude and how a little kindness can go a long way in getting praises instead of negative reviews like this one. If so, I will leave it to others to praise her good qualities.*******Ha, I felt bad writing this negative review wondering if I was being too harsh....but I read some of the other reviews and see it is a clear pattern here!  OWNERS: I predict you will NOT stay in business long term if you allow this to continue! There are simply too many other options and your place is NOT special to have the privilege to act with such attitude and disregard. good luck!",2,,

""It's just the way it is"" replies the girl at the counter.Fine - I ordered the French toast and was surprised when I was greeted with pound cake drowned in syrup. Literally, their pass at french toast was a pre-packaged pound cake in a puddle of syrup. The mimosa's champagne was low quality, and they use the bad part of the pig for their bacon. When I asked the gentleman who was collecting the plates about it he responds "" I dunno, I got nothin' to do with that.

94,Kat C.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,126,69,4.0,3/5/2014,"TL;DR: Eclectic, casual place. that does not try hard and caters to many needs (coffee, food, alcohol, etc). Strong coffee. I visited this location approximately 3pm on a Sunday afternoon the first weekend of March 2014. I stumbled upon this location with a friend as we were searching for a place with wifi, coffee, food, and seats. As soon as we walked in, it felt chill and happy. I will try to explain why.This place has an eclectic all in one type of room. There is a bar on one side of the room, a coffee bar on the other, food & drinks menu, and a lot of seats squished in together. The music playing was upbeat pop songs streaming from Pandora Online Radio on a small netbook behind the bar. It was just so charmingly relaxed like some other folks say, a living room. There was no pretense. What you see is what you get. It felt comfortable saying whatever was on my mind.The coffee was strong and the milk and sugar area was clean, which is greatly appreciated. Breakfast unfortunately ended in the morning so I couldn't get eggs. The grilled chicken sandwich I ordered was satisfying. I should've gotten salad instead of potato chips, but alas who can avoid starch in the middle of winter. The servers remember who ordered what without using a number system, which is always amazing to me. The customers here fill a wide range of demographics. From students who were studying (solo & group), older senior citizens spending an afternoon together, writers writing, folks watching the soccer game and cheering, folks at the bar drinking cocktails in the afternoon, to a same-sex and different-sex couples chilling on their dates, and obvious tourists in a corner staying warm in the cold. It was nice to see so much going on simultaneously. I didn't get a chance to check the network speeds but the network reception looked strong. Did not notice how many outlets were available.",3,1,1

96,Maggie D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,5/31/2016,"I would give this establishment no stars however that isn't an option.Food: The salads are pretty good and since I live close by I always stop by for a quick salad with that said the service negates the decent food.Service: As I stated earlier the salads are pretty good, however the service sucks. Because I live near this restaurant I always stop by to get a chicken salad. Although I always do that I must admit that the Indian lady that is the cashier is pretty intimidating for me. There's never been a time where I felt like ok she's just having a bad day. She's pretty much rudely consistent and she always seems to be angry. I don't know if she despises her job but her energy has always been off and everyone that says so in other comments are pretty accurate in their reviews. Although she isn't friendly and makes me feel as if I am asking for free food I would still go and order despite the bs service. Today however took the cake and because of her I will no longer be ordering from that establishment. Today's Incident: So a friend and I decided to stop and get a salad so i suggested this place being that it is close to my home. Once there the Indian lady (of course) took our orders. My friend stated that she didn't want feta cheese in her salad and the lady spoke to her nasty, so we of course ignored her unfriendly tone. (We were the only people that were ordering) I got my salad first so we assumed that my friend would get her salad second because no one else was ordering and the place was pretty empty. However, my friend wanted to ask the Indian lady if that was her salad that was on the counter, but the lady was too busy on the phone, about 10 minutes talking and ignoring my friend as she tried to get her attention to ask if it was her salad. Since she paid us no mind I decided to check if the salads was hers because after all it was in a plastic bowl and lid so as soon as I went to make sure the salad was my friends, the Indian cashier yelled at me and told me that it wasn't her salad. This didn't sit well with my friend who decided to tell her she was being rude and her tone wasn't necessary. She brushed her off and tried to engage in an argument with her. I tried diffusing the situation as I am a non confrontational person but I just couldn't believe how nasty, rude, and obnoxious the Indian cashier was being. Because she kept telling my friend ""I wasn't talking to you"" and ""get out of here"" I stepped in and politely stated to her that in all honesty her tone was off towards me and she was rude. She also dismissed me and was very nasty, I just couldn't believe what I was witnessing. I'm a restaurant junkie so I know first hand how you much a nice gesture or great service means. All she had to do was be humble and apologize for the grand fiasco she was putting on which might I add was highly embarrassing.Conclusion: After all was said and done, I did speak to the manager about her behavior and how unnecessary it was. I told him I always felt intimidated by her because of how rude she is EVERY TIME I come in that restaurant. He basically brushed me off and said that her work ethics were the reason they keep her. So is she the only person with great work ethics? Does having decent work ethics outweigh how you treat others, and customer service? When you are the front of a restaurant whether the host or cashier your presentation and how you treat others means EVERYTHING. Who wants to walk in a place where you aren't even greeted but treated as if you are asking for a handout? Because the manager didn't respond the way any normal establishment would showed me that there are many reasons why this lady in the front feels that she can treat others poorly and get away with it.  Yes restaurants are busy but this restaurant doesn't get as busy as many other restaurants I've been to which had good customer service. And to be quiet honest I've never been here when it was super busy so what was her excuse then. This lady basically exemplifies the text book version of how not to be a negative person. If the root of this establishment is flawed with negativity then I am definitely not investing my money. I can honestly say that after today I now know what it feels like to be in the twilight zone.",5,1,
97,Brian J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,3,1.0,7/19/2016,"ZERO STARS.  Came here and ordered a grill chicken wrap and the menu does not mention any mayo being included.  My wrap arrives and is covered in mayo, which I do not eat.  I take it back because I don't eat mayo at all.  The ""chef"" is completely rude and dismissive and tells me that mayo is on his list of ingredients.  He then turns his back to me and ignores me.  I ask him if he even cares that I don't eat mayo and that it's not on the menu, and he says ""no, I don't care that you don't eat mayo.""  I GOT A REFUND AND WILL NEVER BE RETURNING HERE.  Don't waste your time or money on this place as they do not care about customer service.",2,,

99,B J.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/11/2016,I cannot figure out the great reviews for the life of me. I've tried this place two different times and both have been fails. The first time I received my french toast covered in bananas (I specifically requested this without bananas as I have an allergy) and the second my $17 pancakes were just okay. Nobody bothers to bring silverware or water and they couldn't care less about checking up on you. This would suffice if perhaps you're just looking for a place near the park to drink outside & catch up with friends.,1,,

Its unfortunate because I live 3 blocks away and work from home primarily.As an event planner, & an experienced server/bartender, I know these people have NOT been trained whatsoever. Who is the manager during the morning/afternoon?! The attitudes suck, the service is glacial and after tipping around 25%, I waited FIFTEEN minutes for a latte (incorrectly sized). Mind you there was one other person in line. No smile, no apology and a b*tchy attitude. Unfortunate, because I'd easily spend more time here.

Each time I'm reminded of how rude the staff is and how bad this place is for working or even talking with whoever is with you. I've never had a pleasant or easy time ordering here, if it isn't the stank face woman who acts like you're pissing her off by being in front of her trying to give her business, then it's the man who one time kept interrupting me while I was trying to order so he could talk to his friend at the bar. He then held onto my credit card for another 5 minutes while he continued to talk to his friend before swiping it. The food isn't terrible, but a little pricey. $9 is a bit much for some melted cheese on half a baguette.",1,,
107,Erik C.,"Milan, Italy",248,51,5,3.0,4/17/2013,"A Cafe. Just a Cafe. An Average Cafe.Sometimes people like to exaggerate in restaurant reviews. One online review site said some folks call Amrita their ""living room"", which really is a way of trying glamorize or make cozy-seeming or whatever a place that is not like a living room. I mean, it's a cafe, with a bar, tables, and chairs. It's not like they're extra comfy or there are stuffed animals all over the place. There's nothing super-creative about the decor. There's no Norm and Cliff welcoming you with hilarious quips. It's not Cheers.Look, one of the clubs I belong to over at Columbia has decided to hold meetings here, for a reason that I'm not at liberty to disclose. So that's how I ended up frequenting Amrita. I wouldn't if it weren't for the club. Unless I lived upstairs or something. It's just... there's nothing to recommend the place, and nothing not to recommend it.The food is OK, but not spectacular. The guacamole was pretty bland. The goat cheese salad, on the other hand, was fine. The beer choices are, like the food, OK, but not spectacular. Sam Adams, Guiness, Blue Moon, and one other on tap, if I recall correctly. Again, four normal, easy-to-find, not disgusting beers on tap. The wine choices are a little less than OK. Nothing French. Not when I was there, anyway. Any cafe that does not have French wine isn't more than A-OK. We had a California Chardonnay and really, I've tasted better.The guy behind the counter hasn't been super-friendly, but he's not a jerk. He's just a guy. You give him the order, and he gives it to you. There may be a whole bunch of locals who hang out at this place regularly and chat with him, but when I looked, he was playing with his iPhone. I certainly didn't feel unwelcome.The place gets props for having outdoor seating, and yeah, it's a convenient location, if you have any reason to go to 110th and Frederick Douglass Blvd. Maybe if you want to go to the northwestern corner of Central Park. It's on kind of a mediocre roundabout in a not-super-architecturally-interesting neighborhood in an already loud and traffic-ridden city.I don't know what to tell you. This is the classic 2 1/2 stars place. Amrita is the reason that we Yelpers should be allowed to give half-stars. Amrita is like that one girlfriend you had that wasn't too hot, and was kinda interesting but got boring if you talked too long, but it was better to have someone around than not, except for the times when you didn't want anyone around. You guys eventually broke up cordially but are still friends, but not besties. You chat once in a while on Facebook. That's kind of my relationship to the Cafe Amrita.",9,7,

I've seen plenty of young adults enjoy their weekend afternoons enjoying their glass of wine and talk. And that is hard to come by anywhere in NYC. A refreshing place to take a break. Otherwise, I can't really comment on food. However, as they want to keep it from turning into a library serving coffee (as many Starbucks can become), on weekends they don't allow computers/internet until after 4PM. I think it's a good move to keep the place a cool meeting place.",1,,

Updated review","While I used to love Cafe Amrita because of the ambiance and the people who were the servers at night and for brunch, I have to say that they do their brunch scene all wrong for when there's a game playing (mostly for soccer/euro football). Boyfriend and I wanted to watch the Eurocup with some coffee/beers/delectable goodies, and we were all ""Well, Cafe Amrita usually has it playing... it's like 3PM, brunch should be ending now! Lets goooo!""Upon arriving we noticed that there were two seats at the bar and we began to (almost) happily skip to them - until we noticed the big sign that put a damper on our moods and our Soccer-driven giddiness: ""RESERVED"" For who, you might ask? No one! Management puts a reserved sign up whenever there is a game and freely gives them away whenever they want to! How do I know this? Because some random bloke came into the cafe, seemed to be just as puzzled as us at where to sit, and the baristas were all ""Hey (insert name of bloke), need a chair?"" and promptly sat him at the reserved section. We even asked the waitress when did she think a table would open up, anything open up and she was all ""well, they're all here for the game..."" which was sort and sort of not true, since there were clearly people finishing up meals/not paying attention to the screen. We left in a haste and quickly went to Panini di Parma instead over on Amsterdam, literally running up Morningside Drive to grab a stool. Not cool Amrita. Not cool. Now I know why I shouldn't be coming for that coffee shop",7,3,2
118,Grace L.,"New York, NY",14,69,7,4.0,1/24/2013,"Maybe the quality of the food or service isn't perfect, but Cafe Amrita is a neighborhood gem. As a bar, coffee shop and restaurant all rolled-up into one, it's an all-purpose place where you can go for any different occasion.Some tips:- No WiFi on weekends. I think this was enforced to prevent people, especially students, from ""squatting"" on weekends.- Sandwiches and salads are solid, but I would recommend steering away from any of the more ""complicated"" food (i.e. quesadillas, guacamole)- At night, it is only candlelit and thus, very dark inside, so if you want to get work done, you're going to have to manage with dim lighting.Cafe Amrita is your best option on Central Park North!",1,,

She's quick and efficient if she's not whistling Dixie the whole time you try doing 4 jobs at once... People whom have never served the public in a restaurant or cafe environment have no idea the stress, pressure and responsibility that woman is having to deal with..that said, the coffee is delicious the sizes are huge for the prices, the food is delicious my favourites being the quesadilla and the tuna salad  the portions are big, you won't find portions this big for these prices anywhere in the 5 boroughs.....

It's not a place tourists would put on their lists (or in my mom's case, excel sheet), it's not even a place a person living +30 blocks away would consider visiting. It's not because the cafe is BAD but because there is probably already an establishment just like this one that he/she is already familiar with right around the block. And thank goodness for that. This place is not meant to be trendy, it's meant to be your next-door neighbor that happens to serve you your coffee and morning breakfast. My boyfriend and I arrived at Cafe Amrita on a chirpy morning after flying red-eye and riding a long train ride from JFK. Neither of us had slept very well, our stomachs were grumbling, our suitcases tailed behind us as we stepped in the door. I ordered chai latte, he ordered cafe latte, and we split a breakfast sandwich of sausage and eggs on a croissant. The drinks and sandwich were a-ok, nothing to brag about, but it sure hit the spot after hours of travel.The staff is great. They don't bug you, they let you do your thing, and overall pretty friendly when you do talk to them. As far as I know, they don't menacingly come tap your shoulder to say ""hi, sorry, but you've surpassed your seating time and there's other people waiting."" (Which is so common at other trendy and popular coffee shops.) Everyone's just there with their laptops, books, school work, etc. (And in my boyfriend and my case, our luggage.)Plus they play good music!

Updated review","Amrita is currently petitioning to get an outdoor patio for the cafe which would be wonderful! The only thing better then their paninis are paninis that I can eat outside.However during the week they have wireless so there are tons of people who decide to camp out with their Mac, take up a whole table, and work on excel spreadsheets for 3-4 hours which is really annoying. During the week if you walk in after 5pm you'll have to elbow a local teacher group out of the way to get a table. But I am happy that this place seems to be thriving and is always busy. I think its a unique place with its atmosphere, menu, diverse crowd, good music and liquor. The paninis are really good even though they're a bit pricey ($9), they come with a side salad and I always go for the Club and a $5 house wine.",,,
143,Michael B.,"New York, NY",19,8,1,1.0,1/12/2015,"Avoid this place. While it has good potential, the staff seems aggravated by your presence, and are rude and discourteous! Today I found that this stems from the manager/owner.  After the employees screwed up my order by delivering it to a stranger sitting next to me, who delightedly and  immediately consumed the food I had already paid for, I asked the owner for a refund since I had paid in advance and didn't have time to wait for 30 minutes for the employees to cook up my order again. He said that he would refund my money but that I should not come back! He said he didn't care about losing one customer! He also said he hates New York and New Yorkers who complain! WHAT? ? He made me feel that I had done something wrong rather than his staff! Awful! With such an attitude and opinion of customers stated directly to a customer by the owner, it is no surprise that the reviews of the service and staff are terrible! If you feel despised by the staff here, it's because the owner, in fact, does despise the customers, and has no problem stating that to you in the presence of all of his staff members and other customers.  Wow!

Indeed, a good m8 of mine and I ordered guacamole and chips - and specified salsa on the side, cos we were hungry.instead, we got extremely salty, plastic tasting, chips - apparently from a bag of Doritos or a cheaper store brand - and lumpy guacamole!  ultimately, an order of salsa was delivered as a plastic cup of sour cream and a sparingly chopped up sliver of a stale tomato. Incredibly LOW standards. ... as you must be thinking: what the HELL?? we complained and were subsequently chucked out as trouble makers. I never felt so much like I was in the Red Square -- except, maybe in the Red Square - the food is much better.Trust me, the ONLY reason u will end up here is if you are stuck in Harlem and can't find a decent pub.

Perfect chill spot to do some work with coffee, or have a few drinks with friends in a super laid back environment. The staff is very friendly, especially Geo (My fave). This cafe is the definition of a real cafe. Make sure to try their white sangria, tastes amazing while packing with a punch. Keep it up cafe amirita !",,,

153,Cindy L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,6,0,4.0,11/8/2010,"Great neighborhood coffee shop/bar with the most amazing chai latte.  The coffee is excellent as well, but it's hard for me to stray from my usual chai.  There's a good wrap and salad selection, and the oatmeal raisin cookies are divine.  Good ambiance, and I love that the music selection basically sounds like my iTunes library on shuffle (Stars, Phoenix, The Xx, Florence & The Machine, etc.)  It *can be* a great place to get some work done...which leads me to my one complaint... I get it, you're trying to be both a coffee shop and a bar.  But is it absolutely necessary to dim the lights at 4:45pm, causing me to completely strain my eyes to finish the chapter I'm in the middle of reading??  That seems excessively early, plus the dimming of the lights becomes an annoying multi-stage process.  By 5:30 the place is practically pitch black, so you can forget about getting any work done if you're there sin laptop.  As someone who returns from work at 4 to face hours of studying, it is frustrating that I can only comfortably get an hour of reading done here after work.Despite this annoyance, I don't have the heart to take away more than one star.  Overall, I think this place is great, and I will keep coming back.",3,2,

And not like, the girls are overwhelmed and just busy and can't get to you, but trying their best and give you a smile. No, they are usually quite rude and standoffish. For me at least, it gives the place a weird vibe, and I've heard that from several other locals. What really irks me though, is when I come with my best friend.

Weird.That being said, a glass of decent cabernet was only $5, and there was plenty of comfy seating where I could actually hear my date and there was a fair amount of space between us and other couples. The bartender was a little spacey, but left us alone, which was nice. After the game, he put on his iPod and proceeded to play top 40 hits from six years ago. We were listening to Usher's ""Yeah,"" which was hilarious and also a little bit sad.I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but it was pretty nice for what it was.

The interior has that distinctive dried puke smell that dimly lit pubs acquire over time. The tables are sticky so think twice before putting your elbows down. Every piece of furniture seems to wobble (not a good idea for a place that sells hot beverages). The edibles they sell look pale and stale. It looks like management has simply given up.

Sandwiches, salads, wraps about $8. Coffee about $2. No table service which is nice but they should bring the food to your table instead of having to keep getting up to get it from the counter. Also you need a code for the bathroom door, makes you feel like you are a gas station bathroom. They are open late but not a good place to study after the sun goes down= tooo dark. They have dim lighting with candles, while this ambiance is good for drinks, not good for studying so I had to leave early as I could not see anymore.

Delish, but It's kind of hard to F up that combo.I went because I was finishing my taxes (I should totally be judged for this so go ahead) and wanted a place where I could distract myself with wifi. I like procrastinating.The whole thing is counter service. Kind of weird, but it's actually much faster than if there was table service. This is a good thing as I've worked brunch as a waiter and everyone expects coffee at a Starbucks pace. Got my food and asked about the internet password. No internet on weekend. ugh.

The best items on the menu are the chicken quesadilla and the chipotle chicken panini (clearly I am a chicken person). The red sangria is one of my favorite drinks. Evenings around 4-6pm are the best times to get work done if you want to sit and bring your laptop. The bartenders, Shanna, Punam and Giovanni are super friendly and great children.

The food here isn't great, particularly not for the price.  The seating isn't that comfortable, either. But the thing that really galls me about the place is their hostility toward laptop luggers. There are no outlets and on the weekends the wi-fi is off.  I have never bought the idea that having free wi-fi and outlets is somehow bad for business.  If you don't know how to make your cafe work with these things, you don't know how to make a cafe work.",3,3,1
197,Jeanne J.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,2.0,9/13/2014,"We like the coffee here and we are here a lot. We would really like to enjoy being here; however, the woman behind the counter ALWAYS ruins the experience for us. She is rude, obnoxious and has a face that says ""I HATE PEOPLE!"" I am always very polite when I order, but she never changes her rude tone and attitude. Which begs the question: why the hell does she work there? And despite her big attitude problem, I still put money in the tip jar every time. I do this because I know the other workers benefit from the tips.This morning my family and I decided that it would be our last visit there. After I politely ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 chai latte and a bagel, she started banging the coffee mugs and other things. I actually thought she was going to break the mugs. I was so shocked by her behavior. My young daughter was shocked too and even told me, ""Maybe I shouldn't have ordered the chai latte? Did that make her mad?"" That was the last straw for me and that's too bad.I will never go back to Cafe Amrita and will warn all my friends about this woman and how she exudes pure negativity in the place. I can no longer support this business.",,,
198,Aaron B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,3,0,5.0,8/23/2011,"This is one of the best places to read/study/catch up with friends, in Manhattan Valley...or really West of the park. They have a bar that is open at all times, they have coffee drinks that are available at all times, and they have a decent selection of food (coffee shop-like food)...available at all times. The noise isn't loud, so it makes for easy studying. I would say this is not the best place to have an incredibly personal conversation, well, at least not in the mornings. But every time I come here at night, the music is going, the tvs are on, and the atmosphere is always really really fun.The only thing is that if you are planning to bring a party greater than 4, I would go else where.",1,1,
199,T C.,"New York, NY",10,40,0,4.0,4/6/2010,"Cafe Amrita is a great place to hang out, drinks some coffee, grab a quick bite and get some work done.  During the day the place is fairly quiet and many people come here with laptops and books.  They serve inexpensive and decent soups, salads, and sandwiches.The added bonus to Cafe Amrita is that fact that they show futbol and have happy hour everyday from 4 to 8pm.  Last time I visited I was able to get a nice large pitcher of Stella, and fresh homemade guac and chips for $20.  I am pleased.  Thank you!!",,,
