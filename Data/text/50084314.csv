0,Jessica D.,"Wall Township, NJ",85,161,137,4.0,11/8/2018,"Stopped here during the NYC marathon.  The food here is fresh.  They have different options of salad bowls you can choose from as well as sandwiches and soups. You will definitely find vegetarian option here as well.  They also have protein options you can add to your dish such as grilled chicken or crispy chicken.  The space is small and there is limited seating inside.  I purchased the South Beach Salad and added chicken to it for $3 extra.  The salad was delicious.  I also got the house brewed coffee which I was happy they had an option for almond milk, I just wish they had Stevia as an option for sugar as I am on a Keto diet and can not do Equal or the other sugars they had.",1,,
1,Michelle D.,"Melbourne, FL",0,9,5,3.0,11/4/2018,"Great concept for the restaurant and I really want to like this place, but both times I visited I was disappointed in their service and prices. I ordered an acai bowl the first time- the bowl was much smaller than I expected and not as good as I hoped it would be, especially for the price. The employees had trouble understanding what I wanted in it and ended up adding something I specifically requested not to have (agave syrup). Next I ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese, which they first tried to give to me without the lox, then wanted to charge me again for it. I'm not sure why this location continuously had problems understanding my order. I think this restaurant could be great, but the employees could use more training and better communication.",,,
2,Rebekah B.,"Winter Park, FL",263,359,465,3.0,2/17/2018,"2018 Review 13/100Not bad. Some pretty standard breakfast options for a healthy fast-eats establishment, albeit a little pricey. I stopped in for a quick bite before heading to a conference. The service was relatively quick. I had the egg white wrap and a cappuccino with almond milk. Overall not bad, but I've had more flavorful wraps of a similar nature.A word of warning: The shop is pretty chaotic in the morning. Of course, pretty much any quick-serve breakfast joint in New York City is going to be chaotic in the morning. But what I mean is they don't seem to have a good system for moving people through in an organized manner that makes the chaos manageable. Once they take your order you just step back or sit down and basically, everyone is in a blob of a group trying to figure out which orders coming out belong to whom. They could stand to button up that system a little bit.In summary: An OK breakfast option. Not amazing. Not bad either.",2,1,1
3,Tonya J.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",47,405,5241,3.0,7/25/2017,"Almost everything is fresh and delicious here however the prices are high especially if you are not going for the featured meal of the day and or if you want a cup of their featured Lavazza Coffee (which for some reason isn't that great here) or any of their small bottled fresh pressed juices to go with your breakfast or lunch. A few times I've gotten the Quiona as my preferred grains from here, twice the Quinoa smelled like an old wet piece of clothing that never got the chance to properly dry and with a spoiled taste. So I skip the Quiona altogether now.The line's are lengthy but the service is fast paced and courteous at all times.Prices are higher here for standard breakfast and lunch fare but it's Midtown so expect that,  don't like the prices bring your own food or pick up breakfast from your neighborhood deli before hitting the Midtown scene otherwise Fresh & Co will have to due.",38,33,38
4,Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",25,168,333,5.0,3/29/2018,"I love this place! We dined here in the morning for breakfast.PROS: fast service, fresh food, healthy options, fresh juices, boiled eggs, fruit, lots for vegetarians! We had pancakes, an egg sandwich, fruit, brownie, and coffee. CONS: can be quite crowded with limited seating, the brownie was hard as a rock like a little brown choco brick, the coffee wasn't fab (but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives!)OVERALL: I love this little spot, it's a great choice for fast healthy food so we will definitely return!",,,
5,David G.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,14,0,1.0,10/10/2018,"Worst location in all of NYC!!! Never have their stuff together and always a back up for extended periods of time, just to have your order made incorrectly!!! I added cheese to a breakfast sandwich and my entire order came out wrong. If I didn't check before I left, I'd have eaten a $14 breakfast that sucked because it was incorrect. This has happened to me at this location multiple times. Moving forward I'm going to 6th ave where they have it all together. This location is horribly managed on 57th & 7th!! The manager overheard this entire exchange and did not even offer an apology until I told her this happens every time at this location. She was cold, uncaring and unapologetic in my opinion. Never again!!!",,,

13,Richard M.,"North Plainfield, NJ",76,5,0,5.0,8/21/2018,"What a great place to go while in the city. The food is so fresh and delicious.  Their salad bar ingredients are locally sourced and so fresh. (Hence the name) I had the chicken mozzarella sandwich and it was amazing. The sandwiches are pre-made but I wouldn't change a thing about it. It is served on a sesame baguette with crispy fried chicken, fresh arugula, garlic roasted artichokes, fresh local mozzarella cheese and a marinara sauce. The sandwich is lightly toasted and just to die for. I enjoyed every bit of it. The way the artichokes complimented the chicken was great. It had such rich flavor and the arugula was so delicious. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick bite while in the city. They also have an app you can order from!! It's so easy and simple to use. I can't wait to go back and try their other sandwiches and salads.",,,
14,Katrina M.,"Bronx, NY",155,35,55,3.0,8/11/2017,"One thing is for certain, if you decide to come to this location of Fresh&Co, expect a lot of people. It is on the corner of Seventh Ave directly across from Carnegie Hall and next to plenty of office buildings; a mixture of tourists and office employees constantly come in and out of this location because of its convenience.With that being said, since I began working in the building two doors down from this location, I've purchased food from here a lot. I enjoy the food here for the most part but you do have to know what to order because I have made a few mistakes (i.e. The Turkey Chili Quinoa Bowl) but I usually either order something for breakfast (small Cream of Wheat: they have a variety of toppings for their farina and oatmeal menu options) or for lunch (Chicken Fresco sandwich all day! It's so good! The pesto cheese bread that it is on is EVERYTHING!).However, some of the downsides of this location from what I have experienced has been the SERVICE or lack thereof. I have stood waiting for someone to take my order several times and the employees would either be talking to one another or working on another order. I'm not hard to miss; I have a large afro that sits atop my head, lol. There was actually one time where I stood waiting for almost ten minutes nearby the oatmeal station and the employees behind that section were busy chatting. It took the person cleaning all the way down by the bagels to see that I was waiting for awhile to ask if I would to order something. It wasn't even that busy that morning!I do want to give a special shout-out to their cleaning lady that works there. She always, always greets me with a smile and gives a word of encouragement. She truly makes a difference there. My colleague also speaks of her very highly whenever she goes there for breakfast. Give that woman a promotion!! Overall, the food is good, a bit pricey but if you're looking for organic and locally source food served fast and fresh, then it is truly worth it.",,,

17,Danielle W.,"New York, NY",111,96,112,3.0,11/12/2016,"I believe this store had moved from the corner of 6th Avenue. I've always appreciated Fresh & Co.'s healthier food options. I frequented the one near my campus last year. I headed over to this location during my lunch break at work. The atmosphere is like all other Fresh & Co.'s - it's bright, clean, and fresh. It was really crowded and hectic, as expected during the rush. However, I didn't anticipate the lines to be so disorganized. The staff was helpful at directing us, but there's one long line that spans the soup, salad, and grain bowl stations. At most Fresh & Co.'s, they usually separate the lines based on what you're ordering, which is definitely more efficient. Also, there's two cash registers at one end of the line, and one cash register at the other end of the line. It's a bit strange, we had to loop back around the line to pay after ordering. I decided on the Bangkok Bowl, which comes with carrots, broccoli, daikon, cabbage, scallions, turkey, and kale (optional) topped with a sweet chili sauce. They give you a really big portion for lunch, I usually can't finish all of it in one sitting. The turkey was a little bit dry, since it's diced and not chunks. Overall, the chili sauce gave the dish a bit of heat, but it wasn't overwhelming. The kale tasted overcooked, because it was a little mushy when I ate it. Right now, there's a Yelp deal where you get a free Poland Spring water bottle for checking in.",1,1,1

The ingredients are fresh and the line ups can be long. But I only ended up coming here because chop't had a lineup straight out the door.

I wanted a salad and stood there looking straight at 2 employees who looked back at me and said nothing. I nicely said ""Yes I'd like..."" and nothing. After 3 minutes, I ask an employee if it's too early for a salad or not (10:20am) and he points to the salad ingredients and says ""Don't you see salad ingredients here?"". I mean, come on... was trying to be polite... didn't see the lettuce yet, it's early.So anyway. I pick my lettuce, my toppings. He takes the lid and writes my price and I nicely say ""Oh! Can I please add dressing?"" and he says ""SHE will do that, not me"" to another employee deep cleaning with sudsy gloves on, 3 feet from him, and not to mention further AWAY from the cashier. A line moves towards cashier, I thought? So then I wait another 2 minutes for this lady, not smiling or saying ""sorry, one moment"" to finish her deep cleaning, while the guy who helped me before does nothing. I had to backtrack in line, to wait for someone else to simply add dressing. It was really really dumb. Salad was $12 and I didn't get chicken, beef, tuna, shrimp, or any of the $3 meats. I got pretty typical toppings. $12 is OK... but honestly the attitude and asinine customer service is what will make me not return.",,,

Updated review",Update on May 3: so I made a complaint in response to the email receipt (I use the store app) and they got back to me and gave me $10 credit in my account. I went to the store again and was able to apply the Yelp check in reward this time. I found the pattern is that the cashier closer to the beverage section is nice and always gives you the Yelp check-in reward while the cashier closet to the salad dressing bar didn't recognize the Yelp check in. So I upgraded my rating to 3 stars because of their corporate customer service and the nice lady at the store. Review on April 28: The Yelp check in offer is not working. The cashier lady is rude saying that her computer doesn't have such code (but it worked two days ago in the same store). Also on their app it says you will recover a free salad on your birthday but in fact it didn't work. The lady insisted charging me full price.,,,

I came here almost on a weekly basis for breakfast, and was always satisfied with the food.I would recommend ordering the Power BLT in a wrap - good size, filling, tasty (it's the sundried tomatoes!!) and fairly priced.  Their bagels are good and they come with a healthy portion of cream cheese (though this isn't the spot to come for a quintessential NYC bagel). If you are in a rush, the coconut chia pudding from the pre-made food fridge thinger majigger is great!My only note (and constructive criticism, if management reads these reviews) is about the queuing situation.  The line is disorganized, and you can stand in three separate areas to place an order.  This leads to confusion as a customer (""Have you ordered yet?"") and I imagine some frustration as an employee (""Why are all of these people baring orders at me?!"") Regardless of the organized chaos, the employees are chipper and upbeat without fail.  I am pretty sure the girl at the cash register has called me ""sweetie"" every time I've checked out.  Not a bad way to start your morning!",,,

48,Sherri H.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,383,147,5.0,8/28/2015,"I absolutely love Fresh & Co. and have become utterly addicted to it ever since they opened this location near my office right when I was starting to bride-diet before my wedding last year. I've grown to like it more than Chop't, at first because I disliked how tiny Chop't chopped everything including shrimp - when I get shrimp in my salad, I like good bites of whole shrimp. Fresh & Co. gets it right and also uses all high-quality, super fresh, organic, seasonal and/or local when available ingredients, most of which - the stuff you want chopped - are which are pre-chopped in advance to the perfect size. They have plenty of topping options, including kale (my go-to) or cabbage as bases and many dressings with new ones all the time, though I always stick to straight EVOO and lemon. Prices are fair and they have a good loyalty program if you pay using their app (which uses Level-up). Portions are generous; a salad always fills me up. I rarely stray from my at-least weekly DIY salad anymore but their own combinations never disappoint and I'm frequently tempted by their quinoa bowls and seasonal specials. Their soups are also top-notch. The staff is so friendly and always pays attention and takes the time to dress my salad exactly as I want it (even when I ask them for 3 lemons). A+ lunch spot (and I've dinner'd there too).",1,,
49,L. E.,"Manhattan, NY",26,73,1,5.0,10/19/2016,"I dunno what other ppl's experiences are here or why they might not be the best but I had a 5 star experience.  I'm Gluten free and it's hard to find places where I can eat and not get sick.  This place is great.  I especially liked the granola and chia pre-packages.  I also tried the pumkpin chia pudding.  Really hard to find gluten free granola stuff and these things were terrific.  I was less taken with the turkey salad but what can ya do.  Def stop in for breakfast of granola and chia pudding (I believe this is vegan as well).  They have also a greek yogurt, honey, and nuts/berries thing that I have not tried.I would have tried their GF sandwich but they keep it w the gluten stuff and I was afraid of contamination.  And plus there is one, non-changing sandwich that is GF and it is brussel sprout/cheese.  Which sounds non-tempting!  Staff could be friendlier but I'm not in a position to be too picky when I can eat here which I am very thankful about.",,,
50,Eric F.,"Wrightsville Beach, NC",67,12,0,4.0,12/18/2016,"Very impressed!!! We went around the corner for a late breakfast, but ended up here... not normally the place that I would go, but now the place I will.  Customer Service.... if in NC, I would be disappointed. Here, they were not rude... just not nice.  The cashier was wonderful. The food (western omelette with home fries and toast) was delicious!!! It left us wanting for nothing.",,,
51,Carly Jo R.,"Chicago, IL",113,48,48,5.0,8/22/2015,"I came here for the first time and I loved it. My food was wonderful and the staff was so friendly and welcoming. I got a vegan grilled cheese sandwich and it was so good. They have free WiFi and I downloaded their app while I was in there. They have a rewards program where you spend $100, get $9 back, and they give $1 to charity. It is semi expensive, but I already want to go back and try something else. Definitely recommend.",,,
52,John M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,0,5.0,5/15/2017,"Great fresh food and Great people!  Fresh & Co's store at the corner of 7th Ave and 57th St in NYC has a rare combination of the freshest, healthiest and tastiest food in the area (at reasonable prices)!  But the cool thing is that it is a happy place where the crew greets everyone with a smile as they hustle to fill your order.  (The store is kept extremely clean and bright.)  These happy vibes and positive atmosphere cannot be faked, and this is a reflection on their outstanding store manager, Belen.  She works side by side with her crew and sets the example. It is obvious that they love her and feel that it is a happy place to work.  We could not help but come for breakfast everyday while we were in the city.  Fresh & Co was a great positive, healthy way to start our day!  Thank you Belen!!!",,,
53,Ryan S.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",42,2,0,1.0,3/3/2016,"Bangkok bowl is very good but it's expensive and they are extremely frugal on meat portions. I asked if I could get a little more meat and they said it would cost $3 extra, which would bring my salad bowl to almost $15",,1,
54,Sarah L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",0,7,0,5.0,2/16/2017,"As fresh as their name states! Salads are really amazing, staff is friendly. This is my favorite place personally and when I bring homeless people here they always really appreciate the high quality of the food and friendliness of the staff, especially since they don't always get to eat such great food and since most places are hostile towards homeless patrons. Great place, love going here!",,,
55,Joe D.,"New York, NY",3,51,6,3.0,6/7/2016,Kind of a confusing ordering process during busy times as they try to create different lines in a very small space. Food is actually pretty good if you have the patience to stay long enough to order.,,,
56,Daniel O.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,34,0,1.0,8/4/2016,Have gone there for take out breakfast. AWFUL !! AVOID !! Food is meh but the female cashier is rude and nasty which is BAFFLING since there's five different places within a two block radius where you can get the same food basically for the same price. I go now to Europa which is great - the cashiers there could be a little quicker but everyone's friendly. See my review for them. This Fresh and Co. - NEVER !!!,,,
57,Valerie A.,"Varina, IA",0,60,11,3.0,2/5/2017,"Cheap, fast breakfast. The quality may be questionable. It's very similar to Subway, except with breakfast items.",,,
58,Hussa A.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,1/20/2016,"The cashier was rude, she charged me more than the next person while we had the exact same order! Then lied about it! They should have their prices displayed clearly!",,,
59,Ryan L.,"ASTORIA, NY",86,150,28,4.0,10/30/2014,"I waited a few visits and tried a wide variety of menu items before deciding to write a review of Fresh & Co. My first experience was breakfast and it was somewhat troubled due to the fact they were clearly short-staffed that morning, but the service was friendly so I decided I'd return for another meal in the future. Good food, but nothing out of the ordinary from what you'd expect of a NYC breakfast on the go. Lunch is really where Fresh & Co. shines! Their VEGAN CHILI is excellent! Pricey for the size of the container, but very very good in terms of quality. They use ""Beyond Meats"", which is a veggie-based protein that very closely mimics the texture and flavor of real meat. Not crazy about the $1 up charge for vegan options, but hey, at least they offer it. Service here is always speedy and friendly so I will absolutely be going back. I had their roast beef sandwich today and it was quite tasty. Again, small (its 3pm and I'm hungry again), but very good food. Give em a whirl (or three)!",,,
60,K K.,"New York, NY",164,48,530,3.0,11/7/2015,I miss cafe metro. The attempt to organize the lunch rush is not very good. The counter is so long and you order foods in the middle and then the cashiers are at the very end. It gets so confusing. The acoustics are also terrible and you can hardly hear anyone. The people that work there however are friendly and quick. The food is good but everything should be like a dollar less than it is.,,,
61,Iliana D.,"Manhattan, NY",99,341,162,5.0,9/29/2014,"U know what the food is ok, nothing spectacular.... Not bad either just a quick healthy lunch but what makes this place is the UPBEAT NICE ENERGETIC FRIENDLY staff! So rare in NY! This is why I will eat my soup here over hale n hearty!",,,
62,Shota A.,"Brooklyn, NY",269,3,0,1.0,1/29/2016,"Very confused and disorganized staff.

65,Kari M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,3,1.0,11/28/2015,"I just ordered pancaKes at this location and some how they always seem to get something wrong with my order, my pancakes are super burn and to top it off I found a hair inside the pancaKe, this is beyond disgusting.  I can maKe better pancaKes than this and trust me when I tell you I sucK at maKing pancaKes.  The tea was the only good thing but that's probably Bc all they had to do was add water to it.  This place does not deserve not one single star, the only reason I'm giving it one star it's Bc it won't let me post it unless I do.",,,
66,KevinandMelanie B.,"Simpsonville, SC",87,3,0,1.0,11/26/2015,"Just got totally ripped off by this place. They charged me $8 for a 12 oz private label grapefruit juice.  It is Thanksgiving day, though, so I guess they saw a good profiteering opportunity.",,,
67,D. E.,"New York, NY",0,33,18,4.0,7/25/2016,"First visit, clean, well staffed with pleasant, helpful and courteous workers. Open kitchen so food prep can be viewed. Four stars for now because the manager helped me check in on yelp for a free bottle of water.",,,
68,J B.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,5.0,6/19/2016,I go to varying locations for their vegetarian/vegan salads that are so delish! I must get around to trying their sandwiches and bowls. The Gaucho  Salad is my fave :),,,
69,Kate G.,"Butler, NJ",0,6,0,1.0,2/6/2015,"Waste of time, every time. This location is across the street from where I work. It is convenient for me to stop there on my way into the office in the morning when I occasionally feel like a bagel or egg sandwich. The guys that work the grill and bagel stations in the morning are terrible. They jump onto one another's stations but then jump back to their own and forget about your order that they started on the other guys station and don't tell that guy what they were doing and he carries on with other customers who came in after you. This has happened to me on more than one occasion, and because I don't want to make a scene and scold them, I walk out and leave it. This happened to me AGAIN today. Some times, when I actually do get my bagel, the cream cheese has been rancid like it wasn't refrigerated overnight and I've had to toss it in the trash. Waste of money!!Also, there is no room to form a line so people are all over the place, and they guys behind the counters recognize regular customers (which I am not) and jump to make their orders when clearly others are ahead of them. If its like this in the morning when there are only 6-7 customers in at a time, I can just imagine the chaos at lunch time. No thank you, I'll go somewhere else.This location just opened recently (within the last year) and they've gotta get their stuff together. Like most people coming in to this location in the morning I'm trying to get to work and don't have time for this nonsense.  I give them the benefit of the doubt and try again every so often, but it is a waste of time and money every time. There are places nearby with better, not-overpriced food and service.Giving one star because maybe one time out of 20 I got a decent sandwich and service.",1,,
70,Stephanie D.,"New York, NY",2,77,2,4.0,7/9/2015,"This place is rife with variety and freshness, as it says in its name! The food is quite expensive, but it's pretty much worth it, because you're guaranteed an amazing meal or snack.

73,Cornelia G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,4.0,11/22/2014,"Fresh and Co is a godsend for the health conscious as well as people who just want something freshly prepared and tasty, however the service is sorely lacking. I'd come in on a Saturday, asked for a salad and was told to wait five minutes. Another customer came up behind me and was waited on immediately. When I went to pay, the check out clerk was rude and surly. I'd only come back for the food and conveneince, but the staff sucks big time.",,,

However, this particular location is one of the least efficiently set-up branches, leading to long waits at the lunch rush hour. Plus some staff are not the friendliest. Management can improve the way the store is organized substantially as the layout now is confusing for customers.",1,,
