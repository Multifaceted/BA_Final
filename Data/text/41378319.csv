0,Pearce D.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,173,489,5.0,11/11/2018,"Top 3 favorite pasta place in the city. Top overall if you're factoring in the ability to actually get a table without a Herculean effort (ie Carbone). The bar seating is amazing, food is simple but amazingly done and can't go wrong with any of the wines. Highly recommend the garganelli is you like mushrooms. Also, most people think getting spaghetti at a restaurant is lame but those people probably haven't ever had L'Artusi spaghetti. What's best is you leave the experience not feeling heavy in the stomach or lighter in the wallet (not that much lighter anyway).",1,,1
1,Tommy N.,"West Covina, CA",29,104,200,4.0,11/16/2018,"I had a great dinner here. Everything was very good. Food here is modern Italian. I ordered a ragu pasta dish, chicken entree, and steak and potatoes entree. Every dish had lots of flavor and were very tasty. Pasta dish was savory and rich. The chicken breast was excellent- so tender. And steak was cooked medium, perfect to how I like it. Cocktail drinks are great as well. Service was amazing. All the staff workers were attentive, especially our waiter. He really was into the food and knew it well. He made suggestions that were really on point, like the dessert. The chocolate bar with salted caramel ice cream and crumbs was soo good! I couldn't have asked for a better recommendation. The only thing I felt didn't go was the hip hop and rap music being played. Now I like hip hop at the clubs when I'm dancing and getting my groove on, but to hear 2pac and biggy smalls at such a classy restaurant didn't go together at all. I think they're trying to be hip and trendy but I really wish the music was more appropriate and suitable for the environment cuz it's so chic and upscale. Please play soft jazz or something, this isn't the clubs.",,,1
2,Lauren M.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,16,0,5.0,11/9/2018,"This is my favorite restaurant in the city! The only terrible part is that I have only been able to get reservation two times in two years.The pasta is delicious as is the wine! I adore the rabbit gnocchi and loved the tagliatelle.  The portion sizes remind me of my time in Europe, what they should be. The olive oil cake with the creme mousse is pretty much heaven on earth. A light and sweet way to end a decadent meal. The ambiance is so chic, clean, classic and nestled in the heart of a quaint West Village chic. I love this place and can't wait to get back in! Don't hesitate, book, run, eat and enjoy! L'Artusi is a NYC/ West Village staple.",1,,
3,Jesica L.,"New York, NY",247,85,297,3.0,11/18/2018,"Too noisy! Not many veggie options. All the pastas with something non-veggie such as pancetta, boar ragu, bolognese, clams etc. And they were very un-flexible if you wanted to change something of the dishes! The server came at first, saying plenty of dishes all-in-a-row to start, none of the 3 of us could understand what she was saying, very unclear, non-stop & super fast plus all the noise that made it even harder to hear her! Is it that hard to put all the starters listed in the menu so I can read all of them? And the place being so loud did not help at all. Disappointing. Not flexible. Could NOT take out the chilies or the gorgonzola cheese because it was already in the sauce, could NOT get the tagliatelle pasta WITHOUT the bolognese sauce.... so could not have anything! Diet coke was awful. The carrots were okay. Didn't like the hazelnut chocolate cake, too much sault!! And I always LOVE dessert but this was extremely saulty. Besides this, the restaurant is nice, they have 2 floors, it can feel a bit tight though.. the block where the restaurant is located is super nice.",,,
4,Philip K.,"New York, NY",1,56,132,5.0,10/21/2018,"Don't think twice this place is amazing.  Best pastas in the city.  Ambience is great.  Perfect for date night.  I like to order several pastas at a time but make sure to make reservations early.  Otherwise u can always try to snag a spot by the bar.I love the garganelli, spaghetti, bucatini, orecchiette and tagliatelle.Never go wrong with the beef carpaccio.  Kale and mushrooms my favorite veggies.",1,1,1
5,Pardees F.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",244,68,107,5.0,9/10/2018,"I am so happy we were able to experience L'Artusi. The food was amazing. The burata special with heirloom tomatoes was the best burata I've ever had. It was super creamy and the tomatoes were crunchy and fresh. I usually don't like the taste of tomatoes that much but these tomatoes were fantastic. I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese which was incredible too. The olive oil cake is a must have. To get a reservation, call at least a month in advance. We got lucky and called 2 weeks before and got a 7pm reservation. The ambiance, location, and service were perfect as well. Will definitely be coming back here when we visit New York again!",1,1,1
6,Trisa T.,"New York, NY",199,402,586,3.0,8/30/2018,"I've been dying to try this place for a long time - but every time I tried to get a reservation online, it was booked up. We finally just called (novel idea, huh? lol) and we were able to get in for Sunday dinner. We were a party of 4 and had a great time. The ambiance is great. Very modern, sophisticated - good for a nice date or for a special night out. Our waiter was amazing. Friendly without coming off forced or fake, and he made a great wine recommendation. Food was fresh but we weren't fully impressed by anything - particularly the pasta. I think I've had better elsewhere (for cheaper $, too). Overall, a nice place for a decent meal. I'm glad we finally got to try it. Worth a try at least once.",1,,
7,Kathryn T.,"Manhattan, NY",352,411,2622,5.0,8/12/2018,"Easily one of the most consistently amazing restaurants in NYC and one of my most recommended places for visitors and locals, L'Artusi is something else entirely when it comes to restaurants in New York. And that's saying something.I've been here for both brunch and dinner and I can't say which I enjoy more. L'Artusi's ability to have consistent high-quality food through different meals is so unique in restaurants. Both menus have variety to accommodate a variety of preferences and dietary restrictions and the chefs here are flexible to meet your needs. I would lean toward going for dinner since you also get to enjoy its housemade, seasonal ricotta, which is only available as an appetizer during dinner hours. The service is consistently excellent. No matter how many times I go, there's always an attentive wait or bar staff. It's one of the most pleasant dining experiences in NYC. The vibe is timeless New York trendiness. You just feel cool sitting there, in one of the most famous restaurants, and probably dining with the cooler crowd of locals and tourists.Now for the food... I haven't had anything that I don't like at L'Artusi. I'm serious. I've eaten my way though half of the menu at this point and it is ALL good. The pasta is the best pasta in New York City. Hands down. I will gladly argue with you about it. The lamb pici and rabbit gnocchi may be one of my top 10 dishes in the entire world. Ya, I said it. SEE ME. Or better yet, go to L'Artusi and try it for yourself. The food is always amazing. You will not be disappointed, regardless of what you try. The cocktails are also delicious and strong. L'Artusi's craft cocktails worthy of The Nomad, Attaboy, etc.Overall, L'Artusi is a must-visit in NYC. It's excellent food, drinks, service, and feel make it one of the best spots in the city. If I'm really being honest, it helped me fall in love with Manhattan and West Village... it's that good.",4,,6
8,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,4.0,7/28/2018,"Made a reservation for 4 for this place 1 month in advance. The table arrangement was interesting. It was like 1/3 of a circle with 3 people sitting on the curved couch and 1 on a chair. Charred octopus - loved this dish. Potato and pickles were a nice counterbalance with the octopus.  Tastes better to generously spread the lemon. Gnocchi - softest I've ever had. you can mush it against the roof of your mouth. Gnocchi itself doesn't have much flavor, but paired with the lamb ragu it's perfect! Highlight of the meal! Tagliatelle - really thin, flat noodles. As El dente as it can be considering how thin it was but after the gnocchi it was hard to compare. Noodle doesn't have much flavor by itself, but paired well with the beef.Excellent service here since they bring the food quickly and quick water refills.",5,1,3

Updated review","I can now see why it's so difficult to make a reservation here.  Reservations open up 30 days in advanced and often times when it opens it fills up instantly.  Every part of our dining experience was amazing.  Service was great, ambiance was perfect and the food was absolutely delicious. L'Artusi ranks as one of my favorite dining experiences in NYC.",,,
10,Stephanie D.,"New York, NY",830,341,44,5.0,9/26/2018,"Reservations are pretty hard to get unless you schedule a reminder ahead of time to log in on a certain day to book them!I ate here a while ago so I don't remember exactly what our group ordered, but highlights included: the ricotta appetizer was everybody's fav dish, a bunch of pastas (can't go wrong with any of them), and the scallop appetizer. Honestly just listen to the other Yelp reviewers - they know what they're talking about. The olive oil cake tasted like pound cake to me and I didn't care much for it, but people who love pound cake went goo-goo-ga-ga over this dessert.",2,,3
11,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",226,387,698,5.0,6/28/2018,"The hype is real. I've been dying to try L'Artusi for months now and finally snagged a reservation. I've heard from multiple people that it's amazing, but there's nothing like finding out for yourself.My boyfriend and I got the octopus, bolognese tagliatelle, rabbit gnocchi, and hazelnut chocolate torta. Both the pastas were absolutely amazing. It wasn't heavy with oil or sauce as most places pile that on. The texture of the noodles were perfect and the gnocchi was nice and soft as opposed to overly chewy.The dessert was also a delicious hazelnut chocolate praline type mixture with sea salt caramel gelato. The ambiance was nice and romantic. Can't wait to come back and try the other menu items.",15,6,10
12,U M.,"New York, NY",5,25,2,5.0,11/19/2018,"One of the best places in the city to grab pasta/Italian. Check it out. Be mindful, they don't do substitutions easily.Not so easy to get reservations so definitely plan ahead.",,,
13,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,9/8/2018,"Loved the warm and inviting ambiance - it has a quiet buzz of positive energy and pops of glowing light amidst the dimly lit dining room - loved the tea lights on the stairs. And excellent service here - even at the bar!The place was packed as soon as it opened at 5:30 pm on a rainy Saturday, but fortunately the bar is as long as the length of the restaurant downstairs and we found two seats. A server comes and takes your order at the bar and you're treated as famously as if you were dining at a table, which I loved. We ordered a pecorino cheese to start - it was a good pecorino with toasted sesame seeds and crackers. I had the tagliatelle, which is white meaning it has no red sauce. It was alright, it had good chunks of meat in it to make up for the lack of sauce, but I've had better. The food here is simple and with portions on the smaller side. I ordered the oil cake because I had heard so much about it - it was good but again nothing to write home about, I liked the accompanying yellow raisins and dollop of whipped cream (the whipped cream was so amazing I would recommend ordering the oil cake just for the whipped cream).I went upstairs to check out the second level and one of the staff was so nice to point out the additional seating and private room for me. Nothing but gracious, warm and friendly service here by everyone. Not a hint of snootiness like you find at other such popular restaurants. Highly recommend for a date or a bite with a friend.",3,1,4
14,Laura G.,"Long Island, NY",286,298,2536,5.0,6/6/2018,"This place has it allllllll! Here's the deal, it is absolutely necessary that you have a reservation prior! We made ours about a month in advance... the place was packed to the brim too but you would never feel it bc the wait staff were on point and the food was flawless. Everything from start to finish, just amazing. We ordered a cheese plate, the beef carpaccio, day-boat scallops, tagliatelle, gnocchi, and of course the olive oil cake. The beef carpaccio is one of the best that I have ever had in my life. It had this deliciously light kick too, I believe horseradish mayo? With little croutons all over... AMAZING. Do not hesitate on ordering that.. another win were the scallops.. I was totally Leary at first but that changed quick and it was love at first bite! Raw scallops sliced thinly bathing in olive oil and paprika, it sounds weird but tasted delish. I love crudo prior to the main course, it just prepares you for what's to come with out making you feel full and those are both great choices. The pastas were SO FRESH and we LOVED them! Gnocchi good for sharing! And Lastly, the olive oil cake. This cake was so moist and tasted just like olive oil but was also sweet! It seems like such a simple dessert but it was really perfected at this place!! Def more of a romantic scene in here but anyone will love it!",3,1,1
15,Dimitric H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",61,115,154,5.0,6/14/2018,"WOW!!This is Italian that is taken to new heights. It's not the traditional that you are accustomed to. So go and experience a new twist.Food: was simply amazing, to start our meal we had the house-made ricotta cheese. This was simply the best ricotta cheese that I've ever had. The flavors and texture were amazing, which was paired perfectly with freshly made Parmesan chips. For the main course I opted for the Mushroom Ragu, the mushrooms were cooked perfectly in such a unique way that it resembled in flavor as if I was eating a meat sauce. I'm not a big fan of mushrooms and I loved it. This is one of the most popular dishes and I can see why. Ordered a side of broccoli rabe which was amazing, it was cooked with cloves of fresh garlic along with crumbled Italian sausage. For dessert you have to do the Olive Oil Cake! OMG just order it and thank me later. Also had the other chocolate praline dessert which was ok if your a chocolate lover but the main stage is that Olive Oil Cake.Service: My waitress was overall great, she made our night fun. This place gets packed so it's best that you score a reservation well in advanced if you want to get seated other than at the bar. Ambience: Great for special occasions or if your planning an amazing date night. Loved the open kitchen, where you could watch the head chef inspecting each plate to be passed on to service.Overall score 4.5 food wise - had to bump it to 5 simply because of our outstanding waitress and service.",1,,
16,John B.,"Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, NY",21,18,0,3.0,11/1/2018,"It's difficult for any restaurant to live up to the incredible hype & hysteria built up in online reviews and this place is no different.  Few eateries are worth waiting hours--or until 11pm to eat--and this place is no different.  Rarely can a staff continually keep up the fresh faced genuine excitement of a perpetually packed house or live up to the high expectations generated by years of gushing praise and L'Artusi is no different.It's not bad, its just not great.  Temper expectations; this is not a life changing meal.  If there's a normal rez time online or very little wait on a gloomy, windswept, rainy day... definitely sit at the bar and enjoy your meal.  Otherwise, it's no big deal and there are plenty of perfectly acceptable aesthetically pleasing substitute dishes around every NYC corner for your Insta pics.",,,
17,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",273,84,162,5.0,6/24/2018,"My favorite pasta in NYC!!I came here on a Sunday noon for brunch, because I was curious what #1 Italian restaurant in NYC tastes like. It is amazing!My boyfriend got the L'Artusi breakfast, which is huge in portion and delicious, with juicy roasted mushroom, crispy bacon, roasted tomatoes and potatoes. I got the tagliatelle, which is AMAZING! The texture of the pasta is just right, right in between soft and chewy; the meat sauce is tasty as well.We left the restaurant with full bellies, very satisfied with the food, the service and the atmosphere. We will definitely come back.",,,
18,Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",110,160,330,5.0,5/15/2018,"This restaurant has been on my bookmarks list for at least 5 years. A few weeks ago, I FINALLY got to try it as an anniversary celebration with my boyfriend.In my mind, I'd built up how great this restaurant would be and to be completely honest....it lived up to my expectations! The whole experience was fantastic. The restaurant had a bright and rustic feel, and all the servers were extremely attentive but not overbearing. We ordered the beef carpaccio, ricotta, mushrooms with egg, ravioli special, bucatini, and hangar steak. We were given the choice of splitting these into 2 or  3 courses (we chose 3). Beef carpaccio was incredibly tasty. The meat was super soft and I loved the rye crisps on top for a different texture. The mushroom with egg was really tasty too - my boyfriend dislikes mushroom but says this was his favorite dish! Ricotta was dreamyyy. It was heavenly matched with the cinnamon pears. I couldn't stop eating it! Bucatini was a very decent, al-dente, classic dish with added spiciness. The ravioli was a special - it consisted of 2 very large pockets filled with cheese and egg. The egg was definitely a novel concept to me! This dish was very heavy and could barely finish my one ravioli. Last was the steak. We were SO full by this point. I really enjoyed this steak - the portion is smaller than most places would serve but the texture was on point. Perfectly charred on the outside with a medium rare interior. The potatoes on the side was also delicious, and they gave an (unnecessarily) massive amount of creme fraiche on the side.I'm so happy I got to try L'Artusi, and am already looking forward to coming back to try more pasta dishes! The pasta and cheese are definitely the star of this restaurant. Come hungry!!",4,,1
19,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,204,100,5.0,9/5/2018,"This restaurant has basically been on my list since I moved to NYC a year ago and I finally was able to try it!!I officially made a reservation for Saturday night at 9:45, which is pretty typical, because their times always sell out way in advance. However, I called couple days before and was able to get my reservation moved to 7:15 and then called day of at 6 PM and was able to score a 8:30 PM reservation. Think it's pretty easy to get a table if you call them day of! Anyways, we walked in and the decor was pretty simple, but classy. No frills and no crazy decorations. I'll list out what we ordered below: -Roasted mushrooms ($17): this was a dish that i just kind of skimmed over, but after reading yelp reviews i decided that we needed to order this. I'm so glad we did, because this ended up being both of our favorite dishes of the night. It was spicy, savory, tangy so many complex flavors in this seemingly simple dish. Highly recommend this gets a 5/5 for me!-Charred octopus ($18): delicious!! this was basically hard olives, charred octopus, and potatoes. Like the roasted mushrooms, there were so many different flavors to this dish. Again, it was a little spicy and also a little sour due to the lemon on top. I loved the garlicky taste mixed with the preserved taste in the olives and the octopus was cooked perfectly!! Thought this dish was a little salty, but other than that I loved it. 5/5-Garganelli ($18): basically the sauce in this dish is made completely with mushrooms. I thought that the mushroom was a little overpowering. I definitely think that if you were dining with a group of three and sharing a lot of stuff, this would be a good pasta to split in 3 and try a couple of bites of. Since it was just me and my boyfriend, I thought that the flavor here got a little old. The pasta however, was cooked to perfection! I thought that this was a new level of al dente. Hard to explain, but it was delicious. 4/5-Spaghetti ($19): this dish looked so simple on the menu, but our waiter recommended it to us, so we decided to try it. It is basically just a garlic spaghetti with some spice to it. I thought that it was really delicious and more complex than it sounded. Wasn't completely blown away though 4/5-olive oil cake ($10): I ordered this, because everyone raves about it on yep. I thought it was pretty good, but a little strange. At first, it just strongly tasted of olive oil and I wasnt sure if I liked it....but after taking a couple of more bites, it tasted like a poppy seed muffin or even a corn bread muffin? Not really sure how i feel about this. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say that it's a must 4/5Overall, really enjoyed my experience at l'artusi. I think I enjoyed the small plate/appetizers more than the pasta, but maybe that's just because of the choices we decided to make. I definitely will be back to try some of the other things on the menu!",,,2
20,Gavie V.,"New York, NY",130,56,94,5.0,6/13/2018,"Many years later and my boyfriend still gets nervous to pick restaurants for special dates...He hit the bar high at L'Artusi! I was satisfied with every dish that we ordered. We had 3 from the specials menus and 2 from the staple. Specials (ranked by favorite): -Lamb Shank (tender, juicy and huge)-Ricotta cheese with a pineapple compote (reminded me of a deconstructed cheesecake)- Cappelletti Pasta in a lemon sauceOn the menu:-Garganelli (mushroom ragu, wow)-Roasted Mushrooms (live up to the hype)The portions were great for sharing which is perfect as we love to try as much as possible. The lamb shank was much bigger than expected though so I would probably do one less dish if I am ever lucky enough to catch it on the menu again. High flavor profile especially on the mushroom dishes. The ricota salata on the garganelli and mushrooms was to die for. As a cheese lover I would be okay with just that. Don't skip out on the drinks either! The Bodega Flower and it's cute name won me over like my neighborhood bodega cat from day 1.",,1,1

The bar area is a bit tight, but that's to be expected. What was a pleasant surprise was the loft dining area, that was much more intimate and not as loud. They even have a separate dining room toward the rear of the loft situated against a wall of wine.Did I mention the great service?The spaghetti, Bolognese, ravioli, the wine, the apple crisp dessert and the sorbetti were fabulous. Incredible flavors especially the seared octopus. The sliced olives were silky smooth and delicate.

Sitting at the chef's seats is a must experience for those who love watching the kitchen at work!Having spent 6 months living in Tuscany, I'm constantly on the hunt for great Italian food. American-Italian is its own cuisine so it's hard to find anything that is truly inspired by Italian roots.L'Artusi was a splurge dinner for myself and a girlfriend. We arrived and were offered the chef seats at the dining bar. It was such a special experience!I loved watching the cohesive effort of such an organized kitchen, and by seeing all the food that came out, it gave me a better idea of what to order.The staff was on top of everything, accommodating, and friendly.

Updated review","I came to L'Artusi for a second time for a 7:15 reservation for two people. Upon arrival we asked for Nick to be our waiter and the hostess told us Nick was on vacation. It all went downhill from there. Our waitress was extremely rude and condescending towards us (tall woman with curly reddish-brown hair pulled in a bun).We had trouble deciding what to order for our mains but knew we wanted the beef carpaccio  to start. When we asked our waitress for a minute to decide which pastas we wanted to order she said ""she couldn't give us any time"" and ""she could not place our orders unless they were placed at that very second"".  And we had to order everything for our entire meal at that exact moment. The beef carpaccio came out suspiciously fast.  It came out at fast food speed. We received the beef carpaccio legitimately 5 minutes after placing the order. On top of that, the waitress didn't give us bread with the beef carpaccio. The rude waitress just slammed the plate down. We had not even finished half of the beef carpaccio, but the waitress decided to put both of our pastas on the table. We asked if we could have the pasta after we finished our appetizer (aka can she pace the meal instead of rushing us...). She said no, she would not take the two dishes away EVEN to be kept warm in the kitchen. Our waitress was insistent that the pastas had to sit and get cold on our table while we finished the appetizer. For a fine establishment, shouldnt the meal be paced properly? Why should a guest at their restaurant be reprimanded ?PASTAS: Wild Boar Ragu- we substituted the cavatelli for garganelli.  This was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I wish I could order delivery of the wild boar pasta and eat it every night for the rest of my life.",5,2,1
26,Anna K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,39,163,4.0,9/23/2018,"We were here on Sunday brunch and were really hungry. Ordered steak, breakfast and ricotta crepes, steak was too tasteless for me, not enough salt or pepper and small. Potato over-roasted as for me, eggs were good but nothing special for that place. Maybe we should have ordered pasta but there is no big choice for brunch. Small brunch menu in general.",,,
27,Jillian L.,"New York, NY",386,311,118,4.0,3/20/2018,"L'Artusi sits unassumingly on a quiet street in the West Village. While the exterior may not look like much, the inside is cozy, warm, and full of life. My friend and I had reservations on a weekend night. Note that their tables are reservations only (via Open Table or their landline). Bar seating is reserved for walk-ins. That being said, the restaurant is quite large, spanning two floors, with a private room in the back - perfect for a family dinner or a date night. If you do come in a party of two, be prepared for New York style seating where you could practically share dishes and swap dinner conversations with the neighboring table.  Service was impeccable from start to finish! My friend had trouble keeping his spoon on the table, but without missing a beat, someone was always there bringing him a new one. We had the beef carpaccio and chicories salad to start. The carpaccio was full of flavor and melted in my mouth. Our neighbors' chicories salad arrived before our's did and my eyes widened when I saw the portion. It was a mountain of lettuce! The dressing was lemony and bursting with anchovy. Yum! Definitely for those who love anchovies.For our pasta course, we ordered the garganelli, seemingly the crowd favorite, and the bucatini. The mushroom ragu in the garganelli tasted very earthy and the texture was paste-like. Not my favorite but I had to give it a try. The bucatini on the other hand was the real star - perfect blend of tomato, chilis, and pancetta coating each strand!For dessert, we had the hazelnut torta and swapped the salted caramel gelato for the lemon olive oil gelato. Best decision of the night! I enjoyed the lemon olive oil gelato more than I did the torta. Overall, L'Artusi totally met expectations. Still not the best pasta I've ever had but for the price, portions, quality, service, and atmosphere, definitely a winner in my books!",3,2,2
28,Jonelle T.,"Bellevue, WA",331,469,307,4.0,3/8/2018,"L'Artusi is awesome and we had a wonderful meal here. While we weren't able to get a reservation, we managed to walk in and snag two seats at the bar, which served their full menu. The restaurant is bustling and slightly noisy when full. We shared the charred octopus as a starter and it was fabulous. The octopus was tender and the chilis/olives/pancetta/potato combination really complimented it. While the pasta portions looked a little on the small side, they were actually very filling and delicious. The mushroom garganelli was very earthy and the ricotta salata added a nice saltiness to the dish, while the wild boar cavatelli was rich with flavor. Both pastas were cooked just al dente with a slight bite, and you could taste the amount of labor in the sauces.Would love to come back and try a different assortment of their dishes!",3,,1
29,Elizabeth T.,"Hoboken, NJ",180,58,26,4.0,8/19/2018,"I have to admit my expectations were very high after reading so many raving reviews.  But overall my experience was okay at best.  Roasted Mushrooms - 4/5 I wasn't excited about this one but it was surprisingly good.  The eggs complemented the mushrooms very nicely. Beef Carpaccio - 4/5 the bread crumbs were a nice touch!  The beef itself was good but not as flavorful as I wanted.Gnocchi - 3/5 Agreed with other reviews that the gnocchi is amazingly soft and pillowy but the flavor in the sauce was lacking and somewhat bland.  Kind of a disappointment.Garganelli - 3/5 The mushroom ragu sauce was amazing (can there be a canned version of this?) but the pasta was okay, a bit too al dente.  I felt like this would have been five stars if it came with a different pasta.Olive Oil Cake 5/5 - Everyone was right about this one.  The cake was SO moist.  Also, the creme accompanying the dish was amazing and made the dessert even more moist.Service was definitely 5 stars.  The waiters were extremely attentive and there was never a moment of having to ""look"" for them for something.  Portions are somewhat small but we were full with just 2 appetizers and 2 pasta dishes.  The restaurant itself is actually larger than it looks with an upstairs section and a long bar.  The atmosphere is very classy, trendy, West Village-esqe.  Reservations are hard to come by but sometimes you can get lucky if you look the day before (I did!).",,,
30,Ayumi W.,"San Francisco, CA",394,175,325,5.0,2/23/2018,"Don't hesitate, just go. Go eat at L'Artusi. The pasta is incredible, unique, flavorful, and plenty. The ricotta starter is superb. The olive oil cake is sweet but light. Also, can olive oil actually taste this good? The interior is modern chic and will make you feel like you're eating at the trendy, insider restaurant (which you are). Plenty of birthday celebrations are happening here, and heck, I might choose this place for my bday next year. We read on Infatuation to skip the entree and focus on the pasta. So we had the mushroom ragú and the bavette with clams. Both were so different but done exceptionally well. The ragú was surprising thick and heavy and flavorful. Almost makes you think you're eating meat for a second...the bavette is spicy, so be warned, weaklings. Loved the jalapeño addition though I really wish the clams actually had clams in them - most were empty shells. Or perhaps these little guys blended in with the breadcrumbs and I missed it while I devoured this down? Either way, I would love to come back...maybe next time at a reasonable hour and not at 11pm :) What a way to end the day.",5,,1
31,Sean T.,"New York, NY",1,22,0,5.0,11/14/2018,"Amazing. I was taken here for my birthday day dinner and it did not disappoint. They had this steak tartare (normally not my thing) on toast and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten. The pasta dishes and roasted chicken were equally as good and they did a free scoop of gelato for desert. Trendy, comfortable, kinda pricey, great date spot, and worth every penny.",,,
32,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",413,305,542,4.0,7/9/2018,"Does this place need another glowing review thrown into the pile? No, probably not, but I'll give it one anyways.I'd been dying to try L'Artusi for YEARS, but it had never worked out for one reason or another. Finally got a chance to go for a casual weekend date night. Secured a reservation for two on a Sunday (5:45 was the only spot available even weeks in advance). The restaurant was probably 75% full, despite only having opened for dinner service 15 minutes before. We requested a seat at the bar, which I think was the way to go as the tables were quite cramped. Despite the place being completely packed, service - even at the bar - was on point the entire night.We ordered:- Roasted mushrooms: lives up to the hype. I don't know how they've drawn so much flavor out of these unassuming mushrooms (lots of butter and salt, probably), but the combo with the fried egg, pancetta, and salted ricotta is probably one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.- Dayboat scallop crudo: super fresh (dayboat scallops are basically small batch scallops), thinly sliced raw scallops simply dressed with olive oil and sea salt. I'm a little obsessed with scallops, so just had to try these. Very refreshing and tasty dish for the summer.- Pasta: we ordered the garganelli with mushroom ragu, spaghetti, and bavette with clams. I'd have to say the pasta portion of the meal actually fell shortest of my expectations, but I also have the feeling that we ordered the wrong things. That isn't to say the pasta wasn't good (it was delicious), but just that it wasn't AS good as the rest of the amazing meal. Out of the three, I'd have to say my favorite was the garganelli (didn't even miss the meat), and least favorite was the spaghetti.- Olive oil cake: obviously had to finish with this for dessert. It comes with golden raisins in a sweet wine reduction and creme fraiche. Make sure to get a bit of each element in every bite - perfect combo of sweet and savory!Wholeheartedly recommend L'Artusi for any occasion. I will definitely come back to finish eating my way through the pasta menu.",3,1,1
33,Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",130,518,505,5.0,2/10/2018,"Been waiting forever to try this place - it's definitely worth all the hype. The food here was incredible and there was not a single dish I didn't like. It started out a bit rough though because they we had to wait an hour for our table even though we had a reservation well in advance but tables were just not getting up to leave! When we finally did get seated, we were quickly waited on. We started with the gnocchi with lamb ragu and they also gave us a complimentary ravioli! Both pasta dishes were so delicious - the pasta was soft and loved the flavor of the sauces. We then had our large chicken plate and branzino that came on top of a bed of olives - great if you like olives. The branzino was good but the chicken was absolutely amazing - definitely the one dish I recommend above all else! It was a little on the salty side but it was so scrumptious especially with the herb sauce it came with.",3,,2

35,Russ L.,"New Haven, CT",57,120,485,5.0,2/24/2018,"L'Artusi is an exceptional restaurant. The food, service, and atmosphere are all outstanding. Right when you walk in, the staff are attentive and do everything they can to ensure you are having a good experience. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and offer great recommendations. They were very accommodating to me as a vegetarian and are attentive towards allergies. L'Artusi offers a unique and modern take on Italian food. You won't find traditional dishes here. The recipes are complex and exciting while still comforting the palate like Italian food should.The food at this place is so delicious. Even the bread and olive oil is memorable. The butter lettuce salad is a stack of whole butter lettuce leaves with a creamy dressing and blue cheese. It is such an interesting way to eat a salad and it works well. The Brussels sprouts are cooked well and packed with flavor and sharp cheese. The spaghetti is perfectly cooked and the chilis add a good bite of flavour. The ravioli is rich and creamy with a bit of sweetness. The dessert we had was so decadent and delicious. We had the dark chocolate mousse dessert. It was so smooth and chocolatey and rich and creamy all at once. Every bite was superb. The crispy dark chocolate cookie added a nice crunch to it. We were also brought complementary ricotta cheese with crackers as well as a small dish of another type of buttery ravioli that was very tasty. They have an extensive menu of drinks that are also just as outstanding. L'Artusi has some of the most inventive and delicious Italian food I've ever eaten. The food and service are all executed perfectly. Every moment spent here and every bite of food is an absolute delight.",1,1,1
36,Debbie L.,"New York, NY",55,93,203,5.0,7/25/2018,"I made a reservation nearly a month in advance to get a seat during weekend. The standout of the night was the beef tartar. Would 10/10 recommend. The pasta that we ordered (daily special) was good, but the spaghetti was quite soft. I prefer pastas al dente, but i think it was because the pasta was fresh, it lacked a bit of chewiness. The swordfish was also really good. I would not get it next time I go, but was a good try. Service was attentive, it was quite crowded on a saturday night. Definitely want to try again in the future to taste some of their other menus.",,,1
37,Jen N.,"Jersey City, NJ",84,16,28,5.0,7/8/2018,"Wow. Stopped in on a whim last night as I was in the area doing some shopping and wanted pasta. But, not just average pasta. I wanted the best that you could find. A quick yelp search brought me here and just based on the reviews, I knew I had to try it. I walked in at 5:27pm (they open at 5:30) and already there were 10 people waiting. I somehow (again, at 5:30) managed to get the last seat. Lucky me since the entire dining experience was top notch even at the bar. Atmosphere: Is casual up-scale a thing? The place is much bigger than it seems from the outside with a long, beautiful bar, tables and booths on the side and an open kitchen in the back. There's a skylight in the middle of the dining room which lets in the perfect amount of light so the space doesn't seem too dark despite the very sleek (and chic), grey walls. Vibe is chill and buzzy and not too loud. Great for dates or small family gatherings. Location: cute, quiet west village street. Pretty unassuming from the outside. Also extra points for being down the street from Van Leeuwen. Service: others have said the service is fantastic and yet I was still blown away. My bar tender/ server was so nice and helpful. Timing was spot on and never did I feel rushed to finish my meal despite not having a reservation. Drink: Pleased that they had a pretty large and interesting cocktail menu that wasn't just twists on aperol spritzes (sorry, not a fan!). I got the Just Add Flower which was kind of like a grown up slushie but in the best way possible. Food: 5/5! I started with a cold cauliflower soup that was complimentary from the kitchen which was yummy. The homemade ricotta with pickled strawberries came with these amazing crackers that almost tasted like salted crunchy fillo dough and at $7.. definitely a bang for your buck. Finally, the pasta. Hard choice between the spaghetti and tagliatelle which according to the bartender are the best sellers. Ended up getting the tagliatelle and am happy I did. I still can't get over how wide yet thin the noodles were and yet so perfectly al dente. Ate so much and somehow didn't get that gross, ""I ate too much pasta"" feeling afterwards. Overall:  a must try in NYC! Reservations clearly needed unless you come at opening.",1,,1
38,Sean W.,"New York, NY",3,329,483,4.0,7/26/2018,"L'Artusi is an upscale Italian restaurant serving typical appetizers, pastas, fish, meat, and desserts along with a modest wine menu. The venue is very modern looking and chic with a large bar, booth seatings, and normal dining tables. Service by the server was excellent, our waitress was knowledgable and very sweet; however, we were made to wait an additional 20 minutes beyond our reservation time, which isn't professional. The prices are typical for an upscale Italian restaurant.OrderedHamachi - good and basicRicotta and jam - basicGnocchi - Really good chewiness level, red sauce with basil and the light rabbit meatiness was on point. The parmesan was very thinly shredded and was a good textureGnudi - even potato-ier cousin of Gnocchi. Came with swiss chard, chanterelles, corn, tarragon, aleppo. The texture of the potato was great. The sauce was hearty, but I didn't really get the corn. Still an overall good dish.",,,

Great texture and hearty sauces. Brussels were great - nicely roasted. Olive oil cake was fab. The salted caramel gelato that came with the hazelnut dessert was the best thing ever, though I didn't care for the torta itself. It was a bit dry and didn't really stand out. 4.5 stars.",1,,2
40,CJ M.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,90,22,5.0,10/6/2018,"Came for a quick bite late night. Was packed at 10pm. Sat at the bar. The service was attentive. Ordered non alcoholic beverage and they offered to make me a cocktail. Asked sweet or savory. There sent an amuse of chilled zucchini soup that was bright, slightly salty, and definitely got my taste buds . I could have had a bowl of it for sure.I received a delicious savory sour drink with a cucumber hint. It was really delicious. It was palate cleansing and refreshing.Also ordered scape spaghetti. Portions look a little small, but it was super rich. There were crunchy bits of something crouton-like. It's so dark, I couldn't see it, but the texture was a great counterpart to the creaminess of the pasta. The pieces of scape were small so it wasn't as garlicky. I think it's one of my favorite pasta dishes. Maybe it's because it was a smaller portion that it made me crave it more.There was also a gift of ravioli. Three pieces of delicate, savory purses of beets with ricotta cheese topped with shaved Parmesan. I'd eat a plate of that too.I was full but had to try out three of the desserts - on my own, so I asked them to pack it to go. Olive oil cake, peach crostata and hazelnut torta. Definitely bring friends and try all the dishes. If I had another day in NYC, I'd be back here to try all the dishes. My new favorite NYC restaurant.My only complaint is their complimentary bread - it's just okay, poor filler. You don't have to eat it so I guess it's just extra.",,,
41,Brandon R.,"Boston, MA",14,19,2,5.0,10/7/2018,"My wife and I just dined here for our 5 year anniversary, and we were treated like royalty.The wine selection is a broad tour of Italy, with wines grouped by region and paired to the foods of that region. We had a lovely pair of white and red selections.From there, an assortment of dishes, each expertly made and thoughtfully conceived. The beef carpaccio with roasted garlic crostini crumbs and horseradish finish was amazing, the beet salad is fresh and flavorful. Zucchini is in season I think, since we had a lovely taste of their coldZucchini soup (similar to a gazpacho) that had a ton of flavor.  And oh my God the wild mushroom with fried egg and light cheese (pecorino I think, but maybe something lighter) was incredible.The rabbit gnocchi was quite nice, next time I'll probably go with The tagliatelle, which looked amazing.One of the best meals I've ever had. And for what it's worth, the best Staff I've ever had; our server was attentive, charismatic, patient and an expert, practiced hand at pouring wine and handling dishes, which bears notice.",,,

43,Carina F.,"Manhattan, NY",301,147,195,4.0,12/24/2017,"I'm so glad I finally made it here! It's been bookmarked for way too long. I booked a 10:30pm slot on OpenTable a month in advance (prime dinner time rezzies were pretty much gone, especially on Christmas weekend Saturday). We generally eat late anyway so its all good.We arrived on time and were offered a coat check which we declined, and were brought to the 2nd floor. The tables are a tad too close for comfort, so minus 0.5* for that. The vibe is super chill and can be dressed up too. Servers were super helpful and VERY down to earth, which made the experience even better. We started off with drinks- me with the Rose, and the boyfriend with his IPA (as always). I will say, their Rose is tart so not for everyone. Ordered the roasted mushrooms which IS NOT as bland as it sounds on the menu....the addition of a fried egg + cheese + peppers really made this an excellent starter choice! Bread is standard w/ EVOO which came next. He ordered the Orechiette (sausage, salumi, pecorino) which was SO flavorful. We thought it was saltier than we would prefer, and felt inclined to mellow it out with bread. (minus 0.5*)I LOVED my Tagliatelle. Like, I enjoy making my own pasta, but HOW is this pasta so springy and full of texture? I now have a newfound determination to emulate this in my own kitchen. Talk about inspiration. Bolognese was perfect. When (not if) I return, I am definitely ordering this again, and coming in with a larger appetite. We saved room for their renown olive oil cake and it did not disappoint! FYI- it comes with a raisin sauce. I'm not a fan of raisins at all, but I THOROUGHLY enjoyed dipping my bit of cake into the raisin sauce and topping it with a bit of whipped cream before popping it in my mouth. Delicious.Note: totally either a dress up or down spot; its completely up to you. Chill music tracks too. I think if I were to do it again, I would want to sit at the bar. We were wayyyy to close to the couple next to us. And by WAYYYYY I mean, I felt like I heard more of their conversation than my own lol and I wasn't even intentionally eavesdropping!! like, I don't need to hear her interrogating him on how much he made and his salary response. Seriously awkward.I observed a private dining room (wine celler-esque) area encased in glass on the 2nd floor. I made a mental note to file away in the back of my mind for the next time I wanted to look for an intimate private party space.",5,1,1

Whenever we come to NYC, this is one of the places on my list. From the crudo, to insalate, to the various selections of formaggio, pesce, e carne, you will have a tough time choosing what to have. They also have quite a selection of wines, and many years ago I sat in the wine library for dinner and it was quite lovely. Last night we had little gem salad with green goddess, Parmesan frico, and radish; bavette pasta with Manila clams, jalapeño, and breadcrumbs; finally, the red snapper with corn, fregola, heirloom tomatoes, and Manila clams. For dessert, we had a 1er Cru Champagne to go along with our hazelnut torta with salted caramel gelato. Delizioso!",,,

My friends and I shared:- wagyu beef tartare appetizer - brussel sprouts w/ lemon, pepper, and pecorino sideand I ordered the buckwheat cavatelli (boar ragu w/ parmesan), and for dessert we ordered: - the famous olive oil cake- the hazelnut torta- and housemade gelatoWe enjoyed our meal throughout each course, but I was personally digging into the brussel sprouts and my hazelnut torta the most. Personally, I would opt for another option than the cavatelli as the boar - though tender - didn't come through with as much flavor as I was expecting, and made the dish feel a little bland. Though I am confident I would enjoy the other dishes! To tie it all off, the hazelnut torta was amazing - the pralines gave just enough crunch to offset the sweet chocolate, and the salted caramel gelato really just threw it over the edge in terms of deliciousness. Would get again, and recommend, any day.",1,,1

For apps we got two orders of the mushroom and the beef tartare special. Both equally amazing. For entrees we all picked different pastas to try. My favorite was the Spaghetti! It was phenomenal.

It is getting impossible to get a seat!  I'm here to tell you, the cat is out of the bag. This is a busy little place! After an early show let out, I stopped in to see if I could snag a bar top seat and was told I could be seated immediately! I'm a lucky guy! It was excellent. After ordering, I was surprised with a delightful Butternut Squash amuse buch. Chicory salads appear to be a ""thing"" in New York. I've not seen them elsewhere yet and that is a shame. The slight bitter green was tempered with an ample amount of Pecorino and a wonderful anchovy dressing. I ordered the Tagliatelle with white Ragu and it was great the kitchen sent out a complimentary Kale Ravioli and I almost wished I'd ordered that instead (almost-decisions decisions!) The Strawberry Crostata was a perfect finish. I can't think of anything that didn't ring true here at L'Artusi. Ok, maybe one thing. Either the bar was too tall, or the seats are too short, but I can't stop feeling like a 7 year old eating without a booster seat for the first time. If that is the only issue you can find at a restaurant, book it again, quickly! That's my recommendation here!",2,2,2

The ambiance, decor, staff,  wine list, etc. was perfect and the menu had a variety of dishes for any palette. I had made a reservation a couple weeks out for my birthday dinner and Boy am I glad I did! This is a chic restaurant in a semi-opened kitchen and nothing less than 5 stars.Our server was the best, extremely friendly and aware of the table all night. Our table enjoyed these dishes:Verdura: Chicories - parmesan, lemon, anchovy dressingThis salad was light, with a tint of lemon, and a refreshing way to start the evening.Pasta: Spaghetti - garlic, chilies, parmesan The homemade pasta was cooked to perfection assisted with a kick of heat to the garlic sauce.Tagliatelle - bolognese bianco, parmesanThe wider pasta was delicious in the bolognese bianco sauce.Carne:Roasted Pork Chop - cabbage, apple, pancetta, walnut pestoThis dish was served to quality and excellence. This may have been the most beautiful and colorful dish I have ever been served. Do yourself a favor and order it, it was cooked to the perfect temperature.Contorni:Crispy potatoes served salsa biancoThe potatoes were crispy and delicious. But what was perfectly complimentary to them was the salso bianco. There is one word to describe these creme fraiche and it is heavenly.Now on to the desserts, the Dolci-I have rated the desserts from my favorite to least favorite. I was lucky enough to try most of the desserts from the help of my friends for my birthday!1. Yogurt Panna Cotta - pomagranate, candied almonds,lemon-sugar cookie. This was one of the best desserts/panna cotta I have ever eaten!2. Hazelnut Chocolate Torta - praline crunch, salted caramel gelato. Chocolate goodness in a bite!3. Housemade Gelati & Sorbetti - rum cherry flavor4. Warm Apple Tart - caramelized apple, cider reduction, buttermilk gelato 5. Olive Oil Cake - golden raisin marmellata, vin santo,creme fraiche mousse.

Today though I felt that the degradation in overall quality is certifiably a trend now. Undercooked meat, over salted food, checks handed before asking for it et al.

I've been here twice for dinner and most recently for brunch and have thoroughly enjoyed all three visits. They do have lighter options and smaller portions for brunch so if you want the full three course experience, I would come here for dinner.Between three girls, we shared the small pastry basket and three pastas. We ordered the mushroom ragu, tagliatelle, and carbonara. All three were amazing, but the favorite of the group was the mushroom ragu. The sauce is earthy and pairs perfectly with the garganelli, but it is quite mushroom-y so if you don't like mushroom, this might not be for you. Another reason why I prefer coming for dinner is because their famous olive oil cake is only served then. 50% of the reason why I come here is because of the olive oil cake so we were all disappointed to find out that this wasn't served during brunch.

61,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",728,287,1309,5.0,10/23/2017,"Have been wanting to try L'Artusi for a while, but it's pretty tough to get a reservation. Can book on OpenTable 30 days before. I finally got a dinner reservation for Sunday for my mom's birthday. The restaurant is shareable small plates style, but some dishes are definitely heartier than a tapa would be. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. We ended up getting: - their version of a Caesar salad: I can always go for a yummy Caesar, and this one was a good portion to share too!- sweetbreads: fried chewy deliciousness- 4 pastas: the spaghetti (their signature dish and my favorite pasta of the night!), the clam pasta without jalapeños (also very tasty and plentiful amount of clams), the tagliatelle (nothing to complain about), and the gnocchi (so soft and cheesy and pillowy!)I had called beforehand to mention the birthday and order a dessert. The waitress got the note and brought out the candle with an ice cream dessert on the house. We also got the hazelnut dessert and one cheese ($7) to share. While timing between dishes was slightly prolonged at times, I had a really great experience here because the service was fantastic! Our waitress was super friendly and great at recommending popular dishes on the menu. She also suggested a good bottle of wine for us. Another server was knowledgeable about describing in detail the specials of the night and recommending a cheese based on my preferences (the buffalo cheese was semi soft and pungent). Nothing beats friendly and competent staff at restaurants! The cute and crisp atmosphere was also surprisingly spacious. The fact that it was completely packed on a Sunday night shows the popularity. Portions were good where we actually took a little bit of leftovers between the three of us sharing the six dishes. Best of all, the value was great at about $250 total including a $72 bottle of wine plus the cheese and dessert. 5 stars!!",2,,1
62,Jason F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/5/2018,I've dined at L'Artusi maybe 4 or 5 times now. Amazing every single time. The roasted mushrooms dish - simply amazing. Beef carpaccio has this delicious crunch. Also they this chicken - which I never order chicken out but it's so juicy and delicious. Simply put one of my favorite restaurants in NYC!,,,
63,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",237,79,37,5.0,12/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night without a reservation and the host was extremely nice about seating us after an hour wait (we even ended up with a table and not just a bar seat!). We split a cheese, La Tur, the Spaghetti, and I had the branzino filet while my boyfriend had the pork chops. We ended dinner with the bittersweet chocolate budino. The food here is simply amazing. The cheese was impeccable and the crackers that accompanied it are hands down the best crackers I've ever had. The Spaghetti was a good portion, especially to split as an appetizer, and I loved the garlic taste it had with it. The branzino I had was very good as well and cooked extremely well, and the pork chops were very tasty, tender, and juicy. We ordered cocktails along the meal as well and they were also very good. I left this meal feeling very comfortable and not super overstuffed (which can be common among other Italian places). The only thing that could have been slightly improved was the timing of the food. We had to wait a pretty long time for the food to come out, so service was lacking in that respect, but the food is so good here I would definitely come back for another meal.",,,
64,Natasha B.,"Manhattan, NY",39,114,166,1.0,4/29/2018,I was really excited to try this restaurant and so disappointed when completed my meal. I came for brunch and had the tagliatelle pasta which was not even al dente and had no flavor. My mother got the french toast which was a nice portion to share but mediocre and oily. Will definitely not be returning here.,1,,
65,Joanna R.,"San Francisco, CA",403,441,369,5.0,5/14/2018,"Sometimes you go to a restaurant and wonder why all the rave reviews... This place is not one of them. I could not leave New York without writing about the amazing meal I had last night with my husband at L'Artusi. The decor of the restaurant itself is extremely quaint and has a lovely romantic ambience for a date or special occasion. Speaking of special occasions, the folks next to us were celebrating an anniversary and the girls to our right were there for a birthday. It really speaks to how wonderful this place is.Our server was the right amount of attentive, and was never pushy with menu options or with expensive wine. He was discreet in asking us what our price point was and what kind we liked to drink. We ended up with a $100 bottle with his blessing and it was divine, even though we're not really fans of Italian wine, per se.We started our meal with a selection of cheeses and some complimentary bread, which paired excellent with the vino. For dinner we had the bucatini, the papardelle, and the steak. The star was the bucatini, and I think this restaurant really outdoes itself with their fresh pastas. Steak was good but too raw for our liking even though we requested medium. The dessert was also tasty but I can't remember what it was, as this was after the consumption of the full wine bottle. Thank you so much for having us and I cannot recommend this place enough. What a lovely and unforgettable evening for this couple from California. We can only be so lucky as to return one day. Cheers.",,,1
66,Jorge L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",33,129,10,4.0,10/22/2018,Came for dinner late night with no reservation but were seated at the bar after a short walk. The place is elegant but relaxed and has a cool vibe. The menu was interesting but lacked sole options for my wife who doesn't eat spicy food. Almost all the pasta dishes had some kind of pepper or spice component. The gnocchi I ordered were delicious and perfectly prepared. They were slightly spicy which is great for me but my wife ended up getting the carpaccio since there was no pasta without spice that caught her eye.,,,
67,Emily J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,0,5.0,11/16/2018,"This polished, airy West Village charmer is a magnet for beautiful people. Or maybe it's just that everyone looks gorgeous in L'Artusi's romantically lit room, divvied up into three dining options and a quiet mezzanine, alongside its more traditional dining area. A semi-open kitchen, polished and gleaming with stainless steel, pushes out wickedly good Italian dishes like tender potato gnocchi in a rabbit cacciatore, laced with garlic, sweet tomato, rosemary and sage; or perfectly charred octopus paired with creamy potatoes, spiked with chilies, olives and savory pancetta. Polish that off with a drink from their generous list of aperitivi or fantastic selection of wines by the glass, and you'll be feeling quite beautiful yourself by dinner's end.",,,
68,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,230,306,4.0,10/8/2017,"Lovely, straightforward place with very good food. We came during brunch and sat at one of the two bars (sit at the inner one! It gets more light and you're in the middle of the space), and really enjoyed the atmosphere the entire time. I ordered the breakfast bruschetta and mushroom garganelli. The bruschetta came in one large piece - deliciously thick pancetta, melted fontina everywhere, and a perfectly fried egg draped over that, all over a hearty slice of crusty bread. A little too salty for me, but otherwise the epitome of everything I want in my mouth at brunch. The garganelli was alright. I'm not sure it deserves its 'must order' status - maybe I got a funny batch, but my pasta was oddly inconsistent in texture. Some parts were normal, then mid-chew I'd notice an especially al dente spot that was chunkier than the rest. Even that aside, I thought the flavors were rather one-dimensional as the taste of mushroom was pretty much the only thing discernible - the dish comes topped with fine ricotta shavings (which they call ricotta insalata, which baffles me because what is the similarity to salad?) that are delightful when eaten alone, but too delicate to add much when eaten with the ragu.Overall L'Artusi didn't strike me as particularly memorable this time around, but that doesn't mean the food wasn't good, and I'd certainly come back again to try dinner.",1,,
69,Dasle K.,"New York, NY",668,275,1667,4.0,8/30/2017,"Incredible dinner. I came here with a girlfriend and we really enjoyed our meal experience.What we had:Heirloom tomato salad: OMG so good. Might not seem like much but the ingredients were so fresh and amazing.Branzino: The portion was really small but the fish melts in your mouth! Spicy pasta with clams: This was our least favorite dish. It was a bit too much sauce - very salty/spicy. I wish we ordered a different pasta because they look amazing :(The highlight of our meal was dessert. We couldn't choose between the hazelnut chocolate torta and olive oil cake, and our waiter surprised us with both! Both desserts are out of this world good. ORDER BOTH! Can't wait to be back to try everything else on the menu. 4.5 stars!",6,,1

71,Benjamin L.,"New York, NY",112,60,224,5.0,9/3/2017,"9/10 EAT HERE (if you can get a table?). You will not be disappointed. It doesn't really matter what you order, everything is interesting and has a real depth of flavor, even the bread and oil served from the start of the meal. I've tried a number of the ceviches and pastas and everything was superb. I'm not much of a raw eater, yet I found the wagyu beef tartar special to be delicious and overwhelmed any strangeness from eating raw red meat. My favorite pasta is probably the lamb ragu - the meat is exceedingly tender and the sauce has a unique, comforting taste. The octopus is tender and tasty and the steak was juicy and rich. I don't think I've been disappointed with a single entree or drink I have tried. For dessert I would recommend the olive oil cake - the rest of the desserts are good but didn't leave a lasting impression.The staff are very attentive and I've never had an issue with the service. My dining compatriots have utilized the sommelier extensively and as a result we ended up with very interesting wines that felt unique and added to the meals extensive flavor pallet. I've eaten at the bar and in the upstairs area and both had an elegant vibe that our group enjoyed. This stands out as a must try NYC establishment.",3,,
72,Jow H.,"Lawai, HI",0,75,9,4.0,10/23/2018,"Not as good as hype. Dishes incl octopus, famous spaghetti, ricotta cheese, mushrooms and branzino. Of those, spaghetti was best. Service was very attentive and friendly.",,,
73,John Y.,"New York, NY",55,149,557,4.0,11/4/2017,"I came here for a very late dinner.We sat near the front. This is Italian food but ""fancier"".The portions are small, almost appetizer portions at entre prices. You would not expect anything less. I was a bit shocked, but came to accept it. It was about quality and not quantity. Things I orderedRoasted mushrooms - very good and good flavor and some spiceSpaghetti - I was suspicious of paying 18$ for a small plate of it, it was very good and great texture. I would recommend itRoasted pork chop - this was the biggest dish and biggest piece of pork chop I've ever had or seen in my life. The pork chop has Apple, raisins, and becaon. Very good but the pork chop was medium and had some blood, but the waiter assured me that it was safe to eat.Side order of brussel sprouts - it was great but it seems a bit too greasy, there was too much oil.Dessert hazelnut, chocolate with salted Caramel gelatoMost of the dishes had Parmesan cheese shavings, I'm not big fan of cheese so I would ask for less if it next time.This was a good place for high end Italian food, if you want something pricey and more casual try Carmine's.",,,
74,Samantha G.,"Clifton, NJ",1,4,11,5.0,7/1/2018,"L'Artusi is hands down my favorite restaurant in NYC. It is literally my go to. The service is always great and the waiters are very knowledgeable about all of the items on the menu. They even make suggestions if you are unsure what to get. I visit this restaurant sometimes 3 times in one month if I can. Do be advised that getting a reservation is pretty difficult especially on a weekend and at a normal ""dinner time"". Fortunately, L'Artusi is open late during the week (11pm) and even later on Friday and Saturday (12am). They offer counter seating for smaller groups as a walk in. Typically the wait time is about 45-1 hour or even more on a weekend night. Luckily the most I've ever waited was 45 minutes. The service is great even if you are sitting at the counter versus a table. I've had great dinners either way. Only downside to the counter is a larger group can't be accommodated on a walk in. The tables for larger groups are always booked far in advanced even. Portions are good sized. When I come here my boyfriend and I share two appetizers and two pastas and occasionally we'll get a meat as well. We leave very stuffed. Best dishes in my opinion: Appetizers: Roasted mushrooms are number one. I could eat this everyday!  Beef carpaccio is amazing too. Occasionally they have the Wagu beef special on toast which is to tie for as well. Pasta: I've had the Orecchiette, spaghetti, tagliatelle, bucatini and occasionally the waiter will bring out a small serving of raviolis compliments of the chef. The BEST pasta is hands down the spaghetti. It's perfectly flavored with some spiciness to it as well. Secondly would be the Tagliatelle bolognese. It's amazing as well. The other pasta I only got once and wouldn't get them again only because my two favorites are so damn good. Meat: I've only had the hanger steak. It is very good, and the potatoes with salsa Bianco it comes with are so flavorful. You can get these as a side if you aren't a steak person. Dessert : all the desserts are good and it's fun to sit out the counter and watch the pastry chef putting together desserts. Cappuccino and espresso are also amazing. Drinks: they offer a nice wine list, cool seasonal beers, and nice mixed drinks. I love this place and will continue to come here as often as I can!",3,,1
75,Claire H.,"New York, NY",312,156,224,5.0,8/16/2017,"Simply divine.The bread and olive oil to start was awesome. I knew it was going to be a great meal from that point on. The wagyu beef tartar special was one of the best bites I've ever had. Savory, citrusy perfectly tartared tender beef atop two rustic, charred, perfectly oiled pieces of bread... incredible. Also, the roasted mushrooms with egg was delicious, albeit small. If you're hungry, be sure to order 2-3 plates per person... not including dessert of course. I don't think you can go wrong with the pastas.. any of them. We had the tagliatele. It was cooked to a perfect al dente. And of course, for dessert, we had the olive oil cake. Can't wait to come back to try more things.",2,,
76,Jessica Z.,"Santa Clara, CA",175,3,7,1.0,7/22/2018,"PART ONE: I hate this place. First of all, I made a reservation to come, and it was raining, so the number of people that are going to the restaurant should be less than usual. However, when I arrived, I was still required to wait longer than I should have! 30 minutes! We had over 10 shopping bags, and they didn't offer to check it until right before we had to sit down to eat. There were only two chairs in total at the waiting area, and so we set our bags on the wet floor. Not ideal, but whatever. They also put the bathrooms right by the door, which is an unsightly area. When we just entered the restaurant at from a downpour outside, my first impression was a lady had asking me if she was in the right place for the bathroom. Like I'm not even an employee! The organization of this place is just not good. Secondly, I think that having just two bathrooms in total is not a good choice on their end because all the people waiting for the bathroom coincides with the people waiting for seats for the restaurant.When we were finally brought to a table, the table was at least pretty big. But, if you like to take pictures of your food, don't expect anything because the lighting is simply one tiny flickering candle. Also their bread is highly inferior, mediocre at best considering the price point of this restaurant. I have been to so many better Italian restaurants than this, and I have absolutely no problem spending money as long as it's value and/or good food. We easily spend upwards of $200-300 on a meal at a decent restaurant.There were under-21 kids at the table, yet it seemed like they were pushing the wine list on us. That's inappropriate and unprofessional. I don't like that they have a tapas style of eating because the server literally told me that we should all be ordering 2-3 dishes in total. At $20-35 a fish, that's ridiculous considering we had kids at the table. Our first server Anthony was impatient with me and wouldn't help me choose a dish that suited my tastes. Then they suddenly changed the server to some other random guy who started spouting out the super details of everything in a dish, and how it was prepared. I finally settled on having the Tagliatelle, and the server comes back to me and tells me that they have run out of that dish. I say okay, ask him if I can order the Branzino instead, without olives because I'm allergic. He says, well it's just a piece of fish then. I ask if he can substitute it with anything like potatoes, and he replied, ""I can only add it as a side for you."" A side that costs $9. And, they were the ones that had ran out of the pasta that I originally wanted. If they had good customer service then they would honor that and help me alter the dish to my dietary needs. So therefore I said to myself, Thanks but NO THANKS!",1,,
77,Phoebe W.,"New York, NY",548,323,803,5.0,8/3/2017,"A lovely Italian restaurant in the West Village! Apparently reservations are hard to come by, though I'm not really sure how that goes down as I've only been once for a friend's birthday dinner.The waitstaff took such good care of our party of 8, filling and refilling our waters, meticulously explaining the menu offerings, and even joking around with us and snapping endless photos (on iPhones and a Polaroid, that's when you know you have a winner). They were fun and friendly while still incredibly professional, which was awesome.As for the food, I ordered the garganelli with the mushroom ragu. It was seasoned perfectly, the noodles were rightly al dente, and the portion was filling but not excessive. The other ladies at the dinner all ordered pasta as well and each was equally impressed. We decided to forgo dessert this time, so I really look forward to making a second trip and trying out the olive oil cake! L'Artusi, you're killing it.",3,,
78,Nicki L.,"Old Lyme, CT",74,52,0,5.0,1/30/2018,"All right. I have had the distinct pleasure of dining here twice in my existence on planet Earth. Both times I have eaten here have been in the esteemed presence of my sister. She's more a foodie than I, and thank goodness for her company whilst navigating the ins of fine dining. Ahoy!In all, we have had the gnocchi, hanger steak, and escolar. There were I believe three other dishes we have had that no longer appear to be on the menu - it's been a bit of time since we've been back. I'm nearly positive we had ceviche on our first visit. I have to say, the hanger steak takes the cake in my book. Oh my goodness, the potatoes! Crispy potatoes with salsa bianco to be exact. Mouth-watering! As in: ""Oh wow; this is what dreams are made of."" It's the kind of dish you do your damnedest to revisit by way of imagination in the middle of the night when you have an insatiable appetite to contend with. You never can satisfy it, though, so you're forced to eat cheese and peanut butter instead. That's not a win. Solution: back to L'Artusi.Aesthetically, L'Artusi is gorgeous. If I enjoyed intimate contact with other human beings I would bring them here for a date. Maybe I'm joking, maybe I'm not. It gets loud but both times I was still able to engage in conversation cross-table with my sister. Thank you, L'Artusi. Thank you.",3,1,
79,Jason L.,"Los Angeles, CA",834,607,1219,4.0,7/13/2017,"With a bunch of Italian spots in NY, we didn't know which restaurant to pick. We were led to L'Artusi through a recommendation and I'm glad we came here!! Their homemade pasta is terrific, the ambiance is very cozy and sleek, and the service is exceptional. We had a late reservation so I would suggest planning ahead if you want to come here. Even though there are 2 floors, this place gets packed! Our server was friendly and constantly checked on us to make sure we were good.For starters, we received a small complimentary appetizer, a basil pesto spread on top of sliced bread which was pretty good! It was a nice surprise to begin our dinner. We ordered the charred octopus and I really enjoyed it. The octopus was huge, tasted fresh and had the perfect consistency. The lemon made for a nice balance to the acidity of the octopus. For our mains, we decided to share three pastas: orecchiette, ravioli and cavatelli. All of their pastas are fantastic standalone. They're all chewy, doughy and soft. I loved them!! My favorite was the orecchiette which came with sausage, salumi and pecorino. The ravioli was superb but I was pretty disappointed with the cavatelli. While the pasta was delicious, I didn't think the toppings in the dish went well with the pasta. Everything felt out of place and didn't really fuse with the cavatelli...no cohesion with the dish.For dessert, you HAVE to leave room for the olive oil cake. It's amazing!! It seems like it's a big hit and now I can see why. It has a delicate touch that just melts on your tongue...so good!I would definitely recommend L'Artusi to anyone looking for Italian in NY...just gotta make a reservation well in advance!",12,7,6

This is what I would like to call a contemporary Italian restaurant. We were a party of 10 and had a small private room upstairs. The room had glass walls and was surrounded on three sides by their wine collection. It was quite a nice space.Because we had so many people, we had a set menu that was brought in courses for everyone to share. The small tastings were great because we were able to try more food than if we ordered our own meal. We started off with a round of drinks and I highly recommend the mystic buck or the Parker spritz. They were amazing.

90,A. T.,"Manhattan, NY",1,25,1,2.0,7/28/2018,"Used to be good years ago but not anymore. My husband and I live in the neighborhood and used to go there semi-regularly. The last two times were disappointing. When we were there a couple of months ago, the sommelier measured the pour which was a new development. Not sure what that was about but unless you're abroad there's no reason for it - total buzz kill. What used to be my favorite ""Butter Lettuce"" salad was watery and tasteless - lettuce was not properly dried. Fast forward a couple of months, I decided to take my mom there last week for dinner because it's close by. I decided to give the Butter Lettuce salad another try, thinking last time was probably just an one off incident. Turns out it's worse second time around. The salad had a terrible taste, like the oil/hazelnut had turned. The lettuce had brown spots all over (photo attached). I used to recommend L'Artusi to friends and visitors, but will no longer advocate for their food quality. There are other good restaurants nearby. Try a new one that's not ""tired"" and played out. As an alternative, I recommend Loring Place or Dell'anima.",,,
91,Paige M.,"Milwaukee, WI",116,93,43,4.0,12/18/2017,"I would have given this place a full 5 stars if the manager did not have to do all of the work for our table.  He was AMAZING, but if I wouldn't have stopped him  & asked for help, I don't know if we would have ever gotten out of there ...He was great and made up for it by recommending an excellent red at a reasonable price ($65-75 range).  He also sent over a complimentary app - the mushrooms with poached egg - which was out of this world.  The mushrooms had crazy flavor.  Our group split the butter lettuce salad and Brussel sprouts for apps and both were delish.  I would highly recommend the butter lettuce salad, as this is very different from anything you would expect. Our table tried the wild boar ragu (GF pasta - out of this WORLD) - mushroom pasta, spaghetti and bucatini.  I do not even know which one was the best ... they were all absolutely amazing.  The prices were reasonable - especially for NYC.  The atmosphere was perfect for many occasions ... just wondering what the experience would have been like without the managers help.  Our server only came to the table twice and was not much help AT all.",2,,3
92,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,6/5/2017,"Brunch is definitely not a good indication of a renown Italian place, yet L'Artusi managed to make it equally attractive. You would not be able to find that boring egg benedict, or French toast.Both my friend and I were egg lovers, so we went with the egg frittata and the scrambled egg. I did appreciate the fact that they were pretty generous in quantity and provided me half plate of fried potatoes, though I did not quite eat them...the scrambled egg with sausage was cooked slightly on the rare side and still maintained the soft texture. Loved it!Would love to, and almost have to come back for their pasta. Yet I would not mind coming back again just for another brunch!",14,9,16

Small complimentary serving of high quality olive oil and bread prior to the meal. We ordered the Gnocci, Spaghetti, and Tagliatelle (3 entrees for 2 really hungry people and we were able to finish all the food but left full). All were very flavorful with a kick of spice. Portion sizes were a bit smaller than other high end Italian establishments but the quality and flavor was definitely a major plus.",1,,

I'm not putting on this place is great!

96,Amber R.,"Manhattan, NY",26,76,145,4.0,6/12/2017,"Summary: Beautiful venue but inconsistent food quality and overly pretentious crowd ...Probably won't be back. Ambiance: beautiful decor with dim romantic lighting on the main floor. Upstairs tends to be a bit loud with brighter lighting. I definitely prefer the main dining room. Crowd: draws a very loud crowd at times Food: I have mixed feelings about this...The first night we ordered the chicken and butter lettuce salad along with a pasta dish. All AMAZING!! The second time we ordered the chicken, carbonara, gem lettuce, a ricotta special and a few desserts. The chicken and desserts fell short unfortunately...Everything else was delicious that night. The third time we came back we ordered the beet salad, gem lettuce salad, tagliatelle and bucatini. They were out of their special (carbonara) which was the only reason I went that night. The plates were standard at best and one spaghetti dish was way too spicy. Seems to be too inconsistent for my liking. Staff: Again inconsistent. First night we sat at the bar...decent service. Second time we sat upstairs and had amazing service by a female waitress, last time we sat downstairs in the main room and had an odd exchange with the waiter where he couldn't tell us what was in the pasta dishes and tried pronouncing an ingredient and gave up saying ""I don't really know how to pronounce it..But it's nothing special."" When he told us the specials he said ""we only have one dish left and it's nothing great ..."" Drinks: we ordered a number of wines by the glass all of which were subpar. You need to order a bottle to get anything of quality here. Price point: fairly expensive for the portions",1,2,
97,Dalia T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",65,7,3,5.0,8/9/2018,"I went here a few nights ago to celebrate 7 months with my boyfriend. We shared the roasted mushrooms, mushroom ragu pasta, octopus pasta (it was a special), the pork chop, and the rhubarb panna cotta. Everything was amazing. The pastas were flavorful and perfectly al dente. The pork chop was super fatty, which concerned us at first, but I swear it was the best thing I've ever eaten. It was super juicy and flavorful with a sweet and tangy sauce with plums. Very reasonable portion for the price. The panna cotta was so yummy with a super tangy rhubarb jam on top. The mushrooms, two pastas, the pork chop, and one dessert was a good amount to share between two people. Absolutely would recommend this place. You must get the pork chop.",,,
98,Elizabeth H.,"ASTORIA, NY",16,119,75,5.0,5/20/2018,"Five stars are not enough for this place.I finally came here last night with a friend and had probably one of the top five best meals I've ever had in this city. And considering that I've lived here for over ten years, I'm sorry, but that's *really* saying something.We ordered one of the specials as an appetizer (the steak tartare) which was incredible and easily sharable. Followed by the insane garganelli with mushroom ragu that I will remember for the rest of my life. The pasta itself was cooked beyond perfection and I have no idea how a person is capable of creating a vegetable ragu such as this one. It's easily the best vegetarian pasta I've ever had. We also had some kale ravioli that was mind-blowing. And I'm not typically inclined to call kale-ANYthing ""mind-blowing,"" so understand me clearly here. These pastas will change you.The cocktails were also fantastic. We did wait awhile for a table, but knowing what kind of food is being served here, I would have happily waited longer. I cannot wait to take more people here. Food is unbelievable. And a quick side note, the service was incredible. Every person who worked there that we spoke with had such a warm presence and personality and made the evening as memorable as the food was. I really can't say enough good things about this place. Go nowhere else for pasta.",3,1,2
99,Curtis G.,"Boston, MA",87,114,115,5.0,12/15/2017,"Fantastic experience. Came back here for the second time in two years and it was just as amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. We arrived early in the evening as a walk in and out our name down. Usually an hour or two wait so be prepared. Luckily there are so many great places in the neighborhood to get drinks or wait for your table to open up. The entire staff is extremely professional, courteous, and friendly and makes you feel welcome. Seating is intimate but not too private. There is an open kitchen concept and bar along one side of the restaurant. Upstairs is a lofty second floor with skylights, more seating and a large wine room that can be reserved for private dining. The menu is a mix of modern and classic Italian dishes and is well thought out. Make sure you sample some crudo, a side or two and some cheeses but leave room for their amazing pastas and dessert. They have some great seafood and meat options too like charred octopus, quail, and branzino. We had their house made ricotta which is light and creamy and served with highly addictive made from scratch crackers. Plus there are great cow, sheeps milk and goat cheeses on the menu to enjoy and a nice selection of Italian and other wines to pair with. I also love the quail here and their gnocchi with rabbit. So savory and earthy. Signature dish is the spaghetti, you really can't go wrong there. Very al dente and a modern take.",1,,

For dessert, we shared the olive oil cake with golden raisin marmellata, vin santo, and creme fraiche mousse. It sounds kind of odd, but it was 1 of the best desserts I've ever had.

We didn't have reservation so the wait was extremely long - 2-1/2 hours. So we walked around West Village. We sat at the bar right in front of the kitchen - what an experience! The head Chef was da bomb and it was like watching one of Chef Ramsey's shows.  The General Manager, Jorie Morales, gave us samples of their specialty ravioli with red kale and the carrot/fennel soup....never tasted anything like it! Our main courses were just as amazing: Tagliatelle and Garganzelli - All I can say it was divine!!! Oh and don't let me forget the crispy potatoes with the salsa bianco-out of this world!!!The 2-1/2 hour wait was definitely worth it!",2,1,1

Perfectly creamy, and balanced by the springy taste of ramps. -The garganelli was delicious, as well. The mushroom ragu with it is interesting and fairly unique. *Bonus amusing anecdote: the table next to us was verrryyy interested in our pastas. An older gentlemen kept craning his neck around to try to discern what we'd ordered. For general reference, the garganelli and spaghetti are two of the most popular (and most recommended) pastas here.DESSERT: -I had the bittersweet chocolate budino, and tried a bite of my friend's  olive oil cake, as well. The budino is richly textured and not overly sweet, just as advertised. The olive oil cake is delicious, although I didn't care much for the raisin marmellata (but that may be because I'm not a huge raisin fan)DRINKS: -I had the Parker Spritz, which was quite good: light, fruity, and perfect for a warm spring or summer day-My friend had a cocktail the waitress recommended for a Manhattan-drinker, and wasn't very impressed with the flavor combination-Both drinks were deceptively strong!",4,1,2
103,Jack C.,"New York, NY",439,2,8,5.0,4/19/2018,"Everything about this place is perfect! I went last night (April 18) for my 25th birthday dinner and was absolutely blown away. My girlfriend and I were seated at the two chef's table seats facing the kitchen (easily the best seats in the house) and proceeded to have one of the best dinners of our entire lives. But it's not just about the food-we'll get to that in a moment. The ambiance was perfect. No need to shout or strain to hear, perfectly romantic lighting and the temperature was great.As for the food, we started with the housemade ricotta with a drizzle of olive oil and fleur de sel (sea salt) on homemade crisps and a few small diced pears. Unbelievable and a great way to get ready for the dishes to come. Next, we had compliments of the chef, two slightly larger than shot size small mugs of cauliflower soup. I'll rattle the next few off or else we'll be here for ages. The hamachi crudo is a MUST, followed by the roasted mushrooms, then the orechiette, which was very meaty and tasty, then the special of the night which was a raviolo (two large ravioli - think carbonara in ravioli form but with an oozy egg in the middle), then the charred octopus (verrry tasty), then the hazelnut torta to finish. Good. God. What a place. Oh and their cocktails are killer, too!Can't recommend it enough. Try to sit downstairs if possible and if super possible try to sit at the chef's table!Thanks to the staff for an amazing evening! Bravo!!",,,

We started the evening with some rosé so you know it was already going to be a great dinner. My group shared the butter lettuce with gorgonzola and the roasted mushrooms with a fried egg. Both were delicious and we were all pleasantly surprised that the mushroom had a nice kick to it. For my entree, I had the tagliatelle Bolognese and you could taste how fresh the pasta was. There was barely any talking because the food was so delicious. Dessert is where we calorie splurged!! We tried the gelato/sorbet , the brown sugar croissant bread pudding and the banana rum semifreddo. I can not praise the desserts enough. It was all constructed perfectly without being overly sweet.

There weren't many spots left for reservations so found it odd that there were so many tables open once we got to the restaurant. Ambiance: pretty interiors with a classy but beach feel - lots of white and blue with fresh flowers. Food: pastry basket is delicious and all baked fresh. Comes with bread and jam. I heard from a couple of friends it'd be the best pasta in New York so I did come in with high expectations - I thought it was good but not great. We got two of the three pasta dishes on the brunch menu, the tagliatelle and the carbonara - the pasta was cooked really nicely if you prefer al dente. The carbonara I found more flavorful with the pancetta. The tagliatelle's sauce didn't really come through and the bolognese tasted a little watery/bland. We also got the ricotta crespelle - scrambled eggs were fluffy, came with some crepes that were filled with some kind of cream, not really flavorful. My friends ordered the Texas grapefruit mimosa which was good/strong. Service: waiter was friendly and attentive. I want to return and try the dinner menu as the brunch menu wasn't standout.",1,,
106,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",465,862,4808,4.0,4/15/2017,"I've had various coworkers and friends recommend me L'Artusi for a while. They've said great things about their olive oil cake. I managed to snag a reservation for 6pm on Sunday. Their bread is pretty standard. It's actually kind of boring. For a restaurant like this, I thought they would have way better bread. We ordered a meat, two seafood, and two desserts for two people. The portion sizes are smaller, so we were full but not overly stuffed at the end.Seared sweetbreads, white bean puree, escarole, chorizo - I liked the white bean puree and the citrusy sauce. The sweetbread themselves were a little chewy. I think I prefer them fried.Charred octopus, potatoes, chilies, olives, pancetta - The octopus was tender and artfully surrounded by the little fingerling potatoes and olives. Arctic char, caper aioli, fingerling potatoes, chilies, scallion - Flaky fish the same color as salmon, but less fatty. I didn't like the aioli because I dislike mayo, but the fish was cooked well.Olive oil cake, golden raisin marmellata, vin santo, creme fraiche mousse - This lived up to expectations. The cake was so light and fluffy. The raisins added some sweetness. The creme fraiche had sea salt on top, so the combination of salty and sweet was perfect. I enjoyed this more than the entrees.Hazelnut chocolate torta, praline crunch, salted caramel gelato - I preferred the olive oil cake. There wasn't too much flavor in this. Surprisingly, I thought the olive oil cake was sweeter. The chocolate ganache was very smooth though.Service was great and very efficient. The food came our extremely fast. I think we waited only 10 min. before our first dish came out. We finished the entire meal including paying the bill in about 50 min. I would love to come back to try their pastas and get more of the olive oil cake.",9,5,8

Italian inspired contemporary fare in a really neat split-level space: downstairs feels like a classy lounge with the bar in view, upstairs is quieter with amore traditional restaurant feel looking into the glass enclosed wine cellar. Appetizers were good to share - pastas are larger than you would expect and can easily be a meal on their own. We were told 2-3 dishes per person - a bit inaccurate since the portions were more generous than we were led to believe (much appreciated). Will definitely be returning.The most important note: probably the best pork chop I have ever had in my life.Other note: there is the ability to have a private room upstairs encased by the glass enclosed wine cellar.",4,,

Based on reviewer's suggestions I ordered the housemade ricotta (with extra crackers), roasted mushrooms, orecchiette, and then the olive oil cake. Everything was fantastic, especially the roasted mushrooms. I liked this restaurant so much I came back with a friend two days later. Again didn't have a reservations and this time had to wait about 45 minutes for seats at the bar (a Thursday night).

It was so good I would get a whole plate of those for sure. If only they had them on the menu... such a tease!We had the wagyu beef tartar on toast and that was the star of the show in my opinion! You MUST get that when you eat here! No ifs, ands, or buts allowed! They have cheese plates. Definitely try one. It was so gooooood! We had the truffle cheese. The scallop ceviche was thinly sliced and zesty - it'll melt in your mouth. My friend and I couldn't resist not getting pasta dishes. My friend got the Tagliatelle pasta and that was DELICIOUS.

It is great for any special occasions or for any other random night as well. Interior and service are all an A+. And honestly, all the dishes are to die for but some of my FAVES are the beef carpaccio, roasted mushrooms, charred octopus, pork chop and hanger steak. As far as the pastas go, they're all divine but my absolute favorite which I will get every single time is the spaghetti. They also have weekly specials that i wouldn't doubt are all phenomenal as well. One special I had was a venison dish and my bf and I devoured it- we almost licked the plate!!!Lastly, take your pick on desserts but don't forget the olive oil cake.

116,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,9/28/2017,"Went here with a friend after reading so many rave reviews about the place. It is nearly impossible to come by a reservation without a lot of planning, so we arrived shortly after the restaurant opened and were able to be seated right away.We were pretty hungry, so we decided to split a few dishes:Bread and olive oil (3.5 stars): The bread and oil was decent, but not life changing in any way--aka, don't let it fill you up!Tagliatelle (5 stars): This was definitely the best dish of the night. The bolognese sauce was so meaty and flavorful and the noodles were so delicious--I don't think they could have been cooked any more perfectly.Cavatelli (4 stars): I enjoyed this pasta, especially for the shape of it and for the fact that it had a nice spice to it.Sweetbreads (3.5 stars): The sweetbreads themselves were great, but the additional ingredients did not really do much for me and actually took away from the flavor.Carrots (3.5 stars): These were decent, but nothing to write home about--generous portion size.Corn (4 stars): This was very fresh and flavorful and provided a nice bite--also a decent portion size.Olive oil cake (4.5 stars): This dish is one of their signatures and it did not disappoint. I don't know if I have ever had a dessert that was more salty/savory that I enjoyed as much as this one. The cake was so moist and the dollop creme fraiche mousse--topped with sea salt--was divine. Add the raisin sauce and you have yourself a winning dish.Overall, this place definitely lives up to the hype. The food was good--priced decently reasonably and came out quickly. The service was friendly and attentive and the ambiance was great, even at 6pm on a Wednesday. Definitely worth checking out, especially for their pastas and olive oil cake.",4,,

Actually it's kinda hard to read the menu and I have good eyes. Service was impeccable. No complaints there. Ridiculous wine and drink menu. Think they have wines from around the globe. If you are a wine-o this is the place for you.Food wise, definitely a yummy meal but expensive. The cheese plates to start off where a great idea and actually pretty well priced. Can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes but I will say my favorite dish was the pork chop.Really big portion and the price was only 28. No way one person could finish it.We got the olive oil cake (like everyone recommends) and I see why. Really tasty.

Good thing we had reservations! We got seated and started with the bread, which (per my Italian Bread Theory (c)) is great, foreshadowing good Italian food to come. Then came the pastas. We get 3 items, because we are hungry people in general, and because their pasta is delightful. We got the garganelli, the gnocchi, and the fish (I forget which kind, which is a serious deficiency in my review, I understand). The pastas are both awesome, and highly recommended. The fish (not salmon, but close!) was also great, and really balanced out the meal. We also ordered the hazelnut chocolate torta for dessert, which they promptly forgot about. But no worries, because they comped it when they realized the problem! And it was delicious, chocolate and hazelnut and ice cream and yes, I'd recommend it. Good place!",3,1,2

It took about a month to get a reservation here, and now I totally understand why.Once we sat down, our waitress brought us over homemade ricotta with chutney and crackers on the house which was delicious, paired with amazing Sauvignon Blanc. We ended up getting two bottles because we were enjoying it so much, and was totally affordable for a good bottle of wine.We shared appetizers: beef carpaccio, the dayboat scallops, roasted beets salad, and hamachi. The carpaccio was sliced super thin and so flavorful. I never had scallops raw... but they were surprisingly delicious.Every pasta was cooked perfectly if you like al dente. I had the tagliatelle bolognese which I loved! After pastas, we all split the chicken, artic char, and the tuna. The chicken was so simple, yet so tasty! I would definitely have been fine with just getting that.Somehow we found room for dessert- I had to try the olive oil cake. It was basically a super moist pound cake with powdered sugar on top. AMAZING. I'm not even a dessert person. We also tried the hazelnut chocolate torta... which basically tasted like a huge snickers bar. So good.Overall... it was such an enjoyable experience- from the ambiance to the food, and the company :) highly recommend if you are looking for a new spin on Italian!",1,,

This place is extremely popular and you've got to book well in advance for a good table. We walked in and sat at the bar, which was a little cramped. The only silver lining was we got to see the chefs cooking in the open concept kitchen. For our appetizers we ordered the beef tartare. The crostinis were HUGE and I honestly felt pretty full after finishing one piece. We shared the bavette and pici pasta dishes. The waiter is no help at all as we asked for recommendations and his answer was ""everything is great"". I would give the pici a 9/10. The sauce, pasta and meat were all on point. We really didn't like the bavette, which was oily. The breadcrumbs on top didn't complement the dish either. I would return if it were easier to get a table but I really don't think this place is worth the hassle or the hype.",,,

130,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,325,577,4.0,2/2/2017,"L'Artusi is a great little Italian place with delicious food and a wonderful ambiance. We came here for an anniversary dinner and left quite happy with the experience. The space is great, they have two levels. The lower level is lively and loud while the upper level is more quiet and intimate. We were seated on the upper level and appreciated that it was cozy without being boring. They also have a glass roof which I'm sure will look great during the daytime. They have a huge wine list which was divided up by regions in Italy where they are produced. We were a bit overwhelmed by the amount of choice and the sommelier seemed to sense that. She came over and helped us select a really great red that was exactly what we wanted. The food here is more traditional than say becco or carmines. We didn't feel like having anything from the raw bar so we got the roasted mushrooms to start, which were yummy. For the main course we got the spaghetti and the tagliatelle. The spaghetti was simple and delicious, but could have used a touch more chile. The tagliatelle was amazing, the bianco bolognese was unique and really worked well with the dish overall. For dessert we got the hazelnut torta that was dense, chocolatey and nutty. Service was friendly but our first server vanished after handing us our menus. We never got to hear the specials either! A passing server took our order and took care of us for the rest of the evening but it was a bit weird that this happened and made the waitstaff seemed a little disorganized. They lose one star because of this. Nice place overall. Would return here for Italian.",2,2,1

135,Nick D.,"Ocean City, NJ",0,42,114,4.0,11/5/2017,"Fancy Italian food--there are 3 $$$ for a reason.  Portion sizes are rather small for the price, but the food is delicious.  Made a 10:30 pm reservation and were seated within a few minutes.  The place was PACKED, so it was very loud in the restaurant (we sat downstairs).  There were no sound conditioning (acoustic sound blockers) so you have to literally yell across the table to speak to your dining partner.  The service was rather below average (the waiter was nice, but not attentive--water wasn't refilled once, didn't come by to ask how the meal was, etc.)  The bread and dipping oil they give you to start is delicious.  The food makes up for it, though.  We got the starter of cheese ($7 each) with bufala mozzarella and housemade ricotta.  There was some reddish chutney (strawberry maybe?) and housemade crackers.  The portions of cheese were very tiny, but they were both delicious, as were the crackers and the chutney.  We also got the mushrooms with cheese and a fried egg.  Again, super tasty, but really small for $17.  Roasted mushrooms should maybe have a maximum of $12 at any restaurant.  And this isn't even a Michelin starred restaurant, so I'm not sure how they charge $17 for such a small portion (could be considered a side dish).  The spaghetti with garlic and breadcrumbs was excellent.  Small portion for $18 but satisfying.  Not too overly garlicy and not a ton of breadcrumbs--it was just right.  The roasted potatoes as a side dish for $9 with ""salsa bianco"" were some of the best potatoes I've ever had.  A++ on the potatoes.  I actually was going to give this a 3-star rating, but the potatoes deserve an extra star; hence, the 4-star rating for this place.  My friend got the garganelli with mushroom ragu.  I thought they were delicious, though it was a little too mushroomy.  If you like a subtle mushroom flavor, stay away from this dish.  Definitely worth going to if you're willing to spend more on quality, and not quantity.",,,

The appetizers and pastas were marvelous.Crudo: Beef Carpaccio (5/5) - Rye crisps, subtle horseradish crema = thumbs all the way upVerdura: Roasted Mushrooms (4/5) - I am not a fan of fungus among us. However, the mushrooms were chopped and had a crispy texture that paired perfectly with pancetta and fried egg.Pasta:Spaghetti (5/5) - Who said that spaghetti needs to be paired with red sauce? The best thing on the menu. Orecchiette (4.5/5) - This ear shaped pasta listens to your inner meat cravings and satisfies them.Tagliatelle (4.5/5) - A classic that sets the bar high for all other Bolognese dishes that come after it.Pesce:Branzino (2.5/5) - Just a simple fish, there are plenty in the sea just like it.Carne:Roasted Pork Chop (4/5) - The sweet potato and lime yogurt harmonized well with the large slab of meat.My friends and I tried to snag a last minute reservation a week prior and failed. We decided to try to sit at the bar but was quoted a 2 hour wait at 615pm on Friday. Luckily, some poor soul canceled their reservation and we were seated immediately.

Updated review","It pains me to have to write this update. As you can see from my previous review, L'Artusi has been one of my favorite restaurants since 2011. I was back again this week, probably for the 40th time, for Sunday brunch. The food was great as usual. I was seated in the back near the open concept kitchen. During my meal, I noticed that a young female cook was being sexually harassed by a male server. He was pressing up against her from behind, holding her, whispering into her ear, groping her. This happened again and again during the 1.5 hours I was there. It was clearly not friendly interaction. Each time it happened, the young female cook looked visibly uncomfortable, she was focused on her task at hand, ignoring him as much as she could, and pulling away whenever she could. I am aware that sexual harassment is rampant in kitchens, but it was still horrific to witness this happen. I requested to speak with the manager after, whom apologized and took my concerns very seriously. However, it is difficult to believe that she or anyone else in this restaurant was not aware of what was going on, if a casual diner could observe all of this from her table at brunch. As much as I have enjoyed the food over the years, I find it difficult to support a restaurant that does not protect the rights of their staff and have fostered an environment where women are not treated with respect and dignity.",7,1,1

The flavors in the dishes that I tasted were struggling to come through over heavy doses of salt, vinegar and sugar. What once seemed to be an adventurous take on Italian cooking has devolved into a battle between American and traditional Italian ingredients with both of them losing. The wine list is still tantalizing as are the delicious looking cocktails. The clientele is lovely to look at and the staff will make you feel welcome.",,,

Both times we had reservations and were seated no more than maybe 5 minutes after we arrived. I should also note that each reservation I had I booked a month in advance. Things fill up quickly!My favorites so far are the orecchiette, crispy potatoes,and brussels sprouts, but really everything I've tried has been delicious!! If you're a big meat eater, you'll love the orecchiette. For drinks, my favorites are the L'Artusi Gimlet and Mom's Out of Town. The Hazlenut Chocolate Torta is my favorite dessert so far.The service is amazing and the waiters are super friendly and extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu, so if you're not sure what to order they will gladly assist in helping you make a decision.The ambiance is also great. We've experienced sitting on both the 1st and 2nd floor and both were very nice-- very warm and inviting.This is definitely one of my new favorite spots in the city.

The garlic flavor becomes too overwhelming after a few bites.The cavatelli was my favorite, it had surprisingly good flavor. The fresh pasta, sausage, and olives complemented each other very well. But if you're not into olives, I would avoid this dish, the olive flavor was quite strong. The same can be said for octopus, it was delicious but heavy on the olives.

146,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,5.0,8/12/2017,"Been trying to go to L'Artusi for a year or so since going to sister restaurant Dell'anima. Wow am I pissed I didn't get to L'artusi earlier. This place is on point. First off the restaurant itself is very cool. Awesome open kitchen setup. We sat upstairs outside of their incredible wine room which actually has a ~10 person private dining table in it. Loved the setup.Our waiter was very nice and incredibly knowledgable. Knew the ins and outs of their seafood procurement and their wine list. Even the guy who bussed our table knew how they made the preserves on the cheese plate. Impressive. We started with a fantastic bottle of wine. As well as two cheeses (came alongside these delicate umami buttermilk crackers which were to die for). One was the ezra from murrays cheese shop which was delicious. Next we got the raw scallop crudo style which was one of the most delicate scallop preparations I've ever had. Melt in your mouth status. As well as the beef tartare which was a special. It came on some awesome dark bread and was full of garlic intensity. Both apps were superb. Next we got the burrata with heirloom tomatoes and nectarines and the chicory salad. The burrata was so smooth and delicate and the tomatoes and nectarines were very fresh. The chicory salad took us by surprise with its anchovy BOOM. I mean anchovy as hell. If you don't love anchovies don't get this. Luckily I love me some anchovies. Yum. Lastly we each got a main. The chicken, the bolognese tagliatelle, the rabbit gnocchi, and the lamb ragu pasta. Everything was amazing. The chicken was salty and crispy with vegetables. The bolognese tagliatelle was meaty and unctuous. The ragu was homey and dense and delicious with tender chunks of lamb. The gnocchi was like clouds of perfectly delicate potato.Overall the service was great. The atmosphere was great. The food was top notch. Every dish was crafted with the utmost care. The staff was very well educated on the fare and the libations. You can tell when care is put into the meticulous creation of a concept and it translated into the perfect experience. We will most definitely be coming back here, many times to come.",,,
147,Maggie F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",205,506,132,4.0,6/25/2017,"L'Artusi made for a great NYC Italian experience. I'd recommend going when you have the night to spend here. We had to be out by a certain time and we felt rushed. It's definitely a place where you hang out, relax and order food as you want it.I will say the concept was confusing to us. The menu is presented like a regular menu, then our server told us they recommend parties order several entrees and share family style, and that they recommend ordering two to three entrees per person. Ordering two to three dishes per person and family style sounded like an oxymoron to us, so we were just a bit confused. There were six of us and we ended up ordering six pasta dishes and a couple appetizers and felt like that was a good amount to be full, but not too full. Two to three dishes per person would have been excessive in my opinion.Having said that, the food was really god and I liked it because we were on vacation and all of these pasta dishes were unlike anything we could get at home. All very unique and flavorful. We started out with the roasted beet salad and roasted mushrooms. I usually do not eat mushrooms because I don't care for the texture, but these were crispy, delicious and had a fried egg on top... I loved them! Pasta-wise, we ordered the tagliatelle with the white bolognese sauce, the gnocchi with rabbit, the orecchiette with sausage, the garganelli with mushroom ragu, and that night's special, a spaghetti cacio e pepe... I know we ordered another but I forget what it was. Cacio e pepe was my absolute favorite meal when I went to Italy, and L'Artusi's was just as it should be - super simple, cheesy and delicious. I also really liked the orecchiette and the gnocchi, but everything was pretty tasty.We had a good time at L'Artusi and I wish we'd had more time to spend there. I wish they'd explain the concept and their suggestions a little more clearly, but all in all we had a great time and I'd recommend it for a fun night out and some good Italian food.",1,1,1
148,Jen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",256,690,29,4.0,2/10/2018,"This restaurant was extremely popular and I can understand why. The mixed mushrooms with egg was fabulous and I loved my homemade pasta. I would skip the Brussels sprouts as they had a very off putting taste, but especially because of how oil soaked they were.

149,Darren B.,"Austin, TX",356,947,2625,4.0,11/23/2016,"I love when you have a good feeling about a place beforehand and it turns out to be just as good as you thought it might be if not more. Simply put, L'Artusi is awesome. They have great service, great atmosphere, great food, and great care for what they do.I did not get to sample too much of their menu this trip, but I plan to remedy that in the future. The cheese plate we started with was excellent and maybe the highlight of the meal. For pasta, I got the Cavatelli with Hot Italian Sausage while my buddy got the Linguine Nero with Gulf Shrimp. Both pastas were really good. The cavatelli in mine were cooked perfectly. The only thing about this dish that I was a little let down by was the fact that I could have made the same dish myself. It basically tasted like Sausage and Peppers. Now, Sausage and Peppers is one of my go to Italian dish staples that I make at home, but I guess when I read this dish on the menu it didn't sound like that was what was going to come out. I did enjoy it, but I would get something else next time.Both the cocktail I had (King's Lair - Compass Box Great King St Scotch, Laird's Apple Brandy, Nardini Amaro, Bonal, Nux Alpina) and glass of red wine (can't remember which one it was) I had were real good. I will say though while their wine by the bottle list is vast, they do not have a large selection of wines by the glass.Really a fantastic spot I'd highly recommend and look forward to returning to.",8,4,6

We ordered the scallops appetizer, spaghetti, and roast chicken. Food was quite good--I thought the scallops (raw, with a lemony dressing) were the standout dish. We sat upstairs, which was on the noisy side, and tables were pretty close together. Fairly dim lighting. Service was very prompt and not overly solicitous.

151,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,5/8/2017,"Hard to hype up a place more than L'Artusi. I really should've snagged a reservation here before its popularity skyrocketed into another dimension. I've known about the spot for a few years but put it on the back burner because I figured no one really knew about it. Boy, was I wrong. But it turns out that I'm a very lucky girl, because the bf booked a table here for our anniversary this past Friday. I've managed to get him into the NYC food scene, and L'Artusi has been on our joint list since his best bro bud mentioned it (bros always need bros to confirm, I guess). So when I thought I'd be calling it a night early on Friday, I was mistaken--we ended up at L'Artusi for a fabulous dinner. I love surprises and I love food, so it's safe to say that my man knows me well. Our experience here was easily five stars, but it could've been ever better. We'll be back for more. Now, onto the goodies.Came here at 9:15 on Friday. Our time here actually didn't start out too well--we had to wait about 20-35 minutes for our table and were famished by the time we sat down. I get that L'Artusi is the place to be at these days, but they need to do a better job of managing patron flow in that way. Thankfully, service post-sitting down was great. Our waitress was knowledgable and everything that she recommended, after our input, was spot-on. When it comes to alcohol, L'Artusi is first and foremost a wine palace (there's a private wine room here!). Their wine selection is as extensive as it gets, all of it being from Italy. The menu layout itself is as good an advertisement as any--pages up pages of wine, organized by region with corresponding photos. Man, I can't wait to go to Italy. Next anniversary? In any case, the wine here is as good as you'd expect. Our waitress let me sample a few options to help discern what I was in the mood for (as any good wine spot does). Again, she nailed it. I also tried one of the cocktails, the Stowaway (el dorado 5yr rum, pineapple, lemon, agave, cayenne). Seriously good. I'm not sure why you'd come to a place like this if you don't like wine, but if that profile happens to fit for you, I can happily report that the cocktail program is as good as the rest of what's offered here. I'm always on the lookout for spicy cocktails made with something other than tequila, and this fit the bill. My bf tried the Southern Belle for his first cocktail (screw gender roles), which I enjoyed but not as much as my pick. For me, the food here is the main attraction. I was before I dined here, and I'll maintain that now. This place does everything well. Meats, cheeses, veggies, pastas. One of the best Italian meals I've had in the city. I was stuffed at the end of our meal (all food below was split between 2) and I have absolutely zero guilt about it. Eats, below:Cheese and crackers: A+Oh my word. This honestly might have been the best thing we ate all night. I'm pissed that I can't remember what two cheeses we ordered, though not surprised because our waitress picked them for us. We asked for one hard, one soft. They were both magical. I was partial to the hard one, the bf partial to the soft one. Both amazing.Roasted mushrooms w/pancetta, fried egg, chilies, ricotta salata: A+These did not disappoint, and my expectations were high after reading the glowing Yelp reviews. Sticking a fried egg on top of most things is a good idea. Putting it on an assortment of perfectly seasoned roasted mushrooms is a slam dunk, as far as my taste buds are concerned. Two of my very favorite things. Add some salt and some savory with the pancetta and you've got yourself a perfect verdura plate.Gnocchi w/ rabbit, tomato, basil, parmesan: A-Shockingly, the least exciting dish of the night. At first I thought it was because gnocchi is my least favorite kind of pasta, but the bf was disappointed too. Not bad, but compared to the rest of our meal, lackluster. Solid dish, seasoned well, but I'd opt for another pasta next time.Quail alla w/ piastra pear, walnut, radicchio, taleggio: ACan't pass up a good-looking quail dish. Definitely one of the meats I've warmed up to in adulthood. Great flavors, rich but not too heavy. Venison/farro/grapes: A+This was the special entree for the night and thank god we jumped at the opportunity to try it. Before Friday, I was under the impression that the bf didn't eat deer, so I'm grateful that I was wrong. Perfectly cooked meat and impossibly tasty farro. More of a winter dish for sure, but I didn't mind. L'Artusi is a great option for a special occasion--particularly a romanic one. Dim lighting, intimate vibe and couples buzzing around everywhere. Have your Lady and the Tramp moment with your loved one--just know you'll need Lady's pocket to afford the meal.",7,2,5

I quite enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and I'd definitely come here again next time I'm in NYC.  Service was excellent and ambiance was a bit intimate.  Surrounding is very busy with a good amount of customers waiting on the side wall for a table.

155,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",357,144,37,5.0,5/7/2017,"L'Artusi is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The chefs here really know how to take a simple dish and transform it into something extraordinary.For instance, the spaghetti. The chefs don't hide the spaghetti underneath a tomato-based sauce; rather, three basic ingredients - garlic, chilies, and parmesan - are all it takes to turn a regular plate of pasta into an unbelievable dish. The garlic is sliced, and as a result, plays a larger role in shaping the flavor. There's a crunchiness provided by the parmesan, its texture a savory match for the smooth, buttery pasta. One bite, and you'll understand why it's impossible to share.The cauliflower contorno is full of flavor as well. The restaurant accommodated our request to leave out the bagna cauda (to make it vegetarian), but I don't think it diminished the taste at all. I've eaten several variations of this dish, and it usually contains pine nuts and currants, but L'Artusi's version replaces the currants with capers. The absence of the currants' subtle sweetness means that the cauliflower derives much of its taste from the capers. Despite this difference, the lightly glazed and well-roasted cauliflower still makes for a delicious side. The carrots with orange, cumin yogurt, and pistachio is an interesting combination, but it works! Pistachios are rich in general, so they're particularly advantageous for breaking up the consistency of the yogurt. And because the carrots are very tender, the nuts are able to supply a crunch in their place.The restaurant occupies two floors, but there are never enough seats to meet the demand. If you manage to find an open reservation, don't hesitate. L'Artusi will exceed all of your expectations!",4,1,4

159,Sam S.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,29,1,5.0,2/13/2018,"Just thought I would add another 5-star review, to this already impeccable reputation. 1. Start off by saying the waiter whose name I forgot sorry :/ (he is from Canada and was about to visit Nola the next day, you know who you are), was amazing in the recommendations he provided and overall service. Even scored some digestif post meal courtesy of the restaurant for our NOLA food recommendations, so that was a nice gesture. 2. The Som knows his Italian wines to the bone, requested a medium bodied, fruit forward but complex wine resembling more of a pino....and bam I discovered my new favorite wine from Sicilia (Nero/Frappato blend SP68). Amazing recommendations, the rose petals on the nose were a delight. Well as for the food, nothing new I can say here. Reminds me of grandmas cooking with fine ingredients and lots of love. If you can grab the reservation do it!",,,

I tried to make a reso a month in advance and couldn't get in, so my husband and I decided to just walk in and take our chances. Got a seat at the bar / food bar area witting 45 mins (around 7pm on a Friday). Ordered the following and highly highly recommend: ricotta and mushroom app, gnocchi and tagliatelle. Two bottles of wine (region of choice) and the olive oil cake and the salted caramel dish for dessert. Honestly could've just gone for wine and dessert but the tagliatelle was by far the show stopper. A must visit when in the west village!!!",1,,

162,Ani T.,"New York, NY",123,41,6,4.0,2/8/2018,"West Village charmer.Everything here was delicious from start to finish. This restaurant forms part of the trifecta of dinner splurges (the other two being ABC Kitchen and Gramercy Tavern). You will be doing this wrong if you do not order the Olive Oil cake. So good. Also had nearly every other dessert on the menu here, and you cannot go wrong with your choice of desserts here.The only downside is the noise level and the fact that the tables are crammed together in the seating area upstairs. Doesn't necessarily make for an intimate setting with the noise and music drowning out the conversation. Service was prompt, not in-your-face solicitous. I was particularly impressed with the masterful and graceful way our waiter handled the utensils and served our dishes. The hanger steak was exquisite. As was the gnocchi dish.",,,

166,Heidi W.,"New York, NY",229,108,12,5.0,6/28/2017,"L'Artusi is L'Artusi is L'artusi. This is easily one of the reviews that pains me to write because I'm afraid that other people will also recognize awesome Gabe Thompson's restaurant is. As a local growing up in the Italian immigrant neighborhood of Brooklyn, I can't find another golden standard Italian restaurant in the city. Marea/Ai Fiori is a close second but perhaps a little too upscale for more frequent dining. Simply put - the food is amazingly delicious and refreshing in interesting contrasts. We got the orecchiette with sausage, salumi, and pecorino. The orecchiette was in perfect form; the pasta was soft and chewy and had great texture with sausages. I wish we ordered more as I was falling in love with this dish. Service was attentive and not overbearing. Staff didn't bother us while we were enjoying our food and chatting away. The overall atmosphere at L'Artusi is oddly balanced. Upscale but not ostentatious. Young but not too millennial. Dark lighting but not too dark. Everything is concretely well-done.Unpretentious, intimate restaurant for your lovely occasions. Total swoon.",,,

168,Derek Y.,"New York, NY",102,309,643,5.0,9/17/2016,"I've got to say, I had a great experience and the place lived up to the hype. My girlfriend and I came here tonight to celebrate our half anniversary and we had a great dining experience. The restaurant's sleek and sexy interior is hidden by a plain exterior, but the place really opens up once you step into the cozy and warm space. Make sure you get reservations, too. The restaurant was pretty full on a saturday evening at 6:15.The waiter recommended we each order 2-3 items and share them family style, so we got the orecchiette, linguine nero (squid ink pasta), branzino filet and olive oil cake.The orecchiette ($20) took a bit to get used to because it's initially very salty. The sausage and salami hit you hard, but the pasta helps to balance the dish. Still a bit saltier than I'd like it to be, but the dish was well composed, rich and hearty. Note that there was a bitter vegetable in the pasta, and every few bites I would get what tasted like burnt garlic. That was rather unpleasant.The linguine nero ($24) was much lighter in flavor. It comes with shrimp and breadcrumbs and its flavor is almost too nuanced. We warmed up to it pretty quickly, though, and my girlfriend said she liked it more than the orecchiette.The branzino filet ($22) was delicious. Cooked with honey and lemon, it tasted perfect and had a perfectly crispy skin. The price was a bit high for the portion size, but aside from that it was beautiful.Lastly, we finished off with the highly touted olive oil cake ($10). We were a bit hesitant because it doesn't sound good, but trust me -- it was delicious. Splendid. Fabulous. Sweet but not too sweet by any means, the cake was moist and the bursts of salt provided even deeper flavor profiles. I can't sing enough praises for this cake.The service was the cherry on top. Attentive but not overbearing, the knowledgeable staff guided us through a fantastic evening. Prices were to be expected, and while portion sizes seemed small, we left feeling full (but not the ""I'm going to die"" full). I will certainly come back here when another occasion permits.",3,,1

This is the one place where I really enjoyed every single item that we ordered. FOOD-Escolar - the flavor was so good and the fish was incredible; sliced thin and served raw-Dayboat Scallops - the scallops tasted so fresh and sweet; sliced thin and served raw-Tagliatelle - I honestly wasn't excited for this dish since it seemed so basic, but it was unbelievable. The texture of the pasta was nothing like I've had before and the amount of sauce was perfect and not too overwhelming or meaty-Crispy Sweetbreads - Again, the texture was fantastic. The outside was fried but it was smooth and soft when once you bite into it. The greens were a good way to balance out the richness Highly recommend it - it's supposed to be hard to get reservations, but I found that if you call, there are slots that don't show up on OpenTable.",1,,

The food was phenomenal, the atmosphere was great, place was packed, and the wait staff was extremely friendly. To start we shared two cheeses to pair with our drinks. Next, we shared two pastas (the spaghetti and bolognese). The spaghetti was our all time favorite. For our main we shared the steak. And topped things off with the olive oil cake. They must have overheard mention of a birthday, because they also brought out the most delicious ice cream with a candle in it. Very nice touch. I'll definitely be back.

One of the best dining experiences I've had in the city. The staff is professional, courteous, and was extremely patient. They did a great job of answering all our questions about the menu. Very laid back atmosphere, and a little on the intimate side. Although, the tables are very close to one another, so while a great space, you sometimes can hear other parties' conversations. We ordered the roasted mushrooms, homemade ricotta, delicate squash, Orechiette, crispy sweetbreads, cauliflower and scallops. All were delicious but the standouts in my opinion were the homemade ricotta and orechiette. The ricotta, paired with the jam (?) and homemade crackers were incredible. The orechiette was so flavorful and not overly greasy, which was great. We each ordered a cocktail, and were sadly uninspired. Will skip the drinks next time. We were so full, and sadly did not have enough room for dessert, but that is on the to-do list for sure! Great food, wonderful service, will definitely be back very soon!",,,

It was such a refreshing surprise to find that, unlike the the two other spots I'd chosen for special occasions since I'd moved from the West Coast (Balthazar and Raoul's, both in SoHo), this restaurant doesn't traffic in performative snobbery.Like the friendly, excellent service, the food centers on fresh ingredients prepared simply and well. We had the house-made ricotta appetizer served with rosemary crackers and fruit compote, then split the spaghetti (ostensibly ""plain,"" but one of the best pasta dishes I've ever eaten) and the grilled octopus (again: olive oil, capers, the charred taste of the meat itself. Divine!). The olive oil cake made the perfect dessert, served with golden raisins and a tart mascarpone ice cream.Though getting a reservation can prove Herculean, this is a restaurant I'll return to time and time again.",,,
175,Yiwen C.,"Berkeley, CA",6,7,0,2.0,11/26/2017,"The reason why L'Artusi gets only 2 stars from me is that it failed hard to meet expectations by delivering inconsistent food and a dreary atmosphere. I came here with my boo on a Sunday evening. The ambiance was stuffy and morose. While the tables were close, there was no intimacy, as if laughter and banter were sucked straight up through the ceiling. When we first got seated, the restaurant was playing The Smiths and Depeche Mode. This music would have set a great vibe for a downtown club, but was totally incongruous with what the rest of the restaurant was going for, which I presume is modern comfort.Food-wise, this place does sweet stuff extremely well. We got the ricotta appetizer to start and the olive oil cake to finish. Both of these were phenomenal. Nevertheless, they sandwiched a meal that also included a too-salty, room-temperature orecchiette and a too-salty, under-cooked Arctic Char with an overly pungent sauce. Had we been asked how our food was, we might have let our feelings be known at the table. However, our waiter didn't check in at all during the meal and barely even looked at us when we ordered.By the meal's end, I couldn't wait to leave the restaurant.

178,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,1273,1201,5.0,3/19/2017,"This is hands down one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary after earning a $100 gift certificate from OpenTable points. I love when restaurants to do this, so L'Artusi already got a plus in my book. When we sat down, we were each offered a glass of prosecco to celebrate our anniversary on the house! Such a lovely touch! Seriously, so thoughtful. The prosecco, we saw, was the cheapest drink on the menu. However, this was one of the best proseccos I have ever had! It was crisp and light and lovely. Really delicious. It spoke to the quality of wines that they carry on their menu. My husband chose a very interesting vodka cocktail. It was smoked and refreshing and I would have never guessed it was a vodka cocktail. I would have thought whiskey! I was indecisive regarding which wine I wanted so I chose an entire and the server gave me suggestions. He was incredibly helpful and clearly very knowledgeable of the wines. He helped me pick something that paired perfectly with my entire; and actually our cheese selection as well.We chose 2 cheeses from the cheese list to start with: a cheddar and a sheep/cow/goat milk cheese mix. The cheese came with crackers, toasted coconut, and a jam. We mixed it up a bit and tried each cheese with each topping and it all worked so well together. The coconut and jam complimented the cheeses perfectly. I went with the mushroom ragu pasta and my husband with the pasta bolognese. My dish was superb. The pasta was homemade and perfectly al dente. The mushroom ragu was full of earthy flavors and I couldn't get enough of it. My husband throughly enjoyed his meal as well. One thing I loved about the menu, is that there were tons of vegetarian options. You don't always find that at higher end restaurants. Most high end restaurants seem to look down on the vegetarian option and it tends to be very uninspired. In my opinion, they are actually afraid to push themselves to make vegetarian options......but that's neither here nor there. So, go L'Artusi! We got the brown sugar croissant bread pudding and the hazelnut chocolate torte for dessert. They were incredible. Such great flavor and not too sweet. The gelato that came with each was to die for. Truly amazing finish to an incredible meal.The service here was impeccable. Our every need was met. We were constantly attended to with advice, answering questions, refilling our waters, and just generally making sure we were happy. The prices are very reasonable here. The quality of the meal was one the best I have ever experienced, as I said before. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. We are definitely come back.",7,3,2

Someone next to us mentioned ""why order the cheese, this isn't a cheese place"" and I thought these are some of the best cheeses I've had - even better than ""cheese places."" Next we had the seared venison carpaccio which was a special for the night. I normally don't eat raw foods but this was so good I kept eating it! Next we had the boar ragu with tagliatelle noodles and the branzino with a side of brussels - so good! Brussel sprouts are pretty good everywhere but even better here!! For dessert I wanted 3 but settled for just the peanut butter banana sundae since we were so stuffed. I personally LOVE banana flavored things so I was blown away by how well this was done.

We put our name down for a seat at the bar and they estimated the wait would be about 45 minutes. We asked for a recommendation where to get a drink around there while we were waiting and he recommended Employees Only, which was just around the corner and a great cocktail bar. After a few drinks there, we went back to L'Artusi to be seated.Our waiter/bartender, Anthony, was great. He went through the menu with us and made recommendations for wine as well as food. We ordered a few bottles of wine (their menu is really extensive) that he had recommended and they were exactly what we were looking for. We had a couple of restrictions... my friend doesn't like cucumbers (who knew?) and I don't eat meat (but I do eat seafood) so Anthony worked with us there.THE FOODRicotta: amazing. Served with these crackers that taste like pie crust and this sweet, tomato (?) jam. I'm not sure if it was tomato, so don't hold me to this. Apparently this is a seasonal jam, but whatever it was the ricotta was fluffy and delicious. I can see why this is a favorite!Scallop crudo: I had scallop crudo at another restaurant the other day and this iteration blew my mind. The scallops were sliced instead of diced and really delicious.Roasted mushrooms: another popular dish and I can see why! The mushrooms are almost meaty and topped with a fried egg and more ricotta - delicious, if a bit messy.Garganelli: pasta perfectly cooked and in mushroom ""ragu"" - so delicious and hearty. Bavette: their take on a linguine-clam dish. There is a kick to this one (via jalepenos) so watch out if you're not into heat. The pasta is delicious, with that perfect little crunch you get with al dente pasta. Charred octopus: potatoes and grilled octopus, what's not to like? So good, I could eat this every day.Olive oil cake: the recommended dessert by my friend's co-workers and not to be missed! Sweet without being overpowering and perfectly tender.Yes. We were really full.Thank you for a great meal and amazing night - can't wait to come back again!

The escolar was sliced thin in a lemon sauce topped with avocado and chilies. This was followed by the roasted mushrooms. The mushrooms were so bomb. It had pancetta, fried egg, and ricotta salata. Need I say more?Entrees were Rabbit gnocchi and corn tortellini. Absolutely, positively bona fide delicious! The corn tortellini definitely stole the show. Ricotta, aleppo, chives, and Parmesan.

Sizeable Italian wine list. A few local beers on tap. Service is super friendly and efficient.The food is equally striking and approachable. The fluke ceviche was fresh and bright with a hint of spice. The two pasta dishes - woodsy with mushrooms - one with a peppery kick and the other a more rich, simmered flavor and a perfect al dente bite were light(ish) and fulfilling.  The roast quail was my least favorite (still 4.5) but a bit heavy on the gruyère (?) although the marinade, pear, roasted walnuts and arugula really helped balance out the dish.",,,

Do you really think we're gonna wait 45mins especially when we HAD a reservation? Pretty young Latin girl w straight black hair and black and white blouse and younger skinny short African American girl at the front. We communicated that we needed to be seated on time bc there were 3 elderly folks with us. 25 mins later we communicated that we were ready to leave if there's no table ready. The same, ""the guests are finishing up"" bullshit was retorted three times to us. But the worst part is that both ladies did NOT GIVE A CRAP one bit. Aloof and arrogant are descriptive understatements!!! The Latin girl basically said, ""Ok, see ya!"".  When I asked the African American girl to get the manager- her reply, without looking me in the eye and NOT EVEN stopping was a nasty scoff of ""I already told her"". She actually walked pass me, scoffed ""I already told her"" without even pausing for 1 SECOND to acknowledge me. REALLY?!!!!!!!! Are you kidding??Gabe, is this the kind of Chipotle-like hospitality that L'Artusi has stooped too? Is there no accountability for disgusting attitudes in your restaurants anymore? Albeit we had a great time at Anfora two nights b4. I ask this bc of the repeated complaints about service which is evident on Yelp and the like. The Asian Beverage Director was the only saving grace about this miserable experience. Unfortunately she WAS NOT told about our extended wait time until I went and got her at 42 mins of WAITING WITH A RESERVATION. She was not only profusely apologetic but went outside in the cold to try and talk the others into staying. By this point everyone was just pissed off. As restauranteurs ourselves, why would you overbook your restaurant to the point where YOU KNOW you're gonna have these long wait times and ANGRY guests? Yes, i did peak at your Open Table monitor/stats and yes, you were extremely overbooked. Don't be TOO GREEDY guys!!! And why would you leave this huge responsibility to such novices? The two girls obviously do not have the experience nor the wherewithal nor the temperance to run a door nor to read a crowd and see who can wait a couple of minutes or guess at who will leave nasty Yelp reviews. L'Artusi, you've been around long enough to know that your bread and butter neighborhood residents will not tolerate this kind of bullshit!! ps: bartenders were great but why is it that BOH folks are allowed to make sexually explicit comments to other staff. It was a male saying and writhing gross gestures to another male. Just bc he's not a woman doesn't mean it's ok. Have y'all heard of #metoo??",1,,
189,Lillian C.,"New York, NY",770,73,170,4.0,3/2/2017,"Used to be my favorite pasta place until it was dethroned by Marea, but L'Artusi still fills a special place in my heart (or stomach?).It's trendy with an open kitchen, filled with West Village hipsters and works well for dates (soft lighting) or groups (sizable sides for sharing).Between the 2 of us, we got:Complimentary bread: really liked the olive oil they use. No balsamic vinegar but ask for pepper!Scallops: not your typical scallops, they are sliced and marinated in lemon juice. Unique and pretty goodBroccoli Rabe: not the best I've had but they top it with spicy pork bitsCauliflower: comes with a lot of olives but still tender veggies, a bit spicy too I believe Orecchiette with Sausage: very al dente and chewy pasta! Comes with a good amount of meat too, really goodChestnut Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu: I love wild boar ragu but this dish tasted kind of simple like meat with tomato sauce. Still tasty though with soft pastaThis was a good amount of food for 2 and we didn't finish everything. Wasn't blown away the second time I came here but the pastas are still delicious and I felt like the meal was pretty healthy. I don't think the pastas pair too well with wine though because you would just lose the intense flavoring of the dish.I would get cocktails because I remember those were delicious",1,,2
190,Sonia S.,"Manhattan, NY",173,82,170,4.0,10/13/2017,"Chose this place for my mother's 70th birthday and it did not disappoint. Made reservations at midnight on the dot 1 month ahead of time and was only able to get a 6:00 PM spot-but worked out great. Nice, classy ambiance and some unique ingredients. I had the escolar for crudo, buckwheat cavatelli (because when you get the opportunity to eat wild boar, you eat wild boar), and the Hazelnut for dessert. Husband had the Pici lamb neck ragu and he loved it. Not sure what the escolar fish actually tasted like because it was overpowered by the lemon olive oil it it was floating in-I LOVE lemon and the flavor so I didn't mind. Olive oil dessert cake with crème fraîche was great-The hazelnut ice cream with caramel bits was delicious-the cake that came with it was hard and flavorless. Service was good. The portions are ""small"" by American standards but perfectly filling by normal people standards. I'd come here again.",,,
191,Dina M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,97,20,5.0,9/10/2017,"This place was delicious. I don't often go out for Italian but heard this was the spot for a special occasion. We got- crudo scallops- beef carpaccio - chicory anchovies salad- bucatini- duck specialFor 2 ppl with 2 glasses of wine check came under $200, which is pretty good for the area and the quality and how full we were.The crudos were amazing- scallops were meltIn your mouth soft and beef carpaccio perfect.Would have liked to try more homemade pasta but bucatini was spicy and delicious. Duck special was also one of the better ducks I've tried.We put our name down on a Saturday at 6:30 and got counter seats 40 minutes later. Entire dining room was booked so def make a reservation.Will be back!",1,,
192,Allysa A.,"New York, NY",103,11,14,5.0,4/8/2017,"Oh L'Artusi, where do I begin? We have been here multiple times (mostly for brunch) and everything is always consistently amazing. Service, food, ambience. Part of what I love most is how cozy and charming the space is- you feel like you are in someone's gorgeous home & kitchen instead of a restaurant. Prices are standard for NYC brunch and absolutely on par with quality. Side note & nod to the awesome service, we went last year for my birthday and they brought out a complementary dessert. You can sit and have a leisurely brunch & cocktails without feeling rushed or overlooked. Like any busy restaurant, I would suggest making a reservation just incase as it does fill up. Hmm I may need to go back sooner than I thought...For brunch try:Basket of pastriesKale SaladBreakfast BruschettaLemon Ricotta Pancakes L'Artusi BreakfastMimosas",,1,
193,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",92,155,93,5.0,4/12/2017,"NOTE: When you go, ask if the venison tartare special is offered on that day. You won't regret it!! :) Wow, this place is amazing. Was there once with a friend and would return in a heartbeat! Atmosphere was lively, fun, and a mostly young (and attractive) crowd haha. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Venison tartare was A+ and Im someone who enjoys meat *well* done. Went with the highly recommended spaghetti, and made the right choice.",,,
194,Yvonne M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,1,0,1.0,7/22/2018,"PART TWO: Later on, a woman with box braids in a ponytail which seemed to be a manager approached my table and condescendingly spoke to me offering me a side of potatoes because she said, and I quote, ""You can eat this while the rest of your table eats their food."" I'm not poor. I can order my own food at a actual restaurant after I leave the god-forsaken establishment called L'Artusi. She even lingered at the table beseeching my utter gratitude and asking me to thank her which, of course in the moment I mumbled a thank you, so she would leave my table.We started off with a salad like thing with beets and cucumbers which I didn't order, so I couldn't tell u which one it was, but unless you have a blander palate than most that's skewed towards vegetables only, then this would not be enjoyable. We also explicitly told our server that we didn't eat spicy foods from a personal preference, and surprise, surprise, our side of squash we ordered ended up being too spicy to even swallow, much less digest. There goes $10 of hard earned money down the drain. In my personal opinion, so was the corn, but there was no general consensus from the table on that so I will stay neutral on that. EVEN WORSE, the highly touted No. 1 recommendation by our server for the pastas was the Picci, a lamb Ragu, and it was too overwhelmingly heavy and thick, so that the flavor lingers in a burdensome way. The swordfish was okay, but by nature of the fish, it was a little tougher, with a texture closer to chicken than other fishes. Not my personal favorite, but feel free to try if you are a more adventurous eater and enjoy trying different types of fish.They definitely ruined the mood for our family because this was the last night my mom was in New York visiting, and we had the worst meal our our two week trip. My mom even ended the dinner with a really upset stomach, which is unacceptable by any standards. We purposely avoided any raw foods to prevent this kind of occurrence because she's flying tomorrow, and airplanes are the worst place to be for anyone feeling worse than their prime. Additionally, it is incredibly loud in here, and they have sensual and lewd music playing in the background. So it is not suitable for families.Unfortunately, Yelp doesn't let me leave a 0 star review or else I DEFINITELY would.So in conclusion, my family basically was cajoled into ordering 3 dishes each ending in a bill that's over $150 for 2 people. So thank you very much, but I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT BECAUSE THEY WILL SCAM YOU.",1,,
195,Shannon W.,"Manhattan, NY",60,360,73,4.0,9/3/2017,"Finally had the chance to try this place and I'm happy to report it lived up to the hype. The ambiance here is hella on point. Very romantical/west villagey. The candles lining the stairway kinda gave me the heebie-geebies, but I digress, cause who am I to be the fire warden of this spot? Order everything on the menu if you can, including dessert. Had a slight incident involving a piece of plastic in a salad, but the cost was removed from our bill and our salad replaced by one of the plastic-less variety after throwing the waiter some sass. I'd highly recommend / def a good place to take ppl from out of town or rich ppl or whatever",1,,
196,Mac C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,29,0,5.0,9/25/2017,"So glad we came!!! My friend and I shared two amazing pastas (forgot the names but the tag flat ribbon pasta with meat & the twist mushroom with cheese--Soooo good) Staff was friendly, service was excellent, & food was wonderful. Also got the Southern Belle cocktail but they made it with rye whiskey upon request. I'm not typically one to order alcohol. Even so, it was sincerely the best cocktail I've ever had. It was like a new version of a Manhattan. I recommend keeping expectations in check. This way they should surely then be exceeded (tis the way of life) so happy experience overall!",,,1
197,Nika S.,"New York, NY",1,25,0,3.0,8/24/2018,"Seriously people?! this place doesn't deserve 5 stars. I have a feeling people who gave 5 stars don't go out much. Go to Loring place or Babbo then we'll talk. All the dishes people rave about are just average. The service was average. We had the beef carpaccio and the mushroom egg appetizer. Beef carpaccio tasted a little unfresh which is scary. Mushroom appetizer was tasty but nothing to rave about. Pastas were ok, supper in the east village makes better homemade pastas for 1/2 the price. Somehow this place got too hyped up. Go spend your money elsewhere.",,,
198,Chris R.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,23,1,5.0,2/14/2018,"Awesome in every way from the greeting to the dessert. The atmosphere was charged with electricity - people seriously enjoying themselves everywhere. The service was excellent and the food was spectacular. We started with 2 crudos, hamachi tartar and fluke ceviche - fresh, clean and multi dimensional flavors. Perfect start with a bottle of crisp, well balanced Riesling from Alto Adige that was suggested by our phenomenally capable server. Second course was pasta - we shared  the famous spaghetti with garlic, Parmesan and chilies and the Orechiette with sausage, salumi & Pecorino - just perfect. For our main we shared a Branzino with roasted lemon, honey and olives and the roasted mushrooms with pancetta, fried egg and Ricotta salata. This was paired with a perfect Barbaresco again chosen by our amazingly talented server. Finally we shared 3 cheeses and a mind boggling bittersweet chocolate Budino. This meal was as good as any I have ever had and I ran an import wine Company for 21 years. I have never written a review this detailed. Awesome meal that exceeded extremely high expectations. Not easy getting a table but well worth the effort.",1,1,1
199,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",824,153,147,4.0,1/9/2017,"Excellent dining experience in the West Village.I've had my eye on L'Artusi given its positive reviews and my love for Italian food.  I try to get in a couple of nice dinner dates with the lady around the holidays so we came here on a Friday night (12/16/16) before life became hectic with work parties and traveling.  I'm happy to say we really enjoyed our meal.It seems difficult to get a table during peak hours so I made a reservation on OpenTable far in advance.  Sure enough, this place was hopping from the moment we walked in and far after we left.  The restaurant is unassumingly beautiful, consisting of sleek table settings and attractive décor.  The atmosphere was lively, and our server was able to keep up with the pace.The food was great.  We started with a couple of cheeses to pair with our wine, and the one featuring truffle was particularly tasty.  Next were the dayboat scallops, followed by the garganelli (mushroom, ragu, ricotta salata) and gnocchi (rabbit, tomato, basil, parmesan) pastas.  We thought the crudo and pasta dishes were well prepared and flavorful.  We capped things off with a delicious hazelnut chocolate torta.I highly recommend this restaurant, and I will certainly be back for seconds!",33,9,27
