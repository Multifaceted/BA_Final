0,Maximiliano P.,"New York, NY",1,7,2,5.0,5/24/2018,"The. Largest. Burgers. In. New. York. City. Possibly the world. Okay, that's an exaggeration. I'm sure there are obviously larger burgers than Jackson Hole, but off the top of my head, I can't think of any. I've been here sooo many times since I was little, and I don't know if it's the nostalgia or the actual food, but it's my favorite burger joint in New York City. I 100% recognize from the start that I actually do not think they are the most flavorful burgers ever, but the size, variety and ambience make these burgers my favorite. The burgers are HUGE. In a normal restaurant I could easily polish off my burger and go for more. This is generally when I start picking at the burger of whoever I am with, assuming they need the help jaja. At Jackson Hole, I am always completely stuffed. I generally finish the burgers, but there's no way in hell I'm picking at anybody else's afterwards. Each burger has an absolutely gigantic slab of meat. The meat itself as I said is NOT the most flavorful meat ever (although it is delicious), but the variety of burger types is what makes this place so great. Every sort of topping you could imagine, they have. Burgers with guacamole and chips? Check. Fried egg, tomatoes and ham? Check. Pizza burger? Check. Everything. The portions are huge and the prices are great. Their selection of fries is also wonderful- steak-cut fries, curly fries, waffle fries. If you're a fry addict, you won't be disappointed.Aside from the burgers, they have a pretty extensive menu of other stuff- Tex-Mex, salads, chicken, etc. I've never tried anything else because let's be honest- who comes to a burger spot for a salad? Considering the Wyoming flavor of this burger joint, I would imagine the Tex-Mex is good, but again...why come to a burger spot if you're not getting a burger.Jackson Hole has a full bar and everything is reasonably priced, but their real star drinks are the sodas. They make and bottle their own sodas (in glass bottles), and they are delicious. Root beer, cherry soda, cream soda, you name it. I'm a quasi-alcoholic who loves to drink, but I usually drink a soda instead of a cocktail here, because they are that good.The ambience of Jackson Hole is also part of what makes it great. It's got a great Wild West feel, with all sorts of cool adornments and memorabilia on the walls. Everything is wooden and cozy, and there's even a juke box at almost every table where you could put on your favorite tunes (provided you actually have a quarter). It has a fantastic old school Wild West feel, and it makes eater your monster burger even cozier. Best Burger Joint in NYC.",,,1
1,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",0,1,1,1.0,10/6/2018,"1.0 star rating 10/6/2018Be very weary about ordering food from this restaurant.  I ordered through Delivery.com and when the food arrived, it was wrong.  Not just a little wrong like mixing in dressing after it was asked to be on the side (they did that too, but at least they acknowledged that part).  No no, it was missing one whole item.   After two correspondences with the restaurant, they refuse to refund the money they owe me for the food that never arrived.Hopefully, for their sake, they take a look at their customer service policies and personnel.  As of right now, it is sub par at best and robbery at it's worst.For Reference:  The Jackson Hole Garden Salad should be (as stated on the menu):$13.25Romaine lettuce, cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, sliced egg, chopped bacon, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, cucumbers, red cabbage, shredded carrots and multi-grain herb croutons. Tossed in ranch dressing.What I did receive was a small tin container with lettuce, some tomatos and an unidentifiable vinegary dressing that was definitely not ranch.  It seemed more like they through in a side salad instead of what I actually ordered.  See photo below.",,,

4,Juliana G.,"Northport, NY",307,64,51,4.0,7/8/2018,"I went to Jackson Hole on a Sunday evening. The place was quiet - but started to pick up when we were leaving (7pm). We started with the appetizer sampler that came with mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders and buffalo wings. The wings and motz sticks were AWESOME. Knowing they're burgers are huge, I went with the salmon burger and my friend got a burger with cheese and bacon. The salmon burger was the best salmon burger i have ever had! Super flavorful and cooked perfectly. The curly fries were also super good. I took off one star because my friends burger was so big that it completely fell out of the bun and you definitely couldn't eat it without a fork and knife. The burger was also not as tasty as expected.",,,

I got a regular burger, deluxe style with a substitute of waffle fries and it was all just amazing. The burger is gigantic in size, crazy juicy. Very well made. The waffle fries were also nice and crisp. We also ordered the mozzarella sticks which are the typical mozz sticks one would get. I also tried my friend's nachos which were very average. Overall, just get the burger as you need all that stomach room to eat it all. It's the shining star of the restaurant.",3,1,5

The place has a cool aesthetic and the music was awesome with little juke boxes at the table. I enjoyed the old timey music. The burgers were huge! But very greasy and I wasn't super impressed. Wait staff was very friendly and she seemed new as she forgot to ask about how we wanted stuff cooked but she corrected her mistake and all was good.,,,
7,Patrice C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,69,152,4.0,5/7/2018,"So some coworkers of mine went to happy hour here a few months ago and I mocked them as who goes to Jackson Hole for happy hour? That's crazy right? Cut to last weekend when I was feeling for a burger and passed Jackson Hole so decided to stop in and take one to go. After lookin at the menu I got confused. They had some good sounding cocktails on there! And the smell wafting towards me was amazing. I had a feeling that I might have made a mistake all those months ago when a man who was leaving the place stopped in front of me, looked me dead in the eyes and said in a super dramatic way, ""mam, if you'd seen me in there you would say I'd never seen a burger in my life! I ate that thing like I was a recovering drug addict in a crackden!"" Everyone around me cracked up and he left rubbing his belly and moaning . I ordered the burger with Mac and cheese on it to go because I love Mac and cheese. I was worried it would be a greedy mess but when I got home and opened it, oh my. It looked divine. It smelled like heaven and golly wow it tasted like heaven and I realized that that guy wasn't actually off his rocker. And maybe my coworkers weren't crackpots for going there for happy hour?!?! It was so good I ate it all (except for the bit I shared with my dog). I'm glad I didn't get fries as the burger was very large and it wasn't so tasty it would be difficult to consume all of it in one sitting. So now I have a new burger joint. Farewell shake shack! Jackson Hole is where it's at (I can't believe it said that).",2,1,1
8,Erin S.,"Old Saybrook, CT",75,31,1,4.0,9/16/2018,We ordered via Seamless and were truly satisfied with our order. The food was delivered in an hour but everything was still hot upon arrival. The Fig and Blue salad was dressed just right and was the standout to me. Salmon tacos looked ok but apparently tasted excellent. Side order of mac and cheese made us wish we ordered the mac and cheese burger! Our son also devoured an order of chili cheese waffle fries. All in all it satisfied everyones cravings and we would definitely order or go to again if in the area.,,,

10,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,4.0,1/19/2018,Decided to stop in and try the soul burger. The size of a Jackson burger never disappoints and the burger was really tasty. Will be coming back to try one of their new burgers off their newly improved menu.,1,,1

12,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,472,472,4.0,3/1/2018,"I came here for lunch since it's close to work.  I've actually never been to any Jackson Hole locations anywhere.  They have a variety of burgers or you can create your own.  I ordered the western burger (pepper jack cheese, bacon, fried onions, BBQ sauce) cooked medium and my friend ordered a regular beef burger cooked medium rare.  The burgers were giant! definitely larger than I expected.  The western burger was $13 and it's a pretty good deal considering how large the burger was.  I'm glad I didn't order fries or onion rings which I was tempted to.  The burger was seasoned well and they were definitely generous with the ingredients.  However, the burger itself was so greasy and cumbersome to eat so I ate it with a knife and fork.  I also really appreciated the complimentary plate of pickles.  Service was fast and attentive.",,,
13,Cyrus B.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,10/12/2018,"Stopped coming here years ago because the service was horrible and the quality of the burger had deteriorated.

14,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1048,236,4.0,1/12/2018,"I was jonesing for a burger and onto Jackson Hole I went. It's basically an upscale diner. I ordered a burger with bacon, cheese, and mushrooms, and they left out the bacon. I didn't check to see if they charged us for it, though, but I only realized after the meal that it was missing.It's a pretty expensive meal including a side of fries - it came to about $20 for a burger with those fixin's and a side of sweet potato fries. However, the ambience is pretty relaxed. There are bar seats where you can watch a game on the telly or play Jenga/Connect 4.",1,,

Updated review","A perfect spot for groups, Jackson Hole is a local pub with a serious selection of pub fare. The burgers are the obvious heavyweights on the menu, and with lots of options, you're sure to find one that fits your fancy. I went for the guacamole burger, and could hardly fit my mouth around the gorgeously large 14oz patty! But if you're a burger lover like me, that's a good problem. Pair your burger with house waffle fries and a milkshake or a beer, and I guarantee you won't leave hungry! Plus, the decor is quaint and old school, making the whole experience feel like a hole-in-the-wall burger joint hidden right in the middle of Manhattan! Grab a table downstairs and chow down or sit upstairs and sip on draft beer and enjoy the old-school ambience. Every serious eater needs to try Jackson Hole!",4,2,3
19,Davide F.,"Harborview, San Diego, CA",7,6,0,3.0,8/25/2018,We brought friends from europe and we were a little disappointed. Fries were cold and tastelessHamburger was ok. Service also ok,,,

I would definitely recommend their Mac n Cheese burger and their Eastsider burger...SO GOOD. They have great happy hour specials for drinks so you can't beat it! Our waitress Lama was wonderful and had a personal unlike any server I've encountered! Overall, a great place to grub and cool down after a long day in the city.",,,
21,Sindy B.,"Manhattan, NY",42,3,1,5.0,2/9/2018,I always walk by this place and never had a desire to go inside. I ended up meeting my friends there for happy hour and I'm so glad I did.

We'll definitely be back!!,,,1

25,Gary B.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,13,0,1.0,6/14/2018,"After reading on Eater that they have a great burger, I ordered one delivered medium rare. It came very well done and was consequently  tasteless. Despite their reputation for such a good burger, things happen and rather than write a negative review, I reached out to them to see if they would like to try again. After 3 days, they finally got back to me. They didn't apologize and acted like I was trying to scam a burger out of them. They offered me a free dessert next time I order!! There are way too many great burgers in NYC to waste my time trying this one again. If they don't care, why should I?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           .",,1,

My burger was supposed to be medium and with mustard. It came very well done and without mustard. So I was stuck attempting to eat a super dry burger with soggy buns. Needless to say I didn't eat it. I'm only giving two stars because the waffle fries were good.",,,
28,Sandra A.,"Bloomsbury, NJ",86,3,1,1.0,6/24/2018,"My family and I have been eating at all the Jackson hole nyc restaurants for years. We actually started at this location. Recently, we frequent the Queens location and when it was opened the 2nd Avenue location. Today we went in and were so ridiculously disappointed, first my husband's burger was not cooked accordingly, the fries looked old and the server was not attentive enough to come and see how we were doing. Once told she apologized granted my husband had waited long enough for her to come to us that he no longer wanted to wait for it to be either recooked or redone but nothing. While all this is going on I'm still waiting for my food and when it comes...the chicken has a weird taste so long story short, my husband couldn't eat his burger and I couldn't eat my chicken. They did remove both entrees from the bill but I'd rather sit and eat my food, enjoy it and pay for it. For that reason Will not be coming to this location again.",,,
29,Kayko A.,"New York, NY",83,23,13,3.0,6/29/2018,I love the food and mainly the hospitable staff and the owner is amazing BUT there is this intimidatingly nasty hostile black guy with a beard that should be 100% not working there . He has tried to kick me out after I've ordered food and I ordered for take away in hopes of not seeing his scary intimidating face and IM BLACK. He obviously hates himself to treat a young model whose 113lbs with hostile intimidation. The owner is lovely but I question the manager supporting how badly he treated me after having been here for 2 years as a customer. I will get a photo of him when I leave and pray I don't get food poisoning by this aggressive asshole .,,,
30,Jatara I.,"Oyster Bay, NY",101,239,543,2.0,3/19/2017,"My co workers suggested Jackson Hole. They are known for they 7oz Burgers. I didn't know there was other locations. I usually eat at the Bayside location. As soon as we walked in it smelled like wet mop. If I was by myself I would of walked out but I wasn't and everyone still wanted to eat from there. It's a very tight squeeze when you walk in and it was more then 9 of us so they sat us down stairs in the additional seating area. Bathroom was very tight and small but clean. No paper towels only a hand dryer. The waitress was ok, nothing to brag about just ok. Anyway, I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I started to look at other options on the menu. One co worker suggested we order Hot and Spicy Chicken Wings while everyone else order burgers. I ended up ordering The wing, tender and mozzarella stick combo with sweet potato fries. It took about a 15 min wait for the food to come. It wasn't too bad but when your hungry 15 mins seems forever. Ok so the food arrives and everyone burger is looking amazing and smelling so good.  Then my food arrive. The wings are winglets and the mozzarella sticks are brunt and the chicken tenders taste like the Tyson one I buy for my daughter. Everything was nasty and a waste of money. Oh wait did I mentions half of my sweet potatoes fries was awesome and the other half was brunt. So now I'm looking around in disappointment at everyone while they eat they burgers. I couldn't even eat anymore I just left it. The co worker that order the hot and spicy chicken was extremely disappointed as well. There was nothing hot or spicy about that it looked the same as my two chicken winglets. This place is only good for the 7oz burgers and nothing else.",2,2,2

Why do they use such large plates? Dumb. The dining space is already too cramped. The burger was NOT small- in fact, too big to pick up & eat without everything falling out & breaking apart. My husband decided to just use a fork & the flavor was ho-hum. I had the salmon entree. It was OK. I had to ask for salad dressing. Even though there were many employees, service was lackluster.

54,Gia G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,7,0,1.0,8/14/2018,"Gross experience! Where do I begin? Firstly, upon walking into this ""hole"", you are met w/a disgusting whiff of greasy, smokey, nauseating, dead cow meat fumes endlessly cooking on the grill. There is no escape from the permeating fumes. As the restaurant is tiny, & the kitchen is right on top of you the entire time while you are eating. Then, to make matters worse, all of the food that we had was pretty tasteless, greasy, bland, soggy, & sub par. The coffee tasted like watered down toilet water, & was undrinkable. We had to send it back. Then, the fish came out ""uncooked"" & pretty much raw. We had to send it back, & got no real apologies. When it came back it looked even grosser, & greasier then it did before. The potatoes were greasy, stiff, & way too salty, the salad was dry, had old lettuce leaves w/actual bug bite holes in them, & was bland. And, the broccoli was soggy, & dripping in oil. The utensils were dirty, & stuffed into a glass on the side of the table, & left out all day so anyone could handle them. And, the whole place looked very unclean. Needless to say, none of the cooks, or waitstaff seemed to really care too much about any of this. On top of this, we got so sick, & what feels like food poisoning from this dive. To make matters worse, a child was choking at the table next to us. And, no one did anything to try to help her, nor seemed to care. I wish that I could give it zero stars! This was truly a horrifying experience. And, this place is not anything like the Jackson Hole restaurant which is located in Queens (which is actually edible). Do not waste your money here unless you want to get violently ill, & totally turned off. This place should be shut down. It's just plain gross, YUK!",1,,

Four of us ordered our burgers to be cooked one way and they came to us cooked totally different from what we asked. I asked for medium rare and it was very well done.

71,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,10/27/2015,Jackson hole is a burger institution in New York City. My uncle used to go to the location on 87th on the upper Eastside on his work break for lunch.  It's nice to know that some places in the city might change location but they do not change their food. There is a full bar inside with a good draft options as well as a full liquor selection. You can order your food online and they deliver to the office if you want.  Jackson hole is predominantly a burger place you can get all different types of burgers. Their burgers are not made with imitation meat.  it is real meat. No fillers. Old school. Literally the burger is a chunk of chop meat grilled on the flat top. The Cook puts a tin bowl over the top of the burger as it cooks this steams the burger and forms that really nice crust on the bottom of the burger. That crust is flavor!  I don't think they use any spices in their meat because the grill markings are enough flavor. I love how they put a bowl of there fresh made pickles on the table before you eat. The pickles are sooo good!Jackson hole has expanded their menu two different items you can get Panini's here you can get breakfast and shakes. Everything is good I do recommend getting a burger though you have to do the burger if you come here. I ended up drinking three Stella Artois's. The only issue that I had was that the beer wasn't cold it was more room temperature. But after the first beer went down the temperature did not bother me. Portion size they say that it's a 7oz burger. Every time I have gotten a burger here it has been more like a 18oz burger. There portions are HUGE. I usually just get a burger no fries or anything. I can never finish my burger. You could split a burger with someone else. That is how big the portions are here. Price wise Jackson hole is great. A single cheeseburger is $8.99 they do have other burger options that go as high as $15 but that is for burgers that have all lot of special toppings. I would rather come here then go to a chain burger place any day you get way more for your money at Jackson hole. The staff is nice the manager was joking around with us. Our waitress was this young Russian girl and she was very attentive. Even the cooks said hi to us as they walked by. Overall Jackson hole has remained a great burger place. My uncle haven't eaten here in over 20 years and he told me that it was just as he remembered it. You get a lot for your money here I will continue to come back to Jackson hole. PROS:- huge portions- great burgers - pickles are delicious and free- friendly staff- 15% off with Yelp check in!CONS: - draft beer was room temp.,2,1,2

I know that my lord and savior would not be pleased with this huge patty, dripping cheese, barbeque sauce, fried onions with a fried egg on top. I feel embarrassed to have licked the barbeque sauce that was dripping down my arm and on my cheek off like the savage beast that I became once I laid eyes on that burger. I know that I may not make it into heaven because of this but honestly this burger was heaven on Earth. Highly recommended for those that dare cross over into the gluttonous valley of sin.",1,5,

I mean I've had many, many burgers in my life and the one I ate this place ranks pretty high on the list. I heard stories, myths and legends about Jackson Hole and there famous burgers. This was an experience unlike any other. I went with a friend of mine and we took our time looking at the menu. They have a pretty good selection a little bit of everything for everyone. So I had the Guacamole Burger and my friend had the Wyoming Burger. It was literally love at first sight for both of us and we enjoyed the hell out of it. Good seasoning, fresh and tasty flavor. The burgers were so huge that my friend only ate maybe half of it and I barely finished mine. Basically this place is great for the price you pay you get more than your money's worth, the service is good and the place itself has a nice vibe to it. This is my new burger spot. I highly recommend",1,,

I was attracted to this place because of its cheap prices and large menu.I ordered a grilled cheese and (due to their VERY limited beer selection) a gin and tonic. The grilled cheese was bland and hard. I didn't know it was even possible to make a bland grilled cheese but they managed.Then the bill came and I almost lost it. My grilled cheese was under $5...my gin and tonic was $12. If you're going to be a cheap bar, stick to it. My food ended up being 1/6th of my bill after 2 drinks.Screw this place.

They have just about every burger combination you can think of, which is their specialty but also serve a LOT more than just burgers. The 7oz Burger was HUMUNGOUS!! Bigger than I even expected. My only complaint would be that the meat does not stay together, the entire burger patty eventually falls apart and makes a mess on your plate, but still tasty nonetheless.

It's a lame 15% off 4-6 pm on Monday, Tues, Weds. It doesn't say how awful that deal is till you already checked in.Second, while ordering, I asked the waitress which sauces they had and they said bbq, honey mustard, and ranch and so I asked for a bit of each to dip fries into. I asked about cost and she said they were free. When the bill comes I was charged 90 cents for the bbq.So I tell her she told me it was free, to which she says ""but the menu says 90 cents"" (on the 4th page in small print somewhere towards the bottom). I tell her she said it was free and she said there's nothing she can do without getting in trouble from her manager. I tell her I'm having an extremely poor experience and she literally says ""oh well I'm new here"".Finally I ask to talk to the manager.

The taste was quite good and the size was big enough for a regular-sized person to end up satisfied. The fries were definitely not the best waffle fries I've tried.

I came with two friends who got burgers while I just got some onion rings. The onion rings really hit the spot and were fried to a crisp. The burgers themselves were probably at least 1 lb. Each plate arrived as a space saucer sized puck of ground beef resting atop a hamburger bun. The beef, although somewhat under-seasoned, still tasted decent with the rest of the toppings. This place emphasizes a bit more on the quantity as opposed to the quality of their burgers.To finish one of their burgers seems a feat fit for a gluttonous masochist.

Only 4 tables (10 people total) but after 35 minutes we still did not have our food.  There were at least 4 servers, a bus boy and cooks and the manager.  They were all chatting in the front totally not paying attention to their customers.  When we asked for more drinks they seemed annoyed.  Food came but was missing things.  Manager finally came over and said ""not the end of the world"" mean while the burger was cold but still good since Jackson Hole has great burgers.  Server never came back to ask if we wanted another drink or to offer the check.  We left and as we went to the front to ask for our check, the staff was again all up there chatting away.  Never said ""sorry for your experience"".  Manager needs another job since the site will fail within the next 18 months; just too many other places that offer sincere customer service.  Rents are too high to give poor service.  They obviously don't want us as customers so we will go elsewhere too.  Shame.  Other Jackson Hole locations are so much better.  Skip this one.",,,

Very good burgers that are a decent size, variety of toppings and how you want burgers not to mention other choices of junk food goodies...Only thing that KIND OF got under my skin while I was at this one in particular is that the waitress that served me and my friend seemed like she was rushing us to give us the check despite it not being crowded in the restaurant at all. I don't know if she thought we were going to do a dine -and-dash (not my style) but I felt a little uncomfortable with that. Regardless though a nice spot to get a good burger in Kips Bay.",4,,
109,Nicolette S.,"Baldwin, NY",6,7,40,3.0,8/18/2014,"Starting off there were three of us at the table && the check came up to $69. That was kind of rough on the eyes but w.e. So it was on a Saturday around 10:45pm. Plenty of space which was great. Space was kind of right getting to the seats but it was okay.When you first sit down they bring you these amazing pickles. Something about them just makes me want them more && more. They have a lot of options on the menu but it's kind of a mix & match. For simple burgers like a bacon cheeseburger you can order diff ways. They have a bacon cheeseburger but it doesn't come with lettuce & tomatoes. Or you can orders cheeseburger with bacon. But that's with the whole menu they have diff ways to order the same thing but deepening on how you do it you might end up spending more money. So we all ordered- appetizer trio (or something like that) mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders (nice white meat, a little salty, but HOT) & the wings(small small small you could barely tell if they were supposed to be reg fried wings or hot wings. Lacked flavor). Pizza burger (added shrooms) cheeseburger (added bacon & avocado) & the ""kadubo burger"" (lol can't remember). I had water, one friend had a corona, the other had a cocktail (it was red) because they were out of Stella. Food came && looked delicious. Was nice hot && fresh. They did forget my avocado && the burger could use a little bit of salt && pepper (added it on my own && it was better). For my bacon cheeseburger I wish there was more bacon. I just think if it a 7oz burger two pieces of bacon && one slice of cheese isn't enough. (Maybe it's just me) the fries were COLD. Didn't order more because I figured it would be from the same batch. The check came && you could hardly read what was on the check. (Handwritten not printed) so there was no way to see if we were charged correctly. Service was fine. Pretty quick. Not sure if it was because we were a table of the constantly engaged in conversation or because that's the norm. Hope this helps you. This is not to say don't go to JH... Just know what to expect.

When we first walked in, there was a strong smell (maybe urinal cakes? like a bad bathroom chemical smell) wafting into the front bar area. Yuck.When we sat down in the back, I saw some of the burgers other people had and decided not to get a burger. So do keep in mind, I didn't get what this place is famous for. They just looked huge and not very appealing (I am more in the camp of quality over quantity when it comes to food.)If what you want is a gigantic, huge burger at a reasonable price, then this place may be a good option for you. But if you want an excellent burger, there are a thousand better burger places in the city - don't kid yourself and think this is one of them.I had a turkey club, which was OK. The bread was hard (not stale just a hard style of bread, not what I expected on a turkey club) which made eating it a challenge. Also, they served it with potato salad and cole slaw rather than fries... Yeah that's a mistake. Stick to the basics, sandwiches and burgers come with fries.It wasn't terrible, and I didn't get sick from eating here, but I certainly won't be coming back. Thus... solid 2 stars.The price was very reasonable for Manhattan.You take the check up front to pay, near the entrance (like a diner.)

It looks like they didn't wash the lettuce because it was very dry and dirty looking. When I saw those bugs on my plate, I got sooo disgusted and needed to leave.

Plus when you try to eat them the burger can fall apart but before you could be bothered by this it's for a good reason because it is packed with a good amount of beef not something that looks like about the size and shape of a packaged cookie! The fries are fine but could be crispier. Though they are steak fries, fulfilling to say the least not shoestrings!Been full each time I have eaten so I can't comment on desserts.

Jackson Hole is the famous home of the 7 oz burger located in Murray Hill. I've actually ordered from here before from my office, but I visited the location for the first time yesterday. It's a small hole in the wall diner and it was definitely packed for lunch time. After my boyfriend and I sat down to order our waitress brought a small dish of pickles for us to enjoy. By pickles I'm actually describing cucumbers diced up in chunks in a garlic/onion vinegar mix. They weren't too bad.I looked over the menu and ended up ordering the 7 oz soul burger, which has American cheese, ham, thick slices of fried onion, and a couple of slices of bacon. He ordered the Western burger and we got a plate of waffle fries to share. Oh my lord! When our waitress brought out those burgers I could NOT believe my eyes. They were HUGE. The burger to bun ratio is probably 3 to 1 if you can imagine that. Plus the patties are very thick. My only complaint was that there were too many onions and they weren't extremely thin slices, which is my personal preference. But again, I'm sure if you like your onions like that you'll enjoy this.It was about $12 or $13 for just the burger and they were good quality burgers. However, this is the type of meal I would have if I'm not eating anything else for the rest of the day or having a very LIGHT dinner. TIP: You pay your bill at the front cashier before leaving.

The burger patty is also very bumpy, because it was formed by hand from ground meat! That is rare to find since most diners use frozen patties, so I give them kudos for that.However, taste-wise, the burger was just okay. It could definitely be seasoned better.

The patties are EXTREMELY loosely packed, so much so that the burger kinda comes apart halfway through. I went with the Western Burger, which came topped with melted Jack cheese, BBQ sauce, bacon, and fried onions. The burger came out at the requested medium-rare, but the whole thing was just a sloppy mess. Between the BBQ sauce, melted cheese, and gushing meat juices, there was so much moisture that I resorted to using my fork and knife (blasphemy, I know, but I had no choice) to eat the last 1/3 of the burger. A sloppy mess, but tasty nonetheless. The side order of fries were okay; nothing special, but not bad, either. For about $11, the burger and fries was a decent value and a pretty tasty meal.

It was a pretty big burger, even for my standards. I thought that was a good thing so the burger would stand out despite all the toppings. I was right, but not in a good way. The taste of the burger did stand out, but the taste was a bit bland. I read a previous review where the writer said there was no seasoning on the burger and he was on point.

So I walked three doors down to grab a burger. Once seated, a drink on the menu called to me, vanilla egg cream! A distant cousin to my all time favorite Vietnamese drink, soda sa ht gà, it lacks any egg or cream, but is something they just don't have on the west coast. So I ordered that and a bacon cheese burger, medium rare. While I waited for my food, they brought out some lightly pickled cucumber chips and my drink. Both were so good! While pickles and egg cream might not be the best pairing, I was happy. In about 5 minutes, my burger came out:yelp.com/biz_photos/YKKB…It was huge! They say the burger is only 7oz, but that must be the weight after they cook it. The pile of bacon atop my meat pile was equally impressive, yet slightly undercooked. Since I enjoy chewy bacon it was no big deal. The burger was cooked perfectly and the meat was fluffy and loosely packed. But this burger was not without a major failing, no salt! The meat was so bland! I was able to salvage the flavor by salting every bite, but I shouldn't have to do that. If you're looking for a huge, lightly packed burger, this is your place!

Delivery times range from 20 minutes to 45 minutes, usually quicker when I've got time and longer when I need it now or am starving. Maybe it just seems that way. My go to food here is the Bronco, the grilled chicken sandwich. I've had it many different ways, but my current favorite is the Mexican which has cheddar cheese and jalapenos. Adding bacon is never a mistake. As good as the chicken is, the star may be the toasted roll. A nice crunch and just a tad garlicky, it's pretty great.Getting a ""platter"" gives you fries, lettuce, and tomato. The steak fries are great (They have curly fries now for a little extra. Curly fries rule!). The inconsistency is with the lettuce and tomato. Sometimes you'll get what seems like half a head of lettuce and a puny slice of tomato, sometimes you'll get a couple leaves of lettuce and three big, juicy slices of tomato. Two tomatoes is the sweet spot for me. I'd be so happy if I just always got 2 slices of tomato.If you need to add to your Sandwich, the mozzarella sticks are good, and the Caesar salad is always a nice choice (with or without grilled chicken). I'd order extra dressing for the salad as the amount they put on (like the tomatoes) tends to be inconsistent.Breakfast is good as well. Waffles with strawberries, or the Guacamole Omelet (served with fries and tortilla chips) are delicious options even if the sun is down (which is when I usually order them).They make a good milkshake and the house branded cream soda can be nice as well.I'm told the burgers are pretty good too, if that's your thing.",,,
190,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,136,73,3.0,1/5/2011,"I was first introduced back in 1998 when I was still new to the City and someone gasped that I had never tried one of their burgers, swearing that it's ""the"" place to go for a burger in Manhattan. My memories of eating here are few but fond, but strangely vague. Rarely do I get that huge juicy burger craving when I'm in Manhattan...so I can't say I've come here much over the years....I mean with so many dining options, exotic and not, rarely do I ""resort"" to the burger thing at the burger joint, and when I do, it's usually a diner just for the old world nostalgia atmosphere I tend to fetishize.Lately I'm on E.34TH Street in Murray Hill for work on a regular basis, so I pass Jackson Hole on 3rd Av frequently. After the blizzard we had last week, I worked up quite an appetite hiking around one day. I found myself having an intense juicy burger craving, and Jackson Hole was calling my name. Knowing it was considered the default burger spot, but forgetting when I had my last experience there, I decided to revisit.I enjoyed my burger and steak fries (I LOVE steak fries!) but honestly, the burger was nothing amazing. I was actually a little let down. 67 Burger trumps this place BY FAR in taste. While thick and sizable, the meat was just regular old ground chuck, which could be fine, nothing stood out about the taste...it was even a little tasteLESS. I like mine cooked medium, so it's not like it was overcooked or dried out. It had juicy mass - but it was kinda blah. You know how the meat on some burgers are just delicious? Well their's was just basically like a good diner burger. Even the bun was nothing special. I was sad for them. Checking back on a NYC classic joint like Jackson Hole, I thought I'd be pleasantly reminded....but I gotta say I can name several places who outdo the Jackson Hole burger around town:1. 67 Burger (Brooklyn) - most amazing big juicy burger I've had in yrs2. Dutch Boy (Brooklyn) although overpriced - especially when ordered in the bar, their burger is TO DIE FOR3. Grand Canyon (Diner - Brooklyn Hts) really really really well-executed, classic burger (this is where I've been going for burgers for the longest)4. Junior's (Cheesecake) omg...yup...even Junior's burger is pretty damn good...better than Jackson Hole....I hate to say it. But their service certainly ain't.5. That Coffee Shop on the corner of 60th & Lex (Manhattan)....they have basic, yet great, satisfying burgers!!! Their bison burger is muy delicioso too6+ Numerous run-of-the-mill Village, Murray Hill, Uptown cafes and Bistros have unbelievable burgers, like French Roast....too many to name...but I've tasted many that trumped my latest one at Jackson Hole :( The service and fries at Jackson Hole were perfect for my mood when I hit the J Hole last week....it hit the spot but not over-the-top fancy or overdone. Just good, classic stuff. Although the decor here is a little kitschy, it's also a little cute and homey - I get the theme, even if it's kinda dated.

The wedges are also good! Not too greasy, not to salty-Just rightThe prices were right on point! Its worth itOur waitress was very friendly and got everything that we needed!My friends and I will def be back!",1,,

I ordered a regular burger with Swiss and bacon medium rare, and it came out very over cooked, and lacking flavor and juices. My bf ordered the Western veggie burger, even though the burger looked like a fresh veggie pattie, it didn't taste good, again lacking flavor. The onion rings and fries were good but after the sub-par burgers we didn't want to try anything else. The waitress was also very rude and kept staring at us as we ate which was borderlined stalker-ish, I guess I wouldn't blame her since we were the ONLY 2 PEOPLE eatting. Overall I have eaten a lot of burgers in my day and these burgers were bland and tasteless. Not worth the trip, at least not at this location.",1,1,1
198,Danny S.,"New York, NY",1,27,9,3.0,3/22/2013,I usually go to here during my lunch break. This place has enormous burgers with a decent taste to them. Nothing that'll really wow you aside from the size of the burgers. The atmosphere is very cozy and the waitresses are friendly. Its a good place to go to lunch with a few friends.,,,

Having literally just moved into the area days before, I had spent my day unpacking and cleaning with my mom. All of a sudden it was 2:30 and we both realized we had nothing but coffee all day. Needless to say we were starving!I really wanted to like this place. It had a hole in the wall feel, but was extremely cozy. The service left much to be desired, sometimes I think they forgot people were waiting to be fed. The burgers were forgettable and fell apart,  a fork was a necessity. Who eats a burger with a fork!Even though I enjoyed the atmosphere, it wasn't enough to keep my coming back.",1,,
