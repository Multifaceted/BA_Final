0,Paul S.,"Southwest Houston, Houston, TX",8,13,2,5.0,9/25/2018,"We just returned from a week at this hotel - it was great.  The location is very good, only 1 block to Times Square and Broadway shows.  The room was spacious by NY standards and everything was new clean and maintained well.  Comfortable beds plus a sofa and desk with a chair.  Soap and body wash are provided, plenty of towels as well.  Daily housekeeping.  We were on the 25th floor and had a great view to the Hudson River.  Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and friendly.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and had a variety of hot and cold items.  Excellent experience.",,,
1,Marquise A.,"Los Angeles, CA",509,5,2,1.0,10/1/2018,"WORST check-in setup ever!!! We checked in at 2pm and were told that room was not ready until 3pm. No issues there. We paid and provided all check-in information and waited on the patio until check-in time. At 3pm we were told we had to go back into the check-in line, which was promptly directed out the front door onto the sidewalk. I've never in my life had to wait in the check-in line twice at any hotel/resort for room keys. Very poor setup and check-in experience...first wait 10 mins. The second wait was over 45...waste of time when trying to get into your room and enjoy your vacation...UPDATE: upon waiting in the 40 min line for the room. It's now 3:40 and we are told that the room is not ready. Wow...an hour and 40 mins waiting and still no room...hmm???",2,,
2,Herman K.,"Toronto, Canada",98,14,2,4.0,7/13/2018,"Everything was great, from the cleanliness of the room, to the efficiency of the staff at reception and luggage check. Only complaints are that they never left bottled water on any of my 5 days as specified in the terms, and the liquid shower gel dispenser ran out on the last day.The location from subway and Times Square were a huge benefit to staying here and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting NYC.",1,1,1

4,Tracy T.,"Markham, Canada",228,426,1284,4.0,4/10/2018,"From the large illuminated windows on the outside to the high ceilings and chic decor in the lobby, this hotel was gorgeous. Just a few minutes away from Time Square, it's located in a bustling area of the city and really gives you that sigh of relief when you catch sight of it after a long day exploring the city. TIP: This is a great place to stay if you're looking to catch some nighttime musicals because it's very conveniently located and will only take you a max. 10 min walk to get to/from the shows. The staff were polite and helpful, the complimentary breakfast was surprisingly better than I anticipated (they offered smoked salmon, yum!), and I didn't experience any issues during my stay.The rooms were tidy, however, I did notice some infrastructural water damage around the corner from the shower stall. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends and would gladly come back for another stay if I were to visit New York again.",5,1,4

Anyway, their breakfast was extremely good,       They even give you breakfast for free since you payed for your room! They have a small gym downstairs. I really recommend this place.",,,

7,Kathy S.,"Beaumont, Canada",3,5,0,5.0,10/16/2018,"First time in NYC, loved this hotel. Great location. King room was small but perfect - clean and comfortable! And the bathroom seemed huge....loved the walk-in shower. Wish the mini-fridge had had a freezer but was happy breakfast was included. It wasn't great - if I lived in the area, I wouldn't bother - but there was enough variety to be able to find something! And the location was perfect. Will definitely recommend to friends.",,,
8,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1274,735,1020,1.0,11/6/2017,"This review is specifically referring to the breakfast buffet - which I unfortunately experienced.I live close by and often times I've seen their sign advertising a $19.99 breakfast buffet offer.  This past weekend since we were both up early we decided to give it a shot.  After all, since it's in the RIU hotel, it can't be bad right?  Wrong!When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess who said we can pick any seat.  The area was pretty big and seats were plentiful.  When I checked out the spread, it featured your standard hot items such as eggs, sausages and bacon, along with a selection of bread, fruit, cereal and some veggies as well.  Since the area was big, the same spread was available in both wings of the buffet area.I can say without doubt this was seriously one of the worst buffets, and breakfasts in general, that I ever tried. Where to begin?The meats were awful.  There were two varieties of sausage and both tasted terrible.  The flavor was just blah.  The bacon was also poorly cooked.  Nearly all the pieces were limp and had nothing but a rubbery texture.As for the carbs - the waffles here were absolutely the worst waffles I ever tasted in any restaurant.  All of them were super soft and had a texture that almost resembled pasta.  It was simply gross and disgusting.  Even the Eggos that you can throw in your toaster are a million times better than this.The eggs were also disgusting.  The scrambled eggs were runny and the pile of eggs over easy were a jumbled mess with many yolks broken and smashed.  As for the fruit, I'm not quite sure how you can get this wrong - but the melons were rock hard and many of the strawberries were literally smashed and not handled with care.  Who knows if it's because the people who grabbed them were just rough, but either way the staff here just didn't seem to care one way or the other about the quality or overall conditions of the buffet spread.  On one occasion the coffee machine ran out of milk (coffee with milk is one of the vending machine options).  We told the staffer nearby about it and the staffer told us to get the milk separately and simply add it the regular coffee.  I can see why there's an outpouring of negative feedback about the general service of this hotel.  The lack of attention to detail or general customer service practices are astounding for a hotel of this magnitude in this particular location.  But I digress.The only things that didn't suck were the toast and cereal.  You get the point.  Anything that actually requires effort here - whether if it's the food, keeping the buffet area well stocked/clean and any regard to customer service falls extremely short of expectations.  To put things in perspective, I recently stayed at an old Cold War-era hotel with amenities that resembled Soviet-era standards in the Czech Republic.  That included their breakfast buffet.  Even the food there, which was unimpressive by most standards, was still way superior than this garbage.  They even kept the place clean and pristine, as opposed to the greasy buffet tables and sticky floors that I experienced.This place needs a LOT of work.  Someone at the hotel should take note of this and get to work.",8,4,2
9,Samantha I.,"Miami, FL",218,79,167,4.0,4/8/2018,"Loved it! Stayed at the Riu Plaza last year when I visited NYC in March. They have great prices and the location is perfect. The hotel lobby and hotel itself is beautiful/modern. Check in was a little hectic since a lot of people were checking in at once. That was the only thing I didn't like, but it is what it is. Our room was really nice, very clean and although it was on the small side, we were happy with it. At the end of the day you come to NYC to be out and about not locked up in your room!They don't offer room service which was another thing we were a little bummed about, but no big deal. They have a cafe in the lobby with some REALLY good cheesecake. That was a nice little surprise. We enjoyed our stay here and I would definitely consider staying here again during my next visit to NYC!:)",1,,
10,Sharon W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,28,3,4.0,2/12/2018,"This hotel is beautiful and very clean. The elevators are fast. And the amenities are sufficient for the price range. My husband and I stayed here for two nights and were extremely satisfied. We got a queen room and it was very spacious considering other places we had looked. The shower was amazing and perfect for washing off the grime of hustling around the city all day. The closet fit all of our luggage and the TV channel selection was nice. Good views from 17th floor. Bed was comfortable and the abundance of electrical outlets and mini fridge made it even better. We even checked out the fitness center and you can get in a pretty decent workout with equipment. It was also fairly quiet. No unexpected or obnoxious noise outside of a few sirens which can't be helped. Location is subperb. Quick walk or subway ride to everything manhattan. The only slight negative and why I gave 4 stars is the $200 security deposit they shake you down for upon check in. New York City is already an expensive city as it is, and that can really cut into a spending budget. I booked through an online travel agent so that may be why I didn't know about this until I got to the front desk, but I don't remember seeing that or the resort fee listed anywhere on their website. The manager was very understanding and explained the policy well and salvaged our stay.",1,1,2
11,Mary Ellen P.,"Needham, MA",1,13,0,3.0,10/19/2018,"Fabulous location, near Times Sq., theatre district, restaurant row.  Fairly small room for the price paid., room was very clean.  One issue with the bathroom, the walk in shower floor was very slippery,  water was VERY hot in shower, I had some difficulty with the shower controls and at one point had the hot water blasting at me. I was afraid I was going to slip in the shower, shower curtain was too long for the shower, another fall hazard.  Breakfast food was average.  We had no difficulty with check in, large lobby, plenty of places to sit and wait.  Bell hop helpful in storing bags when we went out on day of departure.  One thing I found very annoying in lobby was blaring music, I thought it was overkill and not necessary.  There is so much noise on the streets of NY it might be nice to have some quiet in the lobby.",,,
12,Barbara B.,"Odenton, MD",0,17,22,4.0,3/22/2018,"Four STARS. Hotel was clean, staff was helpful, awesome location. Quick walk to Broadway shows. Nice lounge with all day specials and great staff.",1,,
13,Joshua G.,"Austin, TX",196,40,6,4.0,3/30/2018,"Lee Amanda and Lidabel were great and friendly. The older night time manager was an arrogant, pompous prejudging jerk, to be completely honest.Room was small for $350 a night, but liked that it was 2 blocks away from Times Square craziness and in heart of Hell's Kitchen and two doors next to gay bar.Their daily breakfast is from 6 - 11 a.m. and ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT. LOVED that most besides the attendant at door and housekeeping lady. Manager was a dick and rude.",,,
14,Jennifer Irene G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",800,37,44,1.0,11/16/2017,"I haven't even gotten to the hotel and I am already having the worst experience ever. At 9pm pst I called to confirm our bed  for our anniversary reservation for arrival on Dec 5 for a short stay of 3 days. Not only was I hung up on twice, the guys at the front desk speak poor English and one guy even yelled at me when I called and told them that I am calling ahead to confirm a bed type or upgrade the room so that we don't have any surprises before flying across the country for our short 3 day anniversary trip. Mind you I was very polite and had a soft gentle tone to my voice and the guy yelled at me anyways. He seemed very annoyed like this call was inconvenient to him or whatever he was doing. Not only were they refusing to take our request to be put in a Queen or king bed, and even denying our request to upgrade our room type, they were insisting that they were going to put us in two twin beds. Can you imagine coming with your significant other to nyc from California to have to sleep in two separate twin beds? Eladio , the guy working the front desk kept putting us on hold and i listened to him have an argument while I was on the phone About who was going to take my call. Then Jesus Lopez took the phone and it took 15 min for us to pull up the reservation because he couldn't understand us as we very clearly spelled out the name on our reservation. After Jesus pulled up our reservation he refused to confirm our room for a king or a queen bed and was telling us our only option was two twins. It wasn't because there were no other rooms available, is because he was refusing to help us. What four star hotel wouldn't take the proper procedures to ensure that their guests that were arriving were going to be able to get a queen or king bed when they are calling over 20 days before their arrival date and they HAVE the rooms available? How can you guys call yourself a 4 Star hotel  and refuse to confirm our request for a king or queen when you have the rooms available? You can't put a couple in two twin beds! This trip is supposed to be enjoyable and exciting and we are 20Days before arrival and our customer service experience is awful and we aren't even there yet.I don't understand why they can't just type into our reservation that we want a queen or king bed and ensure us that we won't be having to sleep in two twin beds on the day of our arrival.If this matter isn't handled immediately I will be taking the necessary steps to make sure this is known to corporate and to the public. 4 star rating, and this is what we get? Not acceptable.BookJenniferIrene@gmail.…",6,2,2
15,Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2269,1707,2216,5.0,11/1/2016,"Fabulously trendy and new upscale hotel just a block away from the Times Square hustle and bustle.  We stayed here for our last night because after kind of slumming it the first week, I wanted something nice and with close access to Times Square and everything else Uptown.I'm going to list the pros then the cons:PROS:-Great location-Trendy lobby and bar area, even an outdoor nook to hang out!-Easy check-in process-Helpful staff-Firm bedding, pillows-Typical bathroom that reminded me of European hotels, such as the shower-Abundance of towels was great-Huge TV screen, even though we only watched the news.-Great view of 42nd/8th Ave.CONS:-No checking out via the TV-Checking in takes forever when the lines are long-Smoking is right outside the doors so the stink just wafts in-Elevators are slow-Need more pillows-Need additional blanketsOverall, 5 stars for comfort, safety, ability to open the window for circulation, visual niceness, and easy access to Central Park, the Theater district, Times Square, and Carnegie Hall.",5,5,8
16,Jason A.,"Hamden, CT",0,11,1,3.0,3/6/2018,"Check in was unsatisfactory. Felt rushed and the lady taking care of my room was not personal at all. ROOM WAS GREAT! 28th floor at the end of the hallway. Loved the view....No screen in the window, kinda weird. Outside the room was noisy in the halls. Also like every other review I read on hotels.com the shower leaked badly.All in all I would say I overpaid for a plain hotel room.",,,
17,Marlene C.,"New Haven, CT",0,12,16,5.0,11/20/2017,"Great location!!  About a block away from the theatre district.  The room was clean and modern.  If you're sharing a room with a friend, be aware that they will be able to see you in the shower (at least your silhouette!) The breakfast bar had various cold and hot items, including a fancy coffee machine that makes various drinks.  There's also a Dunkin Donuts across the street, if that's your style.There's also a small street market located across the street where you can get your last minute souvenirs, of course.I would definitely stay here again!",1,,
18,Kendra B.,"McLean, VA",190,81,255,4.0,5/20/2016,"I stayed here the week of April 13th for a few nights and it was a great find! I searched for weeks for a reasonably priced hotel for a mini birthday getaway. The hotels in Times Square are over priced and many have horrible reviews. I lucked up on this hotel while perusing Expedia.com. There weren't many reviews but I saw ""new"" and it caught my attention. They had a soft opening and the hotel is not completely done. So no full service and only certain floors open and accessible. However, I didn't care much. I went to see ""The Color Purple"" on Broadway and this place was literally across the street from the theater - a 3 minute walk in heels. It was awesome! Check in was a breeze. I booked a king suite, I was told my room was not ready. Check in is at 3pm and it was about 4:30pm. The guy asked me if I wanted an upgrade....a room on a higher floor with two twin beds. Uum, that's not an upgrade where I'm from buddy. No thank you! He managed to find a king suite and gave me the run down and I was on my way. The lobby is very well done. Plenty of lounging areas. It's actually beautiful. Unfortunately, I didn't snap many pics. The elevators were fast and you can smell the newness all around. I arrive to my room - 17th floor with a city view. Sweet!! The room was quite small but nice. The television was wall mounted to maximize space. The room was very modern and sleek. I think I liked the bathroom the most. Crisp white towels and full of essential toiletries. So far, so good. I settled in and turned the air on. Yes, it's still a bit cool in New York this time of the year but I cannot sleep in a hot box. The only negative reviews I'd come across talked about the rooms being hot. Well, this indeed was the case. I cranked it down as low as possible and left it there while I caught my show. Upon turn, the temperature had only dropped 2 degrees. Eeeek!! I let it be. I cracked the window for a bit and that did the trick. The only thing is, with a city view and it being NYC....you're not sleeping with an open window. The noise and honking and talking and chatter (even on the 17th floor) with an open window was a bit much. However, there was no sound with the window closed. I did not complain. The room was cool enough for me to achieve maximum comfort. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows plush and soft. Zzzzzzz....BUT, I woke the next morning to the sound of drilling and hammering. COME ON!!! They were working on the room next door. Just splendid! I walked out to inquire and after realizing the room next door was occupied they immediately stopped working which was nice. Night two was pretty warm. Again, I didn't complain because it was clear they were working out kinks with the opening. I switched the air from ""auto"" to ""on"" and let it run all night. All in all, my stay was good. It was comfortable and clean. That's first when I'm away from home. The rate was a steal compared to some of the other hotels. It's new and I wasn't concerned with bringing critters home with me. It would have been nice to comment on the bar and the restaurant and other services but they weren't open yet - hence my 4 stars. They have a little cafe for snacks and coffee which was convenient. But the hotel is in the middle of everything. So finding food wasn't hard. Walking distance to whatever you want. The staff was friendly and knowledgable about things to see and places to go. So all in all, a good choice. Overall a great location and reasonably priced for NY. In fact I checked rates to return and the prices had nearly tripled. I'd definitely return for visit. I'm hoping the air snafu/kinks have been worked out. Definitely worth a stay.",4,2,3
19,Brooke M.,"Conshohocken, PA",220,126,99,3.0,11/16/2017,"I coordinated a day long conference at the RIU in NYC and would recommend this for others looking for meeting spaces in the city. The on-site coordinator who helped schedule our conference, Keith, was very friendly and answered emails within 24 hours. All of the conference rooms are located in the basement of the hotel and the downfall to this was that we heard the subway going by about once every 8 minutes. If you would like to have food, you have to cater through the hotel and you cannot have an outside vendor bring food in. The breakfast was great and they provided the usual  breakfast foods such as yogurt and bagels. The odd thing was that for the coffee bar, they did not have creamer, only hot milk. Our lunch was hosted in the Fashion restaurant and although I ordered from the lunch catering menu and expected to be eating as a group, it seemed we were eating from the same buffet as everyone else staying at the hotel. The food was average and offered a wide variety of desserts.The guests who attended our conference stayed at the hotel and had no complaints. They did say that the beds were firmer than most hotels but being a European chain, I assume that is the reason for this. Overall, the only downfall with booking a conference here was having to deal with their billing department located in Mexico. They did not set up a payment schedule and I normally received an email the day that payment was due asking me to pay the money by the end of the day. I do have to say the hotel is kept very clean and seems newer than a lot of hotels in the city. The hotel is located right next to Times Square so you do not get the noise of the area but are still able to walk to all the action within 5-10 minutes.",,,

Every hotel has minor problems, for us it was how long it took for the water to get warm in our shower. Everything else was beyond perfect. They allowed us to check in our bags before our room was ready, the location was perfect, the breakfast buffet had a large selection of items and was good for the price, and the hotel was very clean. The room was small but it was perfect. A single queen size room doesn't need to be huge for just one/two people. The view was great and requiring a key card for the electricity is smart. The hotel is well put together and I would recommend staying here.",,,
25,Joanna W.,"Arcadia, CA",165,18,5,4.0,12/14/2017,My husband and I came to Riu Hotel for our anniversary. I had a really good stay with this hotel. Check in was easy and we were greeted by a very friendly staff. The decoration of the hotel was so cute and modern looking. The room was a little smaller than I thought it would be. However the place was clean and we got a really nice view our the window since we are on the top floor. The blankets provided are very thin so we had to order a couple extra ones to keep warm at night. The hotel was nice enougu to give us complimentary breakfast everyday ! They even have a great happy hour with 7 dollar drinks. Yum!,2,,
26,Vlada R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",100,25,0,1.0,10/18/2017,"For $350+ per night, you expect something nicer then that. The only good thing to give  one star is location. Location is great, but there are a lot of good hotels around. This one has no dresser, no room to put your luggage, no any table or chairs to sit and do any work. Cheapest possible bed with cheapest possible mattress you sank in. I cannot even remember when I saw such a poor quality pillows, blanket, linen, towels. I felt like in a dorm with a corridor system where you can hear every word said outside of your door.WiFi is barely existent in the room.

30,Babbi G.,"San Jose, CA",73,75,123,5.0,4/27/2017,We stayed at the same hotel in Mexico and loved it. So we booked the same hotel in NYC for our 3rd anniversary and it was awesome. The NYC hotel was small but reminded me of Cancun Hotel which was much bigger. Ambience was nice. We were the  only floor to get a balcony and walk out to watch the view. So beautiful. Our Room was on the 25th Floor with a perfect view. I just didn't want to leave. Thank You Riu for a perfect stay once again. The only con was that there was a alarm going off for an hour from 1am to 2am and they kept telling us on the speaker to remain calm and to stay in our rooms. But mostly everyone was out of their rooms. So we didn't get a discount for that. But it's okay 240$ for a night wasn't bad. It was worth the stay. We loved times square,2,,
31,Desiree D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0,3.0,2/4/2018,"My husband and I, newly married, came here as our pre-honeymoon getaway. He's born and raised in Brooklyn, me in Manhattan so Times Square was just fun thing to do. Instantly walking into the lobby the space had a weird sweet smell, definitely a spray of some sort. At first I didn't mind but staying there for 3 days 2 nights I noticed that most of the hotel was more than likely cleaned with strong scented products or constantly had an oil plug in.. something perfume-esk and it became over whelming for me. With booking our room the perk of free breakfast came with our room, which I THOUGHT was gonna be awesome. It's a decent size buffet of fruits, yogurt, different pastries, 3 different kinds of eggs, waffles, pancakes, juice, coffee, lots of meats and options. I got some pineapple, Mellon, scrambled eggs, waffles, and apple juice. Fruit was OKAY at best, waffles cold, apple juice watered down a lot, eggs were disgusting. How someone can screw up scrambled eggs is beyond me. I honestly think they were bad eggs because I got an awful stomach bug a couple of hours after that breakfast. And our last night my husband held me as I was curled up in pain, stomach couldn't take anything. Truly a disappointment, ended up getting our meals else where after. The room itself was great, nice bathroom and shower, soft comfortable king size bed, a mini fridge and cable tv. It was cozy and great for me and my husband. Made our time together so comfortable. OVERALL, room was the best part which I guess for a hotel is what matters the most. Booked online for a decent price. Nasty breakfast is what causes the three stars. I would stay here again or recommend this place to a friend but make sure you mention to STAY AWAY FROM THEIR FOOD!",,,

Our room was on the highest the 30th floor which we requested and was ready a little after 12 ( mind you check in is at 3pm) our view of Times Square and the busy streets was also a plus ! Very friendly employees at the check in desk and hotel in general . We got complimentary breakfast for every morning of our trip which had a good variety to pick from and hot .

33,Nina N.,"Westminster, CA",305,41,15,1.0,2/25/2017,"I come to New York every year to visit family instead of doing the usual touristy stuff so of course I always stay with family, but this time I decided to take the boyfriend to show him my favorite city so we decided to stay in a hotel. I chose Riu because they had such raving reviews on booking.com; we were so disappointed!I'll start off with the price; we paid around 200 a night which I thought was reasonable for that area (walking distance to Times Square), but since this was a last minute trip I didn't have time to shop around for hotels. You can easily find hotels that are 10x better/bigger for the same price or a little cheaper. This room was one of the smallest rooms I have ever been to in my life, there was no room for you to walk, or even keep your luggage. If that part wasn't bad, there were cockroaches in our room; but I was nice and didn't complain because I just figured hey New York streets aren't the cleanest so whatever. But I really should have complained because they ended up charging us $250 for smoking in the room when all we did was light a candle (because the window was open and the smell of food from the carts was bothering me) there was no sign that said you couldn't light a candle, just no smoking (which we weren't by the way!).The service was terrible, everyone had the worst attitude here especially the guy who came and accused us of smoking! He came in like he was ready to fight; he could have been nicer about it. And this same guy told the front desk that we were smoking weed!!! I have never touched weed in my life! That's what we were charged with, smoking weed in the room. I even asked him to come into the room to look around to see if there was anything in here that I could be smoking, there wasn't! Avoid this hotel at all costs!",6,3,

Z 7.,"Nashville, TN",0,8,0,5.0,4/24/2017,"Was back in my hometown for birthday celebration this weekend and my wonderful Sister booked us a beautiful room at the RIU Times Square for two nights. It was very modern, very clean and quiet. The young guys working the luggage area in the lobby and Brian in Security awesome, super courteous and very helpful from the minute we arrived. Breakfast in the morning was included, very convenient, they even had decaf cappuccino!! Hotel was close to everything. All around great stay!!!Would also highly recommend Samba Kitchen on 9th Ave./46th for Brazilian brunch. Great food, live music and excellent caipiranhas (am not sure this is spelled right) but be sure to ask about them!!",2,,
35,Sandy R.,"Fort Myers, FL",33,285,395,4.0,11/14/2016,"Very chic, modern hotel near Times Square and Theater District.  Comfortable room.  I found it a little odd that the bathroom was enclosed in frosted glass, rather than solid wall and actual door, because, when turning on the bathroom light (if someone else is sleeping), the entire bedroom illuminates.   The frosted glass wall and frosted glass sliding door are cool and definitely look good, they're not so functional when trying to use bathroom in the middle of the night.My room was on 23rd floor, and sounds of horns and sirens from the traffic below were very audible even that many floors above the ground.  In the early morning hours, I heard lots of thumping and bumping either from the hall or other rooms.  Very nice hotel, but just pointing out a few things to be aware of.",,,
36,Mya T.,"Baltimore, MD",74,203,209,3.0,3/13/2017,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night as we came down for the weekend to see Wicked. The hotel itself is beautiful and modern. The room is very small, but hey it's NYC so what do you expect? The location is amazing as it's only a few blocks from tons of restaurants and Times Square. There are plenty of elevators and they are fast so that was a plus. The staff is helpful and attentive so no gripes there. I can't comment on the price because I scored a free night through a rewards program. I will say the hotel is lacking in amenities. They charge a ""resort/facility"" fee and I'm thinking ""for what? internet?"" Anyways, I only gave 3 stars because they could use an upgrade. Our room was scuffed up a ton and could use a new paint job and the furniture seemed very cheap...like cheap IKEA and poorly put together as everything seemed like it was about to fall off the wall (even the toilet!). I will also say I loved the rainfall shower and the almost see through shower wall... but maybe not good for families because of privacy. The bed was slightly uncomfortable (not really any support on the back) and the thermostat didn't budge at all. It was like the heat was set to hell. All in all I wouldn't stay here if I was planning to stay longer than a couple of nights.",2,,
37,Janet L.,"Orange County, CA",653,343,35,1.0,4/18/2016,"Yeah, it's new. It's so new that their AC doesn't work. The front desk girl lies to you about some New York AC law and how you can only open a window, which the manager sorta kinda confirms but says something else about the AC coming to installation at the end of April.  The lobby, on the other hand, has excellent AC btw. Oh, and don't bother checking in your luggage. We had a zipper open when we picked it up. When I mentioned it, all the manager said was ""was anything missing?""  Nothing was attempted to be remedied.  Definitely hanging up a do not disturb sign and locking up my stuff when I leave the room. I echo another Yelpers sentiment that Alia was excellent.  Despite the new-ness of Riu, the integrity of this hotel and employees definitely needs a revamp.",5,,
38,David M.,"Jamaica, NY",12,65,29,2.0,4/24/2016,"The hotel had a good appeal to it and the room size was okay (see the pics).  That's where the good ends. Not a good sign of customer service when your guest feel manipulated.  Was told my booking for the king size deluxe was over booked.  They offered an upgrade, how great (hear the sarcasm).  The ""upgrade"" was 2 full size beds.  How is that a upgrade for a married couple?  Went to complain and they gave us the king deluxe which was supposedly over booked.  This was after dealing with the long check-in process.I Arrived at 5p with 6 people waiting to check-in.  It took 30mins, way to long when you have 4 people working the front desk. The shower goes from hot to cold every 5 seconds.  If you put it all the way hot,  this still happens.  Kind of annoying when you want to enjoy a hot shower. I guess the price your paying is for the location,  not the service and room.",4,1,

I freaking simply requested my folio after staying there because I needed to turn it in for business and they acted as if they could not pull it up nor was I able to speak with a manger.In addition although the lobby is beautiful the room was dirty and disgusting. You could see anyone taking a shower or using the bathroom through the door. Simply not a ""fresh, clean or comfortable"" room as I expected. I would NOT recommend staying at this hotel.",2,,
40,D L.,"San Francisco, CA",270,158,39,5.0,3/31/2016,"**ALERT - NEW NEW NEW** I have only stayed in a Riu property while visiting Cabo, Mexico late last year which was a pleasant experience. Found this place on the whim while scanning trip advisor and found it pleasantly affordable and just a block away from Time Square. The place is brand spanking new and you can still smell the wet paint unfortunately. Not all rooms are prepared but I'm still in love with the decor and set up of this hotel. The room is pleasantly decent at about 190 square foot but comfortable enough for a couple to stay in. They don't currently have upgrades but compared to other hotels the size is reasonable. The front desk lady Alia who happens to be from Munich, Germany is a sweetheart and did her best accommodate me for a early check in due to my exhaust from a early morning flight. Having employees like her will keep this place feeling great. Overall a pleasant experience, just waiting to see how the gym and restaurant turn out. I still will give 5 stars for their sincerity, willingness to accommodate, the building location, and the overall taste in decor of the place. Don't let me down, this is my second time in NY.",4,,
41,Sheryl H.,"Northbrook, IL",0,6,0,1.0,7/29/2017,"Do not use this hotel if you want to use the internet and work remotely.  The only thing that gets me to write a poor review about a hotel is when I go to an expensive hotel and can't use the internet.  I am a professional and expect to be able to work remotely on trips (especially this one as it was a business trip to AAD meeting).  Four different days on our five day trip, I could not go on the internet as it said we already had four devices on the wifi.  We had four people using our room but each time not all of them were using wifi.  Regardless, at this price, they should not limit our internet use.  (I was paying for two other rooms at the same time for family.)Adding to my previous review:  Three different times during my stay, I complained and was told a manager would talk to me.  A manager never did.  After that, I emailed the hotel.  It was very difficult to find contact info.  After sending my email, I received an email saying I had reached the parent company and would have to contact the individual hotel (which I had done to no avail).  So I can add to my complaint above by saying they don't care.",3,,
42,Sonya N.,"Chicago, IL",4,5,0,1.0,2/18/2018,"Upon arrival I was fooled into thinking I found a gem hotel in NY Times Square but it turns out this hotel is a piece of crap like so many other Time Square locations. The good part is this hotel is fairly new so it looks very good on the outside as well as the inside decor. It is also in walking distance of Times Square with access to some of NY's greatest attractions right at your fingertips. My compliments STOP there. What I thought would be a relaxing adventure turned into to a NIGHTMARE courtesy of RIU Plaza Hotel. I'll start with the hallway foul odor by my room door (825)but I gave it a pass thinking... Meh... Maybe they need to clean and deodorize it was early so now worries. Incident # 2: I was in the midst of a shower and suddenly brown water started coming out the shower head, then debris, them muddy water!! Same from the sink, then the toilet!! I was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! I called front desk and they informed me maintenance were working on the issue and that's it! They then proceeded to cancel breakfast for the remaining stay due to bad water, meaning no water, no ice, no bar etc. I videotaped it for evidence and hopefully can post the pictures. That's not it! About 4am the next day a false alarm occurred setting off the alarm system and panic through out the entire hotel. Being in a high rise in Times Square NY and the emergency alarm being activated at 4am, waking you out of your sleep is scary enough to cause a heart attack! No apologies from front desk. I conclude with my checkout compensation for the inconvenience, They said hey we gave you $25pp for the breakfast we canceled but you still owe for the resort fee! With what I encountered I expected more and when I book a 4Star Hotel that's what I expect. Give me a resort experience and I will pay you for it. If I wanted to stay in a slum hotel I would have booked a slum hotel. I definitely plan to spread the word to others expecting 4Star services!! Things happen, however your Customer Services and courtesy makes all the difference!!",1,,

The breakfast is non-existent.  They put out some stale bread and a few fruit cups.The coffee they have is decaf !  Thats right Breakfast decaf !  The Holiday Inn Expresshas better breakfast than this place.  Don't count on eating in the cost of your room.

45,Jennifer C.,"Orlando, FL",136,16,0,1.0,2/1/2018,"HORRIBLE! Not sure how the positive reviews got onto this hotel. After checking in, we got to our room only to find that it was 81 degrees. Thermostat didn't work. We called downstairs 3 times. The first two times, we were hung up on. The third time, we were told someone would come up and check the thermostat. No one ever did. So we gathered all our things (mind you, it's 11pm now after a long day of travel) and went back down and found out that despite the website information and even the binder in-room, they do NOT have air conditioning. We were stuck with the heavy amounts of heat from the radiator instead of being able to comfortably control the temperature in our room. We got no apologies or solution from the front desk - who couldn't have cared less. One of them even asked if we can ""turned the thermostat down."" Really? Of course we did and why would it matter if you've just told us there's no AC anyhow. We got to our new room which was a balmy 75 and had to leave the windows open to get it to cool down. In Times Square. Which meant, the noise was so loud we couldn't sleep. So, for a hotel that advertises that it has AC & heat, we had to make the uncomfortable choice of either window noise or crazy heat. Additionally, in BOTH rooms - the beds were hardly made. The sheets were just haphazardly draped on the bed - not tucked in at all. There's no pillow top - you can see the indents of the mattress under the thin, rough sheet. BOTH rooms had hair/grime on the sheets. Every morning, you'll be delightfully woken up by the sound of SLAMMING doors. There's no carpet and no mechanism to prevent the doors from loudly slamming and then echo'ing down the small, narrow hallways. So good luck - if you were able to sleep in the room's temperatures and with the terrible bedding, you'll be woken up by the first person to leave your hallway for the morning. Oh, and by the way. When you DO wake up and want to leave - be advise. The elevators were broken. We schlepped down 11 floors in the stairwell. When we got to the bottom, the front desk just said ""Yeah, we know. "" No apology, no ETA. Just that they knew it was broken.  Once you DO get to the lobby, enjoy having heavy amounts of cologne drifting through the air - to the point that you can barely breathe. This is NOT a nice hotel to stay at. We picked it due to the reviews and rate but had we gotten there early enough to cancel and move hotels, we definitely would have. If it was possible to give it less than 1-star, I would have.",1,,

Once it was clear this was not a 4 star hotel I was on the phone for 90 minutes with Priceline and the hotel, to no avail. The only option given me was to sleep there 1 night then see if the manager would give me a refund the next day for the remaining nights only.

52,Elaine D.,"Duluth, GA",34,35,13,1.0,10/31/2017,"This is a review  for all Riu Hotels & ResortsToday I have had it with Riu.com hotels. (riu.com/en/home.jsp)  I made a reservation for Thanksgiving weekend in Paradise island Bahamas because the resort was all inclusive, no children, restaurants looked good and it sounded relaxing. We had already been to Atlantis and thought we'd try this.Once I made the reservation I then went online to make the airline reservations, but couldn't get a flight back. A couple days later I tried again to get a flight and couldn't and had to call to cancel. A gentleman answered and I explained the situation and asked to change it to March. I also told him I was to get an e-mail where I would be be able to logon to their site to do a password as I had already gotten an account number. When I got the e-mail for the password and logged on, it was in a different language than English. He said I will send it again to you now and it also came in a different language, he did this a couple times and he seemed annoyed and said to me, ""there must be a glitch in the system you will have to wait a week or so and call back"". I told him that I was the customer and I shouldn't have to be put through that and found it odd that someone couldn't get me into the system. He didn't seem to care so he went on to booking my vacation in March, gave me the price and then confirmed my e-mail to send me the confirmation of my reservation.I never got the reservation confirmation, I called asking about the reservation and a man answered and said he couldn't locate it as he needed a confirmation number. I explained to him I didn't get one as it was supposed to be e-mailed to me. I asked if he could look it up in March and he said he could not. I hung up frustrated. I called back a day later and spoke to women who gave me an e-mail address to write to and they could help me. Before I e-mailed I actually called Paradise Island in the Bahamas and spoke to a supervisor who said let me see what I can do and will call you back shortly. She never called back so I had to call again several hours later and spoke to her manager and she was very apologetic and said they can't see reservations ahead only the day of (I find that very strange). I then did the e-mail and the reply was I had to fill in a form (I couldn't believe it) all I wanted to do was find out if the reservation was made for March.Today, I filled in the form, but was angry I had to go through all this and after sending it I called Riu again and spoke to nice women.  She needed any type of number from me and I told her I could only give the account number and reservation number I had from my original reservation for Thanksgiving that was cancelled and she said that was fine. She then told me it was never cancelled; I was appalled. She then cancelled it for me and asked for my credit card number to look up my March reservation, she found out that it was never made. I explained to her the man gave me the price and confirmed my e-mail to send the confirmation to.This Riu Hotel is the worst run hotel I have ever had to deal with and I needed to let others know how poor their customer service is. I should have been more aware when they only take Visa or MasterCard and not American Express.  I wasted so much time with a poorly run and managed hotel!I feel why go to their hotel if before I get there the customer service is so bad how could the hotel and their customer service be any better.",2,,

Can I mention how the AC was never working and the only thing available was heat?!! This is APRIL people! Come on! The shower leaked every single time we used it, I called downstairs to inform them and no one ever came up. What kind of customer service are you establishing at a brand new hotel? What a horrible way to start off. The staff was incompetent unless it involved them ""checking"" our hotel keys every time we came in and out. Oh but wait, it gets better...they picked and chose who they checked because all of the caucasian people never got checked. I watched it with my own eyes! Ridiculous, right?

I noticed when I pushed cool, it blew out warm air.I called the front desk and they said they'll send a technician. The guy came, was puzzled, turned it off, opened my window to cool the room off and he said he'll check on it.A few moments later, I get called from the front desk asking if the problem was fixed. I told them the technician was supposed to follow up. And they asked me to check now. So I checked and still didn't work. They said okay we'll send him again. A few moments pass and nothing. I had to leave so I went down to the front desk and said nobody has came but they are more than welcome to go inside the room and fix it.A few hours later I come back, I go straight to front desk and they said there was no issue reported. And that if I was gone, they wouldn't go in my room to fix it. So I told them I ALLOWED it but I'll check the AC right now.I go to my room and STILL didn't work. I got sorta irked so I called again and they said they'll send a technician. A few minutes later, they call again and said that nobody answered the door. I told them BECAUASE NOBODY KNOCKED? How am I suppose to know if someone is at the door without any sign? And the guy replies ""oh I'm so sorry I'll send him up again."" Another few moments later and I get a call saying that the technician is there and open the door. Like omg KNOCK??? So the guy comes in, I explain the situation and he says ""oh. We don't have AC during cold season."" Are you kidding me? Why did 6 other employees not know this either? This is beyond poor.Not to mention, the shower isnt very sealed.

In addition, she refused to refund us the $50 parking fee and did not attempt to rectify the situation. The poor doorman and security officer kept apologizing and trying to find out where our car was, but the manager did nothing. Perhaps the RIU has the wrong people in its management positions. I travel a lot and oversee a lot of work travel. I will not be staying at a RIU hotel again and will remove them from our company's preferred vendor list. Terrible, terrible experience.

Our first impression was: wow, such a modern-looking hotel! The lobby was beautiful; everything looked very elegant and clean. But of course, it's not all about the appearance of the hotel...After we checked in, the bellboy took our luggages on the cart and left in this corner of the hotel where we saw other luggages there as well. We went up to our hotel room, and wow was it a lot smaller than we expected. We had a total of 6 people, 4 adults and 2 children, so the room we got was very small and cramped. Two of the beds (full size) were ""combined"" and it was a struggle for some of us to sleep on it (others slept on the couch that turned into a bed). Also, what was AWFUL was how the bathroom was SHEER and almost SEE-THROUGH! Although it was very beautiful and modern, the bathroom wasn't exactly private and my family and I had to put up blankets to cover the sheer glass of the shower and the door of the bathroom. But I'll admit, the color scheme and the design of the room was very cute...although I would recommend this room or hotel in general for couples instead of big families. So, back to the luggage! The man told us he would bring our luggage up immediately; 40-45 minutes later, nothing. I went downstairs to see if it was still there or if someone had brought it up, and guess what? IT WAS STILL JUST SITTING THERE ON THE CART AND NO ONE DOING ANYTHING WITH IT. So of course I had to tell them to bring it up...again. This time, it took them 20 minutes to bring it up, a new record! Oh and also, the window was...different than all the other hotels we've been to. It opened from the bottom and you could basically drop anything down there. We were on the 14th floor and I swear my little brother could have easily stuck his legs through the and either get stuck or fall and die. NEVER opened the window...kept it shut tight the whole time there. At least put a net, sheesh! Another thing: the food at the cafe was expensive...a small sandwich for $9?! Everything was overpriced in that place! Got two small sandwiches (size of my palm at least), two croissants (palm size again), and two kids' size milk for $30...in my opinion, very expensive. But, the restaurant across from the cafe that was apart of the hotel was delicious.So basically, I gave this hotel 2 stars because of the awful and inconsistent staff, the super small room, the sheer bathroom, the fact that they don't have an ice machine, and the overpriced cafe. Would come here again I guess, if it was just my boyfriend and me.",2,,
60,Kati K.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",28,15,24,4.0,4/28/2016,"My friend and I stayed here for two nights on business this week. We are low maintenance travelers, and our room was expensed, so this review reflects that. Pros:*Location location location! One mile from Central Park, one block from theatre district, lots of cool little bars right next door on 46th *Easy access to E train from JFK*Pretty decór in lobby and room *Room window opens *Good sized room for NYC*Friendly staff Cons: *The shower leaks, bad. The water leaks through the shower door crevasse, so the first time we showered there was a huge puddle running from the shower to the front door. Good thing is though, the bath towels are extra big and fluffy so we left towels on the floor the whole time. *Everyone mentions the AC. I think the issue is the fan works but it doesn't get really chilled. It rained while we were there though so we didn't need it to be too cold in the room, and if it got too warm we just left the window open.*No late checkout. This would have been appreciated. We didn't complain about any of the issues we just rode it off as hotel quirks and adjusted to our surroundings. Comfortable, clean room in a great location is priority anyway. I do hope they get these issues settle out for their sake though, they have great potential for success once these things get sorted out.",2,1,

No breakfast included, staff are not very friendly nor accommodating very overpriced and doesn't include anything with the stay. We were put here out of sheer fault to our travel advisor over New Year's Eve with hope of the ball drop that was not the case, this hotel has no view of the ball drop nor do they do anything for New Year's Eve. Luckily enough we found the Casablanca which helped us have an amazing New Year's Eve experience I highly recommend that hotel we received 5 star experience with the New Year's Eve VIP rooftop party fantastic view of the ball drop at their location. With purchasing a ticket to the party we had to be guest so it required us to stay minimum 2 nights at Casablanca, we tried to explain our situation and the mistake our travel advisor had made with the hope to get at least 50% refund on 2 nights with the RIU, they were not compassionate at all and did not offer this to us. The RIU doesn't even do in room service so on our last night that we wanted to just chill and stay in because we had a 4am pick up for the airport the next day we were forced to go eat out.

I had left my 'clean my room' tag on my door numerous times and never had it been cleaned the 6 nights I was there. One day I came back to room and the maid was standing outside my door on her phone. The concierge was not helpful in any situation. I had packages delivered to me during my stay and they didn't notify me once they came - couldn't even find a couple of them even though they clearly had my name written on them. Also, sticking out from under my king sized bed (2 beds pushed together) was a plastic tag that scratched my foot every time I walked by it. Not a good experience.

I am staying here starting tomorrow and will be away from my 8 month old baby. I need to pump and store my breastmilk frozen (since I will be away for 5 days). This has never been an issue at any of the other hotels I've stayed at. Either they have let me store the milk labelled in a bag in their kitchen freezer or they have made sure my room comes with a mini fridge with a freezer compartment. This is not a light matter as it concerns the well-being of my baby, and being away from him is hard enough already. I spoke with several agents, and all of them basically said ""No, we cannot accomodate this"" with no further explanation. I even tried emailing the manager as she was continually not available to speak to me all day. Her response: ""I am very sorry to let you know that our policy prohibits the storage of guest items (what ever it is) in our Kitchen."" This shows that they do not put customer service at their forefront. Any hotel that is not friendly to new and breastfeeding moms is a No go in my books. I also tried to call their 1-800 customer relations number for the RIU company itself - also no help. If this is the type of customer service Im encountering even BEFORE I leave, I can't even imagine what it'll be like when I arrive.",,2,

I can just imagine someone traveling with someone besides their significant other needing to asked them to step outside! Awkward.If you walk barefoot on the floor in the room, your feet will be black with dirt. We had to wash our feet before we went out! Everything else looked clean. The bed was decently comfortable and the size of the room was adequate (2 Queens and 1 pull out sofa). We were 6 people and it was fine for one night.The only nice employee we interacted with was the cleaning lady. Concierge never picked up the phone, and since there is no bucket or ice machine, the front desk said we had to go downstairs to the bar to get the ice ourselves. They gave us one bucket and said ""people never return the buckets so we can't give you two. You can dump the ice in a bag upstairs and come back downstairs if you want more."" they also don't have an coffee machine and you have to go down to the cafe to get the coffee, which is bad news if you're hungover! The fact that they charge a ""resort fee"" (which apparently covers the gym, business center and 2 bottles of water we never got or used) and they dony give the basics like ice or water or even decline in a polite way is just silly. The only thing they actually brought up to us was... well, we asked for another pillow since they gave us 5 pillows for a reservation for 6 and they brought us sheets. Then we said no, we asked for a pillow and the guy brings us a pillow without a case. We had to laugh because we are all travelers and this place is just so weird. If they were at least polite and didn't tell us to ""move out of the way"" when we were waiting on line, we could look past some of the quirks, but they don't seem concerned with making their guests happy by providing simple amenities that don't cost them more than a few pennies.

The rooms are on the smaller side so I wouldn't recommend going with anything more than 2-3 people. The hotel is close to attractions, Broadway, and subway. Check in was quick, as was checkout. They offer a 46 dollar overnight valet which is actually a good price considering some garages charge that just for a few hours. However, because there is no ATM in the hotel we weren't able to tip the valet guy. They told us we would have to walk to the nearest Duane Reade. However, all in all we enjoyed our quick stay and would stay again. *** The price on the Riu website is cheaper than Orbitz so I called Orbitz for a price match, and received a $50 credit for another orbitz booking ***",5,1,1

We called months ahead, spoke with managers, had in writing we could get adjoining rooms and if available, we could do a 12 o'clock check in. We confirmed this a few days before as well. When we arrived, the girl at the front desk check in was BEYOND rude and apparently knew only how to say check in is at 3 and kept repeating that no matter what we said to her. We asked repeatedly to speak to the manager or supervisor, was told the supervisor was checking the rooms to see if they were cleaned. Then we were told they were clean but check in was at 3. The front desk staff was incredibly rude over and over. When we finally were allowed up to the room, they were not adjoining. I called a supervisor and was told they didn't have adjoining rooms for the amount of girls we had, which would have been nice to know prior to booking months ago for the sole purpose of us wanting to have adjoining rooms. The rooms aren't functional at all. Not enough outlets.... no ice machine on our floor, the management staff and front desk was HORRIBLE. Will never visit this hotel again nor recommend it.",1,1,

Wi-Fi maybe but I can just use data thanks. A billion degrees and no way to cool the room down. The fire alarm went off at 1130 pm, then they announced false alarm in English. Then in Spanish.

I'd have no problem waiting but it seemed like every person on a computer needed a manager, because no one knew what they were doing. Completely unorganized. Housekeeping never came to my room during my stay. I called front desk to see if they can bring someone in when I'm out and they said they will. Still came back to a room unfinished. Last thing that completely reassured me how horrible this place is, was the elevator was not working! I was on the 30th floor and I had to walk down 30 flights of stairs to go to the store. When I got back to the hotel after the store I told front desk and they said they were doing some service on the elevator, and that none were working so I'd have to take the freight elevator to the 28th floor and then walk up the stairs to the 30th floor Seriously?! They had at least 9 different elevators and all of them weren't working? Super unreliable place. Word of advice- make sure everything is running smoothly before taking people's money.

76,Alan W.,"San Francisco, CA",454,73,8,1.0,4/6/2016,"This hotel is FAR from its self-proclaimed high rating. Stayed at this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights, but not once did the A/C or heater work. The front desk told me every time that ""an engineer is working on it"" but I highly doubt that ANYONE was looking into the matter. I even check the morning that I was leaving the hotel to see if front desk would say anything different and as expected, I received the same lie. On day 2, it was actually 84F in the room so after complaining to the front desk and manager, they put us into another room 3 floors above but with the exact same problem - no A/C or heater. Also, as a self-proclaimed 4-star hotel, it's usually expected that you have glassware in the room rather than paper cups. However, I was fine with that thinking I can easily call guest services to bring up two glasses. I was ACTUALLY told that ""you can come to lobby to get more cups"" and ""sorry, we don't deliver items to rooms."" In addition, valet guy outside tries to sell you on taking the hotel flat fee SUV rather than hailing a cab. To go 4 blocks, they actually tried to charge my girlfriend $25+, and even after I put my girlfriend into a cab myself, the valet guy still tried to encourage me to use their flat-fee SUV. Thus, this has easily been worst NYC hotel experience and HIGHLY DISCOURAGE anyone from going to this hotel.",3,2,

This hotel isn't worth the original $300+ price at all. Maybe only for the fact that you're staying in Times Square. Other than that, not worth that price.

The only problems for us were no coffee in the room, no bathtub and most importantly, the room was really tiny. I had read reviews before I booked and knew the room would be small, but still we were kind of shocked when we walked in the first time. We were not in the room a lot, but it was kind of a deal breaker for us.

Check in was a breeze and woman who helped us was friendly. She asked if I wanted a high floor and I was granted a room on the 25th floor. The room is SMALL! Really nice view however and very clean. And like other reviews the AC was working but very minimal. We did have a maintenance guy come and show us that it was because the room wasnt on auto cool.

But it was because it was a BRAND SPANKING NEW hotel in the middle of all the action!  Just opened on March 25 2016- their soft opening.  So lucky to have found this place at such a great price! It's in Hell's Kitchen and located on 46th and 8th Ave. Such an awesome, awesome location!  It's so new that they haven't even opened all the rooms yet or parts of hotel ie restaurant etc. Everything is still so clean! No gross stuff that you may find in a lot of the hotels in Manhattan. We loved it. The room and bathroom were very spacious for a New York hotel. The floors are gray wood and has an art deco theme. We loved that it was so close to everything.  The door men, bellhops, concierge and front desk were all nice. It was pretty inexpensive considering NYC hotel rates.

I have stayed at the Riu in the Caribbean and it was great. I assumed it would be the same! I was totally wrong. I called the hotel early May to see if they were open because they had not opened yet at time of booking. The phone rang and rang and then just hung up on me. After 5 attempts someone answered. Yes they were open. The day before our stay I called to ask a question and same experience. No one answered and it took me about 5 attempts trying differed extensions. Again the phone would just ring them hang up on me. So we arrive on May 14. The hotel was nice and clean but not like the photos on the website. The photos were either from a different hotel or photo shopped. The room was small and screamed IKEA. No problem if that was it I would not be wasting my time on a review. The temp was set at 69 and cold air was blowing. We set it to 73 but nothing changed. We tried over and over and set it to 80 but no change. They don't tell u that the rooms are set so that u can't manipulate the temperate!! There were no blankets on the beds. There was something over the mattress that was a bit thicker than a sheet. So dah!! we were cold. I called and asked for someone to show us how to adjust the temp because at this point we had not realized that it could not be changed. I also asked for 2 pillows and 3 blankets. There was a sleep sofa but no pillows or blankets!! After half an hour I called again and repeated my request, another half and hour goes by and nothing! I went to the lobby and asked and was told someone will be sent. More waiting and a woman brings 3 blankets and 1 pillow with no pillow case! Fine so I go down again and ask again for someone to come adjust the temperature and one more pillow. They again tell me to go back to the room, this time I insisted I wait until someone got me a pillow and sent someone to adjust the temperature. They gave me a pillow ( no pillow case but by this point I didn't care). A nice technician came up and informed us that we had 2 options. Turn off the AC or keep it as is, there was nothing between off and 69 degrees. So we asked him to turn it off. I understand that it's a new hotel and there are kinks to be ironed out. But the concept of '' HOLD ON WHILE I GIVE A CRAP'' displayed by consumer service was taken to whole new level. Only one woman named Karen seemed to really care about customers complained, ( I was not the only one who came down to verbally request things because the phone calls were ignored) everyone else had an I don't give a crap attitude). I could have stayed at the W for $100 less and had a much better experience but lesson learned. Never again!!",2,,

First of all, this hotel seems luxurious (and you do pay the price for a luxury hotel) so it's natural to expect that you will have a good stay and that management would be be professional. We visited New York back in October 2016 and stayed here. From the moment we arrived, it took us forever to check in - it seems like the front desk was under-staffed for the number of people that were checking in at the time - which I found to be quite unprofessional. Guests are required to make reservations ahead of time, so why can't management take this information and use it accordingly when figuring out staffing scheduling? Also, we arrived a couple hours after check-in time, but our room was not even ready yet. Once we entered our room we sat on the bed only to find out that it was literally broken! The springs on one side of the bed had given in. So naturally, we requested another room, which required more waiting time on our end, which took away from our allocated time for sightseeing (we only were staying for a long weekend, so time was valuable to us). During our stay, a staff member literally just walked into our room without even knocking! And this person was not house keeping nor had we even requested assistance with anything. A person (who was clearly not a guest) with a key card just walked right in. We reported this at the front desk and were told that they would look into it. But throughout our stay we notice at least once on our floor a staff member entering a different room on our floor with a key card and that staffer was not housekeeping. I've never seen that before at any other hotel and I find it to be rather sketchy. If you do stay at this hotel, be sure to take your valuables with you!On our last night, the fire alarm went on! What really bothered us was someone just walking into our room without even knocking - that's an invasion of privacy! We brought up our concerns with management once again at check out and to be honest they did not seem to really care (perhaps management has its staffer do this, but they did not claim that it's normal) - all they did was give us a small piece of chocolate and I mean thinking back on it know I can't help but to chuckle! Who knew that a piece of chocolate can resolve an issue? There are plenty of other hotels in NYC - and honestly this hotel is too close to chaos of Times Square.

91,Faa A.,"McLean, VA",0,1,0,1.0,8/14/2016,"This is my very first yelp review. I was so so disappointed that I thing its time to review the hotel. So the hotel is clean and pretty. Very close to time square but thats about it. Here is my experience: - I booked through hotwire and checked in. I asked at check in if I could upgrade to a 2 full beds or king bed and they said I could do so by coming at the front desk anytime.- Around 11 pm I call reservations requesting for an upgrade or an extra room if upgrade option isnt available. First off- the guy i spoke to had no clue what was going on. I was in room 2525, he spent 5 minutes arguing that i already have a king bed after which he checked the system to confirm the size as queen. Also after around 20 minutes of going back and forth in his system and telling me he didnt have any room available he finally agreed that he had couple of rooms with king beds and i could come to front desk anytime to get it- i came to the front desk at 11.30 pm. Manager named LOUIS was there. I Have stayed in over a 1000 hotels in my lifetime, i am yet to meet as rude a person as him responsible for greeting and checking in clients on the front desk. I repeated my conversation with reservations and asked for an upgrade. He said he had nothing available. I said reservation confirmed that he has rooms what happened in 20 minutes as I just spoke to someone. He said i spoke to some one who has left and the shift has changed. They arent giving rooms any more. He cant do anything at all , his system is closed and he his doing the nightly audit. I asked if I can request for an extra room i dont mind paying as i had some friends joining me and we need extra space.He said he cant do anything and that i come back at 8 am to request for a room . His tone was extremely rude. He even told me to go book a hotel across the street and leave this property! Also he told me that I am not in my right state and that i need to go away and stand in the corner. Can you just believe that? I almost was spellbound and teary eyed! I had never in my life been spoken to like this by a hospitality specialist!- lastly half of my makeup got stolen after house keeping. Also if you call or request anything from front desk they say theyd call back but in real they never do it. This hotel has no customer service concept. I wish i could actually report this issue to the highest authority at their corporate office as this is simply unacceptable",3,1,
92,Robert G.,"Hemet, CA",67,15,19,1.0,3/31/2016,"So far not a good experience , yes the hotel is new, it's clean , however , very unorganized . Only been open for 4 days . I feel they rushed the opening of the hotel. The front desk personnel seemed confused on checking in people. Lack of training I think. The rooms are very small, I did have 4 people with two double beds and the room lacked space to put clothes and things on, another nightstand would have been nice. The bathroom had no shelves to put things on. To top off, the air condition didn't work. On the third day of having no AC , not only did i over hear earlier in the morning of a guy complaining of no AC , I went down at 1130 that night because my room was at 80 degrees, having the AC on all day set at 50. Front desk said that there technician was working on it, haha, for three days now??? Being a hvac tech myself , I should work my way into a job and fix myself. Further more, the rooms have no coffee makers , and going down Stairs they did have a thermos type already brewed coffee, water and orange juice.",2,1,
93,Michelle E.,"Westchester County, NY",1,180,212,2.0,5/1/2016,"I was excited when we walked in and saw the new, lush building.  Meh, that's where it ended.  Check-in and check-out lines are ridiculously long, even with 5 people working the counters. Next, the rooms and structure have great potential, however... All white in a hotel doesn't make sense.  The walls already looked like the hotel has been open for months, even though it is only open a few weeks.  The room, at first sight, is very appealing.  There are faux wood floors, modern bathroom design.  But there are so many flaws.  First is the bathroom box is basically in the bedroom, with lots of open crevices.  This gives the person the bathroom very little privacy.  Next, there are no clocks, making it hard to figure out what time of night it is... because trust me you WILL be up all night.  We were on the 18th floor and all we heard were doors slamming from halls, ambulances from the street, and LOUD LOUD LOUD music all night until about 4 a.m. We called the front desk, begging for another room, anywhere else not facing the street, but I was told they were filled to maximum capacity.  The one plus were the elevators that were very quick, but the paper thin walls and windows did nothing to prevent the noises that Times Square produces on a Saturday night. This was not our first time in the area, but we surely wouldn't be able to justify another night at this hotel's full price in the future.  Also, they should consider a night light or something softer so that if you need to get up in the middle of the night, the room doesn't look like a photo cube to do so.  You'll know what I mean if you experience it.  Lastly, why isn't there a quicker key drop for check out? Doesn't make sense to wait on line again.  Unless the night here is free and you don't mind being up, consider elsewhere.",,1,
94,Anira M.,"Monterey, CA",0,26,11,1.0,3/26/2017,"Whoever washes their sheets does a terrible job. Everyone knows the duvet and throw blankets/pillows hotels have are dirty. But the sheets should be clean because they have to bleach them right? Not here. Sheets and pillow cases had hair, dirt, and lipstick on them so we called down and ask for them to be changed. An hour and 30mins later (after having to go downstairs and ask them twice for them to be changed so we can sleep) a maid comes in with a bunch of sheets so she can change ours. After removing the dirty sheets she starts to put a ""clean"" one on and stops because whoops there is a stain, she then tries another one and ""oops"" that ones dirty too. She did this four times before finally putting one on and grabs a lint brush so she can take any hair that's in the sheet off. She then begins to make the bed with the same dirty duvet and throw blanket that goes in between them. Also throws the throw pillow on top as well and moves on the the next bed (we had twins). The throw blanket and throw pillow are made out of the kind of material that hair and stuff will stick to, and they obviously don't clean those so idk what she expected to happen when she put them on the bed, but they left hair on the sheets she just made the bed with, and she pulled out the lint roller again. A guy came outside to pick up all the dirty sheets and looked angry, I'm assuming he was her boss, but not all of this was her fault, it all comes back to management. It shouldn't have taken that long to have someone come up to the room with sheets, and it's honestly pretty embarrassing for the hotel that their ""clean"" sheets are so dirty. Never staying at an RIU hotel again.",,,
95,Mike M.,"West Hartford, CT",0,49,6,5.0,6/19/2016,"I think the hotel had many problems in its opening which made it gain many unfavorable reviews. They have worked most all of them out, and we had a fine experience. The air conditioner and all fixtures and appliances worked flawlessly; I had the room to a cool 68 degrees when it was 85 outside within 5 minutes. The shower wall is NOT sheer. You cannot see anyone through it. The front desk checked us in early and quickly, held bags free of charge after check out, and retrieved them promptly. Would stay again at the price I booked it for.",,,
