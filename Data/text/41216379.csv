0,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",362,209,333,4.0,11/2/2018,"I've been here multiple times and I've had a great time each time.The only thing I would tell you is that,1. It gets VERY packed, so if you don't like tight spaces and a lot of people, this might not be for you.2. Their air conditioning (not even sure if they have one) isn't good at all, so it gets quite warm in here.That being said, the club is great, the comedy show is great, the vibes are happy, the staff is funny and friendly and Alan Cumming is AWESOME!",1,,1
1,Edward G.,"Denver, CO",41,58,45,4.0,10/28/2018,"New York is full of hyper-famous spots  like the Statue of Liberty and very famous ones like the Rainbow Room. They are must-dos. Club Cumming falls into a different category but not for lack of atmosphere. Drawn by the reviews and staying in the neighborhood, we were puzzled by the handsome shirtless man on stage standing still when we entered. It was minutes later before we realized we were at ""Drink & Draw"", one of the club's signature whacky -- and a little dirty --events. It was a warm-up on a Sunday night to the Dumpster Divers Taylor Swift show. It was party tribute and part parody. Club Cumming will not be to everyone's taste but I think it has found a niche and maybe a place in NYC frame.",,,
2,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,4.0,7/20/2018,"Club Cumming is a great bar and performance space in the East Village! The name ""Cumming"" comes from the fact that actor Alan Cumming is one of the bar owners. If you were formerly a patron of Eastern Bloc, this club is in the same spot--and it pretty much looks the same inside as it did before.If you haven't yet hit this place up, note that it's kinda tiny inside. So, if you are hitting up a show there, get to the event early.",6,2,7
3,Marissa Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",862,1258,2025,4.0,6/4/2018,I never would've known about this place if it wasn't for my friends that were already there apparently this place is owned by Alan CummingAnd formally owned by Anderson CooperI came in on a Friday night and we had a few beers and we were listening to 80s music which was cool I don't know what the prices were but people were having a good time I didn't get to see the whole thing as we were in the front the entire time not a bad spot at all and just around the corner is the pyramid!,1,1,1
4,Nancy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",863,133,204,5.0,1/29/2018,"Alan Cumming is my personal jesus so perhaps it's worth inserting a disclaimer that for that reason, I can't be totally objective here. I've been meaning to come here for quite some time and finally FINALLY managed to a couple weeks ago. It's smaller than I had anticipated, but still has all the character I expected. Chandeliers, leather banquets, moody red lighting, and of course a glorious neon sign hanging over the stage.The night I stopped by there was a comedy show happening and I got to see a wonderful burgeoning comedian Sydnee Washington. Have you ever had your night ruined by by comedy sets? Well this was the opposite of that. Definitely will be cumming here again soon!",3,1,1
5,Kate S.,"Portland, OR",45,267,52,5.0,6/10/2018,"This club is going to save lives.I've been following the news of Club Cumming since the announcement of its inception, through the weeks of community board drama, until I could finally pop out for a spin this weekend. Alan Cumming is one of the few people I know of who is very proudly pro-nightlife and his expertise is on full display. NYC haunts can be heavy on one element only, whether it's smoke machine or bass or liquor or warm bodies crammed in like sardines. For a small space at Cumming, it all feels well balanced. I was at a packed event tonight, but there was still an open path to get to the loo, instead of having to resort to the usual ""find an opening in the crowd, turn sideways, and shove your way through."" It feels like New York doesn't quite know what's taken up residence in this space and they're sleeping on a treasure. To see a legend of theater like Alan Cumming emcee a Tonys party with trivia, panel show games, sing-a-longs, musical guests, and still take time to personally distribute prizes to every single person in the club, feels like an invitation only event like getting an Amex Black Card or an OBE. You don't do all that work unless you're passionate about putting on a show and making people feel welcome. There is an excellent crew running the show, the drinks are generous, and the gorgeous Weimar style murals by Grant Shaffer, Alan's lovely husband, are the centerpiece for the club's cabaret influence.When Club Cumming was announced, the mission was to create a queer friendly space if you needed somewhere to go, and to bring back the intimate venues of the 1990s. I was the shy wallflower on Friday night until someone came over to pull me out of my shell, and Sunday I was chatting with someone new to the city who was feeling just as shy as I had been two days prior. People are going to come out of love for Alan's work and they're going to find family with each other. What a blessing New York has received with this venue.",6,,1
6,Kye B.,"Las Vegas, NV",243,146,70,4.0,10/16/2017,"Yes it's a bit of a dive bar, but it is the most Exciting of its sort. I'm told that used to be a gay bar and now, with its owner Alan Cumming, it's moved beyond being just a gay bar to being a very friendly bar frequented by Really colorful people of all sorts. It sort of reminded me the bar in the movie Cabaret, which, ironically, Alan Cumming starred in on Broadway (he was fantastic in the role), So you might want to check out the movie to see if you might appreciate this bar. Fortunately there will be No Nazis up in this bar!!! Gently tucked into the middle of alphabet city, I found this place to be a really nice little hideaway to go to after a wonderful night at the theater. I can't wait to go back to New York because I want to go here again and see what other kind of antics might occur.",5,2,4
7,Rafi F.,"Manhattan, NY",1161,94,157,5.0,4/24/2018,"My friends took me here after my birthday dinner. Fun, new place with a classy look, offering different music artists and variety shows.Friendly bartender made my request of a blueberry moscow mule. It was great. Nice crowd of people of all ages in the heart of the Lower East Side.",,,
8,Pedro M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,170,0,5.0,9/25/2018,Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantasticwhat a treat that the live performances are back on....and they are fantastic. A loud crowd in a small space with talented performers. who are also a bit wacky in the most wonderful NYC kind of way.Just great. FYI monday nights say they start at 9...in my experience 1) get there at 9 or a little before if you want a seat; and 2) they wont start until 10 pm and go until late!,,,
9,Aaron G.,"Chicago Loop, Chicago, IL",73,176,1390,5.0,12/14/2017,"-A little crowded and cramped, but some great people watching (mixed crowd--gay/straight/queer) and interesting eclectic music.-Has a gritty burlesque feel.-Some great mixed live acts--from drag shows, to live music, to gogo dancers.-Great hand-painted mural evokes an old cabaret!",2,,
10,Zachary M.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/10/2018,"Last night me and two friends went to Club Cummings in the lower east side. We sat at the bar ordered 3 drinks and went about our business.Fast forward 5 minutes later and my friend Ayana ask if she can eat her chips and dip at the bar. Bartender says yes, and everyone stars to indulge in eating and sharing the chips.From the corner of my eye I see that the drag queen(who was sitting at the bar with a friend) is throwing shade and rolling her eyes. As usual my friend starts engaging in conversation and being friendly.  But the drag queen, friend, and bartender are just not having it.My friend says to the drag queen ""dude where did you perform?"" and the drag queen says don't call me dude and goes off on an unnecessary racially filled rant. My friend apologizes and explains she uses the word dude for everyone and to everyone and continues to apologize numerous times. Drag queen proceeds to call her an ignorant monkey bitch. Starts cackling with her friend next to her and starts calling my friend a peasy nappy headed  bitch.The bartender proceeds to join in calling her a rude dirty monkey bitch who's  nasty for eating chips at the bar.At this point I'm heated and going off. Another lady comes out (black) and ask us to come outside to ""talk"". She proceeds to tell us that this place is known for being racist and that she normally just shrugs it off because it's her place of employment.I suck my teeth and tell her I'm not paying for my drinks, and she better be lucky I don't swing on everyone in that establishment. So we go to walk off. As we're leaving. The bartender, drag queen, and her friend comes out the bar (in the process of closing) and again continues to throw racial slurs. I throw my coat off and out of nowhere one of their  friends behind us we weren't aware of blindsides us, attacks my friend,  and rides off on a motorcycle with my jacket.We call the police who come and AUTOMATICALLY assume I'm the one who the cops were called on. We tell the whole story including being robbed and they legit laugh, light a cigarette, and say ""go home"". We say we don't feel safe and to check the cameras we LEGIT see on top of the store front and light post and they just continue to laugh (yes all white). At this point it's clear these cops don't give two cares about us and we legit had no choice but to leave with no coat, no money, and no help.To think this went down in NYC in 2018 is crazy. SO MUCH MORE happened but it's too traumatizing and too much to even express in words. That place needs to be SHUT DOWN. I will be shedding light on this because wow...",50,12,1
11,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,5.0,12/7/2017,"Such great people! It's a community bar and so much more.There's Knit and Bitch nights, live model drawing sessions, burlesque, no-cover musical acts, full shows, GO-GO DANCERS.... everything!And the DJ was killing it the night I was there. I definitely hit my Fitbit goal of the day. The bartenders and the coatcheck person were so much fun! Go out to smoke even if you don't smoke. That's where all the cool kids are.Mr. Cumming and various celebs drop in on days that I'll never be there, so it's more FOMOing for me to agonize about. C'est la vie... It's not like I'm a real life socialite... just a Broke-ass one. Follow their Instagram. Trust me on this. Ambiance? I'm going with Fancy Dive. The chandeliers make it. Plenty of banquet seating along one mirrored wall. Chairs and tables come up from the basement for shows and are cleared out for dancing. It's such a flexible space for flexible people. So much fun to be had. Go get some!Edited to add: I misspelled Julian VELARD in the videos. ::smacks self::",11,6,8
12,Brandon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,218,142,3.0,2/6/2018,"I went to Club Cumming when it hosted a fundraiser after the Women's March in New York City. There was a live band there that was incredible. The bar does look a little crummy, but that's the typical lower east side feel that so many 20-somethings crave during their stint in the city. You haven't lived the New York lifestyle unless you're passed out drunk, on the floor, of a crummy bar. At least that's what the Hollywood version of NYC looks like for millennials. The drinks were a bit watered-down, but I'm willing to give the establishment a bit of a pass. I'm guessing that's because it was packed because of the event, and only two bartenders were working that day. I'll likely have to return on a day where there's not a fundraising event and see if that changes my review.",2,,1
13,Rafael F.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,11,5,5.0,1/26/2018,"By far the most inclusive bar I've ever been to. Incredible. I came here thinking it was still Eastern Bloc and I couldn't have been more blessed to discover it is now Club Cummings! They bring in a very fun crowd and I even met the owner of the place. Really nice guy! Club Cummings is for introverts, extroverts, wall flowers, dancing queens you name it they are here for it! Can't wait to come back :)PS try to go on a Friday night so you can catch Daphne Always tear the house down with her powerhouse vocals and vibrant, colorful soul.",2,,
14,Laurie P.,"Traverse City, MI",79,3,5,5.0,11/18/2017,"Had so much fun dancing here! Even though I came alone, I found the scene to feel inclusive, warm and accepting. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. The dancers were relentless and hot,  the variety acts were top notch talent, and the djs kept the dream alive! So fun!",2,1,2
15,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,4.0,10/9/2017,"It definitely smells better than Eastern BlocI guess this is a brand new spot, the location of the not defunct Eastern Bloc. To be honest, I did not really notice too many differences between Club Cumming and the Eastern Bloc. I visited on an early Saturday evening (around 6pm) and the place was packed. The clientele was very similar (various races, body types, and genders) to the types that hung out at Eastern Bloc. The DJ played top music selections from the 80s, 90s, and 00s. The music was pretty good and I would have to say about 80% of the place was dancing. It felt like I was at party rather than a bar. Also, there is an option to request songs by writing your favorite song on a Post-it (my song was never played :( ). The Post-its gave me a C'mon Everybody feel to Club Cumming (whatever works). Although the bar is more or less the same, payment with debit/credit cards is one difference that I really enjoyed. Now, I will not have to use the sketchy ATM at the front of the bar.  Let your livers rejoice!!! The prices of drinks were standard for the area ($10 dollars for a well gin and soda), but a little more expensive than the prices of the Eastern Bloc.",5,2,2
16,Lara S.,"Philadelphia, PA",85,133,6,5.0,6/4/2018,"It's just like walking back into the early 90s of NYC clubs. Trust me, that's s huge compliment!",1,,1
17,Alan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",609,6,2,5.0,2/15/2018,NY has been missing bars like this. Come as you are with the glam on the side! Such an amazing night,,,
18,E. S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/17/2018,Great floor shows  music and people.  A little tight but cozy.  Sometimes you get waited on by the divine mr. Cummings.,,,
19,Cody B.,"Eugene, OR",71,9,0,1.0,4/14/2018,"The bartenders were rude. The bathroom was frightfully less than clean. The drinks were lacking in any form of craftsmanship, and there's a two drink minimum. So, plan on buying some stranger a craptail so you can get out of there faster. Unless there's a notable person performing cabaret then I'd politely advise trying a different venue.",1,,
20,B. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,104,1,4.0,3/3/2018,"I have visited this little club twice so far for a Crisco Disco party then for the Romy & Michelle Saturday Afternoon Tea Dance. It seems as this is a club that is different every night of the week depending on the event. While it is a fairly long walking from the L train, it was worth it. The clientele tends to be very wide ranging but the great thing is more often than not, they like the same music/artists you do. Thus far, I have not visited for other events. The cocktails the first time around were mixed badly with next to no Orange Juice in the Screwdriver. In contrast, the second time around they were fabulous and strong on every cocktail. The restroom is quite small but it was clean. There plenty of dancing, singing, conversations and then more dancing. Overall, it is worth a visit for either one of these events.",1,,
21,Dee K.,"New York, NY",3,152,17,5.0,10/21/2017,I gad a lot of fun here tonight. I really enjoyed the music and dancing to songs I knew with people my age (over 30). Great vibe and energy; nice mixed crowd of open minded and chill men and women. I'll gladly come back.,2,1,2
22,Alice J.,"New York, NY",16,52,4,5.0,11/3/2017,I must say It is best place for party. Service and food is awesome. I recommended to all my friends.,2,1,2
23,Harry V. D.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,8,1,4.0,1/14/2018,"Great atmosphere, Great Comedy Shows, people, drinks and Great Service! This is definitely a place to let it all hang out! ""No Pun A Intended!""",,,
24,S. H.,"New York, NY",0,22,0,1.0,5/28/2018,"Went Friday night to meet a friend for drinks. It was a holiday weekend, and early in the evening, 8pm, so not busy. There were maybe 12 customers in the place, and 3 bartenders working. Yet it took the bartenders more than 10 minutes to get us each a drink (a beer and a glass of wine), and they did so only after giving much attitude. They were very well put together though, however seemed more interested in vamping than bartending. The doorman gave an imitation of one of America's worst cops, as he scrutinized our IDs (we're both in our 50s) and very aggressively- as in yelling in our faces- asked us dumb questions and asked if we would empty out pockets. We're 50 year old professors. We weren't armed. This used to be a friendly neighborhood place. Obviously the new iteration is going a very different way.",1,,
25,Ali M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,30,9,1.0,11/18/2017,"Club Cumming, 11:30pm Sat 18Nov2017-12:30am. DISAPPOINTING!  --Lots of unpleasant odors to be smelled. Too many people in too small a space further overloaded by coats, purses, and costumes. --More straight than gay at this time of night. Drag-queens whose acts seemed stale to those of us who enjoyed nights out in the late '80s and early '90s. Not to mention a single bathroom and the uneasy feeling that you're in a fire-trap. --One good thing: the efficiency of the coat-check fellow. I'll probably go back another night in case tonight was an off-night for the venue.",,1,
26,Art H.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,35,1,5.0,2/22/2018,"I was afraid that the transition from Eastern Bloc to Club Cumming would be neuter the inherent gayness of this space, but those fears were entirely unfounded.  This is a fantastic spot - live music, amateur performances, wonderful bartenders, and more than a few drag queens. Highly recommended for anyone in Alphabet City who wants some life.",,,
27,Gabe W.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,2/22/2018,"Truly amazing. What an amazing atmosphere. Takes Eastern Bloc to a way classier, more friendly, less empty sticky floor experience. An essential place to visit in the neighborhood.",,,
28,G B.,"Kenilworth, NJ",11,760,4908,4.0,10/14/2017,this place was so much fun! me and my friends came becuz brightlight brightlight was dj'ing and it was awesome! it was for the romy and michelle theme night. so cool with the post its everywhere! i totally recommend it! the ONLY complaint i have is the bathrooms are soooo dark! can they just put a bright bulb in there? lol.,2,1,2
29,José C.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,1,0,2.0,10/13/2017,"I was excited to visit this new bar in the lower east side, and I did receive a wonderful welcome from a beautiful bartender.   She told me it was 2 for 1 at the moment and gave me a chip to redeem later.   However,  fifteen minutes later I was saddened by being confronted by a European male bartender who rudely provided me with a lesson on happy hours and their chip system who asked me condescendingly what time it was.  It was 815.  Happy hour ended at 8 and I was not impressed by their ten dollar well drink and the terrible service.",1,,
