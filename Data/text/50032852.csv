0,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2242,478,3.0,9/12/2018,"what i like about this bagel shop and then some is that bagels are made in house which means if you stop by at the right time you will have your variety of hot fresh bagels . good selection of bagels with plenty of assorted spreads . the muffins and salads are decent but stick with the bagels and some cream cheese which will be good enough with some coffee or whatever beverage you may like .the prices are a bit high but it's manhattan so expect it but the counter folks are fairly quick and stuff the bagels above average and decent amount of tables spaced out for added elbow room  . daily bagel on 1st ave may not be the best bagel shop in nyc but it holds its own with a passing grade . 3.5 stars on my yelp meter cause If you don't want bagels you can grab some cereal , eggs on a roll , donuts ,etc.",3,1,3

We got two bagels and the lunch special gyro with fries. A blueberry bagel w strawberry cream cheese and a onion bagel with sun dried tomato cream cheese was $7.50. My gyro with fries and a water was $8.17 including tax. Nothing was bad. The fries are freshly grilled and the gyro is like your average gyro. Not bad.

I decided to order in and can't understand these horrible reviews. BEST bagel I have had in a long time. And much cheaper than Pick-A-Bagel. Also 20 ounces of green juice with ginger for 8.95 is decent. Often the 12 ounces are 9 bucks. Fast delivery. Vegetable cream cheese as good as Pick-a-Bagel which has the audacity to charge 3.75 for this portion.

The mini heart black and white cookies look cute but they are not the real deal. These cookies were crumbly, dry and bland. I would definitely skip them. The service left a lot to be desired. First off, while standing in line none of the workers behind the deli asked me for my order. Somehow I made it all the way to the cash register and was asked to go back to the end of the line to order. The line took forever, even though they were not that busy they cashier kept asking the couple in front of me over and over what they had ordered. Maybe they should write it down?

20,Michele L.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",310,80,60,3.0,11/5/2016,"It's always hard for me to write a mediocre review for a place where the staff is as friendly and eager to please as that at Daily Bagel. This deli has a lot of potential and I hope it takes an upswing.The location is extremely convenient as it's right on first avenue. The deli itself is great for a quick in-and-out visit and the space is open, clean and comfortable. There are plenty of chairs and tables if you'd like to sit and have a place to eat with coworkers and friends. Service, like others have mentioned, is a little bumbly but they are very friendly and do try their absolute best. I have never had an issue with food quality and everything I've gotten from here has been great. My favorite thing here is the udon soup station near the back. You get your pick of unlimited veggie toppings and the soup is steaming hot and flavorful.My only big gripe with Daily Bagel are their price. It does seem a bit high, even taking into consideration the Manhattan area and higher rents. A large iced coffee here is almost $4 and the average sandwich around $9, which makes coming to Daily Bagel multiple times a week rather financially irresponsible for me.All in all, Daily Bagel is a decent deli but improving on some flaws would really make it a staple in the neighborhood.",,,

When they're not rushing, my bacon, egg and cheese always turns out amazing!! I always tell them to make sure my bagel isn't burnt haha. The salad bar in the back is pretty great too! One thing that I've noticed is the cashier always charges a different amount every time I'm there!! And it's always more money getting added on.

My coworkers frequent here all the time I would have never expected this kind of service on the upper east side let alone a residential area.

TIP: Ask to get half and half cream cheese, depending on who is serving you they'll let you choose half and half but sometimes they won't (bummer). I always get the garlic bagel with the chipotle cream cheese and sun dried tomato. Delicioussssssssss and eat when it's warm!!!

33,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",357,144,37,4.0,5/27/2015,"I'll begin with the most important thing about Daily Bagel: the food. Upon entering the store, you'll encounter rows and rows of bagel baskets, each indicating one of several different types available. Of course you'll find your standard favorites - sesame, everything, pumpernickel - but you'll also discover less common options like sunflower seed.The base price is $1.20 for the bagel itself (which is pretty average in Manhattan), and there are numerous spreads you can pair them with. So far, I've only tried the whole wheat everything, but the quality and taste have remained consistent. The texture is especially noteworthy; soft and chewy, with a relatively even distribution of toppings. There really isn't anything bad I can say about the bagels served here.To comment on the customer service issues mentioned in other reviews, I've noticed that the majority of criticism derives from the unstructured process of standing in line to order & pay. Last time I was here, one of the employees inadvertently skipped over the man in front of me, thinking he had already been helped (which clearly frustrated the customer). I won't deny that these mixups are cultivating an overall negative depiction of the business, but certain aspects can be improved by something as simple as a rope line to foster a more organized system. Daily Bagel is still figuring it all out in terms of its service, but at least I know where to go if I'm looking to buy a quick, affordable breakfast nearby!",1,,

Beyond bagels, they have sandwiches, soups, salads, and really anything else that you may want to eat.Whenever I need a bagel fast, I make sure to come here. Their spreads look delicious, and they have more cream cheese flavors than I can count. The only negatives are that their fruit flavored cream cheese (blueberry, strawberry, etc.) are too colorful for me. They look nice, but I imagine that they use a ton of food coloring. And there is an additional $1 fee for breakfast sandwiches after 11AM. These aren't major complaints, but just some things to keep in mind.

In detail: I waited nearly 20 mins (did they bake the bread first?) for French toast w/ a side of turkey bacon, NO eggs. Before telling the ""chef"" my order, the person who took my order mentioned turkey bacon would be $1 extra- multiple times (check your cameras) Okay no prob.Time to pay: sometimes the cashier gives my 10% city discount, sometimes she doesn't. Whatevs don't mind paying the tax, that's life.  However, what I don't have tolerance for is brainlessness. I was charged 7.95 + $2.00 for the turkey bacon in my order- based on the only French toast on their menu was the ""platter specials"" (#3- French toast + 2 eggs + bacon or sausage + free 10oz coffee)A) Jose over there told me it was $1 extra multiple times (cashier shrugs)B) do you see any eggs on my plate?

Updated review","I'm even more disappointed with Daily Bagel then I was originally. I went in at noon to order a breakfast sandwich and found out that I owed an extra $1.50 because they apparently stop serving breakfast sandwiches after 11 AM. As if it's that much of a hassle to reach into the fridge and crack an egg on the grill! I would understand (slightly more so) if Daily Bagel stopped serving breakfast altogether after 11 AM, which is not an uncommon practice. However, they still serve it, it's just that after 11 you owe them even more money than the exorbitant amount you would already be paying.Again, there are much better places to grab yourself a bagel on the UES. As someone who's been living above DB for a year and a half now, I urge you to steer clear.",,,

I shouldn't hold that against Daily Bagel as it's a free cup of coffee (and how many things do you get for free in NYC to begin with?), but there's nothing more disappointing than a bad cup of coffee.

Their food is fresh but they often mess up orders. Whenever confronted they are apologetic and quick to fix. Prices are inconsistent and their order/paying system needs to be fixed. It is especially painful when there are a lot of coffee orders. Hopefully they get their act together,,,
55,Jess H.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",4,14,12,3.0,2/8/2015,"The place was wayyyy understaffed. Came on a Saturday morning and it was packed, getting very backed up. My fiance said he had been once before and it was the same way. Not a great debut, you would think the owner would make sure in the first few weeks of opening that the service would be on point. They made several mistakes on our order I'm sure because they were so busy and couldn't keep up with everyone. That being said, the food was fine",1,,
56,Daniel L.,"New York, NY",432,223,72,5.0,1/5/2015,"New joint that just opened up. Fresh and hot bagels made on premise!Looks like there's a lot of spread options. I ended up going with a regular plain bagel and their sundried tomato cream cheese. No need to toast especially since it's fresh. They also have panini grill sandwiches as well as a salad bar. Looks like they're also running a ""Buy a bagel with cream cheese and get a free coffee"" special for now. With great bagels and lots of spread options, I'll be back soon!!",1,,

Updated review","I came back here today. I really was craving an egg sandwich and it's located so conveniently near my job. Once again, I did not have cash on me and had to find a way to meet their $5 minimum. I told the guy behind the counter ""egg and cheese on a scooped out whole wheat bagel."" He asked me something I did not understand and then after him repeating it 3x, I realized he was asking me what kind of cream cheese I wanted. I said no ""egg and cheese."" He replied okay, I got it, but I knew it didn't. I just had a feeling. I only repeated that I wanted itscooped out, but should have said the whole order again, because of course it got messed up. I know egg and cheese on a bagel is $4.08, at least that's what it was the last time I got it so I asked for avocado to raise the price by a dollar which worked out. When I got to the office, before I went upstairs, I had a feeling I should check the sandwich, but didn't and of course when I got to my desk I realized he gave me a plain bagel instead of whole wheat. Whatever. First world problems. I ate it and made a mental note to speak slowly and clearly and have them repeat the order back to me 3x if I ever go back there again...emphasis on if.",1,,1
58,Andreanna S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,1,1.0,7/9/2016,Worst bagel place in the neighborhood - gave the place a chance a number of times - every time placing a simple order - they screw it up. And the worst you have to wait 15 minutes just to pay . If you go check your order before you leave !!,,,
59,E L.,"Manhattan, NY",54,16,3,5.0,2/8/2017,Ok best bagel in NYC .. in my 27 years of living in NY I have never eaten a bagel without cream cheese but these bagels are good enough to eat without - I got soup here and it came with a free ww everything bagel which I was surprised I liked even though it had no cream cheese. I also get Greek salad wraps here which are very good. Really surprised to see the other reviews here!,,,
60,Gabriela N.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",68,53,2,5.0,12/31/2016,Seriously one of the best Tuna bagels sandwiches I've ever had. The bagel itself was delicious. First time here and didn't try anything else.,,,
61,Anastasia W.,"San Diego, CA",122,396,90,4.0,1/22/2015,"So far so good.  We have been here twice since they opened for breakfast.  We got our usual order - one bagel toasted with cream cheese and one bagel sandwich with egg cheese and sausage.  The bagel sandwich was pretty darn good!  Nice amount of egg/sausage.  The bagel with cream cheese was tasty as well. The bagels here have a more chewy consistency, and seem heavier than others I have tried, but were good.Overall the store seemed very clean.  Interested to try other foods here and see how they do in the next couple weeks.",,,
62,Samantha S.,"New York, NY",0,12,2,3.0,4/25/2016,"If you're in the mood for a bagel, this is the place to go. If you want anything else, go elsewhere. Their omlettes and ""paninis"" are overpriced and really not good.",,,
63,Dave G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,1.0,6/18/2016,"Terrible value!A whole wheat breakfast wrap with eggs, cheese and turkey bacon = $8.98!!!Most places across the neighborhood charge $4.50-6.00 for the same item. I believe this same item was previously about $6...not sure why the price went up by ~50%. The staff at the register confirmed the $8.98 price when I challenged what seemed like a mistake or joke.Aside from the outrageous price, it tasted fine - but was light on the eggs. Summary: Avoid Daily Bagel at all costs!",,,
64,Kraig T.,"New York, NY",137,3,0,1.0,4/2/2016,Just found a black hair in my tuna sandwich. Spoke to the cashier and he showed the cooks who just started laughing.  Do not come here unless you want extra hair with your tuna.,,,
65,Brendan M.,"Boston, MA",0,8,0,1.0,4/5/2015,"Have tried this place three times and each was severely disappointing.1 - Bagels are clearly never boiled and therefore are a baked, soft doughy mess. If you're into that (and have no sense of taste), then you'll love this place.2 - I ordered a breakfast platter through seamless that included coffee. To make a long story short, I ended up in a fight with the manager on the phone who claimed the included coffee was a grand opening special and was no longer honored. Why is it still on the menu?3 - Went for my last time this morning. The place was not busy, but I could not get the attention of any of the three workers chatting amongst themselves to order. Finally asked for a blueberry muffin. Opened it when I got home - it's cranberry.These people are incompetent.",4,,
66,Meroe L.,"New York, NY",0,24,3,2.0,1/24/2016,"The reason for the low rating is that on more than one occasion, Daily Bagel has sold the previous day's bagels when they were short staffed. If they are going to sell day-old bagels, the price should be steeply discounted. If there has been any kind of inclement weather the day before and you want a fresh bagel in the morning, do NOT go here.",,,
67,K W.,"Manhattan, NY",3,72,8,5.0,3/17/2015,"I go here at least once a week since it's opening.  While service was absolutely terrible the first week or two, the staff has become much more comfortable it seems.  The bagels never disappoint and while I've never had anything on it but cream cheese, I'm not complaining.Nice selection of both bagels & spreads.FYI $5 minimum to use a debit/credit card",2,,1
68,Cailyn V.,"Philadelphia, PA",106,11,0,1.0,2/17/2015,"If you don't mind dealing with painfully incompetent workers in exchange for a mediocre bagel, then Daily Bagel is the spot for you. Despite being overstaffed and having very few customers, it somehow takes 10 minutes to receive an egg and cheese bagel. Don't even think about ordering a coffee or pastry- I'm confident that a tortoise could outshine their ""barista"" in terms of fastness and efficiency. Cashier is extremely rude, consistently overcharges, and is unable to do simple math. Service is comparable to that of your local DMV.",3,1,1
69,Colton W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1,1.0,2/8/2015,"This place is just around the corner from me and was looking forward to try it. I'm Jewish so it's in my blood to have a bagel lox and cream cheese on a Sunday. I ordered a whole wheat everything bagel with cream cheese and lox....they legit put the thinnest slices of lox on it, and after one bite all the lox was gone, it was awful!!!!! Do not got the lox from here!!!! This is a shame of a bagel place, worst bagel to lox ratio I have ever had!!!!",3,,
70,Yousry E.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,12/5/2015,I'm very disappointed by the rudeness and unprofessionalism of the cashier lady at Daily bagel. She is incredibly disrespectful and condescending to customers and clearly hates her job. I wouldn't be surprised if she spits in the customers' food. I placed an order on Seamless for pickup and happened to be walking my dog this morning. I tried to go in while carrying my dog to let her know I'm waiting outside the store for my order. She then kicks me out of the store for not allowing dogs and tells me no one will bring my order outside the restaurant. So basically I cannot get the food I paid for. I've been a very loyal and valuable customer at this place and I can safely say I will not be returning or recommending this place to any friends who live in the neighborhood. I will only return if that lady gets fired for ruining the reputation of Daily Bagel. Such a shame.,3,,
71,Nata A.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,7,12,1.0,2/28/2015,"No good!!!! Disappointed !!!!! Went for cup of coffee and a bagel.. Bagel itself was a ok.... Ordered tofu vegy cream-cheese and coffe with soy milk. When I got my bagel ... I could hardly notice any cream cheese on it, but when I opened my coffee , my eyes rolled up. Milk was sour... Ok. No biggie. Went nicely to the cashier guy and asked him to check my cup and do something about it. I had to wait good 10 min until he turned towards me, there were other workers and two more customers standing on line. Rudely he told me that:"" this is Soy milk is support to be in hot liquid""??!!! Really ??? Like, this is my first time ordering coffee with Soy milk. He defiantly took Soy milk pack out of the fridge and pointed to me that expiration day is fine, then in the same manner tested the milk  and asked me what do I want ..??? I asked for regular milk.... I wouldn't recommend this place for two reasons: first, unprofessional and rude stuff. Second, for the price they charge, skimpy portions.",1,,

80,Moira V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,7/2/2015,"It was such a mess here trying to get and pay for a bagel and water here this morning it felt like an episode of What Would You Do. The only thing that makes sense is that the owner is trying to lose money as a tax write off etc. There was a long line of mostly workers trying to get breakfast orders in. You think a bagel place would be thrilled construction workers would buy from them but one guy was practically chastised for having a biggish order.  The store workers were not organised at all and it was chaos with orders being received wrong, in bits and pieces etc. When you run this kind of place you need to work efficiently and get the customers out before their food is stone cold. I waited to pay while my daughter ate her bagel which was ok and she was half done by the time I got finished. A bagel place would be welcome as there is only a Starbucks across the street but I am not going back and I can't imagine guys on the clock are going to enjoy dithering away their mornings waiting for the correct order in a timely fashion. I am not blaming any individual worker as this is clearly a mgmt issue! Good luck!",3,,

85,Erin B.,"Manhattan, NY",261,3,0,3.0,5/12/2015,The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. It's really nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood with so many meal options.

89,Ashley P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,3.0,3/26/2015,"I think Daily Bagel is a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. The food is delicious and fresh. I do, however, want to make a strong comment regarding the customer service.My apartment happens to be across the street so I get my dinner from daily bagel AT LEAST 5 out of 7 nights per week, plus breakfast one weekends. The evening staff is nothing but lovely and helpful, they will go above and beyond to make sure you feel welcome. The morning staff is a different story. Although the following experience has nothing to do with their food specifically, I feel it is important to mention in a world (and specifically a business) where I can purchase the same food at 3 other locations within a one block radius - customer service is what really sets you aside. I left my phone there one evening at 8:55pm. The evening staff locked the door behind me as I walked out so I know for fact I was the last customer. I got up early the next morning and went to the shop at 6:15 before too many people had been in. I was ""greeted"" by Vincent, the morning ""manager"", who had an outrageously arrogant attitude and even accused me of lying about having left it there. He said they had cameras, so I asked to see them. Whether or not they had the phone (which they did, sitting JUST behind the register), the level of attitude, unhelpfulness and accusatory behavior was unlike I had ever experienced in a customer service driven environment. I was finally able to get to a computer to ""find my iPhone"" and make it ""ping"". At which point, I went back and picked it up  - I told Vincent that there was no excuse for his attitude and accusations and his defense was ""Well, you shouldn't have left your phone"".  Ignoring the fact that the phone was sitting directly in plain sight behind the register the entire time, the behavior of the morning staff, specifically Vincent, is something I felt was completely out of line. I value customer service more than the food in this case, as I mentioned, I could give you a list of alternative places to get a bagel or coldcuts within the one block around the shop.",,,

91,Roberta F.,"New York, NY",1,1,0,1.0,2/17/2015,"I was very excited for this place to open, since the food options in the area are limited. However, this place was a major disappointment - food-wise, price-wise and service-wise. The biggest let down of the place is the inconsistency with the cashiers working there. They either need better training or the place needs to establish clearer price points. Every time I have gone in there for my breakfast sandwhich- a whole wheat bagel with egg whites and spinach, I am charged different prices, usually ranging between 5.50-6.50. However, this time (the last time I ever go in there), I was charged 7.57 for the same item. I let the cashier know about the error in the price and he shook his head without saying a word. The manager behind him also did the same. I would advise customers to buy their food elsewhere, unless they don't mind inconsistent pricing and being charged $8 for a simple sub-par breakfast sandwich.",4,1,1
92,Laura C.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",5,10,2,2.0,6/13/2015,"The customer service here is just not acceptable, which is unfortunate since the food itself deserves a higher rating (great salads). I ordered their 2 Eggs Any Style special this AM which is $3 on a roll/bagel, or $5.95 as a platter. I asked for the first option but for my eggs to be placed on a plate instead of in a sandwich - he said no problem. When I was rung up by the woman at checkout, she insisted I pay double, $5.95, since I was having my eggs without the roll. I explained to her that I didn't order a platter (includes home fries/sides), but just wanted my eggs plopped on a plate as I'm trying to eat light, and that I was told it would be no problem. She would not honor this. Honestly if I hadn't been so hungry I would have just walked out, but my stomach made me do otherwise and have them place the eggs from the plate onto a roll so I wouldn't be charged double. Sadly this will no longer be my salad-go-to anymore! Not worth it.",1,,
93,Sharon F.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/20/2015,"it's really a shame this place has such poor customer service and indifferent (at best) ownership. yes, this kind of place is needed in the neighborhood. (i've lived a couple blocks away for many years and was happy to see this shop open.) but they seem to suddenly lose all language skills when a customer tries to engage. apparently particularly when it comes to price discrepancies. (which is odd since they have a very detailed menu posted.) i went in within the first week. the person who took my order was lovely (i can't imagine employees sticking around too long) but my cashier was rude. and i saw what was likely one of the owners surveying the goods in the case, etc., while i was sitting right nearby and never once did he make eye contact. (i saw a van from queens arrive and he and some others run out to unload.) a welcoming presence would be good for a business especially when it's new. yeah, i didn't review the food here even though i had an egg sandwich (which was adequate) because i just don't care and I won't be back. if the service is abysmal, why give them business? it's important to support small local businesses but they in no way deserve patronage when they clearly don't care about the community they're serving. and in fact are rude and dismissive. plus they seem to be playing games with the prices. i don't go for that. so, no way. hope they close for good sooner rather than later. good riddance.",2,1,1
