The drip coffee I had wasn't too dark and let the berry flavor out. Smooth. Their specialty drinks, including lattes with seasonal spices, looked good. I had two tiny muffins that had a surprising burst of cream in the middle; tasty but small. The barista was polite but efficient, and didn't waste any words or movements fulfilling my order. The shop is strictly take out, as there are two small bar stools and a ledge and that's about all the hospitality you get. I would make this a regular stop on my AM coffee hunt.",

SS is literally a hole in the wall, with at most five seatings squeezed inside the room. For a coffee shop, I actually love this sort of intimacy.

Updated review",2265,2,"Manhattan, NY",Jaimee A.,649,3.0,1601,"I have to knock a few stars off this review. We came back to the Stone Street Coffee Company today and don't get me wrong, the coffee was still great, but the service - meh. The women behind the counter was rude. Also, they now charge $.75 for the vanilla infused simple syrup. Seriously? $.75? How petty are you that you charge several dollars for a cup of coffee then you feel that you need to charge extra for simple syrup with a vanilla twig in it? The counter person kept chanting it too, taking the bottle out of my hand until I paid for it.I may have felt better about the $.75 if it came without the attitude but clearly the counterperson was giving that away for free.",7

The homemade vanilla latte felt like the best drink to give them a chance to really shine, and it did. It was a tasty drink and the vanilla really popped in a unique way. That said, it didn't really taste like coffee nor did the milk strike me as particularly creamy. It just had a very nice sweet, vanilla flavor. Service was nice. Ambiance is a counter on the street. If I walk by again, I'll definitely try something else.",

I thought that was weird, since it is advertised as fresh on the sign outside- but I thought maybe it was squeezed this morning which I am personally okay with. I paid for my juices and left without trying them, having trusted that stone street coffee would know what all fresh OJ drinkers know: THE TASTE OF NOT FRESH OJ.  They charged me $7 for two cups of Tropicana. They also didn't answer the phone when I called to complain. This happened like 16 minutes ago. I will never go back.",

This little cafe was on our way to the parking garage and we decided to pop in. It is a very quaint shop with limited bar seating. I decided to try out their iced mint tea. I poured in some honey and it helped balance out the mintiness of it. I love anything mint so I was a big fan of the tea. It was very cold and refreshing and hit the spot after a long day of walking.,

There usually is a young woman behind the counter who is always pleasant and a huge dog lover and has treats for them. I always have a cappuccino (smooth not bitter or acidic). I recently purchased a Chocolate French Macaron. I stood out front Stone Street and devoured the French pastry and sipped my cappuccino. I started my walk back to the apartment on 7th when half way through remnants were still dancing around in my mouth. I stopped and went back or an additional Chocolate Macaron.This place is more than a GREAT coffee shop, during the afternoon hours a saloon opens up in the back. The wall you are facing when you enter has a secret door but you would't know because it is painted blue and has a large framed picture hanging from the door ;0)Food: Coffee and pastries are very good.Service: Pleasant and cheerful (The Young Woman)Decor: Very cozy and warm.

My dear girlfriend and I were walking towards ninth street espresso at Chelsea market when we stumbled upon a place we haven't seen before... This one!! Very small very interesting and also nice because they use their own coffee and let me tell you, it is very good.Now, they reason why I'm sad is because when I ordered my espresso and iced coffee the barista place my espresso in a to go cup, espresso shouldn't be placed in a to go cup... But that was my mutate for not specifying such a terrible act.Now, the barista grabbed a plastic cup and poured straight from the machine, the espresso shot... WHY!!!!!! No one should do that ever... Ever... Not even f it is convenient. Pouring hot contents into plastic is a terrible thing.... Please never do this, that's why I had to give three stars! God never do that for anything!!!!",3

I thought I would make it to Starbucks being such a sucker for those gold stars accumulating on my app for a free drink, but ended up being gravitationally pulled into Stone Street. This seems counter-intuitive, but the walk-up window made me walk inside. Everyone outside just looked so happy. Their dogs looked happy. The barista helping them looked happy. Once inside, I saw there was not much seating area, but the service was exceptional and made me wish I was a local.I ordered a blueberry scone (the pastries are from Amy's Bread) and a soy latte. They have Guatemalan coffee, which makes the coffee dark (almost bitter), but really good.Being just down the street from Chelsea market, you should make your way over to this little place. All that happiness and they have a membership program for all of you that are as neurotic as me about your accumulation toward free future coffee.",5

My auto response to that is to ignore, plus I've never seen a bouncer outside a coffee shop. By the time I realized what was going on I was annoyed and alienated. If there's a speakeasy inside then the bouncer should be inside too.",
31,2,8/5/2011,44,1,"Manhattan, NY",Paul W.,1154,3.0,157,"One thing I really don't understand about this city is the lack of coffeehouses that stay open late. Not talking Starbucks, not talking diners. Coffeehouses. It seems like the majority of them set their hours on an inverse relationship to their 'coffee seriousness'. What's going on there?Tonight a friend and I stumbled across a place that approaches a 'serious' coffee joint that doesn't slam shut before the vampires rise. Well, he stumbled across it and I glommed on.See, I was just giving myself the compulsory post-movie-bed-bug-brush-down after the latest Harry Potter flick at Lincoln Square. Then a text came in: 'Just passed coffee place it's open. Meet at 18th & 9th Av.' Time sent: 10:47 PM. I dashed for the 1.Lo and behold, there was Stone Street Coffee, all shiny and new. It looked good. Sure smelt good. There didn't appear to be any seats at the counter so we prepared to order at the takeaway window. The friendly barista beckoned, 'Come in. I'll get you a chair.' The latte was good. Nice flavour and temperature. My friend got an iced decaf coffee. No complaints from either of us.BUT...Stone Street is probably not a place to linger and enjoy your coffee. For one thing, the shop front is tiny, with enough room for maybe 3 stools at the counter.Then there's the fact that it serves as the unofficial vestibule for a bar/lounge. This lounge isn't marked except for a flashing red bulb over a door off to the side. And the loud thumping music. And the steady stream of people issuing from that unmarked door under the red flashing bulb. And the crowd of seemingly inebriated people milling outside the shop entrance. One dude (for lack of a better term...or any other term, as it were) stuck his head in the takeaway window and commented on the attractiveness of the espresso machine. Then he made a grab for my latte as the barista finished his pour.OK, I guess I am complaining a bit and making the place seem pretty awful. Honestly, that's not my intent. In the end, I'm still excited to see a place within 15 miles of my apartment serving nice coffee past 9 PM. I know, sad, right? But, fuck, sometimes I just want a goddamn latte with the arty foam and stuff after the sun has set. They also have treats from Financier Patisserie. Nice, right? (Oh, but my macaron was somewhat shitty. Ah, I'm such an asshole.)I imagine that this would be a pretty cool place to check out in the daytime. In the future, I'd probably get a latte to go and take a walk. It'd be past 9 PM and I'd be pretty happy.",3

Usually a pour over is stronger than a regular drip. The barista poured the water straight in the center and it went straight through. Starting to feel hesitant. The cup was slightly more than half way filled and he handed it to me. I wanted it black and a full cup not a half cup of coffee. It was not at all hot and tasted like very diluted coffee. I would have been better off with the drip. This cup absolutely was not worth it.The milk in the cappuccino looked like a blob.

I like to try and support new businesses in the hood and I was excited to sample an espresso and some pastry. The service window was open but the door was locked. A moment later a man appeared, unlocked the door and went inside. I tried to follow but he locked the door behind him.  I stuck my head in though the window and saw the man mopping the floor. I asked if they were open and without looking at me he said they were. I then asked if all orders had to be made through the window. He looked at me and said, ""That's why the window is open.""I was already really annoyed so I didn't bother to point out that I was also hungry but none of the pastry could be viewed from the window. As a result I did not sample any food.Instead of espresso I ordered a small coffee for two dollars. It was ordinary and the  ""barrista"" (who was clad in a ""wife-beater"" undershirt) added way too much milk resulting in a luke-warm brew and, it should be noted, that he couldn't even be bothered to say thank you after completing the transaction. The coffee house competition in this city (and this neighborhood) is too great for a business to get by with such slip shod customer service. To be fair, this may be just a bad morning at Stone Street so perhaps I will give them another try if I am walking by, but it won't be an experience that I will go out of my way for.",5

I suppose such are the complications of urban dwelling in the 21st century.Stone Street's darling window, with its warm oranges looking onto the Chelsea street that is 9th Avenue invited me in.

This is a very well kept clean place where the barista can communicate effectively and not involve himself in the order - just there to give good service. Well maintained - neat and feels cozy despite its being extremely small. There is seating around the edges and a take out window in front. The low rating has to do with the espresso taste. Its not bad. I hope they change or improve it - something here communicates they care about the product and service that's why 3 over 2 stars. The black napkins are a nice touch. Good luck to Y'all.

47,,11/28/2014,6,,"San Francisco, CA",Evan Z.,15,4.0,23,Very cozy little shop. I had the cortado after reading the other reviews. It was pretty much as described. Would definitely recommend this as a pit stop along the way to Chelsea Market.,
48,,5/5/2012,130,2,"New York, NY",Michael C.,39,5.0,70,"Most annoying question when ordering a cappacino? What size. A proper cappacino is not measured in size, but rather three properly pulled shots of espresso, topped with about an ounce and a half of streamed milk and a dollop of foam. Two shots of espresso in an 8- to 12 ounce cup filled with milk does not a proper capp make. Starbucks gets this, as does Ninth Street Espresso, the latter my former personal New York favorite until my recent discovery of Stone Street. Coffee is one of the few things in life about which I am a snob. Spoiled for years by The Conservatory for Coffee in Culver City, California, I had been consistently disappointed by the lack of quality coffee houses within reasonable distance of home and work here in New York. And while Ninth Street Espresso has been great, Stone Street has kicked it upstairs. To the C-Suite.While not (yet?) privy to their roasting process, this is probably the first of two break-out distinctions here. Local roasting is rare in New York, and while others do it, Stone Street does it better. Every blend I've tried has exemplified an expert technique that brings out the full aroma and flavor of each. And second, in terms of the perfect capp, is the milk, organic and sourced from a local upstate farm. A bonus... (And I probably shouldn't share this)... they sell it to me on the side with my purchase of ground beans to go, so my Capresso machine at home makes me $4 capps at home for under a buck. It is this attention to service and detail that really earned this five stars. Starting each day with the proper cappuccino... the perfect blend of roast and milk... is like mainlining coffee and chocolate, and has greatly improved my morning mood and commute each day. A great accompaniment to, and something I hope to see soon ""In the Papers."" Some of you will get that and most won't. And it doesn't matter as long as I do.Children of the Bean...

53,,2/10/2012,97,,"Guelph, Canada",Amy D.,525,2.0,433,"While cabbing in from the airport to our hotel we passed Stone Street coffee company, and it caught my attention amongst all of the other storefronts of nearby cafes.  We went to it the next day and ordered two iced lattes and a macaron.  The barista was super friendly, and very helpful.  He informed me that all of their baked goods were made in house.  That convinced me to try a macaron, it had a vibrant green hue, was quite large, and crisp, it was a perfect macaron.  The coffee however is meh, it just didn't give me the jolt of espresso.Overall i would go back to sample more of their sweets, but next time i might try a hot beverage instead.",
54,,10/9/2011,0,2,"New York, NY",Bart S.,3,2.0,12,"I've only been to this place once (I try to go at least twice to give new places a fair chance) but had the same experience as some of the other people with the service being rude. I wanted to know what kind of coffee they had and the guy just walked away, poured me a shot of coffee and handed it to me. That didn't really answer my question since all I saw in the window was espresso coffee (not to mention the fact that there wasn't any milk/sugar at the window for me to make the coffee how I like it) and most places have a few kinds for you to choose from.The entire conversation was like this. He would only answer in a short, unfriendly way and didn't look at me. Also I finally just told him I do want the coffee and he got annoyed at me for saying I want it fine ground instead of telling him what machine I have (I just like mine ground finer). So now he was planning on pulling out the expert card, when he didn't even want to tell me what kind of coffee they have?",

56,1,5/2/2013,319,,"Hoboken, NJ",Mario D.,85,4.0,113,Great coffee on the way to work and love the street window so you don't need to go inside.  They are also have the belly rewards if you have the app to gain points for checking in there.,
57,,4/11/2015,2,,"Magnolia, NJ",M L.,6,1.0,24,This is my second time here in 1 year and the coffee isn't anything special . Second time it tasted weak and bitter ... None of that aroma . It also depends on the person making your brew if they are passionate about it or not.,
58,,1/18/2013,106,,"Cape May, NJ",Emily P.,13,4.0,135,"Super adorable, friendly baristas who will accommodate anything you'd like! Try an americano or a dirty chai latte! Perfect!",
59,,9/19/2011,52,,"Brooklyn, NY",James R.,0,4.0,441,"think a bunch of these reviews are for the adjacent bar not the coffeeshop.  I was excited to find this place this morning, had great service and a good cup of french press, and really like the window concept - fast and convenient on the way to work.  so off to a good start for me at least.",4

61,,8/30/2011,116,,"Brooklyn, NY",D H.,4,5.0,59,Get the cortado - perfectly creamy and tasty! Cute little coffee spot with a to-go window and pastries. This neighborhood needed it!,2
62,,6/13/2012,382,,"Boston, MA",Heather G.,46,5.0,670,"Best cup of coffee I've had in New York thus far.Because this place is tiny, they have one person working the counter and they can get a little backed up.  It took about 15 minutes to get my order, start to finish.  However, they have a cute little walk-up window for nice summer days so you can just wait outside while your coffee is made.They have a small but delicious array of pastries, and their coffee is HIGH OCTANE.  Very strong.  Great, considering the price is a bit steeper than other coffee houses, but I don't mind paying $1 more for a cup of joe that is the caffeine equivalent of three elsewhere!Though it's located just down the street from Chelsea Market, a decently-tourist-frequented and busy location, for some reason this place isn't mobbed like Starbucks. It seems able to maintain its coffee-culture, Seattle-like feel.",
63,,7/19/2012,24,,"Manhattan, NY",Gabriel H.,289,4.0,160,"Very good coffee on the west side. I enjoy their americano a lot.  They also use Belly card for their stamp card, which is a very cool company and a very cool take on the idea.",
64,,11/8/2011,980,,"Los Angeles, CA",Karl W.,6,5.0,43,"I had the MOST amazing latte here yesterday. The sign is right, they DO have the best milk!!! It's farm fresh daily and you can taste the difference! The girl was very nice and I loved the walk up window. I am about to go back to meet a friend there now.",1
65,,11/14/2011,2,,"Alameda, CA",Bruce K.,1,5.0,23,"If you are an espresso freak as I am, stop by Stone Street Coffee. It had rich crema, intense flavor, and was light like whipped egg whites or foammed milk .",1
66,,11/29/2011,0,,"Pinetop, AZ",Amy H.,1,5.0,5,"I had the best mocha latte here on Thanksgiving afternoon after a perfect stroll on The Highline. The mocha is made with ganache. The Real Thing, this mocha was. And, while the barrista was making the latte I just casually mentioned how fun latte art was and, he didn't have to, but he finished my mocha with a picture-perfect Turkey Day leaf! Fun and delicious!",1
67,,2/19/2012,14,,"New Haven, CT",Julie L.,61,3.0,130,"Cute place, fun vibe, yummy coffee (that you can get either inside or at the take-out window! cute!), but a bit steep of a price for a cup o' joe, in my opinion.",
68,,11/25/2011,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Adam C.,0,2.0,16,"I just had a coffee here and it was weak, and tasteless.  In my opinion they need to focus less on the ""Japanese Style"" coffee etc and just make a decent cup of COFFEE.Learn to walk before you can run guys, good luck.",
69,,3/21/2012,3,1,"Manhattan, NY",Anna F.,0,4.0,2,"I dropped by here late in the evening after a freezing tour of the art galleries in the neighborhood and a walk along riverside park earlier this winter.  But this place was a treat to drop into to warm up-- they had delicious scones that were properly crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside, served with whipped butter, and the cappuccinos were hot, with lots of froth and a cool design on top. The decor is also very unique-- there's large heavy wooden stools at the bar, and a couple tables with tree-trunk cut table tops on the side; overall dim lighting, burlap sacks of coffee, dim lighting, and a strong coffee smell. Since then its always been in the back of my mind as a place to drop into with a friend if were in the neighborhood.",1
70,,8/25/2011,0,,"Wantagh, NY",Audrey L.,0,4.0,3,"Walked upon this little coffee gem with 2 of my girlfriends one late morning.  Marcus, owner and coffee chemist, greeted us with warm, friendly vibes and made the most delicious coffee lattes ever!!  He insisted we let him create coffees for us without us telling him what we want, and what a surprise.... he nailed it perfectly!  He let us sample taste some tea beverages as well.  We sat on the stools and enjoyed our coffees with a few mini chocolate croissants.  Delicious!!  He really started off our morning with some good positive energy!   Since then I've made a special trip back to Stone Street Coffee when I was in the near by area.  Great coffee and very friendly service I must say!",
