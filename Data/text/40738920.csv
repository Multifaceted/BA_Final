0,Mike L.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,3,0.0,5.0,8/18/2018,Great laid-back bar. Rotating taps of craft beer digitally displayed with keg levels. Not a pretentious craft beer place at all. Typical bar menu options but everything I've tried has been at minimum a solid showing. Try the everything fries. Had a credit card mix-up and they were more than helpful and accommodating.,,,
1,Brittany M.,"New York, NY",2,64,128,4.0,10/21/2018,"Will definitely be returning to George Keeley next time I'm in need of a French fry fix & on the Upper West Side.Cool small bar, got here on a Mon night and ordered fries to go. The bar wasn't packed but every bar seat was taken and 2 tables were occupied as well. There was 1 waiter and 1 bartender that I saw.No one greeted me right away, but as soon as Bridgette the bartender saw me she acknowledged me. $8 for Garlic Fries well worth it. Apparently the fries are hand cut! So that's a major plus. Tasty and filling the garlic topping is garlic butter, parsley & Parmesan cheese. Fries not your typical crunchy, more on the soft flimsy side but packed with flavor.Very good. I ordered curry sauce on the side not necessary but a good compliment. They have other French fry options Truffle fries Curly Fries Everything Bagel  -- A must try Garlic FriesCurry Fries",,,
2,Rex K.,"Toronto, Canada",0,463,5,4.0,10/7/2018,"A great, fun bar in the Upper West Side that really specialises in draught beer. They have a huge selection, and cleverly have several TV screens detailing each keg, when it was tapped and how much is left in the keg, as well as descriptions of the beer's taste and style.I've always had a warm, friendly welcome from the staff every time I come, and find the atmosphere inside to be laid back and inviting. It's a great bar to hang out in and try many beers.",,,
3,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,78,73,4.0,10/7/2018,"GK has a special place in my cold, dark NYC heart - it's the first bar I ever went to after moving into the city in 2013. Even though I don't live as close to it as I did back then, I'll still come here every few weeks when I want a good beer in a low key environment.GK always has a quality selection of 20 or so beers on tap, with a variety that includes something for everyone. They also have wine and spirits, but I'd call them a beer bar above all else.Service is solid at the bar, usually very quick and friendly. It can be a little slower for table service, but still not too bad. Food is good as far as bars go, it'll do the trick if you're looking for something straightforward to eat. And there's free popcorn in the corner (self-serve) to hold you over while waiting for entrees, or just to munch on while you drink.TVs throughout the space, it's a good place to watch sports. Come here for a few beers with friends, or for a cold solo brew while watching the game.",,,
4,Mohun K.,"Enola, PA",107,274,309,5.0,6/29/2018,"Stopped in for the 1st time on 6/24 to watch some World Cup action.  22 beers on tap, many more in bottles, free popcorn, great service, and clean restrooms - not much more you can ask for in a neighborhood bar.    If I lived on the UWS, I would frequent this place often...",1,,1
5,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,4.0,3/24/2018,"Great Neighborhood BarI randomly stopped here because I had a bit of time to wait for the M7 bus - the bar is right in front of the bus stop. The clientele of the bar was very inviting (I randomly chatted with someone for about 45 minutes) and Mike, the bartender, was absolutely great. The bar has a pretty NYC Irish feel to with plenty of sports memorabilia scattered throughout the bar. Although I did not stay very long, I did appreciate the fact that George Keeley had a wide variety of beers on tap.Although I did not have too much to say about George Keeley, I think that I will visit again . . . especially if I have a long wait for the M7 bus.",,,
6,Damian M.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",43,182,119,5.0,3/11/2018,"Without a doubt this is my go-to bar on the UWS. Amazing selection of beer and great service. Gets very crowded on the weekends and during sports events, which they always have up on multiple big screens. Get there early for a good seat.",,,
7,Diego M.,"Springfield, NJ",295,138,270,5.0,6/4/2018,"I was really impressed with the outstanding draft and bottle selection of craft beers here.  Then I had something to eat: wowzers! I really did not expect the food to be THAT good. The bar gives off a chill almost divey vibe but doesn't serve like it. And the service is nice and fast as well! Not a date night spot per say, but maybe a 5th date when you both realize you like the same type of beers? Just an idea. I recommend it.",,,

9,Matthew S.,"Boston, MA",222,281,55,4.0,6/18/2018,"Visited George Keeley on a Saturday night for drinks with a few folks. This is a great bar. They have a very good selection of draft beer, and the digital menu boards provide a good level of detail about each of the different drafts, many of which are craft brews vs. mass market that can be had at any bar in America. Beer here ends up presented in the proper type of glass for the brew, too, which is great.",,,
10,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,3.0,12/26/2017,"George Keeley is the OG beer bar on the UWS.  I've heard about it for years, but hadn't tried it despite living up here for ~2 years.  Finally got the occasion recently when meeting a friend for a movie.  It looks like your typical Irish bar.  The only differentiator was the tap display on the big screen that showed how much of each beer was left.  In summary, lots of IPAs.  Nothing truly special on tap, just a who's who of beer bar staples: think Troegs, Brooklyn, Smutty Nose, plus the obligatory Other Half.  This may have flew for a beer bar 10 years ago, but with heavy hitters like Bondurants popping up and old standbys like Rattle & Hum stepping it up, this ain't cutting it anymore.Would come by again to give this another shot as it was totally fine, but I'm not rushing back as it wasn't anything special either.  Maybe the food is good too?  Service was decent but no different than your typical bar on the UWS.  Kind of confused considering the raves as this place certainly has its fanbase.  I say meh.",,,
11,Niamh D.,"Branchburg, NJ",30,75,0,3.0,3/29/2018,"We ate here for dinner after long day of sight seeing. Cute quaint pub but very small and only high tables, with two regular tables. We ordered the chicken wings with honey garlic flavor. My oldest son and husband thought while it was good, it could be better. Onwards to our main entrees; oldest son ordered chicken tacos, I ordered chorizo tacos and husband had fish tacos. First two tacos were decent, but unfortunately for my husband's tacos wasn't great. He took one bite of his fish tacos and it wasn't fresh at all. Left unfinished. The drinks were spot on though as hubby had several beers, and I had their GK mule. We had to bus our table though by returning our dirty empty plates back to the bar, which I thought wasn't really on.",1,,
12,Helen C.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",26,7,11,4.0,11/1/2017,"UPDATE: Rectified! This is the George Keeley I know and love. The two stars isn't because I don't love this place. I'm here often. But the service we've gotten tonight has just been so ridiculous.Last time I had a food order mixup, I was immediately offered a free drink. This time, we waited on mussels - their special event for the night - for 53 minutes. Mussels. The things you steam for 3 minutes and serve.It was already slow, but when our order was brought to the table, the server mistakenly took it away and sent it to another table. When she realized the mistake, she never told us or apologized. I had to walk over to her - two feet away from our table and doing nothing at the server station - to ask what was up. And then she tried to blame it on the fact that we moved tables, when we had originally been standing BY someone else's table because we didn't have one, and she'd already come taken another order from us at our current table. She offered a sarcastic apology and no other compensation. She'd told us the mussels came with their truffle fries - which I've had every time - and the fries were not truffled at all. I had to ask the man who brought our food to fix it, bless him. Our server is still nowhere in sight. I think she literally didn't realize fries =/= truffle fries. The only thing that kept me from a one star review is because Melissa's behind the bar today, and I love Melissa. Shout out to Melissa. The real MVP.",,,
13,Emily W.,"New York, NY",215,98,80,3.0,8/26/2017,"I went to George Keeley on a Thursday evening with two friends for dinner and drinks. We sat down at a table and our server came over pretty quickly. She was super friendly! The three of us ordered beers, and my friends split an order of wings while I got the grilled cheese with truffle fries. I didn't try the wings because I'm not really a wing person, but my friends were happily munching away so I assume they were good. Unfortunately, the grilled cheese I got was so disappointing. I was expecting it to be this greasy, calorie-filled delight, but it was the exact opposite. The Texas toast was so thick that it drowned out the cheese completely, and made it hard to eat (but I have a small mouth so that's not George Keeley's fault). There was also barely any butter on the toast, so it basically just tasted like two enormous slices of bread with a tiny bit a cheese stuck in the middle. I was also disappointed by the truffle fries. Now, I would consider myself a bit of an expert on truffle fries; my blood is probably 50% truffle oil at this point. These were not flavorful at all. I did really like the thickness and amount of friedness of the fries, but the truffle flavor was so faint. It probably could have been improved if they had sprinkled more parmesan on them, but they were so bland that I ended up eating the fries with ketchup, completely negating the truffle experience.All in all, this is a good place to get drinks! There are a lot of beers, and the people working there seem really great. I would not come here for food, however!",,1,
14,Steve A.,"Saint Paul, MN",20,23,3,4.0,2/26/2018,"Really good beer selection on an awesome LED display providing you not only with the brewery/beer name/type but also with the ABV, size of the pour and the remaining volume of that particular keg.Friendly bartender, multiple TVs above the bar which was nice with the Olympics on. Haven't tried the food yet but will give that a shot on my next trip back. I would recommend this place to any beer lover.Teachers in the area will want to take note that they now offer a Friday Happy Hour where teachers get 20% off their tab.",,,
15,Nick D.,"New York, NY",80,508,704,4.0,9/19/2016,"While apartment hunting on the UWS, I needed to find a place with food and NFL games. This place pretty much sums this up. They have about 10 HDTV's showcasing each game which is great for someone like me who likes to watch others outside the local teams. They have a giant TV behind the bar which displays which beers are on tap, and how much the keg has left. The beer list was pretty good with a lot of different styles for all to enjoy. We ordered the mixed basket, which is half orders of wings, jalapeño poppers, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, onion rings and curly fries. I would say this could feeds 2-3 people depending on your hunger. It's a nice healthy mix of your favorite bar good snacks. We also ordered the Belly Bangers which essentially 3 mini cheeseburger sliders. I thought these were pretty good too. GK's is definitely a place you want to be at during NFL Sunday. Good food, good beer, and plenty of games to watch.",2,,1

17,Emily L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",274,42,30,4.0,6/11/2017,"George Keeley is my ""regular"" bar on the UWS. GK offers an extensive menu of craft beers, pub food, and free popcorn! I first went to GK back during the 2016 presidential debates. Although they didn't play the sound I still enjoyed the atmosphere. Since then I've come to GK at least once a week give or take. I started the 100 beer challenge and have about 50 beers down. Another selling point is the staff. The bartenders are awesome and really make you feel like you're part of the GK community. I love when a bartender knows my tastes preferences and can advise me to a beer the moment I sit down. I wish GK was as close as Gerard's Beer Culture on 72, but it's worth the walk/subway ride up.",,,1

20,Amanda J.,"Washington, DC",1540,997,351,4.0,2/20/2017,"George Keeley is everything I normally don't look for in a bar.  I'm not a beer drinker, and I don't go to sports bars (Hence why I have limited interest in returning to the place of my birth, Pittsburgh, PA, unless the city keeps building the food and nightlife scene). However, the bartenders at George Keeley were really nice, and I could actually see myself coming back.I ordered the Original Sin Hard Cider (16 oz for $7), and I was so excited to have a local cider on tap!  There actually were some German beers that I enjoy too, but I just love myself some dry cider!  The prices were right, plus there was free popcorn.  It's incredibly salty, but it will give you something to munch on.  At midnight on a Friday night, there wasn't much sportsball happening, but it was nice to go to a bar where I could actually have a conversation with my friend.All in all, this isn't a neighborhood in New York that I pass through terribly often, especially not at midnight, but I would come back thanks to the nice bartenders and options.",3,1,5

22,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,3.0,12/12/2016,"Weekends are not my demographic. At. All. Mainly because after I turned 30, I became too old to be constantly jostled in unbearably loud, over-crowded bars. But my first time here was during the week, early evening and then it was just my speed. They have a lengthy selection of beers and a neat technologically proficient way of displaying them. But I don't drink beer so that's all I've got on that. Otherwise, it's a full service bar with nice appointments. I found the raised seating in the back perfect for reading, interspersed with blatant people watching. And it's right next to the free popcorn machine. But I have a sneaking suspicion that they keep the basement hatch open to deter only the most brave of moochers. If the crowd was like the mid-week crowd all the time, I'd become a regular. I was over the frat-bro thing back in the late 90s, but don't let that stop you.",10,6,6

28,Mark L.,"Castle Shannon, PA",69,690,290,4.0,10/25/2015,"This is an excellent bar for connoisseurs of craft beer. A others have noted, it is similar to the Pony Bar, which I also really like, though this bar has more televisions and seems to try a little more to be a sports bar. I had an excellent oatmeal stout, the kind of beer that is difficult to find at most bars. The service was very good, and in the late afternoon on a Saturday it was somewhat crowded but I could still find a seat at the bar. It was maybe a little too noisy for my tastes. It looks like it's a real popular place, and the crowd seemed a little on the young side. They have several screens of good high definition quality playing different games. While I was there college football games were on the different screens. If you want to watch a game, this would be a decent place to go. The beers are posted in an electronic sign behind the bar that lets you know how much of each beer remains in the cask. That's a nice feature. There were about 20or so craft beers listed on this sign. The sign gives you all the information you need, like ABV and the pouring size.",,,
29,Dave M.,"Manhattan, NY",121,3,0,2.0,4/28/2017,"I guess most of these good reviews are probably based on the beer selection, which is good.Unfortunately, their food falls way short. Hot wings were weird. Tasted re-heated and had texture like they were baked or just not cooked properly. Mac n' cheese was SO bland. You could tell they didn't boil the pasta with salted water or even bother to season the sauce. Tasted like water.If you're looking for edible water, skip the $9 mac and go pick up a $2 bag of ice at the bodega.",,1,

36,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,10/15/2015,"4.5 stars. Simply put, this is a craft beer haven disguised as a sports bar. Don't get me wrong - it's my favorite place to watch big games on the UWS. But that's largely because of what's on tap on any given day. Whoever you are, Mr. Keeley, you done good.Space first. This place isn't particularly big, so it gets crowded FAST. I don't even bother trying to come here on Sundays during football season. There's nothing particularly remarkable about the layout/decor here - that said, I might be completely unaware of my surroundings due to excessive excitement about the draft list. Beer. Brews. Brewskis. Suds (that last one I just looked up, felt like I needed a fourth). Like Pony Bar, George Keeley's displays its draft list electronically, its heavenly glow lighting up the  dimly-lit establishment. When I came here last night, there were 23 beers on tap. 23! They've got a good mix of international and domestic beers, though I'd say the menu typically favors the latter. Props for supporting the local breweries! Last night, they were doing some sort of pumpkin event, so they had upwards of five different pumpkin beers on tap. Not only that, they were serving these beers...IN PUMPKINS. Sadly they ran out by the time we got there, but watching people imbibe via pumpkin was a ridiculous and awesome experience. Of the beers I've tried here, my favorite was the ""Of Love & Regret"" by Stillwater Artisanal. Rich, complex, notes of lavender and chamomile (apparently), absolutely glorious. Shout out to the bartender last night for the recommendation. Like all good craft beer bars, they'll give you a taste of whatever you'd like here - so don't be shy in asking! One more note about the beer that deserves its own paragraph. What differentiates George Keeley from Pony Bar (I find the two very similar) is the simple yet brilliant feature of displaying how much is left of each beer on tap. I'm not sure how much this actually influences a patron's decision, but I happen to think its a great idea. Some of my favorite craft beer spots will disappoint me at times with the unfortunate news that they've run out of the beer I just ordered. At Keeley's you won't run into the conundrum.While the food here is not nearly as impressive as the beer selection, it's still quite good. If your company doesn't care about bad breath, give the Everything Bagel fries a try. Everything bagel seasoning is delicious. Fries are delicious. Why not? Other things I've tried (pictured): the Fish Tacos (grilled haddock and jalepeno slaw w/ chipotle mayo) and the Nachos (all your typical fixings - we swapped the chili out for chicken, but in retrospect I think I would've been very happy sticking with chili). Both decent. If I had to choose one over the other, I'd probably opt for the nachos. Beer: A+. Food: B+. Service: B- (This past visit, our waitress gave us some serious attitude initially but she lightened up as the night went on - or maybe we just could tolerate her more after a few beers - one or the other. Jokes aside, I do think it was the former). No question, this is one of the best bars on the Upper West Side.",11,7,7

In order to get over my misery, I hung out with my two best friends, Bud and Light. This is a run-of-the-mill bar. There's nothing special about it. It's small and cramped.There wasn't that much to do other than to watch TV or joke around with your friends. Practically all of the patrons were white (not that I have a problem with that). The bartenders were cool. I had two drinks while I watched a Mets game (there was nothing else on). I didn't have anything to eat so I can't comment about that. . I didn't come here with the intention of meeting women (although that would've been nice). I just came to pass the time. I neither liked nor disliked this bar.",,6,
47,Damon T.,"New York, NY",4,49,77,3.0,10/25/2015,"While Im sure most of the reviews youll read about this place pertain to their extensive craft beer offerings, Ill state that mine is strictly food related. I only gave it 3 stars based on the great service I received and the fact that I loved the sports bar atmosphere. I think literally every football game that couldve been on was being shown. The Jets and Patriots fans really livened the place up.Now about the food. Should I return (which I will to try the beers), I have to say that I was disappointed. My burger was just blah, bacon was cooked medium well and they put enough lettuce on it to allow me to make a side salad. I didnt really have anything noteworthy taste-wise that would make me want to return for another. Another downer was the way they cooked the fries. They wee shoe string style but were fried to a crisp almost burnt texture. Ive never been a fan of crunchy fries...crisp yes, but these were tough little potato chips. I didnt taste it so I wont bother including what my company said about the chicken sandwich but lets just say I will not order it when I return.All in all, I acknowledge that the food isnt what draws people here but you do want to eat something that tastes good while downing those beers dont you????",,,
48,Chanthel K.,"New York, NY",136,30,20,4.0,10/29/2016,I encountered this place when I first moved to NYC and I was looking for a place to watch European soccer. I decided to try the bacon cheddar burger which was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of my top 5 favorite burgers I have ever tried. The beer selection was awesome. They have multiple tv screens playing all types of sports games and two screens showing the beer selections. It also shows how much is left in the barrel as well as a better description of the beer. Overall a great place to either watch games or come with a few friends and eat some great burgers with amazing beers.,,,

Really enjoyable pub burger. The fries were good, too. My wife had the veggie quesadilla, which she enjoyed. The other orders were fish tacos and a veggie wrap. Everyone was pleased with their food. Service was good and the background music was great. Of course the beer selection if above average, which you can track on their website.

The curry fries are saucy, curried goodness in a basket. Just get them if that sounds remotely appetizing to you. You won't be disappointed. The truffle fries are crisp and flavorful. The wings are above average. Sometimes they will let you split the sauces and sometimes not. I think it just depends on the waiter you get and how lazy the cooks are feeling that day. When I can, I usually get half hot and half honey garlic. So let's talk about the burgers. If you're looking for something spicy, go for the Diablo Burger. Its spicy jalapeño relish and chipotle aioli provide a nice kick. If you're in the mood for something a little different, get The Melt. It might be my favorite burger at GK.",1,1,1

60,N. M.,"Queens, NY",67,199,615,4.0,4/8/2014,"Of all of the bars on the Upper West Side, George Keeley's remains my favorite. A very cool bar recently redone, but with the focus still on good beer. Their ever-rotating taps showcase a vast variety from all over the country and world, from New York to Alaska, from Germany to Japan. The staff are always nice and helpful and I have yet to have a bartender that is not knowledgeable in the beer department.As for the food, there are some items that are amazing and others that can be skipped. The cheese dip? Skip it. However, the burgers are really great and flavorful. I have a habit of drowning burgers in ketchup, but these are so good and simple that I don't even need a drop. The garlic fries are another favorite and I recommend having a side of honey mustard to dip them in. Oh and the wagon wheel mac and cheese hits the spot. Overall a great low-key hangout, great beer some good food and always a fun time.",8,3,4
61,Matthew L.,"Queens, NY",352,309,304,3.0,3/16/2014,"Oh George Keeley's and your free popcorn! Whoever thought to provide popcorn from a popcorn machine is a genius! Gives us drunkards something salty to nosh on, which makes us thirstier, which makes us drink more. Yep, thought of that all by myself. You can literally walk up to the machine at the side of the bar, and scoop your own bowl of popcorn. Unless you're not supposed to do that and I've just been breaking the rules O_OThey've got a decent beer selection with about 12 taps with a couple of standards (Guinness) and a bunch of craft brews. There are also a bunch of nooks and crannies around the bar for seating that can make it suddenly intimate in a loud bar. I don't venture to the Upper West much anymore, but George Keeley's is probably my favorite in the area. A no non-sense bar that's about you, your drink, your company/crew/posse, and free popcorn!",8,6,5

The bartender was very attentive, and gave me a menu and took my order right away. She also offered me another drink before I was done with my first one- that's freakin service! At the same time I didn't feel rushed. As soon as I was done eating she took my plate away and let me nurse my second drink and read. The food was solid, I ordered the Diablo burger with no cheese and garlic fries. The burger comes with pickled jalapeño relish, raw onion, and chipotle aioli. Unfortunately all those things tasted sweet, not spicy, and there was no hint of chipotle. The fries were also rock hard. Not stale, just too crispy for my liking. It was still a decent meal and I left full and happy, but I'd try something different next time.They were playing a little of everything, including the Beastie Boys and Johnny Cash.",1,1,1

Hell yeah! His website is also really nice in sharing with you how much beer of each type he has left on tap so you know if this place has what you're looking for. Both of these are A+ in my book.The only issue is that when we tried to order the moody tongue lemon saison and the TV screen showed that it should still have an abundant amount left, the bartender told us it was kicked. Something you should look into regarding the accuracy of your systems. Other than that, the bartender was super friendly who always served us with a smile and a thank you.

94,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1404,1149,1019,3.0,8/20/2015,"This bar looked inviting so we headed in around 1 am on a Friday night. The coolest thing about this bar was how they displayed their draft beers. They had large television screens indicating every beer that was on tap, their ABV, style and a picture of a keg showing how much left there was. Cool concept, although, I don't really care how much is left in a keg, if it's kicked it's kicked. Not sure if this method is to get people to drink faster because they see that the beer they've been drinking all night is about to be kicked. The screen changed every 10 seconds or so because there were too many draft beers to have them all displayed on the screen at one time. That was a tad annoying because I needed more than 10 seconds to check out each screen. They had beer menus on the tables with a list of bottles but they had bottles that weren't on this list too so it was a bit of a guessing game. It took a little bit longer than it should have to grab one of the bartenders attention to order a beer. There were three people back there and I had to stand there for some time, plus the bar wasn't busy. When we were helped, however, the bartender was really nice. Didn't charge us for a club soda which was nice change from the previous bar that charged us $5. There were tables alongside the wall and then high top bars with stools in front of the windows at the front. The windows were open and the night was beautiful. It was the best compromise for not having outdoor seating. 5 minutes into enjoying a beer in the window, the bouncer came over and told us he needed to close the windows because they were receiving noise complaints. Seriously??? In the city that never sleeps!? What the heck is that about? It's NYC for goodness sakes and the bar was as tame as mellow as could be. We finished our beer and left.

But since we were at the nearby Museum of Natural History, and we liked the reviews and menu, we thought we'd try it. We were not disappointed. It was fairly quiet this afternoon, and it felt like the kind of pub I'd want in my own neighborhood. The beer list was impressive - something for everybody. Everybody liked their burgers. I had to unhinge my jaw to have any chance at my Double Smokehouse Burger. It was actually 2 burgers with a layer of pulled pork in-between, topped with pickles and onion rings. The previous night, some of us had dined at a Red Robin. The person in my party who had their signature burger there ordered the Breakfast Burger here (i.e., with the egg), and it was better as were the fries.All I can think about my dinner at Red Robin last night is that while it was okay, it reminded me of why I prefer places like this!",2,,

It's kind of small, and I haven't been there on a weekend when I'm sure it gets really busy, but it's a great place to grab a few beers and some food.Another reason to come here is the food. It's pretty standard bar options but the burgers and wings were great.

Okay, a close second is the endless free popcorn that you can take right out of their popper. Six bowls in with my friends and I was still going strong, saltiness be damned!3.) Darts! Some people throwing them are pros and it's fun to cheer them on. The others are drunk girls in sequined tank tops. 4.) Their jukebox has ""The Shape of My Heart"" by Backstreet Boys. Lucky for us, my friends and I were able to play it just before Last Call, at 3:50 a.m. We were not embarrassed, but the bartender was embarrassed for us, stopped the song, and gave my friend his dollar back. (All in good fun...)I'm not sure how this place is on most Saturday nights, as this review pertains to my one and only visit to this fine, FINE establishment. My experience has it clearing out a lot by about 12:30, 1 a.m., and then it was just chill and a little bit fantastic until 4 a.m. No complaints from me. It's no wonder my Upper West Side friends frequent this bar. You'll see me back there someday, Magner's in one hand, me throwing a dart ""girly style"" with the other, mouth full of popcorn like a beast. No shame.",1,2,

We always seem to find a table. They have a number of TVs with sports, and are always happy to accommodate putting on a game for you even if it's not a local team. Lastly, they have the best pub food around. You can not go wrong with the ""Feel Good Chicken"" wrap with a side of garlic fries, or any of their burgers.

None like this place.  The beer selection is solid. The free popcorn is killer.  The people working the bar are awesome.

Many say it is the fantastic selection of beers on tap, in bottles, from all over the world.  Others will say it is a great place to watch sports, especially football on Sundays.  Some will say it is the food; after all, their burger could be compared to the BEST in the city. And you can't ignore the freshly popped popcorn, or the great music (I prefer when they play it themselves, instead of letting the jukebox take over).  What makes it the best, though, is the staff. You won't be able to find better bartenders in the city! Not only will they make you feel like you belong, but they provide the best service and set the tone for the whole place.",1,,

Very chill atmosphere, great craft beer selection, not too loud for conversation (it was a Monday night though), and darts. For decor, dollar bills adorned much of the bar area itself, and tin brewing company signs covered part of the ceiling. Really open space for a large standing room crowd, but we had no problems finding seats and getting cozy. We didn't try anything from the food menu, but did indulge in one of my favorites- Stone Imperial Stout. I believe they had about 20 or more beers on tap. Very diverse offering as well. The only downside to the evening, towards the end, were the two drunk twentysomething girls and a guy that kept busting our ass about being next on the dart board after our game. They came up to us three times during the same game telling us they were next but to go ahead and take our time, then continued to keep making comments behind us. Ah, I remember my first beer. This was no fault of the establishment of course, but we did leave early because of this, so it was worth noting.

The free popcorn (that's very salty) is also an excellent addition--that is, if you can push through the crowd to get some!This bar does have tables for people to sit down, but when we were here they were mostly dominated by the same people. We arrived around 9:30 and they were full through the time we left (around 1 am). We were able to score a standing table by the entrance, but it was very crowded. They also have TVs all over the place which is pretty nice. Also, no credit card minimum!

They didn't skimp on the ceiling either, which is very common where I'm from...    The first thing I noticed was the huge ""Beer on Tap"" chalkboard on the wall.  It was easily readable from far away, yet blended in well enough to not look out of place.  On it were a couple dozen beers listed by name, alcohol content and price.  It made ordering a breeze, and the selection was great.  Numerous things on there that you'll have a tough time finding even in a bottle at another bar. (Delerium Tremens, Weheinstephaner Heffweise, Lake Placid, Dogfish Head 90 Min IPA come to mind. Delerium Tremens is one of my favorite beers of all time - delicious and it comes in at a whopping 9% av., which explains the name and the pink elephant..)  They started a tab for us without a card and without us asking, which seemed odd, but it was nice not having to get out my wallet in between beers.  I'll definitely be back.  I only wish I lived closer so I could join the 200 pint club!",1,1,

It's like what I imagine a McDonald's cheeseburger tasted like at the original McDonald's before it became more like a manufactured substance than food. Oh it is so good. And the sweet potato fries are not bad either.The only issues I have with George Keeley's are that there are no waiters so if you want to order even when you're sitting at a table you have to go to the bar. That is confusing and weird. And sometimes they turn the music up way too loud even on a random Monday night, and that is annoying. It is my favorite neighborhood bar, not a club.

I'm willing to go uptown for it.The food is pretty good pub stuff (they even have fried pickle spears!), the crowd is refreshingly genuine, the service quite friendly. It all adds up to a lovely experience for a casual time with friends and beers, etc. These are a few of my favorite things- The rest are downtown.",2,4,1

I'm still trying to figure out the reason as to all the amazing reviews this place has gotten. I stopped in because I read that they had really good wings and Brother Jimmy's was closed at the time. Way better wings there. The wings here were average at best. They didn't even give me any drums from the wings, only the wing parts. The drums are usually the best part of buffalo wings. That was kinda lame. If it was decent bar food they would deliver. This place does not deliver. Having to walk all the way here on the assumption that they had good wings but only finding out that the wings were just mediocre was kind of a pain. Still perplexed over the hubbub for this joint. Maybe the other food is decent or they have special drink deals. Who knows? All I know is that it seemed to be just another bar on Amsterdam avenue the is a cookie-cutter of all the other bars on Amsterdam avenue. Keep walking. Nothing to see here.",,1,

I usually spend about $6-$8 a beer.3) Free popcorn: Free popcorn!4) Darts5) Great bartenders and wait staff6) Above average quality barfood with a hint of creativity.7) Not so hard to get a table but it's not dead either.8) Inexpensive and good restaurants nearby.Like I said, I go here after work to unwind and get a good buzz before dinner.

I take my beer seriously.Instead, they have an amazing selection of real beers like the new Honker's Ale from Chicago (a new favorite of mine), Toasted Lager, and a Delirium Tremens Belgian Ale amongst many others. The prices are not bad either with my Honker's Ale clocking it at $6 a pint. That's impressive for an actual ale that is not mass-produced. The alcohol percentage is displayed prominently next to the name on handy chalk boards above and by the bar (and in pretty colors!). Plus, a never-ending supply of free popcorn. You can't go wrong with popcorn and delicious beer.I've never had a bad time at Keeley's. You can sit at the bar, a high table in the corner, or at some tables against the wall. There's a dart board near the back, and the staff there are always friendly and generous. Even that bathrooms were clean at 2am! I'm impressed. Last night I played Gin Rummy with my girlfriend and two other friends for *hours* and no one bothered us. I recall another time that I met the same group plus another friend or two and we were sitting at the bar. Again, a fantastic time was had by all.

It all boils down to the beer selection. A good bar, especially in a diverse city like NYC, should have a diverse offering of beers. And I don't mean all your obvious options, like Corona, Guiness, Bud, Miller and such. I mean, craft beers, small brewer beers, and beers that you can brag to your friends about. Speaking of bragging, I'd like to toot my own horn for trying the 120 Minute IPA by Dogfish Head. This beer comes in at 18% ABV, some major kick, but still managed to remain tasty, drinkable, and smooth. I was thoroughly impressed. So much so, that I had two, which after already having a few drinks at other bars, proved to be my downfall.Let's just say the hangover I had the next day at work was regrettable. But still, I enjoyed this place, liked the friendly service, and of course, would return for the great selection of beer. Oh yeah, and the free popcorn is certainly a plus.

So old school I'm not even sure there was a time when this kind of establishment was new school.Look, I've never been to Ireland so I don't know what I'm talking about. Ever, really. Is this place even Irish?There are so many phony Bud -Light-serving tourist-fest dive bars masquerading as ""Irish Pubs"" in this city that I don't even know what an Irish Pub is anymore. What I do know is that it's refreshing to go to a place that gets all the basics right: homely, warm atmosphere, a complete lack of pretension, a fantastic beer selection, perfect hot wings and great classic entrees (like their steak sandwich!) that are so simple yet delicious you have to wonder how anyone screws them up. Did I mention they have Delirium, Honkers and Leffe on tap? Well, they do.You can't keep going to these mixology bars for the rest of your life, girl. You need variety.

Given their broad beer selection, you'd think I like this place A LOT, but I don't. I think it's because I've never had fun there. It may be the UWS location, it may be the crowd, it may be that their beer selection, while extensive, is deceivingly actually not that great. I think the problem, most tellingly, is that I'm struggling for some interesting tidbits that would be helpful for a review, but I just can't seem to find anything. Oh wait - I've got something - free popcorn.",,1,
