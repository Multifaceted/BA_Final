0,Go B.,"Westwood, CA",62,258,9696,4.0,10/6/2018,"Decided to venture out of my usual eating spots for lunch in Battery Park and take a short walk to Tribeca.I heard about TG (and its well-known owners - got to see Andy Serkis there), so on my list to try.Solid New American restaurant (impressed with their wine list, especially Burgundy wines, my fav.).Moderately priced lunch menu.Enjoyed many of their dishes (the standout ones were the grilled octopus, roasted rainbow beets, and jumbo lump crab cake).Only dish that I didn't enjoy was their NY strip (too much connective tissues making for a tough steak to cut through, let alone chew).Service - excellentRecommend: 8 calendarsNote:  They offer an interesting special 'burger and burgundy'  - Order a bottle (Selection of some nice, reasonably priced burgundy wines) and get a free burger. Going to try that next.",5,1,4
1,Garynn N.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,116,130,3.0,10/28/2018,"On decor and atmosphere alone, this place gets 5 stars. It's a very inviting set-up whether it's for after work drinks or dinner.I recently went here for happy hour to meet with my sis. She had been dying to try it so I gave in. We sat at the bar and ordered happy hour wine and a number of small plates/apps from the happy hour menu. We had the grilled octopus, chicken fingers, buffalo mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and a cheese plate. The grilled octopus was my favorite--served on a bed of some type of red pilaf rice like grain. Unfortunately the chicken fingers had zero flavor. It came with what was supposed to be a dipping sauce I was hoping would help, but it was basically ketchup so I ended up feeling like I was a kid eating bad nuggets with ketchup. The buffalo mozzarella was okay, but the quality of the prosciutto was not that impressive to me. I did enjoy the cheese selection they offered but I suppose that's harder to mess up.All in all it was a decent experience. Service at the bar was fine, not exceptional. And no it wasn't crowded at all at the time so that wasn't the excuse.I doubt I will go back for anything other than drinks but it's a food place to catch up with friends.",,,
2,James M.,"Denver, CO",1,58,8,1.0,10/25/2018,Horrible food. It really is overpriced for what you get. Tasted like it came off the back of a food truck rather than being responsibly sourced. Yuck.,3,1,
3,Staten Island E.,"Staten Island, NY",8,105,275,3.0,10/21/2018,"Nice atmosphere, very good service but average food! I have to admit that I was disappointed with this Restaurant.We ordered salads for appetizer and it was  pretty good. For entree we had the duck, scallops and NY Strip Steak. The duck was ok and scallops were  very good, presentation was beautiful. But the steak was a let down. If I am paying 45 dollars for a steak (which is fine for Manhattan prices) I hope they will serve me a decent cut.The meat was cooked medium as requested but hard as hell. I guess they got their meat in a local deli or supermarket - - - so disappointing!",2,1,1
4,Jasmin S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",30,1,2,5.0,10/7/2018,"Was in the area looking at school and remembered that Robert De Niro has his restaurant in Tribeca so my family and I went to go try it out. It was amazing. Our server was so kind and helpful and very patient. My family and I are VERY picky eaters and I must say the food was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the pan roasted salmon, the Amish chicken with the cheeseburger. Overall a 10/10 experience. Followed by dessert of the chocolate cake and it was rich and flavorful that it was a legit an explosion on chocolate in my mouth. I've never appreciated it more so to speak. My family and I went in the early afternoon so it was a bit quieter but it was so relaxing in here. Overall the ambiance is very nice and I cannot express it more that Robert De Niro outdid himself with the food.",1,,

7,Roger T.,"Boston, MA",45,333,76,1.0,10/25/2018,Place is gross.  All hype like many NYC wanna be restaurants playing on their owners fame in another industry.  Seats and table were still filthy.  Barely wiped it at all.  Very old and stale inside.  Our Cousin saw a mouse in the dining room when we were departing.

Updated review","The 2000's called and they want their food back. While the room is pretty, it needs a reboot, but even more so the food is classic, but boring. The piece of bread and butter feels like its from another era. The brash service at the bar is just unacceptable.Ate: roast Amish chicken $29Chicken was good, with mashed and peas. I wouldn't come back for mediocre food and grumpy bar service.",10,2,2
10,Petrina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,146,714,4.0,12/12/2017,"I love holiday parties! I took a holiday stroll through the restaurant entrance to the top floor - amazingly clean and the employees are very polite. From the door the servers began with flatbread, lamb meat balls, cheese balls, crab cakes and cheeseballs. The only complaint was there were too many of us hovering over the servers to get more. We had extra-large group 40 plus people. They still did an amazing job getting it to us and bringing the food out asap. On to the food....OMG! Delicious starter salad, Fillet mignon with mash potatoes and pumpkin cheesecake. The server assigned to us, Amanda did a great job making sure we were all happy with the food and she always came by to refill our drinks. The question is - would I return on my own? Sure the heck will. Enjoy Tribeca Grill - I DID!",,,
11,Big M N.,"Medford, NJ",1,47,3,2.0,10/26/2018,"I was not a big fan.  I brought a client here because he was a De Niro fan.  On first entering, the place was Gorgeous but the experience went down hill from there. The server was very inattentive and was difficult to find when drinks were empty (which was constantly). I found the food to be very over priced for the quantity and quality of the food. I had the filet mignon which was over cooked and under seasoned (come on.  Salt and pepper is not that hard). For dessert I had the creme brûlée which was average to good (sadly it was the highlight of the meal).Overall you go here because of your you are star struck with De Niro.  Out side of that, it's not a place I would go to again. Even my client was very disappointed but was appreciative that at least it wasn't a meal he had to pay for!!",,,

13,Jae R.,"Manhattan, NY",304,213,761,3.0,8/11/2017,"Maybe it was because I went here for the Restaurant Week, but the experience overall was okay but I was underwhelmed.We went there for lunch. The restaurant week special offered a three-course meal for $29. For my app, I had the beets, but the flavor was bland. My friend's caesar salad, which came with anchovy caesar dressing, was actually pretty good. However, the entrees were just okay. I got the chicken. The meat was moist, but the crust was too crispy and thick only one side, and the sauce was too sweet.  My friend got the cold poached salmon. But cold salmon didn't quite gel, not to mention, I'm not too used to fully cooked salmon. The cucumber sauce was refreshing and fitting for summer, but it was not quite enough to save the dish.I think I want to try it again for a regular fare, but for the restaurant week itself, I think there is room forImprovement.",2,,1

I had the spicy lamb meatballs - which for the record weren't spicy at all, but still delicious. As was the lamb pasta my friend got, and the salmon tartare. As far as dessert goes, you can't go wrong with any of them on the menu, they were all scrumptious. Our party had a sundae, a slice of chocolate cake, and some kind of banana tart with flambeed bananas on top. I'm a sucker for caramelized bananas. The cocktails were nothing crazy, but they were good, no complaints here. Overall a nice place to take simple friends. That aren't to adventorous with their culinary experiences.",,,
15,Mandee P.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,186,4.0,12/5/2017,"My team decided to have our Holiday lunch here today and the restaurant was very accommodating with the ~40 person reservation with a 2 weeks notice. My first impression was the place was very nice looking. I enjoyed the lighting and open feel. The bathrooms are kind of scary in the sense that you have to seemingly leave the building and go down to a basement. I found myself questioning if I was going the wrong way the entire time. I felt like I was trespassing. Either way that's not at all a strike against the restaurant. It was just weird. We had a prefix choice for lunch. I ordered the arugula/mozzarella/tomato salad, followed by an veal, lamb, bacon fettuccini ragu, and finished off with a creme brûlée. My salad was pretty good, no complaints there. The Ragu had a good flavor to it and tasted like fresh pasta. The creme brûlée was my favorite. It's one of the best I've had. The service was great. Everyone was kind and despite how I drink water like a fish, they always kept my cup full. Food did take a while. We arrived at 12:30 and received dessert at 3. I can't really be too tough on them though because it was a lot of people! I can't imagine the craziness in the kitchen trying to get 40 plates out at once. Overall I enjoyed it.",,,
16,Michael C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",189,6,0,2.0,2/23/2018,"Seated outside, service became less attentive over the course of the night to the point where we had to ask the busser for our check and subsequently bring said check to the host.The food's high ticket price is laughable given it was served at room temperature and lacked any seasoning whatsoever.Both front and back of house are asleep at the wheel.

Douche bags all the way up to the owner I been here once before and thought they were having a off night. Everyone deserves a second chance so when my colleague suggested we go there I was apprehensive but agreed. What a mistake that was. If your in the city don't waste you time or money in this dump. The only thing worth anything in here is the bar from Maxwells Plums and trust me this is far from a Maxwell Plums.

Below the mark on some fronts (terrible bread, mediocre service, fine menu). I was so disappointed because there is a such a hype associated with TriBeCa Grill.

23,Michele A.,"Bellmore, NY",44,83,18,3.0,9/24/2017,"I had such high hopes for this place.  Met some friends for dinner last night.  We were a little early, so we sat at the bar for a round of drinks.  My hubby had to use the restroom, so he gave me a $20 and left for me to wait for our drinks to arrive.  When they came, and the check, I giggled out loud.  My husband asked me what was so funny...told him to put the 20 away and break out the credit card.  $40 for one round of drinks.  Dirty Martini and Vanilla Stoli and ginger in case you are wondering.On to the food, I ordered the lobster cavatelli.  I was underwhelmed with the portion size, but it was a tasty dish.  Hubby got the pork chop, and I knew as soon as it was placed in front of him, it was the homerun dish of the meal.  It was amazing.  Perfectly cooked, and such great flavor.  He actually said it was the best pork chop he every had.  Just wished there was another one.We split a piece of the chocolate cake for dessert, and it was pretty amazing.  The couple we were with had the brownie sundae.  It was literally 2 little pieces of brownie, and I am not sure if they put it under a heat light or made it and let it sit, but all of the ice cream was completely melted.  It was more of a soup than sundae.Look, I understand restaurants in NYC are expensive, and I can deal with that, but when the prices are so high and the food does not knock it out of the park beginning to end, I really hate to waste my money.As the service goes, I could hardly hear the waitress she was so soft spoken.  She got us water right away, but never took drink orders.  We had to order everything at once.  Again, not a deadly sin, but I am paying top dollar....show me a little love.The ambiance of this place is beautiful, and the view of the freedom tower is amazing.  Bottom line, not horrible, but probably not returning.",,,

37,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,483,1214,3.0,10/13/2017,"3.5 stars. After a viewing of an indie flick at the Tribeca Screening Room, a few of us decided to come here for drinks/food tonight.. I had already eaten prior to the viewing, but was able to squeeze in an appetizer.There were 5 of us and at the start, it seemed like an eternity to get some water let alone a wait staff employee to swing by. Service was pretty sluggish at first.Once they did come by, service became more consistent. The table placed their order for apps (to share) and entree. I was content with a glass of wine and appetizer to myself.My app served as my main and I selected the grilled octopus which was accompanied by some beans (lima?) and on a bed of black squid ink. I chose a glass of Reisling to accompany it.The rest of the table selected meatballs and octopus to share and pasta for main (with pesto, lobster sauce and Bolognese). They also drank wine.Verdict?While the flavors/ aroma of the apps and main  were distinct and delicious, I really didn""t have to be concerned about getting too full ( I should add that we also received a warm dinner roll to start).In other words, the portions really raised my eyebrows. My selection was one thin 5 inch octopus strip and honestly for $18, it was laughable. Everything else brought to the table smelled good but again, the portions were skimpy.The group was also feeling dessert of which a pumpkin cheesecake and blackout cake was ordered. I didn't taste either.So yes, while the food appeared and tasted good, there just wasn't much of it.Luckily, I had a first dinner since I walked out paying $40 for one appetizer and a glass of wine (including tip/tax). Could probably consider it a dessert.Btw, ambiance was lovely.",,,

While getting through an episode of ""Beat Bobby Flay"" I came up on this dude who worked at Tribeca Grill and had what seemed like an AWESOME novel approach to the crabcake: jumbo lump crabcake with a Scotch egg surprise!The real surprise though is that the crab cake at Tribeca Grill when I went was...just a crab cake. Imagine my disappointment after having made reservations for the first available brunch on a Sunday and then being greeted by the lackluster service that followed. The decor was pretty awesome though and it had a real classy vibe, so I thought to myself, ""Well I'll try something else and it'll probably be solid,"" but boy was I wrong. Got a plain old (quite literally unfortunately) burger and it came out overcooked (I ordered it medium and it came out well done) aaaaand it was literally a hunk of meat between two pieces of bread -- without a fleck of garnish or accompaniment of the vegetable kind.

And he asked where we were going and I said I'm going back to my plastic surgeons laughed that were staying in to get changed I think we are a little too flashy and he insisted we stay but we knew that if we did and we were drinking things would get crazyWe paid the bill and he said the next round was on him if we returnedWe all thought it was a great idea to put our hair up in ponytails and wear tracksuits and looks very comfortable. The attention was way too much for us to handle and we knew that it would only get worse had we not done thatWhen we returned back to the bar the bartender was very surprised he returned and asked why we changed and said that we had looked so stunning we should not have changed our clothes"" But it was all for the better at around 530 everybody started to pile up and we were meeting so many fantastic gentleman that we otherwise would've scared off had we not changed out of our outfitsThe bartender absolutely adored us and asked us if we could come back every night there was a big shop from Wall Street that asked my friend what she wanted to eat. Because she was looking at the menuI was not looking at the menu I was chitchatting and when I turned my head I swear to God this guy with his Rolex and his Dolce and Gabanna suit he said ""bring out every appetiser on the menu""she started laughing now and the bartender said oh he's serious!!!  And then warned us that we would never get away from him but the guy was so nice to us and he kept ordering food and deserts for us and we kept telling him to stopThis was over a year ago so I would have to go back into my Facebook photos and click on them to add to this but it was so coolHe paid for all our drinks and then some he was the nicest guy in the entire world and definitely gave us something fun to talk about on the flight homeMy girlfriend who was single said I really think I wanna move to New York City of the men are like this!!! I had to let her know that New York City men are something else she was not moving enough that was a once-in-a-lifetime thing and to enjoy itWe kept saying over and over imagine if we didn't get changed....

44,Neil P.,"New Paltz, NY",0,34,3,1.0,5/28/2018,"Ohhh... it really pains me to give this place a bad review because the company was amazing, the drinks (Lemon Drop Martinis) were yummy, and the service was attentive and personable throughout the evening (except when two servers brought our main courses. They seamed inexperienced. Everybody got their dishes wrong and when they tried to correct it they bumped at each other and almost spilled the food. My uncle didn't get his dish with ours. After a few minutes of awkward confusion it turned out the waiter had served my uncle's dinner to a different table. Luckily he managed to retrieve it before the food was touched. Yikes!The great thing about going to restaurants with my family is that we get to have a bite of each other's food. That way if anyone order a not so good dish if we decide to come back to the same restaurant we order something different. Sadly, for the first time ever every single course my family ordered SUCKED big time. Food was just plain mediocre all around!!! Even the bread roll brought to our table was stale and tasteless. Appetizers: Lamb meatballs (just ok. They were nicely seasoned, but they were served cold and that made them taste greasy). Calamari (poorly seasoned and lacking that needed crisp). Main Courses: Pork chop (Horrible!! Not seasoned properly and undercooked! It came in what I can only describe as a tasteless watered down messy pool of cold broth with raw veggies floating around). Filet Mignon just MEH. It was served with a small portion of regular mashed potatoes. Absolutely NOTHING special about it. If I am in TriBeCa near this place I would maybe consider stopping by for a drink at the bar. That's it!!!",3,,

I wish I had ordered that and will next time. We shared the spiced lamb meatballs, which were fantastic. I had the pappardelle, which was really great, one of the best I've had. My friend's scallops were equally delicious. The apple crisp for dessert was the perfect ending to our meal. Drinks were also top-notch, with excellent tasting wines. I had no trouble getting a reservation on OpenTable. I think the hype of this place as a celebrity-owned (Robert DeNiro) restaurant has died down, which is just fine by me. Just means that I can get a reservation no problem at one of the most solid establishments in NYC. Excellent and very attentive and accommodating service, amazing food and a cozy and romantic atmosphere to boot. Hope to be back many times.",2,,2
48,Dawn G.,"Washington, DC",3,53,16,4.0,2/20/2018,"The husband picked a goody. Went for a late night birthday dinner. The hostess seated us along the wall but we spotted a more comfy booth and got it: no problem. And like most American restos, as soon as we sat down our server pushed the alcohol menu. This is when we slow our server down and order our way. I started with the grilled octopus which was absolutely light and lovely and went really well with the bed of chick peas. Would go back just for that! Then I had the lobster cavatelli which had excellent layers of flavor with the kale and sweet potato. Only thing?  Would have loved that dish to be more rustic with bigger dices instead of the tiny evenly squared pieces I got. It looked too manufactured like it was produced by some machine rather than a chef. Oh, and I stole a few of my husband's scallops that were done to perfection and teamed up perfectly with my lobster. Would definitely hook that up again! And then the drums rolled and out came my banana creme brûlée birthday plate. That's when I went straight to heaven. Thanks Bobby!",,,

Our waiter was not enthused at all..didn't really care much to be there and was pretty non existent for most of our time there. We had a bottle of Bordeaux, grilled octopus and I ordered the lamb shank for my main course. The octopus was decent, nothing to rave about, as was the lamb shank.

The restaurant has a large selection of delicious imported cheese. They allow you to choose five samples for your platter. I always have a hard time choosing. The entrees themselves are the least impressive part of the menu for me.  I always enjoy my appetizers and desserts much more than my main course.  Robert DeNiro's artwork fills the hallways to the bathroom.

Everyone else in my team also were making fun of their small portions. This was supposed to be 'the dinner'. I was very embarrassed. Desserts were at least somewhat bigger.

The restaurant feels classy and upscale, but has a relaxed ambiance, and wasn't intimidating. My friends and I were probably the most casually dressed table there..loll I had a reservation for 6:30pm.. and we arrived and were seated right away. Our server, Nicole was cute and very knowledgeable about the menu and the extensive wine list. A note about the wine list.. It's more than a list.. more like an Encyclopedia! The book was like 5-6 pages long, with well over 100 wines.. It was very impressive! 2 of us ordered a glass of wine each, to accompany our meal.  We opted for the restaurant week menu. My friends and I all agreed on the Salmon Tartare app.. 2 of us got the pork chop and one got the Atlantic Salmon. And 2 of us ordered the Chocolate cake and one had the Creme Brulee. We didn't wait long for the food to come. Maybe 15-20 mins between each course. Salmon tartare  was very tasty! Tiny pieces of salmon, avocado and mango chopped together. Was very fresh and light. A perfect appetizer! The pork chop was AWESOME! Tender and juicy and very flavorful! And my dessert, the chocolate cake was okay. It was accompanied by house made whipped cream, and it wasn't too sweet, but I've definitely had better. Service was on point. Water glasses were refilled promptly.

So I was happy to see that they offer a Restaurant Week brunch on the weekends, for $25/3 courses. Not a bad deal if you go for more the ""lunch"" (which I always do at brunch), versus overpriced egg dishes. My girlfriend made a ressie and we came here on a busy Sat at 1:30 with our fiances.  We were seated promptly even though only there were initially only two of us for a good 10-15 min, and because my friends were running behind, they kindly allowed us to order for them so the first courses came out when they arrived.   I had the:- chilled corn bisque which was so refreshing with nicely pickled enoki mushrooms - the Chicken scalloppini which was really awesome: very thinly pounded, well seared, seasoned and came with fresh arugala, corn, tomato and red quinoa. Yum. - The Italian panna cotta which was custardy but more tart/yogurt in taste over sweet, Vanilla-y panna cotta. This I wish was more traditional. My friends had about the same, except that one of them decided to do the :- Summer Lentil Salad (looked fresh and good but did not try)-The chilled poached salmon (very light, healthy looking) - almost Scandanavian-y-The Key Lime Cheesecake, which fiance had a bite and said it was delicious and sweet. My fiance did not go for restaurant week and instead just got the fine goat cheese omelete which was so light and fluffy and came with grilled potatoes. I will say, that the portions were very small. Even for the omelete, it was tiny for $15. But that being said, I'm actually dieting (trying to!) so I didn't mind too much but FYI. I would take them up on their RW deal. Service was incredibly prompt and polite, and were patient with pacing the meal as two of our friends arrived late.Probably inferior to Locanda Verde and/or Nobu... and it's in the same resto group, I believe. This place is spacious though so feel free to bring friends and fam. I have not dined here for dinner nor do I think I want to come back to do so.",4,,4

The bottle beer was good though, as I do like it a little warm. The other positive is that it was convenient to where I had to go, but please don't be fooled like I was.

Now I wouldn't say this is the worst dining experience I have ever had, as staff was extremely polite however- total let down in overall service and the food was Meh. I am a foodie and restaurant week is one of my favorite events of the year and this was my first restaurant to try and it was sooooo disappointing!We came the day after the big storm, not too many people dining. Once sat, the server didn't approach with menus until about 15 mins after. Very sweet and polite however made us wait throughout the meal too often and they didn't appear to be understaffed, we were approached more by bussers. Now the food- I had the Spiced Sweet Potato Bisque, Pan Roasted Amish Chicken Breast, and Pumpkin Bread Pudding. Boyfriend- Caesar Salad, Scrambled Eggs, Tribeca Chocolate Cake.Now the bisque was yummy but had barely any of the sheep milk yogurt which was best part. The chicken breast was tough, black barley under cooked and will leave you hungrier than when you came in since it was inedible, and my bread pudding taste of canned pumpkin with soggy bread and the gelato taste of freezer burn. The caesar salad tasted bitter and the greens were changing colors-seriously??, eggs were nothing special, bacon not at all crispy, chocolate cake was stale and had that crusty edge ageing as if it was in the fridge for days. Only saving grace was the side order of fries I ordered as they were fresh cut, nice salt.I also have to add that my coffee cup and milk pourer both had cracks. Also going to the bathroom is a mission and doesn't feel very safe. You must go through two different exit doors, down two sets of stairs that gave me a firehouse vibe with the coloring and all the photos  on the walls and then finally down a barely lit hall to a ladies room that has dim lighting, I have never peed so fast in my life lol.All in all I wouldn't visit Tribeca Grill again and do not recommend. If it wasn't restaurant week, I'd be super pissed  if I spent their regular menu pricing. Our bill was about $80-$85 dollars with tip and NOT worth it.

For dinner we tried the octopus starter, salmon tartare, fresh PEI mussels, fried calamari with an incredible aioli, beet salad, and wild mushrooms. They were ALL amazing! For dinner we had the cod, the duck, the pork, and several sides, including the best Brussels sprouts any of us had ever had! For dessert the banana thing (not the correct name!) was outrageous as were the chocolate cake and the Tahitian vanilla creme brûlée. The creme brûlée was the BEST I have ever had - anywhere ever!

90,Matt K.,"New York, NY",263,93,22,3.0,7/3/2016,"As someone who works down the block, I come here quite often for a drink.  This place's big allure is that it's co-owned by Robert De Niro and is often frequented by celebs living in the neighborhood.  The space itself is quite beautiful and open, with massive light fixtures keeping the space on the dimmer side of well-lite.  They have plenty of tables for grabbing a full meal (with a few tables outside overlooking Greenwich St), with an oval bar in the middle of the room (which can get a bit awkward as the room fills up).The food is generally good, with a clearly American menu (the Long Island Duck Breast is exceptional).  That said there isn't much of a ""wow factor"" with the menu, so you're paying a bit of a premium for Tribeca/De Niro over the complexity of the menu itself.  That said, the bar menu does not disappoint.  Do yourself a favor and at least try the chicken fingers (the honey mustard is so good that patrons tend to ask for the recipe) and the burger (which if I recall, is on an english muffin).  The drink menu is fairly diverse, ranging from cocktails to Icelandic beers (again, all a bit overpriced).  Service behind the bar could probably be improved a bit (they get overwhelmed quickly) but they are very welcoming and inviting.All in all, definitely one of those places that every New Yorker should try, but you probably won't be blown away by the experience.",,,
91,Erin S.,"Manhattan, NY",62,108,5,4.0,2/24/2015,"went here for restaurant week lunch and overall the food was great. had the beet and goat cheese salad to start, only disappointment was that the goat cheese was in tiny crumbles rather than the creamy goat cheese I was hoping for. The salad was pretty tiny but the presentation was beautiful. The garganelli with butternut squash was so so good and flavorful and very filling. finished it off with the cheesecake which was creamy and delicious.great atmosphere and cool spot with the exposed brick walls and artwork. on the pricey side but would definitely come back.",1,,

We had the salmon and swordfish entrees which were very good also. Service was very attentive and friendly, great people! Overall I can't complain but I wasn't blow away either - so four stars for solid middle-of-the-road quality dining haha!",,,

Warm and inviting atmosphere, hardly anyone there, I'm sure because of the time but we just loved everything about it. BF had burger and fries, which he said was great. I had chicken parm sandwich which was not really what you'd expect, as it was much better served on thin crusty type flatbread. Lots of flavor! Side of spinach and we were full and happy. House Pinot Noir was very good, too. Our server, Eltra, was the most cordial and lovely young woman we have been served by in a long time. We plan on going back for dinner soon.",1,,
96,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",808,1305,3040,3.0,8/26/2013,"Tribeca Grill is a classic restaurant in the area. Opened in 1990 by Robert DeNiro (among others), the restaurant put Tribeca dining on the map. Robert DeNiro-love your movies, don't love your restaurant.My friend and I started with the Wild Mushroom Pierogi with black truffle aioli and the Heirloom Tomato Salad (Cucumber, Charred Corn & Basil). The piergoi were satiating, but I feel that way about anything with truffle in it. The salad was refreshing and the basil gave it a nice bite. However, it was nothing I couldn't make at home.For my entrée, I had the Pan Roasted Hampshire Pork Chop with spiced sweet potato purée & kale, creole mustard sauce. At first glance, the chop seems huge but after chopping away the bone and the fat, there was a very miniscule amount of meat. The chop was a little too tough. The kale was undercooked. We ended with the Banana Tart with malted chocolate pecan ice cream. The ice cream was good, but the tart was just missing something. It was not sweet or caramelized enough.There was nothing special about the atmosphere. I didn't feel like I was experiencing a fabulous dinner, just sitting through it.",,,

I don't think a restaurant deserves 4 stars if the cook over cooks your meat - I don't care the excuse - there isn't an excuse for overcooked meat!  2. We ordered the burger with the fries.  I throughly enjoyed the fries - which is why I bumped up my review from 2.5 stars to 3. They were cut and seasoned well. 3. I see mixed reviews about customer service. My friend waited 6 minutes before his water glass was refilled.  Note: the restaurant did apologize for our overcooked meat and compensated us with cookies bc we were constricted with time - the cookies had nuts- my friend is allergic to nuts - he wasn't too happy ..   From what I've tasted and my experience this is honestly an overpriced restaurant in the Tribeca area. Try somewhere else,  there are plenty of other better options.",2,2,

I was unaware and specifically asked them for another sandwich without coleslaw as I am allergic to uncooked raw veggies as it makes my throat itch and close up. When I got my sandwich back all they did was remove the coleslaw. I saw reminese of the coleslaw in my sandwich.  I went off.  Who wants a 4 star restaurant service with cooks putting there hands in your food to remove components?  My sister order a panini that was downright stale, she bit into it and could not get her teeth to bit through it.  What ever was in that pannini was nothing but leather. I literally got up, called the manager over went off and walked out without paying.  Don't waste your time. This place is awful.",3,4,1

The pork chops was sooo good and perfectly seasoned. The apple crumble dessert had a good mix between sweet and tart, very lovely.  The service here was great however I would say that they seemed over eagered to hustle and bustle our table.  I felt rushed for the whole dinner and couldn't fully enjoy my food while catching up with my friends.

It consisted of rinds of romaine, overripe mushy cherry tomatoes, unrecognizable mush for avocado and boiled frozen chicken bits.  I seriously have had a better salad at Wendy's.  Since we were all in a rush to make our meeting we didn't have time to send it back but none of us after more than a couple bites.

The decor is old but classy for Tribeca.  We went on a Sunday at a peak time and were able to get a table reserved via Open Table.  Great bloody, delicious soup and a fluffy waffle.  The downside was the fact that there is only one waffle which I thought for the price they charge was a tad unexpected.  I was like a HUNGRY HIPPO so I ordered some bacon as well as sausage.  Table service was nice and the waiter was great!Overall, a nice spot for a simple brunch.  Also, I've heard the paintings were painted by Robert De Niro's father himself.",1,,

The food was finally delivered 30 minutes later. The waiters brought the food but had no clue what they brought. They placed the plate in front of my wife claiming that it was chicken when she ordered duck. When she corrected the waiter by saying she ordered duck, the waiter said that ""the plate was in fact duck""I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. This place does not deserve any stars.

The food wasn't over the top, it was a more simple menu with a twist here and there, but all our meals tasted great. My jalapeno lime corn bisque as an appetizer and thoroughly enjoyed it. Just the right amount of lime and spice to cut through the creamy bisque. My mom and I ordered the grilled chicken scallopini, my sister had the chilled salmon and my dad wanted the classic scrambled eggs and applewood smoked bacon. All plates were almost licked clean after that. We ended with great desserts also, all of us trying to get a taste of each one. Out of the key lime cheesecake, chocolate cake, and the panna cotta, the cheesecake definitely hit the spot. If you are in the area and want a casual meal with a classic, no-fuss decor than this is your place. Robert DeNiro also co-owns the place so maybe you'll get lucky and get to see him.",2,2,3
112,Brittany A.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",624,372,398,4.0,2/24/2014,"I came here on Restaurant week so I was treated to a way cheaper price then the usual here. Needless to say it was a beautiful day out and my friend and I met up in Tribeca specifically to try this place out. Take advantage of the sale if you will. Tribeca is one of those neighborhoods that you either adore or despise. That day was phenomenal from the weather, to the amount of people out, to the way the sun hit the water it was just perfect. When we arrived we crept inside and were greeted pleasantly. They offered us seating in door and out and we opted for outside (Always out if it's available and nice enough). One thing I noted was how delightful the staff was even though we were just two hood chicks from Queens lol They don't discriminate. Most ritzy ditzy spots try to send you in the back to wash the dishes. They were so nice here.We were seated out side and blessed with nice glasses of water. Water in fancy glasses always taste better than water in plastic. Every spot should know that by now. For appetizer I had the sweet corn bisque. Ahhh.. corn...bisque...sweet. It was wonderful. As i began to sip I realized I had never really had like a corn soup situation but this was good stuff. I decided I would have to look in to creating something like this at home because it was perfectly sweet. I tossed some black pepper in the mix for a little kick and thoroughly enjoyed it. For my main dish I ordered the Herb Roasted Salmon. It was a delightful piece of salmon. Cooked perfectly. It had a nice flaky-ness and was still moist. The herbs on top were delicious as well. I also had the pennette in a pesto sauce. It was a nice size serving of pasta. Cute little penne noodles, all green and adorable. My favorite color. As much as I like pesto sometimes it can be overwhelming. Here it was done nicely. Not too over powering and still very flavorful. For dessert I ordered the blueberry cheese cake and I tried some of my friend's warm peach tart. Both desserts were delicious and if I had to return I don't  know which I would choose over the other. The warmth of the peach tart made it very satisfying and soothing. But the chill of the cheesecake and the tart from the blueberry was really good as well.All in all I really enjoyed my meal here and the whole atmosphere was nice. Would I come back outside of restaurant week? Hell  no! I don't have the funds for the regular prices here.. actually I do but I'm not willing to spend it lol. But if you got it...this is definitely a spot to spend it. Great food and a great atmosphere.",4,5,1

Updated review","We had eaten here for dinner a few years ago and had a wonderful meal so decided to try it for lunch in the daylight. As it was dark on our last visit we were surprised how vibrant the neighborhood was seeing it in the daytime. Wish the weather had been just a bit warmer to eat outside but inside was warm and inviting. We were welcomed by the hostess and shown to our seats. They knew about my wife's allergy and were very accommodating. Our waiter was Fantastic. Really nice and he actually acted like he cared about my wife having an allergy. We each had the 3 course price fixe lunch meal. I started with a Caesar salad, the farm raised Amish chicken and then a Creme Brule for dessert. My wife had the beet salad, the salmon and the chocolate cake. Everything was perfect. My salad was delicious but was huge. Really to much for one person. But it was tasty. The chicken was perfectly cooked and they gave me extra fingerling potatoes as i am not fond of the greens they were serving. Really tasty and delicious. Many times when my wife orders salmon the chefs either send it out dry because the sauce they have already prepared has shallots in it or they will make up something that is not very tasty. Almost as if they try and punish you for having an allergy that asks them to do something out of the ordinary. This kitchen did not do that and the salmon and sauce were perfect. And well the desserts were sweet and wonderful and as a special treat our waiter brought out a basket of fresh hot delicious doughnut holes just out of the fryer. Wow! An unexpected but not refused gift for sure. So thanks again for a great meal. We will return. Love the art work and love the interior. the ables are far enough apart to give you a sense of privacy.",,,

125,Richard L.,"Queens, NY",825,717,14,5.0,12/24/2013,"I came here a little over a week ago for a holiday dinner we were invited to.  We had a large group of people with a reservation set for everyone - we all grabbed a drink at the bar then went over to our table once it was ready (within 10 minutes).  So we walked in and it was a really nice space.  The restaurant was large and spacious, with the area around the bar spaced away from the dinning area by small partitions set up - which is nice.  The place was also decorated for Christmas which made it feel especially festive since we were there for a holiday dinner.So the food overall was very good - I started with the seared tuna, then went for the Pan Roasted Hampshire Pork Chop, with some roasted mushrooms and i ended up skipping dessert.  The seared tuna - i could have used slightly larger or thicker portions of the tuna, while good - it seemed like...not enough tuna.  It was very good - just i wish there was a little more...maybe a bite or two.  The pork chop was awesome!  Perfect medium which now-a-days you don't need to overcook pork.  The pork was cooked perfectly and retained a wonderful amount of juicyness and flavor.  The roasted mushrooms to me felt under cooked and had a heavy earthy flavor.  That was probably part of the meal i thought was only meh at best.Anyway, i had a good time there!",1,1,1

129,Gregory B.,"Fort Worth, TX",128,248,100,5.0,2/11/2014,"Had a fantastic food and wine experience here Sunday night.Had an 8 pm reservation and arrived about 7:30, so we took a seat at the beautiful bar and started the wine experience that is Tribeca Grill.  The bartender was more knowledgable than most sommeliers I've met, and the asst Sommelier (Jason MacGregor) stopped by the bar to make sure they could answer any questions I had.  Really nice start to evening, and I've not even been seated at my tableJason recommended a very appropriately priced French Burgundy for us that was drinking beautifully.  We sat at bar and talked about wine with the staff for 30 minutes, and they showed us how they are starting to use Coravin to serve single tastings of their extensive wine selection.At 8 pm, we were asked if we wanted to be seated.  I'd say the restaurant was not even a third full on a Sunday night!  It was quite and we got a wonderful corner table where we could see the whole restaurant.For starters we had the coconut battered tempura rock shrimp and the wild mushroom pierogi.  Both were excellent, although the shrimp portion size could make a small plate entree serving for someone, the pierogi was amazing, more like a little potsticker, but full of flavor.As we had finished our Burgundy, I asked Jason to recommend another wine for our entree dishes (filet and duck).  Again he recommended the perfect wine a northern French Côte-Rôtie, that was perfect.  Least you think all they do is French wine, I can assure you not, however their wine cellar is so extensive, and their pairing knowledge so complete, you can expect a really perfect pairing with whatever you are having.Our entrees were cooked perfectly, and the butternut squash and Brussels sprouts medley with my duck was exquisite.I'm sure we benefitted from the attention we got because the restaurant was one-third full, but everyone we came in contact with made sure our experience was 5-star.  I highly recommend Tribeca Grill for a wonderful evening out.",1,,

Busy, but not too crazy and you could still hear your company which is always a plus. We started with the arugala salad with buffalo mozzarella and the seared tuna with noodles. Both were really good. I could have ate the seared tuna as my entree honestly! (get the larger portion if you do!) For my entree I had the crab cake, which was also really good. The corn salad it came with was a nice complement. Lastly, our servers were delightful; I would come back!",1,1,

On the recommendation of the waitress we started with the soup of the day (creamy cauliflower with toasted pine nuts).  It did not disappoint.  It wasn't exactly the low calorie option but it was delicious.  For mains my wife ordered the eggs benedict and I ordered the burger with blue cheese.  The eggs benedict was delicious with perfectly charred ham.  The burger however was AMAZING!  Some restaurants can be a little skimpy when you get blue cheese.  Not the Tribeca Grill.  The burger came topped with a heaping portion of melty and delicious blue cheese.  The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy.  It did not disappoint.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant and we are looking forward to returning for dinner.,,,

138,Chelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,102,198,4.0,6/30/2015,"Being completely honest the place earns stars mainly because I had such a great time here with friends that even the food was overshadowed by our laughter and conversations. That shouldn't take away from the restaurant, the food was still great, and the whole idea is making memories right?I'd say the best seat in the house is the table in the corner by the window furthest from the door where you can see the layout of the restaurant. Also the review is going to be biased due to the fact that a friend of mine works there and one guest in our party used to work there. Needless to say we were showered with attention, sparkling wine, and extra food. I loved the arugula and buffalo mozzarella salad, octopus salad, salmon tartare, oh the shrimp tempura (we ordered a second plate), goat cheese gigantone, Mahi Mahi, the scallops, the ribs... and we had every dessert (all good).",,,

142,Tom C.,"New York, NY",66,105,1,3.0,12/16/2014,"The best part was the ghost from 1990 that visited me in the bathroom, dressed in his oversize Armani power suit, selling junk bonds and looking for coke. Sadly I had to let him know that times had changed... and I wish someone would let the restaurant know! The menu was straight from the '90s, down to the little dinner roll we received at the start of lunch. Some of the highlights: Seared tuna with sesame noodles, proudly proclaimed as Ahi.  Turkey Club, Chopped Salad, etc...  Once edgy cuisine, it's now the highlight of the ""fancy"" restaurant in your hometown suburbia.  There's no way the certainly excellent cooks in this restaurant are challenging themselves or the diners. Of course, the service is great, as is the location, and the wine list had a wonderful page of reasonable picks. We had a delicious Rhone red.  All in all, the entire place seemed a little old... and the insanely difficult to get to bathroom filled with newspaper articles from twenty years ago encapsulated my experience perfectly. It used to be the only game in Tribeca was Keith McNally and Drew Nierropoint. Unfortunately I think they've both given up and the neighborhood has suffered for it.",2,3,

I'd return just for that! The Amish chicken was prepared to perfection as was the Cod. And for dessert although you can't go wrong with the brownie, my crisp tasted like a medley of summer sunshine in my mouth!  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because our server was terribly slow and forgot my 2nd glass of wine, he seemed to overlook us and we had to flag him down, but I'll still return in hopes of getting a better server.",,,
145,Camy C.,"Derby, CT",292,297,117,2.0,2/4/2013,"Had brunch here with the restaurant week menu. for the same price as regular week day lunch $25 but there was an option given to get 2 course (appetizer + main entree) for $19 instead of 3 course at $25. All 6 girls in my group went with the 2 course since none of the dessert stood out. My minestrone was bland and luke warm. After some salt, it was better. The granola parfait was rather lacking in yogurt, so although it was beautiful in presentation, the ratio of yogurt and granola was off balance.  My entree was the garganelli. The pasta  was al dente. But some of the winter squash was undercooked and i really dislike the texture of not-mushy squash. The mushroom however was delicious.  The waffle came by itself with a scoop of strawberry butter (?)and looked like what I can make on my own in a hotel continental breakfast. Not sure if the taste is much better. I really was not a fan of the food but the atmosphere was nice and service of our waiter was delightful. He refilled our hot water pots attentitively and never rushed us after we had finished our meal.   May go back for regular menu but definitely not brunch.",2,,

The chandeliers looked great as well. Wish I had the pleasure to see my friend Mr. De Niro (obvi not my friend), but he wasn't in that day.  The entrées we had had mixed reviews. I ordered the jumbo lump crab cake. The crab cake was good, but I was not a big fan of the sauce. It tasted eerily similar to thousand island. Also, the portion was on the smaller side. Other members of my ordered the scallops and the NY strip. They said their meals were delicious. I obviously made the wrong decision. The service was great. No cup was ever empty. No throat was ever parched. The servers came by to make sure everything was running smoothly, without being a nuisance. I had a pleasant experience at Tribeca Grill. When you come here, expect the food to be good, but you are paying extra for great service and the name of the owner.Tip: ""Never [order the crab cake], and always keep your mouth shut.""

We were a party of 7 with 2 kids and the waitress was super sweet and attentive. Food wise, I got the short rib pirogies. They were a bit oily and not a lot of flavor. Not something I would order again. For the entree, the pistachio crusted swordfish was amazing! I loved how fresh and light it was. I could probably just have two pieces of that and be a happy camper. Others around the table ordered the scallop risotto and the caesar salad which I didn't taste but by the looks of them, were good too. We also got a bottle of Austrian white wine which happen to go well with all the seafood orders. At the end of the night, one of us forgot our card at the restaurant and they promptly notified us.

The food here was fantastic. There were five of us at dinner, so we shared a few appetizers. We tried the jumbo lump crab cake, salmon tartare and the short rib pierogi, which was my favorite and was so sad I had to even share it. It was hearty and just delicious. For my entree, I ordered the seared sea scallops over a carrot risotto. The scallops were large and cooked to perfection (I sometimes go back and forth when ordering scallops at a new restaurant because sometimes the scallops are smaller than expected but luckily this wasn't the case). The risotto was cooked perfectly and was surprisingly good (I'm not a big carrot fan). I was choosing between this and the pistacchio crusted swordfish and the waiter didn't even hesitate to pick the former. Good thinking.We shared a bunch of sides also--sauteed spinach, pan roasted wild mushrooms and the whipped potatoes. The best among the three were the mushrooms. I didn't care for the spinach at all.I shared the banana tart with my friend for dessert. This was actually my least favorite dish of the night and was bummed to end the night on that note. The restaurant donates one dollar for every banana tat sold to Hayden's Heroes which is what suaded me to order this. All for a good cause, right?I loved the ambiance of this place.

However, I felt like the service wasn't that great, everything took forever in the beginning, then later on in the night they seemed annoyed that we were their last table & they couldn't wait to leave. Not impressed.",1,,

Updated review",Another fantastic Christmas Eve Dinner.  Tribeca Grill has become a tradition for Christmas Eve that we hope to continue for many years.  The food is amazing and the service cannot be beat.  The decor is warm and decorated so pretty for the holidays.  There is a reason that they continue to thrive year after year.  Thanks for another great Christmas Eve!,,,

Great for a quiet evening with family. Staff were very friendly, from the hostess to the server. Family friendly in terms of attitude and menu.",,,
178,Justin W.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",89,252,475,3.0,11/14/2014,"The restaurant was busy & has a great environment, a great choice to come when you want to be a bit dressed up. The lump crab cake was excellent & the black bean salsa delicious. The octopus salad was good, but not great. For mains we all went with different options:The lamb was a very large portion and very filling however it was a bit overlooked. The swordfish and the duck were ok options but my friends were not overly impressed. Overall we felt the crab cake was the best part of the meal. We did go for dessert: the mandarin sorbet & mango sorbet was ok. The flavour was not distinctive enough. The banana gelato with champagne Icecream was delicious & made up for the lamb! Yum!!",,,
179,Nicole B.,"Brooklyn, NY",225,300,37,4.0,8/14/2012,"OK...maybe my party and I were a little tipsy before we arrived, so I will have to go back again (slightly more sorber) to make sure my impression is accurate.GREAT time atmosphere was sophisticated but comfortable.  The wait staff was freindly, helpful and attentive.  They really made it better because we did not feel rushed or like we were a bother.  Plus the bartender was cute and the drinks where delicious!!The food was terrific...PERIOD!!!",,,
180,Lou C.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,255,190,4.0,8/7/2015,"I spent a beautiful lunch with a friend at Tribeca Grill it's a must for restaurant week because of the pricing. The staff is very attentive and obviously the ambience most welcoming. The lunch menu included choices between fish chicken or pasta.The desserts ranged from chocolate cake to a yogurt, panacotta.  The appetizers ranged from a very sophisticated country small salad to a larger plate of greens and vegetables. I never order a drink or a soda I stick with Goodo... cold ....New York City water, just add some lemon and life is good. The best time to go is between 1215 and 12:45 PM otherwise you run into a loud boisterous over consuming crowd talkers and they are loud!!!!",1,,
181,kean o.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,86,4,4.0,9/24/2014,We had a great family dinner here. Fancy and yummy. I wish they had more vegetarian and/or vegan options. They made me a vegetable plate of three of the sides and it was super great- just maybe not worth $30. The service was good and the atmosphere is nice.I recommend it for a fancy/expensive place to eat in tribeca.,,,
182,Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",537,659,558,5.0,10/4/2013,"Wow - when I was first told by my gal pals that for my surprise bachelorette dinner that we were dining at ""Robert De Niro's restaurant,"" I wasn't sure what to expect, given that the first images conjured up were of gangster films, Fockers, and posh TriBeCa. No need to have any pre-conditioned expectations of Tribeca Grill - you will love it.On a busy Saturday night, our party of 10 was seated right away (we had a reservation that was immediately honored) at a lovely table right in the center of the action at this beautiful restaurant. Noise level was lively, but not deafening. Atmosphere and ambiance definitely lent themselves to celebration and a special occasion, while still being upscale without being stuffy. Service was spot-on throughout the entire meal. I'm always impressed at a busy restaurant, with a party full of women (most of whom make a special request or modification to the entree choice), with multiple servers and food runners, doesn't make a single mistake throughout our entire experience. Such was the case at Tribeca!I ordered the sea scallops with chanterelles - how divine - 6-7 well-sized scallops, perfectly seared and plump, presented around a tempting mound of chanterelles, with a delicate truffle flavor. I'm still salivating over this meal. My fellow friends all cleaned their plates, and the two bottles of champagne we ordered made the evening even better (they had a great selection). I was impressed with the wine selection and cocktail creativity, and for the service, selection, flavors, and presentation, I don't think the prices were at all over-the-top, not even taking the NYC pricing into account. I would happily return to Tribeca Grill next time I'm in town.",2,1,1
183,Michael B.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,8/1/2015,"Had a reservation at 9:15 for 6, but was a good 25 min before we had to finally flag someone down to come take our drink order. When the waitress finally did she had no idea about the wine menu and said she'd send the sommelier over. 10 min later still no show so we asked her to come back over and just randomly picked a bottle. Took at least another half hour before our cheese plate came out and minutes after came our main dishes. Maybe it was because it was end of night and the place was slowing down there was a general lack of attention, but still  no excuse for the lack of service. Anytime we needed anything had to flag down another server or host. Getting and paying the check was another half hour ordeal. Food was ok. The meat dishes were good, the fish and scallops not so much. Generally overpriced for the quality. Would not go back.",1,,
184,You L.,"New York, NY",296,9,6,5.0,1/30/2016,"Went here yesterday for NYC Restaurant Week. Atmosphere was good, we were seated within 2-3 minutes since we arrived, we had made a reservation the day before. My friend and I both ordered the $25 3 course lunch. The Caesar salad was good. It was a little over seasoned in my taste, the dressing was a little too strong but it wasn't overwhelmingly creamy. There was a bitter aftertaste that I found interesting but was sometimes too much. I ordered the salmon and my friend the chicken breast. The salmon was a perfect texture. The skin was seasoned really well, I wish the salmon had more of those flavored. The mushrooms and beans with the salmon were light and complimented the salmon great. The chicken breast was really tender. The squash(?) sauce was surprisingly sweet and really complimented the chicken. The rice was ok. The desert was probably the best part of the meat. I had the TriBeCa chocolate cake which was really rich and chocolate-y. Not overwhelmingly sweet. My friend had the coconut sorbet, which wasn't even part of the restaurant week menu but our waiter included it as part of that menu anyway (we didn't pay extra for the sorbet). The coconut flavor was really genuine. Was a little too sweet for my taste. Good texture and the cookie included was really good.",,,
185,Taylor G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,11,2.0,5/9/2016,"I was disappointed with my experience here. I have heard good things, and its a well known traditional new york city spot. Also owned by the awesome Mr. Robert Dinero. I came here for a friends birthday, the ambiance is really great! To start, i ordered a manhattan up, and it was a terribly sad pour- my martini glass was less then half full, and my friends next to me was full. In addition, I used to be a bartender, and know how to pour a proper 3oz drink. When I asked the waitress if she could have my drink remade she just sorta shrugged me off and told me i was wrong and that it was a good pour. Fine, whatever- drinking licenses are expensive I get it. I started with a caesar salad: It was bland, and too small with literally nothing on it. It was a brown bowl with a few romain leaves and some dressing, and a couple croutons. I was really disappointed. Then for dinner I ordered the scallops, with risotto. The scallops were really tasty, and cooked great. The risotto was again, really sad. It was like flavored water with uncooked rice. It may sound silly to be so upset over a bowl of rice, but a place with this stature should know better then to serve severely undercooked risotto, I didnt even eat it! A major disappointment for me only enjoying a few scallops for $35. Lastly, after dropping our bill the waitress disappeared for literally 25 minutes. We were at a birthday party and had a show to catch and she made us have to track her down. We also missed some of the beginning. Thats just such a small little thing that any respectable waitress should know not to do. Over all pretty disappointed, the risotto was the worst of it all. I won't be going back.",2,,
186,Kelly M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,20,0,5.0,11/14/2015,"Wine list is extensive. Food was great. Best part was Nicole, the bartender. She was friendly, funny and quick. I will definitely come back next time I'm in NY.",,,

188,Amy S.,"Clarkston, MI",55,27,0,2.0,4/30/2015,"We were pretty bummed out about this restaurant. It was SO loud that we could hardly hear each other. I'm not one to complain about noise but this was ridiculous. Not only that but they were basically pushing us out the door by the end of our meal(, even though we still had food on our plates)  because there were people waiting. When you go somewhere and spend as much money on a meal as you do there you would expect to be able to take your time. We couldn't hear each other speak anyway but you get my point. I wouldn't go back.",2,,
189,Blake L.,"Carmel, IN",73,91,52,5.0,12/14/2013,"The food and service at this Robert Di Nero owned restaurant was excellent. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgable and deserved the large tip they earned. With lots of scrumptious food options our waiter was able to steer each of the 3 of us to a dish that matched out hunger. I had the short rib and it was probably the best I've ever had. After several bottles of wine and a great main course, we were coaxed into trying dessert where I had the green apple gelato and it didn't disappoint. After our dessert showed up, the waiter arrived with a complementary glass of dessert wine which capped a wonderful dinner experience. Highly recommend. Maybe you'll even run into the owner :)",1,,
190,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",198,504,1567,3.0,12/4/2011,"Disclaimer: all the food was comped.The decor of this place is very American and the type of people who come here definitely like to wine and dine.I had arugula & buffalo mozzarella salad, grilled long island duck breast, and chocolate & salted caramel crisp.The salad was different, had roasted eggplant in it. It was pretty good, better than some salads with just cheese in it.  The salad didn't feel overwhelmingly oily.The duck was really good.  I actually enjoyed it.  Just take the skin off because it was a little charred.  Luckily, it didn't ruin the taste of the overall dish.  Overall flavor of the dish is an earthy one.  Even though the menu doesn't mention mushrooms in the dish, it certainly tasted like there was.  I would recommend this dish.The salted caramel crisp. Is really sweet. I could only eat half and I was satisfied. There was another dessert option, banana tart. Visually, the tart looked much better but unfortunately, I did not get a chance to taste it. I have a suspicion that the tart tasted better!Service was excellent.  I would recommend coming here at least once.",1,,
191,Brandon A.,"Austin, TX",4,25,2,4.0,7/25/2014,The lamb was just ok -- Based on food alone I would give TG three stars.  Their drinks however earned them a fourth.  Superbly done drinks with so-so lamb.  Pro Tip: They do not serve aged beef (ergo the order of lamb).,,,
192,Nahuel Q.,"Tenafly, NJ",0,6,0,3.0,12/19/2015,"Went last Saturday for first time. I went with a freind who is quite the foodie so had high expectations. It ended up being hit or miss. It was typical NYC spot with good atmosphere,  Good service,  nice bar and beer and wine options  (although not too many on beer). Now the food. We had a number of appetizers with the portion size being quite small. Presentation was ok but not extravagant.  The octopus was very chewey and i expected much better. Other appetizers ordered at table were as expected but nothing that wowed me. The main course had some great options like the duck and the lobster pasta. Both of those were extremely good.  Unfortunately i didnt order them and went with cod and risotto.  Cod was cooked well but flavor was uninspiring.  The risotto was terrible. At this point i forgot what they were going for but it only tasted like butter and if you tilted plate you could see how the oil juat pooled to one side.  I didn't bother eating it after one bite.The place had some nice offerings and good atmosphere and i would go back for a good meal.but if you are looking to be excited and wowed try something else",,,

195,Niyati D.,"Chicago, IL",81,19,25,3.0,4/10/2014,"It's more of a 3.5Went here for a team lunch. It's def a pricey spot, but I got the Daily Burger for $15 which is pretty standard for a burger at most places in NYC. The burger was served on an English muffin and came with a slide of fries. I got mine with a slice of cheddar, but my manager opted for the cheese & ale sauce. Overall, the burger was good - cooked as I requested and had a decent amount of flavor. I wasn't blown away by the burger and I didn't think the meat was seasoned exceptionally well. My manager on the other hand raved about the cheese sauce and he really enjoyed his burger. Verdict: Not a very memorable burger, but may go back and try something else.P.S. Amazing chicken fingers at the bar! The honey mustard dip too.",,,
196,Vince C.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",182,47,4,3.0,5/8/2015,"I came to Tribeca Grill unknowing it had a reputation. Lunch service seemed to be really inexperienced. Waiters were out if uniform by the bathrooms and they reached across our faces when serving us. For how many people were here (5 tables) it took a long time to get our food....it looked like they were just understaffed or something. Maybe im a biased critic because i was a witer for 2 yrs but it didnt seem all that nice. Food was good, not great that is why it's not a 2 star. The pergoies were really good 15 (dollar appetizer) but they were very sparing with everything especially water. For the money that was spent the experience did not impress.",1,,
197,Crystine W.,"New York, NY",769,1213,283,2.0,2/6/2013,"Good (but not great) food and a very chill environment, but the reservation process was an absolute nightmare.  I think that things ended up being very frustrating both for the restaurant and myself when I made reservations to celebrate my b-day during Restaurant Week at TriBeCa Grill.  They were one of the few places that told me they could accommodate more than 10 people so I booked them right away.  For reservations, they take down your credit card - which I didn't mind - just to secure the reservation.  This is completely normal, but apparently, they will charge you $25 per person who doesn't come that you RSVP'd for.  So if 2 people end up not showing, that's $50 out of my pocket and that is just ridic.  It automatically put so much pressure on me to constantly chase down my guests for responses (because we all know how important it is for people to push aside other priorities and RSVP for a celebration dinner).  It just made me feel like TriBeCa Grill doesn't ""get it.""  Customer service is about making the customer's life easier and their reservation process alone would deter me from ever going back.  Even with the reservations made, my guests and I waited almost an hour past our reservation time to get seated.  This was uncalled for.  Reservations were made for 9:00pm.  [9:05 PM] I let the maitre d' know that my entire party was here and we could be seated whenever they were ready.  She said that it would only be a few additional minutes as they were setting the table in the back.  I also increased my reservations by 2 additional people and they assured me the table could fit 2 additional people - just a few minutes.[9:20 PM] My guests are getting rowdy and they ask if we're going to be seated soon so I followed up, turns out the table didn't even leave yet, but they did have their check so they expect them to leave very soon.[9:50 PM] I asked 'em what gives because we had been eyeing a set of tables that had been empty for the past 45 minutes we were waiting and they could've accommodated my party size.  Again, maitre d' was apologetic and then went on to explain that the table held onto their check for a while and were just sitting with it, but they just paid and were getting up so they only needed to reset the table.  It was irritating that we got so many different responses, but then at that moment, some other host standing next to the maitre d' chimed in and condescendingly said ""Yeah and we had to give you a different table because you increased the reservations.""  Well, that's news to me ... why in the 45 minutes did someone NOT tell me that it was going to be a different table than what was originally reserved?  I went back to my inquiring party of 13 others each time communicating exactly what TriBeCa Grill told me ... and that was the first of the night that I heard we were getting a different table than what we originally reserved.  The excuses made (in order) were: we're setting the table; other table didn't leave, but they have their check and should only be a few more minutes; the other party is sitting with the check, but they've paid.  Way to try and turn the tables back on me buddy, but you were bullsh*tting for the long wait and you know it.Circa 10:00pm, we were finally seated with the maitre d' being very apologetic and my guests hungry.  There was some confusion as to whether or not to give us the regular or the Restaurant Week menu.  We were first provided with the regular menu (which also included the RW menu at the bottom).  These were taken away because they gave us ""the wrong menu"" and then we were provided a menu with only the RW options listed.  I was really starting to get annoyed at that point.  We discussed during our phone conversation that I wanted both options presented because we all had different diets and preferences so while I was sure some people would order off the RW menu, some of us might order directly off the regular menu instead.  Once we ordered, the food came out pretty quickly.  Menu Items Report Card:Appetizers:Shrimp and Grits - ABaby Beet Salad - AOctopus Salad - B+Jumbo Lump Crab Cake - BEntrees:Grilled Atlantic SalmonSeared Sea Scallops - A+Grilled Filet of Beef - BBraised Short Rib - A+Dessert:Pumpkin Cheesecake - BService was quite rushed and we were out of there by 11:30pm.  Very unlikely that I will return to this spot - food isn't the best, they actually make something as easy as dinner reservations painful and we were rushed.",3,3,
198,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",1265,277,389,3.0,1/24/2011,"Nothing was particularly bad about this restaurant, but nothing stood out about it either. And in NYC, that in itself is a bad thing. There are SO many outstanding restaurants, that even if the restaurant is just good, it's not going to receive a second visit from me. I like to go to a restaurant and leave craving something that I ate. That's when I know, I'll be going back. Tribeca Grill reminds me of one of those boring, fancy steakhouses that your family would go to when you're a kid and it would be really, really boring. And usually you'd have to sit next to a grandparent that spits when they talk and the only thing you could think about while you're eating is, ""How can I get my food out of Grandma's spitting range without her knowing?"".

The salad was delicious, wish it has some goat cheese (the menu said it did but I did not see any on my dish). The pork chop was HUGE and soooo good.  The sweet potato pure had a spice in them that was very unexpected. I wasn't a fan but my roommates loved it.  It had a spicy almost curry taste? I loved the way the kale was cooked. The dessert was 1/2 great.  It was a roasted pear with sorbet on a cake.  The pears and sorbet were amazing but the cake itself has a corn bread/almond taste that was very subtle.  The cake itself wasn't moist or fluffy. Our waitress, however, was absolutely amazing and incredibly sweet.",,,
