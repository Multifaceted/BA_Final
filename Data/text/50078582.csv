0,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5477,5.0,7/5/2018,"This location is much more of a Starbucks Express. The interior is no frills - no tables, no chairs, no restroom, no outlets. They have a counter top to stand at if you're waiting for an Uber, for example, but not to take a load off.Why the high rating? Very simple: it always serves the purpose. The customer service here is very polite and capable. Most recently, Steven and Mohammad were super kind and patient. I popped in with my infant child who was hot and cranky. Despite that I had a stroller, they made my drink and didn't give me a hard time about a crying baby. I was able to console him within minutes, I just needed to take him out of the stroller for a sec. They even gave me a water on the side Bc it's 10,000 degrees out. Thanks for being so cool to a Ma. Thanks also, for getting my cold brew perfy.",,,

Updated review","Yea, I have been here countless of times and now I know why people want to sue Starbucks lol... The workers are friendly whenever I visit, but the time I tried the Purple drink they make it really nasty! I do not recommend it, because they don't even follow the ingredients to make it.The purple drink consists of passion fruit and some type of milk. They make it another way around, Idk why they would charge more for the blueberries when the drink is hella disgusting itself. The time I tried the Strawberry Acai for the first time, I had no problem with it. The second time I ordered a Venti in the morning, they did make it the correct way HOWEVER, they didn't fill it up all the way. Like, excuse me!! I paid for it and ya'll can't just not fill it up all the way -.-.... I only come to this Starbucks location, because It's close to the train station entrance and close to my work area. Please train your baristas please! Us customers don't want to pay $4-$5 for a disgusting ass drink or when it's not filled up all the way. This is the end of my rant. Thank you for reading.",1,1,1
9,Jonathan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,92,130,3.0,4/23/2017,Not much to say about this place. The staff is great. The best time to visit is definitely at night. In the morning and during the day the space gets super crowded really quickly. I'd give them a 4/5 for staff friendliness and helpfulness.,,,
10,Emily H.,"New York, NY",262,81,295,2.0,4/22/2017,"A Starbucks is a Starbucks. They always have good coffee and treats. However, this location is always crowded. The staff works hard to keep the flow moving but it can get very tight very quick. I have gotten the wrong order before, but the staff was very nice and fixed it right away. I have also recently tried the unicorn frappuccino. Def not worth it.",,,
11,Lauren P.,"Brooklyn, NY",187,322,9,1.0,2/22/2018,"I never quite understood why people with attitudes seek service industry professions. I'm a reallyyyy nice person. I understand that the service industry is rough, therefore it takes a lot to trigger me when it comes to bad service. This Starbucks on the other hand irked my last nerve this morning. I went in to order a Grande Almond Milk. None of the cashiers were pleasant. In fact, none of them were even smiling. But whatevs, smiling may not be part of the job expectations. I place my order and wait to the side for it to be made. Mind you -- it was just a cup of almond milk. When my name is called, my cup of almond milk was given to me with 90% ice. 1. Who drinks watered down milk? 2. I know for a fact I didn't iced for ICED almond milk. So understanding the morning rush, I kindly ask ""Can I actually have this without ice?"" The gentleman behind the counter scoffed at the request and begin to fish out ice cubes with a spoon. Like bruh, you're making this more difficult on yourself. Like dump the cup (that's mostly ice anyways) and refill it with milk. It's JUST milk. Nothing crazy, nothing complicated. When he went to refill the cup, his co-worker asked what he was doing and he replied ""she didn't want ice."" His co-worker then responds ""WELL SHE NEEDS TO SPECIFY THAT."" Now, I'm hella triggered. But still extremely polite. Let's recap. When I ordered my almond milk, I asked for a Grande Almond Milk. Ya know, when you order a tea from Starbucks, you say ICED..if you want an iced tea. So I assume the concept would be along the same lines. IT IS MILK! It's not this crazy concoction. You literally pour it out a box in the fridge. This location is a hot mess. Save your sanity and walk right on by.",1,,
12,Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",848,301,730,1.0,7/1/2016,"Okay, before I begin this review I want to say I generally find it pointless to write reviews for chain restaurants where I am literally in the store for less than 10 minutes altogether and I'm mostly just in and out-- even if there isn't really any customer service, if the drink/food is what it generally taste like without any bugs or roaches, I would consider that a successful trip and money well spent.Now, a lot of people have complained that this particular Starbucks tends to fill their drinks with ice and that is true. When I was done with my drink, I could see that half the cup was filled with completely solid pieces of ice (and I obviously can't see the cubes that have already melted). But, even that is tolerable and not worthy of writing a one star review for.My friends and I came in on a super NOT BUSY, Thursday evening where we were the only ones in the store. Now, after seeing my photo you're probably thinking we're the annoying basic girls that every Starbucks barista hates because we're trying to order all sorts of colorful drinks.. BUT NO. We were very kind about it, even letting the cashier, Chyyy (I believe that was the name I saw on the nametag, definitely had three consecutive Y's though), hold my friends phone to read the recipe. Keep in mind that there were NO other customers in this store at the time (or during the entire time we were in the store-- even after all our drinks were completed). For one of my friends', this cashier decides to charge her twice.. claiming that her Starbucks card had no money. Confusing situation, she was rude about it.. Nevertheless, quick transaction and I was standing one person behind her.. So I guess I didn't understand the whole situation (except that my friend did indeed get charged twice, and the first time she typed in my friend's order wrong). Next friend went after her, fine. My turn, I made sure to be very friendly and gave her the recipe of the purple drink and she didn't hear me the first time so I repeated for her.. when I repeated my order, she was just checking out her nails and not even putting in my order. When I saw the crazy stuff she was putting into my drink that I did NOT mention to her, I was kind of like uh.. wtf ?? But I'm no Starbucks expert and it was also my first time ordering the purple drink so who knows??All in all, my first friend got her drink completely wrong.. what she ordered was a liquid drink and not a smoothie (but she got charged for the smoothie). The green tea latte came out fine. The pink drink was full of strawberries, they did not cheap out on that. The purple drink did not look at all like what the purple drink looks like in photos and just overall tasted absolutely disgusting. And all drinks, excluding the smoothie, were full of ice.And while I'm at it, this Starbucks has no seats for you to sit down and study at-- as you expect in many Starbucks that are actually in their own store and not a part of Macy's or.. another store.",7,6,4
13,Geena C.,"Queens, NY",1,5,4,4.0,12/19/2017,This location is not meant for long chats and catch ups with your best friend.  This is a get your coffee and get moving high volume location which is great for NYC.  Baristas may not seem super friendly but they have a lot of orders to fill and half the time the line is all the way to the door so cut them some slack since they are trying to make your order correctly.  Katrina is barista there and she is great!,,,

17,Russ K.,"Walnut, CA",5,100,22,4.0,6/9/2016,"Visited here twice while on vacation in NYC. The Baristas were friendly, made eye contact, smiled, and made our drinks quickly and accurately!The clientele seemed to be rather cranky... maybe that's an NYC thing or they just all needed coffee, but every one of them looked miserable!

18,Alicia G.,"Chicago, IL",340,516,143,3.0,6/25/2015,"Sigh. I'm not sure why Starbucks chooses to eben have these teeny tiny outposts. This starbucks is close to my freelance gig, so I'm a regular but its so small and so tight inside. Because of that I avoid it durinng rush hour because its a mad house. On off hours or before 9a.m. its not as bad and they're usually pretty good with getting your beverages in a timely manner.They lAlso usully have pastries, ect. In stock when the starbucks on Broadway usually doesnt.Go if you need to, but only dirong ""off"" hours.",,,
19,Mrs. TI M.,"Yokohama, Japan",2,34,19,1.0,4/10/2017,"This is a convenient location for picking up a coffee as it's near big stores and many hotels. I've been in this Starbucks four times now. The second time, on 4/9 AM, the cashier was obviously having a bad day or maybe shouldn't work in customer service. Tonight , 4/10, the three people working were talking loudly about their personal life and making coffee was secondary. When I walked in, three people were waiting for their drinks. There was no rush, no consideration for the order in which drinks were placed. People got their drinks between the conversation. (I really hope I got decaf or little sleep for me tonight.)Then the cashier decided to make the drink for the  last person to place an order after me. Why?The barista, Scott, was talking so much, he didn't notice his co-worker made and handed the drink out. After he finally started my drink, he made the last drink ticket and tried to find the owner. I had to tell him the person and drink were already gone. He asked if we wanted it, we said no, so he threw it out. If you are the owner of this store, you might want to remind your workers of your expectations; hopefully that includes providing consistent, quality service and product as well as professionalism on the job.",,,
20,Marissa C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,1,1.0,11/6/2017,Awful location. Drinks take forever to come out and often are wrong. Baristas checking their cell phones instead of getting customers in and out fast. Go somewhere else.,,,

22,Diana C.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",26,73,432,1.0,3/12/2016,"I wanted to give this Starbucks more than just a star. But I've had enough of the overpriced cups of ice.If I ever order a refresher, it's a strawberry acai. I ask for NO ice, and for extra strawberries (because if you don't ask for some more, you'll get one or two small pieces.) I don't think it's that hard to make. Yet it takes them a long time. (Just 1 customer in front of me, none behind me, and it took the entire 15 minute break I had to get my drink.)Your order will be 80% ice. I remind the barista, and it's still full of ice. The drinks are already expensive, why do they have to put so much ice. I can't stress this enough. This is actually the reason why I'm even writing this review. I've given them way too many chances, and I still get a cup of ice. If the new star system went by how much ice you receive, I'd be eligible to stay a gold member til 2064.95% of the time the cashiers have an attitude. Only two people that work there are nice. And I know I'm not the only one who believes this. All of my co-workers believe this. The rest of the sour Starbucks crew needs to print out a smile and glue it to their face for their shift. Not everyone who is ordering is being an uptight, angry human demanding their order to be precise. If my order has a mistake..fine. But if this happens ALL THE TIME, I just can't handle that. It gets annoying.And I hate the new points card system. Spending more to stay gold member? Aside from getting cup loads if ice, this new system is also irritating. :(*one star because I occasionally get the barista that's friendly.",,,

Updated review","this starbucks on 6th ave between 35th and 36th st is famous for always having a crowd regardless what day or time and even on.a monday labor day holiday .it's small inside with no seating unless you consider the by the window counter as non seating . the usual bucky menu with hot and cold drinks , pastries , bagels , salads , sandwiches , etc. why it is that starbucks makes it a point to put a stand with mugs, coffee holders , bags of take home coffee grinds , etc , right in the middle of the interior were clumsy people (me) will bump into it and knock stuff over , maybe keep it behind the counter or against the wall might be better especially when space is limited when a large line is gathering . the folks working at this location are fairly quick and have not made a mistake whenever i put in an order so far.overall your typical manhattan starbucks with limited space and no seating but if you need space then the madison or 5th ave locations on 36th st will suit you just fine.",3,2,3

The guy there was asking people what they were waiting for and then making it.  This is RIDICULOUS and very UNORGANIZED.  When I pay more for a coffee drink than I do for my salad at lunch I expect not to have to fight the crowd for my drink.  Finally told them I hadn't gotten my drink and got  one of the crappiest chai tea lattes I've ever had.
