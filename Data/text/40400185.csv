0,Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,478,1585,5.0,8/31/2018,"The sandwiches here are unexpectedly delicious. You come in for soap at the main store and the aroma of food lures you in.  I have become quite fond of the chicken avocado sando, and had it two days in a row.  I hear the soups are amazing and will be having them soon.  The prices are okay, not the worst or the best, like $8 to $10 for the sandwich, but you can add soup on at a combo rate. They also have a line to salads and smoothies (sandwiches are ordered in the middle).  The workers are nice, they actually smile and make everything very quickly even though they can get really busy.There is a small seating area if you aren't pressed to leave. I saw they had catering as well (flyers out front).  I feel this will be a regular lunch spot for me .",,1,

2,Chris F.,"New York, NY",67,107,138,1.0,8/12/2017,"I've come here often but will not any longer. Also I'll tell all of my employees to no longer frequent your establishment. On Saturday 8/11/17 at 4pm I placed an order, the guy did t acknowledge any questions I asked (he was a manager)like ""can you toast it?"" And didn't give me cheese as I requested but I was on my lunch break and just kept moving. The GM saw a line form and helped ring, which was appreciated for the single transaction. I get to the counter, order an iced coffee and check in on yelp. During this time the GM is literally talking about a customer, in front of him and others. I present the check-in offer for Cafe Beyond and was told by the cashier ""I don't know what that is"", I explained to him about yelp and the occasional special offers. The Manager (the one that didn't make the order correctly) took my phone, looked at it and repeated ""I don't know what that is"" I again explained the idea of Yelp and the check-in offers. The Manager turns away from me to his General Manager (the guy complaining about the customer to his employee) the GM says to his Employees ""What's that? I don't know what that is"", there's conversation about what their going to do (not to me mind you but about me). At this point I'm fed up, get my phone back and tell them not to worry about it. I left the sandwich and coffee and will not be coming back. In short:*Management speaking poorly about customers with their employees *Rude and uncourteous staff*Incorrect orders*No clue on their own promotional items I will be very vocal about telling my employees and my customers (thousands of people every day) not to give them business.",1,,

I was so happy I stumbled upon the cafe while on a quick coffee hunt on a cold day and didn't have to walk any farther shivering my my dress. The salad bar was like a dream come true - pumpkin seeds, different types of beans, quinoa, beets, tofu, tuna, kale, sunflower seeds, etc - I was ecstatic to find toppings I normally wouldn't make at home all at once. They also have sandwiches, soups, and pizzas, and a relatively well stocked coffee counter.The place got really busy during lunchtime even on a Saturday, but the line moved pretty quickly. There are also (almost) enough seats to slowly enjoy a quick but well-made cafe meal with free wifi.",1,1,1

As a huge fan of the BB&B, and both blessed/cursed by working around the corner, I find myself spending way too many lunch breaks in the Flatiron location. I've only ever had the CYO salad here, but they have a ton of fresh ingredients, and you get EIGHT toppings, including all the meats and cheeses (Bridesmaids, anyone?). All together a large CYO comes out to about $10.00. A very competitive price for a salad in the area. Oh! and they also chop their salads. This is ****major key in creating the perfect salad. Definitely recommend if you're on the run!",1,2,2

13,Anna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,33,42,3.0,9/18/2014,"Let me start by saying, that I like Cafe Beyond's food.  No doubt.  However, I have to complain about their Salads.  I am hopping that the people or management that work here read these reviews.  The salad bowl have very little greens! Especially the Kale bowls.  Now I know that greens aren't that expensive.  Because of the little bit of greens your toppings will overload your salad! :(  Other places that sell salads that are very close by on 6th ave aren't skimpy with their greens.  I don't think that I have to mention them here.  So I am asking Cafe Beyond that if you are reading this review, please.. PLEASE.. fill up your salad bowls with greens! Greens aren't that expensive.  I would love to go there more often, but because of this I go elsewhere (on the avenue) for my salad bowls.  I sure hope that they read this review. Thanks.",,1,1
14,Igor M.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,1,0,3.0,7/27/2015,"Short and simple... My girl and I had the chicken banh mi sandwich and added the medium size soup.  We got over charged with the regular price for the soup when they have a sign posted saying that once you add a soup to the sandwich it will be about 2 dollar below the regular price and also we didn't even get a receipt. Also, I saw one of the workers (looked like the manager) getting his phone out and use it with out even changing his gloves. I work in the food industry and that's two things. Stealing from costumes and health violation. Peace!",1,,
15,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, NY",117,327,83,4.0,5/26/2014,"NOTE: This is just a review for their breakfast. I've never had their lunch or other food options, I literally just stop in for breakfast once in a while.This is right around the corner from the office, and they have a pretty solid breakfast. I like getting the two egg option with mushrooms & spinach, on focaccia bread if they have. You basically get the breakfast sandwich for $5 - and it's so filling that I'm sometimes full until dinner (depending on how busy I am that day - normally I'm full until 2PM if I eat it at 8:45AM).Just a tip: it's pretty bland unless you specifically ask the guy making your eggs to add salt & pepper. And you'll have to ask for ketchup when you're checking out too. The staff is relatively polite - you sometimes have to deal with the BB&B employees cutting you in line in order to get your food... but whatever. As long as I get my food and make it to the office on time, I'm a happy girl.",,1,

17,Madeleine J.,"Thousand Island Park, NY",0,7,1,4.0,6/14/2015,"First, this is the most clever Cafe. Not only is it in the lobby of a major shopping center, but it is called Cafe Beyond while being situated right next to Bed, Bath, & Beyond!After doing some major shopping at the aforementioned, I wanted to sit down, so this seemed logical. The interior is white and crisp; everything looks clean, and everything was very fresh! I had the lobster bisque, which was delicious and creamy and came with a big slice of sour dough bread, along with the mango smoothie (I forgot the name, but it featured avocado and spinach and was so yummy!). A cute place to grab a bite after shopping.",,1,
18,Stephanie W.,"Bethesda, MD",558,233,54,4.0,12/16/2014,"Surprisingly pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area it's definitely a viable option. They have a good selection of sandwiches and the bread that they use is from Balthazar and tastes pretty fresh. The prices are pretty standard for lunch in Manhattan - I wouldn't exactly say it's a deal or big money-saver. I tried the BBQ chicken sandwich. My friend had the avocado chicken sandwich. Both were good. Also, service was fast.",,1,
19,Katherine B.,"GLEN OAKS, NY",1,21,0,2.0,4/28/2013,"So, my boyfriend and I were pretty hungry, and we wanted something quick to eat. We spotted this cafe and gave it a try. Honestly, this cafe is in the strangest location; it's right in Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Anyway, we ordered a wild mushroom flatbread pizza. I thought this was okay. It was my first time having a flatbread pizza. However, the flatbread was so thin and hard for me to eat because it kept falling apart. Also, it was so greasy that I had to pat the pizza with so many napkins to remove the disgusting, oily substanceAs for the cleaniness, the tables were pretty dirty.I am so not coming here again.

At that point my husband spoke with the manager Mario about the terrible customer service, but Mario said the worker did nothing wrong ....  The manager should have approached us when he realized there was an issue, but he decided not to address the situation and refused to listen.  It's unfortunate that the poor customer service starts with management.",1,,
24,Caitlin A.,"San Francisco, CA",1,6,0,5.0,10/2/2012,"I was prepping for one of those epic trips to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and needed something to fuel my shopping fury. I was excited to find Cafe Beyond literally right inside BBB, looking so tasty and convenient. There were a lot of options to choose from. Did I want a salad (probably not!)? A burrito? A panini? Ultimately on this chilly, rainy, fall day I went with a combo of a chicken burrito with a side of corn chowder. I was tempted by the great looking cookies and cupcakes, but did not give in. The choices never ended, and I was wondering how big my mission-style (I am from San Francisco, so I take that title VERY seriously) was going to get. The server was patient as I thought through every option like I was picking out a new duvet cover. When the burrito was finally rolled up, it was the size of a small baby, which is just the way I remember them from back home.I sat at a table by the window and devoured as much as I could, and ended up having enough to bring home for an after-shopping snack.If you're in the area and want a quick but satisfying bite, I totally recommend Cafe Beyond. Next time I need a new shower curtain, I will also be trying the paninis!",,1,

I got a weird look from my server when I asked for soy milk in my cappuccino and my cappuccino isnt exactly a cappuccino--it is soy milk with espresso; there isnt any foam.  So this seems like a good place for lunch if u have the time for the slow service, but it isnt great for good coffee.",1,,

My order had migrated from the cashier, to the guy behind the bagel counter, to the manager, and back to the cashier, yet no one had even started to make it.

Staff where polite and kind I orderd a soup and brownie for desert with a soda and it came to 7$ which was way overpriced for what it was. The soup was almost like drinking flavord water and it lacked much chicken and noodles. All the soup had was basicly a few carrot chunks and cellrey parts. My brownie I could not tell if I was eating a pound cake slice or a brwonie as it was so cumbly and tasted like plastic that it was wrapped in.

A great option for vegetarians or vegans is a burrito made with their ""vegetable medley""; it's a seasoned mix of all different kinds of roast vegetables and they claim that all their beans are vegetarian. Also, apparently the Monterrey jack shredded cheese is lowfat. Note: the brown rice can occasionally get hard on top (when it's overcooked in that hotbar thing) so ask them to get you rice from the bottom or open a new rice tray. They have a good salad bar too, with the option of lettuce or a spinach bowl, and great toppings like soybeans, eggwhites, roasted eggplant or zucchini chunks etc..NOTES: I do agree with Caroline C. that the chicken soup sucks though.AND I'll agree with the others who say that the tendency for long lines (often combined with incompetent cafe employees) can be exasperating. But, I will also say that there have been various times that I've experienced very good service from Cafe Beyond employees (sad to say, I haven't seen many of those faces for a while, I think they must've all ""moved on"" haha).",,,
46,Lauren C.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",33,88,4,4.0,3/2/2008,"This place is near where I work.  I love their soups, wraps, burritos, and chocolate brownies.Soups are excellent -- in this includes the turkey chili, which I get often and highly recommend.  In regards to soups, I love the tomato cheddar and chicken noodle soup.  Can't say too much about the wraps outside of the chicken Caesar ones, because they're the only one that I've had.  Very good, delicious, and filling.  Burritos are amazing and very filling.  You can get a burrito made fresh for you however you want it.  They're a bit pricey  - 6+ dollars but will fill you up for the rest of the day.  Simply amazing.The line during lunch peak times can get fairly extensive, so if you're in a hurry, this place might not be for you during that time.  But then again, this applies to pretty much any food place in the area.Bonus points for this place being open till 9, which is great for those putting in overtime.",,,

48,Amme P.,"London, United Kingdom",210,604,5,3.0,4/23/2008,"Way beyond I'd say.  This place is bizarre, and yet ordinary at the same time.  It's just what you'd expect in ""cafe"".  Soup, sandwiches and such.  But seriously, why on earth would you go eat in the Bed Bath and Beyond?  You're in New York for crying out loud!!!",2,2,4
49,Jamie S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0,1.0,11/28/2012,"used to be good but now everything tastes old and reheated.  salad was limp and with the exception of the abundance of dried cranberries, there was hardly anything else.  so was basically limp spinach greens and dried cranberries, mmm (not).  they also can not seem to get any delivery order correct even though i always order online so it's typed out for them - the last 3 times i've ordered from them, something was wrong with my order so they had to come back with the right thing - by then not hungry.  will never make the mistake of going or ordering from there again, too many great options to deal with such mediocrity.",1,,
50,Larry C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,4.0,10/23/2011,"At first I found this place because I was shopping at BBB, now I shop at BBB AFTER I grab a quick bite. Frankly, I am not a ""foodie"" by any means but I refuse to eat crap.  Fortunately for me, this place resides at the elusive intersection of ""affordable"" and ""quality.""  Additionally, If you like to be waited on by a well informed and polite staff, I highly recommend it.  My favorites are the Burrito's, hands down while  my partner loves the salad options, and she's the picky one! Good eating!",,1,
51,greg w.,"Brooklyn, NY",253,4,0,1.0,1/12/2009,"I stopped in here because I was starving and in a hurry after buying a dishrack. They charged $18 for a forgettable sandwich, a bland cup of soup and a bottle of juice. When I asked the woman at the counter if they had salt or pepper, she waved her hand in the direction of the plastic knives and forks and mumbled something like, ""If it's not over there I don't know where it is."" Cafe Beyond Ridiculous would be a better name.",1,1,
52,Patrick P.,"Woodstock, VT",45,211,0,3.0,8/5/2009,"I randomly stopped in here because I was going to Bed Bath and Beyond, and was starving.  In short, it's a little deli attached the store.  That being said, it's better than you'd expect, and they made a fine turkey sandwich.  A totally decent place to eat if you're starving in Chelsea.",,1,
53,Daniel K.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,485,6,3.0,12/4/2008,i always used to get salad here and loved that the security guard thanked me for getting lunch at this bizarre bed bath and beyond partnered place.,,,1
