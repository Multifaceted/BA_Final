0,Emily C.,"Queens, NY",12,8,0.0,4.0,6/23/2018,"Look, it's aight, but it's also pricey, and as a college student, anything more than fifteen dollars per person turns into a bloodbath for my checking account. Their meat was juicy and well-marinated, the veggies were bomb.com, and the banchan was refilled multiple times, so I give massive kudos to the staff for constantly keeping up updated. But for three people, a set can only feed three starved-college girls so far before we even concede that McDonalds will fill us for around ten dollars cheaper per person. As John D said, ""non-Koreans who read the NY Times"" will find this place palatable. And if you have time and money to take a field trip on the LIRR to start with, your bank accounts will probably be fine, too.Note that I am giving four stars for the food and service. Otherwise, please find a cheaper place. I don't let my personal ideas of pricing affect my ratings because, well, they're personal and the food was honestly good.",3,,
1,An H.,"Nesconset, NY",114,146,5,3.0,11/5/2018,"This place was recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a try. People here are friendly yet a little bit pushy when ordering. They basically want you to order more food. You have to order at least 2 BBQ plates for them to cook in front of you or they'll just cook in the kitchen and bring it to you. We ordered the marinated beef and beef tongue BBQ. Both are delicious. In terms of side dishes they definitely give you more variety but in smaller quantity comparing to other BBQ places. We also ordered the seafood pancake. It was crispy and filled with scallion...very delicious but not a lot of seafood. I asked them about the 5% off while check-in on Yelp and they said they don't honor it anymore but still gave me the discount.  Comparing to Han Joo, which is 2 doors down this place is definitely more expansive whilet the food is about the same. I am going back to Han Joo~",,,
2,Carolyn Z.,"Flushing, NY",387,254,490,1.0,8/26/2018,"The service here is trash. If you aren't Korean they disregard you and barely serve you. It is NOT AYCE, its priced per portion and extremely overpriced!!!  The waitresses are cold and mean. There are so many kbbq spots in flushing that are better. I don't know why anyone would come here. KHD on northern is my go to spot and well worth the wait and price per person there.",3,1,
3,Emily W.,"Forest Hills, NY",69,111,752,4.0,6/5/2018,"Their food is super delicious. The marinated kalbi or even the non marinated one just tastes so amazing. If you have a craving for meat and just want to stuff your face until your food baby grows an extra few inches, definitely come here!The staff are polite, sometimes. If we need refills or want to order more, they will come to us right away, sometimes. I went during rush hour and it seemed like there were only 2 or 3 staff manning the whole entire place. So I give it up to them for still being able to be calm in such a hectic environment.",,,
4,Margaret R.,"Santa Clara, CA",186,1049,34,5.0,9/30/2018,"I'm surprised this place only has 3.5 stars? This place was great! My friends took my bf and me here when we were visiting.

5,So P.,"Queens, NY",60,79,881,5.0,6/25/2018,"I come here not for the Kbbq, but for their gookbap. They do it better than a gookbap joint. They give you a decent amount of their meat in the soup too. The meat pieces are so amazing, perfectly chewy, and juicy. I take a lot of pride in this place and I love bringing my friends here. My family always to-go's this and we eat a lit meal at home. 2 orders can feed 3-4 of my family members depending on how hungry we are.",,,
6,Jane K.,"Manhattan, NY",96,135,388,4.0,5/12/2018,My go-to spot for Korean bbq! Food is consistently good and the ladies are very accommodating. We had kalbi for two and the seafood pancake. The pancake was fried perfectly and the kalbi was marinated/grilled perfectly as well. They give you a lot of side dishes and they also give you the option of either dwenjang jigae or soondooboo jigae. Only downside to this place is the parking. The place also gets packed during weekends but they do offer valet parking.,1,1,2
7,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,1.0,6/30/2017,"Aaah, why is Korean barbecue so hit or miss?! Yes, the galbi here was tasty. But the uncomfortable and harassing service makes this place a never-again. Couple that with the fact that there's such great kbbq for less wallet damage, seconds away... Nope nope nope. Mapo's specialty is galbi - a steak sized chunk of it, unmarinated. $40 for a single person portion. Like many kbbq spots, there's no tabletop grilling unless you get 2+ orders of meat. If you only get 1 order, they just cook it in the back and talk shit about you. We walked in with a group of 5 at 6:30pm on a Friday. The place was empty, with all the waitresses gathered at a table gossiping.I told our waitress we wanted to start with an order of galbi and one naengmyun (cold noodle) while people who had arrived late decided the rest. The woman began to insist that the galbi was just one portion and refused to take the order, even when I promised we were going to add more soon. She wouldn't even put in an order for non-bbq items. When I exasperatedly added more meat (samgyeopsal), she said that those were cooked on separate grills, and therefore didn't ""count,"" and continued insisting, ""Galbi only one person. Very small. Just for one person."" I kept a submissive and respectful tone, because pissing off the people prepping your food is a bad idea, and a restaurant can enforce arbitrary policies if they'd like. But her demeanor was so condescending while being totally uncommunicative, it was infuriating!-- Look, lady, at a place where I'm spending over $40 per person, I would've thought we could order at a reasonable pace and not be harangued out of your paranoia that you won't make a good enough tip. We had a group, you think we're just getting one order of meat? The galbi was good, but nothing spectacular. The charcoal grilling makes little to no difference. The fact that all the meat came at once and was ready at the same time meant that half was cold and overcooked by the time we put it on our mouths. Thanks, Mapo. Banchan were not bad, I liked their gyeranjjim. We had to request rice when none appeared.When they had charged my credit card, the waitress returned within seconds and attempted to take the bill back before I had looked at it. When I said I wasn't ready yet, she stood RIGHT NEXT TO ME while I was scribbling tip. Wow. Really classy. I would've tipped lower, but I'm sure they are totally shameless in yelling at us right in the restaurant about not tipping 20 percent.We didn't get any orange slices or any other fruits for dessert like we saw another table getting. Overall, they made us feel extremely unwelcome, which is pretty much a foremost consideration if you choose to go out. I sense that others, especially if your group is white or appropriately Korean, will have better luck - this seems like a place that judges based on that.",16,5,6
8,John D.,"New York, NY",300,275,0,2.0,5/1/2018,"Don't believe the hype!  This is even worse than the most touristy tourist trap in K-Town Manhattan, probably because of the inexplicably gushing press.  Mapo has found its niche: non-Koreans who read the NY Times; don't know much if anything about Korean food; and find themselves on a field trip on the Long Island railroad.To begin with: This is place is grotesquely overpriced!!$$$!!  Figure at least $40 for choice or worse beef, and more $$$ for better quality.  Service is typical for an ""authentic"" Korean restaurant, meaning one that hasn't gotten a clue about Western manners: rushed and rushing, aggressive, cold and mean, with no one even cracking a smile during their attempts to turn over tables as fast as possible.In no way should anyone travel out here, way past the last stop on the 7 train, just because the Times's condescending reviewers tell you that it's ""authentic"" Korean cue.  It's no better than the food on 32d Street; it's far more expensive; and the service is equally nasty.Yeccchh.",5,2,2
9,Lili L.,"Mineola, NY",104,152,64,2.0,11/27/2017,"It's really between a 2 and 3 stars, but I asked myself if I would ever return to this place and the answer was no.  The service is hit or miss depending on which waitress you get.  One of them was slightly rude and inattentive and then there were a couple who were super nice and attentive.  The food was average and the ban chan was a bit lacking.  The prices were a little steep for what you get.  Given the amount of great places nearby, I can't give this more than 2 stars.",1,1,
10,John H K.,"Great Neck, NY",0,3,1,1.0,9/10/2018,"Very disappointed.  We came several times before and food was ok.  Not this time, Food was terrible.  Seems like they are cutting corners and new Cook, most of food was very bland and no taste.  1) Kimchee soup was not good.  Whoever made it never had Kimchee soup before. Tasted terrible.  2) Japchae was very bland, no taste.  3) Small side dishes was very little 4) The only thing good tonight was seafood pancake and OB beer.I will not be going again.",,,
11,Leah C.,"New York, NY",1,54,30,4.0,10/22/2017,"Their galbi is expensive ($40 per one portion size) but absolutely legit -- probably the best I've had in the States, only second to LA itself. It's not too sweetly marinated, and the charcoal adds that smokey flavor for an additional touch. The service is friendly if you can speak Korean and ask your emo nicely for banchan refills. Pro Tip: Make sure to ask if you can switch the steel grills in between each course/different meat types to avoid mixing flavors, and because they burn pretty easily on top of the charcoal.",,,1
12,Sam C.,"New York, NY",2,82,19,2.0,8/28/2017,"The place is small, not clean, and service was terrible, the waitresses weren't polite and (it could be me, but) I noticed a table of Korean women who were seated long after us was served much quicker. I saw a waitress fill bowls with some kind of drink and it was getting all over her fingers in the bowl (due to the way she was holding it), and she served it. After preparing our food on the grill, a waitress stuck the tongs between the table (so one half of the tongs was on top and the other half was under the table--so dirty and unappetizing). After switching our used plates for new ones, there were sauce stains on the new dishes. Beer was not served with a glass or even opened for us and there were flies around our food.We were seated by the back corner so waitresses were constantly leaning over me to grab trays of appetizers with no ""excuse me"" or anything. There are plenty of better Korean BBQ places in the area. Don't waste your time and money here.You can also only BBQ at the table if you get 2 or more dishes otherwise they cook it in the back and it has to be two specific dishes.",2,,1
13,Linh V.,"Atlantic Beach, NY",12,48,237,3.0,10/21/2017,"Three star for the price, after trying most of the BBQ along the 149th pl, we think Mapo price is a little bit higher than most family style restaurants around the area, however, compare to Hahm Ji Bach it should be similar. Price just a tiny bit higher like $10-20. Another reason why three star is on Yelp, the business said they will discount 5% or one free dish if order two more BBQ but it not happen to us, well we kind of not knowing until after but they don't even mention. Food: was great, although they brought wrong order. I order non marinated beef and marinated pork, they brought both marinated. This place is the only place on 149th pl using real charcoal to grill, which made the meat so tender. Seasoning is not too sweet unlike others, that's what I love. Banchan selection is okay, not wow, the table next to us has a crab banchan which we don't, I assume it's because they are the regular and we not. Lol. Other places also offer free soup, this place don't. I paid for my clams and tofu soup with $12sth. Not too happy about it. This place is definitely worth a try, only the price is a bit higher",,,
14,Jacob B.,"Lehi, UT",118,1,0,1.0,6/9/2018,"I am not exaggerating when I say that coming here was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant ever! I'm so blown away by how awful the experience was, I'm literally writing my first yelp review because of it! We agreed to paying $40/person for al you can eat, But when they brought the food out, they ended up charging us shitloads for each individual side plate of kimchi and corn. At the end of the night, I was still hungry, and ended up going across the street to buy a plate of ribs and rice. Seriously, if you're Caucasian, don't go here. THEY WILL SCAM YOU!!",1,1,1
15,Shanna J.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,50,4,1.0,11/27/2017,"Scammers.  If you're not Korean they will give you the TINIEST portions of meat. Looking at the photos on yelp, I'm annoyed at what a contrast there I from my what I received compared to others.  Such a joke.  Had to ask for rice, had to ask to have two salads instead of one.  The ban Chan was so lackluster and literally a bite per person.  Could not even believe the prices.  I'm sure I could do better BBQ on my hot plate at home.   It's amazing how stupid they will make you feel for asking for things.The steamed egg that came was also a smaller portion.  It's amazing how they managed to skimp on even that.  Not even the effort to garnish with green onion.Lastly I ordered yookgejjang and the portioned it out between two bowls and took away.  Leave me the pot of stew that I ordered!",4,1,1

18,Anthony G.,"Nesconset, NY",509,1526,6976,2.0,2/25/2017,"Rather aggravating Flushing Korean restaurant.  First off, the menu is incredibly small for a restaurant that claims to specialize in barbecue.  They only have four choices (bulgogi is not one of them nor LA galbi).  We were a party of four and the waitress pretty much told us what to order and talked us into an $18 small portion of japchae.  The meal came with a very large variety of bonchon.  Unfortunately, the bonchon was the star of the meal.  Great kimchi, pickled radish, tofu soup and many others.  The barbecue meats were seriously under marinaded and the japchae lacked flavor.  Service was welcoming but prices are rather high.  Not recommended.",17,6,10
19,Tsz-Cheong C.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",850,486,9147,4.0,6/5/2016,"Great Korean barbeque restaurant, but 1st you have to find it. A little buried away in a small section of Korean barbeque restaurants. Finding parking is a nightmare, but fortunately they contracted out private valets to park your car if you so desire, listen, use them, it's worth it.The place is very small but gives you the illusion that it's bigger by lining one side of the wall with mirrors. One of the big draws of this place is the use of wood charcoal and cuts of Angus beef kalbi. After ordering the banchans start arriving at our table, they give you plenty of little plates of deliciousness that literally covers up every square inch of your table. We especially liked the Korean steam egg (Gyeran jjim)The smoke from the wood really infuses a nice light smoky flavor. The beef is tender and tasty. They give you plenty of romaine lettuce for you to wrap up the kalbi and fill it with all the sauce, paste and banchans around your table to wrap up a delicious pocket of yumminess! We ordered the pork belly as well, though not as flavorful as the beef, the variety of banchans and sauces woke up the flavor of the pork belly. As a note the pork belly is not cooked on the wood charcoal, but instead on a portable gas stove top pan. The Service staff here is top notch, our waitress not only took our order but cook and cut up the meats for us as well.  Our waitress was grilling the kalbi with one hand and grilling the pork belly on another grill with the other, she was a multitasking beauty.We also ordered a casserole of seafood tofu. The tofu was silky smooth and the kimchi broth was delicious. The casserole had clams, shrimp, squid and of course tofu. It went well with a bowl of rice. A Great big shout out and thank you to the guy's who help set and take away the wood charcoal pots. Now get ready to dish out some dough because the meats are not cheap. The price you see on the menu is a serving size for 1 person, not 2. You don't get a lot of food for the price, so if you're really hungry, get ready to shell out some good money. The quality is there and you're going to pay for it. A definite winner though when it comes to Korean barbeque.",55,38,51
20,Jessica L.,"Flushing, NY",245,158,1909,4.0,5/4/2017,"This may be the first charcoal korean bbq ive been to and i must admit, the charcoal gives the meat that taste like no other. the meat is very tender and flavorful. your meal also comes with an abundance of side dishes. Place gets packed and it was always packed on the nights that we go, which is usually a weekend. This isnt a typical weeknight eatery, we need to drive and parking is always touch and next day is a work day.

21,Pat F.,"Bronx, NY",330,255,1801,4.0,3/13/2016,"I was thinking the same exact thing as my lunch partners; is it Kalbi or Galbi? Such novices we are. I also pondered if that juicy, tender, charcoaly, marbled meat that we kept ordering was Kobe or the likes thereof, but it's called Kalbi/Galbi. Oh, what the heck do I know? I'll just google it later. When I come back to Mapo BBQ, I will try to find parking immediately, which is hard to do, 'cause everyone has a freaking car and residential and commercial street parking sucks! No, maybe I'll just take the LIRR, because it's directly across the street from Mapo. Yup, that's what I'll do, I'll take the train instead. That way I'll get to the restaurant faster and then get to sit my derrière down quicker and then get to order nothing else but that Kalbi/Galbi and maybe I'll include that awesome seafood pancake while enjoying the assorted banchan. Yup, that's my plan for my next visit, which will lead me to being one very content woman who will need nothing else and if you follow my lead, you won't either. RATINGS:Price: Above Average (If you keep ordering more meat and a bunch of everything else like we did)Service: Way Above average (We lacked nothing)Atmosphere: Average old school cafeteria-like Food: Above AverageYelp Peeps: Way above averageI would be remiss not to mention that thanks to Yelp I had the opportunity to share this meal with some L.I.

You don't even need to speak to them. They already now what to bring you, when to cook your meat, how to add condiments for you, etc... This is not a chic, preppy spot. It's very basic.

And I had the Grand pleasure of doing so with some friends & fellow Yelpers Cindy L., Pat F., & Steve M. I need to say thank you to Yelp, because where else can you get a group of strangers to meet each other in a totally unknown place to any of us, for a delicious shared meal?! Then we had the nerve to continue on to bar down the street for some cocktails, football & a few games of pool!The place was a little tricky to find but when we got there Cindy had already gotten us a table. It was a small place & simple in Decor. What I loved most was that it was real hardwood charcoal grills in the middle of the table. It really gave the meat an amazing flavor, oddly it wasn't smoky, just really really good. We started off with the Pork Belly & Kalbi, only to be told we had to order 2 meats for the grill..Huh?! Isn't that 2 meats?! The waiter went on to explain(Thank goodness for Stevie because his Spanish helped us with the waiter) that the Pork Belly gets cooked on an electric grill so that doesn't count. Oooooh ok, no problem we'll take an order of Pork Ribs also then. Of these meats I thought the pork would rock my tastebuds, but NOOO! They were good, don't misconstrue my meaning. But the GALBI or is it KALBI?! Holy Geez Moley! Talk about tender & flavorful! I cannot say I've had a better cut of meat more tender AND flavorful. My mouth is watering just reliving those moments. And the Side dishes were OFF THE CHARTS! I don't know the proper name for them but we had a table full of yummy goodness. Favorites that come to mind are the roasted peppers with small dried fish, maybe tiny anchovies not sure but that was my favorite out of all the side dishes. Then there was the steamed eggs dish that came out bubbling hot, so fluffy, so differently delicious. There was macaroni salad, I wasn't a fan but my table mates enjoyed it. Grilled Corn, Kimchee Pancakes, Boiling hot Tofu Seafood soup(AWEsome!), multigrain rice, roasted garlic, onions, fried eel lacey stuff, Kimchee, Lettuce, etc.After all of that yeah we still wanted more, Hey! We're Yelpers! Would you expect anything different?! So we ordered the Beef Tongue & another order of the Beef Galbi/Kalbi. Sooooo Scrumdillyicious!I will say the food was great, but the best part was spending time getting to know my fellow Yelpers. What a privilege it is to be blessed by Yelp with such great cool people.

In fact the place is kinda dumpy. Service can be abrupt also but what makes up for it is the super tender amazing cuts off kalbi. They don't offer a while lot in terms of banchan but again the beef makes up for it. We had many orders of beef being that I was dining with the boys. That washed down with soju or bakseju was total nomzville. I will put up with semi rude service and dumpy decor for the tasty kalbi. Not often that I would say something like this but in this situation I would!! The place is always packed so there is really no good time to go.

Consistently solid bbq spot for good quality galbi, but not much other choices if you're looking for a wide variety on the grill.One of the best things they do is use actual charcoal, which imparts a slight smokiness that I enjoy. The thickness and tenderness of its galbi is another reason why I return here so often. When cooked right, it is one of the most delicious piece of beef anywhere.On the down side, the banchan is where they lack a bit, but not bad by any means. Also, prices are a tiny bit higher than its nearby competitors.All in all, I wouldn't be returning here regularly if I didn't feel like it's one of the better Korean BBQ joints in NYC.

We have been 100s of time in Korean Restaurant including the Korean super market H mart, so this place has best BBQ.Side dishes are below average and some of them don't even taste good.I apreaciate the second lady ( waitress ) who helped us to enjoy the best, oh yea they forgot our one dish  ( Khimchi Pancake ) but never mind we were already full.May be may not coming back, but there are many good places around this neighborhood....",,,

So we asked the server about this. She said ""no no, no all free. Only one."" Maybe it's because I'm not Korean, that's why it's not all free? Or is it just false advertisement? I would've stayed to try their food but the server was trying to make us order food immediately to seal the deal so we can't leave the restaurant after we order.

We're actually very familiar with this little nexus of Korean restaurants in Flushing. We've been going to Hahm Ji Bach down the block for years. Mapo has a more casual and homey atmosphere, created by the all-women wait staff and the friendly matriarch that seems to run the place. The place draws a range of diners, from packs of hungry young 20-somethings instagramming their food to Korean and Chinese families with young kids to old Korean men deep in conversation. Ultimately it's the food that connects us. The kalbi is tender and tasty, the sides are varied and replenished. Our six year old son loves the steamed egg dish and they will often bring him a second one on the house. In other words, it's a place where you feel taken care of.

Why is it even on the menu if your customers can't barbecue it on the stove .?!????anyways after we ordered they were legit rushing us to leave .

Before you know it, you'll be packing kalbi, onion, rice, garlic, jalapenos, and ssamjang into lettuce wraps and trying to stuff the entire thing in your mouth in one bite. The kalbi is tender, juicy, and super flavorful. SO GOOD! After BBQing, we followed tradition and had naengmyun. We tried 2 different types of the cold noodles-- one in an icy broth, and the other in a spicy sauce with no broth. Both were very refreshing after all the heat from the BBQ, and the texture of the noodles were on POINT!I see a lot of comments/complaints on the price of this restaurant. Yes, a serving of kalbi costs $39... BUT we ordered 3 servings for 5 people and it was more than enough. We were stuffed by the time the noodles came out and rolling out of the restaurant by the time we were done.With tax and tip, everything came out to $37 per person which I agree isn't cheap enough for an everyday meal, but it's certainly not expensive enough to stop me from coming back for more delicious charcoal-grilled juicy kalbi!",21,11,17

Pork BBQ was very good too.I would have loved a bigger quantity...but I know this cannot happen here, these are the standard BBQ quantities so enjoy every little piece or pay another 38$ per portion.The side dishes (which you know, come along with the BBQ and are not to be chosen, just taken) were so many, of course some I loved and some I almost didn't finish as they were not specifically my taste.They bring you tea, japanese style (nut smell, love it) and water. And the President, a nice and smiling Lady, comes and see if everything is alright during the meal.It was a pretty fast lunch, it seems like they need the tables clean for the following hungry clients...

Not sure how the restaurant owners make money with this selection. Thank you. Second, never get in the way of a sharp pair of scissors in the hands of a Korean woman! haha. Finally, the hot Korean charcoal is hot and not so smokey. For ordered marinated kalbi ribs and pork belly for our bbq selections. The pork belly has 3 layers of yumminess. I generally prefer leaner cuts of meat. However, the pork belly is tremendous. The kalbi marinate is full of flavor and is always cooked to perfection.I have a fondness for this restaurant.

MAPO IS BETTER. real hardwood charcoal is delivered to your table. the meat itself is a luscious marinated cut of premium steak, marbled and deep red in color. the scorching hot charcoal will result in a bite that is seared just right.   wash it down with a korean beer, soju, and some of the delicious jjigae that comes with every bbq order. finish with a bowl of nengmyun. every good kalbi house must also have great nengmyun.

We decided to wait it out and finally got seated after 40 minutes. Although the wait was a bit long, it was well worth it as we were immediately served with a slew of banchans (Korean side dishes) that filled our table to savory goodness. Best of all they never once snickered when we asked for more banchans and they still kept them coming as they emptied the plates of banchans onto our table. As for the kalbi, the taste was seriously out of this world! The meat was super tender, juicy and delicious. It was not overly marinated so we could still taste the freshness and essence of the beef.Without a doubt, if you're looking to taste really good Korean food and you don't mind trekking into Queens, then I would say this restaurant is for you!

72,Star O.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,144,31,3.0,2/22/2017,"The kalbi is better than a lot of other korean bbq places.  I feel this is mostly due to the grill- actual charcoal being used makes a big difference in the flavor of the meat.  However, it definitely isn't the best kalbi in NYC.  Their price (almost $40/serving) and portions aren't great- very pricey for what you get.  Service was great- very friendly waitresses who always check to make sure you get what you need.  Their side dishes (banchan) is really lacking.  If you're looking for great side dishes- this is not the place to come.  While they do have a lot- it just doesn't taste that great-  Lacking in flavor and mediocre at best.  To be honest I probably wouldn't return.  There are many better places out there.Parking: valet is a plus (no charge, just tip).",1,,
73,Kate Y.,"Queens, NY",211,189,587,5.0,1/6/2015,"Best kalbi in NYC, hands down. *Drop mic, walk away.*Seriously though. This small, intimate eatery located in the heart of Murray Hill (across the street from the LIRR station) specializes in marinated, thick cut angus beef kalbi grilled over charcoal - gas lighter cannot compare! Most recently, a group of ten of us came here on a Saturday... And it was insanely packed! It is usually very busy on weekends, but I've never seen it like this before. Turns out, recently there was a New York Times article that featured Mapo, so now of course, hordes of foodies have all gathered here. (Curse you, NYT.) I was speaking with the owner and she said that between 7-9 is the busiest time (of course), so if you come before or after that time, the wait shouldn't be too long. After hovering by the entrance breathing in the intoxicating smell of grilled meat for about half an hour, the group of ten in the corner left and we were seated. Hurrah!My advice would be to order the marinated Mapo Kalbi. That's it. As much of it as you can devour. The end. But, on this day, I was dining with several non-Koreans so we ordered some other non-meat dishes that were on the menu. Seafood pancake, Japchae (Glass noodles), dumplings. My group enjoyed them all, though I didn't try em so I can't testify to it myself. Towards the end of the meal, we got some soft tofu soup on the house and the group enjoyed that as well.Onto the meat. How to eat kalbi: Once one of the ladies cut the meat into chunks and declare it to be ready, grab a lettuce. Place meat, marinated onions, bean paste, garlic and pepper on lettuce. Make a wrap. Eat it. Repeat. And repeat. And repeat. If raw garlic is not your thing (or if you're on a date or something), ask them to grill garlic for you. They will give you a little tin 'bowl' with garlic and sesame oil. Once the sesame oil starts to boil, wait another 5 minutes (mix occasionally so it doesn't burn). This will result in a very soft, savory cooked garlic that is without the sharp smell and taste of raw garlic. Since Mapo is a Korean restaurant, of course you will be served a variety of side dishes. All are tasty but of note are the grilled corn (""Best corn ever"" -said J) and fluffy egg. Sometimes they will have spicy raw marinated crab... So good!At the end of the meal, Koreans typically finish with a bowl of mool nengmyun. This is a chilled soup with buckwheat noodles; in it are slices of radishes, cucumber, pear, beef and half of a hard boiled egg. Add vinegar and mustard to taste. Enjoy!",13,8,9

There are also a lot of yummy sides (like the cheese corn). The only downside would be that if you drive, you will have difficulty looking for parking.

Instead of refilling side dishes, they just take it away. My friend ordered naengmyun and never got it. Waitress finally realized it after we practically finished. At the end, they also rushed us with the check and was rude about signing the tab. We obviously know to sign, give us more than 30 seconds while we decide to give tip on card or cash okay? Goodness.

This place is pretty big and even has a separate location two stores down. The free appetizers are really good here. There's a lot of variety.

81,Michael L.,"New York, NY",88,122,626,1.0,11/4/2014,"Oh-Ehm-Gee!! Came here when it wasn't busy, because we read rave reviews about this place and we were craving really good Korean BBQ. Right off the bat, the waitress gave us menu and asked if we ready to order. She was standing by and pointing to the most extensive option on the menu and we ended up picking that. She told us that we had to pick that if we wanted the meat cooked at the table, otherwise the rest would be prepared in the back kitchen. Early on, we were smiles and laughter about the rush service, but that quickly came to a halt. She was rushing and rushing us and we felt misplaced. We kind of lost appetite and the food was probably better than we felt at the time. Really, the food I thought was going to be good and she was cooking it for us, I expected that we would have had hands on like other bbq houses I had. The best part is the end -- this part. We asked for the check, after waiting 10 minutes for her to come to our table.  She finally came and we paid with Card and tipped 25%. We spent about $140 estimated. Once we signed and left, we walked to our car outside and stepped into our car. I was pulling out and headed to the light at the corner, when all of a sudden... I notice the waitresses from the same place come out all operational and something seemed funny about it. They were looking for someone and they were quite hostile and desperate looking. I thought to self -- maybe they are looking for us?So, I had an instinct (sincerely). An instinct, to see if perhaps they were looking for us. We were one of two tables there and we were the only table that left.They didn't see us at all and I really could have driven off, but I didnt. I clicked my window down and waived out calling them over. My goodnes, they finally heard us and glanced our way. They hurdled over and said we took the merchant copy -- not necessarily in such inscribed way -- so I searched my pocket and by golly they were right. However, they didn't have to act so aggressive. Nonetheless, I gave them the merchant copy and they took it. That's rigjt, just snatched it and left -- with nervous twitching and all.No, Thank You? No, nothing? Great.Obviously, we aren't coming back and I don't think they care anyway lol -- but I'm sure we tipped better than the usual.The good: most comicalThe bad: most comical",6,7,3

The lady immediately said ""what? For all of you? This is a BBQ place. It's not gonna be enough!"". I told her we plan to get noodles and pancakes on the side. She answered : ""what noodles? We serve meat here!"" They have cold noodles and stuff but obviously she wants to make more tips. We thought about leaving but since we parked (very hard to find parking there), we stayed.When the meat came, we all thought that was only one order of beef. Ended up it was 2. We dropped our jaws and we're all shocked. We have been to so many other Korean BBQ places. Never this small portion. We asked about the portion, lady said ""we have been around for 30 years! We are very well known!"" So $85 gone....because they are famous. All in all, bad service, super small portion. Go to jongro. U will be much happier. Never Coming Back.",6,2,

We were lucky that we had a small party of 3 that we got seated right away. It felt like we were in a war zone. Plates clattering around, waiters talking loudly between themselves, carts with food  pacing between the tables..just loud and chaotic We sat down and chatted among ourselves and the waitress told us to order first and chat later. WTF?! for real!? We ordered 2 orders of kalbi and one spicy squid and udon noddlesThe food came within like 5 mins i swear..the waiter pretty much just slammed everything down two slices of kalbi for nearly $62 dollars..damn! and definitely not the best kalbi I had..not too  much flavor, and a bit thick. and for that price? not worth it! Lots of ban chan and they were pretty good. The spicy squid noddles were just ok in my opinionMinus one star for the service and minus one star for the chaotic ambiance, and minus one star for just ok food with high price I think I would rather go somewhere else, sarangban down the street offers buy one kalbi get one free, go there instead!",4,2,

85,Jeff K.,"Bergen County, NJ",560,276,1293,4.0,8/23/2014,"This place is kinda far from the Main st, Flushing stop on the 7 train. I think its almost a mile away, so its a bit of a walk. Since this is one of the more popular Korean kalbi places in Flushing, I had to try it.The kalbi marinade was done nicely and the meat was of good quality. The service here was also really good as well. My water and bachan was always refilled as soon as I got done with it.The only thing about this place that makes it a 4 star place rather than a 5 star place is that the portions are relatively small, and the prices are expensive.  Although kalbi prices here are comparable to other kalbi places in Flushing, a little over $30 per serving is asking for a bit too much.As always with Korean BBQ places, you'll smell like meat and charcoal on your way home.",23,20,20
86,Tiffany H.,"JAMAICA, NY",188,48,101,4.0,5/21/2015,"TIP: you must order 2 portions in order for your meat to be cooked at the table. Otherwise, it will be in their kitchen 40 minute wait on a Thursday night. You KNOW it's good. We saw a lot of non Asians there which meant that they were driven there by the yelp reviews, found that to be pretty cool. We got 2 marinated kalbi (beef ribs/steak) they were a steeping price of $39 each portion. I figured at that price it was enough for 2, however I was informed it was 1 serving per order so we ordered 2. The meat is VERY juicy and tender and thicker compared to other meats I've had. Overall the taste of the meat is Devine and probably some of the best I've ever had. They also have charcoal grills so that makes tender unlike the gas grills that makes the meat hard.Minus 1 star for the steep price. It was good but definitely not $39 worth of beef good. And also because they forgot my extra order or spicy beef soup. The BBQ comes with a free steamed egg tofu and a mini soondubu. Will post pics.",,,

91,Carl C.,"New York, NY",243,244,26,5.0,8/22/2014,"Not many places are worth taking the LIRR, especially just for dinner, but Mapo BBQ is hands down the best Korean BBQ (and food in general) I've had in NYC. Located in the Murray Hill neighborhood in Queens, Mapo BBQ is conveniently located right off its LIRR stop, which is also a little past the last 7 train stop in Flushing.The Galbi is amazing, beautifully marinated and flavorful, and what's really special about this place is the ability to have a charcoal grill and that flavor really shines through. You can easily do one order per person depending on how hungry your party is.The banchan have always been consistently good. There are a lot of options and all are great. Another great thing to order is the beef tartare, which tastes really great with the sweetness and crunch from the Asian pear. As well, the seafood pancake is solid, and the dumplings are huge, plentiful, and quite good.If you order a lot, there is a good chance of getting some free goodies like the amazing charred corn, steamed egg, soft tofu stew, japchae, bibimbap, and/or some booze.",2,1,1

Arrived around 2pm on New Years day and it was crowded. The place could sit maybe 50 people, tops. Luckily we got a table within 15 minutes and it actually fit 6 of us. Each order of their Galbi is $40, but it was well worth it - thick chunks of perfectly marbled and marinated short ribs over charcoal, and the banchan selection was really varied and extensive. On top of the usual they served us a special New Years soup (free of charge) containing very thick cut noodle, vermicelli and beef. Quite tasty.We also ordered the pork belly (don't bother - you'll be disappointed after the Galbi), fried mandoo (very good) and Jap Chae (also very good) The staff is efficient and friendly - one of them kept on talking to us in Korean which was weird as we don't look like.I can understand they might ask for your table when you are done or ask if you still want more meat as the place is packed and people are waiting, but I sensed no rudeness or deceit.The Galbi is awesome and Obi beer was ice cold.",,,

94,Kathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,276,800,2.0,7/2/2015,"Was craving KBBQ after a trip to the Queens Museum. This place had good ratings so we headed on over. I am not happy with the dining experience. Upon arriving, we were seated immediately. It was just the 2 of us, so we wanted to order one order of the KBBQ kalbi. Waitress pressured us to order more bbq dishes because ordering just one would not be worth their time to set up the grill. We were on the spot, and figured we're trying this place out--so why not. There were only 4 meat options.Banchans came out, they were good. The BBQ was good--overall delicious, but I was expecting that considering it was some pretty pricey KBBQ. We paid about $90 for Korean for 2 people in Queens! The place loses all its stars from just the terrible dining experience. First, was the pressure to order more food than we wanted. Second, at the end of the meal I went to use the restroom, which is by the kitchen. I open the door to exit, and right when I step out, I felt the heat from the charcoals as a guy was bringing it out to a table, and he almost walked into me and burned me. He saw the restroom door open, which means someone is about to step out--don't try to walk by with fire! I jumped back to avoid getting burned, and he just looked at me like ""oops"" and continued with his right-of-way. Then third, there was a big table behind us celebrating a birthday. They were all deaf, which was nice to see a group out celebrating like that. The restaurant played the typical korean birthday music and brought out the cake. The other diners were clapping and smiling for the group. And almost immediately--no one even attempted to cut the cake yet, and a waitress comes over to tell them ""there's people waiting for this table."" The group was forced the bill, had to pack up their cake, and leave! Left a terrible taste in my mouth. The KBBQ was good--but not life changing. And it's too easy to find other places that offer good meats, prices, and service. Won't be back to Mapo BBQ.",4,5,

They grill the meat right in front of you, cutting it up into little chunks. Then you wrap the meats on a lettuce leaf which was very fresh. They give you all these little dishes that are toppings for your wrap. I didn't know what half of them were but they were all delicious!

96,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2672,3521,16559,5.0,12/25/2011,"Best kalbi in NYC? Maybe. Best kalbi I've had in Queens? Definitely.Located in one of the most highly concentrated Korean ethnic enclaves outside of Korea, Mapo BBQ is in the heart of it all in Flushing's KTown. Folks can get to Mapo BBQ with a 20 min walk from the end of the 7 line or take the Murray Hill stop just off the LIRR. Places like this cater to the Korean palate and the non-Asian presence is at near zero levels. Don't let that deter you from venturing to this side of town, as I've non-famously coined ""Where there is a craving, there is a way.""Anything less than a couple slabs of kalbi is unacceptable. Just as no one should limit themselves to a salad in a steakhouse, no one should skimp out on the BBQ here. People are here for the kalbi and at $28 a slab, it's no cakewalk. Meat lovers are in for quite the spectacle (yelp.com/biz_photos/I91Z…), the charring of the perfectly marinated meat in all of it's marbled glory, brings out an aroma that fills the entire restaurant despite constant whirl of the ventilation system. Order two slabs for a group of 4 and let the banchan dishes take care of the rest of your appetites. Everything is a feast at Mapo BBQ and they make sure every inch of the table is filled with some kind of dish. Be on the lookout for some of the grilled corn kernals and feel free to add a noodle dish on top of it.Korean food is pricey in general, just make sure you bring enough cash to cover any additional items your group might consider ordering. Most folks either walk or wait forever on their way to hunger, it's best to go big when coming out here. The staff is pretty efficient and can usually make some killer recommendations. On occasion I've found a few waitresses that are able to speak Mandarin and/or English, but Korean rules here. Grab a few of your favorite hanguksarams and make it a point to come out here for a delicious winter worthy meal.",13,10,10
97,Leihay Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,2,1,4.0,3/22/2016,"This is a traditional Korean BBQ place so the only expectation was the quality of meat, which was awesome. I used to go there every 2 weeks because Staffs were great, very friendly. I liked how they particularly grilled the meat longer and cut it in smaller pieces for my kid. Definitely will go back again.",,,
98,Alex H.,"Manhattan, NY",132,60,40,1.0,6/2/2015,"I went to this place because it was on ""My next [Yelp] review awaits."" This is one time the automated suggestions was aware that my attention was required. Good thing I was in the mood for Korean BBQ. The first thing I noticed when I looked at the window, were a lot of colorful advertising outside their window and what was advertised on the posters is also true about their business card which is a self-proclaimed over the top 5 Star rating of themseves. Let me advise you to take that claim with a Big Grain Of Salt.Surprisingly when I got inside, I was the only other party in the restaurant. Seating for the most part is spacious though it is a fairly small restaurant, enough for say about 9 parties of 4 people per group. Once seated, the boss and waitress wanted me and my friend to take the seat by the corner of the cash register which found uncomfortable so the only option they gave us was the corner by the door. We really wanted the opposite corner which they said is only for a party of 4... Later they happily seated a party of two to that table.Though the restaurant was empty at the time, the waitress rushed me to order, the problem was they didn't have my Pork (#3 on the grilled foods page) and she recommended for me to go elsewhere. Consequently I was waiting for my friend and when she came, the waitress told her that we have to order 2 items from the grilled menu page in order to get Banchan which I knew was a scam to get more tips, the waitresses talking about a minimum $76 order whereas they mentioned on the table and menu ""with ANY grilled order."" Any other KBBQ Restaurant I've been to provides Banchan on the house regardless. Of course like suckers, we ordered 2 grilled items and also ordered the Cod Fish Soup and Cold Noodles with Beef and Egg. At this point the waitress who speaks Mandarin told us ""Korean people don't come here much it's the Chinese people who come here because they have money."" I found this to be racist but it was used as reverse logic to ""justify"" how much we ordered but of course she's doing it to justify her tips. ;-) The Black Angus they are proud of was not the quality you'd expect from a KBBQ of this ""supposed"" caliber. As a matter of fact, it was sort of like a Whopper from Burger King except the Whopper does taste better.The Cod Fish Soup gave me a semi upset stomach as the fish was near spoiled and when I say that, I mean it was likely way past due and they probably chilled it in vinegar and salt to preserve it the best they can.One look at the Cold Noodles and I said no thanks. It basically looked like a once tasty noodle soup submerged in slush and the noodles were grey. My friend described it as sour and salty and the beef was hardened like a tough jerky.Perhaps what really turned me off was that we did not get half way through our meal and as soon as they brought the cold noodles, they presented the bill which was $119 before tips for 2 people. Let me say any restaurant in Chinatown/or Flushing that is decent would not only charge only a quarter of that price but you will most likely be satisfied and not be rushed in such an a manner. The sneaky boss even super powers up the AC on our table to try to rush us out. But we inevitably took our time eating.Looks like I won't be going back to this joke they made to themselves. I give them 5 stars for being malicious.",8,2,2
99,Jason C.,"Hightstown, NJ",60,11,22,5.0,9/20/2014,"I will very few times give any restaurant 5 stars but the kalbi but after eating here it's very difficult to eat at other places. I loved going to kalbi buffets but after being spoiled with this i can't go back to another buffet. Starting with the marinade: lightly naturally sweetened, it doesn't leave that coat on your tongue. At least it seems like it's naturaler. It seems like they let it age in the marinade rather than coming out wet. Cooking over wood chips vs. Propane is what separates it from the masses. Their denjangjigae and soondooboo that come out is good. This is one of very few restaurants where spicy raw crab comes out. And well let's just say that's one of my favorites. All in all, parking is alright, not the best location, restaurant isn't to big, gotta get there earlier otherwise it gets packed. At almost $40/serving it's a treat. You usually want to order 2 servings or more person because yes it's that good. I've had LA kalbi in cali and this can definitely compete.",1,,

Otherwise, she said, we should go to the place next door. She killed the whole mood. So we just got up and left to the Korean BBQ place right next door where they treated us well and the food was great.  Recommendation: if you like to be treated badly when you are going to a restaurant, this is the place for you.

This place is soooo extremely tiny. It fits about about 6 tables or so. Literally, it is so small that you should never come in groups. The place is literally a small room totally outdated. There is nothing but tables and chair.3. Side dishes tasted so bad. Korean side dishes are supposed to be fresh. This place tasted like leftover dishes reserved again. Not many good varieties. We were so disappointed.4. They charge you $40 for a very small portion of galbi meat. Come on... side dishes tasted bland and cold. Then, they give you barely any meat to eat. What am i paying for???5. Marinated galbi = not recommended. It is so sweet no flavor. Just plain galbi tasted better because of the charcoal.Pro: it gets 1 extra star because of the charcoal. That is all.We would never go back there again. Waste of money. Not recommended. The servers are old ladies who do not speak english. Make sure you speak korean.",,,
102,Brian M.,"Manhattan, NY",1171,1133,8582,5.0,8/25/2013,"If you're looking for some EXCELLENT Korean Galbi in NYC, this is the place!!! Korean restaurants at in the city is basically UNAUTHENTIC and a watered down and down sized version of Korean food to cater to those amateur diners of Korean cuisine.  Do yourself a favor and make a train ride over to Murray Hill in Queens over to Mapo BBQ for some authentic Korean Galbi that NONE of the Korean restaurants in the city offers.Came here with a group of 6 (I was the ONLY Korean in the group), a mix of White, Black, and other Asian) and ALL of us thoroughly enjoyed the food and we were seated right away since I had a reservation. For some reason, the Yelp Review page and one Yelper mentioned on their review that they don't take reservations but when I called they DID take my reservation for a busy Friday night!! so please keep that in mind. We ordered Galbi, Seafood Pancake, and some Makkeoli (Korean Rice Wine---get this and NOT Soju if you wanna be 'hip' like me, trust me you'll thank me later)Highlights of this place:Atmosphere:-Reminded me of Korean BBQ restaurants in Seoul Korea (don't ask me which Korea you ignorant asshole!!). It was family friendly, not too loud, and homey.Food:-Galbi is thick cut just like in Seoul and they use Charcoal which makes the meat taste SO MUCH better unlike the grills many restaurants use. Meat portions are generous and our side dishes were refilled often and they were all very good and tasted fresh UNLIKE the new and overpriced and stingy portion restaurant GAONNURI located on the 39th floor of K-town. Galbi was definitely thick, juicy, well marinated, and melt in your mouth consistency. Wrap the piece of meat around a lettuce, some purple rice (jabgok bap), ssamjang (Korean BBQ sauce), some jalapeños, some garlic, some side dishes and just stuff everything in one bite into your mouth and please DO NOT take a bite off it and get messy...remember it's NOT a burger and it looks just as stupid as using fork & knives to eat Sushi) You'll begin to experience foodgasm shortly.Sides were varied and even though many (probably non-Koreans) rave about the Grilled Corn side they serve here, I don't want to make a big deal about it cuz it's typical dish that comes out in many Korean restaurants in Korea, it's just good but not like something fabulous or new (well at least NOT for me or other Koreans). Oh yeah they also offered us stews, doejang jjigae or soondubu jjigae. We got two of the prior and they were good.Service:-The servers and ajoomas were pleasant and grilled the meat for us and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the entire meal and we didn't feel rushed (despite the HUGE ASS wait line outside the restaurant)-They let me charge my iPhone during the meal which is an added plusNegatives:-Really nothing.Total bill was around $40/person which is really not bad. For the amount of meat servings we ordered, we would've paid over $60-70 per person if we dined in the city with smaller portions and service would've probably been rushed out. Keun Jip (the Korean restaurant that non Koreans and novice diners are crazy about because they DO NOT know Korean food that well) in K-town as well as other BBQ restaurants on 32nd should really learn a thing or two from Mapo BBQ.It's more like 4.5 stars but then again, their Galbi is the BEST in NEW YORK. Take my advice folks and stop listening to bitchy non-Elite Yelpers that complain about total nonsense and thinking it's pricey when Korean cuisine provides them UNLIMITED amount of sides with Korean ingredidents that are PRICEY and this comes from a Korean Food Expert/Snob and yes I ALWAYS KNOW BETTER",9,2,2
103,Angie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",348,778,123,5.0,1/1/2014,"This is possibly one of the best Korean Galbi I've had so far in my life. I hate to heighten expectations, but I loved the galbi and my experience here the other day.This place looks bigger than it actually is due to the wall-to-wall mirror it has on one side of the establishment. That being said, be prepared to wait at prime dinner times. There is also valet parking available on premises that only requires tip. The meat is grilled at the table over charcoal. The galbi comes more thickly cut than its usually presentation, and this, to me, is the reason why the meat is so delicious. The marinade is great, but the meat itself retains so much flavor and moisture! The side dishes are delicious: I loved the cabbage gut jul-ee, the corn (see other reviews) and the egg souflee. All bottomless, I tell you.My friends and I were there for awhile, but I did not feel rushed at all. In general, Korean restaurants run in a fast-ish pace, but not more than usual here. Also, if you tell them it's their birthday, you get mi yuk gook (traditional birthday seaweed soup) on the house!Just counting down the days until my next trip here.",2,,2

Updated review","After trying out a dozen other Korean BBQ restaurants in nyc, I STILL feel like Mapo BBQ has the best quality meat, no doubt! I recently visited Mapo and discovered that they have introduced a new dish: BBQ beef tongue! It's not as great as their signature dish Marinated Galbi (*you must try this at least once*) but it's worth a try, the portion is good.",,,

Updated review","I'm not one to update reviews, but this place demands it. The mapo kalbi is still tender, but marinade is a tad sweet. Don't think about getting the $16 mandoos, the stews, stone rice pots bi bim bap, or noodle dishes. They don't do these dishes well at all. The sides are a hit or miss, but the best is the corn and egg. My biggest gripe with this place is the owner. They push you to eat as fast as possible and get the hell out of there to turn the tables over. It's annoying to be rushed to eat after ordering $40 entrees and given dirty looks until you pay the check. They are also mad stingy with refilling the sides. Don't even dare ask for seconds or they will probably spit in your food. For a restaurant that only has 1 good dish, they could be smarter in the way they treat repeat customers.",4,,

107,Bobby F.,"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, NY",195,22,45,5.0,12/31/2013,May have just found my new Korean BBQ spot. Great and friendly service. Not rushed like all the other Korean BBQ places. Great food. Marinated Kalbi was delicious. The seafood pancake was crispy and flavorful as well. It was difficult to find parking around the area but their score shouldn't be penalized by it.,2,,
108,Ivan M.,"Seattle, WA",543,332,414,4.0,10/23/2013,"this place would never exist in seattle. why? because it's a flippin' death trap! all the tables had grills, not gas, charcoal but not all the tables had vents over head. sprinkler system? what the f*ck is that? this is supposed to be a chronic kbbq, potential fiery death is worth it. this place was jumpin' on a saturday night. line was out the flippin' door. i never been to a place that had actual charcoal grils indoors before so i was excited. once the meat came and the server plopped it onto the fire it was on like donkey kong, to hell with my clothes smellin' nice (i said good bye to my clothes smellin' nice as soon as they suggested kbbq :sad panda:) and get that banchan out the d*mn way. haha. banchan was pretty good, tho. i ordered short rib (marinated as suggested by the server lady), pork shoulder (samgyeopssal doesn't work on the grill), and a yellow fish (laden with roe). the short ribs came first and the well marbled meat meant the fat rendering into the charcoal pit of glory was going to infuse the cooking meat with a smokey aroma of it's own burning fat...i imagine that's what heaven will smell like (side note, hell will probably smell similar but it will be my own burning fat...so it's kind of a win win for me). the server came by periodically to flip our meat and cut our meat on the grill all while tending to the other grills in her area and not refilling our waters. it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just as you should eat it. pork was good too. it was super tender and the marinade kept it juicy, not too dry. i still would have preferred the pork belly but it was not to be with the charcoal grill. fish could have been grilled another minute or so  because the middle was ever so slightly underdone. understandable since it was rather thick for this kind of fish. wasn't too salty and the flesh was flakey and white. the roe sack was enormous and i didn't want to share it. our meal had a couple soups and the steamed egg with it too. i think the soups could have been spicier but my uncle and dad thought they were just fine (wimps, jk!!! thanks for dinner dad!) the steamed egg was just that, steamed egg. i love steamed egg. even more so when it's included with the meal.",1,4,1
109,Andrew S.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",18,59,18,1.0,5/7/2015,"OVER PRICED! They jacked up the rib (kalbi) price to $39 per person. ($8 increase per serving in merely year) We had 4 rib, 3 soju, 2 beer and 1 cold noodle. all came out to be $245. With 15% tip of hefty $37 tip you should be ready to spend around $70 per person. Are you kidding me? Was $39 Kalbi worth it? Hell no. I know kalbi is good here but so are many other joints. At better price.I suggest any other Korean BBQ franchise such as Kang Ho Dong Baek Jeong, Mapo Galmaegi or Jongro BBQ for better priced, better quality meat.",2,1,
110,S H.,"New York, NY",288,35,5,5.0,11/5/2017,"I don't understand how this rating isn't a full 4 or higher. What?! This place is amazing. Manhattan Korea town tastes like shit. But this restaurant...man. I could eat here every single day. Their side dishes are amazing and so diverse and so fresh. The ladies are great. The Mapo galbi is everything. If you all have never had quality Korean BBQ, then you don't understand that this is the price you pay for good quality bbq. They get their meat specially and I can definitely tell the quality is amazing. This is the first Korean restaurant ever that I actually was too full off of the side dishes that I always end up taking leftover BBQ home. No Korean restaurant has ever made me love them for their sides. This place is as authentic as you can get. And they grill purely on charcoal ?! Amazing. Just. Everything. Is amazing. LOVE. Coming from a girl that knows her food, especially Korean food, this place is my top 1 favorite Korean restaurant in all of NYC and quite possibly the east coast.",,,
111,Alan Z.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",40,95,61,3.0,10/2/2015,"Man, what happened to this place? I've always enjoyed coming here for great BBQ for years, but after today I'll think twice before coming here again. They jacked up their price!!! $38 for kalbi per person? What do you get for $38? 11 bite size beef cubes!!  Yes sir...count them...11. And they are 1/2 size of your chicken nuggets. See my attached picture. The 11 beef cubes are so small, they decorate the plate with 2 pieces of grilled bones to fill the plate. Wtf!! The waitress was so pushy for 2 people to order 2 beef. We told her we want seafood pancake and other food, and she kept on insisting for us to place 2 orders otherwise we will not be grilling on the table. We stuck to our guns. The tofu soup was $14 and the seafood pancake was $19. The check came out to $79 for 2 people without tip. This dinner cost me a small fortune!",,,
112,Tim L.,"Huntington Station, NY",44,24,2,1.0,2/23/2015,"The only reason I even found out about this place was that Han Joo Chik was temporarily closed. However, seeing all the crazy signs on the outside and even seeing all these 4-5 stars on Yelp, pushed me to just choose this place for dinner with friends...(it was also snowing like crazy and we probably did not want to go searching for another restaurant anyway)After walking out of the restaurant, I cannot believe the amount of 4-5 stars I am seeing for the reviews for this place. This place is just terrible. Flat-out horrendous.The prices suck.The side dishes suck.The pancakes suck.The stews...yes, you guessed it..suck.The galbi is mediocre at best.And the service? Yeah, it also sucks pretty badly. The worst.You'll probably have waitresses egging you on to order the galbi (which happens to be the most expensive option on the menu) and whine about people ordering the pork. All this complaining about how they must cook it separately and have to bring a different grill for it. Wahhh, call the wah-ambulance please. If there are two grills, then I'm sure we wouldn't mind having a mix of beef and pork. And the prices. $40 dollars for a serving of galbi? I'm sure a two-year old will have a feast with these portions. There are definitely cheaper options out in Flushing. Come on, it's Flushing.Anyways, 4-5 stars? It's crazy how they're still in business. I mean, it can just turn out to be that maybe I'm a lunatic and my mom just cooks better than any of these restaurants in this side of town, and my mom just doesn't realize how talented she really is. Who knows?To show I'm not a cynical, judgmental, and terrible person, I will say that the corn side dish was decent.Oh, and for the Koreans, the kimchi sucks. That really says a lot. Why trust this review? I'm Korean. Stereotypical enough?",4,2,

Maybe we didn't get it bc we order 1 not two...but the table next to us ordered the same thing, was korean and got the soup and corn and started whispering how we didn't get it. Which reminded me. ...corn was missing too! won't come back here any time soon.  I hope them saving that soup and corn for the other Koreans were worth losing some customers.  So many other bbq spots in the area now that I can choose from.",3,,

Was immediately seated and the waitress came quickly to take our orders. I thought service was great. Until they started pressuring us to hurry up to eat for next reservations. If I'm paying 38.99 per serving of mediocre meat, I'd like to at least eat in peace without constantly being rushed. Before my friend even finished his meal they brought out the check. A word on the food. Folks this is highly over rated particularly given the price tag. There are multitudes of other restaurants that offer same if not better quality food for less price and better service.The point: skip this place. It's all but hype and terrible service at a high price tag. Total bill $160 for 3 people, total time: 48 minutes. Do the math.",2,,

116,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",961,975,2708,4.0,8/16/2013,"I've been here 6-7 times and it's always consistently good. You should really only come for the Mapo Kalbi, it's a min of two orders and it's not the biggest short rib dish but two orders is a good size for three people especially since the banchan(the small dishes that is given in every Korean BBQ place) is so plentiful. It's kinda on the pricey side but it is the best Kalbi. I think I heard rumors of new ownership so the review maybe a little dated.The food-Mapo Kalbi- They drop the marinated slab on the grill whole and it cooks for a few minutes. Once it sears on the outside, they start to cut it into bite size pieces and they ask how you want to the beef to be cooked. I ask for medium especially since the meat will sit on the side of the grill and will continue to heat through while your eating. The marinated beef almost doesn't really need anything but I like the beef with the onion in soy that everyone gets, Doenjang(fermented bean paste), some garlic and rice. You could do the lettuce wrap but I don't. They also use a charcoal grill rather than gas which is a plus.Tofu jjigae- I was surprised how much I liked this dish. It's a Korean spicy tofu soup, it has great flavor and there is a ton of stuff inside from pork belly, to tofu, to cabbage to noodles. It is filling so beware, you are here for Kalbi.Mandoo- it is a standard mandoo dish, nothing crazy. It's good for what it is but pricey, I would skip it.The roasted corn in the skillet is excellent , if they don't give it to you already, ask for the the garlic in sesame oil. It's raw garlic in a little aluminum cup with sesame oil that they cook on the grill with the Kalbi, it's fantastico!Also, the service has been excellent every time I have gone. The waitresses are super friendly and super attentive to the grill.",1,,1

First off, they spilled tea on my sister. Then they kept insisting that we order 5 kalbi even though we're not big meat eaters even though we were ordering other dishes (ie jap chai, kimichi jigae, kalbi tang and bi bim bap).  We're used to the fast turnarounds at Asian places but not this fast!!! We weren't even halfway done with our food and the waitress gave us our check! So i ignored it because we weren't done. And 5 mins later she came over and said there's a group of people waiting for our table. HOW RUDE! I never got this at any chinese places!! So pissed off. Would NOT be going back!! The kalbi was one of the best in town, but totally not worth going if the service sucks!Btw..don't order the seafood pancake because it's a rip off! There were barely any seafood in there!!",3,,

Even though I never tried the galbi in the actual region, I could imagine it's quite similar to the ones that I've had here. Delicious. Side dishes were great, the Naeng myun was pretty good, bu the galbi..was phenomenal. Great marblings all around and even though they were thick cut, it melted like butter in my mouth.

Got there around 9PM and the wait wasn't terrible. There was a table finishing up and it didn't seem as if anyone was rushing them out (probably because they didn't have a huge crowd waiting) and during our dinner, I definitely didn't feel rushed, unlike other Korean BBQ establishments I've been to. Not sure if it was just because they didn't have anyone waiting but customer service here is pretty good. The ladies and bus boys were very nice and conversational. While it was pretty cold that night, I was disappointed that the tea served wasn't cold. But the food made up for that.For 5 people, the lady (who also kind of speaks mandarin) recommended we get 4 orders of the marinated kalbi. We also ordered the seafood pancake and jap chae.The marinated kalbi was delicious! The meat is so tender and definitely the thickest I've ever seen in a KBBQ restaurant. ~$33 (don't remember exactly) for one order. The seafood pancake was also really good.. I didn't find it any better than other great kbbq places but that is not to say it wasn't delish. The japchae was ordinary.

We ordered 2 different type of meat because it was required by many Korean BBQ around here. Definitely do not like that rule.If you going to tell me to order 2 meat off the menu, at least let me cook them on the table because that's what the grill is for....I was told that one has to be cook from the kitchen and only one is allowed to cook on the grill. I came to Korean BBQ for the actually BBQ experience, not let some dude cook it for me in the kitchen...So we opt out to leave and go to a different restaurant then they decided to let us cook it on the table. I understand if it was busy and there were people waiting, but from beginning to the end of my meal, the restaurant remained fairly empty.

My family has known the owner for years, so we are always treated well, but regardless of that fact, since it's such a small space, the turnover for customers is rather quick. On busy nights, you'll be handed the check a bit early so they can get you moving. It's not the worst thing since there are several bakeries and coffee shops in the area for you and your party to sit and chat in. The food is spectacular. There are so many restaurants that manage to mess up such a basic concept of side dishes and marinated beef but Mapo always delivers. The beef is thick cut, tender and juicy 100/100 of the time. Their selection of side dishes beats out most restaurants so that's also a nice plus. If you're a fan of noodles (or even if you aren't) their buckwheat noodles (mool naengmyun) is something special. I don't know what it is but I always need to order it. Go! You won't regret it!

Being someone who grew up on Korean food, I assure you the food is exceptionally delicious. In fact, all of my Korean friends LOVE this place!  However, the only ones who seem to have any issues are non-Koreans or people who aren't knowledgeable enough to know what excellent Korean food tastes like, clouded by their experiences at mediocre establishments in K-Town.  Finally, don't complain about the prices here -- It's not cheap, but it's not as expensive as most places in K-Town.  Just shut-up and open your wallet with a smile and be thankful that you just paid for a quality meal.As for the food, many other people here have provided lots of details on the various dishes served.  You can't go wrong with whatever you order, but it would be sad if you didn't try a BBQ dish since that is what they're known for (note that each table is fitted with a charcoal grill, which undoubtedly enhances the flavor of whatever is being cooked).",10,5,8

Just thinking about it makes me drool.  This place is great and considered to be one of the best spots in NY for kalbi. I will not argue that as it is one of my top 3 choices for kalbi dining. When compared to other Korean bbq joint, it boils down to the quality of the meat. Nice thick cuts of Grade A short ribs, lightly marinated to bring out the beefy flavor. Grilled over glowing wood coal chips which gives a nice smoky taste to the beef. Definitely beats the regular fire... (Since not too many spots have wood coal as it is more expensive) Typical offering of banchan gracefully laid out on your table - kimchi, potato salad, sautéed eggplant, crystal noodles, grilled corn platter, and steamed eggs just to name a few. Also can forget about the lettuce on the side with a dish of onions soaked in light sweet soy sauce to combine with your grilled kalbi. We accompanied the food with cold shots of soju and beer....it's good I tell ya..Aside from the food, service was alright..waitress grilled the kalbi for us. Felt a little rushed towards the end as we received our bill and complimentary oranges before requesting for it. Busboy instantly came to our table once we got up. Parking can be tough at times but they have Valet. Luckily for us there was no wait, but usually the line is out the door. Place can fit about 40-50 people comfortably.

They try hard to persuade you to order galbi, which is the most expensive item ($38.95/one order) on the menu and the minimum order is for 2 orders if you want to bbq on the table. The portion size is so small. I think they give only 100-150 gram per order. They bring the two bones per one order with meat and take the bones back to the kitchen. It looks like they weigh the bones together with meat to make it look the portion bigger. Once you place an order, you can expect your bill to come half way of your meal even though you did not request it. This is a small restaurant and the owner want more turnover. The owner does not care about customers' experience or customers' enjoying food. She is only interested in making money. She has no pride in her food. If you complain about the food, she will say right away her restaurant was on the The New York Times.

Updated review","After my first time here, I longed for an occasion to go back. When my Korean food aficionado/withering Yelper friend visited New York this past weekend, it was a foregone conclusion that I would bring him to Mapo, come hell or high water.There's no doubt that the fact that ***YELP'S INCORRECT MAP*** trapped us into walking over a mile (no exaggeration, and no cabs in sight) in Saturday's wind and rain from the 7's dreadful Flushing-Main Street stop  contributed to the negativity of the overall experience. But it's the contrast of the food and service with my last visit that leads me to temper my original evaluation with an update.I even recognized some of the ladies who sat us down, which makes it even weirder that everything went wrong. They were nice enough, especially since I was scrutinizing them for any hint of the ""oh, it's an Asian girl with a white man, and therefore we can pass judgement"" attitude.I was surprised anew when they informed us that we had to buy TWO meat orders ($25-$30 each) in order to get the real coal at our table. I was also re-shocked when they said that certain cuts of pork couldn't be ordered with beef because the pork fat would cause an inferno over coals. Humbly, I remembered that these were not arbitrations, but rules I'd learned the last time. But then, the side dishes came out  in strange intervals with no rhyme or reason. A short-ended (in my opinion) slab of raw, cold beef preceded half the items, and faced off with us while we chewed on raw garlic cloves, vinegared onions, five different types of similar tasting kimchee, and lettuce. Finally, I if rice was included just as the hot coals were placed in the center of the table.""Yes, of course. Why, did you want it now?"" The woman asked in Korean. It's like no, I want it  next year...Jesus. The thought on my mind at the moment was just that I had wanted to know if it would arrive eventually. A woman came up and diligently cut both meats into tiny bite-sized bits, which I appreciated. Both preferring our meat rarer than not, we quickly rescued them from the astounding heat of the coals. Another woman came to sweep them back into the center, and I had to explain to her that it had been no accident that we'd neatly taken all the meat off the heat.At this point, my friend really sacked up and asked in perfectly comprehensible KOREAN whether he could please have a glass of water. ""EH?"" The woman shouted, but not in an intentionally mean way. When she realized what he'd said, she cackled, and said ""Why yesss, yesssss, I will get you some niiiice, cooool, water,"" in Korean while my face probably turned purple for my friend's sake.at this point, I asked when we were going to get our denjang jjigeh. She said, ""Well, of course, if you would like jjigae, then we will add it as a service."" Service my pale white ass - it is a part of the meal!Foodwise:*Meat was great quality, but the marinade was sweeter than I remembered, rendering the prime grade stuff cheaper than it really is. The proportions were smaller, too; maybe they adjusted it because there were only two of us, but we both happened to want to bust a gut.*Gerran jjim (egg casserole) was suitably hot, but a bit on the salty side.*The baked corn was again a highlight of the ensemble.*Jiggae was watery; more like miso soup with some zucchini and onion falling apart in it. Still a relief from the rainy weather, though.After I flagged them down to remind them that we were ACHING to pay them, we got some orange slices and a bill, which I told them to split 50/50 on our cards. More like 100/100, because they charged us twice, and the wrong amount at that. So then I had to get REALLY native and go up to the table and get a cash settlement after which I did not leave any tip.It's clear to me now that this place has very on and very off days, but it's hard to want to roll the dice when it's in bumfuck Queens, confirmed as accessible only by the LIRR (unless you prefer to walk over a mile each way from the 7).  Maybe I should get over my aversion to Manhattan's Koreatown and see what's there after all. It can't be more unpredictable than Mapo, and I can't take risks anymore when I'm trying to feed my best friends.",7,3,6
160,Philippe B.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",82,281,835,4.0,3/26/2014,"Very good Korean BBQ in an area where great Korean BBQ is standard.Food: 3.75 StarsDespite the limited choice of meats to grill, it is still a hearty and filling meal. The meat was fresh as well as the banchan.We were served a wide variety of banchan many of which come standard at all Korean BBQ's and others like the squid which was a delicious surprise.The all-star of the dishes had to be the seafood pancakes. It was the best seafood pancake I have ever eaten. Even after it became cold it was still delicious!My only disappointment was the fact that we couldn't cook the pork belly at the table, so we didn't order it.Drinks: N/AOnly had tea, but the overall selection of drinks looks appealing.Service: 2 to 4.5 Stars*We were a group of 7 that arrived early and seating at a table normally meant for 10 and I certainly felt the awkwardness that came with it. The servers seemed to want us out quickly so they could open up the table when the dinner rush arrived. We ate pretty quickly anyway, but it still felt that we weren't moving fast enough for them. I don't blame them for wanting the table(s). I personally believe that Korean BBQ is better with groups of 3 to 5 because there is less of an overabundance of banchan which will likely go to waste and 5 people can easily fit on a table of 4. On a good note the actual service was terrific. The servers helped prepare and cook the meat at the table and gave us extra banchans. They were also very quick to refill our lettuce which was eaten very quickly.With a smaller (3-5 people) group I can easily give the service 4 to 4.5 stars, but with my larger group we didn't mesh well together.Ambiance: 3.25 StarsMapo is more spacious than most Korean BBQ restaurants I have been to. It doesn't have the same feel as other Korean BBQ's as well. The lack of vents over every table gives more space, but I get a feeling that the place becomes very smokey if many grills are in use at the same time. Regular menu items seems to be the main focus of Mapo with grilling being a novelty item.Overall: 3.25 to 3.75 Stars*The banchans and the meats were delicious and the servers were more than helpful with the menu selections.The only flaw in regards to the menu is the limited selection of meats (3) and 2 of which are the same except one is marinated.I do wish they gave us more control of the grill and what we could put on it (onions garlic, jalapenos), but it seems that they were in a real rush that day and didn't want us hogging 2 tables meant to old 10 people instead of 7.Note: I plan to eat here again in the future with a smaller and more manageable group.",,1,
161,Sonia C.,"FLUSHING, NY",31,23,0,1.0,9/13/2013,"What can I say...I came in for a late lunch midweek and we were the only customers there. When we ordered two lunch specials they were reluctant to give it to us. After our server eyed another server she then told us that we could still have the lunch special as if she was doing us a huge favor. Banchan took a long time to come out considering that we were the only customers there. Water was not refilled and like what a previous reviewer said it was as if we were invisible.Yes the food is good. I wouldn't say that it's the best kalbi in Queens but other yelpers appear to think so. But for me personally the quality of the food could not make up for the poor service and attitude. So no, I won't be returning here. I'll just go around the corner to Hahm Ji Bach where the servers are attentive and treat their customers like customers.",2,,

I would agree. Mapo doesn't serve galbi the way most other Korean restaurants do. You would find a roll of meat usually still attached to the rib. But in Mapo you get a big thick cut slab of meat. To be totally honest i was kinda taken aback at how small the portion looked but once we started eating it became clear that it wasn't small at all. We left feeling very full and very satisfied. Everything was really great and you get all of the side dishes (banchan) that one is accustom to when ordering korean BBQ.,13,7,11

My family loves having conversations with them.My father is a chef, so we have a thing for critique and whatnot, and the both of us can agree that their food is awesome!

It's not fully filled with seafood, as it would make it soggy after being cooked, but the most important part was that it wasn't oily and was crispy.It's a high-standard restaurant if you're bringing some friends around, but be prepared to come in with your stomach empty, because what you order will fill you up!",,,

While I find that statement to be highly subjective, I'll say this: Mapo is traditional Korean food at its best. You're not going to find outrageously bold flavors, the beef will not be overly sweet as most modern Korean BBQ places are, and you're not going to wonder ""how did they do that?"" unless you are a Korean food newbie, to which I say, welcome to the clan. The food here is simple, clean and deliciously uncomplicated. The BBQ is thicker cut than most other places, and with 2+ orders, you'll get your standard lettuce baskets, onions marinated in a touch of soy and vinegar, plus steamed eggs in stone bowls, tofu stew and roasted corn. All of the banchan (side dishes) were excellent, as I probably ate a whole dish of kimchi with rice by myself, and my dad started scooping the chilled radish soup by the ladle directly into his mouth. It's humble, hearty yet light, and the kind of stuff that your Korean grandma would make, bless her soul.",1,,
169,D C.,"New York, NY",9,64,1348,5.0,4/5/2015,"Great food and great service. The wait was a little annoying, but the food was worth the wait. One of the better Kalbi meats I've had in NYC. They were also very generous with the side dishes. Most importantly they use charcoal and this is the only restaurant that I know who uses it. Enjoy!",1,,
170,Danielle C.,"Santa Clara, CA",569,2616,816,4.0,1/4/2012,"The waitresses speak Korean AND Mandarin Chinese here!  I noticed that the second a party walks in, they can usually tell if the party is Korean, Chinese, or neither, and use the appropriate greeting.  How quaint!The barley tea was excellent, although a little lukewarm on our first batch.  Anyway, there is very good Korean food to be had here, and the wait staff are pretty nice.  I was having discussions with the waitress (in Chinese) what she recommends.  We ended up getting some kalbi, some squid noodle dish, dolsot bi bim bap, and jap chae (clear noodles).  Each dish's portion isn't terribly large - I could easily finish an order of jap chae no problem, and I do not eat a lot in general - so if you're coming with lots of people, definitely order up.The kalbi was seasoned very well - it cooked just right over the charcoal grill, but be careful of the flying sparks and the smoke.  The side dishes were okay - I was hoping for tofu because I could eat that stuff all day, but the kimchi and the pasta salad were pretty decent.  The dolsot bi bim bap wasn't as burnt as I wanted it to be -- I could tell just by stirring the rice, and it was rather moist, but that's ok.  The kalbi more than made up for it.  I did not try the squid and noodle dish because I don't eat squid - the noodles looked like thick udon noodles, and everything was drenched in this spicy hot red sauce.  Yum!They gave us a lot of things on the house - like this yummy corn and cheese dish, and some spicy tofu soup, and some oranges for dessert.What nice service.  Great food.  Also it's right off the Long Island Rail Road Murray Hill stop, so for those without a car, you have no excuses now!",,,

174,Sean B.,"Oakland, CA",118,1051,57,2.0,4/18/2011,"Want overpriced, average Korean bbq? Visit Mapo BBQ! Want memorably bad service? Mapo will hook you up. The meat here is very, very average. The kalbi marinate is really basic. I mean my dad (as white as one can get) made the same type of marinate on a weekly basis. Want to duplicate the kalbi here for a lot, LOT cheaper?  Buy flank steak, put it in a pan. Mix up some soy, a little sugar, and garlic, dump it on the steak, let it sit for 24 hours. Next day cook that shit on the grill and you're good. That's Mapo's beef kalbi. We also got one of the two pork dishes (the $25 one since the $20 one was sold out of course).  It actually was pretty good and if I were to go back (although who the hell knows why I would), I would stick with that and avoid the kalbi.How was the service bad?1. We had to remind them to bring us rice.  While we were grilling our meat, my friend asked for some rice. The waitress: ""Oh, you want it now?"" No ma'am, we want it for dessert. 2. Even though every other table had dwaejung jiggae on the side, we didn't until my friend asked for it. 3. It took forever to get the check.4. We asked them to split the check on our two cards. They charged us each the full check instead of half each. Apparently they don't know how to credit credit cards here so they ended up giving us the difference in cash. And just to make it clear, I am not one who normally complains and whines like a baby about the service at a restaurant. This place deserves mention though in its craptastic waitstaff. I've been around a ton of ajummas in my day and I have to say Mapo wins the prize in having the cream of the crop.  Honestly, the food is average here. If not for the prices and that poor service, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars.",2,1,

We were rushed to finish eating and felt very uncomfortable throughout our entire meal. The owner and a few servers were staring at us, sending dirty looks our way because we wanted refills of the side dishes.

We ordered mapo galbi @ 39.00 per person. Insanity. If it weren't for the subzero wind chill I would have up and left mid-meal. Also, the server pushes the mapo galbi on you-- I wanted brisket, but she cringed as if I ordered monkey paws, saying mapo galbi is the one decent thing at the store. Skip this one, or graduate summa cum laude from the school of hard knocks as I did tonight. 0 stars for service, value, ambiance. 1 star for the tasty, overpriced meat.",2,,

But when we asked for a little she gave us so much attitude. This place is known in the korean community to have awful service but wow this was unbelievable. The food is not even that great, it's just your standard korean bbq. Just look at how low the reviews by the korean people are. Do yourself a favor and go to well garden next door.

The staff is pretty friendly and the short rib is almost like a really tender steak.  It is probably the best galbi I've had in NYC. All the side dishes were great too and they gave us a free order of short rib dumplings since we came all the way from Manhattan/NJ for it.If you are going to use Google maps to find this place, it might take you to the wrong place.  Just know that this place is right outside the Murray Hill LIRR station.",,,

We were barely halfway through our drinks and were actually spooning food in our mouth when the first server puts the check on our table. We were 3/4 done with our drinks and again, we were in the act of putting food in our mouths which is an obvious indicator that we were NOT done when the second server reaches into our table and grabs two dishes to clear them. She feigned ignorance when we said we were eating (we have our utensils in our hands). We are not slow eaters by any means but they are basically expecting us to be in the door and out under 30 minutes...Finally yet another server comes by and this time its not a hint... she tells us point blank to leave there are people behind us. Im not sure what she was expecting?  That'd we would pack the rest of our expensive bbq to go and you know, down the rest of our soju on the street? It was horrifying to say the least... we understand the restaurant is popular but how can they chase people out the door?

There were many positive reviews which motivated me to go this place. It was not a fancy place but humble. When we went there  for dinner, there were some other people but the place was not  filled.We ordered Cod and pollock in a moderately hot spicy broth. They both come in a hot stone pot. The fish was cooked with Daikon radish, onion , scallion and other vegetables. The fish was fresh and broth was rich and nourishing. The hot stone pot keeps the food hot and warm throughout the meal.  Their Ban Chan was OK. There were few steamed and seasoned green vegetables, small potato ,fish cake, a little bitter root vegetable  and kimchi. I liked the seasoned potato. Their Banchan was not too hot spicy , which made my stomach comfortable. By the time when we  were finished, we were totally full.",,,
186,Taiko M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,18,0,2.0,11/10/2014,"Don't be deceived by the 4 to 5 star reviews on yelp and its proud advertisement on the window. If you go all the way to Murray Hill near Mapo, just take extra 10 steps to go to the next door, Han Joo Korean BBQ. Since Han Joo was so good, we went back to go to Han Joo within a month, and for some reason, we were so damb to think, ""Oh, this Mapo place also gets a great review. Maybe it could be even better than Han Joo!"" and went into Mapo. The result is, total disaster. Massive regret. Deep depression. We should not have cheated Han Joo. Meat at Mapo is cut so big, and the fire is too strong, that the outside of beef pieces are all so tough and over cooked, while inside is totally raw. None of our kids (2/5/6 yr old) ate the meat, as they were too tough. Side dishes are boring, nothing unique, nothing that tasty. But the most annoying thing is, their bibimbap deos not have meat on it! Is it even allowed to do that at a Korean BBQ place??? It's not even they offer a meat option and a vegetarian option. For non spicy regular bibimbap, there is only one option and it comes without any meat on it. Seriously, what are you thinking? If it is tasty without meat, I would have thought it would be good for my health or something, but it was not yummy either. So sad. To say the least, we all felt very deceived after going to Mapo and just swore to ourselves, that next time and forever, we would just go to Han Joo. This place is on my never list.",3,,
187,Laura C.,"ELMHURST, NY",31,34,153,2.0,4/30/2016,"This is normally our go to place for Korean BBQ but Thursday marks our last visit. We have a group of regular dishes we order because they are good like the squid and spicy noodles, seafood pancake, marinated beef ribs and dumplings. We have always been skeptical that when we order the ribs we are actually getting the correct portion. Mind you an order of the marinated beef ribs is just under $40. So when you order two orders and really the amount looks relatively the same you have doubts. This past Thursday there were two Korean ladies at the table next to us and they had ordered two orders of the ribs and it looked like a nice large order beautiful color too nice and pink red. We ordered 3 orders and when it arrived it looked like the same portion of the 2 orders and the color was grey. We have always had this slight urking feeling that somehow they were getting over on us and Thursday night sealed the deal. As much as we actually like the food the disingenuous behavior and not to mention the slight rudeness of the waitresses when I questioned her sealed Mapos fate. We will take our business elsewhere thank you. We felt the we were getting fleeced and because we were not Korean we definitely weren't getting the same treatment. Mind you all four of us have travelled extensively in Asia including Korea and three of us have lived and worked in Asia for several years so we know the cultures how they vary from country to country and how to be respectful. So the two stars is because their food is not bad but zero stars for deceptive actions.",,,

My friend highly recommended it to me, so I went and first had to wait 30 min for a table (which I normally wouldnt mind if its worth it) and was greeted with the rudest waitress ever. The waitress was absolutely rude and the biggest B***** ever. She literally took our order with an attitude and didnt check back in with us again. We couldnt even get refill on our tea or water. She gave us an attitude from the get go and was just miserable. We ordered Nang myun which is cold noodle and is usually served with mustard and vinegar. She dropped off the noodles without the necessary condiments and seriously gave us an attitude when we asked for it!We got 2 orders of kalbi, one pork belly, nang myun and seafood pancake. Total was $150, pretty expensive for what it was. Food was good but not good enough for me to go back and deal with rude service. We always went to the place next door which we love, but took a recommendation from a friend to try Mapo. We will never go back there. Not worth it!",3,,

Updated review","I had dinner with a friend here recently, and I am so, SO disappointed. We were originally supposed to go to my beloved Hamh Ji Bach, but I suggested she try something new and recommended Mapo BBQ. I really regret that suggestion. First of all, they took forever to give us our banchan. Meanwhile, the two Korean customers sitting nearby (who came in after us, btw) got it before us  -_-Second, they gave my friend a dish that was different from what she originally ordered. We told them it was the wrong order, and so they took it back. After they gave us our food, it was as if we didn't exist. We needed more water and napkins, and it took forever to draw someone's attention. One of the waitresses actually saw me trying to call someone over; our eyes met, and she just ignored me. Really?! That was pretty offensive. Whatever happened to the good service nice people who worked here? The food: my friend ordered a noodle dish (I forgot the name), and I had the soondubu jiggae. My soup tasted good; I wish it had more soup/broth, though. The banchan was okay, but definitely not as good as the banchan at Hamh Ji Bach. This place is supposed to be the venue for a BBQ I planned with my friends next week, but I think that is no longer the case.",7,3,3
192,Yiquan L.,"JAMAICA, NY",138,81,54,4.0,4/25/2015,I've been here multiple times with my family. The service is great. The food was also on point. For korean BBQ we got the pork belly and kalbi beef. We mostly got dishes on the side. Their Japchae is really good and their seafood pancake. The waiters also speak Chinese so they were able to explain to my parents what each dish is. That was helpful. I enjoy going to this place a lot. I recommend it!,,,
193,lesley l.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",80,144,1694,2.0,1/4/2015,"disappointed. first, i will say that the kabi is delicious.. well it better be. $38.95 for one order... not cheap. i've been to many korean restaurants over the years.. and this is probably one of the more expensive places (expensive for dumpy/casual ambience at least). but the service.. horrendous. i wish i read all the reviews before i came bc they rush you and not even subtly. a party of 5 sat at the table next to ours and the owner squeezed them into a table for 4... which was attached to our table. After squeezing them in, the owner literally walks over to us and had her two index fingers over my husbands head SCREAMING -- DONT WORRY THEY ARE LEAVING NOW DONT WORRY! yes we were almost done with our meal but damn that was rude. felt so super rushed after that and will not be coming back.",1,,

197,Andres K.,"Flushing, NY",21,29,3,4.0,5/31/2015,"Ive been a faithful customer for more than 5 years and was touting the restuarant as the number one korean short ribs restuarant in NY long before they faced their plight of fame and glory. Im not sure if there was a change in ownership more recently, but the steep increase in price (from a while back before they renovated) has me rethinking my usual frequent visits to this place. A large reason for the flavor of the meat (in my opinion) is the smoky flavor infused by the grill. You really do not get the same taste if you get the meat cooked in the kitchen. However at a steeping 38 dollars per serving, you'd be dishing out a whopping 76 dollars for two servings to get the meat cooked in front of you. Do not get me wrong, there is a reason people of all races (hipsters included) flock to this restuarant for their korean bbq cravings. The meat is devine but the price you pay has given the restuarant a reputation of those ""special occasion"" restaurants and less of the friday night dinner spot with friends;unless of course you're rolling in moneyBring back the old prices!",,,

No room for Reservations, Just come in and be prepared to wait 10 to 20 minutes if all tables are taken even though the Hostess will probably tell you it will take you only 5 minutes to be seated.Prices were a bit pricey for the typical texan to me but very similar to the Korean Restaurants in Manhattan around 132nd. I loved my Creamy corn and Fish cakes. Meat was of good Quality for the Kalbi Beef i selected. Seafood Pancake was decent too. Our Server was very friendly and surprised at how much i knew about Korean Food. Overall Experience was lovely and we were very full at the end of the evening.",,,1
