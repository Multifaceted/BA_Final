0,Aileen C.,"Manhattan, NY",469,47,61,4.0,11/16/2018,"I love high tea, especially when there's a groupon for it! The high tea here was great-- unlimited tea, huge portion sizes, and lots of great food options.Food: My friend and I got the Mad Hatter, which is 2 unlimited tea, 2 sandwiches (6 pieces each), 3 huge scones, and a huge slice of cake that comes with a side of cookies. I had the early grey tea, which was a nice twist because they added white tea and rose to it. If you like something classic and safe, go for this; next time I definitely want to try a new tea. We got the curry chicken salad and smoke salmon sandwiches (3 slices each), which had generous size and ingredients. Definitely get the curry sandwich-- it was amazing! While the smoked salmon was a classic, the curry one blew it out of the water. Next came the scones, which were definitely the highlight of the afternoon. Definitely get the mixed berry one! The glazed pumpkin was good as well, and the chocolate chip was pretty average. Though the sandwiches and scones were great, I was not a fan of the mocha cake as I found it to be too sweet. Definitely still worth though as there are more options for next time! Atmosphere: Cute, but a little more crowded than I'd like it to be. Heads up, we had to wait about 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon. I noticed lots of people knocking into my friend's chair because of the tight space as well.Service: Decent service, very nice waiters/waitresses, which can be difficult to find in new york city sometimes.Tl;dr- Get the groupon- its about $40 for 2 people and it's so worth it! Curry chicken sandwich and the mixed berry scone are the best! And come hungry, as the portions are huge. Will be coming back again!!",,,
1,Debra P.,"New York, NY",41,38,0,3.0,11/18/2018,Go for the experience and plan to spend a lot of money. The scones with jam and cream were good.The cake we got was ok. We ended up with way too much tea. I recommend you start with one pot of tea for the table and order more as needed. Service is very slow and always a wait. Plan to make an afternoon of it.,,,

3,Cheryl N.,"Manhattan, NY",165,292,1038,3.0,11/8/2018,"I have been to Chapter II and the recently closed Chapter III before and loved them both, so I came in with high expectations for Alice's Tea Cup Chapter 1 (A.K.A. Alice's Tea Cup Cup OG). We were greeted right away and it was nice to see the ""shop"" filled with scones and cakes and tea necessities.  We were escorted into the dining area and seated promptly. Our server came over and walked is through the menu and gave his schpeel. Very long yet helpful, but I had to hear the same thing 4 times over when he seated the other tables. I had no idea that Alice's was a no tipping restaurant. The tip is ""baked"" into the menu prices. I am always good with a small pot, I never finish. If you don't finish, they will gladly give you a to go cup. They have a wide range of black, white, green, and even decaf teas. I miss their big book like menu, it was nostalgic. I also miss their tea pot ties with charms :( Their scones looked amazing. I decided to have the pears with asparagus and a side of bacon. It was all tasty. The portions are big so that's a plus. My mom had the porridge that comes with many fixins. They forgot the raspberry coulis, but they brought it out when we realized it was missing. Some of their portions are too big to eat by yourself so I do wish they had half portions of the porridge and granola.My favorite thing at this location was seeing a group of littles come in, put on their fairy wings, and get sprinkled with fairy dust. Keep up the magic to touches!",1,,1

I tried the jasmine needle tea. Very refreshing, subtle jasmine flavor. We also ordered a carrot cake and berry scones. Its not just Alice's but bakers all over should serve some cakes without frosting as the carrot cake was way too sweet with it. But otherwise, great texture... moist and superbly flavored.",1,,
5,Insiya T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",204,9,2,4.0,11/12/2018,"I'm a huge fan of afternoon tea, and luckily, New York City provides a variety of restaurants and hotels that participate in tea service with many locations and price ranges. Alice's Tea Cup, nestled on the Upper West Side, is a charming and quaint place for friends, families, and large parties to enjoy. The venue, with steps leading down into the actual restaurant, is a welcome refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city streets. Although a bit narrow, the warm restaurant was packed when we arrived. We waited about thirty minutes to finally get seated - we visited on a Saturday afternoon, which may have contributed to the rush inside.Once at our table, the waitress was polite and friendly. My cousin and I picked our scones, clotted cream, sandwiches, and chose from a menu consisting of many, many teas. For an afternoon tea service for two, we were treated to two pots of tea; we chose an herbal tea and a second, milkier Earl Grey. For sandwiches, we indulged in a classic 'Cucumber and watercress' and a more flavorful 'Curried chicken salad.' Moments later, our tea and tray arrived, and we feasted. The food was plentiful - so much so, that even after almost three hours of chatting and eating, we could not finish it all. The sandwiches, although tasty, were cut into unusual rectangles, rather than the typical triangle, which made for eating them quite challenging. The filling spilled out on the sides - our tea experience felt messy, rather than dainty. The scones were yummy, as were the desserts, which consisted of macaroons, cakes, and cookies. Although it felt indulgent, we couldn't finish our tray, and therefore the amount of food given felt wasteful. If you're looking for a more posh afternoon tea experience, this is probably not the spot for you. However, for two people, the afternoon tea service was reasonably priced at around $70, which is much more inexpensive than a standard hotel tea service in the city. If you're looking for a fun, relaxing afternoon tea service, then I'd recommend Alice's Tea Cup.",,,

Asked for another, was told extra was $.25 more. I get if I was asking for 4 more. But really felt like they were buckle and dining. And considering RE scone is $4. Can't imagine, would they charge extra if I sat in and asked for more condiments as well?Not sure the extra $.25 was worth an unhappy customer and a bad review. But that's the choice they have made.

7,Rhonda L.,"Long Beach, CA",118,320,407,4.0,10/29/2018,"After reading about this tea house years ago, I wanted to try it.  I  bought a living social deal weeks before my trip, so it gave me a reason to have to go.  I took my BF who probably thought this was too girly, but he discovered he really likes scones and tea.  You need a reservation as the smallish place fills up.  We arrived at 3:30 PM and three or four tables were taken, but by the time we left, the place was full.  There were all age ranges.  A few little girls who looks to be 4 to 5 having birthdays with their parents and another one with a party of friends.  They were all wearing fairy wings and were so cute.  There were college students, retirees, and ages in between.  There were a couple of men patrons as well as servers, so my BF didn't feel like he didn't fit in.  The food:  three tiers of scones, sandwiches, and desserts.  We had to take some home, which was my snack for 2 days.  Sandwiches and scones were very good.  I'd agree with another review that the cookies could be a little more flavorful, but I still enjoyed them. Tea houses are generally a little pricey, but this was affordable with the deal and for the amount of food served.",,,
8,Estrella E.,"Queens, NY",127,43,81,4.0,8/8/2018,I kept hearing a lot of good things about this place and was excited to finally try it. I especially love the decor of the place. It made me feel like I was having tea with the Mad Hatter. My BF and I were seated on a table that used to be a vintage sewing machine with the pedal. It brought back memories when I used to play with my Grandma's sewing machine. We ordered the genmaiche tea and apple cinnamon scones. I'm not a big fan of cinnamon on anything but putting jam on it hid the distinct cinnamon taste.  The scone tasted good but I wish that they have more pastries for vegans. They have great tea selection cant wait to go back to try their other teas. Plus: You can put on wings and feel like a fairy. Who wouldn't find that fun? No one because we're all mad here.,3,2,3

The tea was a perfect thing to relax us, which was much needed! I ordered the berry scone for myself and my friend got the carrot cake. Everything is freshly made that same day and so you can tell from the taste. The scone comes with some jam and butter. I just couldn't stop myself from eating the scone! My mind knew its too much calorie! but my heart couldn't stop!The whole place is very small and kind of cute.

11,Monica G.,"Concord, CA",74,80,259,5.0,8/3/2018,"I really enjoyed having brunch at this place! I wanted to try something different and this Alice in Wonderland theme sounded like something fun and unique to experience while on my trip to New York.We decided to get the afternoon tea for two to get a little taste of everything the place had to offer. It comes with 3 scones, 2 types of cold sandwiches, a dessert with small cookies, and one flavor of unlimited tea. It comes on this adorable three tiered plate!The only drawback is the sandwiches are bite sized so if you're hoping for a more filling/nourishing lunch then this might not be for you. But the scones are pretty good and I loved the mocha cake dessert!I highly recommend checking this out if you're looking for something different for brunch!

We had the ""lunch for two, plus one,"" which cost us pennies under $100, and basically included 3 scones, two sandwiches, flavored water, and one dessert - a mini tart shared three ways. The scones, sandwiches and interesting tea offerings were very good.  The other included cookies were terrible and not worth eating but just fillers so it appeared to be more food. Had this not been exorbitantly priced for what we received I would have rated it better, but it was a lot of hype for little substance.  I felt the same about the decor. The service was very friendly.",,,
16,Aishwarya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,73,125,4.0,9/5/2018,This is a great place to be if you want to have a sober girls night out where you can have tea and gossip. Which is exactly what I did. We did have to wait for a while since there is a wait time and we did come on a weekend. Also they hold a lot of tea parties for children here you will spot a lot of kids in princesses *cough* Elsa costumes. This place gets really noisy but that shouldn't bother you if you are coming here to talk or gossip. The tea and cakes taste good but they are not spectacular. This place is more about the ambience and the concept than the food so you should probably come here to spend quality time with your BFF with some tea and talk about silly stories.,,,
17,Tatiana C.,"Beechurst, Queens, NY",83,47,132,4.0,10/24/2018,Alice's tea cup is one of those famous NYC restaurants that was on my bucket list for years. I'm a tea drinker and love the idea of tea time so I'd been meaning to try this place for a while. I decided to go for my birthday brunch a few weeks ago. I made a reservation online and arrived early. We waited for everyone to arrive though they told us we might loose are table but everyone was on time. Immediately I noted it was packed with little kids which for some reason I had discounted (my bad?). But what was rough was that everything seem to be child sized. Meaning small tables and seating. I know NYC restaurants are small but this place seemed particularly squished. And they only had one restroom which blows my kind for any restaurant that serves more than 2 people as a time. Otherwise there is a large tea selection and the food was good. They gave me fairy wings and sang happy birthday. It was cute but definitely a one time experience to try.,,,
18,Alice H.,"Melbourne, Australia",600,109,249,3.0,11/10/2018,The tea was really good but why is it so overpriced???,1,,
19,Sahithi B.,"Seattle, WA",290,53,72,5.0,3/25/2018,"AMBIANCE - A modest hole in the wall place with an incredibly welcoming and warm feeling to it. The cushions on the seats are worn but ornate and the walls have cute hand painted designs that are Alice in Wonderland themed. Usually when I think of high tea, a grand and intimidating place comes to mind. This place is the total opposite, in the best way possible!! It's super homey and the perfect place to catch up with a friend over tea. My friends and I spent 2 hours munching on our food, drinking tea, and catching up.  FOOD - Came in with two other friends. We ordered The Mad Hatter and chose the make it ""Tea for Three"" option. We got the chive, blueberry, and pumpkin scones. They all tasted amazing! They came out warm and gently crisp on the outside. We got the egg and cucumber and watercress sandwiches. Both were delicious and filled us up the perfect amount. The dessert was a little underwhelming. There were three of us and they only gave us one tiny little chocolate mousse pot. And the assorted cookies weren't anything special either.TEA - The tea was awesome! I am generally not a tea person but I had a lot of fun trying all of the different types of tea. I think I ordered 3 different pots while I was there. I think the tea is the best part since you can keep sipping on it while talking to your friends and essentially try as many flavors as you want.SERVICE - No complaints here! Everyone was attentive and it was easy to catch a waiter/waitress when we were ready for more tea. The wait wasn't too long either. We came in on a Sunday morning and only waited 20 minutes or less. I think the best part was that tip was already included into all of the menu prices!Overall, I would DEFINITELY come back to this place! The Mad Hatter came out to be $28.33 per person WITH TIP which feels a little pricey at first glance. But tea at Alice's Tea Cup is an experience, and I think considering that and the quality of everything we tasted it was definitely worth the cost!",2,1,1
20,Elle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,167,436,4.0,10/25/2018,Quaint little spot. Loved the ambience. The theme brings back childhood memories of Alice in Wonderland. The omelette and salad were bursting with flavor. The pumpkin pancakes were perfect for the fall weather. So many selections of teas. Staff were personable and friendly. My only gripe was the cost. $20 for 3 TINY pancakes and over $20 for the omelette. We left hungry and jipped and had to eat again.,,,

22,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,2.0,1/4/2018,"I came here for a brunch on a regular weekday. I was quite surprised how busy it was. The restaurant is rather crunched and not too stroller-friendly, something to take note.I was impressed with their Tea selection, as the restaurant's name would indicate. I was very underwhelmed with the food. I ordered a scone benedict and we also had a regular egg/potato dish. The benedict's eggs were cooked too long, the scone was pretty dry, the potatoes included chicken that in all honesty tasted like cardboard. The service was also a bit slow (seemed to be understaffed if you ask me) and forgot a request for a condiment. I would probably rate this as a 1 for food and overall experience, but if I came here just for tea and maybe a couple desserts, it could be a much better. My advice would be to skip the breakfast-related food.",11,6,7

24,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",484,663,591,4.0,7/5/2018,"I loved it here! Came by today for afternoon tea with my husband after exploring the Museum of Natural History. I kept hearing great things about this place so I was excited to give it a try. Everything lived up to expectations. The decor is nice, I love the Alice in Wonderland pictures and quotes on the wall. My husband and I got the Mad Hatter, which is tea for two. It includes two large teapots (you could order more if you finish, but it is A LOT of tea), three scones, two sandwiches, cookies and dessert. For tea, we ordered the Peach Black Tea and Africana. Peach Black Tea tastes as you would expect, but the Africana was surprisingly nice. Had great flavor and wasn't sweet at all. For scones, we ordered the Blueberry Cream Cheese scone, Chocolate & Oatmeal scone and a Ham & Cheese scone. My husband had the entire ham & cheese scone (which is fine by me because I love sweet not savory) and he liked it, but couldn't taste the ham or cheese that much. The blueberry cream cheese is fantastic. The scone had a softer, smoother texture than most scones. It wasn't as dry as a normal scone. It pairs perfectly with the jam and cotted cream. The chocolate and oatmeal scone is good as well, but a bit on the dry side. The smoked salmon sandwich was delicious - the salmon tasted fresh and the salmon to bread ratio was perfect. My husband ordered the smoked chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it as well. The chocolate mousse was absolutely amazing - I just wish I ate it a little earlier since it kind of melted by the time we got to it. The cookies were eh honestly, nothing to brag about.The service is a bit eh some times. They were attentive in the beginning when we arrived, but they were a bit nonexistent during the meal and when we were waiting for the check. Overall, I recommend coming here if this is your first time having High Tea. It is well worth the experience and their tea menu is extensive.",1,,

Updated review","A quick update - the main street outside along Columbus is open for parking before 9am (and since they open at 8am, you can pop in here for a quick pickup!).They have ham & cheese and other savory scones in the back, and you are only allowed 6x of any individual scone since they sell out so easily on the weekend.All of the ones this weekend were without nuts (lovely) and no egg on the vegan one. The raspberry dark chocolate vegan was delicious, the mixed berry was great, the triple chocolate was ok, and the pumpkin was ok (though had cinnamon). The fresh cream and jam makes them all the more delightful.Faerie Wings ($30+ tax) and other random fun items on the wall for purchase in the front.",2,1,2
32,Rachel Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",386,43,46,3.0,5/15/2018,"tl;dr - Tea was really good, place was quirky and interesting, scones were BOMB, but prices are high and service was slow. Recommendation: Alice's tea and Cinnamon/Pear SconeI was really excited to try this place; I've never gone to somewhere like here for tea before! It's an unassuming entrance, but the inside of the restaurant is really unique and quirky. The teacups are adorable and all unique, and it is definitely a vibe. I think the concept is fun. My family and I were seated in the furthest room, and as a result, we felt pretty ignored and service was tremendously slow, especially when it came to getting the check and our orders. The tea was pretty good and had a unique taste, but it was expensive for what we got. The scones were absolutely delicious. However, both specials we got just tasted strongly of one ingredient rather than the flavor combination I was going for - e.g. cinnamon pear was just cinnamon. Served warm and yummy, though. Quite a high price tag of 5$ nonetheless. I could see myself coming here again with some friends who are visiting NYC, but hope my somewhat subpar experience with service was just a fluke.",3,1,3

They even helped us pick out scones to try that matched the flavor of teas we chose. The small themed rooms is great for a cup of tea but like all new York restaurants you are elbow to elbow with neighbors. The murals give the room character. Another fun feature is they lend out dress up wings and such for little girls joining in on the tea party. Amazing service, decent prices and fun theme.

The Mad Hatter afternoon tea tiers were all around us but we opted for the tea & scones option because we were planning on still having dinner that evening. There are a plethora of tea options here! My sister and I stuck with two ""House Blends"" because we figured these would be the best. She got a small pot of the 44th POTUS Blend and I got Alice's Magical Faerie Potion. The former was a delicious combination of berries and rose while the latter was a soft floral blend. We both got buttermilk scones and my sister opted for their seasonal pumpkin scone as well. I didn't tried hers but she enjoyed it! The buttermilk scones were a tad dry but were a fine vestibule for the cream and jam. The cream and jam were not my favorite but we were hungry enough to utilize it all. One aspect we really disliked was that our scones were brought out way before our tea. If anything, it should be the opposite! Otherwise we enjoyed our time here and would come again to sample more tea and perhaps try the tea sandwiches or the whole Mad Hatter.",2,,1

I waited 10 mons pf that time for the one restroom in the whole place. ordered my tea. they forgot about my tea order. ate my yummy carrot cake without tea or anything to drink. thankfully i had my own water bottle. chicken noodle soup was good and hot.  caramel pumkin cake was dry. the jam  paired with it helped to moisten it up. overall a busy, noisy place. not very organized. ots to be expected for a late sat afternoon tea time.  i did enjoy myself. i do like this lil gem. yes ill be back. seems like a lot of of fun for a girl tea party.",,,
40,Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1939,1089,4838,4.0,8/20/2017,"When I lived in the city, I frequented the upper east side location on East 64th Street mostly for the pumpkin scones. I loved those things! Cinnamony, sweet, and softer than your average scone, the pumpkin pastries were topped with a rich and buttery caramel glaze.On a recent trip to the city, a group of us ventured to the upper west side tea house for brunch. We enjoyed teas, scones, and a few breakfast sides.The tea variety is epic! They have an entire booklet of teas ranging from green teas, black teas, fruit teas, herbal teas, white teas, and organic teas. We ordered mango tea, chai tea, chocolate chai tea, sunset herbal blend tea, and rooibos coconut vanilla tea. They were all delicious!As far as scones go, several of us got pumpkin. Others tried the vegan dark chocolate and banana, turtle, and blueberry and lemon glaze scones. They were all presented with the traditional accoutrements- clotted cream and preserves. We added chicken sausage, potato and chicken hash, and poached eggs to round out our meal. I debated on whether to pick up a few items from the bakery on my way out but I was satisfied and already looking forward to my next pumpkin scone when I visit the city again.Each location of Alice's Tea Cup has an enchanting feel and having an 11-year-old girl with me was a perfect excuse to lose myself in the fairy tale of Alice in Wonderland. Thankfully, the pumpkin scones weren't just in my dreams.",16,6,14

Updated review","This was a story book kind and of space, ergo 'Alice's Tea Cup'. The decor matched the book. Just like a tea party. I liked it and tip was included in the price. That was cool. No figuring out how much tip to include. The fruit crepe and cookie plate was good. I loved the almond tea. I liked it enough to want to go back. Until a $16.50 crepe turned into $25.00.  Therefore no 4 for them. Maybe, I missed it on the menu when they say adding 2 extra things to your crepe adds $8.50. They already added $4 (I think may have been 2) for a make your own crepe. Also, I didn't like how limited the options were on the menu as far as sandwiches go. So a 3 sticks. And, probably no next time. There are other places to get a crepe that doesn't cost me $25.",1,,
44,Chris M.,"Durham, CT",96,115,66,2.0,7/9/2018,Brought my son is here for a treat after going to the museum. Thought it would be cute. It was cute but so over priced. I have to say the scones were on point. But the prices were so not worth it. The menu was a la cart mostly but then they had combination where you can share. But it was way too much food the one for two people and they would not let you share the one for two people. The desserts were sub par. The table was way too small for all the food and was not enjoyable because it was so cramped. The idea of it was way better then the realty. So disappointed.,2,,
45,Michelle M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1,4,2,1.0,1/16/2018,"It was my first time visiting Alice's Tea Cup for a friends birthday brunch. I generally do not leave negative reviews, but I'm big on customer service and rely on these very reviews to determine whether or not I want to spend my money and time at a venue.  Unfortunately, the standard at this restaurant was very poor. Where do I start? Having entered the restaurant, the brunch menu along with tea choices was pre-determined for us.  The wait service was being juggled by several confused people, the messaging was not consistent and any of our requests were not met.The waiter with the unicorn braids constantly was justifying his lack of good service or will to do anything by explaining he is one man show, juggling more than one party and that we needed to understand he is over worked busy.  This waiter was also so busy that when a champagne glass broke at our table rather than clearing the table and getting rid of the broken glass immediately (like any other place would have done)  he choose to prioritize the birthday cake and candles before leaving without the broken glass and cake - he just walked away all together leaving both behind with no reason other than I will be right back.  25 minutes later , he returns and I remind him of the broken glass he left behind and he quickly responds you never gave it to me.  We were serviced by a total of 4 different people, unicorn braids, a ""manager"" that Ok'd all of the miss ups, oh and lets not forget the guy  from the kitchen running out like a chicken without a head spilling hot water everywhere including right by my very pregnant friends stomach before placing on the table.  The waiting staff is the worst I've seen in a very long time: rude, not polished, and unprofessional. Happy Birthday wasn't sung until the very end right after they presented us with to go boxes.   This experience was far from celebratory and is memorable in the worst light.  There are a bunch of other establishments throughout the city where you spend less money and get impeccable service.",8,,1

48,CJ D.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,18,110,3.0,10/20/2018,"This is my first time here.. Always wanted to do High Tea..lol..but never got a chance.. Knowing this, one of my friends took me here as a belated birthday gift.. When I first got there I noticed the store to be a lot smaller than I thought.. I always got the impression that it was a bigger place.. Once inside, it seemed like I was entering a tea store instead of a place to be seated and have tea.. Upon looking further back, I noticed seats towards the back of the store. The place was brightly lit with butterfly wings, books, teas, and other assortments hanging on the walls for anyone who want to purchase.. As I was waiting to be assisted, there were two ladies ahead of me also waiting to be seated and one gentleman waiting to pay for loose teas he wanted to purchase to go.. The one person behind the register didn't acknowledge us (the ladies and I) in anyway way, which made me wonder if I there was a long wait as the place was so small. Fortunately, after 10-15 mins my friend and I were seated. The place was indeed smaller than I thought but still spacious enough that one didn't feel cluster-phobic. There were pictures on the wall of Alice at different stages of her life. The one closest to our table was of a drunk Alice which I thought was hilarious. Even the Bathroom was brightly decorated with murals of Alice and her friends. The tables were also decorated with different items within the table on display under a see-through glass. After a few minutes out waitress (Denise) took our order. My Friend got us a Groupon Deal for The Mad Hatter which comes with Tea For Two (Served with unlimited tea, we got the Ginger and Almond Tea), choice of three scones (we got the Buttermilk, Mixed Fruits, & Ham/Cheese), choice of two sandwiches (we got the Smoked Salmon & Lapsang Souchong Smoked Chicken Breast), and assorted mini cookies with choice of mocha cake, lemon tart, or chocolate mousse (We got the Mocha). Everything was delicious. So good.. We pretended we were in England and enjoyed ourselves with all the teas our stomachs could handle (which wasn't beyond the one pot to my disappointment..lol..). Than took most of the food home. Our waitress (Denise) and another young lady (Jen) were the best. They made the experience so much better. Although I wish we could have gotten that from all the stuff when we first got there, but such is life ^_^. I would definitely recommend this place if you are someone who would like experience High Tea or just have a nice cup of tea with a friend ^_^ One last thing to mention is that this place does not do tips, but we left one anyway because she was so great ^_^",,,
49,Lena J.,"Princeton, NJ",232,154,1327,4.0,7/16/2017,"Very charming place with creative scone flavors!I got two scones to go - one strawberries and cream and one turtle, $4 each, with jam and clotted cream. The strawberries and cream scone had a light lemon glaze and chunks of strawberries. The scones were tender, crumbly, and almost biscuit-like, albeit slightly dry. The turtle scone had a caramel glaze on top, with chocolate and pecans inside, and still very good the next morning (the glaze helped with this).Previously I've had the passion fruit iced tea, which was delicious - the passion fruit flavor is really prominent! The eco-friendly paper straws are cute, but they become soft after a while, making it harder to drink the tea.",2,,

We tried Christmas brew, symphony, Moroccan mint and oolong and we love each and every one of them. We also tried hummus and curry chicken sandwich and vegan scone they were all delicious. I think the prices are pretty good, small tea pot yields 3-4 cups for around $5, sandwiches are a bit pricey $18 which comes with a salad- it's all worth it though very delicious!

52,T.K M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",3,62,52,4.0,7/16/2018,"Great place to relax and chat with a cup of tea, a few breakfast pastries (scones are delicious) or a couple of light sandwiches and finish the whole occasion with something sweet. The original tea cup place is in a very relaxed setting with shelves of big canister of tea lining at the front counter. The dominant colors within are purple, blue and yellow with writings from the original fairytale (I think) printed in attractive fonts circling the surrounding walls. Our family came on a Sunday afternoon after attending the New York Ice cream Blizzard event not far away from the restaurant. I have heard many tails of this magical place and was excited to bring my wife and our 5 year old on a journey down the rabbit hole. To start, the tea cup, as mentioned earlier, is a wonderful place to relax, chat, read a book, or finish a project. The staffs are friendly, although a little bit under staffed IMO. To make the experience more magical for kids, our receptionist gave my daughter a pair of butterfly wings and a swirl of glittering fairy dust. And as for us, we ordered the Mad Hatter set. In the end our magical journey was mostly enjoyable. We had two pots of tea (Alice elixer potion fabulous), three scones (blueberry, buttermilk, ham and cheese) , two sandwiches (curry chicken salad and smoked chicken breast with green apple), and associated cookies for dessert. The tea was fabulous, and the scones were delicious, especially the blueberry and the buttermilk. The chicken salad IMO needs more flavor and salt. And unfortunately the smoked chicken breast was dry and the green apple slices had peels on them, making the sandwiches with an even tougher chew. The rest of the sweets (cookies, moose and brownie) were passable with no fault. The pricing for the foods are high, as a scone costs $5 and a small pot of tea is $9. But the restaurant do offer set menus like our Mad Hatter which comes with unlimited tea. In addition, the final price includes tips. Overall, we had good time at Alice's tea cup. Will we return? Yes on special occasions, but travel is a hassle.",,,
53,Tracy D.,"Merrick, NY",267,413,2012,4.0,11/21/2017,"One of the college day go-to favorites of my college friends and mine. After class we would come here just for their A-M-A-Z-I-N-G scones. No matter what flavor we ordered there was no disappointment. My favorite there is the mixed berry scones that are served with a side of jam and clotted cream. The savory scones are served with butter. Usually we come here for afternoon tea, but this time around by sister had a gilt city deal for a two course meal that came with two entrees, two scones, a dessert to share and a glass of wine. We got the mushroom and guyere cheese scone and the blueberry banana scone. Both scones were equally great. They were packed with just enough flavor and had a great buttery texture. For entree I got the Lapsang Souchong smoked chicken breast sandwich. The sandwich had a little tartness from the green apple and light flavor of the chicken. It was served with a small refreshing side salad. For dessert we shared Jean's no yet so famous mocha cake. It was a sweet finish that had a thick mocha buttercream. Along with the meal we ordered a pot of tea to share of the bai hao white champagne oolong tea.Our server Riley was a delight to make sure we were happy campers. The location is small, so they are limited in seating depending the time of day. They let little kids borrow wings while dining here which is very cute.",5,1,2

It came with a scone per person, eggs, and yogurt with tons of granola. Each person gets their own pot of tea. I was certainly satisfied with the tea and food. Hoping to be back to try the regular afternoon tea set. The whole vibe of this cute place fits Alice & Wonderland (if the name didn't give that away already). Don't expect anything too fancy--it's rather casual. Also, if you're a fan of tea time because you grew up in the UK or Hong Kong, don't expect the quality of those countries. In comparison to British Tea Time, Alice's Tea Cup might downgrade to 3/5 stars. My rating is based on the fact that it's a good deal for tea time in USA.",1,,1

So right off the bat, Alice's Tea Cup, (for me) is not cozy romantic... it's just cozy cute- in a whimsical sort of way and everybody having a cool time. Mismatched chairs in the waiting area and antique wood floors, add a warm, worn look to Alice's. Hand paintings of the Mad Hatter, Alice- herself and The Hare, decorate their walls. Serving Station at the front of the house, has a wicker basket with character ceramics, holding sugar packets, straws and such. Also hooked up, with their Tea arsenal and cake stands either holding Brownie Squares or cake slices. My daughter and I caught up with chatting for 30 minutes while we waited for our table- so be mindful, making reservations, is the best move at Alice's Tea Cup.I'll admit, Alice's Menu, is substantial with Teas and light fare. I settled for a slice of Chocolate Cake- which was moist and deliciously good with a sweet Rainbow Buttercream. My daughter went for the only Peanut Butter & Ganache slice and settled on coffee. I went straight in for a 3-cup pot of their Chocolate Chai (with Cream) that had all the perfect notes of subtle Cocoa and Chai Spice. Although Alice's Tea Cup captures a playful essence, my only gripe was seeing hanging cables (I don't know why) by their entrance and empty industrial white bucket(s) under their service station that made Alice's appear unkept and honestly, was not an entirely, cute first impression.

My +1 and I ordered the Mad Hatter and let me tell you, there was more food than we could handle (and we can handle a lot of food). Tea: Alice's Tea & Alice's faerie potion. Both paired well with our afternoon tea. If you like chamomile, faerie potion comes highly recommended －the chamomile in it is quite potent. If you prefer something drastically less strong, Alice's Tea would be a much toned down version. Sandwiches (2):The chopped tea-egg salad was my favorite of the two. It's egg-salad but better. The lapsang souchong smoked chicken breast was a bit dry and bland for my liking. It would have been far better if it had a sauce/spread. Overall, these sandwiches were larger than tea-size and the bread was a bit tough. Sweets (1): We selected the Mocha cake and the flavor was reminiscent of a certain See's Candies. It was humongous in size! I just wish it was less stiff and more moist.Scones (3): The bulk of the stars goes to the scones. They have the BEST scones!

The restaurant is generally small, but it has cute decorations & the seating arrangements are comfortable. We tried the mad hatter and although it was a bit expensive, it was worth the price. The mad hatter came with to two tea pots with your choice of tea. I ordered the high noon & it had a fruity, taste & my boyfriend ordered the detox me. The tea came with milk, but I definitely enjoyed the high noon tea better. The mad hatter had a choice of three scones (I ordered the ham & cheese, pumpkin with caramel glaze & strawberry and banana), then a choice of sandwich (I ordered the salmon sandwich, and my boyfriend ordered the egg salad with an add on of salmon), and lastly, an assortment of cookies with a choice of desert. I ordered the mocha cake. Everything was so filling, I couldn't finish everything. I enjoyed the food and tea so much that I would definitely suggest it to anyone and everyone.",,,1
76,Emily H.,"Clifton, NJ",111,39,37,5.0,6/6/2017,"I've been to this and other Chapters of Alice's Tea Cup several times and I am always a HUGE fan. As such, my review for this and Chapter I will be basically the same.First off, USE GROUPON. If this is your first time here and you want to just check it out, groupon usually has a great deal for the ""Mad Tea For Two"" that costs only $25 and it a great way to go for your first time with a friend and see how you like it. Worked on me, and now I'm hooked and paid full price several times over. That deal includes two pots of coffee or tea, two scones with clotted cream and ham, greek yogurt with berries and AMAZING granola, and three eggs anyway. I generally only get this when I come here because it's great.This is the only Chapter that I have tried an actual meal at (not the mad tea) and it was AMAZING. Crispy home fried potatoes with chicken, gorgeously cooked eggs, and creamy dreamy hollandaise all over it. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious.The food here is always great. All of their housemade goods like the scones, jam, and granola are absolutely amazing. I've tried several of their scones (they typically mix it up) and have always loved them, but my favorite is their banana and chocolate scone. Their teas have never disappointed, but I'm a sucker for chocolate so my go-to choice is the chocolate chai (I also prefer milky teas), but their basic English breakfast type (not sure of the official name) is also delicious!Other than the wonderful food and tea the ambiance here really takes the tea-cake (ba-dum-ts). The hand painted walls, the sweet antique mismatched china, the mismatched tables and chairs - it is all absolutely adorable! Great for a girls day out brunch, a cute date, and even a nice day out for mother's day with the (hopefully well-behaved) kids.Basically, this place is amazing! And not only that, it is consistent - I've been there about four or five times by now and am never let down.MAJOR TIP: Get there early! The wait can be a little long, but there's also plenty to do around if you just put your name down and wait for a call.",6,,
77,Friya B.,"New York, NY",5,56,97,5.0,2/27/2017,"A lovely, quaint little restaurant/cafe filled with images of Alice in Wonderland. When you enter you could buy a few scones or bakery items at the front counter if you are in a rush or if you want to sit, there is a seating area in the back. Once seated there are tons of different options to drink for tea. There is a full menu (5 pages long) dedicated to teas from all around the world. My personal favorite is the traditional english breakfast tea. It is the perfect pick me up after a long day. To eat, get the buttermilk scones. You will not regret it. They are absoutely delicious and typically served with clotted cream and strawberry jam. Absoutely delicious. If you want something more, go for the lemon tarte or even the smoked salmon sandwich. But are amazing.",,,

Updated review","Charming but loud, especially on the weekends. Extremely overpriced for what you get.Reservations: They don't take them for less than 6 people from Thursday-Sunday which means that the 4 or 5 of you have to wait around for at least 45 minutes during the best tea time slots. In this sense, it is just as expedient as arriving without reservations to The Palm Court at the Plaza for Saturday afternoon tea (and it is only modestly more expensive at The Palm-$70 per person compared to $50 per person here). Alice's also used to have all sorts of fun novelty items for sale in the waiting area (similar to the quirky offerings at Serendipity) but over the years they've slimmed down their merchandise which makes the wait particularly colorless.  Menu: Confusing. They have a few different types of categories of offerings with different titles (for example, the standard is The Mad Hatter but you can also get The Gluten-Free and a few others) but you can also order sandwiches that are not part of the titled groupings and it isn't clear what can be supplemented and when/if they are charging you more for the off-menu items even when you are forgoing some of the items in the titled list and replacing them with a la carte items. This is especially irritating if you are on a special diet and need to pick and choose. I also feel like they gyp you. The last time, I came with 4 people and we were brought out one tower for all of us when we each ordered The Mad Hatter. Yes, they continued to refill some things *when we flagged them down to ask*, but we left with each of us getting 1 sandwich, 1 scone, a few small cookies and a 1/4 sliver of a slice of stale cake. For over $200 for 4 people, you should be getting much more. The rabbit hole, indeed.-Sandwiches are generally all tasty but often the bread seems stale or too dry.-Scones are delicious but the clotted cream isn't like the real clotted cream I had while living in London.-Cookies are uninteresting and hard. Cakes are too dense and heavily sweetened.-No matcha and generally poor green tea selection. For what you get with their prices, I much prefer the cozier atmosphere and tastier (although less filling) bites at The Pierre (at Two E Bar -except when they are running promotions and except on weekends where it seems all of Staten Island and New Jersey show up to clatter utensils/snap endless flash photos/purposefully cackle and talk loudly to call attention to themselves), Tea and Sympathy, and The Regis for special tea service. Regis is especially tranquil. There, you have more privacy, you aren't rushed by the waiters, and kids aren't yelping around you. And only for about $15 more per person.",6,1,
79,Sunidhi G.,"Jersey City, NJ",124,104,159,3.0,2/13/2017,"I have heard so much about this place for years, that I always wanted to try it. However, coming from NJ to uptown feels a little bit of a hike. But one day, me and my friend decided to visit this cute place for breakfast. We used a Groupon deal for Mad Morning Breakfast, where we had the scones, scrambled eggs, yogurt and granola, with 2 teapots. It was a lot of food for 2 people. The scones were amazing. I feel like you can order any of the scones. They are really worth the wait. And they come with butter and preserves. They have huge huge selection of tea flavors, from black to herbal, to white, and you can order any as part of the combo. Each teapot comes with milk and honey on the side. As a tea lover, I loved the whole vibe of the place. And the teas were really good. Everything else was average and nothing to be written about. As we can guess, the theme of the place is inspired from Alice in Wonderland's tea party. The whole restaurant has the storyline painted on walls. Rest of the decor is also very nicely done. Kids would definitely love this place. They do provide kids colors while they wait for food to arrive.Now, comes the reason why still 3 stars. The servers are polite, but the service is terrible. First, they take forever to seat you. Be prepared for at least 60 minute wait. They tell you that you will get a call when your table is ready, but I noticed that they tend to give preference to people who are standing and waiting there, instead of the ones who put their name on the list and left. Secondly, once seated, no one comes to take your order for next 30 minutes. And then the food took another 45 minutes to arrive. We also noticed that lot of tables were not cleared even after people left, and others were waiting to be seated. In the end, we left really stuffed, thanks to the food and lot of conversation we had. Its worth a visit, but  not more than once.",,,
80,Ana C.,"Allentown, PA",0,17,0,2.0,10/12/2018,"I've been to Alice's before and quite enjoyed it. However, last week was lack luster. The staff were friendly (hence my 2 points) but the scones were so dry they were hard to even nibble at. The jam and clot cream amount was tiny for the 3 very very very dry scones we got. The cookies that came with our order were also very dry and pretty tastless, even for my 5 year old and what 5 year old doesnt lovecookies??? After this experience, I don't known if I will be back. The food was mediocre at best, the quality and love they used to put into their food is just no longer present. Shame.",,,
81,Rebecca L.,"New York, NY",192,338,98,5.0,6/22/2017,"Alice's Tea Cup is one of the most unique, charming, and whimsical spots in NYC. The Alice in Wonderland themed tea shop offers the best scones and wide selection of teas. The scones aren't your typical hard scone, but more so similar to a moist biscuit. This is a great place to visit for afternoon tea, dessert, or even brunch. Weekends here are very busy, you can expect 1-2 hour wait times. Every time I have a visitor, I make sure to bring them here. Everyone I've taken here enjoys coming here- even men can't resist Alice's Tea Cup's appeal.",1,,1
82,Indra R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",4,73,326,3.0,6/30/2017,"I came to alice's tea cup originally for a friends birthday celebration. It's a cute space sort of hidden away, but close by the park. The walls are painted different colors and the pictures are all slightly askew - a nice subtle connection to the wonkiness of alice in wonderland. I typically go for the $15 pot of tea and two scones deal. They take while to come out, but when they do they come warm and have always been a hit with the group im with. I typically get the buttermilk scone as it goes amazingly with the jelly and cream provided (so cute!) or one of their savory ones like bacon and cheddar. The Indian Chai tea is my favorite because it's a caffeinated black tea and comes with milk and honey. The only real downside to this spot is it's pricy menu, which comes unsurprising for being in the upper west side. All instances that i've gone there has been some sort of children's party or event going on, so this place isn't the quietest, but they also have to go options if you wanted good tea while you walk in the park.",1,,
83,Sandra K.,"New York, NY",0,16,37,3.0,3/20/2018,Afternoon tea with scones! It's a cute place with tons of tea choices. Scones were good. But everything is very expensive for not apparent reason. I would suggest you do one tea with one scone. We had 2 and it was a lot. The goat cheese scone is nice. The herbal tea was really nice.,,,
84,Brian O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",618,57,99,5.0,7/30/2017,"My friend recommended me to this place, thus I went with her to catch up on life (since it's been a few years, including being a teacher aged us a little bit). She stated that this place is the place she always takes her friends that are newer to the New York area. I really loved how cute the place looked, even when it was a bit on the small side. The place has much more seats than it appears in the front, and we got seated immediately. The place has a lot of different types of tea (of fruity and flowery-base taste). That being stated, I got the Benedict Egg with ham scone, and have to state that it was amazing. The tea was also wonderful (got one that was more fruity based), and enjoyed the brunch conversation with my friend. Would recommend going to this place to have conversations with a friend or as a date.",,,
85,John W.,"New York, NY",129,46,48,4.0,1/25/2018,Excellent place to enjoy tea time with kids or a whimsical friend. Very large selection of quality teas that are prepared expertly. The scones and sandwiches are quite exquisite with the smoked chicken sandwich as a particular standout. The desserts were a bit of a miss. The cookies were inedible and tasted like they came from a low cost bulk bakery. On the other hand the chocolate mousse was quite nice. Service was good. Prices are in the high end for what you are actually getting and the noisy environment caused by the large number of children can be off-putting.,,,
86,Doriee D.,"Las Vegas, NV",265,406,1434,3.0,10/24/2016,"It was a cold and rainy day in NYC. It was chilly and we had nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. So perhaps, we should have some tea and warm ourselves back up while hiding away from the rain! We looked on Yelp and Alice's Tea Cup was just right around the corner! Perfect! When you first get in, you'll see the front of the shop where you can buy teas and get pastries to go. Further in is the ""restaurant"" side, I guess you can call it -- that's where all the tables are if you want to sit down and eat or have tea time. It's not a huge space and it can't fit a ton of people so if they do get real busy, I'll assume the wait time is pretty bad. But as a party of five, we only waited a little bit before the table was cleared and cleaned up for us. The interior of the whole place is simply adorable. Their theme? Alice in Wonderland of course! There are pictures on the walls and quotes as well. It is so adorable inside! The bathroom was adorable as well!Our table was off to the side so half of us sat with a booth as a chair while two of my friends sat on actual chairs. I won't lie. Their booth area kind of scares me. I understand that fabric gets dirty and old and sometimes the restaurants won't deep clean them as often, which is fine for a lot of people. However, I'm just a little bit of a germaphobe so when I see fabric booths or covers that are dirty, old, and with crumbles all over them .. I'm just a tiny bit disgusted. I was super uncomfortable the whole time I was there but all my friends were fine. I'm just a special one. Don't be me wrong, they were cute because of the vintage designs and color -- they matched with the theme but it's just not my preference. Between my friends and I, we ordered some chicken noodle soup and two pots of tea. For a pot of tea that contains 6 servings, it's about $10, which isn't bad at all. And they have a very extensive tea list on top of that. If you don't like straight black/green/white tea, they have a few tea specials where they mix them so it's a blend. One of our teas was a detoxing blend tea, which was very good. They have honey, sugar, and cream at the table for you so you can adjust the tea to your liking. As for our chicken noodle soup, a bowl is about $10 and it was okay. My friends thought it wasn't as flavorful as it should be but hey, that just means it's got less sodium! The price, however, is on a bit of the steep end of things for soup. Overall, Alice's Tea Cup is an adorable place to stop in for tea. I'm not sure if I would want a meal here but the atmosphere is really nice here :)",3,1,

The sandwich was amazing, I'm talking about the curry chicken salad sandwich, what a great idea. The smoked chicken sandwich was good too!

I wanted the carrot cake but they said they were all out of cakes except for the chocolate ones. ‍I wanted to come to this place because it's well-known and I thought the decor would be cuter since it's supposed to be Alice in Wonderland theme.

90,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,5.0,9/25/2016,"Alice is a darling tea shop in Upper West Side. We partook from the brunch menu, which consisted of egg benedicts, crepes, and scones. I chose the smoked salmon benedict, which is rosemary hollandaise on top of poached eggs nestled in the house specialty buttermilk scone. The poached eggs were perfectly executed and coated the scone with so much creaminess that was even more elevated by the fragrant rosemary. I think a scone is a much better vehicle for benedicts over english muffins because the latter often becomes too hard, too soon. The dish was served with pan fried asparagus and warm pear, which was a great sweet-counterweight to the savory dish. I'd love to come back to have this dish again the next time I am in NY.Brownie points for the gigantic coffee mug that serves about 2.5 cups of coffee in one and double brownie points for the super friendly staff!",2,,1

96,Erik J.,"Seattle, WA",92,34,9,2.0,10/29/2017,"Alice's Tea Cup is a little store with some loose tea and pastries for sale up front and a small tea room in the back. I'm partial to small tea rooms, and had run out of decaf Ceylon--my bedtime treat. Alice's on the UWS was close and sold loose tea, so I stopped by on my way home from the greengrocer. On entering, I was surprised at the bareness of the front of house. I'm not a huge fan of the overly floral/kitchy decor that so many Americans thing constitutes a ""proper"" British tea shop, but I was surprised at just how stark/plain the front of house is. The tea room in the back, however, looked to be more welcoming, like somewhere that I would want to come with friends for a leisurely cuppa on a weekend afternoon. I'll not be back, however, as the quality of the product and the customer service were ultimately disappointing.I can put up with poor customer service for a quality loose tea, however, the product itself is rather poor. The nose was good, although a bit strong. But, it is Earl Grey and so I expect a good Bergamot kick. However, on brewing, there is an unexpected ""sharp"" aftertaste that I'm not used to with even moderate quality Earl Greys. The loose tea is more tea ""dust"" like you would find if you tore open a tea bag rather than the ""tip and two leaves"" that I expect from a loose tea. (See the comparison picture I posted. The left is my purchase from Alice's Tea Cup, the right is an Earl Grey from Harrods.) The loose tea is particulate enough that, when I got home and brewed a pot, much of the tea ""leaf"" passed right though my tea strainer (center on my picture) and into my cup. I'll have to use a cloth tea sachet to brew it from now on. Honestly, this is not the worst tea I've had, but it is the worst loose leaf tea I've purchased. You can get better at Starbucks or at a grocery store.The customer service was also disappointing. There were two young ladies working the counter and the one who was helping me was very uninformed. I originally came in looking for a decaf Ceylon or Darjeeling--my pre-bed treat--and when I asked if they carried either, she confided to me that she was new there and didn't know the products. Given that, I would have expected her more seasoned co-worker to step in and help. She did not. After a few moments of the tea list and shelves, I gave up and ordered the Decaf Earl Grey that was front, center and obvious. I was then disappointed that she didn't offer to let me smell it; I had to prompt her. (Reputable tea shops, if they know you're ordering something other than what you came for, always offer to let you check the nose of the product.) The nose seemed acceptable, so then I asked the price and was told what it was per ounce. I asked where it was from, who imported it, etc. Things that any reputable Tea Shop would be able to tell you. Neither she nor her co-worker knew either of these. I wasn't trying to quiz them, it's just something I like to know on any tea I purchase. I ordered six ounces (my standard order) but when she tried to ring it up, the computer spat back a price per ounce that was double what I'd been told/what was printed on the price list! Her more experienced co-worker explained to her that ""the computer is correct. It's more up to date, the price list was printed years ago."" I then paid for my tea and left. Had I known that the product would ultimately be disappointing, I would have not bought the tea.Final comments on the pricing fiasco:1. The printed (incorrect) price was on a sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper, nothing fancy. Seriously, if your prices double... spend the $0.15 at Kinkos to get a new price sheet printed! Or print it at home. Or at the library. It's not hard.2. Anyone who works in customer service knows that if there is a discrepancy between the price that the customer sees and the price that the computer spits out, you ALWAYS make the sale at the lower price. Then you quietly, go and correct the incorrect price after closing for the evening. You don't sell it to the customer at the higher price.",1,,1

The reasons I knocked a star out was - they didn't have a changing table for babies in the restroom. But more importantly, the bread on our cucumber sandwich and egg salad sandwich was dry.

One of my friends suggested that we come here because she had been here once before so I decided to try the food.I ended up ordering a sandwich...which was mediocre and sorry to say but it wasn't worth the price!!! $16 for this? I think I could find myself a better sandwich for half the price. Maybe the baked goods would've been a better choice..Save your $ for a better place..,1,,
105,Bridget W.,"Philadelphia, PA",275,339,901,5.0,6/21/2016,"This place is absolutely adorable!We came here on a Saturday afternoon and I was terrified that we weren't going to get a table. Prior to arrival, I tried calling all three of their locations to see how long the wait was. None of their locations would pick up the phone though. When we got here, we tried our luck by walking in and asking for a table for four. And shockingly enough, we were seated immediately! We did afternoon tea for three. We had the choice to pick four scones, three teas, two sandwiches and a fancy dessert to go with our cookies. We picked the lavender earl grey, the fancy earl grey and the peach flower for our teas. We loved them! The peach flower was our favorite though. For our scones, we picked two lemon-blueberry, a pumpkin and a chocolate salted caramel. We loved the lemon-blueberry and the chocolate s.c. was the most decadent scone we ever had! All delicious! For our sandwiches we picked the chicken breast and the egg salad. Both sandwiches were good but we enjoyed the egg salad a little more. The chicken breast was a little bland but I enjoyed the goat cheese and apples on it! And for our fancy dessert we picked chocolate mousse. Hands down, the best mousse I've ever had! Boy it was good! The afternoon tea is served on beautiful three tiered plates. We had a great time enjoying our tea here. The prices are fairly reasonable as well. I can't wait to come back!",1,,2

Two pots of teaThree scones 2 sandwichesMini dessert and cookies!!Wowza!We both ordered versions of White Tea that was SOOO aromatic! Light and hot, but not burning; the sips hit the spot!The ramekins of raspberry preserves and clotted cream were delish!We used them on the not-too-sweet scones and nibbled away!I was faintly, happily, overwhelmed, with a multitude of flavours.... they are pleasantly jumbled in my mind! The curried chicken and watercress/cucumber sandwiches were heartier than ones I've had elsewhere... I wasn't impressed with the lemon tart filling, then again, perhaps it's that I expected something else.Couldn't eat the crunchy cookies... I was stuffed!!!Due to volume, average stay is usually two hours....I can just IMAGINE whiling away an afternoon reading and sipping through their plethora of teas or sampling of wines! Unfortunately management likely knows these possibilities and thus a sort-of time limit! LolI shall return!",3,,

While we waited they doused her in ""pixie dust"" and gave her a pair of wings. This is a BIG deal for a 5 year old and she LOVED it! Hubby and I both ordered croque monsior sands. They were good, but served with a pretty tasteless side salad. My daughter got the wee tea ($29!!) for a scone, pb and j sand, and a very tiny chocolate mouse cup. After tip we paid around $100 for the three of us. I think this is more of a three to four $ place, vs a two. We did nab some close street parking for $3.50!It was good, and a fun experience, but I'm not sure we will return for the price.",5,,

I always wanted to try Alice's Tea Cup, and I'm glad we came when we did (around 6:30pm on a Saturday) because their kichen closes at 7:15, who knew? When we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait, but she would get us seated before the kitchen closed. Within 20 minutes, we were seated. Perfect.We opted for the ""Mad Hatter"" option, which is tea for two and comes with a dessert, cookies, sandwiches, and scones. It didn't seem like it would be much food at first, but WOW were we full, we couldn't finish it all! The teas we got (both were fruity varieties of their white tea options) were delicious, obviously, and the combination of savory sandwiches and sweet scones and desserts was great for a super-sensory meal! Out of the three scones we got, buttermilk, peanut butter butterscotch, and pumpkin, the buttermilk was by far the best one. Keep it simple, people! We had the smoked chicken breast sandwich and the smoked salmon sandwich, both were great. The cookies were fresh and the chocolate mousse was divine. All this for $30 per person!The atmosphere is perfect too. With Alice in Wonderland themes throughout, mismatched tableware, and great service, I'll be back soon!",4,,2

I'm not really a coffee fan, and tea has just enough caffeine to get me through the day while still being delicious. My friends and I were looking for a place to warm up on a cold and rainy New York day. We were happily surprised when we saw this tea place close by. Location is everything! We had a little bit of a wait to be seated, but I enjoyed the overall look of the place. Alice in wonderland was right, it was adorably decorated. Once we were seated we looked over all the prices and order a couple pots of tea for the group of us. We decided again any of the food except for the soup because it wasn't too expensive and we weren't looking to be high ballers.The food was alright, I've had better chicken noodle soup before. I was happy with our selection of tea and quickly finished it before we headed off on our way, Mission accomplished. Though a bit pricey it was a good place to warm up and rest our feet.",,,

He's been wanting to try vegan high tea and I've never been to one, so off we go and without reservations. When we arrived, we were told there was an hour wait, hmmm no surprises there, thanks Obama. To be honest, I'm like the rabbit in the story, always running from time! (Side note: if you ever need me in court I'll be there in a double). After perusing the shops nearby we were promptly called on his cell and made our way back. Our table, albeit cute, was tiny! Perfect for me, but not so much for my dining partner. Okay I lied, I eat more than him and too add I'm very clumsy so I was a bit apprehensive when we were seated.We opted to get high tea for two, aka the mad hatter, two choices of brewed teas, two types of dainty vegan sandwiches, scones with berry jam, and desserts.  We informed our server that we were vegan, obviously because we didn't want any cheese or dairy on the sandwiches (although bragging rights are always a given). The desserts i.e. cakes were out of the equation, they substitute extra vegan scones & to our surprise a plate of fresh berries with oranges which we gladly accepted. The servers were swift, and before you know it filled our tables with delectable treats. The room was filled with chatter, but all I heard was my heart flutter. Was it the white champagne tea, the sweet scones, or the hand holding that had me so delighted! This afternoon couldn't have been any better. Thank you Alice for our lil escape into wonderland.",13,7,11

Updated review","I used to love coming here but ever since they changed the menu pricing, it has just felt like a complete rip off. I used to recommend it to people coming from out of town but I can no longer do so. This place is more of a gimmick for girls who want the tea part experience, but the food is unfortunately not great, not as how I remembered it a few years back.",,,

They really know how to make it crispy outside and soft inside. overwhelmed by the flavor as well as the smell chorused by flour and butter. The spread, cream and jam matched perfectly that just made everything from good to excellent.",,,
116,Drew W.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",56,9,0,2.0,5/27/2018,"We went to Alice's hoping for authentic English tea.  They offer a choice of tea sandwiches or eggs and potatoes, to go with the scones and tea service. We chose the eggs, it is simply plain scrambled eggs with no flavor or presentation. Bad start, but the scones are extremely legit.  There are several flavors to choose from,  and they are all delicious.  There is a pumpkin scone that is excellent. Yogurt and granola were OK, and tea was nicely presented and had a good assortment of flavors.",,,
117,Jennifer C.,"Hawthorne, NJ",0,1,0,2.0,9/17/2018,"Came here for tea & brunch with my Mom.  I saw all of the good reviews & thought I would give it a try.  Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations.  You can tell that the owner truly does not want to put a single dollar into the business.  Everything looks old & tired.  All of the tea cups & dishes look like they were purchased from either a dollar store or a Salvation Army store.  Nothing matched - and I mean literally nothing.  There are no pretty tea cups here.  (I mean, it is a tea room)  All of the cups and saucers just thrown together.  The same goes for the plates, both mine and my Mom's had a chip on them.  The tables are very worn and so are the chairs.  My Mom had the scone benedict & I had the ham & gruyere sandwich.  Both were good.  However, the benedict does not have ham on it.  They serve it over a ham & cheese scone, so I guess that is supposed to take the place of the ham.  She asked for extra hollandaise & the waitress said it would be $1.50 extra.  Really??  At these prices, that's ridiculous.  The benedict is $21 and the sandwich is $19.  Also, FYI - the tip is included in the price.  I also had a pot of tea & scones.  The scones were good, but the tea was just ok.  I asked for the vanilla black tea.  I could not taste any vanilla at all.  I have been to 3 other tea rooms & all of them were better then this one.  We will not be coming back.",1,,

Do not subject your children to this terribly managed staff, and if you don't believe me read the rest of The reviews which note the terrible service.

122,Kat V.,"Seattle, WA",32,212,124,2.0,12/16/2016,"As someone who regularly indulges in afternoon tea (including several times in Britain), I was massively disappointed in the afternoon tea package here!My friend and I ordered the Afternoon Tea for 2 ($60 with scones, sandwiches, cookies & a dessert). First off, the teas themselves were fine. However, the food was subpar. My favorite part of English tea time is the scones. Their buttermilk scone is nothing more than an American biscuit. At least, that's what it tastes like. It wasn't sweet like a scone is supposed to be, so putting preserves on it tastes odd. I had to ask for a different scone and luckily their mixed berry scone was much better. Now on to the sandwiches: yes, we didn't order cucumber sandwiches but instead got the curry sandwich and Black Forest ham and cheese. Not only did both fall flat in terms of flavor, the slices were cut way too big and the bread was HARD. Tea sandwiches are supposed to be small and served with soft bread. Lastly, the pitiful dessert. Throw a few cheap (& hard as rocks) cookies on the plate and give us a fruit tart that's clearly meant for 1 person not 2, making it so difficult to split we didn't even eat it, and there you have dessert. I've had much better afternoon tea in California, which surprises me since NYC is closer to England; one would think they're more likely to get it right. Not to mention this is one of the biggest cities in the country. It's not like an attempt at tea time from Alabama or something!Parting with $60 for the worst afternoon tea I've experienced up to date was painful. At least we got 4 large pots of tea out of it.",2,,
123,Jane H.,"New York, NY",285,51,213,4.0,1/3/2017,"Just like what the name of the place may imply, this magical and whimsical tea place offers fun experience for children and adults alike. Children!! Make sure you get spray of sprinkle dusts on your head with wings/ other fairy decorations :)I went to this place for afternoon tea after having a huge lunch - so I couldn't try the huge madhatter's tea set but would love to try it once in the future. Came inside the tea place at 1PM on Thursday but had to wait for around 20 minutes for a seat. The wait seemed short because there were so many things to ponder at. Delicious display of cakes and pastries along with Wonderland decorations made the time fly by quickly. My friend and I ordered two scones with two pots of tea (+chili soup). Pumpkin Scone: if you like pumpkin and caramel, you will love it period. Buttermilk Scone: I personally found more favor towards this classic biscuit-like scone. Creamed butter and jam all the more elevated the taste for sure. I generally like having an Early Grey for the afternoon teas (floral black tea makes my afternoon happy)Will definitely comeback to try other pastries, cakes, and sandwiches, (+more!)",1,,
124,C P.,"Edgewater, NJ",1,73,12,4.0,4/2/2018,This place is fun! I love their tea options and the scones are to die for. Minus one star because this location is very busy and only has one bathroom (which is always a struggle). Be aware that there is usually a wait on the weekends!,,,
125,Liz M.,"Irvine, CA",102,5,24,4.0,4/20/2018,"This is a cute & quirky place to grab lunch or brunch, or even scones on the go. They have a wide array of tea options and delicious food (scones with clotted cream - so good!) that could appeal to everyone. The price seems pretty fair considering they include gratuity on your bill. I went here with a friend for lunch on a weekday, so I can't speak to how busy it gets on the weekend. They can host private events here as there was some kind of party going on, possibly a bridal shower, in a room in the back. It also seems kid friendly, as I saw a few families with children enjoying the playful decor and tasty food (they have a ""Menu for the Small,"" too). There's a quirky vibe to the decor (based around Alice in Wonderland), and a kind of witchy vibe to some of the items for sale in the shop in the front. It is a small space and the service was just a little slow. There seemed to be just one server for the whole dining room (plus the private event), but he was kind and attentive to my friend and me. All in all it was a very pleasant experience.",,,

127,Robin B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,5,2,1.0,3/20/2018,Full disclosure: did not eat here. Had 9 am reservation for my daughter's 9th birthday. Showed up and was told they were not open yet (although they opened at 8) because the server was not in. Ok. We waited. A woman came in to get scones to go. Was turned away because they wouldn't be ready for another 30 minutes or so. A second woman came in and ordered a tea to go and was told that the cash drawer was being counted and it would be another five minutes. Both of these women left empty handed. We left too. This place is not cheap and I had gotten a clear picture of how much they value their customers' patronage. Who runs a business like this? Why serve breakfast if you can't be open that early? My daughter and I were excited for this experience and left feeling disappointed. We walked a block to Levain Bakery and got two pastries and two hot drinks for $14.,,,
128,Hattie S.,"West Hollywood, CA",615,12,47,4.0,3/8/2018,"I arrived starving, and left more than satiated. I enjoyed a green tea/chai blend which was delicious (and I'm a coffee girl...so that's saying a lot). In addition to tea, my guests and I enjoyed the ham and cheese, pear and cinnamon (vegan), and black & white chocolate scones. The scones are really what hit it out of the park for us. They seem to be made with LOVE. Can't say I'm surprised as this destination caters to ""tea time"". Based on recommendation, we also went ahead and ordered the chicken curry salad sandwich and the tuna melt. Unfortunately, my favorite part of lunch was the side salad (really fresh greens w/delicious dressing). The sandwiches were nothing to write home about. This is a place where you most definitely pay for the experience so pricey items are to be expected, however, we could have done without the over priced sandwiches. They were also messy and difficult to eat. If and when I return, I will try ""Alice's afternoon tea Service"" which includes tea, scones, finger sandwiches, and dessert. At first glance the tea services seem pricey, but by the end of my meal I realized they would have been worth the price and would've offered more variety. Overall, a very fun afternoon tea party.

They sprinkle you with magic fairy dust, then you choose a pair of wings and a costume to wear! It's all things magical and sparkly! Oh, and of course, all things Alice!There is an entire menu of just TEA!! A whole book! You name it....green, blacks, whites, reds, oolong. All different kinds, separated by variety and boldness, hundreds of them! It's really quite fabulous! I'm a huge tea drinker myself and it is just heavenly. They bring you the sweetest little tea pot to share- $8 gets about 3 cups. They have yummy salads, soups and traditional finger sammies. I'm a fan of the warm lentil salad and veggie Sammy sans cheese for lunch! They also serve breakfast goodies... pancakes, waffles, salmon, omelettes, granola, fresh fruit and make your own crepes to name a few! How fun!  They also have a to die for dessert list! Scones served with house made preserves and clotted cream and towering pieces of cake big enough for 2-3 people. Cookies and cupcakes too! You can order a la carte or select one of their pre-made tea towers ranging from $35-$100 depending on size. This may be a good option for a larger group. Children's menu is also available. I may or may not have come here by myself once for tea and sweets! ((Covers eyes)) Oh, and did I mention they have VEGAN scones! Prices are what you would expect in NYC. Service is hit or miss. Parking is rough but I'm sure that's not an issue for most. They host parties which I believe is 6 or more guests required for a private room. This is one of 3 Chapters and by far my favorite. It's located near Central Park which can make for a full day of fun! They have really neat themed goods in the front of store for purchase as well as loose tea! If you're a tea lover, definitely take some home to go! They sell tins to ensure freshness. My girls and I just love afternoon tea at Alice's. If you can sneak in on a weekday, at an off time, it will be the least crowded. I recommend reservations!",4,2,4
130,Cailin C.,"Elmhurst, NY",20,84,90,4.0,10/16/2016,"I loved my time at this chapter!I came on a late Saturday afternoon and asked for a table for 3. Since they won't seat you until your party is present, I just waited at the front until my friends came. Once they did, we were seated in a private area towards the front of the restaurant. And because we were starving, we opted for the Jabberwocky ($100/2 people, +$30/add'l person, max 5 people total) which included:- 3 large pots of tea (the 6-cup pot - also a tongue twister I kept messing up)- unlimited sandwiches (but start with 3 because of the way they cut it, only 3 fits on a plate per their presentation)- unlimited scones (but start with 3 because per their presentation, only 3 fit on a plate)- assorted cookies, chocolate mousse, and a  slice of a mocha chocolate chip cakeTea:- skip the last page of the menu re: herbal teas, etc... I had a Hawaiian Paradise. It was so gross. I tried to drink a cup and a half, and  couldn't make it past that, so I opted for a Moroccan mint - which was way better- so it's supposed to be 3 large pots (6 cup pot), but it ended up just being 1 large pot and 2 small pots (3 cup pot) - I mean, I was full at the end of my meal, but I was confused why they didn't give 3 large pots like their menu said it would...I know by the photos the sandwiches look small (they cut them by thirds it seems), but they are thick sandwiches. It's ridiculous(ly good!) Great sandwiches:- Lapsang soudhong smoked chicken breast- Smoked salmon- Chopped tea-egg salad- Curried chicken saladSkip out on the rest of them.Scones: honestly, they weren't that great. They're huge, but were too hard by the time we got around to eating them. They had a variety of scones, but since they change on a daily basis, you never know which ones you're going to get until you sit down (except for the buttermilk - that's a staple!).- Goat cheese & basil: my friends said there was barely any goat cheese- Raspberry with cream cheese - apparently this was good, but I didn't try itAssorted cookies (third tier) - skip out on this one, too. Compared to the first two tiers, this one was pretty basic.Since my friends and I about about 7 one-thirds of sandwiches each (2 full sandwiches and a third), and stuffed ourselves with tea, we were pretty full. The bill came out to about $148 - $50/person, we thought it was a good deal for our first time.Great service - the busboy looked irritated when I told him that I was still working on a sandwich...little did I know that they closed at 8:00pm and we stayed til 8:40pm! So apologies on our end for overstaying our welcome, but thank you for not being rude or obnoxious to us regarding the closing time!Cailin's Recommendations:- Order the tier for your Instagram- For 3 people, I think upgrading the Mad Hatter to 3 tea pots should be just fine ($24/person!) -- if I come back, I would definitely do this option",3,,

Now their scones - definitely in a class of it's own. Had the pumpkin, vegan s'more, and regular buttermilk scones.

134,Cassie A.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,0,1.0,7/22/2018,"The scones are great, but the service was horrible. Having grown up in the commonwealth, I was so excited to find a place for tea and British-style scones in my neighbourhood and I have bought scones to-go from there before. However, I have visitors in town and recently made the mistake of sitting down there. Despite the cute setting, the service was inexcusably bad. Firstly, the entire point of tea AND scones, is to have them together - they brought out the scones 10 minutes before the tea, and only brought out the tea after we asked about it, by which time the scones were long cold. When they finally brought the tea, they did not bring the milk we asked for when ordering and the tea was so weak it was undrinkable, and had to be sent back. There were 5 servers running around for just ~15 tables and we had to wave down and literally grab whoever was running past to ask for anything. Our original sever never voluntarily came back to check on us after taking the order and all but one (the one who can sing) seemed to know anything about customer service -  everyone else we interacted with scowled at us for requesting basic service. With all this I didn't even bother to complain about the hair I found baked into my pumpkin scone. This is 'no-tip' place, which I generally think is a good idea, but now I think that is just a formula for extremely bad service. Since there is no way to express my disapproval with a low tip, all I can do is take to yelp.",,,
135,Jane B.,"Buffalo, NY",268,397,4840,5.0,9/7/2015,"My Sunday brunch at Alice's Tea Cup was a magical fairy tale experience. Everything was perfect. The tea, the food, the whimsical decor and the friendly employees all helped make our experience very memorable. My mom and I split the Mad Hatter (choice of two pots of tea, three scones, two sandwiches and one dessert).  It was the perfect amount of food and it was displayed so beautifully!  Although it was difficult to choose from the many options, we decided on a pumpkin scone, a ham & cheese scone, and a classic buttermilk scone.  They were served with butter and jam.  Although we loved all of them, the classic scone was our favorite!  We also chose the Albacore Tuna sandwich on whole grain and a grilled chicken sandwich with goat cheese and Granny Smith apple slices.  Both sandwiches were fresh and delicious!  Lastly, we chose the chocolate mousse as our dessert.  It was divine! In addition to the great food, the people who work at Alice's Tea Cup certainly add to the enjoyable experience!  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a very nice woman named Magan. We also spoke with Blaine, JP, and Brian. All of them were so cheerful!  Despite the estimated one-hour wait, Magan seated us right away with a smile. Our server, KC, was very sweet and attentive! I was a bit overwhelmed by the several menu pages of different flavors of tea. KC recommended ""Alice's Tea,"" which is Indian black tea, Japanese green tea, vanilla and rose petals.  It was so good!  I was drinking it straight, but KC insisted that I try it with a splash of cream and a drizzle of honey.  The combination was amazing!The restaurant itself is so cute!  There are several Alice in Wonderland-themed decorations in the lobby and dining room.  The walls are covered in hand painted quotes from the book.  The tea cups and saucers are all hand picked from antique shops and garage sales.  It's definitely a must-visit in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  It was an especially great place to take my mom.  We were both so happy throughout our entire ""tea party.""  I can't wait to return!",4,,2

A lovely place filled with Alice's adventures in Wonderland motifs. The pumpkin with caramel sauce scone was too muffin like for me to consider it a scone, although the blueberry Apple was perfect with a mixture of dry and soft texture topped with sugar. For the main course, I ordered the salmon egg Benedict on top of a buttermilk scone along with fresh greens.

I'm like upset at the audacity they have to call them scones. Cookies taste like they came out of a box. Not even Costco box cookie quality. Very rarely am I upset that I spent so much money on such bad food but this was one of those occasions.

140,Alex C.,"ALLSTON, MA",0,3,0,5.0,5/29/2017,"I have had afternoon tea in a lot of places in New York and Boston, but Alice's Tea Cup is surely among my favorites.  One time I got the Jabberwocky with my girlfriend and I ate 2 full plates of sandwiches, scones, and desserts excessively.  I could barely move for the rest of the day and skipped out on dinner that night.  The Mad Hatter would more than suffice for 2!  The sandwiches are tasty, large, and fresh - the black forest ham and gruyere and the curried chicken salad are my favorites.  The best part, however, are the scones. The fact that they are served warm makes all the difference and sets them about the scones at other places where they are served cold, dry, and without passion.  Quite the opposite at Alice's, as the scones are one of my favorite parts of the experience!  Also, the Trafalgar Square tea is a good choice for people who like or think they would like mint flavored black tea.  I like how you can really taste the mint without it overpowering the overall taste of tea.  The Monk's Blend is also a good, but less obvious choice for black tea.  The flavors of this particular tea really complement the delicious flavors of the chocolate cake.",1,,
141,Elena F.,"Anchorage, AK",56,80,395,4.0,8/26/2016,"Alice's Tea Cup was one of the first tea service spots I frequented when I first moved to NYC three years ago.  The morning after I arrived, I had breakfast here. Their variety of tea's are delicious. Depending on the type of tea service you choose, you get a variety of different sandwiches, tea cakes, and large scones. Their scones, tea, & sandwiches are among the best in the city. You can choose either a tea service for one, two, or a group. The tea for one may not look like a lot of food on the surface--at least it didn't look like it at first in my opinion, but it. is. filling. Their open faced Smoked Salmon sandwich is delicious, but is very over priced. They should spice it up a little with more fish, and some capers perhaps? It's been two years since I was last in the city, so this may have changed. I know how expensive smoked salmon can be, depending on the kind. It's really expensive in my hometown of Anchorage, Alaska...but might be a little bit cheaper in NYC? Something worth looking into. Alice's Tea Cup, like most tea houses, has their own unique variety of loose leaf tea. In my humble opinion, they have the best selection of Rooibos teas in NYC! Their Rooibos Wedding Chai is my personal favorite! I haven't seen it on the current menu's, so I hope they still have it. I will buy more if they do! The staff is very accommodating, and does the absolute best that they can, given how super busy it is on any given day. Speaking of which, there is a waiting list, so I would highly recommend calling to make reservations a couple of hours before you plan to have breakfast, lunch, or tea service here. Alice's is a very kid friendly place, especially if you'd like to set up a birthday party for your daughter or son. They do this really cute routine where they let the kids wear the fairy wings and have them make a wish, giving them glitter, if I recall correctly. All in all, I love Alice's Tea Cup! I highly recommend them, but they are overpriced. If you're new to the city and love tea, I definitely recommend this as a first stop, especially if you want a fancy breakfast.",2,,1

I ordered the ""Mad Morning Tea"", same thing as last time. We were told that the poached eggs could not be switched out on weekends. Three poached eggs tasting like vinegar and overcooked were served solo. Last time I was able choose how the eggs were done and picked sunny side up, which I don't mind eating alone. If you even had a scrambled or hard boiled option that would be better than poached. The scone and jam portion was still delicious so definitely happy about that. Granola had become soft, but the fruit on top was very fresh. I thought it was strange that this place didn't have the crowd that it did before, but thought we had gotten lucky. Guess not.

The tea was great. They have  a LARGE variety of tea flavors and the ones we did try were so good. You can't really mess up tea. The tea sets themselves were very cute and the whole place was nicely decorated and had a very cool theme throughout. The scones were pretty okay. It came with spreads and they were all tasty. The problem came with the sandwiches and the desserts. Since we got the unlimited, we were excited to try all the sandwich flavors. The big factor that ruined all the sandwiches was the bread. The bread was a hard, thick, and just gross. There were different kinds but they all had that same hard and dense texture like that of a bad fruitcake. The insides of the sandwiches weren't that good either. The desserts were even more lackluster. There was a chocolate pudding reminiscent of school lunch pudding and the cakes and the cookies were very dry. If we had known the sandwiches and the desserts weren't good we wouldn't have paid for the unlimited and just had the scones and tea. Overall, the place is super overpriced, but you're paying for the theme and the cute tea sets. I would not come again.",3,1,

From the moment we entered we were greeted by a rude server who was unhappy by our small order and did everything in her power to try and get us to order more and when that failed rushed us into leaving. We were there for less than an hour when they came up to us and asked us if we were still using our tea pots because they were running out of tea pots.

And it isn't just princesses who dine here, there's a great mix of old and young and lots of dutiful men who accompany their lovely ladies here. So you most likely won't feel out of place :)I ordered a birthday tea because I heard it was awesome (and it was just my birthday a couple days before, so you know). I asked the waiter if I could have iced tea and he gladly accommodated my request even though that option wasn't on the menu. The tea was wonderful and I had enough for at least three cup refills. For breakfast/brunch I ordered the salmon Benedict, which came with asparagus and poached pears. It was heavenly. The salmon Benedict was one of the best I've ever had and just melted in my mouth because it was sitting atop their buttermilk scone. I think the scone really made the dish perfect. I also got a pumpkin scone with caramel icing to go because obviously I had to!! It was absolutely delicious. Since the place is so popular, I got a bit of a feeling of needing to leave so my table could be cleared for the next patrons, but other than that, I had a really great experience. The price was basically what I expected for a place like this, although it's higher than what I would pay for brunch on a regular basis.

An establishment would want to keep its appearance welcoming. It doesn't. Music should liven up the atmosphere. There isn't any. So what is one to expect here? From experience: getting seated first but the server will attend everyone else before you. Water comes with piece of floating organism which you ask for a replacement, only to be dying of thirst and giving up hope that your server will return with another glass of h2o. And last but certainly not the least, palate offending food. Paltry with a horrible selection of sweets as part of their three-tier offering such as The Madhatter. I can easily make and present a better Madhatter than this joint. Heck, Keebler's bag of cookies taste far better than these sorry sack of sweets!Trust me on this, don't do it!",3,,

Their tea is extensive and can be bought loosely to take home with you (and so can the scones). I had one of their Earl Greys and loved it. I regret not buying some to take home with me as I will have to wait until our next trip to get some. Reservations were easily made through email and our group of four was able to call and bump them up a couple of hours when we realized we were hungry after walking through Central Park. My only note - our server wasn't the friendliest. The two men working were fantastic. The woman that served us took a long time to return to us when we needed things like sugar and milk or another scone. Will be back!,,,

Ordered a small pot of their Alice's Faerie Potion tea blend, which is about 3 cups worth, to enjoy. The tea itself was nice but I'd like to come back to try their food, especially since I've heard they offer brunch. Not necessarily a place I'd go alone again but good or 2+ or larger groups. I think a large tea party with a set of cucumber sandwiches and other savory or sweet treats would be a nice way to celebrate a birthday or special occasion. Prices were a little more than I usually like to pay but not unreasonable. As I was leaving, I saw three young girls at the front of the store talking with the staff. They were told to close their eyes and make a wish during which the staff member sprinkled a little bit of ""fairy dust"" (AKA fine glitter) over the girls.

I'd get the ham and cheese scone eggs benedict. The potatoes with the chicken are SO good. I mean, I don't eat chicken anymore OR live in NY anymore BUT when I think fondly of my time in NYC or am missing anything it's either this breakfast or Barney Greengrass.Another favorite is doing the tea and scones. So delish! I love the clotted cream and preserves. None of the tea places in Hawaii give clotted cream, what's the deal with that.

The ambiance, the drawings on the walls, extra cuteness all over makes this place a great choice for a kid's birthday party or if your significant other is in the mood of ""oh soo cute"". I come here frequently for the second reason. The chicken in the potato hash is always unbearably dry, the potato is sometimes too mushy, sometimes bone dry, scones are good but not as delicate as the ones you would get at Kensington Palace Gardens. The hollandaise sauce on the egg benedict is pretty delicious, and my other half likes the crepes a lot. So I could have given them a 3 star for the food, and may be another half star for the extra cuteness. But the service makes the food extra un-tasty, keep reading.Service:The slowest service in town, period. It takes 10 mins to serve a glass of tap water (pace your water well, they forget to refill), another 10 minutes to get the order, and usually you have to wait for another 20 minutes for them to serve a damn egg. Don't be fooled by heavy staff traffic. They constantly move around with little real service for customers. I really wonder what they do behind these kitchen doors at the back (they get in, stay there for more than a few minutes, and come out empty handed most of the time)It took about an hour for me to take a bite today, and the poached egg on my scone was kind of hard boiled, see the pic below.

They served w a berry jam and cream- good, but would have been great w clotted cream and curd. The veg sandwiches were ok- needed a little bit more seasoning- the red pepper hummus was good w watercress. The cucumber cress was a little bland and I think having the herbed  butter spread on both sides would have fixed this.

Their scones are absolutely delicious. I especially liked their White chocolate Strawberry scone. It gets crowded and loud at times but the servers are very friendly and service is generally good.It's a great place to meet up with friends and playdates for kids. My only big complaint will be that there's only one bathroom. When this place gets packed, someone is always waiting to use the bathroom.",,,
172,Lilian Y.,"Sunnyside, NY",168,180,34,4.0,8/27/2017,"This place is cute. I went here on Mother's Day with my 3 year old and we both enjoyed our time there but they sat us at the table by the bathroom in what felt like the hallway. The meal was expensive. I think if this place really tried to make the experience for each guests it would take it to the very top. I feel like the server was tired and the hostess was a little clueless it seemed that there were a lot of disconnects with staff. If they trained their staff to deliver that ""magical"" experience it would really make this spot amazing. I would not go back unless with a bigger group. I hate their two seat tables, all of them are pretty bad.",,,

We got there at 5 so I can't give the most accurate account since we missed brunch. We wanted eggs Benedict but ended up with egg and salmon finger sandwiches. They weren't bad, the weren't great. The tea and scones were amazing! I got buttermilk and my friend got the berry one, both could substitute as their own meals they're so big! I got a pot of this amazing black tea, I think the name was Mauritius, my best friend got a pot of the African Dew, also a black tea--we were in heaven! The hostess was so pleasant and looked like a Disney character. The server was also pleasant. Overall great experience, I just deducted two stars bc I didn't get what I went for (all things considered, I did arrive for brunch at 5pm)",,,

I would recommend coming here for tea and scones which were fantastic.,,,

Because of that, keep in mind how small it is and how long the wait will be (waited for an hour)!The menu is ridiculously expensive for what it is worth. The price that Alice's Tea Cup charged would have made sense had the food been extraordinarily good, but it wasn't. My friend and I got the Mad Morning Tea Brunch off the menu. The poaches egg were just like any other eggs, the granola for the yogurt was stale and soggy, the yogurt wasn't very good either, and the scone were dry. Definitely a cute place for a date or just to grab tea for hours (since a pot is so expensive). Would not come here for food.",1,,

You can choose from the kiddie favorite Fruity teas, white teas, herbal teas ...there is a whole booklet of teas to choose from. Must have their scones and clotted cream! And the banana Nutella cake.

The server behind the counter handed me a menu and let me know that all the teas in it could be served to go, as well as the prices for a small or large tea. I got a large Phoenix Dessert tea and a blackberry scone, which came to $7.50. The tea was served hot but not scalding, and the flavor was great. The scone was moist but not sticky, crumbly, and awesome. Super cute location with fast and courteous service!",,,

The decor was eclectic and quaint with mismatched tea cups and tea pots. My friend and I were craving brunch and this was the perfect place for that. We each ordered a small pot of tea and a scone each. She opted for the espresso scone, and I went with the blackberry lemon scone which we both loved. We also ordered a salmon benedict and a ham and cheese scone benedict. We both enjoyed our meals and left very full. The staff was also pretty casual and chill, and was happy to help us when we had questions about the tea selection. Over all, we had a very pleasant experience.",1,,1

The place is small but very charming. We had the Mad Hatter's Tea for 2 and it was too much food for 2 of us. I wish we would have just ordered the scones since the sandwiches we had weren't amazing. The scones were phenomenal though. The house tea blend was very good too. Overall, would definitely return.",1,,
181,Victoria W.,"San Francisco, CA",20,66,186,4.0,4/9/2015,"My friend had yelp searched this place up one night, but it was closed before we could go, so I came back during daytime hours on my own before hopping on the amtrak back home. Coming from around DC, it's nice to be able to have a nice place to sit down and enjoy tea and read something (there's a serious lack of cafes around my area). I had Alice's Tea, a special house blend that is uniquely fragrant but not overly strong for a mix of rose, green, and black tea. The blend is cafe's signature tea, and it was absolutely amazing with a bit of honey and a dash of milk!Atmosphere was a bit loud, but I assume it was because of the handful of kids that were in the cafe, but hey, at least that means the cafe is kid friendly! Definitely a nice place to enjoy some afternoon tea with a group of friends. The cafe definitely had a whimsical Alice in Wonderland theme from the teapots and cups served, to the store decoration, etc. Definitely a fun little cafe find on a quaint side street and a girl or child's little teatime haven.Minus one star because the cashier out front for take out was a bit awkward and brisk when I was asking questions and a bit confused about ordering (he thought I wanted take out) and because the service was a bit slow. The server kept forgetting to get my order out, so I waited 30 minutes for my tea to come and another 5-10 minutes after the tea to get my scones in a to-go box to bring home. Even still, the server was very nice and friendly, she definitely tried to make up for the long wait time/forgetting my orders!",,,

It has a limited menu because the main focus is really serving tea and scones. There is a wide selection of tea from which to choose which you can have either hot or cold. They also have a daily selection of scones.One issue is that they do not supply enough jam and cream for the size and number scones that they give you.  I had a smoked salmon sandwich that was good and the accompanying salad was fresh, well-dressed, and very good.  I opted to have my tea iced and it was also very good.I give this place points because I left my phone on the table, and it was there when I returned 5 minutes later.  The hostess had it waiting for me behind the front desk no questions asked.  I was very relieved.All in all, it is a nice place for a small and quick bite.  It is easy to see why they have several locations throughout the city.  Service was also very efficient and personable.",10,4,8

I'd been planning to visit a chapter of Alice's Tea Cup and my sister had been to Chapter II before. To be honest, I thought it would be a bit more themed and was really surprised when my sister said it was more decorated than Chapter II, but I ended up really enjoying the balance between tearoom and Wonderland that they have. We got a shared pot of Alice's Organic Breakfast Blend and got about 5-6 teacups out of it. It was a nice light breakfast tea, great as is or with a little milk & sugar. I ordered the Mixed Berry Crepes which were delicious! The drizzle of creme anglaise over the top and cream on the sides were lovely additions. My sister ordered the yogurt with fruit and Alice's Famous Granola which was AMAZING (I know because I took some)!!! It's probably got an ungodly amount of honey in it, but the taste made me forget all about that. Finally, to finish up our brunch extravaganza, we got 2 scones: pesto Parmesan served with whipped butter and pumpkin with a caramel glaze, served with raspberry compote and two little dollops of cream. Both were respectively the perfect savory and sweet treats to enjoy with our tea! Overall a great experience with a yummy spread and a super friendly server. (Thanks Jenyth!)",,,

Yet this place succeeded in even making me write a negative comment. I had the worst crepe in my entire life, it was the most expensive one too. They had deli turkey slices, with no sauce and very bad tomatoes in it. The crepe itself was no more crepe than a kebab wrap for goodness sake how can you even name that a crepe?? Good thing i lived in europe for long years to know this place has no clue about crepes. Not to add that the coffee they gave also fits to the criteria i described for the crepe; expensive and lowest quality. They usually have long waiting lines for seating which makes you think okay this place must have the minerals. But no, honestly the only minerals they have is the most overpriced meals with horrendous quality.. absolutely disappointed.",,,

191,Allison B.,"Westwood, NJ",386,220,452,5.0,11/9/2014,"I'm such a sucker for little tea houses like this (especially those with mismatched cups and saucers), and Alice's is one of the cutest I've ever been to. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 45 minute wait, which is par for the course when you don't have a reservation. It's a great neighborhood to walk around, and they take your phone number when you put your name down so they can let you know when your table is available, which is very convenient. The clotted cream and raspberry preserves to accompany the scones are fantastic - I had the pumpkin caramel scone, which was the special of the day, and it was absolutely delicious. They also offer vegan scones, which I think is pretty fantastic - I'm always a fan when somewhere appeals to all dietary restrictions. The afternoon tea service prices are pretty fantastic if you plan on ordering a bunch of things, though we decided to just order a la carte (maybe next time!). For lunch, I had the grilled veggie melt, which was fantastic. The pesto was a great addition to the grilled cheese with tomato (though full disclosure, I'm an enormous pesto fan, so I may be a bit biased). Bf ordered the croque monsieur, which he said was fantastic, and was impressed that the raisin bread worked so well with it. Dessert was an ambitious choice after scones and sandwiches, but I still went for the assorted cookie plate, which came with a shit ton of various cookies (a coconut cookie, chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and another that I can't remember because they are long gone). Bf ordered the warm chocolate cake, which was delicious. The tea list is massive - there's something for everyone (and they do have coffee if someone absolutely won't budge). I had the organic ginger orange peach tea, which was good, and was a solid accompaniment for my billions of cookies. The staff was friendly and unobtrusive, but on top of refilling waters, clearing things away, etc., which I see as a positive. Everyone we encountered was efficient and very personable. The prices are very reasonable, the place is adorable, and the staff is friendly. You can also buy cakes, cookies, scones, and tea to-go, which is an added plus!",1,,
192,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,4.0,9/23/2015,"This is a grandmother's house - everything feels lived-in, the stairs to the second floor creak as you're going up, and a good chunk of the place is covered in Alice-themed memorabilia. And butterfly wings. I remember the hookah-puffing caterpillar played a much bigger role in the story than the subsequent butterfly, but I guess it wouldn't be very kid-friendly to stick some hookahs in every nook and cranny. My friend and I split the Madhatter for two. At $48, it came out to a lot more food than we needed for one meal. I have no idea how hungry I would need to be in order to go for the Jabberwocky (unlimited scones and sandwiches), because the scones pack a punch. I thought I would like the caramel-glazed pumpkin the best, but I think I've played the role of vegetarian turncoat a little too well ... the ham and cheese scone was the clear winner. It's the best when it comes right out of the oven, but the subsequent toasted version was also excellent. Liked the raisin semolina that the chicken curry sandwich came on. I was stuffed with bread at this point, but I managed to eat enough of the chocolate mousse cake to make it a little less presentable as a gift to my boyfriend. Our waitress was the cheeriest person I have ever met.

It's true that the place is girly and cute (which makes it perfect for dates with girlfriends), but the poor customer service really kills the experience. There was one time when I brought my friend here for her birthday. Since it was a small group, we weren't able to make reservations. We got here a little before 10am and was told that the wait would be no longer than an hour. That was fine since we had already been mentally prepared for the wait. However, by 11:30am there was still one table ahead of us. My friend was really hoping to order from their breakfast menu (which ends at 11:30am) and so we explained our situation to the receptionist and asked whether it was possible for us to place our order before getting seated. She was rude and literally snapped at us, saying that would be a complete inconvenience to the kitchen and that there was no way they could accommodate us. I was so taken back by her attitude, especially since she was the exact person who told us that we would definitely be seated within the hour. If we had known that the wait would be so long, we would have gone elsewhere. By then, breakfast was over pretty much everywhere.We eventually got seated and my friend and I shared the Mad Hatter tea for two. There's a good variety of scones (which varies daily) and sandwiches you can choose from. The tea selection is also very impressive.

Let's begin with the tea, they have a plethora of choices for anyone who likes tea (even if you don't like tea, something will entice you!) The scones and jam were fantastic- I had the Ham &a Cheese and Pumpkin scone. We also ordered black bean soup which was very tasty and a curry chicken sandwich which was a bit bland. Overall everything was pleasant, but I'd just go for the tea and scones next time. Now the service, be prepared to wait to get seated. The wait time isn't really the issue for me - my issue was when my server came to collect my check. It literally took 15 minutes in total to ask for the bill, collect and return. Usually, when you have lots of people waiting to be seated, you should collect ASAP. That ticked me off because I had someone picking me up so they had to wait the entire time.",,,
