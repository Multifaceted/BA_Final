You won't be disappointed, unless you have a stroller because they're not allowed inside. The carbs make up for it though!",,,
1,Dee O.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,13,0,4.0,11/12/2018,"PROS: Delicious brunch food! Really enjoyed the biscuits as well as the Denver omelette. Tried a bit of my friends pancakes too and they were absolutely amazing. Also appreciated the music that was playing during brunch - me and my friends were vibing.CONS: Super crowded! Seating was definitely right, and the cue upon entry was full of folks as well. Just a testament to how good the food is though, everyone was clamoring for a table. I would highly recommend!",,,1
2,Julia P.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,42,182,4.0,10/29/2018,"Reservations are a must must here! There were so many people waiting for lunch on a Friday and luckily I was able to walk in and sit right away! I made the reservation through Yelp, which made it super easy!The food is quite good - highlights are the fried chicken, biscuits, and the tasting flight of pancakes. The PIE is even better!! I had the seasonal pumpkin and it actually tasted of real pumpkin, rather than just cinnamon and spice. My friend had the apple and was a big fan of the double crust. Looses a star for the very loud and seemingly out of place music. And pleasant yet indifferent service.",1,1,
3,Kate P.,"Ann Arbor, MI",107,48,29,4.0,10/11/2018,"The atmosphere of the restaurant is like a chic country home. Of course, family friendly. When we arrived there are large green porch type benches out front and nice shrubbery. When we walked inside to the right is a hip little bar, hostess table straight ahead, and open dining to the left.The establishment is clean. Service is immaculate.The menu wasn't too overwhelming. We ordered the Flight Mimosas which were delicious. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a Side Arugula Herb Salad. While my brunch buddy ordered the Chicken & Pancakes and a side of the mac n cheese.The Eggs Benedict wasn't out of the ordinary. I added tomato and avocado, which don't do if you don't want to waste $5.00. It was all a bit bland. The Side Arugula Herb Salad was supposed to be tossed in a lemon vinegeratte, I could barely taste dressing. However the Chicken & Pancakes and the Mac n Cheese are to die for. The Chicken was so moist and while topped on top of the pancakes, did not make them soggy. The Mimosa flight is everything you would expect a mimosa to be. It was just fun trying the different flavors.",1,,
4,Tricia G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,25,9,5.0,10/1/2018,"This is our 2nd visit to Bubbys. We stumbled upon this place a year ago visiting. When we came back to NY, this was on our list to revisit.Again, we were not disappointed. The food is locally sourced, fresh, simple yet delicious!The menu changed a little, which is fine by me. I was still happy to see the huevos rancheros as that was a memorable dish from our 1st visit.We tried the biscuits and gravy and it was to die for. I had the cheese grits, and being from the south...I know grits! These were very flavorful and the best grits I have had in a long time. I got 2 poached eggs to put  on top...everything is better with an egg.The atmosphere is warm,  welcoming and the staff and service is excellence! Even during the crisis when the internet went down and they and to hand write tickets. This will be a must stop everytime in NY for us.",1,,
5,Dhaval T.,"New York, NY",346,63,153,4.0,10/5/2018,Your neighborhood TriBeCa restaurant - family style. We frequent this place during lunch and there is always a wait. Suggest you have a reservation else there might be a 15/20 min wait. This place is frequented by families and is good for children. Their strawberry butter and biscuits are to die for ! The burgers and fries are decent too.,,,
6,Kailie J.,"Flushing, NY",23,65,167,2.0,9/19/2018,"The food is good but our waiter was extremely rude. I at there twice at the bar and the service was AMAZING, so my third visist was far from a charm. I highly recommended to my co-workers and felt so embarrassed by the service the male waiter gave us. The was aggressive and it made our dining experience very uncomfortable.",4,,
7,Rachelle R.,"Tucson, AZ",6,37,46,4.0,7/14/2018,"Bubbys was delish, just didn't have the WOW quality.I will say one thing: the pancakes are amazing here.I can confidently say these were the best pancakes I've had EVER.They are a little in the thicker sideThe batter was slightly sweet. Inside soft and fluffy outside had the smallest crisp to it. Well done to the chef/cook. BravoDrinks were delish. Tons of different types of lemonade. I don't recall if it was freshly squeezed. The chicken was tasty.The breading had amazing flavor. Normally places try to get away with flavorless chicken. This one has a party in your mouth.Oh I don't have a pic of the bacon MAC n cheese, but it's delish!!! Get it. Creamy stretchy and flavorful.",1,,
8,Alex H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1086,188,139,5.0,4/27/2018,"This place was JUMPIN when we came in for Brunch yesterday, so if you are planning on that, Make a reservation for sure.The spot is spacious with a lot of tables, and has a rural charm to it with wooden tables and benches.  The host was accommodating and personable, even with the massive crowds of people, babies, businessmen, and others.I talked with one of the servers and asked what's good, she recommended Chicken and Pancakes.  I love Chicken and Pancakes.Make sure you are super hungry when you get it, because the portion is huge. Make sure not to leave anything over!Besides the massive crowds, which can't be helped, this spot is a great brunch spot around the Tribeca area.",3,,
9,Lex G.,"Denver, CO",9,34,7,2.0,11/12/2018,"This spot was definitely happening. I enjoyed the atmosphere (I like bustling though) and the service was ok. You're not going to get farm-to-table goodness which is what I look for especially in a breakfast/brunch. On the bright side, they do serve fried chicken! I did appreciate bone in fried goodness first thing. The other dish - bacon and eggs was disappointing. Again, if you're thinking farm-to-table, this ain't it. I'm still hopeful for good breakfast in the city, however, the last few places I've tried didn't impress.",,,
10,Kay P.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",35,36,60,4.0,9/18/2018,"Pro's: Delicious, fluffy and SUPER filling pancakes! You can mix and match toppings for a little price! The caramelized banana choc chip pancakes are very rich and fresh in taste. Bacon is also yummy if you like them thick cut and crunchy. Great list of brunch cocktails, with seasonal specials - recommend the watermelon mimosa!! Con's: VERY pricey for a standard brunch plate. Lunch time, obviously gets quite packed, hence we were sandwiched VERY tightly between two other tables.",,,
11,Jesse S.,"Jersey City, NJ",211,109,96,5.0,5/3/2018,"Although I enjoy trying new places, Bubby's keeps me coming back for more. It's like I cannot get enough of the fluffy pancakes, fried chicken and streams of syrup running over it all. My mouth watered just writing about it. It's comfort food all around so your mac n' cheese, biscuits and matzo ball soup are delish. And don't get me started on the pie! The lemon meringue is out of this world. The strawberry rhubarb is bursting with flavor. The dining room can get quite loud. And the servers aren't always the friendliest, but they certainly work to get you what you need. I easily overlook these things for the pancakes. I just wish Bubby would share her recipes!",,,
12,Maddy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",751,48,102,5.0,3/16/2018,"I have to say that this has moved towards the top of the list of favorite places to eat in NY, and especially Tribecca!  I had a great time, I went with my mom for Brunch on Saturday morning, we got there around noon and it was pretty crowded but we were still able to be seated right away! The food is seriously so good, and there are so many different options it makes it tough to pick just one.  We decided to have more of a lunch but I have to say the pancakes look so so good! We ordered the B.A.L.T. (Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, and Tomato) sandwich to share which came with a side salad the dressing was a very good light vinaigrette.  And then we had to try the bacon mac n Cheese of course!! WOW, it did not disappoint I would highly recommend if you are a cheese lover yourself! The coffee was very good as well and they are always very good about refilling.  The atmosphere is very fun the music felt a little loud at first but the playlist is so good that we didn't really mind.  It has a very young fun vibe while still feeling put together.  Our service was really good as well and the food came out in a timely manner.  I have been for brunch and drinks in the past and all of my experiences have been pleasant.  I hope you enjoy!",1,,
13,Nick S.,"Lynnwood, WA",83,83,14,2.0,10/2/2018,"Mid meal review! That's my new thang!Ordered the fried chicken. Promise of a southern fried chicken did not deliver. Bland, extremely oily (pool of oil on the plate, bottom soggy). Decent slaw came with. Heres the problem: I ordered it. The chicken arrived in under 5 minutes.  Asked the server about the speed - she said it was made to order.... ehhhhhh...  I don't think so. You can't make fried chicken in 5 minutes. The ladies sitting next to me were already seated with cocktails, I was mid entree when their food arrived...  a burger and a salad. Hmmm... something doesn't smell right.After my chicken,  I ordered pie. So far it is taking longer than chicken that should have taken 20 minutes... will update soon!Completed meal update:Pie was awful. 99% sure it was reheated in the microwave.  Crust was flexible and chewy. Bottom appeared essentially uncooked and the apple filling was nothing special and spilled out whenever I tried to get through that miserable crust. Oi vey!To top it off, the second I took my last bite, the check was at the table. Not that it's a bad thing, but did my chicken come so fast because I was a solo diner not drinking cocktails? One has to wonder.",,2,
14,Shola A.,"Oakland, CA",212,51,150,5.0,4/11/2018,"Once you walk through the door, you instantly become a part of the family. Everyone who works at Bubby's is so friendly and accommodating!  On the menu, you'll find some amazing brunch dishes like buttermilk biscuits, Nutella pancakes(which are AMAZING), and eggs benedict. Bubby's is a family friendly spot and a good place for you and friends to grab brunch as well. That's  what I did a couple of my friends headed to Bubby's around 11:30 and me. Bubby's does not take reservations on the weekends, so its best to get there early to avoid the wait.I suggest if you go with a group of friends get one or two pancake stacks to share with your group. The Nutella pancakes are to die for, Nutella makes everything great, and these pancakes were one of my favorite dishes. The addition of strawberries and whip cream is an excellent addition to the plate. The chicken biscuits were buttery, flaky goodness! I am a lover of sweet & savory combinations, and the spicy honey mustard added a great kick to this sandwich. The chicken was seasoned well and very flavorful. I asked the waitress if I could swap out the homemade chips for homemade house fries and so glad I did!Bubby's is an affordable brunch with most of the dishes between $15-$25 which is a steal for an NYC brunch!",,,
15,Melissa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",27,61,0,1.0,11/9/2018,"Over-priced ""hot spot"" for no apparent reason other than people think they night see a famous person, I guess.  I came here on a Friday for lunch and found the food to be mediocre at inflated prices and our server was really indifferent and borderline rude.  Never again.",,,
16,Chris B.,"New York, NY",36,11,29,5.0,11/5/2018,I go to Bubby's several times a month and it's an amazing go-to spot that will make everyone happy. Highly recommend the Peruvian chicken entree (if you want to stay somewhat healthy). Solid appetizer choices are the meatballs and deviled eggs. CBD tea is also great to warm up on a cool fall day.,,,
17,Reid R.,"Santa Monica, CA",13,53,15,4.0,11/1/2018,"Super good food. Only reason for not 5 stars is that the ""half chicken"" which most places is a ton of food, was a tiny amount of food for $21. Not a great value, but still delicious.",,,
18,Allison C.,"Huntsville, AL",302,74,92,5.0,5/20/2018,"Like I can't even get enough!!  Love this place!!!  Brought the whole family tonight so my son and his girlfriend could try it!  This location is my favorite and it is a bit quieter than the High Line one which is great for being able to carry on conversations!We started with a couple appetizers.  We had the deviled eggs and biscuits!  The biscuits are an absolute must!!!  Ugh... I dream of them!  And the deviled eggs are so smooth and creamy.For our mains... I had the Peruvian chicken (my favorite!  I love the marinade that is with it) My husband had the salmon, my daughter had the nachos, my son had the fried chicken and pancakes and his girlfriend had the veggie burger.  We had several sides that we all shared - the mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, charred asparagus and fries.  It was ALL AMAZING as usual!  I've never had a bad meal!!!And of course we all had to have dessert!  We had the peanut butter chocolate pie, apple pie with ice cream and the banoffee pie!  My favorite is the peanut butter chocolate pie but my son and husband think the apple pie is legit best!",1,,2
19,Tara R.,"New York, NY",4,47,31,3.0,10/31/2018,"This place is a typical NYC brunch spot only a bit more on the expensive side. There aren't a whole lot of brunch spots around the high line area so I would say this is one of the better ones. I recommend their chicken and waffles. Upgrade for a few dollars more to get Nutella and berries on the side, it's worth it! Most likely you will need a reservation for the weekend or you'll have to wait around a little.",,,
20,Heather S.,"New York, NY",563,362,80,3.0,5/24/2018,I'm sad that I have to give this place 3 stars. I heard many things about Bubby's and my wife and I were so excited to try it. My coworker kept pressing us to go and we said fine we will go. And we went! We got their biscuits and they were to die for!!!! Their pancakes fell short. It wasn't bad but it wasn't like mind blowing. Their fried chicken was tasty however. I think I would just stick to a million biscuits and ya that'll be good.,,,1
21,Sonya C.,"San Francisco, CA",5,74,38,5.0,10/23/2017,"Local breakfast spot that doesn't disappoint! They make their own jams (try them on their off the hook pancakes) and have 3 choices of Bloody Mary on the menu. Hubs enjoyed the ""Award Winning BM"" -smoked gin, balsamic reduction. I'm not usually the person to order pancakes out (why order them out when I make killer ones at home?!) but I couldn't resist them here since it's one thing they're known for at breakfast. And with grade A organic syrup?! Yes please!!!!! Hubs had the smoked salmon Bennie served with apple fennel salad. Plate was clean!Service was great. Victoria was awesome making sure we felt at home and had everything to enjoy our meal. Don't leave tribeca without coming here!",1,,

24,Stephanie M.,"New York, NY",74,618,4,3.0,4/2/2018,"So sadly, I cannot review the fried chicken because we came in at that weird time btwn brunch and dinner and they had a limited menu. However: it was happy hour, so that was nice.The nacho appetizer was very small by nacho appetizers, but was the perfect amount for us that day since we didn't want to eat a ton.  We split a burger, which was a good burger although nothing insane to write home about.  And for dessert, we had the banana coffee pie and peanut butter pie.  We def should have split, but the bear doesn't like banana desserts,  I thought the pie was very good, tho I didn't taste the coffee in it too much.Sadly, by dessert time it was dinner and other people were eating the fried chicken.  Service was meh - it was very slow considering it was half dead.  There were a LOT of families with babies, which is a personal pet peev of mine. All in all - it was fine, but I would like to come back some day for the pancakes and/or chicken. Would be a good place to take parents.",1,,1
25,Karelyn V.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,6,3,5.0,6/23/2018,"This place is AMAZING!!! Decided to stop in one Saturday afternoon after class and I did not regret it one bit. I was always in search for the best pancakes and I finally found them! I got the blueberry pancakes and they were so fluffy and delicious. Also the serving is a lot so I was not able to finish it all. The drinks are pretty good too. I got a mimosa flight with different flavored mimosas and they were so yummy. Bubby's is a nice place, it felt like I was in a family members dining room. The service there is phenomenal, and the waitress even recommended what kind of pancakes to try. A definite must if you're craving some great pancakes!",,,
26,Valerie V.,"Raleigh, NC",208,237,556,5.0,9/17/2017,"This place is a quintessential New York gem. My brother and I popped in for a late Saturday lunch and found that they served brunch until 3! Praise.  This place is one of those places within the neighborhood that isn't touristy, which is amazing. Lots of locals. Sometimes a star sighting. We were not super hungry but wanted a pick me up. The mimosa flight is A MUST. Well at least it was for us.  The varieties were unique and really tasty. The flight we had included:  watermelon lemonade, pineapple cilantro, spicy grapefruit, and original. The spicy grapefruit was really smoky tasting and I like spicy but this was not my favorite. I think combining spicy with something sweeter, like pineapple, would be a better option. No regrets though, they were all great!We ordered a bagel with smoked salmon to split and deviled eggs. How can you go to a place like Bubby's and not get a lox bagel?  The salmon was fresh and tender. The poppyseed bagel was huge so I'm glad we shared. The cream cheese was horseradish cream cheese. The deviled eggs were also prepared with horseradish. I now want to add horseradish to everything. That made such a difference in both dishes and in a great way. Super amazing. Apparently they are known for their pie, but we didn't have room (saving cals for dinner res). I want to go back to this place - and soon.",2,,
27,Yael H.,"Manhattan, NY",41,5,4,5.0,10/28/2018,"Love it here. Their pancakes are SOO good! I also love their basket of muffins!! I've only had breakfast here, but I've come back time and time again. Brunch lines admre a bear and full of b&t, but if you come before 9/9:30 it should be fine.",,,
28,Nicole Q.,"Willow Grove, PA",3,34,31,3.0,10/23/2018,"The highlights were by far the pigs in a blanket, Peanut Butter Chocolate Pie,and Bourbon Sweet Tea! We had a big table.... And they clearly were training new staff for the front of a house. It was a bit of a hot mess.... I felt bad for the experienced staff. On the food front, the burgers and fried chicken looked awesome, and the apps were all good. My fajitas however were downright sour because they were drenched in lime, so avoid those. Overall cool atmosphere, and I would definitely give it another shot.",,,
29,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",39,118,142,5.0,5/9/2018,"LOVE THE FOOD. Hate the Sunday brunch waiting lines. People wait an hour or more for weekend brunch, but I must say it is completely worth it.

31,Juliet B.,"Morristown, NJ",40,74,88,4.0,4/21/2018,"Bubbys is a place with serious breakfast/brunch selection. The food is always consistent and never fussy. They are very accommodating to all food types. From granola and yogurt to a full on protein menu including burgers and chicken and biscuits. I came with 8 friends. They don't take reservations so we got there at 10:45 a.m. and sat down appx 11:30. Service was good as are drinks. Bloody Mary had a nice kick to it. I had avocado toast with goat cheese. I 86ed the fries and our server offered a salad. Both were very good and light. My friends ordered huevos ranchero, chicken and biscuits, pancakes and burger. Everyone was satisfied. Our orders all came out at same time and strangely the only thing missing was syrup for their famous pancakes. I was not a fan of the huevos ranchero so if you are from the west coast don't bother with it. But it's not the worst thing you could eat. Great place to bring family and visitors. I will keep coming back.",,,1
32,Ross P.,"New York, NY",39,125,101,4.0,8/7/2018,A neighborhood staple which makes it hard to find seating for walk-ins. I suggest Bubby's Breakfast with a side of fruits. The One Lincoln is a good alternative as well. The service is just as great as the comfort they provide.,,,
33,Nikita K.,"New York, NY",30,224,34,2.0,7/22/2017,"As far as Bubby's goes. The food here is mediocre. But I will say, atmosphere wise, the Bubby's in meatpacking has a better vibe and has outdoor seating. We had the following:Banana Walnut pancakes - these are the toppings on the pancakes, not baked in. The pancakes themselves are very fluffy and good for sharing, but I didn't love them, they needed a lot of syrup Ham and cheese omelette - I've had much better ones at other restaurants. Eggs were over cooked (didn't know this was possible) Lastly - the award winning Bloody Mary was far from legendary in any respect. The habanero bitters were definitely not added to that drink. Overall, if I had to pick, go to the meatpacking location. whitney museum members get 10% off and the location is bigger. But ideally, pick a spot that isn't a chain and a bit more unique.",6,1,

The pancakes are legitimately some of the best I've ever had and my fried chicken was super tasty too. I just went a week ago and I already want to go back so I can get that specifically!! The biscuits are truly the best I've had in NYC (originally from KY), the butter and fresh jam they come with are great, and there's truly something on the menu for everyone! My friend that came with me last time is a healthier eater and had a salad she was really happy with as I enjoyed all my chicken and pancake goodness.

I ate the whole thing without any regret. As for the appetizers, everything was delicious as well. My favorite was probably the matzo ball soup. But then again I'm a sucker for matzo ball soup so I may be bias. Came on a Friday night around 8pm and the place was pretty empty. We called for reservations but once we got there there were plenty of seats available so for later dinners, you'll be good to go. Service was great. No complaints. My friends ordered the blueberry pie and cherry pie but I was too stuffed to even take a bite. But they loved it. And from the looks of it it looked delicious as well.",,,

Heard that the pancakes are phenomenal and tried that. Definitely did not disappoint (but did not exceed expectations either). The fried chicken was pretty scrumptious; well-seasoned, and also not dried or overcooked. They use quality ingredient and don't try to skimp on anything.

Apple cider is offered while you wait to be seated which is a nice touch.

Updated review","Where should I start? Word of there being great hot cocoa and a massive marshmallow had me convinced.This is a neighborhood hotspot so lots of locals. I underestimated how packed it'd actually be. It was no biggie since we were seated roughly 10-15min after arriving.This place does a great job of making one feel at home, very intimate.I'll settle for a great bourbon cocktail any day of the week if it sounds good. I wanted something light and refreshing and the Bourbon Smash delivered. It's very tasty! You do not notice the alcohol so be very careful with this cocktail.I ordered the fried chicken and pancakes. The fried chicken was properly seasoned, lightly breaded and juicy. The pancakes were an animal. Talk about carb heaven! They were massive and dense. I could only eat one of them but that's okay. No complaints here, I needed the space for later.We couldn't leave without trying one of their infamous homemade pies and hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was extremely rich. The homemade marshmallow complimented very well, of course, but this was no ordinary marshmallow. Most marshmallows are small and cute then absorb into the hot chocolate. This goliath of a marshmallow barely dissolved. It sat on top of the hot chocolate like oil does water which made every sip an equal taste of rich chocolatey deliciousness.***second visit***I not a ""pie person"" so the server recommended the Banoffee. This pie makes me consider removing pie from my list of banned sweets. C'mon! Bananas, dulce de leche, and a graham cracker cookie crust topped with a layer of toffee doesn't sound like a pie to me. Let's just say I will be back for that when I'm in the area.This was such a glutinous visit but I'd do it again and again with no regrets!!",1,,
43,Sharon W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,64,19,3.0,7/4/2018,Had high hopes for this place but was disappointed.  Entrees which consisted of fried chicken and salmon were over priced for what they were and way too salty.  Even my asparagus was overly salted.  Advice to chef:  Use less salt.  Three stars for the biscuits which were delicious.,,,

Updated review","I've been coming to Bubby's for YEARS (since I was a little girl!) and went very frequently when I lived in TriBeCa with my now husband.We love it so much we decided to have our post-wedding brunch here. It was the best decision we could have made. I planned it all out with Nella, who was easy, extremellllllly accommodating and personable. She went the extra mile with helping with seating and place cards and then found us a microphone when it came time for speeches. We booked out the restaurant for a 70 person Friday afternoon brunch and they executed it perfectly. We arrived a little earlier than planned and the entire restaurant and staff was ready and armed with plates of passed appetizers and mimosas for days. The staff was WONDERFUL. Everyone was so professional and cheerful and really added to the experience of our wedding day. I believe Denver was serving my table- he's a gem.If you're looking for a place to host a sizable special occasion meal, look no further.  Bubbys was professional but also personable. We never felt rushed when it came time for the party to wrap up, and they took care of us like we were old friends. Thank you Bubby's TriBeCa, you'll always have a special place in our hearts.",,,
47,Hayley T.,"Atlanta, GA",160,40,14,5.0,6/9/2018,"I am absolutely baffled that Bubby's has such mediocre reviews. I will chalk this up to NYC food snobs who believe themselves to be ~too good for such a 'pedestrian' brunch~. In the quest for awesome brunch, put your ego aside (I'm looking at you, 'but it's sooooo touristy!') and just enjoy the damn food!Bubby's is SO GOOD!!! We visited on a rainy Sunday morning around 10am. There wasn't a line (yet) and we were seated right away. We both got pancakes--I got the blueberry James Beard stack, and my husband got the FRIED CHICKEN AND PANCAKES (also James Beard). Wow. W o W. They were SO GOOD! They were thicc and fluffy and just delicious and gigantic! My husband's fried chicken was OUT RAGE OUS. It was honestly some of the best, most flavorful and juicy fried chicken I have ever had. I mean, the pancakes were to die for but the chicken was truly the star of that dish. We also got biscuits and jam (like okay, we definitely didn't need THAT many carbs but...could not resist!). The biscuits were flaky and the jam a lovely touch. Tbh probably some of the best biscuits we've had in the City (which isn't a high bar but still). I am still dreaming about this brunch, honestly, and I am dying to stop by for a slice of the peanut butter pie! Also the service was SUPER friendly and fast. Yay for Bubby's!",1,,
48,Jason E.,"Princeton, NJ",185,51,6,4.0,7/7/2018,Love this place. Always have. It just gets too damn busy. Stopped in last Sunday and got this incredible overstuffed green omelette. Heaven on a plate. I know what I'm getting next time.,,,
49,Joye L.,"Sandy Springs, GA",1,32,16,4.0,9/23/2018,Delicious and once seated (which did take forever for Sunday brunch) the food arrived very quickly. Everything was done exactly as requested. Fresh food,,,
50,Krupa G.,"New York, NY",5,66,35,3.0,12/3/2017,"Came to this place on a Saturday for brunch and the wait time as around 15-20 minutes. They do not take reservations, but is quite a large space for the location it's in. The mimosa flights are a must! Small enough that all 4 can be finished by one person. We ordered the huevos rancheros, jalapeño biscuit, and the banana pancakes. The huevos rancheros was one of my favorite dishes - just make sure you ask for hot sauce to give it a kick. Service was pretty decent and the staff did break out into a Whitney Houston rendition which turned the atmosphere into a warm environment. Worth a try once, but the food didn't blow me away.",1,1,
51,Diamond G.,"New York, NY",336,143,2045,3.0,10/29/2017,"The food here is always nothing but amazing, but the staff ?!Please tell me who hired these people. I have come here several times and each time everyone is completely in their own world. The host was on FaceTime while we were standing there waiting to be seating, We literally had to wait until she finished her phone call to be taken care of. The bar staff as well were extremely playful at the bar. Its one thing to have an empty restaurant and to enjoy and have a good time with coworkers, but if people are coming to dine in they should be taken care of, eating especially with children the langue being used at the bar was rude. I personally curse a lot but i am always aware of my surroundings as kids pick up everything.If I were alone I would have left, but the kids hadn't been here for a while and had been dying to come. So we stayed, our waiter was even worse. They were transitioning between menus and we didn't mind as we just had to wait 10min for our diner orders to be put in. She took our orders and never returned with water or anything, Our meals took an hour to come and though everything was extremely fresh and tasted great she had yet to bring us any beverages.Don't get me wrong I absolutely love this place, well I guess I love the kitchen staff right ? I am an absolute foodie and every meal here is amazing, but the front host, waitresses and bar staff definitely need to be trained and monitored more. Maybe the manager wasn't in this day ? I still don't understand the FaceTime call going on at the front I can understand a normal phone call, but a loud FaceTime call ?",8,,4
52,Josue D.,"Los Angeles, CA",713,24,10,5.0,7/4/2018,"Went here on 4th of July, so was obviously very busy. Even so, the service was really great and the servers constantly checked in on us. The food itself was really great - the eggs Benedict were really delicious, especially with bacon. The green egg omelette was a little dry, but thought it was good overall.The biggest surprise was the fried chicken and pancakes - pancakes were nice and fluffy and the chicken was perfect crispy and juicy. Overall, good experience, good music, and good service.",,,
53,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",17,96,273,5.0,1/4/2018,I used to live not far away from this Bubby's location. Their apple pie is my absolute favorite! Their vanilla ice cream is also amazing! Everything tastes very home made and you feel at home at Bubby's. From their food menu I have tried the Mac and cheese which was also very good. Definitely recommended.,,,
54,Jennell F.,"WALL STREET, NY",3,42,26,3.0,6/28/2018,It was my first time. I thought I was going to enjoy the fried chicken and pancakes. Well the pancakes were delicious but the chicken was cooked really hard. I love fried chicken but not cooked that hard. I do understand it was in a brine but why so hard? The soft shell crab was good.,,,
55,Frances T.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,22,7,4.0,7/4/2018,Great place to take kids for brunch. The hostess was very nice and the wait was not long. Table turnover is pretty fast. Were told 20 mins wait but it was like 10. We sat at the bench outside while waiting. Our server was very quick to take our orders and food were tasty. I would say the restrooms need to be taken care of - it was comparable to the public restrooms in subways.,,,
56,Atsuko Y.,"New York, NY",77,102,60,2.0,10/19/2017,"So.. food is okay. If you eat in, service will be pretty lousy but the cute interior makes up for it. I just ordered in- got their salmon. $28 ish after tax and tip. The fish is over-charred and literally 1""x 1"" x 4.5"".Geez.",2,,
57,Angelina D.,"Chevy Chase Village, MD",0,4,2,4.0,9/29/2018,"Loved the place. Fast in sitting and the menu is diverse. Fast with food and a great restaurant to start the day, breakfast or lunch.",,,
58,Gauravi P.,"Boston, MA",259,350,668,3.0,3/29/2017,"The food was good here but the service was terrible. We were seated almost immediately upon arrival, despite the long wait for people in larger groups. That was awesome. However, once we sat down, we quickly realized we couldn't hear a thing. The music was extremely loud and we were literally shouting in order to hear each other.I ordered a Cobb salad and split cheesy grits and biscuits with jam and whipped butter with my friend. Everything was tasty- especially the biscuits. Our waiter was a genius. He got a 20% tip for doing nothing. We waited on ourselves and basically had to chase him down if we wanted anything.I wouldn't come back here. I have no idea what the hype is all about. This joint is pretty basic.",4,1,2
59,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",284,130,874,2.0,3/25/2017,"I really wanted to like Bubby's, but our brunch here ended up being a series of missteps.My friend and I wanted to try Bubby's, and we heard that their brunch goes until 4PM on Sundays, so we headed over around 3.  The restaurant itself is open and bright; it's pretty inside although the music is loud.  There was a half hour wait but we were eventually seated (after one employee was yelling at the hostess that she needed to seat customers faster...uncomfortable to watch).  Anyway, we get seated at a table that's been pushed up against the table in the corner, forcing those individuals to stare at us for the duration of the meal.  Our server was nice but the service as a whole was extremely slow.When looking at the menu, immediately had high expectations due to the pricing (in what world does an eggs Benedict with no meat, only avocado and tomato, cost $22?  Or adding salmon to a salad cost $13?).  I ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon and the cold brew coffee.  I asked for home fries instead of salad because I saw the person next to me ordered this way (they won't tell you up front, but you can do it).  My friend ordered the veggie chili, french fries, and a mimosa.The eggs Benedict were highly disappointing for $22.  If you are going to charge $22 for two eggs and an English muffin, it better be perfect.  The eggs were so overcooked they were practically hard boiled.  The hollandaise was good and the home fries were alright.  The salmon was iffy at absolute best.  I could get the same dish from a diner for half the price and double the quality.  It baffles me how you can mess up a poached egg but still charge more than $20 for two of them.  Additionally, after I realized the eggs were not quite right, I looked around for our server and couldn't find her.  Ended up eating over half the dish before she came back to check on us.  I disliked the cold brew.  The menu said it had all different flavors in it, i.e. apricot.  I was expecting some subtle hints of flavor (you know how they always tell you to observe notes of apple or something but it just tastes like regular coffee?) but WOW this was really in-your-face flavor.  The best thing I ate was probably one of my friend's french fries.  When we were done eating, our plates were cleared, and it took a long time for the check to come out, even though the restaurant had largely cleared out by that point.All in all, for the price, I was extremely disappointed.  Would consider coming back for pie, but otherwise, I don't think I'll be returning.",7,1,
60,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,3/15/2017,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner after a snowstorm. The place was pretty crowded, but we were able to grab a seat right away.To start off, we went with an order of the biscuits--these were good, not great, but had a nice flavor with the butter and jam.For our meal, we decided to split the meat platter and sides of mac and cheese and roasted cauliflower. First off, the sides were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were so tasty and really complimented the meat well. The mac and cheese had such amazing flavor and the cauliflower was perfectly roasted as well.The meat, on the other hand, was not as successful. The brisket was very good--super juicy and tender and great flavor, but the ribs and pulled pork both seemed a bit dry to me. The BBQ sauce definitely helped, but I was a little underwhelmed.For dessert, I decided to get a slice of the peanut butter pie, which was so rich and creamy and the perfect ending to a decadent meal.Overall, this place served up some great food and is a tremendous value, especially for the area as we got all that and a bottle of wine for $100. In addition, our waitress was super friendly and the ambiance was perfect. Definitely a great place to catch up with a friend or bring a large group.",4,3,3
61,Sara N.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",140,33,49,5.0,5/20/2018,"Where do I begin? I came in expecting a mediocre dinner with the family, just something to eat, nothing spectacular ya know? Boy was I wrong. We started off with some biscuits and deviled eggs and both were savory and delicious. The biscuits were huge! And the deviled eggs were simple but the flavor was all there, they were piped into a perfect little swirl and topped with paprika. For dinner my family had the fried chicken and pancakes, bacon macaroni and cheese, nachos (an appetizer eaten as an entree), salmon with pesto and a salad, a Peruvian style roasted chicken that was seasoned to the Gods and I had their version of a veggie burger which was a lentil patty (my very first time trying a lentil patty) and it was all delicious. Our home base server was nice, but not very attentive or personable, which is okay, because the food made up for it. We ended the dinner with some delicious pie, I recommend the chocolate peanut butter pie!! We'll definitely be back!",,,1
62,Jessica K.,"New York, NY",350,1086,683,3.0,4/22/2018,get the pancakes!! if you like savory vs sweet--don't get any toppings and ask for butter and maple syrup on the side.,1,,
63,Honest T.,"Chicago, IL",0,37,0,1.0,7/15/2018,"First impressions are everything. I will never forget how incredibly RUDE,DISMISSIVE and DISRESPECTFUL a waiter named was VICTOR.Brief Recap:Waiter: Victor was HORRIBLE.  Mgmt: Jasmine, nice but missed the mark.Mgmt: Imani (sp?). promised follow up with GM Tara, never happened.Food: Better options available everywhere with better service.My cousin and I decided to take my niece here after reading the rave reviews. The issue started when my niece decided to order a main dish and several sides. As a growing teen she orders with her eyes, but never actually eats a full order. At no point did he intercede to give a more economical option, which is what my cousin and l, the paying  adults requested. Once we did he interjected and proceeded to instruct us to let her speak for herself?! After we protested he became combative, cut me off, and decided to have someone else wait on our table. The manager Jasmine came over to ""smooth"" things over,but I wasn't overly impressed with the way she handled the situation. First, an introduction was due. We only found out she was the manager after we asked. Next, the poor customer service was never addressed. She simply took our order. Lastly, there was no follow-up. After she took our order it was if that made everything ok. A waiter should NEVER tell someone's guardian how their food should be ordered. He was out of line unless he planned on paying for the wasted food. It's far too many choices in Tribeca /NYC to waste them on poor service. I also called the cooperate office and spoke to someone named Imani (sp?), she apologized, but like Jasmine there was no follow-up with the general manager Tara. I never received a call as promised. For just decent food, this place isn't worth it.",2,3,

Our waitress named Jeisleen gave us amazing service. We will definitely come back again soon. We had the eggs Benedict & chicken & waffles. The food was amazing. It came in a good timely manner whilst the restaurant was packed. The environment was relaxed. Felt like home. And the menu prices aren't as bad considering the neighborhood it's in.,,,
67,Kate J.,"New York, NY",425,427,234,4.0,5/25/2018,"I had an enjoyable time for lunch here. My waiter was very friendly and the environment, though busy, was very nice. I got a turkey BALT and I enjoyed that, too. Would highly recommend the biscuits to start. which were the highlight of the meal. Only thing is, the prices were so high that I cannot see myself coming back very often.",,,
68,Malcolm P.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,5,21,4.0,10/18/2017,There's nothing like pancakes on a Sunday for brunch and their pancakes are phenomenal.  Bring your appetite because you will be stuffed.Their drinks are on the lighter side.  It's actually perfect for a Sunday afternoon because they won't leave you sloshed.The fried chicken was crispy and well seasoned.  (Better than Blue Ribbon's but not as good as Sweet Chick's)Their prices are average for the neighborhood.The service was good.  We were sat right away and our waiter and busser were attentive without being overbearing. I live in South Brooklyn so I won't be back every Sunday but when I have a craving for pancakes this will be my destination.,,,1

72,Kim G.,"New York, NY",132,329,986,2.0,1/19/2017,"We headed to Bubbys for a few things, great fried chicken, soft fluffy biscuits and yes, awesome friggin pie!We got most of what we wanted! Originally, we were at the highline and tried to get into that restaurant but, there was absolutely no parking over there! So, we came over to this one. We got a spot right away. When we arrived we walked into the bar area. It was busy but, we were seated promptly in the dining area. It was close quarters though. The waitress took a long time to come over and take our drink and dinner order. She was extremely sluggish through out our whole dining experience. For drinks, we ordered a bourbon maple shake and coffee. When it did come, the shake looked melted and for the price it was super small.  I did not taste much alcohol but it was good. Unfortunately, there was no whip cream. We had ordered the ""bottomless"" cup of coffee so, I think we really shouldn't have to ask for sugar or milk. I think it should naturally just comes with it. We had to ask and by the time the waitress came back with it, the coffee was done. So then, we had to ask for a refill!! Ugh! It was a painful, vicious cycle.. The coffee was never hot  but it was good.For an app we shared a kale salad. It was pretty big. It had roasted squash, pomegranate, goat cheese, pecans, and a light dressing tossed in. It was really delicious and fresh. The pecans gave it a nice crunch and the goat cheese gave it a nice creaminess. For dinner we had heard the pancakes were very good so, we ordered pancakes and fried chicken and a order of biscuits and fried chicken.  Also, we ordered a side of Mac n cheese. Well, needless to say we had to ask for all the condiments (syrup, butter, jam) .The pancakes were delicious but it came with two small pieces of chicken. Both were crunchy and seasoned nice. They were a little dry and bland inside. Mac n cheese really was dis appointing. Who makes the Mac n cheese with a ton of cinnamon? Ew The biscuits were amazing crunchy, soft and buttery. Loved the jam that I had to ask for!For dessert we had banofee pie had chunks of bananas and fresh whip cream and caramel. Also cherry pie was tart  cherries with a crispy crust. Both were fresh and delicious. Im really disappointed by the service and lack of attention. Some of the food and drinks are over priced. If I was you I would just come for pie. (269)",8,,
73,Bill L.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,45,89,4.0,9/26/2017,"Great casual spot for a Sunday brunch.  It is a lively place on a quiet corner in TriBeCa.  We came on a Sunday and there's a big family crowd, but got seated quite quickly.  There are benches by the entrance with lot of plants that makes for great place to gather while waiting for a table.The menu is essentially comfort food with top quality ingredients.  The portions are about average for the value but comparable to others in TriBeCa.  If you want a fun and relaxing vibe on a lazy weekend, Bubby's a great place.  It can get quite noisy in case you want a place to chat.  Service is fast and friendly.",,,1
74,Brandon K.,"New York, NY",177,37,15,5.0,5/29/2018,"As I go to Bubby's ~2 times a month, I think it's time that they put a commemorative plaque up with my name on it. If you haven't been before, you have to go. I can assure you that although the price tag is a bit high on some of the menu options, everything that you order there will deliver.What I've ordered:Matzoh Ball Soup, Chicken & Pancakes, Biscuits, Chocolate Chip Pancakes, Bubby's Breakfast and the Griddle Special.Although I don't have the energy to review each of those items I can tell you that I cried tears of joy after each bite of each of those dishes. The soup is better than your Grandma's and the pancakes are fluffier than you could imagine. If you haven't been here yet, you have to go. See you there!",,,
75,Celeste M.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",211,146,81,4.0,1/8/2018,"I came in for brunch on a Saturday at 11a and was seated immediately. It was busy but not too noisy or crowded. We ordered the hot chocolate with the homemade marshmallow ($7) and it was the most chocolaty thing ever imaginable! I ended up choosing the fired chicken and pancakes ($24) James Beard style. I asked for the bacon on the side as I'm not one to mix my sweet and salty in the same bite and it was hilarious. They just gave me a bowl of bacon! The pancakes were the best I've ever had! Dense but still very fluffy and they serve them with real maple syrup. The chicken was a nice large piece of white meat and breaded perfectly. It had a nice crunch to it but was super juicy on the inside. Overall the service was not outstanding but we got out food quickly and they were pleasant. I would 100% come back just for the pancakes and hot chocolate, but there are many interesting things on the menu that I would also love to enjoy!",4,2,3

He loves pie, I've heard great things about Bubby's, so obviously it made sense!Ordered slices of the peach cobbler, banana cream, and peanut butter chocolate all to go. BANANA CREAM: I thought this was good, but it didn't have anything really special to me? The walnut pralines to me were a nice touch.PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE: This was inhaled in about 2 minutes. So so good, and that crust. TO DIE FOR. PEACH COBBLER: Unfortunately....they didn't give me the peach but gave me their local apple pie by accident. Which was unfortunate as peach cobbler is my boyfriend's favorite, and he actually hates apple pie :( The most important pie gift was ruined. The apple tasted fine, but we were more upset about receiving the wrong pie.Overall the pie is not bad. I do want to say how great the service is. Everyone is so nice, and I was able to wait outside on their chairs (by their garden) and had the pie brought out to me. So nice!I guess next time check your order to make sure it's right before you go home?",1,,

80,Matty A.,"Alexandria, VA",1,89,24,4.0,8/19/2018,"Wow I enjoyed my time at Bubby's. My fiancé and I came here on the recommendation of friends. I had the bacon wrapped meatloaf and subbed spicy broccoli for the mashed potatoes for no extra charge, she got the burger. Both meals were excellent. I had also ordered a beer with my food and I think it was the boroughs pilsner, she ordered a coke which came in a glass bottle. She would have gotten a specialty soda had she seen those before the coke was brought out, the pils was good and light. Ambience was a little loud inside due to a couple groups of 20 somethings, being 10pm we thought we wouldn't have to be yelling to hear each other but Im sure it would have been better without the loud groups. We finished up with a cocktail each, she had the watermelon daisy and I got the eastside. The daisy was a bit on the sour side, I think the combo of lemon and grapefruit liquor overpowers any sweetness from the watermelon and the drink just seemed more sour than necessary, but it went down smooth. The Eastside was excellent, very refreshing and I'm going to have to look up how to make these at home. Overall, a good experience and I'd come here again if I was in the area.",,,

87,Annie L.,"New York, NY",282,129,15,4.0,8/27/2017,"Okay, the sourdough pancakes alone are worth a full star, but everything else is pretty underwhelming. I should've gone with my original plan when coming here to order a full stack of pancakes ($20). Instead I got the skillet/griddle combo (forgot the exact name...$19), which comes with one pancake, 2 eggs any style, and bacon or sausage. The pancake was definitely the standout and I was left wanting more. At a hefty $20, I would've rather spent all of that on the pancakes with its flourishes. Two people around me had ordered the peach ones - one had gotten the fluffy style ones and the other had gotten the sourdough (which are thinner, almost like crepes). The sourdough pancakes are so unique - highly recommend if you're into sourdough bread. Otherwise, the prices and wait aren't really worth it when other places do eggs, bacon, and coffee better.",,,

We fell in love with it so much that sometimes we were there twice in one day. We've done brunch and dinner multiple times. This was always the first place I recommended to friends. Tonight I came here with my friend and we were both so disappointed and upset with our experience. The menu has completely changed, the portions have gotten smaller, the prices have increased and worst of all the quality of the dishes has plummeted. The crispy Brussel sprouts were soggy, the Mac and cheese was subpar, the broccoli was half cooked and the fried chicken wasn't bone in, which makes a huge difference. When the manager Tracy came to ask about our experience we vocalized these concerns and she took everything we said and promised to pass it along. She tried to make the experience better and even gave us biscuits on the house (which are still delicious). This place has been in this neighborhood for so long and it's beloved, but I don't know if I will ever come back because it's just not good anymore. The pancakes are great, but everything else is just nothing like what made us fall in love with this place. I'm really sad and I hope management does something about this. People fell in love with it because they were doing something right, so bring that back. Until then I can't say anything positive about it.",3,,

I stuck with the traditional: a big fluffy pancake, bacon and eggs. I slathered my pancake with butter and their homemade jam. Really delicious. Eggs and bacon were standard.

Was in and out in under 50 min for lunch on a Friday with a group of 6 and no reservations. The spiked watermelon lemonade comes with a slice of watermelon on the side which is super cute. The market and kale salads were  surprisingly good, and the matzo ball soup and biscuits were great as well. The fried chicken came in a great portion. None of this food was the best ever per say but I think they're more known for their pies, so given that it was still a very solid meal I would definitely come back when I have more time to try some of their other food.

This year my mom and 20 year old brother came into town for the holiday, which is a once in a lifetime event. I convinced them to come to Bubby's. They are small people who don't like to overeat, but I assured them (based on my prior experience and other reviews) that we could take the food home and have leftovers. We had half of the turkey left on our table and about half of all the sides when we asked to take it all to go. The kitchen staff threw our food away, and the waitress insisted she couldn't go back into the kitchen because it was too busy. She told us it was an accident. She originally offered to get us new food to go, but never brought it to us. After we signed the check we asked her again and that's when she said it wasn't going to happen. I understand it wasn't her fault but it could have been fixed for us. New food was being brought out of the kitchen to other parties. We left with two rolls (that we salvaged from the table) but otherwise empty handed. My brother was really bummed and I could tell my mom was uncomfortable that we spent over $260 just to be so wasteful. Our meal at Bubby's was at 12:30pm and we didn't eat for the rest of the day.

Updated review","I'm really sad to rewrite my rewiev about Bubbys.It's no longer the place it used to be. We went on a Saturday for breakfast. The place is packed - with screaming children!! Parents who do not care about other guests let their children run around and scream like animals. I get it that this might be their only ""quality time "" with their kids but for f*^k sake!Bubbys no longer serve latte or cappuccino, only their regular bland coffe. I guess it saves time but it does not make a great breakfast.6 dollar for 2 slices of bacon!!!! What a joke!!!I love the bacon! It's the best bacon ever! But 6 dollar for 2 tiny slices. Sorry but this was the last wisit at Bubbys",5,,
104,Jen C.,"Jersey City, NJ",246,290,343,4.0,1/2/2018,"Bubby's has been a staple in Tribeca for years. I've always come here and the food is consistently good for brunch and especially if you have forgotten to make reservation and need to go someplace good for groups. They don't take reservations which is a blessing and a curse as you can imagine. Because this place can get buuuusssyyyy.At least they give you hot apple cider outside while you are waiting around in the frigid icy temps in the winter. The foyer area is way to small to have everyone waiting inside. I also felt like the waitress was rushing the tables. But service is quick and they have soy milk for your coffee. I had the duck confit hash and it was yummy. Friends had chicken n waffles, pancakes, huevos rancheros, all looked so good. Also got the grits, so good!We ended up spending about $60 per person with a drink, brunch option and we shared a dessert. I also just love the decor and vibe in this joint.",,,
105,Celia N.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,145,495,4.0,1/2/2018,"This place has awesome pie - particularly the cherry pie, and the sour cream that accompanies it. The tart and the sweet really compliment each other , and the cherries don't taste artificial. I also usually get the hot chocolate, which is very rich and comes with a massive marshmallow. As far as food goes, it's not anything to die for, but it's simple and good. The Mac and cheese is a pretty good bet, as well as the spinach dip.",,,
106,Renee D.,"Philadelphia, PA",74,192,948,4.0,9/16/2016,"My first time at Bubby's was on a true late night creep last Labor Day weekend with my girl Caroline who was obsessed with this place and had been dying for their chicken and waffles for weeks. She had to work the weekend so we hopped in the car after her shift and drove to Manhattan at 2am. That was the thing about Bubby's then, they were open 24hrs. And if you have never walked the island of Manhattan in the wee hours of the morning you very well should. Its like having the city to yourself. A huge contrast to any other time of day.I wasn't disappointed with my experience. The decor was so charming, mason glasses, rustic finishes, candle lit ambiance. At 2am there were still people dining and hanging out at the bar but we all had so much space to ourselves. The free range chicken was fried perfectly. We both got a breast and thigh perched on top of our delicate, chewy waffles. So so good. Bubby's has now changed their hours though and I weep a sigh of sadness. They close at twelve am. But the food is still as awesome you just have to plot a good time to go when it's not so crowded. Glad me and my girl had our moment though.",4,,

I do come from a jewish background so bubby's was not only a silly play off of my marital romance but reminded me of my very best friend and dearest grandmother. Anyways, We ordered some cold brew coffee for dinner as we were tourists and trying to fit much into one day. Presentation was amazing! I loved that they had traditional cream, however I was unfamiliar with the sweetener. Good though! My veggie burger was modest but I am a carnivore at heart so, i'll try to be fair. My husbands duck was to die for! Delicate, moist, and simply delicious. If you stop by for dinner, please make sure to grab the biscuits as an app.",,,

110,Michelle P.,"Somerville, NJ",4,14,2,2.0,10/13/2017,"Food and atmosphere are great but service was just so-so and then downright rude. I stopped here for a breakfast business meeting. One of my tablemates explained she had a food allergy and asked if she could just get a dry omelette, as there was nothing on the menu she could order as-is. The waiter said they didn't do build your own omelette. She asked for just plain eggs with a few extra egg whites, some cream cheese and raw onion on the side (all standard restaurant stuff??).  The server said he would see if it was possible. No big deal, we continued talking. A few minutes later, another person (the manager? She never said) came over and said while it was possible to do the special order because they were slow, they would not be able to do I again and they don't do ""build your own omelettes."" Which - it wasn't. It was scrambled eggs, basically. It didn't seem like her order was crazy prohibitive.I was appalled - we hadn't even gotten the food and they were telling us never to come back. If we weren't expected at another meeting in a short timeframe, we would have left.Food came out, all was well, except they didn't deliver the cheese or onions, and we had to flag our server down for that and some salt and pepper. I guess a food allergy gets you written off entirely?I get that allergies and food preferences are annoying but I just felt the whole thing could have been handled a whole lot better. If you're not going to make any accommodation, just be upfront about it. The way it was communicated was so rude, I don't think I'll ever come back (which is a shame because it seems like a great spot for a boozy brunch).",3,,

We put in our name at around 1:30pm on a Sunday and ended up waiting only 15 minutes for a table. It wasn't too cold at the time, so we waited outside and Bubby's had provided everybody will little cups of hot spiced apple cider, which honestly probably the best part of our experience! The apple cider was cinnamon-y and well-spiced, which I loved.Between the two of us, we ordered the banana walnut pancakes, kale and farro salad, and crispy chicken biscuit, which in retrospect was way too much food! The crispy chicken biscuit was very tasty, and probably one of the better chicken sandwiches I'd had in the city. Perfectly crispy, and that honey mustard sauce was amazing. My friend said her kale and farro salad was very good as well. However, we were both pretty disappointed with the pancakes. They were a little bland and overall pretty average. Not worth the $20 we spent, and would definitely skip next time. Service was overall pretty good, although our waitress would go missing for long stretches of time. I don't like to round down for reviews-- I would give Bubby's a solid 3.5 stars. Will definitely be back if the mood for a good chicken biscuit sandwich ever strikes!",,,

115,Matt M.,"Cohasset, MA",200,37,52,3.0,8/31/2017,"Came here with family while in the TriBeCa area when visiting manhattan. This place is very unique in many ways. The interior is decorated and shaped in a somewhat modern way with various items and paintings. The tables are uncovered and the glasses are old jars. It was an interesting twist on a sit down restaurant. For food, we started with the nachos. These were very fresh and included many ingredients such as olives, beans, and guac that were all flavorful. They weren't your normal greasy cheesy nachos. Instead, they were crispy and filled with an assortment of fresh veggies and cheese. For dinner, they provide an option to pick a meat and 2 sides. Meats range from chicken to ribs to fish. The sides include mac and cheese, broccoli, and mashed potatoes to name a few. I ended up going with the ribs and Mac and cheese and broccoli. The dish was good but not exceptional. The broccoli was labeled to be spicy, but I found it overwhelming. I had to eat something else in between bites to avoid too much heat! The ribs were good but the rub didn't have much flavor. However, they were basically falling off the bone which is a plus. The mac and cheese was good but was said to have bacon in it. I think I ate 2 tiny pieces of bacon in the whole dish. This place prides itself on fresh and clean ingredients, which they definitely had. However, they lacked the great flavor that is evident in a lot of New York restaurants. Still an enjoyable time with family in a comfortable setting. Also, the service was great and we were brought our meals quickly.",,,
116,Matt L.,"New York, NY",113,544,548,2.0,7/21/2016,"I've been wanting to come to Bubby's Tribeca for a while now, for several reasons. First of all, it's actually pretty hard to find a regular joint that serves classic American dishes. Everything is all mexican, chinese, tacos, french... etc in this city, that it's very refreshing to find a place that does things like lemonade, homemade pies, BBQ, etc.I came for dinner and the first thing that struck me was that the place was very, very warm inside. I spoke to the staff later and they told me that the building was very old, and that the AC system just couldn't keep up with the heat. So, if you come here during the summer, due warning: prepare to sweat.Luckily, they have a lot of nice beverages here to keep you cool while you dine. I think one of the best things here, what with it's super organic menu and whatnot, is the fact that they have a lot of homemade things, like their juices, or specialty root beer, or their homemade lemonade. I tried the watermelon lemonade, which I thought was fantastic. For my main, I got the Bubby burger, which wasn't anything to write home about, but a solid burger nontheless. The food here all seems pretty good, and while I only ate one thing here, I'd say that all the other options, especially the choices for brunch, seem pretty nice. As for the cons though: the food is very expensive here. I know it's a result of running a restaurant in Tribeca, but you'd be surprised what you're charged here given what you're ordering. The burger is $16, but to add cheese, it's a whole extra $2. The watermelon lemonade was $8. This brought my total, after eating an enjoyable but simple dinner, to $33 dollars. Pretty expensive! In addition, there is the heat issue in the restaurant, and the fact that the tables are squeezed together, in order to maximize seating. I know maximizing profit is important, but eating in such a cramped space may not please everyone dining here. I'm a pretty skinny guy, and I had trouble getting in and out of my seat.Overall, a decent place, but a bit too expensive to keep coming back to.",3,,

We showed up without a reservation on Sunday morning, but still got seated within literally just a couple minutes of arriving. I was 7 months pregnant at the time, so obviously, we ordered one of everything off the brunch menu, ha! The BISCUITS were to die for-- I highly recommend them.

Be aware that your whole party needs to be present in order to be seated!FOODI enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros: the two sunny side up eggs, fresh queso fresco and soft tortilla went well with the flavorful green rice. The Fried Chicken entrée was crispy and not too oily, and came with two of their famous biscuits, which were crunchy on the outside and flaky on the outside. They tasted even better with some of Bubby's homemade jam and butter.The Blueberry Sourdough pancakes were my favorite: thin and tart, sweetened by a rich compote.The Cheese Grits Special was a perfect take on classic comfort food: the grits were creamy and cheesy and the sausage was flavorful and moist. SPACEThe dining area is separate from the bar and is brightly lit by wide windows. The place has a rustic charm, with unfinished wooden tables, mason jar glasses, and decor that gave it a cozy feel.The whole restaurant was very crowded at the time, at 12 p.m., near the end of our meal, there were people who were crammed into the dining area waiting for a table. My only complaint was that it was very loud in the dining area and a bit crowed. The din made it hard to talk without significantly raising your voice. Also since we sitting in the middle, my mom was bumped on the head by a waiter at least twice. SERVICE Service was fast and our food came out quickly. Since it was crowded, our waitress did seem a little rushed, pouring coffee so fast it spilled on the table.

127,Tanya C.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,30,2,1.0,5/13/2018,"Service staff (Victoria the waitress) was extremely rude - turned an otherwise pleasant brunch to an embarrassment. We went to Bubby's for brunch on Mother's Day 2018. The wait was roughly 20 minutes for a table of 8. The restaurant wasn't any more crowded than a usual Sunday afternoon at any decent NYC restaurant. We were a party of three couples and two toddlers. The food was good and I would give the food alone a 3.5/5. The service was horrendous. Our server, Victoria, was extremely rude in her tone. She forgot several things several times. When I finally asked her for coffee, she snapped AGAIN. My husband who is usually highly non-confrontational, called Victoria out on her behavior. Instead of apologizing, she said multiple times, very loudly and rudely that she was just ""trying to be efficient"". She even complained to a colleague, gesticulating wildly in our direction. It was really embarrassing. The Manager came over and we had to explain the whole situation to her. The manager tried to remedy the situation by offering free slices of pie - but that doesn't make up for the experience we had. Sadly, Victoria ruined an afternoon for us that was meant to be special for many reasons - 1) My husband this Mother's Day brunch planned for weeks, 2) we were meeting close friends after many months following a serious car accident, 3) as parents of two toddlers, we don't often have the opportunity to catch up with friends over brunch. What was meant to be a pleasant afternoon was ruined by the drama that was caused by Victoria.",,,

My only regret is not getting the pancakes - I had heard that Bubby's does both pancakes and pie very well so I decided to go with a savory brunch and get pie for dessert. My friend got blueberry pancakes which I helped eat - they were almost the platonic ideal of pancakes and definitely superior to the apple pie I had. If you face the same dilemma, go with pancakes.

It is only a block away from another quality breakfasterie, Locanta Verde. Bubby's is a little more casual out of the two. Waiters are generally friendly and helpful. I've only tried their breakfast but both times I was here, I had a pleasant experience. I've tried banana nut pancakes and sourdough pancakes with rhubarb sauce. Out of the two, I prefer banana nut pancakes, which, incidentally is featured on their website under 'menu' section right now. I guess it is one of their signature dishes. I tried the sourdough pancakes for the first time on my last visit to Bubby's and I still don't know what to make of them. It just felt weird to see a dish that look and smell like normal pancakes and tastes.... sour. I like sourdough bread. But my verdict so far is there is no need to make pancakes sour. They are just fine being sweet. I'd say leave the pancakes alone. Anyhow, this is one of the places I look forward to visiting next time I'm in New York.

Why can I down four biscuits at once? Dough. What is it about their matzoh ball soup makes me drool? The ball.Yes, they pull this BS stunt and refuse to sit you if not every person in your party is there at the time of your reservation. Yes, you will wait a crazy amount of time for a table. Maybe 2 hours on the weekends. Yes, their portions are small to average at best (I'm talking like 1 ball and 4 ounces of soup for their famous Matzoh ball soup). BUT, I always go back. Some part of the interior feels like home with a mama's kitchen kind of vibe. Well done on that marketing. Every person on the staff is cooler than I'll ever be.

I ordered the grits breakfast. It came with cheesy grits which were deliciously buttery. The eggs were so fresh and melted in my mouth. The sausage link was full of flavor. The most famous item here is the biscuits with the homemade jam. It's thick and fluffy at the same time. I also got to try the lobster roll. That was really really good.

When finally called to our table, it was bit of a tight squeeze into a corner, but a comfortable one.The waitress was friendly and helpful, answering our questions and letting us know immediately if anything was not available on the menu to help us decide our orders.We got the BBQ Hash & Eggs, Fried Chicken Biscuit, Meatloaf Sandwich, Buttermilk Biscuits and Ham & Cheese Biscuits to share, and a Blood Orange Soda each.The buttermilk biscuits (I prefer to call them scones) were heaven. Crisp on the outside and soft inside, the crunch and slide that came when I sliced through with my butter knife was pure bliss. The taste and texture was perfect. And to top it off, they came with an awesome serving of homemade salted butter and jam. The ham & cheese scone was nice too on it's own but a little on the salty side if you add butter on top.The rest of the dishes were very well done: my over-easy eggs done flawlessly; BBQ has tender enough with small kick from the pepper; the fried chicken deliciously crunchy on the outside, but cooked all the way through on the inside; and the meatloaf sandwich flavorful. Portions were large and filling; I was almost bloated from the amount of food I was eating... almost. Although, the BBQ hash could get tiring to eat after a certain amount.We needed to walk later, so we decided to skip dessert and plan another date for just that.Overall, I was very happy with my meal.

And the shrimp and grits- there were hardly sauce on the grits so it was very flavorless..... My friend had the omelet which contains half plates of potatoes- way way too much.

Updated review","We continue to come back here when the crowd is light.  The food is a strong attraction.  High quality improvisations on classic comfort food and basic dishes.  For example, the huevos rancheros were very good with eggs cooked just right and a nice side of beans and green rice.  I wouldn't call it ""authentic Mex"" but that is not their intention...it just happens to be prepared really well.Fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juices were excellent.  I finished Mrs G's pancakes served with real maple syrup.It does get a crowd - often families with little ones - and it can be loud.",2,,
182,Zhanna A.,"Coney Island, NY",2,2,2,1.0,2/19/2017,I'm just gonna start saying horrible service 1 waited about 20 min to be seated by the way not crowded at all 2 waited to order about 30 min 3 food came after an hour so I thought they making food juicy fresh burger but it's tough to eat the meat looks like cooked a week ago tasteless So don't even come to this place,2,2,2
183,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,359,3,5.0,9/19/2017,"Hosted a work dinner at Bubby's TriBeCa, and we had a great time.  The service was prompt, polite and thorough for our party of 18.  The room we had was perfect for the group, and the food was great! DELICIOUS wings, and everyone really loved the kale salad and fried chicken as well.  Will definitely be booking a work event here again in the future.",1,,
184,Reg B.,"Cork, Republic of Ireland",95,584,75,5.0,4/19/2017,"The original Bubbys... and maybe the best breakfast in the neighbourhood, it's a big feed, well I thought so anyway. The huevos were outstanding, a top breakkie but I had to try something different this time so went for the Bubbys breakfast and it was good. The pork sausage is perfect. I get some of the bad reviews about the place, but it's busy... always busy. So unless you get lucky and/or are prepared to wait maybe don't come? I personally didn't mind waiting and the staff were super nice and friendly across the board. Bloody Mary's were average... definitely better ones to be had. But as a one stop brunch/breakfast stop it's good!",,,

186,Rosemary F.,"New York, NY",94,106,290,4.0,5/9/2016,"So surprised they rank so low on Yelp. I had Mother's Day brunch here and we loved it! Nothing is perfect , with that said we waited about an hour for a table. It was worth it. We walked around TriBeCa and looked over the river and kids park in the neighborhood while we waited to be texted about our table. Once we arrived they were very nice. We started with delicious drinks. I had a strawberry Rhubarb. Delicious! food wise, The Biscuits Are a MUST!!!! So soft and fluffy on the inside and perfectly golden brown on the outside! 100% better than red lobster lol actually incompatible. The jam spread was a plus plus! The fries are also good. We all enjoyed our food and time. Our waiter was really nice. He made sure we were good with understanding the menu and very open to questions. We had a great experience I would return and recommend!",2,,1
187,Quisha F.,"Manhattan, NY",5,35,27,5.0,11/22/2017,"I love this place I wish they had it on the upper west side! Mostly made from scratch and it's all good stick to your ribs food. I love the breakfast but we recently went for lunch and They just added a pastrami sandwich that is life changing. I don't usually like pastrami unless it's Katz Deli and this was so tasty. Also every pie is so good, flaky crust and just sweet enough filling. Great for families and big groups.",,,
188,Yun C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,33,4,1.0,6/6/2018,"Over priced drinks!!! I wish I would have taken a picture of their $14 margarita. It came in a shot glass! I am not kidding! Also tried the worst tasting mimosa, equally small and does not come in a champagne glass and the glass is half full. Drank it in two sips. The food a tried (chicken and waffles) was delicious however just because you are in TriBeCa does not mean you can charge ppl $24 for a chicken wig and a leg split into two pieces with two pancakes! Smh I will not be returning. Oh let me not forget the hostess was talking to an Asian short girl who kept making all types of sounds and talking to the top of her lungs which made the experience ever worst. My fiancé was going to talk to her but we just decided to leave since the experience was a hot mess!",,,
189,Betsy G.,"Port Washington, NY",0,17,0,4.0,5/28/2018,"Bubby's brunch was even better than I remember it last time in 199?. The biscuits were amazing (if only there was no pork lard in them)! The pancakes were very good- fluffy, tasty and big! Only in Manhattan would I pay $21 for them. The grits were really good too!",,,
190,Nina F.,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",2,30,44,4.0,11/17/2017,Drinks are on point just wish they were little bigger . Happy house drink and appetizers for $7! Good deal and more than fair waiting time.,,,
191,Leo L.,"New York, NY",99,377,1225,3.0,3/16/2015,"Brunch. Tribeca. No Frills. Dewwwww it!Bubby's feels like your neighborhood bar and with friendly staff to boot, you can't go wrong. The food won't knock your socks off but everything else is up to decent brunch standards.Came with the beb and her sibling  ( plus friend ) for brunch. Everyone started off with coffee but I decided to go for the ginger ale. In-house made ginger ale was their response and I was intrigued. Come to find out it came in a mason jar filled with flavor and bubbles. Might be my favorite non-alcoholic drink to date. A must get. Bubby's Breakfast ( farm fresh eggs made anyway, sausage, and grits or home fries) was my choice. For bout 19 dollars, you'd think there'd be at least two sausages. I've had better for this combination at my local diner.  My beb got Bubby's version of bacon egg and cheese featuring burrata. She wasn't too impressed. Her friend had the special which was french toast topped with slices of  apple slices glazed ( ? ) and powdered sugar. The apples really tasted like the filling from McDonald apple pie which is definitely not a bad thing. Over all a ""home-y"" joint to come and get your grub on for brunch. I also like that staff here are very kid friendly as well as pet friendly thou I don't think they allow them inside. I've noticed a waitress come out and give some love to a local but famaliar dog from one of the recurring customers here. Service with a smile. We could all use some of that..",6,4,5
192,M B.,"Manhattan, NY",8,325,8,4.0,4/26/2018,Spacious location.  Fried chicken was legit.  Sides were too small to share.  Friendly service.  Child friendly besides a sign about strollers.  Sorry but I'm not parking mine on the street!  I'd still return because the food was great.,,,

194,Bronx B.,"Bronx, NY",2,61,17,2.0,1/30/2017,"Compared to last week, a good server can make all the difference in a dining experience.  Once again, I forced my hubby to go out for dinner and made him drove all the way down here because of the great reviews.  Plus, this particular restaurant was listed in a parents magazine and a parents website as kid-friendly.One of the first things I noticed about this restaurant was the atmosphere.  The décor was cute and had an overall friendly vibe.  I also noticed that all kinds of people were here including families.  We were seated right away (Sunday night-around 6pm) and given our menu by a nice female server that I never got the name of.  Shame on me because I like to give compliments.  For drinks, I had the bourbon sweet tea which was more bourbon than tea.  The hubby and kiddie had regular soda and pink lemonade.  For starters, I ordered the biscuits and they were warm and delicious.  Too bad they cost so much or I would have ordered more.  Dinner was mostly mediocre.  I had the pot roast, my husband had the bbq platter and the kiddie had grilled cheese with french fries.  Out of all our entrees, my daughter's tasted the best (even though she didn't like the grilled cheese).  The fries were seasoned well and didn't even need ketchup.  All the other dishes felt like they were missing something as opposed to no flavor at all.  After I added salt to mine, it was just okay.  Oh, I almost forgot that we order a side of mac n' cheese because the bbq platter doesn't come with sides.  Now, that was good.I wanted to try dessert because of all the raving reviews and FYI, this place only has pies (I'm not complaining).  I tried the ""Banoffee Pie"" and I have discovered something about myself: as much as I want to and other than a cake, I don't like banana desserts.  I think it was okay but next time I will try something different which was what this whole experience was supposed to be about: trying new restaurants and dishes.Positives:The bathroom was clean.  You know don't how important that is to me.One of the sweetest servers that I ever had.There was a kids menu.Negatives:For a kid friendly place (I did notice high chairs stacked up), there is no baby changing table.  Thank God I don't need this kind of amenity anymore but I am going to try to make it a point to mention it in my future reviews because I know I appreciated when it was mentioned.A bit on the pricey side.  About $120 including tip for all 3 of us.The bathrooms are all the way downstairs.  You will see what I mean.  It's like going to a dungeon.  But a clean one.  And its all the way down the hall.  And they have a handicapped bathroom...downstairs (???).Conclusion:Despite the mediocre food, I am willing to give this place another try for breakfast/brunch.  You don't see too many reviews for dinner and I am guessing this is why.  I don't know when that will be because when I told my husband this, he gave me a look that said ""it's going to be a while"".",2,,2
195,Vanessa C.,"Staten Island, NY",134,52,36,5.0,4/30/2017,OMG! Well worth the wait!!! I ordered Huevos Rancho! It came with a lot of food ! I surprisingly ate  it all! The food was amazing our table of six walked out very satisfied ! I cannot recall the cocktail I had but I our entire table was passing around our drinks to share how good ours were!,,,
196,Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",118,247,717,2.0,3/13/2016,"Is your company taking you out to eat? Than this is the place to go!  But if you're buying your own meal out of pocket, take a pass and go somewhere else. Apparently this is a TriBeCa staple, but I'm not really sure wheat they're known for other that the occasional celebrity who might stop in. All I got on the day I visited was overpriced food, a kitchen that is unwilling to customize, and wait staff that is hard to find. I came by for breakfast and was told that their bacon was world renowned- so I though I would have some pancakes and bacon. Sounds like a pretty easy to make breakfast, right?  Well, it really wasn't. See, they have a fixed number of items on the menu, most of which came with eggs which I don't really care for. So I asked if they could do the swap the two eggs on the $19 griddle special (which has 2 eggs, pancake, sausage, and bacon) for a second pancake. Surely a ladle of batter is cheaper than two eggs. But no, they wouldn't do it. So instead I had to order the 3 pancake entree for $19, then pay another $9 for three strips of bacon. That's $3 per piece- YIKES!  Did I mention I didn't want 3 pancakes?If you come here, you better have a company credit card. Else you're just wasting your money on food that's priced at 3 times what it should be just for the off chance that one of the celebs that lives in TriBeCa might eat there that day.",4,2,1
197,Ariel A.,"Bronx, NY",19,2,0,2.0,9/9/2017,"The staff was nice, the food was okay. I had the roasted pork with the mac & cheese w/bacon + creamy mashed potatoes as my two sides. The roasted pork (pernil) wasn't bad but I've had better and for way cheaper at any local Hispanic spot that sells pernil. The mac & cheese was good, but the ""creamy mashed potatoes"" weren't creamy at all. It tasted as if they literally boiled the potatoes, mashed them, and forgot to add butter, salt, cream/milk; I'm not a picky eater by any means so I ate it anyway. My friend had the chicken and pancake. The chicken tasted exactly like KFC and they only give you one pancake. My two star rating is based on the taste of the meal vs price, and I expected more quality for 23-27/plate.",1,,
198,William W.,"Brentwood, TN",127,246,227,1.0,2/19/2016,"Can I give a blank rating for a restaurant? Not necessarily 0 stars, but nonexistent stars? Oh no, I tried but Yelp forces you to choose a rating. Fine!Went to Bubby's, put my name in, was told it would be a 30-minute wait. This place was highly recommended by a friend. So I waited, and waited, and waited. After an hour, I asked if my name was close to being called. I was ignored. Yes, the host stared at me and failed to reply. I waited some more. I asked a hostess and she said my name was coming up.Once you've committed to waiting this long, and taken the New York subway an hour out of your way, you don't want to give up so easily. So I waited some more. I started noticing that people who had come in long after me were being seated.I asked again and I was ignored again. Am I trapped in an episode of the Twilight Zone? I was patient, but after nearly two hours, I gave up. I really wanted to eat hereThat's a strange way to do business! Had my parents run any of their restaurants like that, they would have surely failed.Boycott Bubby's for life!!!P.S. It's times like these I wish I were well known reporter for the New York Times who could publicly humiliate a pathetic business like this. But alas, I'm just a regular Joe and I'm sure Bubby's has so many customers they don't give a darn about me.",7,2,1
