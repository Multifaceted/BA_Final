0,Rebecca H.,"Manhattan, NY",322,224,28,5.0,11/5/2018,"Their steak was the best steak that I've had flavor wise. Period. That rich umami buttery yummy feeling, that texture, I get chills just thinking about how good it all is. And let's not forget the trout. I've never had a fish that was more perfectly cooked. Not overdone, just so perfect that when you take a bite, all you can think about is how good it was.  Oh baby. Highly recommend checking this place out. They have an amazing tasting menu for $78, which includes 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. What a steal! Especially in Manhattan.I'd recommend asking what's on their wine tasting before including. We found it to be more geared towards vinegar astringent-like tastebuds.",2,1,2
1,Annie W.,"Englewood, CO",6,40,14,5.0,10/14/2018,"Very imaginative and delicious dishes made from fresh ingredients. The natural wine ended up being really good. I simply couldn't eat a raw prawn. Couldn't wrap my head around it, or my mouth. Thankfully, my friend ate it so it didn't go to waste.The first course is something I will forever remember. It tasted like a delicious breakfast but looked like a radish salad! It was worth going there just for that course!I was pleasantly surprised at how substantial the courses were given the many reviews saying the food was light for the price. We both felt the $78 price tag is more than generous for the amount and quality of food they serve. I simply could not eat the steak. I was too full. I asked if i could skip that course, but it was too late. My friend, again, helped and took care of that for me. She's the best! The steak was more rare than I care for, anyhow. I recommend you go and eat their food. But go hungry! Don't listen to the reviewers who says it's not enough food! I wish I could have eaten it all. They did adjust our bill since I didn't make it though dessert. That was generous!",,,

Unfortunately for her, something BEFORE dinner had made her nauseated and she wasn't able to complete all the courses, so they graciously adjusted our bill accordingly. Will recommend.",,,
3,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,4.0,8/14/2018,"Contra is a pretty solid spot for wine in the area. There aren't that many places with such an upscale atmosphere in the area, so this place definitely stands out.The by the glass list is small but still has enough options to be interesting, and everything I did try here was good. The pours aren't the biggest, but the service is definitely friendly. When we were here they gave us a glass from a bottle I love (they recommended it, it just happened to be one of my long standing favorites) that they happened to have open, which I really appreciated.The service is very helpful, and while the by the glass list isn't that varied, the options are nice and they have a much more extensive by the bottle list.Next time I'll stop by for a bottle for sure!",1,,2

From the lobster to the simple vegetables, each and every dish on their seasonal tasting menu is mind blowing. Exquisite presentation, and absolutely delicious. This Michelin Star restaurant is by far the best bang for the buck.",2,1,1
5,Colin C.,"New York, NY",265,8,0,5.0,11/9/2018,"Really enjoyable meal, nothing but incredible things to say about the dishes, wine, and service. The trout dish was perhaps the most flavorful fish dish I've had in my life, and would recommend this restaurant solely to try this, however, the other superlatives warrant a visit too. The price is great as well. One detractor, was hoping for maybe a better appetizer, I wouldn't say the curried squash was as much of a home-run as the other dishes, but the others were quite superb - hard to compare truly. Come and enjoy, no reason to miss out.",,,
6,Rebecca D.,"New York, NY",20,69,714,3.0,7/9/2018,"We had a reservation for a Saturday at 8:45. I got there super early and waited at the bar for my guest. You are supposed to select which menu in advance when you make the reservation (regular or vegetarian). We randomly got a vegetarian menu when we sat down and I asked if I was able to order from it. They asked the kitchen and I was able to this evening, but I wanted to share the experience with my guest so I chose to go with the traditional menu. Food:Raw prawns/shrimp. We were a little weirded out by it, but it was okay. Scallop Caruso with cucumber - this was probably my favorite dish with the flavors and textures. The bread was amazing. Slightly doughy, great with the salted butter!! Squash with uni - my guest and I were a bit perplexed by this dish. While the uni was smooth and the squash tasted okay, we weren't sure they went together well. I'm not sure I get the concept here. It was a little weird. Pollock fish with peas.   While the dish was cooked this almost reminded me of sushi for some reason. My guest loved it! The peas were nice. Solid dish. Guinea hen with potatoes. - the skin of the guinea hen was perfectly crispy and flavorful. The potatoes were great. I loved the preparation. Almost an Au gratin almost a mash.  This was a good dish. Blackberry dessert. Was a little firmer than we were expecting. Olive oil was a great touch. The cherry dessert was okay. In general I noticed every dish had some sort of water or thin liquid at the bottom. I can't say I've experienced this often with many dishes. Just an interesting point to note. The service was good, our waiter was lovely. Overall it was worth trying once but I don't think I will be back. There was nothing outstanding and a few head scratchers.",,,1
7,Laura C.,"Dallas, TX",400,88,94,5.0,6/19/2018,"Fantastic value for an upscale one star Michelin! I highly recommend reservations and I believe the earliest you can make one is two weeks out. When we sat down, we were served bread and butter and let me tell you.. they were AMAZING. I would eat that butter with everything if I could. Apparently you can order the same bread and butter next door at their sister restaurant as well. I ordered the pescatarian menu and was thoroughly pleased. Others at my table had the regular menu and they loved their Cornish hen dish. Some of my favorites from the night were the halibut entree and the brunt vanilla dessert. The fish was cooked perfectly and the dessert was divine. Contra is a solid dinner choice that I would definitely return to. Priced at $78, it's a great value.",2,,
8,Jed P.,"Dallas, TX",235,57,40,5.0,6/19/2018,"Great dinner. Amazing value. The space is pretty tight. Long and skinny restaruant and it was packed to the brim when we arrived.The service seems pretty standard for nicer places: change plates/silverware after every course. The servers take time to explain the food in front of you. No issues refilling drinks.The food (obviously) is what makes this place great. The standouts from my meal was definitely the Hen, and the burnt vanilla dessert.Contra also does do pescatarian substitutes which was really nice. I did try some of my gf's dishes and had some interesting ingredients. That was the first time I had seen celery root presented like that. Probably one of the best $78 I've ever spent. 6 courses with interesting flavors. If I'm ever back in NY, Contra definitely makes the ""visit again list"".",1,,
9,Ken C.,"New York, NY",0,29,405,5.0,10/18/2018,"Food and service are very good.  They offer two tasting menu only.  One is called the Contra menu and one is called vegetable menu for vegetarian.  My friend worried whether the food was enough because the food portion didn't look big, but we were full at the end of the meal.  The chef mixed different ingredients very well and all were tasty.  No wonder they received Michelin one stars 2 years in a row.  Reservation at least one week prior to dining is highly recommended.",1,,
10,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,773,33,4.0,8/26/2018,"Interesting meal and well-executed dishes.We arrived as a party of four and split a bottle of wine recommended to us by the waiter, which was interesting and similar to the rest of the meal--interesting pairings, but generally all worked well. The dishes generally had stronger flavor profiles, and the proteins were all well prepared; the fish was very delicately prepared, and the meat was medium-rare to a tee and had very good flavor. The portions are a bit on the smaller side (although the tasting menu is a bit on the cheaper end), and it's a good place for a smaller, unique meal.",,,1
11,Briana W.,"Foxborough, MA",20,311,136,5.0,8/23/2018,"We visited Contra on a Sunday evening with a reservation. We had a short wait upon our arrival but took the opportunity to grab a cocktail at the bar. The bartender was amazingly friendly, but the drinks I find that you can find better elsewhere. Our first course came out very quickly. Each bite was delicious. The plates are small, which was to be expected, yet in the end, we were both satisfied with the amount of food we were served and were not left hungry. The atmosphere was different than I expected. It's a small space with small tables that are very close together. It has a bit of a rustic feel with wooden accents all around. It's cozy but loud. We enjoyed our meal! The dishes were very unique. If you are picky, be sure to take a look at the menu first.",,,1
12,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",171,54,99,3.0,8/19/2018,"Relatively small restaurant with a michelin star and a simple menu - 6 course tasting for just $78! However, portions are relatively small and nothing really stood out to me besides the desserts)-Complimentary bread and butter: 5/5. Yay for warm bread and good butter. It's a sourdough bread and I snacked on this throughout the entire meal. -Tuna: 3/5. It might be the sauce but the texture was interesting. I thought it was a little bland and didn't have enough shimeji as I would have liked. Also didn't even notice that there was yuba in there...-Sea urchin: 4/5. Uni was so fresh and I really liked the flavor combination here - umame with the broth with a tad bit of sweetness from the squash. Also enjoyed the bits of herbs(?) on the top. Nothing out of the world, though. Seemed like a pretty classic japanese dish.-Mackerel: 3/5. A little fishy and plain.-Chicken: 3.5/5. Was inconsistent between the pieces of chicken. One of them was very dry but the other was juicy. The corn and the purslane were a nice touch and complimented the dish well.-Cherry: 5/5. Sort of like a gelato and was so smooth. I was actually planning on going to Morgenstern's ice cream a few blocks away after dinner but this was way better. Had bits of cherry in it too!-Corn, burnt vanilla: 4/5. Very light dessert. Unique texture - kind of airy, sort of like a sponge but without the chew. Not really sure what it is but I really enjoyed this! Service: 4/5.Overall good meal experience but very hurried. Would have liked it if the servers brought over the food a little slower so we could digest and relax. However, they were very friendly and knowledgeable about everything that was served!",,,
13,Mandy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,58,30,3.0,9/17/2018,"Man, oh man.  What a disappointing experience I had this Saturday evening.  The food at this restaurant used to be good (staff I always had an issue with because some of them are pretty bitchy), but Contra has really gone downhill and doesn't even deserve the Michelin star they have.Came to dine here with 3 other people, so 4 of us in total.Course 1: Prawn wrapped in a shiso leaf - What a terrible way to start our experience.  We were instructed to physically take off the head off of the prawn and eat the rest.  I feel like for a tasting menu, the kitchen staff should be taking off the head, not the guest!  Also, one of ours had the legs still on the shrimp's body.  It was ""poached"", but tasted raw.  I spit my entire shrimp out in my napkin because I couldn't swallow it - gross! All 4 of us agreed this was absolutely disgusting and the sauce in the shiso leaf tasted like dirt.  We all thought this was a joke.Course 2: Bread and butter - The sourdough was nice and the butter was creamy.  Nothing amazing, nothing horrible.Course 3: Tuna with tempura bits - tasted like those sushi rolls without the rice.  Nothing wow, not terrible either.  Could have used something sweet to pair it with.  Just a bunch of raw tuna sitting on my plate.  This was such a lazy course that had so much potential.Course 4: Blood sausage and figs - Horrible transition from the tuna.  It is Summer, so I thought this was too heavy for the season.  It was OKAY, but again, gross and a little too experimental and very heavy on the stomach, especially after the bread and butter.  The figs weren't sweet either, so this dish was bland and not exciting.  Also could have used something crunchy for my textural interest.  We all barely ate this dish.Course 5: Mackerel with saffron, grapes and tomatoes - One of us had a bone in our filet.  Missing out of important details like  making sure all the bones are removed is just careless.  This dish was good and surprisingly we actually liked this, but the hot grapes were kind of gross.  They were soggy and warm.  Would have been better if the grapes and tomatoes were served like a nice fresh and crisp cold grape salad.  Overall, best savory dish, which you could have easily made at home honestly - GOOD, but now wow.Course 6: Steak with green beans - One of us was served a chipped plate.  We were all shocked that we paid over $100 each and someone in our table got a chipped plate.  Also, I was given and insanely dull knife.  It took about 45 seconds to cut each piece, how annoying!  This is the attention to detail Contra really misses out on.  We also noticed we all received different portions of steak (2 of us us got 2 pieces and 2 of us got 1 piece).  One of us made a comment about it when it came out and the goth girl that worked there was pretty bitchy when she explained we all had the same portion it just looked different.  I honestly don't care.  If you're serving 4 people, all their plates should look the same.  Anyway, the steak was way too red for my liking (bright red inside), so I ate the outside and left the very bright red center alone on my plate.  We all thought the steak was too red and we didn't finish our plates.We were all so happy that it was desert time because the food was very disappointing.Course 7: Hazelnut ice cream and grape - Very good, loved it.  Tasted bright and tart with that creamy hazelnut flavor.  This was tasty.Course 8: Corn mousse with vanilla pudding - Awesome, really loved the textures and the corn flavor in this one.  Very suitable for this time of year.Overall, 2 stars - 1 star because you can't give 0 and 1 star for good dessert.  We won't ever come back here again.  The menu was confusing, the transitions were off-putting and the attention to detail was truly lacking here.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here or suggest it to anyone unless all you care about is dessert.",2,5,1
14,Sahil S.,"New York, NY",127,28,13,4.0,7/7/2018,"I found Contra to be a solid deal for a 8 course prix fixe menu, and the food lived up to the Michelin Star imprimatur. I would recommend making Contra the cornerstone of a fancy night out in Lower East Side, as I did when I came to visit.My girlfriend and I arrived here after a couple drinks, avoiding the $60 wine pairing fee. We were quickly ushered to our tables and shown the menu. You pretty much have two options - the regular tasting or the vegetarian counterpart. Oddly enough, they didn't mention anything about the vegetarian prix fixe menu until I asked them about it.The courses all looked and tasted delicious, although I must sheepishly admit that the thing I remember most is the rolls of bread and butter. Blame my blunted palette from years of flavor laden Indian food. Highlights include a shrimp that tasted like it had just been pulled from the East River, pancetta served with spinach, and Guinea hen. I think they missed the mark with the pollock and shishito+peas - that combination didn't make sense to me. For dessert, they brought out two similar looking mousses, although the first one seemed like it suffered partial freezer burn.The service was very professional but lacked a personal touch. I felt like the wait staff were ninjas hiding in the shadows, coming out whenever we needed to be tended to. Seriously, I dropped a fork at one point and less than ten seconds later, a waiter silently swooped by and picked it up, immediately followed by another waiter giving me a replacement. The courses came out at a decent cadence, although it could have been a bit quicker. We added on the cheese pairing, which turned out to be a bad idea as it reminded me of spoilt milk. Fortunately, they brought us the cheese out of order and the waiter was kind enough to remove it from our bill.The ambiance is pragmatic and the space is intimate. You can see the chefs running about in the rear, which is always cool.",1,,1
15,Hanna K.,"New York, NY",18,72,270,3.0,2/25/2018,"Located in Lower east side, Contra is a michelin starred restaurant that offers a prix-fix menu only. I did not like the fact that our table was next to the cashier, but overall experience was decent. I liked the beef, madarin and cheese. Beef quality was great. Mandarin dessert was interesting. Lastly, cheese was ordered as an extra but it was tasty. Other dishes were okay.",,,1
16,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1553,4.0,11/11/2017,"The restaurant model of having a prestigious tasting menu-only place alongside a more casual sibling seems almost backwards with Contra. I keep hearing endlessly about Wildair, its wine bar down the street, with an ""oh yeah also Contra has a very affordable tasting menu"" tacked on. I've been deterred by a potentially long wait at Wildair, so I decided to book Contra a couple of weeks ago.We came in around 8 last night. The space is small and spartan, but attractively lit and accented fashionably. Tables are pretty close together, so we were crowded in with our stuff. Bathroom is super chill and carries that amazing Aesop hand soap. Nice music.Our server gave us an overview of how the concept works, as well as the beverage program. You don't make any choices on the food (fixed menu at $74), though they'll allow you choices on imbibing. I had emailed in advance, per their instructions, about my boyfriend's allergies, and didn't have it acknowledged then or when we arrived; when we told her, she said she would make sure she swapped out dessert.My boyfriend opted for the wine pairing for $60; I decided to start slow with a cocktail and steal sips of his. I had the Bitter ($15), which was well-balanced with rum, vermouth, and cynar. We had a amuse bouche of a chip with cream and roe, which was like if sour cream and onion chips were actually good. (Come at me.) A promising start.After reading so many reviews saying that adding $3 for the bread course is worth it, I was pleasantly surprised when we received it without asking. That bread is indeed very good; served warm and doughy with a tasty butter.First official dish was scallops with fennel and celeriac. Finely rendered but unmemorable. We got our first pour of wine, which tasted not unpleasantly of nothing.Second dish was crab and mushroom in a cheesy sauce, covered by a soft blanket of what seemed to be thinly sliced radish. I say ""seemed to be"" because the dishes were quite often unexplained, just dropped off by a runner unceremoniously. Sometimes our server would say a few words about it when she came by with the pairing, but others we were left out in the cold. Anyway, this was actually very good, and a standout of the night. Amazing tender texture, with rich fat that didn't overwhelm. Pairing with this was natural, reminded me a bit of Basque cider without the fizz.Third dish was skate. Now we're heating things up. Buttery and flaky, like the best white fish you've never had (skate is actually a ray), with a lightly crispy crust. Delightful. The white bean and white beet accompaniment wasn't bad but didn't complement it. Wine starting to get interesting, and not in a good way; a natural wine that tasted only of rubber funk, with no backbone.Fourth course of guinea hen was my favorite. They cooked the meat overnight (sous vide?) before crisping the skin, and the texture and flavor were both exceptional. Only a couple vegetables on the plate, but tasty and in an amazing fatty broth. Perfect dish. This was one of the few wine pairings that worked; there were enough tannins to offset the funk that it was somewhat complex, and cut through the fat in the mouth.Fifth course was dessert, round one: pear with a honey ice cream and some hidden bits of meringue. Good flavors, and my boyfriend raved, but the ice cream came out too warm so it was a bit sloppy. The pairing worked well with this as well; there was enough sugar this time to offset the funk. (Is this the secret to good natural wine? Just find something else to cancel out the eau de band-aid?)Sixth course was dessert, round two: hazelnut mousse with a grape granita. Oh my god, a hazelnut explosion in my mouth. Offsetting with the grape is brilliant; an upscale peanut butter and jelly. Texture worked great here. Sad that my boyfriend had to get the lemon replacement, which was refreshing but no match for this. Don't remember the pairing, but I'm pretty sure I was ranting aloud about natural wine by that point.Despite all of my nits above, I really enjoyed the food here. It is an absolutely exceptional value for $74. They're serving top notch, creative dishes. We left full and happy.The big disappointment holding me back here is the wine pairing. I don't think of myself as a natural wine hater; I've enjoyed some orange wines in my time and I crave the funk of kombucha. Maybe I need some recalibration in my tastebuds, but most of the wines simply were not good-- very obvious, one-note rubber bombs with little regard for the food pairing, and some tasted oxidized or spoiled. Not worth the $60, other than to get two small humans reasonably soused off of one pairing.Service also needs a touch of work; our server was perfectly polite and presented the wines, but little commentary on the food. I like their low key attitude towards high cuisine, but they could handle a little bit more of ceremony to make it special. Pacing is great, though.Come without hesitation, but skip the pairing.",5,1,2
17,James S.,"New York, NY",12,92,327,3.0,9/7/2018,"I live in the Lower East Side, and after reading about the hype that this place has gotten I decided to travel a block South and finally try out this Michelin-starred restaurant in the neighborhood. My verdict is that it is okay. Maybe worth 3.5 stars because of technique. I remember the chicken being cooked perfectly, though it's still just chicken breast at the end of the day. But like many others have said, no one dish really stood out to me. The closest would be the boudin noir with cooked fig, but I wouldn't come back just for that. I sat at the bar, which I normally don't mind but in this case the bar is not deep enough to provide adequate distance between a) the bartender shaking and mixing up drinks and b) your plate. Like a show at Sea World, splashes are part of the experience. On the surface, it appears like there's some value to be had in that Contra offers six courses for $78; however, portion sizes are a bit small. I didn't leave hungry though, thanks to the sourdough which I believe they make in-house. But with a drink (in my case, Springbank 10 year at $18), tax, and tip, it was easily over $120, which is still kind of pricey. Lastly, be prepared to spend quite a bit of time here - I got in at 6:45 and it took until past 8:30 before the experience was complete.",,,
18,Diana J.,"New York, NY",16,61,16,5.0,10/21/2018,"Loved everything I ordered.Super busy on the weekends, make sure you reserve beforehand.If I'm not mistaken, this place earned a Michelin star in 2018. Atmosphere isn't as upscale as we thought, but the food is of amazing value. I would definitely come back here.",,,
19,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",1032,172,59,5.0,5/10/2018,"Wow wow wow. This restaurant has earned every one of the five stars I'm giving it and it's one of the few restaurants in NYC that I've given a five star rating to. The overall dinner was incredible and the value of the meal was by far the best for a Michelin star restaurant.Service: There wasn't anything special about the service, but it's always a good sign when I don't realize that there is any service. They were seamless in the transition between dishes, always refilled the water before we needed it, and explained every one of the dishes well when they did come. Food: We started out with an amuse bouche which was a shrimp bite and it was delicious! I loved how light and refreshing it was and it was a fantastic start to the meal. The first dish was a seafood crudo with lobster and uni and the consistency and flavors were amazing - I wasn't overpowered by seafood, but at the same time, the seafood flavors were brought out nicely. After this, we got the pancetta and spinach which was one of the surprising courses because I normally don't like pancetta (nor do I normally eat lemon wedges), but the flavors worked really well together and it was a super well balanced dish. The halibut and white asparagus was probably one of the more meh dishes because even though the fish was cooked beautifully, it didn't feel like there was anything exceptional there.However, the beef that followed it was to die for. The juiciness and tenderness of the meat just melted in your mouth and the accompanying sauce made it even better. Definitely one of the best pieces of beef I've had in a long time. Then, to top it off, the desserts were both delicious as well! I'd say I enjoyed the blackberry dessert more than the strawberry and lavender dessert just because it had more interesting flavors, but they definitely contrasted with the flavors of previous dishes and put a great end to the meal.Overall, I'd highly recommend you come because this is probably one of the most worth meals you can have (it's a $78 meal for the 6 courses)!",2,,2
20,Elaine Z.,"New York, NY",481,271,121,5.0,2/21/2018,"It is true that the increasing price of the menu is annoying, but for now I consider Contra one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I find their tasting menu very unique and well-executed in the balance of flavor and creativity. I've come here in a group for the regular menu back in 2017 (when it was $67) and recently again for the pricier but longer Valentine's day menu. Haven't gotten the wine pairing so can't speak on that - ordered a bottle and cocktails each time. The bread is amazing, as many have mentioned, and probably my favorite bread ever. I don't remember the specifics of the meal from last year, but the highlight of this year was the blissfully buttery Long Island duck with leg fat wrapped in morels and the apple semifreddo with lemon meringue. The cod was cooked perfectly as well. I think both experiences started with an amuse bouche involving a chip or some sort which was crisped to perfection. The main draw for me is how intentional all of the ingredients are and the fact that there are really not many dishes like them out there.I will say the somm on Valentine's was not very good and recommended some wines incorrectly based on our specifications, but we ended up happy with the bottle she picked. I also found the last dessert too chocolate and moussey for my taste. Overall, I'm still going to highly recommend Contra to anyone looking for a Michelin star experience and a different take on New American.",21,8,19
21,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,230,306,4.0,9/23/2017,"The price of their tasting menu keeps going up, so get to it while it's still (mostly) a good deal.Stopped in on a Friday night after our initial plans of Wildair next door were waylaid by a 90 minute wait (should've seen that coming), but at Contra it was only 40 minutes. Hey, we'll take it. The now-six-course tasting menu costs $74 and changes regularly, but you can get an idea of the ingredients from the photos below.Standouts for me were the first two courses - tomato wrapped with sweet potato leaves, with nasturtium, cilantro, lime; and the Sorana beans in cucumber sauce, with uni, bread crumbs, and micro greens. They highlighted the inventiveness Contra's now known for, doing it so well that each dish had many complementary flavors and textures in one. Very impressive.After that, the courses were less memorable though still very good. I think they still strove for unique combinations but with less success - sometimes the dish felt more like separate components compiled onto one plate (beef course), or standard despite the dazzling array of interesting individual ingredients (mackerel course), or just didn't work that well (miso parfait, though maybe just my personal tastes).Perhaps an odd comment, but I thought the mechanics of the dessert courses were rather eater-unfriendly. For the grape and pistachio ice cream, for instance, we were given thick wooden spoons to eat with - a lovely touch, but seemed a very counterintuitive instrument to eat a delicate dessert with as the blunted spoon made it difficult to slice through the ice cream.   For the miso parfait, we were thankfully given normal spoons, but it was hard to eat as well since the smashed fig on top was also hard to cut through, causing the parfait underneath to slide around and ultimately ploop out the other end. Again, still good, just didn't make for the best eating experience.Loved the wine though - we got glasses of the natural wine they're known for stocking, and maybe we just got lucky with our random selections but they were delicious and also quite a bit stronger than your typical wines! For reference, we had the Emma and Metisse.Wait times between courses were surprisingly long, often 20-25 minutes. It was a busy evening I know, but 25 minutes in-between already small courses made the dinner seem quite disjointed overall. We finished each dish very quickly so there was a lot of dead time; the entire dinner lasted almost three hours for just six courses.Overall, Contra didn't fall in my list of restaurants worth making a dedicated, out-of-your-way kind of visit to, but I do still want to try Wildair.",1,,2

I love how knowledgeable our server was - she knew exactly what to pair for this month's tasting menu. As for the food, I cannot believe how balanced all the dishes were - you got sweet, savory, vinegar, and sour in just about each bite. Also, I'm a pescatarian, so I emailed in advance to see if they could switch the pork for a vegetarian or seafood dish instead, and voila! Contra served me the best prepared slate I've ever had!

While each dish was fantastic, I wouldn't say any of them blew me away with the exception of the ""strawberry, vanilla"" dessert. Perhaps I was too hyped before going but I expected just a little more detail in some of the dishes. Nonetheless, it was still a worthwhile experience. Best dishes: strawberry, vanilla dessert and razor clam, tripe, vin jaune appetizer.General:Contra staff were extremely accommodating when I needed to make an alteration to my reservation the week I went. After arriving, our group was seated immediately. Quarters aren't cramped but you are definitely seated closely to other patrons. There is only one restroom so there's usually a small line waiting to use it. Service from the waiters was great but the pacing between dishes threw me off. I had to wait extremely long for some dishes to come.Food:Throughout the meal, I enjoyed how soft, smooth or chewy textures were paired with crunchy and crisp ones. Umami flavors were frequently complemented with more acidic or sweeter ones (seems like every modern restaurant uses some sort of pickled vegetable or fruit to spice up each dish now). However, small things kind of bothered me throughout the meal. I wish they gave a little more than the tiniest dollop of uni in one of the appetizers and the halibut was served at this lukewarm temperature. I would've enjoyed how tender the fish was if the dish were just slightly hotter! The strawberry vanilla dessert stole the show though. It started off tart but melted into a sweet and salty finish in your mouth. Incredible.Overall summary back up top!",2,2,2
25,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1048,236,5.0,11/12/2017,"I came here for their $74 tasting menu on a Friday night - and I will say it's definitely one of the better value tasting menus I've had. There are six courses, and I believe the menu changes up every now and then. Almost every course was well composed and balanced. I find that the more courses a menu has, the more likely something is to go wrong - and Contra hit the mark on almost everything.I had a glass of wine which was so flavorful I could have sipped it on its own - a Matassa Blanc that went very well with several dishes, so it was a good substitute for the wine pairing.I had a couple of gripes though: the skate dish was served in a bowl, which teeter-tottered when you're trying to cut through it with a fork and knife. I really wish the UX of my eating experience was a bit more thoughtfully considered.I also thought the skin on the guinea Jen dish was a little tough to cut through - but fortunately it was flavorful and crisp in the mouth.The desserts were really delicious - it ended off with a hazelnut grape concoction, which reminded me simultaneously of PB&J and Ferrero Rocher.There was a sourdough bread course somewhere in there too.I do think the restaurant is a little cramped, so it's not a terribly romantic environment. Food is stellar though.",2,,1

Turnip serves as a smart connection. monkfish, potato, saffron: tender, juicy and aromatic fish. Veal Breast, mushroom and almond: tender and flavorful veal breast. Mushroom brings up the flavor and the almond adds aroma and texture.bitter almond, mandarin: refreshing. Love the fine texture and taste profile. Amazing presentation with sophisticated yet harmonious tastes.Overall, like this place a lot. 6 courses is a bit unsatisfying would recommend adding bread or cheese.

Between the wine pairings and the diverse courses, we were crawling to the finish line by the time dessert was served.

These were not met to say the least. We had the dinner tasting menu and were really underwhelmed. The food was not tasty at all. We didn't even finish our dishes. The service was slow, and one dish after another was really disappointing. The only good part of the dinner was the bread. We spent about $250 for this dinner for two and really would be happier to eat a pizza for $5 given the level of the dishes we were served. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.",,,

So the flavors are interesting and seem to be well thought out but they are just ok. The title of my review should be just ok. There was no flavor explosion or memorable course and usually those are my indicators for a good meal. We left feeling just the right amount full and tbh the best thing about the meal was the sourdough bread. I would traded a course for another serving of the bread.,,,
33,Anna P.,"New York, NY",29,37,16,5.0,2/4/2018,"New York is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another place of another time. Not at Contra. The chefs offer original dishes that feel understated, personal and modern. The food is prepared artfully. Each dish is aesthetically pleasing and the flavors are subtle. There is careful preparation that goes in all the dishes and the quality of the food is unbeatable. My husband and I have decided it is one of our new favorite restaurants, a culinary experience that leaves you feeling satisfied, without feeling stuffed. Additionally, the wine pairing was inventive and a perfect complement to the meal. The wines were unusual, but approachable, and created an added dimension to the overall experience.  You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting menus, but the format suits Contra's food unusually well.",3,,1

36,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,4.0,12/13/2016,"It took Contra two years to grasp the Michelin star, after earning two stars from NY times when it first opened back in 2014; however it certainly did not take that long for Contra to demonstrate its uniqueness in defining contemporary American cuisine. While it only serves a six-course tasting menu which changes every quarter, so as to better make use of the seasonal ingredients, the restaurant definitely has shown a wider variety of skillset, way beyond those six courses.  Making use of ingredients as simple as lobster, fish (halibut) and beef, Contra nevertheless focused on creating complexed flavors. Thus if you are looking for raw flavors coming right out of the meat itself, you are choosing the wrong place. Having said that,  Contra actually did a good job in combining the raw material with the sauces. Desserts were another highlight of the meal - Contra was able to focus on small items - marshmallow, dried cranberry. Don't overlook on those bites, as they could really bring up the tastes!Six courses ended quickly and I still felt a bit unsatisfied.",9,4,10

38,Rodney F.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,11,6,3.0,2/16/2018,"I have some contraindications about Contra. Contra was good but not exceptional. The tasting menu is fairly affordable so you get what you pay for. During our meal, we had the same iteration of the same textures nothing special or innovative. The standout item was the bread! It was soft, warm and had a phenomenal crust. The sourdough bread is outstanding. One of the dishes we were presented which was the guinea hen was dry and not very flavourful. I didn't hate my meal just felt it was overhyped. We didn't find  wine list well curated or suited to the menu either.",1,,
39,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,185,527,4.0,12/11/2016,"Solid 4.5 stars. Came here on a Saturday night.  The space has a nice, causal and rustic vibe, but smaller than I had anticipated. There is however plenty of space between tables so you don't feel cramped. One major con - there's only 1 bathroom stall so there was always a line.The prix fixe menu is a great deal.  For $67 per person you each get 6 courses + amuse bouche to start. For $8 (total not per person) you get an additional cheese course and if you get the $55 wine pairing (which we did) the cheese course also comes with a beer (or if you're gluten free a Chenin Blanc). Bread costs $3 extra, seems weird, but my boyfriend has a gluten allergy anyways so we skipped bread. Overall a pretty nice value for what you get. Now onto the food and wine.Amuse bouche. A savory bite sized tart, with caramelized onion, fish roe, and, creme fraiche. There was a nice saltiness from the roe that balances the creaminess. My boyfriend got an oyster as a substitute gluten free option.First course. Cabbage salad, with a poached oyster and anise.  This was delicious and had a nice French onion dip like flavor. There was a nice crunchiness, some tarragon and a smoked tea flavor as well.  The wine pairing was an Austrian unfiltered semi sweet white, full body, more like a cider or beer than a wine.Second course.  Lobster, Kobocha (squash), and brown butter. Don't be fooled, this isn't traditional poached lobster, it's a lobster sausage, which although delicious was a bit deceiving since it was not what I was expecting.  The sliced squash and sweetness from what I think was a pear added a nice balance to the dish, and the sauce was amazing as well, I wish they gave you a spoon for this course! The pairing was an unfiltered Slovenian white, very Bold flavor, like plum juice almost.Third course. Olive oil poached halibut, capers and celery leaf. I don't normally like fish, but this was perfectly cooked and had an amazing creaminess to it that went well with the lemon flavor and capers. The pairing was a northern rhone white, which complemented the dish perfectlyFourth course. NY strip streak with pickled fruit and peppers. This almost tasted like a Philly cheese steak with the peppers and red onion, but obviously much more amazing. The steak was also cooked to a nice medium rare, though NY strip isn't my favorite cut of beef. For the pairing - red finally!  It was from France, half Cabernet, half Grenache and was delicious.Fifth course. Order the extra cheese course, its a shredded cheese with a nice creamy sauce under and comes with crackers.  There was a minor hiccup with the cheese course. They forgot my boyfriend was gluten free and so they brought us the pairing of beer and poured it for both of us and the dish had crackers on it. But once we flagged the mistake, they just brought us an extra plate of cheese and gave him a glass of wine so we each  basically got our own cheesey plate and I got almost a whole beer.Sixth course. First dessert course was very whimsical. It's confusing to the senses, feels like you're eating popcorn but it has a nice coldness from the apple ice and was crispy only in certain bites.  The pairing was a Muscat, fortified, with just the right amount of sweetness.Seventh course. I'm not a big ice cream person but this was amazing.  It was a mix of very creamy coconut and cherry ice cream with pieces of dried fruit mixed in, consistency was like panna cotta . The pairing was in my opinion gross, it basically tasted like cough syrup but was somehow extremely bitter and difficult to drink.I think this place definitely deserves its Michelin star, and the prices are very reasonable for what you get.  I would not get the pairing next time, and would've just opted to get a nice bottle of wine (red) that we could enjoy during the meal.",4,1,1
40,Claire M.,"Long Beach, NY",51,29,0,4.0,12/3/2017,"To echo many of the reviewers here, the tasting menu at Contra was technically solid but with only a few wow's. Out of the 6 dishes plus an amuse bouche, I would say that three of them were memorable, and two of those were the desserts. However, everything was good across the board, and the atmosphere is great for a more upscale ""treat yourself"" type of night with friends. The service was excellent, although there were some awkward lags between dishes.The two desserts we had were some of the best I have had at a restaurant. The apple and brown butter dish was so interesting - it's one of those dishes where you keep discovering something new with each bite. The mandarin and popcorn dish was exciting and zesty, too. We all agreed the skate was the best of the savory dishes, and the side of beans were delicious. The scallop dish was pretty forgettable, as was the beef shortrib, but the squid dish was interesting because it was prepared like pasta in a tasty broth.Overall, eating at Contra was a very enjoyable experience but didn't blow me away.

The hen was melt in your mouth delicious and the buckwheat dish was nothing my mouth had ever tasted before - lots of incredible flavours.

We added the cheese course which I highly recommend. If you are a drinker of wine, the wine pairing will be more economical.

In a town where meal at a diner can cost $30+ before tax and tip, the $78 prix fixe menu seems like a bargain. Service was friendly and efficient but not pretentious.

So we rushed to a taxi and as soon as we knew we would be able to arrive before 10 based on google map, we called them again to make sure and the answer was the same - as long as we can arrive at 10, we would have the table. After riding in the taxi for about 15 mins (around 9:25), a male manager who also answered our calls previously called and told us that we should not come because they don't have any more tables. His voice was also rude and didn't apologize for his inconsistency at all.

Why give bread if there are no bread plates. Also the bathroom was pretty sloppy looking and bare bones.  The first 3 courses were good but the hen had red in it. I've never eaten bloody meat like that but the waiter said it was supposed to be like that.  I just ate around the bloody parts.  I could hear the guy next to us complaining about the food.

I booked this for my girlfriend's birthday as something semi casual and trendy but Michelin quality. We were running pretty late but Contra was able to accomodate us (I called a few times letting them know where we were).The interior is decently trendy in the Lower East Side. I didn't really see much of a dress code for the patrons, but if there is one, it's not much. Michelin places tend to sway not on that side, so it's good to see. I also enjoy the fact that they have a bar area so you can just probably walk in and enjoy a drink.Of course, the menus change quite a bit so what we had is mostly not there anymore, but it was good. I don't think it was perfect, but good enough to remember them. Some of the standouts to me was the scallop mousse, halibut, fig miso ice cream, and I think the coconut dessert. Also the cheese plate was quite a surprise. I love cheese, but wasn't thinking of actually getting it. It was sheep and cow's cheese grated a bit over a thin layer of red eye gravy (with cofffee in it). Damn, what a combination. Never would have thought of that one, but it worked so well. Delicious. They had a nice drink list too full of some nice and not so common wines, with cocktails too.Overall, it was a good dinner. I'd definitely come back as it was definitely above average food and service.",4,4,5

The only option at Contra is the tasting menu - but truly everything is delicious and there were a few dishes with unique ingredients as well on the night I came. I usually don't like at least one thing on a tasting menu, but I finished everything at Contra with gusto. Particular highlights were:- crab and uni with kohlrabi (German turnip) and sabayon (mixture of white wine, egg yolks, sugar); there was a thin, pale oval-shaped slice of root vegetable  over the crab and uni that made the dish look like a jelly fish/sea creature of sorts. In this way, the dish was a visual representation of what it tasted like, which was cool!- a cold/semi-frozen yogurt sprinkled with amaranth and buckwheat, which added a slightly sweet crunch to the refreshing yogurt.- the skate was paired nicely with a complimentary glass of white wine. - a cut of beef that was cooked perfectly; the meat was evenly pink-red throughout.The service was great, just attentive enough and very courteous and friendly.  Also great that they don't overbook the restaurant so you feel like you have some space and quiet to talk. 5 stars for a tasting menu that won me over with every dish and nice service.",3,2,2

Everything is local/organic and much is plant based. I did the tasting menu and everything that came to me was like a magical piece of art. Flavors are subtle, and I even said to myself, ""This is what these ingredients are meant to taste like."" Overall very natural, and fun to try.Could also be a great date spot.

Updated review","Contra recently received a well-deserved 1 Michelin star, and with its $74 6-course tasting menu, is one of the jewels of NYC! I've been dining at Contra for 2 1/2 years and have been extremely impressed with its always delicious and creative menus. The menus change every few weeks, and it is exciting to see all of the changes. One never gets bored with the cuisine. Service is welcoming, attentive and friendly. The bread is among the best in NYC!",2,,

Everything was very good (scallops, mackerel, chicken).However charging $3 for the bread is quite insulting, and not sitting parties that are not complete infuriates me.

67,Tiffany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",321,547,459,4.0,1/25/2016,"fairly small, narrow space but laid back and casual. They have a pre fixe menu for $67. The wine pairing is an extra $55. Most people get the bread which is an extra $3 (and plenty enough to share between 2 people) The cheese is $8 and served right before dessert.My guest and i had the wine pairing and bread. it's definitely enough food as long as you're not absolutely starving. The courses came out pretty fast (as did the wine) We made fun of the wine labels; mostly because it had questionable designs on them, (one had 2 mice, and the other looked liked an image of a burglar). The wine itself DID pair well with the food but I wouldn't drink 1/2 of them on its own. 2 of them had a very smokey flavor; 1 was super floral, 1 was overly sweet (the second to last dessert wine pairing). The rest were pretty good; i'd say my favorite was a white I think was from france but I don't remember the name :(As for the food; everything was tasty. No complaints. But nothing was stellar either. Out of everything, my favorite was actually the complimentary bite we had before the meal started. I don't remember what it was but I could've probably had a cookie tray full of it. here's the menu for jan 2016:-Scallop, broccoli, bread sauce (2nd favorite item. fresh scallop, interesting flavors)-Collards, potato, mussel (fyi - more like mussel flavor, no actual pieces of mussel)-Monkfish, brussel spouts, seaweed (good, but i've had better fish)-Pork shoulder, squash, hazelnut (no complaints, nice touch with the hazelnut)-Vanilla parfait, tangerine curd (YUM and light)-Banana ice cream, chocolate cremeux, caramel (its like a ice cream sandwich!)overall, a pretty good meal.

Fit for foodies for sure, but if you aren't go with an open mind and try it all, I promise you won't be disappointed. It's not as formal as we had thought it was going to be- so don't worry about dressing up, you can come in jeans or whatever you wish. Excellent service, and incredible dining experience.

Updated review","KenScale: 8.5/10I've been so many great restaurants in NYC, and there are a few that I keep thinking about and try to re-visit at least once every year. Contra is definitely one of them. While I haven't always had the perfect dining experience (my first visit was absolute show-stopper, while my second visit was somewhat mixed), the way the kitchen uses different ingredients in some ingenious fashion always made Contra an intriguing restaurant that I would be happy to bring my friends every once in a while. When a foodie friend visited from out of town, I figured it is now time to show him what Contra brings to the table. While not all dishes were perfect, I still saw the flow of creative energy that makes Contra such a fascinating restaurant.The tasting menu, which is now $67 per person for six courses, is still one of the best bargains in the city. Don't be afraid to spend extra $3 for bread which is absolutely fantastic. The first course of salad consisting of blueberry, nasturtium and sorrel was a little bit too citrusy for my taste, but the second course of clam, agretti and potato cream had very nice balance of flavor and texture (even though not everyone at the table loved it). I wished the swordfish that came with seaweed and tomato were grilled with slightly less seasoning but the fish was otherwise quite well cooked to fully display its unique texture that I had grown to love over time. The best savory course was the veal with onions and hay. The meat was more or less perfectly cooked and the seasoning quite even throughout the meat, and the way the ingredients worked together made it such an elegant dish, even more so with its splendid plating. Just like my last visit, the desserts were a little bit more successful. I still can't forget the refreshing blend of elderflower, pistachio and milk that everyone at my table savored with happiness, and the peach ice cream with herbs was also delightful without being overly sweet. Both dishes were simply perfect for summer season with the refreshing sensation that was quite memorable to my taste bud.I wish the restaurant keeps more wine selections that are not natural or biodynamic; I'm unfortunately not a huge fan of these types of wine. The casual, hip vibe of the restaurant reflecting the ethos of Lower East Side is still there. Contra will not always wow you in terms of execution, but the playful approach of the kitchen is really what separates this place from other fancy restaurants and why I will keep coming back.",5,1,3
72,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",59,467,2648,5.0,1/30/2016,"We had a really amazing dinner here. Everything was fantastic -- food, service, atmosphere, etc. It's definitely not at the level of some of the extremely high end tasting menus in the city, but for the price you're paying here, that shouldn't be the expectation -- it's less than half of the price of places that I would say are comparable quality-wise, and an even smaller fraction of the highest end places. Here's how I'd rank the courses we got:1) Scallop, broccoli, bread sauce2) Gouda, toast, Asian pear, fennel3) Vanilla parfait, tangerine4) Pork shoulder, squash, tardivo5) Potato, walnut, mint6) Bread7) Raspberry ice cream (we weren't sure if this was ice cream, but it was awesome)8) Cookie with creme fraiche and trout roe9) Banana, peanuts, dried cherries10) Tilefish, celery root, seaweedThe only thing that we didn't absolutely love was the tilefish. Everything else was really great, and we were very full at the end. (We had sort of kicked around the idea of getting the chocolate tart next door at Wildair afterwards if we still had room, but we were stuffed.)Just a really great experience. I would highly recommend.",,1,
73,Sam H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,48,27,4.0,8/13/2017,"I've been here a couple of times, and I was more or less blown away my first time particularly by their bread and butter (both of which I believe are made in-house). Unfortunately, the bread and butter no longer seems to be on their menu? It was my absolute favorite. For the plates you get, I think the price is reasonable. I also like to eat (mostly) clean, meaning that I don't like too much heavy cream, oil, etc., and their dishes are usually good in that regard. The only gripe I might have would be that I once made reservations for Valentine's Day almost two months ahead of time that accommodated my partner's seafood and nut allergies and I was promised that they wouldn't be a problem only to have our reservation cancelled two hours before scheduled. The manager promised to make it up to us next time, but when we went in later nothing was done. Overall, it's worth a try.",,,
74,Matthew S.,"Manhattan, NY",161,70,84,2.0,3/19/2017,"Had a pretty ""meh""/bordering on bad meal here in a lot of respects. A lot of the aspects of the meal were remarkably inconsistent in a way that really detracted from the overall dining experience.Reservation process: Fairly rigid. Bookable through the Reserve App or on their website. Parties up to 6 are accepted during weeknights and 4 on the weekends. There is a $67 no show fee and a strict 15 minute late policy that results in the same $67 penalty. This was a bit intimidating, especially given that the restaurant is pretty far off the beaten path for people not wanting to take the subway. The saving grace of this is that the $67 penalty can be used as a credit for future visits.Ambiance: Very hip and trendy space with a mellow mid 2000's indie-rock playlist humming in the background. Attire of choice is smart-casual and it is a long and narrow space with wooden tables and booth seating along the wall. A bit tight but not cramped.Service: Remarkably inconsistent service. The first thing I noticed when sitting down was that the table was filthy and sticky in front of my seat (pretty gross in my humble opinion). I actually dipped the corner of my napkin in my water glass and tried to scrub the mess out of the table and the staff did nothing to help. The time between the first and second course was about 45 minutes which left me feeling starving. I had already polished off my wine pairing (which was kindly refilled) well before the second appetizer was ready. They also charge for bread which I find to be rather ""cheap"". I'd rather pay more for the prix fixe and not know I was paying for bread. It's usually complimentary and I refused to opt-in on principle. To their credit, the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Food: Also inconsistent. The radish, cabbage, and beet appetizer had a trout foam on it that was too bland to elevate the dish. This dish generally just tasted like crunchy water as there was no earthiness, sweetness, acid, bitterness, or anything of note. By the time the second course came, I was incredibly hungry and a bit tipsy as I had only had a bowl of radish slices and wine in the hour and 15 minutes since I had sat down. The rest of the dishes were generally a lot better with some exceptions. I was underwhelmed by the monkfish dish, and the crab appetizer was good but a bit odd. The main course of pork shoulder, celeriac, and citrus was quite delicious and every ingredient complimented every other ingredient well, and the dessert of banana ice cream with strawberry foam and rye cake was excellent. Additionally the optional cheese dish came with sumac crackers and was really delicious. Mind you that portions are very small. If I hadn't opted in to the cheese dish I would've left both extremely disappointed and extremely hungry. I probably could've used some McDonald's afterwards to make myself feel full (don't worry, it's just around the corner). Overall impression: Completely shocked that it earned a Michelin star. While it is a ""good value"" for what you're getting, it is not a full meal's worth of food. It disappointed from a service standpoint, and the food did not compensate for that. If you like healthier/inventive food and would like an expensive snack, then this place would be great for you. I do not anticipate returning, and from a management perspective I would be rather embarrassed by the experience that was created for me.",3,6,2

The combination of citrus, saline, and crisp tartness. The place is quite sexy and was a good choice for a date.  The wait staff was attentive.  Some food runners were better at describing the dishes than others.  Food: We tried the housemade bread with the housemade butter for an extra ($3). it was warm, crusty, and delicious. First Course: The center of a whole gem lettuce stalk covered with Milkweed dressing and Parmesan cheese. It was crisp, creamy, and salty.Second Course: Thinly sliced yellow and green summer squash covering a freshly piece of burrata with sorrel. The squash was delicious but the sorrel was not my favorite flavor.  The burrata was rich, creamy, and buttery.  Third Course: Spaghetti-Cut Squid, English Peas, Lardon in a pea and squid ink sauce.  This was most interesting dish.  The squid was firm but not chewy. Fourth Course: seared and then chopped Scallops, Fava Bean, with a rhubarb juice. Scallops are so hard to get right. However they hit a homerun on these sea creatures. Fifth Course: Thick rare Beef Ribeye with pistachio, radicchio, and micro bull's blood. The steak was nicely cooked but cooked slighlty unevenly.  The rare center was more to one side than the other.Sixth Course: Dessert #1: Sour Cream Ice Cream with a dehydrated crisp in a sweet cherry sauce and tapioca. I really like the tart and sweet combination.  The texture differences between the elements really made this dish come alive.Seventh Course: Dessert #2: Candied Peaches, Sweet Cream and Corn, Angelica. This play on peaches and cream was spectacular.Overall, an enjoyable 2.5 hour dining experience.",4,2,2

For the price, the environment was shockingly casual and the service not particularly attentive.It's tough to remember every dish but there are a few that were very good:The sous vide pork was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The fat melted like butter on the warmth of my palate.The scallop was very large and delicately prepared. It respected the flavor of the sea. The briny earthiness of the scallop shined.

78,Jade R.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,216,0,1.0,7/20/2017,"Coming out of the ether to write a review, I haven't written one in years.Contra has a really interesting concept, given my interpretation is correct: both my boyfriend and I felt an emotional impact from every dish. The food invoked a sense of nostalgia, but also the unfamiliar and new. Ex: The cheese plate (during my tasting menu) is a grated cheese on a plate where you use these ""chips"" to scoop it up. It's reminiscent of chips and dip, which I think most Americans can relate to in some way. But it's also new and unexpected as one would not expect to eat cheese like that. It's playful and interesting.Here's what I didn't like:1. Personally, I was not a fan of the main protein dish, which was a pork loin. While it did invoke a memory, it did not invoke it for a good reason: I thought of Thanksgiving and how the meat we cook is never perfectly done. It's always over or under. And that's how the pork tasted. It felt undercooked in that the texture was really chewy and raw feeling, and overcooked because somehow it was still a little dry. 2. Desserts also invoked emotion, but they did not really make me super happy taste wise. But I'm personally not a huge fan or meringue, so it's just a personal thing. My boyfriend thought the ice cream was a little tasteless.3. We were one of the first people to arrive, and two parties (both white) were sat on either side of us. Both parties arrived after us. They were served first. We were served last. This isn't the first time I've experienced racism in New York restaurants, but I didn't expect it from a place like this.

While we were in NYC, we went with a big group of friends for a birthday. This place did not disappoint as each dish that came out you knew the chefs had talent to make delicious food! I believe they recently were awarded with best new chefs in Food and Wine! kudos!The restaurant has a tasting menu of a variety of small dishes that seemed to maintain its infusion of creativity while attacking all your taste buds. My favorites were the ceviche and mackerel (not fishy and just made me forget I was eating fish). The chicken dish was also out of this world. I don't know what the chefs do to the food but please keep it up! It's amazing. It's like getting slapped in the face and liking it and wanting more!! Definitely a place to go in NYC that is not pretentious and the quality of what you get at their price is well worth it! Oh and the service was beyond exceptional. 8 of us sat at the bar while also getting great interaction with the best bartender! Totally forgot her name but she made our experience drinking cocktails educational and fun! Doesn't hurt that she takes pride in making the drinks while genuinely just a nice person!

81,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,453,363,4.0,6/17/2015,"Ok, when I saw the first dish (the starter) -  one small piece of cucumber with a whipped tarragon and dill sauce - I was a little worried since I had been saving my appetite / calories the entire day in anticipation of the 7 course tasting menu.Since we didn't feel right about getting bread at the time for an extra $3 (the cheese $8 extra) we didn't have anything to soak up the sauce with, as the cucumber didn't really hold a lot of it. Even though I don't eat bread it just didn't sit right with me that they would charge extra for it in a chef's tasting menu. Actually, on second thought, it works quite well for those like me who never touch the bread basket but the cost of the bread is probably included in the meal...  but I felt bad for my bf who looked famished.Anyway, I wasn't crazy about this dish... but my hope was things would get better.Next up was summer squash, burrata and sorrel - 5 thin slices of squash with cheese and a green sauce that was quite delicious. This dish was fresh and tasty but also pretty tiny. By this time I was filling up on water since it was starting to seem like I would leave hungry.3 entrees:Next was the best dish of the night - squid, english peas, walnut (which I didn't detect at all) and lardo (basically 2 thin slices of lard or fat, which I didn't eat). The squid, covered in a squirt or ink, was delicious and reminded me of spaghetti, which I haven't had in a very long time (ya know, avoiding carbs and all)After the squid was scallop, fava beans and rhubard (not pictured). This was light and yummy but lukewarm.The last main meal was the rib eye, pistachio and treviso. The bitter taste of the treviso balanced well with the sweet sauce and the rib eye was a lot rarer than I would prefer my meat (which I only eat on very special occasions. I should note my bf told them no peanuts or red meat when making his reservation but I guess they didn't really pay attention to that). Still, the meat was quite tasty and my tummy was starting to feel heavier, thank god.The two dessert dishes which had very vague descriptions on the menu:first up was a scoop of honey ice cream with peaches and olive oil. There were some small round gelatin balls and the texture/taste really reminded me of porridge.Lastly, was the strawberries and corn, as listed on the menu. My bf thought it would be cornbread with strawberries and I thought it would be just boiled kernels of corn with some type of strawberry syrup. We were both wrong: the last dish was strawberry granita (crushed ice) with corn mousse, 2 small pieces of raspberry and I think some ground up corn flakes or toasted corn. The strawberry and raspberry packed a powerful taste/flavor and the entire dish reminded me of an odd combination of corn flakes and fruit loops in milk. Both my bf and I didn't care for it too much when we started eating it but by the end (when you got a little bit of all the flavors on your spoon) it actually tasted quite good.The service was ok (not extra attentive - but we generally don't like hovering waitstaff), and slowed as the restaurant filled. We dined for approximately 2 hours, 15 minutes and at the end of the night I was pretty satisfied without feeling stuffed thanks to the lightness of each dish. Oh, and my bf did end up springing for the extra bread in the end, which was the only reason he felt full when we finished",2,,

My friend and I arrived at Contra at 6 pm on a Friday night without a reservation. There's open seating at the bar, so we sat there for our meal (the bar was empty when we arrived). The menu on the night we were there was as follows:--potato, seaweed, brassica--crab, black trumpet, sabayon*--skate, celery, almond*--beef, umeboshi, piparras--bitter almond, meyer lemon, cucumber*--grains, yogurtCourses marked with asterisks were my favorites, but everything was good. They excel at unique flavor combinations that work together well and create complex tastes as you eat. For example, the bitter almond, meyer lemon, and cucumber dish was a dessert, which you wouldn't necessarily expect from that combination of ingredients. Somehow all those flavors worked perfectly together to create a stand-out dessert that had just the right mix of savory and sweet notes. A couple of the courses seemed overly salty to me, but I frequently have that complaint at restaurants. I thought 6 courses was plenty of food. I left feeling full, but not stuffed and definitely not hungry. You can also add bread and cheese to the 6 courses, but we opted not to.I just had martinis to drink, but they were excellent. Also, the restaurant wasn't too loud and was low-key. We thought about leaving after dinner to go to a bar, but decided to stay and get another drink at Contra since we were already at the bar and had seats.

Contra is also super accommodating for vegans/vegetarians - my friend called ahead and asked if they could swap my meat course and they were more than happy to (more fish - scoreeeee). Absolute must at least once",1,,
88,Jen L.,"San Francisco, CA",130,518,505,4.0,4/25/2016,Delicious and cute tasting menu. It's cool that they have a set tasting menu and only offer that so it does away with the struggle of having to decide exactly what dishes you want. The portions aren't that big and we also got the bread appetizer as well to be satisfied but not entirely full. I was already not that hungry from lunch but it definitely wasn't enough to completely make my boyfriend full. The biggest downside would have to be how they stretch the time between courses to be so longg so you're literally left there waiting for a while. Would have been better if there was a shorter waiting time in between courses.,1,,1
89,Pelin C.,"New York, NY",20,121,88,5.0,10/12/2017,Wow what an experience. The food is total surprise as it is a tasting concept. Every single dish tasted from another world and even the bean dish tasted like heaven and i hate beans. The desserts were the best I've ever had. I would definitely go back. It is a different experience than going into a good random restaurant. If you are looking for a different experience this is the place!,,,
90,Emily R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,9,0,5.0,10/26/2017,I have been here twice and was very happy both times. I can't remember what I had but I love to recommend this place when friends are looking for a place to eat. It's also a good back up if you don't get into wild air. The pricing is also very reasonable.,,,
91,Dan P.,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",146,287,439,4.0,6/24/2017,"There's a set, six-course menu for $74, an option for a wine pairing. The menu doesn't give you a lot, it's one of those places that just lists 2-3 ingredients, so you have no idea what you're really getting. I'm not going to go through the menu plate by plate, just the ones that stood out. Service, for the most part, was great - fantastic bartender - I'd arrived early and was looking at the extensive, quirky wine list, and wines by the glass, and asked her just to pick out a glass for me that she thought was ""unusual and fun"". She poured me a glass of an unfiltered ""natural"" Aleatico rosé from Le Coste (Gianmarco Antonuzzi) that was earthy, funky, fruity, even a touch of a spritz to it, delicious. We were off to a good start. (And, I picked a bottle for the table to cover us through dinner, the Domaine des Marnes Blanches Poulsard 2015 from Côtes du Jura, a lighter, but very complex red that I thought would work through the various courses, without knowing exactly what they were. It did, thankfully!)Our primary waitress was sort of another story - as we gathered at the bar, two of us already with wine/cocktail, the third just getting his, she approached and asked if we had a reservation (we'd already checked in with someone else). Then she gathered a trio of menus and asked us if we were ready to go to the table. The bartender said something to the effect of letting us finish our cocktails at the bar, to which she looked at us and said, ""you know, your reservation IS for 6:30 p.m."" (it was 6:29). So we gathered our drinks and followed her. She continued to be sort of snippy each time she came to the table, blurting out what the dishes were quickly, with a condescending tone as if she expected we wouldn't have a clue anyway and turning away without acknowledgement.Things came to a head over bread. Each table gets a small loaf of bread, a sort of boule, to share, and some whipped butter. With three of us at the table, we went through it quickly, and asked her for another. She paused, and said, ""if you want another, that will be $3"". I'd had enough at that point and snapped back, ""does that include more butter?"" which set her back, and for the rest of the meal, we seemed to be more often attended to by other waiters. One note - I get that bread is a line item for restaurants. But you're serving the same sized boule to tables of one as tables for four, and for the former, it'd be plenty, for the latter, unlikely, and that's not really fair to bigger parties. Just something to think about, it's not like $3 was going to ruin any of us financially, but it was an off-note, especially when paying $74 for a menu. We did get sent an extra dessert to try by one of the other waiters.... all of whom, by the way, were delightful and friendly.My favorite course - a smoked rhubarb puree on the bottom, then a tangle of lightly dressed calamari, topped with a thin julienne of white asparagus, thin sheets of lardo, and what we decided were some sort of seasoned breadcrumbs.I think the favorite course of my companions, and a close second for me - perfectly cooked halibut with a green peppercorn sauce, a little quenelle of yuba emulsion (tofu ""skin""), and the green planks are, if I followed correctly and my eyes don't deceive me, sort of sheets of scales made from pressed green onions.Yum all around, and other than the one waitress who clearly wanted to be anywhere else but at work that evening (it wasn't just us, she was being that way with all the tables around us too), a great experience. I would note that we were still at least a little peckish at the end of the meal, though not really hungry. Worth the price? Yes, I think so, especially given that there are plenty of places in town that for a similar menu charge far more.",2,2,1
92,Vinnie S.,"New York, NY",0,3,3,1.0,1/20/2018,"Ok so here is the issue...if this restaurant was a non-Michelin star restaurant it would be good. The issue is that it is a Michelin Star restaurant with just ok food. Nothing on the menu to wow you. Complete crap compared to other Michelin restaurant. Menu was dull and lacked any depth of flavor. For the love of god who pouches Tuna??? The crab tasted like they opened a can of crab from the grocery store and dumped it on your plate. The desert had zero flavor. The drinks were over ambitious; ie. too much bitters, etc.  The scallop was non-existent and plan as could be, I mean how do you ruin the flavor of scallops? The veal had zero flavor. STAY away if your are expected Michelin quality....hopefully they lose their star soon.",1,,

Splendid food, great professional service all around and a wine list deserving it's wonderful and creative cuisine. Speaking of which, it was seasonal, modern in a fitting, low key fashion. We had the 5 course prix fixe menu aka the tasting menu, which I highly recommend. Each course was a melody of flavors. All culminating in a magnificent symphony.",,,
95,Tim L.,"London, United Kingdom",63,177,37,2.0,10/9/2015,"The idea that NYC is littered with great tasting menus scintillates the eager London foodie. This place came with raving reviews - both from friends and from the press. Sadly, It doesn't deliver. The food was good, well cooked and executed but the service was rather matter of fact, bordering on cold (this coming from England - Yipes!)Whilst the food is well presented, and well cooked, it shows a lack of ingenuity and almost a laziness of thought. The best dish of the evening was the start of tomatoes with a small dash of a tomato purée and an aguachile sauce. Beautiful, elegant and refreshing after a day's worth of battling the city.  However the rest of the menu was boring. Veal covered in radicchio (or they called it Treviso here) was done sous vide and tasted good, but the excessive bitterness of the leaves almost drew attention away from a well cooked piece of meat. If you're going to sous vide, take the time then to ensure that the rest of the dish is balanced at least. My dinner companions did not end up finishing their course as the leaves were just too bitter. Dessert presented its own challenges here with a home made vanilla ice cream and blackberries. Somewhat interesting were the tapioca pearls that were buried in the dessert, again pleasant but somewhat meh. I mean, isn't a tasting menu supposed to showcase what a chef can do? All in all I was sorely disappointed because expectations ran high. It's not a bad place and the food is definitely decent but certainly adjust your expectations as what has been written about this place sure isn't what it may have been then.",5,3,1
96,lily i.,"Baltimore, MD",32,13,0,2.0,3/5/2018,"While they do attempt to push boundaries and have interesting dishes, several of the courses were just inedible.  It started with a taster consisting of an entire raw shrimp.  The texture was so unappetizing (and yes I eat raw proteins).  The main dish was peasant and while not dangerous it was definitely undercooked.  Highlights were the desserts which were unique combinations of texture and flavor.  The fact that two entire course were completely inedible marred our dining experience.  Would never return nor recommend.",,,

98,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1601,1308,4.0,11/15/2015,"Contra, a New American style restaurant that features a tasting menu only menu, is pretty solid. The service was a little lacking in a few areas, from being a bit hostile about one of our party missing 8 minutes after we were supposed to begin, a little rude about drink orders, and then giving some mediocre wine advice, but definitely improved during the meal and was very good by the end of the night. The drink menu is far larger than the food one because of the tasting menu, with multiple cocktails, a few beers from the bottle, and an extensive wine list. The wine suggested as being full bodied was a bit light and thin to me, but was not bad with the menu. The bread, and add on from the menu, was amazing with a nice thick crispy crust and outstanding salted butter. The cracker with onion and cream served first was a nice palate cleanser and got things started well. The asian pear, walnut and radish was a take on salad a very fresh but seasonal for a chilly day. I don't know what sunchoke is, but it's apparently a tasty veggie that goes great with clam and buttermilk for a creamy dish that made a good transition from salad to fish plate. The textures of this dish were a little mushy, but the flavors were incredible and there was a lot of nice color. The next dish, very heavy on the seafood was a tilefish filet with kohlrabi and trout roe. The trout roe is less flavorful than salmon caviar, and a little less salty which was a good thing on this dish which was just bordering on too salty. The next dish moved into a much heavier place with a delicious strip of beef that was beautifully cooked and seared with an amazing red color in the center. This was definitely the best tasting and most satisfying dish. The veggies were also fairly stout and held up well with the meat as well as feeling right for the season. Moving to dessert, the first of two was a vanilla and blackberry crispy cake with a nice tart fruity taste that wasn't too sweet after the meat. Last was a buckwheat, amanrath, and yogurt dish that was a great palate cleanser and had a bit of a note of sugar smacks cereal which was a nice throwback. This was definitely the stronger of the desserts and about tied with the beef for best course of the meal. The space is fairly spartan and pretty tight, especially the bar, so you're best off hanging out at a nearby bar for a reservation rather than cramming into the tight bar. The space does make it feel a bit more personal and less pretentious though.",2,1,1
99,Maria M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",186,373,174,5.0,9/20/2015,"So I've been to a few tasting menus myself and have never really been disappointed. This place was no exception. Can we just first talk about the atmosphere? How cool is this place? The outside is unassuming. There's no huge sign that points to this place. We almost missed it walking by. It's chic and homey at the same time. The inside is even more welcoming. Wood, bricks, romantic lighting, what more can a girl want? If you're a man reading this... then the lighting is quite manly ;). Anyway, we were greeted right away and because we did take the time to reserve a spot (like that morning on opentable;)), we were seated promptly. The seats are quite close to each other but definitely not cramped so that's good. It took a little while to get our first dish - a snack - and not part of the tasting menu. But we don't get to go out a lot so the extra time together was welcomed. I was in the bathroom when the waiter presented the snack, so I didn't hear what was on the plate. All I know is that it was good. We also ordered the bread which was soft and warm and the butter... Can we have a moment for the homemade butter... I'm not really into butter but this butter was butta' baby. I mean.. It was good. Our first dish was oyster purée with greens and turnip - not bad. I'm not really into oyster but this wasn't fishy at all. Refreshing really. The greens had a slight bitter taste to it which balanced out well with the oyster purée. Second dish was the mushroom, asian pear and herbs. It has a citrusy flavor to it. Kind of like tom yum soup without the spicy-ness. It was sweetened by the pear instead. Loved it. Third dish was the fluke with beans and almond sauce. My third favorite in the tasting menu. Cooked perfectly. And can I just say that there were tiny little tomatoes in this dish that is probably now my favorite tomatoes in the whole world? What is it? Please tell me! Third dish was the sweetbread. Ok well, can I just make a disclaimer that I am not a fan of sweetbread at all. So it's no surprise that this was not one of my faves. I will say that my husband likes sweetbread and he said he really liked it so there you go :). Then came the cheese course (yes we did order it because why not?) with some honey. No complaints. It was good. Not the best I've tasted but still delish.  Then the dessert!! Sweet cream and grapes - sounds simple but oh so not. My fave dish of the night. The grape parfait melted in your mouth like I don't know how to describe it. The grapes were almost like korean grapes but without the tough skin. Melt in your mouth goodness. The last dish was my second fave of the night. Can you tell I am a dessert type of gal? Vanilla ice cream with warm blackberry. I don't even know how you can come up with that concept but there you go! It was amazing. They also gave us a grapefruit purée with honey ""from the kitchen."" Woohoo! More dessert. This was really sour but good sour and the honey on top complimented it perfectly! Cleanses your palate for real!Anyway what puts his place at a five is that not only is the food really good, but the servers are also on top of their game. Our waiter was one of the nicest guys we've ever met. He really seemed to enjoy his job and just so professional and classy. One of our dishes were taking forever to come and he took the time to come to our table and apologize and say that it was coming out soon and asked if we needed anything in the meantime. I mean, if that's not great service, then I don't know what is.Bottom line is really check this place out. And since he menu is ever changing, you will never get bored of it.",3,1,2
100,Bai S.,"Vancouver, Canada",176,27,67,2.0,8/1/2017,No variety in the flavor profile for each course (every dish = sour). Asked us a bunch of times if we wanted more bread but didn't tell us that they charged additional.,,,
101,Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2998,9821,62664,4.0,6/24/2014,"I'd missed the meal where they cooked in both SF and Oakland somehow. So I traveled to their neck of the woods to check out what was happening. This is a super narrow space. A small host stand/bar up front and a number of two tops parallel all the way back to the kitchen. It's a bistronomy style, affordable tasting menu. Great bread with pork fat to start. The menu went as follows:Treviso, clam, marrowScallop, pepper, cucumberChicken, asparagus, rhubarbGrilled milk, strawberryBuckwheat, plum, coffeeFairly minimalist but interesting flavor combinations and most importantly tasty in their arrangement. Sake and wine paired very well and we got to talk to some of the staff after.

103,Joanne Y.,"San Francisco, CA",495,430,175,3.0,8/23/2015,"Yes, 7 courses for $67 is a steal (plus 1 extra for bread and butter). No, it did not blow me away even for the price. I left this place with a very mixed feeling of how I thought my dinner went. I might have gone on an off night, but 3 of the dishes I ate I really disliked (like to the point where I didn't even want to bother finishing up the dish) and 2 were just mediocre. That left 2 to be really good/outstanding dishes which left me wanting more... but not enough for I-want-to-come-back sort of more, if that makes any sense.What seems to be consistent here is that they work their seafood really well - I would trust those dishes. Our favorite dish of the night was the crab and snow peas. The crab was very good and the snow peas gave me a newfound reason to enjoy peas in my life.I thought that the quality of food here was also great. You can tell there is some talent among the chefs since the execution of the dishes were great. The choice and overall composition of each dish was sort of otherwise a hit or miss, but you can definitely see they are trying to put something unique together. Sometimes unique is great, but when you put weird shit together (like peaches and corn) it might just come out tasting weird too. By the way, on our ladies night out, my girl friend and I did think the 7 courses was plenty enough food. We ordered bread just in case, but the bread was a bit too filling for us. I would also say I did not really love the bread. It was good, but nothing to proclaim about. If you do decide to come here, it seems like a good idea to make reservations.",4,1,1
104,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,3/8/2014,"Contra opened in late 2013 to mixed acclaim. With Jeremiah Stone (formerly of Isa) and Fabian von Hauske (of Noma and Faviken fame) overseeing the kitchen on a regular basis, there was an understandable amount of buzz. The restaurant has only one menu that changes on a daily basis: a five course tasting that clocks in at a reasonable $55, although diners at the bar now have the option of ordering  dishes a la carte. The restaurant is appropriately situated in the Lower East Side, modestly decorated, with plenty of brick and wood themes playing off the gently hued lights.I came in a group of four on a weekday evening, and after confirming our reservation, were seated promptly. A quick skim of the wine list revealed a rather compact but thorough selection, ranging from the sweeter, lighter whites to the full-bodied, drier reds. On the other hand, I was more interested in the food menu; each of the five courses is listed simply by the ingredients that its comprised of, and doesn't give diners much say in the decision. We were, however, able to add on an order of bread for several additional dollars, which was a decision none of us regretted. The meal started off with a freshly baked, flaky roll of bread that paired perfectly with butter and served as a good segue into our actual courses -One: At first glance, the dish was a haphazard conglomeration of ingredients. Slivers of kohlrabi were intertwined with roasted kale and seaweed, and just barely covered a scallop carpaccio. While I typical dislike scallops served raw, Contra's version was lightly salted and had a hint of acidity in each bite, which complimented the rest of the ingredients well.Two: The second course was probably the one I was most anxious about, but the monkfish turned out to be one of the most enjoyable plates of the evening. The monkfish was expertly cooked, and turned out to be an incredibly tender piece of fish that was relatively mild in briney, fish-like flavor. It was complimented well by a handful of roasted brussels sprout leaves and diced bacon, which added some much-needed smokiness to the plate.Three: A carefully roasted piece of chicken was topped with puntarelle slices and almonds and paired with a carrot-based sauce. I appreciated that they kept the crisp sliver of skin on top, and it was complimented well by the tender chicken. Overall, a well-executed dish with ""safe"" flavors.Four: This is the dish that made the greatest impression on all of us, based on sheer creativity and genius alone. Crumbled popcorn is served with mandarin ""snow"", ice infused with the juice of the fruit. The surprise was in the very bottom of the dish, a corn mousse that somehow seemed to bring together all the elements of the dish.Five: The final course of the evening seemed to stretch too far, but it was nonetheless an impressive plate. A scoop of hazelnut ice cream is served with toasted sunchoke chips, supported by an egg yolk encased with a gianduja frosting. While the presentation was top-notch, all the different ingredients seemed to get lost in each other taste-wise.Given the concept behind the ever-changing menu, it's easy to see how there's some hits and misses with all the courses. Nonetheless, the five-course tasting offered at Contra is one of the better values in NYC, and is a good option for those seeking something outside the typical dining repertoire.",7,7,6

107,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,4.0,8/10/2014,"Dinner at Contra was a lovely birthday gift from my boyfriend about a month ago. It was also my first tasting menu. Living in NYC, one is faced with so many daily choices that after a while, it can get to be a bit much. So I was excited to not only have a restaurant chosen for me, but the menu as well. Now, seeing as the establishment is tasting menu-only, I don't have an online menu to browse, so I won't remember the dish or drink names exactly. But I took notes (nerd alert) so this should be fairly accurate.Contra is located on the LES, on a street perhaps better known for its nightlife than its cuisine. Upon arriving, we were immediately seated in Contra's rather tiny interior, and we got to work ordering our drinks. Mine was something with tequila and melon, and it was surprisingly light and refreshing for a tequila-based cocktail. Our courses consisted of the following ingredients. The first three ingredients I list are what was listed on the menu, but more ingredients were used in each dish.Course #1: Tomato, eqqplant, onion. Not too memorable.Course #2: Pollock, anise, cranberry beans and potatoes. Again, good, but not a standout.Course #3: Sweetbreads, peas, lettuce. This was my first sweetbreads experience. I was a little sketched out at trying them, but I enjoyed them. Although they tasted rather fatty, it was a good kind of fatty, if that makes sense. What really brought this dish together for me was the absolutely divine lemon creme sauce.Course #4: Wild chamomile ice cream, strawberry sauce, olive oil. The understated inclusion of olive oil made the dish unique.Course #5: Yogurt, grains, seeds. I remember a lemon-flavored sorbet, and a rich carmel swirl.We also ordered the bread, which was so worth it. If I can give you one piece of advice, it would be about the bread, because that is probably the only consistent thing on the menu (although it's possible that they even change the bread each day). Anyway, the advice is to get the bread.Though both of us agreed that we weren't completely blown away with the experience, I found the menu to be creative, healthy, and palatable. I'd definitely recommend Contra if you're looking for a tasty and relatively affording tasting menu.",1,1,1
108,Reg E.,Bay Area,45,89,11,5.0,10/12/2016,"I love restaurants that only offer one menu at a set price. No a la carte, no big, or small menu.  Just one menu for the night with simple three to four word descriptions on what to somewhat expect.  It was the perfect amount of courses/plating.There was one dish I especially loved, it was a chilled almond gazpacho with micro cucumber/tomatoe, basil flower, melons.  It was super refreshing, light, and aromatic.  As one other reviewer said, the bread and butter was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the best breads I've ever had.  The texture was really nice. Warm, somewhat chewy, and just melted in your mouth with  the accompanying butter.They also had a dish with raw red onion, Uni, some type of bean- it was very nice.  One of the desserts also left a lasting impression. Elderflower and pistachio! Amazing!!! So refreshing and bursting with great flavor.

109,Aimee X.,"New York, NY",435,85,156,3.0,9/10/2015,"I read about Contra in a restaurant review that noted its great value for the prix fixe menu so I decided to try it out. The idea of a prix fixe menu was attractive to me since I could be completely lazy and not have to pick my own food. Although, the overall meal was pretty good, but nothing about the menu was mind-blowing. Food: The amuse-bouche was a lettuce bite that was a little difficult to eat but it was fresh and crunchy. Next came a cheese and strawberry course that was delightful. The creamy cheese was perfectly cut with the acidity of the strawberry sauce. Next came the squid pasta that wasn't really my favorite. The cold squid didn't have a lot of flavor but it was beautifully presented on the black ink puree. Next came the first entrée, the tilefish. The fish was beautiful and flaky and the sauce was light, fully highlighting the flavor of the fish. Next came the highlight of my meal, the duck. It was beautifully presented with berries and leaves. The duck was tender and juicy and the flavors were divine. After came the 2 dessert courses: a popcorn ice cream with peach ice and a cherry and cream dessert. My favorite was the popcorn ice cream that was unexpected and delicious. Service: Our server was attentive and very on top of it with the wine pouring. Worthy of a classy restaurant. Overall, the meal was a pleasurable experience. However, I wasn't really blown away by innovation or flavor. It is still a great deal for a prix fixe menu and worth the price.",1,,

111,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,5.0,2/24/2015,"I picked Contra for a special dinner date with my BF and since we've both read the rave reviews of the place we were both really looking forward to our dinner date. We came on a Friday and I was surprised that it was actually easy to get a reservation as long as you book a couple weeks in advance. They have one menu. It changes seasonally of course but the price has been $55 per person since it opened. Definitely a bargain for the quality of the dishes! After ordering cocktails our dinner started with a plate of thinly sliced kohlrabi with radish and walnuts. It was a nice salad to start with and the flavors were interesting as it wasn't what I expected at all. Next came the monkfish which was delicious. I loved their use of varying textures and temperatures. It certainly makes for a more unique dish. After the monkfish was the hanger steak and radicchio. I really liked the plating of this dish. And speaking of plates I loved the dinner plates! I wish I knew whew they are from.. OK back to the food. The steak was probably the most mainstream item in terms of flavor profile. It was delicious but not very interesting. You can add cheese or bread to your dinner and we opted to add bread. You should too because their bread is one of the best ones I've had at restaurants. Accompanied by celeriac butter and it was so addictive! After the savory dishes comes two desserts. Both equally delicious and quite stunning. The coffee mousse is terrific! It does taste exactly as if you are drinking a cup of espresso while enjoying it in the texture of a mousse. The second dessert is the popcorn ice. It's hard to describe it, you just have to taste it yourself. It is splendid! It's a refreshing end to the meal and the texture is just very interesting. Definitely one of the most memorable desserts I've had in a long time.The food was definitely very creative and the tasting menu stands out from other fancy Manhattan restaurants. My only minor complain was that the service was a little lacking. The staff were not as attentive as you would expect in restaurants of this calibre. Otherwise, our dining experience was tremendous!",6,1,2
112,Pallavi P.,"New York, NY",356,170,134,4.0,7/6/2015,"After reading a blog article about Contra, I felt compelled to try it. And I'm glad I did! This place has an affordable 7 course tasting menu at the price tag of $67. This is mainly Mod American food which is always palatable and balances the line between experimental and crazy. The menu changes every so often, but here was our food experience for the night: My favorite was the slow-cooked duck. It was beautiful and lucious with a slight gamey flavor. I could eat that course all day every day for 3 weeks. A close runner up was the butternut squash with burrata. It was definitely one of a kind with overpowering flavors and a creamy finish (burrata). Lastly the cherry, tapioca sour cream dessert was phenomenal. I am not a fan of cherries but it was used as a garnish rather than adding to the flavor. The consistency and texture were surprising for this dish.----Additional add-ons are belowour bread and butter +3cheese +8We opted to add on the bread & butter as well as the cheese. As a cheese fanatic, I have to say the cheese was amazing! But it was only one kind and a very small slab of cheese so at the price of $8, I'll have to say pass the cheese option.",1,,1
113,calvin a.,"New York, NY",0,32,0,2.0,9/11/2017,"The food here vacillates between excellent and brilliant but somebody needs to blow the whistle on their wine program, which utterly ruins the experience.  They pride themselves on offering only organic wines.  Evidently, that is the only criteria necessary for Contra to serve a wine.  Clearly they are not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste, let alone simple digestibility.  Getting the wine pairing with the tasting menu is a circus.  On a recent night pretty much every selection was nightmare.  One was actually undergoing active secondary fermentation, another showed clear signs of a lactic acid bacteria overdose, and a third was oxidized (ostensibly on purpose) to the point of rancidity.  Even a light rose' was such a scatological mess that I half expected to see curlicues of shimmering methane rising out of the glass.  We are not merely talking bad wine here -- some of these were bacteriologically unsound and would make you ill. The staff's blowhard BS comments on these dreadful offerings is also truly comical to anyone who knows wine.  The servers' heads are randomly filled, like a tiddly-winks cup, with brightly-coloured scraps of rubbish designed to fraudulently convince neophyte customers that they are getting some rare and great nectar.  One server actually argued with me when I pointed out the plain inaccuracy of her bald statement that no wine served in the restaurant is certified by a appellation contrôlée, denominaciones de origen, or comparable authority.  My wife and I don't eat meat so when I asked why we were being served a young fruitbomb Rhone with a delicate fish dish that the kitchen was good enough to substitute for our beef course, we were told without apology that the restaurant does not make related substitutions for the wine pairings.Let me add that there are good ""organic"" or ""biodynamic"" wines and, more importantly, there are great wines that would satisfy most any criteria for ""organic"" but don't bother to seek such certification.  Moreover, there is no uniform criteria for these monikers.  Elevating these labels above all else is a form of consumer fraud.  Most of all, however, in the case of Contra, it spoils what would could otherwise be a great meal because, mercifully, the kitchen does not believe that ""organic"" alone suffices.",1,,

116,Maya R.,"Hoboken, NJ",275,63,116,5.0,4/4/2017,"I came here on Saturday night for the tasting menu. This was my first ever experience doing a proper tasting menu and I was excited! The location itself is quite narrow and tucked away on Orchard Street in the LES. Conveniently being a 2 minute walk from my apartment certainly helps! The decor is mostly wooden and quite simple but pleasant. Tables are small but ample size. I had the spritz cocktail which was bubbly champagne with an orange twist. The courses were each separated by about 10 minutes and we received new silverware for each. The staff was attentive and all servers assisted in each table's service. We were given a thorough description of each course, though I didn't recognize the majority of ingredients. The flavors were so delicate and creative! It was very clear that the chefs have thought through every bite and planned an experience for the eater. I got more excited with each course and not one round disappointed. I also think $67 per person for a tasting menu is a great deal for Manhattan, especially for the quality of food and level of creativity. I would definitely recommend it!",,,
117,Jess C.,"New York, NY",594,305,582,4.0,11/26/2014,"Contra's strengths lie in its affordable tasting menu ($55 for five courses), its creative, maybe unconventional ingredients, and its whimsical menu (changes daily), shrouding each diner with mystery and curiosity until arrival. That could be a hit or miss, depending on the night. Especially if you have strict dietary restrictions/allergies, definitely call ahead to make sure they can accommodate you.The menu on July 18, 2014 was: tomato, cucumber, eggplantclam, scallop, cabbage, leeksweetbreads, beans, currantswild chamomile, strawberry, olive oilyogurt, grains, seedsLike everyone else said, definitely order the bread for an additional $3. It's absolutely worth it, and the butter was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Good thing I learned that it was goat's milk butter later, because I normally don't eat it. As my first time having sweetbread (I believe ours was thymus), it wasn't as horrific as I imagined. The blackcurrant surprisingly masked the earthy/gamey taste very well. My friend and I did end up eating everyone else's sweetbread though haha.The chamomile ice cream with strawberry reduction sauce was lovely, and I was impressed by how well they teased out the fragrance of the chamomile ice cream. The (buckwheat?) yogurt with grains and seeds was my absolute favorite though!On the night that we came, the desserts stood out more than the main dishes. I'll be sure to give Contra another try, but I hope they improve their service (cold and hurried) and spacing between courses (we had empty dishes that weren't cleared for over 20 minutes and there were a few long gaps). Also, the portions are on the smaller side - if I hadn't gobbled up everyone else's sweetbreads, I probably would have left hungry. 3.5 stars.Notes:- space is hipster chic complete with brick walls and long wooden benches- food has clear Nordic influences- be sure to make a reservation!",17,7,11

Started with the baby mushroom croquet en bouche, which was a tasty little bite of mushroom. The oyster, lapsing gelee and peas was a cold dish that incorporates a tea gelee with cold oysters and peas. The dish was a nice contrast to the mushroom started. Next came the rose champagne, heirloom tomatoes and poisson de roche, which was a sweet raw fish dish. The rose champagne, flowers, and tomatoes gave the dish a sweet taste that I normally don't associate with raw fish. The king crab, celery sabayon and capers was OK, although the crab was good. The celery mousse was interesting and had the essence of celery in a creamy texture. One of the main courses was Elysian Fields lamb with scallop lasagna and cresson-wasabe. The lamb and scallop lasagna were both very good. Next came quail with fave and cherries. The quail was good but a little difficult to eat. For dessert, there was home made Camembert cheese with hay ice cream. The cheese was great but I could do without the essence of hay in my ice cream. The dishes were inventive and interesting with a few hits and a few misses. Was it worth $180? Probably not but I did get a copy of Octophilosophy on my way out.",,,

Needless to say, we just kept ordering drinks to kill off the boredom and hunger. The waiter apologized for the long wait, but didn't comp any drinks. Every dish was just ok, nothing to write home about. Three out of the five dishes were sweet: the asian pear, the lemon coffee dish, and the buckwheat ice cream concoction. So unsatisfying.

Updated review","Can't believe it took me almost a year to return to Contra, when it happened to be my birthday.  Not surprisingly, I was a very happy birthday girl; yet surprisingly, the food was even better than I remembered!Without further ado, let's straight to my bday dinner, shall we :)First course, kohlrabi salad with hazelnut milk, pear. I don't recall I have had fresh kohlrabi before - it is not a common veggie in Hong Kong where I am from; it is mostly found in Yunan province and usually fermented. So this is brand new to me.The thinly sliced cylindrical veggie has very mild taste and crunchy texture. It serves as a perfect vehicle to absorb the hazelnut milk dressing. It is a good starter, light and clean taste, just enough to open up your appetite.Second course, seared monkish in horseradish foam dusted over dried seaweed. I love monkfish. It is perfectly cooked, great texture and paired well with the seasoning. I would recommend pairing with champagne or other dry white wine as the horseradish foam has a whipped cheese like salty taste but without the heavy-cheesiness. Third course, strip loin with purple cabbage,  swiss chard in an anchovy dressing. It's a chunk of sexy beef, perfectly charred outside and medium rare, juicy inside.Dessert! First act, coffee parfait con passion fruit cream. It is not bad; I just had difficulty to pair them together. If I could, I would just have two scoops of the coffee parfait. This is so creamy so coffee-y. Second dessert, popcorn mousse with mandarin ice and popcorn sugar. This is to die for ! I usually can't finish any dessert but this is an exception - more savory than sweet, great contrary of texture and salty-sweet taste. Perfect to finish up with a dripped coffee made with Colombian coffee beans from a local Brooklyn roaster. Overall, very good food, even better services. Jen, the bar tender, makes killer cocktails. And she has a great personality. The vibe was eccentric and vibrant. .  When I got there around 7, it was about 70% full, by 9pm, it was at full swing. But it never got too loud, which I appreciate.If you like me eating out frequently, you should know that for this quality of food and creative tasting menu, with wine pairing, it easily goes beyond $120/pp in NYC. Yet it is only $55 to start at Contra (drinks are $15ish for wine/cocktails)!  I shall def come back more often :)Happy New Year!",3,1,1
125,Ridhima S.,"New York, NY",12,29,0,3.0,10/19/2017,"Management and waiters want to have 3+ seatings, so they rush everything. Rush the cocktail and even before a sip they want your order. The food arrives very fast. One course is crashed by the next. I tried my very best to have a 2 hour meal and few others around us could. Price of the meal per hour is extremely high. Contra is a far cry from fine dining. The NYT review is wrong: Contra is not dedicated to the customer experience, they are bent on churning tables and could care less about their customers. That left me with a bad taste in my mouth",,,

Updated review","Came here for our wedding anniversary. I was so excited to try the innovative tasting menu that just earned this restaurant viewers choice in NY by Food & Wine mag. The restaurant itself was cute and I liked the streamlined decor. The service was awesome, even when a few things were missed. The food? Each course was inventive and better than the last. As others have said - get the bread. All in all a great culinary experience.",,,
128,Stephen H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,2,5.0,6/26/2017,"We ate at Contra this past Friday evening with friends who also live in the City and who are pretty serious chefs at home. We all agreed that the food and service was outstanding. We ordered the tasting menu, including the optional cheese course, and wine pairings. I am reminded of great tasting menus I have enjoyed over the years in New York City (11 Madison, WD-50, Tocqueville, to name a few) and I have to say this is the best yet. The approach to the wine selection was as clever as the take on the food. The cheese course caught us completely off guard and is not to be missed. We each had a cocktail before dinner and all in the bill came to about $800 with tip for four of us.",2,,
129,Viv X.,"Manhattan, NY",118,12,15,4.0,2/6/2016,"Very impressed. A casual diner hidden in east village with some of the most innovative chefs. Menus are updated every day up to what they can get from the local market. Presentation is effortless but pretty. The appetizers were all good, flavorful, light and fresh. The main courses were good however not to the extent impressive. Dessert was better. Out of all dishes my favorite was the lobster appetizer with some fresh lemon cream, very tinder, flavorful and fresh. I would say they bring out dishes really quickly and i actually could use some time between the dishes just to chat, digest and enjoy. Other than that, overall it was very good. (An extra tip: the extra 3 dollar for the bread is so much worth it. The bread is big enough for two to share and the out of oven freshness is wonderful)",1,1,1
130,Philip N.,"San Ramon, CA",67,246,89,5.0,7/7/2014,"I had been hearing too much about Contra not to go and I walked away just really happy about my experience.  The restaurant can be easily missed so make sure to get off your smartphone when walking and take in the sights and sounds around you.  In the midst of the most unassuming of neighborhoods is one of NY's more exciting restaurants.People say you should get the bread, and to them I say ""Right on.""  Get the bread.  Pay the $3 and get the freaking bread.You'll be hardpressed to find a better deal in the city in terms of a complete tasting menu: 5 courses (3 savory, 2 sweet) for $55.  When thinking about Contra I simply think of ""balance."" Every dish was well composed, well thought out, and constructed with a focus on achieving nice harmony with flavors, textures, levels of richness and acidity.  First up was a dish that presented the freshness and crispness of squash that sang with the brightness of an herb purees and creamy burrata.By far, the best dish was the sweetbreads that were perfectly fried and delectable, but well balanced with pea puree, onion and mache greens.  Honestly one of the best courses I've had in a really long time.The berkshire pork with currants and broccoli flowers was a nice end to the savory portion of the meal.  I still can't stop thinking about the grilled milk ice cream with strawberry puree.  Each component on its own was okay, but together it made up a really good dessert.  The cream with plum puree seemed pretty similar at first, but the toasted coffee and buckwheat crumble they put on top helped take that dessert to the next level.Plain and simple, Contra is one of the best new restaurants in NYC.",8,4,5
131,Eve C.,"Manhattan, NY",343,856,805,3.0,3/7/2016,Wanted to like them so bad but alas nope you can taste the passion and the desire but the execution was just short. It was a good meal but there was something missing..salt of textures.,,1,
132,John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,949,40,5.0,3/1/2016,Excellent meal!  Lots of great flavors and textures.  Every course was delicious with a few at the 'wow' level.

133,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1217,408,1956,5.0,3/26/2014,"Contra is the sort of whimsical adventure you hope for when you arrive with a small group of food-appreciators.There is a clever logic and thoughtfulness behind the way the dishes are constructed, with a healthy dose of random.   This is probably a reflection of a constantly adapting menu, that is also executable on a daily basis.  Brassica, ricotta, ham.  Despite this being one of my favorite and most beautifully plated courses (an ink-black plate achieves the dramatic effect), I had to look up ""brassica"" just now and confirmed that is the yellow flower-like garnishes to the dish, and a member of the mustard family in case you were wondering.   The flavors were purposeful and successful, and force you to realize that you were not expecting, and are not accustomed, to such flavors.   Next the squid, potato & rye.  I especially liked the dash of squid ink on the plate.  I love anything squid ink and this was delicious!Our group opted for the add-on course, and the light flavorful broth that came with the slightly seared swordfish was alone worth it.  The chicken with almond was the third on the menu of five, and the final protein.  This was the most surprisingly well-done.   I usually have low expectations of chicken (unless fried and served with waffles), and was delighted to learn that chicken can be an interesting, savory and deliciously juicy dish, with a nice crispy skin. I only wished there was more of it to enjoy.  As a lover of desserts both classic and experimental, I absolutely adored (and I mean ADORED) both dessert courses.  The first, a peach chamomile creation with herbs was an airy, magical bite of deliciousness.  It tasted of succulent peach, infused with herbs and tea (green tea ice cream lovers may appreciate this).  It was subtle but not light on flavor. The second, bolder dessert (beets, yogurt, hazelnut) consisted of a cool, ice-cream like creamy yogurt served with crisp beet chips, an intensely beety beet sauce, and crunchy toasted hazelnuts.  A medley of natural sweetness of root vegetable (think of the earthy sweetness of yams or maple) and perfect crunch from the hazelnuts and beet chips with each bite.    I loved every bite of this not-too-sweet, highly unusual dessert.   This could've easily come across as trying way too hard to be special (beets in dessert?) but it was so well done, and the flavors so tantalizing, I just appreciated the combination.  In fact, it was fitting that the desserts are not listed on the menu as what they are (was the peach thing panna cotta?  marshmallow? flan?), but in descriptions of flavors.  This is not your typical dessert menu with a chocolate option, trio of sorbets, and a ""lighter"" fruitier dessert.    Just textures and flavors.   Consume and enjoy the full extent of the flavors brought to you by the chefs.  Given that this was around the time of their opening, I would definitely go back to see how the menu has evolved in different seasons.  You want Contra to delight and challenge your senses, and it does.   You will likely be full even without ordering the extra course like we did.  The portions are fair, and the quality to price ratio cannot be beat.  Just have fun with it.   (For my 300th review, I was thinking of paying homage to the testosterone ridden graphic-novel-turned-blockbuster, 300, by reviewing a man-approved barbecue place.  Instead I decided on Contra, and rest happy with my choice.)",9,7,8
134,Eunice D.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,20,9,4.0,3/25/2015,"I love Contra for their playful attitude towards food. Their 5 course pre-fixe menu is constantly changing based on what's in season and sourced locally. Each of the 5 dishes are artfully displayed, and they're comprised of unconventional marriages between tastes and textures. Quality is a given. Very small portions are also a given. I docked a star because the wait time between each small dish felt exceptionally long (especially while hangry!). I was seated at 7pm sharp on a snowy Friday night and the last course didn't arrive until after 9pm, so bring good company and be prepared for a drawn out meal. As an aside, I highly suggest getting the bread appetizer. It is warm, fresh, and rustic, and it comes with a delicious melt-in-your-mouth garlic butter. I promise it will not disappoint!",,,

136,Chenxi L.,"Manhattan, NY",541,14,41,4.0,4/21/2016,"Maybe I've just read too many good reviews of the place or I kept comparing it to its outstanding sister restaurant Wildair, but Contra left me slightly underwhelmed, so this is a 3.5 rounded up to a 4.To start, yes, the restaurant is popular and busy, but we were seated more than 30 minutes after our reservation, despite being 10 minutes early. On top of the 40 minute wait, each dish took quite a long time to come out of the kitchen, which surprised us a bit. At one point we thought... Come on, you are making the same six dishes all week long... how long should this take?Wait aside, the dishes are creative and inventive, yes, but none of them hit home as ""wow"". I won't bother listing the dishes since you won't be able to decide anyway, but portion sizes are definitely on the smaller side, which means you have room for the bread and cheese additions - both of which are musts. $3 for a small hunk of bread and $8 for three smaller slices of cheese and some honey, yes, but you are also getting a 6-course tasting for $67 so there is nothing to complain about. The hot sourdough is absolutely amazing (crunchier and more body than what you get next door at Wildair, which is also fantastic), and the cheese slices are tangy and creamy and served with some mindblowing floral honey. Just do it.Certainly not a perfect restaurant, but the value of the food, freshness of the ingredients, creativity in the pairing, and the bread and cheese definitely win Contra some brownie points. Still, I'd rather try my luck walking into Wildair.",,,

Contra is an outsanding restaurant on its own and the chefs here have done an excellent job incorporating their past experiences to create a menu that is both exciting and delicious. I'm not a big fan of charging extra for bread, but if you just factor the $3 into the total cost, the overall meal is well worth $58. Or just a tiny bit more, if you add on a supplement, which I did. The goat's head is delicious by the way*, the brain is akin to bone marrow, if you're into that savory/succulent kind of thing. Don't be so afraid. I can't wait to come back.*Yes, the eyeball does taste quite gelatinous, but I heard it improves your own eyesight as much as 2 pounds of carrots does, so feel free to forego your annual eye examination after eating it!

Items like ""Hungarian peppers"" and ""Miso ice-cream"" simply ""blew my mind"" in a very wrong way. The steak I had was practically raw (not that they asked how I wanted it to be cooked). The wine (two glasses that I have tried) tasted like they have been opened and left in the basement for two days.  I was tempted to ask the ""chef"" if he/she knows how to cook, actually. It's like a mad man mixing chemical solutions and pretending to be a scientist. Sorry if I sounded a bit harsh, but yes it was really bad.

It was just a normal brown loaf of breadCeleriac & Asian Pear salad - a light, refreshing start but a bit dry. I would have preferred more of the sauce. Monkfish, cabbages, mustard greens - this was my favorite. The fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the cabbage and greens. The peas were a great touch and I loved how fresh and sweet they were.Chicken, salsify, shallots - I'm not a big chicken fan but I was happy that it wasn't dry or bland. The dish had a woodsy, whimsical feel--similar to the decor of the restaurant. I really disliked the salsify--it was this crunchy herbal-y, root thing that reminded me of teeny-tiny tree stumpsApple, oat, caramel - I liked the lightness of this dessert and the balance of the flavors & texturesVanilla ice cream, raspberry, beet - I highly disliked this and didn't eat more than a bite. It didn't have much of a vanilla flavor and the beet sauce was bizzareI wasn't impressed by the wine list so didn't order anything, which NEVER happens since I'm a huge wine geek. All in, it's over $70 for a relatively small portion of food that wasn't particularly mind blowing. If you're looking for value, there are definitely better options out there.",7,2,3
145,Shannon S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,70,10,2.0,1/21/2016,4 stars for the unique wine list5stars for service1star for the food I knew going into it not to expect a tasting menu like bouley or one of the other famous tasting menus in the city but this meal was definitely underwhelming. One of our dishes had broccoli purée/water... It literally tasted like they poured water on the scallops. The scallops themselves were good and fresh and would have almost been better by themselves. The pork shoulder was decent but it didn't wow me. And both dessert courses were terribly sour. The only reason we weren't starving at the end was because of the amazing sour dough bread. If you decide to give contra a try definitely add this to your courses. Our server was fantastic and very knowledgeable. We didn't particularly enjoy the wine we ordered but Its always fun to try new wines. It is just very upsetting when you leave hungry from a $200 dinner.,,,
146,Craig Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,589,22,3.0,11/11/2013,"Exceptional food, but still feels new, and is currently lacking many of the other elements that make a restaurant great, including value.Disappointing beverage programI witnessed two different people struggle through 3 tastes of white wines by the glass before finding something they liked.  I am all for esoteric wines, especially in this setting, but they must taste good. I think the reds by the glass are better though, and the one I had paired very well with my food. Beyond wine, as CJ said below, they have one beer, and they have 3 whiskies.  That's it, which really detracted from the outstanding food and solid service. What's more, I found the drinks on the expensive side.FoodThe menu is a set 5 courses for $55, and it is 3 very small savory course, a palate cleanser of sorts, and one small desert.  Very small portion sizes!  Most places that serve dishes this small would serve you 7-9 plates, not 5.  And, no bread, no amuse bouche, no petie fours, no muffin or granola as you are walking out the door; I can't think of a single place that does a menu like this with zero extras.  I left extremely hungry, and even if I had excercised the option to pay more for another starter, cheese, or bread, I'm guessing I would have still felt hungry, and I know I would have felt more like I had paid too much.  Leaving hungry when you have a set menu seems like a poor job by the chef.Yes, the food was really something.  4 out of 5 dishes were incredible, and the 5th (monkfish) was very nice also; the sweet courses were both really great.Service was surprisingly good for a new place.  (To be clear, it was good for any place, but even more impressive for a new place.)One more warning though: this restaurant is going to be very cold in the winter based on it's layout and materials if they don't add a vestebule or something, and even if they do that may not help a lot.",5,3,3
147,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,3.0,11/18/2013,"If you don't have much time to read through a review then here's a quick scorecard:1) The food here is very good (4.5 stars)2) The portions are very small (1 star)3) The pacing is slow (2 stars)4) Staff is friendly, but due to space constraints may end up bumping into your chair repeatedly (1 star)5) Pricing is very fair, $55 for a quality 5-course meal (4.5 stars)Overall Contra gets a 3 from me. I'd be interested to see how they develop since they'd only been open for 1.5 months when I visited.The portions are so small that you won't be full after five courses, so if you go to Contra hungry, I'd order bread for $3. (though I'm not sure how much bread they give you). The pacing was quite an issue for me and I started timing the lag between dishes. In between the 1st course and 2nd course it took them 14 minutes. Between the 2nd and 3rd it took 22 minutes. The desserts came out speedily which was nice. Contra chefs don't start cooking your next dish until they clear your plate which I think is somewhat silly. Hopefully they improve the pacing in the future.Overall the quality of the food and the pricing is good enough to make up for the restaurant's shortcomings. If they can work out the kinks with pacing and increase portions by 10-15%, Contra could turn out very good down the line.",4,2,2
148,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",874,1242,25,4.0,5/4/2014,"Came here on a Saturday night at 9pm for my birthday.  Bf and me.  He made a reservation two weeks in advance, which is the only time you can. Walk ins are welcome but it's a 44 seat place so...yeah.  Be sure to check restaurant hours because I believe they are closed two days out of the week.  Like many hot restaurants today, Contra doesn't have a sign nor is it flashy or showy...the restaurant overall is nondescript.  So is the service- not that it's bad by any means or that server were unknowledgable, it was just...simple. They left you alone. Down to earth.  The food however, is not.  It is quite culinarily creative, and well, you need to be pretty into experimentation when coming here. I say this because for better or worse, the two chef team ( from Isa in W-burg and Noma.. ""the"" Noma, though Chef Fabian has also worked at a bunch of other cool places) are pretty young.  Like they say, with experience comes better food but also, they surely know how to be adventurous with their food and so for that, I am impressed.  They do adhere to dietary restrictions of course, but why bother coming to Contra if you don't want to be wowed by some major gastronomy techniques.Everyone gets the same 5- course meal (3 savory, 2 dessert) for $55.  I highly recommend getting the bread and cheese ($3, and $8).  The menu changes daily they say, but I think it's more seasonal than they advertise.  There is a bit of ""foraging"" elements in here  (meaning I ate everything on my plate) but as they say,  don't come here thinking you are eating Noma for cheaper.Course 1:  Squid with onion (raw and fried), citrus, and potato- smokey, and very good. Love the tart taste of the potato.  Course 2: Monkfish with lots of bitter greens- arugala, watercress, etc. I enjoyed the fish seafoam but I didn't love this dish overall only because I found the monkfish to be a firmer, tougher white fish. Course 3: Pan Seared Crispy Chicken- this was my FAVORITE dish. Always love the juicy chicken on the inside and crispy skin on the outside but not overly greasy thing.  Came with grilled veggies, among them, a smokey grilled scallion which gave it an Asian flare.  Lovely.Course 4: Dessert 1. A shaved ice play, which was actually an olive oil mousse, yuzu-y, lemon-y ice, with, crumbled pistachios....DELICIOUS. Tasted like a softer, less sweet ice cream. Course 5: Dessert 2. A birch ice cream with Oreo crumbles and sweet caramel icing type thing.  The birch ice cream was full on flavor- very sweet and root beer-like.  This was a nice dish but a little too sweet for me. Bread:  Flaxseed soft loaves with duck fat emulsion and the best butter I've had in a long time.  Faint, with a light lemon taste but delicious.  Worth the $3.  Pete Wells from the NY Times loves it.Cheese: Excellent cheese!! Not too strong dry goat cheese with honey and pieces of something burnt... charcoal?I loved watching all the cooks in back labor and work hard over each dish. Contra is a great experience and value. Go and check it out.",2,,

All we had to do was make a reservation, sit down and get served.  A wonderful flight of petite, filling portions that gushed with different textures, flavors that deviated from the normal/boring preparations in the most elegant way.  The presentation of every dish was visually amazing.  A visual and gustatory delight ;) I also thoroughly enjoyed their selection of music and was so happy when they played the Julieta Venegas's newest song. The mixed drinks were wonderful and well paired with fresh seasonal fruit.  This place is a must try for everyone!",,,
150,Greg O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2237,231,502,4.0,2/16/2014,"We celebrated Valentine's dinner at Contra, after a long week of snow storms in NYC. We opted for the pescatarian 5-course tasting dinner consisting of a radicchio salad with pear, grilled snapper with mussels, grilled monkfish in a lemongrass broth, scallop ceviche, and a tart ice cream dessert.The monkfish was outstanding. We loved the broth and the tender and juicy flavor of the fish. This is a great addition to the LES, and the sound and lighting is really good here. The front bar allows you to sit and have a drink or, dine at the bar. The wait staff is really professional, happy, and helpful. I like the open concept for the kitchen. The work area looked like there were students taking notes from the teacher. I think the single bathroom is an issue that should be reconsidered. I'd look to Japan or Paris for inspirations for a new concept. One bathroom for all patrons is a bad idea. I'd split the bathroom into two and see if you can work a sink outside. I wanted to wash my hands and had to wait 15 minutes to go inside to wash my hands. Hate to admit this, but the wait was for men. Now that is a first.",2,,2

Definitely on my top 5 favorite restaurants list.",,,
152,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,5.0,6/20/2015,"My wife had read some good things about Contra, so we decided to do a post-workweek dinner down in LES. The entrance is relatively unassuming (Contra is painted in squiggly type on the door), but once you step inside, there's a cozy little bar at the front, along with your typical (for NYC) tightly-spaced seating in the rear. We were towards the back, which was a bit warmer on a summer evening (the back door in the kitchen was left open), but it wasn't too noticeable once you got into the meal. Although the decor is typical of trendy spots in the city - a mix of exposed brick and smooth, sleek wooden slats lining the walls, with a long incandescent light hanging across one side and light reflected off of white tiling on the other providing soft lighting without being too dark - it has a very casual atmosphere to it. I came wearing casual summer garb (shorts, t-shirt, sandals) and didn't get a second look about the attire. Service was great, with the waiter giving a great tip on the rose my wife ordered. The food also came well-spaced, such that even though the food wasn't heavy, it felt like a very leisurely 2-hour tasting course experience.There are wines available, as well as select cocktails and beers. I got that distinct feeling from the beers (which were pilsners, lagers, and crafts that did not tip the scales on ABV like an imperial IPA might) and the cocktail selections that they were definitely oriented towards late spring/early summer selections. The beer was a bit pricey, but the cocktails were relatively in line (one could argue cheaper relative to a good number of NYC spots). I had the #12 (no names, just numbers), which was a nice mix of saffron gin (which had a bit of spice) and strega, tempered with yuzu - a very refreshing cocktail that had a bit more of an alcoholic edge to it. Low Life (from Evil Twin) was a very airy pilsner that was quite a bit more drinkable than big-label counterparts, and my wife's rose was nice and fruity, with a lot of tropical notes.The best thing about Contra was that I felt like the tasting menu here really captured the essence of summer - every dish had a very bright flavor and was not dense at all, We started out with lightly grilled cucumber sprinkled with dill and served with a very light tarragon sauce - a great way to start the meal. We then got our serving of bread, which was served in a pretty old-fashioned manner - a big round loaf that you tore open with your hands, with a large wooden 'knife' to spread butter on. Freshly baked and absolutely delicious...you can get more than one, but you'll probably end up a bit fuller than expected! The next course was sliced summer squash served over burrata and sorrel, yet another light dish that packed a little bit more heaviness from the cheese without deviating from the theme of summer lightness. Next up was squid served with peas and both squid ink and pea sauce. The 'noodles' in the dish were actually thinly-sliced pieces of squid meat (I think) that was easy to chew and very flavorful, and the squid ink sauce, while still having its typical warm flavor, was not as dense as it can be in typical pasta dishes. The second seafood dish were lightly seared scallops that were diced up and served with fava beans and were resting in a lemon-tinged broth. The scallops here were the best I've had in recent memory - cooked perfectly with no rubbery texture at all. I don't mind having grill marks on my scallops, but there were none on these - perfect texture for melting in your mouth. The beef ribeye was perhaps even more impressive, as there was only a light marinade on the meat (tinged with pistachio!) that really let the quality of the cut and the cooking shine through. The treviso (the red lettuce) was a bit on the bitter side, but it provided a really nice contrasts to the almost-sweet taste of the beef.We ended the meal on two desserts, both of which were a little off the beaten path. The first was a honey sorbet (or perhaps yogurt? The texture was very interesting) served in peach syrup and olive oil, as well as a helping of tiny tapioca bubbles - very good. The second blew my mind. 'Strawberries and corn' sounds innocuous enough, but the corn pudding covered in a generous helping of icy strawberry gratin was mind-blowing. I've had corn in desserts before, but usually in its typical form. To have it as a very subtle backdrop to a light pudding (definitely notes of it being toasted, like popcorn) and then hit with the crunchy, tart sweetness of the strawberries (there are tiny chunks of real strawberries in there, not the oversized ones you see at most stores) left me speechless.What a dining experience - that is all I can say. I will definitely be back during other seasons, but if what they did for a summer tasting menu - which I think is the hardest season to capture - is any indication, the rest will be great. And for the price, this is a great value for a tasting course in NYC. Highly, highly recommended.",2,,1

154,Percy Y.,"Stony Point, NY",1,18,0,1.0,5/20/2015,"Let's start off with the Menu. I did some research before picking this place to farewell my friend. Their menu changes very often (weekly/daily/monthly) not sure exactly. but there is only 2 choices. a 7 dish or 4 dish version. The 4 dish version serves the same dishes that are included from the 7 dishes fixed menu. So we picked the 7 dishes. We have about 8 -9 ppl as well ordered the same (full meal) just to make sure everyone should be fulll. Also we added bread for our table for  additional 7-8 dollars to try it out. The first dish was exactly the size of my finger tip. I think it was a (veg) asparagus with some sesame of some sort. thats one dish. no source or anything with it. As soon as the first dish came out, i had a feeling that I am not going to be full at all after finishing all the dishes from the way it is going. At the end, i was right. None of us are full. Majority of us are females small size and we all decide that we need a real meal. After all, we were all angry, hungry and not satisfied with the food and the waitor who served us. gratuity were automatically charged for the bad service. Raw food were told not to serve for the pregnant fd we had there. Waitor insist it is cooked and clearly you can see blood red on the meat. The music, decoration, and waitors appearances were nice and but if def has a lot to be work on. i guess this store is a once a life time deal.

155,Scrumphsus B.,"New York, NY",1,21,71,4.0,10/22/2013,"I first met Jeremiah Stone back in September at a pig roast in Williamsburg. Night had fallen and I was devouring a chorizo caramel ice cream from OddFellows with friends when Michelle introduced us to her friend, Jeremy, who was opening up a restaurant called Contra in early October on the LES.He was amped about the progress; with 2 weeks left before opening,  the decor and furniture were installed and the 5-course, $55 prix-fixe menu of New American cuisine were in the final stages of development.Last week, Michelle called in a reservation for what turned out to be an enjoyable experience for our group. The five of us sat comfortably at 2 veneered wooden tables near the bar. By the time we ordered the extra bread and cheese course, the restaurant was humming along, filled with patrons eager to try the food.The server told us about the two specials of the evening, raw diver scallops ($10) and a 35 day dry-aged steak ($100). Upon hearing the word ""steak"", Frank declared, ""let's YOLO this bitch"" to which we planted our face in our palms and shook our heads. The ladies ordered the supplemental scallops while the men decided to split the steak.The bread came out first - a gorgeous buckwheat sourdough brushed with bacon fat and served with goat milk butter. The bread had a hard crusty exterior that gave way to a soft sourdough interior. The delectable combination of bacon fat flavor and creamy goat milk butter made us hungry for our first course, a Japanese sweet potato with roasted kabocha, walnut milk, and chrysthanthemum essence. The pickled onion slices provided crunch and slight acidity to cut through the chalky texture of the sweet potato and pumpkin.Next, came the first special of the night, raw diver scallops with jujubees (tart apple taste) and  green tomatoes with sprinkled sesame. The scallops themselves were very fresh with a velvety- smooth texture. Green tomatoes and apples added a similar crunch and acidity as the previous dish. For me, the scallops could have used a pinch of salt. Also, there was subtle inconsistency between our dishes - Sharon's sauce was sour and Michelle's sauce was on the sweeter side.What followed after was a weakfish from Rhode island, fish emulsion, served with a side of cabbage, sliced pickled radish and crunchy snow peas. Unbelievably juicy and tender with perfectly crisped skin. Definitely better than the black cod at Jungsik.Sharon really liked the next dish -  Chicken with chicory, corn, husk cherries. he smattering of dill flowers was not for garnish sake, but to enhance the dish with pops of intense dill flavor that echoed of anise and licorice. The meat and skin were perfectly cooked and ranks up there with the chicken of NoMad and Zuni Cafe.After a brief respite, which consisted of us patting our food babies, the 20 oz, 35 day dry-aged, medium-rare steak from Stone Creek Farms in TX appeared on our table. The flavors of the red amarnth, tomatillos, frostberries, and soy reduction hit the sweet, sour, and savory notes. The cook on the steak could have been longer as it was a bit too rare for my preference. The crust on the steak was not like Minetta's. It was soft and wet, almost as if it was cooked too long in its own juices. What didn't help was my mistake of slicing with the grain so each bite took 45 seconds to chew. Going forward, I will slice against the grain for all steaks; lesson learned.A delicious Vermont cheese and pickled pear course followed that helped cleanse the palate for the upcoming dessert, a chamomile parfait in chamomile tea with fresh pickled grapes made into raisins.At this point, most of the tables were clearing out which allowed Jeremy to come out and extend a personal welcome to our table. Positive word of mouth has brought a steady stream of traffic which means 9am-12am days. Until they find a manager, Jeremy is juggling front of the house duties such as taking reservations over the phone and kitchen duties such as cooking the dishes alongside his partner Fabian von Hauske, a young and talented chef with a specialty with desserts. Before running back to the kitchen to finish the last few tables, he provided us glasses of a delicious Rosé, which tasted like sweet grape juice. Delicious.The final course was a dessert crafted by Fabian, a young and talented pastry chef. Hazelnut puree, yogurt sorbet, dried beet chips and beet puree. What a creative way in using beets two ways. After dessert, Danny Bowien dropped by to regale the Contra crew with stories of the lively NIN concert at Barclays.After the conclusion of the meal, Jeremy walked us outside with both exhaustion and happiness etched on his face. He mentioned that the menu changes multiple times a week depending on what is available at Union Square Greenmarket. Often, he won't know what will go on the menu until that morning.

158,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245,4.0,3/6/2015,"IN SHORT: Screw every Restaurant Week and for virtually the same price experience some far superior modern, youthful cooking with heavy New Nordic elements.THE STORY: Contra is an important restaurant to visit in the city because it both pushes the boundaries of New York restaurants and still manages to remain comfortably inside them. With a menu of 5 courses at $55, Contra subtly and persuasively undermines the ideals of ""Restaurant Week"" for culinary novices, presenting deeply thoughtful fine dining in a low-key, accessible manner, without sacrificing quality for the sake of mass reception.For many, the restraint in the dishes will come as a surprise. Even for my first course, a carefully composed plate with thin slices of persimmon, squash, and ham, I found myself taken aback by the lack of salt or fat, almost yearning for something heavier to soak up an incredibly, almost shockingly fresh dish. Yet in the thin, silky sauce at the bottom of the plate, I started to find innovative flavors captured with seeds, oils, and vinegars, even though I did decide to use some of my bread to mop up fuller mouthfuls of the sauce. The dishes then got progressively better, with a second course of swordfish, horseradish, and treviso that was so perfectly and impressively cooked I couldn't recall having a better preparation of that particular fish. The third course of hangar steak with mushrooms and sorel was nonetheless the best of the night, with an herby green sauce that had an unexpected depth for its lightness.The last two courses included a meyer lemon and coffee creation that seemed to be more about experimenting with modern textures than it was about balancing flavors, as the alternating notes of lemon and coffee seemed to compete rather than harmonize with each other, and a final dish simply described as ""yogurt, grains, and seeds."" I think I actually laughed after my second or third bite, as I uncovered a hidden mound of hazelnut and chocolate spread that made the toasted seeds and grains gently sprinkled over two textures of yogurt just sing with flavor. It was a course that perfectly encapsulated the spirit of subtle innovation that reigns here.And yet for all of this boundary pushing, Contra is still a restaurant so suited to New York. The small, narrow, muted space tucked away on the Lower East Side would simply be inappropriate in any other city, and its sophistication, seasonality, and air of discovery reflect the truly modern New York dining scene that the chefs seem to be after. Contra is not a restaurant about hospitality or service in the slightest. It is a restaurant about food in New York City, promising and delivering on a contemporary, exciting meal.",3,,2

Well that's Contra for me. It seems that the restaurant got a lot of hype when it first opened in 2014 before falling off everyone's radar as newer, hotter places opened. The menu is now $67 for 6 courses, and as others have mentioned definitely pay the extra $3 for the house made bread.There didn't seem to be much, if any flexibility in the menu so this probably isn't the place to go with a larger group or picky eaters.The restaurant's concept is to serve seasonal, locally available produce so the menu changes every day. I went in late spring and my meal was heavy on spring vegetables (asparagus, ramps) and as my boyfriend pointed out, each plate had a lot of ""leaves and flowers"" on it. Out of the 6 courses, 2 were vegetarian, 1 fish, 1 beef and 2 desserts. I thought the food was well done, and I liked the balance of different flavors and textures in each course. The second dessert was amazing, with some sort of crunchy corn powder sprinkled on ice cream. While I left comfortably satisfied, if you're really hungry I can see the portions not being enough.The service here was unfortunately disappointing though. From being ignored when we first arrived, to being forgotten about, it felt like all the servers were in a bad mood. For the price point, I would have liked for someone to have asked how we were doing at least once or to refill our water (they left a glass carafe of water at the table but when we finished it it remained empty).

Updated review","Contra reviewThere should be negative stars for attitude. Bad vibe at the bar. Bar tender snooty, her manager pretentious. Unrealistically optimistic estimate for dinner availability at the bar... Apparently ""very soon"" is about an hour in their parlance. The expression ""the customer is always right"" is new to them as they were not at all receptive to critique of one of their signature drinks, which was unpleasant and unpalatable (too lemony) - from 3 Seasoned Diners",1,,
163,Matthew H.,"Houston, TX",133,334,645,5.0,10/15/2014,"We have been hearing a good bit about Contra for a while, especially with the chef's pedigrees and I have to say that Contra more than lived up to the hype. The restaurant is very discreet and only has a small neon sign up inside the restaurant. So like other have mentioned you don't want to be walking around staring at your phone while trying to find this place. The restaurant itself is very minimalist and there is some cool art on the walls. The menu is very simple, 5 courses for $55 not including bread ($3) or cheese ($8) courses and of course this also excludes wine and liquor. There is a small bar with about 8 stools in the restaurant but where you want to go is the wine. The wine list isn't huge but it has enough to give you some really nice choices with dinner. There were 4 of us dining that night and we choose to start off with a bottle of white for the early courses and then moved to a bottle of red wine for the later courses. If you are interested in getting the bread and cheese course add-ons I would recommend, much like the restaurant, that you do 1 order per 2 people. The bread is a whole loaf of poppy-seed bread that is completely just amazing divine and the crunch of the bread is just amazing, the butter is also quite tasty. So for the first course the kitchen started off light and brought us a small salad of squash, fresh cheese, and dandelion, a perfect way to start the meal. Every ingredient was fresher than the next and the individual flavors worked well together. Our 2nd course consisted of mackerel, shallots, and herbs. Again this was perfect the fish was cooked to perfection with the skin seared, the shallots were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy and devoid of flavor. The 3rd course was beef short rib cooked medium rare, turnip, and seaweed. Again I can't find anything wrong with this dish other than the knives they give you at the table are awkwardly shaped and we had to guess which end to use to cut the ribs, at first I was using the wrong side and it still cut right through. This is where we received the cheese course which was more fun than the usual one you get. The chef grate cheese over a corn and cheese sauce and then top it with baked corn. so fun to eat and you get this giant plate of it. The first dessert course of the night was elderflower, pistachio, and olive oil which again was perfect and amazing. Our final dessert course was potato, yogurt, grains and seeds and I have to say that the potato gave it a very unique flavor and texture that I wasn't used to in a dessert but it worked beautifully. This is one of those reviews that I almost didn't want to write because Contra is so good that I don't want it getting any more exposure than it already is but people need to know this place exists.",6,2,2
164,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",374,758,1,2.0,1/16/2015,"Don't remember this $55 tasting menu place other than that it wasn't really worth the money simply because the food wasn't any better than the food in your average NYC restaurant. The price of $55 really shouldn't be that much of selling point either, as that sum isn't even close to worth it if the food is awful. Although the menu changes quite frequently, when we went in October I remember having the most terrible concoction ever in one of their desserts. It was just this massive foam bubblegum-color pile of awful tasting food. Too tart and too sweet. And that's all I remember from having eaten there 4 months ago. ....Oh well.",2,1,

166,Richard L.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",11,10,0,5.0,9/14/2014,"Simply superb...and not just because of the magic in the kitchen. The place is just class. I ate there for the first time a full 5 months ago. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a wonderful meal with my girlfriend. Looked after by Jen, on of their great staff members. We returned (long overdue) last Friday and as soon as we walked in Jen greeted us like old friends. Even asking about a trip we mentioned 5 months previously. I was blown away and gives you an insight into the attention to detail and professionalism they command. Now to the food....it's awesome. Come hungry and order the bread....you won't regret it.

It is just enough food, not overwhelming.  The service is also superb.  I can say that you will find no better value in NYC.  This is not a restaurant with atmosphere, the focus is on the cooking -- which is fine.  The restaurant is pleasant and the tables are not too cramped.  When we entered the restaurant we were escorted to our table instantly and were not kept waiting.

171,Andy A.,"Atlanta, GA",52,96,0,5.0,6/8/2014,These guys know what they are doing. You can tell they care about every dish and you can peer into the open kitchen from almost any table.

Service was exceptional. I will definitely be returning.,6,3,4

173,Will H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",11,68,6,5.0,5/27/2014,"Furthest restaurant from pretentious and ""trying too hard"". Even the exterior was simple and unassuming, just a small sign that said ""Contra"". Food kind of felt the same too: Nothing done just for the sake of doing it, but all the dishes were very unique and really noteworthy. I think the monkfish was outstanding, as well as the pork dish. The meal was really the perfect quantity of food and balanced well with the range of different flavors and of course, the dessert. I really appreciated the fact that nothing was over-seasoned, or too salty (the worst). The kitchen staff looked to be really calm and efficient and it was great to be able to watch them do their work. Kudos to the chefs! This was our 5-year anniversary dinner and I could definitely see this spot being ours in the future. Thanks for making it special.",5,2,2

There's a small bar at the front when you enter so you can wait if you get there early.Unassumingly decorated place with excellently cooked simple food. First course- asparagus of varying girth but all cooked perfectly. Second- bluefish was tender and good. Third- chicken breast BEST I've had. Yes, it's chicken and it's just perfect; the simply amazing skin was homogenously semi-thin and crispy, AND the breast was succulent. This place is the reason why you should pay for chicken; all other places do not compare. Fourth and Fifth- desserts were good as well.  Bread $3 and cheese $8 extra; both good, but bread better.  The bread has a great crust and comes with delicious creamy butter.Honestly, just come and enjoy a very good meal that just so happens to come with the best chicken. You're welcome everyone :)",4,2,2
176,Joao R.,"Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,2.0,10/10/2015,"I came here a couple of days ago. I'd already dined here 4 times, and every time it was ok. Good food, good service. Nothing spectacular, not the best food in NY, but a very decent, inventive food, for a reasonable price.Last time was a shit show! It was the day of a health inspection (which can disturb the restaurant dynamics), but I dont believe the shitshow was due to that.First, the food. Poorly cooked. Nothing to be remembered. After two solid appetizer, one actually quite tasty the fish dish was awful. And that is to put it politely. It was over cooked. Rubery. Dry. Simply bad. But then came the bread, and we were willing to forgive the bad fish. The bread was amazing, and the butter equally delicious. We ordered another bread, so excited about it! After that, it was all down hill...The veal was again overcooked. It was literally brown everywhere. Not even a hint of red on the core. One more piece of rubber in my plate...The second bread came cold. Literally cold. I mean below room temperature. The crust was warm, but the core was fridge temperature. Anyone who had touched it would realize it was not the proper temperature... What a disappointment...The dessert dishes deserve no mention. Neither good nor bad, simply ok. Nothing to talk about. But the service!! AHHH THE SERVICE!!! That was the low point of the night. I understand that due to the health inspection the speed of the courses was reduced, I understand that and we were very patient with the slow rhythm. We arrived at 9 (only slot available) and at 11 the last dessert had not come yet. But worse than that, after the veal I ordered a drink, and was told that the bar was already closed. THE BAR WAS CLOSED BEFORE DESSERT. You got to be kidding me. The kitchen was almost completely clean before the dessert came. Again, you got to be kidding your clients. Outside, I met people form the other 6 last tables and we all agreed that we fell rushed towards the end of the meal. This is unacceptable! It is their problem if they have a health inspection, I understand that delays the employees and the food, and demands more of the staff. But the customer can never have a worse experience due to it. I was in other top restaurants when health inspection occurred and the reaction was opposite. The staff was extra careful, some places even gave free rounds of drinks. One should always leave the place happy---no matter what.Well, I guess this was my fourth and last try at this place.",2,2,1

178,Josh J.,"ASTORIA, NY",22,81,37,5.0,3/3/2014,"All the dishes in the 5 course pre fix were delicious but a few really gave our table of 4 an education in food.  If I'm droppin' some coin on a nice meal, I require new channels in my brain to be opened up.   This raw scallop, lemon confit, broccoli rabe dish was really refreshing and memorable.   Nothing a home cook like myself could dream up.  The favorite at the table was a desert.  Tangerine, pop corn, ice cream thing that hit ya mouth in all kinds of strange and wonderful ways.  By the time we left, we were all the exact perfect amount of full and all agreed we'd had a great meal.  It's on the high price point but not over the top.   Affordable for a working stiff a few times a year.",7,4,5

Updated review","Tried Contra again brought my gf this time after a really positive experience the first time around.This time it was even better.Standout dishes were the- kohlrabi starter. I had never had it before and it was a tasty refreshing new experience.- chicken breast. cooked perfectly with flavorful skin just a tiny bit crispy. also an awesome side of pureed sunchoke- dehydrated apple shaved ice on some golden oats and cream/yoghurt. (whatever it was exactly, it was fantastic!)just a really comfortable experience with upscale food in a very unpretentious environment.",11,9,9
181,Kimberly H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,12/8/2013,"The first time I went to Contra, it was a disaster. I live nearby and had wanted to try it for a long time, but after 90 minutes, my guest and I had only received our first course and were too hungry to wait for the next four. Contra had just opened, kinks were bound to happen, so I gave it another chance. And I am so glad I did!!!!!! The meal was absolutely magical. From the amazing homemade bread (extra $3, and SO worth it!) to the perfectly cooked chicken to the wonderfully unique and delicious desserts, I don't think that I've had any other meal that compares. Because of the slow pacing last time, I told the waitstaff that my guest and I had theater tickets for 8pm, and they did a wonderful job accommodating our tight schedule, getting us out in plenty of time for the show. In short, Contra is an incredible restaurant that is a welcome addition to a slower block on the LES. I can't wait to go back!",11,4,9
182,An N.,"New York, NY",37,133,28,4.0,2/1/2015,"Overall, I had a good experience at Contra. The ambiance is relaxed and casual, but the food is slightly more elevated. It's a good environment to enjoy a meal in (although the space is somewhat on the smaller side).While the 5 course set menu was satisfying and delicious, I thought the desserts stood out more than the first 3 savory dishes. They arrive looking deceptively simple, but each bite hides unexpected flavors and textures. - The day's menu started with a plate of persimmon, ham and squash with black sesame seeds. I thought this was a nice play on the ""melon and ham"" model. The persimmon's firmer texture adds to the pleasing qualities of the dish.  - Second was a pollock filet with brussels sprout leaves, horseradish sauce and dusting of matcha powder. The matcha is pretty subtle and I'd say I couldn't really taste it. The fish is well cooked and tender, flaking easily with a fork. This one was pretty simple in flavor, I thought.- Third was a veal breast with a roasted beet and treviso. The veal is glazed in a sweet sauce and was tender without being mushy. However, one of the plates at my table had a particularly stringy piece of veal that was difficult for the diner to cut/eat. - The coffee parfait and Meyer lemon dessert was the first dessert course we had - there's a caramel sauce hidden beneath the white cloud of lemony foam, and some crunchy textures hidden within. I liked this dessert the best. The tartness of the lemon played an unexpectedly perfect role against the bitter notes of the coffee and caramel. - Our final course was a dessert of popcorn and some fruit that I can't recall now. It was like an orange granita with popcorn dust over the top and bits of caramelized popcorn within. I thought this dessert was playful and interesting, but not as intriguing, flavor-wise, as the coffee lemon dessert.The servers seem a little overworked, constantly going from one table to the next and back to the kitchen. It makes the environment all seem a little rushed (although the plates didn't come out too quickly at all). Other notes - the bread is delicious, and comes out crackly and warm with softened butter.- A tequila, celery and tarragon cocktail was had and very much recommended. It was light and easy to drink, but not sugary sweet or watery. There's this savory kick at the end of each sip that makes for an interesting drink. I would have another in a heartbeat.",,,
183,Lea N.,"Annandale, VA",2,23,158,4.0,2/4/2015,"VERY good for its price. I heard their motto was to provide fine-dining taste without having to pay the tremendously expensive fine-dining price.

185,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",3,59,0,2.0,10/1/2015,"Food was on par with an ambitious culinary school graduate.  While not terrible, it definitely wasn't memorable.  The housemade bread and butter was the standout ""dish"".  It took 3 hrs for a five course meal....and while it seemed the kitchen may have been backed up, it was obvious when looking into the open kitchen, that they were just slow cooks, unorganized, and not well prepared for the amount of covers for the night.  This has to be one of my most disappointing meals to date.    And while the $67 tasting menu seems like a steal, it reflects in the quality of the experience.   In my personal opinion, the price tag just appeals to inexperienced diners, who  have overly hyped this restaurant up to be something more than it is.",1,,

187,Alex Z.,"Chicago, IL",26,27,4,4.0,11/17/2013,Fun place to go with friendly staff. This place is a steal. 5 course menu. Although you can definitely tell which courses get more attention and thought than others. You won't find anything here overly sophisticated just some simple dishes done well. That was the experience we had. They do put just enough thought to stand out but still be accessible to everyday folks. I think this is the direction more places should head. The place would improve vastly if they had a coat check given the tight packing of the tables. I would return as it's hard to find a comparable place that is not impossible to get into to. It's definitely under the radar.,5,,2

I thought there was enough different dishes to not be bored. More protein than I expected - my favorite was the beef on beets on marrow and the fish. There is enough space (huge plus for a LES spot) to be comfortable and have a conversation. It took a few phone calls to make a reservation as an email went un-answered. Not sure if that's typical. I arrived at 930p on a Tues night so there wasn't much of a wait anyway. Service is spotty - sometimes really involved and friendly, and other times.. not so much.
