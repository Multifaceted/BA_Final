0,Lori A.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",27,289,292,4.0,11/2/2018,Stepped into this location for a late lunch directly after work. It wasn't busy this time. The location is industrial and super clean. The staff seemed nice enough and the menu prices were $1 to $2 more than the Gateway Center location. Not out of the usual as it is Midtown.I ordered my burger. They brought it out to me and I was able to eat it and thoroughly enjoyed it.It's a tiny bit out of my way home but I stopped in because I wanted to try this location after being familiar with the Gateway Center location.Consistency is the same across the board. I will return.,1,,
1,Kenneth H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,4,0,1.0,11/18/2018,"I came here with my boyfriend about a month ago and ordered a meal to go and waited over an hour. All that time the staff kept walking back and forth obviously seeing me and my boyfriend just standing there without food. No one came up to us to ask ""How we were"" or ""Can I help you?"". I had already gone up to the register once and asked about my meal, the person said it should be out any minute. We finally got our food in the end, but they should've offered a discount for next time or some kind of compensation for waiting so long.",,,
2,Kinsley B.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,11/5/2018,Don't waste your timeBought a smash pass with the purpose of saving time and money. It didn't. I went during my lunch break. One person on the register during the rush lunch hour. Waited over 20 min for my one sandwich. Everyone who ordered after me got there food. The person giving out food prioritized milkshakes over the food waiting to get distributed. She checked my ticket multiple times still no food. I left without my sandwich or I would have been late getting back to work.  The person handing it food also was I charge of the garbage and never washed her hands. Guess I wasted $100 On a smash pass because it doesn't seem worth it to keep going back,,,
3,Tara W.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",18,107,274,5.0,10/11/2018,This burger is awesome and the service is THE BEST!! I am not a burger or pizza person. I don't like fast food but once in a while is fine and it has to be really good if I'm eating a burger. I went here with two other friends in K-town. I told them I don't want burgers but my friend she said oh you should try their burgers and I told her I past through this place many times and once my boyfriend even got burgers for himself and I didn't cuz I didn't wanna try and be disappointed. So firstly the cashier was nice and really fast. Got our order and sat on the table waiting for burgers. Now this place is bigggg and spacious... while chatting and waiting this lady brought our burgers  and I'm like oooohh they serve you on the table and I was surprised cuz even shake shack doesn't do that. So I tried my burger and it wasn't that big and tasteless. It was quite a good size and juicy and I love my burgers juicy. The burger here is yummy. One of the best I had and after we are done the lady said just leave the trays on the table and someone will pick it up. What a service. I felt like I got my full money back. Thank you and I will definitely come back.,,,
4,Steve L.,"New York, NY",131,269,1043,3.0,3/15/2018,"4 stars for the food itself, 3 stars for service. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could go halvsies.So I stopped in since I stumbled upon a $3 for an entree coupon. Having seen hundreds of ""sssssssmashburger"" commercials, I decided to give it a shot. I looked up the menu and saw a Spinach, Cucumber & Goat Cheese Burger with balsamic dressing. Now, I'd eat goat cheese off of tree bark, but if you're telling me a 'fast-food'-type chain (""fast"" to be questioned further below), and goat cheese is an option - I'd take that over some shack-burger any day.So, I arrive at the store and place my order (went 'big' size because an entree is an entree is an entree), asking that they please don't add butter to the burger buns. Not a problem I'm told. 15 mins later, still no burger with other customers coming and going. And this is at around 2:15-30, so a bit past the lunch rush. Alas, so much for the 'fast' part (even if we call it 'casual'). That said, the person bagging up all the orders realized the...longevity of my order wait, and added an order of regular fries to my meal for free, which was thoughtful - not that was really itching for fries, having gone through the whole 'don't butter my bread' request - but the thoughtfulness was appreciated nonetheless.And the burger was delicious. So, will I give these guys another shot? With another coupon, absolutely.",1,,
5,Peng L.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,354,1274,2.0,12/20/2017,"Very mediocre burger. Came here on a B1G1 free coupon promotion. The meat was ""cheap"" as my coworker said. I had to agree, compared with shake shack or Five Guys this patty contained a lot of lower end ingredients and scraps. The total for two was $16 WITH coupon, would have been $23 without. And that's simply too expensive for the quality.",2,,
6,Jesus R.,"Paterson, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,11/17/2018,Spent $33 dollars on 2 avocado deluxe with fries and a drink. Burger was slightly thin and a bit small for the price. Same as the fries. Very little. So disappointed I wasted this money on this. The quality and portion of all this should not be this price.,,,
7,Jerrius J.,"Bronx, North Hempstead, NY",220,147,334,2.0,11/11/2017,"Just not a great place to spend money for food.  I had a coupon so it was two sandwiches for one and that was why I came in.  I got the chicken sandwich that had was supposed to be covered in hot sauce with blue cheese. Based on the photo, you can see only about 1/3rd of it had hot sauce and there was a ball of blue cheese in the middle so only two of my many bites actually had the right combination of ingredients; not what I was hoping for in that sandwich.The next day, I had the new york sandwich and reheated, that sandwich with the combination of onions and some smash sauce was good.  There were busy when I came in and that might have been why the first sandwich fell flat but I still prefer shake shack to it if given the option.",1,1,
8,Joey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,5,5.0,4/10/2018,"Smashburger is one of my favorite burger places to eat in the city! The food is absolutely amazing and I definitely recommend the smashfries. Pricing is great for the food and location and the dining area is always maintained well. The staff is always super friendly and nice and they will bring you your food after you order it. The burgers are always delicious and presentable. They look as good as they taste, especially the bbq bacon cheeseburger. Add a side of smash fries and it's the perfect meal. The ability to create your own burger is really cool and there are multiple types of burgers (beef turkey etc)I've been to the W33 St location multiple times and each time I was very satisfied.",2,1,1
9,June L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,41,60,5.0,11/13/2017,"Honestly so pleased with my experience here. We came in an hour before closing. but service was still prompt and attentive. I got the New Yorker, which came with grilled onions, spinach, NY cheddar, and a peppercorn garlic aioli. It was a fantastic, well-balanced combo and just hit the spot for me. The patty was flavorful and juicy, the spinach was fresh, and the aioli was creamy and distinct but not too overpowering. My only small complaint is that I think it's a little pricey for a burger, especially when you're getting fries or a drink with it. But it was such a good experience that I think it's worth.",,,1
10,Li M. H.,"New York, NY",273,117,973,5.0,7/15/2018,"Very friendly staff and food is good. I bought the smashpass for $1 entree for 45days for $45. I must admit, this was a really good deal. They had it available back in Novemeber and I missed my opportunity, but they decided to run the deal again in January and I had to jump on it. There's a smashburger downstairs my office so its pretty convenient for me and I made use of my pass. Thankfully the pass was good for salads and burgers. In case I get tired of burgers, I can have the salad.The smashpass is a great opportunity to try every burger on the menu as well featured burgers. Its convenient that smashburger is downstairs my office. There's always a deal, free side after a survey is done, $2 off, bogo, they're really good at getting people to come back.Their milkshake is nice and thick, not runny. Soda comes with unlimited refill since the fountain is made available for people that stay. Place is always clean unless they're overwhelmed with the lunch rush. The staff here make sure everyone that visits is satisfied with their experience!They know what keeps the customers coming back!",1,,
11,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,474,474,2.0,1/27/2018,"I came here to try their black bean burger - their one vegetarian burger.  I ordered the black bean burger on a multigrain bun with ranch sauce (sauces free) and cheddar cheese (70 cents extra).  The toppings are unlimited and free - lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and pickles.  I also ordered the sweet potato smash fries.  I had a coupon for $3 off so I only paid about $7.50 for the black bean burger and fries.  The burger was super greasy and the black bean patty didn't have anything in it besides black beans.  They could at least put veggies or something else since the texture was way too mushy and there was no bite to it.  The sweet potato fries were not even crispy, pretty mushy as well.  I doubt I would come back even if I had another coupon since the food was not good.  I would rather go to Shake Shack or Five Guys if I wanted a burger.",3,,
12,Cathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",514,86,171,4.0,7/25/2018,Honestly this was such a good affordable burger experience. Burger was yummy and filling and super affordable. Tater tots were fancy with rosemary and olive oil. There was also a good selection of draft beer and amazing-looking milkshakes. But honestly the two things that will have me going back are the super kind and friendly customer service and the price.,,,
13,Sagir P.,"Alexandria, VA",245,271,378,3.0,7/2/2018,"Nothing too crazy!! Had a burger, fries and shake and seemed really ordinary. Would choose another burger place around the corner over this. Flavors are ok but nothing with a wow factor. Service takes some time but staff is friendly.",,,
14,Teresa N.,"San Francisco, CA",108,678,1123,4.0,11/30/2017,"Decent burger for under $10.. I have tried most of the burgers on their menu and my personal favorite was the truffle mushroom Swiss burger, so truffle here means truffle oil, which goes really well with mushroom and Swiss cheese.. bread was also decent, they used egg buns for the burger. Don't forget to ad a side of sweet fries or tator totes.. by the way they have draft beer too!",2,,1
15,Joanna T.,"Queens, NY",12,81,1921,1.0,4/16/2017,"Today was my first time ever coming to smash burger. I'm unsure whether all locations have such rude staff or if it's just this location. From the moment I walked up to the cash register, I felt the most unwelcome I've ever felt at any fast food place I can think of up to today. I said hi to the clerk; I was ignored. I told her it was my first time here and if there was anything she recommended; she handed me a menu and looked back down. While I was ordering, I couldn't hear her mumbling so I said sorry? She rolled her eyes and raised her attitude, repeatedly. I have never come across a more impatient person ever ordering food from anywhere. At least other hostesses pretend to be nice. On the other hand, the food was delicious. I ordered a sandwich and a shake. It was brought up to our table. Would I come back to this location? No. There are many other smash burger/ etc burger joints with yummy food and employees that don't ruin your day.",3,,1
16,Girish K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,2,3.0,6/30/2018,Thanks for giving me 70% full cup of milk shake...even the staff was rude to us. Told us that we need to get out of their way when they walk to deliver food to tables as we waited to get our order on line.,,,
17,Winnie C.,"Queens, New York, NY",8,91,370,4.0,3/27/2017,"I wanted a burger and didn't feel like going to a bar to get it for lunch. I've been to many Smashburgers and this place was not that customer intuitive. The line starts at the wall. So head to your right. Then when you order, the paper menu does not have prices. It's displayed on the monitor. Once you are done ordering. Depending on if your eating in or taking it to go, there's a difference. Eating in you will get a number sign for your order. So that you can display on your table. They will then bring you your order. If you are taking out, you stand by the 'bar' area. But on the side if where the soda fountains are, because the other side is for employees only. Totally not noticable at all. If you stand there you will just be in everyone's way. I ordered the Bacon and Cheese Burger with Haystack Onions. The onion 'rings' were more like shoe string style. Messy to eat, but still good. Comes with special sauce on the side. The burger is cooked one way. Well done. I wouldn't mind coming back to try a different burger and maybe fries instead.",2,,
18,Damien C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,10,4.0,9/18/2017,First time having smashburger and I went with the triple double and tots. I will say it was very good burger seasoned well and also the tots. I also ordered a chicken sandwich to go and that also was quite good. Service was great kinda surprised me at how good it was. I will definitely be going back. Pros: you can have a cold beer while waiting. Wait time is not long at all.Cons: A bit greasy both the burger and the tots I had to use a lot of napkins.,2,,
19,Larz R.,"Jonesboro, AR",76,54,80,3.0,3/3/2018,"Meh. It's a burger joint. Nothing more. Burgers. Fries. Onion rings. Milkshakes. I thought the burgers would be bigger. I ordered the triple double, thinking it might be too much for me. It wasn't. It was tasty, but it wasn't any better than burgers I've had at any other burger joint. The fries were just... fries.The students I had with me thought the same thing. They had different burgers, but no one raved about what they ordered.The truffle mushroom Swiss ran about $8. The classic smash had a price of $6.69 before you add $5.29 just to add fries and a drink. The club smash priced at $8 before the combo add-on. My triple double ran $7 before the fries and drink combo.In all, it wasn't worth the price. We had about $35-40 worth of food experience for over $56.",2,1,1
20,James R.,"Jamaica, NY",111,53,79,3.0,3/5/2018,Not a bad burger but not the best burger either. Service was a lil slow but the staff was friendly. It can go either way with this one. Still rather eat here over Mcdonalds and Burger King.,1,,
21,N F.,"New York, NY",79,60,55,5.0,2/5/2018,"Definitely a fan of this location, and much better than at Dekalb, and somewhat better than at William (except for a few people).Firstly, they always get my order right, and sometimes will remember my repeat order if I forget to ask.The staff's really sweet - Samantha, Antoinette, Nellie (also my name), and the manager in particular.

22,Janet Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,178,379,3.0,6/27/2017,"I felt like having a burger but didn't feel like waiting on a long line (ahem, shake shack) so I decided to try Smash burger. I pass by it daily on my morning commute and it's always good to find an alternative burger spot when you're in the mood for a burger.Anyway, I just got the classic smash burger and I was a tad disappointed. The egg bun was soggy and the burger was put together in such a sloppy manner that everything was falling all over the place. It comes in a container so maybe walking a few blocks jostle the burger to fall apart? I'm not quite sure. The fries were ok. They're shoestring fries so really thin and just not much of a potato bite to it. Not crispy enough either in my opinion. But then again if it was too crispy, it might end up tasting like potato stix. I don't know if I will go back honestly but maybe if I'm really desperate for a burger?",1,,1
23,Rob N.,"San Diego, CA",26,25,6,5.0,1/16/2018,The tots and fries are so good. The burger I had was the New Yorker with jalapeños added. It was really tasty. I'd compare it to In n out which I know some people may be surprised with. I actually thought it had more flavor.,,,1

My daughter said she likes it better than Shake Shack or Schnipper's. Only one she still likes more is Burger Fi. My daughter had the regular Smashburger and regular Smash Fries. I had special order burger, multi grain bun, mayo, goat cheese, and lettuce. Naturally I had sweet potato fries. The final result was no indigestion from eating too many spices!! Just plain old fresh natural taste. I rarely eat beef so that's saying something. I want to go back to try the chicken and the Avocado Club Burger. Both sound good!!",33,19,27
25,Lisa P.,"New York, NY",0,12,5,2.0,9/17/2018,"Ordered a triple double. Pretty sure the cheese was the triple. But there was no way the burger patties were a double. I think there was less meat there than a single regular burger. The patties didn't even cover the bun. Very disappointed. I have been to Smashburgers in other places and ordered the triple double. They was 2 regular sized patties and 3 slices cheese. To add insult to injury, the bun was stale and the patties and fries were way to salty. Don't bother with this place. For the same price take a small walk down 5th and go to Shake Shack.",,,
26,Ysabella G.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",131,33,33,3.0,6/25/2018,"I love their burgers sooo much. We ordered in advance for pick up at 12:10 to be ready at 12:45. I was waiting 20 min longer as food was ready at 1:05. It's a very busy lunch hour but scheduled meals should at least be in order. Our fries were also more than half empty (""large order""). People around me who were there already waiting for dine in orders were still waiting when I left, I had gotten there early at 12:35.

However, after a few bites it was very obvious that smash burger grease has/ and will always win against any competitors (if we talk about how greasy/oily one can get a burger to be).The smashfries was mediocre at best with the fries neither hot, nor fresh out of the fryer - just warm.The burger was also over cooked.Please go to shake shack or five guys for burgers if u are looking to try a burger joints around the area.

Went to this location tonight around 8pm, waited at the counter for long time before anyone came out from the kitchen to take my order. I ordered a burger, fries, and a milkshake. $17!!! That is ridiculous, and the milkshake only added $3 to this cost - so it would have been $14 for a burger, fries, and soda. The burger and fries came out quickly, but the shake never arrived. I asked for a refund and the ""manager"" argued with me on how much I should be refunded. Eventually, after way too much use of my iPhone calculator, the ""manager"" agreed to refund the full $5.29 of the milkshake. The burger and fries were sloppy and tasted about as good as the $5 version at Wendy's or Burger King. Go there instead - or really just anywhere but Smashburger.",1,,

I'm sorry but nowhere does McDonald's or Burger King compare as written by some other reviewers. I recommend the New Yorker smashburger and the spicy baja smashburger.  Oh and of course the smash fries but be warned the smash fries are oily as hell but the flavors packed into those oily as hell potatoes is worth it!  The regular size for fries is more than enough to share amongst 2 people. (I had to knock of a star due to the amount of oil on the food) A perk about this place is you can get a decent beer on draft with your burger too! The space is clean, the staff makes an effort to immediately clear off tables. All in all.. Want a burger but you're in a rush? Stop in here for a decent one!",3,3,1

38,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,10/14/2015,"Smash burger is a really solid burger joint in Midtown. It seems like every single time that I would talk to friends the name smash burger would get brought up. So finally I decided to come here and try the food.Smash Burger is located on W. 33rd St. in midtown right across from the Empire State building. The inside is pretty big there are high top tables and low tables.To be completely honest with you I thought that's smash burger would be more like a five guys. Ordering here is interesting. 1st you go up and place your order. Then you get a sign with a number. You can pick any table open in smash burger to sit at. You put the sign on the table and wait for your food. They have servers that bring the food to your table and clean it up. The menu at smash Burger isn't the biggest. They have 8 signature burger items they also have a few chicken sandwiches and salads. The burgers are a step up from 5 guys. The burgers are the classic smash, avocado burger,BBQ bacon cheddar burger, buffalo blue cheese, spicy jalapeño , spinach and goat cheese and truffle mushroom and Swiss burger. The chicken sandwiches have the same names just made with chicken instead of beef. The drinks here are all fountain drinks so when you place your order you get a cup and you have to walk over and get your own drink. For a first timer the ordering process confuse the heck out of me.  It's food that's cooked fast but they have tableservice. I ended up getting a barbecue bacon cheddar smash burger. The burger had bacon barbecue sauce and onion straws on top with a egg bun. We got a small regular fries to share which was more than enough for two people. We got two burgers and french fries and two drinks and our total came to $21. I thought that the price was extremely good for what we got especially in Midtown. I was really surprised at how the burger was cooked.  I thought the food was really good the bacon was really crispy the onion straws were crispy and you could taste every part of the burger. The portions here are not that big but I guess that's the point. I thought The amount of food we got was really good for the price. There was this extremely hot girl that walked into this restaurant when I was eating the burger. The girl was definitely some sort of a model absolutely beautiful. I probably made an idiot out of myself when I saw her but my point is is that it's a really beautiful model is eating the food here more than likely on her cheat day it says something about the place. Overall smash Burger is definitely a step up from McDonald's or any other fast food you actually get service with your meal and it takes a little bit longer to get but it's well worth it. You can dine in or get your order to go. I do recommend coming here after work or if you just want to grab something quick to eat that's not going to fill you up and put you in a food coma. PROS:- good prices for midtown- staff was friendly- food was cooked good CONS:- the process of getting your food can be confusing for a first timer. They do have table service and table clean up.",2,6,2

I ordered the Create Your Own Big Burger with cheese, bacon, mushroom, onions & jalapeños. Happy they cooked my burger well done which is what I requested. However, I can't say this burger was any better tasting than a Five Guys burger. I had a DoorDash promo code so I can't say I would order it again if I had to pay full price.",,,

46,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",5,14,17,4.0,7/7/2016,"Delicious fast food chain burgers. It's one of those ""gourmet"" fast food places like that of Chipotle or Shake Shack. The quality is above what you'll get at Taco Bell or McDonald's so expect to pay a little more as well. All in all, it's average for a Midtown lunch and super cheap for a quick dinner.First visit I tried the Classic Smash with beef. It was good, your standard burger. Reminded me a bit of Five Guys but I would rank this higher, however Shake Shack still takes the crown!My next visit, I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss with crispy chicken... absolutely amazing. I can't bring myself to order anything else when I go now, not even trying to swap the crispy chicken for the grilled. The mushrooms are always done perfectly and pair really well with the swiss. The fried chicken is juicy and its crispy coating has the perfect crunch. Truffle mayo is the best part, held together with an egg bun- a nice (and yummy) surprise to the usual burger buns.Smashfries are a must-try, it gets a bit oily, especially towards the bottom of the basket but I don't care because it's delicious. The Haystack Onions are so thin it's hard to tell if there are onions in there, but I still enjoyed them. Fried pickles were forgettable.From the outside, it looks like it will be tiny but the place is actually spacious for this area and it's clean!

50,Kevin E.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,584,923,3.0,8/31/2015,"2.5 stars.Uhh can I say overpriced?? So my friend and I came here for lunch at around 1pm and there was a long line because the service was really slow. I really think they need more workers because having only two cashiers during the lunch rush just isn't going to cut it. However, the cashier that we got was super friendly and nice so extra points for that! After you order, they give you a stand with your order number on it and you take it to any available table. When your food is ready, a worker searches for your number and brings you your food. While this system does alleviate the dilemma of people crowding around the register waiting for their food, it is quite a hassle for the workers to search around the whole restaurant for your order number. There must be a more efficient way for them to locate you.Classic smashburger- It wasn't bad tasting but it didn't really wow me. Honestly, it tasted like a burger that I could've gotten at McDonald's for a SMALL fraction of the price. However, I must admit that the smash sauce that they put in the burger was delicious and was definitely the highlight! The egg bun was tasty as well.Avocado club chicken- Very tasty and way better than the classic smash! That does mean more $$$ though lol but I think it's worth it. The chicken and bacon were super crispy and the avocado mixed very well with the sauces and the meat. If possible, I would've switched the multigrain bun for another bun.Smashfries- Not good...they were just way too greasy. They're not crispy at all and are thinly cut which I despise. They did have a nice rosemary aroma to them though but that in itself could not save them.1 classic smashburger, 1 avocado club smashchicken, 2 smashfries, and 2 sodas ended up being $25 which I found kind of unreasonable...Again, the food isn't bad but not amazing enough to justify the high prices. Service was great and decor looks similar to that of Chipotle. Sorry Smashburger, but Shake Shack wins.",,,

A string of unpleasant comments followed by the cashier.  I felt insulted, rushed, and annoyed.  Hoping the burger would be better than the terrible interaction I was sadly disappointed.  The burger which was a greasy mess fell apart before my second bite.  The slop of ingredients was more than I could scoop back and reassemble my burger.  Also Medium should not be completely pink.  Aside from thinking I was going to get sick I was really upset about the whole experience.  I will never be going back.  RUUUUDE STAFFFF BEWARE.",2,,
56,Elizabeth W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,1.0,8/28/2018,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this Smash Burger location and let me tell you it was extremely disappointing. While I have never had a great experience at this particular location (it is usually a mess, slow service, less than stellar attitude/disposition of employees), this experience really takes the cake. The time printed on my receipt when I placed my order was 8:52 pm. I did not receive the burger I ordered until 9:22, exactly a half hour after placing this order. I was informed that the fries would be out shortly, another 7 minutes later they arrived. The quality of the food was not ideal, as the burger was extremely greasy with overdone  bacon and the fries were so greasy they were moist and all clumped together. An associate came to me before receiving my burger and asked if I was still waiting for my food, to which I responded yes. Nothing else was said. When my burger arrived, I was told ""sorry for the wait, fries will be out shortly"". Just before the 7 minutes before my fries arrived, another associate asked if I was still waiting on fries. As always the self service counter was not well stocked and both the fork and knife containers were completely empty. It really was shocking to wait over half an hour for my meal and for it not even to be absolute perfection. And let me tell you, the restaurant was empty, there were no other customers so there really was no reason that I could see for the delay - especially since the team was not busy cleaning or maintaining the restaurant. While the concept of having team members collect trash and empty trays from tables is nice for diners to not have to deal with, it leaves the restaurant looking like a junk heap. This was not my first bad experience at this particular location, however it certainly will be my last. I am tired of giving this establish my business for mediocre food, terrible service, and an overall terrible experience. Perhaps instead of calling yourselves Smash Burger, you could try Trash Burger instead - because that is the level of service and respect I received this evening.",,,
57,Jonathon H.,"Manhattan, NY",223,66,212,2.0,2/6/2016,"So I'm currently sitting in smash burger finishing up my spicy fries writing this review. I came here because I had a birthday deal coupon. It allows you to buy an entree and get a shake for free. I've never done smash before so figured this would be a good way to try out the place. But after eating this meal I'm fine with calling it quits. First off let me say that the staff is nice and friendly. They are quick with the orders and hard working. So I ordered a regular buffalo smash. This comes with buffalo sauce, blue cheese a thin piece of lettuce and 2 tiny tomatoes on a single meat patty. As you can tell I'm already not satisfied. The party was wafer thin and bland while the buffalo and cheese didn't seem to mix well. The fries which is a regular spicy fries were surprisingly hot which I enjoyed. The only downside is that they were very salty so my mouth is parched at the moment. The last item I got was the free shake. This was of course a salted caramel shake. By all intensive purposes the shake looks like a vanilla shake. Normally a company distinguishes their shakes by adding extra caramel down the glass side before pouring in the shake but no such luck here. Anyway the shake has a weird off beat taste that I can't seem to figure out. Overall I would pass on this fast food type chain and go with a good old fashioned Burger King burger and shake. I haven't had Burger King in about 4 years so that is saying something.",4,3,2

First, the restaurant is very clean and has ample seating. There are private, as well as communal tables for people to share. Being my first time ever at a Smashburger, I ordered the Classic Smash Burger with Smash Fries and a Strawberry Shake. The burgers are a bit pricey, but it's to be expected as Smash Burger is competing with the likes of Shake Shack and Five Guys, so is in the same price range as them.After we ordered, we sat down at a table, not realizing that they actually bring your order to you! How awesome is that at a fast food restaurant?! The burger and fries were brought in a small metal basket with the burger not being fully completed yet, meaning the burger and cheese was on one patty and the lettuce, tomato and pickle were on the other. I had no qualms about that because it made it easier for me to squirt some ketchup onto it. The shake was brought out in a big glass cup and I love that they give you the mixer with the remaining part of the shake so that you don't get ripped off.The burger was juicy, but not overflowing. It was a rather simple burger, but had all the ingredients to make it real good!  The fries were thin and very good too. They were not soggy or greasy at all. The shake was perfect, not too thick, but not watery either.Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Smashburger.

Were there avocados? Yes, a great amount but they needed one more day to be ripe. they also had a slight slimy taste on them. the bun was good, thick and filling that actually held everything on the burger inside.the worst part of this meal was of course..the fries. thin and hard at first, that soon turned into thin and soggy and flimsy fries. why did this happen? well apparently smash burger likes to drown their fries in the oil (rosemary and oil fries). i was basically paying for a heart attack here. they were only around $3, but i had maybe 1/4 of them and had to tap out.The staff is nice, place is clean, decent music & they bring your food to you.over rated, disgusting and not worth the $10 and up you will spend. especally if youre a non-meat eating person like i am.",5,3,

I'm broke this week so this was perfect timing, but even if I had money I'd be here for this delicious opening. The employees were friendly, excited, super smiley, and engaging waiting customers in a cutely awkward first day banter. The jolly but rock-and-roll looking proprietor was proudly showing off the location to his guests (though they were blocking the area near the soda machines!).The line moved quickly; soon it was my turn to order my free burger and smash fries. These are shoestring (skinny) fries doused in rosemary and garlic... don't come here without trying them!  All sauces are free so you can slather up your burger any way you like.Smashburger offers a tight range of burgers, salads, shakes and fries, which means they are really good at the ""few"" items they make. The new location is on a slightly still seedy stretch of midtown west, but is a quick, convenient, and actually reasonably priced option for lunch in the area. Come check them out... you'll be glad you did!  Would be four stars (I'm a fan!) but upgraded to five because they maintained their prices and didn't go crazy on the increase just because they're in Manhattan.  If I have to say one thing I don't like, it's that they didn't open when I was working at Macy's around the corner.",5,1,4

Awesome for a fast food chain to have goat cheese...which is easier to digest in case you have lactose intolerance. It was served with a balsamic vinaigrette. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal but I wish the chicken it came with was a bigger portion. The chicken breast was very thin piece. I loved is how great the texture was on the chicken breast. It was super moist. I hardly eat chicken breast meat in general because of the dry texture but at Smash Burger it is completely the opposite of dry. Makes me question why can't anyone else get the chicken breast meat as moist as Smash Burger. I also tried the Smash Fries which is tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. It was tasty but too greasy. The fries are thin shoestring style so there is a crisper feeling to the fries which I am ok with.

EGG BUN was soft and an appreciated change up from your normal bun. Overly generous ""Smash sauce"" tasted more like a ketchup mustard blend, leaking from your burger towards the end.Smash Fries - advertised as seasoned with olive oil/rosemary/garlic, they're thinner than shoestring fries and floppy (yes borderline soggy). There's potential, but nothing special to note here for now.For getting in line that just started to loop around the corner onto 5th Ave the wait was surprisingly bearable, as service was super speedy and friendly once we got inside.I'll be returning to gauge some of their other burgers and try their shakes!",2,,

The fries here are super thin and crispy just so good for a French fry addict like me. And the simple classic shakes just tie everything together. It's good for takeout or to eat in. With the parking lot they have it makes it really easy to come and visit this smashing burger spot.,,2,1
86,Jessica L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",697,313,788,4.0,4/24/2014,"I've been dying to come here since I saw the coming soon sign and attempted to do so on their opening day but upon seeing the line curve around the corner down the street I figured it be best to wait for another day.I was surprised by how large and spacious the interior was with various different types of seating arrangements. Near the front are long tables with high chairs as well as seating against the wall, there are also closer intimate booth type seating toward the back as well as a stand up counter near the register, how cool! They offer regular beef patties as well as an option for chicken or a veggie black bean. They have pre made burger options as well as additional add ons such as avocado and bacon. I ordered a ""small"" smash burger and fries. I was very pleased with how quick we got our food. A waiter came by with our burgers laid out on a metal tray, full service I didn't expect from a burger joint. I want to take a minute to speak about the staff only that they were so attentive and sweet, Yvonne simply didn't bring us our food and walk away but she made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed (cups, knives, forks). Even when we finished our food someone came by and picked up our empty trays and cleared our tables for us. A pleasant added bonus to our meal! My burger was amazing, don't let the name confuse you, small will get you plenty full. The burger was juicy and not overcooked. It was also served on an egg bun which I had never heard of but it complemented the flavors very well. The fries here are to die for. If you love them skinny and crispy you are in the right place! There is an option for smash fries or regular, the smash fries are topped with olive oil and rosemary, delicious at first but after downing a burger the oil gets a bit heavy. As for drinks they also have a full case of drinks as well as a fountain drink station and different ice tea options. My next plan of attack is their hand spun milkshakes!",1,,
87,Meredith H.,"Corolla, NC",102,14,5,1.0,4/16/2017,"I ordered our food at 1:24 pm, and the restaurant wasn't even crowded.

We looked at the menu and decided to check it out. This location is super clean and new..having only opened a week before. Walking up to the registers I ordered a NYC burger with grilled chicken and a chocolate shake. We quickly got our food but the shakes which are made to order came out a little slower. My friend ordered a nutter butter shake with chocolate and she didn't like how it actually had bits of cookie in it and the people quickly went and made her a new just plain shake. Let me just say the employees are all extremely nice and willing to oblige any request. My burger was delicious the grilled chicken was not dry and overall I had a great experience. I myself did not order my own fries (rosemary garlic and olive oil) but they were sooooooo delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about them. Will I go again? Yes! If I get a chance...,1,,

It wasn't overly greasy, though I just had a burger (no cheese) and the fries oh man the fries! They were crispy and not oily and just yum! I don't expect much from fast food joints so maybe that's why I was so surprised but I have to say it's to Chicago what in n out is to California ...

93,Tyler L.,"New York, NY",357,922,1278,3.0,6/9/2014,"I had never heard of this chain until recently. I tried a Classic Smashburger with some Classic Smashfries. The burger itself was pretty good. They come in regular or large sizes. I opted for large, though it was not overly large. It was very tasty though, and freshly grilled - similar to the burgers at Five Guys. However, the ones at Five Guys are much juicier and tastier than the ones here.Also, I didn't the Smashfries here at all. They are very, very thin, like potato sticks and completely soaked in garlicky oil. I prefer my fries crispier and thicker.",,,
94,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",779,342,81,4.0,8/2/2015,"My gf is a huge food Instagrammer and she recently put up a post of a hamburger from this location and told me I should check it out. I was wandering home when I bumped into it so I decided to check it out.I think I remember a year or two or three ago when they first came into NYC, Yelp had an event where guests got to sample their stuff. Still bitter and sad that I missed it then, I wanted to finally have the opportunity to check them out. Here's what I ordered:- Spicy Jalapeno Burger: the toppings were good, dripping with a dark, rich cheese and abundant guac, which I shamelessly scooped with me fingers so I didn't waste a speck of avocado. Normally I never eat anything spicy, but I felt the jalapenos added a nice crunch and kick to an otherwise bit too thick tasting meal. I didn't find the meat quality mind-blowing or anything - it was a pretty average patty. Very satisfying though.- Smash Fries: OMG these were definitely the stars of the meal. Covered in truffle oil and rosemary, the frites were perfectly seasoned and cooked. The fries are the skinny types that you would see cooked in duck fat and served at fancy French cafes or steakhouses. I ordered the large portion and found myself wishing I had gotten two orders.Price is not too bad, though obviously more than the average fast food chain. However, the wait time from ordering and getting the food was a little too long. There wasn't a hustle in the kitchen even though there were only two or so cooks (the kitchen is open so you could see everything). I got my order to go and ended up waiting longer than I would have liked. Still a great meal overall and will be back to fill my stomach with those fries.",,,1
95,Stephen M.,"North Bend, WA",62,47,0,4.0,6/16/2016,"Good, competent burger and fries. This is a fast-food joint, clean, quick, efficient, friendly. The staff know their stuff and they work *hard* to get your food as quickly as possible and bring it to your table. The hamburger is more than fast-food quality (way above the ""burger royalty"" style), and the fries are shoestring and long. This is a popular site given its location near the ESB, so plan on arriving outside of normal lunch hours, or deal with either eating on the street of trying to find a place in the store. Very, very good.",1,,

Didn't get my food until 1:45 and when asked if anyone knew how long it would take, the guy calling out orders asked my name, and then just ignored me the rest of the time. The cashier was super helpful. Food was good. BUT not only was the service extremely slow, my order was also incorrect. Crispy chicken became grilled chicken. Red onions became grilled onions. One star for an incorrectly-made, decent chicken sandwich. One star for the helpful cashier.",,,
97,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,5.0,3/23/2015,I love Smashburger! I went to a Yelp event a week ago at the financial district and received such great service & FOOD I decided to drop into this one.  The location is huge and has plenty of seating. I visited this location on a Sunday evening and it was not too busy.   The employees are kind and helpful.  Once you place your order food you are provided with a number and your food is brought out to you.  My food was brought out in great  time. I ordered  the Swiss mushroom truffle burger and an order of Smash fries which I had been dreaming about for about a week.  Food was delivered to my table my a friendly employee and my food was hot and looked delicious. The presentation of the food was great and the taste was exactly how I remembered.,2,,
98,Burley T.,"Newark, NJ",20,1,27,2.0,1/20/2017,"Usually the cleanliness and customer service at this location is good. However, tonight I went there about 35 minutes before their closing time. The floors were slightly wet from mopping and there was a sour aroma in the air. The staff member at the cash register was very friendly and assured me that my order would be made-to-order and fresh. I ordered the Avocado Club Grilled Chicken sandwich. I was impressed that my food arrived hot and fresh (or so I thought) in about 10 minutes. Upon further inspection, the chicken was slathered with white sauce (hopefully it was ranch dressing) and the tomatoes were not that ripe. But I was hungry, so I devoured the sloppy sandwich! As I was about to eat my fries, I noticed a piece of curly hair in the sauce on the plate of my chicken sandwich. After seeing it, I immediately lost my appetite for the french fries. When I brought the hair to the attention of one of the staff members, she politely said that she'd tell her manager. So I waited more than 5 minutes for the manager to come over to my table. When I told the manager about the hair in my plate, he questioned me and asked to see my plate. When I told him that I gave it to another staff member, he said ""so how did the hair get there?!"" When I said ""how would I know,"" he acted like I made up the story and did not apologize or offer to give me a refund for the sandwich! When I asked how I could file a complaint, he vaguely said that I could report the problem ""to corporate"" on the company's website. When I told him that I had lost my appetite and did not plan to finish my meal, he hesitated and offered to replace the fries but not to give me a refund of any kind. Needless to say, I was disgusted by the lack of customer service that I received from the store manager. I will strongly reconsider dining at this location of Smash Burger again!",2,,

The french fries are quite good and they have alot of options for you to choose from in how you would like to customize your burger and fries.

Cash register lady acknowledged my existence only after 5 minutes of me standing there. Told me she wasn't ready, I sat down, then told me she was ready. Wonderful.For $13: bacon cheeseburger and butterfinger milkshake. Burger was a little sad looking; something you might see at Wendy's with flattened patty, bun and okay ingredients.

For somewhere so central, it's always very clean and impressively fast service. Lines move quickly (and when they don't, it's not the fault of the staff, it's tourists being slow), your food comes out faster than you'd imagine, and the staff is very quick to clear your tray afterwards. It's almost always easy to find a table even during the lunch rush, and overall I always have a good experience at this location.I'm also a big fan of Smashburger, in terms of quality. For a pseudo-fast food burger, it's much higher quality than almost anywhere else, and they have an impressive amount of options. Smashfries are my absolute FAVORITE, although they are a bit oily, so if you're turned off by that, maybe stay with regular. It is a little pricier than your average fast food, but I think it reflects the higher quality.",1,,

Personally I dont like the fries here (way too thin for me) though I liked how they were crispy.For less than $8.40 for lunch (just the burger), I think its a pretty good deal.

The fries are a perfect size, and that rosemary garlic oil is like heaven (hopefully you won't have to make out with someone after.)Drinks are of the Coca-Cola fountain variety - no Freestyle machine though. That would be a plus. I shall try one of the shakes next time around.The price is around the same as the other burger chains like NY Burger Company, Shake Shack, Five Guys, etc. Not too bad.

126,Ray W.,"Manhattan, NY",87,102,302,3.0,5/30/2014,"If you ask me, I'd recommend coming here solely for the burgers.  The Smash Burger's a winner that's flavorful and juicy and comes with a nice crispy sear to the outside.  And the size and quality of the beef is a good match for the price you'll pay here.  Now on the other hand though, the Smash Fries that come tossed in rosemary leaves, olive and garlic are less than impressive.  I'd rather buy my burger here and go over to Wendy's or McDonald's for my fries.  They would have tasted better if they'd been crispier and hand cut.  And they definitely didn't stand up to the rosemary and oil coating.Service here falls midway between what you'd find at a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant.  You place your order and pay at the counter.  Later it's delivered to your table with a smile.  Napkins, ketchup and the other condiments are on top of every table.  You have to give them credit for the concept.  No waiting around the register for your number to be called like at other fast food burger places. It's a clean, comfortable and spacious place to eat.  The tables are cleared right away whenever a group gets up.  The menu is pretty expansive with about ten different types of burgers you can order, fries, salads, fountain drinks, shakes and beer.  The staff will greet and serve you with a warm smile, and it's worth a visit.",6,2,3

I was contemplating between that and the new yorker, and asked the opinion of the cashier who was very helpful and help me make my choice. I sat down at my table and my burger was brought to me shortly after. The burger of itself was well cooked and all of the condiments were perfect to taste. The atmosphere was that of a little more prestigious fast food joint. It wasn't anything special or somewhere I must go back. It was just good and easy & the price was okay.

129,Chris H.,Hong Kong,173,603,2140,4.0,4/16/2014,"I'm pretty vocal in my outward contempt towards the chainification of New York's restaurant scene. Not because I'm some flag waiving hippy that's rallying against 'the man', but because I work in financial services and firmly believe that chain restaurants must sacrifice their integrity for the sake of profitability and appeasing shareholders. So it came as an utter surprise to me when I tried NYC's first Smashburger - a chain over 250 locations strong - and came away as a changed man.Smashburger aims to please the masses. In addition to a burger and grilled chicken sandwich, on the menu is a veggie burgers, salads, shakes, fries, and onion rings. Burgers can be augmented with an insane combination of ancillaries - toppings (egg, avocado, mushrooms, etc), cheeses, condiments and even buns (brioche, gluten free, multi grain, etc).This review is for the Classic Smash ($5.99), which was served with an unseasonably ripe tomato, crisp lettuce, and a 5.3 ounce beef patty, all sandwiched between a squishy egg bun. On the bun - it was one of the closest approximations of my ideal burger bun (Martin's potato roll), which is easy going both in terms of texture and flavor, and serves as an ideal means to a beefy end. I was charmed by the beef patty. It had been thoughtfully formed so that it barely hung together - unlike many fast food burgers that can become dense and grainy - and gushed rivulets of juice and welcome beefiness on each bite. If I were to nitpick, the meat was on the greasy side, and I wish that I could have ordered it medium rare. But at this price point, it was easily the best burger I've eaten in NYC since my last encounter with Shake Shack.Read the rest on Midtown Lunch: midtownlunch.com/2014/04…",8,4,5
130,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",543,1119,3574,4.0,4/10/2014,"SMASH!! You've finally made it to NYC. Long have I desired you when you were afar in Denver. Then you opened in Long Island, making the road trips easier, but now you are right in the heart of New York City!! It doesn't get better than that. No longer do I have to fly on a plane, or drive a car, now I can just walk to get my Smash cravings!! And free classic Smash burgers ($5.99) on opening day!!I was afraid that the masses would degrade the quality of the burger, but was surprised that even on opening day, Smashburger had everything in order. The line stretched around the corner, but their ample staff handled everything with ease. Three cashiers taking the orders, with approximately 20 staff members stuffed in the kitchen! Yes, as you wait for your food, you can watch them work their magic, shoulder to shoulder, smiles on their faces!! If you decided to dine-in, you'll be handed a placard with a number. Grab a seat, and a waiter will bring your food over to you shortly. My favorite burger is their Truffle Mushroom Swiss ($6.99) but for their opening day event, I got their free classic Smash burger. It was spot on, exactly how I was expecting it as compared to their other locations. The patty was tender and very flavorful. Just thinking of it put me into a dreamy state of mind. The Classic Smash also includes American Cheese, Smash Sauce, ketchup, a piece of lettuce, a tomato slice, pickle slices, and red onions on an egg bun. All ingredients were fresh and complimented one another in harmony making for a very delicious burger. Oh man!! I also ordered a side of their awesome Smashfries ($2.99), tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. Super thin shoestring fries served crispy, then sprazzled and dazzled with all that yummy herbaciousness, making my palate dance and twirl. It was slightly greasy from the norm, but I am sure they will iron out the kinks soon enough. Regardless, it is well worth it.I can't wait to hit up Smashburger again. Thank you for finally making it to New York City. Now, please open up more locations and put Shake Shack to shame. Yes, I do love you Shake Shack, but Smashburger is just so darned good. And for those that have never been to Smashburger: stop looking at Seamless/GrubHub, get off your lazy butt and go now!!!",10,3,4
131,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",289,244,358,4.0,4/12/2014,"I went on opening day when they were giving away free burgers, so my visit shouldn't be a good representation of how the place will operate on a normal day, but I was so pleasantly surprised that I just had to write a review! If what I experienced on their busiest day is any indication, I feel like they're going to do just fine.I don't care how many dirty looks and exclamatory responses we got while waiting in line for nearly an hour - it was a free burger, I can't pass up free food, and I've heard positive things about Smashburger, so grah let me wait in this line!! The lines were out the door and almost wrapped around two corners, but things ran smoothly and lines were managed in an orderly fashion by the staff members. Once inside, things ran even smoother and faster! They even put out free fries for us while we were waiting (""You guys deserve it! Thanks so much for waiting!"" Uhh, thank you so much for giving away free food!!).On opening day, they gave one free Classic Smash to each guest. This burger, normally $5.99, contained (from the bottom) a smashed beef patty, American cheese, pickles, red onions, tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, and ""smash sauce""(a tangy mustard-based sauce). All of this was sandwiched between two pieces of sweet, soft egg buns. The buns were so good (they're specifically made for Smashburger in a Chicago bakery) that I just wanted a whole package of them! They were so pillowy that they never fell apart and held up well to the juices and sauces. The beef was pleasantly juicy, but didn't taste very seasoned which was my only gripe. I wish the smash sauce was closer to the beef patty (like it's actually advertised - see picture); the smash sauce kind of got lost in the vegetables. I also ordered the Smash Fries (toasted with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic) for $2.29. They were very stringy and greasy, but the seasoning was finger-licking good. Since they are so skinny, I'd recommend eating them immediately while they're still hot. Likelihood of another visit:I would have enjoyed the burger even if I did have to pay, so I'll be back. The burgers are all in the $6 to $8 range, and most can be substituted with grilled or crispy chicken. With more creative options than Shake Shack (e.g. Truffle Mushroom Swiss and Spicy Jalapeño Baja), I'd like to return.",5,4,6

This chain is all around the east coast now and i've tried it in New Jersey. The place was clean and there were plenty of seats open. It actually felt kind of like being back in the Garden State now that I think about it.The service was good, the manager even checked up on us while I was still waiting for my food. Maybe I'm a little bit lame for ordering a chicken sandwich at a burger spot, but after a 2 week meat binge in Argentina, you would have done the same thing to.I wasn't impressed at all with the quality of the chicken and the sweet potato fries were average at best. I would return only if I was in the area, starving, and to lazy to use my yelp app to find a different spot.",2,,
133,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401,5.0,7/10/2014,"So I've always loved smashburger because for a chain burger restaurant.. They're really damn good.  Their burgers are huge and not as pricey as say, Unami.  Plus- you rarely ever wait and they also try to add an interesting twist (probably not as much as Unami) to their burgers.The one to always get is the New Yorker (especially if you're in New York y'all, gotta try it!).  The onions and mushrooms.. It all reminds me why I need to petition for a Smashburger to be opened on every block.  Smash fries are cool too- you should try it as they put special spices and stuff on it but sometimes it's just too greasy for me.  If you like that kinda stuff, it's up to you but sometimes it's a bit much for me.  Their shakes are also to die for... They never gyp you either, whatever the put in the tin mixer you get back, if it doesn't all fit in the milkshake glass.Ok- so you get it- the burgers are delicious and so are the fries.  This Smashburger is great because it's in a convenient location but it might be easy to miss.  There are always plenty of tables and the staff is quick and friendly.  They also get your food to you quickly and if you're done they take it away quickly.  I was asked more than once if I was enjoying my meal and certainly I was.So pretty much...

135,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,453,363,4.0,9/20/2014,"Tried smash burger last night for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. They have nutritional information for every single item, down to the condiments, printed on their menu and website. I had the black bean burger in the style of the new yorker (ny cheddar, garlic grilled onions, spinach, tomato and peppercorn garlic aioli) on a gluten free bun (270 calories) along with the veggie frites (fresh green bean and carrot strips, flash fried). Everything was delicious and I really enjoyed the fresh vegetables as fries option.The store itself was clean and spacious, not as trendy and stylish as a shake shack, nor as atmospheric as a bare burger - but it was decent. The servers bring your food to your table and clear your table, and the girl who rang us up was super friendly.",1,,
136,Lisa F.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",163,277,275,3.0,1/14/2016,"I've gotten lunch here about a dozen times.  The food tastes pretty fresh. Im not a huge fan of the fries since i like a little more potato to them than the stringy gangly version that is a signature for Smashburger.Service is mixed. The cashiers seem to always be different and not familiar with taking orders. Today for example when i gave my order, i said, "" i'll have the Cobb Salad with Crispy Chicken"" the cashier says, ""do you want grilled chicken, crispy chicken or just the salad?"" This happens every time I order a sandwich or a salad. I love that you can customize your burgers with tons of options but beware that it usually just confuses and overwhelms the cashier, and some times comes with a side of attitude too! It might have to do with the way the cashier screens are set up since they are probably just following a series of prompts and if you don't do it in that particular order, good luck in getting it the way you want it. Four out of five times something is inaccurate with my order. The manager Clark, has actually reached out to me after I submitted my comments on their website and was very apologetic and sincere about correcting the issues. Inside of the restaurant gets pretty busy during lunch time. They have a couple of 4 seater tabletops in the front and a few seats in the back. When you dine-in, you get a number for your order and the food gets brought to your table.  If you plan on eating at Smashburger more than once, its worth signing up for their emails since you get a FREE milkshake on your birthday as well as coupons for $2 off or free fries every couple of months. On every receipt is the option to complete an online survey and you get a code for a free side. Not bad incentive for answering a few questions.",,,
137,Esther C.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,239,100,2.0,12/24/2014,"I have trouble understanding how this place has 4 stars. I went there for the first time (and last time) today. For the cost, I think I am better off at Shake Shack.I ordered the classic smash burger, smash fries, and a hand spun shake. Let's just say the 2 stars are for the shake. The burger came out very fast, I was actually quite surprised, but the cheese was not even melted on top of the burger. The patty itself was unimpressive. It honestly looked like a thicker version of the McDonald's patty. The burger was falling a part the whole time I ate it, and the bun got soggy from the patty. Definitely disappointed. Fries were smothered in aioli and olive oil which really made the fry really greasy...The shake was good and the staff was nice and that's about it. Would not recommend.",,,
138,Art L.,"New York, NY",66,357,334,4.0,5/30/2014,"I'm usually a bar burger kind of person, so going to a Smashburger was a sort of detour.  Smashburger is located on the south side of 33rd Street opposite the Empire State Building. The dining room is spacious. You order your burger first at the register, which is easy with the large video monitors.  Then, you're given a number tag for your order. If you order a set which includes a drink, you fill it up at a soda machine along the wall. Then you sit down anywhere you want, put up the number tag, and a server brings you your food.Ordering can be simple or complicated. Smashburger offers many different kinds of toppings, but nowadays, choosing from so many choices makes my head hurt, so I chose the Truffle Mushroom Swiss with the Smashfries and drink as a set. The two qualities I like in a burger are all here: juicy loosely packed meat on a super soft bun. I have to say this is one of the best burgers I had in New York City this year. All the elements melted into each other making for a satisfying bite. In fact, I never felt that I was chewing to make the meat mix in with the cheese and mushrooms.  As for the thinly sliced fries, they certainly as good as the burger, laced with rosemary flavor and a crispy texture. Without over-analyzing the merits of burgers from similar restaurants, all I can say is that for a higher-end fast food restaurant, Smashburger delivers on quality. My meal was approximately $10, which is now the standard pricing for these sorts of restaurants. If you come here, it's money well spent.",2,,
139,Eri S.,"Kailua, HI",166,124,948,5.0,9/10/2015,This Smashburger is walking distance (half block) from the Empire State Building.

The lines are quite long but it moves quickly so maybe a 5-8 minute wait for a long line. Not bad :) The interior is very clean and nice. Alot of seats. The service there is great. My friends food came in about 2-4 minutes after she sat. The food. Me and my sister ordered BBQ, bacon and cheddar burgers with a side of smashfries. The total was $18.20.

142,James M.,"Queens, NY",15,23,3,5.0,10/17/2014,"Been here twice now, both were pretty good experiences. This place is conveniently right around the corner from my school, so after class when I'm hungry it's good to know there's a solid burger right there. The burgers are well sized and served on a variety of buns (depends on the burger), with a good set of ingredients. The New York burger in particular was very good, and I liked it much more than the original Smash Burger. The fries are also very good, BUT I would stay away from the Buffalo Fries, as they are WAY too salty and messy. The smashfries are where it's at, as they're tossed in rosemary, olive oil, and garlic. Definitely recommend these. The food comes out fast enough so that if you're in a hurry, you can get it to go, but the service and atmosphere is good enough that you might want to stay. Great place to go if you don't want to be waited on. Expect to spend between 10-12$ for burgers, fries, and drink. Pretty reasonable considering the quality and location. I was between giving this a 4 and a 5 star. It's not the best burger I've ever had, but there was nothing at all negative about the food either, and I feel that the service and cleanliness of the store warrants a perfect score. Five stars.",1,,

Opening day and I got the Classic Smash and since it was my first experience at a Smashburger, I thoroughly enjoyed the bustling atmosphere. The workers were a little over the top with checking on how my friend and I were enjoying our burger or if we needed anything but I guess because they wanted a good review. A+ for effort!The burger was decent but a little too salty in my opinion. It's still a decent quality burger due to the quality of their ingredients although I prefer the ShackBurger from Shake Shack over the Classic Smash. I also ordered the Smash fries which was flavored with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic and it was too thin and stringy. Those potatoes must be really skinny if they're cutting them that thin. I prefer a thicker cut just because if I were to put a sauce on them, I want my fries to hold up and not be soggy. No one wants a soggy fry. That's a sad fry.The sweet potato fries my friend ordered the same problem. Too thin.The place is spacious and open and reminded me a bit of Chipotle in terms of their decor. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing...Overall, it was a good experience for opening day and if I was ever craving a burger, I'd go back and try something else on the menu.",2,1,

If you read my reviews regularly, you definitely know my love for burgers. Have had my share across the country and various places out of the country. From Jackson Hole to 5 Guys to Cheeburger, to In-And-Out, have had my share of some really good burgers...and some really bad ones as well (ahem Tatiana's: Brighton Beach.) but Smashburger is most definitely one of the BEST burgers I've ever had...definitely up there if not I dare say a tad bit better than In-N-Out burger on the west coast and even Cheeseburger Baby in South Beach. Smashburger has a perfect proportioned burger and bun, nicely seasoned fries and decent enough toppings. The prices are fare, just around $11 (if you do not get a drink included) and the service is top notch. Line goes fairly quick and they deliver your order to the table where you're seated. Don't know if you can ask for much more in a burger spot. I am even surprised myself I have not returned here yet since going 3 weeks ago but rest assured I definitely will soon. Maybe I am just leaving myself in anticipation for another great experience at Smashburger because it is that damn good!Applause Smashburger...you have now earned the crown for best burgers (to my liking) in NYC!

148,Timo S.,"Jersey City, NJ",27,75,54,3.0,9/8/2015,"Had to give this place several chances. First visit was foiled by their inability to take orders, both at the register and on their site, but the inconvenience came with some free sides.First, I have to start with the ""smash sauce"" of the Classic Smashburger. I have to start with the smash sauce because that is the first thing you taste, not the burger itself. It's like a honey mustard dressing with a slight relish taste. I'm sure it's going to appeal to many just like the Big Mac sauce does, but it is just a cheap gimmick that does not deserve its own special name.Now to the burger itself. Meh. The burger meat has the appearance of a freshly molded patty in its thin asymmetrical form, but I can't say the flavor of the meat is even up to the standards of a Five Guys. I did like the egg bun. Had the soft spongy build that quickly becomes soggy in oil, but it is indeed different in a good way.Ordered the ""New Yorker"" burger at another visit. Don't know what is so NY about it. Came with a cup of cheap aoli and brioche bun instead. It will garner similar criticisms as above. Good bread, lousy sauce.Now I do have to give high praise to the French fries. Ordered the smash fries with olive oil and rosemary. They're cut thin and drenched in oil so don't expect them to be crisp, but they were incredible. Full of flavor while remaining a French fry rather than a plain herb potato wedge like I was expecting. The fries are the main reason why they climax at 3 stars in this review.Register service was inconsistent.

It's amazing how many ""fast casuals"" don't read their Confucius. So many more restaurants would stay in business if they just upped their sauce game. I ordered truffle mayo with my Smash fries. It was superb. Not trying to be hyperbolic here. Best fries I've had in a long time. FYI I also took down a New York burger. Not trying to brag. Okay I'm trying to brag a little bit. This is also a great hangover spot, as in, if you got smashed the night before, Smashburger the next morning is an excellent choice. It is the Confucian choice. It is the only choice.

It's a pretty good setup since the wall where you stand in line has most of the menu, but these places should figure out a different method for letting people know their order is ready besides screaming everyone's name.I only had a classic burger so I won't compare them to other burger joints yet.

Anyhoo, today was a fucked up day, so once the decision was made that a burger would ease my pain, Yelp found me this spot nearby where my decision was made....The whole angus thing grabbed me & quelled my aversion to pink slime. Their procedure is similar to the new wave of burger joints ...similar to Burger 67, etc...all fine...they bring your order to you when it's ready and are extra chipper & giddy about it all....a tad excessively syrupy, but way better than service with a shit attitude.Down to business : the burger itself wasn't very impressive. It wasn't juicy at all, nor plump, but a flattened, overseasoned ""meatball"" as they describe on their plaque thingees. Similar to Wendy's griddle- style , but as not fatty , nor juicy. Despite the meat never being frozen, it sure is tasteless, despite their attempts to season it back to flavor. I wasn't won-over.Wasn't bad though. The brioche bun, fixings, thin thin ""smash fries"" were pretty tasty. They made the experience better.

159,Maria O.,"New York, NY",0,31,39,1.0,5/31/2015,"Oh, where do I begin... I wanted to love this place, because I love a good burger. Sadly, I was incredibly disappointed. I wanted to try something different from my usual favorite Steak n' Shake, and I had avoided Smashburger for years now. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with extra cheese. They weren't that busy, so I'm not sure why it took so dang long for my food to come out. While I was waiting, there was this loud alarm going off within the restaurant, a very high pitched ringing that was killing everyone's ears, but apparently the employees didn't think it was important to address it. Yes customers can be disgusting, but employees are being paid to clean up after them, but not at this Smashburger. A lot of the ""empty"" tables were covered in leftover food. And from the moment I walked in, ate, and then left, the same tables were never cleared or cleaned.Now on to the food, unfortunately. Apparently this place likes to serve their burgers in an open face style, which I didn't see as a problem until I got my food. I first noticed that the extra piece of cheese I ordered wasn't even melted. I put the bun on and grab the burger and it's nowhere near hot, it's barely even warm. And of course, leaving the bun off allows the heat to escape much faster. Seriously, what a dumb idea, they really need to stop it or get the food to the customer faster. Upon tasting my cool burger, it was so boring. There was nothing special that stood out. The beef was flavorless, as was the cheese, and the bacon just tasted like some average bacon you'd buy at the grocery store. And the bun... good grief, it's so dense and heavy that it felt like a rock in my stomach and made me feel overly full. I and everyone else I know could make the same burger at home, and it would have more flavor than that crap. The fries again were average, and a smaller portion than it looks in the photos... YAWN...Certainly skip over Smashburger, you'll fall asleep from boredom trying to swallow that cold, flavorless, mediocre thing they call a burger. Shame.",1,,
160,Yecca Z.,"Manhattan, NY",80,72,110,4.0,5/4/2014,"Having savored the juicy well-seasoned patties at Shake Shack and Umami, I must confess that the actual meat patty at Smash was nothing special. However, I applaud their highly-customizable menu that actually offers tasty combos with healthy ingredients that other burger joints shy away from (ach hem, 'shroom burger). Not to mention that they also offer grilled chicken sandwich combos, salads, shakes and veggie burgers. I got the spicy jalapeno burger w/ guacamole, pepper jack, and chipotle mayo. It was alright with the burger, but when I got the same combo with grilled chicken another time it was infinitely better. My boyfriend had the spinach, cucumber and goat cheese burger w/ balsamic vinaigrette which was also tasty. We shared the rosemary olive oil fries- way too greasy and skinny so basically just oil in my mouth and the sweet potato fries- perfect! highly recommend. All in all impressed by the efficiency and vibe of this fast casual joint. The servers and bussers also do seem genuinely kind with great service. When I came around 9pm I remember Kayla as being especially pleasant!",,,

I ordered the spicy jalepeno baja which is fantastic and designed to perfection. Get the Smashfries along with it. Not too fond of the small skinny cut fries but the taste makes up for it.It's simliar to Shake Shack ""gourmet"" burger style but they bring the food to you. Plus, the burger will be presented to you opened out - which makes it easier for you to put the desired condiments. Guys, let's be real - we can't be lazier than this. If you plan to sit in, they will give you a number and you just sit wherever you want. There's no ridiculous one hour long wait for a freakin' burger. Yes, I'm talking to you Shake Shack.",2,1,1

It was a good burger, like Wendy's good (not a knock). I compare it to Wendy's because the patty was on the salty side, which i personally like but having said that, it also means that smash burger doesn't stand out on taste. I had the smashburger with their special sauce, which didn't really stand out for me. I also had their fries which were uneventful but did their job of being a fried spud.All in all it's a burger joint, clean, spacious, a different vibe than the fast food places so why not when in a pinch and you don't want to sit with a  McDonalds, BK or Wendy's crowd.",1,,

Suffering from serious ""I'm not eating ever again"" issues lately and much more. I didn't know whether to be more concerned about the staff not being attentive to the food before they serve it because the roach is literally cooked into the pickle or because the Health Dept. graded this place with an A.

My friend ordered a classic chicken sandwich with regular fries and he was barely able to finish it because he was so full. He said it was really good. It was so good I went today to try out the chicken sandwich and fried pickles. I also got a free smash fries because I brought back the receipt after taking the survey. Fast Service, Friendly Staff, Good Quality Food, Great Price (cheaper then shake shack and taste better.) I will be coming back some day next week and the week after that and the week after that.",,,

They have a coupe beers on draft which is nice.You order at the register and they give you a number and bring your order to you at your table. Consistent service and consistent burgers. The fries come out to be a pretty large order so if you're eating lunch with a buddy you could totally share. Unless, you're not into the whole sharing thing.

173,Denisa R.,"New York, NY",969,596,357,4.0,10/16/2014,"I must be one of the few people who has yet to try Smashburger... that is... until now. FYI - I had a pretty bomb a** burger a few minutes ago so naturally I want to write down all my thoughts on Yelp.I was in the mood for a burger today, but like a really good burger and not a crappy Mickey D's or fast food chain one. My options were limited since it seems everything I usually go for is located on the west side. After a little searching on Seamless & Yelp I came upon Smashburger.*cue the heavens opening up*The first sign that I was meant to have a burger today was the lack of a line at Smashburger. I've read a couple of reviews commenting on the long lines, but as soon as I stepped into the place there were about 3 people ahead of me. As they ordered, I took my time and looked over the menu, finally deciding on:- spicy jalapeño baja (substituted the spicy chipotle bun for a multi-grain bun): I decided to get the regular burger which is 5 oz of beef versus the ""big"" burger at a whopping 7 oz. This burger brings lettuce, tomatoes, fresh jalapeños, ketchup, guacamole, and red onions (raw). I decided to add some spicy chipotle sauce for an extra kick. - smashfries: These are their signature fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. The best way to describe these fries are pretty well seasoned and a bit on the skinny side. If you're picturing a big fat crinkle fry... you've pictured the wrong fry my friend.Overall, my meal, which consisted of a burger and fries, was decently priced for midtown at about $10. I would go back here for a fresh burger, fries, and maybe try one of their shakes next time.",3,1,1

177,William F.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,4,0,3.0,12/31/2016,"Came here  on new year's eve with a BOGO Entree coupon on my phone which they said they will accept the this time but had to be printed in the next time. Ordered the Chicken Avocado club burger with Smash Fries, but the cashier forgot to ring up the free entree. She asks another co worker (assuming it's her supervisor)to ring it up. The supervisor was rude and had an attitude. He repeated that the coupon had to be printed, then later said the order was already processed in the computer and that he cannot change it. He told me to use the coupon next time unapologetically. After a few moments he finally agreed to give me the extra burger (which he should've done in the first place because it was fault at their end). When my order was ready, he walked up to me and dropped two bags in front of me without saying anything and walked away as he continued yelling at apologetic cashier that initially took care of me. The burgers were delicious and fresh. However one of the avocado burgers was smaller than the other(1/2 the size of the patty of the other), assuming it is the free one. I am not sure what size they normally are. The smash fries was very greasy, it was see through as though it was soaked in oil.Would have been a good first time experience trying Smash Burger out if it wasn't for that rude supervisor.",1,,

We both ordered a buger and fries and a milkshake each. It was great! I loved everything about it, the line was short, it was clean and everything  just seemed ""right"". 2nd visit: Of course I was excited about getting lunch here again because everything went so flawlessly the first time. And then it happened: I found a strand of hair in my fries..... A HAIR.... ughhghg. After telling management,  I did receive a voucher I could use on the next visit, got the fries for free... but still.

I understand its a glitch but the staff handled it poorly. No manager on sight, cashier was looking helpless. We ordered after 20 mins and sat down to get our food. The place was filthy with garbage on the floor.. walls need a good cleaning and so does the restroom. Gross!Our food took a while to come out, I think mainly because the couple of friends of the ""employees"" showed up, although they were 2 people behind us they received their food way before us...Once we received out food.. it just added to our negative experience.

I was really excited when it opened by my work. I'd been to one before and remembered thinking good thoughts about it but now I remember that my first impression was kinda the same as it is now - The place looks nice and much more upscale than the usual fast food suspects. The food is presented beautifully - it LOOKS soooo tasty! And the real thing looks just as good as the menu glamour shots! It's even a pretty good value - maybe  a couple bucks more than McDonalds, but the burgers are much more substantial, have fresher ingredients, and actually fill you up..... yeah, I mean I don't know how to say it any way other than this place looks and feels like it should just be kicking the ass of your average fast food burger place like McD's...Unfortunately, everytime I go there I feel disappointed. The burgers just aren't flavorful to me. I even tried changing it up to the crispy chicken sandwich because who doesn't love crispy chicken? You can't go wrong....And I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'd way rather have Crispy chicken from Wendy's in terms of flavor.Overall, I just have to say way overrated.

I had an original without pickles and an order of fries. It seems like a higher end steak n shake to me. The burger was a little bit salty but overall I liked it. The bun was very good and had a nice egg flavor but seemed to be contributing quite a bit to the saltiness. The fries were thin and cooked decently and the portion was adequate.
