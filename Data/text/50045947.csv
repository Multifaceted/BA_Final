0,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,351,290,4.0,10/26/2018,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I had been expecting it to be more paleo body building type of health food without much flavor, but the food was more developed and gourmet that I was expecting.  It tastes like what you would expect a really fit friend also happens to be a great cook would make for you in their kitchen.  Everything just tastes really homemade.  The main dish portions are also filling and satisfying.  For some reason, the pictures make the dishes seem small but they are actually quite big.  I had the grandma's chicken and rice which was delicious and I am curious to try the other main dishes now as well.  I also separately got the chicken broth which was much smaller than I was expecting.  It is in a cup about 1/2 the size of a regular coffee cup though you do have the option to purchase one of the larger sizes.  The broth itself is rich and without that many additives or other ingredients added to it.  It felt gut and joint healing.  My dog enjoyed some of it on her kibble as well.  :)I'm really glad to have discovered this place.  I'm not paleo but I do eat healthy and try to be gluten and dairy free.  I like how this place cares about how they source their ingredients and just use free range meats and sustainably caught fish.",,,
1,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,3.0,10/30/2018,"Broth - that is what you get here. Especially if you've made some questionable decisions about food and drink before coming to Springbone. For those who prefer to chew their food, like me, there is an extended menu with other options. Pretty pricey food on that menu, but hey, it's sourced locally and the ingredients just taste so CLEAN. Feed me all the paleo food you got and I am a happy girl. I got the beef chilli bowl, which had a lot of quinoa and a decent amount of ground up beef. It was really tasty; the sweet potato complemented the ingredients so well. But the portions you get here are disappointing for the price, so keep that in mind when coming here.  Tried the Mexican Bowl, and that was great. Tons of black beans, rice, and guac. The broth it comes with (on the side in a sample cup) was delicious! Now that I trust these people, I know I'm coming back for that! They were sadly out of the mushroom tea, so I got a plain herbal tea. It was alright, pretty simple, tasted like hot water. Love that they're open relatively late for the area and that their staff is pretty friendly. Their lack of space and a bathroom are whack, so just keep those in mind before stopping in. There's just a counter space and a picnic table, with there being seats for about 7-8 people. It's tight so don't come here for intimate conversations. Keep it casual, NYU students!Suggestion: add calorie and protein counts to your menus. You'll attract so many more diners!",3,1,3
2,Ariel M. W.,"New York, NY",225,84,1,4.0,10/8/2018,"Love the broth!  Highly recommend the bone broth.  Entrees are not always to my liking.Cute fast casual place near Washington Square Park and West 4th Street.  Cafe vibe inside with some seating.  The staff is friendly.  Cashless, no bathroom.  Wholesome food, sourced ethically, priced relative for the neighborhood.I've had the chicken bone broth, sampled the beef broth as well as enjoyed grandma's chicken, the beef chili and the beef Bolognese.  The food is balanced with vegetables and quite filling.  I found the Bolognese to be quite runny and the chicken in the grandma's chicken rice bowl to be dry.  Often times the Brussel sprouts aren't cooked long enough.",,,
3,Michelle H.,"Manhattan, NY",145,40,52,4.0,11/12/2018,"Love their broth, glad something like this finally opened up. I always drink broth at home as a pick me up when I'm hungry or feeling under the weather so having this is ultra convenient for NYU students. I got some food for the first time, I'd rate that alone 3 stars but considering it's freshness, locally sourced ingredients, & the 5star broth I opted for a 4 star. The spaghetti bolognese was a little bland & they didn't drain the zucchini enough so it was a bit of a watery mess, maybe better to eat in store and not to-go. I also got the side of sweet potato which was good but tiny for $5.Highly recommend this place for broth, coffee or other healthy snacks. I appreciate the effort to make healthy food so will try it again.",,,
4,Milan M.,"Jersey City, NJ",24,68,195,5.0,10/14/2018,"Love this little place! They take the time to perfect healthy dishes that would take hours to make at home. I ordered the burger with gluten free bread and my friend ordered the salmon bowl and we shared. The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked. The salmon was pan seared and served with its crispy skin. The bowl had a well balanced Mediterranean flavor with a tomato paste, quinoa, olives and kale. Will def be back soon!",,,
5,Chelsea W.,"San Francisco, CA",473,442,1760,4.0,7/15/2018,"Healthy shop near Washington Square Park that sells chicken/beef/veggie broth and wholesome bowls. They boast using minimal grain and sugar, more vegetables, better meat, no GMOs, antibiotics, refined sugar or canola oil.They have several variations of chicken/beef broth, such as Immunity Broth, Chicken Zoodle Soup, Umami Broth, Kimchi Broth, etc. Some of their Lunch/Dinner menu items include Bolognese zoodles, rice bowls, 100% grass-fed burgers, etc. Grandma's Chicken & Rice ($11.50) - Organic wild rice, free-range chicken, roasted carrots, brussels sprouts, organic braised kale, citrus-beet puree, Tango Chile sauce and side of chicken bone broth. I subbed the wild rice with their turmeric cauliflower rice for $1. The portions were a bit small given the price. The broth on the other hand, was average.The seating here is quite limited, as there's only a communal table and 4 window bar seats. It's great for people doing the Whole30 diet.",1,,
6,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,165,5.0,9/12/2018,"It makes me very happy to see Paleo/clean cooking places in the city.Personally I can't stomach bone broth, but I have had many friends and family members who have seen great success with it. It basically saves lives! This place does not disappoint in their selection of bone broth.  If you can stomach it, go here and you won't be disappointed!They also don't use canola oil which is great. Canola oil is a huge no-no on anyone's list who is eating clean, keto, etc. So always a positive! I had a simple breakfast (eggs & bacon) when I came with my friend on a Saturday morning and she had the caesar salad and both were amazing! They have a cute little section where you can buy ghee butter, dark chocolates, etc. The staff is friendly and helpful. I feel like I will be visiting shortly!",1,1,2
7,Carol B.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",389,822,141,5.0,8/11/2018,"Springbone Kitchen's zoodles with meat sauce is delicious! A very filling and satisfying meal. I couldn't even finish it. Loved that it was served with a tiny side of the beef broth. This broth is rich and velvety. I bought a frozen tub of the chicken broth to-go, but I was disappointed when I reheated it at home. It had a very weird taste and I couldn't even finish it. I'll stick with the beef flavor next time! That one's available in a frozen to-go variety, as well.The beef broth here is on par with Brodo, but for a much more affordable price.",2,,1
8,L S.,"Nanuet, NY",3,47,15,3.0,11/10/2018,"I love this place and their broths!! I just want to warn you about one thing-do not have it delivered through postmates!! As you can see from the pictures, it leaked and it took quick thinking to salvage some it. The restaurant does Saran Wrap it but when the cup itself is broken, there's only so much Saran Wrap can do. The broth is truly worth the money provided it's not spilling all over the place.",,,
9,Caitlyn C.,"New York, NY",298,197,317,4.0,4/28/2018,"Springbone kitchen is a cool, super healthy spot near NYU. Some things I really love about it--1)Sells so many of my favorite products, collagen, bars, ghee, coconut cult, dairy free ice cream and more!2) They have a wide range of broths, breakfast, lunch and dinner options. 3) They accommodate all food allergies and preferences. Things that have made my experience less than 1001) It's quite small in here. The staff does an amazing job of serving quickly but it can easily feel super super crowded in here. 2) The last two times I was in here the meals I've gotten have been a strange mix of hot and cold. Rachel's lamb and tabouleh has hot meatballs and cold tabouleh underneath. I guess that's expected but I found it hard to eat. I think I would have preferred everything to be either hot or cold. The other dish this happened with was the burger. The burger was hot but the caramelized mushrooms on top were cold somehow which again threw me off. The meat in both of these dishes was cooked superbly and the flavors all over were unreal but the hot/cold is strange to me. Still highly recommend this spot, especially for any of the broths!",2,,
10,Yasir A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",156,57,79,3.0,3/25/2018,"I came here for the vegan chocolate ice-cream. It was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. The ice cream wasn't as sweet as I wanted it to be. It was sort of bland.Probably won't come here again. The spot is a nice cafe but not really into the taste. Wish I was!",1,,1
11,Beril E.,"New York, NY",155,99,457,2.0,2/4/2018,"This review comes from someone who doesn't really understand the paleo or keto diets. So I probably was not the target audience of their meals.I came inside Springbone Kitchen, not for the healthy alternatives to the most commonly eaten foods, but because I liked the way the place looked from the outside.We gave our order to an absent-minded guy who only after ordering remembered that they were out of Spaghetti and Meatballs. After another failed attempt at ordering Grandma's chicken and rice (turns out they run out of dishes a lot), we finally settled on the Mexican bowl.The Mexican bowl came with the blandest chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. I get that the chicken is free-range, but it would have continued to be free-range if only they have seasoned it. The wild rice tasted like they scraped the bottom of the pot and scooped the burnt ends (maybe they were running out of wild rice too?) to reach that concoction of hard rice with no flavor whatsoever. The beans were not seasoned (surprise!) and although they did a good job with the guac (don't know how you'd mess up guac anyway), there was just not enough of it to salvage that dish.",3,3,
12,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",269,182,363,4.0,6/7/2018,Cute small shop - common table (seats up to 8) and bar table seating (4 stools) by window. Will be back to try the highlighted bone broths but this time I just got their spaghetti and meatballs (off lunch and dinner menu) to go. Pretty filling and very tasty!,1,,1
13,Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",495,794,740,4.0,5/7/2018,"A new whole30 junkie this place is fantastic! Love love love! So glad I can get a flavorful meal with no fuss, just good clean eating!

Updated review","Though the food is great I have to update my review. The portion size have become smaller for the same HIGH price. They also never give you utensils so always check. --- Everything's delicious!First of all, the broths are legit. Those are amazing rich bone broths that will be you feel better instantly. The zucchini spaghetti with meatballs is my favorite dish. It comes with beef broth and its satisfying yet not heavy. Highly recommended! I also love the burrito bowl which come with chicken and chicken broth. This is by far the best burrito bowl ive ever had - the beans, the wild rice, the chicken, the salsa, the guacamole- everything is high quality and absolutely delicious.  Highly recommended!",2,1,1
15,Rachel V.,"New York, NY",3,44,2,5.0,10/28/2018,Reasonable prices with high quality and interesting food. The broth is delicious. The main meals are brimming with nutrition.,,,
16,Kristina Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",217,2,2,1.0,10/21/2018,"I've been going to springbone for almost year now, but today was the first time I ordered food. I usually go for their immunity broth but I decided to try their lunch today - Grandma's chicken. I found 2 piece of plastic mixed into my chicken. Of course, there might have been more plastics hidden in but I had definitely lost my appetite and stopped eating after chewing on the second piece of plastic. $11.50 for lunch isn't exactly unaffordable but the way the restaurant advertising itself - healthy, non-GMO, etc, they should at least make customers feel save about eating their food. Very disappointed and will never order or eat here again.",,,
17,Allie B.,"New York, NY",303,224,205,4.0,3/27/2018,"I really love the idea of Springbone Kitchen - serving wholesome meals that are high quality and good for you. I ordered the chicken zoodle soup with an added egg and a side of brussel sprouts. Known for their broths, I have to say as I was sipping it on the train the flavor came through and it was instantly soothing ! They give a huge portion of chicken, but I thought they could have put less chicken and more zoodles because the ratio seemed off. The brussel sprouts were good but I thought they could have used some more flavor. I would definitely try the broth again but maybe with a different combination and some of their other popular dishes !",1,,2
18,Adam W.,"Stamford, CT",0,11,5,4.0,4/17/2018,"Big fan!  I got the Mexican bowl which, as you'd guess, has the delicious combination of organic wild rice, black beans, free-range chicken, guacamole, pico de gallo, salsa verde and side of chicken bone broth.  Hot, tasty, and a VERY big serving.Only downside is the limited seating if you want to dine in.  There were a few impatient, hungry NYU girls who were aggressively trying to get into each of the 12 seats (1 communal table plus 4 window facing seats) when one would become available.  I know you have to be assertive in NYC, but I was not about to try to take a seat that was opening up as these girls were very obvious about their plan.  Kudos to them.  My belly is still full!",,,1
19,Lynn L.,"Manhattan, NY",82,150,75,5.0,3/25/2018,"Came here for dinner while we were on the Whole30. I got the large chicken broth and a burger. The broth was delicious. Full of flavor, served piping hot, drinking it made you feel so loved, hugged and nurtured! The burger with portobello mushroom as bun was grilled perfectly, loved that fresh grilled flavor! SO SO good! Met one of the owners there, surprised he spoke Mandarin!! Keep up the excellent work, next location: East Harlem! DO IT!",,,1
20,Melody L.,"Washington, DC",11,180,382,4.0,7/25/2018,"The specialty here is the bone broths, but there are plenty of other clean options at this health food spot. I had the ""spaghetti"" bolognese made with zucchini noodles and was very pleasantly surprised. I think I may have even enjoyed the zoodles more than I would actual pasta! The whole dish was so comforting: I could definitely see myself eating this on a cold day. The spaghetti came with a side of beef bone broth that just wasn't my cup of tea. Sorry Springbone, I don't think I'll be hopping on the broth train anytime soon... but the zoodles were great!",,,
21,Pam W.,"Queens, NY",270,39,9,5.0,12/21/2017,"As somebody has mentioned in a review before, Springbone Kitchen fills a niche appealing to the low-carb/ketogenic/paleo crowd. Their menu is focused around their bone broth with options to add healthy, grass-fed fats to the mix. I was really excited to hear about this place when it first opened because I've never seen a place offer something similar.While I am accustomed to adding grass-fed butter to my coffee and food, I have found that adding it to everything was not particularly appealing to most people. I appreciate that the spaghetti in their ""spaghetti"" and meatballs has been replaced with zucchini noodles (zoodles). While NYC is a utopia of endless food options, there aren't actually many places that offer much else outside of salad and/or other modified menu items if you're trying to have something low-carb.I love having a hot cup of bone broth during the colder, winter months. It's a comforting alternative to other sweetened, cafe beverages and excellent to grab on the go.During my last visit, the place had to shut down earlier than expected because of kitchen issues, and my food had still not come out yet. The staff apologized and offered me a free refill on my bone broth as an act of goodwill. Although I didn't get a chance to sit down and enjoy my food right away, I gladly accepted and went on my way with broth in hand.",4,,
22,Melissa R.,"St. Petersburg, FL",364,121,69,5.0,12/27/2017,"Restaurants like Springbone are one of the reasons I miss living in NY! It is so hard to find quality food that is not only gluten-free, but also paleo and Keto friendly! I moved to FL several years ago and it is so challenging to eat out and find quality ingredients. We shared a chicken zoodle bone broth, ""spaghetti"" and meatballs and a grass fed burger with carrot fried. Everything was spectacular! I can't wait to come up in the summer and try the ice cream that everyone raves about! This spot is definitely one to check out!",2,,
23,J. M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,2.0,8/31/2018,"Pros: 1) fast and easy takeout, 2) the chicken zoodle soup is delicious, 3) a good selection of serious healthy menus to choose from.Cons: 1) often you receive only 60-70% of the full portion, making your food even more outrageously overpriced than they already are, even by Greenwich Village standards, 2) service could be friendlier, 3) sometimes they forget to give you the little broth in a cup when you take out.",2,,
24,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,2.0,11/21/2017,"Healthy food does not have to be bland, but every time I eat food from a ""healthy"" place they seem to omit necessary seasoning. Even a fresh off the farm truly organic chicken needs some salt and pepper. I got the Mexican bowl, described thus: ""Organic wild rice, black beans, organic chicken, a trio of housemade Mexican toppings -- pico de gallo, salsa verde, and guacamole (not extra!) -- and a shot of chicken bone broth"" Man, don't try to win me over from Chipotle by making that ""no extra for guac"" quip. That chain may have fallen out of favor but what got them popular was bold flavor, that's not here. The chicken really needs to be seasoned. There's no sauce on the meat so it's dry rice and beans and chicken, with a smattering of salsa and guac. It doesn't come together, and I was really NOT a fan of the rice in particular. The carrot ""fries"" are just grilled carrots cut into a fry shape. The chili and ""zoodiles"" (zucchini noodles, if you want to sound post-pubescent when ordering) were options that tasted closer to normal food. Clearly not for me but the ratings are great so hey, take this as a review from a person who still won't touch quinoa or kale.",4,3,1
25,Brad R.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",234,8,1,3.0,9/7/2018,"GREAT FOOD! MOSTLY Great staff, but the few with the attitude really ruin it. Also once an employee turned my salmon bowl to the side to get it in the bag and all of the sauce was on the cover! Sheesh. Attitudes prob come from the iffy management.

27,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,4/24/2018,"A long-awaited trip to Springbone Kitchen paid off in the most uplifting of ways. I bookmarked Springbone as soon as I read about its opening a couple of years ago--I'm the demo for healthy fast-casual and I'm always looking for new concepts. Don't get me wrong, I love Sweetgreen and Mulberry & Vine, but there's always more innovation to be explored. I didn't initially rush to Springbone because 1) I don't live in the area and 2) bone broth hadn't quite yet made it into the mainstream of fit-foodie-wellness-trendy-ingredients-you-can-read/see/taste-culture. So I didn't know about its remarkable health benefits, and I didn't know how satisfying a food it was. Having visited Springbone now, I can report first-hand that the mission here is palpable and genuine. The entire menu and all other items served here were chosen with the utmost care, the priority being health above all else. This is the *only* eatery I've found (this is a big statement) at which I can trust that absolutely everything served here--even the ""heartier"" entrees, are going to contribute to my wellbeing. And if you were worried about taste, I promise that is not sacrificed here.Springbone is located in the heart of NYU territory, which is perhaps the best place for it. It's quick and pretty ideal if you don't want to hate yourself after eating fast-casual. The space itself is small--probably only 12-14 seats, but still fairly pleasant to dine-in. Along the wall when you walk in are featured products, a collection curated to match the founders' vision. It features a hot sauce made with apple cider vinegar, which is the only kind of hot sauce I can eat due to dietary restrictions. Because of said restrictions, I end up needing to avoid a lot of mainstream snacks and condiments, which makes it hard when I also value tasty food. But Springbone is truly magical, because every product on that wall is within my prescribed diet: no added sugar, no dairy, no gluten, no soy. Like I said, I'm the target demo. The menu here is divided between bone broth for drinking (served in coffee cups, though you can add protein and extra fixin's, too) and more traditional lunch/dinner items. They also serve breakfast all day, which is a plus. Broth-wise, Broth-wise, you can choose from the chicken options, beef options or the vegan broth of the day. I ended up trying a few, and you really can't go wrong. They're delicious and satisfying and make you feel cozy inside. I ended up going with the Immunity Broth(classic chicken broth, ginger, garlic, vitamin C), to which I added turmeric and zoodles. Though a small cup already has 10g of protein, you have the option of adding in chicken or beef meatballs if you'd like. Regardless of what you order, the entire menu is GLUTEN-FREE. It's such a relief to not have to obsessively parse through the menu here. So though the friend I was with does fine with gluten, I got to try her dish as well. She got the""Spaghetti"" & Meatballs (zoodles with grain-free 100% grass-fed beef meatballs (contains dairy), tomato sauce, organic parmesan and a side of beef bone broth) which were delicious and also surprisingly filling (the use of collagen here probably accounts for part of this). We were finishing up around closing time when a guy and his friend sat down next to use with little samples of chicken wings. We had been ogling everyone's dishes all night because it all looked so dang good, and this was probably the most conspicuous of our glances. It turned out that this guy was one of the two founders, Sam, and he was trying out some potential new menu items. Being the health freak and overall information addict that I am, I shared way too many things with him about my digestive woes and asked him lots and lots of questions about all aspects of the business. He was super friendly and ended up offering us some broth for the road after we wrapped up talking. I got to try theLiquid Gold (classic chicken broth, organic coconut milk & turmeric) which is just all kinds of perfection and happy, and a little samples of the Seaweed & Mushroom Broth (daily vegan broth). The latter was very heavy on the seaweed and not as filling as the chicken/beef options, but I happen to love seaweed and enjoyed the broth very much. We left on a high--satisfied, content and hopeful. Neither of us had been to Springbone before, and now we must set out on convincing all of our friends to come with us. I know startups/new companies are all about the ""mission"" and their ""purpose"" and ""making a difference"" but this felt true and genuine here. The concept is as well-thought-out as I've seen, everything is delicious, and the generosity of the folks who run it is a fabulous bonus.",6,2,5
28,Eunice D.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,20,9,5.0,8/31/2018,"The broths at Springbone are incredibly rich and umami. I had a large cup while recovering from a cold and it gave me a noticeable energy boost.

I never took biology...)Aaaaaanyway, the Classic Chicken and Beef broths will get you hot and bothered--in every sense of the word.

It's not the most vegetarian friendly, could use a few more non meat options. For the meat eaters, the beef is grass fed and the chicken is free range. Service is very good here. We've both dined in and ordered delivery. A couple of times we had a mistake with our delivery order, but they have always been very nice and quick to solve any issues. The paleo bun that they use is the bun by Know Foods.

I have been eating gluten-free and sometimes vegan for a little while now and love trying new gluten-free friendly places. But that doesn't mean I enjoy unseasoned food. 4 letters - SALT or you know, anything on a spice rack would help. So I decided to try the grass-fed burger on gluten free bun with guacamole and a side of roasted sweet potatoes. The potatoes were tough and flavorless. The burger exceedingly bland. Thank god for the guacamole or else nothing would have been really edible. Perhaps other things on the menu are where they shine, but just skip the burger and the sweet potatoes, oh and the carrot fries since their fryer is broken, and the smoothies cause their blender is broken....meh",,2,1

While this doesn't add to the quality of the food it adds to the quality of the experience in dining. 2nd- the food is great. Not only is the broth hearty and delicious the food is reminiscent of a home cooked meal that I miss so dearly. The chicken and rice, disclaimer: wild rice, is packed full of vegetables and delicious eats. Highly recommend. But my favorite thing here and maybe overpriced but for me worth it- is the eggs.

34,Anil C.,"New York, NY",609,43,166,4.0,11/8/2017,"I was drawn into Springbone by the allure of a nice hot cup of chicken bone broth on a cold November day. The restaurant is located right off of NYU campus and past Washington Square Park, so there is definitely competition for solid lunch joints along the way. Springbone definitely provides a hearty, healthy, and tasty meal, but I'd be remiss if I didn't critique a couple of things:Firstly, the place was pretty packed. Going in at 1:30PM on a Wednesday, I was surprised to see all of the tables were filled up, many of them with people doing work on their laptops. I personally feel that there are a lot of coffee shops and other places to post up with a book or laptop, but given how small Springbone is, I would have loved to have the opportunity to sit down and enjoy my meal.Secondly, the price. I understand the competitive pricing model ($11/12 for a bowl, $5/7 for a small/medium bone broth), but the portion sizing of the bowl left much to be desired. Comparing to other fast casual restaurants, I would price the quantity I received at around $9/10. This isn't a huge deal, but definitely something to consider if you're looking for a filling meal.Lastly, the food; I absolutely loved the bowl! I got the Grandma's chicken and rice which was flavored perfectly and had a great number of consistencies to constantly keep the dish interesting. I particularly enjoyed the brussel sprouts and drizzling the chicken bone broth on top. FYI - they do give you utensils and napkins now. What left me underwhelmed was the plain chicken bone broth. I have had Brodo before and really preferred that to this broth - it tasted a lot more full and flavorful. If I'd recommend anything to you before going to Springbone, it would be to get the chicken broth with a splash of chili oil or some other flavor to round out the taste.All in all, I had a great experience here and would definitely come back again. Removed one star for the aforementioned but all in all liked this spot and am excited to try more options here!",,,
35,Nat S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,70,19,4.0,4/24/2018,"It's not an actual Kitchen, if you were wondering. I ordered their ""Grandma's Chicken and Rice,"" probably not made by an actual grandma either. Food is great though and pretty healthy by restaurant standards. They have a whole smoothie menu but only have ONE blender in the kitchen. Which is really stupid. I know this because it once broke down, simultaneously breaking my heart. All in all a good restaurant with great staff.",,,
36,Karen C.,"New York, NY",224,65,317,4.0,2/13/2017,"I got the Mexican bowl and besides everything but the beans being too salty (including the wild rice), it was good! The chicken was super tender and flavorful and I loved the little shot of chicken broth the plate came with. If they just reduce the salt by a lot, the bowl would have been perfect. If anything, they should let customers adjust the saltiness to their own taste by having salt on the table instead of pre-seasoning the bowls so much. Springbone, if you're reading this, you're doing pretty good but please take all the reviewers' suggestions!!!A lot of other reviewers complained about the portion size but I think the Mexican bowl is pretty large (maybe especially if you have it to stay), I had to take about a third that was leftover to go.Will be back to try their other things!",2,1,2
37,M S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,16,0,5.0,7/22/2018,Love this place.  Really high quality ingredients; a big step up from a lot of the fake healthy places in the city like Dig Inn.  I get broth here 3 or 4 times per week in the winter and fall (Immunity Broth and Kimchi Broth are my favorites) and have been going here for lunch in the summer.  For lunch I usually go with the Mexican bowl (substitute sweet potatoes for rice) with extra guacamole.  It is a lot of food and really high quality.  I hope they open up more locations so that I can eat here more often.,1,,

39,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,4.0,7/18/2017,"Great options for those trying to eat healthy, paleo, dairy-free or gluten free.WAIT: Came on a Tuesday night at 6:30pm and while there were people inside it wasn't super packed.  Towards 7:30-8 it definitely got more crowded.  It seemed like a lot of people took to go or only got a smoothie or soft serve so they didn't have to sit down.ATMOSPHERE: It's fairly small inside.  There is a communal like lower table with people sitting on both ends and then a counter area.  It could probably fit 20 or so people altogether.  You order at the front and then they call your order out.  It took about 7 minutes or so for my food to come out.FOOD: I wanted to try the broth. If you read their website they say that broth is actually healthier than those people who go on juice diets.  It makes sense since juice is a lot of carbs from the fruit but here it is from meat and feels heavier/more filling.  CHICKEN ZOODLE SOUP - I got the large, which comes in a large coffee cup with the chicken and zucchini noodles inside.  It was my first time having broth and it basically tasted like homemade chicken soup.  The flavor was very good, natural, not too salty, slightly herbal-y and overall ""healthy.""  There was some oil/fat in it though but it didn't taste overwhelming.  The chicken wasn't bad, maybe a little dry at times but what can you do with chicken breast.  The zucchini noodles were very thin and good.  Overall, quite impressed.The rest of the food looked good with lots of options although beware that the portions are on the smaller side.  Prices are bad, but you'd not get a ton of food.Overall, I would definitely be back to try the other items on their menu as well as the vegan soft serve!",3,2,2
40,Nikki M.,"Chicago, IL",320,40,24,4.0,2/22/2018,"This is the place I've been searching for. The place that serves food like I cook for myself. The food was healthy (truly healthy with wholesome and natural ingredients), had great flavor, and was perfectly filling. 4 stars though because I have a complaint. The staff was entirely unhelpful. I asked a question about the tea, cashier didn't know. I also felt like they shoved me out the door so even though I ordered to eat there, I ended up leaving and ate at home.",1,,1
41,Trips R.,"New York, NY",60,94,17,3.0,8/16/2017,Love the concept and the little cafe is adorable design and decor-wise but definitely won't be coming back for the food. The average lunch bowl costs $12 - $13 and the portion size is TINY and they take forever to give you your food. This is a tiny pay-at-the-counter place where you pick up your own food from the counter. For $12 I'd expect lunch that's atleast moderately filling. Not the size of a small appetizer salad and served in a flimsy paper bowl. So I'm pregnant and originally ordered the Grandma's chicken and rice. Some of The chicken pieces in the bowl were still a little pink in places and looked partially uncooked to me. I pointed it out to the staff and had to explain I'm pregnant and can't eat uncooked meat but they insisted that the brine they used to cook the chicken made it pink (only in some spots apparently). I had to repeat a couple of times that the meat definitely looked a little uncooked and I can't take the risk of eating it while pregnant and they finally let me change my order.Definitely not worth the price as there are plenty of healthy lunch options in the area that are cheaper and more filling. Maybe for you if you like the whole marketing around bone broth but the foods nothing special. Won't be back here anytime soon.,1,,
42,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,129,1,2.0,7/19/2018,"I was excited to try this place because I'm practicing the Keto Diet and they had a lot of low carb options. However, the food I had was bland and, in one instance, concerning as I bit into something that sounded like it was about to damage my teeth.I gave them two tries. The first try I had Grandma's Chicken & Rice, with their cauliflower rice substitute. All the sides tasted like I was eating plain, steamed vegetables and the chicken was underwhelming too.The second try I had the ""Spaghetti"" Bolognese"", with zoodles (julienne zucchini). Again, it was bland but also watery and a few times I bit into what felt like crystal like particles. I wanna say they reminded me of those oxalate crystals you sometimes get in spinach, except this wasn't spinach and I don't believe zucchini has them. I ate it anyways cuz I live dangerously, lol.I won't come here again, because this is one of those rare instances where I feel like I could do it better myself.

Grandma's Chicken and Rice bowl (subbing the rice for quinoa) is also really good. You can definitely tell that all of the ingredients are of great quality. The only reason that I'm not giving Springbone 5 stars, is that when ordering on seamless a few times they've forgotten to include the chicken and sweet potato in my broth and I've had to call to get them to bring my correct order.",,,
45,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",62,267,832,4.0,11/28/2016,"I really enjoyed the food at Springbone but the portions are way too small for the price point. All the dishes were cooked perfectly when I dined at this quaint cafe but I have a few pet peeves.Springbone's concept is mirroring gourmet fast casual - similar to Dig's Inn and Chop's Salad. The only difference is they are relatively new and smaller. They currently have one cafe near NYU. I refer to it as a cafe because it's too small and self-service to be called a ""restaurant"" in my opinion. I ordered the following three items from the menu - The markets plate consisted of three veggies and the woman seated next to me asked what it was. The reason for her inquiry was the veggies were layered on top of each other because they gave really small portions. Their portions are kid's size. The meatballs with zucchini with beef broth was one of my favorite dishes. The meatballs and broth were very flavorful.  Though I think they could've added more zucchini.I thought the chicken zoodle soup (zucchini instead of pasta) was delicious. The chicken was really fresh, meat was tender, broth was flavorful .  Soup came in a coffee cup instead of a normal soup carton (at Pretz, Au Bon Pain etc.). See pics. Please note, I zoomed to take these photos but the dishes were actually smaller in person.",4,1,1
46,Jenna C.,"Colonialtown North, Orlando, FL",167,26,18,5.0,2/26/2018,LOVE this place. The location is small and cute. Most patrons seem to take their food and go since there is about 15 seats or so. When we arrived we greeted by a young man and were offered samples because they have two different broths. My family and I decided to order a few things and split which was wildly successful. Their chicken zoodle soup is tasty and perfect for a cold day. We also enjoyed a burger which was delicious! We also had the zoodles and meatballs which was tasty and last but not least the carrot fries were BOMB!!! This location also offers a variety of snacks/sweets sold by other vendors so if you have food allergies you must check out this place. Thank you Springbone for providing quality and tasty food that accommodates my GF and DF self!,,,

The avocado toast with an egg and zaatar spice is a great example- it's really, really delicious, but I wish there were two slices to one order, or a larger piece of bread for the value. A winning flavor combination: avocado, egg, and zaatar on gluten-free bread... I will be replicating at home. Thank you for healthy food, inspiration, and excellent service!

Every ingredient tasted fresh and nourishing, and though the portion initially looked small, I was beyond full by the time I finished. The chicken and vegetables had just enough flavor without tasting too bland or too much. Price-wise, Springbone is reasonable especially given the area and the quality of the food.The ambiance is very cute, as well, and I got some reading in while eating! There were a few loud groups, but I'm sure that varies throughout the day. Coincidentally, I was sitting next to the owners in my spot on the counter by the front window, and they were both so nice! I do wish the food was less salty, though, and that they added more veggies in the bowl (essentially, two carrots). I'll definitely be back as the weather turns colder, and my cravings for warm broth and bowls come back.",2,,

Updated review","My favorite thing about revisiting a place is that you learn so much more about it. I had the pleasure of trying Springbone's zucchini ""spaghetti"" with grass-fed beef meatballs AND the burger. I have to say, that beef is so tender and juicy. Plus, you can rest assured that everything on the menu is sourced locally! More humane, better tasting. Which is winning all around. The spaghetti dish comes with a tiny side of beef broth that you can ceremoniously pour over the noodles or just enjoy as a side companion. I loved having a whole cup of Liquid Gold (chicken broth with coconut milk and turmeric) to enjoy throughout the meal (who doesn't love to say that they are drinking Liquid Gold??). There are not many things in life that make me look forward to New York City winter. Call me bougie, but imagining walking around with some Liquid Gold broth when it's cold outside, I can get with that thought.",4,1,2

Updated review","Finally made it back to try their vegan soft serve, which was great. The always there Dark Chocolate Avocado was delicious, but the seasonal Strawberry Rhubarb was even better. They're both really light and refreshing, and you can get them on their own or in a swirl.I also recently tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Grandma's Chicken and Rice, which were also delicious. I might be more inclined to try the bone broth once the colder weather returns, but for now, the rest of their stuff is pretty great too.",10,5,10

They have fully established the whole food healthy diet and created a safe place to eat according to the best advice from the greatest health books 'Deep Nutrition' and 'The Omnivores Dilemma. I hope more places get on the no vegetable oil bandwagon. It is this kind of eating that will save us from obesity, ADHD, mood disorders, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's and more. Our genes can be healed with proper nutrition. Whatever the owners actual prerogative is, they are helping us in a genuine way. Keep at it- and come to Brooklyn!",,,
57,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1144,813,4.0,6/24/2016,"I stopped by for a quick dinner and was pleasantly surprised. A crop of bone broth soup kitchens have sprung up around the NYU campus recently and I have been meaning to try them all...starting here! I love the bright, warm atmosphere and the sleekness of the furniture. The menu is simple and focuses on their bone broths, which are prepared beforehand and stored in large thermoses on the countertop. The 'spaghetti' and meatballs was the first thing that caught my eye. It consists of grass-fed beef meatballs atop a bed of zoodles (zucchini noodles), topped with pasta sauce, beef broth, and a bit of parmesan. For $11, I was disappointed with the serving size, but it was a feel-good, filling meal for what it was, and I was satisfied.I definitely want to stop by for their paleo ice cream before the summer ends, and I can totally see myself stopping by here for some soup to warm my belly on a cooler day in the fall or winter!",6,2,4

Updated review",I am currently exploring the ketosis diet and am always looking for places that promote my diet. I came here because I found this place on yelp and needed to try it out. I make my own bone broth at home but have never tried another. I ordered the butter bone broth and it was amazing. Really really tasty. I ordered the iced matcha latte and it was very good and very filling. I am definitely coming back here again. I got a tub of frozen bone broth to go for the week. It's pretty pricey but if you calculate making your own it's a steal!,1,,

Loved my toast and got some chicken broth (which I proceeded to spill all over me and the subway) and I came back for their zoodles and meatballs. Came back again for their zoodles and meatballs, bought some for my mom. My mom is very white and isn't used to flavor and was frazzled by the curry flavor of the meatballs. We don't listen to my mother because she does only season with Montreal steak seasoning. Brought one of my friends for some zoodles and meatballs, he loved it.

62,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1105,1096,3.0,12/9/2016,"A-OK. Pros: They serve La Columbe coffee so you at least know the quality of the beans and know what it's going to taste like. They're also on the CUPS app. Cons: It's not a very comfortable place to do work or even sit down and have a chat while eating - none of the chairs have backs and they're all wood. Also, their coffee options are pretty limited. You're basically stuck with tea, a latte or regular coffee with butter. I had an Avocado Toast, which is tasty but pretty small.",3,1,1

64,Kitty W.,"Forest Hills, NY",284,386,570,4.0,11/28/2016,"Springbone is truly amazing. But yes, the price isn't, hence the 4 stars. I remember seeing pictures of the bone broth on a friend's instagram, but didn't truly discover Springbone til I stumbled upon a deal on Gilt City. I ended up buying a voucher with a value of $50 for dine in or take out for $25. Now with that price I would deem the food worth it. Yes, I get it. The food is healthy, fresh, gluten free, etc. - which means a higher price point, but I really don't find certain items worth it.Zucchini Spaghetti* & Meatballs - DELICIOUS. Springbone has the zucchini julienned perfectly to give a perfect ""pasta-like"" consistency with a little bit of crunch. The dish itself was filling, but it was only a few meatballs, sauce, and a lot of julienned zucchini for $12. Though delicious, the dish was a little heavy on the salt. It comes with a teeny tiny cup of the famous beef broth which sort of tasted like an americanized version of pho broth to me (which I do not mind at all, it was quite good.) Grandma's Chicken & Rice (organic wild rice, organic chicken, roasted carrots, string beans, citrus-beet puree, hot sauce and chicken broth) - Good hearty dish, but I wasn't a fan of the beet puree. The roasted carrots were out of this world and I don't even like carrots. Chicken was just shredded chicken so it's literally just an added protein in a flavorful dish. Mexican Bowl (organic wild rice, black beans, organic chicken, guac, pico de gallo and chicken broth) - I fell in LOVE with this dish. If you're ever craving for chipotle or some unhealthy tex-mex, please drop by Springbone and give their Mexican Bowl a try. It's $10.50 and you won't get nearly half as much as you would in chipotle, but the quality is there, and it's healthy! Everything paired so well together. The pico de gallo was fresh and the guac was absolutely delicious. I do wish there was a little more rice and a little less beans though. The chicken in this rice bowl somehow tasted better than the chicken in the Grandma's Chicken & Rice as well. Why? I don't know. Both rice bowls came with a teeny cup of chicken broth which I didn't like. I'm sure Springbone is more famous for their beef broth rather than chicken anyway.Some cons:Side of Broccoli - Was it $4.95 or $5.95? I forgot, but it's not worth it. Broccoli was browned and way overcooked. I did not care for it and overcooked broccoli has close to no nutrients in it anyway.Chicken Broth - As previously stated - Meh. It was so heavy and didn't taste much different from chicken stock to me. It's ok as a small complimentary side to an entree, but definitely not worth buying individually. This nasty nasty bottled chai they sell - Ok, this isn't really their fault because they're just selling the darn beverage. BUT steer clear of that chai drink made with coconut milk in the fridge. It's $6.50 and tastes like pure shit.",4,2,2

I got the zucchini spaghetti and the vanilla chia seed pudding. It was jumping in the shop, so I waited around for a while before finally getting my food. I think they are suffering from some growing pains--the frozen yogurt machine was down and it looked a little disheveled in the store. Once I got home, I popped open my zoodles and devoured it within 3.5 seconds. I could have eaten 3 more helpings. The chia seed pudding was equally as delicious and equally as small, so that went down the hatch quickly after.   All in all I really enjoy this place.

I find the salted wild looking rice base to have good umami on its own, and the additions with each of the different bowls are super flavorful.  I do recommend for Springbone to increase the ratio of toppings to rice as it's sometimes sadly sparse. Service is friendly and relatively fast when I order at the counter, probably ~10 mins. Price is a bit on the high side for a fast casual type place, so I can't eat here everyday unfortunately.

Came here for a snack since I've walked by multiple times and was excited to check it out. Honestly, the food was subpar (scrambled eggs with bacon and avocado mash). They forgot the ""avocado mash"" with my eggs. However, the service was the worst part. There were about 5 employees standing behind the counter not doing a single thing (or just eating and talking, I guess that counts as doing something). When I discovered that they forgot my ""avocado mash"", I went back and asked for something which I paid for. The workers couldn't be bothered and were pretty nonchalant, but someone ended up plopping the ""mash"" on my eggs anyway. Pretty terrible customer service. It's not like they were slammed and couldn't remember the third ingredient (eggs, bacon, and ""avocado mash""). Regret stopping by here and regret giving a tip (initially) even more so.",5,1,1

73,Mary L.,"San Francisco, CA",317,150,163,4.0,12/4/2016,"When looking for vegan ice cream in NYC I discovered Springbone, and I am really glad I did! Despite the fact they didn't actually have any vegan ice cream (their soft serve machine was broken) I ate there twice while I was in NYC. First, I went for dinner. I had a really hard time deciding what to order, since everything looked so tasty and I was starving. One of the owners was there and was very patient with me and answered all my questions and debates about what to order. After much deliberation I chose the Mexican Bowl, with chicken and a sample of beef broth. It was good! It was a generous portion, with cauliflower rice, chicken, pico de gallo, and guacamole, along with a  4oz cup of broth. I make this kind of food at home, and it was nice to feel a little bit of home while away from home.They had a chocolate bar for sale that looked good - chocolate sweetened with honey. I hadn't tried it before, and after asking the one owner about it I decided to buy that and try it later. I enjoyed my dinner there and really like the open seating arrangement. I spoke with two other patrons, as the ambiance was friendly and welcoming. Before I left the other owner and I were talking and he said he didn't like the chocolate bar I purchased. He claimed that he thought it tasted horrible, and less to his liking. Everyone's tastebuds are different and I appreciate his honesty about his dislike of the bar, but it definitely had me wondering if it was going to be worth what I spent on it. Two days later I went in the morning because I saw on their online menu they had a baked egg in avocado that was exactly what I wanted for breakfast. When I actually got there they didn't actually have that menu item. Bummed, but I went with the beef broth with sweet potato. It was good. They blend the sweet potato with the beef broth and serve it in a coffee cup. It was perfect for enjoying on a crisp day during my walk up to Central Park. It was more crowded in the morning than when I went for dinner.The prices are reasonable. $5 for a cup of broth, which isn't much more than a cup of coffee or latte, yet arguably more nutritious and filling. The dinner bowls and options are less than $15 as well, making it a nice place for regular dining.The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because some of the items listed on the menu were not actually available. The soft serve ice cream, as I mentioned, and a couple of the breakfast items. As a fellow business owner I understand that things break and menu items change. I would just ask that if it's going to be longer than a day, change the online menu or post some update to inform people who are searching online before coming in to eat/drink.I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to eat healthy and delicious food in NYC. The vibe is friendly. The food is fresh. And it's great for anyone looking for paleo, gluten-free, no refined sugar, or otherwise looking for some wholesome food.",1,,

Beyond their delicious bone broth choices, I am thankful for their awesome gluten free avocado toast (with or without an egg.)  Nice to have a great guilt-free go to place for a quick after work. I've also purchased  a few quarts for my freezer too for those cold winter days. Prices are not cheap but they are in line with the other bone broth joints in the city. At the entrance, there is  an assortment of paleo friendly bars, raw chocolates. In the fridge there are interesting desserts and drinks. I haven't tried those yet as I'm pretty full after the broth and avocado toast:)There is also paleo soft serve dessert on the menu, but the machine has been broken every time I've been there - so can't speak to that. Maybe that will be back up and running by spring.",1,,

77,Bri D.,"Portland, OR",46,76,57,3.0,12/3/2017,"First off they were really nice and accommodating to answering questions. She even let me sample some of the broths before I got one. Very kind. Second, yay for an almost whole30 type place! Nice to see them. The broth was amazingly good. I feel a little pricey for what you get but I also know the trouble of making the broth. I found the chicken to be flavorful but not the beef as much. The vegetable one was okay. This is all preference though! The chili special they had was soooo good. I kept sneaking bites from my friends. Unfortunately what I ordered did not satisfy me. I had the spaghetti and lamb meatballs (the zoodles had too much skin on them imo). The sauce just lacked flavor and was really watered down. I also got a salad which had almost nothing on it but lettuce. Hardly any vegetables. I got it to go so I didn't feel like going back to fix things. For the prices they charge, needs to be better than that sorry. Love the concept though and happy to see places pop up like this.",,,

Seeing workers and owners touching food with bare hands, no hand washing, and no hat was kind of a worry. The chicken broth ran low so the portion I got was about 30% chicken fat and when the owner who made my broth asked the other worker who told him more hot broth would take time (although she offered to quickly heat a small amount) he went ahead and made my order anyway. He knew and he did it anyway. I took a few sips as I had already been waiting for my small Chakra $6.50 cup of blended chicken fat and started to feel nauseous so I had to throw it away.

The second time, I also ordered a Chakra broth (so so good!!) and they gave that to me right away and told me that my avocado toast would be ready shortly..but after another 15 minutes, it did not come. I went up to ask them where my order was and the employee said ""You didn't get it yet?"" Overall, food is really good, but they definitely need to be a lot more organized.",1,,

87,Nadia A.,"Port Chester, NY",0,3,3,4.0,11/30/2017,"Food and broth gets !Came into the city for a meeting and felt like I was getting a cold. I had the ""spaghetti"" and meatballs and it was good. Had a nice spicy kick to it, and the kick seemed to come from black pepper. The tomato sauce was very fresh and chunky. I loved the meatballs, they were lean and savory. The shot of beef bone broth was so good! It reminds me of this beef soup my abuelita makes and tasted like it had corn and chayote (don't know the translation but it's a Mexican root). However, I don't think this recipe includes corn because the place seems to be paleo-centric. That being said, it tells me the other roots in the broth were definitely cooked down with the bone and gave the broth a hint of sweetness and a velvety smooth texture. Needless to say the beef bone broth was so good, I decided to have the immunity broth without the added vitamin c. This broth is delicious! You can tell they use fresh ginger and garlic. I'll update this later and let you know if it also stopped my cold in it's tracks. LOCATION - the only reason I gave this 4-stars is because the place is so small and there was a book signing? You can barely walk in the space if you're waiting to pick up food, let alone lounge. I think if they had a larger location they could have a ""broth bar"". I could see networking space for a broth happy hour that would also allow patrons who are sitting not feel like those standing are on top of them. I stayed long enough to get a sense of a regular Thursday night, after the group left, and it was chill, good music and cozy. Also, their delivery guys seem super busy! Finally, as many of you know I have a ton of allergies. I didn't have an allergic reaction to the broth or spaghetti and meatballs or the broths. I did not try the smoothies or deserts because it had coconut milk, but I can vouch for not having a cross contact allergic reaction (++++ in my book). Overall, great food  no allergic reaction  and the staff was friendly.",,,

The portion looked small in photos but it's actually quite large and super filling; the meatballs were filled with spices that made it unique and very tasty. It was amazing and have definitely become one of my go-to lunch spots!The service here was also superb and I couldn't have had a better time there. While waiting for my to-go, one of the workers came up to me multiple times, sincerely apologizing for the wait which I didn't mind at all (a 10-15 mins. wait as they were just cooking the next batch of meatballs).

91,T C.,"New York, NY",0,49,5,3.0,2/23/2017,"I like SB but today I was very disappointed. Firstly, the chalkboard advertises a coconut hot chocolate made with ""cane-sugar free, dairy free"" Raaka chocolate. This excites me as I cannot eat either dairy or cane sugar for a serious health issue. I went to order but didn't see the Cane sugar dairy free Raaka at the counter, so I asked the girl which Raaka they use since the three at the front all had cane sugar. She went back to check and said it was the ones in the front. When I suggested maybe the erase the section of the board advertising that the chocolate is cane sugar free, she shrugged and said ""I guess so"". Seriously? If I hadn't asked and I had ended up getting that drink I would have become extremely ill. For a place that prides itself on healthy and fresh food, this is not acceptable and makes me question the validity of ingredients they are actually using. Secondly, one of the guys working in the back handling the food, was wearing a tank top. Every time he reached over the food I thought, oh gosh his armpit hairs are shedding into the food!! So gross. I'm not sure I could eat anything at Springbone for a while. Today just upset me too much. Before today, I went all the time for the bone broth and other snacks. Then one broth is very good.",1,2,

I am surprised, fortunately for me, the place only had a handful of patrons inside and I was able to order, eat, and people watch in peace. The staff was very friendly and helpful in describing the dishes in each section. I tasted 3 (seaweed miso, chicken and beef) of the 4 broths. I really really liked both the chicken and beef broths. I decided on the liquid gold - I'm a sucker for nutritious creations made with coconut milk and turmeric. It's made with chicken broth and OMG it was so tasty! I'm already thinking of trying to make it myself for lunch next week. I was debating between the spaghetti and meatballs and the burger. I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs because I wanted some veggies (zucchini spaghetti), some meat (grass fed beef meatball) and some beef broth. While I thought the sauce was a little watery for the dish, I had enough sauce in the end to pour into a cup and drink, which I enjoyed. The star of the dish were the meatballs, juicy and flavorful. For dessert the staff advised they're still working on improving the consistency of the dark chocolate. I did have a taste of it and can taste the avocado which was good but agreed it was too liquidy for a soft serve. I tried the berry ice cream which is banana based and it was good. But I would rather save my calories for their broths which are tasty, good for the heart and soul, and filling!

On five occasions I've called ahead for scrambled eggs and a side of bacon. And on three of those occasions, my order took longer than 20 minutes to make.

Perfectly cooked and a real treat for all of us. I was disappointed because the carrot fries were not available. We were given a complimentary serving of the house golden chicken broth which was delicious in its simplicity. We also tried, new to the menu the coconut fermented soft serve ice cream. It was amazing. We returned several days later and the same restaurant was a complete fail. Still no carrot fries, no paleo buns, brusk service with eye rolling attitude. The roasted sweet potatoes were burned to a crisp. The food fell flat, I mean really, how hard is it to make gluten free almond butter toast?

Only constructive critic I have from someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for years is better attentiveness from staff. We were really excited to have some soft serve and after asking our questions about it and picking a flavor the cashier finally told us they won't have it till later.

You gotta be kidding me. Prices are a bit high, but the ingredients seem top notch so I can't complain too much. So five stars for food and service, minus one for what seems to me to be a flawed concept (or at least one that disagrees with me).",1,,

130,Emily C.,"New York, NY",90,17,3,4.0,10/2/2016,"This place is a pretty good addition to the Village. The bone broth is very tasty, some of the best bone broth I've had, in fact (although I've only had the chicken so far), and the bowls are generally very delicious. The prices are very typical of the area, and the cost of the bone broth is comparable to Barney's bone broth off of Waverly place, with most varieties being between $6-8 for basic broth, and a few dollars extra for special add ins.I'm only deducting one star because their ice cream machine is broken half the time I go there (it's been at least three times now). Their vegan soft serve is very delicious and healthy, especially the chocolate flavor, and they even make seasonal flavors throughout the year (the current one being apple pie). Unfortunately, since the soft serve machine seems to break down all the time, I wouldn't suggest making the trek to Springbone purely for the ice cream- go mostly for the broth and bowls. Overall, this is a good place to get a healthy lunch, especially if you're craving something more like comfort food (but without all the fat and calories). They have plenty of vegan and gluten free options too! I'll be back for sure.",,,

My friend ordered brownie ballS to go and when we picked up our bone broth to go, having never been there, wasn't sure if we should go ahead and help ourselves to the prepackaged brownie in the fridge or wait for help. When we inquired with the young gentlemen behind the counter he asked her how many she bought she said one and he said that's how many she should take stating "" it's simple"". Being first time visitors, and the fact that the menu states brownie ballS which is plural being friendly and helpful would have gone a long way. Other than that the food was delicious.",1,1,

My main beef is that they are constantly running out of stuff - their operations need to be improved to meet the demand.,,,

I'm very disappointed with today's experience - after I ordered a simple cup of soup to go (which would take 5 min max to fill) - the cashier who was supposed to handle my drink went to the back kitchen to chat while leaving me hanging for like 15 min UNTIL another employee finally checked in with me on my order (EVEN he seemed surprised that I was still waiting) and called the canister out.  She finally walked out and apologized that she forgot! Excuse me, I think filling a cup filled with liquid should be the easiest task a kitchen staff could do, not to mention how someone could ""forget"" your order when this place only had two customers at that time!

Wasn't feeling hot bone broth in the 90 degree heat, but tried the berry soft serve and was blown away. Permission to be a fat-ass without the guilt.

When they finally got the food to me, I was a bit surprised at the super small portion. It probably won't even fill a regular girl's stomach. So I probably won't come again for lunch. However, with that being said, the taste was good and though the broth was a bit thinner than I imagined it to be, the chicken was wel done and isn't too dry overall.

Updated review","After visiting springbone on their opening day several months back, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth from the undercooked shakshuka and underwhelming avo toast, but I decided to give them another try a few weeks ago and so much has changed. Extremely tasty avo toast with kimchi, the fluffiest, creamiest scrambled you'll find anywhere in NYC, delicious broths and no more shakshuka. Great for a quick, healthy bite any day of the week.",,,

The bone broths are really good but too salty for me ( I tend to be sensitive since I cook low salt and cook paleo at home.). I had the burger with a mushroom bun and it was swimming in oil and salty. I've also had the avo mash on a paleo bun but it was more like quac on a bun. It was over mashed. I think they are still working on kinks on supplies / cooking. In my two visits they have run out of ketchup, paleo bun, bacon, and forks. I will come back and try some of the other stuff but I legitimately cook better paleo food at home. I would rather go to Hu Kitchen.",2,1,1

153,Amanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,110,129,2.0,8/16/2016,"Had such a disappointing experience at Springbone today. I came here with my boyfriend at around 12:30pm and there was a bit of a wait to snag seats, since it's a small space with counter service. We ordered the ""spaghetti"" and meatballs ($11.95) and grandma's chicken and rice ($10.50), both of which were kind of pricey for the small serving size. Taste-wise, neither dish was really memorable, but I do appreciate the health-conscious concept behind the shop. The meatballs were extremely salty and the tomato sauce was bland and watery (probably from the zoodles). The chicken and rice was flavorful and the meat was tender, so it was definitely the better option. Each dish comes with a side of bone broth and both were rich and flavorful as well. The service, on the other hand, was less than mediocre. My boyfriend was quickly served his chicken and rice, but I got my entree at least 15 minutes later. At this point, his broth was already lukewarm because he wanted to wait for my food to start eating. Shout-out to the single staff member who actually came and apologized and said the dish was coming soon (wish I had gotten her name because she was the only one who really seemed to care about us). When the spaghetti and meatballs did get plated, it ended up getting served to another party because they ordered the same thing even though I ordered before him. The same staff member tried to say that it was for me, but since the other party was closer to the kitchen, they got it first. When I finally did get my dish, it was in a take-out container, so I'm assuming that it wasn't even intended for me but they gave it to me because I had waited for so long. I also had to ask for the broth on the side before they remembered it. To top off it all off, the party behind us who had also been waiting for their food was offered free ice cream on the house... even though we waited for a long time too, if not longer. The entire experience was extremely frustrating -- we were barely offered an apology from anyone besides the one kind staff member. Definitely a lot of kinks to work out.",6,1,1

155,Margaret R.,"Bronx, NY",0,17,5,2.0,2/11/2017,"I came here with my friends last week. The avocado toast was great, and I'd go again for that, but the hot chocolate was, to put it bluntly, horrible. It had an oddly thick consistency due to its atypical ingredients (I believe they put maple syrup in it?), and maybe the fact that it was made with coconut milk and dark chocolate didn't help. But I suppose if you're vegan, you might like it. It was also very crowded in there; it wasn't the best atmosphere if you wanted to sit down.",,,

My mates ordered avocado on toast which was decent. And a burger the looked like a big drippy mess and carrots fried in beef grease that nobody ate more than one of.

160,Alex P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,27,0,1.0,5/17/2016,"This place opened up right next to my apartment, and I was so excited to try it since I feel there is a lack of healthy fresh organic options in the neighborhood. Well I was disappointed. I respect the concept that they are going with, which is healthy home made broths. However, the execution was not good. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they are still working out the kinks. They still need to refine their flavors and adjust their portion sizes. (Also there was a weird argument that happened between the manager and the cashier when we were there and it was awkward because they didn't understand what we ordered even though we read it exactly off of the menu. I guess they were new? But that's not something that you shout over in front of your customers.)We ordered the Butterbroth, Avocado toast, and an Egg frittata sandwich called ""You just said Egg"". All of which sounded delicious from their description on the menu. My favorite of the three was the avocado toast. I mean, avocado toast is something that is hard to mess up, so I wasn't that impressed. It was good, nothing amazing. I could have made the same exact thing at home, but better. The pieces of toast were miniscule. Size: Think of taking a square post-it note and ripping it in half, that's about the size of each toast piece. It was kind of pathetic, and they charge $5 for that. The next item I enjoyed was the Egg frittata sandwich. Average. Again, extremely small, since they use the same toast they use for the avocado toast. I wish I took a picture. it was the smallest egg sandwich I have ever seen in my life. Maybe there was like half an egg used in the sandwich part. Also the egg part was not made to order. It was premade. Oh and they also forgot to add the additional cheese and bacon they had charged us extra for. This was around $7 which is a complete rip-off.The WORST of all three items was the broth itself. Funny that the whole concept of this restaurant is focused on broth and yet it was the worst item we ate. The beef broth had a mild beefy flavor, and then the whole cup of broth was completely overcome with disgusting butter flavor. It was salty, it was foamy, it was beefy. It was disgusting. We took one sip and immediately threw it in the garbage. It was nauseating.I think I'm going to wait a few months before I try this place again. I am really disappointed by their portion size to price ratio. And I would think that a restaurant like this would be more into using fresh ingredients instead of using premade egg sandwiches. (If I wanted a premade egg sandwich I would go to McDonalds which is one block away and pay a tenth of the price, and it would be better.) I really hope they can improve.",4,1,

Was not too salty or greasy, which can be said of a lot of broth! I also ordered a side of eggs and avocado mash, which was incredible. You could actually tell the quality of ingredients used to make the eggs! Real butter and milk was used, in contrast to the usual greasy vegetable oils that many restaurants in the city use, and they were delicious! They also included a side of their gluten-free toast which was made out of some seed blend and was UNREAL with the side of avocado mash. Their packaging was also beautiful! My broth came in a beautifully branded ""grande"" sized coffeecup, so I drank it around the office without any ""WHATS THAT?!"" and other remarks about drinking bone-broth.

On occasion, I make my own bone broth so I know firsthand the cost of obtaining grass-fed bones and the time investment to make a few batches. Suffice to say it is very time-consuming. So I allow for the steep price+NYC real estate costs+NYC labor, etc. and can mentally justify the steep price for one small cup.",,,

185,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,3.0,10/1/2016,"Delicious, but strange objects in the food. Decided to try bone broth for the first time today. This place was more convenient than Brodo so swung by for takeout. Got the spaghetti with zucchini pasta which comes with a side of broth. Had the broth first. Delicious. Started on the spaghetti. Tomato sauce had a bit of a spicy kick to it and meatballs were great. But on third or fourth bite of the pasta I felt something rigid in there. Thought it might be a stem from an herb or something. Whatever it was got lodged in the back of my mouth and I was gagging for a while. Finally managed to pull out the object and it looked to be a very thin strip of metal. Still not sure what it was. So the food itself tasted good but there maybe needs to be a bit more quality assurance in the kitchen.",,,
186,D F.,"West Orange, NJ",1,2,0,5.0,8/1/2016,"The liquid gold was delicious, as was the burger (with avocado). The food is unique and original. I plan on going back to try a different broth & the meatballs. It was refreshing to grab a hearty, healthy meal. The inside is sleek with a bright, lively feel. Overall, it's a great place.",,,
187,Celisse H.,"New York, NY",0,11,1,1.0,7/12/2016,"Food is great, customer service is NOT. I have come to this restaurant 4 xs and Every single time there are issues. To go order is made to stay, the chef has stepped out for 15 minutes, the yogurt machine isn't working, etc. No food is good enough to deal with such disorganization. Hopefully they get it together soon.",,,

191,Andrew D.,"Mamaroneck, NY",82,1,0,5.0,8/1/2016,"Delicious and healthy food. Try the zuccini pasta and meatball, the broth obviously, but most importantly the awesome meat popsicle. Great little place!",,,
192,Ingrid A.,"Manhattan, NY",11,33,883,5.0,12/12/2016,"When a restaurant only uses coconut oil or olive oil, how can you not give them five stars. Not only is the food yummy but you feel really good after eating their food and my daughter loves it. Win win. Finding a second home when I'm feeling a bit lazy from cooking or in a rush is a dream. I thought I had found other healthy restaurants but then I always get surprised with unhealthy ways such as pouring their super healthy super hot soup in a big plastic bin. Hot liquid in plastic? Big no no. Or I'll catch one of the kitchen people touching their nose then grabbing the food, or licking the spoon and sticking it back in to stir. I have yet to see these antics at Springbone which is just as important. Thanks guys!",,,
193,Fang G.,"New York, NY",121,3,0,1.0,10/24/2016,"Great food, but TERRIBLE service/staff. Pretty sure they only have less than ten glasses for tap water, which I wasn't able to utilized when was there. It's a restaurant w/ a full lunch/dinner menu -- doesn't have a sink for ppl to wash their hands, just had a generic bottle of hand sanitizer (talking about healthy and organic), which ran out by the time I got there. The cashier was not very efficient and seemed confused when I asked if there is a place to wash hands, then another employee chimed in and told me the bathroom is for customers only, which later I was being told the opposite (I was told it's a violation of health codes for customers to use their bathroom, like really? You don't even let you customers wash their dirty hands when the hand sensitizer ran out, how ironic!). What added to my frustration was that my order didn't even get taken in until 25 minutes later when I asked about the whereabouts of my food, and their reply was simply ""oh that's our bad, but it takes another 12 minutes to make what you ordered."" -- no apologies whatsoever. The whole place seemed very disgruntled and unorganized, which I understand because it seems like a new place, but that doesn't justify an overwhelmingly disappointing experience.",1,,
194,Anna D.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,1.0,2/6/2017,Second time ordering and they didn't complete the order yet again. I even made a note for them to please double check this time and they still didn't. The food is good but it's really a shame they're so unreliable.,,,
195,Adam F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,5,5.0,8/20/2016,"I went in today and had the grandma's chicken and rice. Delicious! I doubt my grandmother knows about wild rice but if she did, she'd love it. Friendly staff and really nice decor. Can't wait to go back.",1,1,1
196,Eva M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,3.0,7/2/2017,"i've always had positive experiences with the staff , at times the wait is pretty long (even when not crowded ) so typically not someplace i go to grab something if i'm in a hurry . i think the bone broth is saltier than other places so i avoid getting that here.  the smoothies are always good. i was excited to finally be able to get the soft serve, disappointed when the server (very politely) informed me there's a no sample policy so i passed on that and lunch there today.",,,
197,Olivia R.,"Ridgefield, CT",8,38,34,4.0,6/5/2016,"My boyfriend and I stopped in on our way to meeting some friends. We had some time to kill until dinner and we were getting hungry. We stumbled upon springbone.... And I was captivated by bone broth. I LOVE bone broth and its nutrients that it provides. Looking at the Menu was a little confusing.  They have a custom Menu where you can choose your broth and add-Ins ranging from: meatball (which I found a little odd for a broth add in) pomegranate juice (still odd)... So I chose 'liquid gold' I make 'golden milk'  at home and It's a combination of this and bone marrow broth. Ultimately I had to try! Two of my favorites in a cup I can sip?! SOLD. The liquid gold was so heavenly that my boyfriend (who is a hard to please by the palate) ordered a cup. Bone broth mixed with I believe a nut milk, turmeric. Packed with nutrients. If I lived closer I would probably come in 3x a wk. I know bone broths improve with our overall health;, collagen, amino acids, glycine, and proline levels. Lastly, I ordered the vanilla coconut chia pudding my bf ordered the Berry paleo ice cream. The ice cream was decent, tasty although for pricing of both, I think the scoops could of been bigger. I was disappointed that they ran out of their homemade granola for the pudding.. But it's fine...  I have hopes for this new stop... I think their add-ins are extensive and they should prob just stick with liquid gold and 1-2 custom Broths... Maybe even salut the idea of a broth sampler.... Other then the menu being a little extensive .. I have hopes and I wish them the best of luck! When I'm on the lower east side again, I'll definitely be back for more broth and pudding.",1,,
198,Lara B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/5/2016,"You don't have to be a health nut to enjoy Springbone kitchen... I absolutely love all the food here. It's great for a midday snack or a full meal. I highly recommend the Liquid Gold broth and the chicken with rice. The service is great too, and I really enjoy sitting here (free wifi!) to enjoy a nice break in the day. Can't wait to try the soft serve next time I'm there!",1,,
199,Brandon L.,"New York, NY",1,22,0,4.0,5/23/2016,"I had a large chicken broth with golden milk (a kind of turmeric tea), kombu flakes and MCT oil. It tasted good and made my scratchy throat and sinuses feel a lot better. I understand why it cost as much as it did--$11.70 for a 20 ounce cup of broth with enhancements--since commercial rents in this town are so outrageous. But I wish we lived in a city and a world that didn't value money the way they do, because I'd go back and have that cup of good, healthy stuff quite often. Still, I work near this place, so I'll be dropping in every once in a while.",,,
