My favorite thing to get is the sausage, egg, and cheese on a roll with a latte on the side. I like that they use cheddar cheese rather than american. The staff are really friendly and always have smiles on their face.",,,
1,Elaine L.,"Boston, MA",191,137,355,5.0,12/20/2017,"This is my favorite cafe around the area. The inside is really clean and cute. There's many food options on the menu and the drinks are SO good!! Service is excellent and you never have to wait long for the food to come out. Friendly, family owned business. I'll be stopping by again when I'm back in the area.",2,,2

The salad that comes with the meal is crisp and fresh, although I wish there was more to it. We just stopped in and took food to go, but we ordered and were out the door within ten minutes. I just wish they were open later!",,,
3,Christina C.,"New York, NY",9,196,167,4.0,11/9/2017,"I walk into Zanny's this morning because it is inviting and there are quite a number of people already in there right at 8 in the morning. It is definitely something.Although it looks a little dated, everything else compensated for it.  They have enough room for seats and since the cafe occupies a corner unit, it has lots of window which allows plenty of natural lights in spite that it has already has a good number of warm lights which made the whole cafe warm and cozy.The biggest plus of the cafe must be the ones behind the counter and register. Only 2 people working but they run it efficiently. The lady is attentive and her hands are all over, knowing exactly what is going around in her cafe. Thumbs up for her hard work. I would believe the negative is the lacking of a bathroom which I don't see.   But yet this is a good place to have breakfast and coffee.",,,

5,Gary M.,"Huntington, NY",3,122,255,3.0,3/15/2018,Was searching for a breakfast place in what seems like an area devoid of any diners or coffee shops... stumbled upon this little place and ordered a Black Forest and egg wrap with cheddar ... it was cooked perfectly and a nice touch was the wrapper was toasted crisp not doughy ... the coffee was a bit cold but they heated it for me and it was good ... try this place,,,

7,Aaron L.,"New York, NY",313,120,1,5.0,6/19/2017,"I've been meaning to re-review Zanny's for a while here since they were bought out by new management. Usually when a restaurant gets bought out, the new management does everything they can to ruin what made the spot popular in the first place, but Zanny's is the exception to the rule. The new management is much nicer than the old, and their chefs are much better. Honestly, the wraps and breakfast sandwiches here are some of the best I've had.I've lived above this place for 12 years now so I have a pretty good idea of whether or not to recommend it. I think it's great, and really underrated for breakfast.",3,2,2
8,Naomi F.,"New York, NY",184,52,73,4.0,7/7/2017,"The Scotia Nova is pretty dayum yummy. It's like a lox, goat cheese, red onion omlette wrapped up and grilled on a panini press, which is such a good idea. There should be more panini wraps. Every bite has a nice pocket of everything. I'd really like to try the other wraps on the menu. I overheard someone else rave about #7.  For the caffeine fiends, rejoice! Every wrap comes with a cuppa joe and 2nd helpings are totally welcomed. Beware that you might need to wait to get a table during the mid morning rush.",,,

10,Alexander T.,"Washington, DC",441,207,226,3.0,9/8/2016,"Stopped by for an everything bagel with lox/cream cheese and a coffee.Wasn't too busy for a Saturday morning, but the bagel took a surprising while to prepare. It was just alright, and nothing remarkable.If other nearby cafes (see Starbucks, Nussbaum, etc) weren't always so full on Saturdays then maybe I wouldn't return. But it's an admittedly nice place and not too badly priced. May come back if I'm not in a rush and looking for a spot to hole up with a coffee and bagel.",,,
11,Sally E.,"New York, NY",0,30,0,1.0,12/21/2017,"The food at this place is perfectly fine. The reason they get a bad review is because they wouldn't sell me 16 bagels. They feel that they make more money by selling bagel sandwiches, and so they would not sell me 16 bagels. I am a teacher and I had promised my kids that I would bring bagels for our class holiday party today--and I had to show up bagel-less because they refused to sell them to me. Absolutely outrageous. Boycott this place on principle. They are so concerned with profit that they refused to sell food to a paying customer (and, I might add, I've been a regular customer there since I moved to the neighborhood). What a bunch of scrooges. I will never go back to this place.",,,
12,Christine R.,"Manhattan, NY",76,83,77,4.0,4/2/2016,This hidden little cafe is such a great spot for breakfast or lunch! The staff is always friendly and the coffee is great! I really like their all day breakfast wraps. They're around $8-$9 for a wrap and a 16 oz coffee so not a bad deal. They're also great about substituting the ingredients if you want to swap out something. I've also had their cookies and bagels and they're always fresh! Zanny's is definitely a great spot to pick up takeout or stop for a leisurely meal :),,,
13,Abby A.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,25,22,5.0,8/6/2017,"This is my neighborhood coffee spot! The people who work here and the fellow patrons are so friendly.

16,Fangfei S.,"Manhattan, NY",2,37,0,5.0,5/11/2016,"It's such a shame for me to find out Zanny's after living in Mo-Hi for almost a year. I always knew it was there, but was kinda intimidated by the size of the cafe, which seems tiny from the exterior.Last week in the morning of a workday I tried their Jalisco wrap and substituted the bacon by tomatoes. It was hot, refreshing, filling and not too cheesy for a morning person. Just the right texture and warmth for a cold, rainy day. The host is friendly and hospitable and even delivered the food to my table. Today I tried the Chicken Zanny on a foraccia. It was delicious, in a different way from Jalisco though. I will definitely try other stuff from their extensive menu. Just for the record, I believe most sandwiches and wraps are $8.75 with tax, which isn't outrageous for the convenience and service you get.",1,,
17,Kris C.,"Olivette, Saint Louis, MO",11,3,0,5.0,2/23/2017,Awesome place to eat breakfast! I love the way they attend and how fresh and fast is the food and coffee! It's my favorite spot to eat breakfast close to Central Park west! And all for less than $9 dollars,,,
18,Jackie Y.,"Manhattan, NY",1,29,22,4.0,3/20/2016,"Pros: Lovely all day breakfast menu: large omelette and 16oz coffee under 9 dollars. I tend to get the Jalisco, which is excellent. Extensive options for such a small space. Lots of seating and bright Windows. Really friendly cook. Cons: no bathroom, wifi, or power outlets. Coffee isn't artisan, and I haven't tried to cappuccinos or lattes, so I can't attest for them.",,,
19,Hardeep H.,"New York, NY",380,14,8,4.0,1/2/2015,Came here for breakfast wraps! I had the egg Zanny wrap which was fairly good. I never had pesto in a breakfast sandwich which turned out to be delicious. My friend had the jalsito wrap which was REALLY delicious. Highly recommended. The house Colombian coffee was best I ever had. Only downsides are relatively small caffe and a bit over priced (the Egg Zanny wrap I had was $9!!).,1,,
20,NineEva C.,"Nolanville, TX",0,44,78,4.0,3/29/2015,My Carmel cappuccino is wonderful! I would probably come here before Starbucks for a coffee beverage. I would love to get food from here if I wasn't waiting for the restaurant across the street.,,,

23,Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",350,360,105,3.0,5/8/2013,"This place unbelievably closes at 5pm. My friend and I came in for a drink and while we were there they were getting ready to close up. Jeez!The place is cute and small, but arranged in a way that it feels like there's a lot of space. There are several tables and benches by the wall with cushions and pillows. It looks simple and sweet. It would have been nice to sit in our table and talk, but unfortunately this place closes so damn early.My friend had a Hot Chocolate, 12oz for  $2.45.I had the Vanilla Chai, 12oz for $3.50.It was a standard vanilla chai, sweet and  nice. I appreciate that the cups-to-go are well insulated and doesn't burn you (take a hint Cafe Grumpy). Need to purchase a minimum of $10 if you want to use your credit card.Decent cafe.",2,2,2
24,Katherine C.,"Manhattan, NY",294,68,33,4.0,10/5/2013,"Just moved to the neighborhood and have been on a mission to find a good local coffee place.  There are many places to get coffee around here, but not many decent coffee places, y'know what I mean?  Having to drink desperation coffee every morning on my way to school is not exactly how I want to live...But now that I've discovered Zanny's, my coffee woes are solved!  I went there on Friday around noon and ordered a big vanilla iced coffee (yum!) and a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich (yum!).  Nice to know they serve egg sandwiches all day!Another reviewer said they thought Zanny's was expensive but I thought it was quite the opposite.The people were friendly and when they found out I'd just moved to the area, took a moment out to introduce themselves and wish me well.  Very nice!I'll be back!",1,,
25,Aleh V.,"Cambridge, MA",1,25,0,1.0,11/28/2015,"Don't even try their lattes. Overheated and with bad aftertaste. The place is, probably, not better than any other random place around. Stay away unless you are fine with paying money for crappily done coffee drinks.",,,

I was part of a five person group, but they let us move around chairs so it's doable, though cramped. I had the lox bagel with cream cheese. The coffee was great.

Updated review","I went in this afternoon with $4 to my name. That limited my choices, obviously. As much as I wanted a cookie or one of their epic chocolate croissants...*drool*..., I knew I had to be a good little girl. I wanted a salad but was, unfortunately, $3 dollars short. That's when I saw ""smoothie"" on the menu! Somewhat filling, healthy, and I could afford it. Huzzah! It's a simple mix of strawberries, bananas, and blueberries mixed with ice and (in my case) soy milk. It was so good that the guy in line behind me put his Odwalla back in the fridge and asked for a smoothie instead.Two happy customers!I swear, one day, I WILL get a real meal there! A girl can not live on smoothies, chai, chocolate croissants, and Zanny's Energy Cookies alone...though, do I try? Yes. Yes I do. *sigh*",1,,1
32,Liliana C.,"Cambridge, MA",224,254,379,3.0,4/20/2014,Had a completely mediocre plain coffee here ($2 for a medium). They don't have a bathroom which I guess is normal but still annoying.,1,,

So three stars for an A-OK experience.",,,
34,Monica O.,"Philadelphia, PA",351,148,63,3.0,9/17/2011,"3.5 stars---I really had high hopes for this place. I was scouting a nice local coffee shop with free wi-fi, good coffee and food...a nice spot to get some work done and relax. However, I find out that this place has NO WI-FI and NO bathrooms :-/ Awesome food though and friendly service. I had the International sandwich w/ avocado and a side salad. Awesome balsamic vinaigrette and you can never go wrong with roasted turkey and brie.They could also have been a little more proactive about the flies that were getting inside. Otherwise, it'd be the perfect coffee shop to get some work done in.",4,,2
35,Brett W.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,45,0,4.0,12/31/2011,"This is a great local coffee shop. My girlfriend lives very close, and this is our unofficial breakfast spot. It really keeps a cozy vibe and in the summer there is a group of 20 people who bing their dogs over after a walk in the park and share coffee. This group of local dog lovers is open to other dog lovers coming to say hi. The coffee is great, and I like how they give you a cup and let you fill it yourself. I usually fill 85% with either house blend or super z and then top it off with a little hazelnut.  I also like that they have a punch card that  are just kept in a rolodex on the counter (10 ten coffees and your next one is free); it makes the shop feel authentic and home grown. One thing that knocks it down to a 4star for me is that they sometimes run out of either bagels or chive cream cheese. They do have great other options, but sometimes you get out of bed on the weekend and have your mind set on something specific... (just me?) I would definitely suggest stopping by if you live close. Become a regular and grab a card.",1,1,1
36,Alyssa S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,1,3.0,2/13/2016,I had a cafe mocha. It was good a little pricey for a medium. The chocolate was fresh and melted down so it wasn't sweet. If you like it sweet you need to add sweetener. The banana loaf cake was amazing and homemade.,,,

I just go in the morning for the breakfast special 5.10 for a toasted bagel sandwich with scramble eggs and cheese with a medium sized coffee. You can sit and read inside or outside on the benches for hours. Good non-pretentious place to read, write and chat.No wifi. Coffee is acceptable, nothing special. Dog friendly (outside only)",,,

I love having it in my neighborhood. In a New York overrun by self-styled chic cafes and corporate coffeehouses, it's a blessing to have an authentic, independent coffee and breakfast place that you can stroll to with a newspaper under your arm after rolling out of bed on a sunday morning.I won't lie- the food is good, but not spectacular, and whoever they're buying their baked goods from is similarly unenthralling (there's a great french bakery one block up columbus from them that they should consider pairing with.) But Zanny's gets four stars not just for solid enough food (their wraps especially), but for authentic atmosphere, genuinely friendly and helpful staff, and a loyal and chill cliental. Also, last but far from least, their coffee is strangely amazing. Zanny's is the kind of place every neighborhood needs- a warm and welcoming extension of your own home and a manifestation of your neighborhood's character. We would be seriously worse off without them.",,1,
53,Alexandra P.,"Westchester County, NY",28,81,313,3.0,1/19/2012,"Cozy.  Nice for weekend brunch.  Serious management issues.* The good:On weekdays it's generally pretty empty, making it a convenient local place to read/write/work (although they don't have WI-Fi so you'll need a Hotspot on your phone if you need internet for your laptop).  Espresso drinks are perfectly decent and the food is always satisfying.  Something about their balsamic dressing is peculiarly delicious.  Love their support of local artists and the general good cheer of the atmosphere.The bad:The coffee tastes like twangy dirt.  On weekdays, kids from the school across the street tumble in by the dozens from about 2:30 to 3:30, shouting and uncomfortably clogging up the already cramped space.  More than a few times, my drink has been knocked over into my lap by this tightly-packed adolescent jostling, so make sure you keep a hand on your beverage during this rush hour--the tables are dinky and a little bump crashes everything around.  Also, they close very early so the only option for a quick latte at 6pm is the Starbucks on 103rd and Broadway.*The previous manager, John, was often moody and inexplicably testy with some customers (like with my ex-boyfriend who'd elicit quirky shank eyes from him for no apparent reason), but he actually cared about the place and clearly put a lot of effort into making the whole idea work.  The location is tough--it's in kind of a dead zone that developers still don't know how to deal with--but John did well enough to keep this place floating and that was a difficult task--and one that may prove too formidable for the new manager whose even more prickly (and strangely vacant) personality is doing little to attract (and hold) customers.  As another Yelper noted, she does not recognize her customers.  We've chatted a couple of times in the past year but every time I come in, she doesn't remember me.  At first I thought she was just spacey but the consistency of her behavior makes me think that she may have some schizoid or neurological issues. Her employees don't respond well to her, either, which is never a good sign for the well-being of a business.",2,1,

The bagels were so heavy I could barely finish half I don't know if they were undercooked but I felt as of I was eating some kind of dough that didn't properly rise, also almost no cream cheese. The iced latte was horrible I took two sips and that was it. It tastes watered down and the espresso was not creamy or rich at all, it tasted like ice coffee with melted ice and skim milk not a regular iced latte. My boyfriend said his ice coffee was okay but he wouldn't go back. The seating and interior was very nice, the outdoor seating was also a plus.

57,Cindy L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,6,0,4.0,11/5/2010,"I always look forward to Friday mornings, as Zanny's has become my Friday pre-work ritual.  They open at 7am which is a huge plus for those of us who have to be at work by 8.  The staff are always friendly and pleasant.  I'm a huge fan of the house blend, though all the coffee varieties I've tried are quite good.  Baked goods are decent, though not spectacular.  I had a wrap here once too, which was delicious.My one gripe is that they close at around 5pm... I would love to go here for some late afternoon/early evening studying.Overall, this is a great neighborhood coffee shop which I will continue to frequent every Friday and would highly recommend to others!",,,
58,Manna H.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,23,4,4.0,10/21/2010,"What a life saver!!! I come by here on the mornings that I tutor at the middle school across the street and it's perfect.  Three words: all day breakfast!!!  Great varieties of coffee and pasteries! Prices are so reasonable and it's a great sit, temp spot! It's nice bc it's close to the B and D train spot without having to go all the way over to Broadway for a coffee shop!",,,
59,Franky S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,17,6,3.0,4/25/2012,"Coffee is reasonably priced and decent. No small feat in what seems to be the fairly bleak coffee wasteland of NYC. No Wi-Fi, too much dang 80s music. A few outlets available. Okay, but small breakfast items. Definitely overpriced. I got some anemic and flavorless, tiny breakfast burrito for like $8 (though, to be fair, it came with a very generous cup of coffee, included in the price, so not a total loss). All things told though, it gets the important BASIC things right. Rarely crowded. Good place to chill or meet up.One issue... owners seem pretty casual about letting people just set up whether they are paying or not. Great if that's your thing. Not great if you are running a business, or have paid the admission fee in food and beverage (me). While I was there, one, two, and ultimately six Russians turned the tiny coffee shop into their own little social club with one coffee between them all. Add their obnoxious horse laughter to the blaring Hall and Oates, and this place got old real, damn quick.One final thing... I've lived in Seattle, Portland, SF, LA and have traveled pretty widely so don't have any patience for the obscenity of NYC coffee. I usually resign myself to the defeat of Starbucks only when I am in Flyover country, some Eastern European backwater, or need fuel urgently. I have yet to go to a Starbucks in NYC yet, but I've considered it many, many times which... just depresses the hell out of me. This is pathetic, New York.A whole hell of a lot of two and three star coffee shops in this city.",,,
60,Melissa B.,Hong Kong,282,78,135,4.0,5/12/2008,"Just need to reiterate how delicious the hybrid sweet potato/pecan pie is.   Also, any sandwich that has granny smith apples get an A in my book.   I started talking to a guy from Nashville over the sweet potato/pecan pie and we're still in touch....so it could theoretically be a meeting spot?!Anyway, definitely a very friendly place, but beware...I think it's Cash only",2,1,2
61,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7750,14306,4.0,4/1/2010,"Hit up the health lunch wrap with a side salad, along with an energy cookie. All 3 items were absolutely solid, the wrap a nice mix of just that, health; the side salad did what it should with the help of a heavenly house vinaigrette; the energy cookie mixed its amalgmation of ingredients quite well. Nice service, nothing spectacular; a great addition, even if it is a bit out of place even in the gentrifying 'hood. Regardless of what you offer, though, I won't return until you stop calling me 'guy'.",,,
62,Linda H.,"New York, NY",6,34,0,5.0,4/28/2009,"I visit this place just about every weekend and everything here is tasty. It offers a relaxed atmosphere (no one will rush you out) and the staff is very friendly. The food is fresh and very tasty. ALL of their (breakfast & lunch) sandwiches, salads and drinks are amazing! My favs are 1. #3 Lox & cheese on a bagel w/the works (capers, onions, tomatoe-YUM!)2. ALL of their Sandwiches-Ive tried just about ALL of them and you won't be dissapointed3. Green Machine Salad w/Tuna Salad4. The Double O5. Energy Cookies 6. Spiced ChaiI can keep going...The only thing I was not safisfied with and I advise you to NOT order is the Cinnamon Raisin ""French Toast"" which is made with a Cinnamon raisin BAGEL. I did NOT like that and was quite surprised when I received my meal that it was a bagel w/syrup...pfftt... Funny thing is I was there this past weekend and someone ordered the same thing then when it arrived the lady was looking at her plate saying ""a bagel?! :(""Otherwise...if you're in the neighborhood definitely check this place out!!",1,,
63,Jade H.,"Flushing, NY",85,812,303,3.0,12/30/2008,"So, the first time I went into Zanny's is when I was trying to find parking and yet needed the restroom. I NEEDED it. So I pulled over and ran in and said, ""PLEASE, For I may explode."" and they opened the back up to me to use their restroom without charge or purchase or glares.The second time I went to Zanny's I had an excellent Latte made with real milk and very fresh coffee.The third time, the breakfast was over priced and not special but again the coffee was very good and the iced latte also very good.Good people work there. I love to support local neighborhood shops run by good people.",1,1,1
64,Philine V.,"New York, NY",48,183,3,5.0,2/10/2008,"Hands down, the very best Sweet Potato pie I've EVER had!!!  Seems like a really nice little neighborhood spot.  I got there around 5 pm, at which point they were cleaning up and preparing to close (they close at 6 pm).  A friend was DYING for me to try the pie, so we arranged to meet here for that purpose.  That Sweet Potato pie is a cross of sweet potato pie and pecan pie.  Truly a bite of heaven, right from the start.  Another friend came along as well, and although he didn't initially order a piece (he had a sandwich), after seeing my reaction to the first bite, ordered one for himself and very happy that he did!And the hot chocolate is fabulous as well!!!!!The staff is very friendly and charming, without hanging over you or trying to shoo you out, even at closing time.  I definitely will return!",1,1,1
65,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",325,46,2,5.0,2/12/2008,"Zanny's is THE best neighborhood cafe on the Upper-Upper West side.  It's more than a cafe; it's a local staple and weekend hang-out.  I lived right around the corner for 3 years -- and couldn't go a weekend without their great coffee, tasty breakfast wraps, or fresh salads with goat cheese.All the staff and patrons are super friendly.  And the owners, John and James, rock.I live 10 minutes away now, but love to plan my weekend jogs to end up at Zanny's.  If you live nearby, become a regular!",1,,1
66,Robert F.,"Northampton, MA",4,31,9,3.0,12/5/2009,"With the exception of the pricing, there is nothing distinctly wrong with Zanny's. Since I live nearby, I always recommend that my guests enjoy breakfast here. And they always do.Yet for some inexplicable reason, I never consider coming here on my own. I suppose it's primarily that I'm a broke student and am fully aware of more affordable, albeit less delicious, neighborhood options. Perhaps it's just that in some strange way, I always feel like you could find a most Zanny's anywhere--in Manhattan Valley, or downtown, or even in the suburbs, and that makes it kind of impersonal for me.",,,
67,Chelsea F.,"Houston, TX",9,36,4,4.0,11/11/2010,"I want to start by saying the ONE AND ONLY reason for not giving this place 5 stars which is designated ""as good as it gets!"" is that I think there should be more indoor seating for such a great place and there is definitely room for it.  Perhaps they move the outdoor seating inside when it starts to get too cold?  Otherwise, the food, coffee and service actually ARE as good as it gets.The staff is so friendly, always remember me and my orders even changing with the seasons.  They have one of those card systems where they hole punch and you get a 10th drink free - LOVE THAT!  The coffee is great quality, inexpensive and they have all the offerings that Starbucks would have (IE. all different milks you might want, etc.).  I can also comment on the food.  One day my boyfriend and I decided to split the ""International"" sandwich - fresh thick cut turkey on wheat bread with Brie and mango chutney! BRIE! CHUTNEY! wheat bread! yummm. perfect.  The fresh pastries always look inviting too.A great neighborhood spot - if you live around here you should be going here every day, if you're just in the area you should def hit it up!",,,
68,Stephen B.,"Flushing, NY",176,300,266,4.0,7/31/2010,"Love the eggs Zanny, with coffee for $7.50.  But then I tried the Tiajuana, with cheese.  Yummy.  Very good coffee.  Cool hip clientele and staff.  Good friend lives upstairs and I see him often and he's part of the community there, knows a lot of people.",,,
69,Emily B.,"Portland, ME",27,18,0,5.0,12/4/2010,"I really like this place.  The people are really nice and the place has a comfy, cozy feel to it with cushions and pillows around the bench seats.  The food is really good and they have some great homemade salad dressings!  They also allow you to squeeze behind the counter and pop in the restroom if need be, a bit of a plus for me as I like to hang out and drink a couple cups of coffee here. Also, they have breakfast foods like french toast, available all day, which is great if you have a little one who is a picky eater and only has one default-breakfast food.",,,

73,Rachel G.,"Queens, NY",61,262,5,4.0,2/17/2009,"Stopped by Zanny's the other morning for a hot chocolate and a muffin.  It's a cute place, and I would definitely come back just to hang out and read a book.  The hot chocolate was delicious - it had a faint taste of vanilla and wasn't too sweet or too bitter.  The blueberry muffin I had was good, although I'm not sure if they make them there or not.  The prices are reasonable, too.  I'm glad to have this spot in my neighborhood.",,,1
74,Leon N.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,2.0,12/28/2010,"Surprisingly good service but surprisingly bad coffee. Terrible actually. To give you a sense, I set Starbucks as my minimum benchmark for passable coffee. This fell well short of that mark. And they charge $4+ for the experience - what a joke. Someone should teach them that to make good espresso, you have to make sure you don't burn it.",1,,

I loved their spiced chai lattes and my husband loved the coffee. The eggs and bagels were great, too.
