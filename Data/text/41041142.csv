0,1,7/13/2018,674,1,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",Carina P.,382,5.0,378,Rogue bar is awesome. I arrived around 5:45 on a Friday. Wasn't tooooo packed on a Friday that you couldn't get a bar stool but was definitely full. Every stool was full by the time we left around 7. TVs were playing both sports and fail army. Food was really solid and bar food usually is pretty questionable for me. We got the pretzel and chips and guac. Pretzel was XL and looked like one you would get at a beer garden. Guac was definitely fresh and made in house.The wraps I saw come out looked great too. Will be back!,1
1,,6/15/2018,360,,"New York, NY",Asuka N.,103,3.0,1568,"I've been to Rogue a few times, largely because it's really close to where I live (virtually right across the street) and because it was the sports bar of choice for one of my good friends. It's got what you would expect of a regular watering hole in NYC - lots of TVs showing whatever sports is on, high ceilings, some outdoor seating along 6th Avenue (not the most scenic), and decent food and beer. My only comment about the beer selection is that it's a bit limited relative to what I would expect to be available, but they do make an effort to carry at least a couple beers of the regular types. As for food, it is your typical bar fare...you can tell when 'chips and guacamole' is one of the specials of the day that you're not necessarily in for the most adventurous fare. The Rogue Burger is pretty standard but tastes solid. The side salad was nice and light and not too drenched in dressing. The guacamole was properly made (i.e. fresh) but relatively unremarkable otherwise (and a bit on the small side).In short, Rogue is very much the average, prototypical sports bar. It's got a bit more space, which is nice, and the food and drinks are solid as well. If you are looking for a place that puts a bit more focus on the food aspects, or has less of a generic ambiance, there are other places that will likely be a better fit.",

The coconut shrimp was pretty good but he sauce was gross hat accompanied it, I used all the sauces from the calamari which seemed to be better. Happy hour specials are okay, loud and rowdy place to have a bite or beer after work. Nothing special. Service sucked, did I say that?",
4,,4/16/2018,66,,"Brooklyn, NY",Brandon G.,142,3.0,218,"Rouge is a casual bar with a good New York feel. All the sports games you can handle are playing and you will find your average bar food/snacks and typical drink specials. The bar is very clean and very spacious. The reason for my ""ok"" rating is because of the service. We stood at the hostess' podium for way too long, despite there not being much of a crowd and visibly empty tables we could sit at. We stayed because of the drink specials. Our waitress was also very slow in responding and it took forever to get refills on water and the drinks we ordered. I'm not sure if it was simply an ""off-night"" because aside from the service, everything else was pleasurable. Maybe they were short staffed? I just hope should I visit again they bring their A-game.",

It's a sports bar, so you shouldn't go expecting a super fancy place. But the food, for an American sports bar, was awesome. The truffle mac n cheese was top notch. The burger was good but had way too much onion, even after we took off the onions, there were some cooked within the sauce or something. The waitstaff was ok, abrupt and not the friendliest but I've stopped expecting good customer service in New York. Drinks and food were Manhattan prices, it was loud inside due the fact that we went during a soccer match, but the vibes were cool. We had a lot of fun. @eyeofshe",1

But there were a couple of guy screaming at each other around 1130pm, which created quite the nerve wrecking experience, considering we were only tables away from the scene.Other than that, the bar food was excellent. Just enough salt to make you want to drink more but the quality of the food was better than most places. The veggie burger wasn't your average Boca moosh and it was served on a delicious oat mix bun and the cod fish wasn't soggy at all. The fries were hot and crispy but not hard or soft either. I had a glass of white, German Riesling wine.. it was crisp. I'll be back!",5

We ordered a round of drinks and sat down. They said they would get in on. After we got our drinks we realized they were streaming it off Apple TV. Once it got going it was choppy the entire time and cut out almost every play. We asked for the check after watching 15 min because it was impossible to enjoy it. We got up and went to another bar. Don't give out false information or stream football games! I'm pretty sure it's not allowed anyways!,

The Cajun fries were perfect for the amazing games where underdogs came out top. The suspense, the drama and the ambience was just the right combination for a sports bar.

One of my friends have been here for happy hour so something familiar to someone is always good.Their menu is small but it has a lot of variety. Appetizers, burgers, salads, wraps, and even brunch. $5 Mimosas from 12-8 pm. Can't beat that. Service was great. The hostesses were super nice and welcoming and the waitress too. Ordered the mexican wrap naked. It was delicious. All the flavors were so pronounced. Vegetables were soft yet skin crunchy enough and the chicken was so tender. It was pretty much a mexican salad. Delicious.Would so come back.",2

19,5,2/1/2016,584,4,"Brooklyn, NY",Mary P.,2549,4.0,1502,Sports plus bar plus good food? Definitely a winner for me!It's a classic American sports bar. They have kind of comfort foods from different types of fries (Parmesan truffle?) to calamari and they even have a giant Bavarian pretzel complete with its own stand.We were big fans of the pretzel.The calamari is soft and tender and comes with a lot of different sauce options from a creamy aioli type sauce to marinara and sweet chili Thai inspired sauce. I love the condiments.That plus pretzel plus sports on lots of TVs? Yay!,6

They have a giant bar area that looks great for after-work happy hour. Service was fast and friendly. We just got drinks and it was a good bar for beer. Definitely a nice place to grab drinks if in the area...and looks like they have a patio in the summer!,1
23,,7/21/2017,73,,"Bay Shore, NY",Sara B.,25,2.0,98,"Stopped in a few days ago for lunch. Place wasn't too busy so we were seated pretty quick.First off I'd like to say the service was good, but the food was ok. The table we were sitting at was very sticky, everything stuck to it, even the salt and pepper shaker. Second, I had a fingernail stuck on the side of my glass. Yes, a little piece of fingernail that someone bit off. Not sure how it got there, but I am really hoping whoever did it, did not just chew it off and then spit it out while in the kitchen. I ordered the Rouge Greek Salad, it came with pretty much half an onion and very little dressing. I am actually pretty sure there was no dressing on it. The only thing that kept me from saying something was that I was at a business lunch and didn't want to make a big deal about it in front of clients. We also ordered the Mexican nachos and the calamari. Those were pretty good, but you could get that stuff at pretty much any bar. The staff was very nice and I did like that multiple servers asked how everything was, so they do care about their customers and I am pretty sure if I have brought up the finger nail issue and the lack of dressing they would have addressed it. Will go back and give it a second chance with friends, but will not bring clients here again. Bottom line: There are defiantly other places much better in the area, but give it a shot if you are walking past it, you are hungry and want to watch some soccer.",

I went to see fights with my friend and everything went well until we got a check with 20% tip included. We asked our sever Celia what was this about . Party of 2 , never have been charged before . Celia said that was their policy. I asked since when as we have never been charged any tips before and she called the manager Alessandro (refused to give his last name). His demeanor was horrible and very hostile. He came to our table with a nasty attitude, having his hands in the pockets and asking what was the problem. We asked since when you start include 20% tip when it is only party of 2. He said it has been always like when they show fights. Again I repeated that I have been here for at least 10 Times and have never been charged. He still insisted on LYING about it and walked away. Very disappointing as I love going to the bar with my husband and friends. Manager needs to have skills and be more approachable and understanding his customers.

Didn't stay long, but did ordered a few drinks at the bar which were fast and good. Price is your typically NYC bar.

Since we were there on a weekday, it wasn't too crowded, but also wasn't empty either.I ordered the Mac & Cheese Trio, which to my surprise was like a beer flight with three separate ramekins with a slightly differing flavor in each. By the third ramekin, my palette began to get bored of all the cheese (which is pretty unheard for me, an intense cheese fanatic); but I do have to admit it was good. There was just too much! I would probably get this again in the future but split it with someone else.Overall, chill place and would recommend for a casual catch-up/dinner with friends.

Let's start with the good: two floors of seating, plenty of TV's, friendly wait staff. All good, especially when your waitress will change channel to any program upon request. I should also give a shoutout to their happy hours that last 'til 8 and a Friday deal that gives you 5 Coronitas for $12. Very solid.Now the problems. The music was pretty loud and felt more in tune with a club than a sports bar. (The DJ wouldn't take suggestions...even though the sign said he would!) The food, on the other hand, was forgettable. The blackened burger just had too much on it - guac, chili, AND bacon - and my friends buffalo fish wrap had all the hot sauce on one side. Fries were crispy, but the portions were a little small to justify the $14 price tag for the burger.All in all, fine for watching the game, but that's it.",

We also ordered some Cajun fries which were absolutely phenomenal. The mayo with the fries was especially good.

They hella smart, so probably take heed. Here's what you should take heed of though, Rogue: your cheeseburgers suck. I don't mean to be dramatic (jk of course I do, but actually in all honesty this time) but the blackened burger I unfortunately spend $15 of my earnings on was literally one of the worst burgers I have ever had. I've had a lot of burgers. I know things. This burger was literally inedible. The bacon was about 90% gross, chewy fat, and there was a lot of it; can't really go wrong with classic cheddar; but the meat itself? Literally oh my god I don't even know how to describe how unpleasant and uncomfortable it made me. It was just....bad. Real bad. How do you fuck up a cheeseburger!!??I also had an absolut mule (aka a Moscow mule but with dumb branding). It was really meh. Service was okay. It was real busy, but we were in the second floor section which was pretty tiny. Basically, this place is awesome for packs of bros who don't care about great drinks or service as long as they get a giant pile of wings and beer to watch the game on the admittedly awesome giant flatscreens around the place.",1

I've done all three.The food  is your typical bar food kicked up 3 notches.  You can get hot wings with truffle Mac & cheese...win-win!  The different variations of fries (especially the Cajun) are a hit!   If you're in the mood for a burger, they have a few that will knock your socks off and I'm typically not a burger eating type of girl. The blackened burger...OH YEAH!!!! It had chili, cheese, bacon and guacamole....c'mon now.  Amazing-ness on nice plates ;-) you want something light & tasty they have a spinach chicken quesadilla that is full of flavor.  It all comes down to me never being disappointed with the food.   I can't really speak much on the drinks.  I'm a beer girl or if I want a nice stiff drink, I go for a Jameson on the rocks.  Not a huge fan of the cutesy, typically pricey mixed drinks. The atmosphere is always chill. You can watch a game on the flat screens, listen to the live DJ (certain nights) or just kick back with friends over good food. Rogue is always a damn good time!!",3

Updated review",2673,2,"Queens, NY",Jando S.,16559,4.0,3522,"It's been more than a few years and dozens of visits later, Rogue has become a better venue and operates on a much more efficient level. It's not perfect (perfection is relative) but it's much better place than when I first came here. Regardless of the venue, It's always nice to see improvements come into fruition.The place has embraced it's sports bar role and does a good job of showing a variety of relevant games. I've watched everything from top 10 college football matchups to the World Series to NFL and NBA action here, the TVs are brightly lit and are generally very easy to watch from most spots in the place. I just wish they had more game audio.Service has been pleasant. Gone are the meatheaded bouncers and a more robust waitstaff and hostesses with good phone manners. Snagging a spot at the bar is always a good time, especially since the bartenders are good people and are fairly heavy handed when it comes to the pours. The crowd doesn't seem too crazy anymore for some reason, even on the weekends the flow is fairly easy.The pseudo casualty has been the food. My beloved Irish Nachos have shrunken in comparison and risen in price, despite the fewer sprinkles of bacon and less than abundant helpings of the cheeses. I still order it most of the time, but it is lacking the punch it used to have. And it's gone up from $7 to $10. Yikes.As for the rest of the food, the Rogue burger isn't a bad choice. I've had mixed results with the meat, but have had more favorable results with their black burger ($14). The meatloaf ($14) isn't bad but it can be dry at times. When it comes to their infamous fish and chips, all I can say is I can  think of better ways to spend my money ($15). I still haven't tried their brunch yet, that will come another day.Rogue is still a sports bar through and through. Don't get too fancy and order steak from their kitchen, but highly recommend is a sharing session with their appetizers. Watch the game, eat some calamari and perhaps give those sliders a shot as well as the Irish *and* Mexican nachos.",6
67,,1/20/2017,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",K W.,21,5.0,72,A bit loud but great spot!Food and drinks came out really quick. I came here for happy hour but excited to try it out for lunch one day since they have such fast service.,
68,1,8/29/2015,340,,"Woodside, NY",Allessandra C.,147,3.0,127,"I actually didn't have super high hopes especially since this brands itself as a 'high quality sports bar' but was pleasantly surprised.This place was pretty packed when I arrived, but then again it was Happy Hour (around 7pm) on a Thursday so that's to be expected. But word to the wise if you are trying to go there around that time make sure to stake out a place to sit quick.I ordered White Wine, Shrimp with Chipotle Mayo Sauce on Skewers, and their Salmon in Lemon Sauce with Mushrooms, Leeks, Red Peppers and Potatoes. My friend ordered their Coconut Shrimp with Curry Mayo Dipping Sauce.The food was actually really really good! Nothing was overdone, over-seasoned or under-seasoned. The seafood (since thats all that I and my friend had) was all fresh and tasted great! I was actually impressed given that I didn't think this place would be too much better than taking a frozen pack of whatever and throwing it in the fryer. Also the Coconut Shrimp had just the right amount of sweetness and the Shrimps were big. Engouh to fill you up or whet your appetite. The wine was also really lovely (I had the Chardonny), a perfect compliment to the food very fresh.  Also, they have outdoor seating, indoor and a small upstair seating. Perfect place to go to after work to meet with friends or even a first date.",

72,,6/11/2014,301,,"Hoboken, NJ",Nicole C.,302,4.0,263,Met a group of 4 here for dinner at 6PM on a Tuesday. Getting a table wasn't a problem at all. The hostess seated us right away and left us with menus. Our waitress took our drink orders prior to the other 2 people arriving and that was greatly appreciated as it was most certainly wine o'clock. Their glasses of wine are a bit pricey but they do have a decent selection. I got the turkey burger with a side of a salad (which was the size of a whole salad!) and it was decent. My boyfriend got the Mexican wrap which he also devoured. I think this place is definitely more of a game day venue versus meeting for dinner venue but the food is decent and I would definitely like to go back when the next Penn State game is on!,
73,,10/11/2015,169,,"Brooklyn, NY",Margo I.,14,3.0,56,"Food is subpar. I do like the atmosphere though.. Good to watch a game, also has outside seating. I wasn't so thrilled about the fact that I ordered dinner and then when I asked for a dessert menu they told me the kitchen just closed- a heads up would be nice !",
74,,8/19/2015,412,,"Queens, NY",Tamar O.,123,4.0,179,Randomly came in here for a night cap. The bar was pretty empty so we had a seat at the end of the bar. The bartender was super cool and friendly; took our orders and talked with us for a while until it was time to close up shop. I'd possibly go back for drinks on another night if I'm in that neighborhood.,
75,1,7/9/2013,769,3,"Jersey City, NJ",Bloss C.,2521,4.0,1081,"Date night at Rogue is a good idea if your idea of date night is watching the Pay Per View UFC fight together.  Although not purchasing the fight at home for $60 is definitely winning, there is a $25 per person minimum during UFC fights, so you're still paying about the same but are getting bar food and beer thrown in for the same price as just watching at home.  This bar is kind of schizophrenic with the tvs, but I have to say, if you are there to watch sports, it works.  My biggest tip would be to make a reservation if you want to watch UFC there.  We came as a walk in and got the last table available, about 2 hours before the fight started.  We were seated on the third floor balcony which was kind of dark and secluded and had our own personal flat screen tv about 5 feet from our table; definitely a great spot to have a more intimate UFC watching experience.",3

77,,1/18/2014,29,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Katrina S.,4,3.0,284,"So many of the reviews here say this is a casual, laid-back place -- I'd say it's a tad upscale. I was wearing a nice sweater and colored jeans and felt underdressed.Happy hour seems like the right time to come. $9 for a margarita at lunchtime was much more than I had expected. It *was* tasty, but it would've been tastier a few dollars cheaper. Knowing that, you may as well go for one of their specialty cocktails that you couldn't get someplace else.Tasted a couple of my friend's fries and they were mighty good. Not McDonald's good, but we can't all be perfect.",
78,,10/10/2013,497,,"New York, NY",Eric J.,1710,3.0,923,"Decent bar with decent food. My only experience has been on Sunday for NFL games. My friends who are Giants fans swear by this place for some odd reason. I like that the waitresses actually do wear their own team colors and apparel from where they are from and not just generic Giants/Jets. That being said, the food is only okay. My friends and I were smelling a delicious, rich garlic smell that just permeated the entire bar and asked the waitress what that smell was and which menu item we could order so that we could partake. She responded by saying ""Yeah, that's the 99 cent pizza place next door."" We stared at her in disbelief. We then promptly headed to the 99 cent pizza place next door and realized she was telling the truth. So sad. That being said, we got a couple slices at the pizza place, paid for our drinks at Rogue and left. The pizza was delicious and garlicky, just like the smell.So while I can't really say that the food at Rogue is bad, the 99 cent pizza place mext door might pique your interest more than the basic bar food that Rogue offers.",1

Lite beers and the Mexican wrap, please! If I get a rogue wave I will loosen up the belt a notch and order the shepherds pie.

84,,9/23/2016,69,,"Hartsdale, NY",Michael H.,0,1.0,6,I'd give a 0 star if I could. Came in for drinks with my family there was 6 of us. Was told to sit at a table we said we would order from the bar and was told that the tables are for table service we had 4 rounds of drinks and the bill came to 200 dollars because they made us pay 30 dollars service fee. If the service was any good it maybe will be worth it and you think we'll get a smile or two from the wait staff. Never again will I come to this place. They are crooks.,
85,1,1/23/2013,1419,1,"Gaithersburg, MD",Benjamin M.,293,3.0,752,"Rogue is a decent sports bar, which was perfect for watching some playoff football. The entire place was understandably busy, so getting a table or stool was impossible. No problem, as I resorted to standing room near the bar with my Cappuccino stout since they had plenty of TVs showing the game.I was happy to see some decent beer selections, including a nice variety of $4 pumpkin beer bottles left over from the Fall. Great beer always goes down better when it's inexpensive, so I voluntarily stepped up to help the cause of reducing their inventory. I didn't try any of the food, but would consider coming back here again to do so.",3

I highly recommend the 3 cheese mac appetizer. As for drinks, the martinis are not great, stick to beer or straight liquor at this place. I really like that they have daily drink specials and on occasion shots are on the special of the day list. It tends to get noisy because it is a sports bar but it's a great place to grab a drink with friends after work. The service is great and the vibe is cool.",2

Came here a few times for some after work drinks, a very basic sports bar in Manhattan.The one issue is it can get extremely crowded. The space to walk around is very narrow in general, so if it happens to be packed that night, you can forget about being able to move around the bar. They have a decent rum selection, but certainly nothing high end or stand out-ish. The same goes for other liquors as well. On one occasion I got an order of wings and they were pretty decent as far as bar food goes. Overall this place is a just a decent sports bar. If you want something better, with more space and better liquor, I would head over to the Ainsworth on 26th street.",1

Fries were seasoned really well; nachos had almost no chips and were mostly delicious toppings; my steak sandwich was cooked as I asked - medium rare!; and overall it delivered what we wanted (sports on TVs!)",1

Couldn't do much for me from a recommendation standpoint. It's a sports bar (according to the reviews I read) so I guess I shouldn't have expected much?Decided on the seared tuna salad. Glad I did. It was great (yummy), served it's purpose (bc it was filling and I was starving), and it was healthy (even though this is a sports bar). The salad earned them an extra star. It took excessively long for water with lemons?...which was def on purpose (pretty sure)...the waitress can def kick rocks. I'd come back but only if already in this area.

I always get their salads as I can customize it the way I like and their Cobb salad is amazing too. The portions are not small but not too big either so you leave there feeling pleasantly full but not stuffed.

93,,1/17/2015,707,,"New Orleans, LA",Danielle K.,98,5.0,189,I've been waiting to give a review of this place because I love it so much. It's like my home away from home. I had my 23rd birthday here and they blocked off the balcony and did an amazing job. Many of the servers are my friends - very talented artists in drama and literature. The drinks are expensive but it's because they are crafted perfectly. They have great specials every day. It's the $5 mimosa and blood Mary Saturday special that got me hooked on this place two years ago. I come here for food (tuna BLT is a must) and drinks in groups and with one other person. The bartenders put a lot of effort into the seasonal menus so try them at least once. Sometimes at night they will put a large screen down and play music videos. I couldn't ask for a better atmosphere. :),
94,,7/25/2015,1,,"Brooklyn, NY",Bryan A.,0,1.0,6,"I came here for happy hour with a date last week. Service was beyond terrible. The initial waitress fumbled with my drink order three times and kept thinking I was ordering bourbon when I was ordering a rum. I clearly told her what I wanted was a dark rum. She responded be bringing me a bourbon menu. When I asked her if the only hard liquor that the bar had was bourbon  she told ""well that's what most people order"" Ordered the sliders cooked rare and asked for the truffle parmesan fries instead of regular (menu stated they could be substituted for an extra fee). When I received my order, the sliders were well done and she had brought me a second order of fries. I should have complained then and there but I was hungry and not in the mood for an argument so I decided to hold my tongue. It gets better. There was a shift change during the meal and we got a second waitress. Without mentioning that she was our new server she asked if we needed anything. At that time we were ok and told her we didn't need anything. A little while later my date wanted another drink and we tried to get her attention but she was blatantly ignoring us. After about 20 minutes we decided to close out and move on. Unfortunately our server was nowhere to be seen. After some more waiting my date went to the hostess and asked for the check. The hostess inquired why she didn't ask our server. Naturally we mentioned that we could not get her attention. When the server finally showed up she argued (yes, argued) with my date insisting that she had approached us several times and we had ignored her. The then took the check and threw it on my table. When I went to pay the hostess and the server were making derogatory comments about my date right in front of me while I was paying the bill. I normally don't write reviews, let alone bad ones but I couldn't stay quiet. Overall the food was mediocre maybe 3 stars at best but the service was disgusting.  If I could give negative stars I would. Never going back to that place again.

I love when people do their jobs, but do it so well you don't realize they are actually working.Since we were occupying a table for 4 (it was just the 2 of us), I really liked the fact that we weren't be rushed considering that it's Friday and happy hour was in full swing.  That may have to do with the fact that it wasn't too crowded (so no bumpin' into folks or getting a drink spilled on me...so yay to that).I ordered a watermelon martini (and then another one after that...) and the sliders--let me just say I enjoyed those darn sliders and the Cajun fries--heaven.  It's certainly a nice spot to kick back, link up with friends, enjoy some drinks, and grab a bite.  Good times!",4

Because it wasn't mixed (all ingredients came in small piles across te plate), first didn't try the avocado (it's my fave and I was saving it). When I finally took a bite, I quite literally couldn't. It was rock hard. The waitress came to ask if everything was ok and I asked to speak to the manager about my avocado situation (usually I'm not that snobby - but it was the avocado!). He came over, only to instantly start accusing me of not sending back my salad right away. He said he couldn't take it off the check, but only get me something else. I asked for a drink. He scoffed at me and refused. When I got argumentative he GRABBED MY SHOULDER. I protested and he left. Verdict: typical NYC tourist spot that couldn't care less about quality food/service. Boo!",4

Chicken wings and chicken fingers. Birth came out quick and both were tasty. What I really liked about this place was the bartender. Chris was awesome. He told us what was good in the area. Thing to order. Kept out drinks full as needed. All around a good dude. So much so that we came back later that night for dinner. Came back with the rest of the team for dinner.

It was so freaking loud we couldn't hear each other so conversation was kept to a minimum. The waitresses all appeared to be Eastern European and pretty much badgered us into ordering more than we wanted.One good thing: the $6.00 happy hour margaritas were damned strong.They need a wider selection of beer to keep the boys happy.

The space is pretty big compared to a lot of bars in the city, with nice high ceilings so I didn't feel cramped. As expected, the bar was only moderately full so we were seated right away. The happy hour specials were pretty generic ($4 beer, $5 house wine) so I opted for 2 of their more premium cocktails: an Autumn Pear Martini & a Moscow Mule. Though I'm not the type to shell out more than $10 for a cocktail, at $12 a pop The Autumn Pear was totally worth it. Grey Goose, pumpkin puree & cinnamon made it the perfect seasonal drink & totally hit the spot. The Moscow Mule ($9), though large,  was a little disappointing. The flavors just weren't there but it was nice & strong.For eats, we split the mac & cheese trio & cajun fries, both of which were really delicious. The mac trio comes with a cheddar, gouda & truffle mac & cheese. Truffle was (obviously) the favored of the three but all were very good. And the cajun fries were well-seasoned and served with a tasty spicy mayo.

Toppings include cheese, bacon, guacamole, and chili - YIKES! (plus the typical lettuce, tomato, onion garnish). The first thing I recommend is to ask for everything on the side except the chili, cheddar cheese, and bacon. From there I usually use the guacamole as a French Fry dip and I don't use the lettuce, tomato, or onions.

To start we got their version of Irish Nachos which are sliced potatoes covered in cheese, ranch, bacon and scallions. WOW. So delish. The other was the chicken spinach quesidilla--another amazing amazing dish. Now on to the disappointment--Luckily, we only ordered one sandwich to share since we got the apps and neither of us touched it! We got a steak sandwich--usually a fave of mine. It was gummy, had no taste and just did not in any way compare to the apps we started with.

Waiter came and asked us for drink orders right away, but then didn't know much about the beers.  We got our drinks and ordered the guac and chips special and an order of sliders each.  Granted, the guac special was only $5 but the guac was served in one of those little metal containers that you put ketchup for fries in.  It was seriously small, even for $5.  But it wasn't bad.Sliders had a lot of bread...made me think ""Where's the beef?"" but they were tasty and the grilled onions were great.  Plus, they were served with fries for $11 so I thought they were a good deal.  I couldn't even finish my third one.  Service was attentive and nice, drink re-orders were offered and water refilled a lot (I was thirsty so that was great).  Overall, a decent if not particularly memorable meal.  Perfect if you need a place close to the location and aren't too choosy.Going back for drinks with 7 people was okay.  There was room at the bar for all of us.  Bartender was okay.  When we asked about the beer of the month (because we'd been sitting under a big poster advertising it at dinner), he said it was a different beer than was advertised.  When I pointed to the giant poster, he said they must not have it yet.   Maybe not the bartender's fault but if you're going to advertise something, at least let the staff know so they don't tell paying customers that they are wrong.   Stayed for two rounds of drinks and had a nice time.  Room was loud but not so loud you couldn't talk.  I like the high ceilings and the bathroom was really clean.This is a place I'd have no problem recommending to someone who was looking for a quick, decent meal or drink.",1

The crowd is young so you can expect what comes with twentysomethings. It's very dimly lit too so that doesn't help. Good for sports but when sports are not on be prepared for lots of old music videos and a bad dj that plays them. They really need to toss that guy. It gets REALLY noisy here so make sure you are ok with that too. Wait staff is very attentive. Bartenders are hit and miss. When they are miss they miss big though. You could wait a half hour to get a drink with 10 people in the whole bar. If the bartender is good you will have it immediately and he will give you some good conversation and buybacks while he's there. VERY hit and miss.This is a Stony Brook bar so if you are a USB alum you will always be able to catch the games here in the event they are not nationally televised.

I personally got the fajita wrap and it was delicious if not just a little soggy and difficult to eat. They give you ketchup and a nice little cheese sauce with a kick to dip your fries in. They also give you an option to have fries or salad as your side which is fabbb and I always hate that more places don't give you that option without you having to ask for changes. The service however, ehh. Don't know if our server was new but she had no idea what the beer was that we ordered (Hell or High Watermelon) that was on the menu. Their beer list is not terribly large nor did it have many craft beers with such a unique name so I found it a little ridiculous she didn't know it. So she then returned to our table to ask again what we ordered because she looked confused. I showed it to her on the menu and she was like oooohhh and then walked away, came back and told us they didn't have it anymore. Alright, no problem. Good beers go out of stock.

Anybody who knows me knows that me and sports go together like Lamb and Tuna Fish. The restaurant website makes it look like any other bar which has high ceilings and is covered wall-to-wall with flat screens. But I had another reason for coming out to Rogue, an ulterior motive if you will.A few weeks prior to my chance outing to Rogue fellow Yelper, Digant D., told me that he had put up an ad as he was looking for a new roommate. Who ends up checking out his place? No other than Paula ""Walnuts"" Meronek from Real World: Key West (not to mention The Duel, The Inferno 3, The Gauntlet III, The Island, The Duel II, Fresh Meat II, Cutthroat, Rivals, and Battle of the Exes). So when she is looking over his place she mentions to him that she bartends at Rogue a few nights a week and that he should stop by some time. Flash forward back to the present day. So before agreeing to go there I decided to check the place out on Yelp to find out what kind of vibe I was in for. After reading Jane K's review I realized that I was heading to the same bar which he had told me about and stood a chance of meeting Paula of MTV fame.So when we get to the bar and our waitress is taking our drink order, trying in the most discrete manner as possible, I asked her if Paula was working that day. She tells me that she'd have to find out. When returned with our drink order, it was with a heavy heart that she informed me that Paula would NOT be working that day. After all of that anticipation, it was a major let down!To drown my sorrows I ordered the Rogue's Wings served with their Hot wing sauce. The wings were juicy, yet cooked well and firm. The sauce was hot and tangy. Before I knew it my plate was almost empty and I was calling the waitress over to order another order of the Hot Wings and also an order of the Honey BBQ too. I reckon that was some kind of foosball was playing on those TVs, but I was so busy working on the wings that I didn't care.Sorry we missed Paula this time around, but with the quality of those wings I am more than willing to come back and try my luck again.",4

The food is decent - we started with guacamole and chips, which was really good. We then moved on to lunch and I had the tuna BLT which I did not like. I don't think anything was wrong with the sandwich per say, I think it was just not my taste. If you like rare tuna, then you will love it, but I was lead to believe that it was cooked somewhat, which it wasn't. One of my friends had the spinach and chicken quesadilla, which was delicious! Wish I had that instead.The only other thing I have to say, is that the staff there, although they are nice, they are not attentive. We tried about 5 times to get our waitress's attention to tell her about my sandwich, but it was not happening. She was too busy talking to her co-workers, so I ended up taking off the tuna and just eating the BLT. By the time she came over to us, everyone was done eating. She did offer to get something else for me, but by that time it was too late. At least she took the sandwich off the bill.",1

I also thought it strange that the waitresses took our orders but a bus boy was the one who delivered the food. I thought it strange for the appetizer, and then it happened again for the main.The appetizer we had was Mac & Cheese.  It's like a flight of Mac & Cheese. Three ramekins each with a different type of mac & cheese. One was cheddar & bacon, one was gouda and one was with black truffle oil. The truffle oil one was my favorite.  This was really a lot of food for an appy and well worth it. Nice crusty tops on each.The main I had was the brunch item Huevos Rancheros, which was supposed to have spicy avocado sauce but it wasn't at all spicy and was really a melange of sour cream and avocado sauce. The main was just so-so.",1

I've only been on Sunday nights since I take dance class then around the corner and always have a healthy appetite afterwards. They have a self-important bouncer checking IDs. He acted like he was manning the door at 1 Oak or something. Made a crack about my Jersey ID.... ahh clever fella. The hostesses give attitude too. The waitresses are nice girls, just a little slow. They will never write anything down then without fail always come back to ask what we ordered. Last time I came it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. The waitress totally made the ""crap I forgot about you"" face when she walked past us. After a little flirting with the bartender she finally brought the drinks over.The food has always been great compared to your average bar cuisine. I especially like the turkey burger. It comes with a nice herb mayo sauce. The fries are good too and they even have sweet potato ones! The TVs are everywhere and they crank the sound up at game time if you're into that sort of thing. Two other things that annoyed me about my visits here... They add 20% gratuity to all bills during games without even telling you. Oddly enough this only happened to me once. Maybe I was swindled that one time.... Also, one time I came with a friend and we wanted to split the check. They charged her half the bill and me for the entire check amount. So we paid 50% more. Pretty impressive since to my recollection from my time as a waitress when you ran one card through only the balance would be left and not some made up number!There are many annoyances but the solid food, large drink menu and location keep me coming back.

155,,11/25/2014,0,,"Washington, DC",J R.,1,1.0,14,"I ate at Rogue last year with some friends visiting from overseas. A year later, the experience I had at Rogue still comes to mind occasionally, as one of the strangest restaurant experiences I've ever had.We had searched for about 15 minutes for a decent restaurant to eat at. We stumbled upon Rogue, and the person working the door, a man in his late 30s to early 40s with a Spanish accent that appeared to be an assistant manager, was extremely rude to our group. They carded us, which is to be expected. But when he saw a bag I was carrying from Duane Reade, which contained a bottle of water and cold medicine, he asked to see what was inside of the bag. I said ""sure."" Normally, at this point I would have said ""No"" and refused to give the restaurant my business, but we were hungry and I didn't want to cause and problems for my group. When I handed him the bag, he pulled out the water bottle inside. He said ""what's this."" I said ""water"" which it was. He then asked to open the bottle, I again complied, and then he stuck his nose over the bottle and sniffed it. When it clearly smelled of nothing, because it was water, he passed the bag back to me and let us in. I honestly wish I had called the restaurant the day after it happened, because this was some seriously strange and uncalled for behavior. It's pretty disgusting and classless for someone to put their nose over an open drink container! If your restaurant has a problem with potential customers bringing in outside alcohol, simply say to those potential customers ""sorry, we don't allow outside beverages."" Very simple. Hopefully the management at this restaurant has changed. Additionally, the food was very subpar. The food was similar to bar or pub food, and overpriced. The service from the waiter was polite, however, they only had one person serving food in the entire restaurant, which was fairly busy at the time.I won't be returning needless to say.",1

192,6,8/29/2008,807,1,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",Melody L.,1072,5.0,316,"I'd like to describe this place using the words of Napoleon Dynamite. ""Tina, you fat lard! Come get some dinner!"" Wait, not those words. This one: ""Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.""When I lived in NYC, Rogue was one of my favorite spots to grub, sip on bevvies and chat with the cool bar staff. One in particular. Ladies, you know who I'm talking about. Actually, the entire staff is pretty cool, whether it be the attentive waitresses, or Randy pumping the volume on the one's and two's. Show up on a Wednesday or Friday when he spins music to old school music videos. Old school as in Ice Cube, Kris Kross, Salt-n-Pepa, Big Daddy Kane, and L.L. Cool J. Elido who works the door is super cool too and even did a do-si-do with my girl who was in town visiting from Texas. Grrrreat moves.This is where it's at on game nights. They have better than pub grub, and also have many flat screens to watch your team. I was in there for an ultimate fighting match (please don't ask) and it was full of peeps. My girl from Paris even found a haas to kiss at the end of the night. (Secret's out!) Some insider tips:The menu is good, but these items were our faves:Irish Nachos (Worth the 15 pounds you will gain.)Turkey ClubChicken FingersMexican WrapHappy hours are from 5-8pm and daily specials include:Mondays: $5 house wine, $3 domesticsTuesdays: $3 Coors Light, $4 house mixed drinks, Karaoke from 8pm-12am?

Thas alotta days.I recommend Rogue to anyone looking for a laid back, but fun place to meet up with friends. I personally think that Thursdays - Sundays are their best nights. But hey, that's just me. ;)",8
193,4,6/22/2008,5000,4,"Houston, TX",Farrah A.,6485,5.0,1754,"What I like about this place:- Spacious, tall ceilings, modern-esque pub look- It's not really a video-lounge, but the DJ here plays the best videos/music ... better than other places who've attempted this. I shoulda asked the DJ for a cd/dvd. - Bartender Alfredo is quick and makes them drinks good. Good good good good good. - Yeah, the two days I went were rather empty. But it's one of those places where so long as you have your friends, great music and bevs, you'll make your own party if you have to.- Fun door guy. I taught him how to do-si-do and promenade.",6
194,,4/7/2011,127,,"Brooklyn, NY",Alisa G.,2,3.0,19,"Sports bar? Check.An array of TVs in various sizes but not shapes? Check.Cheap alcohol and plenty of decently priced apps? Check.Decor? Better than an average bar.What else do you need? The bartender was cool and pleasant. He paid attention when needed and left us alone when needed. The crowd was the crowd, but got more mixed toward the end of the night. The DJ was playing Euro house on a Thu night which depending on how many drinks you had could be good or bad. After about 11pm, he played more urban tunes that magically matched with the videos on some of the TVs. When it rains outside and you're in a need of a drink and the place doesn't need to be fancy, this is your spot.",1
195,,3/15/2014,19,,"Manhattan, NY",Gireesh R.,0,4.0,2,Great place to chill back and watch a game with some of your friends! The food was excellent.,
196,,11/18/2011,135,,"Los Angeles, CA",Ben R.,62,4.0,204,"Decent sports bar, above average tasting food & drinks.5 of us stopped by here on a Thursday afternoon to get a late lunch, drinks, and to catch up. The drinks were creative, if small. The food was good, although again not huge portions. I had the blackened burger and was not disappointed. Service was also quite good for us.The pop music in the background seemed out of place, but it was quiet enough not to be annoying.",
197,,11/5/2013,130,,"Abingdon, MD",Jasmine D.,28,3.0,43,"The food was ok, nothing to write home about. I had the create your own omelet. It was ok, seemed to be missing something and the breakfast potatoes were not crispy like how I like them. The meal wasn't really filling so I winded up ordering a cheesecake after. That was great! I didn't plan on eating the whole thing but couldn't help myself. We were there on a Sunday so they had plenty of football games on. Every TV was playing a different game so I'm sure there was a game for everyone. Seems like a good place to watch football.",
198,,3/27/2011,13,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ryne D.,4,3.0,30,"This place  was MADE for the 3 star rating because there's nothing wrong OR exciting about it. It is an entirely average sports bar. The drink specials are not particularly good; the 10$ bucket consists of 5 mini beers which equals about 2 1/2 beers. Drink prices are standard. The bar does have a good layout to watch sporting events, lots of screens placed at every conceivable angle. Clean, somewhat classy looking for a sports bar.",1
199,,4/14/2014,11,,"Logan Square, Chicago, IL",Morgan M.,8,2.0,16,"Not at all what I expect when I think NY food or service. If you're long on time (and patience), and don't mind seeing your server every blue moon... Then by all means, sit and have a mediocre meal.  Wish I could say that the place was packed... It wasn't.",
