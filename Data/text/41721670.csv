I'd say menu has their own personality. It's a good lunch spot when you feel for more healthier option. Be aware of a long line but you will find your table. Order online before you go.",1,,
1,Gary G.,"New York, NY",4,16,0,1.0,11/14/2018,"I've never had to do this, but the general manager here went above and beyond the call of duty to rise to level of ""worst customer service employee of the century.""I went to pick up my to go order, and I was already a few minutes late. When I arrived, the very friendly clerk said it wasn't quite ready. I went to the back to see if it was being prepared, and that's when things really went off the rails. The person holding tickets immediately said ""you can't be back here."" I was literally in front of no other customer, and simply asked if she knew when my order would be ready. At that point, she literally accused me of ""harassment"". I had only said two sentences, both perfectly reasonable and polite. I have no idea what happened to Sam that day, but she needs to do some basic training on how to deal with a totally mundane customer interaction. How she rose to level of manager of this very busy and successful lunch spot is insane. That's all.",,,

It was supposed to come with a chicken leg but by the time I came they had run out and I got the braised chicken instead. I really enjoyed the chicken and since they waited for me to come in to ask what meat I wanted to sub the plate was freshly prepared right in front of me. The food tasted pretty good and the portion was quite large. I wish they had more variety with the meal pal options but I'll have to try it on my own some time.",2,,

5,Melody L.,"Washington, DC",11,180,382,4.0,7/22/2018,"M&V is no doubt on the expensive side, but the food is fresh, healthy, and delicious. I never get tired of eating here because there are so many different options and the quality and taste is always consistent. One week I actually came here 3 out of 5 days for lunch!There is plenty of seating inside, including an entire upper level with its own tables and counter for napkins/utensils/trash/trays. There is almost always a line during lunch, but the staff hustle to make the line move speedily. I find that the bowl is too much food for me, so I typically get the plate (two vegetable sides, protein, brown rice or vegan mash). The chicken breast is huge but was a tiny bit undercooked the one time I had it. I usually stick with the tofu or braised chicken. Just a note that sometimes when scooping the braised chicken, all of the water and juices come with it so it kind of drenches the other food on the eat-in reusable plate. I mistakenly thought they overcharged me so I emailed them through their website. The manager responded within hours apologizing and offering me a refund in addition to asking some clarification questions. Those questions actually made me realize I wasn't overcharged, so obviously I felt embarrassed and just could not accept the refund. But that was an amazing demonstration of wonderful customer service!",2,,
6,Lisa H.,"NY, NY",473,54,176,5.0,3/20/2018,"Picked up Mealpal for lunch - MV Roasted chicken thigh with brown rice, cauliflower and Thai glass noodles. The place is very cute with friendly staff and mealpal lunch was ready at the specified time. I was surprised at the portions of the meal as it was a legit full meal and the largest I've seen compared to other mealpal lunches from other places. Big plus! The chicken was raised antibiotics free and full of flavor. The rosemary adds to the depth of flavor and the chicken was tender. The cauliflower was very refreshing and a nice kick of lemon. This was a very delicious side and paired well with the roasted chicken. The glass noodles were light and full of flavor and a nice change of texture too. I enjoyed this lunch very much and would order it again. It was healthy, full of flavor and filling. Highly recommend.",1,1,2
7,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",135,110,275,5.0,9/24/2018,"This review is strictly off of a Mealpal order. My experience was as easy and painless as it gets. I ordered their chicken over brown rice with a side of kale salad and watermelon salad. The chicken was seasoned and cooked very well, not dry at all. The kale salad with apple slices was good but the watermelon salad with jalapeno and cilantro really stole the show, it had the person sweetness to it and really complimented the salt on the chicken. I'd highly recommend this place for some quick yet healthy grub. The portions were perfect, not too much, not too little, literally just enough. Oh and the staff was friendly and had the order all ready by pick up time.",1,1,1

I do find it a little odd that I can't find the nutritional facts for a place that boasts about being healthy, gluten free and vegan. FOOD: The food options are all healthy so if that's not your vibe don't come here. The food was tasty and mine was a little spicy (I ordered the tofu chili). The portions are a little on the smaller side for how much they charge you... VIBES/SERVICE: Quick service there was no line when I went. The inside is cute and trendy with tons of seating. I would give this a 3.5 not a full 4.... I am a bigger fan of dig inn",1,1,1

It was the perfect lunch and way more than enough. I even got a to-go box to have the rest later. I also got the ginger lemonade ($4.00) which I think was worth the price. It was so refreshing.

There is also a lovely upstairs area with more tables for a quieter vibe. The decor here is bright and vibrant, just like the food they serve. You can order food in a few different ways here. I was pretty confused when the server first explained the options to me. I wish the layout was a little simpler like a sweet green where you move down the line and the servers tell you how many veggies, proteins, Extras you can choose. Maybe I just didn't have the best server for this. I also noticed there is no sparkling water served here. M&V does have a nice selection of juices, flavored waters and even some beers and wines. They also have a bunch of yummy sweet treats. Overall a lovely experience and delicious foods. Would love to have a simpler explanation to first time visitors on the plate and bowl options.",1,1,1

I had the chili verde with the Brussels/Fennel/ date salad, and kale and black beans over spinach with poblano lime sauce and the super seed crunch. Â No base because trying to cut down on carbs and they only offer rice or the vegan mash which is potatoes, and the chili already has sweet potatoes, beans andhominy. Â  I wish they offered a low carb base option such as sautÃ©ed greens. Â The dish was very tasty and delicious. Â I also had a side of the tomato,cucumber, feta and mint salad.

They were completely cold, not cold as in ""oh i left them laying around and now they're room temperature"". No, cold as if they were just taken out of a freezer.

Updated review","After a few months of not visiting this place, I invited my coworker to grab a quick lunch last week. The line was surprisingly shorter than before. I got my usual, which included charred avocado, Thai chili noodles, and roasted Brussel sprouts. There was a $1 extra for the charred avocado, which wasn't there before. It still worthed it. The pumpkin seeds and greek yogurt puree added the extra bite into the creamy and smooth avocado. Thai chili noodles were sour and salty but it wasn't spicy at all. Roasted Brussels were well balanced. It was pretty good overall.",1,,1
23,Elliott W.,"San Francisco, CA",355,364,152,4.0,6/5/2017,"YUM! Another awesome healthy place that makes vegetables fun and tasty and exciting.The way this place works is pretty simple. There are a ton of hot veggie options and cold veggie options- you pick two, and then you pick a protein to go with it. You can also do an all veggie box-The veggies are all what I would call ""exciting"" so if you're the type that wants plain kale with dressing on the side this isn't the place for you. I opted for the miso peanut butter cauliflower (roasted cauliflower with a light sauce on top) as well as the black bean, lime and kale salad.For my protein I opted for their turkey chili, which gets served on top of their root mash. It was all awesome- the boy opted for the salmon as his protein (to die for), the charred avocado (filled with some sort of yogurt and chia seeds) and the siracha honey broccoli (which sounded better than it tasted).You can also buy beer or wine here to balance out all of the healthy ;)",4,3,10

It'd be nice to see more restaurants like Mulberry & Vine in Lower East Side and Ctown. We need more healthy, vegan choice besides the typical Chipotle.

Updated review","The tase is quite good. As a celiac, I always welcome new menus. I also enjoy healthy food. This restaurant features mostly a savory palate with a number of delicious chicken and vegetable options. While the portion is decent, the proportion of simple carbohydrates to proteins and complex carbohydrates is a measure out of balance for the cost, as this restaurant is pricey for lunch, thus not great value. That is the only thing that would keep me from being too much of a regular. You will enjoy the flavors, nonetheless.",,,

38,Marie B.,"Central, Vancouver, Canada",16,61,113,4.0,8/14/2017,"Delicious!!! I'd come back!Great ambiance, good variety of flavors in each dish. Wide selection of dietary options with a low amount of dishes with the top 10 known food allergens(gluten, sesame, dairy,...). You are able to customize your dish; you can have a leafy bowl or a plate. You can choose 2 or 3 sides with your dish. I had a plate with hot Moroccan chicken and brown rice as well as a side of roasted sweet potato(yams) and a side of steamed (or sautÃ©ed and then chilled) lemon + turmeric cauliflower. We also tried the white bean chili, grilled avocado and the quinoa. The quinoa was actually flavorful which is rare to find in a restaurant. The staff was very helpful and polite. We also tried the desserts which unfortunately gets 3.5 stars. We tried the cinnamon sugar gluten-free donut and a gluten-free brownie. The sugar crystals on the donut were too large and were crunchy. The donut was a bit too dry...it was more like pound cake. The GF brownie was a good bite sized dessert.

43,Christina L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",151,313,238,3.0,9/16/2016,"Decisions, decisions, decisions... That's what this place is all about. You decide what veggies and what protein you want for lunch. Â The options are varied and give you a chance to choose healthy eats while still having fun. For example, you can have beets with apples & mint or red lentil & kale dal. In other words, not something you'd necessarily make at home.I would rate this place higher but the noise level detracts from patrons' ability to digest in peace. Come here with a friend? Expect to shout over the thump-thump-thumping music on steroids to be heard. Â I find this strange since it's not a sports bar or club.

44,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,4/14/2017,"Mulberry & Vine reminds me a lot of Dig Inn: same vein of fast casual, same emphasis on eating ""clean"" (meaning locally sourced and whole ingredients), a lot of kale and quinoa on the menu, etc. I chose the $9 all-veg plate but it's only a few dollars more if you add protein. The amount of food on my vegetarian plate was certainly not overwhelming, yet I did appreciate how filling it was in the end. They do a heavy rotation of sides: I ordered the Thai chili noodles, miso peanut cauliflower (by far my favorite of the three), and the kale and black beans. Purportedly, there was supposed to be avocado with the kale but the black beans were so mushy that any avocado would have been drowned out. The kale also was ... gritty. I thought it must have been something in the underlying dressing but nope. Sandy kale. Bleh. Didn't get to try the famous charred half avocado with pumpkin seed puree, as they had run out immediately after the 12-2 lunch rush and were in the process of making more. Also, the guy behind the counter was brusque and businesslike, whereas the girl working next to him took the time to explain what her favorites were to the customer before me. Perhaps I came off as businesslike and he was just responding in turn? I do remember fumbling and ruminating aloud as to whether I should get the sweet potatoes or the kale, and him giving me a stony, ""hurry up and decide"" face. I panicked and asked for the kale. Which was a bad move in retrospect because of the sandiness. Not sure if I'd come back, given how close Whole Foods' salad bar is - there, I usually go for the less heavy items so I generally come walking out with more food for around the same price.

The quinoa with squash lacked flavor (being cold didn't do it any flavors), the broccoli was fine but nothing to write home about, the cauliflower was also bland. This contrasted deeply with the proteins. I tried two and both were excellent - the chicken pozole was hearty and warming, the turkey chili immensely flavorful. If I came back, I might ask if they would just sell me a cup of the proteins - it would be a great stop to grab soup on a cold day, but it's not worth paying for the mediocre veggies.",,,

I liked all the healthy options they had, and that you could get yourself a ""sampler"" of two or three. I went with the three item sampler, of course. Item one was the arugula, goat cheese and strawberry salad. Item two was the charred avocado. Item three was the beet salad. They also have various gluten-free baked items and different drink options. Incredibly, I ignored the bready stuff and made my way to a table by the windows. They have a self-serve water station (broken that day) and a spot for you to grab utensils and napkins. I made my way back to the table only to realize that the guy hadn't given me a dressing for my salad. Hadn't even asked! Who gives a person a salad without even an option for dressing? So, back up to the line I went to ask him for the missing dressing, and would you believe he scowled at me? For asking for something that he should have provided from the get-go! Anyway, the food was fresh and tasty. It was a nice change from the heavy, fatty and rich foods we'd consumed before stopping here, and for less than $12, it was quite the bargain. Just a shame their employees didn't have much pride in their work environment.",,1,1
60,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,461,562,4.0,5/13/2016,"I wouldn't claim myself as a healthy food enthusiast as I've much rather spend my money on a good juicy burger and fries, but I've always wanted to try the ""American 4 choice, 1 soup"" concept (except the American version is pick 3 veggie sides or 2 veggie sides and a protein). Though Dig Inn is more known this as they have more store fronts, Mulberry and Vine has been on my to try list instead because they simply have more options. Not only does Mulberry and Vine has more variety, everything they offer sounds better too! The store from the outside looks rather small and like a to-go spot, but once you step inside, you'll be shocked at how spacious it is; there's 2 floors of seating! It's a popular spot, so once you get on line, I highly recommend looking at the menu on the wall and deciding as the line moves rather quickly. (Tip - if you'd like a drink, grab it before you get on line, because everything's streamlined, so once you get your food order, you're straight at the cashier. Don't be that person to hold up the line!) But don't be too set on your protein - they actually have some items that aren't on the menu wall. I saw they had herb baked chicken wings when I got to the front and immediately chose that! Along with my wings, I chose the vegetable medley base, which is basically mashed sweet potatoes and had the peanut glass noodles as one of the veggie sides, and the quinoa with snap peas as the other. I think for quinoa, you either love it or you don't -I learned I don't love quinoa, so I wouldn't recommend this as a side. Highly recommend the peanut glass noodles - I LOVED the peanut glass noodles! If I can buy a bowl of this, I would! The wings were also really good - if you're eating this with someone, make sure you're comfortable with the person because you'll need to use your hands to gobble these wings (no polite fork and knife to cut these!) The sweet potatoes were nothing special - just sweet potatoes, though they were a little under-seasoned. It's a bit pricey at ~$13, but hey you're in the financial district. And it's healthy food, so they could technically charge more. I'll be back for the peanut glass noodles! Hopefully they'll have the beef stew when I return too!",,1,

With New American snobbery as their angle because Tribeca!I ordered a lot.. the 3 veggie bowl with some sides to pick at.. I was thrilled when it came looking off color and wilty. But unfortunately for me, everything was fresh tasting with bold, acidic flavor.The 3 veggie bowl had sides heaped to the right and left. - charred avocado has the requisite grill marks and an herby, nutty Greek yogurt dressing. It makes for a savory combination and it was my favorite. -dal: I found the dal really tasty, it is green and a bit non traditional, they add rice to the salad bowl which is weird, but i like it. -sauteed kale and bean was my least favorite. Lemony enough to taste like a cleaning product (dunno why I thought Pine Sol), I had to mix it around. The bowl comes with a highly vinegary salad dressing. While it pairs well with the romaine, it may give you a stomach ache. - sriracha broccoli tastes blanched and weak, like it's been sitting out. But the sauce has a pleasant, classic Chinese takeout flavor. -peanut miso cauliflower was blanched and way past al dente, but I love the peanut miso sauce slathered on it. -yuzu slaw had the least memorable taste, but still fresh and citrusy. It is healthful but you get tired of it after a while. I still am skeptical of how 'healthy' this place is. I don't know how long these ingredients are sitting out or where they are sourced from. Plus the food tastes good mostly because of the sauces and bold flavor choices. Â Disappointing that their best item isn't vegan.",4,2,1

The ingredients they use is really fresh as you can see from my photos and they prepare it very quickly as well.

Their food options are superb - ranges from salad to starch (potatoes) to cooked veggies to various soups to roasted and/or baked chicken. Each time I go, i try something new. Occasionally you see a new dish. My only complaint is they used to serve their food on plates with great portions. Â Now they serve it on pre-portioned brown trays. They posted signs around the restaurant to state their rationale for the change which is because of the uneven portions.

I mean, could you imagine eating something like fried chicken and mac & cheese before going into a steam room? I feel like that would be a decision we all would regret. I dragged my shvitzing partner to Mulberry & Vine. We perused the offerings, and I noticed every side was covered in some kind of sauce or nut. I can't deny that pesto makes everything taste better, but it would be nice to have one side without a bunch of added fat or sugar, especially if it's just gonna sit there and soak in it.

First I will begin with the service, everyone was very warm and welcoming, and we all know that's hard to find sometimes in this city. The assistant manager Sam though definitely took the cake. It was mine and my family's first time at this restaurant and she was super patient while we looked over everything, happily answered all of our questions, and offered great suggestions! We all got full meals, a snack, and a fresh lemonade, went to the register and to our surprise Sam blessed us and decided to comp our entire meal! Needless to say that her kind gesture brought me to tears; there are still good people in this world! Now on to the food... I ordered the Chicken tomatillo posole over the vegan mash which was AMAZING! My hubby ordered the vegan Thai curry over the mash and he loved his as well. My hubby is newly vegan and our son is vegan and has very severe food allergies as well so it is very hard for us to find a restaurant where we are all happy with our meals and I am so glad that I found Mulberry and Vine because we loved every last bite so much that we reordered our same meals to go!

Mulberry's menu also features vegan, vegetarian and meat options, so they have something for everyone.

The model is the same as Dig Inn's: you get to pick n number (in Mulberry's case, that number is 3) of ingredients for your meal. I created an all vegetarian plate with kale & apple, beets & goat cheese, and cauliflower & almonds. My friend, an indiscriminate carnivore, loved his lunch as well.

130,Raquel C.,"New York, NY",35,166,10,2.0,8/12/2016,"Not sure what all the hype is for here at Mulberry & Vine. Yes they have the whole farm-to-table protein+vegetable sides formula going on (that I'm super stoked is catching on in the city) but there are other places doing it better (Dig Inn & Little Beet). I liked how quickly the line moved, I didn't like that its CARD ONLY, no cash. I also like that they offer bottled IPA, for a refreshing buzzy lunch hour ;) But when it comes down to it, the sides, protein, and even brown rice was simply BLAND. Greens were overcooked, that rice could have used a little seasoning or something (and it wasn't warm or fluffy or very fresh), and the chicken breast (though ample in size, which made me happy) was just rubbery meat. Maybe I'm being too picky because I typically bring my lunch to work... which consists of (drumroll): chicken, vegetables, and sometimes a starch like brown rice or quinoa. And I am swearing right now on all the graves of all my dead loved ones that MINE TASTES BETTER. I should really open my own farm-to-table fast dining joint (people have been telling me that for years actually), so perhaps I have set the bar far too high. When I do happen to buy lunch out, Mulberry & Vine is the type of spot I'm happy to go to, and that are popping up all over the city. But Mulberry & Vine just doesn't cut it for me. If you want an affordable lunch, in sizable portions, but don't mind that it isn't all that exciting (despite the fact that healthy food CAN be WAY more exciting than this) then be my guest and eat up. I'll pass and pack my lunch.",1,1,1

If you're familiar with Dig Inn the concept is very similar as they both has locally sourced healthy options. I have to say the customer service here is unparalleled. One thing to note is that they do not accept cash. I went to pay and only had cash on me and the manager said the meal was on the house and explained that no cash makes it easier for the employees to close out at the end of the night. I usually get the herb chicken over veggie mash and switch up the two side options. The beets are great, and recently tried the apricot & heirloom tomato salad that was out of this world.

Most of the food options I've tried are pretty tasty abut the stewed chicken has been overly salty a couple times, though, leaving me feeling parched all day.

Could use more avocado and maybe black beans instead of corn. -- Carrot Salad: Simple and fresh. I really like this dish.-- Beets: Also simple and very good.Prices: $12 for 3 cold sides is kind of absurd but there aren't a ton of healthy and fast options near that area so I guess they can get away with their pricing.Overall: If I'm in the area again I'll likely return...not worth a specific trek downtown though.,1,1,

Updated review","Delicious, and guilt-free too!This was second trip to Mulberry & Vine. I promised I'd be back to explore the menu further and I'm glad I did. This trip I was on a mission to dive deeper into the menu. I love the variety of hot and cold menu options to pick from. I choose the Pick 2 Cold/1 Hot Side option today for $13 (add $1 for a bed of lettuce). Today's choices for me included the Chipotle Black Bean Chili on a bed of brown rice, southwest quinoa, corn, avocado, chipotle, and cumin seeds (personally this is one of my favorites here), and the sesame soba noodles, snow peas, with carrots.I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach today, the portion sizes in the Pick 2/1 always leave you feeling satiated, today's experience did not disappoint. I decided to sample some dishes today before making my final selections (free samples!). For my hot selection I went for the chipotle black bean chili, it was delicious! Only minor comment was that it could have been served just a little warmed. Flavor-wise it was spot on. The cold quinoa dish was so good. It's such a great mix of flavors, the pieces of avocado throughout really added to the texture (If I forgot to mention it, this is my absolute fav!) I finished up with the soba noodles, also a great choice. Don't forget the brownies to round out you meal, there's always room for sweets!The staff behind the counter were very accommodating. When I arrived there was a line of about 6 people ahead of me. Suddenly people behind the counter seemed to show up out of nowhere and the line was gone. Very efficient and much appreciated, thank you! I also have to tip my hat to Genevieve, one of owners of Mulberry & Vine who stopped to ask us how we enjoyed our meal. She said they're coming up on their one year anniversary but I've got a feeling they'll be around for a long time to come. It's a popular place in this part of town for a good reason. I try not to go overboard in my reviews but I'm always pleasantly surprised with my visits to Mulberry & Vine.Two solid thumbs up from me on this one, you've earned the much coveted fifth star.",9,8,8
164,Danielle E.,"Charlotte, NC",106,101,238,4.0,7/15/2014,"I came here with a co-worker for lunch today.We both had: 2 Cold + 1 Hot combo plate.My 2 cold sides were:- roasted cauliflower, housemade green sriracha - kale, pickled onions, chia seeds, gf vegan yeast flakeshot entree:- korean braised bbq beef with pickled onion over veggie mashMy friend had:Cold:- hot & sour local tofu, broccoli, toasted sesame seeds- southwest quinoa, corn, avocado, chipotle, cumin seeds Hot:- peruvian turmeric walnut chicken braise over veggie mashAll of them were delicious. I will def. recommend the roasted cauliflower with green sriracha!!! The 'roasted' tasted pairs well with the sriacha. one regret I had was to have chosen the korean braised beef bbq (recommended when i asked what is the most popular dish here). Though the beef is very good and the meat is very tender, it's a little 'plain' in flavor / spices even with the pickled onion. The peruvian tumeric chicken was definitively the total opposite with it's bountiful of spices! I'd def recommend it over the veggie mash, which is a more flavorful option to the quinoa or brown rice. Careful with the filtered water. Today was a very humid day and the filter would turn my water white/milky no matter how many times i'd pour it. When i confronted the staff at the sales register, she offered me a bottle of water on the house. Very nice. She explained that the filter sometimes acts up when it's too humid.Ambiance was nice, modern design, clean. The loft seating area was also interesting.Only 1 star deduction for the price. $15 for the 2 cold + 1 hot combo after tax....You can get more at Whole foods for less. Will come back, but because of the price, not as often as I would like to for a work week lunch.",1,1,

166,Nick A.,"Montclair, NJ",55,171,281,3.0,2/13/2014,"I would say just a bit under 4 stars but only because they have a variety of items, many of which I can't speak for yet. A few more visits will definitely solidify my opinion and warrant an update.Mulberry & Vine works like a lunch service line and employees will make up your plate as you pick your items down the buffet. Although I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, I imagine you'll do well here if you are. I saw a lot of leafy, nutritious options and I got a pretty decent light-fare lunch. I went with the Soba noodles, brussel sprouts and egg salad on toast. All were cold items but there are hot as well. The sprouts were pleasant and had a nice crunch, the egg salad was decent and I would come back just for the Soba noodles. Pretty much the highlight there.Portions seemed kind of paltry considering the price but not enough so to deter me. The freshness was there, friendly line servers to answer my confused questions and they had a nice family/community vibe (baby stroller folks). I was most impressed with the Toby's Estate coffee they have. Easily one of the best I've tasted (even over Kaffe1668) and I wouldn't mind making Mulberry my coffee stop. Will return.

168,Tommy G.,"Manhattan, NY",174,88,10,3.0,9/16/2015,"I can't really go below three stars, because this eatery is clean, quick and a good selection. However, living GF/DF for a few years, the food is very bland in comparison to what it could be. Certainly healthy, but lacks a lot of flavor. Prices are incredibly exceeding the actual cost of allergen friendly ingredients. There is nothing special about that cinnamon sugar donut. Not even a smidge of frosting on it and its $4.50. I understand I'm paying for the service though ...

The roasted chicken was soft and juicy and the vegetable mash (rice alternative) was soo soo yummy. I got it with a size of broccoli and a side of roasted brussel sprouts. Both flavorful, although the portion can be larger. This place is definitely not cheap but it's probably the best option in the area. Many great options to choose from, I can't wait to try the others. Lots of cute, bright seating and the line moves ultra fast so you can get in and get out--NYC style.",,1,
170,Paul P.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",43,13,1,1.0,6/19/2015,It is ironic that they have notes on each table talking about how they fixed people experiencing sticker shock. That's because we ordered a tiny little plate which would qualify as a snack in total and it came to over $18. We were told at the register that we should order differently next time to achieve a lower price. What the f*** I won't come here again.,4,3,
171,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",162,257,919,4.0,2/6/2014,"As much as I love sweets and pastries, I genuinely love veggies. I know, it's a weird combination...I love them separately, but equally. Just as excited as I get in a candy store, my eyes light up with a buffet of fresh, delicious vegetables. To get your fix, there's Mulberry & Vine in TriBeCa. With quick, prepared foods being the focus, you can buy sides or create a meal. And although you haven't transported to Portland, everything here local, seasonal, organic, pesticide-free, hormone-free, and antibiotic-free. Oh, and delicious.There's a great focus on everything being spiced and seasoned just right without using fats and oils. With everything so flavorful, you might just forget that you're eating healthy. I went for a 3 cold sides combo. First, I chose their beets with red chile flakes, pomegranate, cilantro. These were sweet, with the littlest bit of tartness, and then you get a nice light spicy finish. Next, I had the carrot slaw with coriander, jalapeÃ±o, cilantro. I really liked this one, it had a great texture, a nice hint of vinegary flavor and the perfect dash of cilantro and heat. A really nice sweet and slight spice combination. Lastly, I had their roasted cauliflower with housemade green sriracha. The cauliflower had a great roasted flavor, savory, and the green sriracha really brought it home. In fact, the citrusy, spicy, pesto quality of their sriracha could pretty much be its own side, it's that good.",2,2,

Updated review","There aren't a lot of healthy seamless options in my area, so I gave Mulberry & Vine another shot and ordered lunch from there today. I ordered the cup of Turkey and White Bean Chili with Veggie Mash and the 'PICK 3' Entree (2 Vegetarian, 1 Meat). I chose the Kale Salad, Brussels Sprouts with Pumpkin Seed Pesto, and the M&V Lemon Rosemary Roasted Chicken Breast. My order arrived very quickly (~30 minutes) and way ahead of the estimated time. The delivery guy was polite, but gave me a kind of sorrowful look---possibly because of my previous scathing review. Since this experience was so much better than the last time, when M&V just left me hanging and hangry with no explanation for 2.5 hours, I felt inclined to update my review.The turkey chili was pretty tasty and the chicken was cooked perfectly and was moist and flavorful (kind of rare for nyc restaurants that usually overcook their chicken)! The Brussels sprouts had a LOT of flavor and were somewhat bitter. I personally don't like charred foods, as they're carcinogenic, so I would have preferred them to be steamed and lightly sautÃ©ed. If they did that, they wouldn't need to use so much of that bitter pesto to cover up the burnt flavor. The kale salad was great---you can tell it was properly washed, massaged, and marinated, making for a tender and flavorful salad. Overall, much better experience than before! Thanks M&V!",,1,
173,David D.,"Chambersburg, PA",0,4,0,5.0,7/31/2017,"For the traveling vegan, this place is a must! Â Great recipies, fast service, and moderately priced... what more could you ask for in downtown Manhattan? Â My wife and I now have a permanent bookmark for here!",,,

Â  Today, they told me prices had gone down and advised me on 3 sides and one hot. Â Instead of lunch for two being $24, it was $41. Â  When I asked about the charges the manager said 'sorry. We are still adjusting to new prices'. Â Like it was my mistake. Â  Bad management response and bad service = 2 stars in what should be 4.",2,,

179,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,4.0,1/12/2014,"A friend suggested we meet here for lunch, and I was a bit reticent. I am not the healthiest eater, and the menu was a challenging one for me. That said, I very much enjoyed the lunch and would come back again any time. My tasty selections included the farro salad, quinoa patties w/ kale and braised beef. Â If I had a gripe, it's that the place is a little noisy, made noisier by the fact this seems very popular at lunch time with moms and kids. The entryway was crowded with strollers, and at times it felt more like the lunch room at a day care than a restaurant. Seating is not terribly plentiful, and we got stuck at a table with stools rather than chairs with backs. I think a little more thought on the seating would be good for Mulberry and Vine (and perhaps a kids play section so that the adults can get their own section!) The only other quibble is that the meal, including beverage and tip, was close to $20, which seems expensive for a cafeteria style place.Food is definitely worthwhile if a bit expensive. Next time, I might opt for takeout rather than dining in.",1,1,

I've ordered soup at many places around the neighborhood, Mulberry and Vine tops the list. The pick three special is not a bad deal as the portions were very generous and the variety of options were impressive. The farro salad, kale salad, and chicken enchiladas were three solid choices, making a perfect lunch combo. I was incredibly stuffed but still felt good eating such wholesome food.

That's where the good part ends.I went here for a vegan lunch. First of all, try to figure out what you want before getting there, once you're inside, you cant see the blackboard with daily specials because the line forms in front of it. You can see it when you're next, so quick, read description of 25 items and figure out what you want. Then, the servers don't know much about what they're serving, ask a question, get a blank stare. I said I want no rice, veggie mashed instead of rice, so, since the plate has three compartments, she asked each time if I wanted rice. No, No, No, I don't want rice. So, this utterly blew her mind. Well, do you want something else? No, I just want three items, like on the board, well, apparently the protocol is that each item has to be on rice? What??? I really got a horrible server, finally her coworker leaned over and told her to put the item on the plate with no rice. Thank you kind and helpful coworker, I would still be there trying to complete the order if it weren't for you. Then she proceeds to sneeze, she did aim over her shoulder, but it went all over the back counter, ew, gross. Well, at least it wasn't on my food.Then, there is the paying for. Holy crap, for less than a can of beans and lentils with tofu, it was $13 because TOFU is extra. It's a protein. And they are gonna get you no matter what because they know pretty much that you will not be back. Who on earth charges EXTRA FOR TOFU? WHO? So, the guy having beef or chicken pays the same as me with tofu, how does this make sense? And vegan entrees are mixed up with meat entrees, so you have to hunt and peck to find vegan. My friend got BBQ Broccoli which is just charred salted broccoli, chipotle black bean avocado kale salad, and the rice with black eyed peas. Same opinion, just boring, and expensive for what it is. You're eating beans off a paper plate, and not much of it, shouldn't cost $13.And then finally, the eating. I got the red lentil dal, black eyed peas stew, ginger scallion tofu. Mushy bland, mushy bland over mashed mushy veggies. And $6.00 charge for the Tofu. Bland and uninteresting, Tofu sounds and looks good, but only okay. Buy two cans of Goya beans and stay home, or in the office. Not worth wasting your time and money on this place.",3,4,

Now it is really reasonable. I appreciate that it is healthy, fresh food for vegetarians and people with other dietary restrictions. The space is really bright and airy and a great place to come for lunch or a casual dinner. Still, I can only give it four stars because some of the food isn't that flavorful. I stopped by for Taco Tuesday (Tacos are $2.50, wine is $4, and beer is $2). I had veggie tacos and they were very small and bland.
