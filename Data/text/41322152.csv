Updated review",Bless them for doing this for so long.  Love the concept and keeping it simple. It's bars like this that make New York City and Hell's Kitchen great.,,1,
1,Ajae G.,"Manhattan, NY",25,10,11,1.0,9/18/2018,"After over a decade of being a loyal customer, I will never come to this horrifically managed "" restaurant "" run by incompetent, rude, abrasive and miserable souls. I came there for my lunch break and after waiting 20 minutes to place my order, the waitress finally came over, mind you it was empty. After I placed my food order and waited another 20 minutes and was ready to receive my food, I was informed by the waitress that the credit card machine doesn't work and I would have to pay in cash. I did not have cash and told the waitress I was upset because why make me wait nearly 40 minutes to tell me especially when my food should be done and ready at this point. The manager came over unapologetically and told me they had been working on fixing it for two days, to which I responded, "" if you knew all of this for two days, then why wasn't that the first thing I was told? Now you're expecting me to get up when I have my beer here, I been waiting 40 minutes, I'm settled and my food should be done already. This is completely unacceptable. "" He replies, "" I can just cancel the order and you can go somewhere else. "" I was disgusted with his answer because not only did he not apologize or even show an once of care that I now lost my entire lunch break waiting for food to now know it was never even prepared and my hour lunch break was gone without even so much as an apology for the inconvenience. The manager Miguel was vapid, rude, tactless, disrespectful and condescending toward me when I came there to have an enjoyable and serene lunch and it was ruined. I didn't even have time to grab lunch anywhere else. BEWARE!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A PROPER ESTABLISHMENT! The staff and management alike lack the quintessential and fundamental understanding of what customer SERVICE is and should probably not work with humans anytime in the near future!",1,,

If Andy is there, ask for her - she is the best & made sure we had a good time!!!Though a little dark this spot has a great drink selection & plenty of flatscreens throughout for NBA, NFL & MLB games.Though no live music or DJ is on hand, good music is played + great shot deals with good drinks (Try Naughty Barbie).Establisment could improve with additional & new seating, lighting & bathrooms for guests.",,,
3,Bru B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,34,0,3.0,8/7/2018,"Not a bad place to go if your are with the guys to see a game and you stick to the specials. The food is good by bar food standards but nothing spectacular. My largest complaint is that some of the mid-level alcoholic beverages are severely overpriced. Otherwise it's a bit if a tourist trap with the prices, but nothing egregious. Overall not a bad sports bar but there are better options out there for atmosphere and value.",,,
4,David M.,"Mt Kisco, NY",133,75,20,4.0,10/6/2018,For nyc very cheap got 2 beers fried ravioli for 16 hard to beat that in Hell's Kitchen. Iots of tvs sports on  only bad point could use more bathrooms otherwise a great sports bar,,,
5,Gabriella D.,"Brooklyn, NY",178,317,921,3.0,7/1/2018,"Yes, the burgers here--specifically the sliders--taste really great! I went back several times and it wasn't as consistently great as I hoped for. The last time I went was kind of not good so it deterred me from coming back. If I am in the area and want to spend a few dollars on burgers I might try it again once more before finalizing if I will become a returning customer or not.",,2,
6,Ross H.,"New York, NY",347,106,436,1.0,10/10/2017,"So i came here on a Saturday thinking this would be a good place to watch college football and honestly it was a terrible experience. if you look at my profile you will see that i rarely give bad reviews, but this was something els.I legitimately came here for cheap beer and food, with low expectations, and my expectations were not met. The beer was flat, to the point where i asked if i could have another beer because the one i was served was dead flat, and they gave me another one and the second one was flat. My friend that I was with had a completely different beer brand and his was dead flat also. I assume they just messed up all of their kegs or something because it was just simply un-drinkable. When we asked the waitress what beer they serve she had no idea what to recommend.We tried the $1 sliders, which you need to buy 3 at a time, and they were ok, but they come basically on a sub so you cant even separate the sliders properly.All of the tables are up against the wall, so you basically are sitting under the TV's so you have to turn your head in crazy angles just to see the TV. If you want to drink cheap beer and eat bar food, there are so many places in the city to do it, so go somewhere thats worth it, not here.",3,,

Updated review",Y'all lmao I can't see myself coming back here. The vibes here is okay and yes they have good deals and cheap shots but they do nothing. lmao We got this birthday special (champagne and 19 shots) I didn't taste the champagne but I was told that it taste like flat ginger ale and seltzer water. We told the manager and he gave us a free round of shots. The fried oreos are banging.  *thinks to self*as a matter of fact I would like to come back to try the fishbowls and get some fried Oreos.,4,3,1

9,Taina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,69,128,4.0,4/18/2018,"There's a sign outside with the numbers 1, 2, 3. Nothing catching, very plain. Yet, somehow it caught my eye as I walked by and I decided to venture in. APPEARANCE: It's a sports bar with 11 TV's. Nothing spectacular.  But it's a nice open space on a Wednesday afternoon. And it looks clean. ""A"" health food rating on door. Music: Soft Rock/ '60's-70's Rock. Nice volume - loud enough to hear the lyrics but not deafening.FOOD: Decent. Ordered 3 beef sliders at $1 each (3 order minimum) and waffle fries. Could have used a little salt & pepper, but it wasn't bad. Was tempted to try the fried Oreos or Twinkies, but decided to wait for next time I'm in the neighborhood. DRINKS: $2 shots! What more can I say!? Lol. The Jolly Rancher shot was okay. Tasted close to the drink I remember, which is close to a cherry Jolly Rancher, but not much of a kick. The Alabama Slam Her however, had the punch I wanted! They use something called Southern Host instead of Southern Comfort. Although Host is a whiskey of some sort & Comfort is a liqueur, it somehow tastes similar to an Alabama Slamma! Soooo, I opted for a few of those :-) . Don't think the larger mixed drinks on menu would be worth the price. They only put 2 or 3 shots in a large cup & they tell you so on the menu. Either stick with the shots, beer or a regular drink like Jack & Coke or something. SERVICE: Was okay. The host/ bartender/ waitress kept busy behind the bar. It wasn't crowded but she was constantly doing something,  probably prepping. She brought out my food & drinks promptly, although I did have to call her to get my refills. She was pleasant though - makes a good shot! OVERALL: Will prob return. Food just needed a touch more flavor but was good enough to give another try.  Waitress was nice. Music was easy going but fun (for me). Shots are tasty.",1,,
10,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",153,765,9965,4.0,8/4/2017,"Me and my friend Kim were so happy that Spencer J suggested this cheap and yummy spot. We sat by the bar because other people were waiting for that emptied table meant for a party of 4. Woah baby $2 shots shots shots along with a pretty affordable drinks menu Food: Spencer - 4 sliders mmm they are $1 each when you ordered minimum of 3 + Chicken & Waffle...breaded and peanut butter sauce...the sliders were yummy but couldn't try his wings because I am allergic to peanut butter Kim - Chicken & Waffle...breaded and hot sauceMe - Chicken & Waffle...breaded and barbecue sauce...oooo ""mama like"" the saucy wings...the waffle was yummy and has a thicker batter then I got a Pomegranate Virgin Frozen Slushie...pheewww they put in the alcohol after which is better for me Pretty cool spot for a Friday night =)",15,8,13
11,Martha S.,"Tulsa, OK",0,6,0,5.0,10/15/2018,This place is so not New York and it's absolutely fabulous. It is a great taste of home in the south- very friendly vibe and atmosphere full of people who welcome you and make you feel like you're in the south from the second you walk in.,,,
12,Kimberly H.,"Norfolk, VA",336,21,3,1.0,9/20/2018,"Went there yesterday,  order a two for one wings.   I kid you not each order had hair in it.   The waitress was nice enough but hair in both orders of wings was crazy.   This was my first and last time going.",,,
13,Christine C.,"West Bronx, NY",9,114,134,4.0,12/12/2017,"This place here is comparable to a dive bar. I've been here twice and the food smells good but it's just decent. I got their fried twinkies and fried Oreos. Man are the Oreos good but them twinkies have a sour aftertaste to them that I can't get over. I would literally only recommend this place if you guys are going with a good crowd of people, and just want to drink. It's all about the vibes man. So set your own vibe and head over to this spot, then go somewhere to eat afterward.Why 4 stars? Because the service is decent, the girls (seems like a fully female staff) always circle back even when it's busy to check up on you, again the drink specials are good (especially for you beer drinkers out there) and it's fun to people watch. In terms of bars and things related it's a decent spot to hang.",1,,
14,Sherry W.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,171,455,3.0,7/7/2017,"Small place but very narrow. Came on a Saturday night (7/1) so it was very busy. People were everywhere and it was hard to get to the bar to speak to the bartenders. Long wait for a table but I saw ""reserve"" signs on some tables so it's safe to say they do reservations. There is a bouncer outside scanning ids. I came with a large group of true as (12 of us) to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday. Ordered Lemon Drop shots and then decided to leave to find a quieter bar where we can sit rather than stand awkwardly in middle of the cramp bar. We all liked the lemon drop. Normally I avoid it as I'm not a fan but it wasn't too sweet nor tart. Tasted yummy.",,,
15,Michael A.,"Springfield, MA",125,12,1,1.0,6/6/2018,"I work construction down the block at the school across the street in the evening. I come here occasionally to get something to eat other then the pizza and Chinese places that there's only to eat. Everytime I come here. I order the exact same thing. 5 beef sliders with waffle fries. And almost every time, it take god dam forever. Just now I literally waited 35 min for my food to come out. The bartender ( short Spanish girl, black hair, large back tattoo) is rude and will literally ignore you. Before I even was able to order my food with her, I sat there for 10 min trying to get her attention. My food finally comes out and I got not even a handful of super hard fries. So not only did I have to wait my entire break for the food to come out. It came out sub par and with very little fries. I wait another maybe 7 min trying to get her attention from a not busy bar, to tell her these fries are no good and I need more. 10 more min goes by till my fries come. I had maybe 10 min to eat my meal before having to go back. I think the thing I hated the most about the place was the girls attitude. Just not very inviting or like she wants to help you. I'm done coming back here. I'm 26. This place is really just for younger crowds that don't care about all that. Good thing is the music is definitely good so if I was already drunk I'd come here.",,1,
16,Blackout D.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/23/2018,"Over priced weak drinks, service is abysmal at best the waitress rushes you to make an order and get an attitude of you don't hurry up but the killer part is they literally take an eternity to bring back what you ordered, I can't believe how terrible of a time I had. And they kept wanting to charge my card and I had to repeat myself over and over that NO I will pay with cash that alone made me a little uneasy is as if she wanted to use my card. That's not all here's the best part I was charged full price for a shot!!! How does a shot cost the same as a full drink!!! I'll NEVER EVER EVER EEEEEVVVVVVEEEERRRRR RETURN AND I WARN YOU ALL NOT TO GO HERE!!!",,,
17,Frances T.,"Manhattan, NY",242,86,428,5.0,3/26/2017,"Do come here if you're on a budget. You can eat and get drunk for cheap. The sliders must be ordered in 3s each for a $1. Get the beef patty it's way better than the turkey patty. There's plenty of sauces to add to it. I added mustard and hot sauce and it was delicious. Had to order 3 more!I didn't try the shots, but people were ordering them in dozens so I'm sure they were good and were getting them tipsy. Not sure what all the complaint is about in the other reviews, but hey it's super cheap here. You get what you pay for. It's a dive bar. Don't expect fine dining experience here.",4,2,3
18,Mike A.,"Bergen Beach, NY",3,4,0,1.0,9/6/2018,The worst place to eat ! Very dirty !! They gave no utensils to eat and no napkins and we ordered wings and they charged 1 dollar for blue cheese..and when the bill came out we waited 30 mins for them to give us the check saying there system is down ... the worst place ever ! I would not tell my worst enemy to go there !!!!!,,,
19,Irene H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,26,18,4.0,5/3/2018,"Cheap shots, water down beer and alright food. If your a cheap port college student this is the place to be. Good prices but slow service.",1,,
20,Julia M.,"Elizabeth, NJ",113,5,6,2.0,9/4/2018,"I was really excited to try out this place but it wasn't at all what we expected. But then again when you're paying that cheap for food and drinks, what are you really expecting? My friends ordered the buffalo wings and she asked for blue cheese on the side and they brought us salad dressing packets. They also served our food on paper plates. The games were fun, we had the rainbow roulette shots that brought 19 shots. We had so much fun we ordered another round that brought another 14-16 shots. But anyway, in my opinion if you're playing it for the roulette wheel just order it on amazon (which is what we did immediately after) and don't waste your money. Because the shots are way too sweet, way too expensive and your chances of leaving there with a headache are higher than you actually will drunk.",,,
21,Kiavonnie F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,3,2.0,6/18/2018,"The sliders are no bigger than a quarter. I guess that's why they are $1. Shots taste like juice, service ehhh. Isn't horrible but is far from fun and amazing. Save your money.",,,
22,Amani J.,"Southfield, MI",160,12,8,4.0,3/21/2018,"Myself and a group of 18 classmates are in New York for a conference from Michigan. A couple of our classmates mentioned 123 burger and how they have $1 burgers and $2 shots. Being college students, it was an opportunity we could not pass up. This was great because it's probably some of the cheapest food I've had in NYC so far. At first, I was hesitant because the price sounded absurd. Once I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it actually was. The restaurant was completely empty and we were the only customers, which I found odd. However, it was a Monday night. The sliders are small and similar to White Castle's, which is totally fine because they're only $1. There is also a 3-burger minimum. There are only certain shots that qualify for the $2 price. I thought they would be weak, but they still packed a punch despite being mixed and smaller than a normal shot glass. The overall environment of the place was very sports bar-esque. The waitress was wearing a very revealing outfit, which isn't necessarily an issue for me but I wanted to mention it to give yelpers more of an idea of what to expect. Overall, this was a good experience. Also, TRY THE WAFFLE FRIES. They are so good.",1,1,
23,Warren M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/20/2018,"Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever experienced at a restaurant in YEARS. Me and 4 friends ate there tonight and the waitress disappeared for at least an hour and a half without at least the slightest warning. She comes back from ""break"" just in time to collect our money for the tab and collects mandatory gratuity from all of us. She then forgets to hand my friend her card and ID back! We had to walk all the way back just to get those items and had to argue with the manager who practically begged us not to write a bad Yelp review! Pathetic and I'll never be back. BEWARE, gratuity is added no matter how bad the customer service!",1,,
24,Aleksandra E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,40,96,2.0,8/21/2017,"Well , what can I say , if not my friends I would never come to this place . Yes , the prices are low , but 2$ shots are too sweet to my palate and I have no idea what kind of alcohol they add in there .the food is awful: philly cheese stake , firstly , there is no steak in it . Secondly, the meat in there is grounded meat same as in the sliders . Cheep , low quality tasteless . I think it was my huge mistake to go in there , never again ! Sliders are worst then the White Castle . Beware that 15% tips already included regardless .The only bright spot was the service",1,1,1
25,Tiara W.,"Far Rockaway, NY",1,6,1,3.0,7/14/2018,"Upon entering we took our own seats. After sitting down 2 waitresses walked up to our table without greeting and began to wipe it down. We were greeted by our actual waitress- she was pleasant. We first ordered sliders, naked honey garlic wings, two shots and a henny hangover (fish bowl). The drinks were not very strong especially the shots- they taste like juice. The food was ok. However, this establishment saves lots of money- paper plates, plastic shot cups and fish bowls. We then order two beers and as I was drinking my beer there was a lid from a Jell-O shot in it. The waitress apologized and took the beer off my bill. However, I didn't appreciate the bartender laughing when the waitress brought it to the bartenders attention that their was an issue with my beer. This spot is good for quick eat and drinks. Make sure you check your drink and ask the waitress from your ID back because I didn't get mine back from opening a tab. Come to find out the waitress found my ID dropped on the floor after it was in her possession.  FYI 15% gratuity is included in your bill.",1,,
26,Michelle J.,"New York, NY",31,5,6,5.0,8/15/2018,Great deals! Even if u don't go for happy hours. Great customer service. Amazing $2 shorts and fries to die for. Would definitely come back.,,,
27,Tim L.,"San Francisco, CA",600,182,301,2.0,3/20/2018,"This was a very sad nightlife experience.  We were lured in by the $2 shots, but you get what you pay for.  The place was filthy and literally every table I touched was sticky.  Additionally, the $2 shots are very not worth it - they put so little alcohol in there, you would be better off paying $15 for a cocktail at a more upscale/classy bar.  Also, beware that they do automatically add a tip to your bill, and they try to get you to tip on top of that.  I'm sure that a bunch of people don't know about this and pay extra for lackluster service and drinks.  If you do add tip automatically, you should put a sign up somewhere or announce it better instead of hide it in 8 point font at the bottom of a paragraph in your menu.",,,
28,Blair Y.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/27/2018,"2 weeks in a row that I have yet to see my favorite bartender (nicknamed her short stuff) besides sam  who is pretty fucking cool and makes your drink amazingggggg (i met her 2 weeks ago)....but like where is my short stuff. I brought a group of girls because she was the one who broke down the menu for me. tells you what's good and what's not(doesn't let you waste your money on crap you won't like) loved her for that. Originality, tipped her more for being honest with me. She got me obsessed with watermelon martini and this new one 'eat my peaches' haha. She legit made my first time back in a long time fun as hell.(haven't been here since 2013) I was talking to her about something personal wanted her opinion and I swear she had me laughing to the point I snorted; made me feel better about my situation. I swear my girls were going to love her :( sucks she wasn't here when we all came. I'm planning to come again but this time for my girls birthday turning 27. Miss adriana aka my short stuff told us to apply for a membership, if we did it on mine or a friend's birthday we would get rainbow shots along with the champagne and sparklers that automatically comes with the member ship. I want to go when she is there so I can sign up with her. She took care of me so I want to take care of her.She was the sweetest thing to me unlike the other bartender who has long hair and some kind of accent. She's rude; makes me feel rushed and if I don't buy enough she gets this attitude and I sat there to see her facial expression after I gave her the check back and she glanced my way with such a disgust and then walked towards the guy and using her thumb to point behind her to signal towards me. Your workers shouldn't gossip about your customers like that. I was going to give her 5 dollars but I was dying to see what her reaction would be if I didn't tip and when I saw her reaction, I no longer wanted to tip her. You shouldn't treat your customers that way. The bar wasn't busy and the big guy at the end is clearly taking care of drinks, no need to rush me and if I don't tell you what I want quick enough you roll your eyes and walk off to the next is poor customer service skills for a bartender. This didn't happen today this happened last week when I was popping in to see if Adriana was in which she wasn't, I don't understand why that lady had to treat me that way, short stuff was the opposite ; she like I said above helped me,took her time with me because I do have such difficultly deciding what to drink or eat 99% of the time. Maybe I should have just left since I didn't see sam or adriana that night. Short stuff if you see this please let me know what days you work or if you no longer work there please let me know where you work! I will totally come see you! Bring my money and friends to you girl!!",2,,
29,Sarah M.,"New York, NY",173,124,90,2.0,7/10/2017,"Cheap shots, which is great for a poor grad student, but that's about the only thing good about this place, and that's saying something. The shots were sickly sweet and tasted more like mix than alcohol. It's small and no one was dancing, which the group of us wanted to do. It seemed to be really empty, especially for a Saturday night and we got there around midnight. The real issue was when we were waiting for the bathroom, which there was a bouncer/security guard in front of preventing more than one person from going in??? Maybe he had another purpose, but that's all he was doing from what we could see. While we were waiting some waitresses came up to us and rudely told us we needed to move. We weren't blocking the way around us, and there's really no where else to stand to wait for the bathroom, so we're not sure why the first interaction with us needed to be so rude. We promptly left to go elsewhere. The service and the shots really weren't worth it.",1,2,
30,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",515,466,1964,2.0,5/30/2017,"If I was still in college, then maybe I would have been more impressed but this bar looks just like any old bar with deals that aren't so much of a deal. Their sliders and two inches in diameter and their wings tasted like the chinese take-out with sauce drench on it. As far as location, it's somewhat out of the way (considering that it's on 10th Ave) and the club-like lightens are someone distracting and annoying. One good thing about this place is their service. Their servers are super friendly, sweet and attentive.",5,1,1

32,Sarah R.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",0,2,0,2.0,10/6/2018,"This place is great but the staff is terrible. They wouldn't give us adequate seating for our table because they were attempting to save an additional four top. It was absolutely ridiculous. We were a table of ten people. They gave us a four top and two two tops. Which is adequate seating for eight people. We were ten people. When it was suggested to have a four top added instead of a two top, I was given such an attitude I didn't want to stay. The place is awesome food and drinks are great but the wait staff is so horrible that it ruined the entire experience. It's unfortunate. As a former server I don't understand that kind of behavior and attitude from a wait staff.",,,

The $1 burgers are really cheap but at the same time realllllllly small... I'm talking smaller than White Castle burgers.  Anyway....the service was slow but in all fairness the girls behind the bar were overwhelmed. I've been here a few times but this time was a disappointing experience. We eventually ended up heading to another bar. If you're looking for a place where you can eat cheap and want cheap shots then this is your place.,,,

Let's start with the fact that we sat at the bar and was asked by the ""bartender"" how we were paying before we even put in our order. Note that I use the word bartender very lightly.She was completely lost behind the bar, took forever to actually come over and speak to us and decided that it would be a smart idea to take one person out of four's order then walk away.Seems like this young lady was employed solely off of her ""looks"" and not because she actually was qualified for the job.All in all we ended up leaving sober and hungry!Never Again",,,
35,Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",92,253,398,4.0,5/5/2017,"This place was delightfully fun. I came on St. Patricks Day with a few friends. IT WAS SO DAMN PACKED. Everyone was commuting from different parts of the 5 boroughs so....I was stuck with my friend's cousin. How do you kill time with stranger you don't know? You do $2 shots. That's how. Silly me thought,  that the fruity drinks wouldn't give me a buzz. Clarification, 2 won't do anything. But 7 will. It's a pretty standard bar. Servers walking around in their underwear in freezing weather. Everyone on top of everyone. The little burger sliders are cute. I forgot the rate, but it's pretty filling. Light meal to prepare yourself for a night of shameless drinking. People are so damn nice when they're drunk. A group of ladies were visiting NYC and decided they wanted to take pictures with us as we were leaving. LET ME CLARIFY. As I was walking towards the door, my friend grabs my arm and tells me to pose with strangers. That picture is floating around somewhere.

37,Douglas C.,"Manhattan, NY",122,4,2,1.0,5/30/2018,"To Whom It May Concern,   On Saturday May 27, 2018 I visited your restaurant with 4 other friends. We arrived roughly at 10:45 pm and sat at table 30 in Melissa's section. Although Melissa needed a few reminders with certain things such as water etc, she was very polite about it and apologized along the way. However this email is not about Melissa but I feel like she did deserve the credit, tip, and recognition she deserves.    This email is actually about Aaliyah. I do not know if she was a server or a host being that she spent most of the time at the front door.  One of my guest at the table did not enjoy her drink, and Melissa offered her another option. The second choice didn't suffice so Melissa went to have the drink voided. Roughly around 11:45pm two additional tables walked in and Aaliyah approached the table with extreme hostility as if we knew her from prior occasions. Walking up to the table clapping at us with her talk, the conversation went as such :Aaliyah : ""Y'all dome yet? Because I need this chair."" (All while clapping at me)Me : No we are not done yet, we are waiting for our check.Aaliyah : "" Well I need this chair for them, can you get up and let them sit.""At this point I became extremely enraged.Me : ""No you may not have the chair, what you can do is grab Melissa pass the check along to us and we will be out of your way.""As Melissa approached the table I asked for a manager, but no one was around, so I asked for Aaliyah's name. I also told Melissa to coach Aaliyah that it is not ok to make guest feel unwelcome or rushed.As I'm walking out the door with my guest, I overheard Aaliyah talking into her Apple Watch describing my outfit and naming everything that I had on along with my guest which enraged me even further. I did not react at this point but was very upset at the though the thought that she was calling someone to meet me outside. Whether she was joking or not that is highly unacceptable. I am a frequent there and if Aaliyah employment is still current I honestly will not be back. She was so unprofessional and did not uphold the company's brand.I would like for a manager to reach out to me in regards to this matter at their earliest convenience.Sent from my iPhone",1,,
38,Diamond P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,9/25/2018,I definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants good food that is cheap. The place is pretty small and can get pretty crowded on the weekends. The friendly staff makes for a friendly environment. The only con I have is the pretty weak margaritas they serve. Other than that I love this place and I try to get everyone I know to go there.,,,

I had such a fun time here and always ask my friends when we're going to go back.This is a great place to go on a budget. You can't go wrong with $2 shots. Every person in my group bought a round for everyone which makes it easy to try everything and not have to commit to one drink. The shots are on the smaller side but are so good that you might as well try them all. The Jolly Rancher shot is the best. When you get there, put your name on the list for a table and then immediately order rounds of drinks. When they call you, you can continue to order drinks but will be able to sit down and order food too. I have to say that the food is good for how cheap it is. I'm excited to try the new menu items like the boozy ice pops.",,,

44,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,1.0,4/26/2017,By far one of the worse bars I have been to in NYC in my 14 years of being legally able to go to bars. I'm guessing the good reviews come from how inexpensive the sliders and other foods they have here but the issue with that is...it actually has to be good food first which for me it is not.First and foremost: My friends and I came here at a fairly early time of night (around 9:30 pm) Still had to wait over 2 hours to be seated. Finally get seated and the seats on the wall wear partially ripped up and slippery which made that part of being here uncomfortable. Added to that one of my friends who had only ordered 3 drinks for the whole night got charged damn near $80...$80 for 3 drinks from which were fairly watered down. As for me I only had 2 shots and a drink. None of which really got me even buzzed. Had a slider here and some fries. Both of which tasted really bland and not even worth the inexpensive price it is. So:-Long waits to be seated-The seats themselves are old and suffer from wear and tare-The drinks are overpriced and watered down-The food is not good123 Burger Shot...321 Not a go again spot.,,,

49,Victoria R.,"Somerville, MA",1,43,8,3.0,8/11/2018,"I'd really give 3.5 stars if possible. I have mixed feelings. Positives: The beer was good and cheap, with a really good selection. I didn't have any food, but it looked really good from the people who did order it. They also serve beer towers. All in all, could be a really great spot to come watch a game. Negatives: the staff is not friendly at all. I can understand why, but still- rubs you the wrong way. We came in a big group after work and they told us that we couldn't take up more than 3 high tops. Weird, considering we had brought in business of 20+ people and the place wasn't crowded. Next, they were super uptight about ordering at the table vs. at the bar. I get the servers want to keep their tips separate, but the service was slow and because we were in a big group with only 3 tables, we were kind of all moving back and forth. Lastly, and most annoyingly, my friend and I ordered 2 shots as we were closing out (thinking why the heck not, they're only $2!). We got our bills and they were $24. Thought there must've been a mistake because we only ordered 1 large beer besides the shot. We asked and the bartender goes ""there's tax"". Like what? Turns out the shots were $8.50, not $2. Big mistake, and classic that they didn't tell us when we ordered. Gratuity is included, which was posted all over the walls, but the receipts are deceptively inconspicuous. Would probably go back, but just be aware of the scams!",,,
50,Hakeem S.,"Austin, TX",449,17,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"Wow I have never had a more horrid, disgusting, and dysfunctional experience at a restaurant. We approached the bar to order food while waiting for our table. Apparently, this place has no sense of time seeing as they thought 8 people wanted to waste their time at a second rate restaurant that is one health inspection away from being shut down. After getting the table, we were met with an inexperienced and sassy waiter with a condescending tone. The waiter was clueless to the specials of the day and was rude during the entire encounter. After the food came out and the dinosaurs died off we received stale, over-coated, tasteless chicken. I didn't know chicken could be so disrespected. Furthermore, the so called sliders (white castle hand-me-down) came out burnt and overcooked. They impressed me with the amount of detail they took to ruin every single moment of the night. As the dinner continued the waiter forgot to mention that getting a soda would cost an extra $3. The lack of competency is shocking considering this restaurant has been here for a while. The only decent thing was the cheap alcohol deals that will you get you drunk enough to almost forget how terrible the service and food is. So please do all of us a favor and close your restaurant and just become a bar because the only thing you're good for is serving alcohol. You're welcome .",3,2,

The waiter then took the drink back and brought me a new one . She tried to make up for it with two tequila shots but it wasn't even what we were drinking ! It was a cheaper house version of patron . Then when we decided to ask for the bill she had the nerve to add gratuity on the bill. It was 2 people ! I have never in my life seen something like that .

54,Ankita A.,"Los Angeles, CA",646,251,895,3.0,12/8/2016,"123 is a good place for a quick, cheap pregame or a really laidback hangout with friends. It's a fairly divey sports bar that's not really my kind of scene, but I can't deny that it's cheap and gets the job done.A friend and I first came here when we saw the advertised ""$1 burger, $2 shots, and $3 beer"" special. We figured there must be some kind of catch, but this deal really is all day every day. The only thing is that the burgers are actually sliders (with a 3-slider minimum) and the shots are mixed shots (i.e. vodka + a sweet mixer or 3). Regardless, it's a great deal! I'd pass on the sliders, but their waffle fries are good and come with a variety of sauces. Fried chicken and waffles were passable too, unfortunately. I had my mind blown when Guinness was included in the $3 beers. There are even some lagers, Shock Top, and a stout, so for beer they're solid.Overall, 123 will continue being a good option to pregame a night out or grab a beer with friends. Nothing amazing about the atmosphere or drink quality, but still very good for what it is. The place gets pretty crowded on Thurs-Sat nights and often has a wait for tables on these nights, so keep that in mind.",4,,3

76,Gael M.,"Queens, New York, NY",173,200,103,2.0,10/3/2016,"123 Burger Shot Beer... tantalizing name for an underwhelming place. The good:Cheap stuff! You can fill up and get buzzed for $20. $1 Burger sliders (min. 3), $2 shots, $3 beers. Ingenious!Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. Shots - sure, they're $2, but it's mostly juice and chasers. And it's not a full size shot so you're not really getting your money's worth. My group instead opted for the $7 bombs because at least you get full shots with those. Menu - there isn't much else on the menu regarding food that I'd order outside of fries. They have a wide selection of options but they seem overpriced especially in comparison to the $1 sliders. So why bother?Space - it's kind of a hole in the wall. there's a lot of seats at the bar, which is a plus, but all the other tables (outside of 4 small high tops) were along the right hand wall. Only problem is it's uncomfortable to sit on the wall side because the tables can't physically move any closer so you may find yourself having to stretch. There seemed to be some outdoor seating but the space looked minimal. Service - the first time I came, service was on point and attentive. The second time it was atrocious. Our initial server took what seemed like hours between greeting us, taking our drink order, taking our food order, etc. She barely even checked on us afterword.. we finally noticed she was working behind the bar without any explanation as to why or who would be taking over or anything. We had two other servers help us out but they were also new so, while it wasn't their fault, it didn't really help the situation. We started ordering 2-3 rounds at a time because things took so long. Management - there was one identifiable manager present that stood around on his phone. This was especially annoying when our food and drinks started to take forever to come out. When we actually arrived, he cleared off one of the high tops and sat my friend and I there. There was another table about 6 inches away that we decided to pull closer because someone else was joining us. The manager said they couldn't give us the table until the person arrived. My first question is how could they give us the table if it's possible they could give it away? And if they're gonna give us the table anyway, why not just move it the few inches and let us claim it? Nobody's gonna sit that close to us anyway so the conversation was just redundant.123 Burger is good if you're on a budget. You can even get a beer tower to split with friends, but outside of that, I wouldn't bother going out my way to come here.

We were greeted right away by our server Helena, and seated quickly.  I've heard good things about this place from friends, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it. As their name implies, this small spot offers $1 sliders (order of 3 minimum), $2 shots (in a variety of flavors, with interesting names), and $3 beers (a fairly short list on tap, but mostly popular picks).  Per my best friend the shots were strong, but pretty tasty and she was pleased with Helena's recommendations. I was disappointed by the size of the sliders though. When I think sliders, White Castle's comes to mind. Small petite burger, but still does the job. These were minuscule - I guess they're doing YOU the favor by enforcing a 3 minimum rule lol.  Although small, the sliders were so good and paired with their Golden BBQ sauce, I was in miniature heaven. We happened to come in on a night they were offering buy one, get one wings - 2 orders of wings for the price of one. I hated turning down such a good deal, but they have no boneless wings and I'm just not a bone-in type of gal. I like that they bring a little caddy with 6 sauces (ketchup, bbq, mustard, hot sauce, Golden bbq and idk the last one) to eat with your sliders, wings or other eats. You definitely get your money's worth, and I would recommend trying this place. Ask for Helena, she offered great suggestions, was funny and charming and her service was fantastic!",,,

Updated review","I come here very often , and I always request this one girl who's name is Melissa. She is by far one of the best servers there. She always tells us all the benefits we can get if we go eat here a lot and is a great seller! She has very gray energy and never lets us wait long for the food. They have excellent music here and excellent beers ! I come here a lot for a reason ! I definitely recommend this place !",,,

89,Kadya T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/20/2018,"Terrible service!!!! How does a waitress go on a break for a hour and not allow her table know that she is going on lunch.. How for a hour we are looking to order drinks and the other waitresses were telling us they are not taking care of our table, ""your waiter is on lunch is what was told to us."" No one ever came to the table to introduce their self to the table. Another waitress came to the table and assisted us. It was funny how the waitress appeared as soon as the bill was placed on our table and tip was included in the bill. How should you be given a tip when you didn't have great customer service or at least give the customers the right to determine the amount of tip given. What made it even worse was they forgot to give back the card and ID that was given. After the long walk back and talking  to the manager on duty to want to argue about the situation. Instead of making sure the customer was satisfied. When approaching the manager for the card and ID he said it t was left with the bouncers.. why would a manager give someone's ID and credit card with a bouncer instead of the manager holding to give to the customer her self. Customer service sucks.. The worse ever, never going back again... Ashley was the worse waitress ever...  The manager was very nasty.. He was asking my friend not to post a review because it would only make it worse for him.. As a manager why wouldn't you want to customer to come in and speak with you about the service and inconvenience..  Than the manager going to show off in front of me talking about he going to write the waitress up, mean while the waitress is right there hearing the whole conversation. I told him don't bother because I already knew he wasn't going to do anything it was just all y'all cause I was there. The waitress didn't look scared at all. Yes I come here often and this was the worse experience ever.. Everyone was fully aware at my table that our waitress was missing and when others were serving us. Everyone was fully aware that no introduction to the new waitress was giving. As a manager as you claim you are will realize in the morning how unprofessional you are and how you could have handled it on another level .  Not always pacifying the situation is what everyone customer is looking for, trying to shut customers up with free round of drinks is not covering up for the unprofessionalism.k",1,,

They have 1 dollar burgers, sold in sets of 3, 2 dollar shots, and 3 dollar drafts. They have insane large mixed drinks sold in patron bottles too! Some drinks can cost up to 40 bucks but that's probably the only thing you'd be buying there that night! I was there on a Saturday night and the party was bumpin. Seating was limited so we just stood at the bar. The bartender serving us was not rude even though we could tell he was super busy.They really do have a good amount of beers on draft. I tried a good amount of new things and enjoyed all of them. They aren't full 16oz drafts but where else are you going to find 3 dollar beers in NY?",1,,1

There were several empty tables. We were seated right away and put in our order thereafter. It took at least 30 minutes for our sliders to come (they were ok). I had to remind the waitress that we ordered sweet potato fries too (pretty yummy). We also had to remind her that we ordered drinks. Basically, the service is horrible.My friend ordered a glass of water too and they forgot to bring it, even after we reminded them twice. When our shots were delivered the waitress set them down on our table using a tray that was nasty - there was a puddle of water on it and it was sticky and gross.Not only was the service slow, but the manager was also hovering over the staff and not making the situation any better. In sum, if you're looking for a quick drink and decent food to pregame, just be prepared for horrible service.",3,1,

After having few arguments he gave us the refund in cash and that too not 100% and I have a strong feeling that he screwed our server's hard earned tips.Food was lame and nothing special. They have very few options.Drinks- So, they fool you with $2 shots because they are not real shots. They just give you one ounce of a cocktail in a small plastic shot cups. I would rather spend $8-10 and have a glass of cocktail then spending 2 bucks for one sip of the cocktail. Yes, they have $3 beers on tap but they are flat af and don't taste fresh at all.",4,,

104,Riccardo S.,"New York, NY",86,573,645,1.0,12/28/2015,"So, I hadn't been to 123 Burger Shot Beer since frequenting it (and loving it) in 2009.  I probably should have left it a fond memory.  Maybe because back then all of our visits had been when we were living a day-and-night project which left us with too much caffeine compensating for too little sleep.  Maybe so many other options have come up along 10th Avenue that this place now pales in comparison.  Maybe this place has just slid very far in those half-dozen years.The six of us were the only patrons in that twilight hour that's too late for lunch, and too early for happy hour.  We commandeered a few tables in the middle of the restaurant right across from the bar, and proceeded to get settled in with beers for everyone and overlapping orders of food so everyone could sample a bit of everything.  Service was friendly, albeit a bit distant - surprising given the fun vibe that used to allow us to gloss over the food.  As it was - we were left with too much time to reflect on what was served.The draft beers were okay, but I got the taste that the lines hadn't been cleaned in a while.  The food is where it all fell apart.  The burgers definitely taste White Castle-ish (and not in a good way), the pigs were wrapped up in stale blankets, the waffle fries weren't crisp, the mac & cheese bites were soggy and tasteless, and I've had better Steak-Um than the cheesesteak on offer.  About the only thing they did decently were the wings.Sorry, 123 - it was fun when it was still fun.",7,1,1

However when 20 minutes had passed and I inquired about our seating, the hostess proceeded to tell me that my name had been skipped since I ordered a snack (4  $1 sliders) at the bar. Now my companion and I are stuck standing at a bar with no place to sit and eat comfortably. I asked to speak with a manager to inquire why we could not sit and they stated it was because if we sat a table and ordered only $20 worth of food it would not satisfy the manager. I told the manager that my companion and I had a snack and wanted to sit for more food and drinks but he forbade it because he assumed we wouldn't spend enough money...All of which was not told to myself prior to sitting at the bar waiting for my table to be ready. Not sure I've ever been to a place where they dictate how much I need to spend to ""satisfy"" the manager??? Or a place that will tell their paying customers they have to stand and eat while tables are available.The gratuities are included in the check so maybe that is why they treat customs like crap because they always get a tip no matter what.For this service I should rate this establishment at a 0 star however since the food tastes decent and there is no option for 0 stars I will rate it at at one",,,

Just generally a bad vibe and the staff just wanted you to order and get out.

After we paid one of our friends was finishing her beer and a waiter reached over us to put a bunch of reserved signs on the table when the restaurant was EMPTY and there were several same sized open tables available to seat people to try and force us out (they were not closing either it was 9pm).

We put in our orders about 10 mins after we were seated and for an hour and a half, we received nothing. Flagging down the waitress was extremely hard because she would have to seat every party coming in and watch the tables she was assigned to work. The green beer was warm by the time we received them and the food was good only because we were starving at that point in the day. As the day progressed the place became super packed but thats when it actually got fun and the rainbow shots had overcome most of the annoyance experienced with sitting there for 2 hours with no food.

The bathroom on the main floor had an awful smell to it, I'm not sure if it was a backed up sewer or the use of a dirty mop.  Drinks:Stick to the shots that are $2 each or the tray for $38.  I went to the bar for a margarita and it tasted like pure lime juice.  It was awful.  I'm pretty sure they water down their liquor.  Jell-O shots were cool, but I can make better ones ate home.Food:  Double Cheeseburger sliders were very flavorful and filling $2 each not a bad deal.  Garlic wings were yummy as well.Staff:It's hit or miss.  The 1st waitress acted like she didn't want be there, so we requested another and she was more attentive. FYI 15% tip is added to you check.",5,,

The service is atrocious; the waitresses are not attentive and when you ask for something they tend to have an attitude (almost like it's NOT their job to get you a damn beer). Food is decent and prices are ok. What pissed me off the most was being asked to move so they can seat a large party, then being rushed from the new table. Also, why do you need to hold my card and ID when I'm sitting at a table, not the bar? When I asked for the check, I'm given a receipt of charges but not my card and ID. When I ask the waitress for my card, she had the audacity to roll her eyes. Had the gratuity not been included, no tip would've been given. Do better.",3,,

When I got my fries they were curly fries the bus boy tells that they don't have waffle fries and I couldn't return it bc I touched it . I asked for the manager and I took him about 15 min to come as he had his waitress talk to us before he came .

I replied ""you just gave us our food,"" she said, I'm going home. Okay I understand you worked a long shift, but immediately after being served? I've worked in this industry for fifteen years. I understand the struggle. But train your staff. Im not going to name the waitress because she was sweet. I'm upset with the management, who don't  know how to train their staff.

153,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,2.0,3/15/2015,"123 Burger Shot Beer represents everything that has gone wrong with capitalism.To begin, their $1 sliders, $2 shots, and $3 beers are actually only half of what you would be served in most places, making their prices comparable to any other cheap bar. Clever marketing, though.However, the quality of the items they serve is reminiscent of late-night fare from a mid-1990's college cafeteria, and I'm pretty sure most of the patrons were still toddlers at the time. That being said, I would rather go for cheap eats somewhere else, where at least I get the feeling that most of the food would not last another couple of decades, whether or not this actually were the case.To drink I had two $3 Blue Moons, or the equivalent of one pint in total. A positive spin to these half beers is that as a slow and moderate drinker, I was able to finish each before they got warm. I also sampled one of their $2 shots. The Kamikaze, served in a tiny plastic shot ""glass,"" tasted slightly of rubbing alcohol, and was not unlike the color of radioactive waste. To eat my friends and I shared a half dozen beef sliders, the peanut butter wings, and the sweet potato fries. The peanut butter wings were what lured one of my friends here in the first place, and the reason why I was here at all. I blame them.On another positive note, my friends finally realized 123 Burger Shot Beer for what it is, and don't plan on going back, which means that I never have to go back, either. Yay!The servers should be praised for their patience, though.",3,2,1

We ordered Pigs in a Blanket as well as Two Orders of Wings - both breaded and one with Garlic Sauce and one with Peanut Butter. Both orders were extremely good, although I preferred the Garlic ones more. The pigs in a blanket were just what I remembered and so delicious. As for drinks, we got the 'Strawberry Fizz' as well as the 'Naughty Barbie' both drinks were pretty good but a tad too much alcohol in there for my taste. However, we did order one of these alcoholic ice pops in the flavor 'Jolly Rancher'... and it was incredible! I could have ate about 20 of those in one sitting if they would have let me. Delicious! All in all, service was attentive and the bartender was very nice. The total bill came out to $44.00 which is not bad for all of that food and drinks. I will be back for sure!",4,3,2

I mean $1 sliders? $3 beers on tap? Come on. Talk about bargains.I brought my friend here because I figured this would be a good place to pre-game before a cconcert that night. I think we went mostly for the cheap drinks. The food was a plus, haha. The inside of Burger Shot Beer is pretty small place -- got a sports bar feel to it. They have seats at the bar, high tables and even seating outside in the back. The menu is one page, not too much variety. Honesty, there's more beer/shot selections than food. And I was totally okay with that. $1 sliders: Not too shabby. They were actually pretty good. Very ""white castle"" size. It was juicy and bite sized. We also split a plate of waffle fries, which... I mean how can you go wrong with that? The restaurant also gives you a little caddy with different types of sauces. Loved that. Go with the Golden BBQ, yum. Sweet and tangy. Fries were crispy and piping hot.And last but not least, drinks: We each got a Blue Moon (my drink of choice) which was great. As well as we tried one shot off the menu. I've seen from other Yelpers that they are very sugary and not much alcohol to them, but hey... I had to try at least one. We both got the ""Panty Dropper"" which was deliciousss.

All good to go!!!!$7 lunch specials... Can't forget beer and shots!!!! My bad",2,2,1
184,Jamila J.,"Bronx, NY",2,7,0,5.0,2/6/2017,The burgers are smaller than White Castle but they are delicious. The French fries is what really gets me. I don't care too much for the shots I just go for the food lol.,,,
185,Michael Z.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",233,531,406,5.0,3/17/2013,"I came here on 3/13 to pre-game for the Dropkick Murphys concert at Terminal 5. A coworker mentioned it to me a few days before and  I was in burger/beer heaven. $1 burgers?! How do you beat that? And $3 beer - I'm sold.As for the food, so damn good. The $1 sliders are seasoned and went down in about 2 bites. There's a minimum of 3 per order which was a-okay by me. I was ready to order another 3 but passed and had the sweet potato fries which were really good. They're thick cut so they weren't a greasy, overcooked mess. Instead they were perfect. This place is already a favorite. And I plan to be back here for lunch.",,,
186,Julissa T.,"New York, NY",138,11,8,4.0,3/21/2016,"Good food, cool atmosphere, good service (Alexis)The food was ok fast service and they had trvia noght so the guest were entertained",,,
187,Brittany V.,"Barceloneta, Barcelona, Spain",374,66,59,1.0,2/2/2016,"Their food is sub-par. The cheap shots on their list are all mixed, and yummy but don't taste like any liquor so if the intent is to get drunk don't do it. The service sucks. The bartender charged me $2 to charge my phone, refused to take my charger then gave me back a dead phone. She had a huge attitude with me and the tables next to us agreed. When taking an order she would roll her eyes. I put in a complaint with the management, but all they did was return the $2 and lightly apologize. No intentions of going back, I've been there a few times and the first 2 times weren't great and this last time terrible.",,,
188,Juliana R.,"New York, NY",118,3,0,5.0,5/18/2016,Kourtney is AMAZING!!! The waitress to ask for ! She goes above and beyond for her customer.Thank you,,,
189,Tiffani G.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,146,227,4.0,12/28/2015,Love going to this place! They have great deals on beers and shots. Their burgers are also pretty good but just very small. Considering they are 1$ plus tax they are what you get for that price. It's a fun place with great music and a crowd of people in their 20s to 30s.,,,
190,Sam P.,"Manhattan, NY",263,2,0,5.0,3/8/2017,"Tiffany is amazing! I wanted to give 4stars because there's no jukebox, but she made up for it! I will definitely be coming back!",,,
191,Michael B.,"McKinney, TX",110,129,612,2.0,12/13/2015,You don't have to be a beer  connoisseur to know they don't serve fresh beer on tap as they were all totally stale. The sliders were pretty good and the shots were nasty. Buy what do you expect for a 2 dollar shot. Only for dive bar lovers.,,,
192,Lola O.,"East New York, Brooklyn, NY",111,236,416,2.0,7/18/2015,"I personally don't like 123Burger but my cousins swear by it so somehow we always end up here.The 2 stars are simply for their bomb shots and friendly bartenders. My fav bomb shot is the dr.pepper. If you like cheap shots ($2) that are more like half a shot and taste like cough syrup this is the place for you. Burger sliders are $1 each with a minimum order of 3. I personally don't drink beer but they are $3 each.The floor and bar is always sticky no matter what time you go. They don't wash their menus which are laminated, so upon picking the menu up good luck trying to put it back down. You also never know what stickiness you will have on your hand afterwards. May the odds be ever in your favor.",4,5,
193,India A.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,51,3,1.0,7/11/2015,"How did I end up here? I didn't pick it out, of course. Sorry, I'm trying to hold my food and drink snobbery down as I write this. Anyway, 123 Burger Shot Beer is what happens when you are celebrating with two guys in their early 20's. I no longer drink so I agreed to go to a place that these two like and that was cheap enough for me to pay for the celebrants drinks and food. This fits that bill perfectly but I wish I would have eaten before I came. $40 for three people including tax and tip.The service is terrible. They add a tip to the bill automatically so there is no incentive to be good at the job. The manager is surly. The food is God awful. I still have a stomach ache. We ordered chicken wings, fried ravioli, sliders, hot dogs and potato wedges. No flavor to anything--it's just plain gross. The shots my two young friends got were various florescent colors so I'm not sure what kind of liquor they were drinking. I think this place would be great if you are 16 with a fake ID and all you care about is getting messed up. If you like even average food, drink and service you must go some where else.",5,3,
194,Ed J.,"Bronx, NY",0,10,0,1.0,9/1/2016,"I went to this place a few years back and I enjoyed the many flavored cheap shots that they are known for. The shots were good. I recently returned to this exactly location on a weekend night, and I must say that I wish I have gone somewhere else.The service here was HORRENDOUS. Our waitress checked on my party of four.. Um never! I personally got up from my seat to search for the waitress more than twice! Our first round of drinks took an half an hour to reach our table. The food took about an hour and fifteen and all we ordered was a chicken bucket with a side fries. The fries were delicious but wings left all of our stomachs on fire the next day. Gross, I had to even call out of work the following morning.I WILL NOT be visiting this place ever again and will never recommend this place!!",2,,
195,Crystal C.,"Manhattan, NY",180,137,292,2.0,5/15/2014,"Wooooah. I only gave them two stars because those sliders were so freaking good. 3 for 3 bucks? SOLD!But wow, I'll never EVER purchase mixed drinks from here again. The first drink I ordered was the frozen pomegranate margarita. Where in the world was the alcohol? The second drink I ordered was tequila three way, one of the bomb shots, I could've made that at home. It was literally 1 shot of tequila dropped into a cup of straight up sugar, GROSS!  Those drinks didn't even give me a slight buzz, what a shame.If I somehow end up back here, it's only because of those burgers.",2,,
196,Crystal B.,"New York, NY",144,6,0,2.0,7/29/2015,"Two stars for this joint because while its an awesome place to get drunk, the atmosphere is eh and, the food is really horrible. The burgers are close to poisonous but they only cost a dollar. Mac n cheese bites are probably the most edible on the menu. However, great variety of cheap cocktail shots and a lot of deals on beer and other drinks. The crowd varies and sometimes gets a bit hectic but it is a bar. Most of the staff is really nice and helpful. Our last waitress was Sam and she was very attentive and funny! In the end, it's a reliable place to get drunk and not go broke.",2,1,1
197,Sassy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,34,0,2.0,10/6/2016,"I won't eat here ever again. The beef used for the sliders, tastes very odd and leaves a unpleasant aftertaste. I also didn't like their chicken wings. They were flavorless. The staff/waitrees  were polite and helpful though.",1,,
198,Brandon S.,"Little Rock, AR",4,2,0,4.0,7/24/2015,"This was a great experience..great atmosphere for group dinners. We had the waffles, burgers, and Philly steak... Good food for not alot of money.Ask for Alexis! She's the best.",2,,2
199,Jessica P.,"St. Albans, NY",0,2,0,4.0,4/11/2016,"Great place! The service is fast, cool music. Chill place to come to on any day I'm sure. Kapri was my server, and she was cool. :) The trivia is fun! My partner and I won free t-shirts, wine, and drinks! I had a wonderful experience. #TheWeekend",,,
