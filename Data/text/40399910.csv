0,,9/24/2018,1,1,"West Hollywood, CA",Shea W.,1,5.0,9,"My gf and I had a quick trip to NYC and decided to check out Pieces during their Frisky Fridays.  We were excited to see some NY drag and Ruby Roo and Brita Filter did not disappoint!  Ruby had her new fabulous wig that touched the heavens and we loved the banter that Brita and Ruby had together.  They connected to the audience, improvised, and made the games very fun!  They danced, whipped their hair, and pranced in high heels in a tight crowd better than anyone else in heels that night.  There were two drunk straight white women (of course) who thought that this was the night they were going to fulfill their fantasies and gain two new gay best friends who were glorious drag queens.  They heckled them, danced in their performance area (which if you've been to Pieces you know it's not much), and were in general being entitled straight white women striving to fulfill their true destiny of being annoying.  Ruby and Brita handled these women very professionally.  Did they call them out- Yes, and with tact.  And if you are a drunk straight white woman thinking drag queens want to be your friend because, duh, you're you, then yeah you will get called out, too.  (You're not cute)The bartender who Ruby is pretty sure is going to steal her new blonde wig was sweet, perky, fast, professional, and must have learned how to read lips because it gets loud in there.  5 Stars for Ruby Roo and Brita Filter (and her jewel encrusted water pitcher).  Thank you for an amazing show!  We will definitely be coming back when we return to NY.",
1,,9/15/2018,65,,"San Francisco, CA",Alan H.,708,4.0,367,Fun gay bar in NY. It's a smaller bar that packs a fun crowd. They had drag events most nights in the back. Bartenders are friendly. It does get busy. It would be nice if they cleared out tables and chairs during busier times to allow for more room.,

Not sure who the DJ was but in the span of an hour they played three kpop songs (BTS, 2NE1, and another girl group) which made me dance like a psycho. Kudos to them for playing a diversity of music. 2.  They play the music videos to all their songs so it was fun to watch.3.  They are well ventilated and air conditioned. This unfortunately cannot be said for other nearby bars *coughstonewallcough*.",3

I have been going to this bar for a little over a decade (man time flies in NYC) and I do not think that I have ever had a bad time here. Granted, I normally visit this place on week nights or Sunday afternoons when it's not too crowded. For the most part,  the drinks are pretty strong (depending on the bartender) and relatively cheap. During the week, the crowd can be quite diverse, based on race, age, shape, and sexual orientation. For me, Pieces is a great meeting place to grab a few drinks before hitting up a dance spot. Also, it is perfect for spending a relatively relaxed night at the bar. Most of the cliente is very friendly and will spark up a conversation if you are willing. Don't forget about Sunday afternoon Bingo!!!!",1

He pushed me and denied my reentry because I interrupted his conversation (believe he was dealing drugs) as I was leaving for a smoke. This is totally unacceptable and not at all expected at such a bar. Will never set foot in that bar ever again!,1
7,,7/13/2018,99,,"New York, NY",Christopher S.,11,1.0,42,Great Friday night until 8pm. We spent 170 bucks closed our tab and intended to stay. The 8pm bartender grabbed my full drink and threw it away. Mistakes happen right? Well when I explained what happened he scolded me and told me to put a napkin over the drink next time. I'm 42. I've grown up in NYC.thank you kid but I don't need a lesson You need to understand how to bartend. We left and spent our money at the Monster. Better service. Better drinks.,
8,,6/15/2018,276,,"New York, NY",Jason T.,678,4.0,141,"What a piece of work this place is. I've been here before a few times just for a drink or 2. Never made a night out of Pieces. Long, long bar greets you as well as a tight runway to get to some seating or the bathroom. No bells, no whistles, just a great atmosphere with so much heart and history. I met up with a friend a few Sundays ago for Drag Bingo, 5-9pm. We got there at around 6pm and the festivities were well on their way. Massive crowd, drink specials and ball calling all by a deep voiced drag queen on the mic. My type of evening. The bingo sheets are 3 for $5 or $10, I believe. Whoever successfully wins a round is allowed to spin a wheel with a multitude of prizes. Most noted was the $2000 Jackpot space on the wheel. Enticing. There is also a seating area where drinks get brought out to you. The host was soooo articulate and shared an array of personal stories. Between watching Dirty Dancing, RHONY/NJ, doing her musical numbers and calling out numbers, it was all a welcomed riot. Drag Bingo is not to be missed on and every Sunday. Tons of energy and a butt full of fun is what I experienced here. And I am eager for my next visit. Just minimize the amount of pics you take of the host, she can get real sensative and put you on blast.",
9,,3/1/2017,310,5,"Brooklyn, NY",Wanda W.,810,4.0,284,"YASSSS QWEEEENNNNSo This night was my first time going to a drag show! We started at Boots&Saddles ( Yass Prada G. Major, see my review)Once we arrived at Pieces it was about ... ugh 11/ 11:15ish we grabbed some seat and drinks and waited for the show to start. It's a gay bar so there was good music playing and lots of people dancing.The show started at about 12 and that is when this really got fun/interesting. Anyone who has been there before know that the bar itself is not that big and neither is the stage. So the ladies who perform are in a tight space. Our host Dusty Ray Bottoms had a few rules; Have Fun, Drink Up, and STAY OFF THE DANCE FLOOR during her ( +guest) performancesNeedless to say there is always ""THAT ONE drunk ass straight girl"" LMAO and sure enough about 5/10 minutes into the show this drunk ass ""Rebecca from accounting"" was trying to interrupt the show with, I'm not sure what she was doing actually, I think she was trying to dance lol, no sign of rhythm anywhere so idk. Ms. Bottoms but here in her place and continued to shine.There was another Queen, (unfortunately I didn't get her name) and she was great too, she was giving all the Beyonce I needed and more.After a about a 30 minute intermission they came back on stage to a much larger and more intoxicated crowd. Keeping people off the dance floor became a real task and Ms. Bottoms had to stop the show and give folks a lesson on respect and decorum. None the less these ladies slayed and Ms. Bottoms is a wonderful singer.My only problem was after a while the crowd size got to be too much and with that combined with drink specials it was a bad scene so we left before the show end. Aint nobody got bail money hahahahahahahI absolutely loved the show and recommend you see it",
10,,7/9/2018,45,,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",Sarah C.,23,5.0,103,"This is probably my favorite bar in the city. I'm a girl who has mostly gay male friends and for me it's just more fun to go to gay bars (they play better music, have better drinks and no creepy men hit on you), and this one is by far the best. The bartenders are so sweet and the drinks are amazing and cheap. They play great music and the atmosphere in general is so fun. They also have free drag shows which are great and so much fun! The vibe is just so chill and non-judgmental, I've talked to so many cool people in this bar! If you're into gay bars I recommend for sure.",1
11,,7/22/2018,13,,"New York, NY",Mike M.,0,4.0,3,"Love this place. Excellent happy hour, strong pours, cute bartenders. 4-stars because the music is unnecessarily loud. There's really no reason that the music should be so loud as to necessitate screaming across your bar table to have a conversation when there's no dancing or any sort of club atmosphere. Hopefully they'll change it, but I'll be a regular regardless.",
12,,9/4/2017,67,,"New York, NY",Greyson V.,29,3.0,46,"It's a decent gay bar in the west village but it lacks magic. The drag queen hostesses are nice enough with the exception of one, who's jokes are always in poor taste and sadly doesn't ever try writing new material. The new collaboration with Spunk dancers is quite exciting though. They really work the pole which is a ton of fun and the hostess is wonderful.The VJ/DJ is great, service is good and as long as you're ordering at the bar the drinks are quick.For me, there's nothing on a regular night that sets this place apart. With Julius holding down the title of local watering hole, Duplex being the entertainment spot, Monster being the dance/dancer and piano joint... there's not much left. We've met some wonderful people here. I can't complain. It's just not that special. If you're looking for the magic of New York, and it isn't the Spunk dancers night, I'd skip it.",1

It's definitely not my scene.I think a good Drag show should compliment the night, and not be the absolute singular focus.I was just hoping it would end so we could get back to dancing. Even when she promised it was her last song she went on for a good 30 minutes more. Enough already!It was kind of like having a straight-third wheel with you that was like not letting you have the type of night you were looking for.Well drinks $8. Not all that strong. Eh.

I wanted a fun NYC drag show to check out and this was the best one in the area. Note that I said ""best"" and not ""glamorous."" The place is small, but it gets packed super fast and was pretty live when we walked in.The show starts at 11pm, but the place gets packed with guests about an hour or two beforehand. The drinks are cheap, and the waiters took care of us. Man oh man- from start to finish- the show was hilarious!!! There are some talented performers here. From Whitney to Wicked, they entertained us nonstop in two part sessions, with dance moves and voices from out of this world. Since we were in the front, and all decked out in bachelorette gear, they brought me on stage to tease me a little. And I ended up with two free drinks on them! Great times had here. I highly recommend. Music was great, people were friendly and welcoming, and our group of girls had a blast!",8

It's not a bad spot but it was definitely lacking something.To begin, do not go on a Tuesday night. It's pretty slow. The drag show/competition isn't that great. Not that I'm a expert when it comes to drag, but it did seem a little on the amateur side. The interior is your basic gay bar. Red/purple lights and a disco ball. There's no stall in the men's restroom, just urinals.  Not sure why I felt the need to mention that...The music was ok. A mix of some old jams and some new ones. But there was only music playing during the short breaks between the drag performers. The DJ played music after the show but it had gone on for so long that I didn't want to stay when it was over.I did like that they played Pleasantville on the TVs though. It's one of my favorite movies.",2

Phew!  My daughter and faux-son had a great time - only downside was the bathroom fits one at a time and I wondered why everyone took so long in there! I was then told it's because of the red light which makes for some great selfies! Haha!Go when there is a show, you will have a great time!

At least not this kind of unadulterated, high energy, wild and crazy elation. This is Pieces on a Saturday night. And I'm guessing most nights of the week, honestly. Came here on a Saturday night for SINFUL SATURDAYS. And sinful, it was. A friend of a friend discovered Pieces a few months ago and has been coming for the drag show on Saturday nights for weeks now. As soon as I walked in, the allure of this place was immediately apparent. Pieces is loud, colorful and just so damn HAPPY. It's impossible not to smile while you're there. Everyone seems to be having an amazing time - it's just one long party. Not in a snobby/clubby/sleazy way. Like in a pure, life-is-beautiful-and-i'm-embracing-every-second-of-it way. Clearly I had a good time. One warning: you will probably not hear the phrase ""drink responsibly"" while here. This is not to say that people were falling all over the place, but debauchery is certainly encouraged (it's called ""Sinful Saturdays"" after all). Drinks are cheap and you'll find that if you're not careful, you can down a pretty impressive number of them in a pretty short period of time (I personally didn't, just an observation).Now for the music/show - which is why we came in the first place. Both queens were unbelievable. The main girl had a body that most girls would dream of. I was with a group of mostly girls on Saturday night, and we were all quite envious. I wish I could remember her stage name - I think it was a pun on Judy Garland, but I can't recall what it actually was (the other's name was Britta Filter - now that's just brilliant). Judy (I'll just refer to her as that for the purposes of this review) could SING (she did in her first number) but the show itself is mostly lip syncing. They have these interesting ""mixes"" - so it takes more ""skill"" (I'm not entirely sure that lip syncing is a talent, but they make a good case for it here) than your average Lip Sync Battle type deal. In any case, it's fun, it's hilarious, it's fabulous...did I say wow already? I danced, I drank, I sang at the top of my lungs, and I reveled in happiness. YAAAAS QUEENS!!!",7

I've traveled to Europe and when talking to Queens over there, they have flat out asked me why the Queens at Pieces suck so much?Secondly, what the hell is with these drink prices? $10 or $11 for a 8 ounce drink served in a plastic cup and loaded with ice.

Updated review",0,,"New York, NY",Tom S.,0,1.0,1,"To Chad: The Most Miserable Bartender at a Gay Bar In NYC.My friends and I go out often, but there came a certain point where we started to avoid Pieces because of a rude bartender named Chad (bartender wearing the ""Not Today Satan"" hat on June 12). He is especially always there on Sunday nights, so if you and your friends are looking to have a good time at Pieces at the very end of your weekend, avoid sitting at the bar at all costs because his rude behavior and bad energy will be sure to bring you down.The thing is, Pieces has SO many great employees and staff that are professional and welcome you with a smile. But for Chad, I honestly do not know what his issue is. He always has a chip on his shoulder. When my friends and I go out for a drink, all we are looking for is to order our drinks and enjoy ourselves. We look forward to professional service and tipping well for it. However, the last thing we are looking for is a bartender's negative attitude and rude service to distract our good time and bring our overall morale down. But Chad never fails to accomplish this.My friends and I have tried to kill him with kindness. We've even gone out of our way to tip him extra or be super nice to him just to show good will, but it never works. He's always pessimistic and without fail, the rudest bartender we encounter in all the places (both gay and straight) we drink at. I work in the restaurant and service industry, so it boggles my mind that he can be so discourteous and always get away with it, especially in NYC. And after patronizing Pieces today (June 12), we've had enough. He never smiles. He never goes out of his way to be polite. In fact, anytime you ask him a question about a drink or anything in general, he appears extremely irritated and annoyed as if he can't be bothered. He makes rude facial expressions and throws shade constantly. The only time he showed any courtesy to us today was when he dropped our check and said ""thank you,"" which we really weren't sure to make of.My friends and I decided to go out today to spend money and show support at our local bars. But Chad's level of service was disappointing on so many levels, especially since there are so many other gay bars nearby with bartenders who are extremely nice and courteous. Anytime my friends and I go out anywhere else, having to factor rude service into our evening never happens. We just go about our business and all is well. But without a doubt, if we come to Pieces and have to order our drinks through Chad, there will always be a point in our evening where his unprofessional behavior becomes a topic of our conversation, and that's extremely bothersome.To the management of Pieces, my friends and I can't be the only one who are fed up with Chad's rude service. Please know that you are losing business to customers that do not go to your establishment because of him. He gives Pieces a bad reputation, and I will continue to discourage my friends from patronizing your bar because of him. To other Pieces customers who have had terrible service on a Sunday from Chad, you can go to the Pieces website on your smartphone and see his picture. I'm sure I can't be the only one.Dear Chad, just because you're unhappy, please stop bringing down customers who are spending their HARD EARNED money to go out and have a good time.",4

People were still coming in at that hour too!It's a cash only bar which is great since it keeps you from overspending on a card. We paid for drinks as we received them... I couldn't even tell you how many drinks I actually bought that night, but they were inexpensive. They weren't under or over poured. Just be careful not to leave your drinks unattended because they will clear them, even if it's full. Kind of a bummer when it happened to us at one point in the night.The karaoke booklet was pretty extensive, but to be fair I've never had much of a look at one from other places. There were a few tv screens around the bar that displayed the songs lyrics. Pretty sure the other patrons enjoyed our choice of songs.

Was here on a Saturday (09/26/2015) but forgot to post review. Anyways, moving along to the review. It's pretty dark once you walk in but once you get past the entrance, it gets brighter in the seating area with the disco ball and lights. We were greeted upon a drag queen talking and singing to people sitting at the bar. We both got blue moon at $7 each. A dollar more than The Boiler Room and it was the bottle kind. The bathrooms we're pretty small but could still fit 3 urinals; pretty dark being that it was a mix of red and black but still see-able. I do have to say though and I'm sorry but one of the drag queen... was on the mic for far too long. It seemed endless and it felt like she/he was never going to let go. I mean it was fun and entertaining for the first maybe half hour but after that, damn.. please, stop. I mean the guy had a really nice voice, until their 'solo' came on and lip sync'd instead, really? I mean, their lip syncing was on point, you wouldn't be able to tell that they weren't singing from afar but when they come up to you or that you're right next to them, you can tell they're not singing. But other than that, it was a fun and enjoyable night. I do like the ambiance in this gay bar though, I give props to the pink hair'd pom pom guy who came by several times to check whether we'd like to order more drinks which was really nice, but then again, the bar itself wasn't exactly full to the brim either but still nice; one big thumbs up!

If rainbows and glitter and sequins and mylar offend your sensibilities, please remove yourself uptown to Chelsea.  You just won't like it, and I don't want to see your scrunched up nose as you tell your fey friends how you can't believe you're in PIECES, for god's sake.  Just leave. Buh-bye!Now that we have the fun people, I can tell you, I have spent many long nights at Pieces, but I barely remember any of it.  For a while, in the late 90s, it was like there was a magnet in my butt and the bar stool was made out of solid lead.  Any time I passed 6th and Christopher, I gravitated there.  ""Just one drink, then I'll go straight home.""  Three hours later, I would be apologizing for spilling my drink all over the pool table and charming Brian into a buyback.  Or flashing. Or making out with friends.  Or having such a deep conversation with a total stranger that we would both be crying.  That's Pieces!I have boycotted Pieces twice, for periods of 6 months and 2 years.  Don't ask why.  Drama under the bridge.  I always went back, though.  I suspect they put crack in the drinks.I met my best friend there, but we never did anything outside the bar for the first three years we were friends.  On the day between our birthdays (we're two days apart) we had a party in the back room. I still think of John as the new guy.Pieces is a neighborhood bar.  It refrains from judgment.  Their motto: ""No Cover, No Minimum, No Attitude.""  If you're getting attitude in there, you deserve it.  Pieces is the bar that has benefited most from the smoking ban.  I smoke, but Pieces was so smoky back in the day that you could walk in, say ""hi"" to the bartender, walk out, and even your underwear would smell like smoke.  Now it just smells like beer.  Except the bathrooms, which is where my favorite bar loses a star.  The bathrooms are ridiculous, Eric!  Floods, broken doors, so many problems, and so freaking smelly.  A LOT of girls go here, especially on karaoke night; why not try a little with the unisex bathroom.  Even the men's bathroom is hideous.What else can I say about the place where the events of my life have been played back in a loop of drunken confessions for the past 11 years?  The drinks have gotten a little expensive. Sorry guys.  But if you like well booze, the happy hour is a steal!  Plus, they probably still have Martini Madness on Wednesdays.  The entertainment is always a blast.  Remember, both Jimmy James and Porsche used  to headline here!  If you get there early, you can get a seat at the bar or a table.  There is always good music if you enjoy gay dance music, and getting to know the bartenders is easy and a big plus to your evening.The upshot: if you want to HAVE FUN.  If you are not paranoid about people talking to you or bumping into you.  If you have a good sense of humor and a strong liver.One for my homies, Jimmy, Charlie, Frank, Big Blanche.  If I should stay, I would only be in your way, Pieces.  I will always love you.",3

Cons: It's a dive bar without the cozy atmosphere. On the night I was there (Saturday) it was very, very crowded. I spent most of my time there shuffling about so people could move by me.

129,,4/10/2011,81,,"New York, NY",Jay B.,9,5.0,177,"Love it. Totally dive-y gay bar. Weekend drink specials are of the ""Are we sure we're still in Manhattan"" type.  $3 for a Kir Royale, Margarita, amongst other things.  Balls to the wall bingo with VodKa Stinger on Sundays can seriously be the highlight of the week. You better play your cards right so to speak because if you don't you WILL be called out (deservedly so).  In-between calling numbers there is always New York based pop culture talk, from celebrities, to Drag Race, to musicals to how much the MTA sucks. We got to see her show on a Monday night as well with Talulah De'Bayous and that was a riot as well.  I love meeting people who share my sense of humor naturally and they are great.  Service at the bar is always as prompt as it can be and even more prompt if you can score a table in the back.  Haha. I just laughed out loud remembering two remarks that are probably won't work well in print. You have to go see for yourself.",

They are very friendly(you dont find many friendly people in the service industry) and make a great cocktail. Chris and Danny give great conversation, John pumps some of the best sounds and sings like not many caucasian men can and Joey , well joey shouts ""IMMA VIRGIN"" all shift long. Really they are great guys!",
131,,4/10/2010,111,,"Manhattan, NY",David L.,0,2.0,32,"I can't put my finger on why, but I just don't like Pieces. Might be the crowd (generally not very friendly in my experience), might be the music (way too loud for such a small space, and a little too rap-heavy for a gay bar, imho). The drinks are cheap and strong, though, so I'm sure I'll be back.",1
132,10,12/5/2007,276,11,"Los Angeles, CA",Arnab M.,238,4.0,619,"Apart from the creepy and short man who repeatedly tried to push up against Billy A. and me last night, trying to create a sandwich, I liked this place. I literally PUSHED him away, quite dismissively, more than once! But apparently that persistently daft fellow didn't get the message. I really do not  appreciate unattractive men grinding up against my ass anywhere, repeatedly. It was karaoke night, and it was Sam P. and Scott B.'s idea to head to Pieces after the Yelp Holiday Party at APT. Good choice folks, except for the decision to walk all the way form APT. Scott B.'s rendition of the KT Tunstall's ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree"" was absolutely fabulous, the icing on an excellent night! Kudos, Scott! The other singers didn't quite match up but weren't bad, and the drag queen hostess was really nice and cool, and a little puzzling for Billy A. as she is probably the first drag queen he didn't know in New York.",9
133,,5/8/2010,4,,"Brooklyn, NY",Benjamin K.,0,5.0,15,"This place bills itself as a laid back gay dive bar and offers exactly that.  The well drinks are around $2 during happy hour but you may feel the beginnings of a hangover after the first drink - their well liquor is extremely cheap.  Prices don't go up too much even after happy hour -  a vodka tonic will only cost you $4.  They tend to have a great fun loving staff comprised largely of attractive men, though that may depend on your taste.  Music varies from pop to rap to Dolly Parton depending entirely on which staff member is controlling the music and the crowd is on average the youngest in the West Village.  Their Tuesday karaoke night is (or at least was) consistently their busiest night of the week and is a ton of fun for karaoke virgins and veterans alike.  There's usually something going on each night of the week, and it's usually very fun.  My only complaints are the occasionally sketchy crowd members and crappy well liquor - but hey, the prices on the better booze isn't too bad anyway.",
