0,Richard L.,"Queens, NY",825,717,14,5.0,10/25/2018,"I'll definitely come back here for a super cool sexy lounge to take someone to impress them with my knowledge of seemingly secret speakeasy joints in the city.  So what is this place?  It's a bar/lounge that feels super exclusive with its somewhat secluded group seating areas.  It's grand without feeling over the top, showing an antique chic decor that still feels modern.You walk in and are greeted by a young lady who walks you to the bar while she gets a spot ready for you to sit.  The bartenders are amazing, they are almost clairvoyant in their way they make drinks specifically for you if you don't want something off the menu and their drinks are awesome.  I'd want this place to stay open, but i don't want it to get crowded and presumptuous.  But definitely give this place a shot!",2,,1
1,Jen L.,"Cypress, CA",387,320,607,4.0,10/30/2018,"We initially had a little trouble finding this place - we ended up in a hotel/hostel where the attendant informed us the entrance was the black door next door. Except it wasn't...confusingly enough, there are two black doors right next to each other, and we wasted a good 10 minutes trying to force our way into the wrong one lol. We eventually figured it out. You ring the buzzer and wait for the hostess to come greet you. We were seated pretty much right away. The seating arrangements were pretty interesting - you either sit at the bar or in one of the couches facing each other. It was a little awkward because we were directly seated across another couple with only a small table to separate us. But other than that, I liked the intimate and cozy vibe. Cocktails were good and strong (at least the ones we tried). It was refreshing to be able to have a conversation without loud music blaring, which is one of my bar pet peeves. Out of every ""speakeasy"" I've been to, this bar felt the most authentic - like I've been transported back to the Prohibition era. P.S. Take a look @ the bathroom wallpaper for a nice surprise.",4,1,2
2,John S.,"San Diego, CA",2642,199,1121,3.0,10/30/2018,"One of many speakeasies in Manhattan... this one is located on kind of a sketchy street where not very many other businesses are. I do like the fact that it's kinda easy to miss, just like a real speakeasy would. Go into door 48 and walk down the steps. Walking into the speakeasy, I LOVE how dark it is in there! It was probably one of the darkest bars I've ever been in, which makes for great intimate conversation. The bar wasn't that crowded, but for some reason they sat us at a table with two other people... so that intimate vibe quickly went away. We were now so close in proximity to other people, that they could hear our conversation and vice versa. The whole pulling the chord on the wall for service sounded like it would be a great idea if it didn't take 10 minutes to respond. Our server rarely checked on us and when we did finally order drinks... it literally took 25 mins to get them. To wait that long for a $17, it had better be the best drink I've ever had. NOPE! My drink tasted like someone poured dish soap into it. I actually couldn't finish it. We immediately wanted to leave, so we pulled the chord to get our check. That was another 15 minute process. I love the location, the dark ambience was great, and the decor was on point. The proximity we were to other people, the long wait times, and the awful tasting expensive drinks are what would make me not recommend this place. It has a ton of potential but needs to go a long way to meet it. 3/5 Stars for unfulfilled potential but great ambience.",18,9,18

They serve a variety of pricy, quality, and potent cocktails, as well as some wines and beers.Service is very quick, responsive, and helpful with recommending drinks. The venue is quiet and dark, with several curtained booths for large parties, as well as a bar and a few couches. It's a good date spot.  You might want a reservation if you don't want to wait.

5,Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1726,624,4345,5.0,6/26/2018,"I loved this bar/speakeasy.We decided to check this place out on the spur of the moment. You enter thru the unmarked door and walk down the stairs . Ring the doorbell. Someone will greet you and let you know how long the wait is. It took about 15mins for us. Once you enter- its like you enter into the Prohibition Era. It's dark and cozy. Seating is plush and comfortableYou call your waitress/waiter via a chain you pull on the way to light up the assistance button. Staff is very knowledgeable and on their cocktail game for sure. They made me want to touch up on some cocktail lingo and terminology! Benjamin was awesome - he helped us find something perfect to order. I got the ""crimson fix"" and it was delicious!  Others got the "" Rebel Isle"" , the Manhattan and something that the bartender made up .... and everyone LOVED their drinks. The bathroom is small but quaint except the the wall paper design that is you look closely- it imaging having sex in different positions lol. See photos Drinks are pricey $16 but they are delicious well made drinks. If you come with a larger group on like 4-6 , you would most likely be seated in these little areas that have curtains for more privacy. It looks cool and intimate :) Will definitely be back again",17,5,13
6,Sabrina L.,"New York, NY",212,141,281,5.0,9/17/2018,Love this speakeasy. Had a blast with my friends here last weekend. You start by ringing the doorbell and waiting for someone to open the door. We put our name on the waitlist and was promptly called when they had space avail for us. When you walk in it looks like you are transported back in time of great gastby. Loved the decor! They had a table ready for us and to call someone over you pull the chain under the doorbell. The drinks were delicious. And the staff was friendly. We stayed there for hours hanging out and chatting. I would definitely come back again!,5,,
7,John D.,"New York, NY",97,230,215,5.0,8/21/2018,"One of the coolest places I've been in a while. Hidden speakeasy on 17th street. You have to ring the bell to be let in. You're then guided to your own little velvet couch.  It's very intimate and dark. They play old 20's, 30s style music. You have to ring a bell for service and to place your orders. The cocktails are delicious and made well. It's truly like stepping back in time to the roaring 20s.",1,,
8,Tori Z.,"Seattle, WA",8,136,244,5.0,8/13/2018,"Take a step back in time to this speakeasy style bar where the decor is classy and every drink is amazing. I should mention that you'll never get served a drink if you don't hear you waiter give instructions. It took us a while to realize you have to push a button on the other side of the table where another couple is to get the waiter to come and take our drinks. If you do know that though, this is one of the coolest and best bars. The perfect spot for a quiet date night.",1,1,
9,Kay W.,"New York, NY",1,161,10,3.0,8/2/2018,Made reservations for a Monday night. It was easy to do and we were seated promptly. It was just the two of us so we had to share a section with another couple. I can't say I loved it. That couple was on a hot and heavy date- I won't give the play by play- and the cozy ambience of RL made the two of them all the more comfy. I just wanted a nice night of sipping on well-made cocktails w crystal clear ice. -- The ice here is beautiful by the way. Super clear. You can see into a parallel dimension when you gaze into one of their cubes. Beautiful. Anyone. Quiet. Dark. Saucy wallpaper. Decent cocktails. Pricey in the way cocktail bars and speakeasies are. It was fine. Didn't know we'd have to share a space. Would have preferred to sit at the bar or gone elsewhere.,2,,
10,Yelena M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,7,5.0,11/16/2018,"Exceptional cocktails , sexy ambiance and a well structured waiting list system. Cannot complain, some of the best drinks I ever had,. Yes we waited 45Minutes, but the waiting list was legitimate and the host was very professional",,,
11,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,3/6/2018,"Nice ambiance. Hidden speakeasy. Down the stairs to an unmarked door...ring the doorbell...best to have a reservation. Greeted at the door. A bit overhyped but worth a visit. Romantic mood lighting, comfy couches, antique decor. Cocktails are expertly made and beautifully presented. I had a sherry and coconut cocktail which was just the right amount of sweet and delicious.There's a small bar in back, standing only. The place itself is small and while romantic, if you're a party of two you'll be sitting communal style, sharing your space and table with two perfect strangers. Casual dress. Minus one star for the inattentive, uninterested, less than enthused waitress.",4,,5
12,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,422,1424,4.0,3/14/2018,"What a classy speakeasy! One step inside and you feel like you've been transported to the Prohibition era - the lighting is dim, the decor is vintage, and the whole vibe feels romantic and intimate.Although the speakeasy isn't exactly hidden (especially during the winter with the vestibule outside), it was still fun ringing the doorbell in anticipation. My friends and I came by around 5:15pm on a Tuesday and had no problems getting a table for four. By around 6/6:30pm, the place was packed!Drinks here were both interesting and delicious; all were around $16 each, which is a tad pricey but you're also paying for the experience. To get your server's attention, all you need to do is pull the chain on the call button and your server will come over almost immediately.Throughout the night we never felt rushed and the bar never felt overly crowded. Our waitress was also so sweet and accommodating! Really loved the atmosphere here - it's perfect for a dinner date or just a nice spot for a few drinks with friends.",1,,
13,German M.,"Miami, FL",733,247,1489,4.0,1/8/2018,"I visited without a reservation on a Friday and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. The waiting area wasn't comfortable as we waited by the chimney (in the back) with 3 other people. However, the wait was worth it because the cocktails were delicious. They do provide a great selection or you may describe your current mood and they will craft something to your liking. Cocktails cost $16.Dim lighting sets the mood for small parties or dates so I would not mind coming back.",10,4,8
14,Yuan S.,"Jamaica, NY",10,24,15,5.0,9/16/2018,"This place is intimidating, dark and amazing! The lovely part is that customers need to ring a doorbell and get on wait list in order to enter into the subterranean space. The wait was approximately 30-45 minuets. But the following 4 hours definitely worth the wait. The quality and subtlety of the cocktails make it likely that you will fall in love of this place.

15,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,5.0,1/3/2018,"Holy smokes, is this place sexy!  I love speakeasies in general and Raines Law Room doesn't disappoint.  I like that it's hidden enough to feel exclusive, but doesn't require you to do anything over-the-top like call a secret telephone number or memorize a password.  Once you locate the front door down a short flight of steps, all you have to do is ring the doorbell and the host will answer.  If you're lucky, you will be led right in to a table.  If (much, much more likely) you are unlucky, your name and number will be taken down and you will be texted when a table is ready.We showed up around 7pm on a Wednesday, when it's first come, first served.  We were told the wait would be 30 minutes.  A little over an hour went by before we got our long-awaited text that our table was ready, and that they would hold our spot for 15 minutes.  Needless to say, we hurried on back.When we arrived the second time that evening, our table actually still wasn't ready, so we were escorted to the bar in the back to wait.  We ordered drinks and stood around for about 10 or so minutes before our table was ready.  The wait didn't bother me because I appreciated that Raines kept the place from becoming overly crowded/noisy, and that patrons were allowed to sit and stay for as long as they liked.  Plus I knew that once my butt hit that couch, I was staying put.The drinks are all very well-made and decently strong.  I love that the menu is organized by flavor profiles; it makes ordering so much simpler.  They do not have a food menu, but they do offer a small snack platter of olives, cheese, and soppressata.  The process of ordering is great; you pull on the little chain on the wall and, like magic, the waitress appears to take your order.  Our particular waitress was great; after we paid our bill, she came around with cocktail shots for us before we left.Love love love, and I'll definitely be back!",7,1,4
16,N And N K.,"New York, NY",7,183,0,4.0,11/2/2018,Went here on a rainy Friday night and waited about 20-25 mins for a table....we requested a booth but were given a 2 chair setup which was nice. Totally understand as the place was packed and as soon as someone left another table walked in. Let me say the drinks here are good and strong but we only got to do 1 round as we had plans for dinner on the LES....the service was good as we were approached 5 mins into settling in and were given ample time or should I say were not bothered throughout the night until we grabbed the wait staffs attention. This place is not an all nighter as no food is available and 2 rounds is more the enough....I only speak for myself....that said we would come again down the road....lose a point as some tapas would have been nice.....,1,,
17,Kangil L.,"Queens, NY",54,14,5,5.0,9/8/2018,"This place is in my top 3 of favorite speaks in the city. It's simple and elegant, with an addictive atmosphere. It can be crowded at times but the layout of the place make it seem like your space is invisible to others. Drinks are on the pricey side. But you definitely get what you pay for. Perfect for date nights and medium group outings.Initially thought I would be there for couple hours but the experience froze time and sped it up to 4 hours. I highly recommend any of their mezcal drinks and try their bar food nibblers.",2,,

Updated review","This great speakeasy wasn't even on our list to check out but after 3 other places we had planned on were either closed or had lines out the door, we did a quick Yelp search and came upon the Raines Law Firm and we got so lucky it was so wonderful.While not the most hidden speakeasy in the city it was still a fun search to find. Once to to get the correct door, you'll still need to ring the law firm door bell to be welcomed in. I imagine his is one way they keep a line from forming on busy nights. Luckily, we were there on a Sunday at 11:30pm and didn't have a wait. While I was there with a friend, the setting would be perfect for a date as the tables were intimate and closed off by sheer curtains. You'd ring a fun little chain to get service. Their cocktail menu was full of fun drinks but our waiter encouraged us to tell them which drinks looked good to us and let the bartender come up with a fun and delicious concoction. Always one who loves surprises, we went with it and it was an excellent choice! My drink was a reminiscent of a Paloma and it was amazing! I would highly recommend a visit to Raines for anyone interested in a great throwback speakeasy with top notch craft cocktails!",,,
19,Anne M.,"Wilmington, NC",63,143,134,5.0,9/22/2018,This place was rad!!!  I'm definitely a fan of cocktail speakeasies.  Raines Law is the most fun I've found on my travels.  It's super hard to find (it was for us).  Uber will drop you off right in front of the door but I don't believe there is a sign (speakeasy).  You go down a flight of stairs from the sidewalk and ring the bell.  A host welcomes you into a dark room.  She draws the curtain and leads you down a dimly lit aisle to your couch or plush chair.  You'll pull a chain for service and someone magically appears to take your order.  It's a great experience.  The cocktails are mucho expensiv-o.  But they are delicious.  Worth it.,,,
20,Gene L.,"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, NY",493,311,673,5.0,11/10/2017,"With the surfeit of stellar cocktail bars in the city, if I had to pick one favorite, it would probably be Raines Law Room - a combination of great cocktails, attentive yet unobtrusive service, and an intimate ambiance.During peak times the place can get busy and you might have to wait a little bit, but it's not too bad because often you can wait in the bar in the back and order drinks while you wait for seats to be ready. If you know in advance you'll be in the area, you can make reservations online. The place never gets too noisy, and I love how at this bar you can actually have a conversation without much effort or struggle with hearing the other person. Seats are comfy too. Service can be requested by pulling the little string next to your table - works well, because you get your privacy and you never have to wait to get your next drink order in. I rarely have been disappointed by any of the cocktails I've been served. My current favorite is probably the Whiskey Business - a cocktail with whiskey, chile liquer, cinnamon, bitters; it's perfect!Consistently one of my favorite places to grab a drink and meet up with friends!",12,7,9

Thankfully we had a short wait and they were able to accommodate us! What an awesome speakeasy! The atmosphere is incredible, I was lucky enough to be seated on a large couch and it was extremely comfortable! Dim lighting and a very chill intimate vibe! Drinks were all delicious. I started with the Huntington Street. I'm a high ice snob with my drinks and I have to say that I was highly impressed with the ice cubes in each drink! The small details really do count! Excellent service, you pull down on a cord when you're ready to order your next round making it simple and stress free! Highly recommend!",,,

I've spent more time with friends catching up then dates but it's dim lighting makes it good for dates. I love that the waitresses are able to recommend custom combinations based your flavor/liquor preferences just as bartenders. On the most recent visit, the mixologist at the bar had me try something I would have never tried but to my surprise I liked. Sadly, when we were at the table (not bar) we had to flag people down to get service (when it was empty & when it had people). Therefore, service has declined some.",3,,

So we decided to walk around to kill sometime . As we entered the space it felt very intimate and an escape from the hustle and bustle of New York City . We were seated in a corner which we had all to ourselves. We had so much to discuss and talk about from our long and stressful week and once we settled in we felt so much better and relax in just being in the space.We felt so comfortable and welcomed by all the ladies and it really made our night .

26,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2296,4007,5.0,10/23/2017,"I was meeting my buddy and I suggested this place around 17th and 6th.  I knew it was hard to find but I didn't expect it to seem so bougie.  The door is covered with a large nice new awning marked 48.You wait as a woman opens the door like it's a house and lets people in one at a time.An herbal perfume wafts from inside - a soothing combination of bergamot maybe and maybe anais.  It reminded me of a 70s adult house party somehow.  Intimate and sexy yet friendly and social.   The whole vibe was Suzanne Plushette or Sheilds and Yarnell - Charlie's Angels secret meeting spot.  Sex. Mystery. Intrigue. When the host answered the door we went inside and set our bags down into the foyer.She then walked us back to the kitchen. We walked through a hallway past private seating areas that was decked out in a brown and sleek silver color scheme  - chocolate brown seatees - 2 facing each other shared a small table and had a swingers feel - and the mystery of a 1950s speakeasy. We went back to the kitchen.  It was a modern clean space with a cute polished bartender that was just hipster enough and just throw back enough.It's craft cocktail time so tell them what you want or order from the menu.  Drinks are $16 each so just be prepared and chalk it up to experience.   After 2 drinks and a tip it's around $45.  I had a mezcal negroni and we went back to our seat.  I felt kinda silly taking my buddy here cause every couch were hetero couples except for us - a straight guy and a mostly gay guy. But really tho we felt like we were on vacation.   I love the mod 70s chic decor, I love the intimate adult house party feel, and the drinks were textbook - if a little on tedious side - things are taken pretty seriously in the cocktail world - but it's just liquor.  Our staff was friendly and personal - not pretentious. This place wasn't exactly what I expected.It felt more intimate adult experience rather than ""New York lounge"".  Even tho it's basically bougie everyone one in there was sweet and ""real"".  Summary This is a great place for a date, or a special drink for an occasion or just an uplifting experience.",5,3,8

I went on a weekday and got a drink named Pegu Club (no affiliation to the establishment in Soho) and it as a greet recommendation by the bartender. We chatted it up for a bit before my friend arrived. Shortly thereafter we were ushered to one of the seating areas where we continued to drink more.

30,Renée G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",348,324,1202,4.0,4/5/2018,"Raines Law Room has been one of my favorite NYC speakeasys to visit over the years. The staff is friendly and not pretentious unlike some some places. There is usually a little wait after work hours when you ring the doorbell. Once inside you really do feel like you've stepped into another era and are in a secret apartment having illegal booze. I've ended up standing in the back bar area more often than not, but have also gotten a couch on some visits. Getting a seat can actually be more awkward than standing if you are just two. The only seating are couches which face across from each other. Last time I was seated across from some 20 somethings making out who were hard to ignore. Back to the important thing: the booze. The drink menu here is endless. There are pages of amazing sounding concoctions for you to chose from separated by theme (light, bourbon based, flowery etc) at $16 each. There is also a wine and spirit list for those who don't want cocktails. I don't really think you can go wrong with any cocktail here and for $16 you better not.

35,Jordan M.,"Louisville, KY",56,180,23,5.0,4/17/2018,"Okay... this place was cool. I found Raines in yelp when looking for ""hidden restaurants"" planning our trip to NY. We stopped in on a Monday night after dinner. It was around 9pm and yet it was quite busy. We were seated next to some locals that said this was typical as most NEw Yorkers go out during the week to avoid the tourists on weekends. The atmosphere was the first thing I noticed. The room was dimly lit, the decor mimicked prohibition era. One of my favorite parts was that you pull a string to turn on a light so the editor knows you're ready to order. It was great to have service come quick when you needed them but not bother you otherwise. Speaking of the service, their waiter was fantastic. The do not sell food but have a quite extensive cocktail lists. I love tequila but none of the cocktails on the list seemed to exactly what I was looking for although I didn't know what that was. I describe what I was feeling: a refreshing margarita, not too strong with some spice. My fiancé describe he wanted a bourbon cocktail, not bitter, not too sweet, but with some hints of fruit or citrus. He said I got it. When he brought us our drinks it was exactly what we didn't know we wanted. They were perfect and delicious. I think those were some of he best cocktails I have had. Cheers to their bartender. The dress was kind of all over the place. I saw some people hanging out in a T-shirt and jeans although I thought that it felt more like a ""dressy casual"" place. They also had a coat check which was nice since the space is kind of small.",,,

41,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,5.0,11/17/2017,"Came around 815pm on a Saturday night and was quoted a 45 minute wait. They text you when the table is ready and hold it for 15 minutes. Loved the atmosphere! It's quite dim and each booth is separated by curtains. This bar doesn't try to cram everyone in and is strict on the max occupancy. Another huge plus is that the noise level is surprisingly low and makes it easy to have a conversation. Cocktails here are well crafted and extremely smooth.Yanking the chain immediately gets a waiter to the table, can't ask for better service than that.",4,1,3
42,Alexandra W.,"New York, NY",132,14,7,5.0,8/1/2018,"Probably the coolest little speak easy around. The cocktails are excellent, the service efficient, and the ambiance- super quaint, prohibition era-esq. It is a dark, cozy watering hole that offers a healthy list of superb adult beverages.

43,Casey S.,"Queens, NY",0,12,0,4.0,10/9/2018,Top notch cocktails. Perfect for small intimate groups. A great replace to catch up with friends after work or who are in from out of town. I often stop here when friends from Cali visit or with local friends after theater.  The cocktail menu is really your guide and I recommend you pick from that. Especially the staff suggestions area. Ever changing but always u changes is this lovely atmosphere and polite and knowledgable staff,,,
44,John W.,"Portland, OR",44,72,146,5.0,12/27/2017,"We sought out The Raines Law speakeasy for a cozy late night for two. We managed to get right in and spent a long evening there! This is a wonderful place. It is cozy and friendly. The servers only attend to you when you press the call button. This keeps the environment cozy so you can chat, undisturbed, with your significant other or lover. Try to get one of the semi-private areas with curtains for an even more romantic spot. And, don't miss the bathroom wallpaper. :-)",1,,
45,Mike H.,"New York, NY",389,63,814,5.0,5/20/2017,"Amazing, magical experiences!Raines Law Room is probably one of the less well known speakeasy in NYC. The bartender was really responsive, when I walked in, there are people in front of me ordering drinks, but the bartender saw me walked in and immediately let me know that he will be with me shortly. (This is really a plus because most of the NYC bars are so crowded and you gonna have a hard time to even get the bartender's attention)The drinks are complex and very strong in a good way. The lighting is dark and the seats are very private. You can't really see or hear the other customers. This really separates RLR from other bars in NYC. Ordering new drinks is fun, simply pull the bell on the wall and the waitstaff will come to the table side to take your order.Overall, a upscale, sophisticated speakeasy that is great for dates. Tips:- I won't recommend this place if your group have more than 4 people- if they don't have a table open, you can drink at the bar first to wait for it",2,1,2
46,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3652,952,2095,5.0,10/29/2017,one of the best speakeasies in nyc. Getting a reservation can be tough but worth it. You feel like you are transported back to the prohibition days. Quiet environment here that is perfect for a date spot.  The drinks are on point. The bartenders know their stuff so ask for any recommendations. Drinks take a little to get to you but are awesome.Definite 5 star place.,4,2,3
47,Jenn W.,"San Jose, CA",162,762,731,5.0,11/28/2017,"This place reminds me of the speakeasy that we have back home except it is 100% sexier and more intimate.  And, it doesn't hurt that the drinks are delicious and the service is stellar.",1,1,1
48,Aveeda G.,"Parker, CO",199,364,1637,5.0,10/26/2017,"My very first taste at this Speakeasy lifestyle that I am SO happy to know was brought to me by The Raines Law Room. On a whirlwind day trip to NYC, my girlfriends and I stopped in before our bus trip back to Northern VA. What a perfect way to end our fun-filled 90 degree day. The door outside is unmarked (of course) and once you ring the bell, you are escorted in. It is dark and cozy inside and while we waited for our table/nook, we ordered a drink at the bar in the back. The tables/nooks/I can't think of the best word to describe it are definitely private complete with a curtain to close you off from anyone else in the place. This was perfect for my friends and I and probably even more so for the couple on a date at the table next door. Pull the string above the small table at your booth for the server and more drinks and make sure you visit the restroom and take a nice close look at the wallpaper - it's naughty! Great service and strong drinks like the Marie Antoinette, aptly named with large crushed ice piled on top resembling the namesake's coifed hair, The Raines Law Room definitely whisks you back to the 20s. Highly recommend.",4,,2

Place still keeps its speakeasy vibe, cocktails still yummy and def one of the best in the city. Service was efficient tho not necessarily welcoming. If that would be all, I would be generous enough to give it a four. But we were slugged in a double couch section sharing with another couple who were total strangers. It got worse. The two started to make out before their drinks even arrived...As much I tried not to pay attention, they were sitting about 3 feet from us. My man, whose hands on me,  was peeping the couples from the corner of his eyes, distracted. Hey I am here! Look at me! So awkward....our night was ruined :( The whole point of going to speakeasy rather than a bar or club, is intimacy and being ""hidden"". For that reason I prefer Dear Irving. At least there are beaded curtains to separate.",3,4,1

51,Diego M.,"Springfield, NJ",296,139,270,5.0,6/5/2018,"Absolutely my favorite speakeasy in the whole city. The ambiance is spot on, with perfectly dim lighting, appropriate level music, personal small areas with little privacy curtains, and some of the most amazing mixology I've had the pleasure of imbibing in. I like that it feels very private and they text you when your table is ready. There's a few places nearby to go to also while you wait. They are expanding so I'm excited to see the changes!",,,
52,Natasha P.,"Carol Stream, IL",93,230,1439,5.0,12/19/2017,"If you walked past this place you wouldn't even know it existed but it was a really cool ""hole in the wall"".... literally. It was very 1920s speakeasy style. We had to put our name on a waiting list, and they contacted us via text within 30 mins even though it was a Saturday night, which I would consider a typical busy night in most cases. once we walked in we were about to order a drink at the bar since the table was not ready yet, and they drinks were amazing. They were all unique and if you didn't like your drink for whatever reason they would make you another drink (which did happen to us while we were there). The atmosphere inside is very nice, great date night spot!",,,
53,Michael C.,"New York, NY",262,171,129,5.0,10/9/2017,"This is the kind of establishment that you only think exists in movies. Raines Law Room is an underground, hidden speakeasy-type of bar located just off of 6th avenue. When you walk down 17th street, you might just miss it if you're not careful. There are no signs and no windows- just a black owning covering a few steps that lead down to a door. You ring the bell and the doorman respectfully greets you to add your name to the list.Inside it's dark, intimate, and cozy. When you get in, you'll likely be taken straight to the bar which is a classy kitchen. You can socialize here, peruse the drinks and watch the bartenders make their masterpieces.After they are ready for you in the sitting area, the host or hostess will guide you to your seats. Again, you can peruse the menu and ring a bell to call your server over when you're ready.Five of us went and we each got two drinks, so I got to try a total of 10. Each one was excellent. I like it spicy, so my personal favorite was definitely the Ol' Pepper. Clever cocktail if you're looking for something unique and savory. The only improvement I could think on the drinks would be to make them a little less citrusy- I felt this was a common trend among the drinks I tried.Overall, this place was worth the hype. I will definitely be returning and also look forward to trying out the William's location next time.",2,,1

No reservations but they take our number and text you when they have a spot available. This bar is legit. They'll get you in the back where the bar is and chill out until they get you a table. One my favorites for meticulously made alcoholic beverages that will test your senses in the best way possible.",1,1,1
56,Susan C.,"New York, NY",61,214,798,5.0,10/29/2017,"Didn't understand the hype until I tried their cocktails for the first time two weeks ago. Came here with 3 friends and we each got a different drink, including one that was a unique mixologist creation. This is one friend's favorite lounge in the city--he swears by the drinks--each special and perfectly balanced. My friends came about an hour and a half prior to 10pm to put their names on the list, after dinner at a nearby restaurant we headed over and we're escorted to the bar area to await the next table opening. We ordered drinks at the bar then brought them over to our table. The dim, romantic ambience reminded of a Victorian parlor with various cozy seating areas. About a dozen sets of plush seats and sofas encircled their own central coffee table, creating enclaves of conversation. Several of the seating areas had a bit more privacy with the addition of curtains between booths. What is most outstanding is the service here. Always courteous and classy. Each table can stay and enjoy without feeling pressured to leave or being crowded out by taking revelers above capacity. You can legitimately enjoy your fabulous drink while holding audible conversations with your friends. Now that's hard to find in NYC.",1,,

59,Zin R.,"Atlanta, GA",198,32,69,4.0,6/1/2017,"Enter into this very sus place that looks like an entrance to a classy midtown basement apartment. Slightly apprehensive, we rang the doorbell and was told there was a 45 min wait for entrance into this low key spot. No worries, we gave our phone number and received a text for an open spot about 45 min later after taking High end whiskey shots up the street. The mysterious door opens and we enter this dimly lit foyer where we are asked to store our bags and coats free of charge due to the quaint spaces. The curtain opens and you see the most intimate rooms with suede brown couches perfect for a small group with chiffon brown curtains for privacy. It's pretty dope because you are directed to your little nook. Handed the menu and told to push the bell for service.There so many choices and the prices are not terrible. Now, the drinks are so well crafted and worth. From virgin to alcoholic. I don't want to give any spoilers but the spring drink with banana liqueur is to die for (SN: definitely forgot the name but it's in the island section) Anyway, stop reading and go check this spot out!",,,
60,Tanya D.,"Boston, MA",89,175,130,5.0,9/12/2017,"So cool! We came here on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy. You ring the door bell to enter into the completely unsuspecting bar, and so right from the start it is exciting! When you walk in you feel like you are transported into another time. We only came for one drink because I was so tired, but wish we could have spent longer. The vibe here is just awesome. It's cozy and can be private, for a while we sat on our brown couch in the booth by ourselves. After a while a couple girls sat on the couch across from us. Love the 20's and 30's music they were playing fromSwing to Jazz. Definitely completed the ambience. The bartender was SUPER friendly loved him! The server was also very nice and super helpful. I had the Sherry Colada which was delicious! My boyfriend had the Old Fashioned and said it was the best he ever had. They have a pretty extensive list of cocktails. The atmosphere is super relaxing. Once you are ready to order you pull the cord in your booth and your server comes which was fantastic. Definitely a must do!",3,,2

62,Ceecee Y.,"New York, NY",277,157,88,5.0,4/14/2018,"Raines Law Room may now be my favorite speakeasy in New York City. To get in, you ring the doorbell of a nondescript door. (The door attendant will let one group in at a time.) The decor of the speakeasy is very moody, intimate, and cozy. The seating in the speakeasy is very interesting. They have a bar in the back and ""rooms"" of two couches (that seat maybe 3 people per couch) that face each other with a little table in between. The ""rooms"" are separated by a sheer curtain. It can be a little odd going to Raines Law Room with one other person because you're seated next to each other on the couch and if the speakeasy is busy, they will seat random people across from you. To order your drink, you pull the string on the wall. The drinks at Raines Law Room are absolutely fantastic and they have a great selection.",1,,

Updated review","One of my first speakeasies that I visited while i lived in New York. Slightly difficult to find initially but now with increasing popularity, there's usually people standing around the entrance.It's a whole different world when you walk inside. Prohibition style era with cozy couches. There's also a standing bar area in the back if you want to see them making cocktails.Extensive drinks menu. The prices are on the steeper side but one thing i know after coming here a couple of times is that the drinks over here are pretty stiff.Its better to make reservations before you arrive, else there's usually a 30 min wait. Best time to arrive is early when they open.The bathrooms are very unique, esp the wallpaper as other reviews have already mentioned. Also, you can now make reservations through yelp :)Overall, great place to get a drink or have a different experience and bring a date to. I love this place and will keep coming back.",4,2,3
64,Avantika T.,"Jersey City, NJ",32,79,41,5.0,3/27/2017,"What a delightful experience! A great speakeasy that has a friendly ambience and super drinks! We went there after dinner as it was right round the corner when we weren't quite done with the night :) With no fancy facade (much befitting), a guest rings the bell and is greeted with friendly hosts that lead you right in to the experience! Im pretty sure we were able to get in because of the time of the night we got there (1:00am) and our party size (3).I bet if we got there at the peak of the night, we would encounter a long wait!",1,,1
65,Alka M.,"New York, NY",555,139,43,5.0,8/27/2017,"Easily one of my favorite bars in NYC. The ambiance, drinks, and service is just great. I've come here several times, both casually and once for a friend's birthday where the whole place was rented, and each time was great. The drinks are creative and the menu seems to just go on and on. If you like this place, check out Dear Irving too! I believe they have the same ownership and are both my top choices in the city.",1,,2
66,Christine R.,"Manhattan, NY",76,83,77,5.0,4/3/2017,"Raines Law Room is a super classy, intimate speakeasy serving up some awesome cocktails. It can get pretty packed so it's smart to make a reservation. If my boyfriend and I stop by on a whim and get a table we always feel so lucky. Even if there's a wait, it's worth it for a spot at our favorite speakeasy.Once inside, you feel like you're back in the 20s. The menu of cocktails is quite extensive, but is broken up by categories so you can easily find the type of drink you're looking for. As expected, Raines is pricey with drinks costing at least $16. However, everything I've ordered here has been great! The cocktails are different than what's on the standard bar menu. No matter how busy it is, I've also always had great service. Next to each table is a bell you can ring for your server so you are never without a drink for too long!Raines is a great evening spot when you're looking for a bougie cocktail.",,,1
67,Minjoo P.,"Allendale, NJ",59,24,99,4.0,5/25/2018,"Perfect place to hit for a round of cocktails or two. When I checked this place out for the first time, we were told the wait would be about three hours for four people (it was a Friday night) so we ended up elsewhere. Checked this place out again yesterday (Thursday night), and wait wasn't so bad for a party of 5. We were escorted to the bar area at first to order our drinks and then were seated at one of the lounge tables. Maybe weekends are a little different, but Thursday night was chill and not crazy loud. Cool place to check out if you are in the area.",,,
68,Irene W.,"New York, NY",157,63,54,4.0,2/2/2017,Finally made it here after multiple tries. There's not much of a wait if you come before 8 on a weeknight. Cocktails are $16 which is average for NYC lounges. There are a LOT of drinks to choose from and they're all really good! I had one that had gin and earl grey in it and it was very refreshing.I think I expected a little more with the interior. It gave a speakeasy feel but not much decor aside from the couches and drapes. However the drinks made up for that!Will probably come back to try other drinks next time! Wouldn't recommend coming with more than 3-4 people.,,1,3

70,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,441,116,5.0,1/6/2017,"NYE at Raines is excellent.  If you consider yourself to be an, ahem, ""adult"", but still want to have fun on NYE without the massive crowds, overly drunk partygoers, or hours of standing around, then this is the place for you.  It was decorated super classy - but that should be no surprise, considering it was done at Raines, which is generally classy on its own.  Most of the folks opted for table tickets.  Each private table had a bottle of champagne included when you walk in, as well as fun NYE party props like hats, 2017 glasses, etc.  The entire drink menu was available, and we certainly made use of it.  Unfortunately, almost all the bites had seafood and gluten - neither of which I eat.  They brought my friend (who is celiac) a small (I mean, tiny) side salad of greens and smoked salmon (she eats seafood).  When I asked if they could also bring me some greens, sans salmon, they flat-out refused.  Said they only accommodated her because she notified them prior to the event.  I was very disappointed.  I'm sure they had some greens lying around that they could have thrown on a plate for me with olive oil or whatever.  In the end, I had some bacon (tho I can't eat that either), and finger-sized beef wellington, as I was desperate for some food, considering I would be drinking for a few hours.Aside from refusing to be accommodating with the simple food request, the service was excellent.  The music was chill, so much that I was hoping it would change up a bit for something more upbeat.  Despite the food issue, I'd easily return for another NYE, but make certain to notify them of food requests in advance, lest I be refused a small plate of salad greens again.",2,,2
71,Kayla G.,"San Jose, CA",46,10,31,1.0,12/6/2017,"This was my first time going here & I will never go again. I didn't even get a drink. We were kicked out because my friends & I were discussing amongst ourselves how poor the customer service was when we first got there. When I first arrived, five of our friends were already inside seated. I was with another girl, so there would be seven of us in total. The lady told us that their limit is six per group and she would need to check something (with someone?) and closed the door. She let us in after waiting 3-5 minutes outside. It was weird and we felt she was making a big deal over two small girls joining a group. We were seated near the front with the separation of a curtain between us and the lobby, so the woman who we were discussing overheard us. We did not call her any derogatory names, comment on her appearance, etc. We were only discussing how rude she was. She pulled open the curtain and told us she could hear us talking about her. I would believe typically if an employee of an establishment overhears that a customer is unhappy with their service or a service they may apologize or try and make it right. There was none of that. So we then discussed how weird it was that she was eavesdropping our conversation and didn't attempt to make it right.My friend and I finally decided which drink we wanted to get and used the doorbell thing on the wall. Instead of a waitress coming to take our order we were brought the cheque for the previous drinks our friends had and told to get out.We asked to speak with the manager. Apparently it was the same girl who allowed us to come in and we were discussing. She would not provide her name. She then claimed she was kicking us out for causing a disturbance amongst the other guests, except we did not cause a disturbance until she was kicking us out and we were protesting. We paid the bill and left. If you do decide to go here; I recommend you do not complain about customer service because you will get kicked out.",8,12,1

You'll be greeted by two friendly hosts.The concept of Raines Law Room is some sort of vintage speakeasy. Door bells on the walls behind your seat are used to call your server. You're seated on comfy chairs and couches with vintage like patterns surrounded by Chuck Bass esque men. The menu of cocktails seems overwhelming at first glance but each cocktail is crafted towards a specific taste bud.I opted for the Lucky Duck because I was hoping to indulge in something sweet. Should have probably asked if the Lucky Duck was sweet or maybe need to become some kind of liquor connoisseur because i failed to understand that amaro sfumato is bitter. Overall, the drink was still pretty good and the fresh strawberry added a true pop of color. Excited to come back.Tip: Be sure to make a reservation if you're not opted in to come in on Monday or Tuesday.",3,,3

The name escapes me, but it was a ginger and pineapple cocktail that hit the perfect balance between spicy and sweet.And I loved the ambiance. The various couches were spacious, comfy, and perfect for good conversation, which you're able to have without shouting. I think the 6 person party maximum is smart and helps keep the place feeling intimate. The doorbell entry, pull-chain server call, and decor could easily have felt cheesy.

Behind a discretely marked door (that I definitely walked past too quickly the first time) lies a sunken and sumptuous speakeasy. Deep, plush leather chesterfield sofas and wingback chairs are arranged in groups with gauzy curtains to separate them. A clever little button system allows you to summon a server for more libations. In classic speakeasy fashion they have an eclectic mix of cocktails and the ever popular bartenders choice. Everything is expertly crafted and the bartenders use some understated flair while mixing (if you happen to be standing back by the bar waiting for a table). I always recommend bartenders choice at an establishment like this, and that's usually what I end up getting, but this time I had a drink from the menu and was supremely happy.  It was bright and easy to drink and totally dangerous. I switched to wine after to avoid a sugar hangover and was pleased to see a pretty wide selection of wines by the glass as well as bottle if you're feeling flush with cash.In all, it definitely attracts a certain business crowd, but it's such a lush experience I wouldn't pass it up if you have to opportunity.",2,1,2
83,Kevin L.,"FLUSHING, NY",26,109,174,5.0,7/2/2017,No signs outside. Under rated speakeasy in NYC. Not a big place very intimate quiet dark setting. No food menu..interesting drink menu. You pull a small chain by the wall to get service. Great fast service! We had to leave our name at the door and they call you when a table is available. We had a 20 minute wait. When I am back in NYC I will go back again.,,,

I came here without a reservation at about 6 p.m. and only waited about 15 minutes for a table. That's a lot, but I expected it to be a lot worse. Drinks are highly expensive, but that's kinda what you get when you come to a swanky place like this. I also had to stand at the bar for about 30 minutes before seating became available. I appreciated being waited on, though. It's extremely dark -- a fun little speakeasy. Great for work happy hour, but make sure your groups aren't larger than 6 each, because they can't seat any more than that all together.",,,1
86,Ria H.,"Manhattan, NY",4,11,0,1.0,9/18/2018,"I've sat on this one for a long time (my experience was 1.5 months ago), partly to make sure I'm as objective as possible in remembering what happened. If you check my profile, you'll see I usually write 5 star reviews, so calling an organization out for a poor experience is not really my style. However, Raines Law Room was pretty egregious, and is either lacking customer savvy / common sense or potentially discriminatory. Not really sure which is worse.I was meeting a friend (no reservations) on Monday 30 July and arrived at the same time as another lady. She went ahead of me, and due to the entrance structure, I could hear her clearly say she was the 1st of a group of 3, and they were walk-ins. They closed the door, presumably dealt with her, and came back for me. I said I was the 1st of a group of 2, and we were walk-ins, and was told I'd need to wait. No problem so far. However, upon being taken to the waiting space at the back (empty), I noted several empty tables (maybe they were for reservations), and the lady from in front of me, was seated at a table, alone. I politely asked my hostess how come I had to wait due to my incomplete party, when the walk-in ahead of me had a table and also had an incomplete party. After insisting that she must have been a reservation (I had clearly heard walk-in), she got a bit awkward and said she had to check with the other hostess. She came back saying that the lady was handicapped. This would have closed the matter, had I not noticed that the same lady 1) was wearing heels and walking fine (we arrived at the same time) 2) was on her phone and speaking 3) was texting on her phone as well. Perhaps she was mentally handicapped, or maybe had a metal hip or false arm, but unfortunately the only differences I could immediately tell was that she was of a different race to me. We were both also dressed business casual, but in full disclosure, I had flats on (I know this is an issue with clubs sometimes, maybe this was the root of the difference at Raines).Maybe the answer was actually that she had gotten the last walk-in table (would have been a GREAT answer, and probably was what should have been said if there was any business savvy in said hostess) but unfortunately the experience left a really bad taste in my mouth, especially as I don't usually consider myself sensitive to ethnic differences (I am usually oblivious). New York is too big and has too many ""really hip speakeasys"" for me to spend my money, or recommend that my friends spend theirs, at a place that doesn't understand all money is green. 5 stars for a great cocktail, -9 stars for either lacking business sense to give a pc answer, or not treating all patrons the same.",,,

89,Jasmine K.,"New York, NY",188,5,2,1.0,8/15/2017,"As other people wrote on their reviews, their cocktail, atmosphere are great but some of the rude staff members ruin the whole experience. This place is one of my favorite bars in the city and I've been coming here frequently since last year as I live close by.Servers are usually not very friendly but it was bearable except for today. After had a dinner at a restaurant with my friends, we went to this bar. After an hr of waiting, as soon as we got in I went to the bathroom. After 1 min later someone knocked so I notified there is someone inside. Then again the person angrily knocked and screamed ""Are you smoking inside?!!!!"" I am a non-smoker and I swear I was in there for less than 2 min. When I came out she didn't say anything so I walked away and mumbled b word because I thought it was one of those drunken impatient customer. Then she heard this and got freaked out and start the conversation saying ""Did you call me a bitch?""She finally explained she is a staff and there was a report on smoking so she was checking. Since I said b word, we need to get out. Without any apology on accusing me for nothing.  Another staff came to us and after heard what happened she apologized to us. Then this white blond XL size girl again came, told her saying ""You don't have to say sorry to her!""Your bar is amazing.Don't let the unprofessional employee to bring down your bar's reputation.",8,,2
90,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,326,593,4.0,3/5/2017,"I've been to a few speakeasies in the city (and some of them deserve the title less than others), but Raines Law Room is a Speakeasy in the truest sense. The entrance is a nondescript stairway at the bottom of a walkup and the only thing that gives it away is the the number of people who will be probably standing outside.We gave our name to a friendly gentleman by the door, who put our names down on an iPad and told us to come back in about 45 minutes. Once inside, it feels like you have entered someone's house, with the couches and armchairs all around. The house may be back in time though, since the decor is so vintage and classic. Ornate chandeliers and patterned wallpaper all add to the 'throwback' sort of vibe.The entire ambiance is on the quieter, more intimate side. They have a couple of different areas, some with 'booths' that are really a couple of sofas in a curtained-off area to offer a bit more privacy to some of the guests. They also have a bar area where you can sit and chat with the bartenders and watch your cocktail get made. The drinks were well made, tasty and fairly strong. No let downs in whatever we got, but we expected as much from the place. The waitstaff is friendly and patient and will gladly help you pick a cocktail if you tell them what you like. You get their attention by pulling on a little chain on the wall that lights up a little doorbell-sized bulb on the wall.One minor let down here was the level of noise from an adjoining group. I know it's usually not the bar's fault if someone is being too boisterous, but the loud animated conversation from the group sitting not more than five feet from us made it really hard for me to carry on a conversation with my date. Perhaps we could have moved ourselves but the sofa was so comfy...Overall a good experience though, fully deserving of four stars.",2,1,2

This could be considered the official Raines Law waiting room, until unfortunately it closed at 11pm. Then we wandered aimlessly around for Blind Barber's new location, which turns out isn't actually quite open at night. Then we stowed away into a Karaoke bar across the street the second official waiting room for Raines Law.When we were finally texted and headed back to RL, it was sweet. Pretty quite, not a ton of people, and pretty speakeasy-y. Like the bathrooms were literally labeled ""bath room."" There were these dark drapes that hung across lounges and a general bar area.

The booths are roomy and feel luxurious, but you can't pull those sheer curtains back-I pulled one side to cover our half of the booth and one of the bartender ladies comes over and yells ""you can't pull these curtains"" and pulls it back.

It's behind an unmarked door on 17th St. and it gets busy, so go early or be prepared to wait. The neighborhood is pretty fun, so the couple times I've had to wait, it's been easy to either walk around or find a nearby (way less cool) bar to have a drink to kill time. They have a texting system, so you can put your name on the wait list and head back when you get a text that they have a table for you.They have an extensive cocktail menu, and drinks are arranged by attributes.

The ambience here is perfect! Dimly lit and intimate. Upon entering the bar, it felt like I was immediately teleported to the 1920s. It was great!The drinks are a bit strong, so beware. I got the ""Marie Antoinette,""which was topped with ice and fresh raspberry. Cute drink. My friend ordered the ""remember the alimony,"" and that was very very strong!",,,1

Love their bar setting too. Just not a typical place like what I've seen before.I like how they cover the booth/section with sheer curtains makes it more intimate and secluded.

Inside, it's dark, and the sitting area is broken out into small booth-like plush seats.

104,Lisa A.,"Milwaukee, WI",254,635,1085,4.0,1/16/2016,"I'm so torn...I had been all ""we have to go to Raines Law Room"" for months!  I discovered there was one in the William hotel now too and really wanted to go to that one because of the no-need-to-take-the-train deal, but friends had been looking it up and heard the original was better, so off we went.As noted, there's no official sign.  You duck down a staircase to a door several feet below street level and ring the door.  They answer, take your info and tell you they'll call you x (in our case, 20) minutes.  It was a little longer than that, but they called (from a private number) and we dutifully made are way back down the little staircase.  We were told they'd have us standing at a back bar and would let us know when seats opened.  I fully realize they're going for the Speakeasy theme, but the great thing about this country is Prohibition ended like 85 some years ago when the 18th amendment was repealed.  You can stand at many many bars for free and without a phone call.  I'm not a fan of themed restaurants - bars - shopping areas, etc recreating annoying aspects of their said theme (I know, I'm no fun), and really, not a fan of having to wait for a call to come stand at a back bar.Now that we have that out of the way... The place is really cute inside.  All vintage sofas and Edison lights in a Midnight in Paris sorta way, with the furniture having just the right dusty patina touch to seem authentic.  The bartender's were friendly, engaging and attentive. They have a whole book of drinks, and I had a gin based one called ""right now"" which i really enjoyed.  All drinks appeared to be $15 which seemed appropriate but... for that price me and my subway floor gripping feet want a seat.  We were finished with our drink, and it didn't look like a seat was forthcoming so we decided to head out for dinner.I'd still highly recommend... Maybe with a reservation or if you have more time.  I'd still love to try the one at the William hotel!",3,1,1

Let me just start by saying that this place is a freaking commitment. If you come at any sort of normal going out hour on Friday or the weekend, expect to wait not 1-1.5 hours like the nice hostess at the door always claims, but 2+ hours. This means you MUST have a contingency plan: aka do something else during your wait or you will quickly give up. Once inside though, you will lose yourself in the magic of this place and forgive how ridiculously long it took between when you put your name down and when you finally entered. As you go down the steps and encounter an intimate area with booths and shadowy curtains on either side of you, you forget that you just came from the crowded streets of NYC. As you grab your drink from the bar at the back, you get a peek into the saloon life. The drinks here are delicious and high quality, as would be expected in such an establishment. I tried the Pear of Aces and Strawberry Business. They are a huge fan of bitters, so lots of that on the menu. I really appreciate how they maintain a certain volume of people inside so that it's lively and cozy but never too loud. Although the bar area was nice, the booth was the real experience: it was a luxury to lounge on the plush seats and pull on this bell whenever I desired another drink. I am a fan and I hope to make it back at some point!",3,2,3

It is now easily one of my favorite craft cocktail bars period. I had their McKittrick Old Fashioned and 10 Gallon Hat. Both were perfect, while the 10 Gallon Hat may be one of my favorite cocktails ever. It's deliciously outstanding. It had mezcal, ancho chile syrup (not to be confused with Ancho Reyes liquor. What they use here is a syrup, not a liquor, and they make it in house), pineapple and lime. It was the perfect balance of smokey, citrusy, with a kick of spice. I've been trying to get something similar at countless cocktail bars since and it's no where even close.CJ and Catherine took excellent care of me. Catherine could not be any more awesome! Both are talented at what they do and were great to talk with. The atmosphere is super intimate and a bit swanky in a low key way. It's all very inviting and it's easy to want to spend all night here. I will definitely be frequenting this place on future NYC visits.",8,4,5

The bar is really small, yet it can be a personable experience.This place is extremely different from a typical NYC bar. It's cozy, relaxing environment, and reminds you of a high end bar you would probably see in one of those classical movies.There is a seasonal garden, but we did not have the opportunity to scope it out.I feel as though the staff managed well not to make it crowded. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to revisit in the winter months and possibly be seated by the fire place.Any of my fellow Yelpers up for it?!The music in the background was delightful!",7,2,4

122,Kate S.,"New York, NY",580,277,370,5.0,11/30/2015,"It's as if I just stepped into the 1920's.I have only been to a few speakeasy lounge bars, but this one is authentic as it gets. I went with a friend who made reservations a few days in advance. I didn't have that much of a hard time finding it, but may be tricky at first since it's pretty tucked away and concealed. Ring the door bell and there will be someone there to open the door. I'm pretty sure you have to have a reservation, or else you just won't get in. We went on a Monday night, so I could only imagine how hard it would be to get in on a weekend night. Even though we had a reservation and were allowed right in, we still had to wait. They took us in the back where the bar is as we waited for our table. It took a lot longer than we thought, which was a little irritating due to the fact we were on time for our reservation, but it's the kind of place where people lounge and drink in no hurry. The mood is romantic. The couches are vintage and comfy. The service is on point too. Everyone is dressed classy yet authentic. It really gave off that authentic speakeasy feel. There's even a chain you pull that looks like a fancy light switch you pull when you need the server to bring you more drinks. Pretty classy, I'd say.I was actually was thinking the drinks would cost more. I expect to pay $15 in NYC for a well-made cocktail, which is exactly what they were. I ordered a drink called Sweater Weather, which was mixed with apple juice. Perfect for the fall seasons. The only downfall I found in this place was the fact that they only have drinks. My friend and I came during dinner, so after a few drinks, we were both starving. They have a fancy olive platter you can order, but I hate olives. It would have been nice to be able to order at least more snacking foods. So go there only expecting drinks. Other than that, loved my experience.",2,,

124,Alex P.,"Atlanta, GA",493,886,1991,5.0,9/13/2016,"Part I: Us Silly MillenealsSpeakeasies of the millennial generation are  perhaps as much of a muse as the entire prohibition era was in itself. After all, booze has been so easy to procure in the last half century that people have started climbing rooftops to enjoy it, waiting in ridiculously long lines to do so and re-enacting classic prohibition era scenes in Manhattan basements. All of his hard work, simply in a persistent effort to avoid the mundane.Part II: The InventionsIn a world filled with average pubs and identical water holes at the corner of every strip mall and downtown corner, standing out is not easy. Going for something extraordinary is even more difficult. From start to end however, Raines Law Room is an immersive and exceptional experience. The cocktails truly shine in creativeness and deliciousness. For those with a logical thought pattern, drinks are organized and grouped by taste preferences, making it easy for a novice to figure out what they may and may not like. The bartenders are friendly and don't embody the pretentious vibe that plagues some exclusive speakeasies. Part III: Basic PresentationAs much as I've enjoyed the visit, I will say that the presentation of the drinks is rather basic and I do wish there was more creativity in that area. If you've been to establishments such as The Aviary in Chicago, I'd strongly advise to avoid comparison. Both in the price point and presentation quality, Raines Law Room is different. So, relax, sit back and enjoy a night of delicious cocktails that hit just the right spot.",8,4,1

126,Erika C.,"Saint Augustine, FL",145,167,1404,4.0,11/28/2015,"This speakeasy wasn't hard to find as it had a big black plastic awning covering the stairs going down to the entrance. Upon ringing the bell, we were promptly ushered in and the host took our coats. We had a reservation for a Sunday night, and we had no problem getting a table. I noticed afterward that there were some who had to wait at the bar in the back for a bit for a table to clear. The ambiance was very moody and dark with a quintessential 20s vibe. Prohibition-era Jazz played and each sitting area consisted of either plush couches or chairs with high backs and sides. Since our seating area backed up to the fireplace, we didn't have a bell to ring for service. We waited for a while for our server to come. I saw a couple pretend to sit for drinks, but they came in just to take pictures, so I'm sure they get their fair share of these types. The cocktails served were very strong with pronounced favors! The menu seems to rotate quite a bit as well. We were very pleased with the quality of ingredients present in the cocktails, and the bar area in the back felt more like a home kitchen than a bar.",1,1,1

This place is great to take a date and just converse. My girlfriend and I loved the atmosphere here. The bartender John (who looks like Jake from 2 and a half men, lol) was very friendly. While making us drinks he gave us recommendations on where to go eat and what places to visit.

So we waited two hours to get in (which is fine) so once inside we were in the bar area until a table opened up. When we went to order and the bartender was annoyed that we didn't know exactly what we wanted (eh so be it even though it was rude and unnecessary for him to be that way) then we proceeded to order a bottle of wine and cocktails and he goes ""so since you can't decide what you want then you all get waters, just waters"" he began lecturing us on how he has the power to not serve us and belittling a member of our party. No one was too drunk or crazy so I got my card back and we left before ever having a drink.

133,Alixandra E.,"New Orleans, LA",356,201,1109,5.0,2/13/2016,"This place is so much fun! I took my mother here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. I was smart and made reservations ahead of time. It was a good thing we did, because there weren't any other open seats at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday. It's clearly a very popular place. It was a bit difficult to find and I accidentally rang the doorbell of a different place first... oops. We were greeted at the door by a man holding an iPad. I guess even speakeasies have to keep up with the times! He let us in and led us to our reserved seats. We got two cozy, old armchairs with a little table in front of it. Unfortunately, those chairs were the closest ones to the entrance, so it got a bit chilly every time the front door was opened. Luckily, it wasn't too bad and the drinks warmed us right up. They have a pretty extensive drink menu with lots of exciting looking choices. We went for the Gershwin (gin, lemon, ginger and rosewater) and the Coronation (apple brandy, dry vermouth, sweet vermouth and apricot). Both of them were smooth and very well mixed. I would definitely recommend either of them, although the Gershwin was sweeter and more gingery than I expected. The drinks are all $15, which is very reasonable for nice NYC cocktails. Now I just need to make enough money to make drinking here a regular occurrence.",,,

Updated review","One of those rare places that I visited multiple times and I enjoyed it each time except that last time!First the drinks were water-downed!Second our waitress was supper annoying!  Seriously! She was a killjoy! Bad recommendations, very poor attitude and honestly borderline rude!And the thirds was being under blasting ac when it was still 45-50 outside in a coldish April day! Conclusion, the place is not what it used to be! A check on managers and waitress/bartenders performance is needed from top management ( yap putting my eve cap on as unsexy as it might be!)I won't be back here again unless there are some major changes in the drinks and personnel!",1,1,
135,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,4.0,10/23/2016,"This is a classic New York speakeasy. By that I mean it's sort of hidden but not really, and when you first examine the experience you'll think it's super cool and unique, but eventually realize it was all just kind of kitschy. But hey, they do make a mean drink. To start with getting in, the entrance is really not hidden as it has its own awning that looks very different from the rest of the awnings on the street. Whatever. The guy who works the door (fortunately not at all bouncer like) is a nice guy who clearly wants to get as many people through the door as he can. He was very understanding and not at all pretentious. We came a bit after 9 on a Friday and only had to wait 15, 20 minutes. Now for the inside experience. You call a waiter by pressing a bell, which I guess is for intimacy and efficiency reasons, but I found it a bit kitschy. I have to say I did not like the seating arrangement at all. The seating is basically large velvet couches facing each other. So as a group of 2, we sat on one couch side by side, which I don't like since I'd prefer to sit across someone and be able to look at them. There was another couple seated across from us, so we awkwardly could observe their date. If you're a group of 4, you'd sit on 2 couches facing each other, but it's also a bit awkward because the couches are too far apart for people on opposite ends to talk to each other comfortably. I cannot believe how long I spent ranting about that, but there you go.Oh the cocktails are predictably good and there are lots of options so there's something for everyone.",1,1,1
136,Kovie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,105,4,5.0,5/30/2017,"I wouldn't call Raines Law Room hidden but it's certainly discreet. Been here a few times for drinks, and one for drinks and snacks. First of all, it has the speakeasy decor and feel is one of my absolute favorite things about this place. The seating feels very private and intimate. Perfect for a date or small group of friends. Cocktails are well done here. Considering the ambiance and quality of the drinks and food, I definitely think it's worth it if you want an upscale night though it is pricey.",1,,
137,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,5.0,5/11/2017,"I have heard how great this place was, but it wasn't until my wife and I went out for an early Monday night dinner that we decided to drop in, figuring that it would likely not be heavily-trafficked and easier to get a spot. That assumption was correct, although given we were seated at the chairs closest to the entrance, it was still pretty full even around 8:30 at night. The entrance is not noticeable or advertised at all; only the entrance still being shielded by the winter door 'cage' made it easier to see where you went slightly below ground level to enter. Once you step inside the curtain, you are in a place that looks and feels like an upscale speakeasy that has echoes of a past time (elaborate wallpaper, old-school ceiling tiling, and lamps set at dim levels) save for the modern (albeit older-looking) air conditioners hanging at the top of the walls. With curtains separating each section, the noise level is definitely dampened even when folks are chatting at a louder level. Service is not an issue here at all, thanks to the handy switches on the wall that make it easy for waiters to spot when you want to order another drink.The cocktails themselves are quite good, as are the mocktails; my wife gave a few ingredients she liked, and they came back with a very nice honey-ginger-lemon fizz. What was quite nice about it was that it had a bit more body than you would expect something that light to have. As for the drinks with alcohol, they were excellent. I got two, both served with a solitary cube, and they were great. I'd usually expect these cocktails to be 'on the rocks' or have a very strong flavor profile tilted towards the liquor. I liked both of mine; the first was tequila-oriented, but that really only served to give it a little kick at the end - otherwise, with a little bit of honey and ginger, it was a fairly light cocktail that drank easily. The Kentucky-inspired cocktail (it had bourbon in it) was absolutely excellent, and with simple ingredients - cucumber and mint - it had a very fresh taste, even though bourbon is typically one of the stronger liquors in my book. The cucumber definitely took the edge off and made it very enjoyable to sip on, and even with the ice cube melting a little, there was no danger of ending up with a diluted beverage.Overall - this was a great experience, and I'd love to come back sometime. I am sure I got lucky getting in (and there are restrictions around when you can make a reservation), but it is definitely worth a visit for those looking to have a relaxing drink and take a load off in a comfortable, intimate setting.",1,1,
138,Shushu C.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,437,409,4.0,1/21/2016,"Raines Law Room is one of my good friend's favorite places so I guess I had very high expectations. Overall, this crowd much older than (Dear Irving) and the setup was also more antiquated. It does feel indeed very cozy and dark and romantic I suppose. However, in terms of privacy it is a bit awkward to face another party opposite your couch. The cocktails never disappoint and I always stick to gin (Right Now was amazing). Very pretty bar display case with whiskey collections. Definitely a place to check out on a non-prime time such as a Monday 5pm kind of deal as the wait could get very long, possibly even on the most dreadful of days when no one is out. Luckily I had no wait coming in here on a Tuesday 6pm-no reservation. However, I would highly suggest making reservations in advance if possible as when we were leaving at 8PM there was already a line at the door. Waiting outside is also pretty dreadful in the winter so I think the idea of ringing and having the hostess check a party should change on freezing days....",,,

Updated review","Finally made it to Raines Law Room after trying many times! This time we found a bar nearby to wait in...In less than an hour, we got a call from an unknown number saying that our spot was ready. After ringing the bell and waiting a few suspenseful seconds, the doorman opened the door and escorted us to the bar for standing room only - we got to order our drinks with the bartender and then got seated shortly thereafter. Got two drinks off the menu and one custom:- Andean Dusk (nothing special - tastes like fruity champagne)- Cameron's Kick (this drink was great - whiskey and sweet, with a really unique aftertaste)- I asked for a custom drink that's ""very peaty with a little fruit"" and the bartender made me a strawberry penicillin! Knew exactly what I wanted. I loved this drink. I loved the cozy velvet couches & christmas decor. I hear I have to check out the bathroom decor next time... I will be back!",1,,

The patrons were relatively normal but the staff and set up was definitely speak easy snotty lol.It's super small I can imagine that weekends here are virtually impossible to get in. Visit during the week after dinner you should be good. The cocktails were exceptionally unique I'm not a craft cocktail person but I've certainly had my fair share- my mai tai with campari was bizarre but actually good.It's super comfortable romantic I would definitely bring dates here if I were a guy. You ring a bell for the server to bring you your next drink.

The mixologist definitely worked with me as I am super picky when it comes to fancy cocktails, and I don't really know what vermouth does in a drink hahaha. I had this amazing cucumber lime gin and seltzer drink that was so refreshing and strong. The ambiance is incredible and very antique looking.

This is a cool place to experience, and would be fun to take a date you're trying to impress a little, or someone from out of town. After ringing the doorbell, you're seated in a cozy sofa around a small table, and each table has a little light bulb you can turn on when you're ready to order.

There's no sign out front (duh..it's a speakeasy), but there is a canopy with the address. Go down a few steps and ring the bell. A hostess answers and we were told a 45 minute wait. They'll take your number and send you a text when your table is ready.  (We found a karaoke bar across the street with cheap drinks to kill the time). When it was time to get seated, we were let in the entrance and taken to our table. We had a comfy couch and a small coffee table in front of us. There's dim lighting and the bar is broken up in to a few small rooms. Thanks to their wait time, this place is never crowded.  The drink menu has plenty of interesting drinks with ingredients you've never heard of. Prices are about $15 a drink, but I think they're worth it. When you're ready, ring the doorbell next to your table and a server will come over. Our drinks were strong and very good.

148,Katie P.,"Queens, NY",48,2,1,1.0,8/15/2017,"This is probably the worst experience I've ever had. My boyfriend and I and another couple came here for a few drinks after dinner but there was an hour wait. We waited anyways because we all really wanted to check out the place. After roughly about five minutes, one of the managers (the white girl) asked us to leave the room. I was very lost and had no idea what was going so I asked her what just happened. The only ""explanation"" we got from her was ""I heard you calling me a bitch and we don't need to tolerate that here so you all have to step out"" (pointing at my friend). So what happened was after that manager showed us to the bar area to wait for our table, my friend went to the restroom. While she was inside, the manager came and banged on the door yelling ""Are you smoking?"" She was literally in the restroom for less than two minutes, and more importantly, SHE DOES NOT SMOKE!! She was accused of something she did not do, so she got upset and mumbled the B word. The manager heard it and flipped out. First of, it was not cool that she was called names. But technically it was the manager's fault for accusing my friend without any evidence, she didn't even have any cigarettes on her. Instead of apologizing for her action, she took it personally and asked THE WHOLE GROUP  to leave. When we got to the entrance, another manager was very concerned about what happened and wanted to hear our side of the story. Then the manager who told us to leave came out and told the other manager ""you don't have to be sorry"".I feel that we weren't treated fairly and it was very unprofessional the way she acted. As all of us were asked to leave, I asked her twice what happened between her and my friend in the restroom but she did not bother to give any explanations. Ownership should re-evaluate their staff to prevent further incidence like this.",8,,3

We had a few drinks a piece, and got a nice buzz going. The atmosphere is also really great. We've been to other speakeasies where it's like another bar - wth super loud music playing in the background, making it hard to have a conversation even if the person is sitting right next to you. But here, the place is very intimate, not crowded (because they actually stick to their capacity and don't let too many in at once) and really allows you to lounge and enjoy good company.

153,John L.,"Orlando, FL",49,287,117,3.0,5/9/2016,"The 4 of us were in Manhattan for the long weekend and we wanted to go somewhere fun to drink.  We searched online and found this place.  It sounded exactly like what we wanted.We arrived about 11pm and went down the unmarked staircase to the door.  We rang the buzzer after what I assume was the look-see (cool check! hahaha) the door opened and a really sweet girl took our name and told us they would buzz us if they had room for us in an hour or two.  That was odd, but seriously, it's exactly what you're asking for if you come to a place like this.  It was a fun odd.  You felt mysterious and cool.They sent us a text about 90 minutes later and we came back.  Unfortunately, that's just the first step in the game.  She let us in to a private entry room, shut and locked the door behind us, and took our coats.  We were really excited by this point.  It was fun.  They have speakeasy bars in Orlando that do this exact thing, but this was the BIG APPLE!  We were taken to a second staging area.  What????  We weren't sure why they called us back if they weren't actually ready for us.  We stood in the TINY, TINY back bar area for a good while, being knocked around like bowling pins when people went to the bathroom and servers came by to get their drinks from the bar.  We were told it could be up ""however long it takes"" to get a seat.  I found this off-putting.  We waited about a half hour to sit.The drink menu was extensive.  It was also expensive, but that's the charm in these places.  You pay a fortune for the fun experience.  The bartenders were friendly and working up a storm.  Each drink had approximately 8.2 million different ingredients (never forget the random item bitters!!!) and these bartenders were clearly experts at making these drinks.  I would never wish to diminish that fact.  They worked HARD and seemed to be working in tandem well with each other.The problem was that the drinks weren't good at all.  They were really bad.  We all had drinks based on the main ingredients we loved.  That's setting them up for a win.  They were just not good drinks.  No one in group even mildly enjoyed their drink.  Mine tasted like what turpentine smells like and I love a strong drink.The atmosphere is amazing.  The couches and comfortable chairs were wonderful.  They have pull-chains on the wall to ask for service and NEVER bothered us if we didn't pull the tab.  The place was exactly what you'd expect: crazy lamps, weird lighting, someone's great-grandma decorated it, ambiance out the butt, and so on.  It was an amazing place to hang out.That said, for the incredibly high prices, I expect drinkable drinks to go with the cool.The bathrooms were unique.  The wallpaper looks Victorian at first, but it's shadows of people in Karma Sutra positions.  They also have a mirror over the toilet that seems to be made especially for guys to look at their experience.",4,2,

When we arrived, we were told there was a 45 minute wait so we waited and then received a text. When we got there, we went straight to the bar and waited until a table was available. It was really enjoyable watching how the mixologist made drinks. He was very knowledgable and talented. When a table opened up, the hostess came to get us and seated us. We were seated at a couch. There is a button you can press to receive service from the waitress. This place was really cool. Great drinks and the perfect date spot.  I can't wait to return.",2,,

158,Victoria C.,"New York, NY",380,92,173,4.0,4/20/2016,"I visited Raines Law Room yesterday with a few friends and it was very cool - I would definitely recommend going. As the first speakeasy I've visited, I didn't really know what to expect, but I had heard great things. It's truly a different experience.Experience:When you find the place (speakeasy = no sign), you knock, someone opens the door, you tell them how many is with your party, they check your IDs, etc. - pretty standard. They ask if you'd like to check your coat or bag, which we opted for. My roommate checked his bag and I checked my coat, and we both received number tags. Note though that when we left, the hostess (who was the one who checked our coats) wasn't at the door and I was able to just find and grab my own jacket without anyone checking my number, so I'm not really sure why they give them to us in the first place.The space is quite small, so if you're lucky enough to enter upon arriving and not have to put your name down and take a walk around the block, you might have to stand at the back bar for a while before getting a table. That was fine with us - the hostess led us to the bar and we got a couple of drinks to sip on while chatting for maybe 30+ minutes before the she came back and said there was a table ready for us. If you're not really into waiting, this place might not be your thing, but I still highly recommend checking it out at least once because it's really the experience that's cool. When being led to the bar, you walk past all the tables and through sets of sort-of sheer curtains and a certain haze. It wasn't quite smokey in there, but it was strangely hazy and a little trippy, especially upon first walking in (after being outside). It's also very dark, with very intimate lighting.Actually, the whole place has a very intimate vibe. Its decor is very vintage and Prohibition-era themed - from the couches to the lighting. The whole place felt pretty authentic and was very cute and interesting. Definitely not good for large groups - I'd say no more than 4 (we had 4 people). Definitely a great spot for a date, though :)Drinks:Besides the experience, the drinks here were also great. We each tried different cocktails on the menu, since they all looked so unique. They were moderately strong (none of that watered down BS you might find at other bars) and great to sip on. I liked the way they organized the menu - they had grouped drinks together in a unique and convenient way: if you like a ""kick"" (i.e. cinnamon, spice, etc.), what ""we"" drink (staff recommendations), spirit forward and made to sip, and more. It definitely made it easier to find what we were in the mood for, among the oh so many options that they offer. Each drink was about $15, which is a little pricey, but typical for cocktails in NYC and understandable for the small capacity of the space (they gotta make money somehow).Overall, Raines Law Room could turn out to be your thing, or it might not - but for sure, a must-try.",4,,3
159,Emily A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,67,13,5.0,8/17/2017,"one of new york's best kept secrets! it's tiny so be prepared to wait but the cocktail menu is extensive and this place has a neat vibe. i would also say it's pretty reasonably priced for fancy cocktails in this city. however, i don't agree with some of the negative reviews regarding the staff being rude. don't be disrespectful to a customer who waits over an hour to patronize your establishment.",2,1,1
160,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,271,1038,5.0,6/10/2016,"Came here on a Wednesday around dinner time. They don't accept reservations on Wednesdays so we thought we would try our luck and fortunately they were able to accommodate us at a table:Atmosphere: I thought the atmosphere inside was awesome! It was super dark, really intimate, and the decor was sensual. Despite it being a Wednesday, it looked like most of the tables/booths were filled (I hesitate to call them tables, however, because it was more like a couch with a tiny coffee table in front of us. The wallpaper, as many have pointed out, was discreetly risque, kind of like the vibe in Raines itself.Service: I also like the service model they utilize. The server will initially greet you and hand you a cocktail menu, and if you have any questions or want to place an order you pull a chain near your ""table"". I've been to restaurants that employ the same model of service, and, while it might not be for everyone, I like how it is non-intrusive and allows you to dine/enjoy your drinks at your own pace. Our server was very nice and friendly and was helpful when it came to answering any questions about drinks that we had. Drinks: The cocktail menu was organized by ""type"", like lighter/fizzy drinks, cocktails made for sipping, seasonal cocktails, and staff favorites. I liked the method of organization: for example, I'm not a big fan of spirit-forward drinks, so I knew to avoid that page, while my boyfriend pretty much went straight there to peruse the menu. We each ordered two drinks. I can't remember the name of my first drink but it was something with ginger, which as far as I can tell is the new hottest thing in the bartending world, and I love it. The ginger flavor was really strong, which might be off-putting to some, but I really enjoyed it. It was a fairly strong drink but very smooth and refreshing. My boyfriend's first drink was some twist on a Sazerac, which he had ordered the last time he went there and they had since taken off the menu, but still prepared it for him. My second was the Marie Antoinette, which was white rum, raspberry, lemon, and creme de cacao over crushed ice, which was super visually pleasing and good but not unique. I liked how it was a sweet drink but not overwhelmingly so. I can't remember what my boyfriend's second drink was but he enjoyed it. Other: At roughly $15 a cocktail the drinks are priced about average for NYC. When we asked for our check we had a fairly confusing request with splitting between cash and card and the server understood and was able to do as we requested, which I appreciated. Great place, would definitely come back.",1,1,1
161,Mei Lan C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,13,2,5.0,12/23/2017,One of my favorite speakeasy but be prepared for long wait. Thankfully my friend had a table reservation already and was able to join her in a matter of minutes. Great ambience and the drinks are string. Loved it!,,,
162,D L.,"Bronx, NY",6,44,40,4.0,11/6/2017,"If you attend this place on a Sunday you will have no problem walking right in. The ambiance is pretty quiet and intimate...not a place you want to attend with your girls. Everyone here seems to be on a date or with an intimate group of folks. Music is pretty low, and space is pretty tight. Decor is very elegant yet speakeasy-ish. Drinks are a little on the pricy side but they pack a punch. I'd return with a date or a small group of folks - definitely not really a pre-game kind of place. This is more of a calm night out where you're looking to just chat and have a few drinks in an intimate setting.",,,
163,Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",521,756,2395,4.0,2/29/2016,"It's always helpful to have a friend who's got the hookup! I love speakeasies but per their name, they're a bit difficult to get into. Luckily, I've got a good friend in NYC who's a frequent patron and on first name basis with the entire staff so he was able to get us in on a busy Saturday night with a minimal wait. Since it is a speakeasy, there's no sign that makes it known that you've found Raines Law Room. Simply go down a flight of stairs, ring the doorbell, and wait. A host will take your name and phone number. When you get past that initial barrier, you enter a windowless room with charming and old-fashioned Chesterfield couches, interesting wallpaper, antiques, and an overall 1920s vibe. Each table also gets a wall buzzer and chain which you have to pull if you'd like to call your server over for another drink. This chain activates a light in the kitchen/bar counter area which lets the servers know which table to go to. We hung out by the kitchen/bar counter and ordered a variety of drinks. Drinks like Sweater Weather (whiskey, apple cider, Palo Cortado sherry, lemon); New York style Sazerac (rye whiskey, cognac, bitters, absinthe); Mr. Fahrenheit (rye whiskey, allspice dram, bitters, chile liqueur); and the Gershwin (gin, ginger, lemon, rosewater). Most drinks are $15. The mixologists behind the magic are fantastic and so much fun. Despite the unceasing fast-paced nights, they never break a sweat and they make wonderful cocktails. You can also ask them to make a cocktail that's not on the menu, and they're able to whip up sensationally creative drinks for you.",6,2,5

From outside you can't tell exactly what it is, it felt like I was being taken to some class or a secret bookstore. Once you are inside the place is really chill and intimate. It's the perfect atmosphere for an intimate date. FYI my advice is to see the mixologist first and watch the professional at work, seriously they are very impressive! Once you and your date are seated with your drinks you'll notice that there's very little signal (depending on your carrier) which added to the intimacy cause then my partner and I only had each other. This place is a great location for romantic night out where you just want to share a drink with someone and allow them (or yourself) to be a glutton for attention and make the night just that much more special!",,,1

166,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,4.0,2/11/2015,"Yelp probably should update their Sunday business hour, they open at 7pm, not 8pm.I impulsively decided to check if they have a reservation on Sunday, and we scored the 7pm reservation! We rang the bell, waited for the host to check our reservation, and then we stepped into this amazing space. I can see why a lot people said the place is ""sexy"". The room is separated with velvet curtains, leather couches, and mirrors and lamps on the wall. Lighting is dim and seats are close to each other. We were seated in a separate section with two long leather couches. The host told us to pull the chain on the wall when we are ready to order, and also made it clear that if they get busy, they will have to seat people across from us. No problem, for now, we have all the privacy in the world.Among all the drinks I had, ""Right Now"" is my favorite, it's refreshing with a hint of cucumber. ""Andean Dusk"" is a rose champagne based cocktail if you are in the mood for something slightly on the sweet side. ""Wildest redhead"" tasted a little medicinal to me, but not the worst. My husband got some scotch and gin based drinks, but he loved his last one, some Mezcal based drink (don't remember the name).I thoroughly enjoyed the night there. Drinks were solid but not mind-blowing. If I had to wait for an hour or so, I honestly don't think if it's worth the wait. Would I come back again? Absolutely, but only if I can score a reservation!",5,3,3
167,Jacky C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",144,270,122,5.0,2/20/2016,"Once again, Yelp did it again! I was browsing through Yelp to find something to do on a weekend night and I stumbled upon Raines Law Room. After reading other reviews and looking at the available photos, I wanted to go myself.I went with a friend and I was greeted by a doorman with an iPad that was putting people on the waitlist. You give the guy your name and phone number and he'll tell you how long to wait. The wait was 30 min at the time we went which was around 7pm, so we ventured around Union Square and Madison Park until I got a text.When you first enter Raines Law Room, the first room you step into is the coat check. I opted out to use the service. There was room for you to put your coats and bags on the couch anyways. The next room, the main seating room, was filled with couches and no draperies while further in the back, where we eventually got seated, had six ""private rooms"" all separated with draperies. In the way back, where we were first led to wait to be seated, was the bar itself. I probably could of stood at the bar all night and watch the bartenders make these cocktails all night if I could. The photos that are posted on this site don't really give you the perfect image of what this place looks like because of the dim lighting. You pretty much have to see it with your own eyes.Now onto the drinks. This was the hard decision, but I finally decided to get the Jungle Bird. This was listed under the tropical drinks. My buddy got Sweater Weather, which was the first drink listed at the top of the first page. All drinks are $15. This is a bargain in terms of alcohol content. Both of us felt the alcohol kick in 30 min into finishing our drinks.Other things I left out: you pull a chain on the wall to get service which was cool. I ended up sitting with other parties of 2 since only two of us came so be prepared to sit with other people.

I decided to hung out by the bar since I thought that's where all the actions happen. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and welcoming. All the cocktails were superb!

I had been to it's sister bar - Dear Irving - a few times prior and was hoping Raines Law Room would live up to the expectation. It did not disappoint! In typical speak easy fashion, you enter the bar through an unmarked door and ring a doorbell in which a hostess immediately opens the door. They only take reservations on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Sundays, and I believe can only accommodate parties up to 6. I highly, highly, recommend making a reservation or you will be standing in the back by the bar for a while- which isn't necessarily a bad spot. It just gets crowded. The bar tenders have a truly special talent in crafting drinks that you know are strong but don't have that sting the way a well drink at any watering hole would. The way they move about the bar, creating the drinks amongst literally TONS of different accoutrements is spectacular- definitely check them out and chat a little! They're very knowledgeable about the drinks on the menu, but can also make anything you request- even if just given a few key ingredients or alcohol preferences.  The seating areas are quaint and intimate- perfect date spot with plush cozy couches and very dim lighting. The way the menu is set up is perfect as well- each page fits a different taste and the description is written up top (i.e.: Stirred and Strong, Island Time, Hint of Spice, etc.). I ordered the Pan American Clipper per the bartenders recommendation, and the La Reforma. Both very different but equally delicious and strong. Drinks are about $15 each.",2,,

Unmarked, but find the crowd of people gathered around some steps going down/a door, and you'll know you're there. I had the Pear of Aces cocktail, which tasted more like it was appropriate for the fall, but was delicious nonetheless. My friend doesn't drink and the bartender graciously whipped up something non-alcoholic for him based on his tastes.Minus one star because there is no food besides an overpriced charcuterie plate and the door service wasn't great.

Good for 4-6 people as long as one of them is not me.  The maximum size group this place will seat is 6.  Simply knock on the door and put a name and number down and wait patiently in the area or make a reservation for Sunday-Tuesday nights.

A fun way to experience craft cocktails with a little history.My wife and I went here at around 7:30pm on a Sunday. We had no reservations, so we shared one couch in one of the partitions for two couches. We were greeted by a friendly hostess upon arrival and had our bags/coats checked. We were then escorted to our seats, given menus, and told how to summon service using the pull-chain.  After figuring out what we wanted we pulled the chain and soon a server was taking our order.  I got the 10 Gallon Hat, which came in a small wine glass and had a nice spicy flavor.  My wife got a Jungle drink which was pretty bitter because of the Campari.While there, we enjoyed the romantic/nostalgic atmosphere and had some nice conversation.  The drinks weren't amazing, but we likely just didn't pick the right ones for us.

I was not at all happy about it. So, instead of confronting her, I relayed the situation to the awaiting party.  At no time did we even discuss/utter/speak with ANY of the staff about how I felt.  We spoke amongst each other and this ""manager"" (who refused to give her name; tall and heavy set) EAVESDROPPED on our conversation and ASSUMED we were speaking about her.  She then proceeded to hand us our bill and refused to offer us any further services.  I would love to comment of the drinks but we never received ours.

Hopefully you made a reservation. In that case, they keep you outside and say they will text you when your table is ready. You then go next door to an adjacent restaurant to wait until the privilege of entering this secret place.When you finally get the text, you are led to the basement lair, of which the front is lounge-like with scattered sofas and chairs. There are 4 private ""cabin""-like areas that feel like you're on an old Russian train. If you're 3 people, you get one side and awkwardly face another set of strangers. However, if you're 4-6 people, it's a perfect little private cubby hole. The ceilings are mesmorising, and you get the attention of the wait staff by pulling on a doorbell cord. There is a tiny table along the wall that does not extend to the people seated near the ""aisle."" In the back is a kitchen-turned-bar area with a broken dishwasher. Fascinating esthetic. The bar tenders are very nice, and the drinks are AMAZING (hence 5 stars). I'm not even much of a drinker, and I got the ""bartenders choice"" once I let the waitress know what kind of drink I was looking for. It had strawberry, concord grapes, and a bunch of other things.

186,Hindel m.,"Brooklyn, NY",157,60,34,5.0,9/13/2017,"Super chic, super mysterious. The cocktails are amazing and the staff is very professional. The space is intimate and its a great place to relax and take it easy when you aren't in the mood for a loud scene.",,,
187,John S.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",11,9,0,3.0,9/20/2017,Another hipster cocktail joint in the village. Looks cool. Tastes good. But who cares. Definitely don't take a 22 year old on a date there. Over priced,,,
188,Ellie W.,"Boston, MA",523,578,142,5.0,11/14/2016,"This place is the cutest speakeasy in the world. Downstairs, behind some velvet curtains, you'll find you've been thrust back into the sexiest part of prohibition era. The cocktails are creative, and the ambiance is killer, with its antique decor, dim lights, and velvet couches. It's small, but yields a nice, intimate atmosphere that not many other bars can seem to replicate with quite the same beauty.",2,1,4
189,Mala L.,"Long Island, NY",510,312,1261,4.0,3/9/2016,"In terms of ""speakeasy"" I think Raines Law Room has one of the most authentic atmospheres. Upon entering you are immediately transformed into a 1920's-esque lounge, dimly lit with sofas and brickwork all around. They have a book of unique cocktails and there's something for every taste. A pretty penny but it's the atmosphere that you're paying for.We came Sunday evening just after 7 (a little after they opened) without a reservation and my friend and I were seated immediately on a vintage sofa for two that wasn't too close to any other patrons. I think we got lucky because sometimes two groups of two are seated on sofas directly across from each other that look like they were meant for one group of four or six.No one rushes or bothers you here. You pull a little doorbell type of string to get the attention of your server. Otherwise, he/she will let you be. I'm a big fan of this set up. Great spot to bring a date.We only stayed for one round of drinks because they don't have a kitchen and I was *starved*  but I hope I find myself here again.",,,1
190,Magda C.,"Cincinnati, OH",116,421,1249,5.0,1/25/2016,"Wonderful place!Knock on the discreetly marked heavy door, give your name and phone number and hope for the prompt call back, because it is worth the wait!When the door opens in front of you, your coat will be taken and the silky music, velvety curtains, plush sofas and dimmed lights will transport you back in time to sexy 20s. Very inventive cocktails, great service at the push of the button (literally!) and very comfortable intimate seating. What a lovely solution, to divide this small space with long curtains, I'm impressed!I really like the name, the story behind the Raines Law is as funny as the concept of prohibition!When you're there, don't forget to check the wallpaper in the restrooms! :)",1,,
191,Irene K.,"Houston, TX",277,185,23,4.0,9/10/2014,"I am a cocktail fiend. I know that Manhattan cocktails are ridiculously overpriced compared to pretty much the rest of the world, but I can't help it. I love them. And I personally would rather pay $15 for a well-crafted drink than $8 for some vodka soda I could've easily made myself. But anyway. The drinks on the menu jumped out to me less than at other cocktail bars (I usually go for whiskey with some sort of special kick and/or fruits) but this is not to say they don't have a vast selection. We spoke to the bartender and she mentioned that there was a Rickey that was not on the menu. It included gin, cucumber, club soda, and a couple other things, and was incredibly refreshing and delicious. Next time I also want to try the Kentucky Buck Fifty (whiskey lemon cholula black pepper and a cayenne rim!) Initially my friend and I were standing at the bar, but after about 10 minutes a table had opened up so we got to sit on the couches, which were quite comfortable, I might add. The ambiance of the room (because it really is pretty tiny) reminds me a little of the McKittrick hotel. It's dark, intimate, and nicely lit with candles in these bucket-type things. It's also fun because you can pull on this light switch on the wall and the waitresses will come and take your order. It's obviously not a great place for groups, but a date or one to two close friends would be perfect.",4,2,
192,Maria E.,"Denver, CO",809,1585,254,5.0,9/21/2015,"My boyfriend took me here and it was lovely. Dimly lit, amazing ambiance. There's limited seating so it's a really great place to have an intimate conversation.Great cocktails and a limited food menu. Fantastic place to bring a date if you want to impress him or her, hint hint. We had reservations but check their website for guidelines - probably doesn't hurt to make 'em esp. at peak times.",5,1,3
193,Alexis S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",15,224,16,5.0,1/16/2017,"I've been to this location multiple times, and each time is great. You go down the stairs to an unmarked door and ring the doorbell. Once let inside, it is a dimly lit space with beautiful plush seating and lots of privacy. You have a cord you can pull at your table when you need more drinks or if you have questions about any drinks on the menu. The drinks themselves are wonderful, and innovative creations and though they aren't cheap, are quite original and taste great. Would absolutely recommend for a date or with a small group of friends!",,,
194,Vicky F.,"Tampa Bay, FL",137,468,294,5.0,11/1/2015,"Very much like my fav bar ""Dear Irving"" which is not too far away, Raines Law Room is very vintage, secretsy and intimate. Music genre- Jazz. Standing only bar. It gets crowded but when you sit down on the red couches, you feel the ambience and relaxation instantly. Drinks are delicious too, a little pricy but I wouldn't mind. My friend had American Clipper which is a strong version of Cosmo and I had a berry flavored gin which was great too.Great spot for week nights, stop by and unwind your day there.",2,,1
195,P M.,"New York, NY",11,191,1,5.0,6/21/2017,"Still awesome after all these years. Nothing like ringing a bell to order your cocktail. The wait is still too long. Put your name down, go get dinner and return.",1,,
196,Brenda P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",292,703,12925,5.0,9/24/2015,"On my to-do list for a couple of years now and I finally got to try it. I explained the concept to my friends who were not very thrilled at first, but they went along with it anyway. It's a speakeasy bar, complete with a nondescript, semi-hidden entrance and a purposely shut solid door. We took an uber from our dinner location and I found ""the door"" to be open. Hmmm that's odd, I thought. I walked in and waited in the small atrium since no one was there. Also odd. Seconds later, the host appeared. I think I caught him off guard, but he was nonchalant about it. He took my phone number down and said I would receive a text once a table was ready. I happily went along with it. Within minutes, there were at least four other parties that checked in as well. By then, the door had been shut and each one had to knock. I guess I had perfect timing!Every party checked in, and walked away. We aren't familiar with the area so we just waited outside. Right when we were about to leave at about the 15 minute mark (my friends were getting bored and antsy), the text came through. We checked back with the host and were escorted in. Down several steps sits a dark bar. Loved the look right away. There are maybe 4 to 5 private booths lining the sides of the small space, several sofas, and a clear path right down the middle leading up to the bar. It's not your typical bar where people hang out all over the place with elbow room only. Sitting is on the booths only, The wait made sense once I noticed this. We were taken to the bar where there's comfortable room for perhaps 4-6 people while we wait for our table to be ready. There, we met the bartender. I forgot his name, but he was personable and a lot of fun. We ordered a couple of drinks off the menu and let him create a couple of others based on what we told him we liked.Before the drinks were prepared, our table was available. We sat and minutes later someone walked our drinks over. Our booth was very spacious and comfortable. There is a call service button which lights up directly behind the bartender (at the bar) showing which table needs service. Neat! The booth is lined with sheers that appear to serve to further privatize each booth although no one had them drawn (and I didn't test them). Loved the experience and private nature of this bar. The drinks were strong and very well made. I will definitively make this a mandatory stop for my future NYC trips.TIP: If you happen to sit near a damask lined wall, lean in and take a closer look.",3,2,3
197,Valeria L.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,5.0,3/7/2018,"This place is phenomenal. Came here last Saturday with my fiance on our weekly date night. We've never been here before but the reviews were great and we wanted a place with good cocktails. The bartenders are true professionals and know their craft. The interior is absolutely gorgeous and has a 20 style prohibition era feel. It is easy to spend a lot of money here on a few amount of drinks, but that's New York for you",,,
198,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,4.0,10/18/2015,"Really cool place with amazing cocktails.Most Yelpers have stories of exorbitantly long waits and such. However, since we just happened to walk inhere on the off time (past 10pm on a weeknight), our wait was barely more than 5 minutes. I love the decor of the place. It brings to mind the library or study of the Clue board game. Sort of dark, intimate, and mysterious. We ordered a few cocktails each, and they were all top notch. I can't recall a single less-than-stellar one among the bunch. They will add up, however, so be prepared to shell out a pretty hefty amount of cash. Service is also very good, they take care of their patrons. This works as a place to impress a date, however, I think it is more ideal for small groups of friends.",2,,2
199,Jing X.,"Brooklyn, NY",258,641,2734,3.0,11/5/2015,"We came here at 5pm on a Saturday, right as they were about to open and only had to wait a few minutes for them to get the crowd (short line of people outside the door) settled in.  They take reservations Sunday-Tuesdays so if you don't want to wait in line on the weekends, it's best to get there at 5 on the dot and have a well-crafted cocktail pre-dinner.  By 5:30, the place was full!  I loved how the noise level still remained hush hush, low enough to have an intimate conversation with your partner on the couch.  It definitely has the speakeasy vibe.Sadly, I had high expectations for Raines Law Room and this could be the reason why I'm giving it a low rating of 3 stars.  The couches are paired off into booths but there isn't much privacy.  It can get pretty uncomfortable sitting directly across from another couple in the same booth and overhearing their conversation.  There isn't a table or curtain to divide us, only very wide leg room.  The ""table"" is more of a short stub going off the wall and the sheer curtains only separate booths on the same side of the wall.  The unique call button on the wall lights up when the string is pulled but service, although friendly, was slow.However, I have to give it to the bartenders.  Their drinks are STRONG and a good run for your money ($15).  I had La Reforma, listed under their ""Bright & Fresh"" menu page.  It's a sweet and tasty tequila cocktail, a huge and classy upgrade from your typical margarita.I would give this speakeasy another try but for now, A-OK = 3-stars.",2,,
