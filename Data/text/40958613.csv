I was actually headed somewhere else, but that venue didn't have onsite seating and I was looking to hide from the weather. City Diner appeared like an oasis in the urban desert.COZY - dimly lit like the diners of yore, awesome deco touches, tiny booths perfect for the solo diner. Friendly, fast service. Awesome bacon, hot and plentiful coffee, and a steady stream of obvious regulars let me know exactly why this place has endured. They also have gluten free toast on the menu, which comes with ample butter - in fact, everything was ample - I left full, I spent less than 15, including tip - and I wish I could eat here every day. It was like going home.",,,
1,David B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,36,201,3.0,11/2/2018,It is good diner food. Breakfast is definitely their best meal.

Maybe because it was late and we were in conversation so no one wanted to bother us. Or maybe we scared them. Hey, I wore deodorant and showered!Sure, I would come back here again if close by and it's after the witching hour. It sure beats fast food or bad .99 cent pizza.",22,6,21

Menu is quite large but this time we ordered the Cali burger and and penne alla vodka. Both are DELICIOUS. Diner pastas are always either hit or miss and theirs is definitely a hit. Portion was enough to share and have some left over. I have honestly yet to go to a better diner. The place is clean and open.

14,Nimbus C.,"Durham, NC",2,45,1,2.0,8/26/2018,I really like the ambience here but the food was pretty bad. The in house veggie burger was fried. I ate the middle out of it which was ok but not very satisfying. It came with tasteless tomatoes and a side of frozen salsa. All for $15,,,
15,Morgan L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,1,2.0,1/20/2018,"Go to Metro Diner instead if possible - same exact menu (literally a duplicate) but with better food and lower prices.I'll start with this - I have eaten at City Diner at least a hundred times. I live one block away and it used to be my go to spot for late night and/or cheap, quick meals. I used to like it a lot but lately their greatly diminished service, value, and quality have turned me off from the restaurant almost completely.Food is okay and the prices used to be more reasonable until they increased everything on the menu by literally $1-3 across the board. Most items on the menu are no longer worth the cost especially considering what you get and the new prices they are charging you. For example, their mediocre bagels are now over $3, mozzarella sticks are $10.50 for 5 (thats over $2 each which is insane!), amd salads are between $15-$18 (the same as a gourmet salad elsewhere and their lettuce is nowhere near top notch). You might as well go to a nicer restaurant because you'd end up paying the same or maybe even less for way better quality food!Beware they also charge 10% tax because it's easier for the waitstaff to calculate the hand-written bill that way. Not cool to be over-charged like that.The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice - old retro diner - but it's often hard to get the attention of your waiter or even find them even when it's late at night and pretty empty.For what it is, the food is usually fairly decent though nothing special. Lately since they changed the menu prices, quality has been somewhat lower. For example, milkshakes cost $2 more than they used to but they don't use Haagen Daaz ice cream any more and where they used to come nice and thick like you'd expect, they are now really thin and liquidy. Ordered a black and white (chocolate + vanilla) the last two times I've ordered and both times it was thin and clearly just vanilla ice cream with a little chocolate sauce in it - gross to me.They often mess up delivery orders especially if you are ordering late at night; they seem to think you must be drunk and won't notice changes to the order. They also hang up on you or are rude when calling in an order and this is any time of day.Because it's the only thing open for 24 hours in the nearby area, I will probably still occasionally order from here late at night but it's no longer really worth it otherwise.",3,,
16,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,4.0,5/21/2017,City Diner has been down the block from me for the past 5 years and this is the first time I set foot in it. For shame. Your basic diner fare but the big plus is that it's one of the few 24 hour places to eat in the area other than resorting to the Mc Donald's restaurant-cum-hotel or 7-Eleven. I had the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich that comes with a side of salad. I don't think I've ever eaten anything as healthy in my life that tasted as good. The decor is straight up Art Deco. Subdued and without the kitsch. Only downside is that they don't have the soft mints. I love the soft mints.,9,6,7
17,Pat K.,"Northport, NY",0,5,0,4.0,10/8/2018,You don't go to a diner expecting gourmet food. City Diner does the basics quite well and the service is great. I'm grateful it's in my neighborhood!,,,
18,Lee C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",83,19,50,3.0,9/26/2017,"It was pretty late at night. My husband and I haven't had dinner and we were starving. Knowing the City Diner is opening 24-7 so we uber there. We ordered mozzarella cheese stick, chicken club sandwich and waffle. I want to be healthy so I changed the side fries to broccoli for free. The mozzarella cheese stick was okay. It came with some carrots and celery. The waffle is okay too. Not the best but not the worst. Last but not least, the chicken club sandwich. It was not good at all. It was tasteless. The best is the boiled broccoli lol It's very fresh! I would never come here during daytime, but if you are hungry at the middle of the night, this is a okay spot for food.",,,
19,Amir V.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,2.0,6/30/2018,"My wife and I ordered cheeseburgers and they were pretty good as well as the fries, but the ambience and our waitress were awful; as well as our supposed baked three cheese macaroni not being baked at all.

Due to the special conditions of my body mechanics that day, I couldn't eat much so I had it wrapped up to go. When I did eventually get to it an hour later, I gobbled that up so very quickly.

Makes for a relaxing breakfast. Just a note that Yelp shows that they accept Apple Pay, but they don't. I actually deliberately chose to go here last weekend instead of one of the other diners close by because my credit card was offering more rewards points for using Apple Pay, but then it turned out I couldn't use it there anyway.  Not a criticism of the diner (the other ones don't accept it either) but wished the payment information on Yelp was more accurate.",1,,

27,Sue S.,"Golden Valley, MN",237,829,1889,4.0,1/6/2016,"This review could really be just one word: Lumberjack. And no, it's not about husky men with beards (which I also have a thing for, but that's a different story). The Lumberjack is the superstar of the all-day breakfast offerings here. It's a stack of plate-sized fluffy pancakes, two eggs and every type of breakfast meat you can think of -- a lovely griddled sausage link, a pile of crispy bacon, a slice of ham. Mmmmm. If you are after a breakfast feast, get a Lumberjack.We dined here twice... the first time I got french toast with eggs and sausage. Delicious. But my friend got the Lumberjack and I had ordering envy. The second time we ate here, I did not make the same mistake. But apparently I was so busy eating that I did not take a photo of the Lumberjack. Sorry, friends. You'll have to use your imaginations. #yelpfailThe City Diner itself is a pretty standard 24-hour diner with a bit of New York flair. It seems like a place that could serve as a set for a movie set in the 50s or 60s... We really picked it because it was on the way home and offered 24-hour breakfast. The food was good and definitely met the need. Service was fine. We even took some muffins to go for the morning, and those were very good as well. All in all, a good place to stop for a quick bite, with a bonus star for all-day breakfast and that Lumberjack.",3,3,
28,Niko K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,12,1.0,5/8/2018,"Have been to City Diner, Manhattan Diner and Metro Diner, all owned by the same person. A few years ago you got adult sized portions worth your money on chicken dishes and omelettes. Now these come at higher prices and half the size. It's a joke to see on your plate maybe a 6 oz chicken breast parm or a 1 egg omelette that is fluffed up w extra home fries. The owner is laughing at customers as they throw their hard earned $$$ at him and get very little in return. Avoid these diners at all costs. Food ain't expensive. It's only when you walk into a ripoff establishment like this one that you get a taste of highway robbery!!!!",,,

I ordered an omelette - JUST an omelette (no fries, no toast), with ""fresh turkey"", swiss, tomato, spinach, and the bill was ... $18.50! It was a late- night pinch, I was hungry, but never again.

31,Jay G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5,271,163,3.0,8/9/2017,Good late night spot for a burger and fries.  Have also had their Greek salad. Just a regular diner menu of a typical Greek diner with basic good food and diner type atmosphere of booths and some tables.  Yes the people can be a bit tough as servers but what do you expect from a diner. Especially at midnight or late at night for you expect them to be happy to see you. And yes since it's a Diner they have to have the best cheesecake. So don't leave without a slice and a cup of coffee.,,,
32,Christine H.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,36,2,2.0,12/30/2017,"They get two stars only because they are open when others are not but, in essence, a completely nasty place.  Disinterested waitstaff, mediocre food but the worst part is that this place is dirty.  The ladies room is absolutely disgusting.  I complained and management yelled at me and said, ""It's you, the customer, who makes it so dirty"".  I pointed out that what was in there was the sum of MANY hours of use but his response was that I should leave and go someplace else.",1,,
33,Christian T.,"New York, NY",6,43,0,1.0,4/20/2017,"I have just ordered a traditional burger and fries and to my surprise there was a fly in it, a black fly fried fly right on the cheese after the second bite, which made me honest to God throw up as I have a very week stomach for such nasty things.So I called back to tell them my problem hopping that I will get a normal response and maybe a well deserved apology, but instead I got yelled and screamed at and called a liar by a super combative Greek older gentleman that I think is the owner as well and that is there always answering the phone for deliveries. ( or he is outside chain smoking every 10 minutes). I've been seeing him for years doing so, while I come to visit my old mom.I am so shaken up by this his combative behavior that i swear I will never ever enter this nasty business again.He told me in his very broken English that I ma a liar and that the food did not come from his City Dinner (and this poor old bastard is the one who took my order half hour prior) but some other place, and to never call there again....I've tried to reason with him in a calm tone of voice but he hung up on me twice in a row. Honestly I cannot believe that this ignorant donkey is still in business and can treat people in such unprofessional way and get away with it.My mom has been going to this sorry example of a dinner for at least 10 years as long as she has been in the neighborhood and what hurts me the most is that I've told this to this old rag doll,but he did not care for continuing business by my self or my mom, who I will make sure never steps foot in this filthy,nasty,ignorant place again.

Updated review","Been to this diner twice so far and I have to say I'm impressed. Though the prices for everything are a bit steep the burgers are fairly priced at around $9-15 depending on whether you'd like deluxe or not and what kind. For the neighborhood and the portion the price is exactly fair imo. There is a wide variety on the menu and I can confidently say that I'd choose anything and it'd most likely be good. I shared a penne a la vodka with my sister the other day and it was soooo good, I'm tempted to go back today for another. It was $20.95 for the dinner special which came with a small soup (I had chicken orzo which id order separately because it was delicious) and penne a la vodka with chicken. It was definitely enough to feed the both of us, and man was that pasta slamming! It was fresh and executed perfectly, I mean you'd think you were eating out at some fancy Italian restaurant. The ambience is casual and friendly and the staff are courteous and attentive. Also just by looking around I saw they had some really great looking cakes by the counter, I'd have to try that next. There's a sign that says open 24/7 so I can only imagine a late night coffee with a slice of cake/pie would hit the spot. They also gave us a basket of assorted mini baguettes/raisin bread/sesame bread with butter which was also very nice.",1,,

It could be breakfast, brunch, lunch and or Dinner. Over the years the quality and cost has changed. Things have gotten very expensive by a 1 or 2, and a couple of times the food was cool( I won't say cold, but you know lukewarm).

37,ShellyLuvs E.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,33,48,1.0,10/29/2017,The customer service here was horrible. We requested water that we never received and then the waiter try to add $20 onto the bill. When we asked him how could he make such a mistake he proceeded to argue with us and he got so bad that we had to call the manager. The waiter would not even give us his real name. He told us to call him blue. WTH! Come here if you're desperate but if you are seeking good service this is not the place for you!,1,,
38,Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,317,179,3.0,11/22/2017,"I ordered a burger from this place and it came with fries and coleslaw.

First, it's filthy, and the bathrooms are always dirty and disgusting. Second, the last time I ordered from there I became very ill for days. That doesn't surprise me because how dirty the place is, the kitchen must be disgusting. Third, the service is awful, and there seems to be a lot of discord between the employees. They're all awful, and constantly get orders wrong. And I have always been told by one of the servers that there are undocumented people working there. That's not cool.

Everyone I was with ate their entire meal, but that doesn't mean it was the best food they had ever had. If anything, the fact that we drank the night before and were starving for breakfast is what really made the food quality good. Overall... Guess it isn't bad if you're in a pinch!",1,1,

I'm a big eater and still have a tough time downing this behemoth plate of food! It doesn't help that it's so late at night either.   Nevertheless, the food here is good and I can't complain about the service neither. Although I cannot tell a lie, the service can be a bit sluggish, but perhaps it's because the food is made with love. It's never too crowded and upon entry you're greeted with a smile and good energy! You can't beat that with a stick!",1,2,1
51,Alfredo D.,"New York, NY",117,224,58,4.0,3/11/2015,Breakfast is pretty good here. But what sets City Diner apart is the welcoming atmosphere and good service.Their City Fritata is delicious and even though I always say I will try something else I always end up ordering this dish!,2,2,1

56,Katherine G.,"New York, NY",0,5,0,5.0,11/2/2017,"Came in late at night recently to get some food and the waiter provided absolutely perfect service. Attentive without ever being pushy. I've definitely been places late night where the server forgot they had tables while doing sidework or w/e but this guy struck the perfect balance between instantaneously taking care of me whenever I needed anything and then leaving me alone, which was exactly what I wanted. He and the guy running the register were both really nice. Food was standard diner fare, but decent, and I'm cool with that at 1am",,,
57,G T.,"Manhattan, NY",21,11,0,1.0,1/1/2017,"This diner looks nice from the outside but the owner's greed. mediocre food quality, and fecal  filth of the bathrooms will guarantee that I never go back.We walked in before 1 AM on New Year's Eve.  Unbeknownst to the customers they doubled to tripled their regular prices and did not tell us that. Imagine our shock at the $4.50 small cup of coffee and $8.50 slice of cake when the bill came.  When I spoke with Mel, a manager, he demanded why I did not ask the server if the normal prices were in effect as if I were responsible.When I explained that the customers are not psychic to know that there had been a one night price gouge he deflected the question.  Here is the bottom line.  They can charge as exorbitant a price as they want but they need to show the customer a menu with the higher pricing so customers can make an educated decision prior to ordering and not regretting it after because the prices were purposely kept secret.If only the quality of cakes we ordered were exemplary then I could at least justify the price gouging but sadly they were mediocre at best.On the way out I attempted to use the bathroom.  Bad idea.  The toilet had feces all over it and all over the wall.  The feces were dry so they had obviously been stuck on the wall for some time.  There was no toilet paper and no paper towels.  Clearly the bathroom had not been cleaned in many hours.How can I justify returning with such filth, poor quality of food and price gouging.  It is a shame because it looks like such a nice place from the outside.",2,,1
58,David R.,"New York, NY",78,1,0,1.0,12/1/2016,"The food here is better to eat in person then delivery. Each time i go in person i am amazed at the plates and preparation but i believe that the cooks get lazy when for orders by delivery. I have had several deliveries nade to my apt where either the food was wrong, or just terrible. For instance i made an order through seamless for a w medium well burger and 1 of the 2 burgers and mine was only cooked on the outside still bleeding and No cheese. I was very upset and had lost all desire to order from these ppl. How rude of the cooks.",4,,1
59,Sue P.,"Boston, MA",0,20,1,1.0,1/16/2017,I've ordered from them in the past but it seems delivery is becoming unpredictable. I just waited an an hour and 20 minutes for a single dish of pancakes and eggs. It doesn't help that the restaurant is only .4 miles away from me (around 8 blocks). What took so long?

62,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,42,3,4.0,3/10/2017,"As far as New York diners go, I found City Diner to be quite good -- although a bit more expensive than some other diners. This place has all the classic offerings in its expansive menu, ranging from burgers to breakfast items to gyros to pastas. We had a couple good items here: fruit salad, onion rings, and a deluxe burger. One complaint was that the buffalo wings my wife ordered were not coated with buffalo sauce, as is common with buffalo wings. She wasn't a huge fan of those. Nonetheless, the service was great and it was a quick and easy meal.",,,

67,Samantha M.,"Columbia, SC",507,4,0,3.0,8/13/2016,"Seemed like an awesome place to eat, but trying to get take out/ asking about the menu over the phone is an absolute disaster. I had to call 4 times one night and each time the host answering was so rude and eager to hang up on me. I'm so sad to have to say that I will not return until they hire better servers, because the they have now all look like they hate their lives. If they don't change something they're going to have to learn the hard way.",2,,

Updated review","City Diner late night or when later becoming the next day- is by no means perfect-yet, come to realize rare well intended almost a haven when 'burning the candles at both ends' w/ positive artistic intent, that is to write + organize one's life + read the Times from cover to cover. My experience w/ the wait staff/bus boys varies from nice well meaning to downright inhospitality sexist rude ( happily not recently + no longer happily not  there so far). I took a break for almost a year + upon returning greeted in the most friending warm manner by the hardworking good guy manager (first name begins w/ S.)- wondering where I  had been + yes, he did miss me). In terms of their culinary offerings, given the late hour stick w/ classic eggs  blt  rice pudding  muffins danish w/ endless cups of good joe-often prepared fresh w/out asking. Others venture in to the more complex food offerings. In closing, speaking of the other customers, -folks run the gamut from quiet studious elderly international tourists regulars under age youths + sorry to say unfortunate drunk or sadly on drugs loud + w/ abusive tendencies towards others. Human gamut being after all Manhattan.",,,

71,Arianna G.,"New York, NY",60,108,3,4.0,4/15/2016,"City Diner is a no fuss, delicious, hearty staple. You can get just about anything--it is a diner after all--at any hour, and you will be satisfied. While it is not as cheap as some diners, given the neighborhood, the prices are extremely reasonable. Food is always fresh, service is quick, portions are big, and I've never had a bad experience after countless takeout and drop ins. A favorite for sure.",2,1,1

Good food, enormous portions, a wonderful waitress, moderate prices, a decent bathroom, and they are open 24/7, which is more of a rarity these days in gentrifying New York.

74,Elianna W.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,4/7/2016,"Perfect classic diner food for the high 80s on the UWS. Good for breakfast lunch and dinner-- but even better when it's late night because it's open for 24 hours. Wait staff is always friendly and happy to accommodate changes. Only downside is that it can be a bit pricey , but hey it's New York and you should expect that. Always my go to when those diner food cravings hit!",1,2,1

76,mark k.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,6/13/2016,"Disgusting. Blood and grease slapped on worn out bread. Used to come here. It used to be good. I couldn't be more disgusted during my last visit. Cooks couldn't seem to care less. Waitress was kind but barely there. And front desk management doesn't care. Dirty, sloppy, without a concern or care for customers or food quality. A good burger should be an easy staple, have had some great ones in local diners. This pre-made chunk of meat was carelessly cooked and plated, leaving a sloppy, raw piece of meat soaked in blood and grease. Even the bun was soggy with the redness of the blood. Meat was disgusting. They may be on their last legs - prices have been raised maybe 30-50%! Maybe trying to find some way to survive the empty dining room. Try cleaning and caring and serving real food, cooked by someone who cares to customers that are treated as customers. I love the old time diners in nyc. This is not one of them. My family owned a diner for 40 years. They had pride in what they did and the fresh food was just what it should be. This place is the complete opposite. Stay away - there are so many better options up and down Broadway. After all these years I won't be back.",1,,

79,Dave L.,"New York, NY",25,340,10,4.0,11/24/2014,"The main attractions of this diner are:  1. it's 24/7 in a neighborhood where few are, 2. the front door reception is friendly and accommodating, 3. the waiters and busboys are fast and friendly, 4. the food comes out fast, 5. the menu is large enough to have something for everyone, and 6. the cost is reasonable.  Numbers 1-4 are true even when it's rush hour.  Note that excellent food is not one of these attractions--the food is good but you can find better elsewhere.  But then you'd have to be willing to maybe give up one or more of the above attractions.",6,3,1
80,PK G.,"New York, NY",5,51,27,4.0,10/4/2014,"I've been going to City Diner for over ten years now.  It's consistently good with large portions and a vast menu.  The diner could use a facelift from the aging 30s inspired décor but the food is constantly delicious and plentiful.I recommend the burgers, french fries, Popeye Salad with Chicken and Chicken Souvlaki with Greek salad.  Those are my favorites. The prices are reasonable and I typically make two meals out of one. Also noteworthy is the Roasted Turkey that comes with your choice of soup or salad, potato, vegetable, cranberry sauce and a delicious apple and almond stuffing.  It's like a Thanksgiving meal any day of the week.I'm just glad that we still have a decent diner in the neighborhood as more Starbucks and corporate owned franchises take over the city.City Diner is a real gem in this overpriced neighborhood teeming with obnoxious rich people, too many baby strollers pushed by non-white nannies and dog poop from corner to corner. :D",3,2,1

105,Reggie B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,8/12/2014,"Signed up for Yelp because I couldn't believe the negative reviews and three star average.I live a few blocks away from City, and as such it has been a cornerstone of my life for years, from early breakfasts to the very end of long, boozy nights.Quite simply, this place rocks.  Their food is--on the whole--much, much better than your standard NYC (or even Jersey) diner.  With all due respect, I have absolutely zero sympathy for the reviewer who complained that the ""broiled seafood combo"" was no good.  The broiled seafood combo?!  At a diner?!  What were you thinking??  I'd love to find a place that calls itself a diner at which ordering a 'broiled seafood combo' would end well.  I shudder to think at the aftermath.  Really.Anyway, this place Is a diner--use common sense and stick to diner food and you'll be very happy.I think their burgers and chicken fingers are the best on the UWS.  Despite what I said above, I have had some luck with more ambitious dishes.  The turkey dinner was, to my surprise, excellent.  The penne a la vodka is above average, as well (but if you want that, go across the street to Carmines).  Stay away from the roast beef sandwich--the one time I had it, the sandwich was totally dry and tasteless.  I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and order it again at some point in the future--were I craving roast beef--though.Service is lightning fast and incredibly friendly.  Especially to regs.  The main overnight waiter, Bobby, is quite a character.  During less health-conscious times, I would order delivery from City with shameful frequency, and they probably averaged 12 minutes from phone call to delivery.Am I biased?  As a neighborhood kid, its hard not to be.  But I can also be objective, and as a diner junkie, I can safely say that City Diner is far and away the best diner on the Upper West Side, and one of the best in Manhattan.",6,3,1

The manager had to get involved and figure out that she fucked up and gave me the correct change. No one Even apologized for the whole mix up! The new staff is horrible and it seems prices are changed every two days! Ridiculous ! Not going back here again,3,2,

110,Rebecca S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,4.0,2/4/2015,"Neighborhood diner that my family and I have been going to for 20+ years since it was formerly Argo. Classic New York City diner vibe with exceptionally fast service and open 24/7. Servers remind you of the ""good old days"" - they talk and move quickly and know everything about everything. City Diner is a very family-oriented place, you'll see the same people over and over. Delivery is fast and consistent. There is enormous variety on the menu and the food is consistently good no matter what you get. You can also tailor almost anything they have so you get exactly what you're in the mood for. Some of my family favorites are the chicken souvlaki, salads (particularly the cobb salad) and classic turkey sandwich.",1,,

I sat at the counter and ordered a side of vegetables, hash browns, tea, and toast. The appeal of the classic New York diner is that it is fast, cheap, comfort food, but that was not the experience I had at all. I was really surprised by how long I waited for such a simple order, about 30 minutes, and then I had to send back the hash browns for being so underdone. Then the check came out to 17 dollars! I was really disappointed, I will have to find the diner experience from my childhood elsewhere :(",3,1,

I also get the same things-- grilled cheese, waffles and egg white omelettes when I go-- and they are enjoyable.

Open 24 hours and reliable as ole faithful I would stop here anytime I need a fix for a good breakfast, a burger, thanksgiving dinner, pasta meal, milkshake, minestrone soup, BBQ sandwich, or basically anything but the kitchen sink (although that may be one of their weekly specials). So when you have that many items on your menu you're bound to be a jack of all trades, but master of none. Typical diner fare. It's my neighborhood diner of choice and i'll definitely be eating here often because it seems busy clean and efficient, but I don't really look forward to anything on the menu except when I'm hungry or hungover.  A respectable and reliable 3-stars in the most complimentary of ways.",,1,

I left City Diner unsatisfied and miffed at the expense. I ordered the ""bagel box"" with lox. The lox was fresh and delicious, but my bagel was untoasted and stale, the plate looked like they had just thrown everything onto it with no attempt at presentation and I got Philadelphia cream cheese in two tiny tubs on the side. For $13.95 I thought I would get something a little better than that. My boyfriend got the Mediterranean Omelette. It was ok...though they were quite stingy with the feta. His hash browns had potential but they lacked any kind of seasoning. The coffee had been sitting on the burner too long and just wasn't that good.

125,Julia D.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",445,302,16,2.0,11/18/2011,"You New Yorkers have a thing or two to learn about Diners. Sure, this has the look and feel of a diner, and it's got the superfluously large and extensive menu that a diner should doubtless have, but where is the glass-plated dessert viewing shelf? Where are the incredible fries? And the ability to hang out for hours without getting heckled by the waitstaff? Don't get me wrong, I came here with high expectations! Especially after perusing the impressive-looking menu, I was really getting excited. But after experiencing the way overpriced side of waffle fries that tasted slightly funky, and the well-meaning, but underwhelming Fiesta Salad, I felt like my dreams of finding a Jersey Diner equivalent in Manhattan were shattered. I must admit that my friend's burger looked phenomenal, but I felt like we were being consistently interrupted by the staff trying to shoo our meals along, even despite the fact that the diner was half empty! I just couldn't understand why they were trying to rush me along; I already eat way faster than any normal and self-respecting, elegant female should. Then we came to the dessert. Janine had ordered a warm apple crumb pie with ice cream, which I unfortunately did not try, but it didn't look like a good diner pie should look! This pie looked like a wilted plant instead of a super ostentacious peacock-pie, loaded with apples and brown sugar and calories, the way that it should. I recognize those analogies are whack, but I really felt passionate about them at the time.All in all, I can see the appeal of an all night diner like this one, but it just doesn't cut it for dinner. One whole point for being the venue I used to catch up with one of my closest friends!",4,,

I looked and it was the color and consistency of sloppy joe mix. Immediately I thought, ""This isn't just meat. This is cut with something like bread or something."" The fries are the big fat pillowy kind with no real taste to them or crispiness to make them anything other than ""bleh"".The prices are decent and I've heard from friends that the breakfast has a bit more going for it.

I have been here many times in the past and always thought this place was descent. However, they changed something about their food. I got the mighty bites, which are supposed to be sliders. But what came to the table instead were three regular size burgers.This wouldn't have been a problem however, the patties for the burgers looked like the ones you get in McDonald's. And they tasted even worse. They were dried out and the buns were old and stale. The cheese wasn't even melted!! The burgers tasted like they were cooked in the microwave! The French fries even sucked. They were thickly cut and not cooked enough. Plus, it seemed like they sat around a while before they were put on my plate. My friend had the split pea soup which she says was okay and a grilled cheese that was subpar. How do you mess up a grilled cheese? And sliders?We had to wait around for a while so we decided to fill the void of satisfaction from the food with some ice cream.

City diner has got some great hamburgers. The Fresh Burger Provencal served on a brioche with bacon, tomato and goat cheese is sinfully good. At $8.95, it's not a bad deal either and it's the perfect combination of things that are terrible for you. I'd recommend against getting the deluxe version. The fries are the thick kind that tend to get soggy. The menu is a taaad overwhelming. I'm pretty sure it's five pages long. I'd steer clear from 'fancier' dishes. Stick to the basics: quesadillas, any hamburger, nachos, BLTs, apple pie...you know... the kind of food a diner can handle. Also, the fancier dishes are pricier than they should be.

It's open 24 hours, it serves breakfast food all day, you pay at the counter and the mostly middle-aged and/or foreign waitstaff all seem like they kind of hate their lives, but you know what, they get it done. It's actually one of the nicer, cleaner places I've ever gone to when I'm in the self-loathing throes of dragging myself out of my apartment the morning after a night of regrettable, albeit entertaining, decisions. Come here for a drunken late-night grease fix, a hungover breakfast, or anytime you're craving something with cheese in it. If you want an actual ""real"" meal (i.e., NOT breakfast, a burger or a sandwich) and you care about it being a special experience, then go elsewhere.Look, I'm all for saying you should always get good service and great food when you're paying for someone else to serve you, but you also have to be a smart consumer.

This was like already my new jem.The food was good, I got cheese ravioli (a little plain but I really liked it,) mozzarela sticks, (YUM) and soup of the day (really unexpectedly good- I'd never tried asparagus soup but now I know I love it) which came with my entree! I thought that was pretty cool. The food portions were humongous and decently priced: the whole meal was only like $20 before tip for ALOT of food!  On to the staff, the guy over the phone was really nice, and the delivery guy was amazingly dedicated! I buzzed the guy into my apt. building and he seemed to be taking a very long time on the elevator, so I called the restaurant again to see what was up ( my building has two sides and it can be confusing which apts are on which side so I was worried he got lost) and the helpful guy on the phone told me he would call and check it out, but it turned out that my elevator was broken and the deliveryman had walked up all nine flights to deliver my food without so much as a call or complaint! I was shocked and touched by his awesome service! And, again, all at 2 in the morning!All and all, I will definitely be calling on them again, (even earlier in the night when other places are still open) and may even venture forth out of my apt. to actually pay them a visit!

The toppings were abundant and we definitely needed two hands to pick up the burger properly. The french toast was exquisite. The bread was crunchy and sweet. The maple syrup and whipped butter completed the breakfast plate. I enjoyed every bite!The fried egg sandwich was yummy. It wasn't anything too special since it was only 3 bucks but definitely worth the money. The ambiance was nice.

They made it fancier by going with a lot of dark wood rather than the same old red and white decor you see in many diners. I would totally recommend this spot for any breakfast lover or for any person that just loves diners in general!",,1,
158,Renee G.,"Bronx, NY",0,33,0,1.0,5/17/2014,"Diners have the most extensive menus and generally are only successful with very few items.  Not news to any of us.  But more than occasionally a meal stands out soooo poorly that to not warn other potential customers would be negligent.  That said, the 'fresh ground turkey burger' belongs in a can of generic cat food and don't expect your cat to live too long.  Though it might be freshly ground, it's what they're grinding that's of concern.  You know when your stomach and lower intestines are sad and pissed off at you.  Of interest is that the new owners have at least one other diner/coffee shop where they also don't know what they're doing.   And of course it's way too expensive.",2,,

Generally, their burgers never disappoint and their selection is extensive, almost a little overwhelming. The breakfast food is pretty standard, nothing extraordinary, but it always hits the spot. The service is speedy and their comfort food is very satisfying. If you are looking for a quick, easy meal, city diner is the place to go! The prices are pretty reasonable, although they recently bumped them up. The burgers are affordable but they overcharge for the deluxe version (ie fries). Also, their milkshakes are awesome.",,,

165,Arnold S.,"Sugar Land, TX",6,121,111,1.0,7/22/2009,"Went there at 5:30am on a recent Monday morning.  Place was virtually empty.  My gf and I wanted to sit at a booth near a window, the only complete booth near a window was back in the corner -- a round booth meant for like 6 people.  Figuring that there was no one else in the restaurant and the chances of a party of 6 to come in and want/need that big booth were slim, that's where we headed.  The rude manager immediately came up to us with a gruff look -- I pre-empted him by saying ""Oh sorry, is it ok if we sit here?"" -- I did this assuming fully that he would say sure it was fine.  He scoffed and said ""No it's not, why don't you come here..."" and then he tossed the menus onto an adjacent half-booth.  We were both surprised and I said ""Well there's really no one here and we prefer this one..."" and he said ""Fine."" and walked off.  Very rude.  My gf and I felt quite insulted.  Next the waitress came over with no smile, no good morning.  Rude.  Her demeanor persisted throughout.  I emphasized that I wanted lettuce & tomato instead of hash browns and she messed that up too.Overall:  WILL NOT GO BACK TO THIS PLACE EVER.  There are too many good places to go to in NYC -- places with nice, professional service.  Two days later we went to the nearby other diner on Bdway b/w 94th and 95th -- much better.",8,1,3
166,Garrett M.,"Southington, CT",6,11,0,3.0,8/21/2010,"Let's just say the City Diner on Broadway lived up it's name as the food was great and the service was very kind. As we entered, I immediately noticed the typical faux wood and vinyl seats and the atmosphere made me feel like the diner of my past. After being seated fairly quickly, our server politely introduced her self and handed us the simple menu. Since I had a large appetite this morning, my selection was the number six, which came with three fluffy pancakes and a choice of breakfast meat. My hunger got the best of me and it ""forced"" me to order an additional two eggs and a side of toast.The pancakes were buttery and moist with a texture of perfectly spun cotton candy. Aside this mountain of homemade awesomeness, stood three thick cut and perfectly seasoned slices of bacon. The only criticism that I had with the pancakes, was the slight taste of burnt shortening which coated the top layer of the stack. One of my dining companions offered to share some of his sausage, and I was immediately delighted to snap into the natural casing of this flavourful meat product. Sitting aloft my pancakes where two eggs cooked over easy which almost bankrupted me at two dollars a yolk. While lacking seasoning, the yolk remained runny which made a perfect companion for my order of white toast. The toast was mediocre because it didn't have butter on it. She didn't ask and I didn't either. All in all City Diner is a great place to grab a breakfast.",,1,

169,Samantha G.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,68,7,3.0,9/11/2010,"Let me preface my review by saying I ran 18 miles before eating here--so really I should have been an easy customer.I looked through the menu and saw they had an ""egg white low cholesterol omelet"" that had peppers, onions, mushrooms, and basil. I was immediately sold. The waitress was extremely friendly, and when I ordered I must have just said ""egg white omelet with cheddar cheese"" instead of saying ""egg white low cholesterol omelet with cheddar cheese"" because the omelet I got had no veggies in it. I figured it was my fault, so I didn't even bring it up to her (though technically she never came by my table again until after the busboy had cleared my plates so really I had no opportunity to ask her.)The home fries were average. They weren't terrible, but they were a little on the dry/bland side. The coffee however was excellent. Strong  without being bitter or burnt tasting.I also got a piece of chocolate cake to go, which was the saving grace of this diner. Very moist and fresh tasting. Rich without being sickeningly sweet.But really my biggest gripe about this place was the price. $8.95 for an egg white omelet and then you charge me an additional $1.50 for cheese?? And at $5 per slice I would have expected a bigger sliver of cake. I couldn't believe my brunch set me back over $16 when I didn't even have a mimosa!If I were ever in the area I would give this place another try for a ""real meal.""",,,

They are always totally cool about our off-menu sandwich order, and the turkey they put in there is genuinely good. Another bonus? They've got freaking delicious sweet potato fries, served just the way I like them: crispy, thin, and hot.So if you want some high calorie food in a clean, friendly diner environment, head to City Diner for a Tet Offensive and some sweet potato fries.

My other companion had the chicken souvlaki plate which, by the looks of it, she enjoyed (that is to say she devoured it). I wanted a light dinner so I went with the asparagus, beet, walnut and goat cheese salad. My partners' two plates were delivered quickly and my salad made it to the table nearly 10 minutes later. This was mystifying, since theirs required cooking and a salad merely requires assembly. Exasperated, my two companions summoned the manager which finally caused the overdue salad to materialize. I will say that the salad had walnuts, asparagus (mostly stalk) and goat cheese aplenty and yet it still managed to be pretty bland (the beets appeared to be the tinned variety, not fresh). A diner is not supposed to be haute kweezeen nor do I expect it to be. But a certain baseline of flavor, freshness, and decent service is not unreasonable to expect. I won't be back.",2,,

A really mediocre burger (dry, flavorless), unseasoned fries, and no refills on the soda to boot (c'mon, do you know how much that refill costs them? Next to nothing. They're probably paying their server more for the minute it takes them to walk to the soda machine and back). The service is fine and waitstaff all friendly, so that's good, and the atmosphere is classic diner (also a plus), but the food just kinda sucks and the prices really offend me...
