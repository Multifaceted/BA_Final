0,Jocelyn R.,"Jersey City, NJ",147,51,24,5.0,11/12/2018,Monkey room is the perfect place to go for a low key night of drinks with friends and great food! Ive been here twice and both times I've had the red sangria and the margaritas. The sangria is definitely the better one of the two and the pitchers are pretty big. It can be expensive if you don't go for their happy hour but I believe that it was well worth it.I reluctantly ordered the penne vodka with chicken thinking to myself that there is no way that dish from a bar could be amazing but it was more than amazing! I am currently drooling over the thought of the perfectly seasoned chicken and creamy vodka sauce. I really fell in love with it!If i lived closer by Monkey Room would be my new go to spot! I can't wait to visit again!,2,,2
1,Dhesiay T.,"Meatpacking District, Manhattan, NY",241,22,71,5.0,9/5/2018,"I love this place! I remember when i turned 25! I had an amazing time! I have like immense anxiety about large bills and people like banging it or not giving sufficient money... so i really loved that they split the bill into 2s. I had an amazing time! Good music, amazing people, hookah and great bartenders!  I never get tired of coming here... its like a guaranteed good time!  People are super friendly and nice! I recall the night of my birthday random people bought me drinks! Even on other times people were super cool and chilled! Parking is a little pain in the arse,  i recommend cab and or bus!",1,,
2,Sharinna L.,"Bronx, NY",116,3,1,5.0,10/18/2018,"Came here for our birthday earlier this month, and we had such a great time. Low key spot, bottle service and the bartender was so helpful!!! Hookah is $25.00 and $10.00 refill which is not bad. The music was on point, small space but really a good time. I will definitely be back soon!!!!",,,
3,Samantha K.,"Westgate, NY",0,4,6,5.0,10/7/2018,"Came in on a whim because it was close to where we were staying.... omg this place is so awesome! Hookah, drinks, and fucking awesome music with DJ! Guy knows his shit! Tenders are on point! Seriously been in NYC for 3 days and this is a great find!",,,
4,Katherine A.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",51,6,13,5.0,9/20/2018,"Delicious food and wonderful service!  everyone who worked there was pleasant and helpful.  they were on top of everything.  the staff seemed to be happy with their job, which made the environment palpably good spirited.  I'll definitely be coming back. Recommended this place 200% prices are very good as well.",,,
5,Ashley A.,"New York, NY",3,91,202,4.0,4/20/2018,"Pleasantly surprised by this Washington Heights gem! Came here for a happy hour and left well drank, full, and happy. The casual cool setting is comfortable and inviting. The sliders looked good and tasted even better. The best part of this meal was the mojito. The many drink and food options here make it a place to visit!",,,
6,Nicole G.,"Kingston, NY",65,18,13,5.0,7/4/2018,Been here twice with my bf and each time it has been fantastic! There are two rooms. One in the front with high rise tables and one in the back with booths called the monkey room. The roof can be opened which was pretty cool. Each time we went it hasn't been that crowded and the service was impeccable each time. We ordered the honey bbq wings and steak tacos. The bbq wing sauce is the best I've ever had and it has been unable to be beaten anywhere else. You have to try these. You don't even need the blue cheese dressing that comes with it. This sauce could be eaten with anything. The steak tacos were cooked to perfection and you have have them as well. The guacamole was fresh and delicious. The drinks are pretty cheap and very tasty. They make them perfectly. The service was awesome as well & we will definitely be coming back here.,,,2
7,Omar M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",2,17,0,1.0,6/14/2018,The regret I feel for ending up in this place is comparable to a drunk driver who runs down a person each time I end up here. 1 is it is always a sausage fest 2 the drinks are watered down and over priced 3  it feels like being a cockroach forced to live in a tightly packed can of sardines.I hate this place and I don't know why end up here but I have begged and demanded with the ppl I know to never end up here and what happens I always end up here. The only place worse is Dyckman bar.,,,
8,Irina G.,"Hawthorne, NJ",155,70,61,5.0,5/31/2018,"This spot is so popping and packed cannot get a spot edgewise. We didn't even get a chance to eat or drink but I will deF be back...They have a front outdoor section, high tops, bar and back that's open as well. Great set up",,,
9,Mariya Z.,"New York, NY",12,28,78,3.0,8/6/2017,"Cool drinks offer - just get there between 5 and 7. They have frozen margaritas!!! And we also tried ""coconut mojito"" which many places unfairly call so instead of piña colada with mint. Both drinks were acceptable but not greats. we also  have tried mozzarella sticks-  its not very impressive because they were bitter from cooked in not so fresh oil probably. The other great thing why I liked this place is the backyard! So nice to sit there! Oh and they have free hookah on Monday after 7 I believe with order. Yay!",,,
10,Alfredo R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,2.0,7/13/2018,Buffalo wings were horrible...no buffalo sauce....smh... onion rings tasted like cheap as well.......,,,
11,Samantha R.,"Seattle, WA",338,12,0,5.0,6/3/2018,"My favorite bar in NYC! Lucy is my favorite bartender in the city, she's really welcoming and lovely, and makes excellent drinks! I always love the music playing here too, and Monday's has Free Hookah! Happy Hour here is pretty unbelievable. I've never eaten here but I would like to try the food next time.The patio is gorgeous and coZy! this place is such a hidden gem in the neighborhood! I love Monkey Room!",1,,
12,Victoria T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",14,199,431,2.0,11/17/2017,"Did not find this place to be anything special. Chicken wings are pretty good, sweet potato fries were ok, and nothing special to say about their drinks. If you like hookah, this place may appeal to you more. Didn't enjoy the general atmosphere. I also would like to say that my review may be partially influenced by the other patrons. My friend and I were there to chat over drinks and eat some bar food and a man came up to us and would NOT leave us alone even when we made it clear we had no interest in speaking with him.",,,
13,Carlos O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",93,350,756,4.0,8/17/2016,"I been a fan of this place for a very long time i have over 5 years going to this place. Very friendly place to meet people. The place is located in a good area and you can easily get there by taking the (A) train. As far as the theme its cool i like the older one better with the firescape above the chairs inside. Last time i went inside they opened up a section in the back looks really nice.The drinks and the beers here are on point i never had to give the bartenders a complaint. Im not sure why they went from real tabacco to the herbal one, but i would preffer if they go back to the one they had before.Keep in mind theres no dancing allowed. This is one of those places to have a good chat spend some time with family and friends. I know they have a kitchen now but i havent try the food yet.Try them out in your in the washington heights area you wont be dissapointed.",4,,1
14,De W.,"Queens, NY",1,10,0,3.0,6/21/2018,I didn't stay there for very long (about 90 minutes) but it was just okay. Nothing terrible and nothing spectacular. Pretty average bar. If you're just looking for a chill place for a drink it's just fine. I didn't get anything to eat (just drinks) so I can't comment on the food selection.,,,
15,Jennifer C.,"Manhattan, NY",89,127,407,3.0,7/5/2016,"It's an okay spot to go chill, and have a few beers/drinks. I usually never come here because they have hookah (hate that stuff), but the staff makes it an inviting place to stay to enjoy their service. Overall, I would say that  monkey room is a place to come chill and watch any available sports game.",1,,
16,Ruben P.,"Woodside, NY",389,3,2,5.0,8/20/2017,"I've been to a number of bar/ lounges in the Heights.  I've even been to Monkey Room a number of times. But this time Kristen made this birthday experience for my friend beyond incredible. She overheard us cheering to my friend's birthday and returned with shots for us, the DJ acknowledged the birthday girl, she went out of her way to secure a table in a better area of the lounge. To boot, the coconut margaritas were amazing and overall service was second to none. Because of this experience, Monkey Room is one of the best lounges/bars in the Heights.",,1,
17,Gabby A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",103,4,1,2.0,8/29/2017,We had A very good server and the music was good but they closed way before their closing hours ! Not a fan of places who claim they are open till 4 but close at 3 I am as still a paying customer,,,
18,Mel L.,"New York, NY",7,31,6,5.0,9/24/2016,"Awesome place, solid food, great customer service and has a great back seating area- I love the happy hour (3-7pm)always a pleasure coming here",2,,
19,Jeesun K.,"New York, NY",27,21,225,5.0,9/21/2016,I visited this place after visiting the cloisters nearby. Its happy hour is amazing. It's from 3pm to 7pm - beer costs only $3 and wine costs only $4 (more beverages are on discount too but I only drink beer and wine so I can't remember the details for the others).My friend and I stayed here for about three hours and had a great time. There's a patio in the back where you can hang out and have a conversation without much noise from the tv or music.I will definitely visit again when I'm in the area!,1,,
20,Karla A.,"Bronx, NY",344,121,136,2.0,5/19/2015,"Um. You would think that this place is poppin just by hearing the name. But honestly, the vibe was boring, and they didn't really have diversity in their drinks. So I ordered a Blue Moon for $5, which is not bad at all, but I normally order cocktails.I don't know what was it about this place, but I just wasn't really feeling it. I just sat at the bar and didn't even bother to dance.I didn't hate this place, but I doubt I'll be coming here again.",2,,
21,Kelly G.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,232,185,3.0,4/15/2016,As shitty as I thought it would be. The drinks are super expensive and service was rushed. Our bartender was hovering over us until we ordered within the first 30 seconds we arrived. She had to leave so we had to hurry up and pay. When we didn't fill out our receipt fast enough she had an attitude. Overpriced!!Definitely not worth it!Lucy single handedly changed our rating of this place from one to three stars. She took the time to come over and introduce herself to us after the crappy bartender left. She definitely made our experience MUCH better! Thank you:)!,3,,2
22,Rosly R.,"Bronx, NY",0,7,1,5.0,6/26/2016,"I been a fan of this place for years! I go elsewhere and I'm never as happy as when I come here. The food is great, the waiter is amaZing and always caters to my friends and I. Best hookahs in town and dj after 10pm is freaking amazing.This place doesn't get any better. Forever a fan!",1,,
23,Corinne S.,"Templetown, Philadelphia, PA",0,2,0,5.0,9/6/2017,I just moved to the area and my food has always been great. The outdoor patio is a nice spot but the music can be a little too loud sometimes. The service has always been great and the staff is extremely friendly. I would definitely recommend this place and plan to go back!,,,
24,Luz P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",97,1,0,5.0,8/20/2017,"So much fun. Coconut margaritas are delicious and hookah was great. Our server/bartender Kristen was absolutely amazing and on top of things. I downloaded this app just to leave a review about how amazing she was. If you want a good night out with great service and Spanish music, this is the spot!",,,
25,Tina N.,"Bronx, NY",0,100,277,3.0,2/5/2016,"I'd give a three because it's small. Private room and outside is overall small. My friend threw a party there and they overbooked the private room for another event. The entire staff had no idea what was going on, they didn't even know the party I attended was throwing a party. Bright side The appetizer food was. Bad side It's get packed pretty fast.",,,
26,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,4.0,3/4/2014,"Came here recently off the cuff for a night out with some friends. First and foremost, damn near ANY place in the Heights that I choose to check in at gets an automatic 3-4 stars from me...why you say? The females dammit! Damn this curse of loving the look of Latinas! Just can't help it! Other than that...this place is pretty cool, especially if you live in the area. Gets PACKED on a Saturday night but the bartenders are cool people and the drinks are of fair price. Music is mostly reggeton/bachata but that is to be expected for a spot in the Heights, Wouldn't of minded more of a mixture of hip-hop and some dancehall but it happens.Nonetheless very cool spot to go to, especially if you do not wanna go over the top in spending a lot for a club or bottle service lounge in the area.",3,3,4
27,Green S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,12,2,1.0,5/12/2016,"I stopped by to chilax at the bar with a frozen margarita and yuca fries. It was the worst drink ever. I don't know what it was but certainly not a mango drink, as there was more of a super acidic lime drink with chemicals. The yuca was fried in old oil where seafood or something was fried before. They were soggy and left a horrible after taste. I will just pay my hard earned $20 and leave never to return.After I posted my review, I received two messages from ""Luz L"" """"The Yuca fries and drinks are the best. Your personality and presence left a bad taste. She also said "" You have problems lady, you seem to be a sad old lady."" Let's guess who Luz L. is. Apparently, they can't handle criticism to their cocktails and drinks and feel free to send insults to one's personality, mood and age easily. I'm not surprised. The human quality matches the food and drinks quality. If you have to go there, just stay away from the bar and go with the bottled beer.",4,5,2
28,John G.,"Pleasantville, NJ",0,5,5,5.0,12/26/2015,Yucatan Fries on point. All the food I've had here has always been A+. Drinks are always good no issues. Fast service when  dining in and fast service at the bar. Great pricing on all menu items.,,,
29,Tiffany P.,"New York, NY",78,16,1,3.0,9/6/2016,Monkey Room isn't what it use to be. The drinks taste extremely watered down now. What happened to you guys?,,,
30,D S.,"New York, NY",18,36,10,4.0,6/5/2016,"We go here for brunch once in a while and it's surprisingly good. They have standard brunch fare - omelettes, salads, sandwiches, two free mimosas, standard kids options, and so on. It's not very imaginative, but the service is good and they're very friendly. Almost nobody comes for brunch so it's not uncommon to have the back seating area to ourselves, which is great with a toddler.",,,
31,Helen R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",31,2,21,4.0,2/27/2015,We will be re-open TODAY WITH OUR exceptional Mega HappY Hour from 3pm to 7pm (everyday) that you can't missed it. New Garage and kitchen... Just pass by,1,,
32,Priscila R.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",40,68,176,4.0,3/27/2015,This place is pretty chill if you're looking for a place to grab a beer and some food with your friends. I came here for happy hour my drink was strong which was a plus I guess. The food was oh so delicious and I enjoyed the back room that had heating cause loord it was cold!,,,
33,Cynthia M.,"Bronx, NY",42,3,3,5.0,4/9/2015,I love the monkey room!!!! I always have an amazing time when I'm there. The staff are sweet and attentive. The outdoor patio makes you feel like you're on vacation. Oh and the food is so delicious!!!! Not your typical bar. I always recommend this bar to all my friends.,,,
34,Bartolo J.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/27/2016,"Great place, Love every minute of it! I Visit this Establishment at least once a week! Have no complaints, Food is amazing and drinks are also great!

36,Joey M.,"Manhattan, NY",40,6,12,5.0,10/9/2015,"Great ambiance , good music , good people . this place has changed over the years and everytime it seems to get better. They've recently added a kitchen I havn't gotten a chance to try the food although I hear it's great. awesome awesome spot with great staff!",,,
37,Carlos T.,"Bronx, NY",199,54,21,1.0,1/10/2015,"Be very careful with this location. This place was my go to spot with friends. Great Happy Hour, a good bang for your buck. Recently these people have  been up to some silly and sad antics. They're pouring cheap liquor into top shelf bottles and serving it as top shelf liquor. The Hennessy VSOP is not VSOP, even the Jack Daniels isn't Jack! If you're going to this location just order a bottled beer and a patron shot...that's if it is patron smh. With such an upcoming neighborhood and tons of local bars I don't seem to comprehend why this is being done. Wish them the best of luck.",8,2,
38,Andre N.,"Jersey City, NJ",519,372,245,4.0,4/15/2013,"Came here to  hear DJ Genesis, free hookah on a Monday night. The place was pretty much Hispanic where in the heights.  The bartender looked as if she had an enormous amount of plastic surgery. Super friendly and kept a smile on her face.  DJ was in the booth spinning top 40s and Reggaeton.  Some people were dancing an extreme amount of spinning.  There were men spinning each other. They were spinning like a effin top, Amazing to see. In terms of the women they were dressed to impress everyone looked fab for a Monday night.I didn't smoke the hookah. What I did notice the shisha had a trendy encasing that I never seen before.  Good smells of blue mist hit the air. Cool spot for Monday nights of boredom.",4,2,
39,Richard B.,"Bronx, NY",968,997,600,3.0,1/31/2011,"A fun Hookah/American bar to come listen to Spanish, hip hop and even some dance music and it wasn't as loud as I thought it would be! My hearing was still there when I woke up the next morning. Hookah was awesome, very mellow and didn't make me cough at all. I can't give this place more stars because I had to yell at the bartender when I first got there. She didn't tell us she didn't take credit card until I asked her, like she was waiting to fuck me over and surprise me. I almost lost it with her only because I had read the reviews on Yelp about her and/or her coworkers brain damage. I also had to beg for more charcoal for my hookah every time it went out even while everyone else had three charcoals on their hookahs. Mixed drinks were also $9 and not very strong. At least the Bud Limes in the metal bottle were icey cold.",5,4,4
40,Nena R.,"New York, NY",0,43,0,5.0,9/22/2015,Monkey room is my favorite place to be.Great Happy hour everyday from 4 to 7 pm and free hookah on Mondays.Food is cheap and delicious .Waiters are very friendly Music is a mix of everything.I am there at least once a week.,,,
41,Tania A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",27,3,0,5.0,2/27/2015,"They unveiled their brand new kitchen today, and the food was outstanding! The Yucca Fries were crisp and delicious! My burger was cooked to perfection! I'd recommend everyone to come in and give their menu a taste!",1,,
42,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",59,21,7,4.0,6/1/2015,"First off i have been coming here for years and it has changed a lot and for the better. It is no longer just a neighborhood bar but also a restaurant serving some of the best burgers and onion rings around. The renovations have made the back patio a lovely place to enjoy food and drinks. I was there last on a rainy Sunday so the retractable roof was appropriately closed but it created a enjoyable ambiance. Only issue with the outside couches is that they could use some upholstery as there is what i assume is water damage. Its nice that i can also bring my 9 year old son inside despite one obnoxiously drunk patron, its a wonderful little spot for everyone.",,,
43,Grace F.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/23/2016,Friendly staff! Cool sunroom in the back where you can enjoy free hookah Monday! So glad I stopped in to check out this spot.,,,
44,Jorge O.,"Manhattan, NY",16,66,6,5.0,3/23/2015,"Friendly service, great drinks, awesome spot in the area. The food looks great- the wings are amazing! Perfect after work to grab a quick drink or go and watch some sports!",,,
45,I P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/27/2014,OVERCHARGED my Credit Card and gave me FAKE DRINKS. OVERCHARGED: I was there on Sunday and my total with the tip added was $49 my credit card got charge $54 and my friends credit card was also overcharged. FAKE DRINKS: I order Patron shots but I was given poor quality tequila; yet i was still charged for premium tequila/Patron.,7,2,1
46,Troy M.,"Long Island City, NY",37,137,10,3.0,6/5/2012,"For what it was worth, I actually had A LOT of fun here. I came at the suggestion of one of my friends that lives in the area. I always try to step my latin dance game up, so I figure this place would be just right. It did not disappoint. Beautiful that could dance and did not mind dancing with an American, lol. The bar looked stacked, I just was not in the mood to drink. The one drink I did have is Brugal neat. Can never go wrong with that, lol. There was a point in the night where the DJ just did not give a damn about the people and what they wanted to listen to because people were complaining about the DJ running everything over and over again. I'm not a Hookah fan, but no one I was with complained about the price, so I figured it was pretty good stuff for the price they paid. It struck me a little odd that the bouncers were checking to make sure men and women did not go in to the bathroom together, yet there were condoms sitting in a cup in the bathroom. I guess if you managed to sneak by him or sneak in the corner, everything will be alright?Oh well, I'll be back.",3,6,
47,Gregory B.,"New York, NY",90,5,0,5.0,4/9/2016,"Definitely my favorite bar in the heights.  They have some good craft brews on tap, and the mixed drinks are always just right.  Some nights they got a DJ that keeps it live with accompanying music videos on all the TV screens.  I recently ordered the guac & chips and gotta say they were awesome. The chips were some real deal home made chips, not the kind just out of a bag.  They were served hot, and nice and crispy.  The guacamole was also as fresh as it gets and real tasty.",,,
48,Massi T.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/20/2015,"I must say when I chose the Monkey Room to have a party, it was simply because I wanted a patio and just a place to gather my friends. Apparently, they have made fantastic renovations and it was beyond my expectations. The service was superb and appetizers and drinks were yummy!! I am incredibly grateful to Kelba and the entire staff for making my day one to remember! My family, friends, & I are overjoyed by it all! Thank you & Until the next time!!!",,,

54,Jen P.,"New York, NY",48,33,21,5.0,1/8/2014,"Came here with a few cousins and friends on Monday night and had a blast. There was free hookah and the bartender was lovely. She was beautiful and had an awesome personality. Prepared one of the best drinks ever. We drank ""Dominican Shots"" and another wonderful drink. Great ambiance.

I have no problem going out and spending money on top shelf alcohol but to be served and looked at as an idiot is not the way to conduct business in such a competitive market like Washington heights..

56,Lewis S.,"West Bronx, NY",238,14,26,4.0,3/14/2014,"Came here for the first time for a coworkers birthday and had a great time. The music was good (spanish, oldies, EDM).

57,Herman H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,3,4.0,3/6/2015,"I've been to this spot a number of times with a friend of mine who lives near by. After reading a couple of past reviews I had ask her, whats up with this place? She said, just meet me there! The first thing i did was order a beer and a shot of Henny and got exactly that. No watered down or imitation version. They added a small kitchen to the place and the food was off the hook. The bathrooms are always clean and the rear area with the retractable top was nicely done. I did have to get the bartenders attention more than once but other wise i had a great time.",1,,

59,Elsa G.,"New York, NY",176,188,3,1.0,1/27/2010,"There really are NO good bar options in Washington Heights (except the new Locksmith Bar on Broadway. But even then, maybe only on off times and not weekend nights).  My bf and I came here to watch a baseball game one Wednesday night.  The place was empty except for a small Dominican family with their kids running and shouting with absolutely no attention paid to them at all.  I ordered a Margarita on the rocks and it was AWFUL.  It was sour in a bad way.  Kind of like salt water with no citrus flavor in it at all.  The color was a slightly yellowish tint.  Now, here's the worst part of all.  My bf pointed out that the bartender was eating chicken wings behind the bar and constantly licking and sucking his fingers then making the drinks without washing his hands at all.  OMG.  As we sat there finishing up the game, a few regulars (i.e. middle-aged, rough looking alcoholics) started wandering in.  The minute the game ended we were out of there.  What a s***hole.",5,1,1
60,Emmanuel P.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",60,46,3,3.0,12/31/2012,I have been to this place once and had an okay night.  The drinks were okay.  I didn't like the crowd...  It seems like a cool place to have drinks and smoke hookah.  I don't know if it's at the top of my list.,,,
61,Dino S.,"Jersey City, NJ",89,66,30,5.0,6/6/2010,"Yes, the music is loud, but there's a patio out back where there is none of that. I went last night with a couple of friends, and we made a beeline for that patio. Drinks were 2/$5 before (i thiiiink) 8 PM. Unfortunately, the taps weren't working, so we could only get bottles. The restrooms were clean, and private, and there's two of them. That being said, the place is fairly small, so you're talking two restrooms for not that many people. I've been to night clubs where they have two restrooms, and there's like eleventythousand people in there. Not the case here. There was a reasonable amount of crowd. The people there were friendly, and the bartenders didn't mind us taking a year and a day to make up our minds. Frankly, I think that when you're paying such low prices, you set the bar (get it? get it?) fairly low. Also, considering this neighbourhood, you don't expect this magical experience. Who cares? It's a freaking bar that sells drinks at 2/$5. They have free hookah night on Monday (as the poster in the restroom proclaimed). Nobody gives a darn if you go there and have just a couple of beers over the course of two hours. You can go with friends, hang out for a bit, and get home without feeling like you've been robbed. Go. Check it out, but go with no expectations.",1,2,
62,B N.,"Montclair, NJ",999,241,85,2.0,12/4/2011,"I came here once with that girl the streets call, ""La India."" I wasn't looking to be wow'd or anything, but this place disappointed more than not.We hit the spot around 11pm on a Saturday night in the late summer. I order a trusty long island iced tea. I notice the bartender is kinda cute. and fit.La India asks me what she should get as she's not used to ordering mixed drinks. She said she wanted something sweet, not too strong, so I suggested sex on the beach. She replies, ""the beach?"" and looks confused. I explain it's the name of the drink. Anyway, I don't think she was following me on that one (maybe too often i'm sarcastic?) So she shares her dilemma with the bartender. The bartender seemed sweet, and very wanting-to-be-helpful, but I'm really not sure she knew what she was doing back there. She didn't really give a definitive answer of what she would make, but came up with something that fairly pleased La India. As far as my long island, over the years it has become very clear to me that some people can make a good one, and some people may just be working on a chemistry experiment to see how close they can come to making alcohol taste like turpentine. This cute, fit bartender would fall into that latter category.Monkey Room has a private deck out back with tables, chairs and umbrellas. Cool. Perfect spot for us to lounge, and people can smoke comfortably if they wish. The only problem is, they close the deck at midnight. And they start giving warnings of this at 11:30. We asked why they close it and they said their neighboring business (a restaurant I think) has periodically complained about the noise in the past. Seriously? After midnight? There were 3 or 4 groups out there this night and all holding their convos at a respectable level. That's too bad, because we would have stayed longer could we have stayed out there - but when we re-entered the bar upon the deck closing, it was packed a**hole to bellybutton in that piece, and it's not even that big of a place anyway. We were ready to get out of there at that point. There was nothing worth staying one minute longer.",3,3,5
63,Ghislane N.,"Bronx, NY",1,4,0,3.0,4/19/2011,I visit this place on a Monday night after a long day at work and it was actually real nice very low key nice music nice bartender and the price was even better. Oh and they had free hookah on Monday so that was a plus. I will recomend this place to my friends and I will be visiting this place again and on a weekend!,,,
64,Nathaniel C.,"Austin, TX",85,192,0,5.0,5/29/2010,"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the awesome drink specials that go on until 9pm! (currently anyway) This is definitely the best bar in this area, even if it is a little small and crowded at times. The service is friendly and when I asked to sample beer, not only were they not bitter about it, they gave me more than a little! My friend and I went there recently and gave us free pretzels! Free! Now free always makes things taste better, but nothing tastes better than free combined with affordable beer! I'm more than a little happy I found this place.",,,1
65,Sara M.,"New York, NY",403,338,4,3.0,2/10/2009,"I once went to a Halloween party here. It's a small bar and it was pretty crowded but I was an Anime character so I didn't care. All was right in my world. I had a little too much too drink so I decided I should wait in line for the restroom, (trying to think ahead). Two single bathrooms with two separate lines that faced eachother. When I was next, I looked up at  the next person on the other line and our eyes locked. There was something so familiar about that woman with the blonde wig. Did I go to school with her? Maybe.While applying more make-up I kept thinking about this woman... she's too old to have been in school with me, she's at least 8 years my senior... who the hell is she? How do I know her? Did she recognize me? It sure seemed like she did. I push it to the back of my mind and head to the bar. Patron please. Thank you. I look up and there she is again, and she's looking at me too. She must want me. She's cute so I'm flattered. But, I dunno if that's it. I think she recognizes me too. Where the hell do I know her from? Ok, now it's bothering me. I sit next to my friend Hector (RIP) who was the bouncer and ask him if he knows her. He says something along the lines of her being a professional. I think he means she's a lawyer. Then she starts to dance in front of me.BAM!I know that beyatch!!!! From Sue's Rendezvous! yelp.com/biz/sues-rendez… I just didn't recognize her without her pole and with clothes on! She was my first lapdance, she spent the whole song telling me about her boyfriend troubles. Great. I'm in a place where a hoe goes to party. I left. But I had been back since then. It's a cute little bar. Emphasis on little.",3,12,7

67,John H.,"Portland, OR",28,10,1,1.0,4/16/2009,"I wish there were negative stars to leave...Awful, awful, awful.  I went here maybe 4 years ago and it was a decent little place... coffee / beer joint during the day, full bar at night.  Comfy couches around.Now?  No more couches or coffee.  Rude bartenders only catering to the obvious regulars (all but saying ""we don't want you here"").  Worst of all, it turns into an obnoxiously loud club wannabe when it's late enough. Go elsewhere and enjoy a bar where you actually feel good giving the bartender your money.",2,1,1

Washington.The place used to be kind of cool, but I always thought the bartender was unfriendly and the music always sucked. The place feels dirty (which can be cool, but just isn't here).

69,William A.,"New York, NY",4,14,0,3.0,9/24/2008,"I don't like this place. Before you even walk in the joint, you will notice that the outside facade has fake cardboard brick. CARDBOARD BRICK, ahh come on this is NYC, not the Jersey Shore. And then there is this huge M (I guess for monkey) on top of the awning, with what looks like a piece of poop dropping off its side. This is before you even walk in the place.The drinks are somewhat cheap, but the staff and bouncers are meatheadish. The place could have so much potential, especially with the outdoor seating.12-06-08 ***Edit*** It looks like they changed the fake fucking brick out front to a very tasteful slate stone. Wow, a month after posting my first critique for Monkey Room, they actually listened to my comments. Go yelp.",2,2,2
70,Charles D.,"New York, NY",1,5,0,2.0,2/18/2008,"And my search to find a neighborhood bar continues. I came into The Monkey Room around six on a Friday night. The place was dead, which was disconcerting. Even a great bar can have down nights, so I can forgive that. What I can't forgive as easily is the service. The bartender was the most surly and unfriendly I've ever had in my short but prolific drinking career. He did his best to let you know that you were unwelcome and a bother.This is a shame, since the decor isn't bad and the drinks aren't too expensive (the beer's a bit pricey). I'll probably give it another try sometime, but first I'll poke my head in and see if there's a different bartender.",2,1,2
71,Jady C.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,0,5.0,2/2/2013,"Sundays and Mondays are the best. Monday is free hookah night after 7 pm, they only take cash, but the music they play here is what you request. So if you want to hear red hot chili pepper during happy hour, you can. Happy hour is 3pm-7pm, wish it was longer. Employees are extra sweet and down to earth, cici is one of the best bartenders there. The manager is down to earth, and seems very aware of his business. Awesome place to hangout .",1,,

74,A. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",134,66,9,2.0,7/24/2012,So I've been to MR a few times and don't get me wrong I love it here but I realized that in the end of the night when they see I had a few drinks they overcharge me.  I've never questioned it because I figured hey I was drunk probably bought one drink too many for friends.  But I went this past weekend and I signed my receipt and took the signed one with me by accident.  Then I sign on and realize that they charged me $14 over what I signed.  I really don't respect that.  They will definitely lose my business and money as soon as I make a claim with my bank!,1,,

76,Pete C.,"Atlanta, GA",9,43,8,4.0,9/23/2007,"I read the 3 previous reviews and noticed that they are all from over a year ago.  A lot can change in that span of time.  This bar has a mix of everything.  The decor was great - a fire escape hanging on the wall, tapestry on the ceiling, 3 TVs showing sports behind the bar, cool high tables, a DJ table and a great outside patio in the back.  The crowd was a fantastic mix of ethnicities and races.  I like that in a bar because otherwise places take on a 'forced identity.'  The drinks were reasonable (well, beers were $5). There aren't a lot of drinking options up this part of the world so many different people are going to flock to it.  I was only there once, but I'm definitely going back.",,,
77,Laura M.,"New York, NY",127,66,0,3.0,1/22/2010,"I had no idea what to expect when I went to the Monkey Room for the first time, as bars in Washington Heights tend to suffer from an ""identity crisis"" of sorts: which crowd should they cater to? --The Dominicans who've been there forever, the recent college grads who love WaHi for its affordable apartments, etc. The answer, I found, was everybody! My bf and I popped in to watch the end of an NFL playoff game, and they did have the game on, though be warned--they do not have any special sports packages, so the games that are broadcast in your living rooms are the only ones they play here. The bar was a nice mix of people, and there were a handful of regulars who, upon arrival, asked the bartender for snacks, which are hidden in a case behind the bar. Turns out, if you ask, they'll give you a cup of whatever you want--popcorn, Doritos, etc. We definitely jumped on that as soon as we saw others doing it. The best part? Their happy hour prices are CRAZY. Beers were 2 for $5. There's a $20 minimum for credit cards, so we wound up staying a lot longer than we wanted (and drinking A LOT more than we planned) just to hit the credit card minimum. I believe happy hour is until 8, If you're on the 187 strip and need a place to drink, Monkey Room is great. I will definitely be back to check out the garden in the summer.",3,1,

Updated review","Monkey room is the only dve bar you can find in the Inwood section of Manhattan. It looks old and busted and gives you that feeling of being inside of Continental in St. Marks. They have a live Dj playing music which is cool. They also have this hot Dominican bartender who is very nice to look at. Overall is a good crowd with cheap drinks. Opened up a tab and drunk nothing but Gin and Tonic. Two jager bombs ad an Irish carbomb and blacked out by the end of the night. Good times. From what my boys told me, I stormed out screaming my x gf name. I guess thats what this bar will do to ya. You find all types of people in this bar which is cool. Not a bad place for a chill crowd and cheap drinks if you want to head to downtown or midtown.",,3,
79,Jean P.,"Manhattan, NY",176,224,43,3.0,7/23/2009,"Hmmm I had a okay time at this place but it may have greatly been in part to who I was with (seriously I could be in the Sahara Desert and still have a good time). The music wasn't too bad and they had good beer specials that night but when my JD fogged eyes started to clear, I saw sloppy looking girls spilling drinks and the guys ehhh whatever. The place was really crowded (annoying), small, and narrow but if I randomly want to go have drinks somewhere close with friends its alright. I originally had two stars, but there's something about seeing people from the neighborhood who thought they were the shyt in Junior High and High School looking like a sacks of garbage that I secretly enjoyed.",2,3,2

82,Jared S.,"New York, NY",2,1,0,3.0,6/27/2009,"As someone who prefers a relatively quiet, chill dive bar to something more trendy or wild, I found myself enjoying this place (despite some of the reviews I read) as I walked in the front door.  The music playing wasn't too loud, there were a few people at the bar, and I was greeted by a fair selection of handles (maybe 8), plenty from which to pick a decent draft (Goose Island Summertime).We sat out on the back patio, which was really quite nice on a clear Saturday night in late June.  The decor was pleasant back there, with some nice low-key lighting.  But, about half an hour after arriving, we were notified that the patio would be closing (about 11pm) and were siphoned back into the bar.  (Understandable, since there are people who live just above the bar, who may or may not like going to sleep before closing time...)By this time, the music had kicked up about 3 notches, the place was crowded with people, and I couldn't hear myself think.  I see what some people were saying about it being too loud and club-like.  I was glad I had already finished my beer--we left, seeking a place more amenable to conversation.All in all, though, as a neighborhood bar trying to cater to different crowds at different points in the night, I think it's fine.  Not great, but probably worth going back, just not too late on a Saturday.",1,,
83,Keuris S.,"Bronx, NY",10,45,10,4.0,8/1/2009,"I'm a fan of this place simply because of their good music and diverse crowd. Very Hidden which is good to know of in case you would like to surprise a friend about. The only NEG(-) is that Its to small which doesnt leave enough space to dance. They usually have good DJ's for the most part (not always the same) my fav is one called DJ Rookie TraX. The music is Gr8 and there sounds caters to the general pop and main stream public spinning the latest hits as well as what I'm a fan of a little of what I'd like to top of with.... Latin Bachata and so fourth. Price for a drink is like $9 ea. Which I don't agree with since the people attend are devoted fans who don't worry about being upscale at all but besides that the place gets packed,however this spot is to be kept on the low Shhhh!",,,
