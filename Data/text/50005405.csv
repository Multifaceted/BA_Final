0,Chrissy B.,"Queens, NY",16,113,189,4.0,9/16/2018,"We found this gem because it was near the Gershwin Theater and we had an hour to spare before our show started. The service was good and our food was delivered pretty quickly which I liked. Our waiter seemed to be taking his time which was slightly annoying especially since we told him we were on a time crunch (he made several trips just to take our orders which was weird; I figured why not just take all the orders at the same time?).Anywho, when we finally placed all of our orders, our food came literally in 5 minutes which I was really happy about; I mean after all, we mainly ordered pasta. I ordered the fettuccine funghi and it was really good. My mom ordered the spaghetti with some meat sauce but it was very bland. If I'm in the area I'd stop by again.",,,
1,Neil K.,"Old Bridge, NJ",60,91,11,3.0,11/9/2018,"Came for the Prix Fixed pre theater dinner $26.95, but only 2 dishes were at that price, all others had surcharges. We decided on ordering off the menu ala carte. Service was pretty good and attentive. Tables for two are close to each other. Food is just okay. Mussels came with some cold on top, hotter on bottom, and some unopened. Salad, arugula, gorgonzola, pear, walnuts, bacon, parmesan basket, Italian vinaigrette 13.95, was lacking the Gorgonzola and the basket was impossible to eat. Rigatoni Alla Siciliana, eggplant, tomato, basil and mozzarella had me searching for the eggplant. Wine by the glass had house wine with cheapest choice at $12.  Coffee and tea were $3.50.",1,1,1
2,Philippe L.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Canada",20,50,0,3.0,7/19/2018,"Got the Prix Fixe for dinner.  Soup was a broccoli purée and it was nothing spectacular, had the chicken parm for dinner which was completely drowned in tomato sauce thus masking any possible subtlety.  The prix fixe is 26.95 in midtown so I guess you can't ask for too much.  The tiramisu likely came from a box.I don't think I'd go back, this is fairly average Italian fare across the board.",,,
3,Dannie W.,"Boston, MA",41,321,730,4.0,11/8/2018,"The service is good. The seating is a bit tight. The food is good in general with a few offs. POLPO E CECI: the octopus is really good. I like the texture and the taste. The chickpeas and olives are very good combinations too. Definitely recommend this dish. BRUSCHETTA: horrible. It's probably one of the worst I've ever had. Just like a bunch of diced tomatoes are put on top of a piece of bread and have a piece of cheese on top. Nothing special. FETTUCCINE AI FUNGHI: tastes pretty good. The sauce taste and pasta texture are good. Just they say mixed mushrooms even though I can only see one type of mushroom. hazelnut ice cream: very good. Even though I'm not a hazelnut fan, I like the flavor a lot. Cream brûlée: it's ok. Wish the bottom layer to have more rich flavor and a bit more firm. Chianti from Tuscany: pretty good",,,
4,Ariana B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,16,0,5.0,10/23/2018,"I've been coming to Maria Pia for years before/after seeing shows and it's always been a lovely experience- with a reasonable/tasty prix fix option for theater district. A few weekends ago, my family and friends surprised me with a bridal shower at Maria Pia! It was absolutely seamless, the food was excellent Michael and his staff could not have been more accommodating to myself or my mother who was anxious to make sure the surprise and the afternoon went off without a hitch (which it did)! Absolutely recommend Maria Pia for a meal in the theater district or for your special event/party. The pricing is reasonable and the service is above and beyond!",1,,
5,Michael S.,"New York, NY",11,5,5,2.0,11/4/2018,This restaurant demonstrated that they only care about getting people out the door quickly. Everyone's food came cold and it was impossible to get the waiters' attention.,1,,
6,Jami P.,"Elkhart, IN",0,8,0,3.0,10/27/2018,"Quick service and turn of the tables; however, there was only 4 of us and they added gratuity to the bill and didn't tell us, refused to split our checks up and then when we asked if they did anything to celebrate birthdays they said oh yes and offered two choices to bring out but then charged us for it....never told us there was a cost!!  SCAM!  Ended up with a double tip!  Watch your bills!!",,1,
7,Lucie T.,"New York, NY",16,77,405,4.0,7/2/2018,Great for lunch or dinner. Near the theater district for affordable prices on great Italian food. The tiramisu was moist and delicious. I have been here before with my colleagues and always enjoyed the service.,,,
8,Jacqueline L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,35,58,3.0,6/7/2018,"I came here for the 1st time with a restaurant.com certificate. My son loves calamari but I find it tasteless but it came with the fried zuchini which was unique. The flavor of the chicken marsala was pretty good but the chicken breast is just too thinly sliced. The penne a la volka didnt taste like that sauce and it came in chucks of dry chicken breast. I definitely dont recommend that. Even though my son loves pasta, he didnt even eat half of it. Service: The waiter never checked on us and a 18% gratuity was automatically added.",1,,
9,Dina P.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,5,0,3.0,10/7/2018,"Had dinner for five last night just after 5pm. The room quickly filled up. The good:  quick and attentive service and reasonably priced, the burrata appetizer was delicious. The just ok:  food was fresh but not particularly well seasoned, the monkfish special was bland, as was the spaghetti and meatballs. The ravioli was meager at just 5 pieces. The bad:  the bathrooms were dirty and slippery, the noise level was very loud (forget about a romantic date night) and the gratuity of 20% was already added to the bill. Definitely check your bill. When the credit slip came back to sign there was still a blank line for tip. I hate to think how many people must unknowingly tip twice.",1,,

I came for its lunch pre-fixe menu and I was satisfied with the selection it offered at an affordable price of $15.95 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. It wasn't the best Italian food I've had, but it's not bad.I wish I sat in the back garden.

11,Rebecca D.,"Boston, MA",685,278,559,4.0,3/22/2018,"I've been here twice on my last two visits to NYC and have really enjoyed it. The food at Maria Pia is excellent, especially their homemade pastas like the butternut squash ravioli. Also appreciate how affordable the food is here ($20-30 entrees) which is sometimes hard to come by in the area. Speaking of the area, Maria Pia is located only blocks away from Times Square and the Theatre District which makes it a great low-key spot to visit before or after a show. Probably would have given this spot 5 stars, but considering the overwhelming smell of must here on my last visit, I have to deduct a star.",2,,

We just put Italian restaurant in Yelp and Maria Pia came up. I'm so happy it did. OMG!! Everything was so delicious. We shared the Caprese for an appetizer and it was so fresh and yummy.Main dishesI had the Lobster special which was lobster tail, shrimp, mussels and clams with fettuccine in a light  tomato sauce. Holy crap was it amazing. I almost cleaned my whole plate lolMy friend had the Ravioli Vodka which I tried and I loved. She also said it was very tasty.Dessert we shared the Hazelnut gelato....can I get a gallon of this....wow was it smooth and creamy.All in all this meal was perfect!!!",8,5,8

Our server Alejandro was very accommodating, greeted us nicely, told us the specials of the day and helped me pick out a nice wine. This place is only a couple blocks from time square so you can even walk there after. We had the fried calamari as a appetizer and then I had the chicken parm dish while my partner had a pasta dish that was also Amazing. I'm going back with friends soon !",,,
15,Jo Ann G.,"Knoxville, TN",0,30,0,5.0,8/23/2018,"Loved it.  Great setting, great service. Best chicken Marsala I've ever had.  Very aromatic and equally pleasant tasting.  Very fresh broccoli and I grow it and it was just like my fresh cut broccoli. Delicious risotto also.  Not too crowded so we could sit and enjoy the meal and visit.  Most people around me enjoyed a long evening meal. I will recommend to all.",2,1,1

Great for a late night bite, but come early so you can enjoy a wonderful dinner.",,,
20,Nikki N.,"New York, NY",1,7,0,3.0,8/16/2018,"Came here for dinner last Friday. We ordered bruschetta for an appetizer, a veal scaloppini and lobster ravioli dish. The flavor of the lobster ravioli was drowned out by a heavy red sauce which made it difficult to appreciate the flavor... it could have been chicken ravioli  and I would not have know the difference.  A light olive oil or white sauce would be better.  The bruschetta, was just thick slices of toast with tomatoes (nothing impressive; I would pass on this if I ever go back). The veal scaloppini was better, simple, could appreciate the natural flavors of the food and the prosciutto was a nice addition.  For the environment: The staff were very hospitable, attentive and friendly.  Overall, I enjoyed my dinner experience.  Would give 3.5 stars if I could.  Worth trying a second time. Updates to come....",,1,
21,Wren R.,"Reston, VA",56,6,3,2.0,5/21/2018,"Really sad to leave this 2 star review. We came in a couple of nights ago after a play and the minute we walked in the entire restaurant smelled like ammonia!! Like, extremely strong, there was no way the employees there didn't know it was there. The atmosphere of the place was very quaint and cute, quite dark but it fit what they were going for. When ordering, my mother had to ask what the specials were, and right after telling us what they were our waiter turned his back to us and proceeded to talk up the bartender. I had to get the bartenders attention to turn our waiter around, cause we had been ready to order for quite some time. Despite all of this our food was out very quick! I ordered the gnocchi and my mother order the sea bass. The gnocchi was absolutely fantastic! The best pasta and the best red sauce I have ever had in my life! Fabulous! However, I could smell my mother's sea bass from across the table. It was so horrible smelling I didn't want to taste it, my mother was nice enough to give half of the fish a chance, which she said was the worst bass she had ever had. I was really hoping to enjoy this cute little restaurant, especially since their pasta was so amazing, but it was our last night in NYC and we were looking for amazing service and food for being so close to broadway. Unfortunately this restaurant left the night on a sour note.",,,

23,Leticia C.,"Vancouver, WA",17,137,54,4.0,4/23/2017,"Such a cute little Italian restaurant. Had no issues getting a table on a Friday night. The food was delicious, Especially the pollo Marsala which was 3 large thin chicken breasts with mashed potatoes and broccoli. For dessert I ordered the lemon sorbet but I was given one scoop of lemon sorbet and a larger scoop of coconut sorbet on top. I thought it was odd and I unfortunately did not finish it because I hate coconut and was trying to just eat the lemon part. Next time I am in NY, I will have dinner here again for sure.",,,
24,Judith S.,"West Kill, NY",23,2,0,1.0,7/26/2018,The place smelled from mildew as you entered. Atmosphere lovely and intimate. Worst food I ever had. The veal picatta was grisley and no creativity in sauce or presentation. As if veal was microwaved and sauce from jar poured over. No one enjoyed their meal. It was my choice and i was quite embarrassed. I wouldnt even give it a star.,,1,
25,Danielle H.,"Hackensack, NJ",27,16,0,5.0,7/16/2018,Excellent. Highly recommend. Had a group of 36 in the Garden on a Monday evening after the theater. Food was DELICIOUS and the service was excellent.  Extremely reasonably priced as well. Beautiful space and a very impressive evening.,,,
26,Andrew O.,"New York, NY",7,64,56,1.0,5/13/2017,"EXTREMELY RACIST ESTABLISHMENT.

I will put your picture all over the owners restaurants fucking Chinese you need to go to Chinese restaurant."" Pictures are attached. Please, DO NOT go here and DO NOT support this restaurant.

31,Ocean P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,158,38,3.0,12/27/2017,"This Italian restaurant is a few blocks of walking distance from Times Square. We're were hungry and the car traffic was worse than stop and go. Luckily found a parking spot on 51st near this restaurant. The seafood pasta special for $34 had a nice red sauce. The Manila clams/mussels/calamari/shrimps were good, but the 1/2 lobster was very small and not fresh. The rigatoni with eggplant, mozzarella, basil was the best dish of the three. The special order, penne with vodka sauce was too salty and lacking favor. The parmigiana cheese condiment was not of high quality. This restaurant was the most crowded among several ones nearby on this block of 51st.",,,
32,Manny R.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,1,0,5.0,9/9/2018,Food was amazing. I had the salmon and it was crispy made perfectly. The calamari appetizer was to die for. My son had the spaghetti and meatballs and the sauce was like homemade it was a special sauce. I never ever tasted a spaghetti sauce like this. Meatballs were fresh and soft. Made perfectly and tasted amazing. The service was the best service I ever gotten before. All the waiters were attentive and every waiter help each other tables and serviced the customer. It was like having multiple waiters. The team work was great.,,,

I've probably been here 5 times in the last 2 months when I had my first visit. I came here because of a restaurant.com coupon I had which was nice because the prices are a little more than I would normally spend on dinner. Every time I've come I've ordered the butternut squash ravioli in Sage butter. Never tasted anything like this before! It has so much flavor. The olive oil for dipping your bread is also rich and full of flavor!",,,
34,Marilyn B.,"Washington, DC",0,4,0,4.0,11/25/2017,Charming little Italian gem. Lovely staff that was very good at accommodating my vegan daughter's needs. They created a dish for her instead of just remove by cheese from existing menu items. Her ring fell down the bathroom sink and they had it out before we left! She was thrilled!

The initial restaurant I had chosen ended up being much more expensive than they probably would have wanted to spend so I chose Maria Pia [a more reasonably priced venue which I had been to before.] We were seated immediately-It was pre-evening theater and the place was already crowded. We received menus, the waiter came to the table and we looked at the choices after the waiter read us the specials. It is a large square space with a small bar area as you walk in. The last time I was here I sat at the bar and that was very comfortable. One friend ordered the pasta primavera, and my other friend and I both ordered the veal saltimbocca. We were very happy with our choices. The veal saltimbocca came with a few roasted potatoes and  some spinach off to the side. We opted not to get dessert since out meals were filling enough. The waitstaff was very accommodating however it took some time to get butter for my friend's Italian bread [no EVOO] but they were very busy at the time we were there. The restroom was clean and well maintained. I would recommend and return.",,,

Updated review","Forget this place for pre-theater dinner! We booked a 6:15 table, seated on time, with a promise to get us out before our 8:00 show. Waiting, waiting, waiting for meals - reminding the waiter THREE more times of our time constrains - we finally realized he did not care! Our entrees finally arrived close to 7:30! We had to wolf down our meals in ten minutes flat to make our show. Wouldn't you know he had the balls to ask if we wanted to see a coffee and dessert menu at 7:45. Ugh! Nice place, food was respectable, service horrible - again, forget Maria Pia for pre-theater dining.",2,1,

From beginning to end, Maria Pia's assisted greatly with making this evening intimate, fun and relaxing. My sincerest thanks to Michael, the event coordinator. He advised me to change my time in order to have more uninterrupted time. He allowed for adjustments to the menu which was really helpful. The menu consisted of salad or soup, several choices of entrees and dessert with coffee or tea.  His staff was nice, attentive and expeditious as they brought out plates of food for each course. The restaurant is very nice, cozy and quiet. We were able to have the garden area to ourselves. The garden is covered and heated. Initially it was hot but it became more comfortable as the night wore on. The seating was a bit close.  There were about 35 people who attended but it worked. He had a great time and I couldn't ask for anything more. Thank you Maria Pia for making this evening wonderful.",,,

48,Donna G.,"Bellmore, NY",50,18,3,3.0,5/25/2017,"5 Star worthy.  Went on a week night for a pre theatre dinner. We ordered  Moscow Mules (made with fig Vodka) which was cold and awesome.  Next came Cesar Salad (no, they had no anchovies) and the the Cioppino (a seafood stew with a kick).  Again awesome.  We were seated right in front of the window and our waiter was the best (wish I remembered his name).2nd visit to Maria Pia, also on a week night before a show.  Completely different feel in service, which is why I wanted to give 3 - 4 stars.  We sat towards the back of the restaurant and felt a huge difference in service.  Asked for a glass of ice ... 5 times.  Again, the Moscow Mule was delish, but didn't seem to have much liquor in it.  Asked the waiter to grill my Salmon with just salt and pepper (dieting) and no,  the kitchen wouldn't accommodate.  The salmon was cooked perfectly - in a lemon butter wine sauce... (it was beyond Delish)... but was annoyed they wouldn't grill it dry.The dish was served with 'root' vegetables which were mostly celery with a bit of carrot slathered in a sauce as well... disappointing.  I guess because we were a table of 6, our bill showed a 20% gratuity added on.  At first glance, we didn't catch it...but then; there it was.  On our 1st visit, we gladly tipped beyond that 20%... On this visit, however, the service that evening didn't warrant 'that' gratuity.    After dinner, couldn't seem to find our waiter.  We waited 1/2 hour and then it got to close to theatre time.   We finally got another waiter to bring our check.To many restaurants out there that are diet friendly.  While we all really enjoy the food,  I won't go back while counting calories.",1,,

Very attentive staff that won't rush you if you want to have a leisurely dinner, and will get you out as fast as you like if you want to get to your Broadway show early. Appetizers are very good and fresh and easily can be shared between two people. One of their special apps, burrata with prosciutto, red peppers and tomatoes was amazing. Could've been a full meal on its ownMy wife is a vegetarian and ordered the goat cheese ravioli. She loved it! She usually doesn't finish a full meal but she said it was too delicious not to I ordered the seafood fettuccine special that came with a half lobster. I'm usually not a big lobster fan, and 9/10 times I've ordered lobster I've been disappointed. This lobster was the juiciest and tastiest lobster I've ever had. The restaurant is quaint yet not dark and outdated. It has a touch of casual modernity but not overbearing. It's always a pleasant and fun experience going there!",,,1

56,Kresha R.,"Blue Springs, MO",0,7,0,1.0,2/7/2017,"The best word to describe this restaurant is GENERIC!!  Their bread is mediocre, their Caesar is bland...I ordered their Chicken Parm and it was awful.  It had zero seasoning, was over sauced, and the pasta was over cooked.  I ate three bites and threw in the towel.  The waiter took my plates and never asked if I was satisfied.  My husband ordered a veal dish which was mediocre as well.  Over sauced, no taste...I have no idea how this restaurant has stayed open.  It is really basic.",4,,
57,Kelly T.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",372,1,0,3.0,9/23/2017,"Before I start, the service here was incredible. All the servers were attentive and quick, but it unfortunately did not make up for the mediocre food. First off, our bread came out cold. There was no butter, just a bottle of really cheap-tasting olive oil left on the table for us. We ordered two appetizers, the seared octopus with chickpeas and steamed mussels in a white wine sauce. The octopus was great, seared well, but the chickpeas were very bland. The mussels, however, were a redeeming factor. They were a bit on the smaller side, but the sauce was so good that we used it as a dip for the bread.The entrees were just as disappointing, though. Between three people, we split a goat cheese and spinach ravioli with vodka sauce and a fettuccine di mare special that wasn't on the menu. The ravioli was better than the $34 ""lobster special,"" which also bland even after cheese and pepper. This review would be a two star review if it weren't for the desserts. We ordered a tiramisu and got a panna cotta on the house because they were late with one of the appetizers. The panna cotta had an amazing texture, wasn't too sweet, and came with a tart berry sauce. The tiramisu I did not pay as much attention to, but there was a great ratio between cream and ladyfingers. The espresso was also very strong, I could smell it from the other side of the table.All in all, the entrees and appetizers were mediocre, but the desserts and service are really pulling through for us. I could imagine coming back again and ordering different entrees with the same desserts.",1,,

60,Feng X.,"Manhattan, NY",1,4,8,1.0,12/30/2016,"Maria Pia was a major disappointment to my family and friends. I don't understand--and I highly question--how jt got its current ratings. The food and ambience were just OK. But the service quality and the practice of unauthorized charges were unheard of in New York City. The service was awful: slow, non-responsive and perfunctory at most. The bread was brought to one of the tables our group of people were sitting around, with no butter or olive oil. When asked, the waiter just brought some butter, again just to one table. The dishes came with no serving utensil. When asked, the waiter just brought over one single spoon, for the three dish plates on the tables...Not only was the service bad and almost nonexistent, but the stealthy, undisclosed surcharges were worse. Despite the poor service, the waiter took the liberty to charge 20% tips AND 20% ""service charges"" --that amounted to 40% on top of the food ordered! He brought the check over without mentioning any of those illegitimate charges, presumably in a hope to get even more tips. The room was dark, poorly illuminated.  Many would surely have overlooked those unauthorized charges. Maria Pia is a restaurant that will likely leave its customers with bitter taste.",4,,

I use to live in the area and my wife use to come here all the time.   We went here before a show and the food was bland and tasteless.  The quality has tanked. This use to be a good restaurant.Pasta w/ Clams had absolutely no flavor, even with fresh clams. I added a ton of salt and it was still flavorless.  The pasta was the dried type you buy at the store.  My wife was excited about her mushroom pasta that she had many times before and said it use to be handmade pasta with a variety of delicious mushrooms.  But as soon as she ate it, she was so disappointed.  The pasta was no longer handmade and the mushrooms were mostly button....   her words were ""this is bad"".We also had calamari and an anti-pasta plate as apps, which were also unfortunate.  The calamari tasted like cardboard and anti-pasta plate was thrown together with least amount of care.  The best thing i ate was an olive.  I know they were busy but please save yourself the time and money....   I'm really surprised at all the good reviews,  so maybe our dinner was a fluke....Service was good and that's what the one star is for.",3,,

70,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1478,4331,5.0,10/11/2014,"For anyone who only ever passes by Maria Pia on their way to Ippudo, stop! I don't dole out 5-star ratings lightly, but here is a place that makes me recall meals from past trips to Italy. (It may help that I have an acquaintance in the old country by the same name.) The prices are fairly reasonable. First, definitely make a reservation on weekends at least; I can't speak for weekdays. The restaurant is cozy and timeless, with a brick entryway and exposed brick walls with wine bottles hanging on racks. The service is wonderful, with multiple waiters bringing food and refilling glasses regularly. I do love a place that is prepared for the amount of water I drink during a meal. But let's get down to why we're really here: the food. I dined with two others and we comfortably split the jumbo shrimp and Pera E Gorgonzola salad as appetizers. The shrimp arrived on a bed of white beans and was juicy and perfectly grilled. For the salad, the arugula was fresh and the Parmesan basket was interesting, though I thought it to be a little salty, especially since it already had bacon. I especially liked the pear. I chose the Ravioli Di Zucca (butternut squash ravioli) as my dinner and I'm so glad I did. Butternut squash is already my favorite winter squash and I'm always eager to eat it in any form - cubed and roasted, soup, mashed - but I digress. This ravioli was positively succulent and I loved the roasted asparagus tips and shaved ricotta cheese. The ravioli swam in a divine brown butter and sage sauce. I also sampled my friend's spinach and cheese ravioli, which was fabulous. Be sure to save room for dessert. I had the chocolate soufflé with hazelnut gelato, and I must say that it was the best soufflé I've had in recent memory. Baked to order, which takes about 15 minutes, the cake was lavaperfection and paired wonderfully with the gelato, which absolutely lives up to the hype. I also tried my friend's profiteroles with vanilla ice cream, but was not nearly as wowed. To be honest, I never would have chosen this place myself, because I typically only walk though the doors of somewhere with 4 or more Yelp stars. I was happy to trust my friends and be proven wrong!",2,,2

The restaurant was small, cozy, and very intimate. There are two separate dining areas. You have to pass the kitchen to get to the second dining area. The place was clean, for the most part. The wait staff was friendly but slow and lack communication with one another. Many times they seemed real loopy and not sure what was going on. Saw the staff standing in the center playing with their phones. Not very professional. Not much to rave about the food. The calamari was decent. The entree was not memorable.

Though we all decided to order off of the normal menu. I had Tortellini Dell Nonna, while everyone else had Chicken Parm, Chicken Marsala, and Rigatoni Alla Butera. The filling of mine and the sauce was great, but the pasta was a little tough for my liking.Service was pretty good. They refilled waters regularly and checked in every so often.

I had the seafood special that had lobster, muscles, clams, and calamari with fettuccini all for $32 and it was delicious! My mom had the lobster raviolis and my sister had veal saltimbocca, which were both also really good but not very much food. We finished off with tiramisu and the Italian cheesecake, also very good!

Updated review",Recently returned for a delicious Italian dinner with family and friends. I had the lamb shank (without sauce and spinach instead of lentils due to a low carb high fat diet prescribed by a neurologist.)

83,Katy S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,0,1.0,8/2/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! If I could give 0 stars I would. That's how horrible this restaurant is. And I'm not even speaking about the food quality because my friend and I never even got to that point.I live very close by to this place and my friend wanted to try it out because it looked cute. However, the service is HORRIBLE and the waiter is RUDE. I had eaten prior and was not hungry so only my friend ordered. The waiter immediately said sharing was not allowed, although it was not stated anywhere on the menu or in the restaurant (so he most likely just made it up because he wanted to get more tip). We didn't understand this idea because the restaurant was mostly empty, there was no line, and we were only taking up a small table meant for 2 people which if my friend had come alone she would have occupied anyways. After this, the waiter started giving us bad attitude and basically ignoring us. Another waiter brought out my friend's soup and it was decent (not bad, but definitely not worth the hassle). We waited for a really long period of time and her entrée was NEVER brought out. A guy who sat down after us even received his food before us. On top of this, the original waiter was no where to be found so we couldn't even ask him where the entrée was. When we finally found him to complain about the wait time, he said we should have notified him earlier. Well..... we didn't see you so we couldn't...At this point, we were done with his attitude and asked to just pay for the soup so we could leave. Since my friend had ordered the lunch special (soup, entrée, dessert) for $15-16, she asked specifically how much the soup cost. The waiter was extremely sketchy and immediately said $10. A soup costs $10 when the entire lunch meal costs $15?? Does that even make sense??? We asked for proof on the menu, which he came back and said it was not on the menu and oh actually its only $7. SO SKETCHY!!!! I think he knew he was going to get in trouble for lying and trying to rip us off so he agreed to let us go without paying.Do not eat here unless you want to be scammed!!!!!! Or if you want to be treated rudely!!!!!!",1,2,
84,Sara R.,"Patchogue, NY",0,1,0,3.0,12/9/2017,"Food is excellent and drinks were good. Unfortunately, they're more concerned with turnover than service.

We we're actually told by one of the staff that each party is only allowed 1-1/2 hours at a table, although from the time we walked in until the time we got the check was only 55 minutes, not even the allotted time...not a pleasant experience knowing your meter is ticking before you even sit down.",,,
85,Mary G.,"Belle Mead, NJ",2,28,51,4.0,8/13/2015,"Thoroughly enjoyed lunch here with my son, 16, prior to seeing Wicked down the block. There is a prix fixed menu at $16 each, but what we wanted wasn't part of that. We started with calamari and zucchini frita, which were lightly fried and tender. My son then had chicken Parmesan, which was pounded thin and was light and flavorful. I had the homemade fettuccine con funghi (mushrooms) with garlic oil and herbs, also, light and delicious! I had a crisp glass of Gavi, which was the perfect accompaniment. For dessert my son enjoyed a banana tart, which he loved. For myself, the chocolate soufflé with hazelnut gelato did the trick, of course with cappuccino. When on West 51st street, be sure to stop by for a nice Italian meal at Maria Pia's. You'll walk out singing ""That's Amore!""",,,

We had more than 30 guests, and Michael, the most caring and wonderful manager, worked with me to design a menu that featured a choice of salad or soup, chicken, pasta or salmon, and dessert. I cannot say enough good things about Maria Pia. Not only did my Italian best friend (who hates all Italian food except her own, LOL) rave about her pasta, vowing to return for more, but my son said his chicken  with capers was extraordinary and my salmon was, without a doubt, the best I've tasted in any restaurant, anywhere. But beyond the delicious fare, the incredibly attentive service was phenomenal, so much so that my guests commented on how great it was! Also, my son's show ran a bit longer than I'd anticipated but they were fantastic about holding our reservation, an incredible kindness, considering this little gem in the heart of the theater district gets PACKED for both lunch and dinner. All of you at Maria Pia made one of the most exciting nights of my son's life even more perfect, and I get teary eyed as I write this, because I can never truly thank you enough.",,,

The bartender gave me a friendly greeting and asked if I was dining alone, I replied, ""yes"" and pointed to a small table for two at the outdoor patio. She indicated it was fine and sat me with a menu. My initial thought was great this place is solo diner friendly.Unfortunately, the waiter had a bit of attitude, I don't know if it was that I was alone, and/or a female dining alone (you know the old single women are cheap), or just that the chap was having a bad day. He was professional, but had a cool disposition. Despite him, service was quick and the busboy was excellent, attentive and saved the day. The bread is better than most and you can ask for some parmesan cheese to go on top of the olive oil, my ravioli was satisfying, however, the souffle while good tasted as if it was a pre-made Cisco item. I'd definitely give Maria Pia another try, I'm not the type to let one server kill the whole experience for me, when everyone one else was friendly, good food/service and reasonable prices.",4,3,2

I also had a glass of moscato which was also very sweet and delicious. For my entree I had linguini alle Vongole, my favorite italian dish. I emphasize favorite because I'm very picky with my clam pasta. However, this place has one of the best ones I've tried. There's plenty of sauce with the pasta so its not too dried out, and the whole clams are amazingly flavored. My bf had the chicken parm and I have to say it's not the best. He devoured it because he was hungry but he agrees he's tried better ones elsewhere. But I'm writing this review solely from my experiences so still 5 stars!!! :) Service was also very good and waiters came to check up on us and made sure our water was filled.",,,

Our food was delicious to be honest although the bruschetta tasted burnt, but whatever, we were starving. The busboy/food runner was so sweet too. So while were eating, another server is literally staring us down and it made me so uncomfortable. I noticed there werent any latino people in there dining, so i don't know if it was because we were Mexican/ looked hispanic or we looked young but let us enjoy our meal. I got money, i know how to tip but it was very rude of him tbh. I asked the busboy for our check literally the second we got our entrees which was around 11:38. The server dropped our check and said that we didnt have to rush because they close at 12 okay but tell that to the server who kept staring us down. If you don't want any people after 11:30 then close earlier. Doesnt matter if its slow, but if you close at 12 then dont rush people or make them feel uncomfortable.",,,
103,Jonathan C.,"Manhattan, NY",174,6,0,2.0,11/20/2016,"Food was mediocre and tasteless. Ordered the dinner menu. Soup of the day was ok, the salmon tasted like it had sat in the freezer for the past quarter of a century. The pana cotta was just bland. Service was ok. Not coming back.",1,,
104,N T.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,3.0,9/8/2017,Very average. Got the fettuccine ai funghi - for $17 this was totally not worth it. The sauce was watery and disappointing. Even the olive oil served with the bread was disappointing. With so many other fantastic restaurants in the neighbourhood this one is not at all worth it.,,,
105,Estela D.,"Mineola, NY",1,10,4,4.0,3/10/2017,Have gone here a couple of time before shows. The service is really good and fast (it's like they know you have to catch a show).

107,Rachel F.,"New York, NY",334,160,41,4.0,11/28/2016,"3 stars for the food, but I added an extra because our servers were extremely attentive! I had been craving pasta all weekend long when I came to Maria Pia with my boyfriend on a Sunday night sans reservation. The place was pretty much empty and we were seated  right away. In typical Italian restaurant fashion we were given a bread basket with olive oil on the table while we looked over our menus. My favorite pasta dish to get is a linguine with red clam sauce. While they only had a white wine clam sauce, our waitress was very confident that they could change it for me- which they did. I asked for the red sauce spicy, and it wasn't exactly up to my spice standards, but they did give me a side of red pepper flakes to spice it up. My food was good! I wouldn't say it was the best red sauce U've ever had, but it was a big dish and I was definitely satisfied with the amount of clams. I'm happy to know about this place and am confident I would like their other dishes as well.",,,

The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauces were well flavored.  We both cleaned our plates.  Many other items on the menu looked good, we simply did not have time for a full meal with appetizers before the show.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to NYC and would visit it myself next time I'm there.",,,

We went in for lunch on a day when no one else was there, but the staff took a very long time to take our initial orders and we had to rush out. If you can take a leisurely lunch or dinner, the angel hair pasta was fantastic, but if you've got a firm timeline, look elsewhere.More unsettling was the damp thrift store smell of the restaurant. The place looks clean and nice but the smell concerned me.",,,

The Broccoli soup was delicious but way too salty. I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca, what a shame. I had high expectations but was let down. The Veal was very rubbery and tough (which is surprising since it was paper thin). They also ran out of soda?!?! The highlight of the meal was dessert. The tiramasu was perfect, but they didn't have coffee or cappuccino.... S.M.D.H.One more thing about service, if the restaurant overbooks for the night, you shouldn't rush your patrons out. The server was pushy, the food was RUSHED out, and they never checked back to see how the table was doing.",,,

The restaurant is very crowded and noisy, at least in the front room. The service was good, as was the food. Wine cost $11 a glass and I'm not sure how that would compare with other restaurants but buying a whole bottle may be a better choice. Would I go back again? Convenience aside, I think I would look for reviews within a 5 or 6 block radius and try one of those first, but I can not major complains about Maria Pia.",,,

126,Franklin H.,"Seattle, WA",60,263,645,3.0,10/14/2013,"After walking around NYC for a while - my officemates and I were disappointed to find our venue of choice had a 60 minute wait. Looking around the area - every other venue had a 60 minute wait. Except Maria Pia, so we decided to venture in. Personally, it's a lesson learned - if every other venue has a 60 minute wait, and this one lone venue in the collection of 60-minute wait times doesn't have a long wait time, it just means I should give up, and get a submarine-style sandwich from a franchise location to satiate my desire for sustenance. I'll keep this review brief - service was ok, there are times when I felt we were left to be forgotten in the depth of the outdoor courtyard, which doesn't make sense for a restaurant that was practically empty at 1900 on a Monday evening. Anyway, I had the Linguine with clams; way too much salt. I wonder if the kitchen staff just dumped the clam juice from the can into the broth. Given the quality of the food, service time, this is not a destination restaurant; however, it works if you're roaming around in the area.",5,4,3

Updated review","OMG what happened to this restaurant. I was meeting friends here and was excited as each time we went we had a great meal. This time it was like, WTF happened. It was like someone came in and erased everything's good about the place and left the name on the door.I'll start with the bread. Okay, it's complimentary but the times we've been there it's been served warm. Even when we asked to make sure it was, it arrived cold. I actually think he took it from another table. I decided to try the calamari and after my first bite realized it was a huge mistake. The calamari itself was bland and had no texture. In fact at one point I thought it was raw. I thought maybe if I dipped it in the red sauce it would be better, but no it made it worse. The red sauce tasted like something you would pour from a can. No flavor at all. Then there was the pasta. It was basically undercooked and seasonless. What used to be a nice fresh experience was like I was being punished. Not to spoil the evening I didn't say anything to the other people in my party but noticed they were leaving food on their plate as well.Afterwards, they also didn't want to say anything to spoil the evening but agreed the food was terrible. We were offered dessert but for I had enough bad food experience and knew if i wanted anything sweet I had some store bought cookies which based on my evening, was sure to have more taste and flavor. I think this restaurant has jumped the shark and is now tourist trap. It shows in the food they now serve. To bad as i doubt I will eat here again",,,
134,Chih C.,"Manhattan, NY",54,57,92,4.0,8/29/2015,Yummy tasty food with great service.  I had their Steamed Mussels and Seafood Pasta.  I will need to try their gnocchi next time.   I heard  great review about it.,,,
135,Michael H.,"Nanuet, NY",124,3,0,5.0,4/11/2015,"Had a 630 reservation on a Saturday night for two. Upon entering there was a line at hostess station but we were acknowledged rather quickly. We were told that they were a little backed up but I understood considering it was a Saturday night and the restaurant is frequented by 8 pm theater goers who want to eat before heading to their show. As I was standing there, a guy was looking to get bread To-Go but one of the employees advised that they don't sell the bread and you get it as part of your meal. The guy said he would order a bruschetta but the employee just got him the bread and let him have it for free without having to order anything. I thought this was a great gesture and you don't see restaurants do this often.We sat in the back room which I imagine is opened up when the weather gets warmer. It was a little crammed in there but I realize they are trying to accommodate all reservations and walk-ins in a timely matter so I looked past that. The meal was absolutely delicious. Got the calamari which was absolutely delicious. For the meal I got the Rigatoni alla Buttera which was also very good. The sausage wasn't what I expected (expected bigger pieces) but the sauce was great. I will definitely be back.",3,,1

145,Mama O.,"Huntingdon Valley, PA",13,202,524,4.0,2/28/2015,"We came here with a reservation for a large group (over 20). Upon arrival, our seating situation was disorganized. Our crew was escorted to a large table to the left then moved from the dining room to what seemed to be a screened in porch area aka ""back room"" then back again. I'll save the details because I don't know how much of the confusion was the staff not knowing where to sit us & how much was people in our group complaining about where they wanted to sit. For the record we HAD requested & reserved the back room so not sure how the confusion ensued. Kind of the M-O here , a bit of confusion, possibly miscommunication among some staff but that's ok! The meal was wonderful. Everyone was pleased. I found the prices very reasonable for NYC & it's in a perfectly convenient location if looking to chow down before or after a show. They do offer a theatre pre-fixe menu as well. Generous wine servings by the glass. Tasty Caesar salad & Italian crusty bread. I would go back or recommend to anyone. We were here on a Sunday evening & service was on point even though they seemed to be filled.Also~~For the record - the dining room as well as the back room felt like charming spaces to sit & enjoy!",1,,

My boyfriend and I arrived a bit late due to traffic and I'm always happy when a restaurant will seat the party even before everyone is there. My friend ordered a salumeria platter which was quite delicious. It was a nice selections of meats accompanied by cheese, olives, and a grilled polenta cake. The main courses were veal piccata, fettuccine ai funghi, a pasta dish with a red tomato and eggplant sauce and a shrimp dish. Everyone said their food was wonderful but I sadly didn't feel the same way. My pasta was extremely oily to the point that I had to stop eating because it was making me feel sick. The truffle and garlic flavors were trying to overpower each other so much that it ended up making the dish fairly unappetizing. I would definitely go back as I think I just picked the wrong dish/the chef had an off night with that entree. I still do recommend Maria Pia for the location, atmosphere, menu, and courteous staff.",2,,

Their lunch specials are well priced but the food isn't as flavorful as I'd expect.  I've tried different dishes each time I've been here but nothing really that stands out to my taste buds.  The first time I ordered off their regular lunch menu and got the gnocchi bolognese.  It was delicious but lacked something.. I felt it could have been a little more meatier.  The last time I came here I ordered off the pre-fixe lunch menu with the boss and some coworkers. I had the caesar salad (pretty average but i asked for extra dressing), the pollo milanese (delicious but had too much lemon sauce on top) and for dessert we all ordered the gelato (coffee flavored).  The price isn't bad.. just under $20.00 a person but they can definitely up their seasonings.",,,

I'd suggest you make reservations, it's pretty small.Service was pleasant, we were quickly given warm bread and drinks. I ordered the cioppino, which I have always thought of as fish stew. The fish was fresh and nicely cooked, but the three tablespoons of broth certainly did not equal a soup to me!The grilled bread they provided to sop up the barely there broth was too burnt for my taste.Overall the food was tasty, but portions are small and I was disappointed they misrepresented the cioppino.",1,,

Inside, the restaurant is spacious and well laid out. The prices are not out of sight, and the food, although not life-changing, is pretty good.  There are several homemade pasta dishes and I'd recommend the flat noodle with fresh mushroom and truffle oil.  Service is friendly and full of smiles.  The prices are not out of sight, and they have a price-fix menu available for about $30 per person or so. And the bonus is if you stop in after  8, the theater crowd is gone and you have one of the few quiet/cozy  restaurants in Manhattan to enjoy.",2,,1

155,Amy W.,"Agawam, MA",20,44,17,3.0,1/18/2017,"Went here on a recommendation from a friend who may not have been here for a while. . I could see where it might be considered a hidden gem to some if you hit it on a good night. We made a reservation for 4 the night before and was seated promptly, so that was a good start. Not room to wait and a small bar area. We were in a back corner but it was still very noisy. If we were seated in the middle of the restaurant, we probably wouldn't have been able to hear each other think! Tables were crammed next to each other so not a lot of room to move around or get comfortable. Meals were medium prices for NYC, but when a special was ordered (pan seared fish with vegetables), it was charged as open food for $32.00. This was about $8-15 more than the menu meals. It was not worth $32.00 as it didn't come with salad, just some vegetables. Our bread came late (they apologized) and was stone cold. At least warm bread would have been nice. The chicken Milanese was bland, the chicken parm had one small piece of mozzarella that only 1/2 covered the chicken. The fish was tasty but expensive and the linguine with clams was delicious. The pear salad with arugula was amazing really (expensive but able to split) as it came in a crusted Parmesan bowl. Service was average, and timing was good between salad and meals.

157,Stephanie L.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",272,10,1,5.0,7/21/2015,The gnocchi & chicken marsala were excellent. The cheesecake was divine and so was the wine!  The atmosphere was perfect. We'll definitely be back!,,,
158,Riley B.,"Los Angeles, CA",297,16,4,5.0,11/29/2014,Awesome place. So friendly and the manager seems right away like a good friend who owns the bar and treats you like a King. It feels like your family when you go here. Oh and the food and wine are awesome!,1,,
159,K B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,32,2,4.0,4/13/2016,The food is pretty good and a decent wine selection for a decent price. Service attentive and friendly.,,,
160,Seika K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,12,24,4.0,4/12/2015,"Came here for dinner on Sunday and it was a little noisy at first but after the group left it was perfect. We ordered the Caprese, crab cake and seafood stew. All the seafood portions were small but that is understandable considering the prices. Everything was delicious! The mozzarella was so fluffy and the crab cake had a crunchy texture and was amazing as well. The waiters was nice and attentive and the service was quick but they did not rush you. Overall it was a great experience and the restaurant decor is clean but you get a comfy italian feel as well.",,,
161,Darren G.,"New York, NY",31,17,0,5.0,5/2/2016,I have been to Maria Pia about 6 times and it never disappoints.  The service is attentive without being pushy.  I took my aunt and uncle here on a Friday for a 6:30 reservation.  When the owner noticed we are sort of cramped in a corner he immediately came out and moved us to a much better table.  The food is wonderful.  I always get the butera which is out of this world and a very good sized Cesar salad.  Dessert was the tartufo and the profiteroles.I had a very nice rose' with dinner and we were treated to a lemoncello following our meal.  I am big fan and will definitely be back.,,,
162,Kevin C.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,32,20,3.0,3/16/2016,"Great lunch special and food is typically solid. On my visit the restaurant had a strange order coming from kitchen and bathroom area, for that reason I gave a lower rating.",,,
163,John G.,"Virginia Beach, VA",192,627,270,4.0,12/28/2012,"Maria Pia provided us with a wonderful dining experience.  The calamari was crisp and well seasoned, and the Caesar salad was very enjoyable. I have the meat-filled tortellini with prosciutto and it was fantastic.  The light cream sauce it came in made the whole dish better. Other people in my party were equally pleased with their meals.  For dessert we had a trio of sorbets, lemon, passion fruit and mango.  We accidentally received two mango and no passion fruit and it was corrected in moments when we brought it to the attention of our wonderful server. The only down side was the conversation the ""real housewife"" types were having at the table next to us. Unbelievable, especially with a preteen at their table, but I guess they are raising her in their own likeness. Poor kid.",,1,
164,Natalie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,137,49,3.0,1/11/2015,"I'd say this place is fine when choosing a pre-theater dinner restaurant, but there may be some others nearby that are better. I came on a Monday at 6:30pm before an 8pm show with my boyfriend. Honestly, the host was pretty cold to him when he first got there before I did, and they continued to not have great service throughout the meal. Everyone else got their coats taken right away, but no one offered to take ours. The service was pretty slow. When we told them that we had to be quick to make a Broadway show at 8, they sped up a bit (which we totally appreciated) but ended up being a little rude to us about that throughout the meal.Otherwise, the food was good but not great. We each ordered from the 3-course prix fixe theater menu. I personally had the salad, mushroom linguine, and hazelnut gelato. Each one could've had more flavor...just kind of plain - decent food but nothing special.",,,
165,Sherry Y.,"San Antonio, TX",545,455,187,4.0,6/18/2014,"Delightful but a bit on the pricey side. I do love their bottomless bread basket. Imagine - quality olive oil, parmesan cheese and an endless supply of bread including foccacia. Yum. I believe I had a butternut squash ravioli in pesto that was lovely. Creamy, but could have done with a bit of citrus or bite. Still,excellent service and staff.",1,1,1

170,Norman G.,"New York, NY",2,89,0,4.0,11/28/2016,"A pleasant surprise in the Theatre District! Welcoming staff, no attitude and accommodating. Didn't care for the fennel soup, it was a little bland, and the pana cotta was just average, but the salmon was fine. If I order something wrong, shame on me...not the restaurant's fault. Maybe I should have asked a few questions. Great Manhattans, and I'm going back soon.",,,
171,Laura T.,"Mount Vernon, NY",5,2,0,1.0,12/28/2013,"I purchased a gift certificate for my son and his girlfriend to have dinner at Maria Pia prior to seeing the Broadway show, Wicked, this evening.The manager was EXTREMELY rude to the couple.  He refused to honor the gift certificate claiming that they no longer had a relationship with Open Table.  When shown his own website through which the gift certificate option is readily available, he said after several prompts that that was not his website.  I was able to make their reservation through Open Table, so clearly they have some form of a relationship with Open Table.My son had to pay out of pocket for their dinner!  What had been a lovely day in NYC for this young couple, and a decent dinner, was ruined by the manager.  I cannot possibly recommend any restaurant in this group of restaurants if they hire such incompetent and rude employees.",4,,
172,Toni S.,"Glenwood Springs, CO",40,14,0,5.0,2/21/2016,Good wine selection. Very nice prix fixe lunch for $15.95. Loved the rigatoni and the piccata. The rigatoni was especially flavorful. I am all about food with flavored that pop and this can sometimes be hard for restaurants to achieve. Maria Pia met that challenge in an admirable manner.,,,
173,Susan C.,"Belle Mead, NJ",1,10,0,2.0,3/26/2017,"Stumbled upon this restaurant after our first choice just a few feet away (Ippudo) had too long a wait as we had theater tickets. Should have not rushed in so fast, or at least checked out reviews first.  The bread basket was fair. Chicken masala was over cooked extremely thin piece of pounded chicken drenched in flavorless sauce and surrounded by flavorless (canned?) mushrooms.  Served with truffle mashed potatoes, but NO truffle flavor, and flavorless broccoli.  Mushroom risotto had at least a hint of mushroom flavor but needed some additional love and flavor to make me recommend to anyone.  The best of the three was the pasta puttanesca, and maybe only because puttanesca by nature has inherent flavor because of the ingredients.  I was allowed to substitute angel hair for the penne.  Ordered a side of broccoli rabe which was also flavorless.  I am an excellent home cook and know how easy it is to bring out flavor in food but no attempt was made to elevate these 4 items to their true potential.  Service however was quick and wait staff was professional but unfortunately I'll never be seeing them again.",1,,

Take home dessert of course because my belly is too tight with Italian delights.Great place for celebrations! Knowledgeable and attentive waitstaff. I suggest a reservation on the weekends. In this economy you don't want to chance good money on bad food. With Maria Pia your money is well spent!!!",2,,

The server was friendly, and even though they were PACKED the food arrived really quickly. Everything that we had was delicious, and for a midtown restaurant was very reasonably priced. (bonus for vegetarians, there were several meatless options to choose from instead of just one obligatory boring pasta dish) The tiramisu was also one of the best I've had! From the time we walked in, we were only there for about 50 minutes tops, left in plenty of time to make our show. I would gladly come back the next time I stay in the area!",,,
178,Erin O.,"Staten Island, NY",66,7,0,5.0,5/3/2014,"I have to say that I have been to this place several times and it was always good, but recently I took friends from out of town here after a show and it was spectacular. Come to find out that they have a new owner, Miri has improved the food, is outgoing, friendly and made sure we enjoyed everything and encouraged our out of town guests to come back. He talked with my husband and I for some time, even remembered all the details of our reservation. We even moved our table early in the evening with no problem.This restaurant has a cozy wine cellar feel on the inside and a garden for hotter weather on the outside. We had wine, salads, antipasto and entrees. Pasta was fresh and fish stew was superb. Also the prices cannot be beat for Manhattan and they are super accommodating, I feel like a lot of the other restaurants in this area stick their nose up when I call for a reservation or can't seat me especially during the holidays. Maria Pia always makes room for us and never gets annoyed if we have to change things last minute.Overall I feel it is the hidden Italian gem of Midtown, not to be missed!",1,,
179,David N.,"Hobe Sound, FL",44,144,193,4.0,12/15/2013,"We had a really lovely time here.  Don't try walking in without a reservation on a popular night --this place is popular.  The ambiance is just on the comfortable side of tight, but  it works and on those cold nights outside, it feels just right.  I read a lot of the reviews about feeling rushed, but did not find that.  The staff is efficient at taking things away, filling water,  pouring wine and asking if anyone would like anything, but we were never asked to move along and stayed well after desert with people waiting at the bar (those without a reservation).As for food.  Overall, we loved everything.  The portions were rightsized and delicious.  We all started with a Caesar salad that was very good to get the juices going. For dinner, I had the Garanelli Al Sugo Di Vietello - veal ragout with sage,  that was rich and delicious.  My wife had the Paccheri Alla Butera - Italian sausage, peas, light cream tomato sauce.  After a taste,  next time I will most likely get this one... yum.  A friend had the Chicken parm and although sounding like a staple and un-daring, it was spectacular and quite generous.Top that off with a late night cappuccino and do not walk out of here without the Tiramisu - yes, another so what sounding finish, but trust me.....I would recommend the Prix Fixe for overall value, because getting the same things a la carte will cost you more, for less.  I would also recommend getting a bottle of wine and not order by the glass.Definitely going back here again.",1,,1
180,Mark B.,"Lee's Summit, MO",52,9,0,5.0,10/16/2015,"Great food, attentive staff. Excellent value. All the great standard dishes you would expect. Well done on the seafood and veal! I would come back again as a regular place to water and eat.",,,
181,Alice H.,"Manhattan, NY",5,12,0,1.0,11/3/2014,"My boyfriend and I went to Maria Pia tonight and had an awful experience.  Let me preface by saying that we live across the street so we have always wanted to try maria Pia because it looks lovely.  Our experience was disappointing.  We talked to our waiter once and that was to give him our order.  After that we were never approached again except for the check. They were about half way full but clearly not slammed. The food was disappointing, very dry, and made me sad. Especially after we received the check, not worth the price. I have been to one of their other affiliated restaurant and had an awesome experience so hopefully it was just an off night.",,,
182,Ina L.,"New York, NY",3948,537,5493,3.0,10/16/2011,"It's a cute and homey Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. It's a quaint restaurant good for smaller parties and intimate dates. My friend and I took advantage of the recent parade of beautiful fall weather and walked over to Maria Pia and found ourselves pleasantly surprised with the price, ambiance, and the quality of the food. We ordered a cheese and cured meat platter as an appetizer, Antipasto Speciale, alongside a bottle of red wine. We then continued our experience with their Seafood Risotto and Chicken Rigatoni in pink vodka sauce. There wasn't anything too unique and spectacular with their Rigatoni but their Risotto was excellent, and this is coming from someone who isn't too particular and fond of Risotto.",1,,
183,Sarah C.,"Lafayette, CA",185,140,1,3.0,10/1/2013,"Cute signage always attracts little old me (and by old, I mean young). Fiance and I came here because we were pushed away by the hour + wait time for both Totto and Ippudo. So, we went the other carbs route...PASTA.Interestingly enough, while the Japanese ramen places were packed to the nines (I have no idea what that means btw...sounds like a phrase), Maria Pia was maybe 10% full. Fiance was concerned he didn't look fancy enough since he was wearing sneakers, but they welcomed us in with open arms.I ordered the Papparedelle Ai Funghi - which was flavorful and just the right amount that you weren't SUPER full, but satisfied. And if you like mushrooms, it's a good pick. We also ordered the panna cotta for dessert which was DELICIOUS. It had a berry sauce and the panna cotta had vanilla bean specks in it. yummmm. Overall, the main drawback I saw was the price since each pasta dish was about $15. The pasta was good, but it was not out of this world-good. However, if you're ever around the area hoping to find a place that's not too crowded and have decent Italian food - this is a good place to consider!",1,,
184,Bethany R.,"Middletown, MD",0,15,1,4.0,12/15/2015,Ate here on a Friday night before a show a few weeks ago with a group of friends.

186,Tam A.,"Brooklyn, NY",126,6,1,4.0,10/7/2016,"When reviewing a restaurant I would say the most important things to take note of are the food, the ambience and the service. The waiters were very friendly and very nice. They deserve 5-stars on their own. The food was really enjoyable. I had the seafood Lobster fettuccine dish. Lastly the Ambiance is very nice, quaint and dim lighting, almost a good place to bring a date. Hopefully you don't have loud guests like I did to disturb your dinner and  conversation, but other than that it's a great place overall.",,,
187,Joe S.,"Huntington, NY",0,5,2,4.0,11/23/2014,"The place is a lot better inside than outside. The outside has cheesy yellow signage but the inside has a simple, elegant, Italian decor. Brick and wine on the walls with white cloth tables. The host was happy and polite. The waitress was happy and prompt, yet struggled with the specials for the day.I had a Caesar salad to start. Very good, full plate. No complaints. Chicken parm for the main dish. Small cup of pasta under a large piece of chicken. The breaking was perfect, chicken juicy. Pasta sauce had a bit of spice to it and a good consistency. Tiramisu for dessert was delicious. A large piece that was moist, light and fluffy. My only complaint was a little heavy with the cocoa powder on top.Would recommend everything I got and the restaurant to a friend",,,
188,David G.,"New York, NY",7,16,0,5.0,10/3/2016,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Great for a fancy night or a more casual time, this restaurant has incredible food, reasonable prices, and terrific service. Their squash ravioli is one of my favorite dishes in the whole city.",,,
189,Lori N.,"Oakland, CA",342,8,3,1.0,4/18/2013,"Chose Maria Pia just walking around and looking at different places.  Friendly greeting, it was Monday, so very quiet.We were seated in front right across from the bar.  This would have been fine but they had the tv on with AFV and the entire staff including the owner or manager stood in front of the tv and laughed at the whole show.  We weren't in the mood for tv nor for feeling like we were a distraction.The food was very marginal for what can be found in NYC.  The cream sauce on the tortellini was good but the pasta was very thick with just a sliver of meat.  Not meat filled at all.  My sister has lobster ravioli - we were sure there was lobster in there somewhere, after all, it said so on the menu.  No flavor.Come time to pay - I actually sat there holding the credit card in my hand and up in full view, this way I knew I would be able to get our servers attention.I gave it a one star because of the combination of service and food.  If the place is full the tv would not have mattered, but because it was empty it was odd having the entire staff focused on tv.  There is fantastic Italian food in this city, this place is not one of them!",2,1,

We were put in the back, which had very bad lighting and it was kind of shabby. As for the food, it was pretty good. Nothing out of this world, but nobody complained. If we were seated right away and in the main room, I probably would have given this place 4 stars.",,,

196,Drew W.,"Monmouth Beach, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,9/28/2016,"Went there on Saturday the 24th after a show, reservations made on open table.  Apps and Dinner were great and a bottle of wine.  Very reasonable prices.  Waiters and staff were great.  My wife needed a spoon for her pasta. It was brought to her on a napkin, not just handed to her.  The best part of night and to show their attention to detail was at the end of our dinner.  One of the waiters comes to the table with cake and candle and singing happy birthday.  I wanted to kill my wife.  My birthday was the next day and she swore she told no one.  But then she recalled, when making the reservation on open table she asked for a nice table since dinner was part of my birthday celebration.  That was the icing on the cake.  PS the Tiramisu awesome.  Highly recommended, can't wait to go back.",,,

The restaurant was very neat, great ambiance.  The service was excellent, it seemed that we had three or more servers waiting on us and our wine glasses were never empty. We even had a wine spill accident and it was cleaned, cleared and food replaced immediately. The food was served quickly and with a great presentation. Everyone was really pleased with their choice. I had the veal ragout, which was incredibly tasty and flavorful. The menu has plenty of excellent choices.  However, some felt the food was a little salty (corn with the crab cake appetizer and the portobello salad). Tip o the hat - service was absolutely great!Wag o the finger - Kathy for spilling her wine. I recommend this to any show going crowd.",,,

I came here with a restaurant.com certificate but will come back regardless. The service was a bit rushed and portions were small to average but it is made up for in quality. There is outdoor seating as well. I had the chicken masala and my girlfriend had the veal scallopini picata. Client had plenty of mushrooms and hers had a nice lemon sauce.,,,
