First time with girlfriends was a mixed bag, second time it was perfection. Lovely interior and French tunes take you far away, and of course the food...Ate:CrevetteBranzinoLemon tarteCabernet francOddly I had the crevette and Branzino twice. the raw crevette with horseradish and avocado mouse is simplicity defined. The Branzino on the second visit was perfected with eggplant mousse and perfectly seared eggplant and perfectly seared Branzino and the poured veggie pesto. The lemon tart was also super delish. If its not restaurant week, have some deep pockets and be transported to France.",4,1,2
1,Jonathan R.,"Rochester Hills, MI",0,10,0,3.0,8/21/2018,"Went for restaurant week so we were able to get a decent deal in terms of price, but it still felt overpriced for the mediocre quality. Fries were good.  Steak had some grizzle. Drinks were on par with most of the other overpriced places in NYC (ie mediocre). Ambiance was superb.",,,
2,Nean S.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,19,3,5.0,7/13/2018,"Came here for French Restaurant Week. We sat outside on a lovely summer evening and all felt perfect! Most noticeable was the delicate touch of each and every dish, from the chicken liver pate, escargot, to the entrées of branzino and prawn risotto, they all had a refreshing taste. I find French bistro food usually very rich. This place does it differently in a good way.Wait staff is patient and friendly.Had a great time!",,,
3,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1635,64753,5.0,4/6/2018,"John McDonald's Italian spot Sessanta has now changed to Bistrot Leo, serving a great menu of classic French fare.The decor doesn't seem to have changed much, which is a good thing because it's a beautiful restaurant.Definitely start with the Potato Mille Feuille ($13), three pieces of really delicious crispy, buttery layered potatoes. The pommes frites are also perfect, which makes the Steak Frites ($38) an excellent option for an entree. The Atlantic Wild Cod ($32) was another great choice for something lighter.For dessert, get the Banana Pan Perdu ($12). I'd definitely come back to try the giant rib for two since my wife didn't want it tonight.",6,3,6
4,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,4.0,7/1/2018,"Overall very enjoyable meal and great service.  Many seemingly classic or traditional-sounding items on the menu, yet everything is prepared in a very delicate way.We started with the pork rillons and potato mille feuille, which were both terrific.  The pork rillons are first cooked sous vide and then flash fried, so you get a crispy bite before getting into very tender cubes of pork belly.  The potato mille feuille was equally impressive, if not more so, with paper-thin layers of potato.  It was fun to try the three different sauces that came with it, but I would've been happy just playing with the potato layers alone -- do I eat a big cross section bite, should I try to peel back and count the layers and eat them individually, or do I go somewhere in the middle?The highlight of the entrees was definitely the grilled long rib, which was fall-off-the-bone-no-knife-required tender.  It was packed with flavor and delicious, but certainly on the heavier considering both the richness of the cut of meat and the preparation/sauce.We also tried the Atlantic wild cod, which was the weakest link for me.  I was expecting a whole filet of fish, but it was actually chopped up pieces of the cod on top of a bed of the white bean puree.  It wasn't bad, but perhaps just too different from what I was expecting (and hard to shine next to the long rib).Would love to come back another time to try more items!",2,,
5,Matt C.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,254,318,5.0,4/20/2018,"Visited opening week last Thursday.  So glad we did.  Perfect menu.   Nice renovation and the banquette seating at the booth  tables are so comfortable.  It ws early so my friend and I employed our normal strategy of ordering all the great apps with cocktails. Started with the foie gras, steak tartare a dozen oysters and something I am forgetting.  All of these dishes were perfectly done and tasty..After some more cocktails we ordered a steak fried and the lobster nicoise to share, which were more great choices. Our waitress and the rest of the service crew were all on the top of their game, also very friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable.   The decor is different than Sessantta had been ,but it was tastefully updated for this new Sogo bistro.   I'm certain thst this spot will be popular soon.",7,3,4
6,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",125,291,1096,3.0,5/8/2018,"Look, I am not trying to be the wet blanket here. I like the location and the outdoor-y seating. But when it comes to the food, it is just plain, mediocre, for lack of better words. Usually, my philosophy is, if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing. But when I saw the high rating for this place, the responsible self of me felt I have to say something..Let's start with the positive. Service, location, the weather and the perfect encounter (of course, not part of the restaurant but a function of the location). Wine list is not the best, but decent selection and approachable. The need-some-work part: food.   I had the lobster nicoise salad decorated with green beans oeuf farcis aka mayonnaise egg and fingerling potatoes. It was refreshing , tho nothing special to write about :/ The lobster was marinated thoroughly - too sour; and it was about 6 oz lobster while you can get a lb for the same money at Citerella. Sure, I admitted i came here just for the outdoor table and people watching in SoH. And that is what I will likely be doing in foreseeable future. Skip the food",2,,2
7,Shannon D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",591,69,12,4.0,8/14/2018,"Came in on a weekday afternoon and he place was pretty much empty. That being said the avocado toast I had was great and the service was solid. The ambiance and design of the restaurant is really something to see, the interior is gorgeous. I'd love to come back and see what the deal is at dinner time.",,,
8,D Z.,"New York, NY",3,402,10,2.0,10/25/2018,"So not worth the price. yeah, the outdoor seating is nice. The food is good. But for that price, hells not",,,
9,Neal W.,"New York, NY",58,129,0,4.0,4/28/2018,"I enjoyed it for the most part. I found the reception at the door a little snooty, but this affectation is unfortunately common with lots of expensive restaurants in NYC, and you can't take it personally. I prefer the kind of warmth and engagement I found at the bar with Eduardo, their bartender, who was happy to talk about the in-house made ingredients for one of their signature cocktails. The menu is interesting with some familiar bistro favorites and some interesting surprises. Personally I enjoyed the cod and my wife's salmon. Desserts were wonderful. Table service was cordial and efficient. Prices were about what you'd expect, about $100 per person with gratuity for three courses and mid-priced wine by the glass. I would probably return.",1,,
10,H K.,"Jersey City, NJ",201,30,0,4.0,8/17/2018,Love the ambience. Felt like I was dropped into a cute French film. The roast chicken with mushrooms was delicious. The waitress seemed a bit slow but maybe they were just understaffed that day. Good overall!,,,
11,S.E B.,"Falls Church, VA",2,27,57,5.0,5/10/2018,"Excellent salad, delicious really enjoyed it.  Satisfying and tasty, I'll definitely be back.",,,
12,Emily L.,"New York, NY",393,28,92,5.0,6/30/2018,"I came with my aunt, uncle and some cousins for dinner. We were seated toward the back under the sky light. It was so cute! We ordered a couple of different sides and I remember the spaetzel being very good. We had the steak tartare as an appetizer which was very very good as well. I had the rocket salad and the Black Sea bass. Everything was tasty and service was quick! I'll be back for brunch.",,,
13,Dan J.,"Montvale, NJ",191,4,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"Salad was good, but ordered the streak frites and almost every bite had gristle. I was expecting a l lot more from a $40 steak. Service is also very slow.",,,
14,Nilay A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",16,2,0,5.0,7/19/2018,"I loved the place so much that even though im vegan, i will definetely go there again. First off all, staff were soooo nice and welcoming. As a vegan i did not have a much choice because its not a vegan restaurant but they really tried hard to make me happy. I ate salad and fries which were awesome. I loved how crispy the fries were. Also ambience and music were also awesome, it makes you chill there. Overall i really loved the restaurant and definitely go there again!!!",,,
15,P C.,"New York, NY",6,141,11,4.0,4/21/2018,"Good place. We tried it in its first week and my only complaints would be front of house and some service hiccups which i'm sure will get worked out quickly. They have lovely seating outside if you can get it but inside is also very nice, especially the back rooms. We sampled half the menu and everything was good. I recommend giving it a try and welcome it to the neighborhood.",,,
