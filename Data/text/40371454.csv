0,Julio G.,"Newark, NJ",223,362,1211,5.0,9/2/2018,"Great little place to eat before a show! Went here for Sunday brunch before seeing a matinee! Had a blast. My friend recommended the cafe, apparently it's been around for more than 20 years. For being 1pm on a Sunday it was quiet, which worked to our advantage. The food was delicious; they did a great job! I had the special of the day for brunch, it was melted cheese on a ham and cheese sandwich also came with a side salad  - so good! Mimosas and alcohol available as well, we didn't indulge but others around us did and it looked refreshing. Would definitely come back to this location. The entire place was simple but that's all you needed. Bathrooms are cute - and kinda funky. Good for large groups or family dinners . Outdoor seating also available. Staff was friendly and attentive. Short waiting time for food and service. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Enjoy your visit / meal! I know I did!",3,,2
1,Selena S.,"Boston, MA",0,123,0,2.0,8/17/2018,"I came here for dinner after scouring yelp for a restaurant for dinner. I was in the mood for a good burger and fries, and this place was ultimately chosen because of how close it was to my hotel. First impressions - this definitely wasn't a cafe! It was a full scale restaurant, and that caught me off guard a bit. No biggie as my water was friendly, although it seemed that he was really busy so he wasn't as attentive as he ideally could've been. The only reason really I'm giving this a 2 star rating is because the burger was such a let down. It was just dry and the taste of salt overwhelmed the taste of the burger. I ultimately finished half, ate most of my fries, and called it a night.",1,,
2,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",121,353,373,4.0,10/21/2017,Saw a show here - the Power of Potus. This is a great show and I highly recommend it. We were in stitches laughing all night. It's a one woman show (very talented one at that) plus the band. I loved that the show didn't focus too much on the divide in politics- it was quite friendly and entertaining for any viewers. The rest of the review is for the restaurant.The food I ordered during the show was surprisingly good. The crab cakes were fresh and delicious and the Caesar salad did not disappoint. I also tasted my friends salads (beet & goat cheese and grilled chicken) and both were quite tasty. The wine selection was also great. The service was also on point. I'd come back here just for dinner- great find!,1,,

Updated review","Once again, the same friend was in town and wanted to meet for lunch and wanted to return to the West Bank Cafe. We were seated near the window and were told about the specials. In the interim,  she ordered a glass of Malbec and I ordered a glass of Merlot. We looked at the menu and she ordered the lamb chops and I got the WBC burger which came with fries but I substituted for a small salad. The food was delicious. We were able to sit and talk and there was no rush for the table. We finished our meal each with a cup of coffee. It is pricey but the food is very good. I would recommend.",1,,
4,Maggie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,2,0,2.0,10/6/2018,I love the comfortable tables and chairs.   The food is so so and the drinks are expensive.  But it's a great place for a meeting because the lighting is great at the atmosphere is subdued.   The bar is comfortable and sometimes it's a who's who of Actors and directors.,,,
5,Leanna W.,"Pasadena, CA",76,378,97,5.0,12/31/2017,"We came here last minute after a Broadway show as we saw an ad for a free glass of house wine with our playbills. Being the budgeting tourists we were, West Bank Cafe skyrocketed to the top of our dinner list. Thankfully, the glass of wine is not limited per party, but is an offer applicable to every member that has their playbill with them. Saves you a solid $10 each, so that's wonderful. We were even seated immediately on arrival after our play without a reservation; albeit it was a weekday. Now, as a disclaimer - I was super sick and congested, so I couldn't fully taste and appreciate our dishes. That being said, my butternut squash risotto was amazing and so satisfying to my poor sick face and head. The texture was perfect, and the creamy sauce was rich and decadent without being overbearing. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms, but the risotto had the most perfectly cooked mushrooms, somewhat on the firmer side - so easy to gobble right up. My sister ordered the same dish and was also very satisfied and happy, while my adventurous (ahem) friend ordered a nearly-plain burger - despite this she said that it was still excellent and of top-notch quality. Service was excellent and our food came our incredibly fast despite it being a fairly busy evening, ambiance was classy without being stuffy, and the prices were fair given the quality of the food and being in NYC. Bathrooms were clean and comfortable (a rarity in NYC). Would definitely recommend West Bank Cafe to anyone traveling to New York, especially those looking to have an element of more classy and refined dining without doing excessive damage to their wallet.",1,,2
6,Nancy F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,10/28/2018,"My friend and I had dinner their on Oct 25, 2018 after the theatre, I ordered an entree that came with French Fries. I asked a busboy to wrap up the French Fries so I could take them home. He returned to our table and gave me a brown paper bag. When I arrived home, I put them into the fridge, but thought I would look inside the bag first. I was aghast. The potatoes were just thrown into the bag by themselves....no container, and already showing grease spots on the outside of the bag. My first thought was that this guy simply took them from the plate with his hand and threw them into the bag. That was sickening....I threw them out and the next day called the manager who was shocked at what had been done. I have taken home doggie bags from restaurants for about 40 years and never, ever had this experience. So my second thought concerning the West Bank Cafe, was that I will never dine there again.NF",,,
7,Denise B.,"Yonkers, NY",41,9,1,4.0,9/4/2018,My second time eating here for lunch. Had a salad both times. Garden salad seasoned to perfection with nicely grilled chicken breast added. Perfect lunch for me. I will definitely return. The service was excellent both times as well.,,,

9,Steven H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/25/2018,It has a very nice atmosphere and the staff is very welcoming and kind. It's not too expensive and has some incredibly good food with very fast service. Very clean and definitely a place to try if you want to try some new types of foods or a pre-broadway show meal.

11,Ksenia K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,45,23,2.0,6/24/2018,"The waiters are utterly clueless, our waitress had not clue what was the side dish for our dish (what a difficult question-you only work there) and she had to discuss that with a co- worker who seemed to be clueless and glib as well! Gee how difficulty that is!!! We still received a different side dish... Everyone from a host and servers didn't really care about patrons. Just sad!",,,
12,Amy D.,"New Orleans, LA",0,5,5,5.0,11/19/2017,I cannot say enough nice and positive things about the staff here! We arrived in NYC and were stranded in the streets when our air bnb that we booked fell through. We needed a place to duck in with our luggage while we booked a new spot. The hostess was so sweet and cleared out a closet in the front for us to store our luggage. We sat at the bar and Kelly took the absolute best care of us. We ordered mushroom risotto balls which came with a delicious and flavorful truffle aioli. It was just the right amount of truffle and not over powering. We also ordered the calamari which came with a spicy sauce that was similar to a remoulade. The calamari was crunchy and cooked perfectly and was not chewy at all. Everyone in this establishment was so friendly and welcoming. They made a great impression for our first stop in NYC!,1,,
13,Patrick C.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,4,0,1.0,7/13/2018,It is the middle of the summer and you haven't had air conditioning in a week? This used to be one of my fav spots but not in this heat!,1,,
14,Kristina P.,"BEECHHURST, NY",147,131,64,5.0,1/25/2018,"Cute cozy spot. Went there for brunch and had their eggs Benedict and the lemon ricotta pancakes. The lemon ricotta pancakes are a must have!! So fluffy and delicious. The service was great too, our waiter was on top of refilling our water and my husband's mimosas (unlimited mimosas for $20? 25? or something). He had 3 drinks in less than 30 min and there was no fuss about refilling them like some brunch places. Will def be back!",1,,1
15,Laetitia B.,"New York, NY",11,12,45,4.0,4/24/2018,"This neighborhood is not known for its food offerings. Restaurants are typically overpriced, gimmicky, and lack any type of personality. The West Bank Cafe stands out as a locally owned restaurant, serving high quality food at reasonable prices for the Theatre District. And food is good, well portioned!! Would definitely recommend if you are staying in the area and want to avoid expensive hotel meals, or if you're looking for a pre or post show meal!",,,
16,Peter B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",31,176,93,4.0,6/26/2017,"I was concerned upon seeing the middle aged to older folks populating the restaurant that money was no object there and the food an afterthought, despite having eaten there years again with my dad. Here we were again at this place. The organic roast chicken with mashed potatoes, string beans and jus was tender on the inside and with crispy skin -- essentially con fite -- delicious. The caesar salad was crisp and fresh and the dessert, a chocolate mousse, seemed to be milk chocolate not dark as I prefer, but nevertheless smooth tasting and well presented. Salmon tartar and the grilled salmon, which my dad had, were tasty. Washed down with a $38 but good bottle of malbec, I can't complaint even a bit.",3,,
17,Charisse S.,"Crown Heights, Brooklyn, NY",130,192,359,3.0,1/3/2016,"I came in around 1:30 yesterday afternoon with a large Meetup group of around 20.  We had called ahead, so they were expecting us. We were seated pretty much right away, which is impressive considering how large our group was.Now I should say that I was very disappointed when I found out that they were not serving brunch. I saw several pictures on yelp of breakfast food, so I was confused as to why we were given a lunch menu. I was then told by the waiter that they only serve brunch on Sundays :(I'll try not to hold it against them, but I was caught off guard. The lunch menu had plenty of good options, so I settled on the Croque Monsieur because it was the closest thing to breakfast I could find. It was very tasty, and quite a big portion. The waiters were attentive and we were served quickly and allowed to hang out after we paid our bill.I guess I'll return to check out their brunch offerings one day.",2,,
18,Nan C.,"Queens, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/28/2018,"I made reservations for pre theater lunch today. Upon arrival, we were told that the kitchen had a problem and that only a limited menu of cold foods would be a available. We decided to stay and ordered from the limited menu. After ordering & eating our delicious salads & sandwiches but before ordering dessert,  I asked our waiter if anything would be complimentary. He said no. We asked to speak to the manager.The waiter returned and informed us that the entire meal would be complimentary under the circumstances.Wow!!! All I wanted was a free cookie! The food was delicious, the service was excellent and management was generous, courteous and professional.This is a place that truly knows how to treat its customers!!!I have eaten at the West Bank Cafe often. The food and service have always been excellent. But it now has earned a warm place in my heart.",,,
19,Alison B.,"Orlando, FL",116,115,7,4.0,10/21/2016,"I don't know why it's so hard to find a good meal in the Theater District, but I'm so glad to have found this great little spot -- it's my new go-to when I'm in the area! Tasty food and a casually elegant atmosphere. It's not pretentious, but there's a good vibe. I'm a big brunch fan, and on the weekends it feels like a real neighborhood place. On a nice day they'll open the doors -- you can have a long, leisurely meal and watch the people and dogs walk by. I love a good Cobb salad, and this one doesn't disappoint. For lunch and dinner I usually go with a burger. What can I say, I don't have the fanciest taste buds.Never a bad experience at West Bank, can't wait to go back!",4,1,1
20,Deborah C.,"Newport, Bellevue, WA",0,5,0,4.0,2/21/2018,"Great local restaurant.  Went there on a weekday afternoon for lunch.  No reservations, however if you show up after noon, you'll need reservations.  Within 15 minutes of arrival the place went from quiet to packed.  The menu is simple and has variety of options that will please any palette.  There were a lot of tasty options, I had a difficult time picking one.  We started with the prosciutto deviled eggs, spicy and delicious.  I had the margherita pizza, simple with a thin crust.  My husband had the orecchiette. Prices were fair, the restaurant was very clean, and the staff was fantastic.  Friendly and quick to respond without rushing.The best part is the restaurant was filled with local customers.  Lots of fun and very entertaining.  Will definitely go again",,,

23,Pete G.,"Bloomington, IL",79,39,19,5.0,6/13/2017,"Looking for something interesting to eat after a matinee and this place worked marvelously for me. Rather than going for an entree, I picked several starters and had a fantastic meal (with some nice Ardbeg Corryvrecken scotch). Salmon Tartare with lime crème fraîche, jalapeño, and roe. Roasted Artichokes with lemon aioli, cherry tomato confit, and basil tempura(!). Blistered Shoshito Peppers with sea salt. Such great flavors and textures.",,,
24,Nina L.,"New York, NY",541,717,153,4.0,6/20/2016,"I'm totally skeptical of restaurants in the Theater District...between the mismatched menus and theater-going discount ploys, I usually find myself repulsed by the idea of dining anywhere in the area. This of course, is totally rude of me as there's some quality food and well-established business owners in this part of Manhattan and West Bank Cafe is definitely amongst them.I came here with my family after a show at Stage 42 across the street. We had a reservation which I imagine would be needed if you came a bit closer to the dinner hour (we arrived to a lot of tables at 5PM but the restaurant was mostly filled by 7PM). With the exception of the appetizer we ordered fairly simple American dishes all of which we were pleased with. The Italian-inflused app was the most memorable portion of the meal...grilled artichokes atop a lemon aioli with garnished with a smidge of pesto and the all-to-amazing tempura-ed basil. Seriously, tempura basil...why isn't everyone doing this? Of the entrees I sampled, I most enjoyed their take on a burger which although simple, was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The atmosphere was a bit dated, but the wait staff was attentive and incredibly friendly. While this may not be a destination restaurant for the Manhattan or even the area, I would definitely return based on the lack of pretension and non-tourist nature. Their ability to make satisfying, comforting new American food is evident and worthy of try to all those considering.",3,,
25,Holl D.,"Warrenton, VA",51,2,0,3.0,6/7/2018,Food was pretty good but staff was very unfriendly. Especially the hostess. I thought she was just being rude to me but then one person after another she was rude. The waiter wasn't welcoming at all either.,,,

It was so nice and toasty and the hosts were super welcoming. We were seated right away and given the option of a table near the window or more inside the restaurant. I didn't even want to look at that bastard snow so we opted for the inside table. It was about 6PM on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't jam packed (which we think probably had more to do with the snow storm because it looks like a place that is usually pretty crowded). For an appetizer, my boyfriend got the calamari. He loved it. He got the organic chicken and I got the WBC Burger. Both were delish. The staff were very friendly and didn't rush us out (since our play didn't start until 8, we had a lot of time to kill and obvi couldn't walk around in that snow).

34,Erin C.,"Moorestown, NJ",137,555,89,4.0,10/13/2015,"My friends and I arrived just before a downpour. Our group of 7 had made a reservation just 2 hours before on a Friday night. We had tickets for the burlesque show downstairs later that night. We were seated at the front of the restaurant. It was extremely stuffy, and the hostess kindly opened the ceiling to floor windows. Minutes later, the rain began to leak past the outdoor overhang. Alas.Not to worry, we all secured boozy beverages quickly. None of the cocktails seemed to blow anyone's mind, but the melon mule was certainly acceptable. Even better were (a) the service and (b) the food. Our waiter was cheerful and on point. A friend and I split first the kale and octopus salad. It was delicious. The octopus was tender and flavorful. I loved it. Who knew, then, that the linguini would be jsut as good. We next shared the black linguini with rock shrimp. Not sure which was better, the tomato confit or the shrimp. Let's go with the entire dish. It was lighter than expected and delicious. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. I also had one of my friend's risotto balls, an accurate foreshadowing of the satisfying meal to come. Good job, West Bank Cafe, the bachelorette party was off to a great start.Just one caveat: the truffle mac and cheese, which we ordered downstairs but came from the same kitchen obviously, was awful. It's orzo, first of all, and had way too much truffle. Nothing good or balanced about this dish. (The stinky cheese plate, on the other hand, while not stinky, was tasty)",3,2,2

Updated review","Went last night for sit down dinner service.  Was very pleased that the table was ready early, so that when we 15 minutes out, we were sat immediately.  Nice server.  Never expressed opinion about any of the things we ordered.  Never did a hard upsell, even when my dining companion asked for a recommendation on vodka.  I ordered up the Tennessee Pines.  Then we both ordered dirty martinis.  The Pines was a rip off, as the glass was tiny (I could nearly palm the entire thing, and it was filled to capacity with ice.  A couple sips and I was done.  For $15?  Methinks not.The martinis were much more potent when we ordered directly from the bartender.  Reads, to me, as a weaker pour for customers whose tips will be divided amongst floor and bar staff.  But could have just been an off batch, or manager may have been watching.The burger was really solid.  Quality meat mix, nailed the temp, solid bun, a bit lettuce and red onion heavy, but very solid for the $18 price tag and location, especially considering the generous portion of fries.  The Blank Linguini was also quite nice.  Very fresh option for the palate for spring.  Fresh pasta is used, good ingredients.  Not shy about the parmesan shavings (upon request).Overall, didn't leave super pleased at the price tag for dinner for two due to the beverage inconsistencies.  But still recommend grabbing a spot at the bar for a more casual experience, where you can grab a stronger drink, and relax.",3,,

It was one of my friend's going away party, so the friend that had organized this had to pull a lot of strings in order to find a place that would accommodate a party as large as ours (we had over 20 people in our party), but this place was more than willing to accommodate us all.I shared a bunch of sides with my friends and everything was quite tasty, particularly their truffle mac and cheese. The service was really impeccable, making sure our glasses were always filled with our beverages of choice, and our food came out promptly after we had ordered. The place also was quite cozy feeling, with maroon curtains and maroon velvet upholstered benches. I would love to come back here for an actual entree and/or brunch in the future.",2,,

It was a very good burger, with nice flavor. The lady had her Lemon Ricotta Pancakes..which were amazing. Light, fluffy, delicious! Pancakes were definitely spot on. Buttermilk Biscuits were okay.

Then finally they agreed to deliver it. Waited 30 minutes and called, but they told me they are waiting for their delivery guy, fine. Waited another 30 minutes and called again but they said I didn't give them my address so my salads been sitting there - but I gave my address an hour ago when I first called them.

I don't expect to be toasty warm when I stop at corner stand for  a slice or a coffee and donut but in a restaurant  with cloth tablecloths and napkins, a three-course menu and a large if undistinguished wine line, I do expect to be comfortable. When I brought our discomfort to the attention of the manager I was, with attitude, told:"" that's the way the owner wants it kept""; in other words: if you don't like it well then it's your problem.

They have a great rotating selection of craft beers at good prices (only an extra $2 for a large stein!), well prepared food (great burgers AND great fish) and attentive service.  We went tonight and they had specials for people running the marathon which was a nice touch, since we both ran today and we're in need of some post-run nourishment.  Also I really like the atmosphere, a lot of pre- and post-theater customers which makes for a nice environment.

It has got to be one of the few spots restaurants in the area where not having a reservation = sitting uncomfortably in a lounge or bar for diner. As soon as we walked in we were seated right away.. Waiter was very friendly. Although I noticed one of the waitresses wearing uggs. That seemed a little out of place but I guess being on your feet the whole time.. Eh I can let that one slide.

Nothing was disgusting, but it just wasn't very good either. Processed/pre-prepared hash browns were greasy and not very tasty. The brioche bun was like a regular hamburger roll. No buttermilk biscuits on Sunday morning. Not enough spinach in the kitchen to have some added to the hash browns. Virtually ignored by the staff who forgot to bring toast, coffee and water. When four people have hash browns and ask for ketchup, bringing over one small dish isn't gonna cut it. Bathrooms need to be cleaned like whoa. Cool vibe inside with a theatre down below. The $14 bloody Mary martini was good, but we were never asked if we wanted another, so we only had one. Wouldn't return.",1,,

The main course was the chicken pacatta and the steak frites. The chicken was quite acidic and strange tasting. The consistency was also not quite right as it was downright a gooey sour dish. The steak frites on the other hand was delish! I had it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The fries were on the better side. For dessert, we had the caramel mousse and the lemon cake... I believe. Both were not exciting and overly sweet. Food presentation is great. Good place for after a late night bway show.",,,

My wife's chicken was a little on the cold side and a bit pink. Appetizers were excellent. We will give it another shot but only one more,,,
68,Amanda C.,"New York, NY",20,21,4,5.0,1/19/2015,"This place was unbelievable in its quality of service, cocktails, and food! We had a large group that would range from twelve to fifteen people, so I made a reservation the day before over the phone. Such a friendly departure from all the other establishments in Manhattan! It had already been a struggle to find a restaurant that would accommodate so many of us without being exorbitantly expensive, requiring a prix fixe menu, booking two weeks in advance, breaking OpenTable's form, et cetera. The woman that answered the phone at West Bank spoke very pleasantly, and it did not feel like our party would be a burden. SIDE: Brownie points for West Bank to housing the Laurie Beechman Theatre; the named actress originated the role of Grizabella from Cats, the first musical I ever fell in love with at twelve years old.None of us had ever been here before, and I largely chose it due to its proximity to our next venue, so when we arrived to a gigantic, semi-private booth in the dining room, it exceeded all our expectations! White cloth lined the tables, beautiful shadow boxes filled the walls, and soft lighting surrounded everything. Because of the curvature of the booth, we even had spare seats to the side for coats and late-comers. Perfect.Our server waited patiently by our booth until we seemed ready to order. If we asked for a recommendation, he happily suggested a few to aid any indecision. I ordered their Manhattan, which came crafted perfectly, not too strong nor sweet. They brought fresh bread with garlic hummus for every four people, so no one had to awkwardly reach over any arms. Very considerate. Entrees and sides came well-portioned; a person could easily enjoy a full meal composed of two or three side dishes.  I feasted on their eggplant parm, made with a great tomato sauce and two kinds of cheese, plus its accompanying arugula salad. I sampled a friend's mushroom risotto, which bore strong notes of fresh rosemary; heavenly truffle mac 'n' cheese made with orzo gave a fresh spin on an old favorite; and roasted beets, beautifully made with both white and red varieties alongside warm goat cheese.  Other entrees and dishes looked just as appetizing, even if it did not meet its fate with my fork.  Everything had good flavor, and nothing was overcooked.  Our water glasses remained always filled, and they regularly checked to see if any one needed another drink.  At no point did the staff try to rush us, making the entire experience extra wonderful since it was meant to be a special dinner for a good friend. They must have also noticed our party to be a mix of drinkers and non, full-eaters and snackers, so when the bill came, most people opted to pay their own way, rather than split it evenly. I have worked in several restaurants in my time, so we must have made extra work for our server, but he seemed very understanding that it was a party of mixed budgets. He gave no quibbles nor limit on the number of credit cards for the table! No drama! We will definitely bring our future parties here.",4,,
69,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",784,815,371,4.0,3/7/2013,"I LOVED this place but since I tried only two things, I will give it a 4 star and wait for further experiences to bump to 5. After a RARE f***-up on subway left me in Queens (wrong way on the F train from 63rd, grrrr), I was pretty late to the show at the Laurie Beechman Theater (30 minutes) and was so relieved to find the place I would felt it was an oasis in the bitter cold no matter what, but it happens to be a very pleasant restaurant of which my father would approve (spacious, tables not on top of one another, attentive service, tablecloths). I had a special--winter terrine--a cooked but not hot goat cheese, eggplant, roasted potato appetizer beautifully presented and good sized, with arugula over a spectaular balsamic and olive oil dressing. I was hungry but at cupcakes earlier, didn't dance, and didn't want to spend a lot of money so I just had a side of warm goat cheese polenta which I liked. ALL sides are 7. So you can keep the bill down with one of 12 or 13 appetizers, almost ALL of which appealed to me. The prices are indeed excellent for the area and the quality surprisingly great. I loved the people working both in the cabaret and the restaurant and between the Met Room (I think the food there is far less good but I've never had it) and 54 Below (excellent food but slightly  more expensive), there are three cabarets very close together whose listings you can check nightly for a show with a decent, not extravagant, meal. Entrees are normal: low 20s, a few higher. But the starters are in the 11 to 13 range and the sides all 7 so you can keep the food around 20. Joel Gott Cab very good.",3,,1

71,Oscar K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",75,18,0,5.0,2/23/2015,"The year is still young, but I will be hard-pressed to find anywhere that can serve me a dinner better than West Bank Cafe. It was the final eatery of my time on vacation in New York and what a final eatery it was.The atmosphere is phenomenal. The soft lighting and smooth ambient feel provide a nice reprieve from the hustle of Time Square.I had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, and she was an absolute pleasure to speak with. Our server, Larry, was equally wonderful: he had wonderful recommendations, speedy delivery, and was a pleasant conversationalist in passing.I started with the Risotto Balls. Between me and the two other members of my company, we inhaled them in minutes. They were phenomenal. And I am not even a fan of risotto balls. Appetizer finished, I ordered their three course meal (soup/salad, entree, dessert). The soup was wonderful, but the real star of the meal was the salmon entree. Now, I love seafood. And I don't mean just as a friend. I'm not talking about some vacation romance. I'm talking about a serious, committed relationship. Take note when I say that this was the best salmon I've ever had. It was moist and warm and lacked the generic-salmon-taste I find too common at restaurants. Paired with the sauvignon blanc recommended by Larry, it was even more splendid.I finished the meal with a lemon mousse dessert and a glass of Macallan 12 with warm water. Next time you are around Times Square, ask yourself a question: do you want to have angels frolic on your taste-buds? If yes, go to the West Bank Cafe. You will not be disappointed.",1,1,1

Decided to drop on in Saturday afternoon. Empty except for a few tables. They have some sidewalk seating but not sure who would want to sit and watch the mess of traffic on 42nd and 9th avenue. Food selections are standard American fare, reasonably priced, and large in portion size. Unfortunately i found the taste to be uninspiring. From the garlic hummus they served with bread (olive oil or butter even would have tasted better) to the sauce with the calamari, to the wedge salad I got, everything just seemed roughly average, if even.  Will certainly return for sake of convenience, but there are certainly other options in the hood (or are there?)",,,

I shared 4 plates with a friend and some were better than others but overall great food and very attentive service!1) Before our meal they brought out a plate of bread and what seemed like a white bean hummus. Nice touch and the hummus was delicious.2) Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. Really fresh and the goat cheese/beet/orange/arugala combo was perfect.3) Truffled mac and cheese. Big disappointment. The pasta used was orzo and it was sort of mushy...no bread crumb crust and weak cheese flavor. By far my least favorite dish of the night.4) Mushroom risotto balls. Yum! I could eat a plateful of these. Really cool concept and served with a nice creamy sauce.5) ***Butternut Squash Gnocchi*** AMAZING! This was by far our favorite plate of the nice. The mushroom sauce it came with was heavenly and the walnuts added a nice texture. I will go back just for this dish. Overall, nice precursor to our show. They ask you when your show starts to make sure you're on time. They are used to the theater crowd but I found the atmosphere nice but not over the top or snooty.

I had the lemon ricotta pancakes; I would skip them next time. My sister had something with eggs and lox; it's on their menu, but I forget its name. That looked delicious, and she said it was. Coffee was not refilled in a timely manner. In sum, it's not the worst place to eat, but there are better, even if you want to stay nearish to the theaters if you're seeing a show.",,,

Though a random choice, our early dinner at the West Bank Cafe turned out to be a wonderful decision.With the windows open to a warm spring breeze, the Cafe became an unexpected oasis where we were able to enjoy a pause from the constant energy that is 42nd Street on a late Spring afternoon.We ordered a delicious calamari appetizer accented with a tangy-smooth chipotle aioli dipping sauce. For entrees, I gambled on the fish tacos which were terrific, and my wife enjoyed a perfectly-cooked house cheeseburger. As a side, I added Brussels sprouts (who can pass up fresh sprouts?) that were uniquely seasoned with tiny, salty pancetta bits -- very nice. Match that with a dark German draft beer, and I could not have asked for a more reviving meal.Not yet ready to re-join the bustle, we extended out stay by ordering dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet Apple Tarte, while my wife raved about the rich flavor of her Butter Toffee Parfait.

If you eat at the bar, a white cloth napkin will be folded once and placed under your dish to serve as a triangular placemat. The bartender is mature, and the drinks were delicious. They didn't taste overpowering at all. We had the mushroom rice ball app as well as the grilled shrimp app. You only get three shrimp, they're not jumbo so it will not be enough for even a snack. -Thank goodness for the rice balls :) they're just a tad larger than bite-sized, but you get plenty (8?).",1,,

I ate 1/4 of the burger in hopes that I would discover the medium-rare burger a few bites in... but alas I did not. When confronted with this disappointment the server just kind of stood there and mumbled do you want to speak to a manager? I declined since I was rushing.

We naively assumed that we'd be able to find a place for brunch around Hell's Kitchen but most places were jam packed. We walked in to West Bank (and I suppose it's because it's above a theater and is likely mostly for theater patrons) and our group of 7 was seated immediately in a nice, quiet, open dining room. The server/host were super cool and chatted with us while we waited for the rest of the group. $8 brunch mimosas and $2.50 unlimited coffee kept us at bay and once the whole group arrived we got a litany of brunch items including lemon ricotta pancakes (delicious and sweet), croque monsieur (amazing!) and omelettes.

The whole staff was great about making sure our food & bill all came quickly and we got out of the restaurant by 6:30, in plenty of time to walk over to the theater. I had a delicious cocktail, a classic Caesar salad, perfect salmon with vegetables, and chocolate bread pudding for dessert. I will definitely come back next time I'm in New York.",,,1
92,Joanna C.,"ASTORIA, NY",463,706,277,2.0,1/25/2014,"Ok option for pre-theater go-ers! I was able to make a reservation last minute on Open Table, and we showed up a few minutes late, and the restaurant was mostly empty (which filled up pretty quickly once we sat down)!A few gripes about the service...- I hate it when servers say ""tap"" water. I get it, it's for the upsell, but come on. I always respond, ""Ice water will be great""- We were never told the specials. I even tried prompting him by asking what the soup of the day was, but no further info. We had to overhear the specials from the other tables, and by then it was too late.- my husband's crab cake was cold. Like not ""lukewarm"" or even warm. It was cold. They should note that on the menu, and the server should have warned us about it since I think most people would expect at least a warm crab cake? When he asked if it should be warm, the server's response was just, ""uuuuuuuuuuuuuh, it should be warm"" My husband ended up eating half and just sharing my pork chop with me (which was juicy and delicious)- the bread pudding was unlike any bread pudding I've ever had. It was like a brownie - no chunks of bread, just a homogeneous brownie type dessert.Our entire experience was just ok. The rest of the service was pretty attentive, and they filled up our water glasses, but I expected more from this place after reading the glowing reviews. Our server wasn't friendly or warm (which made us look longingly at the other side of the restaurant at the servers who seemed a lot nicer than our server!) - maybe it was because we were the only couple under the age of 50??Ending with some pro's:- the pork chop was massive and juicy and perfectly cooked - best pork chop I've had in a while!- loved the bread the garlicky bean dip to start - they brought out more bread without us asking- risotto balls were awesome",2,,
93,Marie S.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",3,51,19,4.0,1/21/2014,"I am only giving this four stars because our waiter was awful. I am assuming because of agism as we were the only  younger couple in a mostly empty place (we were there before a show, so 530). For the record we still tipped well because the rest of the wait staff was very attentive. Otherwise, the food was incredible. We both ordered the angus steak burger and it blew us away. For appetizers I also highly recommend the parmesan balls, they just melt in your mouth! Wonderful tasting experience overall. If you want a non-alcoholic drink I also recommend the Ginger beer. Overall would definitely come back as the food and the prices matched well.",2,,

103,Christina T.,"Wakefield, MA",4,5,0,4.0,10/19/2013,"We came here for Brunch on a Sunday. There was no wait and we got seated almost right away. The food was DELICIOUS. I got an omelette with peppers and cheddar that was cooked to perfection. The potatoes that came with it were very tasty too. My fiance got the steak and eggs and he ate every bite, even the little salad that came with it which he normally doesn't touch. For dessert we got the dark chocolate bread pudding which we also devoured. They do the $17 for refillable mimosas deal which seems to be pretty standard for the area. For the two meals, dessert, one $17 mimosa order (for me), and a couple glasses of OJ (for him), we paid about $80 including tip. The individual entrees are reasonably priced but it all adds up. I only am giving it 4 stars because it's a little dark in there and we waited a long time for the check, which had a mistake on it once it came. The waiter promptly fixed it once I pointed it out, so no problems there. I will definitely recommend this place.",1,,
104,Christine L.,"Lakewood, CA",62,9,2,1.0,8/12/2015,"Our last meal in the city, and this place was a disaster. We arrived and it was pretty full inside and got a table in the corner for 2 rather quickly. Hostess was very nice, but the downhill came shortly after.Our server came to the table, don't know his name bc he didn't introduce himself, mumbled a few words and poured our water. Then came back a few minutes later and took our order. Okay so far.We ordered the risotto balls for an appetizer. This can be skipped, the sauce was the true winner here.Ordered two drinks, names I can't remember but one was a spritz and my friend ordered a berry one. The spritz was awful. Left a bitter aftertaste and although it was a lot, it was just to gross to drink.Food finally came, I ordered the orecchiette which was good, friend ordered the steak frites and it was good too. Never got refills on water, tried to grab our waiter's attn but he was busy giving water to his other tables. Finally had to ask a busboy to give us water. Ordered the ice cream sundae, this can be skipped too.Here comes the part that topped off my night. Asked for the check while ordering dessert so we could leave right away. Took an unusually long time and came back to us when dessert was already finished... Defeated the whole purpose. Saw our waiter asking another waiter for help and heard her say, oh you charged the card twice?Hmm, I'm thinking, well let's see if they mention this to me. Check comes back to us, no mention of the double charge, no mention of a voided transaction. Cool maybe it wasn't me? Double checked my credit card app to see my current transactions and there it is, 2 charges. Called the manager over to ask what happened. She had to do some service recovery but at this point I'm already upset. Sure accidents happen but at least have the courtesy to mention it to me. The manager double checked to make sure it was cancelled and she said it was but couldn't give me a confirmation # bc they hadn't closed yet, another interesting excuse I've never heard.We left, the waiter couldn't look us in the face to even apologize, manager had her back to us, whatever bye.Called my credit card company to make sure the charges were voided. Extra hassle on our last night in ny. Not coming back on any future trips but to locals, avoid this place unless you want mediocre food with horrid service!",,,

Updated review","Solid very solid - after an afternoon play we went here for a 6 PM dinner and started off at the bar with a very nice French Bordeaux wine.  Then on to a delicious dinner with my wife having a simple lasagna and me a roasted chicken.  WOW this place is always right on the money with their food, service and value pricing.  Bottom line ____ delicious dinner including apps, mains and dessert all washed down with a lovely wine for $113 before tip makes for a cost friendly dinning experience in Manhattan.This is perhaps our 4th or 5th visit over the past couple of years and we are bound to return and for good reason.",1,,

But the last two days we were in the neighborhood and I figured that I would give it a shot. And I am glad I did. The host was amazingly pleasant and seated us where we would be comfortable. The server was attentive, friendly and a pleasure. The staff was there when you needed something.  The food was as good, if not better than I remember and the prices were not that much different. We had a very pleasant lunch. The following day we had reservations for a nearby restaurant. But upon going there the place was not what we expected. So we came back to West Bank Cafe for dinner. Saturday night. Pre theater and crowded. The hostess couldn't have been more accommodating. Though we had no reservations she seated us immediately at a very nice table for 2. The server was both beautiful and perfect. She was attentive, friendly and very helpful. And the food was really good. The roasted chicken dish was perfect as was the salmon entree. The drinks good and the bill, though over $100 with tip was more than fair. We love this place.",1,,

These pancakes are sweet yet still have the tartness of lemon. They're creamy and soft - almost a cake like consistency. Just delish! They also come with fruit and 2 strips of bacon, which was perfect because I love mixing sweet and salty things together. Plus, I just really enjoy bacon.We were also given fruit smoothies in a double shot glass on the house, which was a cute little surprise.All in all, a great brunch place in Hell's Kitchen!",,,

My family saw the matinee of Lord of the Dance and we were planning on walking to the tree and then making our 6:30 reservation. We were pretty starved after the show so we figured we'd give it a shot to show up an hour and a half early. They were very friendly and sat us immediately. We started with the fried calamari and Brussels sprouts and goat cheese polenta (listed as sides, but we wanted them to start). The Brussels sprouts had pancetta and they were roasted to perfection. I also pretty much single handedly destroyed the goat cheese polenta. For entrees, my sister and I split the wild mushroom risotto and the chicken. Wow. Both dishes were out of this world. The chicken was incredibly moist and the risotto had plenty of mushrooms and butternut squash sprinkled in! My parents got the orrichette and rigatoni bolognese. I was too busy chowing down on the risotto to notice them eat, but they both were satisfied with their meals. The only comment was although the chicken and risotto entrees were large and plentiful, the two pasta dishes were a bit smaller in comparison. But, since we enjoyed so many appetizers, it ended up being alright! Our waiter was incredibly attentive and was constantly topping off our water glasses. Looking forward to my next trip back here!",1,,

It's pretty good stuff.The Scottish salmon was quite good -- cooked just right (grilled, I believe) so that it was still tender throughout. They also serve tilapia which I was amazed to discover is wild-caught (far healthier than farmed but wild can be difficult to find)! That, too, was also delicious, although I'm not that big of a fan of breaded fish.I've also had the grilled peppered shrimp as an appetizer. It was phenomenal, especially because it comes avocado, which complements the flavors really well. Too bad the portion is so small for that price.

They seated us in semi-private booth by way of a low partition with leather banquettes wrapping around the perimeter so, we had additional seating, plenty of room to spread out, a place to put all our coats as well as mill around. We were there for almost 3 hours but they never once made us feel rushed, not to order nor to leave. For a Saturday night in Manhattan that's pretty great.The food was excellent. I sampled a bit of everybody's dish because I'm greedy and uncouth like that. They make the best mushroom risotto I've ever had. The fresh rosemary imparted an aromatic depth with no bitterness and the butternut squash still had some firmness to it instead of being mushy. The generously portioned, roasted beet and warm goat cheese salad had a delicate coat of dressing the way I like so as to enhance rather than cover up the taste of the main ingredients.  The cocktails were well-balanced and deceptively potent.Our server was always nearby to attend to our water and cocktail glasses, food or drink orders as latecomers trickled in even an hour later, but never pestered us in any way.By the time we were finally finished luxuriating in our soft amber lit, leisurely meal, we were pleasantly surprised that there was no automatic gratuity tacked on and they allowed us to pay with any combination of cash and multiple credit cards as needed.I would definitely come here again, especially for a large party.",,,

Because WBC is where many a cast and crew wind up after work.

Their risotto-based ""mac and cheese"" is out of this world as an inexpensive appetizer.Steve, the owner, one of the nicer people you  will ever meet, and as a sommelier, offers very nice wines a tad below what you will pay elsewhere.

But if there was ever a place to cause me to break this rule, West Bank Cafe is it. What an outstanding meal we had. I started with the roasted beets salad. This was a delicious, good-sized salad with plenty of goat cheese. (Can there ever be too much of that?) My entree was the fish special, which was branzino (a Mediterranean fish). I was served the whole filet, so this was a very large portion. But the fish was done to a turn and came to the table sizzling. The sides included fingerling potatoes and other vegetables... standard restaurant sides. We also went for a prix fixe selection of Caesar salad, roasted chicken, and lemon mousse. All of these were deemed excellent, particularly the roasted chicken. The lemon mousse was outstanding but the dessert menu has some other great things on it too. I had a large mug of a California IPA: Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA that was great. If you like IPAs, this one is worth trying. The wait staff was excellent and friendly. A definite 4.5 star place. I'll be back, and if my second meal is as good as the first, I'll bump up the stars. Recommended.",3,1,

I have the crab cake. The cake was mostly crab and seasoned nicely. The sauce was delicious as well the tartly dressed arugula on top.

I was so excited to discover West Bank Cafe several years ago because it was off the beaten path. I've been here numerous times and have always had fairly good meals.My friends and I made a reservation, came here, waitress seemed to be pleasant. We ordered drinks and our food and our waitress checked to see if we had tickets for a show (to know how quickly to move). Busboys and such brought out our food and checked on us, but truly our waitress was nowhere to be found.Our meal was good - I enjoyed my caesar salad and the gnocchi - two staple dishes in my life. I tasted my friends spaghetti squash and orecchiette - both were very tasty. All seemed fine until we finished our meal and just had wine on the table (2 bottles mind you....) when my friend pulled out a cupcake for another friends belated birthday. it was so sweet. I watched what appeared to be the hostess and manager staring at us and talking about us. Finally our waitress appeared and we asked for forks. (keep in mind, she was so MIA prior to this that even if we wanted their dessert, she was nowhere to be found to even offer that to us). She grabbed forks and then disappeared with the manager (I think) and he came over and gave us forks and in the most passive aggressive way said - ""Oh look, there's a cupcake on the table.""We got our check....they took a while to process our credit cards....we watched other tables itching to get out that were clearly heading to a show too.Very strange experience. Good food but if you don't want outside dessert in your restaurant maybe your waitress should be somewhere visible or you should speak up. Thank you and goodnight.",,,
149,M G.,"New York, NY",9,49,0,1.0,7/14/2015,This was one of the worst meals I have had in NYC.  We were a party of 4 and placed our meal and drink orders at 6:30 with a male waiter.  30 minutes later a waitress comes over to apologize and introduce herself as she is officially our waiter explaining that the waiter was covering for her as all her tables were seated at once.  She asks about our drink orders (which still have not arrived) and writes them down. We tell her that we also already ordered our food which she assures us has been entered. She also asks if we need to be out at a certain time - we tell her that we have an 8 pm show.  30 minutes later - no food.  We have been seated for an hour at this point and tables that have arrived after us are already eating.  We flag our waitress down and she says that she thinks it is coming out next as she saw it when she was coming out of the bathroom...  The food finally comes - but only one person's order.  The rest of the food comes 5 minutes later.  The dipping sauce is missing from the calamari which we need to ask for twice.  I ordered the salmon and requested it cooked medium.  After an hour of preparation the salmon was raw in the middle.  I didn't bother sending it back as we had a show at 8pm and needed to leave.  Who knows how long it would have taken to get the correctly prepared meal.  Go elsewhere.,,,

The only thing that we liked was the risottos balls. They were tasty and had a nice dipping sauce. The calamari was awful, it was probably one of the worst I ever had. It was rubbery, cold and the breading was awful, we all hated it. The mac and cheese was very soupy and it was made with orzo, so it felt like we were eating a thick cream orzo soup that was barely warm. It was tasty, but I wish it was made with more of a traditional mac and cheese pasta. The truffle taste was a little overwhelming. Our service was very friendly.

I immediately order a glass of wine and the Salmon tartare. I am very picky about my salmon. I do not like farm raised as it's usually too fishy. This was definitely not farm raised. It was so delicious and fresh. It had the perfect balance of flavor. I ordered the veal for my main entree. It was nothing special. It was breaded and fried which I think doesn't do much for a good cut of meat. (-1 star). After a second glass of wine, we perused the desert menu. There were many delicious options, but the waiter said the Butterscotch Parfait is their speciality so we went with it. OMG! At first bite I pictured myself rubbing it all over my body. Typically it takes something chocolate to make me feel so sultry, but the richness and coolness of this parfait was incredible!

185,Evan G.,"San Francisco, CA",222,730,362,3.0,2/7/2010,"A staple place for dinner in HK.  Nothing too fancy, but just a cut above some of the other nearby places.  Good menu, friendly staff, potent drinks.  I likes.  The deviled eggs are terrific.  The mac & cheese is more like orzo or risotto.  The bathrooms are a trip - I recommend a visit, but won't spoil the details (er, uh, maybe...the urinals are probably unlike any you've ever seen.)The theatre/performance space downstairs is a lot of fun, too.  Good times!",,,
186,Christopher H.,"Framingham, MA",0,1,0,4.0,12/11/2013,"We found this restaurant on Yelp while looking for a lunch spot for our daughter and her 2 friends.  We were spending the day in NYC for her 16th birthday and wanted more of a local feel and a quiet out of the way spot to relax and refresh after walking the city all day.  Arrived at 2:30 on a Sunday, as the lunch crowd was clearing out.  It was just what we were looking for!  The service was great and the menu satisfied our 3 teenagers as well as my husband and I.  No easy task!  I would return without hesitation on my next trip to the city.",1,,
187,Johnny Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,2,1.0,10/21/2015,"Stopped in with a friend at 5:30pm this past Tuesday for cocktails and appetizers before a 7pm show across the street at Theater Row.  Bar was full, the restaurant was empty, and there was one person dining at the tables out front.  We asked if we could take one of the tables out front.  Not for drinks and appetizers, we were told, but we were welcome to stand at a shelf that runs opposite the bar if we'd like.  As a couple in our sixties, we took a pass on that generous offer -- from an empty restaurant -- and headed around the corner to 44-1/2 on Tenth.  Although fairly full, they were happy to give us a table and take the $75 we spent on liquor and appetizers in just under an hour.  On our way back to the theater, we couldn't help but notice that those outside tables at West Bank were still empty.  Even the single diner was gone.  It's not every restaurant that can afford to turn away business.  Congrats on your success, West Bank Cafe!",,,
188,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1146,1258,14,4.0,3/17/2009,"Downstairs is the new location for the sexy Burlesque show known as Le Scandal. Not quite as cozy as the now extinct Cutting Room, but amazing service. After all, aside from the show tickets, 20% gratuity was included in our bill and there was a $15 minimum per person. Nipple flashing Bonnie Dunn works her magic once again and you could never tell she's been performing for 8 1/2 years. The food looked good as we made our way downstairs. We already ate dinner but I ordered an Arborio Rice Pudding ($8) which was very good. The rice grains were big and the creamy texture was to die for (that's what she said). Served super cold, it was a perfect way to close my stomach's doors for the night. The cocktails were average. I'd come back for the food.Total came out to $19/pp after everything",2,1,1

Updated review","We went for brunch at 11:30am on Sunday morning. This is nearly our tenth time visiting for brunch. What makes this place a ""5"" in my book is that everything is excellent (food, service, drinks, atmosphere and value). Matt is a great waiter. The owner Steve is very attentive too.My wife and I bring friends each time we go. We drive by a lot of restaurants on our way there (from Inwood). This is the best we have found. You will not be disappointed!",,,
190,Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",299,363,1,4.0,9/14/2007,"Great spot to have a post-performance drink and/or meal, especially if you've just seen a show at Theater Row across the street.  This seems to be the go-to post-show place for the actors too, so if you're feeling a bit stalkerazzi, follow them here.  When ""Hurlyburly"" was playing a couple years ago, you'd find the entire cast (Ethan Hawke, Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, etc.) hanging out here after every show.  I only know this b/c a show I was working production on was playing at Theatre Row concurrently, and we'd all end up at West Bank Cafe together.Aside from the celebrity sightings, you'll also find pretty good food here.  They do nice takes on traditional bistro fare, like fried calamari with two delicious dipping sauces (chipotle aioli and parsely pesto).  I also highly recommend their short ribs-on-chips appetizer, which seems like an unlikely pairing but will make your mouth very happy.  Last time I was here, I had their linguine with clam sauce for my main course.  This is one of my favorite pasta dishes, and what I usually order if I don't feel very adventurous.  I'm generally a traditionalist when it comes to this dish since I'm always trying to find one to match the simple, yet flavorful authenticity of the one I had in Italy.  West Bank Cafe does their own take on it - they use a little creme fraiche in the sauce and add some pancetta.  The sauce is a lot thicker and heartier than the traditional version so I wouldn't even consider it the same dish, but I love it.  I also had a few bitefuls of my bf's truffled mac&cheese.  Again, they've done their own spin on this standard dish by using orzo and much sharper cheese (gruyere and some others).  That first bite will definitely catch you off guard - in a good way.West Bank Cafe is a reliably good restaurant in the Theater District.  Good ambiance, good food...and the occasional good view of some celebrities.",4,2,4
191,Celia M.,"ASTORIA, NY",8,41,0,4.0,4/4/2012,"I have had so many memorable meals in this place!  I guess everyone has.  West Bank doesn't need my positive review, but I will give it to them anyway.  Sometimes, you just want a good roast chicken with a nice glass of wine, and West Bank can always satisfy this urge.  The perfect after-theatre restaurant.  I love sitting at the bar (when I can find a seat), but the service in the dining room is always excellent.  Smart people eat here, so I often overhear good conversations at the next table.  This is one of those restaurants where the specials are almost always worth ordering.  Service is very good - they will understand if you tell them you need to make an 8pm curtain on 47th Street.  They will never look at you funny if you show up at midnight and want to order a solid meal.  I respect this restaurant.",,,
192,Kristin M.,"New York, NY",152,207,3,5.0,12/23/2008,"First let me preface my experience here: I live across the street.This place is either a god send or will kill me due to how close it is to my apartment, the awesome bartender, OR the fact that they serve wine by the gallon. Came here last night with my sister to celebrate the holidays and unwind over a glass of wine. Enter Ken the magical bartender who let us in on the scoop of our new neighborhood all while filling our glasses with a ""splash."" I'd like to know where Ken is from as his ""splash"" was more like a glass of the yummiest wine I have ever tasted.We chatted. We laughed. We munched on bread and hummus. I had an amazing evening and we left letting him know that we'll be back. If you're in the area for a show, I definitely recommend it.Side Note: I had come here to meet up with a friend prior to my move. There is a full theater downstairs for lounge singing type performances. Will definitely need to come back for that.",3,1,
193,Mike B.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,99,0,5.0,2/18/2007,"ALWAYS...a fantastic place to go...Of course, it doesn't hurt that the bartender, David, is an old and dear friend of mine...BUT...regardless of the fact that I may know the bartender, the drinks he serves are always PERFECTLY MADE, and delicious to imbibe!Also, the Steak Frites are just the bees knees.And yet another place that takes fried calamari to a whole new level...Any time of the week is a perfect time to go, but I find that around 9pm, you're bound to get a seat...Once the later / longer shows start to let out, you'll be hard-pressed to find a spot at the bar, much less be able to get a table.So, in summary...Yummy drinks, yummy food, friendly service, great atmosphere...And, it won't cost you an arm and a leg for a great quality meal...Rock on my friends!And, if you go, DO TELL DAVID I SAID HELLO!",4,1,3
194,Lisa K.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",82,228,282,4.0,7/14/2008,"This place was DE-LISH! It's a great little restaurant that has a nice atmosphere.  A good mix of people in there during dinnertime and the service was speedy too!When we were seated, we were given water and small toasted bread (almost like home-made bagel chips) with hummus (i believe that the hummus was home-made too because it was sooo creamy!) It also came with a side order of red, green, and black olives.We shared the grilled peppered shrimp appetizer. It was sauteed peppered shrimp with grapefruit, avocado, and fennel salad. The presentation was beautiful and since we were splitting it-- we each got our own individual portion of the appetizer. I appreciate restaurants that do that because we don't have to transfer food from the appetizer plate to our own plates. My friend ordered the grilled slice skirt steak. He requested it to be cooked medium-rare and it was AMAZING! Some restaurants have difficulty cooking steak rare or medium rare because it ends up looking like a massacre in the kitchen, but this place did a great job. It was nice and red on the inside and carefully cooked on the outside. Absolute perfection!  I ordered the oven roasted-free range chicken. MMMM. It was quite tasty!!! It was served on top of the creamiest mash potatoes i've ever experienced. There was also a side of extra thin/tiny string  beans. The price range is alittle steep, but it's an adorable place with amazing food. The food is always presented very nicely and the servers kept our cups full of water! I give this place an A! I didn't give it 5-stars because it's a tad too pricey, but on a special occassion-- it's a great place. I hear the menu changes regularly by season, so i'm looking forward to what they will have in the Fall! I'm positive that I will be going back!",4,1,3
195,michael r.,"New York, NY",4,58,2,3.0,3/4/2010,"Do not, do NOT go here on a Saturday night, particularly pre-theatre.  You will be packed in like sardines, the wait staff will be overloaded and you will have trouble hearing someone talk across the table from you. You will have to move your chair and possibly the table every time someone near you enters or leaves their table.  The salmon was great, as were the scallops.  Not cheap but worth it. The food was great, but the meal was not.I bet this place could be great on a Monday or Tuesday at 7pm or so.",,,
196,Chris T.,"Arverne, Queens, NY",3,65,0,2.0,5/29/2008,"I was here for a comedy show in the downstairs theater.  Really nice space, and comfortable seating.  I only drank, so I cant comment on the food.  Most beers were $5-$6, which sounds fair given the location.  What's not fair is that it came in a 12oz glass!  I had two.  When the check came, the waitress told me there was a $15 minimum per person.  Would've been nice to know that a little earlier in the evening.  I didn't feel like pounding a beer, so I decided to absorb the cost and have my check bumped up to $15.  My total was $19.26.  Apparantly they think quite highly of their service, and add 20% to each check, even though I was a party of 1.  So nice of them to unburden me of figuring out the tip on my own.  So, 24 ounces of domestic beer for a cool $19.26.  Now that's a nice profit margin!  By the way, the comedy show was fantastic.  Todd Barry and Brad Aldous were awesome.",2,1,2
