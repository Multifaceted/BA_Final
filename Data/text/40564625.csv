1,Stephanie Michelle P.,"Miami, FL",735,159,919,4.0,10/9/2017,"Hole in the wall dark bar. Has a range of clientele from suits to construction workers. The girls behind the bar were either in bikinis or underwear. We came in right at shift change on a Friday around 5 - the change of scenery was night & day, if you know what I mean (; Happy hour offers $5 drinks, which seems like a bargain in NY. Definitely stop by this place for a drink or two, it's an interesting spot.",2,1,1
2,Nikk A.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,139,34,4.0,4/1/2018,"It is what it is lol. It's a dive bar, it's dark, the bathrooms are upstairs in a weird spot. The booze is cheap- I don't think they serve food and if they did, I probably wouldn't eat it. I don't remember if they had a good music selection, but I do remember that the bartenders wear bikinis. More power to them! I would be mortified lol. They are sweet girls though. The crowd is pretty much construction workers and random dudes that work in the area. It's kinda on the small side, but nobody invaded my personal space yet. Cool place to pre-party or even post-party.",,3,2
3,Bryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,141,101,4.0,8/14/2018,I've had some fun times here and the music is great. Bartenders are friendly and attractive but I would suggest coming in at 5pm which is shift change. Night shift has better scenery than the day shift! This definitely qualifies as a dive bar and pulls a very diverse crowd with people from all walks of life. Reminds me of the crowd from the old hogs and heifers in meat packing district. Looking to hit this place up for happy hour this week!,,,
4,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,1.0,10/8/2017,"A dive bar that smells like piss and shame. Stopped in here with my BF looking for a chill watering hole to kill time at before an event but got more than we bargained for. A real popular hangout for the ""MAGA"" crowd that doesn't have a functioning olfactory system. Went upstairs to use the bathroom which is tucked away in what looks like a squatters paradise. The carpet smells like pee! The bartenders are all women in bikinis which wouldn't be bad if they didn't look so unhappy and downtrodden by life. But this makes total sense when you see who they have to work for! The guy I assume is the owner was serving us weird looks the moment we walked in and decided to get confrontational with my boyfriend for ""taking his seat"" five minutes after he got up. I usually love a good dive, but this place plunges too low and bottoms out.",3,4,1
5,Steve c.,"Elmhurst, NY",89,5,0,5.0,2/14/2018,"For a bar in the financial district, you cant beat the prices. Add to that a great jukebox and attractive and attentive bartenders, and you have all the makings for a great bar. Philly alone is a great reason to stop by on the way home.",1,,
6,Kevin S.,"New York, NY",0,22,0,1.0,9/29/2017,"I walk in at 4:57pm on a Friday. The bartender tells me domestic beers are $5, imports are $7, and when happy hour starts at 5:00pm, beers and hard liquor are all $5. She walks away and another one asks me what I would like. I tell her that in 3 minutes I'll have a jack and coke.With a very serious face the bar tender says, ""No, you can't just stand here without drinking. You have to order it right now."" I laughed, figuring she was joking--how could a statement like that be serious, right?! So I reply, ""ok, I'll have a jack and coke.""She comes back with it and says ""that'll be $8"". I respond, ""what happened to happy hour?"" and she replied ""it's not happy hour yet. You have to pay for it.""When I refuse to pay $8 she brings over another bartender, we'll call her alpha bartender, who is more belligerent and demands in a hostile tone, ""It's 8 dollars, you have to pay for it. You can't leave without paying. 8 dollars."" I remained calm and politely refused to pay for it. ""Then you have to leave. Go!""  As I walk away I overhear alpha bartender say to the other one, ""remember his face!"", as if I did something wrong by refusing to let them take advantage of me.I give it 1 star because these people were so rude I was stunned.",1,8,
7,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,4.0,4/8/2016,"Every now and then you get tired of all the frou-frou cocktail lounges, bars with ""mixologists"" instead of bartenders, fancy wine bars, etc., and just wanna grab a drink at some place that's low brow, low stress and low end.  Just get dirty in other words.Sometimes you just wanna go back to what Manhattan used to be - when it used to have an edge - when it was primarily a grimy, seedy, dirty, rundown, inexpensive city with sketchy bars with weird themes.Like the old Paradise Club near Penn Station, where lonely married guys on their commute home to NJ, would stop by for a $10 slow dance with an attractive woman (yes, slow dance)...no lap dances, only slow dancing like at a high school prom, lol.  And all those places on 8th Avenue near the Port Authority, that offered $15 striptease shows behind a plexiglass window in a private booth.  Yes, those places really did exist, but now just a part of history and turned into chain stores - the old Playpen (is now a Shake Shack), Show World (now Duane Reade), Peep World (now the Westin), and Peep O-Rama (now Bank of America).Or the Vault in the old Meatpacking, where they had live sex and S&M shows...now a Dos Caminos restaurant.  Or Bar d'O (""Bardoe""), a West Village bar that featured drag queen shows every night...now, a trendy seafood restaurant named Ditch Plains (after a Hamptons beach of all places lol).  Wow, how times have changed.And along those lines, there were a string of ""Bikini Bars"" in the city.  No stripping, just bartenders in bikinis in dumpy dive bars with dirt cheap drinks and great jukeboxes.  Most have disappeared - Billy Stopless (now a Starbucks), Deno's Party House (now a Taco Bell), Red Rock West (now Artichoke Pizza), and countless others.But thankfully, a few survive...probably not for long though as the city continues to ""yuppify"" and ""suburbanize"". Notably, Nassau Bar, Port 41, Snafu, Wakamba, Ipanema and The Patriot.However, of those, only Nassau Bar is a true bikini bar, the others are more like ""daisy duke shorts & crop top bars"".Nassau Bar was the 1st bar I went to when I first moved to NYC in 1999.  My boss at Goldman Sachs (when we were at 85 Broad Street) took my group there on my first day at work to introduce me to my new colleagues and the city...8 Beers, 6 Tequila shots and 4am later, I was indoctrinated and sold on NYC.  So, this place has some sentimental value for me.As the years went by, I completely forgot about it, until one day walking home from work a few weeks ago, when I happened to pass it and was shocked that it was still there.  I went in, and it was exactly as it was over 15 years ago, NOTHING has changed.  Which is refreshing given this constantly changing city.Since stumbling in, I've gone back with co-workers for after-work drinks, and even though it seems like this may be a 'guy-only' bar, I've taken a few girl friends of mine and they've enjoyed it and had fun. So, if you want to step back in time for a moment, or just grab some cheap drinks with a good jukebox, or if you're just a creepy old guy that's never seen a woman in a bikini, then this is your spot!And just like Toby Ketih's song, which is on their jukebox...""I Love this Bar"".",21,14,17

10,Mark O.,"London, United Kingdom",6,55,2,1.0,10/14/2016,"I'd heard good things about this place from a (female) friend who lives close by. It's a throwback dive, with a concept: the bartenders (female) are all in bikinis and heels. But it's not really ""that kind of bar"". I'm always up for some bad taste, but not bad service. Ordered two drinks for $14. Handed over a $20 and the woman in the bikini totters off and then blanks me. Then starts talking to the guy at the bar next to me. As if I'm leaving her a $6 tip without a second word. I ask for my change and she's all ""Oh I forgot"". Of course you did darling. The lingerie Jedi mind trick doesn't work on me - I'm gay. Also - weak drinks.",2,10,
11,Paul H.,"Manhattan, NY",192,343,178,2.0,12/9/2014,"My coworkers and I nicknamed this place ""the bar out back"" as it is literally behind our building.  The nickname lives up to this place.  It is the epitome of a dive bar.  I wouldn't suggest bringing a lady here as the bartenders wear bikinis and it's pretty much a de facto gentleman's club. They have very short happy hour times (12-1pm and 5-6pm), but you can get some cheap drinks.  They have no food but will order delivery pizza for you.  The bartenders are very friendly and courteous.If you're looking for a dive in the financial district close to the subway/path but don't want to venture to Jeremy's, this is your spot.",2,1,

Updated review",Thought I'll  give this place a second  go after awhile. Still the same if not worst.  Poor service.  They bring you drinks like their drunk.  Females are ok at best. Not worth going here.  So small of a bar got like 8 security guards and a very angry owner.. Any other bar is better.. Smh,1,1,
15,Jen M.,"New York, NY",114,67,85,1.0,8/14/2015,"Came here with some co-workers after dinner. Admittedly, we did not know what we were walking into (it was right around the corner from where we had dinner), but that wouldn't have influenced my rating because I DO love dive bars. The female bartenders wear bikinis as other reviewers said, so immediately you get a sense of the clientele. The bartenders were friendly, no problems with the service at all. But as a woman walking in, every head turned and it was like flies to a lightbulb. Creepy. The novelty expressed by other reviewers doesn't ring true when you're objectified and watch other women being objectified. It leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Maybe it's kind of cute during that happy hour rush, but at 9pm when the bar is almost empty and the creeps lurk behind, not so much. I would only drink bottled beer here.",7,1,
16,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",101,439,0,2.0,1/18/2014,"I'm no prude, but was certainly a bit startled to see both female bartenders wearing tiny tiny bikinis. They were very lovely and served my friend and me quickly (we were the only females in the bar besides the bartenders). This is a pretty run of the mill dive bar that DEFINITELY caters heavily to men. Barely anyone batted an eye that we were there, but we quickly felt a bit uncomfortable being the only females with clothes on. I highly recommend to all the men out there though!",2,3,
17,Wanda N.,"New York, NY",119,417,21,4.0,11/20/2013,"Hot girls in bikinis!

18,T T.,"New York, NY",8,26,0,5.0,5/9/2016,"Best bar in Manhattan. There- I said it. bartenders in bikinis. Def leppard on the sound system - might have been old school High n Dry when I was there - can't really remember. Bunch of regulars and back office folks camped  at the bar leering at the semi retired stripper+ bartenders who don't seem to mind. Asked for a water with my beer and the bar lady misunderstood because ""Let it Go"" was cranked to 11 and called me a ""pussy"" because she thought I just wanted a water. Either way, she was right and I liked it. Christmas lights and Bud Light Shamrocks from St Pattys 2014. This is a the kind of dive bar that made manhattan awesome and is quickly disappearing - FU deBlasio you fun sponge of a mayor. The only thing this bar has in common with deBlasio is the union guys who sneak in for quick few at lunch before heading back out to drive the cranes. Great place to get drunk in downtown, full of characters, you might even see a fake boob if you order your drinks like a grown up and tip well.  Ps - this is the real deal - there's no irony here so hipsters who come asking for the rye menu will get kicked out and beaten like a drum so stick to Rusty Knot or ear inn.",1,3,2

20,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1398,568,597,2.0,9/20/2014,"This place... Wow thats all I can say. Its very dark, its your typical BAR. Didn't see any food in here just liquor so not to sure about that. I walk by here often and I notice that they are always playing good music. The one thing I found disturbing was what the bartenders were wearing. As another girl in her review said "" im no prude"" but I was definitely not feeling the bartenders attire. Ive been to many bars, lounges and clubs where the girls had on matching coordinating sexy outfits but these ladies had on bras, underwear and bathing suit bottoms. It was awkwardly confusing. They were not in shape or toned and it looked like they just picked out anything out of they're underwear drawer. Pretty gross. Its no wonder this place is always jammed packed after work. Anyway Id hate to sound like a ""hater"" but if the bartenders were younger and more fit with better lingere Id give this place a better review but it definitely had the creeps in there! No thanks! 2 stars for the drinks and the music.",4,5,2

22,Dave W.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,12,0,3.0,1/8/2013,"This is your ultra-classic, stereotypical dive bar - with waitresses wearing bikinis. My buddy Steve and I met here to discuss business. The location was chosen at it's central to both our apartments, and admittedly, I wanted to see what a bikini bar in Manhattan could deliver on a Monday night.The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a passed out guy with his head on the bar. Pretty funny. Next thing was a guy in a suit that was barely cohesive. He gave me the once up and down as I walked in (I guess I stood out as a newbie) and then went back to the 2 beers and shot in front of him.THEN I NOTICED 2 scantily clad waitresses. Uh.....OK, everyone likes something different and that's why the world is great - so I will be objective. One had DDs and the other maybe EEs/FFs. Huge. That said, both were lovely ladies and knew how to make their patrons smile - a lot. I couldn't even talk to Steve, or notice that the BCS game was on every TV in the bar it was so distracting. Ha ha.The crowd is a little rougher feeling, but no one will bother you. The waitresses were sweet and enjoy the oooggling. The beer is CHEAP and the music is really loud. If you want a place to get away from it and have a good laugh - Nassau Bar is your spot!",,4,
23,Edward D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,3,0,4.0,11/20/2014,This is the place you come if you want to see a little skin. Enjoy the dim lighting and beers with the cities working class.

The AMAZING bar staff keep the assholes out and the good times in!Shun the naysayers and let them go to John Street which smells like puke.

I never really noticed that the crowd is ALL men. But there is a reason for it, its a bikini bar. The bartenders were nice and pretty when i went in but the place is just tacky. And not cheap. I feel like we paid $4 or $5 for a bud light. So unless you want to get off on the bar tenders, I would never come here. Ever. No reason for me to ever go back. If they had killer drink specials the tackyness would completely turn into fun factor. Sticking to John St. just a couple blocks away for an awesome time, cheap drinks, without leaving your dignity at the door.",4,2,1

Does it get any better? the bartenders are very pretty but not the least bit snobbish...then again how can they be since they work in a dive bar lol they also have a great jukebox ... Single ladies take note - this bar is FULL of Pace students and union workers - translation - I was only one of 3 women in a bar filled with men. Granted they werent all lookers but there were certainly lots of cuties to choose from had I been single. Their only downfall is the bathrooms are DISGUSTING bring your purell lol,1,2,1

Wait, they're only $7!""Alright, enough of that convo.

Yeah it's cool that the bartenders are in bikinis. But the place is divey and just a real  hole in the wall. If I wanted to stare at girls wearing barely nothing, I would go to a strip club and get dances. The bathrooms are disgusting and it seems like they never wipe down the bar.

I already have a favorite. Happy hour is quite good, cheaper beers and shots - ALL shots, even top shelf - are only $3. It gets crowded after work, but that is the sure sign of a great bar. I am knocking off one star because of the ladies room. The mens room is downstairs, but the ladies have to cross a wire gate, head upstairs, through a weird dressing room and then finally get to the 2 bathrooms where one of them has a door that refuses to close.It's completely inconvenient, but hey - female customers aren't really plentiful I suppose. I came in one afternoon with a friend and did not order anything because I had to go back to work. The bartender told me that it was a one drink minimum, but the owner was there and told her that I could stay and that it was fine. That was really gracious and I appreciated it.

Not girls that look like your sister or your wife, the one that 'lettered' in debate.... We're talking smooth skinned, cute, juicy, bulging melons in neon fabric, stretched to the borders of your violent imagination. To quote Huxley, ""what treasures her's promised..""

42,Taylor W.,"New York, NY",95,29,6,3.0,7/18/2008,"I'm sure people get the picture about the place.  It's definitely your typical dive bar with a real long bar.  And there are definitely 2 bartendresses that wear a bikini top and some sort of sexy underwear or a bikini bottom.  It's an interesting place to say the least.  The real time to go is for their (short) happy hour.  I'm not sure what time it starts, but it ends at 6 PM.  It's a good happy hour though, with half priced drinks.  The problem is that after happy hour, the drinks go back up to $6, which to me, is a bit much for a dive bar, even if the bartendresses are wearing next to nothing.  I mean, you can only stare at them for so long.  End of story, you might as well go for the happy hour.  Hell, even if you don't live/work down there, take the 20 minute trip on the 4 train on down and check it out.Oh yeah, on weekends they don't have to wear bikini tops, so you might as well not check it out then.To add on to my review, Jay P, calm down there little lady.  Unless, as a man, you are not interested in women, of course you will not have a problem looking at ladies in scantily dressed clothes...  Nobody thinks the ladies are interested in them nor does anybody care.  You need to loosen up over there.",1,,

44,Mike H.,"New York, NY",20,213,0,1.0,6/3/2010,"I stopped by this place during happy hour and I was NOT impressed.  First of all THERE ARE NO HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS HERE......unless you consider $5 bottle drinks a special.  Not in my book anyway.   It was crowded and all the patrons seemed to know each other.  I entered the place by myself and I was already getting dirty looks from the regulars as if I wasn't welcomed ""in their bar"".  I simply ignored them and ordered a drink anyway.  The bartenders all dress in ""G rated bikinis"", so I'm not sure exactly that their theme is supposed to be.  It's NOT a strip bar and they don't even dance on the bar to get attention.  It's just silly if you ask me.  Their jukebox was digital, but almost everyone was playing this boring whiny rock music from the 90's, which was horrible.  I ended up leaving after my one over-priced drink, and went to The Patriot where I had a much better time!",,3,1
45,Trey P.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,28,3,3.0,8/22/2010,It's ok. But five bucks is a bit much for a High Life. Maybe I just wasn't there at the right time. The girl in the bikini was a nice touch.,,,
46,Marco F.,"New York, NY",6,29,0,1.0,9/11/2009,"Pathetic and gross old men ogling bartenders in bikinis. The bartenders are surprisingly nice and friendly, despite their horrible surroundings.",,,
47,Pravin B.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,23,0,4.0,2/17/2009,Great happy hour!  The experience is soured if you have a waitress who is either (a) relatively unattractive or (b) relatively unfriendly....and the waitress factor is so important since the bar's only draw is these women are bikini-clad.  It's a mix of friendly gents and tough-guy wannabes who frequent this place.  It can get really crowded especially during happy hour.,,1,
48,Kristy G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,28,1,5.0,5/1/2008,great place .. i go to this place all the time .. happy hour drinks are $3 and bartenders in bikinis there is nothing better ... its not the most glamorous place to go .. but an after work bar indeed,,1,
