They have one of the best eggs Benedict I've had in the city and I try to always get it if it's on the menu some place else. I've tired the crabby Benedict, the San Paulo Benedict, the Florence benedict. Always delicious always satisfying. They give you a big plate too I usually can't finish the home fries that come with it. My only complaint is the delivery. The price difference is ridiculous your better off just going over there and picking up the food or just eating at the place itself. Well worth the trip!",,,

But I guess it wasn't good enough, because my bank statement shows a higher amount charged. Which is, you know, fraud.Point being, if paying by credit card, check your statement afterwards. Or better yet, just don't go there? The food is good but not THAT good.",,,

I ordered the French toast with fried eggs on the side and a slice of ham. My boyfriend got an omelette with ham, hash browns and a side of avocado. Everything was delicious, especially the moist and soft French toast! Very yummy. The waitress wasn't the greatest, she seemed a little frustrated with us and when we got up from our table, she noticed us and not even a ""goodbye, have a great day.""

I was having breakfast with my mother and boyfriend, and he decided to yell and humiliate the chefs right in front of all the customers eating! How rude and disrespectful. I feel as a manager YOU should have taken your employees somewhere else and spoke to them not talk DOWN ON THEM in front of everyone. At the end we were trying to approach the manager to let him know & he just dismissed my mother.

9,Andrew B.,"Cumberland, RI",16,74,0,2.0,4/24/2017,"The Hudson View offers diner-sized portions of disappointment. From the lack of a view to the quality of the dishes, they leave much to be desired.I've eaten here at least 3 times because it's a convenient and inexpensive restaurant near some family members. They maintain that there are a few worthwhile dishes, but none I've had would so qualify. From greasy and bland omelettes to greasy and bland homefries, few other adjectives suffice. I was not the only member of my group to have this experience.Yet the reason I give this restaurant two stars (instead of one) is that some people I trust say there are some worthwhile dishes, the chocolate cake looks good though I've never tried it, and the service is reasonably friendly and moderately expedient.I highly recommend Le Chéile down the street. It may sound much fancier or seem irksome to pronounce, but the restaurant offers a great brunch menu, good service, and reasonable prices.

One of the few places that delivers in the morning.Cons: A lot of the food is bland and uninspiring, and it is overpriced for what you get. I've had a few decent meals here but never a great one, no matter what I ordered. For similar prices you can order from other neighborhood establishments that use fresher ingredients and pack more flavor and care into their food.Overall: Standard diner fare, overpriced, food not terrible but also nothing special.",,,

The onion rings that came with the steak were soggy as if they put the food immediately into the container with no down time to release the grease. The turkey burger was supposed to come with ketchup and bbq sauce, but instead it came with NO sauce. I especially asked for no tomato bc I am allergic to them but low and behold, I open a container with GIANT tomatoes and soggy fries. Who puts fries in a container with wet veggies? Now I have to hope I don't die or throw the food away. And I spent almost $50 at their restaurant today. The driver must have wandered around before delivery because the food was cold.

With this order the mashed potatoes were completely unseasoned yuk! The cream of mushroom soup that came with the meal had little to no mushrooms and tasted like nothing more than a cup of flavorless cream. On the bright side, their breakfast is decent.

Almost an hour later, my delivery arrived: lukewarm omelette, coffee that is not hot, and NO toast. I can't imagine this diner being so busy at 10am on a Friday, that my food would be delivered cold and there would be no toast. Did I miss something? They are a diner. They are supposed to know that omelettes come with toast. All. The. Time. To make matters worse, I called again to ask for my toast to be delivered.

Updated review","I hate to do this - because I like a lot of things about this place. The location and ambiance are great and the service is generally excellent. It's easier to get to for us than most diners and we've eaten here a lot over the years.But the food really is pretty bad - and it's priced as though it should be pretty good. Generally in the past if we stuck to the simplest breakfast options, burgers, or soup of the day it was decent enough, but it's always been a mistake to order anything fancier, and lately even the breakfasts and burgers are kind of lousy. Food seems on the verge of stale - old grease - lukewarm soup - low quality burgers.It's just a shame - cause it could be an awesome diner with just a little bit of attention to quality, but as is I think I just ate my last meal there for a long time.Walk north to Vicky's - an excellent diner (though they close too early) - or go to the Bronx to Tibbet Diner, Riverdale, or even Land and Sea. All far superior to this.Hope they turn it around someday because I like the place and the people. Just not the food... :-(",1,,

35,Larah J.,"New York, NY",31,21,27,1.0,8/6/2015,"I give zero star to Hudson View Restaurant. The Yelp app doesn't let me so I have to give at least something. I'm sad to give a bad review to a local restaurant, but I have to. Today I went for lunch time. This what happened:1- I ordered a chicken pot pie. Later the lady waitress told me by mistake it was in the menu and that they don't have chicken pot pie. So I was ok with it so I ordered a Veggie Burger instead.2- When the veggie burger came to my table. I saw that had a weird texture and color, so before doing a big bit. I touched it with my fingers and tasted a bit of it OMG!! It was old and acid vegetables. THEY MADE THE VEGGIE PATTY WITH EXTREMELY OLD EXPIRED VEGETABLES!!! I don't know how the waitress knew already because she came to my table and she felt embarrassing and told me ""do you want to order something else instead. "" I already have gastritis if I was gonna eat this burger I could go to emergency room right away. With expired poisoning food :(3- So I ordered a chicken grilled sandwich to give it a 3rd chance now. Meanwhile the entire stuff was starting at me the cooker and the rest of the stuff  like they already knew that they are doing something wrong.4- The grilled chicken came with a burger bun instead the typical sandwich bread. Seems that they just replaced the veggie patty and put the grilled chicken on the same bread. Also the salad was not fresh. The way they cut the vegetables  of the salad looked like if they take old salad from previous customer meals. And put it to the next customer. :(5- when I left the the waitress was feeling so sad and embarrassing  for everything happened. So we talked I asked her "" what happened to this restaurant? before was so good and fresh food""I grew up in this neighborhood and I'm a totally a supporter of local food places. The waitress told me that she is new, and that many customers are telling her the same about the resultant, bad food.6- when I was talking to the waitress the owner got into our conversation. And I told him what just happened and he got mad at me. I asked him ""the chef is new? And he answered me in a bad attitude ""the same chef"" I don't think is the same chef when I was 4 years old.I come here with my grandma and my parents. And I just wanted to tell him to take care of his restaurant because our neighborhood is getting gentrified with new brand chain restaurants. And local (moms & pops) restaurants are getting kick out. If he doesn't change his mind soon his restaurant will have to close and to give that space to IHOP. 7- And last I'm sorry but I will never come back to this restaurant. I'm afraid that I can get sick with expired and used food. I'm going to warn all my friends and family members. Bye bye Hudson View Restaurant :(",9,,

Updated review",Food was amazing! Service not so much. We were brought to cups of water one which had something floating in the cup. We ordered two brunch combos. I love a good Mimosa so I was excited the combo came with a choice of two drinks Mimosas being one of them.  My other drink was a coffee the coffee was watered down and not fresh. The mimosa was t that great either. But then the food came!!! And yet there was hope. The food was absolutely amazing. The French toast was perfect! (Get the real maple syrup it's worth the other dollar fifty) The combo came with a option of meat or eggs. My girlfriend and I both went with eggs and ordered two sides of bacon. Not realizing the side of bacon was 6 pieces. We could have shared. But we are both. Don't judge us . Our mean came up to 47 which it totally was not worth. But hey that's apart of dining in New York!!,,,

I call them because they offer fresh-squeezed orange juice. But they have messed up my order repeatedly over the years. I usually call to let them know but do not require that someone come back to deliver orange juice or a side dish, especially in bad weather.This morning I ordered 3 scrambled eggs with cheddar and bacon, a short stack, orange juice, and a Pepsi. I received 2 scrambled eggs, but no bacon. The bill was $30.32. They charged $7.45 for the short stack! For two pancakes!!!!When I called and asked why they charged so much, the man told me that there's no short stack on the menu so they charged me for a full order of pancakes. I told him the woman who took my order did not tell me they don't offer short stacks. If she had, I would have told her forget that item. What made me angry is that the man argued with me as if I had made the error. After I became angry, he offered to give me a discount of $2.50 on my next order, which still makes it $5.45 for two pancakes! I told him I would not be ordering from there again.The food at Hudson View is adequate, not great, and is definitely not worth the exorbitant prices they charge. Delivery is convenient, but not if they routinely screw up the order, overcharge customers, and to make matters worse, argue with customers instead of admitting their errors. I'm done with Hudson View for good. Moving forward, I'll stick to VICKY'S DINER at 187th and Fort Washington -- reasonable prices, quick delivery, NO ORDER ERRORS.",4,,

But I could tell that by the speed he was devouring it he had pretty much no problems with it. I have to admit that once we had our food served to us I took a look at his sandwich and regretted getting an order so...well, plain. But that's the thing: it wasn't. The eggs were on point. The toast was on point (and for those who think it's impossible for diners to mess up toast...that probably means you haven't been to too many diners in the city). But man oh man, those home fries!!! I wouldn't be the first person here on Yelp to declare they've eaten at a lot of diners but in all seriousness this is one of the better ones when it comes to home fries.

I was somewhat correct in my assumption. Your basic burgers, sandwiches, and wraps served ""deluxe"" are decently priced to perhaps a hair overpriced. ($8 bucks for a burger with the works and fries? I can do that. $13 for a wrap? Not so much.) At least the menu IS expansive, with a full breakfast section and entrees galore.The burgers are tasty, the fries are solid, but the chocolate shake leaves a little bit to be desired, thickness-wise. There are some other item menus I will perhaps, one day, give a whirl.And, sadly, the Hudson River can NOT be seen from this establishment, despite the promising name.

Since this is one of the very few brunch options in Washington Heights, the boyfriend, a group of our friends, and I decided to check this one out. There was already a line (for brunch in Manhattan - what a surprise!) so we patiently waited. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes which is fine, but she ushered us in to seat us within five minutes. What was truly strange though is that they left us - a group of four - stranded in the middle of this tiny restaurant without a table. We stood awkwardly between an elderly couple and group of three friends enjoying their meals, awaiting to be seated. Two tables opened up but we were told we couldn't sit there because that was for a large group. Fifteen minutes went by and WE WERE STILL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS HECTIC, TINY RESTAURANT WITH NOWHERE TO SIT. I don't really care if I have to wait for brunch, but get your act together, management. The older male manager who seemed to be in charge was all but berating his employees and making a mess everywhere without remedying the problems that this restaurant was clearly suffering from.After twenty minutes of standing in the middle of the restaurant, we were told we could sit. We ordered our food, chatted with our very friendly server (who was great), and awaited our meals. We also noted, however, a man slump over and have a seizure at his table without any sort of medical intervention, a two-person table get moved seven times around the restaurant, and three separate vases of flowers get spilled.Our food was great, the portions plentiful and the prices affordable.

I'm usually pretty reasonable about food prices and go out to eat at nice places with probably over-expensive meals a couple times a month. This place just seems excessively expensive. The most basic things (eggs!) are overpriced and they charge you ($2+) to add even the most basic things on to your meal. They just charged me a 35 cent CONTAINER FEE on my last order...........The first few times I ordered from here, it didn't bother me as much as it does now.

Updated review","So I've reviewed this place in the past due to a nightmare experience ordering breakfast through seamless. But my friends insisted this place was great and I should try dining in. Well I just did and it didn't impress me. I decided to drop in for dinner. I ordered matzoh ball soup, and while the portion was generous, the matzoh ball disintegrated and was bland and tasteless. The soup needed a bunch of salt and pepper to taste halfway decent.I ordered the tuna pita for dinner which was described as tuna and melted American cheese in a pita. It came served with the bland, tasteless tuna served on TOP of an over-toasted pita (not in the pita as described) with a couple slices of American half-melted on top. American cheese melts very easily. The fact that I could see the outline of the individual slices says something... Not great. Won't be back again either for dine-in or ordering.",1,1,

Kitchen I assume is same, as they never care about personalized orders, there attitude seems to be - ""just take it and eat it (and DON'T enjoy it). They even have a busser, but morning servers do great/fair job.Lunch/Dinner - if you slightly care about yourself, DO NOT GO IN there. This is beyond just service problems.

105,Daniel P.,"New York, NY",7,8,6,5.0,3/17/2015,"There's nothing outwardly attractive about the restaurant; there's little attention given to atmosphere or decor. The food was delicious, and perfect for the brunch I was looking for, but, in all honesty, it is hard to mess up French toast, eggs, sausage, and bacon. What really stuck out about Hudson View was the excellent service. Though it was my first time in the restaurant I was greeted like a regular, given attentive and friendly check-ins, and treated to smiles all around by waitstaff that seemed genuinely happy to see me. I'll be returning to this diner.",,1,
106,Yelli M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,1.0,6/13/2014,Ordered breakfast from this place today. The French toast were horrible and salty. Eggs and sausages and ham seemed like they were cook in a microwave. The cinnamon raisin bagel was stale and you can taste it even though it was supposedly toasted. Extremely horrible! Food used to be ok but now just uneatable!!,3,,
107,Ryun H.,"New York, NY",39,13,3,2.0,11/9/2014,"Went there today with partner, who ordered a bowl of chicken matzo ball soup. When he told the waiter he wanted the chicken matzo ball soup after the waiter listed the soups, the waiter said, ""NO (he raised his voice when he said this), we have chicken noodle, vegetable, and (something, I forget). We also can put matzo ball in the chicken noodle."" Isn't that what my partner said, chicken soup with matzo ball? Anyway, I ordered the turkey sandwich. At $9 it was just bread, lettuce, and turkey. It came with a pickle and slaw. No tomatoes or anything - and turkey was cold. Not sure if it was supposed to be, but the bread was toasted so it was weird eating a cold turkey sandwich with warm bread. I didn't finish it because it was dry and bland.Partner's soup bowl had something caked on it and was way too salty, like something out of a can. He had it taken back, and didn't want it anymore. The waiter came back and said something along the lines of ""I am being honest with you, it was not dirty, that was from the soup, it dried on there from the top line."" Total lie, considering we couldn't scrape it off with our fingernails and it was below the top line of the soup - only after a few sips did we notice it. Even if it was from stock, it clearly wasn't from this batch of soup if it was caked on. The defensiveness he showed was aggravating. He took it off the menu, which we appreciate, but we ended up having to go somewhere else for food anyway. After tax and tip, I spent about $11 for a cold turkey sandwich that I didn't even want to finish. He also never even came by to ask us how it was, so we had to call someone else over to let them know about the soup bowl problem - and it was 3 PM, not that busy with all the staff there.I also saw the waiter shake his head a few times at us when he was on the other side of the restaurant after the soup issue, and heard another woman say, ""Can we get some service? Why is everyone here so grumpy?"" Maybe it was just an off day. Regardless, not a good experience and won't be back.",1,,

I love the waitstaff, especially the woman with short brown hair. She's the bomb. She tells it like it is, keeps the hot coffee coming and makes sure the order is how you asked for it.Again, this is by no means comparable with the Red Oak Diner in Fort Lee, NJ but it's the best diner we have up in the Heights and it's walking distance from home so if I can't travel across the GWB for a real diner experience then I'm coming here and I know what to expect.",,,

The staff is usually very relaxed and on-point, and they seem to get along well, which for me is always a plus in diners.The food is nothing out-of-this-world extraordinary based on my experience, but I have nothing negative to say about it. The french fries are always crispy and never too salty, and the dishes are always well-made with fresh ingredients. Their menu is pretty broad, which will certainly keep me coming back!I think their current health rating is still pending, but I wouldn't' be scared by the most recent one (which is a ""C"" from last November, preceded by an ""A"" from a year ago).

A fun activity to do here is to eavesdrop on conversations the little old ladies are having. It's pretty easy, since they're shouting at one another.

Updated review","Went with a friend to get Brunch. I got a regular menu but it didn't have the Brunch menu inside, which I didn't find out until after I ordered. Waited about 1/2 hour and noticed the people around us being served. They also got eggs and I noticed that their omelettes were a dark brown meaning they were way overcooked. Our waitress came over and apologized for the delay. Another 15 minutes and out food arrived. It was an omelette and a chicken wrap. Not sure why that took 45 minutes. I took a bite of my eggs and they were ice cold. My friend noticed the cheese on the omelette was crusty meaning it had been sitting for a while. We called the waitress over, she apologized and went to get fresh food. Then I waited 20 minutes for a new omelette. This place has really gotten ridiculous. At least my new food wasn't burned. I felt bad for the waitress because she was very nice but they have crap kitchen staff - and the manager/owner, even being told what was happening by the waitress, didn't bother to come over and apologize. I said it before, I will never go back there. Now, not even for breakfast. Why can't we get a decent diner there? It is a great place for one to open.",,,

The dish comes with roasted potatoes side which is rather bland, but really couldn't care less, since eggs are so filling, I have no room for potatoes left anyway. Their fresh-squeezed juices are always absolutely delicious, and sangria is pretty darn tasty as well. I wonder though why the place is called Hudson View!

When this new placed opened the hood got excited. Immediate popularity because of the location. The food is decent and the menu keeps on going for days.  The lack off two stars is owed to the crowded feeling I get when this place is busy not to mention the STROLLER moms. Somehow the UWS screaming children and aloof parent have migrated to this place. Since the place is so small it feels like you are at arms length to slap the parent into some sense.  The waitstaff is effeciant and the place looks clean.

They yell at the wait staff in front of the customers, which is extremely embarrassing, and in poor taste. He hires new wait and kitchen staff and does not train them and as a result, the food quality and service have suffered.The past three times that I have gone: (1) my English muffin was brought to my table burnt (Crabby Benedict) and I had to say something before the waiter replaced it, (2) ordered a dish that I order all the time and the waiter without asking anyone told me that they do not make that dish (3) our waitress overcharged us for our meal and then told us she was new and does not know how to place orders in the computer (4) we ordered our meal and it appears the waitress forgot to send the order to the kitchen and we waited 45 minutes for pancakes and eggs and the owner did not even acknowledge that there was a problem or even try to apologize.I am never going back to this diner.",,,

The challah french toast is wonderful as are the banana walnut pancakes.  I also often order egg-white omelettes which are cooked to perfection.  Even though they are always packed on the weekends, the service is very prompt and friendly.  They also serve breakfast all day long which is a plus for someone who wakes up late or enjoys eating pancakes at 8pm :)I've also been there for pie and milkshakes and I thought that their chocolate milkshake was amazing!",,,

165,Phillip D.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",107,33,16,3.0,8/9/2008,"It's good to have a new, clean restaurant in the neighborhood, especially since it fills in the void left by the aging and apparently filthy, since it was closed by the city health authorities, Hilltop Restaurant.at the corner of Ft. Washington Avenue and 181st Street.I stopped by for dinner with a friend a week after they opened (July, 2008) and had the Saturday night special: Yankee pot roast, served with sweet and sour red cabbage, two potato pancakes, and a choice of soup or salad. The meat was so-so, but the potato pancakes were fat and delicious, all the more so when the waitress brought the side of apple sauce I asked for. They also brought a bread basket when we first sat down (a variety of white and pumpernickel dinner rolls, melba toasts, bread sticks) -- and refilled it halfway through the meal -- so the meal was more than enough food.My friend had a multicolored pasta dish, which he seemed happy with, although we didn't really talk about it.I went back for breakfast a few days later and had two eggs, over medium, with turkey bacon. It also came with buttered toast, masculun greens (what better way to get your recommended daily vegetables than having a salad with breakfast?) and potatoes. Everything was delivered as I ordered it. Standard diner fare.In addition to the phone number in the business info, their take-away menu also lists (212) 781-0322, and their fax number is (212) 781-0301. ""Free fast delivery and catering available"" it says, but I haven't tried yet.Here's a sample of what they offer:Burgers range from $5.45, for the regular jumbo beefburger, to $14.15, for the deluxe Hudson View burger (twin patties with bacon and cheddar). Regular here, as at many other diners, means no lettuce, tomato, or fries.A variety of hot and cold sandwiches including deli standards, Philly cheese steak, a reuben, several configurations of grilled cheese, triple-decker club, pitas, and wraps. These range from about $5.10 (BLT) to $11.70 (Hudson View club with grilled chicken, roasted peppers, lettuce, tomato, and fresh mozzarella).There are quite a few salads to choose from such as Nicoise, Greek, and cobb. These run about $10-12.They also advertise fresh seafood ($20s), Mediterranean dishes ($12-16), steak, meatloaf, and other hot American entrees.For dessert: rice pudding ($3.60), shakes (about $4, but NO MALT unfortunately), and banana split ($6.80), among others.A sit-down breakfast will set you back $7-9, although their egg sandwiches run about $4-5.The one thing I don't like about this restaurant is this: the bottom of the menu says ""MINIMUM CHARGE per PERSON 7.95."" For a new business that ought to want as many customers as it can get, this is presumptuous. And it forecloses on my hope of dropping by for a quick sit-down deli sandwich. I issue a demerit for this inhospitality and deduct one star.But on the whole, the food is decent, the place is CLEAN, and it's conveniently located. About what you would hope for in a neighborhood diner.",3,,1

The order was delivered within the estimated time, the deliverer was polite and professional, and the food was just as advertised. However, for the money spent I expected a bit more. The burger patty wasn't as juicy as say a patty from Shake Shack, and the side of cheese fries looked and tasted like they had been microwaved.

176,William A.,"New York, NY",4,14,0,3.0,8/27/2008,"Their breakfast is a good value.  A little over priced, but you definitely get a lot of food for your dollar. I had the typical eggs, bacon and fries. I asked for the bacon to be crispy, and it only came out a little crispy. Why can't bacon always be crispy? Do people really like rubbery bacon, I don't think so. To counter act that negative, their fresh squeezed OJ is awesome. You get a small glass with your M-F meal, otherwise a large glass sets you back about 5 bucks. Not a good value.I went back a few days later, and tried their French toast. Yummy, nice and thick and filling. And you can get some bacon with your French toast for a dollar. Not a bad deal if you can get your bacon crispy. Hudson View's saving grace is their coffee. Strong and constantly flowing into your cup. That deserves a star. All right I was impressed, but living in this neighborhood, it is easy to be impressed with mediocre food. I went only for breakfast, so I'm not sure what dinner has to offer. The menu is pretty extensive, and there are plenty of specials on the board.",,,

I had their yankee pot roast delivered last night and was pleasantly surprised how good it was.The sauce that the meat was cooked in was very flavorful! The two plump potato pancakes and red cabbage this dish came with were very satisfying. It also came with a large soup (choice of chicken noodle or cream of turkey) and homemade  dinner rolls.

The florentine wrapper is almost good except for the fact that the chicken has no flavor or salt whatsoever.  The Santorini wrapper is better due to the tzatziki sauce.  The chicken fingers have no flavor whatsoever, once again.  I piled salt on them and still nothing.  I guess it'll do whenever you just want some greasy diner food but I really wish they'd improve their marinating skills a bit.",,1,
