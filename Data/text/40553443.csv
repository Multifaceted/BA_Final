1,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",58,132,516,3.0,11/18/2018,"Centrally located right across the street from the one train Franklin Street stop in Tribeca is Distilled. It's a cute spot and full of potential. First encounter is the amazing hostess (I forgot to catch her name. The tall fashionable blonde). She's full of life & has a contagious smile - 5 Stars!Came for brunch with a rather large group. I was told for parties my size a credit card is required to hold the reservation - why? (You're not busy). Our starter waitress was Rose - 5 stars. She checked on the table, was attentive, gave us time, plus made drink suggestions. Second waitress Kori - for starters she gave the table attitude. Never checked on us, didn't even make sure the order came out correct, and pulled the biggest attitude when it was time for payment because we handed over credit cards.  Due to the fact she added the twenty percent gratuity to our check, she felt that our table did not require servicing.  Had that twenty percent not been added I can bet a dollar to a doughnut our table would have received proper service and attention to our order details. Manager Marcus - hat's off to you and 5 stars. You really tried to remedy every situation with a kind and welcoming smile the entire time. Thank you for accommodating our group and going the extra mile. Overall our table enjoyed our meals and the chicken and waffles seemed to be the star at the table. I would recommend more uniform presentation. Hot food means hot plates, and hot syrup (not cold), and making sure the chicken is cooked through. I would also suggest updating your website as the menus and offerings are no longer available.  The open kitchen concept is also really cool. However, when you're looking at your food plated and up - it concerns one when said waitress is not in sight. I would recommend Distilled to others due to location, and hope you work the kinks out. Wishing you the best & improved success.",,,

3,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,8/27/2018,I randomly stopped by for a quick meal and drink. It was empty during Saturday brunch and we were seated immediately. The service was great.I had the avocado toast which came smaller than I expected. It was good but not the best. The avocado was more sour than I would've liked. The impressive toppings were purely just for aesthetics and did not enhance flavor. Not worth $18. Their drinks were perfect and strong. I loved that they used paper straws. No free popcorn was offered but I will be returning for a second try!,2,,3
4,Thea Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",233,149,1196,2.0,8/21/2018,"Holy let down people! A good friend and trusted foodie insisted that we head here on my birthday for brunch. Gosh do I wish I was in charge of the restaurant choice that day. Food was just ok, service was laughable, as in bad romance comedy stuff, and babies were crying and screaming to the right and left of me. I won't be back and hope to spare you the experience as well. Food: I'll give them this. Their wings are stellar. Big and juicy with robust flavor and maytag blue cheese sauce. Oh yeah. Also had the burratta, nothing special, but nice. I ordered the avocado toast with a side of bacon. Yeah I know how millennial of me. What came out made me think there was a hidden camera and I was on film. It was literally just a plate of avocado (see photos) accompanied by the most awfully salty bacon I've ever had, so bad I sent it back. And I NEVER send back bacon for goodness sake. No one else was impressed by their meals wether it was the steak and eggs or the shakshuka. Ambiance: Despite the screaming kids, which they really cant help, there wasn't much to offer. All tables are high top in the main area which is very bar sceney. Music is super random. And the wait staff wandering around lost made me feel a little weird. Service: Holy hell what a mess. While everyone was SUPER nice, no one knew what was going on. I watched a dude wander to 4 different tables to try to deliver juice. The bar runner came over, spilled a ton of my friend's mimosa, and then just tried to walk away like it didn't happen. I asked to switch an app plate out because it was dirty and they never brought me a new one. We asked for a refill on coffee and they said they had to brew more, but then another server went right over and refilled the pot for another table. They didn't have their signature popcorn and stated that they ran out... cmon it was Sunday and they just opened. I jokingly offered to run to the whole foods next door to pick up some kernels for them. There's more, but we would be here for a long while. It was comical yes, but definitely not impressive. So in short, j/k this is already long. Don't do it. So many other brunch places. Go there.",3,2,1
5,Nataliya M.,"Brooklyn, NY",282,69,300,5.0,8/19/2018,"While hanging out in TriBeCa on a rainy Saturday night and browsing Yelp at a bar nearby, my boyfriend and I decided on Distilled as our dinner date option. We took over a large booth right by the open kitchen, armed ourselves with rosé ciders and dove into what turned out to be a delicious dinner to the last crumb.The complimentary popcorn covered in ""magic dust"" blend of spices is addicting, and I already know that I'll be attempting to remake it as a football game snack this fall. Go Jags! The Charcuterie Trio consisted of duck/pork terrine (very strong taste of cloves), Whipped Foie Gras (best out of three and tasted like creamy foie gras butter), and duck mousse. Candied walnuts, toasted bread, grain mustard and pickled red onions came with the trio and paired well with all three meat items. Malfatti entree of ground lamb, caramelized onions, peas, tender ricotta gnocchi, and arugula sautéed was a dangerously delicious, comforting dish.Swanky dark interior, jazzy music, adventurous and refreshingly new takes on dishes, and surprisingly knowledgeable staff. I would recommend this place to not just to others, but also to dear friends. Better yet - I would return here myself.",1,1,1
6,Jeanine Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",262,204,635,4.0,10/3/2018,"I came to Distilled with a friend for brunch. We got a deal on Gilt City that included the chef's menu, which was three courses and two drinks per person. We really enjoyed the cocktails. We ordered one with vodka and cucumber and it was really nice and refreshing. We started off with a salad. It had watermelon, cucumbers, sunflower seeds among some other things. For the second course, we had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was delicious and besides the syrup, there was hot sauce which I really liked. For the desserts, we shared the ricotta cheesecake and the chocolate mousse. Both were relatively light and delicious. Overall, we enjoyed the food and I would definitely return.",3,,2
7,Christina P.,"Manhattan, NY",6,41,26,2.0,10/6/2018,Came here today for brunch as it looked to have great reviews. Both my husband and I ordered the chicken and waffles. The presentation was fabulous but unfortunately my chicken was not cooked completely. The waffle was delicious and eaten to its entirely but I was not satisfied with the chicken. I did let the server know who was very nice and did offer me another chicken which I refused as my appetite was already ruined. They did comp the chicken for me which was really nice. Looks like a cool place to come from drinks but I would not come back for the food.,2,,1
8,STEVE B.,"Mansfield, TX",54,73,123,5.0,8/4/2018,"Loved our Saturday meal on the outside deck with the sights and sounds of Manhattan rolling by.Great selection of brunch items and cool specialty drinks.  We especially liked the Eggs Florentine, the BBQ wings and the chicken & waffles.Friendly crew, spacious and open on the inside.Great spot!",,,

We had the cheese plate, which was super yummy especially with the honey comb. I had the rolled pasta with the summer squash. It was beyond amazing & only wish I could recreate it at home.  Husband had the chicken & once again really enjoyed it!  Service was great & made recommendations for my vegetarian lifestyle. Can't wait to come back!",,,
10,Stephanie K.,"New York, NY",16,98,210,5.0,5/30/2018,"I just had a great meal here last night! The food was delicious, the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors, and our waitress was knowledgeable and attentive.The location is fun--very easy spot to get to in TriBeCa and always fun people watching. Considering the location, the prices were very reasonable. My friend and I decided to do the 5 course chefs choice tasting menu and we were so happy we did! They are very accommodating and will take into account any food allergies or preferences you have. Additionally, unlike some tasting menus I have done, this one leaves your very full and satisfied at the end. These are not tiny dishes.Our first course was a beet and ricotta salad with mint--outstanding. Flavor was on point and I finished the whole thing. Second was avocado toasts -- very good, but didn't exactly blow me away (but that's hard to do considering the prevalence of avocado toast in nyc). Third was cacio e pepe. This was probably my least favorite, only because I'm not a huge pasta fan and I didn't think it really fit with the rest of the meal. But, the flavor was very good.  Fourth was the main event--duck buns!! So so good. We had asked if the chef could make these for us because we saw the duck on the main menu, and we were so grateful he did. Flavor is just amazing and the buns were so soft and sweet.Dessert was a bit disappointing--just chocolate chip cookies. They were very good chocolate chip cookies, but if they had added some ice cream or something, I think that would have made it stand out more.Overall, amazing meal. Will definitely return.",,,
11,Shelby W.,"Washington, DC",135,149,159,5.0,4/21/2018,We were supposed to meet friends here for cocktails ahead of dinner reservations in the area.  As we arrived our friends were outside and we stopped across the street since the restaurant wasn't opened quite yet.  The staff saw our friends outside and apologized that they weren't open for just yet and proceeded to give them a comp card for when we came back later...great service on their part.  Their cocktail list is fun and I can't remember the name of the drink but it had a rosemary salt rim and was to die for.  We tried the tots and they were different than what we were used to but still really good.  The bartender provided great service.  We will certainly be back when we visit the area again.,1,,
12,Subhasree G.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,14,5,4.0,9/29/2018,"Good place to eat!! Their menu went  through a change last week which I guess is for good. Do not forget to try their Summer Lake Salad. I can guarantee that you will fall in love with it. The ricotta cheese dollops will blow your mind.The sea bass at first felt a little under seasoned at first but it actually went beautifully when combined with the sauce and grilled cherry tomatoes. The steak was alright. Try their cheesecake with lemon sorbet, it's nice. In the evening, the place is quite crowded inside why we asked for a seating outside. It felt nice , and the waiter was quite nice. He always checked on us to see how we were doing. Food is Manhattan pricey!! Almost 22-29$ for an entree, 15$ for cocktails and 10$ for dessert. Hope that was of some help!! Enjoy.",2,,

I also heard the drinks are really good here but we stuck to coffee. We both ordered a salad for the first course - refreshing. I ordered the avocado toast - delish! My fried chicken and waffles. We shared both dessert and options and they were both great. They also give complimentary popcorn which is really yummy. Would definitely come here again to try the other food.",,1,

Loved their house made ketchup that came with the fries, nice touch. Ambiance is, nice enough for a date, but casual enough to hangout with a group of friends after work. I'll for sure be back. One star off for my cocktail which was wayyyy to sweet, might have just picked the wrong one for my personal taste but I think in the future I will stick to beer here.",,,
15,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",75,143,82,4.0,8/8/2018,"Come here for the truffle pasta and stay for the drinks! Granted the AC was out when we went (they really need to get that fixed!) but the staff were cheerful and helpful regardless. We actually went here after doing a tour of Farm One downtown where we were told that Distilled uses their plants in some of their dishes. Sure enough my cocktail was garnished with a Farm One flower and I loved it. Plus the truffle pasta was so rich and tasty! It comes in the perfect portion with a poached egg on top. The only drawback here was the oysters, which had bits of shells in nearly every one. Please shuck them better next time! Overall though still a great experience!",,,
16,Michael C.,"Brooklyn, NY",67,612,5,3.0,9/24/2018,Not easy to review.  Great location/atmosphere.  I had perhaps the best Old Fashioned of my life...actually I had 3 of them.  But the food?  Great Korean Wings.  Everything else paled.

17,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,4.0,1/7/2018,"Had my birthday Sunday brunch at Distilled. My group of seven people was seated comfortably in our own little space by the window, and reservation was easy to make. Ambiance: so nice inside, not as energetic or vibrant as other brunch places in the city, probably because of the weather, and also not their fault, but that made it quiet enough for conversation with my friends. Decor is very simple, classic, a la Americana public house. Service: flexible with reservation, attentive and quick with taking orders and bringing food, and refilled coffee when asked. We sat there for a couple of hours after we paid and just talked and no one said a word or rushed us out the door. Mad grateful for that. Food: creative menu, delicious items, fresh and filling portions. Complimentary popcorn was dangerously addictive. I had the cheese and mushroom enchilada and absolutely loved it, but it was quite salty. Friends got the duck and waffles, smoked salmon scramble, and the French toast waffles. Coffee was delicious too. They also brought a great little chocolate dessert to sing me ""happy birthday"" with. Distilled was everything I wanted and I'd recommend for a chill brunch outing.",4,3,5
18,Raj A.,"New York, NY",9,33,0,2.0,9/21/2018,"Service was terrible. So bad that it ruined the night.Came in for dinner and a Gilt voucher for drinks, but it took 15 mins to get attention from a server when we sat down and the most neglectful service I've had in a long time.The excuse that the bar is busy or there's a lot of people is not an excuse on a Friday night. Y'all should know and staff better. Won't be recommending anyone come here for their over priced menu.",1,,
19,rich c.,"Princeton, NJ",22,61,14,3.0,8/2/2018,"Not sure if this was the norm but the a/c was out. Food was pretty decent and generous. Everyone seemed to be having the wings and so one would have to start with that, of course. Quite tasty with a. Little bit of a kick. Sauce reminds me of a cross between Peking pork chops and orange chicken. No, not the texture or anything bad but that is what it reminded me of. Had the mushroom fettuccine and my better half had the black bass. Again, very tasty although mine could have been seasoned just a little bit more to enhance the flavor. I think a touch more salt and/or shaving the Parmesan instead of grating it... or maybe even a pecorino instead. Was on the fence for a fourth star but the a/c kinda killed the atmosphere a little. By the way, if your a/c is out... serve ICE water instead....",,,
20,S W.,"New York, NY",434,40,12,3.0,9/27/2018,"The food is just okay. Nothing too special or memorable.I had the tuna tartar appetizer was decent. It didn't taste super fresh, not sure if it's because it was late in the day? For the main dish I had fish.  It was just okay.",,,
21,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",875,1144,813,4.0,6/2/2018,"I made a reservation here for Sunday brunch to celebrate my graduation and it was a quick online process. In addition, they called the day before to confirm. When we arrived, we were seated quickly in a corner booth.The brunch menu is a mix of typical American brunch fare. I got the West Broadway Burger and we ordered a flight of the slushies to share. There was a bit of a snafu with the sides as my friend and I both ordered the burger with a side of fries but ended up getting one with fries and one with a salad. However, our waitress was quick to fix it with an additional side of fries for the table! The popcorn was tasty - mostly because of their house spices - and I think as a table we had about a bowl and a half. You can definitely eat your share and get as many refills as you want though! The burger was decent but nothing really stood out about it. Even when I think about it now, I can't really recall anything unique about the burger. I did like that the fries were cut into large chunks - I think it helps keep in a bit of the moisture and prevents them from becoming too dry and crispy. Drinks were poured with a heavy hand which would have been nice if I had been dining with a large group of my friends, but since my family doesn't imbibe frequently we had a tough time finishing everything! They were definitely some well mixed drinks though! I would say Distilled is a good brunch option if you are in the area, particularly if you aren't able to get reservations at some of the more hyped up restaurants. It was also easy to make a (close to) last minute reservation for a large(ish) party!",2,,1
22,Meghan M.,"New York, NY",230,37,52,1.0,1/21/2018,"I'm not one to write poor reviews, and Distilled would have been a five star for me, but it gave my friend and I food poisoning. We ordered some drinks- the Bloody Mary which was great- and then a bourbon. The waitress was bubbly and friendly. For food, we split the salmon scramble (obviously the food poisoning culprit) as well as the salad which was fresh and crisp. However, after spending $80 on a breakfast, even if it was enjoyable, nothing is worth spending the rest of the day miserable and sick. Womp.",,1,
23,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",121,353,373,4.0,6/20/2018,Great place. I enjoyed their cocktail creations and appetizer service.

24,Nick M.,"Dallas, TX",290,149,464,4.0,11/11/2017,"Very nice food in a fun neighborhood. I came in during a business trip on a Monday and the place was pretty much dead; that being said, though, I had an excellent bourbon cocktail and the duck and waffles. The dish was a really nice play on chicken and waffles that maintained its own identity and let the duck shine through... paired very well with the texture of the waffle for overall great mouthfeel. The dark horse of the entire meal was the free pretzel! Actually SUPER good, especially with the mustard they paired it with.I, like everyone else, recommend the popcorn. Super yummy and satisfying, though I will say I enjoyed the pretzel more but it's just cause it was that good!Would definitely come back, hopefully when it's warm enough to dine on the patio :)",1,,

Pros: AMAZING employees, THEE BEST wings I've EVER had (and I travel to places just to try the wings), location, interior, a diverse group of customers, and on a late Saturday night they had some good jams playing. Con: Its a little pricey (but I guess it is Manhattan) and the ""Dinner"" menu SEEMED limited to me but they had the basics. Overall, great place I DEFINITELY recommend stopping here and I will returning with more friends from the DC area! :-) P.S. I wish I could remember our waiters name he was I guess the only waiter (it wasn't too packed) and we never felt like we were waiting. Also, the hostess is a rockstar! We were low on battery and she took our phone by request and charged them. We had a little hiccup with our food but the chef wasted no time in correcting it... he's awesome too!

Maybe dinner or drinks would have been a better experience, especially if they actually have all the items on the menu.Negatives:- They ran out of the famous 'magic dust' popcorn that we were looking forward to.- They also ran out of the fluke crudo which was one of the 3 options for 1st course of Restaurant Week brunch- Avocado toast (2nd/main course option for Restaurant Week brunch) portion was tiny with small pieces of toast and hardly any avocado. This small portion is not sufficient for a main course. The fried chicken & waffles and eggs florentine were normal portions though.- Panna cotta dessert texture was too jelly-like rather than creamy. Also it didn't include the lemon poppy cookie as advertised.Positives:- The fried chicken & waffles (2nd/main course) was great! Brown meat (which I prefer) was juicy and tender, crispy skin chicken, with hot sauce and maple syrup. Waffle was also pretty good.- Service was good, the waiter offered to give us separate bills without us asking which is uncommon and a nice touch.",1,,

Had an old fashioned or two - nice + strong. I would go back for that popcorn alone. I was told the seasoning is called crack :P The windows are huge and the view is great - adds to the charm of the place. One thing to note - there was no AC! I'm seeing other reviews where there was also no AC - so I think for that reason alone, I would def not return in the summer. Otherwise, I would go if I was in the area.",,,
33,Carina F.,"Manhattan, NY",301,147,195,3.0,2/18/2018,"The bf made Restaurant Week rezzies on a Monday night, only to find out that they were really unnecessary. Their vibe was super chill and there weren't many people at all. We were seated on a high top table facing the bar and TV. Pretty leather lounge seating adorn most of this venue, and while we were originally given their regular menu, they brought out the RW menu upon request. We even doubted ourselves for a second thinking we went to the wrong restaurant (maybe we made rezzies for The Distillery?) but glad to find out we were at the right place. I'm a fan of their slushies, I ordered the Tennessee Mule and found it sweet but refreshing. For my 3 course meal, I ordered the salad (which was a meal on its own- gigantic portions) with the tagliatelle- absolutely a fan, portions were small but I enjoyed that it was made slightly spicy too; pasta was served perfectly al dente. Disappointed that their lavender dessert was sold out, so had to settle for the chocolate mousse topped with cool-whip: meh. Boyfriend loved his hearty selection: app- pate, entree- fried duck and waffle, and his pecan pie. I actually swapped desserts with him midway bc his pecan pie was so delish. Enjoyed the music- remix of 80s tunes with old school rnb and modern day pop. Servers were the sweetest. We saw someones child at a table so I imagine kids are welcome. Its a bit out of the way for us so I doubt I would come back. It was a solid experience though.",1,,2

Just thought it was an odd reaction but didn't think much of it and ignored that. Then she continues to say that the kitchen was not open yet and we were seated at the bar when there were plenty of empty tables...and people that walked in right after us were seated immediately at the tables.

I switched to Prosecco after my first (I know old habits die hard!)To eat, they do start you off with complementary popcorn (with ""magic dust"" as they say - by the way 1) delicious and 2) it is popcorn topped with nutritional yeast, chili, ginger powder et all) - which is quite good.

There are super friendly (and helpful) bartenders, and it was such a nice gesture for the restaurant to bring my friend a piece of cake, as we were also out celebrating her birthday. There were some drink specials on the Saturday afternoon we visited, and their signature slushies are a must-try. Especially the Spiked Pink Lemonade. However, be careful. It will sneak up on you; not that I'm speaking from experience or anything. :-)",,,

Initially sat at the bar with a friend and received complimentary seasoned popcorn as well as a mixed shot (which the bartenders took with us and two other guests). I opted for a glass of cabernet sauvignon, which I really liked.Once our other friend arrived, we moved to a dark wood high-top table closer to the back, which was relatively spacious. After chatting for a bit, the bartender came by to let us know it was last call. We decided to close out our tab, but 15 minutes later, I decided to get another glass of wine, and the bartender was nice enough to oblige even though he was already closing out and filing receipts.As the place was shutting down and the lights were coming on, we continued to chat and loiter. Instead of asking us to leave, the bartender came over with more free shots (this time rye) and thanked us for closing the place out with him. He then gave us recommendations for bars nearby that were still open.While I can't comment on the cocktails and food, I really liked the atmosphere of this place and the bartenders were some of the most hospitable I've encountered in NYC. Would definitely return for a drink with friends.",1,,

And like magic - everything changed after our order was placed.  New people started arriving and several tables around us, which were once vacant, now became occupied.  Orders were placed for those tables and food was brought promptly to them while my table waited over an hour and a half for food. I was with a party of 7 people and other tables were comparable in size. It appeared that the Distilled staff completely forgot about us. When the food finally came, it was good but the entire group had a sour taste in their mouths.

We both really enjoyed the slushies! My favorite was the frozen lemonade.  My only issue with this place was the service. It was really just okay. Our server was friendly but she kind of came and went, it took a while for our drinks to come out, and our water glasses were constantly empty.

Perhaps they were running low, so decided to thin it out to stretch out how many orders they could get out before making a new batch.  The wings themselves were crunchy,  but seemed to have a slight ""gamey"" smell and the flesh a bit tough.

The bar area is nice and spacious and you can also request a table for larger groups. It's never too loud and you won't have to scream at the top of your lungs for your friends to hear you.We usually head straight for the bar at the beginning of happy hour. It doesn't get too packed until about 3 hours into happy hour. The popcorn here is to die for and I'm pretty sure the bartenders think I'm here for the popcorn (with a side of alcohol).Every single one of the bartenders are so wonderful and so pleasant. After a long day, their friendliness (and bartending skills, of course) really make my day. I love Frank especially because he never let's my cup go empty. Ask him for some dad jokes cause he's great at them. He always keeps us entertained. We held a small event here at the servers were so attentive.We've gotten the wings before and they were absolutely delicious and only made the night better.

51,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,4.0,4/19/2017,"I think I first tried Distilled about a year ago and came specifically for their famous wings, which admittedly I wasn't thrilled with. And I thought if I wasn't feeling the thing they were famous for odds were I wouldn't feel the rest of their menu either, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy I gave them another shot. First off, they have the best free popcorn I've ever had. They put a spice mix on it called Magic Dust and man does it jazz up ordinary popcorn. Their spicy cocktails are also on point.Their rib appetizer is tender, with a delicious sauce that's low on vinegar without being overly sweet, perfect balance. But the real reason I'm writing this review, the amazing orgasmic thing you should come here for, is the Duxelle & Toast. Don't worry about saying it right, point if you have to, just go it. It's an herbed mushroom spread, served with whipped honey with a slight char on top, and oiled, herbed, crunchy bread. Pickled red onions and fresh herbs accompany it and should be included on each and every bite. The picture does not do justice to how this dish tastes. And for just $13, its actually hearty enough to fill you up (especially if supplemented with some of that popcorn). It's got everything: sweet, savory, bright, earthy, creamy, whipped, crunchy. This just might be my new favorite thing. Service was also super friendly! And they have outdoor seating, great option in the area.",4,,1
52,Jennifer C.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,10/1/2018,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We had high expectations after looking at the website but it's nothing more than an overpriced sports bar with appalling service and mediocre food. Although the bar was moderately busy, the dining area was empty apart from us and one other couple (on a Saturday evening - that should have been a sign for us to just leave) and completely lacked atmosphere - all the tables in the bar had candles but in the dining area none of the candles were lit. They made no effort and it felt a bit like we were sat in the naughty corner. The waitress started off by telling us the bar was slammed (it didn't seem overly busy for a Saturday evening) and therefore we'd have a long wait for drinks if we wanted anything other than water to drink. We ordered the charcuterie to start. It was ok although the fois gras was over-seasoned and almost inedible. It only came with four small pieces of toast (burnt on one side, not toasted at all on the other) which wasn't enough for the amount of terrine. We asked for additional bread, which it turns out we were charged for. Out of courtesy, the waitress should have at least told us that there would be an additional charge.We waited almost an hour for our main courses. No one checked on us or apologised for the wait. There seemed to be only one waitress for the bar, restaurant and outside areas. I had the truffle pasta dish, which was the smallest main pasta dish I've ever seen for $26, lukewarm and bland. My husband had the duck and a side of roasted cauliflower. The duck skin and fat had not been properly rendered, making it very unappetising. The cauliflower was more charred than roasted. We've never complained about food in a restaurant when asked how everything was but this time we did. The waitress went off to speak to her manager and came back and said ""I can get these out of the way if you aren't going to eat them"" in a very passive aggressive tone. At this point it was almost 10pm and we ate what we could so we could get out of there. After we'd complained about the food no one came to check on us for the rest of the night. They weren't particularly busy and I would have expected the manager to come and speak to us. In the end, my husband had to go up to the hostess to request the bill because we were being ignored by the other staff. An unforgettable experience but not in a good way. They need to improve the service and the quality of the food.",,,

60,Kyra H.,"Bowie, MD",156,81,90,2.0,8/11/2018,"I was so enthused when while in TriBeCa I came across a restaurant with almost five stars, what appeared to be from the pictures good food and of course cocktails for days. I am not sure how this place got the stars it received. I decided to do the 3 course summer restaurant week meal which although excited about was a total flop. I ordered the pretzel grilled cheese for my first course which includes 3 mini sliders. The sliders have what appeared to be some type of cream cheese, a little piece of bacon and a pretzel bun that was quite hard, too thick for the portion, and lacked the pinch of salt and butter that typically makes a great pretzel. Also while cold I feel if this dish was served with a thinner pretzel bun, a stringy, gooey cheese (preferably fresh mozzarella) and a crunch piece of bacon it would be a home run. For my 2nd course I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle...:YEAH. Super stoked I asked the waiter if the chicken was white meat and she confirmed it was a chicken breast. Imagine my let down when I cut open the chicken to reveal greasy, fatty, chicken thigh. I asked the waiter about this to which she replied her bad she thought they had chicken breasts but the chef said NO. I wish I had known this earlier. I was then asked if I wanted another meal off the restaurant week menu to which I responded no thank you I'll just drink. She said I would have to pay for the first course and I said that is fine, which to me should have been wiped clean but what do I know I guess business is business. I was given more popcorn which is complimentary and went well with my mimosas. All in all I would not come back as it left much to be desired including the $9 fries. I will say the house made hot sauce was great. My suggestion would be for the distilled wigs to accompany the waffle since they are ranked so high. After trying the distilled wings and in the words of my husband the wings didn't blow him away. The sauce is a soy, brown sugar bourbon based sauce and the wings are a little to big to be a flavorful deep fried seasoned wing. Deep fried yes, seasoned perfectly....NO",,,

They are really accommodating to any allergies or specific diets you request. I'd suggest it if you want something different with someone choosing your entrees. I don't think I would ever order it again as I thought it would offer more ""off the menu"" entrees or appetizers but it had everything available on the menu and one dish that was different. Next time I'll just come during happy hour for some drinks, wings, and popcorn to snack on.Food: Popcorn is a different twist then getting bread as a snack. It's not your regular popcorn and has a unique cumin flavor! They started Kobucha squash soup which I highly suggest for something light and flavorful. Our second dish was the wings and these are phenomenal, quite hefty so the 2 they gave was a perfect amount. I'd suggest these as an app or if you come for some snacks and a drink. Our third dish was their one ""surprise"" off the menu dish and the pasta was not as impressive as I imagined it to be. The dish was very salty and difficult to eat. The only part I really enjoyed was the poached egg it came with. My main dish was the bone in pork chop which I enjoyed for the hint of apple flavoring. Our last dish was a chocolate cake which was good but much like any other chocolate cake.Drinks: Ordered the Dram Betty and I'll definitely order it again! Great cocktail that's very refreshing with the cucumber flavor! Ambience/Service: The server was very nice and explained each dish throughly.

I decided to order delivery on a Tuesday night as I like to try some of the more popular 'chicken wing' joints every time I am in town. Despite some frustrating experiences with delivery platforms, which I won't hold against Distilled, I was still very disappointed.I of course tried the 6 Distilled wings, which were, OK. I've had many similar versions, and was expecting more here... and although I typically order bleu cheese with buffalo wings, they didn't seem to pair properly with the Korean style offering. And for the price, I would've liked a couple of sticks of carrots or celery (I know, this is New York).For my main course, I decided on the burger and tater tots (photo included). I can't believe I paid almost $20 for it, especially with about 8-10 tater tots in the box.

It was easy getting a table for 4 for 8pm on a Friday night. The hostess was very accommodating when I changed my reservations twice. We arrived at 8pm on Friday. It was a hot day and when we walked into the restaurant there was no AC, just a fan blowing hot air around. Since there was a breeze that night, we decided to sit outside. However, that experience turned out to be not so great as AC water from the apartments above the restaurant dripped down on us the entire time. Since it only affected two out of the four of us,  we decided we can suck it up. However, it was quite annoying and we regretted sitting outside for that reason.As soon as we were seated, we were given a bowl of their complimentary popcorn with magic dust. It was amazing - probably the best part of the dining experience. The popcorn was delicious. And addicting. I went for the restaurant week menu for the gochuchang wings, the pasta, and the blueberry pie dessert. The wings were flavorful and good. The pasta was mediocre at best. The dessert, which we used for the birthday dessert for my boyfriend, was hard to keep down. The portions were very small. My friend's duck waffle was the size of his palm. The two people in our party that enjoyed their food had the burger and one had the soft shell crab sandwich. Overall, the service was amazing and extremely accommodating, but the food left more to desire. Pros: free soda refills - you rarely see that in NY.

To start off, they give you a bowl of popcorn but don't underestimate it. You really can't just have one bite because it is so addicting! I wish I knew what the magic dust sprinkled on top was made out of! Instead of the normal chicken and waffles, they served a new twist on their menu, the country fried duck and waffle ($25), which was superb. Yes, it is rather heavy for a brunch meal but the light crispy flakey batter around the duck was heavenly and the French toast styled waffle was unique. I also decided to go all out and get the wings as well since many people were raving about them. They were good but doesn't live up to the hype and a bit overpriced ($16 for 6 pieces).

We got so much food - a spicy pasta, mussels, the duck bun platter, a big dessert platter with three desserts (plus other food too, which I can't recall now). We were so excited to come back with friends last weekend, but the food and portions were so disappointing. First, we had a raw tuna dish with avocado. It was good and a fair size for the first course. Then, we got a plate with three beets and three grilled orange slices. It was barely a course, I felt disappointed by the size and the dish itself - it was nothing special at all and I could have made it myself in 30 seconds. The next course was a homemade ricotta with peas. Again, nothing special. The peas tasted like they were boiled from frozen and the dish overall was lacking flavor. Our next course was a white fish (cod I believe) with potatoes and a green sauce. Finally some substance! However, the fish tasted very fishy and lacked flavor. The potatoes were nice and crispy, but just potatoes at the end of the day. For dessert, we got chocolate mousse with a chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was overcooked and tasted store bought. The mousse was good, but there were random not melted clumps of chocolate in it. Without the amazing popcorn Distilled served, we would have left hungry.

78,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1105,1096,5.0,8/28/2016,"For every Restaurant Week season, we try to do one family dinner as well as a family brunch since meeting for lunch during the weekday is next to impossible. This season, I decided on Distilled NY, since it's on the Soho area and had a very interesting menu. We're always up to trying something new, so a restaurant that advertises itself as a ""New American Public House"" definitely fits the bill! Their brunch menu ($29 per person) features 3 options for starters, entrées, and desserts. Although one of those desserts is an alcoholic ""nightcap""!Since we were a group of three, we decided to order a bunch of items and share them so we could try as much as we can. For starters, we opted for an order of their biscuits and two orders of their Distilled Wings. The biscuit comes with orange marmalade and whipped honey butter. The biscuit wasn't heavy or crumbly at all, which I quite liked. The Distilled Wings, however, stole the show. It's modeled after Korean chicken wings with a gochujang glaze. It's served with Point Reyes blue cheese, which really hit the spot. I highly recommend ordering their wings - despite the messiness!For our entrées, we ordered one of each item on the menu - French Toast Waffles with banana foster; Country Fried Duck with a French Toast Waffle, smoked chili maple syrup, and whipped honey butter; and the Smoked Salmon Scramble with salmon roe, chives, and a mini baguette.  All three entrées were very good - the French Toast Waffles were perfect for someone craving a sweet dish. The bananas were perfectly caramelized.The Country Fried Duck was very moist and tender. The smoked chili maple syrup contrasted nicely with the saltiness of the fried duck. I think this was my favorite entrée out of them all - it was hearty and savory. The skin of the fried duck was super crunchy and crispy!For dessert, they ran out of their Lemon Bars, which we were really looking forward to. We ended up ordering two of their Banana Bread and a S'mores. Turns out, since the S'mores is on their regular menu, you get half a portion - which I thought was a bit stingy of them. It's not our fault that you ran out of the Lemon Bar! Both desserts were good enough. If I wasn't so full from the previous dishes, I'd have definitely enjoyed the Banana Bread more since I'm a sucker for whiskey in cakes and breads.Service was attentive and our dishes all came out in a timely manner. When we arrived around 1pm, we were seated right away. The dining room was mostly empty with a 2-3 couples and one large group. When we left about an hour and a half later, the inside dining room was mostly full! Definitely come early or make a reservation.",3,,1

It was quite dark, I'm surprised they didn't have more lighting for the night time.I got the crispy brussel sprouts (comes with peanuts, fish sauce vinaigrette, bacon, pickled onion) and country duck and waffle.The crispy brussel sprouts were so delicious. Had a perfect balance of amount of bitter, salty, acidity, sweetness. I've had crispier brussel sprouts, but still quite crispy here. Definitely would recommend this for a starter.The country duck and waffle was mediocre. I never got why people loved the combination of chicken and waffle so much, but I decided to give this a try because I like duck more than chicken. However, I did not like how the duck tasted the way it was prepared here. Not sure how to describe it... However, the waffle was perfect fluffiness. The chili spiced maple syrup was delicious.While my entree was not so impressive, I would come back just to munch on the crispy brussel sprouts. SO GOOD!",,,

89,Nicholas R.,"Harrison, NJ",223,222,36,2.0,11/5/2017,"My girlfriend and friends took me here for my birthday and hyped this place up bigtime for me. I'm somewhat of a party pooper and despite them taking me, I still looked up the yelp reviews while sitting down (lol). My girlfriend said how this place had an interesting menu, offered free popcorn ( I love popcorn) and have a super friendly staff (which is increasingly important to me). During the month of August, I always prefer to sit inside as summers in NY/NJ can be brutal in the heat. Somehow, it was hotter inside than it was outside. Had we not had reservations, this would have been enough for us to say 'screw it' and leave. Places that cant put on the air conditioning during summer months I lose sympathy for. 1. think about your staff 2. Think about your customers 3. Competition alone will kill that decision. Regardless, we asked to sit outside for an attempt to get a breeze. After making this decision, our waiter seemingly forgot about us sitting out there and would only take a portion of our order at a time. We ordered the wings appetizer, which in all fairness, were delicious. I ordered the burger, and while good, it's on par with any Traditional or New American burger joint in the city. My friend ordered the duck waffle which was laughably small, especially for the price. The popcorn, while free, was stale. The blueberry pie was quite possibly one of the worst deserts we collectively ever ate. We felt bad wasting it, but round robin it across the table for someone to try and stomach it down. We even asked another table if they wanted it.Not sure if we went on a bad day or not.",,,

Updated review","Great service! Food was delivered fast. The popcorn was a nice treat while waiting on our dishes. We had the wings as an appetizer. I don't eat typically eat dark meat or wings ever, but these were amazing! They are twice fried and dipped in a tangy sauce. We had the biscuits and gravy and the minute steak during brunch. Both dishes were delicious. I will definitely come back for dinner!",,,

So attentive!The whole place reminded me a bit of an old-fashioned bar feeling, exactly what I was looking for for a casual gather-up (though in the AM). Menu was pretty extensive. While we shared the popcorn and the granola yogurt, I opted for the salmon roe scramble and my friend got the egg with grilled mushroom. I took a small bite of the mushroom and loved the texture! Dishes were all on the smaller side but this was good with me as I'm not a heavy bruncher anyway.Really enjoyed the whole thing! Would love to come back for dinner, and of course, drinks.",18,9,16
92,Lisa K.,"Newark, NJ",15,112,70,3.0,8/17/2017,"Walking home one day and got entranced by their alcoholic slushies and bowls of complimentary popcorn. Both were OK. We had the slushy flight so we could try them all, and there were definitely some we liked more than others, but I don't think I'd necessarily order any of them again. Popcorn had an interesting flavoring to it, but I mostly ate it because it was in front of me, not because I HAD to have some. The atmosphere was very chill and almost club-like. I'd come here again, but order different things",2,2,2

I see this place on a variety of websites and had been wanting to try it. We got the free popcorn but weren't particularly fans of the seasoning. Then we got the shishito peppers... but they were out of peppers so it was green beans. Wasn't the same. I thought the dinner menu was pretty limited so we both got the burger. It was fine, I liked the onions on it but the bun was nothing special. We both got beers and regular water... and then when we finished them, no one came to refill the waters or see if we wanted more beer. So, off to city vineyard we went! Sadly, won't be returning - plenty of other places to try in the neighborhood.",,,

Environment was nice for a date spot or friends catching up.",,,
98,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1701,2743,655,2.0,1/19/2017,"Stopped in, booth near the window. Too much material on the table - a big glass jar of knives, one for forks, two big bottles of water, glasses for each person and drinks, etc. - we often ran out of space on the table. Could be better organized.The Fluke Ceviche was good, a great starter (don't eat it later as it would be overwhelmed by what ended up being a very fried/heavy oil meal). The wings are good here. I'll give them that - crunchy outside and hot inside, and though the outside sauce is nothing to write home about, the texture and consistency is good. Flavor is very Korean fried chicken-like, so if you don't like that soy glazed wing, you're probably not going to be interested. St. Louis Cut Ribs fell off the bone and the spicing was too strong; felt almost like eating spices with the way they dusted it, rather than deep BBQ flavor you get from smoking the food well.Franklin Burger was a burger - nothing that exciting, though people liked the tater tots and pickle. Fresh Tagliatelle had a wonderful pesto + crunch sauce, and that was good. We had a big order of that, it was worth it. The crispy brussel sprouts are good, too. Burrata was fresh with a beet pesto, and bread that worked (thick slices of crusty bread).Country fried duck and waffle is their take - if you like a heavy, dense waffle, this may work for you. I'm not a fan (I like my waffles light and fluffy- more sweet Belgian style). And the duck wasn't anything amazing. NY Strip steak - even the steak knife had a hard time getting through the sinew that didn't cook fully (medium rare, too); I spent a lot of time chewing the one piece. Rack of Lamb was ok, but oversalted on the outside layer (literally crunching the salt off the edge - far too salty). Cut away that, and the inside of the lamb rack was good.Overall, a pretty heavy dinner with friends - we didn't feel good after and the next morning, so I would advise limiting your order to avoid this problem. A lot of fried or oily food, so you may want to balance with some of the lighter items like the ceviche and brussel sprouts.I'll come back for the wings and brussel sprouts and pasta - the rest, I've had much better away.",5,2,1
99,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",773,173,56,3.0,4/1/2017,"Food: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3/5Service: 3/5Value: 3/5Came here for a brunch twice, about a year apart. The most memorable part of the brunch to be honest was the magic dusted popcorn which they give out complimentarily at the beginning. It's a great mix of seasoning with a nice little kick, and my companion and I both times quickly finished the popcorn! The first time I came, I had the Country Fried Duck & Waffle, which was pretty good. I remember wishing the chicken was more moist and flavorful, as the smoked chili and maple syrup flavor seemed more to be separate entities than actually infused in with the chicken. The next time I went, I had the French Toast Waffles and Roasted Mushrooms. Both were fine, but nothing to write home about. The French Toast Waffles were eggier and more squish french toast than waffle, and the roasted mushrooms were a bit overwhelming and heavy. Now, I say this being an AVID mushroom lover... but it was really just a bit much, I couldn't even finish it!",,,

We also asked to be seated at another high top with backs for comfort (seeing as the restaurant was empty) and we were told not a single one was available. Sure, okay that's fair. No complimentary popcorn, as they had run out. We were promised a round to make up for it but that never materialized (don't offer if you're not going to follow through - we were disappointed x2 after that). The truffle pasta was lackluster and the slushee ""flight"" was only half slushees and half watered down drinks. The $15 truffle fries were a sad handful and a half.

The steak was perfectly cooked and the corn salad that accompanied it accentuated it's flavors. The passion fruit and chocolate mousse combination was so unique but very flavorful and delicious together. On top of amazing food and drinks, the staff was very kind and attentive. Would 10/10 recommend",,,
128,Andrew B.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,387,217,5.0,9/26/2016,"I absolutely love Distilled. It is hands down my favorite place to meet up with co workers for an after work happy hour. First off - get the wings. They are absolutely fantastic. The free popcorn is pretty damn good too and does a good job of soaking up the booze.What makes this place is the quality craft cocktail work being done behind the bar. Their bartenders and friendly, knowledgeable and do great work. And, for being in Tribeca it is actually priced pretty reasonably (as in, expensive but not $20 a cocktail). They also have a solid tap list if beer is your game. As long as I keep working in the area I will keep coming here. Hell, the wings might bring me back regardless.",1,1,1

It has a nice low lighting ambience, with a high vaulted ceiling probably from an old bank, and they serve you free popcorn to get you Thursday for their delicious cocktails.The wings were good, but a little too salty for our taste. They were extremely crispy and flavorful - almost too much so - the point Reyes blue cheese dressing was a nice counterpoint to the spiciness.We didn't stay for dinner as the menu just wasn't appealing that evening.

Even though we didn't book a private room, the staff here definitely put in their best effort to make our event as intimate as possible. They allowed us to put up some decorations which was nice. Food-wise, it was pretty average. I had the French toast waffles which were fluffy but kind of lacked the caramelized apple flavor. I was kind of hoping they would have more of the traditional brunch items but it was an interesting mix from burgers to enchiladas. I thought the best part was probably their free popcorn.  It was so tasty that I pretty much devoured the whole basket.",,,

Brunch on Saturday ends at 3 and my gf was very late. Decided to order the Duck and waffle. The duck is a large square cut thats country fried, soft and flakey- not oily or greasy which was a nice surprise and the waffle it sat on was moist and SO very flavorful- I'm talking FLAVOR- yummy!!!

141,Amanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,110,129,4.0,7/19/2016,"Awesome brunch spot in TriBeCa! I came here on a Saturday with a friend and there was no wait at all. There's seating both indoors and outdoors, but seeing that NYC was in the middle of a heat wave, we chose to sit inside. The interior is very spacious and modern. Super relaxed and chill atmosphere that's perfect for catching up with friends. To start, they have popcorn on the house and it's as addictive as promised. The flavor is kind of reminiscent of Asian chips -- spicy, sweet, and salty all at once but in a really, really good way. My friend ordered the biscuits and red gravy ($18) and I had the roasted mushrooms ($17). Both dishes were absolutely delicious. Generous portion of mushrooms and the roast with black vinegar was spot on. The demi baguette was also served hot, unlike other restaurants where breads that are usually cold and neglected, so it was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My friend loved her dish as well. The red gravy with spicy sausage was tasty and she didn't mind that there was more gravy than biscuit because it was just that good. The service was mediocre, especially compared to everything else. Our server mistakenly brought us the check before we even got our food, but she was nice and apologetic about it. At the end of the meal though, when I paid for the bill with tip included, she insisted on giving me back change.. but then didn't give me back the right amount (less than what I was owed) so that was a little off-putting. Aside from that, I would still definitely recommend paying Distilled a visit! I would love to come back to try other items on the menu.",1,1,2
142,Michelle W.,"Brooklyn, NY",549,223,89,5.0,6/10/2015,"There are endless perks to crushing on Distilled's most amazing, McCreamiest cocktail, the Franklin Fizz. Like you get to pretend you're drinking beer and you actually like it, when you're really getting tipsy off of a sweet and delicious tequila drink, topped with a frothy and complex-flavored egg white. Definitely a libation for the senses, as in even the tiny bubbles that tickle your nose as you inhale the FF have a distinct flavor. This drink tastes so good that I've wanted to lick the inside of my glass after each and every one I drink. But with all the 20-something suits standing around the bar at this swanky restaurant, that would be beyond embarrassing.Like after two FFs and another on the way, the plentiful and complimentary spicy popcorn that Distilled gives to each table suddenly becomes a quick appetizer. And you start to forget your responsibilities and ponder Distilled's classic menu. Why would you want to leave this place with so many other cocktail options, and the wings, the bird burger--a mix of duck, chicken and turkey, not sure that this is on the menu anymore--the tuna crudo, the miso cauliflower and the tater tots, can be easily labeled fantastic. Like you get to experience and admire the fusion of dark and sleek with vintage iron chandeliers and other country-fied, old American past touches of the decor. Like the service has been consistently attentive without interrupting too much. No messy model/actresses with BRF at Distilled, only clean and neat smiles all around.",5,3,4

Their free popcorn was also a great snack to nibble on while waiting by the bar. We got a table for 6, and all but one girl got the Franklin Burger. However, we ordered variations of it (how it's cooked, type of cheese, and side). I didn't think it would be hard, but all of our orders were wrong in one way or another. For example, 4 of us ordered tater tots for sides, and only 1 got tater tots. One of us requested cheddar, but it came out with American. I requested medium rare, and it was definitely medium/medium well. I was famished by the time the order came, so I didn't ask them to take it back, but I wasn't pleased. One of my friends didn't finish her burger and the host overheard her complain to us and offered us mescal shots which was very nice of him, so I give them an extra star.

We both ordered the truffle omelet without the truffle. It took about 40 minutes to arrive because they forgot our order or something. It was not worth the wait. The omelet was rubbery, bright yellow like it was made with egg beaters. It tasted like the truffle we didn't order and arrived on a weird little plate with a weird little salad. The side of bacon we got was the grossest bacon I've ever had. Like a fried slab of fat. I actually can't believe how bad the food was. And the service.

My god, that popcorn was so delicious, addicting and unlimited! It's totally making it onto the menu for my next potluck. We ended up finishing 3 bowls by the end of the meal. For apps, we split the gochujang wings and ribs. It actually took quite awhile for them to come out. Not sure what the hold up was but we received two complimentary dishes from the chef in the meantime which held us over. Burrata and a huge bowl of brussel sprouts. Unexpected and very generous! The burrata was a great creamy texture and the brussel sprouts were perfectly roasted. The wings and ribs came out shortly after --  both were tasty and prepared perfectly but I much preferred the wings, which were extremely saucy and crisp while still encompassing a piping hot, juicy middle. Lama and I had come from a yelp event prior and had snagged a few bites so we split an entree, the bird burger with tator tots. Everyone else had either the same or the highly regarded duck and waffle. I actually really enjoyed the burger. The extremely juicy and thick patty is made of turkey, chicken and duck but tasted very meaty. I thought it was seasoned just fine but Lama found it to be overly salty.

Its really good.To start I got a drink, the Tribecan. It has bourbon,  really strong but thats what im paying for. A drink to enjoy and sip on.Beer battered onion rings so freaking good and so is the mayo type sauce it comes with however got tired of the sauce quick so ate most of it without,Franklin burger, burger tastes fresh, comes with a sauce similar to thousand island. The patty is so thick in the burger i got full with just eating half.Tater Tots are delicious, melt in ur mouth.Food took about 20 min to come outServer although really really nice only checked on me once my entire meal. I sat there for quite some time without touching my food anymore and then I had to ask to see dessert menu. For Dessert i got the Smores 3.0 its  a chcolate cremeux bar. Topped with graham crackers and then toasted marshmallows on top. Its really good but the portion is good for 2 people. Of course, i ate it all because im paying for it but still, too much for 1 person.Total for 1 app, 1 entree, 1 drink and 1 dessert including tip $70",,,

This place is rather upscale but still had a diverse crowd. We sat a u-shape booth in the back. I ordered the mystic mead from Lakewood Vineyard NY. It had a light body and was moderately sweet with warm honey flavors. The complimentary popcorn had a nice cumin flavor and we ate two whole bowls. The bird burger was delicious except for the patty. They mix turkey, chicken, duck into a burger but it lacked enough fat to be juicy and it was packed too tightly which made slightly chewy. The brioche bun was buttery. The lettuce, tomato, and red onion were okay. The extra fried egg added a nice sauce to the mix. The half pickle was delightful. New York pickles are infinitely better than the ones is California. I don't know how anyone could come here and not offer the duck and waffles. This modernist take on the southern Classic was divine. The braised shredded duck is packed into square, breaded, and fried. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The breading was pretty thick but provides the necessary textural contrast since the waffle had a french toast feel to it. The waffle-ish was sweet, fluffy, and well made from the first to last bite. The Thai basil was an interesting addition but it didn't blow my mind like the waiter stated. The whipped honey butter was delicious but unnecessary in this already too decadent dish. The chili syrup was a tad too thick and definitely not spicy enough for my taste. The service was excellent. Plenty of water refills by virtually every waiter, busser, and expediter. I love when a restaurant acts like a team. Overall, I loved the place.",6,1,4

After a change in leadership, I was able to work with our operations director to push for an early dinner (yay) at Distilled. We weren't the only holiday party at the restaurant, this was clear in the way Distilled reorganized their menu into a mixture of small plates and large plates to create a three course set menu for the whole table. The highlight of the whole affair were those Korean-accented wings, along with the cauliflower and the topped popcorn. The main courses were a bit more ordinary, the bo bo chicken was a bit of a disappointment and the porgy just adequate. We had a whole section to ourselves, which allowed for our Secret Santa and the conversation that happened before and during the eating to not disturb other dinners. And I didn't get around to writing about this until April for reasons unclear. It really was the best Christmas celebration the office has ever had.",,,

176,Millie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,13,3,1.0,8/1/2018,I am so disappointed that I came to this restaurant/Bar. When I get there it was so hot inside it felt like there was no AC as hot and humid it was today. They said I couldn't sit at the bar they had an event going on. I came here because I was so excited to try the slush flights. I decided to sit outside when they serve my water it was not as cold as expected and no ice. I ask for Ice waiter said he will try his best because there was no ice. What Restaurant has no ice on a summer day. I ordered the slushy flight which was 4 drinks and I was disappointed because they are suppose to be slushies meaning like snow cone or icey. They was liquid watery so I ask the water I'm sorry ain't these suppose to be slushy? He said I'm sorry the machine is not working probably. I told him I specifically came here to have the slushy drinks for regular drink I could of gone to any bar and order a cocktail. You think they would of mentioned this before of course not. Unfortunately he couldn't do anything because the machine wasn't making the slushy because it wasn't working. For future I think the manager should keep inventory on the ice especially on a hot humid day that as soon as I sat down I wanted a glass of ice cold water. Very disappointed I will not be returning,,,
177,Dana M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,3,5.0,4/28/2018,"Distilled is the perfect place to head for post-work happy hour or dinner with friends. They serve innovative cocktails, beers on tap that I *want* to drink, and delicious food. The Glynda cocktail is my favorite - a refreshing, citrusy cocktail great for a warm day when you can snag a seat outside on their wrap-around patio. Highlight share plates include chickpea fries (sauce = addictive) and burrata. Distilled also offers a chef's tasting menu which I would highly recommend. Open kitchen allows you to watch the chefs work. Lastly, the staff is warm, knowledgeable, and attentive. I also would highly recommend Distilled for hosting a private event (the high ceilings, specifically, feel open).",,,
178,Jess M.,"New York, NY",99,1,3,4.0,4/3/2018,"Came here at 6 on a Tuesday and got seated right away and within two minutes two servers came by the table. We were brought 'magic dust' pop corn which was a bit odd to us, we thought it was a flat taste and could use more salt. Our server, Nate, was awesome, he said he had only been there for two weeks, but he was still able to answer all of our questions. We decided to do the 5 course dinner for $35. (FYI your whole party must order it and they will not tell you what you're getting) our first course came out and it was deviled eggs. We were disappointed at this because neither of us like deviled eggs and thought it was more of a brunch food. However because we did not like it they did give us a round of drinks to replace the first course. Our next course (which I forget the name of) was vegetables and 3 different spreads, one of which was beet hummus and was great. Our third course (which I also forgot the name of) was a smoked salmon on toast with goat cheese and pickled onions. This toast was surprisingly good, but we also thought it was more of a brunch food as opposed to a dinner food. Our main course was fried chicken with a spicy Asian sauce that was too die for. The chicken was the best fried chicken I have had. It had the perfect crispy and crunch outside with a nice juicy inside and the sauce was spectacular. We noticed they used this sauce a lot throughout the menu. Our last course was dessert and we were brought classic glazed donuts. The donut was a nice small and not too sweet dessert that was warm and fluffy on the inside. At first we were disappointed by the courses, but they got a lot better as they went on. Our waiter was always checking to make sure we were happy with it and asked for and happy took our feedback for the kitchen. We will definitely be coming back here, but maybe ordering off of the menu this time.",,,

We found seats at the bar fairly quickly and munched on the complimentary popcorn while waiting to order drinks. They've got a great drink selection overall-beer, wine, mixed drinks, and more.Our experience here was a little unique as there was a birthday party of about 75 guys in their 20s that kept arriving to hang at the bar.

184,Monica Z.,"Manhattan, NY",130,10,0,5.0,10/13/2016,"I've worked in the neighborhood for over a year and just tried this place for the first time - it is excellent. It's Thursday night, happy hour, so all the bars and restaurants are packed. The host offered up the ""chef's table,"" without hesitation, and we were led to the high top table next to the kitchen service window. We were immediately greeted by the head chef, Shane, who was genuinely hospitable and welcoming. He introduced us to the sous chef, Chris, who took care of us the entire night. Props to Chris for truly creating a wonderful experience for us. We came in for drinks and light fare, and ordered the mussels and duxelle & toast. It was so good, my mouth is watering recounting the experience. The mussels were cooked in a lager, ginger and herb  mixture, served with toasty bread, and plenty of sauce for dipping. The duxelle is similar to a pate, except vegetarian. Think 3 kinds of mushrooms blended with rosemary, thyme, white wine, a touch of cream, topped with a drizzle of honey, and served with some more of that amazing toasty bread. And the popcorn - I can't. It's so delicious, and complimentary! They're nailing it on the head when it comes to gaining returning customers. To top it all off, Chris generously offered to us a sampling of the house tater tots to ""hold us over"" while we waited for our food. Light fare quickly became a 3 course meal, which I will never, ever turn down. I can't wait to come back again. The dishes are a little pricey, but there are so many perks, how could you not be happy paying the price? The space is large, ambient, and the crowd is a huge range of different types of people. Great energy overall. Appropriate for a date, a business outing, or a fun gathering with friends.They really have something special going on here and I'm really looking forward to bringing my colleagues and friends, and turning it into one of my go to after work spots.",2,,1

I do not think i would ever order it once more as I idea it would offer extra ""off the menu"" entrees or appetizers however it had everything to be had on the menu and one dish that changed into one of a kind. subsequent time i'll simply come in the course of happy hour for some drinks, wings, and popcorn to snack on.meals: Popcorn is a specific twist then getting bread as a snack. it's no longer your normal popcorn and has a completely unique cumin flavor! They began Kobucha squash soup which I relatively advocate for some thing light and flavorful. Our 2d dish changed into the wings and those are exceptional, quite hefty so the 2 they gave turned into a perfect amount. i might suggest these as an app or in case you come for some snacks and a drink. Our third dish turned into their one ""marvel"" off the menu dish and the pasta became now not as awesome as I imagined it to be. The dish turned into very salty and tough to devour. The simplest element I really enjoyed was the poached egg it got here with. My predominant dish changed into the bone in beef chop which I enjoyed for the hint of apple flavoring. Our final dish changed into a chocolate cake which become accurate but just like another chocolate cake.drinks: Ordered the Dram Betty and i'll certainly order it again! notable cocktail it's very clean with the cucumber flavor!ambience/service: The server was very exceptional and explained each dish throughly. the ambience and lighting fixtures has a pleasing temper setting, desirable for a few casual drinks, satisfied hour or even a date night.",3,1,2

Very strange.The kale salad was good. Nothing special. The dressing was good but a bit too much of it for my taste.The tuna was cooked perfectly. However, it was quite cold when we got it. Seemed it didn't really warm up enough to make it to a warm temp to the table after it was cooked.Overall, I would say the food was quite forgettable and the service was ok.

We were seated immediately for a table of 4. They happened to be filming and episode for ""my giant life"" on TLC - it didn't disrupt the restaurant at all (was actually kind of cool). They brought complementary popcorn for the table and it was awesome. We all ordered mimosas - delicious. Food: As soon as I saw the country fried duck and waffles - I couldn't look any further. I asked the waitress about it and she said it was one of their signature dishes so, I was sold. It did not disappoint. The crispiness of the coating on the duck was so delicious and perfectly cooked. I am a big fan of chicken and waffles and this take on it was raising the bar. The other people I was with ordered the egg sandwiches ( I forget the specific names) but they enjoyed it as well. Service: There was a minor mistake made when one of them came out with bacon and it was ordered without. The waitress quickly fixed the mistake and we all enjoyed our meals together.

The Country Fried Duck and Waffle was very good.  The waffle especially was the standout of the meal, though it was a hybrid underdone waffle / pancake.  Was still delicious (if not crispy in any way).  The duck itself was good, though the crispy batter broke off when first cut.The Roasted Mushrooms took yet another couple minutes to make it to our table ... cold.  By that point we had to get out of there so not sure if this would have made up for everything (though I kinda doubt it).Overall, while the place has a cool look and an interesting sounding menu, the execution and service left me wishing we'd stopped at any of the 3 other spots we passed on the way.",2,,
193,Paul E.,"Toronto, Canada",91,304,352,5.0,6/2/2014,"On our trip to New York, this was my girlfriend and my favourite dinner we had! This is a really special place as the food and service was all excellent, and if I'm in New York again I would make sure to return.Like many other reviewers have mentioned to start they have the complimentary popcorn with brewer's yeast, garlic and cumin and they aren't shy about refilling it if you run out. That's when you know when a restaurant is good, when they refill the bread, or in this case popcorn.After the popcorn, our Duck Liver Pate with Chicken Skin Crackers (and regular crackers) arrived. This was one of my favourite dishes and is a must order. The pate is nice and smooth and flavourful, and coupled with the whipped honey, and the acid from the pickled shallots, it is heaven on a cracker. For those creeped out by chicken skin crackers, like my girlfriend, it also comes with regular crackers. They were also willing to give us some more crackers to finish off the pate as we ran out, another plus.After that, our Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Roasted Mushrooms arrived. The mushroom dish was my other favourite dish, and I would strongly suggest it. The brussels sprouts were fantastic too, and there was a lot going on with the bacon, candied peanuts, and fish sauce vinaigrette. Lastly, we had some of their famous wings. The Wings are perfectly crispy, and the Gochujang Sauce was unique and familiar at the same time. The sauce worked really well with the Point Reyes Blue sauce, and I highly recommend getting some of that on the wing before you dig in. We only ordered 5 of them, but it was filling enough, but tasty enough that I wondered if we should have gotten more.Oh, and to end the meal we ordered their new Mounds dessert. It had a lot of elements and was pretty tasty.",2,,

Now onto food.  They provide complementary popcorn sprinkled with magic dust (seems like some sort of salt and pepper mix). It was average to me.Distilled wings - texture like Korean fried chicken with similar soy garlic sauce drizzled over it with a side of blue cheese.  Delicious!  I did not dip it in the blue cheese, naked was already good.Franklin burger - wow! This was perfect.  One of the best burgers I've had. I was reluctant to have a burger for brunch as I love eggs but the reviews of this dish just caught my eye.  Grass fed beef with lettuce tomato and Manhattan sauce.  Very traditional burger without an overload of condiments.      Juicy and delicious. Comes with a side of either hash browns or salad.  I opted for the salad, dressing was too salty.  Burger was for sure the best part. I would get this again if I come back.  They also have a country fried duck over a waffle.
