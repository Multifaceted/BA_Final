1,Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",391,741,425,1.0,1/3/2018,"Whatever company you allowed to book for NYE, don't do it again. Complete fire hazard. Way too packed. Fully ratchet, opened late but still didn't extend the open bar. The DJ, late. The bartender, late. The coat check person, late. The woman who cooked 3 plates of food in her home, late. They marketed it as a buffet and only fed 20 people before the food ran out and left the other folk standing in line looking stupid lol. No party favors, no champagne toast, no premium liquor. I asked for Patron for my tequila sunrise and was told they don't have it so he used Jose. Saw little bartenders walking around with Patron for groups who purchased the Bronze package. Also the female bartender was trash. I had the guy making my tequila sunrises and it was fine. I asked her and she handed me a tequila and pineapple. No splash of nothing. Where's the grenadine, my guy?! I think I tipped her too smh. A mess.",6,6,2
2,Rachel Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/21/2018,"This place is terrible! Don't go! The bartender was very very rude. I was waiting to order my drinks and then another guy came. The bartender asked him first even though she knew I was there first. A beer $10 dollar, a club soda $5 dollars. There's no drink menu or anything. She sets the price as she wants.",1,,
3,Lisa H.,"Bayonne, NJ",35,86,15,1.0,1/1/2018,"HORRIBLE. They delivered nothing they said they were and it was unsafe.  Fights, drunks, overcrowding, and they did not honor their happy hour. NYE was ruined because of them. AVOID!",2,,
4,Em M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",139,2,0,1.0,10/8/2017,"If you ever visit this place, protect your stuff, same staff personnel stole my bag, then returned my phone and later my wallet and tried asking for money back. The waiter who was returning my stuff said the security was the one who handed him the stuff which was inside the purse. They also returned my friends phone and asked for 600$ back. They kept my prada bag, two of my credit cards, my friends Ids and credit cards. My friend and I filed a police report same night. Owner should do a better job at hiring staff. Extremely dissapointed And upsetting experience!!",3,,
5,Tekwar T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,91,2,2.0,9/9/2017,I went here for a dance party but it's a typical lounge bar where you can't dance when it's crowded. It's really dark in there so I can't tell if they're decor is rustic or shabby. $13 for a cocktail. Two bathrooms: long lines. I'm outta here.,1,,

7,Reen Y.,"New York, NY",225,22,0,5.0,12/23/2017,"I hosted a party here for my birthday last year (through Birthdays and Bottles - Josh was awesome and helpful!) It was a frigid saturday night in January, so it was pretty empty. Which definitely worked in our favor because we had the whole place to ourselves. The bartender/hostess was very nice, made sure to accommodate the table, bottle, etc. But the best part was certainly the music - the DJ was one of the best I've ever been around in the city. The music was dance hit after dance hit - we danced the entire night away. More people filed in later in the night as well. One of my favorite birthdays to date!",1,,
8,Michelle T.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,10,0,4.0,1/18/2017,"I went to a birthday party on Saturday night and had a great time.Number 1. WHO IS THE DJ? (The one who was playing on Jan 14th)He's one of the best I've had the pleasure to dance to and my friends loved him too. Amazing transitions, music choices were on point, and remixes were on fire. Other than that, great little space, I think the birthday girl was very pleased with accommodations and we were all happy too. Everyone was pretty respectful and nice, as was the bouncer. Cute little detail of the bar includes a little ""speak easy"" walk through the Red Bull vending machine to uncover an inside club for some EDM music. Coat check and drink prices were pretty consistent to NYC. I'd recommend it for a chill time!",,,
9,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,3.0,7/8/2016,It was COLD inside.  You can dance here & they have hookah (which I did not partake in).  Came with some business contacts after a Saturday night fashion show; it was empty here at first then started to fill up.  Very easy to miss this place and pass by it.  I do like the books on the shelves; it has a very library feel to it.  Also very dark.  Not sure if I'd go back alone & I didn't drink so I can't say much but no complaints from me.,2,1,
10,Lily R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,5.0,12/22/2016,"This place may have been closed but it's not now.My company had its holiday party here earlier this week and we had a wonderful time. The bartenders were quick and attentive, and the managers were hospitable, generous and easy to work with. It's a swanky little spot with plenty of seating and a proper DJ booth plus a nice sound system. Highly recommended!",,,
11,Gab D.,"New York, NY",237,26,0,1.0,12/18/2016,Had a terrible experience here on my friend's birthday. Don't give them you're business or they'll scam you for your money! Definitely NOT the place to spend your night out in NYC.,2,1,
12,Grace G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,15,1.0,10/26/2015,"I went to Open House this past Friday with my friend J for their ElevenEleven party which caters toward the gay crowd. Drinks were good and we went to dance a bit. After a while, J made some new friends and it was time for me to go, I went to the bar to check out and asked the female bartender for my tab, she got it for me and it was wrong - we had 2 drinks which probably would've been somewhere around $22 and my tab was $85! She also said she couldn't find my ID which I had to leave with the tab. She went off to find a manager...She didn't come back for a while and I asked the other male bartender what was going on. I explained to him what had happened and he said,""Honey.... you have zero power here."" -- He was short, thin, with long brown hair. The two nice gay guys standing next to me were equally as offended as I was. One was a lawyer and offered me his card. It's ridiculous that I would be discriminated against for being a straight female at a gay bar. To tell me I have no power when my tab is wrong and my ID has been lost is absolutely wrong. After about 30 minutes of this, I eventually found my ID on top of a speaker, I have no idea how it got there and the female bartender came back and told me my bill had been comped. I just checked my bank account and the charge is still there. Open House should be a bit more careful who they let throw parties in their club. I will be disputing the charge and that bartender should be ashamed of himself.",12,2,
13,Alyssa C.,"Manhattan, NY",55,36,2,1.0,10/22/2016,"My friends and I often have our birthdays here.. or at least we used to. Rob is great when helping to arrange a party. Unfortunately, my friends and I recently attended a party here and our one friend was not allowed inside because she was not drinking and therefore was not going to pay the $35 for the open bar she was not partaking in. Being that she was on medication and could not drink, this was absolutely unnecessary. The bar should have let her in and given her another wristband so she couldn't try to get a drink. Considering we've brought tons of business to this establishment, it was just distasteful and rude.",4,,
14,Alexis G.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,9,0,5.0,3/31/2017,"Joshua is amazing! He is extremely organized and efficient. He made planning my birthday so easy that i actually enjoyed the process. All of my friends had a great time and it was the perfect party. Everything Joshua told me would happen did, and there were no surprises or red tape. I highly recommend Open House and Joshua!

15,Michael L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,11,0,1.0,12/5/2015,"LIES/FRAUD/SHOPPING SPREE/BEING PASSÉ:My boyfriend left our shared credit card there overnight (which is admittedly his fault but by no means crazy or anomalous behavior for a late night bar-goer). When we returned for the card (the next week as they are closed Sunday to Thursday), they told us they didn't have it. However, when I called to cancel the credit card, I had to negotiate a charge from earlier that week for someone spending ~$200 at Target (maybe they were buying $200 of scent spray to cover up the smell of coke shit from their fetid bathrooms). Also 11:11 is pretty over so there's that.",1,1,
16,Carmelo C.,"Manhattan, NY",297,3,0,1.0,12/17/2016,This place is fucking terrible. Bouncers are dicks. Ruined my friend's birthday. Tried charging everyone $35 at the door for an open bar from 10-12 REGARDLESS OF THE TIME YOU GOT OR IF YOU WEREN'T EVEN DRINKING! Never come here. Horrendous.,,3,
17,Dannaliz M.,"Bronx, NY",7,4,0,1.0,8/16/2016,"The bar tender charged me for someone else's tab. His excuse was our first names were similar (they had 2 letters in common).That is not an excuse considering he had my ID and I told him my last name. It has been 6 days and I'm still waiting for my refund. Besides that, the music was wack, nobody was dancing and the drinks were mediocre. I don't recommend visiting this sketchy establishment.",4,,
18,Emily B.,"Manhattan, NY",81,15,0,1.0,8/25/2015,"One of the worst bar experiences I've had in NYC. The place itself is mediocre, music is loud and everyone there seemed to be 17 but hey, its the LES. Gin and soda was super weak and served in a plastic cup, but I figured 'well at least it'll probably be cheap.'ALAS, I get my check for my two well gins (not even a brand name!) and it is $26. ARE YOU KIDDING? I don't mind paying that for a great cocktail, but for probably one ounce of off-brand liquor in a plastic cup? Never again. There are FAR better options in the area, take your business elsewhere.",2,,2

20,Lipi R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",143,2,0,5.0,6/20/2017,This is a gem of a bar. I had my birthday party here this past weekend and the venue space was great and staff was very friendly and hospitable to all of my guests. I would happily come here again with a group of friends. It is also near NYU so the vibe is really cool.,,,
21,Daniel L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,6,0,1.0,12/18/2016,"This place is ABSOLUTELY horrible, they will tell you one thing and what you get will be completely different. I have NEVER heard of this place before and for the first time, I gave this place a chance to celebrate my birthday. Naturally, I opt for the open Bar when they told me that Open bar is optional. But on the night of my birthday, they made and forced all my friends to pay, even if they don't wanna pick the open bar option. Like r u kidding? They told me that open bar is optional but on the day of my birthday, they told everyone to pay the 35 even if they are not drinking. No matter how cold the weather is, they have to stand outside and wait till it is 12 which is when the Open Bar ended. For those you that don't know New York City Winter, it is completely out of the world COLD. (I mean who in the world would wanna ruin someone's birthday?) And they made me VERY UPSET the ENTIRE NIGHT because of their ill-fitting management & unprofessional service. ON TOP OF THAT, the table that I was promised for was never there. like what? Mortified is the least I can say about the situation.  So if you wanna celebrate your birthday, THIS IS THE LAST PLACE YOU YOU WANNA CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY. PERIOD. Bouncers are so rude as well, and their manager Lance is an absolute DISASTER and they will make sure everyone pay $35 so make sure y'all know that. The craziest thing is if they would not have mentioned my name, they could have just walked in, with no problem. ALSO, the entire place looks completely run down. I thought I was walking into some sort of a haunted house that was meant to scare people. Mind you it is no long Halloween anymore. It was SO DARK inside, I can barely see anything clear inside. Drinks are way overprice as if they are the top notch club and it was overall a disaster to say the least. Mind you I brought them more than 50 amazing individuals and not a single one of them are happy. they acted as if they are one of the best bar in the city. I mean if y'all are going to be high & mighty about your business, at least make sure y'all match the same level as One Oak, PHD or some. This is nothing but a dive bar and that's me being very nice to even put them in that category. So if you ever wanna go out, celebrate your night or have fun, THIS IS THE LAST PLACE IN THE WORLD YOU WANNA GO. SAVE YOURSELF A TRIP. SERIOUSLY.",6,2,
22,Kelvin C.,"New York, NY",87,33,11,3.0,5/1/2015,"This place is pretty small, then again so is the majority of places in the LES.  as for the environment, they play good music and gets insanely full (may break some fire code type of full) on the weekends so make sure you get there before 12. Drinks are the normal nyc prices, $5 cover and mandatory coat check so prepare to bring some cash.",1,,

24,Larisa K.,"Bath Beach, NY",83,40,0,1.0,2/1/2015,"Terrible. Went here on saturday night, and they seem to not care at all about capacity laws. This place was jam packed, no room to scratch your head.. let alone dance. Not like you would want to anyway, because the music is terrible. Weird, robotic, wordless electronic music ( and I'm usually a fan of indie/electronic)60 Dollars for 3 mixed drinks, And I think its tacky when theres a cover charge of 5 dollars at the door ( eye roll )Went downstairs for a .. I guess a different ""party"" that started at 2am, which looked like I came into someone basement. The decor was a single string of christmas tree lights and what looked like a couch they found on the street. No heating. The type of atmosphere where If your a depressed drunk... won't make your situation better. Damn ""partying"" in a spare storage room with music which sounded mixed by a tone deaf optimus prime, in NYC, will make anyone a depressed drunk.I high-Tailed it out of there, well more like slowly clawed my way out of a sardine can is a more accurate description.",2,2,
25,Emily D.,"Ridgefield, CT",238,78,40,5.0,7/9/2016,Sasha Dimitrijevic is amazing she was the best sever we could have ever asked for she made the entire night and our experience at Open House.  She was absolutely stupendous and I could not so for anything better from my night night I am so exited to come back to Open House and see Sasha again,,,
26,Carly S.,"Manhattan, NY",209,15,9,5.0,4/4/2016,"I reserved a table for my friend's bachelorette party on saturday night through birthdaysandbottles.com. The process of reserving with Josh at birthdays and bottles was super seamless, and we did not have to pay to reserve which was a big plus. We arrived at around eleven and the club was pretty empty for about an hour, when it began to fill up. We had a table and two bottles for an extremely reasonable price for NYC, and we loved the playlist of 90s/00's top 40 (perfect for our group of late 20s/30s!) The vibe was chill, and our server, Sasha, was really great. I would highly recommend this spot for an event such as a birthday or bachelorette, and would recommend Josh at birthdaysandbottles at well. Thanks so much!",1,,

29,Christina N.,"Brooklyn, NY",138,22,3,1.0,10/30/2016,"Went here yesterday for Halloween weekend. I bought a groupon that was admission for two for $30. When my husband and I got there, we presented our voucher at the gate. The bouncers were super confused and didn't let us in, and had to ask their supervisor for help. I don't understand why this was such an issue when the tickets were purchased from Groupon - it's very straightforward. Once we got in, it was super packed. We were told to go downstairs, and maneuvered through the huge crowd (which actually was probably a severe fire hazard). Once we got downstairs, we were told we needed a stamp to enter. So we had to go upstairs and maneuver through the entire crowd AGAIN to get a stamp. And when we went back down again... we were kicked out, being told it was a private party. I am so angry I wasted my money on this terrible place. We literally left after 5 minutes and went to another place nearby, and danced the night away happily after leaving this trash bag joint. I'm writing this so you all don't make the same mistake we did. DO NOT GO HERE, you will regret it. Such a waste of money on such a cramped, ratchet, unaccommodating place. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would.",2,,
30,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",758,1660,36,4.0,5/28/2012,"Well upstairs isn't really my cuppa, but on the right nights, head down to the basement, find your way to the back where you'll find an unmarked door.  Through this you'll enter a lounge that's bringing some of the better house music that's happening of late.  Small local and resident DJs will be spinning some very sweet sounds.  Used to be called Stay and before that it changed names every couple of years for the last decade.  I can't even keep track anymore.",5,,3
31,Stefanie S.,"Mount Sinai, NY",224,3,0,1.0,12/18/2016,My friend Dan had a birthday here. They required a $35 cover charge even to people who weren't participating in the open bar. The place is small and awful. Not coming back everrrr,1,,

33,Sharan J.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,51,1,1.0,12/16/2013,"I was very excited for my birthday and had heard good things about Open House through a friend. I made a reservation via email for about 25 people for Saturday, December 7th and was told out group would have a complimentary bottle of champagne and table.  Our large group arrived promptly around 10:45pm on Saturday. I told the bouncers that I had a guestlist and went in with my large group no cover and no issues. I thought that this would be great - Boy was I wrong!Once inside we were told to see a lady named Joy to get our reservation. My brother and I spoke to her and she informed us that we DID NOT have a table and DID NOT have a bottle of champagne (as I was previously PROMISED VIA EMAIL by the manager Rob). I then asked to speak to the manager and Joy replied that he was not there that night.My brother seeing that I was upset (me being the birthday girl and all), went back to speak with Joy and we found out she lied to us when in fact Rob was indeed there that night. After speaking to Rob directly he basically told us that they gave our table away to another party that was paying for a bottle.  I mean really? We went to the lounge with way more people than expected and were there all night spending money and you couldn't even give us our reservation as we had spoken about via email and I had confirmed a week in advance? We told them that we would be writing them a bad review and they did end up bringing out a bottle of champagne. That doesn't really change the fact of their bad service nor would it want to make me come back again.The lounge itself was small, stuffy and dark. It was definitely filled with more people it could handle. I don't really see what the hype is about this place and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",21,,
34,Sebastian N.,"Bay Shore, NY",28,9,2,5.0,10/26/2014,"Great place! Came here for my birthday and reserved a table. Got there and the bouncers were super friendly unlike most in NYC. The table and bottles were delivered as promised. The staff and bartenders went above and beyond to make sure my party was having a good time.The place has a real cool hip atmosphere and the drinks were pretty strong and well-made.Overall it's a place I will definitely be coming back to. It's hard to find a good spot in NYC with friendly staff, this is what makes open house a real treat.",,1,
35,Marla T.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,4,0,1.0,7/25/2015,The bar was empty on a Saturday night and we were not greeted well by the bartender. The bar website says its a mixology bar; however it is not true. The bar has no cocktail menu and has no house made mixes. My friend ordered wine it was stale and was low quality wine. The bar is underwhelming and has poor service.,2,,
36,Kara R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/18/2016,This place was so gross. I went for my friend's birthday and not only did they ruin his birthday and over charge all of his friends but let the WORST crowd in. It was filled with wasted 21 year olds being aggressive and throwing up everywhere. I will never ever go back to this place. What a rip off!!,,,
37,Arjun S.,"Manhattan, NY",9,1,0,5.0,3/8/2014,"I organized a fundraiser with Open House where we sold open bar tickets and donated a portion of the proceeds to charity. All in all, the entire process was FANTASTIC. The bar itself was very well set-up. The lighting was great (dark but not too dark). There were two bars on the first floor (one in the front, and the other in the back) with couches in the middle. All the bartenders and staff were incredibly nice. I didn't have any trouble at all getting a drink (and I'm a dude). The music was at the perfect volume where it was loud enough to hear, but not too loud so as to drown out conversation. I worked with the bar manager, Rob, to organize the fundraiser deal. He was nothing but helpful, prompt, and professional. It was an incredibly simple process that went through with no issues or problems. (FYI- I say this after having attempted to work with many bar managers to organize the same event. Rob is best in class). At the bar itself, I worked with Joy to confirm our guest list. She too was incredibly helpful and nice. She was a huge part in a very smooth running event. To summarize- Great Bar, Great People, and an overall Great Experience!",2,,

43,Alana L.,"Manhattan, NY",70,1,0,1.0,12/20/2014,"I emailed to reserve space for my birthday on a friday night. The reservation was only a name at the door. My friends arrived at 10, and got denied. The bouncer, didn't even know I had a reservation and had to go inside to check.  After I had heard they were turning away friends, i tried to call the establishment. No one picked up,  so I took a cab over only to find that even I was being denied to my own party. The bouncer REFUSED ENTRY until 11.  Some of my friends came early and they left. Needless to say, I was quite frustrated as I invited over 40 people out and wasn't planning on changing venues last minute.  I expected a much higher level of service from the company, and I am quite disappointed. Not only were they turning my friends and I away, but they started to charge them cover! This was not mentioned to me while making the reservation.",3,,

47,Cassie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,1,0,5.0,2/10/2014,"I coud not love this place more. It is consistently a great time- music is always on point, there's always a large crowd but not overly packed, and overall a great night, always. I hosted a benefit for my Autism foundation in October and the owner Rob was kind enough to give us a comp bottle to come back and experience Open House as guests. We went back this past weekend and had just as much fun the next time around. We got there at 10:45-11, as suggested, but our guests were able to come in as they arrived. The service was outstanding (Joy was great and made the night so fun and seamless).  We ordered two bottles alongside our comped bottle and were impressed with the care and attention we received. In NYC where everywhere is so hit-or-miss, I know I can always go to Open House to get great service and be assured we'll have an awesome night.",,,

It was nice and chilly inside too which would have been perfect for dancing the night away... except the DJS played nothing that you could really dance to. Even those who really were trying to dance could only really bob to a few songs. We tried to make some request but the DJs literally showed us that they had nothing else to play.  I literally only came to this spot because reviews made it seem like it played such good music. Maybe I came on a bad night =[.Also, I got there at 10 because I like to go out early and go home early (I like my sleep!) and they weren't really open yet, so we went to eat and came back closer to 11 and then things were set up but pretty empty.Lastly, there is literally NO DRESS CODE. I like that the vibe was chill and guys could wear sneakers because my boyfriend loves to wear his Jordans but some girls were literally in old navy flip flops which was disappointing. I also wish I knew there was no dress code so that me and my boyfriend and friends weren't dressed up in shoes when we could have dressed a bit more slack.Overall I would go back only if I knew who the DJ was going to be and that they played some good music. If the music was on point it would have been an awesome night but unfortunately the night was pretty boring =[.",,,

There is no sign at the entrance, it is just two big doors.The club itself was quite big with a second dance floor downstairs. I definitely recommend going there if you want to have a fun night but do not expect anything too special either!",,,
50,Patti L.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",6,88,1,2.0,3/5/2013,"Went there on a Friday night and it was...uhh....empty. I'd really like to give this place more stars because the bar itself wasn't too bad. They had two separate places to get drinks which was nice because it's such a small bar they could have gotten away with only having one. It's pretty dark inside, the music wasn't bad, and the bathrooms were more than adequate. But it was empty...ON A FRIDAY NIGHT! There were a handful of dudes lounging in the corner but other than that me and my group of friends were literally the only other ones there. If you're going out in the city, its a nice place if you just want to chill and talk. But they label themselves as more of a club and as such, they really fall flat. **Pro Tip:  It's New York, don't wear sneakers. Get dressed up, look nice, they DO have a dress code.",1,,

When I attempted to dispute with them, the bartender got really sassy and rude, essentially blaming us for not specifying that we were using the Yelp deal even though I clearly stated that and had presented it to another bartender that night. The whole situation was ridiculous and the drinks were terrible. Comedians downstairs were pretty lousy too. Made a lot of lame gay jokes.",1,1,1

And sometimes, you come across a terrible bar that has decently cool people in it. This was not either of those. This was an absolutely terrible place with the douchiest clientele imaginable. Oh, and a member of the staff threatened my girlfriend and called her a bitch for trying to access a bathroom that she was told by another staff member to use. While I was in the men's room (which had an inch of piss and shit on the floor and all over the toilet seat), a girl stormed in and started having a screaming match with the other guy inthe bathroom, in which they inexplicably both started screaming anti-semitic slurs at eah other. The entire time I was at this bar, I felt like I was a part of some social experiment. Worst experience of my bar-going life. Ever.",,3,
55,Brian R.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,23,0,3.0,11/10/2014,"Open House was where I recently had my birthday party.  Overall the experience was great and I would definitely recommend this place to fellow Yelpers.First of all I liked the fact that it was easy to reserve a table which was done via e-mail.  Also when you do you get a complimentary bottle of champagne.  Heads up, you need to pay a $20 gratuity if you do this.  It was odd though because even though I started there would be 15-20 people coming we only got a small table that could seat at most 4.The Yelp deal is also great with a major reservation.  $30 for 5 drink tickets is the best drink deal I've ever heard of in the city, seriously, if you go hear for any reason get this deal.  I did this and it gives you the option of bringing your phone there or printing out the Yelp deal as the two ways of redeeming the offer.  I like to print things out so that's what I did but when I showed the bartender the print out she wouldn't accept it.  She said ""only on the phone"".  It doesn't make sense that Yelp would give you the option of printing out the Yelp offer and telling you that you can bring it to the bar but then they don't honor it.  Luckily my phone was fully charged and it wasn't an issue to get the offer honored that way but this place loses a FULL star for its inability to fully honor a Yelp deal.  If you don't want people printing out the offer then don't give them that option! (Sorry, just pissed because of the weird interaction with the bartender because of this on the night in question).The music and venue is decent but its small compared to other places in the city.  It's literally a long narrow corridor-esque bar/club without a dedicated dance floor so not the best place for dancing.  There's a ""secret"" bar/club area in the basement: vending machine... wink wink.  Overall this is a decent place but I would argue that its more of a place to end the night rather than start it (if you're club hopping) given its since and the fact it doesn't get pumping until later at night.  But no regrets to having my birthday here!  3.5/5",,1,

The only problem I had was with the DJ. Every other staff member was friendly and nice, but I went up to the DJ to request a song. He was playing almost nothing but Drake songs along with all the other bs excuses for rap that everyone loves nowadays and we wanted to hear some reggae or at least some old school 90s stuff. I went up first to ask for reggae and he said no. I went up again and spoke with some guy who was sitting in front of the dj who literally put his leg up and across to block me. I asked for foxy brown's ""gotta take me home"" and he just shook his head no like I suggested something crazy and told me to go. The place was practically empty and I'm guessing its because of that kind of treatment and lack of variety in music.",,,

The DJ was good but never let a song play for more than about 30 seconds which got a little irritating, but the songs were mostly good so it didn't bother me as much as other people. My problem was mainly with the bathrooms. The bathroom upstairs is coed and had no tp, I asked if they could grab some and they told me to go downstairs. I went downstairs and the same problem occurred in the women's restroom.

The security guards are abusive and it would not surprise me if other more violent behaviors have happened with women who were much more intoxicated than I was (which was not at all).This was without a doubt the worst bar I've been to EVER. Upon meeting some friends there for a drink after their show, I was greeted by incredibly hostile bouncers; a bar that was packed beyond capacity; and a bathroom line that was at least 30+ long for the women's room. A woman in line behind me asked a member of security if there was another bathroom and was told to go to the lower level to access a less crowded one. Upon following her, a different member of security yelled at her, called her a bitch, and told her to go away even when she insisted security told us we could go. When I attempted to assure him the girl was indeed told to go downstairs, the guard became extremely threatening, called me a bitch and refused to let us go even though we had given up our space in the incredibly long bathroom line. Not wanting to be physically assaulted after already dealing with the verbal abuse, we both reported the behavior to the nearby coat check girl- who was completely unfazed by the bouncer's behavior. Upstairs, I told someone who claimed to be the manager- who said he would look into it, but he never came back to assure me things were looked into and I gave up and left, wishing I had never set foot in this despicable establishment to begin with. This place should be shut down. It was WAY over capacity; multiple health code violations; and an abusive staff. Please avoid at all costs!",,,

73,Winny L.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,30,20,2.0,1/23/2013,"Umm... this place is wack. lol. I would give it one star, but there is a possibility that I went on the wrong night. But then again, if Friday was the wrong night to go, then maybe this bar/club/lounge is pretty wack.Anyway, I spoke with someone named Rob through email 3 weeks before my birthday  to make a reservation for Friday Jan 18. I quickly got a reply saying that my name will be at the door and we will be getting complimentary champagne. Woohoo!So I got there with my peeps at 10 pm. When the dude up front asked me if I was with a party, I told him my name and guess what? He says I'm not on there. It was pretty cold out, so I had to take out my phone and show him the email. Then the bouncer had to go inside, get Rob to verify that he in fact wrote that email. Rob seemed pretty clueless and even said to himself ""when did I write that?"" So they ended up giving us a table. The place was pretty dead, but the bartender lady said it was early and it should get crowded later. So we waited til around 11 pm and the place was still pretty empty. Now, usually, a non-crowded lounge/bar is a good thing. However, the music SUCKED. Nothing that we could dance to. We tried, but we just couldn't. The DJ looked like she was bored and did not even want to be there.After 11, more of my friends came and we decided we wanted to pop our bottle of champagne. However, the bartender informed us that there was gonna be a fee of $20. WTF. $20 for opening and pouring a bottle of COMPLIMENTARY champagne? I mean, asking for a gratuity is fair. However, requesting a specific amount is just plain stupid in my opinion.We also got some vodka drink from the bar, which was like $10 or $12. I forgot. The bartender said it is very strong and it was lychee, cranberries and other stuff soaked in vodka for days. However, whatever she mixed for us just tasted like very watered down vodka with no taste of lychee or cranberry whatsoever. Not worth the price. Also, there is a $20 minimum if you are paying with credit card.The reason why I did give this place an extra star was because the decor and the space didn't look that bad. Also, the bouncer or whoever was at the door towards the end of the night was super sweet and nice. One of my friends left a water bottle inside at the bar and he offered to run back inside and help him get it. I think it would have worked out if the music did not SUCK and if the drinks were cheaper. Also, don't say the champagne is complimentary if you are going to ask for a $20 tip. Even as I left the place at around 12:15, the back was practically empty and it was far from filling up. I think I would have been better off visiting my local liquor store and getting myself a bottle of Moscato for $12 and popping it myself and enjoying it with my friends. I don't mind coming back here as long as the music doesn't suck, but just like there are plenty of fish in the sea, there are plenty of other clubs and lounges in the LES.",2,,

The music is good and they hand out big glow sticks, which is kind of fun, and their A/C was surprisingly good for a very crowded bar in June... but that's about it for the positives.My complaints are mostly with the service. The bartender gave us a rude comment for only tipping a dollar when we ordered two beers... I understand that wasn't the most generous tip, but the drinks were overpriced and all he had to do was open the bottle, he didn't mix anything fancy.  Other friends of mine got similar comments. Also, when I was there for a birthday in the winter, a bouncer told us we couldn't leave our coats at our table, and the coat check was mandatory. If we were paying for a table and bottle service, I'd think we could determine how to use that space, but instead we were coerced into paying for coat check.The space is pretty narrow and gets crowded very quickly, with people surrounding the bars and the tables, and not tons of room in between to dance.Overall, I'd come back here if I get invited to another party here (which seems likely based on their birthday bottle service deals), but I wouldn't otherwise.",1,,

Essentially, this place is not what I was expecting as per its website, which made it out to be a glam, upscale lounge.At the end of the day the company makes any place worthwhile, but I personally would never go here again just because of the bathroom situation.",,,
90,Marissa H.,"Manhattan, NY",175,10,0,5.0,5/5/2013,"This past Thursday I was freaking out about where to celebrate my birthday this Saturday night.. and I only had a day and a half to figure it out. My friend mentioned that I could try Birthday Bottle Service. birthdaybottleservice.com I filled out the form on their website around 6 pm on a Thursday night and heard back by Cristina with in two hours. She e-mailed me back saying that the venue I requested (Actors Play House) had a large volume of reservations but she still would be happy to make a reservation for me but then also suggested two other venues (Gallery Bar & Open House) that are also downtown that had less reservations. I decided to choose to make a reservation for Open House through Cristina and by Friday after noon I was contacted by Abe that I had a reservation for Open House for 10-15 people between 11-11:30 for my 22nd birthday. It couldn't have gotten any easier, and I was so excited for my birthday again. Last night we got to Open House around 11:20, as our reservation was for 11:30.. we didn't want to test the bouncers so 7 of us were there all at once. The bouncers were extremely nice and did not give us any trouble about the entire party not being there. The hostess than got us seated at our table immediately and it was pretty dead but we expected that.. and the place quickly filled up. We did have to pay $20 for the service of the hostess, but honestly that was a steal, and I was happy to pay it seeing how nice every one was. At midnight when I turned 22 the hostess brought out a sparkler and a complimentary bottle of champagne. Also my friends were dancing on the couches and occasionally falling off but the bouncers inside were super sweet and weren't bothered by how rambunctious we were being. Through out the night, up until we left at 3:30 another 10 of my friends, and friends friends came to join our party and all got in with out a problem. The bartenders were also so sweet! All of my friends and I used the complimentary drink voucher from checking in on yelp and they didn't seem bothered. I also thought that there was a great mixture of people there, plenty of cute guys, and the music was one amazing song after another. Also the glow in the dark flashing styrofoam wands they gave us and the rest of the room a million of was so fun to play with, and just made every thing else that much more amazing. I promise I was not paid to write this :) but I owe every one from Birthday Bottle Service and Open House for making my 22nd birthday my best birthday yet.",1,,
91,Amanda D.,"Manhattan, NY",3,1,0,5.0,12/17/2013,This place is awesome with a great vibe. I am an event planner and worked with Rob on a private event. He was very responsive to all our emails and worked with us to fit the budget we were given. Had a great night with some awesome specialty cocktails!  We will continue to work with Open House to host events in the future. Great time had by all :),,,
92,Bill E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,9/15/2012,"This place is a MUST STAY AWAY. I took a friend to the bottomless tequila night last Thursday. What a rip! One rude bartender who was as slow as paint drying.We waited for 12 minutes before I literally had to wave my arms to get his attention. He proceeds to come down and tell us ""not to wave at him"" We must wait until he gets to us. If I hadn't already paid for this stupid coupon I would have told him to ....So you cant order a specific drink. He makes what he feels like and serves it. Drinks were awful tasting. He spent the majority of his time at one end of the bar trying to snake a couple of girls at the other end. After an hour of this we decide to finish and go to a place around the corner which had better service and drinks.Keep walking right past this dump. Loud annoying house music.Rude service.To top it all of a big ""F U"" to the dumb girl who said she was a lawyer and proceeding to stick her disgusting fingers in my drink and take my ice cube out. The rude bitch didn't even have enough brains to apologize and pay for a new drink. Hope you had the runs all next day.",2,2,
93,Carl B.,"New York, NY",1,11,2,1.0,11/19/2011,"NEVER AGAIN!!!! THIS PLACE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  We went with a party of about 40 people and the manager/owner ""Lance"" was a complete beeetch.  Selectively not letting some our  party in because (according to her) she was trying to protect the ""image""  and she was making a point.....""  Although she was the one rocking kitten heels and a beanie.   The music was alright, but we requested half of the songs.  When we got in the place was EMPTY.  WASTE OF TIME. Luckily  One of the bartenders was really cool and hooked us up with drinks for the difficult times getting in but besides that this place sucks. AND no dancing, whatsoever.",,,
94,Jimmy J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/14/2012,"One of the worst bars i've ever experienced. this place belongs in cleveland, not nyc, it's so lame. WARNING: DO NOT GO HERE. staff is horrible, people are shitty -- all around terrible place.I'd suggest Ella around the corner on Ave A or all the other bars on Ave A for that matter.REPEAT: SAVE YOUR MONEY, GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!",,,
95,Kiki J.,"Atlanta, GA",53,255,2,3.0,1/14/2012,"This place has a bit of a split personality.  Its definitely trying to be a club (velvet rope, bottle service), but the space is tiny and the service here is friendly.  Come before it fills up to linger over drinks and enjoy the music and interesting decor.  Leave before the place fills to capacity and there is no room to move.",4,,2
96,S M.,"North Bergen, NJ",1,28,0,2.0,8/11/2012,"Forgot to close tab - shame on me. Requested that a friend close the tab for me. Gave all the info: my address on my license, last 4 digits of credit card, expiration date & security code on back. Request denied. Paid $40 in cabs just to close a $56 tab. very annoyed. oh yeah and the sound system sucks - no bass and treble so high that i can feel my eardrums starting to rip. had some great nights here even when it used to be Stay Lounge - so unfortunate.",1,,
