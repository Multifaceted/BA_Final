0,Ann K.,"Columbia, MD",60,364,722,4.0,11/5/2018,Great view of Brooklyn and the river. It is under the FDR street. You can stroll along the river between the south seaport area Pier 17 and 11 and take a ferry to enjoy the NYC skyline. The pizza and salad are great.,,,
1,Anacleto B.,"New York, NY",243,52,90,4.0,11/2/2018,"I was ready to throw the book at 'em... but they pulled it together. More on that later. The place is close to the water and has some really nice views of the water and walkways. Floor to ceiling windows and outdoor seating all drew me to this place as an option for a group dinner. The issue was we were considering this place as well as two others in the vicinity. So, tactical error No. 1 was that we didn't have a reservation beforehand. Tactical error No. 2 was walking up and asking for an interior table and giving away the fact that we didn't have a reservation. So we were seated outside after asking the hostess to notify us of availability inside. While we waited I checked Open Table to see if they were listed and what the situation was. Voila! I was able to make a reservation on the spot with specifications to eat inside (it was brick outside). Checkmate right?! ... Wrong. I brought this up to the hostess but she once again declined to seat us inside. *Sigh* So we observed the goings on for a while and then saw a gentleman who looked like the manager. I figured when the hostess was away from the podium, I'd slide on over to him. I thought I timed it right but she came back to quickly. Just as I was about to make my case to her again, the manager chimed in to ask if I was being helped and if I had a reservation. ... Why yes Mr. Manager, I do. The hostess made her case saying that others had made reservations before my crew and therefore had the right of way. The manager, in turn, vetoed her decision and sat us regardless because those other groups hadn't arrived and we were here and ready to go. He saved the night. Of the two other groups in the queue, one didn't show up for an hour. The other came at a time where the restaurant was emptying so there was plenty of room. So anyways, the food was mostly good. I ordered the Bacon Sweet Potato Wood Fired Pizza (cheddar, rosemary, chipotle aioli, chives). It comes on a huge wooden platter. Two neighboring tables saw and immediately asked us what we had ordered. The drinks were solid but one of my crew mates didn't like their pasta and sent it back. I tasted it and didn't have an issue so take that with a grain of salt (no pun intended). Bottom line: #RSVPfirstThinkLater. If you have to cancel, you can cancel any time. Just don't show up without that resy. They're sticklers for it!",,,
2,Kevin T.,"New York, NY",281,70,173,4.0,10/30/2018,"Honestly came here more for the seaport vibes than the food - and was right since the pizza we got ended up being lackluster. The mussels were fantastic however. Make sure to have a reservation, as this place gets extremely busy during happy hour.",,,
3,Hanna T.,"New York, NY",7,60,561,2.0,10/1/2018,"Awesome location, perfect place to eat on a nice day. It's right on the water with a view of the river and the Brooklyn Bridge. The walls open up completely to make even the inside feel like outdoor seating. However, my rating is in regards to the food. Absolutely terrible. I only got the Margherita pizza, so I can only attest to that but honestly it was DiGiornio frozen pizza quality. Not what I expected from a place that sells a $2000 gold pizza. I could tell just by looking at the sloppy, thick crust that it wasn't going to be good. Sauce: gross, like dominoes. Cheese: ok. Crust: horrendous. Hard pass",1,,
4,Jason M.,"Manhattan, NY",8,52,33,3.0,10/14/2018,"Nice place for a drink and dinner. Food is fine but don't expect the food to be why you go, rather the views and the setting. The soppresatta pizza was fine but not spectacular. The lamb skewer was fine as well albeit a bit small for the price.",1,,
5,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,3.0,7/30/2018,"On Sunday around 2pm we were seated immediately. The place was spacious, very attractive with plenty of outdoor seating and a nice bar. The food and drinks were expensive. I got the goat cheese pizza which is large enough to share between 2. It was not what I expected. The pizza was more like a thin round cracker with goat cheese smeared on top, sauteed mushrooms and lots of arugula. The cut was super uneven and they could use more truffle oil. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for an actual wood fired pizza. Service needs improvement. I don't have a reason to return.",3,1,3
6,Sue L.,"Brooklyn, NY",78,63,20,4.0,9/23/2018,"The best time to go there is at night during the summer/early fall when the weather isn't too hot/cold. I love the view of the water. It's a nice place to go with friends on a Friday night. I had the seasonal dips (creamy ricotta and a artichoke hummus), pot of mussels cooked in white wine. The smoked salmon pizza was amazing! There was fresh dill and cream fraiche on it. It's better than your average pizza. You must try it at least once in your life. If you like it, then you may end up eating it more than once. I guarantee that you'll like it. It's one of the best smoked salmon pizzas I've ever had.",1,1,
7,Ruth U.,"New York, NY",33,175,227,4.0,10/29/2018,Gorgeous view of the water. Ordered a margherita pizza that really hit the spot along with two breakfast dishes. They made a mistake with my order and were quick to fix it. Great service. Excellent food.,,,
8,Maya T.,"Brooklyn, NY",284,336,80,3.0,5/27/2018,"This place was OK. Ambience is absolutely the best part of it, and the waiter was so very friendly and attentive to our group, but the food was just --- meh. My boyfriend ordered pizza, my girlfriend ordered watermelon soup, her beau ordered avocado toast and I got the watermelon feta salad. The drinks (Sangria, white wine and beer) we're are great. The food, was, sadly, dissapointing. My friend never ate her watermelon soup. Avo toast was pretty flimsy and unsatisfying. Boyfriend felt his pizza was sub-par and as for me - my quote simple watermelon salad was refreshing, but it's watermelon and feta cheese so it's pretty difficult to mess up. If I came back, it would be for drinks.....and maybe an appetizer. I would not recommend for food, but a date, catching up with friends or just a nice outside day drinking time would be perfectly fine",5,,3

We also had the cheese platter &  Shishito peppers for apps.For the meals, I had the cesar salad which was great, and the client had the chargrilled octopus. Both were delicious!Only downfall- you can't add chicken to your salad? Never heard of this at a restaurant before..",,,1

13,Devin B.,"New York, NY",427,114,8,2.0,8/6/2018,"Industry Kitchen has some great views and the restaurant itself is very aesthetically pleasing, but the food definitely does not live up to the hype. My girlfriend and I ordered the mussels and the Diablo Pizza, both of which were pretty average. The sauce they cooked the mussels in was too thin and didn't have much flavor. The pizza crust was way too thick and doughy and they were pretty skimpy with the cheese. It's not easy to compete with the elite pizza joints in NYC, but the pizza here barely comes close to competing with dollar slices. In fact, I think I'd rather have a dollar slice than this ""fancy"" pizza. Thankfully the service was pretty decent considering the restaurant was packed. It would be nice if they spaced the tables out some more though because I had almost no room at all and it felt like I was sitting at the same table as the people next to me. Probably not a bad spot for a drink, but skip the food.",1,1,1
14,Rafic K.,"Montreal, Canada",33,40,18,4.0,5/21/2018,"We were a party of 4 and we sat on the patio outside. Didn't have to wait at all on a Saturday afternoon. The place has a nice view to the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge, but at one point we noticed a faint smell of ocean fish.Tried 2 pizzas: the Herbed Goat Cheese pizza and the Hot Abricot pizza. The latter was much more impressive and had a unique mixture of abricot and mildly hot sauce. The pizza crust was average tasting in my opinion.The atmosphere was nice and service was good.",,,

We were seated outside, which was perfect given the beautiful weather outside. It's a restaurant with plenty of space, so we didn't feel crowded despite the amount of people there.The restaurant is by the water, which was beautiful, but it's also just under a highway, which didn't help the aesthetic or surrounding noise. Because we had a larger party we decided to split three different pizzas - Margherita, Hot Apricot, and Bianca. They were all tasty, but not exceptional. So it is a bit over-priced. I didn't notice anything particularly inclusive about their menu or setting, but its outdoor setting is handicap-friendly and there were plenty of yummy vegetarian options. It was a great lunch spot with a beautiful, casual setting so I would still recommend it for those looking for a bite to eat on a sunny day.",1,,
16,Tiffany W.,"Philadelphia, PA",294,55,71,3.0,7/23/2018,"Industry Kitchen has an undeniably great aesthetic and a stand-out view of the river. There are plenty of seats for outdoor seating on a nice day, and the service is good and very thorough. Unfortunately, I thought the food was meh at best.I went with co-workers, and we decided to split the king crab cake salad and multiple pizzas - the margherita pizza, the bacon sweet potato pizza, and the soppressata picante (which came with shaved Pecorino and garlic). The crab cake salad was very disappointing. For its high price ($18), there was only one small crab cake on top of a bed of lettuce. The pizzas were better, but there was nothing special about them. You could definitely find other places with the similar pizzas for a far lower price.While the location is fantastic, the food is both overpriced and not worth the cost. If you're in the Financial District, there are better places by far to visit.",1,,
17,Demi H.,"New York, NY",6,69,52,3.0,6/24/2018,"I wish I could rate Industry Kitchen 5 stars but it never quite pleases me or my guests. I have frequented this spot 3 times in hopes of it getting better - unfortunately, the restaurant is very overrated.The atmosphere alone is amazing, the seating outside is comfortable and clean, the music is good and the view is superb. The wait staff is very slow, every time I have gone I experience an extensive wait on the server and the food. Food is incredibly over priced for the quality - I guess this is due to the location. For a NY restaurant the pizza really slacks in flavor and consistency. Many times the pizza was soggy and unappealing. The mussels were tasty, but very basic.I have also visited for Brunch, the menu is not as extensive as lunch/dinner and not that appealing. The omelette did not have much taste to it. Overall, this is a good place to take a friend visiting from out of town for a quick drink but skip the overpriced low quality food.",3,,

19,Ana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,104,225,5.0,9/22/2018,"My new favorite place to come when I'm in the area, I have to say I'm glad we walked by. The manager Aylon was incredible, very welcoming (with a smile) also he was very knowledgeable about service dogs and also informed his new employee about them. I can really appreciate that because my dog is a service dog and alot of employee or employers dont know the rules behind it and so he did. He sat us right outside and we enjoyed a lovely view of the city while they attended my dog with a bowl of water ( I loved that, so did milo) as we sat, we had a really nice conversation with Aylon while we waited to order (which didnt take long) we started with drinks and to my surprise they had my absolute best chardonnay wine and so i had to order the small bottle, the price was reasonable, also for appetizers we had a garlic truffle bread which was to die for. Wanted to eat it all but I'm on a diet (again). For my main meal I ordered a kale quinoa salad that was recommended by shaq ( I believe that was his name) the waiter ( he was the best and pleasant to look at, also with a lovely smile). Omg that salad hit the spot. It was very fresh and crunchy. The kale was seasoned and the plating was beautifully made. I would definitely return 4xs over to this place. Good for small surprise birthdays and anniversaries. Come see aylon you won't be disappointed! Thank you",,,1
20,Lisa L.,"Williamsburg, NY",22,167,418,1.0,5/29/2018,"terrible terrible service. all I asked was to sit outside on the patio after work on a nice spring day, even made a reservation. but when i checked in (ahead of reservation time) they told me it was an additional one hr wait because every one just sat down. so we sat in the corner under the bridge with the loud banging noise of skateboards. before I even get water to the table, I get up to use the bathroom and lo and behold, empty table right where I want it. so I ask again if we can be seated there and she says simply because we got seated already (two mins ago) that they cannot move us because it messes up the kitchen orders (even tho we didn't even get water yet). and nevermind that they gave us the wrong information to begin with when we first agreed to be seated. so yea... I'm starting off my meal with this kind of  attitude.as for food.. pizza lukewarm on arrival. crust mediocre. thin thin GRIMEY layer of cheese. out of vodka at 6pm on tues so two out of their seven cocktails are unavailable. and overpriced.",4,2,

I've visited several times over the past few years but keep forgetting to write a review because the food and service is what should always be expected, good. However , this evening , was hands down a truly memorable dining experience. The drinks ( summer house and froze ) were deliciously refreshing and well put together. The server was knowledgeable and guided us towards dishes that were tasty and hit all the right notes. We enjoyed the diablo pizza , octopus salad , lamb shank and my constant repeat item... the floating garlic bread , yummmmmy! Service , food , and the manager  who checked on us , Isandro , made this evening unforgettable for a pair of friends who had not seen each other in ages ! Thank you Industry kitchen for the memories ! Highly recommend!",,1,
22,Mary Catherine B.,"New York, NY",1,4,2,2.0,8/29/2018,"Listen -- the view of the water is absolutely breathtaking! The drink Summer House is as it sounds: refreshing, balance of sweet and tart, and has vodka, so zero complaints there, I was super into the first part of my visit: at the bar overlooking the view. Went on a Friday night and the volume of the space (mainly the music) was a little too loud to comfortably converse as a table. The cheesy garlic bread was great flavor wise (I mean, cheese and bread!) but half was burnt on the bottom. I had potatoes with my chicken and same thing, half were burnt. Maybe the wood oven situation? The chicken was fine -- nothing to write home about. The rest of the food at the table seemed fine, but again -- nothing to come back for. The big reason for a low rating and why I won't return: someone wanted to order the Lobster Fumet. She checked with the waiter to make sure that the pasta dish did have lobster meat, considering the description listed all other seafood minus the lobster. Server confirmed the pasta has lobster meat. Pasta came with no lobster meat but instead an empty lobster head shell on top. I don't know if the waiter was misinformed or if they simply forgot to put the lobster in the pasta -- but that's kind of a big piece of this dish. Overall, not the worst place I've been but not somewhere I'll go out of my way to visit again. Let's get real, I'm not frequenting South Street on the regular, and next time I'm pulled to the area I'll try one of the many other options available.",1,1,

We told the hostess that we were looking to order pizza, apps and drinks. She quickly guided us to the bar area while saying that the tables were for ""real full"" meals. Sitting at a 1 foot diameter high top with 2 kids is not easy. Meanwhile there was a couple having the same meal as us taking up an entire 4 person table. Made us feel second rate. As for the food, we ordered the margarita pizza pie which was good and by itself a 4 out of 5. Wine was a bit overpriced at $13 a glass for a Sav Blanc that my wine shop carries for $11. Overall the setting/decor is nice and the food is decent though prices are high. The server was nice and came by a few times to check in on us.

The drinks we ordered were good, and around the same price as most restaurants in the city. Food was decent- the presentation was nice, but the portions could have been a bit larger for what we paid. My friend ordered a pasta, and the noodles were al dente. I ordered a lemon chicken, which was dry, but the lemon on the side gave a good flavor.

Updated review",I would have given this establishment 5 stars but the service sucked. We saw people walk out. Sat down for lunch. Server came in about a minute and asked if we need more time- yes a few minutes. Didn't see her for another 15. We gave our order to someone else. Anyway- blistered peppers were amazing. Never had anything like that. Jalapeño looking peppers but just a hint of spice- coarse salt and lemon. Incredible. My calamari salad was excellent. Beautiful presentation.  Friends gnocchi also delicious. Maybe a few slices of bread on the table would have been nice. I'd love to go back but not sure. Place was a bit pretentious but great view and spot. First time back at the seaport since Sandy. ******** returned the following week for lunch--. Service was polar opposite. Stellar service and once again amazing food. Hangar steak with potatoes -just incredibly delicious and tender. Good pizza as well. Delicious coffee. The burnt sugar ice cream in a pastry puff was beyond amazing. Drizzled with chocolate at the table. Big enough for 4. Will totally return.,,,

Updated review","New review:Changing the amount of stars (giving maximum) thanks to Eilon (the very hot Israeli host we just had) for our Sunday brunch and the much improved service, food quality and better/lower decibel background music Old review:We just gave  this place another chance and after an improvement by the then manager Stephen the service is gone down again. Maybe they changed the manager ??Anyway we were turned away this last time and told in a very dismissive way by the girl at the door who said that the kitchen was closed .It was 8:55. On the Yelp info it says it's open until 11pm. (If the kitchen closes at 9 please update info).I wonder ..... Anyway they just couldn't care less again.Maybe because the warm weather is coming and they know they can fill the outside space with tourists anyway and they don't need locals.Just my guess . To the now manager (I doubt it's Stephen): train those girls at the entrance to at least pretend to care about the business ..",3,,3
30,Matthew R.,"New York, NY",10,35,3,1.0,6/18/2018,"Tourist trap. If you live in NYC, then do not come here. And if you are a tourist seeking a view and a drink/bite, then please note that there is absolutely nothing NYC unique about this place that makes it worth a visit. Sure the view is nice, but there are far better restaurants and bars with views that put Industry Kitchen to shame. This review focuses on the poor service we received. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to try the food (nor the drinks, but I'll get to that part in a bit). My friend and I stumbled upon Industry Kitchen while taking a walk on a Saturday. As we approached the restaurant, we noticed a large group of basic gals celebrating their friend's 40th birthday. We knew they were celebrating her 40th because they had gigantic balloons with the number 40 on them. We should have seen this as God's warning to not go in. And for my friends reading: please never get balloons revealing my age for my 40th birthday.Anyways, these gals had taken up most of the outdoor space and whatever was left was taken up by families and screaming children. We sat inside and immediately noticed how ridiculously expensive all the drinks were, so we decided the most economical choice would be to get the shareable Blue Mule cocktail for $65 for the two of us. After putting in our order for drinks, ten minutes went by, twenty minutes went by, and pretty soon we were almost at thirty minutes. Our waitress apologized for the wait and promised us that our massive bowl of blue fun should be out very soon. Another ten minutes went by and we asked to speak to the manager. He explained that the special bowl that they use for the drink was being used by another party (the 40 gals) and they thought it would have been finished sooner so that they could give it to us. His explanation was odd for several reasons. For starters, why do you have such a limited amount of bowls if the drink is so popular? Why didn't you tell us from the very beginning that there may be a wait for that particular drink?The manager--very reluctantly, I might add--offered us two free drinks to make up for the wait. We accepted and once again ten minutes went by, fifteen, and at this point we knew what to do: leave. We packed up our belongings and walked out, which is something I have never done before. We were beyond patient with Industry Kitchen and they failed.  Note to the manager: if you screw up and then you do something nice to make up for the mistake, then you make that nice gesture a priority.",4,2,

It's an excellent spot to hang out with friends, grab a drink, and order some appetizers. Came here with my fiancé, her uncle, and his girlfriend for Sunday dinner at 630pm. We did not make reservations so the host told us the wait will be 25 minutes. We waited for 50 minutes. Once we got seated, we decided that we were going to do appetizers. Their appetizers are excellent. We ordered the Chilled Berry Soup since none of us never had it. Not so bad, but I felt like we were having dessert. It's grapes, avocado, and berry jus. The Floating Island Garlic Bread was excellent. It's made with Asiago, creamy Gorgonzola, and truffle shavings. The only bad thing was it took forever to come out. The Chargrilled Octopus, one of their best appetizer. It's served with chorizo, olive oil, garlic, oregano, and baby potatoes. Only one leg is served. Now, the best for last! The Pot of Mussels, their best dish in the restaurant. It's served with shallots, butter, garlic, white wine, cilantro, and herbed focaccia.Unfortunately, the service wasn't as great. Our waiter kept forgetting about us. He came to our table to take our order and to bring our orders. That's it. He did not once come back and asked how we were doing. For dessert we had to look for him to take our order. We ordered the the chocolate river, which was not so good. The chocolate cake did not have melted chocolate inside.",2,,

The food was pretty average, which I guess I sort of expected, but it was fine because the atmosphere made up for it. I came with a group for lunch and ordered the kale salad which consists of quinoa, pomegranate, watermelon radish, pickled onion, feta, orange, toasted almonds, and cider vinaigrette. It wasn't bad except I felt like I was just eating kale the whole time. Wouldn't order that again. I was able to try the Lasagna San Gennero which I enjoyed.

Blistered Shishito Peppers and Grilled Calamari with Quinoa, both done very well. I went for the cocktails because they had a measly 2 white wines by the glass. The Pistachio Mule was strangely perfumey. I like all the ingredients, but maybe it was the combination; vodka, pistachio, lime and ginger beer. Couldn't figure out what made it taste like that - weird. The Summer House was a bit sweet for my taste. Experimenting is not my strong suit. Lively vibe and very nice wait staff.",,,

But, there are also reasons why it's only 3 stars. First, the food was pretty typical and nothing special. I got the lobster omelette, and the best thing about it was that there was actually large chunks of lobster in it that you could see and taste. But otherwise, the menu was very typical brunch foods and pizza. The service wasn't that great. We had made a reservation, and it wasn't ready when we arrived. We had a baby with us who needed a high chair and the high chair buckles were broken (none of the others were working either). Finally, we had a dog and they were accommodating, but we also got chided for bringing a dog and not telling them ahead of time since we made a reservation (which wasn't even ready anyway and they had empty tables) so overall, they could use some improvement in the service part.",1,1,

The location right by the ferry is great and the ambiance in the restaurant is awesome.  Industry kitchen is always vibrant with either inside or outside seating and it typically filled with a good crowd.The food its self is excellent just don't anticipate being able to make simple changes without being met with contention. Simple requests like can I get one of the 90000 pizzas you offer with just cheese is not nearly as simple as one would thinkfor being a place that does the alcohol volume that i does its missing a lot of quintessential liquors (they have nothing peach flavored for example)TLDR: The staff is hit or miss, missing more often than hitting.  The food is excellent BUT substituting or removing anything is a pain. The location, view, energy and ambiance are awesome, but the drink selection is lacking.  (I can get a $2000 pizza and add $700 worth of caviar but they don't have St Germain lol)Overall, nothing is subpar enough to keep us from returning",1,,2

Although the food was a miss, I will admit that the space is gorgeous. We were seated in the dining section of the restaurant and could see the Hudson from our table. I probably won't be returning for the food, but I would be open to visiting the bar section. They had a fairly extensive drink menu and a spacious seating area.",2,,1

Drink specials here are non existent and a $14 frosé was a little steep for my liking especially considering there are happy hour specials all around this area. Ordered a chicken Caesar salad, but they can't add chicken to their salads (doesn't make any sense) but you can order an $18 chicken plate and change the salad as your side. (Steep salad). The steak was AMAZING, the fried potato side was great too. A little bit expensive considering the other spots in the are, but you are paying for your view. Not bad, only giving 3 stars because of silly price points and menu options. But all in all, the food is great and this is definitely a must go to spot in the area as long as the weather cooperates.",1,,

Offered me a table outside in the shade which any other day might great by the Seaport, but it was 85 degrees with high humidity and no breeze. Opted for inside. A/C was not that cool in the beginning but was bearable as we sat. Wait staff was pleasant and attentive. We chose 2 starters and split the margarita pizza. Food was well presented and tasty. All in all a very nice place for lunch and/or dinner but loses 1 star because the place is so LOUD! I mean very LOUD. Another problem is seating area is very narrow and tight.

We sat in the bar area to wait for a friend, it was not busy at all, service was very casual almost too casual we never got the appetizer we ordered bartender did not bring drinks to table had to go to the bar to get drinks. We went into dinner and found it to be really loud in the dining area. We got a margherita pizza Bianca Pizza  that were good for sharing. I was not a big fan of the crust but the other people liked it . I thought it kind of dry and undercooked..The potato appetizer was really good lots of great flavor. The cocktail tail was passion fruit $14.00 a little steep in price but we are not from NYC so that probably what it cost. In warmer weather the deck would be a great option with a nice view , probably would not go back for the pizza.",,,1

Updated review","Really good spot by the redeveloped South Street Sea port. Had fire oven pizza, steak, n mussels, all very good. And the service was excellent. The place is right on the water front with a view of Brooklyn bridge park. From the Brooklyn side it's hard to appreciate how really nice this side of Manhattan is. The water front throughout the city is finally being utilized for the asset it really is. And the best part of it is, it can't be outsourced away.",,,
54,Sigal L.,"Wauwatosa, WI",1,39,31,5.0,4/19/2018,"I can't speak highly enough of this restaurant. First of all our party of 6 walked in without calling ahead and when a hostess wasn't sure if she'd be able to accommodate us the manager came and assured us it would be no problem. He led us into the bar area where they have a few two seater tabletops against a bench wall. He just pushed together a few tables and said he'd make sure we were taken care of. My nine year old son even recognized how well we were being treated when they could have easily turned us away. He said ""I've never felt so respected by a manager before"". I regret that I didn't get the managers name. Our waiter, David, was extremely helpful, from choosing our drinks to our dinner selections. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the food was delicious. He heard my family speak in our native tongue and he just so happens to have been raised in the same country so he spoke to us in the same language. Even though New York is a melting pot and it wasn't the first time we'd heard someone speak the same language, it was so nice to find someone from the same country and share that connection. The young man refilling our water, Emon I believe his name is, was so attentive as well. If it hadn't been our last night in New York we would have come back because the food, service and overall atmosphere was impeccable.",2,,2

It was a bit crowded, a lot of the tables were reserved so we opted for bar seating. I ordered a pinot grigio and my friend ordered one of the beers on tap (no specials). It was an overcast day, but warm enough to enjoy the breezy, cool air, and of course the views of the east river. It feels as though you're not in busy Manhattan, but rather a boardwalk on the West Coast; this may be a stretch, but it's what I was envisioning on my lunch break. :)My friend and I split an appetizer and a salad for lunch. We had the Spanish Artichoke & Creamy Ricotta dip w/ Focaccia bread; the two dips were very tasty and creamy as described, I wish the focaccia was hot and crispy, it was just cold slices of bread with not much flavor. Second, we had the Cobb salad, this was your typical cobb, it was very good, perfect for two people to split, the dressing was very light, if you like a lot of dressing I suggest you order extra on the side. The bill came out to $54, which isn't too bad. I would go back for happy hour cocktails and to watch the sunset for sure.",,,2
68,Martin N.,"New York, NY",398,85,163,2.0,8/19/2017,"Expensive price for decent food. I felt that the price did not reflect the quality of food. Yes, it was not bad, but I feel like you don't get what you paid for. Given my low student budget, I only got an appetizer of pure bacon, which itself was already $8 (a meal in my books). The customer service was above average as the waiter was very accommodating to us wanting to sit outside in the front patio with the sofas given our group size of 8. The pizzas looked and tasted pretty good, but this is more like a one-time-thing rather than somewhere you go to when you are hungry.",2,2,

The pizza was very doughy, almost like it was on a pita bread. The mozzarella & ricotta seemed basic in terms of taste.Service was not good. Waiter was not attentive. There was 4 of us and the table only had 2 plates with utensils.  I asked for another plate and they literally gave me 1 more plate and walks away. Took awhile to get heir attention again and had to ask for a 2nd plate. Ok so you would think that they noticed that our plates needed utensils and they'd give it to us BUT they came back with another ""plate"". At this point we're like what the heck?!

They were SO GOOD!!!! Pizza was good and the dip was delicious also. Overall a fun ambience for drinks and food in the water. Very cool happy hour spot.",1,,

The restaurant staff also seem unconcerned with customers' needs. The space and views have the potential of being great but the staff, food and menu need an overhaul. Someone who knows what they are doing needs to come in and take over. Oh the icing on the cake was the stuff floating in my soda glass  and it's perpetual state of dirtiness.",1,2,1
94,R S.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,2.0,4/15/2018,"OH. MY. GOD.  What a train wreck.  The two stars are generous, which are for the food (which isn't bad at all) and the location/view.  If the rating was for customer service, I'd have to ask Yelp to create a negative stars option.We made a reservation for a large party (10) for my teen daughter's birthday this past Saturday.  The manager told my wife that there was only one inside table that could accommodate a party of our size, but as it was available at 6:30, we made the reservation.When we arrived a few minutes early (given that various members of our party would be arriving separately) we were told that our table was not and would not be available, as ""the prior party was taking a little longer to finish than we expected"".  We would subsequently observe that this party was just getting their first course 15 minutes after we arrived, so clearly the restaurant had given our table away (they finished over an hour into our meal).My wife's eagle eyes had observed two tables perpendicular to each other (6 and 4 tops, respectively) that would do and so we suggested we take those instead.  After being seated, we noted throughout the course of the meal the bussers would pick up any half-consumed item (even if it was still being ""worked on"") without asking the patron if they were finished.  This got annoying fast.The coup de grace was when my daughter started opening her birthday presents (at the six top table) and we were serving birthday cake, which the restaurant had graciously stored for us.  Our party stood closer to her table at this time, during which the bussers started clearing the four top (where I was still sitting sideways, facing the other table), presumably so the cake could be served.  I found it odd that they re-set the table as if for another party, but it didn't really register in real time.  A few minutes later it all made sense as the hostess tried to seat another party WHILE WE WERE STILL SITTING THERE!  We explained we weren't done with our meal and they had to walk the other party back to the front -- awkward.  The manager came over shortly thereafter and was about to launch into his ""can I ask for your help"" speech when I cut him off and said, ""No, sorry, you gave our table away -- absolutely not"".  The rest of the meal passed without incident but all of this certainly left a bad taste in our mouths (pun intended).This is a place I'd really like to give a good review.  We are longtime downtowners, our kids are in school down the street, and as I noted the food is more than passable and the views and outdoor space are lovely.  But the combination of tourist and hipster patrons seems to have given management the belief that they get a ""pass"" on providing good (or at least conventional) service.  I will note that our waitress was very good, so the potential is clearly there, but this place is in serious need of an attitude adjustment.",7,,

A little overpriced, but that's to be expected with the location.Also, midway up the side of every cup there was a ring of what seemed like dirt. It was a little disconcerting.",1,,
96,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,5.0,8/23/2016,"Industry Kitchen is a great riverfront bar & grill in lower Manhattan (near-ish South Street Seaport). I've been a couple of times now--once for happy hour cocktails and once for an event--and both times were spot on. Normally, I start most of my reviews talking about food and drinks (and I'll get to those later), but the thing that sets this place apart from other places nearby is the spectacular view. IK is built on the East River and the views are just amazing... both inside the place as well as from the patio seating (which is even closer to the river and has even better views). Now, let's get to the food. First off, I have to set one thing straight: If you're thinking of going here for a romantic dinner, IMHO, this is not your place. Sure, they have wood fire pizzas, but most of the food is what I refer to as bar bites... BUT they are some damn good bar bites... especially the artichoke & ricotta dips and the pizzas! I also hear they have a pretty good brunch, but I haven't tried it. Perhaps that will be for my next trip.As for drinks, they are pretty good as well. They feature a full bar, so they have just about anything you could want. All they need to improve here is a killer happy hour. How about throwing us a bone with some half-priced bottles of wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays! I'd be up for that.Oh, and before I close, I must mention the awesome staff at IK. The bartenders, wait staff, and management seem to all be really first-rate.... even when the place is super packed. This actually came as a bit of a surprise at the event I attended b/c it was pretty much out of control with customers... but low and behold, someone from the IK staff always appeared suddenly out of nowhere to take care of me just when I needed it.",8,2,3

And it happened despite the fact that it was barely cooked and mostly rare on the inside. I think somehow they don't realize how dense this steak truly is and didn't cook it long enough to get to the middle. It's truly a 3lb gargantuan piece of meat that tastes kind of like a roast. I'm not sure how it's seasoned.The hanger steak was spritzed all over with micro greens. They seem to love them, every dish gets finished in little greens. The garlic butter is covered on the top and the potato curls while cute, tasted like they were recently frozen. They're literally spiraled chunks of potato that are fried but I guess they're not freshly made. The space itself is cute and truly industrial. I wanted more from the food. Maybe the pizza is better? The rosemary bread slices they give are alright especially with rosemary olive oil. Probably my favorite thing here overall. I'd probably just stick to the pizza and apps to really have a solid meal based on this trip alone.",,,

We used a popular app to make a 'table' reservation (this gives away the app we used). There were plenty of tables / time slots available, but unfortunately, when we arrived, all the available tables were directly under the sun. I wish they had adjusted their table inventory so fewer were showing available, since we ended up on a wait list which lasted 15 minutes. Not the end of the world, but we were there on time.We got a decent table outside in the shaded area and ordered a beer and two dishes. First, a chorizo omelette which was tasty but very small. Not a ripoff by any means since the price was reasonable for NYC ($14), but would rather pay a little more for more than a bite-sized meal.The main disappointment was the goat cheese, arugula and wild mushroom pizza. The toppings themselves were good and in a reasonable quantity, but the dough was dense, not that warm temperature-wise and didn't taste fresh. Could have been bought in any grocery store. I wouldn't consider it even as a flatbread. I saw other options in tables nearby which looked better due to different toppings and sauce (mine didn't have any sauce but the waiter was nice and brought us some red sauce on the side - we asked for it when placing the order). All in all, great location and very nice restaurant, but we probably won't come back.",2,,1

Updated review","I always thought bartenders knew to keep their eyes on the customer's drinks, if it needed to be refreshed. It is understandable if the place is busy, but on this day, it was far from busy, which I was surprised bc it was around 2pm on a sunny Sunday... I been here several times, I guess depending on the day/time it is hit or miss on a good bartender here...  The place itself is awesome, scenery and all...",,,

The pizzas aren't that great- the margarita pizza tastes like a buffet pizza at an all inclusive resort, but the goat cheese mushroom was pretty good. The French onion soup was the highlight of the night, but unfortunately the fried burrata was not. Burrata is not meant to be fried!! The wine I had, Sangiovese, is prob the worst Sangiovese I've ever tried- and that's one of my favorite types of wines. I do want to mention, though, the kitchen closes at 9:30 (they told us on the phone, as our reso was for 9), but they ended up cooking until about 10 for our party of 10.

I kid you not i never send food back and we had this plate taken back. Now the manager came out and was super gracious. He said the chef wanted to give another plate of the proscuitto and was cutting it now (probably didnt want to lose the 18bucks) . Any way it came out and it was night and day. Wayy fresher. I have no clue what happened and it legit made me wonder what they were doing when we ordered it first. Anyway. He ordered two pizzas, margherita and a diablo. Not good man. Bland. Sorry to say. The margherita barely had sauce wasnt much cheese. I dunno man. It was sad. We ordered crab cakes also which were decent. The cocktails were good. But damn this place isnt good food wise.

We were charged $4 for a club soda which is absolutely insane, not to mention we waited almost 20 minutes to get our drinks and then another 15 minutes for her to come over to take our order. She never once asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks and we had to ask two different people to refill our waters before anyone actually did, with one guy giving us a dirty look when we asked. Within the next hour we were barely acknowledged, my soup was brought out without a spoon, and we stacked all of our dirty dishes and silverware for them (server life) and put them at the edge of the table since no one came by to bus anything off, and they remained there for our entire next course.

Once during a coworker's going away happy hour, and another during a more recent trip for a work luncheon.The happy hour trip was my first time, and I was simply blown away by the view. The restaurant mainly has outdoor seating, but most impressively, it has an open concept architect design that makes you feel like you're sitting right by the edge of the water, facing the bridges that connects you to the other NYC boroughs. The drinks were standard, and a bit pricier than nearby bars with no view. On my second trip for lunch, we sampled the food for the first time and was severely disappointed. The view was still amazing but the food was enough to ruin the experience. My coworkers and I ordered mostly from the salad section, and one ordered a pizza. Presentation wise, the food looked just as amazing as the views outside. The salad greens were standard, but the toppings were less than desirable.  I ordered the lamb sausage skewer that tasted rubbery and raw. I suspect it wasn't even cooked through. Another coworker also didn't enjoy his food, and noted that the chicken from the chicken salad was dry and tasteless. I had a bite of my coworker's pizza and it was just as bad as the chicken, if not worse. All in all, go for the views, have one drink, but I'd suggest staying away from the food.",,,

For the entrees we shared 4 pizzas (we were a group of 8) we got he spinach one, the Bianca, the hot apricot and the goat cheese truffle one. The goat cheese one was very dry and we didn't eat much of it. The hot apricot was our favorite. Overall the pizza is very dry and nothing to write home about. The ambiance however is AWESOME. You're right on the pier and have an awesome view. We also had a great night. I would order wine if you're drinking because the cocktails were VERY small.

The food is passableQuick tips:-there's no AC-cocktails are meh-lamb merguez is a great starter-the kitchen errs on the side of underseasoningFirst off, the view is gorgeous but be sure the weather is good when you come. The entire restaurant is open air and if you can't handle the weather outside today, IK is not a good choice.Second, super convenient for anyone working in FidiThird, for its location, the view, the portion sizes and prices are quite good IMO. Now let's talk about some of the actual food:Drinks: -Wall St Revival (tequila, citrus liquors, pineapple juice, bitters), which wasn't as sweet as it sounds, fairly weak, and pretty watered down by the massive amount of ice. At $13, not really worth it-My coworkers said the cab sauv (by glass) and sauv blanc (half bottle) were not badStarters:-Blistered Shishitos: not as flavorful as shishitos are chalked up to be, but perhaps my expectations were too high. Light on the char too, but that may have just been the kitchen rushing-Avocado toast: hard to screw up, the avocados were sufficiently ripe, didn't go overboard either on the feta which is a pet peeve of mine-Lamb Merguez: DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. I don't usually like lamb but the texture, juiciness, and spices were quite good in this.Mains:-Grilled Skirt Steak: the asparagus was steamed and then very lightly grilled but it wasn't trimmed well (still some woody stalks) and it had clearly been cooked a while ago. The chimichurri was neither fresh nor zingy - very wilted, oxidized, olive green color and looked like it had been sitting under the pass for a while. The steak, perhaps simply by nature of being skirt, was pretty irony and had some offal-like flavors. The grilling wasn't able to overcome these flavors and it had also clearly been sitting on the plate for a while. The IK potatoes are supposed to be roasted with garlic and rosemary but tasted more of pepper and cumin. Also, there was guacamole on the plate which was not expected, but fairly good*seems like there's a trend to under season in this kitchen (which is not necessarily a bad thing). My steak was very lightly salted and my coworker who ordered the lamb shank said it tasted completely unflavoredNot impressed by the food - lamb merguez was the top item.",,,

We could tell from the lackluster, almost all ice drinks that the bartender was not a mixologist. That's the reason we only had two total.The atmosphere was that of New York trying to be LA, which is altogether wrong. But in the spirit of Summer and a right on the water location, I understand why this restaurant summons its inner Hollywood maven and wins (at least a few people) on ambience alone. It tries to be upscale and exclusive, but just comes off as fake. Most of the patrons seemed to be tourists but I noticed a few New Yorkers wearing the same disappointed look that I was. We were too pressed for time to order food.Won't be back.",6,6,3

It sits right in front of the Hudson River close to Brooklyn Bridge and is very near The NYC Financial District. It's famous for $2,400 Gold Leaf Pizza. However the brunch menu items were $18. Lots of patrons and friendly staffs and fast service but I didn't give five stars since the plastic glasses for water was all scratched and the numerous bus servers were not very hygienic in appearance. One server was touching his beard with a kitchen utensil in front of the customers and tapping with it drawing unnecessary attention to himself.",,,

The open air dining overlooking Brooklyn was beautiful, and the wait staff was professional.The food didn't live up. Chicken was both overcooked and anemic looking at the same time with no browning or flavor. Steak was unpleasantly salty, though perfectly juicy. Sides were home runs: the butternut squash and potatoes were both fantastic, and the panna cotta was will executed.I can't say I'm very likely to return.

The Smoked Salmon, Bianca, Goat Cheese, and Spinach pizzas were amazing, but filling, as you would expect.

Sangria is quite tasty!Apps-wise, I highly recommend the dips (ricotta and spinach artichoke) and the shishito peppers. The mussels are a decent pick too!

It's all open and airy and all the sides are full glass windows so panoramic views. We got the half bottle of Albariño which was very good not sweet sweet but not dry either. We started with the Caesar salad which I loved because you could cut the size you wanted and the dressing, olives and hand grated Parmesan were delish. We ordered the Hot Apricot pizza, it was un like anything I've had before. Honey Sriracha, prosciutto, apricots, chives and amazing cheese was all spectacular and a burst of flavors in your mouth. The service was extremely quick and efficient, the table turnover fantastic. We waited 2 minutes for a table even though it was busy. HIGHLY recommend this place.

We went for brunch and had meals that I thought were impossible to make taste bad: eggs Benedict and french onion soup (or their version of it), and a salad. Pretty simple stuff, and brunch staples, so no excuse.It was over salted and over sweetened at the same time. The salad was oily. The potato baskets for the eggs bene looked the part, but neither tasted nor felt anything like potato - more like some nasty artificial version of it. The sausage we had on the side was over sweetened and half heated.We were starving, so we ate the lot, much to our regret. Had we been less hungry we would have sent it all back.Maybe their pizzas are ok. But we definitely won't be going back to find out. Ever.",,,

The drinks are good, strong, a lil pricey, but standard in NYC ($14). However even the avocado toast was underwhelming and the mussel broth bland.

155,Kristen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,269,76,4.0,8/31/2016,"This place honestly has it all: great views, fantastic (if a bit overpriced) drinks, cool and trendy decor, and terrific service. If you're ever in FiDi, this is the spot.I didn't have any food, so I can only comment on the drinks but the Beekman Slip (gin, grapefruit juice, lemon) was ILLUMINATED. What a fantastically refreshing drink on a summer day! My only complaint was that $13 for a drink is a lot but I've spent the last few months drinking exclusively in Brooklyn, so maybe I'm not used to Manhattan prices anymore. Service was efficient and the bartenders were friendly and accommodating.More than anything, I was obsessed with the decor and the view. With a view of the waterfront, Industry Kitchen has a sort of minimalist greyscale ""trendy millenial"" look but the wide open spaces are perfect for a warm sunny day when you can bask in sunlight but still experience a little breeze from the water. What I loved most about the decor was the partitioning where you have outdoor tables, an indoor seating space that's a little more intimate and cozy, and then a bar area that's rectangular with the bartenders in the middle. I enjoyed the atmosphere a ton; for a Tuesday night, the place was popping. I really can't wait to come back and see what it's like on a Friday or Saturday night.",1,1,1

It has a lot of tables & seats and also a large bar area. Everything is open and outdoors so be mindful of the weather.It took some time for a server to greet us but nonetheless, the service was excellent. We started off with beers and cocktails. 3/4 of us had the Rose House cocktail (Vodka, St Germain, Strawberry, Lemon, Simple, Prosecco), which was delicious! I also love that they have Delirium Tremens on draft.My sister and I shared the Charcuterie & Cheese Board, which comes with focaccia. The bread was stale and the board was rather small. The Margherita pizza and Cobb Salad were pretty good. I'd recommend coming here for the view and drinks. I will definitely be back for the view, the drinks, and the service.",1,,
157,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10929,3.0,7/1/2016,"Came here for a lunch tasting this week with my friend. Super convenient in that it is literally 1 block away from my job. But then I would normally never come here because it is outrageously priced and I economically and health consciously choose to eat stuff from home at my desk. Moving on - this place has EPIC views of the Seaport. The building is a clear, glass-like structure and is completely open to the pier and ships floating by on the river. Things I sampled: Drinks: Most of them were pretty decent. Refreshing is a good word. Not sure if they are worth $13 apiece. There are other options in the financial district that are significantly cheaper. But then there are places that are just as freaking expensive. This isn't a beer bar. It's a girly cocktail/rose/wino type of place. My favorite was personally my friend's drink 'The Wall Street Revival': Tequila, Lemon, Cointreau, Lillet Rose, Pineapple Juice, and Angostura Bitters. A proper drink with many different levels of taste. The Rose House was a little too fruity for me. I don't understand Rose cocktails and this being a new hip thing in New York. But I imagine the girls will love this. Burling Slip and Beekman Slip both very similar. Only difference is one uses gin and is more lemonade tasting and one uses vodka as its base and has a light soda fruit taste. It's the rhubarb I suppose added in on the Burling that made it more unique. The Tin Building Sangria was nothing out of the ordinary. It tasted like basic chilled wine. Some tasty refreshing drinks. But I would make it a one and done to say you did it and admired the view.Of the food menu we tried a variety of pizzas. The crust is more of a flatbread style than a woodbrick oven style pizza. There's little char on the crust and its kind of on the soggy side but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. There were some pretty negative reviews on Yelp I noticed but honestly I think they've probably improved since they first opened.  Margherita was pretty standard but not enough Mozzarella cheese on that sucker. Bianca pizza was pretty drool worthy. Good assortment of cheeses and a nice liberal amount of fancy olive oil on top. Best thing I tried was the salmon pizza. Nice huge chunks of salmon, onion, huge chunks of dill (still tasted it in my mouth for hours after the fact), and capers. I tasted mozzarella on this oddly rather than the cream cheese creme fraiche. Or maybe I am crazy. Decent food but it could still up it's game. The fresher the better. Also, more cheese never upset anyone when it comes to pizza.",3,2,2

The waitress takes my order for cocktails and never tells me that the bar is out of Cointreau, although my drink includes it. The cocktail was horrible. The pizza was warm, and not even as good as take-out. Tables are backed up against one another, and there is no real organization amongst the staff. The seemingly chaotic flow makes the poor menu worse. I gave two stars ONLY for the location and quick seating. I hope a good look at such an excellent opportunity for a sweet spot is reconsidered.",,,

161,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1635,64753,2.0,5/29/2015,"This place is pretty awful. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because of the nice view and location right by the water. Also, I feel bad giving 1 star when the place at least means well but is just generally really clueless about everything.I should've known what I was in for when the hostess took me to my table at 7 PM and told me to enjoy my lunch. Uh, what?Rewind 45 minutes first - when I arrived I saw at least 10 empty tables and was told it was a 30 minute wait. This was good news actually, as I made the best decision ever and went over to the new Smorgasburg at the Seaport to get a Cemita while I waited. Normally it's a bad idea when I eat a dinner before a dinner, but this time it was good, since I didn't bother coming even close to finishing any of the stuff I ordered.I got back 40 minutes later, and was finally seated after a few more minutes.At least it was worth the wait. Just kidding, it totally wasn't.The menu is super generic, with every basic item you could imagine, as well as some pizzas. I skipped over all that stuff and just tried a pizza and a calzone. After at least 20 minutes, the Soppressata Picante Pizza finally came out ($16). I've never actually had Chuck E. Cheese pizza, but I imagine it might taste like this. Not good.10 more minutes passed, at which point a clueless bus boy asked me if I ordered the salmon. Nope. 10 more minutes, and another clueless bus boy tried to give my Calzone ($14) to a clueless couple at the next table. I wasn't able to flag them down since nobody had any idea what was happening, so I got up and told them it was obviously mine. This thing was slightly better than the pizza, but the dough was still pretty bad and the full mushroom caps that were just thrown into the thing were very unpleasant.The second the calzone came, I actually told them to bring me out the Beignet Basket ($7) for dessert, since I knew it would take forever. Sure enough, I still waited several minutes, and employing the same strategy, I asked for the check once they finally brought the beignets (which didn't work either, but more on that later).The 3 balls of fried dough were covered in cinnamon sugar and filled with white chocolate ganache, along with some more of the ganache for dipping on the side. The consistency of the beignets was all wrong, and not worth eating, so I gave up after a few bites of one of them.I then proceeded to wait and wait and wait, no sign of the waitress or the scared young manager that was running around trying to please everybody. I finally just went inside and tracked down the guy, at which point he knew they messed up, so he at least comped those beignets, which was a nice move (after perusing some of the other reviews, it seems like they're doing this a lot, so it's not a good sign).This place is probably more suited to after work drinks and staring at the nice view. Food and service are definitely not their strengths, so maybe get a drink or two here if that's your thing (though I can't comment on how good that aspect is) and then get some great food from Smorgasburg at South Street Seaport a few blocks away.",49,32,22

To my surprise, the romaine was very crisp and the dressing was perfect with the croutons. I had my steak medium well but they seemed medium, which was fine, the bites were tender and tasted very good. My lemonade was a tad too sweet, the server was nice but she only came to our table as soon as all plates were presented, and asked how everything was, lady, I hadn't had a chance to take a bite yet.FInally when we asked for the check, we received it after 10 minutes and the server never came to pick up the credit card, so we ended up paying cash and just walked out.By around 1pm the place was filled with white collar employees from the financial district, they use two hostesses which was wise to accommodate the tables and parties, but apparently they were too busy to serve us, the buzz boys were very nice about keeping our water filled though.",1,1,2

167,Corinne M.,"Tacoma, WA",484,532,119,2.0,11/6/2017,"My son insisted that the only reason that we came to New York was to get Unicorn pizza. The whole time we were there we never made it to find this unicorn pizza until the last night, it was so important to him that we rented a car a day earlier than planned and paid a crap ton of money for tolls. - We get to this pizza place, and they don't seem eager to sit us, but we're seated almost right away. - We're exhausted and just wanted something simple to eat, I asked if they had pepperoni or sausage pizza, as all the other pizzas on the menu were a bit extravagant, this irritated our server beyond belief. He said that they had no pepperoni, but they had  an Italian salami pizza, so we ordered that with the unicorn pizza. I told him that I thought I saw sausage on a pizza when we walked in, he said nope, I asked if they had anything close to it, to which he very irritably answered no.  We're visiting and talking, and I notice that the table next to us has the pizza I saw when we walked in, I asked what it was, and was told it was actually alligator, how cool is that, why could the server simply not say that the pizza that may resemble a sausage look was actually an alligator pizza, I would've loved to had tried it. - I asked for a manager to inquire as to why he couldn't have just suggested that pizza to us, I didn't even mention how irritable he had been towards us. - After we complained someone else dropped the food off, and our server NEVER came back to the table. I had to wave another server down and ask for another soda for my son which we got charged for (seriously who charges a kid for one soda refill). - When we were done we waited for almost 30 minutes to just get our check, tables that had came after us had already eaten and left, when I found him to ask for the check he rolled his eyes at me. He still wouldn't come back to pick the check up, so I had to ask another server to take the check,. Moral of this story is that the service sucks, the food wasn't nearly that good at all, but I'm giving two stars because the unicorn pizza was creative, and made my sons day.

They have a good selection of cocktails, and nice separation of dining and bar area.Overall, I like this place a lot, I have come several time (have brought visiting people) and definitely plan to return.",1,,
177,Kevin G.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,258,37,3.0,10/22/2017,The best part of this place is the view while sitting outdoor on a nice sunny day.  The food is good (we got the margarita pizza and the hangar steak).  Keep in mind the price are high because of the setting.  It is still a cool place to meet friends or coworkers after work.,,,
178,J K.,"New York, NY",1,129,77,4.0,11/4/2017,"Came here for brunch with a few gfs on a Saturday afternoon. Surprisingly, we got a table for 4 right away. Pretty views if you're sitting outside, the only downfall is the smell of boat fuel wafting in from the water taxis all over. We each enjoyed our entrees. I got the Cobb salad which was great. The margarita pizza was eh. My sister loved her eggs Benedict, they were baked in little muffin tins with hash browns as a shell. Other friend had a veggie omelette and enjoyed it.",,,
179,Sam V.,"New York, NY",81,189,468,5.0,5/6/2017,Came for dinner with a friend. Was looking for a warm area to hang out and we spotted this place. Ordered the bianca which was deliciously cheese but not insanely oily. Service was impeccable and the pizza came out pretty quick. Definitely looking to come back again,,,
180,Jenn E.,"Bel Air, MD",84,4,1,5.0,6/2/2018,"I cannot overstate enough what a wonderful experience I had at Industry Kitchen tonight. As a first time visitor, I wasn't sure what to expect. When we approached the hostess station with a party of 6, we were told that reservations were needed, but they quickly escorted us to a low couch and table area where we could sit and eat, despite not having reservations. Then, within fifteen minutes of being there, one of my friends dropped another friend's wedding band, which fell into the crack of the floorboard beneath our feet. After trying to get it out with a knife, fork, and magnet, we asked the manager for help. The next two hours the manager and owner worked tirelessly to help us retrieve the ring. Everything from trips to the hardware store to buy special drill bits to reassuring us as we waited, they went to every possible measure to help us, all while serving us delicious food and drinks. (I highly recommend the Diablo pizza by the way... think of it as upscale Taco Bell pizza. Amazing and not as spicy as it sounds.) The frose was also deliciously refreshing and the perfect balance of sweet and dry. But enough about the food. I know you're waiting with bated breath to know if we got the ring. After two hours of effort, and a crowbar assisted removal of a floor board, we got the ring back!! Most establishments would have said they would get back to us and never call, while others would have said it was dumb to take off a ring and they were not responsible. But that was not our experience. The staff at Industry Kitchen truly treated us like family, and we are forever grateful. If not for the hipstery cocktails and waterfront view, go to Industry Kitchen because the people there are pretty stellar humans and take pride in how they facilitate a wonderful experience for their guests. Thank you so much!",,,

185,lauren v.,"Little Falls, NJ",53,22,67,2.0,4/15/2018,"The food was good, atmosphere was fun, but the service and the cocktails were terrible. We went on a nice Saturday afternoon, wait was over an hour when we got there around 230 so we made a reservation for 5. Went on a day cruise with Hornblower came back at 5 and was seated right away. There was 5 of us, the bus boy counted 5 times how many of us there was despite us telling him 5 numerous times he still counted. Then he finally decided that there was 5 so he removed one of the table settings. Our waitress Rachel came over introduced herself. I asked her which cocktail she thought was better the midnight flower or high noon, she said they were out of the midnight flower, so I ordered the high noon. we also ordered a Pinot Grigio, and 3 cokes. We asked if they could do any virgin drinks she said the only thing they were able to do was a virgin Bloody Mary, but we passed. For dinner we ordered 2 margarita pizzas, a sopresseta pizza, a crab cake salad, and one of the girls wanted just a plain pizza. When we told this to Rachel she seemed confused as if she had never had just a plain pizza. Rachel asked if we just wanted the dough no cheese no sauce, we had to explain in detail what a plain pizza w regular cheese was. The drinks came and the high noon cocktail was microscopic basically a waste of $14. It would've been nice if she would've told us that it was a small portioned drink. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe it's really strong which is why it's so small, no it tasted like orange juice, had little to no alcohol in it that I could taste. It was finished by the time the food came, food was actually really good. Rachel never asked how we liked our food if we needed anything despite walking past us to tend to other tables. The bus boy kept bringing us water and not neatly either, he poured it from so high that it splashed everywhere every time. It was take a sip and he would come back with more water, very obnoxious, we asked him to stop and he didn't. Rachel came back I ordered a Caribbean sunset, and another Pinot Grigio, she brought us the bill a little while later but no drinks, before I could ask about them she walked away. We had to get up to pay our bill bc she didn't come back for over 25 minutes. After we paid at the hostess stand, she brought us our drinks. If don't think we'll ever go bac",,,

This place was just the spot. The restaurant is right on the water which gives you a great view of Brooklyn as well as the bridge. The food is delicious too. We split the French toast, which was coated with pecans, drizzled with Nutella and topped with bananas. So yummy!",,,

188,Barbara W.,"Greenbrae, CA",45,120,8,2.0,4/11/2017,I am starting with a positive shoutout to server Pablo. Every other part of our experience was disappointing and shameful.  We waited 40 minutes for our food and were told there was a problem with the ticket system. Folks around us received their drinks and food in a timely manner.The quality of the food was average however my hub's steak was room temperature and the potatoes with melted cheese were cool and the cheese had solidified.  My salad with watermelon radishes was uninspired and bland even though the description was quite appealing. The setting on the waterfront is lovely and the interior design is chic. It's just a shame that the food timing is so off and the salad uninspired because they have the bones of a winning restaurant.,,,
189,Tiffany T.,"Richmond, VA",1,2,0,2.0,5/26/2018,"I have been here twice.  And while the view and people watching are great, the service has been terrible both times. Yeah first time we chalked it up to them being busy during brunch but the second time there was no excuse. Food is just ok and cocktails could be better for the price.  I would give a third try if the service hadn't been bad again.",,,
190,Tanashia L.,"New York, NY",0,9,8,5.0,10/19/2016,"I really liked this place. I liked everything from the food, drinks, atmosphere, and view. I had the Spinach pizza with chicken. The pizza was delicious with the crust just the way I like it (and they weren't skimpy on the mozzarella cheese). My waiter recommended my drink which was the Rose House and it was so good! It was a sweet drink but still gave me a nice buzz. There was music playing at just the right volume. I chose a table outside on a beautiful evening after work. I work right by this place and will definitely be coming back soon (just for the drink alone).",,,

Not even exaggerating, every 3-5 minutes, they would come and ask if we were done. I would be mid bite with plates still full and be asked. I don't know if this is a tactic to get people out faster, but there wasn't anyone waiting at the door for a table. It really was rude and at one point I had to empty a plate and hand it to the guy because it was the 6th time he came around asking. I would recommend to retrain the staff and if this is a tactic, it's not a good one.",,1,
