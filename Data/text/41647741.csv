1,Lyndsey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,6,1,1.0,11/17/2018,"Really not pleased with the service offered by anyone here. Won't ever come back here again  Ordered room service, they deliver a raw burger. Ordered dessert, it doesn't even arrive. Ordered wine, it's corked. No thanks!",,,
2,Mary L.,"Longmont, CO",14,76,59,5.0,10/23/2018,Perfect location is East Village. Very friendly staff. Our room was large with windows on two sides.  Bars and room service food were wonderful and great service also. The lip pillows on the bed were odd and having no top sheet seemed unclean. But not enough not to return!,,,
3,Brittany S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5,4,0,5.0,10/8/2018,I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night! The staff was extremely friendly and greeted us right when we walked in. The rooms were awesome as well! We got a rooftop view of the city right from our bedroom.We will definitely stay there again!,,,
4,Stefanie R.,"Northville, MI",12,12,2,3.0,10/24/2018,"Great location, great customer service, the cafe had incredible food! My 3 stars is only because the bed was very horribly uncomfortable. The entire left side of the bed had a huge sag so I either had to sleep in the sag or in the other side. I could not sleep in the middle of the bed. The room otherwise was very clean.",,,
5,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,1/31/2018,"I came here on Saturday evening to catch up with a friend. We intended to go to Narcbar, but it was closed for a private event. Then the Standard Cafe was way too crowded and noisy. We settled for the Winter Garden which worked out well since it was a freakishly warm night.At 5 pm, it was pretty populated-- it looked like quite a few tents were still free, but most of the freestanding tables were taken. We managed to snag one far away from the door. It's a nice, festive atmosphere with Christmas trees and cool features like mirrored walls.If you're not in a tent, you have to go up to the small counter window yourself. There was a line of a few people, and it wasn't exactly moving quickly. Compounding the issue was that virtually everyone coming to the Winter Garden passes through that area, so you have to keep constantly moving. Poor planning.Most alcoholic drinks were $14, including hot options like gluhwein (mulled red wine), which my friend got. I went for a nonalcoholic hot cider for $8 which was tasty. They also had a number of snacks like fondue and apple strudel.It ended up being a good way to catch up with my friend despite the inconveniences. The restaurants inside look nice so I'll try one of those next time.",4,,2
6,Joanna M.,"San Francisco, CA",384,84,129,5.0,1/15/2018,"The cafe was beautiful, good vibe, good ambiance and great food. We ordered a croissant, latte, cortada, biscuits and gravy and everything was delicious. The price is what you'd expect of a super hip place but it was worth it. Staff was friendly and definitely recommend this for a coffee meet up on the east side.",,,
7,Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,119,662,5.0,1/8/2018,"Had drinks here one of my last nights in New York and I had a blast. the atmosphere is great, super cool decor and vibe. They even have cool tepees towards the back where small parties could have their own enclosed area. The drinks were great, very smooth. The service was wonderful, our waitress was efficient and friendly. She really knew her liquor ! This is a great bar to have an event at or even stop in with some friends for a few drinks. Lots of room, not very crowded, tables and bar areas. Restaurant is separate from outside tepees and bar areas. I will definitely be back here when I'm back in the city. Great place to mingle and have some drinks.",,,
8,Jessica P.,"Bay Shore, NY",12,64,200,4.0,11/5/2017,"We came to The Standard to enjoy the beautiful outdoor garden after a birthday brunch for my sister and I. We arrived around 3:30 and we had a gazebo to ourselves. Decorated with beautiful fall decor, it was picturesque. The waiter was very nice- he was running around making sure our glasses were filled with the sparking wine we ordered by the bottle. We set up our own music since they didn't have any- they could work on that. But in all, it was a great way to celebrate our birthday. Great drinks, attentive staff, and the autumn decor we had be searching for!",,,

10,Christa S.,"San Francisco, CA",175,14,0,1.0,12/23/2017,"I went here for a friends birthday brunch in the yurt last weekend. I suspected I might have to overpay for mediocre food but I didn't expect to receive the worst service I've ever experienced.Service: 1/5 The waitress would remind us every 5-10 minutes that there was another group coming at 2pm. She probably said it about 15 times over the course of our meal - I don't mind getting a reminder or two towards the end of the meal but the whole time was extremely rude. Maybe this wouldn't have been as aggravating if the actual service wasn't terrible. 6/8 of us got our salads after 40 minutes of being there. The other two had to wait another 20 minutes to get their salads. At that point we were half way through our reservation and had only eaten salad. Once the cheese and platters came, refills on those items and on drinks were also slow. The whole operation was disorganized and the waitress kept coming in to check if things had come out (usually they hadn't) and to remind us we had to leave soon.Food: 3/5 Although I've had better fondue at the melting pot, anything dipped in cheese is going to be tasty. The sausage and potatoes were the groups favorite. I really didn't care much for the apple pie dessert - it was reminiscent of a McDonalds apple pie.Drinks: 2.5/5 overall. 1/5 for the hot toddy, which tasted like hot water and lemon. I could only detect a faint hint of bourbon and there was no tea flavor and no sugar. The mulled wine was good - 4/5.The yurt experience is ruined by the poor service and there's nothing else to redeem the experience - don't go here.",3,,
11,Linda L.,"Seattle, WA",103,268,316,5.0,11/27/2017,"Luxury hipster is how I would describe this hotel. Amazing service, and a gorgeous, unique building. I loved the view from my room, and the shower is incredible. They have a steam shower setup, so enjoy it. :) Very considerate of them to provide earplugs, though I did not need them at all and found my room very quiet. Minibar totally stocked with /everything/ you might want. Breakfast options are somewhat limited.",2,,1
12,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,4.0,5/14/2017,"The last time I came here was for a brunch experience - as noted in my review I don't think the food is particularly great, it was cold, and overpriced.However, I came here recently for some casual drinks and had a pretty great experience. We sat at the bar at the ""Standard Cafe"". Even though it was basically a hurricane outside, the bar area is bright, airy and features some fantastic indoor foliage so it felt like a perfect spring day inside. Inspired by the vibes, we sipped (ok slightly gulped) some wonderful rose (with heavy pours) for the afternoon. It wasn't particularly crowded for a Sunday so we were able to hear each other and have a great catch up conversation. It's a small area so it may be a bit more crowded at night, but I would highly recommend this as a great option for casual drinks at a convenient meet up location.",2,,1
13,Edward V.,"Gaithersburg, MD",2,45,88,5.0,2/5/2018,"This just might be my new favorite NYC hotel. Thank you!!!! Everyone was Uber helpful, kind, and friendly. My wife, son, and I were there this weekend. We brought my in-laws (86 year old father-in-law) to NYC to celebrate my daughter's birthday with dinner at the yurts (the Winter Garden). We can't say enough about how helpful everyone was- from the young man who met us at the door, to the front desk staff, to the bar staff, and the folks running dinner in the yurt. Our rooms were comfortable and clean. Thank you!",,,
14,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,4.0,6/15/2017,"The Standard is one of my fav hotel chains for sure. The look is cool, the rooms are sleek, the service is good, and the atmosphere oozes sexiness. The king room was a good size, it had small closet, a flat screen tv,  full mini bar/fridge, desk, small nightstand, blackout curtains,and a decent sized bathroom. The views aren't amazing in this location, but you have to respect the floor to ceiling windows, they bring so much natural light into the room. The beer garden downstairs is super nice and the area itself is great for bar hopping. This hotel is great for a long stay or a quick overnight trip.",,1,
15,Dusty S.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,5/6/2018,"Do not stay here.it's a grungy party hotel. Really loud. Really ugly. Lumpy mattress topper, unfitted sheet, stained carpeting, stained curtains, windows are covered with grime, air conditioner unit so loud it's impossible to sleep with it on. Cheap tacky furniture. No coffee maker in room. So you have to order room service. I stayed two nights. One morning room service took 90 minutes. The next morning they just never sent the order.  And, in the evening, when you return to the hotel through the cramped and tiny alley of a lobby (lobby is literally two benches and a very low ceiling), there are drunk people careening everywhere and loud music piping in and people yelling. My friend who also stayed here was literally urinated on by a drunk guy in front. That's the kind of hotel it is.",1,2,
16,Isabelle E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1,1.0,9/19/2017,"I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. I am chocked by the service from the hotel staff. I was excited about finally staying at the standard and I liked my room when I checked in. However, my room had a door into my neighbours room with absolutely no sound proof. So when he came home drunk at 1 am in the morning and talked on the phone it was like he was in my room and I could hear the entire conversation. The first night I was so tired from travelling and I ended up going back to sleep. The second night I woke up again at the same time to the same guys conversation on the phone. After 15 min I decided to go down to reception. They told me I couldn't get another room and that they would send up security. I get back up to my room and he is still talking. The reception call ME and tells me the guard is on our floor but he can't hear anything. I couldn't believe it as it was SO loud outside my room and even worse inside the room. Reception ended up calling him. The guy lowered his voice but keep talking on the phone. The sound proof between the rooms are so bad that you can't event watch tv without hearing it. I got like 2 hours sleep that night because I was so upset and jetlagged. I go down to reception again and tell them if I can't get a new room I want to check out. So they tell me they can get me a new room and that they'll move my bags during the day. I get back at 7 pm and ask for my new room. The manger tells me THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED IT because they're at capacity and wonder who I spoke to. This is has been the SHITTIEST stay ever and I am exhausted from not sleeping properly. I don't understand what I am paying for.",5,,1
17,Aleigh B.,"New York, NY",2,55,48,5.0,12/7/2017,"I walked by their Winter Village one night and decided to come back with my boyfriend a couple weeks later.  It is such a hidden gem!  They had Xmas trees everywhere and yurts (think cozy large tents).  Quinton, one of the servers, was so awesome, A+ customer service.  The holiday drinks were delicious, and again, the atmosphere was lovely.  Perfect winter date night spot!  I'd love to take visiting friends here.  Also, by the looks of their Facebook page, the outside area is very cute in the summer as well.  Very lush.  We will be back for sure.",,,
18,Jaq. M.,"Honolulu, HI",100,28,2,2.0,9/4/2017,"Want to give this place 5-stars, it's just not happening. There are a lot of good things about this place - great location, bar is open late, the garden's a great place to lounge, and it's strange/funky/fun which I think are all wonderful things. Three less stars because we didn't get the room we paid full price for and the staff didn't seem to care. To the hotel's defense, they let us check in early. The two men checking us in said that a room was available for us, but didn't say that it was over 100 sq feet smaller than the room we paid full price for and that the room they could put us in was on a lower floor. No one followed up with us after to make sure we were happy, and the staff didn't seem to care about how satisfied hotel guests were. When we brought it up, they said something like ""sorry, the 10th floor is different than our other floors."" How were we supposed to know that? We stayed 4 nights - had a nice view, but not the floor to ceiling windows or large king suite that we really looked forward to and paid for.The message here is it's a cool property, but you'll need to be very proactive about managing your stay because the majority of the staff could care less about keeping you satisfied. Also, there were multiple staff members with poor attitudes - it honestly seemed as though they thought they were too cool to be doing their job. There's enough rudeness and arrogance in the world - I don't expect to have to face it in the hotel. Also, food was just average.Just overall really bad customer service. The only saving grace were the housekeeping staff - they were nice, attentive, and pleasant.",2,,
19,citygirl C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,119,24,4.0,5/29/2017,"Location is an excellent option when seeking to stay on the Bowery! Just steps north, and modern high concept new age design. Views are unlike anywhere else, as this building is new construction - incredible and a great splurge from my pod room and arlo room in south Tribeca/canal soho. They do not offer coffee in the am unless you sit in the cafe however think coffee is literally across the street 2 blocks south. There is a garden restaurant open for brunch be sure to check it out on the weekends because they did not tell me about the space option for breakfast do I ate in the standard cafe which is great however the garden is a must because it's a rare find in the city.",,,
20,Lillian T.,"San Francisco, CA",322,217,1088,4.0,2/4/2017,"This review is for their Winter Garden. The Winter Garden is an outdoor bar with heated yurts (little white tents) which can fit a party of 4 inside. It's very tiny so you'll be getting very cozy with your party, but it's definitely worth the cuteness! My friend and I came on a Friday night around 7:00pm and did not have a reservation, so we ended up sitting outside on a high table with a heated lamp next to it. The night started off fine and I was able to sit with my jacket off, but towards the end of our stay the weather dipped to the low 20s and even with my jacket on, it became almost unbearable so I wouldn't recommend sitting outside the yurt if the weather is below 30 degrees F.I ordered their non-alcoholic hot chocolate and it was just the right amount of sweetness. Towards the end of the drink I found bits of chocolate on the bottom that I couldn't reach unless I had a spoon. We also ordered their cheese fondue set for two, which included bread, cucumbers, roasted brussel sprouts, sausage, apples, and small potato pieces. I loved the brussel sprouts, apples, and sausage dipped in cheese. The only unpleasant feeling I had was the cheese hardened and became solid pretty easily because the weather was so cold outside, and I thought the potato pieces would have to be cooked a little bit softer for it to be enjoyable. Overall, a great experience nonetheless and super cute for catching up with a small group of friends over decent snacks and winter themed drinks which are alcoholic and non-alcoholic! They also have a shuffleboard set up so if the weather permits, it's another fun activity to partake in!",3,1,1
21,Chuck C.,"Morrisville, NC",28,11,2,1.0,3/6/2018,"This hotel is a joke.  More like a porn palace than a hotel. False chic with pink lip pillows, pink neon bed lights and ""standard sounds x nudeaudio move speakers"".  The room is small, it smells like a backed up septic tank and the the bed lacks firm or substance.   And over $300 a night.  Ridiculous.  Did I mention it smells repulsive?",1,,
22,Jack L.,"Madison, CT",118,7,0,5.0,8/16/2018,"Super clean, great location. Price was wrong.. Keep in mind I would have booked the room anyway, but a 14.75% ""occupancy tax"" + $3.75 after booking a room @$199. I really hate when a company gives a cost, then you book and it's more?!?  It's like looking at the menu at Starbucks and then you ring out and they jack it up. Bad business. Final bill for $199.00 room was over $230 and whether or not it was listed in some fine print or not I booked over the phone and price was $199",,,
23,Christine K.,"Manhattan, NY",36,64,74,4.0,2/5/2017,"We went to the Standard for drinks last Friday, taking in the Winter Beer Garden. What a treat!! The ambience was great and we hid away from the freezing temperatures in our little heated yurt! We had a hot cider and a pint served in the most funky glass... This made us chuckle throughout the drinking process!!! Food was available, fondue which looked amazing and was reasonably priced. Sadly we had a table booked at the adjoining Narcissa. The curling rink looked super fun too! Such a cosy, beautifully presented winter scene. The reason I haven't given 5* is because of a slight gripe with service. The serving staff didn't actually help that much, the first server seemed confused to whether we could take a seat in a yurt (which was empty but we wanted to check) and then we were left without a menu or the information that you have to go to the bar for drinks. We had kind of sussed this was the style as this is how the beer garden in Chelsea is, but it was only through knowing this that we made our way to the bar. A shame as it did create a kind of uncomfortable awkwardness! The barman however was incredible. He was swamped with orders but maintained a happy disposition and coped well with the demands being placed on him!We had a great time in the beer garden and hope we can come back for fondue sometime!!",,,1
24,Chris R.,"New York, NY",2,31,1,1.0,11/13/2017,"Massively disappointing on pretty much every level.  Booked through Jetsetter.  Got there, they didn't have us in the system.  Then they called someone and were informed that we actually WERE booked.  They informed us that they manually do this...really?!  It was only going to take a few minutes.  At the 10 minute mark, I asked if maybe my wife and I should hit the bar.  It was, after all, our single night of a honeymoon.They encouraged us to do so, that they'd get the first round.  PERFECT!  Of course, no sooner did we get to the bar, we were fetched away - the reservation had been manually uploaded now and they could check us in.  Ok, still good!  Even better?  We'll comp you a bottle.  You booked a 'get-away' package and all, sir.  They asked red or white - we said Red and boom, up to our room.So...we got there.  My wife, having quickly fallen victim to a nasty cold, decided to take a nap.  She asked that I wait around for a bit for the wine.  So I did...for an hour. Finally, I decided to get up and go down to the bar for a drink while she napped.At some point after I left and before I came back (I was gone an hour) a TV repair man came to fix a broken TV, we knew nothing about.  She asked that he please return in a little while as she was napping.  She put the do-not disturb sign up.I return at 625 having had a truly nice convo (After waiting 10 minutes in line) with the front desk.  He's helped us narrow down a restaurant in the area and will make a reservation.  sweet!I notice the wine has not come.  YES, I get it was a comp and yes, it is completely possible that it was meant to arrive only to be met with a do-not-disturb sign, but that would have been 90+ minutes after we checked in...I get that you should take it easy when getting something free - but...there's an expectation right?  We'll send this up for you - implies it will be that night, probably soon, as in less than 2 hours.  I call down, ""Hey, I hear the TV is busted, we have a 730 reservation.  CAn you send the guy up then and just wondering about the wine.""They have no record, but will send it up.  Along with the TV guy.We leave in an hour (no wine) to go to the restaurant.  It was good.  My wife was getting sicker and sicker though so we made it a quick dinner, and headed back.  Got back - and NICE!  Wine has arrived.  Not so nice...TV is busted.  Still.  Seriously?!They send someone up NOW and he comes in, takes the box away, tells us he'll be back in a few minutes.  45 minutes later, I call the front desk.  They call me back literally in 30 seconds telling me he can't fix it.  You could get this answer in seconds - but if I hadn't called to be like 'where's the working TV thing' I'd STILL be wondering.  Kinda shoddy.  Look, honeymoon and sick wife aside - you expect a few things in a hotel room.  Working shower/bath.  Toilet.  Bed.  TV.  The usual.So...management comes up to say they have another room for us with a working TV.  It's...the room next door.  On the one hand, yippee!  On the other, really?!  You couldn't have just put me in that room to begin with?!  And now I've been sitting around.  Ugh.  ""Sounds good.  Can I have the key...?""""Oh, I don't have it right now.  I will come back with it.""""Um...so...I confirmed I want to move on the phone.  You confirmed you had a room.  So...""""Right and I do.  I'll come up with that key.""Like...why not just come up with the key?!  Whatever.  They come back 10 minutes later with the key to the room literally right next door.So...the room is better.  YAY!  It has a tub (the original only had a shower).  The TV is on, SCORE!  My wife is especially happy about the tub.  She's ready for another nap (feel awful she's sick) so I'm left to watching some TV.  So...on the night.  It's taken 4 hrs to get a bottle of wine.  4 hrs to find out that we don't have a working, nor can we get a repaired TV.  another hour to figure out there IS a working TV and it's literally next door in a vacant room.  Wake up and wife feels like a bath.  The tub holds...no water.  Awesome!!!They get C for effort on a few things.  Very nice to offer up a bottle of wine and to fix the TV.  But...when you can't actually fix the TV or you can't actually get a bottle of wine up to us for 4 hours...don't offer.  I think I would have been happier.IF you're running a hotel and know there will be issues - warn your guests ahead of time and/or put them in places where there won't be issues.  In other words, being proactive goes a long way.I will never go back there again, and can't say I'd recommend anyone else does.  The rooms are very small, incidentally.The shining point was the bell-hop - a very nice man who was super positive and tried to be helpful every time I saw him.",2,,

27,Max M.,"Orlando, FL",0,14,0,1.0,7/5/2018,"LIARS and terrible response to their screw up. I was passing through NYC the night of July 04 on my way home from international travel. I specifically looked for a hotel that had a rooftop area with good views of the East River fireworks. Having stayed at The Standard LA before which has an exclusive rooftop I called East Village a week prior to confirm. They said that all guests have access to the rooftop unless there is a special event, which could come up during my international travels. They explained the special event would be posted on a the July 04 happenings part of their website where I could also buy tickets to said event if anything occurred. I also checked in the phone and the man guaranteed me that they would have incredible views from the rooftop of the fireworks. Guess what, no event was planned, lucky me! No. I showed up to the hotel to be told that the rooftop is 100% closed at all times to hotel guests no matter what and it is reserved 100% only for private parties. How is there that huge of a disconnect!??? To top it off, I paid extra for a corner king room which was also supposed to have views. They put me in the one and only corner king with absolutely no views on the 5th floor. Guess what they did do though!? Upgraded the guy in front of me who was checking in to a corner king for free, who was also there only for the night, and who I spoke to who has never been to the hotel before and just booked his room a few hours prior. He got a 10th floor corner king with flawless fireworks views. In the end, they basically just said too bad and didn't even attempt to offer any concessions whatsoever for their massive screw ups.

34,Ali S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",174,25,3,4.0,3/9/2017,"Came here for our stay since my sister was having an audition at NYU and wow we loved it!Love the decor in the room-the pillow the bed a tad bit too soft which makes you sink in a bit-not my style. We got the 16th floor and the view was AMAZING. The only real problem I think needs some work on is the layout of the room. With the two beds and the closet theres some awkward walking space by the tv and the window. You sort of have to squeeze yourself and gets annoying at times. Bathroom was cool and the staff always friendly and helpful with suggestions around town. Best part of all the surrounding shops and restaurants are unique and definitely a nice change from my first time and craziness of Midtown area. My favorite part though...We got to see a sweet short performance by an artist named ""John the Baptist"" at the top floor on a monday night and freakinn loved it..and the drinks..and the vibe of the people. For my first time in East Village I know I'll def come back and keep this place as an option.",,,
35,Stephanie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,111,84,4.0,1/2/2017,"This hotel is in a really great location-- EV has lots of top notch restaurants all within a few blocks. Also, it's only a brief 10 min walk to Soho for the rest of your shopping/eating needs. Rooms: Smaller than expected but well-equipped. Especially the mini-bar. The deluxe corner king on the site shows an extra little nook but we didn't have that in our room. Our NE facing room didn't have the best view, so request a high-floor room facing another direction. The walls are REALLY thin. We could hear every single person on our floor entering/exiting their rooms and every knock from housekeeping and room service. Not the best thing to wake up to early in the morning. Weekends could be problematic if you're trying to get some rest.No gym in the building but you can ask the front desk for passes for the Crunch gym across the street.",1,,

I love the location too. East Village isn't for everyone, namely tourists, but for working folks, city dwellers and people who are already very familiar with NYC, this location is perfect. Close to food, trains, and walking distance from NYU and all the lovely things the Village and SOHO has to offer.The bar turns up on weekends. Which is alright with me.

40,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4580,1590,1642,3.0,4/17/2015,"I was really torn between three and four stars. Overall it was a decent stay. It's a energetic hotel in a fantastic location with lovely views. The highlights for me included the amiable staff, the comfortable beds and the views. We slept like babies every night and it's remarkably quiet for being in the middle of New York City. The rooms are rather miniature. So miniature in fact that we moved into a suite as we really could not fit with our luggage and tiny maltipoo into the deluxe king room. The suite was better but still not what I could spacious. It was tight quarters for us. There is no gym but they do offer Crunch passes. Overall I would not rush to stay here again because of the small room size, but if you want a comfy bed in a quiet room, this hotel is for you!",15,13,16

No, it's the Standard shower! (Note: the shower care products are organic and smell divine.)After a long trek to NYC, this place felt like home.

42,Mark L.,"West Hollywood, CA",291,452,58,3.0,5/7/2015,"I recently stayed here for a 5 night stay and was pleased overall. This hotel has lots of energy and things going on, which can be viewed as good or a little frustrating depending on how you feel. First lets cover the bad: Upon check in I was frustrated to find that the room I had reserved had been given away and I was stuck with a room type and smaller bed than I had asked for. I had made my reservation through the hotel itself and not some third party site, which normally guarantees I get the type room I want. We had discussed room types and I reserved a high floor, king deluxe room.  I felt frustrated that my reservation was not kept and my 7pm arrival got me stuck in a crappy room. The next morning they did switch me to the room I had reserved, but this was an unnecessary hassle that should have been avoided by keeping the room type I had specifically reserved when I made the reservation.  Also, I was not told when I made my reservation or when checking in that a HUGE party was going on on the 21st floor that evening. I was several floors below the 21st floor and the noise was unbearable. Insanely loud music, banging on the floors, a live DJ and overall chaos persisted until well past 1am. It was impossible to sleep even with the earplugs that were provided in the room. Very frustrating after a day of travelling. Also, the rooms are incredibly small, with absolutely nowhere to store your items or unpack your clothes. There is a very cheap particleboard dresser type thing provided but the space is very limited. Would be ok for a 1 night stay, but for my 5 day stay I had to live out my suitcase. And speaking of suitcases there's nowhere to store it in the tiny room. Since there is no closet provided the only place for my suitcase was by the front door or next to the bed. In fairness when visiting New York you really dont need to spend much time in your room except to sleep, so the room size was not that big of deal. But the lack of storage was very frustrating, especially at the high price of the hotel. The beds although somewhat comfortable seemed worn out in both rooms I stayed in, sagging in the middle. And with a worn out mattress topper that moved around while sleeping that wasn't much fun either. Pillows and linens were nice and of high quality though.Now the good:Staff were very friendly, happy and helpful. Always greeted me when I walked in the lobby and all employees around the hotel had a smile on their faces. The bathroom in my room was great. Beautiful large shower with a great shower head and great water pressure. Wonderful soaps and products available. Plenty of nice large towels and high end faucets, toilet and vanity with great lighting. The views from the higher floor rooms are fantastic. And other than the initial night when I checked in, the room was quiet and easy to sleep in.Also, the location of this hotel is great. Its within easy walking of dozens of great places to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Its in a safe, very nice part of town and is very walk-able. Next time I come to New York I wont be staying here, but that doesn't mean I would not recommend staying here. Overall its a fine place to stay. Just for the price I paid per night I expected a little bit more.",2,,
43,Tyler G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,7,0,1.0,11/26/2017,"To keep it short, for the price this hotel is incredibly below expectation. The service is horrendous, especially with the front desk and room service. They are apathetic and really do not put in any effort to make you feel comfortable.  The room service menu has downsized from what it was a year ago. Their attitudes at room service are dreadful every time you call. They might as well get rid of it because ordering breakfast was a miserable task, which it should not be. If you are staying here, just order food delivery from somewhere else. You will be happier. Lastly, the rooms are average. No luxury here. Overall, for the price there are so many better places to stay in the city. It truly is not worth it in any way.",,,
44,Nick S.,"Los Angeles, CA",160,64,2,5.0,5/28/2017,Rooms are very hip and well decorated. The bed is super comfortable. Views are impeccable and service was great. Would love to stay here again in the future.,,,

46,Noel K.,"Cambridge, MA",0,13,0,5.0,7/4/2017,"My husband, teen daughter and I stayed at The Standard over the Fourth of July weekend. OMG, Best, Hotel. Ever. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about The Standard (and if there was anything, I would say it). Okay, here's what we liked so much: Location, location, location. We were attending a wedding in Brooklyn and considered staying in Brooklyn. But in the end, Manhattan is still the best. The Standard is two very short blocks from a subway up and downtown (the ""6""), and the location -- right between the East Village, Washington Square, Soho, and the increasingly trendy Bowery (never thought I'd say that) is perfect for anyone who prefers the downtown vibe to uptown or even to further west to the West Village or Chelsea. We explored (walked, shopped, ate, went to museums, etc.) for two days straight and never felt the need to go uptown. We would have been happy with another 3-4 days (but we had the wedding....)When we arrived, the staff discovered there was a problem with the a/c in our room -- even before we went up to the room. Without blinking an eye, they offered to upgrade us at the same rate. Easy. Peasy. While I was waiting for the room switch (not long), the staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and courteous. I got the feeling that people work here because they like the hotel, and like each other. The managers were also super nice and you felt like they too enjoyed their jobs and really care about the people who stay at their hotel. It was a nice balance between professional, friendly, and hip without pretense.The room. The views are gorgeous from the floor to ceiling windows on nearly every side of the room! Even the bathroom has floor to ceiling windows. The Standard has wisely put tiny decals on the windows in the bathroom and next to the bed, so that while you can see out, no one can see into your room.Cleanliness. The room was very clean. This is a huge thing for me. Of course, the hotel is still pretty new. But I am hopeful that the rooms will stay just as clean. The Standard seems to take pride in their hotel and if they can keep up with the upkeep, it would be lovely!!Beds, Linens: No complaints here. Cotton sheets. Comfy bed. Even my husband who often has trouble sleeping said he found the bed just perfect. Food: We ate breakfast in the Cafe Standard. This is a little restaurant that includes a bar, some tables, and a wall which opens up to include an outdoor eating space surrounded by lush greenery -- but still with nice views to the street. My description doesn't do it justice, the Cafe is just beautiful. The feeling is that of a French cafe. Our food was also excellent: hubby and daughter each had an omelet with home fries and toast. They both raved about the home fries. I had the Brioche French Toast. Yum! Yum! Yum! It included maple syrup, vanilla creme, and berries. No words other then Delicious. There is nothing pretentious about this hotel or the restaurant or the food, and yet, you still feel very pampered and special. One note: My daughter has Celiac Disease (no wheat) and they were able to easily accommodate her with gluten-free toast and the waitress assured us that the home fries also contained no flour (which, sadly, they sometimes do).Additional: The hotel also has a more upscale restaurant that we didn't try. They also have a really nice summer garden where you can sit at tables and hang out with a drink. You sit under an array of trees and vines and you really feel like you are tucked away from the city. Unfortunately we were not able to take advantage of this because it rained each time we wanted to sit outside. But, it is there, and a wonderful place to just sit, rest and hang out. (Have no fear though, if it's raining, you can always go right over to the Cafe/Bar.) As for rain, The Standard will lend you an umbrella if you need one (and like us, forgot to bring one).I kinda hate the idea of posting this review, as I want The Standard to remain a well-kept secret. But honestly, we loved it so much, I want to share.",2,,

Updated review","I stayed here with my fiancé around February for a short ""stayCation"" and was immediately greeted with a smile and upgraded to a room on a higher floor.  The views are different depending on the side of the hotel your room is in. I was fortunate enough to stay in a room facing the east and was awestruck by the beautiful sunrise. The shower was amazing and of course the bathrobes were super sexy. Overall I would definitely recommend the standard east village for a romantic getaway or an amazing photo shoot.",,,1
48,Megan M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",14,11,4,2.0,2/8/2015,"Overall: beautiful room, but so-so service, and very few amenities (room service and free wifi and the only amenities). On the so-so service, we asked if we could switch from a king bed to a double room, they had a double available (which was lovely) but they charged us a $75 upgrade fee that they only mentioned during checkout two days later. So we had to dispute the charge. Generally if someone is going to charge you around $100 they should tell you.. We wouldn't have upgraded if we knew that, we were just inquiring about the bed situation. Would have really like a workout room as well, but wasn't a huge deal. Also, we ordered 2 glasses of wine and two appetizers through room service. They charge $4 per item they deliver, so added $16 for delivery fees. Seems a bit excessive to take one tray of food upstairs...",1,,

52,Lee K.,"San Francisco, CA",503,411,378,2.0,6/12/2014,"The Standard is a mixed bag.Its best quality is the staff.  They're all super friendly and thoughtful.  Everyone seemed eager to help whether answering questions about places to eat at or visit... or rushing to grab a door for me or push an elevator button.  This is as as service-oriented as it gets.Location is also nice for anyone staying on the south side of NYC.For fitness enthusiast such as myself, I really appreciated the daily access they provide to Crunch... right across the street.  This is far better than most hotel fitness centers.So, where did things go south?For starters, the room I stayed in was insanely small.  The bed barely fit in it... and I managed to bang my leg against it a few times.  The room also had no decorations... just sterile white walls, ceiling, and curtains.  When I opened the curtain, I was met with a solid gray wall.  For as drab as the view was, it gave my eyes some relief from all the blinding whiteness.Furniture was tacky and cheap... featuring particle board and simulated wood.Internet service, though free, was very slow.All of this was a bit hard to swallow at $340 a night.To add insult to injury, when I checked out I was asked if I wanted a taxi and said yes.  But then an employee rushed up to me and said that their own transportation was available and could take me right to the airport.  I asked how much and was told $65.  When I asked how that compared with taxi fare, I couldn't get a straight answer.  I asked if taxi fare was a flat rate and was told it wasn't at that time.  So, I reluctantly used their service and was charged $70 instead of $65 because I paid with a credit card.  Give me a break!I'm not sure I could do better on price for the area... but I'll take my chances somewhere else the next time I'm in town.",5,4,2

55,F K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,0,1.0,8/9/2017,"What happened at the Standard Downtown is even after a couple of weeks, still unfathomable to me. They weren't able to provide me with clean linen, because, no kidding, not one piece was available at the entire hotel. They send the linen out and it comes back with stains and black traces from the dryer, which seems to be an acceptable standard at the Standard Hotel. When I complained after I had arrived at my room, they replaced the linen while I was away and when I returned I saw they had exchanged it with equally dirty sheets. The house keeping manager that day, told me at first that I couldn't get a refund, that I had 'an attitude' and that 'he was trying to help me'. It really confused him that I wasn't grateful for the time he was wasting being unable to replace bed sheets when I could have enjoyed the evening with my friend. After he had slammed the door and left, a lady from the housekeeping came with new pillow cases that had never been washed before and asked me if that was a problem and where else the bed was dirty. After the entire debate, neither her nor anybody else at the hotel seemed to able to figure that out.The manager at the front desk I had originally approached with my request, never set foot in my room or tried to work out the problem. And the slick blonde that was working with him seemed irritated that I had interrupted her usual, monotonous 'welcome and check-out speeches' with actual conversation. At least, they gave me a refund.",,,

57,Thomas B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/17/2017,"Had a quick stay here mid-week and was quoted $400 for the night. The room was small, unclean (stained carpet and curtains, water-damaged wall near the window overlooking a unsightly courtyard/alleyway), and decorated so plainly that it was difficult to decipher between pure dinginess or 'intentional minimalism.' Of course the location is great, but that's all the hotel has going for it. If you don't care about sleeping in someone else's dirt or putting up with poorly maintained accommodations--all while paying an overpriced premium--then go ahead and stay here. Otherwise, my main takeaway: staying at The Standard East Village is an experience that just isn't worth the money. You're better off trying your luck at any of the area's several other, likely more polished, boutique hotels (The Bowery Hotel is worth the walk a couple of blocks over).",2,,

We had been to the Top of the Standard at the Standard Highline the night before and had a wonderful experience. We booked the Standard East since it was closer to us than the Highline. We were told one price on the phone when we called (the price of a queen room) however when we got there, we had a different price. Explanation - they were sold out of queen rooms. We were so tired, we took the corner king room. It was beautiful. We started to talking to the front desk receptionist - AnnaMarie and told her about our experience at the last hotel. Since the room wasn't quite ready, she had us wait at the bar and have a drink on the hotel. We waited maybe 15 minutes for the room (short wait) and when we got there, there was chilled Prosecco, two bags of treats and note from AnnaMarie telling us she hopes we have a better stay in NYC.

As someone who also works in the customer service industry, I think it's troublesome that their staff aren't consistently trained to respect ALL customers.

67,Mariana M.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",96,126,301,4.0,1/25/2015,"Stayed four nights during the week, had a good experience overall. We chose this hotel since it was in my old neighborhood and we got it for under $300 a night. Loooooove the location.Standard king room on the 14th floor with a good view, bathroom with shower, no tub. I'll start with the not great aspect:-Yes, the room was little. I also had the experience of bumping my leg against the edge of the bed a few times since the bed took up much of the free floor space. There was little room to unpack our suitcases. But that's New York, and we did pick the lowest category of King bed, plus we didn't really plan on spending that much time in the room anyway. So it didn't bother us that much. Just would've been nice to not have what little floor space there was be used by our luggage, which wasn't big.The bathroom also had almost no space for toiletries and grooming (although our shower was very spacious and nice).Pros:-The bed was incredible. We slept so well. Soft high thread count linens, fabulous feather bed and duvet, 4 super comfy pillows. We thought about asking the hotel what mattress and linens they use since we're in the market for a new bed at home!-Service was courteous and helpful always. My bf left for the airport earlier than I did and the staff offered the hotel's own transport. I've seen a few reviews complain about this. However, he was leaving at close to 4PM, which most NY'ers know is when taxi shift change happens and good luck getting a cab five blocks let alone to the airport. -Free passes to Crunch gym across the street.-FREE INTERNET!!! Do you guys not know how awesome this is? Especially since an unfortunate trademark of so many ""boutique"" hotels is nickel and diming customers and charging extortion fees for crap internet? Here you decent internet for free. If you're gonna do bandwidth heavy stuff like stream videos you can pay $20 a day for super fast, an option given clearly each individual day. -Lots of electrical outlets.-Housekeeping was great. Room was pretty much immaculate and cleaned on a good schedule (use the door hanger signs people, they're there to help you...).-Had a few good cocktails at the bar. -Minibar was really well stocked and although we didn't partake (ok we had some $5 potato chips after many drinks one night, oops), the fridge was large enough that we could store some of our drinks in there (I bought some green juices from a place down the street) and leftovers from dinner one night too.

The room was inadvertently booked at the East Village property and not the Meatpacking District. Since it was booked through Expedia we were told they could do nothing to transfer the reservation. We sucked it up and tried to make the best of it. This was, sadly, not the worst of our stay. The property and room were BEYOND disappointing. It was like the land that The Standard forgot. There were ZERO amenities. I travel often for work and pay half the price to stay in a chain hotel that gives you way more ""bang for the buck."" Tiny room, and I mean TINY. I paid for the larger Corner room BTW. one tiny wardrobe, one bar of hand soap in the room. No room to navigate around each other. Dark, dingy hallways badly In need of updating. When we asked the front desk for complimentary bottles of water - as nearly every hotel offers now - and we were told to ""buy it in the cafe or drink it from the mini bar."" Where it cost $8 for a water. I could have stayed at The Plaza for the nearly the same price and should have. At least I would have gotten what was expected for the price. The valet takes 30-45 minutes to get your car when we were originally told 15. Please stay elsewhere and get more for your money. I will never be to a Standard property again.",2,,

WiFi worked fine. The food in both the Cafe and Narcissa next door was top-notch.

Most uncomfortable bed ever! Unless you like a soft lumpy bed, stay somewhere else. Other issues: room was tiny even by NYC standards. The armoire was about 20"" wide and the rod runs front to back. Maybe works if you're staying one night. No iron, no makeup mirror. The shower door runs snug against floor so that when you open it to get out of shower, the bath mat gets pushed away. Bad design.

I want to be impressed with The standard of east village because they offer a great vibe- much better compared to my experience at the Standard Hollywood. The room was spacious and definitely impressed us for what we paid. A man waiting to get checked in tipped us off that if you download the standard app you can get the room for a lot cheaper. We wound up getting the room for about $145 cheaper just from using the app. So the night stayed there was great, our problem came the next day when we asked to store our luggage for the day in the coat check so we could wander around the city without lugging it around. It was no problem leaving it, but when we returned a few hours later our bag was not able to be found for about 40 minutes. We actually missed our train waiting for the bag as we watched three separate people search for it. I'm not sure how a bag just disappears from the coat check but it did. We sat there seething with anger after seeing them run around forever, passing us multiple times and telling us it would be found. Jane did offer to buy me a drink but I was contemplating filing a theft complaint with the police at this point. FINALLY our bag was found after ""being locked in a cage that the bag should've never been in"". Jane offered us an upgrade for the next night but unfortunately the only rooms she found available for us were way out of our price range and not reasonable considering the surrounding hotels more reasonable options.",2,,

In any case we did and added food to the bill after an hour, consisting of various egg plates and salads. Service was great - never felt like we needed to leave even if our cups were running low.

Lobby bar I've found was not crowded (it never was too crowded before) and generally I've always found a seat at the bar or one of the couches/chairs. Specialty mixed drinks are not cheap but I've come to expect that from boutique hotels in NYC. Quiet, nice alternative to the bars in the area.

I headed over with my dog, 2 bags and was welcomed with open arms at the front desk.  My dog also got mouthfuls of treats before we headed up to the room.  The second night I decided to just book it through the website and they gave me a free upgrade, obviously YMMV but I thought it was a nice gesture by the asst. manager since I would've booked a room regardless.  Overall the entire staff and facility have been very welcoming and accommodating to myself and my dog.  The location in the east village has allowed me to stop by my favorite eateries and bars one last time before I head out.  Ive stayed at nicer and pricier hotels around the world but my overall experience at the Standard EV ranks in my top 5. **If your not in a rush I would wait till 3PM to book a room through the app, for my second night booking through the app would have saved ~$100.",,,

There was literally only about 1-2 foot of walking space around the edge of the bed and the wall, with no space for storing your luggage or even unpacking clothes into drawers. Although the stand alone armoire did have two drawers, they were each only about 4"" high and around 12"" x 12"" in size.

There was a very bare ""Charlie Brown"" Christmas tree"" in the lobby. The kitschy doormen look unprofessional. It was hard to tell they were actually doormen. I ordered a bucket of Ice (for a bottle of champagne). When I opened the door, the employee who brought me the bucket spent a few minutes in the hallway, unsuccessfully trying to tie a cloth around the bucket's handles. I finally put him out of his misery and told him not to worry about it and just give me the bucket. He seemed kind of nervous that he couldn't do whatever presentation the hotel does with an ice bucket... Then he asked if I had a pencil. I gave him the one on the pad in the room, thinking he wanted me to sign something. Instead, he took the pencil with him and kept it.  Very weird. For the price and the size of the room, I wouldn't stay here again. The Standard in Miami is amazing. The East Village Standard is sub-standard.",,,

113,Sebastian L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",56,225,26,4.0,3/20/2012,"In town over a long weekend to visit the fam and had to stay at the newest member of the AB collection. Forewarned is forearmed: this hotel is unlike the other properties. Not nearly so iconic as the Hollywood or edgy as the Meatpacking locations; nor as urban/gritty as the downtown LA branch. This is a more plush and, frankly, more mainstream hotel. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, is it? The building's exterior resembles a gigantic sail, reminiscent of the Burj al Arab. Massive wooden doors open up to a small-ish stone-floored lobby that's either manned by the awesome Nick during the days and afternoons, or some model-esque lovelies at night. A library/lounge, complete with fireplace beckons behind the check-in desk. A small conference room on your right. Restaurant, outdoor patio and ping pong table complete the front floor experience.Had a corner room which came complete with floor-to-ceiling windows and a killer view of the Cooper Union building and Village Voice offices. One of the two most comfortable beds I've ever slept on (the other being a Hastens, but who's got $25k for a matress). Quasi-rain shower and heated floors complete the bathroom. There's a really tiny flatscreen in the room too and the closet is pretty neat. Kudos on the free Wi-Fi, although it ran at a snail's pace.There are a few nods to design aesthetics, but overall this is nothing that Ian Schrager's minions couldn't have come up with.To emphasize the point, NY'ers shouldn't come here expecting a Boom Boom type of experience. Even the elevators seem nondescript compared to those at the Meatpacking Location. And LA'ers shouldn't expect a Smoke & Mirrors type of lounge where you just know there are at least a dozen laws being broken on any given night. But if you're looking for a chill, comfortable, cool-in-a-mainstream-way experience in a great location, then look no further than the Standard East Village.You can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;)",2,1,1

The room was very clean and bed was incredibly comfortable! Plus the bathroom had heated floors and a huge bath (I heard some  rooms do not come with bathes).",,,
115,Andie L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,29,7,1.0,8/9/2012,LOBBY BAR REVIEW:I went last night and found out that my favorite bartender Fonz is no longer there. I was really bummed but stayed and had a couple of drinks. And their service was awful! They were really slow and a little obnoxious. And my drink was a bit watery. I was so disappointed! I used to love coming here because Fonz made the best drinks and he was always so friendly! He made the high prices worth it! One of his other regulars was there last night too and he was not happy either. Hopefully they get their act together soon because Fonz will be difficult to replace!!,1,,
116,Teresa L.,"San Francisco, CA",14,71,3,4.0,5/2/2013,"The staff at The Standard really goes the extra mile.  Some people like the fluffy beds, I like a firm mattress, they removed the pillow top and went out of their way to make us comfortable in many small ways. They set up a car to get us to the airport and always greeted us warmly.The rooms are small and that is to be expected in NYC, the lobby and hallways are also cramped and can get stuffy - actually there is almost no lobby.  There is a lounge/bar on the second floor that guests can use and we were there during remodeling so the penthouse was open for happy hour and breakfast, everyone enjoyed the wraparound deck and views, it's rare to get a rooftop view in that part of town.This is a great spot for a weekend or short stay in NYC, the location cannot be beat - it is close to everything but noise was never an issue, we had to change rooms due to a plumbing issue that they handled more than gracefully.  Both rooms had great views, and two curtain options - a sheer curtain for privacy and a blackout curtain for sleeping in.  It would be 5 stars if the rooms, lobby and halls were a little more spacious.  If you are in NYC for a short stay and won't be in your room much, this probably won't bother you but if you are traveling with kids or have a ton of stuff it might be a tight fit.",,,
117,Gergana B.,"Los Angeles, CA",103,84,2,3.0,11/14/2013,"Stayed at the Standard East Village in June 2013 for business. The hotel was nicely appointed, and the staff could not have been more wonderful. Definitely exceeded the service I received at the Mondrian Soho 6 months earlier.However, the hotel itself left a bit to be desired. The room was normal-sized for NYC (read: tiny) but the layout was just odd and confusing. There was only a nightstand on one side of the king-sized bed--l was traveling along so it wasn't a problem, but the side of the bed I prefer had nowhere for a glass of water! There a desk near the window that was so close to bed it was almost unreasonable to attempt to sit. My room was on the 12th floor and had a basic city-street view. However, the penthouse on the top floor (where they served breakfast during my stay as the 2nd floor restaurant was under construction) had phenomenal 360 degree views of the city. 5 stars for the penthouse alone. The bathroom was very sleek but I had issues with it flooding (the drain didn't seem to work well) and am personally not crazy about the bolted-down pump shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The biggest issue I had was how thin the walls were and the noise level. Sleeping and working from the room were troublesome at best, impossible at worst. I tried to wind down with a hockey game on TV one night and ended up missing my DVR from home (spoiled I know), so I could rewind and hear the commentary I missed from the screaming in the hallway that sounded like it was in my room. There was construction going on during my stay, but it was manageable. They had the elevator closed at the lobby floor during the day, but it was only from 10-2 and it only affected me once.However, there was a movie shoot going on somewhere in the hotel on a weekday and there was no warning, verbal or posted, about the influx of people and equipment into the hotel. I popped in to drop off some work materials before heading to a meeting and ended up wasting about 40 minutes waiting for an elevator that never seemed to be empty. I'm from LA and work in entertainment, so I know these things aren't always planned far in advance (and rarely convenient) but it appeared that very little effort was made to inform guests of the event so they could plan around.The restaurant makes a killer gnocchi and was really nice for people watching (though not as good as Isola at the Mondrian). Room service was good too, but the layout of the room left little option but to eat in bed (not that I have a problem with that).With so many fabulous hotels in NYC, I'm not sure I'd return by choice, but I definitely wouldn't complain about another stay at the Mondrian.Side note--some really kinky items in the mini bar, which annoyingly blocked the empty glasses (only one water glass and one wine glass provided). No thank you, Standard, I don't need an intimacy kit with a cheeky graphic to have a glass of water.",4,1,
118,Me S.,"Wooster, OH",0,4,0,5.0,3/5/2016,"I can never say enough good things about The Standard East Village.  All of the staff -from housecleaning to front desk to bellmen to managers and everyone else - go out of their way to make every moment of your stay pleasant.  On our last visit, I was pleasantly surprised when the front desk staff remembered us from previous visits.  We made a request for an extra light in our room and it magically appeared in no time.  We needed a car service to attend an event, and again, every detail was arranged and could not have been better.  The staff are friendly and accommodating.  The rooms are spotless and beautifully appointed.  A short list of this wonderful staff would include Brittany, Jordan, Page, Ian, Angel, Austin, and, definitely, Jane.  I am looking forward to my next trip to NYC and would not even consider staying anywhere, but The Standard East Village.",,,
119,David C.,"Burlingame, CA",2,49,0,4.0,8/1/2015,"Don't confuse this hotel with their sister hotel they are quite different, both cool but this place is a bit quieter  and no as touristy.   Stayed four nights in July.  Paid for an upgraded room which is really just on a higher floor but for $20.00 a night was worth it.  My room was on the back side and on 17th floor, no noise issue at all, lower floor on street side many have a noise issue (I don't know, I am just guessing)  Showed up early, about 10:30,  counter staff was very friendly and professional.  Nice young woman (from Ohio)  found a room that was available and let me check in very early,   I really appreciated it.  Some hotels are hesitant to do this and make you wait until check in time.  The Standard staff was very nice.    I had stayed in a dump the night prior and was wiped out.  My room was small but clean and contemporary.  In NY small is the norm.  Bed was  comfy, great view, nice curtains made the room very dark (the way I like to sleep)  AC worked well, bathroom nicely stocked, robes,  good water pressure, well supplied mini bar (I did not use it but it was well stocked)  No tub in my room so if you want one, make sure you ask (I did not want one) Shower large enough for two.    Overall the hotel location is quite nice, with many restaurants and great shopping (mostly higher end)  within easy walking distance.  NYU is close as are a few nice parks.  You will see a bit of trash on the street and some homeless folks sleeping on the street, lots of young kind of hipsters but I did not see any issue, people kept to themselves, I felt quite safe.Some construction in front of hotel made it a bit loud while at bar but no impact on my room, you may want to ask for a room on the backside or confirm road work is done.Lobby is small but has a nice outside sitting area if the weather is ok.  Hotel is very clean.Went to the bar, and both restaurants.  The bar has a big outdoor seating area, a young hip vibe (younger than me) but very nice, lots of diversity here.  Drinks were very good expect to pay between $10-$15 per cocktail. Staff was young and fun.  Had one appetizer at the bar, just ok.Had dinner  and felt the  food was good but not a great value.  Party of three with three glasses of wine one  cocktail each, two appetizers and three dinners  about $220.00 plus tip.  I felt the appetizers were overpriced, $15.00 for an asparagus dish with 11 stalks  and some type of cream sauce.  Service was very attentive. Brunch was OK and value seemed appropriate, not great but ok.  Again, staff was nice.Cleaning staff was very nice.Car service hotel to JFK in a SUV, $65.00 plus tip, cash only (they should have told me this I had just $75.00 but could have come up short and would have needed to stop at an ATM.$65.00 is an ok price, UBER is about $55.00 but smaller car.  Sub-Way is about $5.00 if you want the real NYC experience.   Overall I liked the hotel, staff  is friendly,  hotel is clean and safe , the price was about right for NYC, this is a costly city.  I will stay here again.  I probably would not eat here again, there are so many great options in NYC, in a jam the hotel food is fine but nothing special.  The bar is a good place to meet and start your evening.  I rated it with two $$ because at $250.00 a night in NYC I think $$ is appropriate.",1,,
