The food was amazing. I'm not going to lie I don't eat pork and I don't really like rice. The paella is to die for!! ( The best I've every had in my life ) The pork belly the spinach sausage!!!!  And I can tell the kitchen is so small. I can't tell the may have to Electric burners and two Fry's!!! That how you cooks with love. I will be back again. But I will call b4 I show up.",1,,
1,Deborah W.,"Manhattan, NY",209,122,212,3.0,9/25/2018,"I was very excited to try out Heidi's House thanks to the reviews I read beforehand which were all very promising. The highlight of them being what sounded like phenomenal food. However, I feel like after reading all of those reviews I walked in with too high of expectations. Even though the ambience and service was great the food definitely did not reach the level I was expecting it to. My friend and I arrived on Monday night around 8:30 PM. When we entered the small, intimate restaurant the place was still packed. We ended up being seated at the end of the bar right next to the kitchen entrance. After we were seated, even though the rest of the customers had already been served, we had to wait for a while before we had water brought over and had our orders taken. However, after the initial hiccup the service was much more attentive. Our server was really sweet and even helped to chase down a lady who had walked into the restaurant and stolen our leftovers.For our food we decided to order a few dishes to share:-SHRIMP TACOS: The tacos were very interesting. The shrimp and veggies (onions and peppers) were well seasoned and sautéed; however, the fact there was sautéed protein and veggies just made it taste more like a constructed fajita than the kind of shrimp taco I was expecting. And I'm not sure if that's a good thing. The tomatillo sauce that came with it was in a surprisingly massive quantity and wasn't really used since it didn't add too much flavor. -TUNA TARTAR: I have always loved a good tartar and this one had a nice flavor but the avocado puree was a bit too overpowering. Additionally, the bread that came with the tartar was also stale which really put a damper on the flavor of the dish. -MACARONI & CHEESE: The cheese sauce of the mac and cheese was good however, there was a tad too much pepper was in there. However, I did really like the spiral pasta that came with it, slightly different than the traditional mac and cheese but a good change. All in all, though the food was not to the level I had imagined it would be when I arrived, the ambience of the restaurant was nice and did give us a great night!",3,2,1
2,Katherine J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",509,49,55,5.0,8/26/2018,"If you're ever looking for an intimate dinner spot in UES, Heidi's House is your restaurant. The staff here are incredibly friendly and attentive. You can call ahead and be put on the wait list as there are no reservations. This is a great date spot and I would recommend getting things to share between 2. We had the bacon mac & cheese and seafood paella for our mains and the soufflé for dessert. The bacon mac & cheese is very rich and delicious--the bacon comes as large slices and not bacon bits as we originally expected. The seafood paella had very generous portions of seafood and the ratio between seafood vs rice was perfect. Both were incredibly filling and flavorful. We barely had room for dessert but persevered onto the soufflé, which was fantastic. Nothing disappointed here and service was great. While the menu and vibes exude ""comfort food,"" the prices are not what you'd think. Nonetheless, recommend a visit for the right occasion.",2,1,
3,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,5.0,8/15/2018,"I came here too close to closing time to be able to have everything I wanted to try, but thankfully the kitchen was still open and I was able to experience some. It was definitely worth it, and I'll without a doubt be back again to try to rest!The pasta of the day was gnocchi which was very delicious. I can't eat cheese but they were willing to make it without. I'm not usually too much of a pasta person but this was such an exception. It tasted so rich and delicious, and the sauce was mindblowing. If I come back here and they have the gnocchi again, I'd order it in a heartbeat.The special of the day was lamb and also was very good. I'd get it again for sure, but honestly, very little could touch the level of the gnocchi in my mind. Surprisingly enough, because lamb is one of my favorites -- it only goes to show you how good the gnocchi is. The lamb though was delicious too, and super tender. Not at all chewy or tough.For dessert, I had the chocolate souffle, which was crispy on the outside with a melted inside. It was sweet without being over the top, and definitely a treat.They had a pretty decent wine list and I particularly loved the Lebanese wine. I highly recommend it for those of you looking for something different!The atmosphere was incredibly intimate, the restaurant tiny and cosy, the staff as friendly as they could possibly be. And most importantly, the food was delicious!Five stars, hands down.",1,1,1

5,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,4.0,3/25/2018,"3.5 stars but will round up.  Small menu, but food is above average and service was really friendly.  Great neighborhood spot, although the line/wait time tends to be quite long...while overall quite enjoyable, it's not worth the wait imo.We started with an artichoke salad, which was fresh and well done.  Then we had the gnocchi (with red snapper), mac & cheese (with bacon and mushrooms), as well as the paella.  The gnocchi were quite large, but they tasted great -- doughy without being too dense.  The mac & cheese was nice and cheesy but not overly salty.  The paella was the weakest link and just seemed like normal rice on a plate (not served in a paella pan, so no crispy rice).  There's a good assortment of seafood and meat, but the dish didn't quite come together for me -- rice and chorizo were quite salty, but seafood was quite bland.  I normally don't like overseasoned seafood (good seafood should be able to standalone), but the other flavors masked the seafood and it was hard to appreciate (hence tasted bland).For dessert, we got the bread pudding, and it was as good as advertised.",2,2,1

My boyfriend and I shared the organic mesclun salad, macaroni and cheese with bacon, a side of organic roasted vegetables, the chocolate soufflé and the bread pudding. It was more than enough food and everything was delicious! My favorite dessert was actually the soufflé, which I feel like is hard to get right temperature-wise, but this was perfect. Definitely want to return to try the burger.",2,,
9,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",408,733,596,4.0,10/31/2017,"Fresh and well-executed food in a comfortable setting. Meat portioning was scant. Gnocchi was excellent. Date pudding was good, but overpriced. I ordered the Duck Ragout Gnocchi and Date Pudding. The ragout sauce was savoury and the vegetables and duck were fairly well executed. The amount of duck in the sauce was disappointing. The gnocchi were tender are smooth on the palate, but the portion was small. The date pudding is overpriced at $15. While it was warm, soft and flavorful, I don't think it  captured the unique flavor profile of dates. It was like any other chocolate/gingery brownie/cake that I've tried. Well executed, but not very interesting for the price point.",3,,
10,Shirin P.,"Houston, TX",14,432,45,3.0,9/3/2018,"Food is amazing here. Make sure you get one of the Mac and Cheese items.

I finally had the chance to try it, and ordered 3 different types from the happy hour menu to share. We ordered one with bacon, another with chorizo, and one with mushroom. The bacon and chorizo macaroni and cheese dishes were absolutely delicious and very filling! They come out piping hot, and ooze with such wonderful cheesy flavor.Highly recommend - my husband has been here several times and has not had any cross contamination issues.",1,,

I must say, the limited space allows for an intimate experience and I love the bar next door waiting area setup next to Heidi's. We ordered the guacamole (spicy), tuna tartare, and paella to share, ending with the date pudding. For drinks I had the Gavi wine and my boyfriend had the Gruner. The food was gorgeous, rich in flavor, interesting and just yummy! I highly recommend everyone who lives in the Upper East to give this place a try - especially foodies.

13,Joanna G.,"Manhattan, NY",50,142,0,4.0,5/21/2018,"I've been meaning to try this restaurant for a LONG time since I moved into the UES, but I wasn't sure if I could justify spending $25+ on mac and cheese. I've heard about the long wait so my friends and I came right when they opened on a Friday night and there was only ONE empty table. Go early because this place is TINY and gets crowded quickly.Menu is quite small, but my friends and I split the bruschetta appetizer and each ordered our own mac and cheese. The bruschetta was really tasty and had capers, tomatoes, and cheese. It was a bit on the saltier side, but still delicious. The mac and cheese with bacon is not bacon bits, like I'd thought it would be, but instead has 3 strips of bacon on top of it. I had the mac and cheese with chorizo and it was really delicious.Highly recommend this local neighborhood spot - it's worth the higher price point for mac and cheese, but make sure to get there early!",,,
14,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",141,204,438,5.0,2/25/2018,"I almost don't want to post a review because this place is a hidden gem.It's literally one of the smallest restaurants I've been to, but that makes it so much better and intimate. The food is amazing and authentic, as they don't compromise on ingredients and quality as some larger restaurants do.They make it an effort to carry organic and sustainable ingredients (including wine and beer) and the staff works SO hard. Freddy was incredible and we think we saw ""Heidi"" popping in from their awesome bar next door (also owned by Heidi and her husband). Again Freddy works so hard and made sure everyone was comfortable and happy. We will definitely be back.In regards to food- the shrimp tacos were very good, the paella was my favorite as it had a large portion of seafood, chorizo, and tender thick cut bacon (surprisingly not chewy). The artichoke salad was a special but it was unique and flavorful, as was all of their dishes (they season everything very well).",5,1,1
15,Helen L.,"New York, NY",39,27,56,3.0,8/6/2018,"Heidi's house- Chip and Guacamole. Seafood paella and BBQ ribs special.*I have so many mix feelings about this place. I love the intimate atmosphere inside and the host is extremely friendly. The menu has a good amount of choices but I'd say it's on the pricier side. Our Guac appetizer was $15 and each entree was about $27. My honest opinion about the food is that it was just okay and it's definitely not worth the price. Maybe the ingredients were fresher and better quality, I hope that's why they charge so much. But I feel like I could've made a better guac and we could've have gotten more quantity for the price. My friend was raving about the Mac and cheese so maybe that's their star item. But just plain Mac and cheese started at $15, I just don't think it's worth it to spend that much on carbs and cheese.*I definitely will not be back to Heidi's house. I don't even think it's worth trying to be honest.***#eatwithchefboyardli#heidishouse#nyceats#foodie#paella#chipandguac#guacamole#bbqribs",,,

18,Ryan D.,"New York, NY",2,11,2,5.0,9/27/2018,"One of the best meals I've had in New York City. The place is very small and they do not take reservations, so arrive or expect to wait.

19,Stefany V.,"Las Vegas, NV",2511,4331,13100,5.0,4/27/2017,"Okay, so Heidi's obviously isn't a house by the side of the road, but the cozy space really does feel like you're in someone's home. Adding to that effect is the small menu with innovative seasonal specials. Heidi's is a two-man operation with one front of house bartender, server, and busser, and another turning out straight magic from the kitchen. Started with a baked crab dip appetizer, served in a ramekin with carrots, celery, and house-made tortilla chips. Well made with lots of crab, menu description listed horseradish (which I don't care for) but it was subtle.We shared seafood entrees, including the paella and a special. The paella had plenty of seared scallops, fresh shrimp, and squid, plus the classic chorizo and their own twist of adding a thick-cut bacon, which really added a lot to this dish. BF inhaled it!The craziest part about my amazing entree is that it was listed as a salad. It was the best damn salad ever: sea bass, scallops, shrimp, and octopus with arugula over pureed squash with a mustard cream sauce. I'm not sure it meets the usual understanding of a salad, but it was amazing. The seafood was generously portioned and perfectly cooked, especially the octopus and seared scallops, it had just enough greens to keep me happy, and that mustard sauce was bomb even though I was apprehensive about mustard and seafood. That squash puree though? Tasted like sweet potato, in a good way. I'll probably be trying to recreate this dish for the rest of my life. We shared the chocolate souffle for dessert with fresh whipped cream. It was a very well made souffle but it lacked the wow factor that really impressed me with out entrees. I wish we'd opted for the date pudding that other reviews rave about.The entrees were the standouts for our dinner, but the whole choreography of small space plus limited staff and excellently-timed dishes really does deserve the accolades. Heidi's is a total gem.",22,13,14
20,Marjorie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",193,217,63,5.0,11/11/2017,We came here for Valentine's day the two of us and then again with family (there were five of us).  All the food here has been excellent- from the paella to the decadent chocolate dessert. Hands down the best part of the meal has been the date pudding. It is to die for. It is one of those desserts that you dream about.  I want it right now actually. This is a tight space so plan accordingly.,2,,2
21,Autri C.,"New York, NY",492,27,0,5.0,8/15/2018,"Heidi's is absolutely fantastic. If you are looking for comfort food served in an intimate setting in the UES, look no further. Since I live so close, I typically call in ahead of time to see what the wait times are like for a table and the folks always give me an accurate estimate. If you arrive early, you can always grab a drink at the bar next door. I've had the lobster mac n cheese as well as the pasta of the day my last two visits and both were cooked to perfection. My friends and I sat at the bar on one occasion and then at a table on another. The place is small, so you'll have to make sure to temper your expectations from a wiggle room perspective. All in all, the experience was fantastic and I'd recommend it to anybody looking for awesome food in the UES. Oh, and it's a good date spot as well (dimly lit, good selection of bevs, and you can show off your ability to put down a mac n cheese in record time).TLDR: Comfort food that is yummy, intimate setting, great beer selection, excellent service, call ahead of time to make sure there isn't a crazy wait on a table.",2,,
22,Brandi J.,"Bluffton, SC",0,6,3,5.0,12/10/2017,"Neat little (tiny) on the Upper East Side. They don't take reservations, but will do a call ahead. Best bet is to plan an early dinner and arrive at 5 when they open. Perfect place for 2 people. 4 or more will only find one table or the bar to sit. Only serve beer and wine. We partook in the marinated olives. Delicious. For entree's we did the Mac and cheese with bacon. Potentially the best Mac I've ever had. Served on a small cast iron skillet. You have to eat the crunchy edges.  Our other entree was a seafood ravioli special with lobster, scallops, and shrimp. Another excellent dish. We had to get both desserts, the chocolate soufflé and the date pudding. Both excellent, but the chocolate soufflé would have been better served with either a creme sauce or, as we tried, the caramel sauce from the date pudding. Love the small, yet excellent, menu.

This was frustrating...not sure if we would have ever gotten called to be seated if I hadn't gone to check.Food was so so and expensive for what it was.  We ordered paella and it was not very flavorful or hot.

The paella has scallops, big shrimps, tender meats, chorizo, and a piece of lobsta claw.

What I liked most about the paella was that all the ingredients were super fresh. Usually other places save up on the toppings like shrimp, but I felt like for this place, there were more toppings than the rice. Every bite was wonderful and I'm super excited to try other options on the menu! The service, on the other hand, was good with one exception: our waitress was pretty nice but she kept trying to hurry us. My friend and I understood since this place is small so there was probably a line waiting outside. But I was in the middle of my food, and continuously asking us if we were done seemed ridiculous and almost ruined my appetite. But, I definitely want to come back to try everything on the menu because I trust the chefs here 100%. Overall, highly recommend!",3,,
28,Bea B.,"San Francisco, CA",210,597,1414,4.0,8/17/2017,"Tip: They *do* take reservations, if you count calling 15 min in advance & asking them to hold a table.We traipsed in around 8pm. The joint was partially full, the lighting dim, and the (jazz) music low. In addition to the low-key vibe, I liked the wooden bar-top & the pictures up along the back bar wall next to a very tidy wine display made for a nice view. We sat at the bar & were fairly deftly served by the lone 'tender/waitress. I didn't much dig being served a hot glass fresh from the dish washer with a bottle of chilled water, but hey-ho. If it's not yet evident, Heidi's is a super cosy spot with a few two-top tables along the wall, a three-top at the front window & a bar that sits approx. 10 patrons. Besides the 'tender, I spied a food runner. I imagine there's a solo chef in some tiny kitchen tucked away in the back out of sight.Two of us ordered off the specials menu: gnocchi with lamb ragout, filet mignon (light on the mignon, heavy on the salad) salad, and, off the regular menu, a med-rare burger cooked to perfection. The gnocchi dish was rich, full-flavored & filling. The cheeseburger was 'the best burger' our habitual burger-ordering pal had eaten in some time. The steak salad was nice, but did not bowl me over. The citrus dressing was super tangy, the mix of greens was tasty & slightly unusual (beyond the frisee and mache type stuff with names that escape me save for Japanese basil), but the serving of meat was just a tad skimpy for the price. -four or five very thin pieces served at room temp. for approx. $25. This place is a wee delight on the UES. Given the size constraints, I sorta wonder how they make their rent cuz the UES ain't cheap. Maybe they own the building?

He also disrespected my family when I brought them there for the first time.  He told us the table that is for 4 people was being held.  Held for someone that was trying to find parking that took 25 minutes and when they finally came in their full party had not arrived yet.  The rest of the party came 10-15 minutes later. The best is there was a little child in that party who was maybe 6 years old.  I'm a regular customer.  Maybe he doesn't know my name but, I'm sure he knows my face.  Until Freddy isn't working there any more I won't be back.  We don't need to be around his attitude and negative energy.The food is delicious.  The chef does an awesome job with the food.  Heidi and Ed are lovey people along with the other guy that works there.  I'm sure many people feel the same way!",,1,

The atmosphere is intimate yet unpretentious and the service was friendly and attentive. I will certainly be back soon.",1,,
38,Greg M.,"Queens, NY",2,28,8,5.0,2/13/2018,This place was fantastic. It's a tiny hole in the wall and you'll have to wait to get in as it is so small but definitely worth it. The food was made with real quality and there were some good specials as well.,,,
39,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,5.0,4/18/2017,"I think the best part of my experience at Heidi's, is that it was underrated. Our tourguide was reading the audience (aka me), and knows I have a passion for MacnCheese, and rumor has it, Heidi's house has some great ""Comfort food"", most famously with Mac n Cheese. I mean, Heidi, can we be new besties??We found our way to heidi's, which is extremely small, and can't hold more than maybe 8-10 people at tables, and another 6 or so at the bar. They also don't take reservations. When we showed up at 8, we put our name in, and were told it would be 90min. 90 min later (after being in pjs on the couch) we got the call for Heidis and rushed over.We were seated at the bar, which was perfect. The menu is actually quite limited, but if you have a one track mind like me, you only need to know about the mac n cheese. We ordered 1 to split, and the boys ordered some steak special (They had a few specials). One great thing about the menu is it tells you how long to expect for each dish, which actually helps you not grow impatient and relax and enjoy your wine more. The mac n cheese was out of this world. I think what makes it best is they use an interesting pasta, which really adds great texture and ""comfort"". The cheese was extremely creamy, flavorful, and just on par. The boys loved their meat. Gster said it was the best mashed potatoes of his life. The chochlate souffle was light, rich, and the perfect compliment for good comfort food. Heidi's now officially makes my ranking of top 10 mac n cheese's (unsure what ranking though). Go find it, indulge, enjoy, and get satiated with satisfaction.",6,2,5
40,Melissa D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,57,8,5.0,6/30/2018,"This is the perfect little restaurant. There are only a few tables (seriously, there are like 3 or 4 tables in the entire place), and it's serious neighborhood vibes there. The menu often only has a few items on it, but every option is enticing and everything i've ordered (like ragu gnocchi and paella) has been delish. Also a nice wine list. It feels super homey there. This is a spot I like to pop in to if I'm alone or with a friend as I live in the neighborhood, so if theres an open seat great. I wouldn't necessarily plan a night around coming here because it can be hard to get a table. Also- due to the limited menu I wouldn't come here if you have a lot of food allergies or strict dietary restrictions.",,,

42,Sally L.,"San Francisco, CA",479,389,1123,5.0,7/28/2016,"Probably one of the best dinner spots in the UES. Come here!Going in, we were pretty much set on the mac & cheese and paella, but the waiter highly suggested the scallop and duck specials on the board. So being the piggies we were, we ordered 3 entrees, thinking the paella would still be good if we took it home. This plan worked FYI. Paella was still bomb the next day.We got the roasted duck with cabbage and mashed potatoes, seared scallops with butternut squash puree and grapes, and paella. The duck was a pretty substantial dish. I think it was a whole half a duck, cooked to perfection, and set in a delicious gravy. So savory and flavorful. The scallops dish was probably the favorite with the roasted grapes and sweet potato mash really supplementing the sweetness of the scallop. Normally I don't like savory dishes trying to be sweet, but this was very well executed. The paella was loaded with chorizo, bacon, lobster, shrimp, scallop and TBH we were pretty full after our 2 entrees already. The flavor was really good but the dish felt a little overwhelming for me. The sausages were a little too salty and IMO it was just trying too hard even though it would've been awesome without half the meats.Wines are around $10/glass and $35/bottle and beers around $8-10/bottle - but a pretty wide selection.Portions were sizable, and prices were on the higher end. Our waiter was so patient, kind, and quick with service. Everything was pretty great here :)",8,3,4

While in the area, it was late on a Friday night and I was in need of some deliciousness ASAP. Had this place bookmarked so headed over here around 10pm.It's a very small and intimate setting. A long bar and a limited amount of tables and chairs scattered around. Definitely a great place to have quiet conversation and relax, but the space is really really limited, so be prepared.The food on the other hand was very good. I started with an order of crab dip which was good, but it was heavy on the cheese and light on the crab. The taste was awesome, but obviously the lack of crab took away from it. Also had an order of paella which was very good and short ribs which were amazing. I mean these ribs were falling apart upon being touched by the fork and the taste was out of this world. Quite possibly the best short rib I've ever had.The service was also excellent as the waiter was great about making recommendations and helping me navigate the menu. Speaking of menu, the food is written on a chalk board hanging the wall, which is a bit hard to see. Also worth noting, they have a very good wine selection. An overall excellent restaurant!",6,2,3

A tiny place, small menu with big service, giant comfort.I mean, C'mon!  I would come back just for another bite of that date cake.  Honestly, it didn't sound too appealing at first; growing up, dates were usually used in soups and for medicinal purposes.  A date cake was the least likely thing I thought I would enjoy.  HH's date cake is phenomenal, like nothing you've ever had before + hand-whipped cream: just call it a night.The pasta selection on the back of the menu was more of a listing of what they deviate between: gnocchi, fettucini, spaghetti.  There is only one pasta special of the day, listed on a small chalkboard above the bar.  And that is the pasta you will be served in whatever manner they wish to serve it in.That night my fettuccine was served with parmesan cheese, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus & truffle oil.  I thought the pasta was cooked perfectly, and though it included some of my favorite ingredients, I felt the tomatoes were a little much.  The combination didn't meld as well as I'd hoped.My crab soufflé (a special of that night): chunks of crab baked with cheese into decadence.  Amazing.  It knocked the socks off the chocolate soufflé that we finished with, which was very heavy/rich.  Date cake: a hard act to follow.",7,3,4

Very intimate, perfect for a date. The staff is very warm, nice and professional. Every client is important here, they always have time to chat. When it comes to food - its unbelievable. We always get something else and every time it is delicious.

The restaurant is always packed, but call 2 hours before you want to dine and they will take down your name and give you a call when your table is available. I came on a cold and snowy Friday evening with my boyfriend and enjoyed my experience. I ordered the gnocchi which was melt-in-your moth perfection. My boyfriend, however, ordered the paella which was flavorless - the worst paella I have probably ever tasted. With 2 sides of the spectrum, 1 really amazing dish and 1 below average, I give this place 3 stars. Other than that, service was great. Just stay away from the paella.",1,,

The ambiance is so perfectly unique. It's warm and cozy with jazz in the winter and in the summer it's a completely refreshing place to be. This place has the most personality on the upper east side and they still value impeccable costumer service and just overall integrity as well. They really get it. Heidi, Ed, Fred, the staff, the chef; they all get it. This is a super popular establishment so they decide to recently open Ed's Elbow Room next door. It's a lovely bar with snacks, drinks and that same perfect ambiance. Patrons can have drinks at Ed's Elbow Room while they're waiting to get into Heidi's or after they have finished their meal at Heidi's but want the drinking to continue a bit.

The first time we started the with special artichoke salad and then I got the paella and my fiancé got the short rib. All were excellent, but I think the short rib was our favorite overall. The next time we shared the shrimp salad to start and then I had the gnocchi special and he had the burger. Again, all were great but the gnocchi was the best gnocchi I've ever had! We also had a good reasonably priced bottle of Chardonnay.Overall, great neighborhood spot! It is tiny inside and not a spot for a long drawn out meal, but perfect for a casual night out.",,,

Our waiter was the only one working at the bar and the tables. He was hustling and never made us feel like we were waiting. My boyfriend ordered the Mac and cheese with lobster and I had the Mac and cheese with chorizo. Both were phenomenal.

First off, the service was great! This place is usually a packed house everyday so I called around 4 to see what it would be like if we were to arrive around 7. They do not take reservations but they were more than happy to take my number down and essentially aim to seat me around 7 by giving me a call when the table was ready. As promised, they had called around 7 and told me that we would be seated around 7:30 which was fine considering they do not have a reservation policy. Once 7:30 came, they called us and we were seated. They had a good selection of beer at very reasonable prices. My friend and I got two entrees to share which was great because the portions are big enough to split happily. Mac and Cheese-The menu warns that it will take about 25 minutes and it really did have a wait but I respect a place being upfront about it. It also meant that this mac and cheese was freshly made. It sure did taste like it. There was a beautiful crunchy crust of cheese on top and soft, gooey mac and cheese in the middle. We added $3 for mushroom and white truffle and that white truffle nicely shined in the dish. Paella- tons of seafood and meat. The rice was wonderfully cooked and flavored beautifully with the perfectly seared scallops, juicy chorizo, super bacony slab of bacon, soft lobster and big pieces of whole shrimp. Everything was really delicious and the atmosphere of the restaurant was so nice and casual for catching up with old friends. This place is definitely worth the try when in the Upper East Side.",6,,2

They have a great wine selection and the server didn't mind letting me try different types of wine when I wasn't sure what I wanted. Food was good. We got the paella from the menu and a seafood special (scallops, shrimp, sea bass). We were at first doubtful because we both ordered seafood dishes but neither disappointed. So delicious.

The shrimp tacos looked amazing, so I'll have to make my way back soon!",2,4,1
61,Kristina C.,"New York, NY",124,21,7,4.0,5/17/2017,"Came here for dinner and drinks last night and it was a really nice experience! The place is super tiny/cozy, but we got lucky and got a table with no wait (around 6pm on a Tuesday). Appetizers: guacamole and chips and tuna tartare. Tuna was absolutely delicious! A nice big portion with bread and grapefruit and a flavorful green sauce - could have used more bread with it, but it was great. Guacamole was also delicious and quite a decent sized portion, although I could have used more chips. For main course I had the chorizo Mac and cheese, which was sooooo good. It was definitely prepared super fresh (even the menu says 25 min wait for mac and cheese), was bubbling hot and the chorizo was plentiful. They use a different type of pasta than I expected which made it feel even more ""homemade"" as if I was really in someone's house by the side of the road :)",1,1,
62,Tina T.,"Manhattan, NY",13,115,201,5.0,8/5/2016,"My boyfriend really hit the nail on the head when he chose this restaurant for our post-museum date night. It has all the quirks & charms that I adore: small cozy space, homey + inviting decor, stellar wine collection, and AMAZING food. This is a very small place. As in you need to squish through to get to the small bathroom. As in you may be seated at the bar/table where you will be rubbing elbows with somebody else. Some people don't like that, but trust me I didn't mind at all. There is only one chef I believe, who works the magic in the back room. Therefore, your meals will take time and your AMAZING dessert will take even longer. We tried the short rib which was huge & juicy & fall off the bone deliciousness. Probably the best short rib ever. My gnocchi with lamb ragout was beyond delicious though, with the best gnocchi I've ever had. So soft & flavorful at the same time  Finally, the date pudding. It took 25 minutes & I secretly questioned why my boyfriend didn't order the chocolate soufflé instead. Date pudding however ...equals tears of deliciousness. So so perfectly balanced as it not too sweet but the caramel sauce it laid on was just so buttery. One of the best desserts I've ever had although I don't even like desserts that much. I was going to give this place a four stars because: 1. Expensive for space + ambiance (more homely inviting = more affordable no?) 2. Expensive wine list. However, by the time I finished this review, I realized that this place had many ""best I've ever had""- which definitely says something. Hits a lot of categories that I haven't experienced at even highly rated restaurants. I realize I would definitely spend more for quality, delicious food. Therefore, if you're in this area, do yourself a favor and come asap and wait the 1 hr wait time. It's very worth it.",9,1,2
63,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,4.0,3/25/2017,"Heidi's House is a very cozy and tiny space in UES (literally about five tables and bar seating). I highly recommend calling 2 hours in advance to put your name down for a specific time. It doesn't guarantee you seating at that specific time, but it does cut down your wait time significantly. I did so for my party of 3 for 6:30 on a Saturday, and waited about 30 minutes for seating (whereas other patrons faced 2 hours wait time). I ordered the seafood tagliatelle, which came out with scallops, shrimp, baby octopus, roasted tomatoes. I quite enjoyed the homemade tagliatelle, which was perfectly al dente with that perfect bite. The seafood was also plentiful. I am a bit hesitant to give five stars for the dish, however, as the textures somehow all blended together so that the scallops had a more chewy texture like the shrimp and the baby octopus not as chewy as it would otherwise be. But it tasted homemade with that professional touch, and I still enjoyed it. We also split the chocolate souffle, which was tasty but not memorable. I expected an ooey gooey chocolatey center and at least some kind of mousse or cream on top for that balance, but we didn't get that. Nonetheless, the souffle was warm and airy.I am a bit torn as to whether I would return. On the one hand, the ambiance here is lovely and the food tasty (my friends had the baby back ribs and the burger, which they both enjoyed). But I think there must be some shortage in staff as there was only one waiter for the entire restaurant, which meant that everything took FOREVER - the drinks order, the food, etc. We even put in our order for the souffle with the entree because we knew that it would take 15 minutes, but it still took another 10 minutes for the souffle to come out. Seeing the waiter move so fast all the time kind of detracted from the cozy atmosphere, and I felt bad to flag him down for things or felt that I should order everything at once. I know it's largely part of my specific dining sensibility, but if that sort of frantic atmosphere dampens the ambiance for you, then I think you should certainly be aware when you come!",5,1,2
64,Marisa C.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,96,0,5.0,7/6/2017,"Can you say LOVE?!A small, out of the way, cozy restaurant that serves some of the best food I've ever had! They have the smallest kitchen from which delicious foods come out that I don't even know how they do it! They have seasonal menus which we've tried a couple of times if it appeals to us, and it never disappoints. Seriously, they take comfort food to a whole other level that you'll never want to come down from. I especially love their paella and mac and cheese, and we almost always order those when we're there. We've also had their burger and pastas, and those have been just as good. And don't forget about the dessert, it's all delicious, you can't go wrong with any of the choices!It's not the cheapest joint in town, but it's really not that expensive. And for what you're getting, so worth it! The flavors are just amazing and the food portions are very generous, I think we often leave with leftovers. Actually, probably not, because the food is so good I can't stop eating even when I'm full. Yes, I'm serious.Remember this is a very small place so there's not a lot of seats, meaning there's going to be a bit of wait. But guess what they do?! You can call in to place your name on the waiting list! That's right, if you call and tell them you want a table for however many people, they'll call you back about 10 minutes before they're ready for you and you can just walk on down there and have a table ready by the time you arrive (assuming you live close by like we do). That means no waiting around outside for an hour for a table. And honestly, a few times we've called, they had a table ready right away and they would hold it for us. They're that awesome. Of course it doesn't help that the owners and staff are super friendly and always accommodating. Seriously, if you're in the neighborhood, you have to pop on by. And if you live around here and you've never been, all I can ask is how is that possible?!",,,

Since this place is big on wine, it's definitely worth to buy a bottle so you can savor it as you eat. The biggest con? It's EXTREMELY small and if you might have to wait FOREVER if you don't get here before certain times. Service was good, but could have been better.

This is one of those rare and amazing places that has incredible food, atmosphere, and pricing.  After one visit, I've definitely not had my fill and will be back.Really a 4.5 star review here, the bump-down is because it's so, so difficult to get a seat (so much for being a hidden gem!) and some of the food/service can take a long time (e.g., 20 min for the date pudding--still worth it!).",1,,

It's cute and charming and I think the contrast between its atmosphere and all the generic sports bars and gastropubs nearby with their blue-shirted UES bro clientele  is what's inflating Heidi's rating. But the food for us was an extremely overpriced let down.  We got one of the special salads which was $20 and was underdressed, lacking in goodies, and featuring a lot of fried artichoke leaves that were extremely tough and basically inedible.  The much loved mac and cheese was just OK.

BUT, it is a small price to pay for the food!I can't recall exactly what I had as it's been a couple of months since our trip, but I had a shrimp salad, and my husband had the paella. We both each got two drinks (two glasses of prosecco and two hard ciders). We also got some sort of chocolate tart or creme brûlée for dessert, and it was absolutely remarkable.

73,Chloe C.,"Manhattan, NY",229,199,1033,4.0,4/14/2016,"This place is listed under ""comfort food"", and comfort is definitely what Heidi's House offered my cousin and me. We were waiting anxiously for a family member to wake up from surgery nearby. Once we examined her and heard her speak with our own ears, we realized the thunderous booms echoing throughout Lenox Hill Hospital were our angry, empty stomachs. Kevin M. and I said ""peace out"" to the rest of the fam and told them we'd return with bellies full. It's a very narrow restaurant. To be honest I would spend a great deal of time hating on their slip 'N' slide stools and lack of breathing/standing/eating room, if the food hadn't been so awesome. The menu is rather limited, but they have specials up on the chalk board (not sure how often those change, but there are only a few to choose from. We ordered one appetizer and one entree from the regular menu, and a special - the short ribs. Crabby Dip- pretty solid, but should have had more lump crab meat in this cream cheesy appetizer. It's served with homemade tortilla chips, which are delicious but there aren't enough of them to dip. I'd prefer more carrots over celery, there's plenty of horseradish in this dip, if you're feeling spicy. Seafood Paella: chock full of shrimp, scallops, lobster and a few generous pieces of chorizo and bacon- wow! This was flavorful and a must for any seafood lover - them to hold the pork, if meat isn't your thing. Short ribs: braised with shiitake mushrooms, carrots and other veggies, served on a bed of homemade spinach noodles. The noodles were perfectly al dente, the meat was nicely braised, and needed no knife. It was unbelievably tender mmm. The savory jus was amazing and, I almost wanted to bring the plate to my lips and take a sip...Anyway, the portions here initially looked that small to me, but I wasn't able to finish my food, so they're a bit deceptive (in a good way). Our bill was something like $80, and we both thought everything was great. I would definitely come back, but I'd try to avoid being here when they have more than four other patrons. It's really a small nook, and if you're even a little claustrophobic, don't go when there are people at all. man, I just got hungry for Heidi's House all over again...Until next time",7,4,6

I liked their pear cider (bottled), which was not discounted.  We tried their chorizo tacos and mini mac and cheese from the happy hour menu ($7 each).  The tacos came in a set of two.  The chorizo (pork sausage) was flavorful and the cilantro and fresh squeezed lime was refreshing.  It was a little oily but warm, spicy, tangy, and fresh.  We added lobster (+$5) to our mac and cheese.  Surprisingly, it arrived with large chunks of lobster throughout the bowl and was very filling.  This was another hit!However, the paella ($27) that we ordered in the regular menu was a lot smaller than I had expected.  It's only for one person.  There is more shrimp, chorizo, and seafood than rice but the dish itself was very bland.  It needed more salt, spice, and texture.  It was not very appetizing.Heidi's House offers a lot of dishes that are gluten-free or made from organic ingredients.  This could explain why everything is on the more expensive side (plus you're in the Upper East Side).  I would stick to the happy hour menu.",4,3,3

Updated review","2.5 stars.After several years I went back to this tiny spot to taste their highly rated food. Last time I only had dessert and wine. Go early because they don't take reservations, and the place is packed even 30 minutes after opening time (5pm). Unfortunately, I wasn't as satisfied this time, and am glad I didn't order a lot of food.Paella: not worth the $27 off the menu. The shrimp was completely tasteless, and the lobster was tough. Even the rice was just meh... certainly not up to the standard of a real paella. I didn't find the quality of the ingredients worth the price tag. Dates pudding: a great dessert; 4 delicious bites for $14. I know yelpers love this place, but I do think their prices are outrageous compared to what you actually get. It's true that I didn't order much, but $50+ for a dish of paella and a dessert won't motivate me to return here anytime soon. The service is very good, though.",2,1,
80,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",962,976,2710,4.0,1/27/2015,"So a friend of mine lives in the area and she wanted to try this place out since she heard a lot of goods things. We really enjoyed our meal and it really does feel like dining in someone's house, presumably Heidi. The place is super cozy, intimate but kinda tight. I thought the table handkerchiefs and the bathroom towels really added a homey touch. The place, though small, seemed to run very smoothly and never felt chaotic at any point. There seemed to be a husband and wife team that ran the front of the house, not sure if the lady was Heidi but she was super nice, I really felt like she was taking care of guess at her home as opposed to guess at a restaurant. PS, I really did wish I had room for dessert, the fig pudding and chocolate souffle looked the bomb.com.The food:Tuna Tartar- served with rice chips, avocado puree and wedges of grapefruit. The tartar itself had a nice flavor. I never heard of rice chips but they offered a wonderful crunch. The ratio of dip to chip was actually a good ratio, I hate when I have extra chips. lol The grapefruit, which I don't normally like, worked well with the dish. It offered a nice citrus flavor and they weren't as strong as i remember grapefruit being. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Macaroni & Cheese with bacon- The mac is wonderful, but it does get really greasy and heavy the more you eat it. The pasta they used was Fusilli which was a nice choice since it picks up the sauce well but the pasta was over cooked, it was too soft for me. I am still a little confused with using other pasta for macaroni and cheese, can it still be technically called Mac and cheese at that point? lol And they give a ton of wonderful bacon. Bacon=yum yum. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Seared Pork Chop- mashed potatoes, braised okra and roasted pineapple relish. The pork chop had really nice flavor, but it was a double cut and towards the outside it was a tad tough but it got better then the more toward the center we got. The okra was cooked down and had a nice counter balance to the chop and the pineapple was a nice element of sweetness since sweet and pork work really well. The mash was a miss for me since it didn't have any texture and it was cold when it hit the table. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",10,5,6

83,Juliette M.,"Great Neck, NY",0,70,11,5.0,1/2/2017,"Wow. Been hearing rumblings about this quaint neighborhood spot for a while, but have been putting it off because without a reservation policy, I thought it would be impossible to get in.Last week, on a Thursday, in need of a quiet, drink fueled dinner with my best friend, I gave them a call around 7 to see if there were any open tables. The lovely lady I spoke to asked for my name and said to come right over as there was one bar section still up for grabs. Little did I know, she actually held those seats for us! (An hour later as another table opened up, she turned away two other walk ins because someone else had called and was on their way.) So, pro tip: always call ahead.Their online menu is only a small portion of their actual menu, and that's not even including all of their nightly specials. I was so lucky as to be there on gnocchi with a duck ragu night - WOWZA you guys. I will literally be calling every day to find out when they're having that next. I am a gnocchi connoisseur and I've never had any quite like this - they make them 4x normal size - they're pillows of potato and flour goodness, light yet filling. I also have some food issues and they were so, so helpful (made sure nothing I ate had dairy in it). The organic roasted vegetables were absolutely scrumptious and had this delicious nutty flavor.I cannot recommend this spot enough - it's almost worth moving to the upper east for. Total neighborhood gem!",4,,1

You can expect to wait to get a table since it's so small but you can put down your number and they'll call you when the table is ready. The food selection changes constantly but the chef is great and the specials are always really good! When we went last, we got the grilled seafood 'salad', Mac and cheese and the gnocchi with lamb ragout. The seafood was cooked perfectly and served on top of a bed of wonderfully seasoned mashed potatoes. The gnocchi were soft and delicious, with a good robust ragout to go with it. The Mac and cheese is a menu item but good as always. For dessert I highly recommend the date pudding. It takes a while to make so let them know early, but its amazing and unlike any other dessert I've had. The perfect balance of sweetness and texture, warm and delicious.They have a great selection of beer and an extensive wine list. The staff is just two people but they're both attentive and friendly.",1,,

I have missed out on SO many lovely, delicious meals-- and have a lot of catching up to do now. We went for our anniversary dinner earlier this week and were immediately transported from the bitter cold to a cozy haven that smelled of the most mouth-watering truffle oil mac and cheese. Thankfully, the wait was only 20 minutes and we sipped wine on bar stools until we got our cute little table. Everything at Heidi's House seems perfectly eclectic, from the mismatching napkins to the decor. We ordered the guacamole and cheese plate to start which was great. Then we had the truffle oil mac and cheese and a burger-- both unbelievable. The portions were just enough for one person each, which I appreciated since I tend to overeat delicious food and regret it if there's too large a portion. We had the date pudding for dessert which was a must. I would go back just for this dessert. This restaurant surely deserves its great reviews!",5,1,3

87,James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2730,1914,8247,4.0,1/9/2016,"4.5 stars!This is a fantastic place! It's really hard to get a seat here without waiting, and they don't take reservations, so CALL AHEAD if you want to come here, and come as soon as they open. Most of the seating is at the ""bar"" but there is one larger table for 4, and a bunch of 2-person tables. This place cannot accommodate larger parties. It's absolutely tiny, but it's nice and cozy - one of these hidden gem places since it's on a small side street. The food is high quality and tasty. Here's what we had:1. Gnocchi: This was the pasta special of the night, and it was PHENOMENAL. I loved the larger gnocchi, which was so soft, but didn't fall apart. Knowing how challenging it is to make good gnocchi, this is quite a feat. The sauce with beef was amazing. Definitely get their pasta specials to start.2. Lamb shank: This is not on the menu, but was a special for the evening. We saw someone get this, and decided to be greedy and get it too. It was quite good and came with a side of sauteed spinach. I think this dish is standard, not amazing, but definitely solidly prepared. The meat could have been more tender and the sauce slightly less salty.3. Paella: Not prepared in your standard way, but the seafood they used was high quality. Perfectly seared sea scallops, jumbo shrimp, lobster. The rice had a nice texture to it. It was decently portioned. I would also say, like the lamb shank, it was a solid dish, but not amazing.4. Date pudding: MUST GET. I think this will be in your top 10 of best desserts you've ever had. It comes out very hot with a caramel sauce, and a side of fresh whipped cream. Orgasmic. It's worth coming here just for this dish. The other dessert was the chocolate souffle, but we were too full to try.",13,8,14

We tried this place for the first time today since it got good reviews and I was a bit disappointed.  It was more of a wine bar atmosphere which is nice. We ordered the guac, crab dip and paella and the guac and crab dip tasted good but the portion size was definitely small. The paella was $28 and had a good amount of seafood but didn't really taste like a paella, more like seafood over some rice. The overall portion size of the paella was pretty small as well. Overall I was a bit disappointed by the food considering how much we paid. It could potentially be good for having a few glasses of wine with an app or two.",1,,

We called around 8:30ish pm, were seated by 9:30ish pm..that was a Friday night. We ordered the mac and cheese and the gnoochi salmon special.

Shrimp tacos, mac and cheese with bacon (soooo generous with the bacon), the pasta special which was the fettuccine with lamb ragout and basil parmesan (so good and warm and comforting), and the date pudding for dessert which was just the right amount of sweetness. It was a little pricey and it's very close quarters/small table space, but our waiter, who also served as the bartender and host, was nice and not difficult to get ahold of, the place had a warm ambience, and the experience overall was very enjoyable.

The mac n' cheese is served in this casserole crock, piping hot and still bubbling. The dish was really really yummy.

On top of a completely overcooked burger, the fact that there is no sauce on the burger added to the tastelessness. I asked for a side of ranch-- something they do not carry. I'd go as far as say this was one of the worse burgers I've had in a long time. My friend had the mac n cheese and said it was amazing-- something I trust her on as she loves mac n cheese.

The best part of the meal was the chocolate soufflé this is a must if you come here! This is perfect for an intimate night with your beau or catching up with a friend. It's not good for a big group though since it's super small. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar which was great because we got to talk to the host who was more than welcoming.

Just the plumpest of potato dough buggers you could ever find, and melts the instant it hits your hungry mouth. So. Tender. So. Delicious. I'm not sure if it's even cooked, it's just so soft, I can't even handle it. The medley of cherry tomatoes, chiffonade of basil and parmesan just takes it over the top. It's a no-brainer to get it if it's available on special. No. Brain. Needed!We tried the burger also. Comes on English muffin, with fresh fixins of lettuce, onion and tomato. We ordered medium rare, but it came medium well - tasted pretty good despite, though a bit dry.  The English muffin is a tough bread option - kind of fell apart halfway through, but otherwise a solid burger.Two dessert options here are enough - chocolate souffle or date pudding. The hot date pudding, with a bourbon-infused caramel sauce, was amazing, but a return visit beckons for that beautiful chocolate souffle.  There will be a next time. Friendliest service.

Crust on top of pasta was overdone to the point that it wouldn't easily break by using a fork. Chocolate soufflé dessert was not worth $14. I make a better homemade chocolate lava cake at home!

109,Ed S.,"New York, NY",10,316,75,4.0,8/11/2015,"Ordered a medium rare cheeseburger, mac n cheese, roasted veggies, chocolate soufflé and date pudding. The cheeseburger was a perfect medium rare, like it could be used as the textbook definition. It also had flavor. The fries were the only bummer, being on the shrunken dry side like they'd been sitting around a while. The mac n cheese was creamy w/ a chewy top that was crunchy around the sides of the bowl. The cheese itself was mild instead of being salty or overpowering.Desserts were basically perfect and coffee was served in a French press. The only downsides were the dried out fries and that the only tables were high tops. I can see why this place is always crowded. The food is well made and tasty.",2,1,1
110,Yuning Z.,"New York, NY",465,34,2,5.0,11/1/2016,Fantastic food at this hole in the wall. They have rotating specials with a few main staples. I had the long island duck which was delicious. We also had the gnocchi which was delicious and had an amazing ragu. The date pudding was good but not worth the hype TBH.We managed to get in without a reservation but apparently you need to call ahead of time to get seated. Fantastic food albeit a bit pricey. Would highly recommend for a date spot as the restaurant is tiny and intimate.,1,,

The food was absolutely amazing, we started with the bruschetta and the buffalo mozzarella salad. The cheese was the best I've had in a very long time (if ever) and the fried capers were a life changer. For dinner I had a special, the braised leg of lamb which was cooked so perfectly and my friend has the gnocchi, which was melt in your mouth delicious. Not only the food, but the wine was great, a large variety of great selections. And to top it off the service was excellent. Alexa and Freddy were both friendly and helpful. Probably the best service I've ever received. I will go back whenever I have the chance!",,,

The place is really small but super charming and cozy - a hand full of high top tables plus bar seating. Definitely not the place to come with a large group. Because of the size and the great food, the place gets busy. I did what other Yelpers had suggested and called about an hour ahead (they don't do actual reservations). Spoke the lady (I think it was Heidi herself!) who was really nice and told us she'd call us 15 minutes before our table would be ready.

There are no reservations but if you call ahead they will put you on a list. We got called back much earlier than expected Agee being quoted with a 1 to 1.5 hour wait. Tiny restaurant with mostly bar seating, so it's best for two diners. Dimly lit with fun, quirky decorations. The main menu was basically burger, paella, and variations of macaroni and cheese, plus small plates and specials. FANTASTIC food!! Also, huge plus is that it is VERY gluten free friendly!! Even gluten free Mac n cheese, wow. Definitely go if you are gluten free. Definitely go if you aren't. Great for a date night!",,,

Now, 9pm is fairly late for the neighborhood (Yorkville), and so I was surprised that I would have to wait at all, but Heidi's House is relatively small, and the demand for its seats most certainly high.We (party of two) waited the hour. Less, really. We were called after a half hour or so, and made our way over to be seated. Sangria unfortunately ran out, so we settled on beers, and ordered the Mac & Cheese w/ Mushrooms and White Truffle Oil and the Seared Octopus something or other (it came with a medley of seafood and was served on a bed of squash, I think, purée). The food was very simply, very modest. No cutting edge technique or brilliant plating or striking flavor combinations here. What we had instead was an exceptionally wholesome meal. It was unpretentious food done perfect, and both of us left dinner not only completely satisfied and happy with our experience (the ambience is lovely; dim to just my liking, easy to talk, not particularly loud, etc.) but not nearly as gross-feeling as we would have felt had we had a big skillet of Mac & Cheese just about anywhere else. That's another thing about Heidi's House, the food (or what we tried of it anyway) is very healthy, not loaded with oils, fats, and other snags that, though delicious tasting (and sometimes used, in fact, to bail out less naturally delicious tasting food), can also be very burdensome, can make one feel like one has to lie down for about ten hours. We'll be back again, for sure.",,,

The truffle mushroom Mac and cheese was divine and the chorizo was good as well, but too spicy for me.  It wasn't crazy spicy but I'm a wimp.  I had the chilled Spanish red which was yummy.  Dessert was the chocolate soufflé and the date pudding.  My first time with date pudding and it was great!   The soufflé too.   Great owners and staff.

I was waiting for my girlfriend who was waking from her apartment a few blocks away. In the 5 minutes it took for my friend to get there, the middle aged man working there named FREDDY came over to me literally 3 times asking where my friend was. Not a soul was in the place, it was really absolutely ridiculous and I should have gotten up and left. He was harassing me and made me really nervous. He was so unprofessional and cold. What's worse than that is he refused to bring us water - we asked at least twice. Our shrimp tacos came undercooked and the whole experience was awful. He was the most arrogant and rude server I ever had. I'm so sorry that you think you are better than everyone because you are a waiter in a tiny upper east side snobby cafe. Pathetic",1,1,
126,Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",272,331,315,5.0,1/26/2014,"What a hidden gem!!! The space is small-- just a few tables and a bar in a little, narrow space. But it's totally worth waiting for a table. They offer to take your number and they will call you and give you a 15 min warning that your table is about to free  up, which I think is so cool of them! But be warned- this place is best for parties of 2 or - max- 4. Larger than that and there is truly no way they can accommodate you. Atmosphere is warm, inviting, and cozy. They had board games that you can pull out and play with if you so desire, which was such a cute touch and added to the casual and friendly vibe. The menu is small and rotates often. They only serve beer and wine, but the selections were impressive for both and my friend and I had a spectacular Syrah. The boys had really good craft beers as well. We ordered a bunch of food and ate family style. Food was EXCELLENT! We had hummus, tuna tartare, olives, and two of the cheeses. Cheese was kind of skimpy in portion size, so order at least 2 or 3. Came with some jam and almonds, but it was definitely ""snack"" size, which is how they label it to indicate that the portions aren't going to be too huge. For mains, we tried the gnocchi, paella, assorted roasted veggies, lobster Mac & Cheese and chorizo Mac & Cheese. Portions again are small enough that for four of us, that actually was a goodportion of food. The Mac & Cheese was insanely delicious, with a perfect cheesy crust on the top. I tried the paella and it was also fantastic-- generous on the fish and meat with less rice, which is the sign of a great paella. The gnocchi was also fantastic-- they melted in your mouth. All the selections were ideal for a cold, Jan evening. Highly recommend but make sure to call ahead and find out what the availability looks like, first!",1,,

We went there and after seeing a small, homey kind of place I was expecting something like comfort food. I got an interesting little place that served a variety of things and seemed to be getting to big for the small space they had. The mac and cheese was okay. We got it plain because adding bacon or chorizo was on the pricier side. The shrimp tacos were a better deal, though there was only three of them they were fairly bursting with shrimp. I was imagining  maybe three small shrimp but I got some medium sized shrimp and in a good handful per taco. They are taqueria sized though and for 12 bucks a little on the steep side.While the food is pretty good, the price for what you get is a little high. The small space fills up quickly when you get more than 1 or 2 groups waiting to come in and it can get pretty claustrophobic while you wait as well.",1,,

The kind man behind the bar was managing all of tables and bar patrons with an ease I've never seen before in this city. I got the mac&cheese, which you are required by New York State law to try if you enter here. I also had the unique pleasure of trying a burger as well.

Only 3 tacos though, so make sure you're with someone that is okay if you have 2:1 :). My bf said the hamburger was great and fresh. The Mac&Cheese was the best I've ever had (1000x better than The Smith's), but SO heavy. I would recommend forcing yourself to only eat 1/2; you'll push to eat more. The Date Pudding was absolutely outstanding-- one of the top 5 desserts we have both ever eaten. SO.GOOD. I wasn't a huge fan of their red sangria, but my bf did love his apple cider beer (not sure the exact name) but it was very light, refreshing, and apple-juice-like. We had NO complaints about the food, but the ambiance was totally juxtaposed to our food-experience.

We got there around 7:45 p.m. on a Saturday, and I hadn't realized just how minuscule this place would be. It's a tiny room with one side taken up by a lovely wooden bar, and the other by a few two-top bar tables; and the back of the room is the little kitchen, which is separated from the seating area by a Japanese-style sliding screen. The lighting is cozy and dim with votives perched on the window frames of the front window and a few creative hanging lamps throughout. The music was mostly Gypsy jazz, and the overall feel of this restaurant is Bohemian enclave.We got seated at the bar, which is actually the best option as the bartender is also the waiter for the entire restaurant. They have a nice section of craft beer, and so we ordered  an Allagash white and an Einstok porter, both delish (my husband also had a Lion stout later that was unique and STRONG).We started with the garlicky olives, which were okay not great. I had broccoli soup that was light and included scallops and the bruschetta which was chewy and had capers and fresh cherry tomatoes and lots of melted cheese. My husband enjoyed his open-face lamb burger thoroughly. The highlight and denouement of the meal was the date bread pudding. It was hot and very moist with a delicious liquor-infused sauce (maybe cognac?) and fresh whipped cream to cool off each mouthful.Heidi's House was a great dining experience and the service was very good considering there was just one server for 20 people.Highly recommend.",2,,1
139,Natalie Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,73,20,3.0,6/12/2016,"Tristan and I walked in at around 6 pm on a Wednesday night, and it was not packed (except for the bar). This place is best for 1-2 people, and the max they seat is 4 people with their one larger table. It is extremely cramped and extremely tiny; it is as big as a bedroom. The comfort food description is spot-on; unfortunately, the food and dark lighting is extremely misleading. It gives off the vibe that this is a great, intimate 'date' place, when it is not. It gets loud since the seating is directly juxtaposed to the bar, and you are squished next to a brick wall. I ordered the gnocchi special of the night (gnocchi eggplant basil tapenade with parmesan truffle oil). YUM what a mouthful. It was sooooo good and perfect amount to fill you up with room for dessert. The gnocchi is so mouthwatering and fresh/soft/ooeygooey all things you want in life! Tristan played it safe, his usual boring self ugh, and ordered a burger. He asked me if this was a brunch place because they served their patty on an english muffin- what a little curious cutie we have on our hands! He said the burger was solid/good. The chocolate souffle was our choice of dessert, and it is really delish but not mind blowing. Maybe, we should have opted for the date pudding (but Tristan always plays it safe Harumph). I recommend going here with a foodie friend for dinner!!*sidenote: i forgot to mention the service. there is only one man running the whole operation, and he can get grumpy/stressed. I suggest more staffing, but this place is so small they can't really fit more than one worker. I'm also sure he is the owner, but that is such a bad way to operate with no help. He messed up the charge on our bill and we had to beg for water refills.*",,1,

We were both very happy with our meals. The steak was suppose to be medium well and was actually medium rare (receipt shows waiter didn't order correctly). It had great flavor.

Tiny restaurant and bar, Heidi's has probably 6 tables and a small bar. The atmosphere is cozy, warm and homey. The servers are warm and friendly. There are no mixed drinks. Wine (and I think beer) only but the wine selection is superb. And the food is TOP NOTCH. How they prepare this quality food in a kitchen the size of a large NYC bathroom is nothing short of a miracle. But it's an interesting menu with some amazing staples. I hesitate to spread the word because it's already so hard to get in (they don't take reservations). But it's worth the wait.",,,
149,Yeonjoo C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",250,5,2,5.0,1/6/2016,"My friend and I were originally trying to eat at Uva around the corner, but thankfully they were completely booked for the evening because we discovered Heidi's House!!! I also agree with others in saying that comfort food is probably not the best way to describe the food they have. But regardless of the category, their food is incredibly amazing. We got the seafood paella, which not only is chock full of seafood but also has these amazing thick slices of bacon and chorizo. The chorizo that was in the paella is a little on the drier waxier side but is no less delicious! It is not a traditional Spanish paella so if you're looking for authenticity, you will be disappointed. BUT if you are looking for a mouthgasm you will be more than delighted! We also got the mac n cheese. Based on the menu, you have the option of adding things for an extra charge like mushroom, truffle, lobster, chorizo, etc. We went for the chorizo mac n cheese. Scrumptious! As much as I love mac n cheese, I generally find it difficult to finish the whole dish just because it's so heavy. But not this chorizo mac n cheese! The chorizo gave it a nice balance that cut through the fatty heaviness of the cheese. There are two dessert options, the chocolate souffle and the date pudding. As tempting as the souffle sounded, we went with the date pudding just because it sounded so unique. Again, wonderful!! It's more of a bread pudding that comes with a side of this light fluffy cream. The outside of the pudding was lightly caramelized with a soft bready inside. And you could taste and smell the fragrance of dates just beyond the sweet caramel outside. Heidi recommended a excellent Beaujolais to go with our food. She actually let us taste a few wines before we settled on that bottle. We saw a couple of people order their burger, which also looked divine. Other details, the shop is small. There's bar seating for about 10 and 3-4 tables for two and a slightly larger table for 4. I wouldn't recommend coming with a large party. But for two, it's perfect and cozy. Sit at the bar! We mingled with some great friendly people that night! A great vibe, kind of unusual in New York but so much fun! The place is run by Heidi and her husband and their son. Everything is cozy and intimate, wonderfully homey. Out of all numerous places I visited in New York, Heidi's was my favorite! I will definitely try to make this a regular dinner spot every time I'm in New York!",3,,

Heidi's House epitomizes 'cozy'- from the warmly lit ambiance to the menu selection and even the service. Me and my friend ordered the bruschetta to start and it was incredible. Not traditionally what we were expecting, but definitely better- all the vegetables were so fresh and perfectly cooked and the mozzarella was pretty divine. For mains we ordered the gnocchi with duck ragout and truffle oil mac and cheese. The mac and cheese were really hearty, but to me the gnocchi was the standout dish. The duck was tender and tasted perfect and was a good topping for perfectly cooked pan-seared gnocchi. All in all an amazing restaurant that clearly takes pride in what they serve. I only wish I'd had the foresight and time to get that chocolate souffle- I don't know how I could've fit it in my stomach, but where there's a will there's a way. I will definitely be back for more bruschetta, gnocchi, and to try that souffle.",,,

Small menu, and the food is a little on the pricier side ($15 for dessert and $27ish for paella), but the quality is high and the ingredients are fresh. I highly recommend the date pudding and the gnocchi, which I don't usually order but really enjoyed here -- it's still starchy as gnocchi typically is, but the potato soaks in the ragu really well and doesn't seem overly rich or mushy.",1,,

He managed the bar and food service for the entire restaurant, all on his own. It was awesome to see him in action, all the while remaining friendly and very approachable. We started out with two glasses of red wine, both of which were delicious. We shared plates of the Tuna Tar Tar, Seafood Paella, Shrimp Tacos and the souffle and bread pudding chocolate dessert.

They have a great wine selection and the servers are very nice.Gnocchi - This is a special that they often have. The gnocchi is perfectly cooked and comes in a delicious broth with tomatoes.

I had the roast pork shank last time and it was great.There is always low-key jazzy music, and the overall vibe of the restaurant feels like a mix of 60's West Village creativity plus small Chinese influence. It's both classy and casual at the same time. They also have a few board games that are placed behind the counter if you want to play. Another thing that really sticks out is the bathroom, which is one of the most unique and charming bathrooms I've ever been in.

It was well worth the wait..We got two seats at the bar and ordered the bruschetta appetizer with a nice bottle of cab. The bartender was very friendly and welcoming. She had some great food recommendations too. I originally was going to order the mac and cheese plain but she suggested that I order it with mushrooms and truffle oil.. I was not disappointed. It was fantastic. The vibe in Heidi house is exactly what you look for on a cold fall night when all you want in the world is delicious comforting food and good company. Can't wait to come back.. Maybe a little more sober next time :),3,,

It's definitely more fun when Heidi is there.  She is really friendly, funny, and livens the place up.  She always manages to find a way to get my girlfriend and I to talk to the people next to us.  She kind of reminds me of Claire from Modern Family.  The place is really small, but I feel like it somehow it works in its favor.  You will end up sitting at the bar or one of the three or so tables against the wall parallel to the bar.  There is only one table that will fit more than two people but you can typically find three seats in a row at the bar most nights, if not you will only have to wait a few minutes.  They have a good wine/beer/cider selection.  The food is all local and organic.  The service is pretty good considering the bartender is also the waiter/waitress.  If they are really busy they will call you when a table opens up.  In someone's review they complained about this, but it always works out fine for me.I almost forgot to mention the games.  Heidi has some vintage board games by the door that are pretty fun to play when the place clears out late night.",1,,

170,Jeff S.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,2.0,3/26/2017,"Great ambiance and ambitious menu.  But let's talk about the food, specifically the burger.Over the past year I've visited Heidi's about six times and eaten most food on the menu.  Here I want to specifically review their burger, a $14 grass fed patty served on a toasted english muffin with a side of fries.Is this actually a grilled burger? One wonders. Its charred on the outside and very well done and evenly cooked throughout. A grass fed patty, it has a very bland taste--think back to the Sysco hamburger patties of your elementary school youth. Just like that product, this burger is consistently overcooked, and accompanied by fries that are rubbery and greasy.  The brutal reality is that almost any bar or diner serves a tastier burger. It's really that bad. I'm inclined to think they aren't grilling this burger at all, that it may be a sous-vide preparation that is finished in a saute pan to get a char on the surface.  What's missing is a charred delicious burger eating experience with some fat and the suppleness of a medium-rare preparation.  Heidi's gets many other dishes just right: mac and cheese, salads, etcetera.  It's a shame that a place that cares this much about food and ambiance serves such a mediocre burger. Diners beware: this will be the worst burger you can eat in a 10 block radius.",,,

This place is not overrated, not overcrowded (just cozy enough!), and not overpriced for idiotically small portions. This place is truly homey. Tiny place with four tables, a bar, no tvs, and nice people. More than 'comfort,' they serve delicious new American food. Happy hour is great-runs until 6pm and they have 'mini' portions of many of their items, which aren't terribly mini. I made a meal out of the mini crab dip and mac n cheese, the latter which was a dinner size plate. Beers are $1 off, wines $2. Excellent selection of beer (bottled only but who cares if you can drink Bells IPA for $5?!) and wine. Even if you're stuffed like a Cherpumple, make room for the date pudding! Served with non-sweetened freshly whipped cream and sticky date sauce, as if they knew what kind of dessert I love to eat.

If there is something that's not good here, why serve it?I was considering a cider originally, but was convinced to get an Allagash white beer that did not disappoint. We ordered the mini guacamole to share, but they accidentally gave us a regular-sized order. Mildly spicy and addictive, we finished the entire plate (it would have been wasteful otherwise).

As all of downtown lacked power, Heidi's House was a lovely oasis.  Tucked away on a quiet street, it went unnoticed by many downtowners seeking refuge. Heidi, herself, was there serving an abridged menu, but the mac and cheese, crab dip and hummus never tasted so good. I've been back several times since and always feel cozy. I learned to play the board game, master mind, there. On occasion, I play battle ship. My favorite items are the bruschetta, mac and cheese with chorizo, crab dip, and bread pudding.

Very early.Heidi's House has been on my list of places to try for a very long time, and when I found myself in the UES unexpectedly, I knew I had to finally try it. From the outside, it doesn't look like much; it looks sort of like an upscale dive. Yet, as you walk in, you're suddenly transported to a cozy nook. My friend and I arrived a little after five, right when it opened, and there was already a good amount of people there. Keep in mind, there is a bar with around ten stools and about five tables, which was why I said to get there very early. On a Friday night throughout the meal, I noticed many people who walked out because they didn't want to endure the wait. We placed our orders: two mac-n-cheeses (I only recently became an adult, give me a break). Even though it took a while, we both had a feeling that we were going to be receiving something spectacular, and it was true. Two dishes were placed in front of us, where the cheesy crust was still bubbling on top. I knew that I was totally going to burn my mouth, but my inner chub really didn't care at that point. When digging your fork in, the corkscrew pasta perfectly drags the stretchy cheese along with it, and you can only rush yourself to cool it down as quickly as possible before stuffing it in your mouth. I only burned myself twice in the beginning, but it was all worth it.Personally, the idea of spending thirteen dollars on mac-n-cheese is something my Asian mamma would've bopped my head for, but it really was worth it. It was some of the best comfort food I've ever had, and I was full only halfway through the dish. While I could've gotten chorizo or bacon added, I'm happy I didn't since the cheese on top did create this salty crust that would've been a bit too much had I went for those additions.Overall, the only thing that stopped HH from getting that final star was the service. I felt bad for the guy behind the counter because on a busy Friday night, he was the only one in the FOH. Waters were never refilled at my table, and the bar was slammed, so it took a while to get the check. I do commend him for being to handle everything alone, god knows I wouldn't have been able to.Do make the trip to come to Heidi's House. I came in feeling gluttonous, and I came out as happy and full as Buddha. Also, make sure to check out the bathroom. I screamed at first, until I realized that it was only dried roses hanging up from the ceiling, which I thought only added to the great charm that this restaurant already had.",2,,

Updated review","Uh oh, the slow decline...I think they changed ownership? Not sure. Something felt different about last night and I can't put my finger on it.The menu's totally changed. I assume because it's now summer. Ordered the gnocci special and the roasted leg of lamb. The lamb was decent, the sauces were nice. Three slices of lamb stuffed with spinach and mashed potatoes = $27. In my opinion, as good as it was, it was a little pricey. The gnocchi flavoring was good but the gnocchi themselves were very off putting. I think the gnocchi dough was off that night because the texture was wrong. It had the consistency of mashed potatoes and not gnocchi. It just didn't hold it's shape and tasted like balls of mashed potatoes that had been thrown on the plate. The asparagus, mushrooms, and truffle sauce was fantastic though! I just wish the gnocchi looked more like... gnocchi! The dish was $20. I could've definitely had better gnocci elsewhere for less.Nonetheless, service was fantastic and friendly, as usual. The service was quick this time, and I still love the cozy ambiance. I just found the food incredibly expensive this time around and I'm not sure it was worth it to spend $60 (before tip) on two entrees and a small side of roasted veggies. I will still return though. Love Heidi's and want to give it another shot.",1,,

Hopefully, the management from this restaurant would read the reviews and improve the customer service training to their staff.Unacceptably poor customer service from the host/only server. I arrived at the restaurant at 5:40pm, got a table and was waiting for my fiancé to come, he's finding a parking spot. I wasn't served or asked what to drink at all, until 5:50 the only server/host came and asked when would my friend be here, I told him he's parking and would be here soon. I asked him if I could have some tap water for now. He left without bringing the water back. At 6, he came to me again (I still wasn't served with any water), I was on a phone call, he rudely interrupted and said he had already sent two groups of people away and asked me to leave the table and wait for the next table. I paused my phone call and said I wasn't even served with water yet and I could start to order before my fiancé arrived. Then he's like ""ok, tell me what you want to order"", I said I would like some water first, you haven't even served me with water. Then he went ""Jesus!"" finger drawing circle at his temple. I was pissed by his rudeness and poor customer service. If you can't let me sit and wait for someone to come, you could have just told me at the very beginning that I had to wait until everyone from my party is here in order to be seated. All he cared about was whether I ordered or not, but not even bothered to serve me water to drink. I think asking the customers what to drink once they are seated is what a server would do in pretty much every restaurant. My fiancé arrived at 6:05, he just sat down, and the host came to us right away and asked what do we want to order, not even giving him a second to look at the menu. My fiancé told him that he needed a couple minutes to look at the menu. Such poor customer service shouldn't be found in any restaurants not to mention restaurants in this area, where most restaurants have high standard of customer service. We finally ordered hummus as our appetizer and he again asked us rudely ""and what else?"". We were like we would like to go with the appetizer first. Then he left rudely without saying a word! We finally ordered paella, Mac & cheese and date pudding. Paella is very so so. Mac & cheese is good but I don't think it's impressive. The thing I like the most is probably the date pudding. I'll consider it as something special and it does taste good.",5,4,1

Our bartender let made us taste different wine so we could choose the one we liked the most. I love that it's relatively quiet and you can actually talk to the person you are with. You can't book a table but you can call to be on the waiting list at a certain time. Probably my comfort food HQ from now one!",,1,1
186,Thy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,314,369,5.0,3/15/2014,"Call at 5 day of to be put on wait list, the place has 25 seats at most, but is well worth it!  Comfort food to the max!Came as a group of 4 for dinner. Olives are ok, guac is delish just wish the portion size was bigger. Lobster mac and cheese is delish, hamburger is moist with yummy cheese, tomato, onions, lettuce.  Vegetable side of brussel sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, beets is god accompaniment. Chocolate soufflé was good, but date pudding with rum caramel was the best!",1,,
187,Burma J.,"Chicago, IL",4,37,4,5.0,6/28/2015,"Heidi's is an absolute gem.This is the kind of place that doesn't seem to exist very often in New York; no less, the UES. It's a cozy, comfortable, familiar atmosphere. While we were there, Heidi was at the helm- mistress of ceremonies, master of the house, proud owner and charm machine. I would love to have coffee with that woman, she seems amazing.The menu itself has a nice eclectic, elegant element with a variety of specials that feel 'special'. Had a beautiful homey gnocchi with shrimp and arugula that left me dying.I genuinely liked that there were a true range of options and prices to fit every budget; you could manage to enjoy the night and spend less with certain selections of booze, starters, and mains, or splurge and go balls out. It has a casual europeaness that's accommodating to everyone.  You have to like that. The restaurant is small: get there early or be free for a wait. They appear to have a reliable system in place for taking names and giving calls when they have a seat ready- be it bar-style or table. Be flexible, you'll enjoy your dinner.",1,,1
188,Tanya M.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,48,20,4.0,10/23/2016,"This place had a very cute and homey atmosphere and the food was delicious. We ordered the duck ravioli special and the mac and cheese. Both were delicious. We ended with the date pudding. I am generally not a fan of dates or pudding but the waiter raved about it so gave it a go. It was good, given that I'm generally not a fan of that dessert. Be warned that the place is super tiny so probably not great to go with more than 2 people or during peak hours.",,,
189,Tiantian W.,"Arcadia, CA",102,2,0,5.0,11/10/2016,Great service! I have been here twice and all the food my friends and I ordered have been awesome! Definitely go for the dessert!,,,

For starters we had the shrimp tacos they want to slap your mama good then we had the chorizo shrimp scallop lobster the paella so delicious the flavors were amazing then we had the bacon mac & cheese nice and crispy bacon wonderful flavor the  meal was perfectionAs a grand finale the end of the meal with a delectable date putting so warm and gooey and sweet but not too sweet it was just right the perfect ending to a wonderful meal,,,
191,Jules H.,"New York, NY",7,26,2,5.0,9/15/2016,"If you're looking for the perfect cozy date night spot with excellent food and drinks, look no further than Heidi's House! I love how small and intimate the space is, and with great mood lighting and cute/rustic decor it really sets the scene. As mentioned, I love the food here. Their pasta and mac n cheese are always perfection, especially when accompanied by a beer or glass of wine from their fairly extensive list. While HH may not have the wine list of an Italian restaurant (which I sometimes find debilitating), it was enough of a selection that I didn't feel limited. Highly recommend trying their rotating specials. Whatever the chef is making, you know it's going to be good.",,,
192,Anna W.,"Washington, DC",5,56,9,4.0,4/19/2014,"Great little spot on the upper east side.  Was in the area today and wanted to get some really good comfort food.  I've scoped this restaurant once before but another restaurant ended up on my stop.The place is extreme small, I mean really only 4 two person high top tables and 1 four person table and then the bar.  No place to even wait really.  We called ahead with an hour wait and got there a bit early.  Once we got seated the menu is mainly drinks like wine and beer and then there is a page of appetizers and then a few entrées. We ordered a sangria to drink which was pretty good.  For dinner we had Mac and Cheese with bacon and gnocchi with duck ragu.  The wait to get the food was rather long but it's worth it.  The Mac and cheese was definitely gourmet and had a nice blend of cheeses.  The gnocchi were so delicious they melted in your mouth.  We did not have room for desert but we saw another table polish theirs off and lick the bowl. A good reason to come back, to get desert.My only complaint is the space is super small and on the way out we couldn't get out the restaurant without asking someone to move.  Also, the menu could use and update with some new dishes.It's still a very delicious place to eat!",,1,
193,Monica V.,"Ventura, CA",54,108,89,3.0,1/25/2014,"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Saturday. Since most reviews said to get there at 5:00pm (when it opened) we did. We were the first to be seated in the tiny restaurant. There were only a few couple seatings tables available and one table for four. The rest of the seats were at the small bar. We opted to sit in the bar next to the kitchen where we saw every dish come out. Happy hour is from 5:00-6:00 which consists of $1 off beers and $2 off wines. There are also mini apps available which we indulged in. We got the mini crab dip and mini mac&cheese. The waiter accidentally ordered us regular sized apps but it was his mistake so he was kind enough to admit it was his mistake and charged us what we originally ordered.Crab dip: ehhh was only so so. I wouldn't order it againMac&cheese: again was only so so. I wouldn't come back for it. I did appreciate the homemade pasta.Cheeseburger: meat lacked flavoring. We had to dip the burger in ketchup to give it flavoring.Date pudding: something I wouldn't regularly order but with all the reviews I had to try it. It was pretty good. Cake was moist. Flavor was something I've never had. It'd go really good with some vanilla bean ice cream!We saw the bruschetta come out which looked the best to me but I didn't have room to try it.Overall, would I come here again?.. Nah. Prices were to high for what you get.",1,,
194,Nikki A.,"New York, NY",269,488,31,3.0,10/9/2013,"I came here for dinner with a friend this week and got the paella and a glass of wine. I really enjoyed the chorizo, lobster and pearled onions in the paella, but found the shrimp to be a little bit rubbery and dry. I also felt that the rice was a little bit dry/ lacking in flavor and had to add a bit of salt. It actually got better as the rice got colder.My friend got the special gnocci of the day and really enjoyed it.The restaurant is very cute and cozy and I really appreciated that we weren't rushed out the second our meal ended. In fact, we were allowed to linger and finish talking, even though the restaurant was bustling. Very nice.Our waiter got a little bit confused when splitting our check and it took a few tries, but it ended up working out. He seemed to be a one-man show, and he overall did an efficient job.The menu is limited, prices are decent, and there is truly a home-y atmosphere. I don't know that I'd return, but I did have a pleasant time.",2,,
195,Poko M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,11,1,5.0,6/12/2017,I love food here. Everything is delicious and they make the best mac and cheese that I ever tried,,,
196,Asmita J.,"New York, NY",232,557,2,3.0,10/30/2013,"This place is always busy - partly because it's tiny. But nonethless, call ahead because there will surely be a wait. In any case, they call you when the table is near ready, so you don't need to wait around. Anyway, my bestest and I shared the mac n cheese and some vegetables. The mac n cheese is quite intense and large, so I'm glad we shared because i would've had a heart attack eating the entire dish. The vegetables were also good, though i wish they were baked in the oven and not steamed? We also tried the souffle, and it definitely wasn't worth the $13. I've made a better souffle, and i am no dessert chef. All in all, a quaint and cute little place in the neighborhood, but overpriced and overhyped for what its worth.",1,1,1
197,Khin Z.,"Woodside, NY",15,206,11,3.0,4/18/2015,"I was really looking forward to this place because of the amazing reviews. I was very disappointed that the food was just OK, and the it was also a little expensive with smaller portions. The place is TINY with a very limited menu with most of it being mac and cheeses. I'm not a big mac and cheese person. seafood paella- It came with big pieces of fresh shrimps and scallops. The chorizo and pork belly were very hard to chew and it was also very salty. The paella rice itself was very dry and it needed more seasoning. bacon mac and cheese- pretty good. It was not too cheesy or creamy. The noodles were twisty noodles and it was cooked well with a nice blend of cheeses. The crispy bacon pieces complemented the dish very well.",2,1,
198,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,5.0,5/23/2011,"Sometimes while walking the streets in this city you can still be surprised by what you will find when going down a block rarely visited. Such was the case this past Friday night when I was on my way to a wine tasting event at a local store. As I was hurrying down 78th street towards York Ave I noticed this quaint little storefront with an old set of table and chairs with flowers and lights adorning them. I did a double take as I walked by, stopped in my path, and walked a few steps backwards to take a peek inside. Turns out, it was a very small wine bar. I grabbed a business card from the table outside and went to the event.As we were finishing up the wine tasting I mentioned we should maybe extend our evening and hit this place up. When we got there it was packed wall to wall with people. As I was standing in the doorway looking around the owner Heidi came over and would not let us leave until she got my number and said she would call when a spot became available for the three of us. We walked around the area for about 20 minutes when the call came to come over. She got us a great spot near the end of the bar overlooking the whole place. It was then that you could really see how small this bar/restaurant really is. Almost shoe box sized, but with a very cozy and homey type feel, and everyone around seemed genuinely happy to be there.As we had pre-gamed during the wine tasting event we were set for more wine, and Heidi's did not disappoint. They have a really nice selection of wines by the glass and bottle at reasonable prices. I had a Cotes du Rhone that was fantastic and had three glasses of it. Dummy! I should have just bought the whole bottle. There is also a diverse selection of craft bottled beers and sodas here too if wine is not your speed. The drinks went down easy all evening, almost too easy, while enjoying constant banter with Heidi at the bar. She is lovely and fun, and really seems to enjoy owning this place and taking care of the patrons.Now for the food. Oh My God! The food here is just awesome. It is basically comfort food tapas style. To start we ordered the hummus made with organic garbonzo beans and warm pita slices. It was pureed into a tasty creamy consistency. We also ordered the guacamole with homemade corn chips and it was terrific. I could not stop eating those chips. Being the starving ravenous animals we are we also ordered the mac and cheese, and the pasta special gnocchi of the day. The mac and cheese came in a bowl with a crunchy top and was made with white cheddar and rotini pasta. Just. Simply. Terrific. The gnocchi was melt in your mouth delicious and was made a little different than usual with tomato, seasoning, and shredded cheese on top. Wow. Wow. Wow. Yes, this place is a food orgasm. As I said, even though the menu is limited, what they do offer is beyond the normal wine bar small plates. Some serious love and thought went into this menu. Plus, there are daily specials on the board placed outside. The gnocchi ran out right after we ordered ours, so get there early if you don't want to miss out. I also noticed the fantastic looking burgers they offer here that others were digging into. Mental note to get that on my next visit.Now dessert is another story, and is crazy good on another level. Only two on the menu - chocolate souffle and date pudding. Now, the souffle was wonderful and creamy made with dark chocolate, but the date pudding was unreal! It is hard to describe, but was served hot with a spicy wonderfulness that actually made us fight over it. Yes, we ordered another immediately! Food. Orgasm. For. Sure.I tell you, this place is simply a terrific gem on the UES. Nothing fancy. Nothing large and obnoxious. Just right. The owner is a super fun person and already knows many of the patrons here. Charming and cozy is an accurate way to describe it. Great service, wonderful food, and terrific wine choices. I almost did not want to write this review for fear that more people will find out about it and make it impossible to get a seat there! She told us it has only been open for about four months, and the crowd has found it now. Good to see a new small business doing well.The things you can still stumble upon in this city amazes me to this day. We fell in lust with this place and will be back for sure! Many times too! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Definitely call for reservations, or get there really early. As there is limited seating, and it is small, you might be placed at the bar, so be aware if that is something that will bother you. We loved being at the bar.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The bathroom is nice and clean, with dried roses hanging from the ceiling, peppermint scented soap, and small fresh towels to dry your hands. You just don't see that in restaurant bathrooms! Nice touch!",16,7,13
199,Lance H.,"Chicago, IL",3,18,10,5.0,3/20/2015,"Take me to church,,,.I think Hozier was inspired to write his tune from this restaurant, not a woman. If the heavens ever did speak, this restaurant would be the last true mouthpiece.So my girlfriend was looking for comfort food, and we found that and more at this tiny cozy gem! She has been living in the UES for years, and this oasis was only a few blocks from her apartment, and yet she had never tried the place. We got there at around 7:30, put our name down for one of the maybe 25 seats. No place to wait, but wait we did. We smelled  the food when we walked in, and committed to waiting. So we went to a bar around the corner and had a drink. About 40 minutes later we found out two seats opened up. The place is inviting and oozing with charm. We found ourselves at the bar seating, The wine selection was decent and we arrived on a nice red for $32 a bottle... Not bad. They had some decent sounding specials. We settled on the advise of the friendly waitress and got one of the restaurant's staples, the Mac and cheese. We added bacon after seeing the diners next to us, and porcini mushrooms with truffle oil. The Mac was out of this world delicious, and the bacon was cooked to perfection. Ohh and the mushrooms,,,, my God did they add something incredible to the dish...We also had one of the specials, braised short ribs. Let me start off by saying these were far and away the most magnificent short ribs I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. They were slow cooked to a fall off the bone satisfaction that left you immediately making plans to return while the special was on the menu. The fat melted slowly on your tongue and was surrounded by a savory gravy. I don't know where this chef comes from, or where they procure the meat at this tiny establishment, but I am in love. The Mac actually worked as a great base for mixed short rib bites. Each taste better than the last. Half way through we ordered the soufflé. As the kind waitress brought the soufflé to our seats, she softly wispered, ""next time get the date pudding, it's better than the soufflé and like nothing I have ever tasted""!!   What, something better than this light, warm, smile generating dark chocolate...  Oh yeah,,, we are coming back!!!!!  It was simply beyond...",3,1,2
