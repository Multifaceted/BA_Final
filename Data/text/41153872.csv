0,Cam E.,"New York, NY",601,196,1228,5.0,1/31/2018,"Free tours of Gracie Mansion are available on the Conservancy website. The current installation NEW YORK 1942 marks the 75th anniversary of the People's House becoming the Mayoral Residence beginning with Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1942.There are many works of Art on display of the era. NEW YORK 1942 - provides a new perspective of NYC, from when the first family of Mayor took residence at Gracie Mansion during WW II amongst much upheaval, change and eventually triumph in the broad landscape of the city. Our group was very lucky and honored to have  Kalia Brooks, the curator of the installation, as our guide. Definitely recommend seeing the installation.  Here are some of the institutions that loaned pieces to the exhibit:  Museum of Modern Art, Noguchi Museum, Whitney Museum of Art, the Municipal Archives, the La Guardia archive at La Guardia Community College, Queens Museum, and Bronx Historical Society. Quite an impressive list!",30,18,30
1,Sophia Fabiola D.,"Jersey City, NJ",52,50,159,4.0,4/14/2018,"Got an invite for this years ""International Women's Day Celebration"". Based from a New Yorker local that I spoke to they consider this as the ""New York White House of the City"". The place is nice, well kept to its original look and feeling. You'll have a blast of the past experience once you're inside. Recommended!",,,
2,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1115,19792,4.0,5/9/2017,Four Stars because they have free tours of this historic mansion. You have to go to the Gracie Mansion Conservancy Web Site for info. Tours are on certain days and there's different times of day for tours. You must sign up on line in advance. You can walk around the outside of the Mansion and take photos. There's lots of security guards. Lots of cameras too. The park grounds around the mansion are well cared for. I enjoy the landscaping. If you're in the neighborhood you may want to visit. You may even see the Mayor. He has chosen to reside here during his term in office.,55,35,54
3,Kiesha B.,"New York, NY",5,135,61,5.0,1/8/2018,I attended a holiday party here and my oh my did I have a wonderful time. It is such a beautiful place well decorated with a whole lot of fancy stuff. Had some wine and plenty of appetizers.,,,
4,Dewan A.,"Haledon, NJ",683,1438,1701,5.0,2/17/2017,"Excellent spot. 1) The tour is fantastic. It is every Tuesday, and you have to register a spot online. 2) The tour was an hour long. Learned some great history and saw some excellent artifacts. 3) Plus the tour is free. Which is nice.",2,,2
5,Nilsa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,276,287,5.0,5/13/2016,"Asian-Pacific American Heritage Reception on a mild summer evening outdoors in Gracie Mansion. I'm glad I uber'ed my way here since the walk from the train is about 17 minutes long. Security is tight but everyone was extremely friendly and courteous. The water view is impressive. Unfortunately, I didn't get to go inside the mansion, but hopefully next time!",1,,1
6,Felicia G.,"New York, NY",688,112,482,5.0,5/16/2017,"Finally met Mayor Bill de Blasio and first lady, they are very nice and inspiring. Gracie Mansion is a historical site of New York City, front garden is cute, and back yard it's tremendous view of water front. Very beautiful !",1,,1
7,Richard S.,"Delray Beach, FL",164,1041,2752,4.0,7/4/2016,"""Lucky""We were lucky to book a tour of Gracie Mansion which is only available on Tuesdays. You must sign up in advance.It was 1 hour long seeing the newest addition which was added in 1960's and 2 of the original rooms.Definitely worth visiting",1,,
8,Pete W.,"New York, NY",138,37,32,5.0,9/7/2016,Gracie Mansion is called the People's House. Former Mayor Bloomberg spearheaded a major restoration of the NYC landmark.,,,
9,Judith S.,"Delray Beach, FL",5,5,0,1.0,8/31/2017,"I took a tour on tues 8/29 with Barbara and about 25 others including a dog and several young children. Most of the house was closed due to a private function so we saw only 3 rooms and foyer.  Barbara was knowledgeable but uninspiring and seemed overwhelmed with size of group.  Most artwork wasn't even discussed and we were referred to a handbook we received for further explanation.  I was dissatisfied with the small amount of the mansion that was available for tour and huge size of group.  We were advised to come back again and hope to be lucky enough to view rest of the house.  In conclusion I'd like to add that a tour guide is not just a dispenser of factual and historical knowledge.  She is a performer who should inspire, entertain and engage a group.  Barbara couldn't have been more boring.",,,1
10,Rita L.,"Manhattan, NY",71,273,701,4.0,10/23/2013,"Attended an event here, fancy schmancy. Place was huge...I took the train and then took the bus here so its a shorter walk. Even though I mainly stayed on the first floor, this place was very cozy and welcoming. Breakfast Buffet...mini muffins, parmesan proscuitto (SOOO GOOD), yogurt, fresh fruits, freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee, tea. Waiters are nice and willing to help. Lunch...arugula salad with grilled chicken, bread with butter, side of corn with peppers. DELICIOUS. Waiters are constantly moving around and collecting plates to clear tables. I would come here again, just to look at the other floors (if there are).",2,1,1
11,Laura G.,"Raleigh, NC",212,528,548,5.0,4/15/2015,"Haven't been inside the Mansion, but have been spending time throughout the different seasons walking around the park. Lots of benches. Lots of trash cans. Beautiful view of East River. One time I tried to ask the security guard if I could come in for a tour. I almost thought I saw an inkling of him saying yes. But I think you must have to arrange a tour prior to arriving on the doorstep. At  Christmas time you can catch a view of their tree from one of the windows. One day I'll take a tour and see the inside.",2,1,1
12,Peter N.,"New York, NY",10,88,0,4.0,3/20/2016,"I love Gracie Mansion, it just needs new residents. We went on (literally) the very last tour that allowed visitors upstairs before BdB (not his real name, look it up) took office. Truly stunning, although the West Elm decorator was there, chewing her gum with her mouth open and directing which antiques should be discarded. Kinda symbolic. This guy isn't who people think he is. Don't kid yourself, it's all about Bill.",1,3,1
13,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,4/1/2012,"Living close by I have walked the grounds of the park it sits on many times, Carl Schurz Park, and visited Gracie Mansion on a few occasions over they years. Built in 1799 the mansion has been called home to many NYC mayors over the years, and even though our current mayor refuses to live there, it is used for occassional events, functions, and dignitary dinners. Over the years the mansion has gone through a few renovations, the last in 2002 when both the interior and exterior were restored. It's a wonderful representation of a ""Federal Style"" structure overlooking beautifully well kept grounds and a view of the East River. Nowadays tours can be arranged which include the public rooms, the private apartments, garden and surrounding park. It's definitely worth a visit to see this historic NYC building.General Tours are offered on most Wednesdays at 10 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM and 2 PM. General admission is $7 for adults, $4 for seniors, and students are admitted free of charge. Tours last approximately forty-five minutes.School Tours are scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday mornings and are free of charge.Fun facts -The original footage from The WPIX Yule Log was filmed at Gracie Mansion.The mansion was featured in a few big films over the years such as the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Ghostbusters II, and City Hall with Al Pacino and John Cusack. Seems as now our current mayor does not want the future mayor to take up residence here. Easy for him to say - he is a billionaire that lives in his own multi-million dollar townhouse on the UES!",19,12,15
14,Deborah H.,"Ridgewood, NJ",100,768,0,4.0,3/24/2012,"I went to a luncheon tea with the NYC branch of the Jane Austen Society on a 78 degree day with the star magnolias and all the daffodils showing their colors 3 weeks ahead of time.  The tea was good and the scones were excellent.  The also had a nice assortment of tiny sandwiches.  The food was 3 star (good) but the environment was 5 star.We got to see the full house including the bathrooms-The current Mayor, Bloomburg, does not stay there but uses it for many receptions and for select fund raising events.  I recommend signing up for the tour.",3,,2
15,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7750,14306,4.0,10/24/2015,"Inside one of the best parks in Manhattan, Gracie Mansion seems perennially under construction, but all for the better I suppose.",1,,
16,Diana D.,"New York, NY",18,23,16,5.0,6/23/2015,Lucky for me I live 2 blocks away & have been on the grounds several times.  I walk the trail along the east river & the view is very nice.  I think my favorite part is that it doesn't seem to be a tourist attraction & is extremely quiet.  The grounds are kept extremely clean & I always see New York's finest walking around scoping out the area.  I would highly recommend stopping by even if it's only to relax & enjoy the view.  I do need to go on the tour to see inside but I'll do it soon.   I'll update my review once I take the actual tour.,1,,
17,Pamela M.,"Manhattan, NY",93,150,99,4.0,7/1/2015,"Beautiful mansion on the E. River, great place to go to you and just be at peace at the world and forget that the hustle and bustle of the city exist.",,,
18,Nina H.,"Manhattan, NY",19,2,0,5.0,7/12/2016,"A quintessential piece of NYC history. Free tours on Tuesdays. Just sign up on the website beforehand. Emily did a wonderful job giving a tour and providing a detailed history of the original house built in 1799 and the addition built in 1966. She was enthusiastic, friendly and  had a great knowledge of the history of the house and it's artifacts, as well as NYC. Highly recommend!",,,
19,Kwai L.,"Forest Hills, NY",270,260,556,4.0,2/13/2013,I came here for an event and took the tour.  This house was so beautiful and filled with art and history.  I overheard some of the history as the tour guides explained pieces but was a little overwhelmed by how rich every corner was.  The backyard and grounds behind the house allows you to have a great view of the Robert F. Kennedy bridge.  This house is a great tour if you should find yourself this far east on the upper east side.,1,,1
20,Emma M.,"London, United Kingdom",2591,438,329,2.0,7/12/2012,"I was really looking forward to this, and had booked it for my brother's visit to New York as something a little off the beaten tourist track. It's a beautiful house set in gorgeous grounds, and has been restored to a very high standard. I thoroughly enjoyed our walk along the river to get to it (it's quite far from the road, so anyone with difficulty walking may want to investigate if they can take wheelchairs)It felt pleasantly disorganised when we arrived - we had to gather round our guide and hand money in for the tour. I thought that boded well for a relaxed and comfortable tour of the house. (I was wrong!) I do understand that everything in the house is precious and that it hasn't been opened up before because it has actually been a residential home. (Thanks Michael for choosing to live in your own home and letting us nose around this one!) However, the rules and protocol for simply walking around the place were extremely restrictive. We were 'held' in a small ante room for about 10 minutes while something mysterious and therefore really interesting was happening on the other side of a large locked door. When I asked what was holding us up, I got a very curt reply from the guide, who said that she wasn't allowed to tell me. (It transpired later that they were moving a table across the hallway, but I probably shouldn't have told you that...shhhhh.) I think that I was then marked out as a 'trouble maker' because every time I asked a question, I was met with a finger (luckily not the middle one!) held up and an ""I'll answer questions at the end"". Is it good for kids? Well, I'm a pretty well behaved woman in my 30s, and I managed to break at least 4 rules and get told off, so perhaps slightly less rebellious children may get through unscathed!",3,17,1
21,Mike C.,"Laguna Beach, CA",28,215,42,4.0,10/1/2013,Didn't actually get to see the inside but the grounds and outside looked nice.,,,
22,J. K.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,335,55,5.0,10/26/2013,"What's there not to love?  It's beautiful.  Definitely something that should be on everyone's New York Bucket List.  Photos aren't allowed, so I won't go into the details about the inner rooms.  See it for yourself!  You won't regret the experience.(Tip:  if you are there for a function, find the cute Slovak bartender and tell him ""lubim ta"" to ensure that you get extra large wine pours!)",,2,1
23,Jane R.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,559,71,5.0,1/11/2013,"I came here for an event one evening. I didn't realize that this was supposed to be the Mayor's residence although he's the only one who hasn't lived there. It was a great event. Coat check, good food, decent wines, and amazing apple cider. As a guest, we were allowed to tour every room in the house. In each section there was a guide who was able to explain the history of each room. It is a gorgeous old colonial style house with amazing views of the East River. I definitely did not feel like I was still in NYC. Although it  is a quite a walk all the way from the 86th street 4/5/6 trains, it was definitely worth it. I wonder if they rent out for weddings and such because it's a great event space!",2,1,1
24,Glennznyc R.,"Las Vegas, NV",416,127,75,5.0,7/22/2012,the LGBT BBQ during gay pride week was AWESOME. It's so cool that Mayor Bloomberg does this for the community! The food was great and the service provided by the catering company was excellent. And the security staff was pleasant and attitude-free! Thank you!,1,1,1
25,James M.,"New York, NY",2,16,4,4.0,4/29/2013,Gracie Mansion is beautiful....both on the outside and inside.  it is very spacious and impeccably maintained.   I have also taken a video of the exterior for people who might be interested in seeing what Gracie Mansion looks like and what Carl Schurz park looks like.youtube.com/watch?v=32Dq…,,,
26,Jesse R.,"Denver, CO",102,265,40,5.0,7/22/2010,"I enjoyed a fantastic summer BBQ here sponsored by the Mayor's Office for NYC college and graduate interns.  The event went off without a hitch, and there was a ton of great burgers, hotdogs and a plethora of healthy salads and cold drinks.  The staff runs a tight ship, of course, because security is a top priority.  The grounds are very well kept, and there is a decent view of the river.  If you have a chance to check out Gracie Mansion, either for a public tour or private event, definitely go!",1,,
27,Michael W.,"New York, NY",14,209,6,4.0,1/28/2009,"This is a warmer weather spot to visit, with beauty, and a nice path along the river.  Years ago I actually photographed a model from the FordAgency along that very path.  She wore a nice pink jump suit! :)The home or museum.. home to past Governor's of New York,is also an architectural delight.   How many buildings in NY are stillwell kept and built in 1799?  Go during the springtime or summer...on a lazy afternoon and enjoy the museum and the view.",,,
28,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",100,2100,2099,5.0,12/26/2005,"Constructed in 1799, the two-story, Federal-style structure overlooking the East River remained a private home for nearly a century until it was purchased by the city and made part of Carl Schurz Park, first as an administration office, then as an ice cream parlor, and finally as the original home of the Museum of the City of New York. It became the official mayoral residence in 1942, with Fiorello LaGuardia the first to occupy it. In recent years, bachelor mayors Ed Koch and the current Michael Bloomberg have maintained apartments elsewhere in the city, using the mansion primarily for official functions and to house visiting dignitaries. A major restoration in 2002 returned the interior - a dazzling mix of decorative styles in Crayola-colored rooms - to its former glory. Docents provide one-hour tours that concentrate on both architectural and design elements and city history on Wednesdays from 10:00am until 3:00pm; advance reservations must be made by calling (212) 570-4773.",12,,7

31,Misti L.,"San Francisco, CA",106,566,44,5.0,2/9/2008,I was originally just wasting time on a walk when I stumbled on Gracie and couldn't believe my eyes.  It was just so out of place but so beautiful!  Then when you know how long it has been there and what it has survived you really have to appreciate it.   It kind of reminds me of places like Paris where old mansions still live through hundreds of years of mayhem and people.,1,,1
